<HEAD>HUD Audit: Island Park Officials Excluded Blacks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Officials of Island Park, home village of U.S.
Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato, rigged the distribution of federally
subsidized homes in the early 1980s to keep out blacks, according to
a published report.
   The New York Times in its Thursday editions reported that an
audit by the Department of Housing and Urban Development indicates
that one person who received preferential treatment was D'Amato's
cousin, Anthony Ciccimarro.
   At the time, D'Amato was supervisor of the Town of Hempstead, of
which Island Park is an incorporated subdivision. He was elected to
the U.S. Senate shortly after that, the newspaper said.
   Ciccimarro was selected to buy a $40,000 HUD house, the Times
said.
   Also receiving preferential treatment was Geraldine McGann, a
village board member and a high-ranking HUD administrator whose son
received a $44,500 house, it said.
   In the 1980s, Nassau County got enough money to build 285 houses
for lower-income families. Island Park, which is 97 percent white,
got enough money to build 44 homes ranging from $40,000 to $64,000.
   The audit does not say if the people selected for the HUD houses
actually were eligible to buy them. Buyers included the niece of the
village clerk, the niece of a village trustee, two village
supervisors, a lawyer who soon will become a village justice and the
daughter of a village employee, the newspaper said. None of them are
black.
   The HUD houses were supposed to be advertised in local newspapers
so lower-income residents, especially minorities, would have a
chance to buy a home.
   Instead, some selected residents were told in advance when the
ads would appear and they slipped their applications under the
Village Hall door before dawn, the Times reported.
   The 1984 audit recommended disciplinary action against Mrs.
McGann and the village but no penalties.
   Mrs. McGann last year was promoted to regional HUD administrator
after her friend, D'Amato, lobbied Congress and the White House on
her behalf, the newspaper said.
   When the Times requested a copy of the audit, Mrs. McGann deleted
the names of eight villagers, including her son.
   ``This program was a mockery,'' said Jeff Pless, who did the
audit. ``It took everyone's tax money and gave it to the people who
didn't need it.''

   United Airlines, the only U.S. carrier serving Beijing, announced
Wednesday it was adding at least two extra flights to the three
scheduled weekly to China's capital, and Continental Airlines said
it will join the evacuation with charter flights.
   ``United Airlines stands ready to assist Americans who desire
safe and efficient transportation out of China,'' Chairman Stephen
M. Wolf said.
   The first of the additional flights from Tokyo arrived in Beijing
on Wednesday, said spokesman Rob Doughty. It was scheduled to to
Shanghai before returning to Tokyo, but Doughty couldn't say how
many of the 400 seats were occupied.
   United has agreed to provide the planes and crews and the State
Department will determine who boards the Boeing 747s, Doughty said.
   The second charter flight, a round-trip flight between Beijing
and Tokyo only, received approval from both governments late
Wednesday and is scheduled to arrive Thursday, Doughty said.
   Two United commercial flights which had already made round trips
between Tokyo and Beijing earlier this week were not fully booked
out of China, he noted.
   There were 307 passengers on one and 335 on the other, he said.
The Boeing 747-100s used on the route can carry more than 400
passengers.
   Earlier Wednesday, the Bush administration urged all Americans to
leave China after rifle fire broke windows at apartment buildings
occupied by U.S. government workers.
   While the administration noted there had been no direct threats
against foreigners, it cited an increasingly chaotic situation. On
Tuesday, the government's advice had focused solely on Beijing.
   United personnel reported no problems at or en route to the
Beijing airport, Doughty said.
   Continental Airlines announced in Houston that it would provide a
DC-10 for U.S.-chartered shuttle flights between Tokyo and Beijing,
perhaps through the weekend.
   The aircraft, with a capacity for 284 passengers, will operate
two daily shuttle flights on Friday, airline spokesman Ned Walker
said.
   There was no immediate word from Northwest Airlines in
Minneapolis about whether it would supplement it twice-weekly flight
to Shanghai.

<HEAD>Appeals Court Restores Timber Injunction</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court Wednesday restored
the injunction prohibiting the U.S. Bureau of Land Management from
selling old-growth timber around northern spotted owl nests in
Western Oregon.
   Acting on an appeal brought by the Portland Audubon Society and
other environmental groups, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
without comment restored the year-old injunction lifted last month
by a federal judge.
   The action was praised by environmentalists, who contend the
spotted owl will become extinct unless the ancient forests where it
lives and hunts are preserved.
   The timber industry contends that thousands of jobs will be lost
unless logging of old growth timber on federal lands is allowed to
continue.
   The action means as much as 400 million board feet of timber, a
third of the agency's annual harvest in Oregon, won't be offered for
sale, said BLM spokesman Don Smurthwaite.
   Five timber sales on the Medford and Coos Bay BLM districts which
were sold during the course of the legal wrangling weren't included
in the injunction.
   The action was separate from a lawsuit filed by environmentalists
against the U.S. Forest Service pending in U.S. District Court in
Seattle that stopped harvest of 1 billion board feet of timber on
national forests in Oregon and Washington.
   In lifting the injunction, Judge Helen Frye said the BLM failed
to consider new information in preparing its managment plans for
spotted owls, which the U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service has proposed
for listing as a threatened species.

<HEAD>Brazilian Firms Gets Film Rights of Ecologist's Life Story</HEAD>
<UNK>By TODD LEWAN ^Associated Press Writer</UNK>
<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Brazilian film company beat out
Hollywood filmmakers and purchased the rights to film the life story
of the assassinated Brazilian ecologist Francisco ``Chico'' Mendes.
   JN Filmes signed a $1.76 million contract with the Chico Mendes
Foundation to lease the exclusive rights to an English-Portuguese
film, TV series, autobiographical book and videocassette on Mendes'
life, producer Jofre Rodrigues told a news conference.
   The announcement Wednesday ended a two-month contest among
international movie companies _ including Warner Bros. Inc., United
Artists and Robert Redford, representing 20th Century Fox _ for the
rights to shoot a movie about the life and death of Mendes.
   Mendes, 44, was the leader of a rubber tappers union who fought
to save the Amazon jungle from deforestation.
   In December, he became to many the world's first ecological
martyr when he was shot to death outside his modest wooden house in
the Acre state jungle town of Xapuri, 2,700 miles northwest of Rio.
   Authorities arrested the son of a cattle rancher in the shooting.
   Mendes had won a United Nations award for his struggle against
ranchers eager to clear the rain forest for grazing. His death
struck a chord worldwide.
   Hollywood producers rushed to the Amazon with offers to buy film
rights.
   But a four-member panel from the Chico Mendes Foundation, an
organization made up of ecologists, rubber tappers and family
members, chose Brazil's JN Filmes on Tuesday night.
   ``We are not trying solely to make money on this project,''
Chico's widow, Ilzamar, told The Associated Press. ``We want to get
news out throughout the world of who Chico was, what he stood for
and the forces who tried to stop him.''
   Panel member Gilson Pescador said JN was chosen because its offer
included making a TV series, a video and a book based on Mendes'
life.
   Pescador called some of the Hollywood proposals ``illusory,'' but
also noted, ``We thought a Brazilian film company would best show
the destruction that's going on and the reality of the people of the
region.''
   He declined to confirm a reported $1.2 million offer made this
week by Warner Bros. for rights to the movie alone.
   The movie script, to be written by Brazilian author Marcio de
Souza, will be in English and Portuguese and foreign distributors
will be contacted to help sell the film abroad, Pescador said.
   Jose Claudio Padilha, the designated director, said filming for
the estimated $10 million project would begin in May 1990 on
location in Xapuri. Plans also include filming in Washington and
Miami.
   Pescador said nearly $400,000 from the rights would go to family
members, with $400,000 going to public education and health projects
for Indians and rubber tappers throughout the region.
   He said Ilzamar Mendes would donate the remainder to the rubber
tappers union and other such organizations in the state of Acre, he
said.

   A teacher was illegally suspended by a
school board for refusing to wear a tie in his classroom, a circuit
judge ruled Wednesday.
   The ruling doesn't ensure that Bill Webb, 46, will return to his
Point Pleasant High School classroom, but it undermines the Mason
County Board of Education's main charges in the math teacher's
firing.
   ``If they couldn't suspend him, they sure as hell couldn't fire
him,'' the teacher's wife, Julie, said in a telephone from the
couple's Gallipolis, Ohio, home.
   Her husband was en route to Chicago to appear on ``The Oprah
Winfrey Show,'' which planned a program Thursday on people fired
because of the way they dress.
   The Mason County board suspended Webb three times last fall,
accusing him of insubordination for violating a dress code requiring
male teachers to wear dress pants and ties.
   Webb, whose standard classroom wardrobe consisted of blue jeans
and cotton shirts, openly challenged Superintendent Charles
Chambers' order, drawing suspensions lasting 4, 11 and 30 days
before being fired Dec. 19.
   Kanawha Circuit Judge Charlie King's ruling set aside the 11-day
suspension, meaning Webb will be paid for that time, said the
teacher's attorney, Larry Kopleman.
   A hearing on the firing and the 30-day suspension is pending,
Kopleman said. Webb didn't challenge the four-day suspension because
he was paid.
   King said the dress code was improperly established and that Webb
had the right to disobey rules he believed were illegal.
   ``If you challenge a rule that is in effect unlawful, it's not
insubordination,'' said Kopleman. The board claimed Webb should have
worn a tie while challenging Chambers' order.
   ``The superintendent didn't have the authority to unilaterally
issue a dress code,'' said Kopleman. ``Only the board has the
authority. That was one of our premier arguments.''
   Board member Harry Siders, who introduced a proposal to fine
Webb, said Wednesday night he wasn't aware of King's decision and
that the board had not talked about what to do if Webb's appeals
were successful.
   Board president Emma Kearns could not be reached. Chambers and
board attorney Diane Johnson have unlisted numbers.
   The next board meeting is scheduled for June 19.
   The controversy began in August 1988, when the board said male
instructors would have to wear ties, a change from contracts
teachers signed last spring. Webb, who has worked for the Mason
County school system for 19 years and is also a farmer, has spent
his spare time working around the house and at a body shop he runs.
   Mrs. Webb said her husband will be wearing denim from top to
bottom on the Oprah Winfrey program Thursday.
   ``I pressed them before he left,'' she said. ``I seldom press
them, but this is big time.''

<TEXT>
   A national Republican Party official resigned
Wednesday in the uproar over a memo he wrote comparing House Speaker
Thomas S. Foley's voting record with that of a homosexual
congressman.
   President Bush as described as ``disgusted by this entire
incident'' and as considering it closed.
   However, Democratic Party chief Ronald Brown said the resignation
of ``one staffer'' wasn't good enough and suggested his Republican
counterpart, Bush's former campaign manager Lee Atwater, should be
fired by the president.
   Mark Goodin, a press assistant in Bush's 1988 presidential
campaign, wrote the memo and had it distributed as communications
director of the Republican National Committee.
   The memo, which Goodin said was sent out without his boss
Atwater's knowledge, compared Foley's voting record to that of
liberal Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass. The memo was titled: ``Tom Foley:
Out of the Liberal Closet.''
   ``The president was very upset,'' said White House chief of staff
John Sununu in an interview reported in Thursday editions of The New
York Times. ``I was upset. It went too far. It was wrong. The
innuendo was wrong. It's wrong not because it damages our
relationship with the Democrats. It's wrong because it's wrong.
   ``It's a terrible thing to happen at this time. It was not
appropriate or fair,'' said Sununu, who said both he and Bush had
rebuked Atwater.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Bush called Atwater,
his 1988 campaign manager, Wednesday morning, shortly before the
resignation was announced. Atwater had telephoned Foley to apologize
Tuesday night.
   Bush's spokesman said, ``He was disgusted by this entire
incident.''
   ``We consider the matter closed,'' he added.
   Foley, likewise, commenting after a previously scheduled meeting
with Bush at the White House, said, ``The issue is closed.'' He said
there was no mention of it during the meeting.
   Earlier at the Capitol, Foley said that on the telephone Atwater
had been ``deeply apologetic for any inferences of personal
character.''
   ``He repudiated the statement and apologized ... I accepted
that,'' said Foley, adding that Atwater promised there would be no
more such attacks.
   Foley, in his first full day as House speaker, said any
suggestion that he is homosexual is ``entirely untrue of course.''
   Brown, the chairman of the Democratic National Commitee, said of
Goodin's resignation, ``One staffer can't take the fall for an
entire Republican political operation that's up to its knees in
sewer-style politics. I think it's fair to ask President Bush if
he'll also have his hand-picked party chairman, Lee Atwater, to
resign.
   ``The president himself has to be accountable for the activities
of his henchman,'' Brown said in a statement.
   Congressional Republican leaders also decried the memo and the
strategy it seemed to represent.
   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole said on the Senate floor, ``I
would guess this is a rather deliberate effort on the part of some
to smear Tom Foley ... on his first day as speaker. ... I would say
this is not politics. This is garbage. We're disgusted by it.''
   Dole declared, ``To those who have now departed the Republican
National Committee, I say, `Good riddance!'''
   House Minority Leader Robert Michel, R-Ill., expressed dismay
over the memo Tuesday and called both Bush and Atwater, aides said.
   Michel, at the White House for the meeting with Bush and Foley,
told reporters, ``It was a mistake obviously from the national
committee's point of view.''
   He said he did not know if Goodin had been asked to resign but
said he had told Atwater, ``There's got to be some remedy for what
took place, and Lee, it's your shot. Do whatever you think is
appropriate.''
   Goodin said in his resignation letter to Atwater, ``At no time
did I ever intend to damage anyone's reputation. Nonetheless, the
purpose of the memorandum has been misconstrued. And in that regard,
I have no one to blame but myself.''
   Rep. Tony Coelho of California, the second-ranking House
Democrat, said Bush needed to take more responsibility.
   ``They're playing good cop, bad cop,'' Coelho said before the
resignation was announced. ``Here's a guy sent in by Bush to do the
dirty deeds, and he calls and apologizes after the fact. If they're
really upset about these tactics, all they have to do is fire
somebody.''
   Rep. Mickey Edwards, R-Okla., chairman of the House Republican
Policy Committee, said, ``I think we're going to be moving rather
strongly to make sure it stops.''

<HEAD>Price Put on Head of Boulder Man Acquitted of Rape</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOULDER, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Muslim couple has put a price on the head
of man acquitted of raping their daughter in her University of
Colorado dormitory room, the district attorney has told the FBI.
   The woman's parents ``are prominent Islamics residing in
Indonesia'' who apparently believe it appropriate to pay someone to
kill 18-year-old Jason Martinez, lawyer Dan Caplis said in a court
document released Wednesday.
   Caplis told District Attorney Alex Hunter that he compared
Martinez's plight to that of author Salman Rushdie _ who was
sentenced to death by the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini for
writing ``The Satanic Verses.''
   Hunter has asked the FBI to complain through diplomatic channels.
   ``There's very little that agencies in the United States can
do,'' said Assistant Boulder District Attorney Bill Wise. ``It's
very difficult for any law enforcement agency to do anything other
than keep a closer eye on Mr. Martinez.''
   Martinez has gone into hiding, moving three times in the past
month, Caplis said. ``He's terrified, basically, out of his mind. He
just firmly believes that they will try to kill him,'' the lawyer
said.
   Martinez was accused of raping the woman in her dormitory room
last October. He claimed she consented to have sex with him.
Prosecutors dismissed the case without filing charges. The woman
returned to Indonesia earlier this year.
   When Martinez said he would sue the woman unless she apologized
publicly, she beat him to the punch with a lawsuit of her own.
   Caplis first got wind of a possible threat against his client's
life while taking a deposition for the civil case from one of the
woman's friends. A second friend confirmed the story, Caplis said.
   The alleged murder plot came to light after Caplis petitioned a
Boulder District Court judge to lift a gag order in the case. He
argued that the public spotlight might help protect Martinez.

<TEXT>
   Convicted ``Onion Field'' killer Jimmy
Lee Smith was sentenced to a 90-day jail term on a drug charge
Wednesday, but prosecutors dropped assault and attempted rape
charges for lack of evidence, officials said.
   Smith, 58, pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of being under
the influence of a banned narcotic substance, said Donna Stuedgen,
Citris Municipal Court clerk. Police said the drug was heroin.
   Commissioner Robert C. Lutz sentenced Smith to a 90-day term, to
be served concurrent with any other terms stemming from a possible
parole violation, Ms. Stuedgen said.
   Prosecutors rejected police charges of suspicion of attempted
rape, false imprisonment and heroin possession for lack of evidence,
said Kim Stalvey, a secretary at the West Covina disrict attorney's
office.
   Police arrested Smith late Monday after a 36-year-old woman
alleged that he held her captive over the weekend. The woman escaped
and called police Monday, officials said.
   Smith still could be sent back to state prison because his arrest
on Monday violated terms of his parole in the ``Onion Field'' police
killing, officials said.
   Smith could serve up to a year even without a new conviction,
said Harold W. White, deputy regional administrator for the state
Department of Parole and Community Services Division.
   The state Board of Prison Terms can revoke parole upon a finding
of ``just cause,'' said Randall Mark Stewart, Smith's parole agent.
   Smith and Gregory Powell abducted Los Angeles Police Department
officers Ian Campbell and Karl Hettinger in March 1963 and drove
them to an onion field south of Bakersfield.
   Powell killed Campbell and shot at Hettinger, who escaped on foot
in the darkness. Powell and Smith were twice sentenced to death for
the killing. The sentences were overturned.
   The crime and ensuing trial were recounted in Joseph Wambaugh's
best-selling 1973 novel, ``The Onion Field,'' which was made into a
movie.
   Powell is serving a life term. Smith was paroled in February 1982
after serving 19 years at Soledad Correctional Facility.
   Smith was ordered back to prison in 1982 for six months after
failing a drug test and neglecting to tell his parole officer he was
leaving the Los Angeles area.
   In July 1984, he was convicted of selling heroin while on parole
and sentenced to five years. He was paroled in November 1986. His
parole was revoked twice after that.
   Hettinger, now a supervisor on the Kern County Board of
Supervisors, said Smith's death sentence should have stood.
   ``Both of them should have been executed,'' he said. ``This is
typical of a continuing pattern of violence from Smith. I know what
he did to me and my partner.''

   Scientists said today they have discovered two
highly unusual substances in old soils, supporting the idea that an
ancient comet or asteroid struck the Earth and maybe killed off the
dinosaurs.
   Two amino acids that are very rare on Earth but abundant in some
meteorites appear in sediments that formed around 65 million years
ago, the time of a mass extinction involving organisms from
dinosaurs to marine plankton.
   The finding is ``a very compelling piece of evidence'' that an
extraterrestrial object struck the Earth around that time, said
study co-author Jeffrey Bada.
   But in a recent telephone interview, he said he took no stand on
whether the impact caused the extinction.
   Bada and Meixun Zhao of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography
at the University of California, San Diego, present their work in
today's issue of the British journal Nature.
   An editorial accompanying the report called the findings
intriguing but cited ``troubling'' questions about the researchers'
interpretation.
   The work follows on a hypothesis proposed in 1980, that mass
extinction occurred some 65 million years ago because a
mountain-sized object struck the Earth, kicking up large quantities
of dust and igniting huge fires. The dust and smoke blocked the
sun's rays, and many species froze or starved as their food supply
disappeared, the hypothesis suggests.
   Supporters of the idea note that sediments that formed at the
time of the mass extinction contain unusually high concentrations of
iridium, a substance rare in the Earth's crust but found in
meteorites.
   Skeptics counter that the iridium may have been produced by
extensive volcanic activity.
   The new study found amino acids called alpha-aminoisobutyric acid
and racemic isovaline in sediments that lie close to the main
iridium-bearing layer in Stevns Klint, Denmark.
   These amino acids are extremely rare on Earth and not likely to
come from volcanoes, the reseachers said. In addition, the ratio of
the amounts of the two substances was comparable to that previously
measured in a meteorite.
   Surprisingly, the substances were not found in the same layer as
the bulk of the iridium, but only in nearby strata, the researchers
said. Perhaps the amino acids leaked away from the iridium-bearing
clay, they said.
   But that does not explain how the amino acids could vacate the
clay completely, John Cronin of the chemistry department at Arizona
State University wrote in the editorial.
   The researchers also said they found greater amounts of the amino
acids than one would expect to survive from the impact of a
meteoritelike body. They suggested that the celestial body may have
carried unusually high amounts of the substances, at least in
comparison to its iridium content. A comet might have done that,
they said.
   Cronin, in a telephone interview, said no celestial object has
been found to meet that requirement. Too little is known about
comets to know whether they could be the explanation, he said.
   To follow up on the new findings, scientists could study
different locales and search 65-million-year-old sediments for other
amino acids that occur in meteorites but apparently not on Earth, he
said. More than 50 amino acids with no known terrestrial source have
been found in meteorites, he said.

   Count Michel de Saint-Pol, losing his last
battle with officialdom, has been banished from his ancestral
chateau, which is being turned into a local attraction replete with
golf course.
   ``I wanted so much to die at La Perriere,'' the penniless
73-year-old count was quoted by the French news agency Agence
France-Presse as saying.
   The count was expelled Monday from the crumbling edifice where
his ancestors lived for 300 years in this town 255 miles southwest
of Paris.
   For temporary housing, a monks' abbey lent him a farmhouse with
neither electricity nor running water.
   De Saint-Pol was given an indemnity of $300,000 in lieu of the
chateau _ money which he has not yet touched.
   The bearded count, without financial means, has been fighting
since 1981 to keep his chateau, a dilapidated but historic monument
which the municipality wanted to restore.

<HEAD>Doesn't Want to Be a `Czar,' But Pledges to Push Education</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE FEINSILBER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tom Foley says he has no appetite for becoming
an all-powerful ``czar speaker'' but wants to use his new power as
leader of the House to bolster the nation's education system and
arrest the growth of an underclass in America.
   At the same time, he concedes that under predecessor Jim Wright
the Democrats sometimes used their majority status to muscle aside
the Republicans. He vows that won't happen under a Speaker Foley.
   And he says he has given no thought to his new situation as
second in the line of succession to the presidency _ even though his
mother ``is enjoying that fact.''
   ``But the speaker of the House has never succeeded to the
presidency and we all pray that the president has a healthy and long
and successful administration at least for the next 3{ years,'' he
said, adding that any American who does not wish President Bush well
``is no friend of the republic.''
   Relaxed, sipping a diet cola and back from reminiscing during a
90-minute Oval Office lunch with onetime freshman congressman Bush,
Foley demonstrated in an interview Wednesday the style that
propelled him into the speakership with the good will of many
Republicans.
   ``The days of the czar speakers have long been over,'' Foley
said, recalling the tale that 19th century speaker Thomas Reed, when
asked by a constituent for a copy of the rules that govern the
House, ``sent by return mail an autographed photograph of himself.''
   Foley rejected the view that the House is ``a moral swamp,'' but
said some politicians come to Washington out of a love for political
warfare and their every act is aimed at the next election while
others come to govern.
   He put himself among the latter and, ticking off the issues that
are dear to his heart, listed education high.
   ``I'm worried about the growth of the so-called underclass,'' he
said, ``millions of young adults and children who are not, for one
reason or another, performing in school, or looking forward to an
ability to compete in the job market.''
   He noted that South Korean children have pulled ahead of Japanese
children and far ahead of American kids in educational achievements.
   He said Korean youngsters go to school for 240 days a year and
carry two lunches _ one for noon, one for late in the day _ because
their school day is so long. By contrast, American children
typically attend school only 180 days.
   ``I think the quality of elementary and secondary education is
going to determine more our ability to successfully compete in an
international economy than probably anything else,'' he said.
   He said he worries about the ``enormous strains'' imposed on
middle-class families, especially those with a few children in
college at the same time.
   He has no agenda of legislation to shove through Congress, but he
cited civil rights and civil liberties as important to him, along
with education and the enactment this year of congressional ethics
legislation.
   There is no ``Foley plan,'' he said, but one idea worth examining
``might be linking some extinguishment of honoraria with some staged
increase in salary'' for Congress.
   House members are allowed to keep $30,000 a year in fees for
giving speeches or writing. Most of the money comes from
special-interest groups, and some reform suggestions propose
eliminating such honoraria and raising congressional salaries.
   But Foley suggested he will be in no rush to propose a pay
increase in view of the uproar that cause the House to kill a
Bush-backed 50 percent raise in January.
   Foley conceded a point to Republicans, saying that under Wright,
``I think we've pushed it sometimes to the point where, while we
were still within the rules, we were making maximum use of the power
of the majority. ... I don't think we should do that.''
   Rep. Mickey Edwards of Oklahoma, chairman of the House Republican
Policy Committee, said if Foley is ``serious about a new
beginning,'' he should support a package of rules changes proposed
by the GOP last January. Democrats ignored the proposals under
Wright's leadership, he said.
   ``There is a new leader and Tom Foley has a different style,''
Edwards said, adding that Wright ``systematically excluded the
views, opinion, debate, amendments of people who disagreed with the
leadership, whether Democrats or Republicans.''

<HEAD>House Vote on FSX Bill Falls Short of Margin to Beat Veto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARTON REPPERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House opponents of the Bush administration's
planned $6 billion FSX fighter deal with Japan are far short of the
votes needed to override an expected presidential veto.
   A measure to restrict the deal passed the House on Wednesday but
only on a 262-155 vote, far less than the two-thirds margin of 290
needed to override a veto in the 435-member chamber.
   The administration already has agreed to develop the fighter
jointly with Japan. The measure passed Wednesday seeks to stipulate
the U.S. negotiating position in future talks on how the FSX, an
advanced version of the F-16 jet fighter, actually will be produced.
   An identical Senate resolution passed 72-27 on May 16.
   Opponents of the deal say it amounts to a giveaway of critical
U.S. defense technology, but the Bush administration says the
restrictive legislation would tie its hands in the talks.
   Before the measure was approved, Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, warned
that ``in case there's any doubt, the White House will veto this
amendment if it is passed.''
   The legislation would prohibit transfer to Japan of critical
American jet engine technology and bar Japan from selling to third
countries the FSX or any of the plane's major subcomponents.
   It also states that any agreement on coproduction of the FSX
should guarantee that at least 40 percent of the work _ including
provision of spare parts _ will be handled by American companies.
   Opponents declared that the legislation, sponsored by Rep. Terry
L. Bruce, D-Ill., might require renegotiation of a memorandum of
understanding already reached with Japan.
   Rep. Stephen J. Solarz, D-N.Y., chairman of the House Foreign
Affairs subcommittee on Asian and Pacific affairs, said the
legislation ``could arguably require a renegotiation of the FSX
agreement.''
   But a leading FSX opponent, Rep. Mel Levine, D-Calif., said the
restrictions embodied in the measure are needed to ``hold the
administration's feet to the fire'' in negotiations.
   Rep. Richard A. Gephardt, D-Mo., said afterward that ``the margin
by which both houses passed this legislation sends a message to the
president that we are serious about safeguarding America's trading
rights, protecting American jobs and preserving America's clear
advantage in aerospace technology and production.''
   Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., who sponsored the Senate version of
the FSX legislation, said it ``increases the leverage of executive
branch negotiators'' in dealing with future coproduction of the
plane.
   ``I sincerely hope the president will not veto improvements in
this project, or veto increased leverage for his negotiators,'' Byrd
said following the House vote.
   The measure was adopted after the House voted 320-98 to pass a
nonbinding sense-of-Congress resolution expressing disapproval of
the FSX deal in general, but that vote carries no legal weight.
   Under the FSX deal, General Dynamics is to join with Japan's
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries in jointly developing and producing the
warplane, for deployment by Japan in the late 1990s. Most of the
General Dynamics FSX work would be done at its F-16 plant in Fort
Worth, Texas.
   During more than five hours of House floor debate Wednesday,
opponents contended that the deal amounts to a loss of advanced
American technology that will be used by Japan to help propel its
own aircraft industry into head-to-head competition with the United
States in the world market.
   ``The sale of this technology represents an enormous threat to
the health of our domestic aircraft industry,'' said Rep. Dan
Glickman, D-Kan.
   FSX foes also said that Japan instead should have purchased ``off
the shelf'' American-made F-16s to help offset the U.S. trade
deficit with Japan of more than $50 billion.
   Supporters of the FSX said implementing the deal was important to
maintaining U.S.-Japan defense ties and would provide about $2.5
billion worth of work for American companies.
   Solarz told the House that he believes the agreement is ``very
much in the commercial, political and strategic interests of the
United States.''

<HEAD>Decision Expected Soon on Oil, Butter Sales to Soviets</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A decision may be announced soon by the
Agriculture Department on whether to sell the Soviet Union some
vegetable oil and butter at cut-rate prices.
   The Bush administration has been under pressure to add soybean
oil to the list of commodities eligible for the Export Enhancement
Program, or EEP, so that Moscow can buy the oil at subsidized prices.
   Corn oil and butter are also being sought for the EEP arrangement
with the Soviets. Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter has the
proposal under advisement, although there has been some resistance
to expand the subsidy program.
   A consumer advocate, Rodney E. Leonard, executive director of the
Community Nutrition Institute, told Yeutter in a May 26 letter the
soybean industry's proposal for subsidizing oil exports would be
``patently unfair'' for several reasons.
   Soybeans are in short supply in the United States and a bumper
harvest this fall will not change the situation. Food price
inflation will remain ``a constant threat to American consumers
until more normal food reserves are in place,'' he said.
   The global supply of soybean oil also is reported to be tighter
than normal, Leonard said.
   ``Soybean processors argue that domestic soybean oil supplies are
slightly at a surplus, a condition they say could be eliminated by
the Soviet sale,'' he said. ``However, domestic market conditions
appear to be tight enough so that the U.S. would likely need to
import 60,000 to 70,000 metric tons of food oil for every 100,000
tons of soybean oil sold to the Soviet Union.''
   Leonard contended that export subsidy programs for farm products
``are of doubtful value, even during periods when domestic supplies
are large.''
   But Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, and others in Congress contend that
soybean oil should be made available to the Soviet Union under EEP,
a program set up in 1985 to counter foreign subsidies.
   Harkin said last month that the Soviets want to buy 200,000 to
500,000 tons of U.S. soybean oil, and urged President Bush to
approve the sale under the subsidy program. He also asked that corn
oil be included.
   Of immediate concern, Harkin said, are Argentina's tax laws that
allow its processors to undercut U.S. soybean oil prices on the
world market by more than $160 per ton.
   ``The Soviet Union is a potential market for the equivalent of 1
billion bushels of soybeans a year,'' Harkin said. ``We need to move
vigorously to develop that market and secure a fair share of it for
our soybean industry.''
   Harkin noted that current U.S. inventories of soybean oil are at
record level of 1.76 million tons and that stocks of corn oil and
other vegetable oils also are large.

   The Agriculture Department says there are more
jobs waiting for the Class of 1989 at major agricultural colleges
than there are graduates to fill them.
   J. Patrick Jordan, administrator of the department's Cooperative
States Research Service, said Wednesday a recent informal survey
showed another decrease in the number of agricultural graduates. At
the same time, more companies are recruiting on campuses.
   The telephone survey was done by Purdue University, West
Lafayette, Ind. Although the number of graduates is down, the survey
found an increase in the number of freshmen enrolled in agricultural
courses.
   Allan D. Goecker, assistant dean of agriculture at Purdue, said
the job market has been more competitive and that both employers and
students are making earlier commitments.
   Half of the 1,721 undergraduates in Purdue's school of
agriculture are enrolled in three departments _ agricultural
economics, horticulture, and forestry and natural resources. The
school expects to graduate 365 seniors this year, up from 355 in
1988, Goecker said.
   Starting salaries for Purdue graduates range from $18,000 to
$30,000 a year, with the average just over $20,000, he said.
   Goecker is a member of a USDA committee that has forecast an
annual shortage of 4,000 food and agricultural science graduates in
the 1990s.
   Other schools surveyed included: Texas Tech, Colorado State
University, Mississippi State University, University of Florida,
California State University, and Cornell.

   A senior Agriculture Department official says
China's food inflation may be contributing to much of the bloody
turmoil that has centered on Beijing.
   Leo V. Mayer, acting assistant secretary for economics, said the
big purchase of U.S. wheat announced on Monday _ a total of 1.85
million metric tons _ helped reflect ``a sensitivity within China to
this issue (of access to U.S. wheat) and the need for food.''
   Mayer, in an interview aired today by USDA radio, said the big
wheat purchase at U.S. market prices _ even when China still
qualified for grain under the department's price subsidy program _
was ``some indication of their need for additional grain'' during
the current turmoil.
   ``Internally, they've had substantial increases in food prices,''
Mayer said. ``I have had one Chinese specialist tell me that food
prices have gone up 30 to 40 percent in the major cities over the
last 18 months.''
   Mayer speculated that this rise in food prices has helped fan
popular support of the Beijing protesters.

<HEAD>New Research Links ``Bottoms Up'' Drinking With Strokes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Young adults have been the victims of strokes in
recent years after traumatizing one of four main arteries supplying
blood to the brain while performing such simple tasks as brushing
teeth or tossing back a drink.
   A 32-year-old woman recently suffered a stroke after playing a
drinking game in which she tossed back several shots of whiskey,
according to a letter published in today's New England Journal of
Medicine.
   ``It was not only the alcohol but the manner in which she
consumed it,'' said Dr. Richard M. Trosch, a neurology resident at
the Yale University School of Medicine and a co-author of the
article.
   Knocking back a shot of whiskey should be included among a list
of potential stroke-causing ``trivial traumas,'' including old
whiplash injuries, childbirth, heavy lifting and diving into water,
Trosch and his colleagues reported.
   ``We believe that `bottoms up' drinking, as a form of trivial
trauma, caused this young woman's dissection and subsequent
stroke,'' wrote Trosch and his Yale co-authors, Drs. Lawrence M.
Brass and Moshe Hasbani.
   ``Although alcoholic intoxication has been reported as a risk
factor for stroke, the manner in which one chooses to become
intoxicated has not.''
   Trosch said young adults were particularly prone to damaging the
extracranial carotid artery, a major vein through which blood is
pumped from the heart to the brain.
   ``The young are particularly predisposed not only because they
more often play drinking games, but also because their arteries are
a little more taut than older people's and do not stretch,'' Trosch
said in an interview.
   Known risk factors for dissection of the extracranial carotid
artery include fibromuscular dysplasia, hypertension and Erdheim's
cystic medical necrosis.
   The Yale Stroke Program researchers' article suggests many
strokes might also have been caused by ``trivial traumas'' that
frequently go undetected.
   ``Patients may consider such movements insignificant and thus not
recall them, or be too embarrassed to recount them,'' the authors
wrote.

<HEAD>Savings Withdrawal Rate Expected To Continue Falling</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Net withdrawals from the nation's savings
institutions should continue to ease from record high levels as
interest rates decline, economists say.
   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board said Wednesday that S&amp;L
customers withdrew $5.4 billion more than they deposited in April,
down from the records set earlier this year but still high in
historic terms.
   Net withdrawals totaled $8.3 billion in March, $9.2 billion in
February and a record $10.8 billion in January for a total of $33.7
billion so far this year.
   James Barth, the bank board's chief economist, attributed much of
the recent outflow to thrift institutions' failure to keep pace with
rising interest rates offered by competitors such as mutual funds.
   S&amp;L analyst Bert Ely of Alexandria, Va., said S&amp;L reports will
show slower withdrawals or perhaps even a modest gain in deposits in
May and June. Interest rates offered by thrifts historically lag
behind money market funds both on the way up and on the way down.
   ``We have reached the most recent peak in interest rates and now
of course they are trending down. We're seeing a lessening of the
rate-driven shrinkage of deposits,'' Ely said.
   Barth also attributed the shrinkage in April to pressure from
regulators on overextended thrift institutions to shrink. About half
of the decline can be traced to 10 institutions, four of them
insolvent, he said.
   Other analysts, however, say a loss of public confidence in S&amp;Ls
has also played a role.
   Barth said the April figure is better than it at first appears
because withdrawals normally increase in that month because people
pay federal taxes.
   He said outflow was $1.6 billion on a seasonally adjusted basis,
down sharply from $6.7 billion in March and the smallest outflow
since last September.
   Economist Paul Getman of The Wefa Group, a consulting firm in
Bala Cynwyd, Pa., said $5.4 billion is ``still not a great number.''
He noted that Americans are saving more this year _ 5.8 percent of
their income compared with 4.2 percent last year.
   ``So, you've got people saving more but still taking money out of
thrift institutions. That's not a vote of confidence at all,'' he
said.

   If winter wheat farmers are to get any drought
relief aid, it may not be decided until the end of the fiscal year,
Sept. 30.
   During an informal meeting Wednesday with Agriculture Secretary
Clayton Yeutter, Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Patrick
Leahy, D-Vt., said he didn't want to pass legislation that would
have to be revised later.
   ``It seems too early to cover spring planted crops,'' said Leahy
during the meeting which attracted 20 other senators.
   ``We don't known whether such crops are going to be weather
damaged. To act now on spring-planted crops shifts the risk of
production almost totally to the federal government _ I don't think
that is a good idea.''
   Yeutter was critical of a bill passed last month by the House
Agriculture Committee, calling it a ``Christmas tree'' because it
promises relief to many crops other than winter wheat, just in case
weather later in the year damages them.
   ``If we do develop legislative response, it ought to be very
narrowly defined and circumscribed to the people who have been
hurt,'' Yeutter said.
   Yeutter pointed out that rain has been falling steadily in the
past few weeks, even to the point of causing planting delays in some
parts of the country.
   Leahy's committee has not yet acted on any legislation, though a
bill authored by Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan. and one sponsored by Sens.
David Boren, D-Okla., and Robert Kerrey, D-Neb. have been introduced.
   Those measures would extend assistance provided under the 1988
drought relief act to crops planted in 1988 for harvest in 1989 _
mostly winter wheat.
   But Leahy said, ``If you have a winter wheat bill, it becomes the
vehicle for the year,'' and he doesn't want a measure the country
can't afford.
   He said cost estimates for any bill are suspect at this early
date, though damage to winter wheat has been estimated to be about
$1 billion.
   He said he didn't want to give farmers assistance in a bill that
would have to be taken away because of budget restraints.
   But Dole said he didn't see any reason to wait.
   ``I hope we don't have to hold the Midwest hostage until we see
if there are problems in other states,'' he said. He said his bill
is budget neutral, in that it would use deficiency payments being
saved because of higher wheat prices to pay the farmers who are
facing losses.

<TEXT>
   Environmentalists say they hope the selection
of Michael Deland to the president's Council on Environmental
Quality will signal a revival for the advisory panel, which was
largely ignored in the Reagan administration.
   President Bush announced Wednesday he plans to nominate Deland,
regional administrator in New England for the Environmental
Protection Agency, to the three-member council and then make him its
chairman.
   The selection of Deland brought praise from several environmental
groups. He has gained a reputation as a strong enforcer of
environmental laws as the EPA's chief in Boston.
   The council advises the president on environmental matters, but
the panel languished with little money, staff or power during the
eight years of the Reagan administration. President Reagan largely
ignored its members.
   ``Mike Deland is a first rate environmentalist and I think he's
an outstanding choice,'' said Jay Hair, head of the National
Wildlife Federation. ``The bigger question is whether or not the
president will give him both the resources and the respect in order
to revitalize, rebuild and redirect the CEQ.''
   David Gardiner of the Sierra Club said Deland was ``a very strong
environmentalist'' and called his selection ``very much a positive
step'' and that he assumed that Deland ``would not have taken the
job if he had not had some assurances of what the CEQ's authority
would be'' in the White House.
   The council's influence largely will be ``a question of staffing
and money,'' said Gardiner. In the Carter administration the CEQ was
provided with professional staff that could research issues and
brief council members who, in turn, had strong influence on the
president.
   ``Under the Reagan administration they (the staff) vanished,''
said Gardiner. President Reagan had at one time sought to abolish
the council.
   Deland, who has been mentioned as a possible Republican
gubernatorial candidate in Massachusetts, has been director of the
EPA's regional office in Boston since 1983 where he gained a
reputation for aggressively pursuing polluters. He sometimes was at
odds with the agency's Washington headquarters.
   Earlier this year he was mentioned widely as a top prospect to
become head of the EPA in the Bush administration. William K. Reilly
was selected instead.
   During last year's presidential race, Deland added fuel to the
Bush campaign's attack on Democratic opponent Michael Dukakis for
failing as Massachusetts governor to clean up Boston Harbor. But
while Deland criticized Dukakis for delaying the cleanup, he
acknowleged that the federal EPA under the Republican administration
also shared blame. When Bush took reporters on a boatride through
the polluted harbor, Deland refused to go along.
   Deland 47, whose back problems force him usually to rely on a
wheelchair, had occasional clashes with his superiors in Washington
during the Reagan years as well as with then-New Hampshire Gov. John
Sununu, now White House chief of staff.
   He stood his ground against opposition from EPA headquarters and
blocked the development of a shopping mall in Attleboro, Mass.,
arguing the complex would destroy environmentally important
wetlands. He clashed with Sununu over a proposed development in New
Hampshire's Loon Mountain and endorsed a moratorium on development
on Cape Cod.
   Deland is a graduate of Harvard College and Boston College Law
School. He worked for the president of the University of
Massachusetts, on the EPA's legal staff and as a private consultant
before taking the EPA job in Boston.

<HEAD>Gingrich Won't Challenge Convicted Republican's Right To Vote In
House</HEAD>

   Rep. Newt Gingrich of Georgia, who rose to
prominence in the House with his ethics crusades against Democrats,
says he won't challenge a fellow Republican's right to vote in the
House while appealing his conviction for having sex with a teen-age
girl.
   Gingrich, the House Republican whip, said in an interview
Wednesday that Rep. Donald ``Buz'' Lukens, R-Ohio, should not have
to give up his right to vote because his conviction involved a
misdemeanor, not a felony.
   He said the conviction for contributing to the delinquency and
unruliness of a minor is ``a serious offense, but it's a serious
misdemeanor'' which will not cause Lukens to lose any citizenship
rights.
   Lukens faces up to six months in prison and a $1,000 fine for his
conviction.
   ``I think the Lukens case will go to the ethics committee and I
think the Republican Conference will insist on it,'' Gingrich said.
``But I think it is inappropriate for us to impose our judgment on
the courts of Ohio'' and bar Lukens from voting while his conviction
is on appeal.
   Lukens' chief of staff, Bill Jarrell, said the congressman would
have no response to Gingrich's comments.
   ``Congressman Lukens is not going to take out time and react to
every statement that comes down the pike,'' he said. ``He's taking
care of business here on Capitol Hill.''
   Gingrich has insisted since his freshman term in 1980 that any
congressman convicted of a felony should not be permitted to vote in
the House while appealing his conviction.
   He moved to expel then-Rep. Charles Diggs, D-Mich., in 1980 after
he continued to vote following his fraud conviction, and he
threatened similar action against then-Rep. Mario Biaggi, D-N.Y.,
after his 1987 conviction for accepting illegal gratituties. Biaggi
stopped voting after the threat.
   ``The principle in regard to the felony convictions of Biaggi and
Diggs was that if you're convicted of a felony, you lose certain of
your political rights, including the right to vote,'' Gingrich said.
   Gingrich said his decision not to challenge Lukens' right to vote
was not influenced by his frienship with the Ohio congressman, who
was one of the conservative Republicans who joined with Gingrich to
form the Conservative Opportunity Society in the early 1980s.
   He compared Lukens' case to that of Rep. Gerry Studds, D-Mass.,
who along with then-Rep. Daniel Crane, R-Ill., was censured by the
House in 1983 for sexual misconduct with teen-age pages. Studds has
remained in Congress and is now chairman of a House subcommittee.
   Gingrich predicted that Lukens eventually will be punished by the
House, and he suggested that a resolution of censure, such as that
imposed on Studds and Crane, might be appropriate.
   During the 1983 House debate over punishment for Studds and
Crane, however, Gingrich argued that they should be expelled from
Congress.
   ``There is no high school or college in America where exploiting,
seducing or sleeping with students, boy or girl, would be punished
with a reprimand,'' he said in the 1983 debate. ``The teacher would
be fired. Similarly, the two congressmen, like a teacher, must be
fired.''

<HEAD>Senate Panel to Review Medicare's Catastrophic Health Provisions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY ESTILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate, after narrowly rejecting an attempt
to postpone major parts of the new catastrophic health provisions of
Medicare, has ordered a committee review of the program.
   The aim of the Finance Committee review is to consider reducing
the income tax surcharge on the elderly that pays for the new
benefits.
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., fell two votes short Wednesday evening
of attaching an amendment to separate legislation that would have
forced a delay of at least one year in the so-called ``supplemental
premium'' imposed this year on Medicare-eligible individuals to pay
for a package of benefits that start taking effect next January.
   However, McCain also would have pushed back those benefits yet
another year, and opponents argued that his proposal effectively
would have killed major parts of the program approved overwhelming
by Congress last summer. It is the first major expansion of Medicare
since its creation two decades ago.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, seeking to head off the
McCain attempt, introduced a substitute amendment that put the
Senate on record as instructing the Finance Committee to look into
reducing the surtax if it is shown that more money is being
collected than will be needed.
   Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, first raised
that possibility several weeks ago but the administration, as well
as influential House leaders, are on record against any tax rollback.
   In debate on McCain's proposal, Bentsen also pledged to look
closely at ways to exempt from the catastrophic surtax those retired
Americans who have equal coverage under ``Medigap'' policies that
are paid in full or part by their former employers.
   And he said he would renew efforts to attach the catastrophic
coverage to Part B of Medicare, thus making it voluntary. Part B of
Medicare, the section that pays doctor bills, is voluntarily taken
by more than 95 percent of those eligible _ in large part because
the federal government foots the bill for 75 percent of the costs.
   Although members of Congress have been hit by thousands of
letters protesting the new catastrophic program, opponents of the
McCain proposal argued that opponents still represent a tiny
minority of the 32 million people covered by Medicare.
   The idea behind the financing mechanism adopted last year was
that _ with huge budget deficits making it impossible to provide new
government benefits without additional revenue to pay for them _ it
was reasonable to expect that those being offered additional
benefits be required to pay for them.
   Moreover, framers of the program maintained, it was fair for
middle- and upper-income retired Americans to pay a proportionately
larger share of the cost just as the federal tax system in general
is pegged to a percentage of income.
   The catastrophic 15 percent tax surcharge follows that principle,
except the maximum imposed on any individual this year is $800,
regardless of income.
   Opponents of the McCain attempt argued that an estimated 59
percent of the 32 million Medicare beneficaries do not have enough
income to qualify for income tax and would pay only $4 a month for
the additional coverage.
   They cited Congressional Budget Office estimates that 70 percent
of those eligible for Medicare would pay $100 or less a year in
additional surtaxes and that only 5.6 percent in upper income levels
would pay the maximum $800 tax.
   The catastrophic coverage started taking effect Jan. 1 with
unlimited hospitalization coverage after a once-a-year $560
deductible. However, a $1,370 cap on out-of-pocket doctor bills does
not kick in until next year and a new prescription drug benefit
begins a three-year phase-in period in 1991.
   It was those benefits beginning next January that McCain wanted
to delay, along with the surtax imposed to finance them.
   Prior to Jan. 1, Medicare provided full hospital coverage for
only 59 days a year. Medicare pays 80 percent of physician bills
after a $75 annual deductible, but until the new catastrophic
provisions on doctor fees take effect there is no cap on the
patient's share.

<HEAD>House, Senate Face Deep Differences Over Domestic Spending Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House and Senate face pressure to resolve
their differences speedily over a long-delayed spending bill, but
the widest gulf is over one of the hottest political issues: illegal
drugs.
   A bipartisan Senate voiced approval Wednesday for legislation
pouring an extra $3.3 billion this year into veterans, student loan
and other programs. The vote capping lawmakers' fourth day of debate
came more than two months after President Bush asked Congress for a
$2.2 billion version of the bill.
   The House passed its own $3.7 billion measure on May 24 on a
contentious party-line vote. As is usual with spending legislation,
each chamber sprinkled its own bill with provisions boosting
individual lawmakers' favorite projects.
   The biggest difference between the two bills is $822 million the
House included for a host of anti-drug programs. Majority Democrats
there inserted the money into the bill, over veto threats from Bush
administration officials arguing that the spending would further
inflate the deficit.
   The Senate version contains no drug monies. Despite public
opinion polls indicating that illegal drugs is the pre-eminent
domestic problem, Senate Democrats heeded Bush's warnings and joined
Republicans in preventing some legislators from putting drug
spending into the bill.
   Massachusetts Rep. Silvio Conte, ranking Republican on the
Appropriations Committee, said he did not believe it would be
difficult for the two houses to work out their differences over
financing new anti-drug efforts.
   ``I think I can get the White House to compromise on something,''
he told a reporter.
   But one administration official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, insisted Wednesday there was still ``no way'' Bush would
sign the final bill if any drug spending was included. That was also
the conventional wisdom among lawmakers and congressional aides.
   Legislators will be pressed to bargain quickly by many groups
hoping to garner money from the bill, but foremost among them will
be the nation's veterans. In each house's measure, there is $1.2
billion for health care, compensation increases and other programs
for the nation's 27 million veterans.
   There is no disagreement that the coffers of the Department of
Veterans Affairs are running low. The agency has already begun
curtailing medical services, purchases of new equipment and other
efforts.
   The two bills also contain money for the Guaranteed Student Loan
program, forest fire fighting, foster care, refugee assistance,
United Nations peacekeeping and other initiatives.
   Before they can send a compromise bill to Bush for his signature,
lawmakers will have to make trade-offs over whose pet projects
remain in the measure.
   There are many.
   The House bill has provisions directing the Corps of Engineers to
build a road at Saylorville Lake, Iowa; allowing extra money to be
spent on an agriculture research center in Lane, Okla.; and
temporarily blocking development of a laser device in New Mexico as
an anti-satellite weapon.
   The Senate measure provides $75 million to replace a broken
300-foot radio telescope in West Virginia; supplies $7.3 million for
the cleanup of the Alaska oil spill; and urges the government to buy
more apples for the school lunch program.
   On Wednesday, the Senate rejected 51-49 an effort by Sen. John
McCain, R-Ariz., to amend the bill with a provision delaying much of
Medicare's new catastrophic care program for a year.
   Instead, senators agreed to non-binding language promising a
future look at altering the program, which imposes a surtax on the
elderly that some have complained costs them too much.

<HEAD>No Progress in Sight Against Cocaine Production</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A top U.S. drug-control official says efforts
to stem the cocaine trade by eradicating crops in South America will
not produce substantial results for years.
   David Westrate, the Drug Enforcement Administration's assistant
administrator for operations, offered that assessment Wednesday in
testimony before the House narcotics committee.
   ``Escalating coca cultivation and cocaine production in the Andes
has at no time been more critical nor posed as profound a threat to
the United States and its allies,'' Westrate said.
   But while progress is being made in eradication, ``We will not
see substantial effects for years against coca,'' he said.
   Michael M. Skol, deputy assistant secretary of state for
inter-American affairs, said the State Department is considering
``new directions'' in the eradication effort.
   He did not spell them out, but suggested they will be expensive.
   ``Money is a crucial part of the narcotics trade, and
unfortunately in this time of tight budgets, money may be one of the
most effective weapons we can muster for our anti-narcotics
programming,'' he said.
   U.S. policy, he said, must consider ``what happens if and when we
are successful'' in eradicating cocaine production: what will happen
to the peasant farmers earning their livings growing coca, to the
economies of those countries and to the governments that, by wiping
out the cocaine business, will be confronted by an angry populace.
   He said increased economic and military aid will be required.
   Skol said the governments of Peru and Colombia need additional
military assistance because anti-drug officials there are battling
both guerrilla groups and well-armed drug traffickers _ who
occasionally support each other for either economic or geographic
reasons.
   In Peru, Skol said, the Sendero Luminoso, or ``Shining Path,''
guerrillas have virtually taken control of the Upper Huallaga
Valley, a primary source for the world's supply of coca leaf. When
the Peruvian government tries to eradicate the crops there, it winds
up fighting the guerrillas as well, he said.
   U.S. military assistance this year to Peru is $6 million, and the
department has requested $20 million for next year, Skol said.

<HEAD>Nicaragua Was Ready To Send Troops To Panama, Officials Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nicaragua denies a U.S. assertion that it was
prepared to send military units to Panama last month in support of
Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega if the President Bush had attempted to
oust the Panamanian leader by force of arms.
   U.S. officials who spoke only on condition of anonymity made the
assertion Wednesday as the Organization of American States was
meeting in Washington to discuss the situation in Panama.
   A top Nicaraguan official disputed the allegation, saying the
Sandinista government provides political and moral support for
Panama but not military aid.
   The U.S. officials said Nicaragua's Sandinista government was
ready to act in Panama's defense as the Bush administration was
weighing options during the tumultuous post-election period in that
country. U.S. spokesmen at the time were refusing publicly to rule
out any option, including the use of force.
   In the end, Bush decided to send about 2,000 combat troops to
Panama but said the purpose was not to force out Noriega but to
ensure the safety of Americans residing in Panama. Bush concluded
that diplomatic pressure on Noriega was the best course to encourage
a democratic outcome in Panama.
   According to the U.S. officials, Nicaragua also sent Panama a
shipment of Soviet-made weapons as part of the Sandinista commitment
to help Noriega defend his government against possible use of U.S.
military force.
   The officials said the Sandinistas have more than 70,000
personnel under arms, giving them the ability to dispatch troops
beyond their borders without sacrificing self-defense.
   The officials said there appeared to be little doubt that the
Sandinistas were prepared to introduce their own combat troops into
Panama if the need arose.
   Nicaragua has emerged as Panama's strongest hemispheric ally in
the wake of the failed election process in Panama last month. Both
countries see themselves as victims of American military and
economic pressures.
   Asked about the U.S. allegations, Nicaraguan Vice Foreign
Minister Victor Hugo Tinoco said Nicaragua was concerned about the
potential for U.S. intervention in Panama and elsewhere in Central
America, but denied that it sent a shipment of weapons.
   ``We knew there was movement of troops by the U.S. toward Panama
apart from what was announced,'' Tinoco said.
   ``In the face of that situation, Nicaragua felt that there was
the possibility of an intervention in Panama,'' he said.
   ``This possibility, in turn, created the possibility of a
regional conflict and for an intervention in other Central American
countries. Based on an emergency situation, Nicaragua declared a
state of alert for its forces. That's what happened.''
   He said that after a few days, when the U.S. military
intervention did not materialize, the state of alert was withdrawn.
   Tinoco specifically denied that Nicaragua sent arms to Panama and
added that Sandinista authorities have not promised to send troops
to Panama in the event of an American invasion.
   Nicaragua's relationship with Panama is limited to ``moral and
political support,'' he said.

<HEAD>Navy Seeks End to Contractor's Favored Status on Cruise-Missile Engines</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Navy, faced with a declining need for
cruise-missile engines because of arms-reduction treaties, wants to
torpedo a 1978 agreement that requires it to buy 240 of the
components annually from a Michigan company.
   The Navy's determination to end Williams International's favored
position in supplying the engines has prompted intervention by Sen.
Carl Levin, a Michigan Democrat who for years has criticized the
Pentagon for waste and non-competitive procurement practices.
   The Pentagon asserts the agreement with Williams is illegal under
a 1984 law authored by Levin, chairman of the Senate oversight of
government management subcommittee.
   Levin on Wednesday accused the Pentagon of trying to break a
promise out of convenience rather than a concern for the law.
   ``I think it is pure expediency, and it is full out unfair,''
Levin said.
   The outlines of the agreement were contained in correspondence
between Levin and the Navy made public both by the senator and a
Washington-based whistle-blower group, the Project on Military
Procurement.
   The agreement, negotiated because the Navy wanted a second source
of F107 engines for the Tomahawk cruise missile, required Williams,
of Walled Lake, Mich., to license its technology to a competitor,
Teledyne Industries Inc.
   In return, the Navy agreed to buy at least 240 engines a year
from Williams, plus 25 percent of any additional purchases up to
1,200 engines annually.
   The agreement has no expiration date and applies to all
government contracts for F107 engines.
   The Navy must contract through Williams in buying engines from
Teledyne. Williams has been paid about $36,000 for each of the 708
engines built by Teledyne, according to figures provided Levin by
the Navy.
   In a letter to Levin dated April 11, then-Navy Undersecretary H.
Lawrence Garrett III said the agreement violated Levin's amendments
to the Armed Services Procurement Act because it required the
government to buy the engines under contracts not yet negotiated.
   ``No contracting officer has the authority to bind the government
to award future contracts,'' wrote Garrett, who is now secretary of
the Navy.
   From 1990, the Navy plans to award the contracts ``without the
constraints of (the agreement), on the basis of the best value to
the government and the taxpayer,'' Garrett wrote.
   The contract was negotiated by William Parkin, a consultant and a
former Navy employee, Garrett wrote.
   Parkin and the former Navy engineer he bribed were given 26-month
prison terms June 2 for illegally scheming to help two companies get
Pentagon contracts.
   He and Stuart Berlin were each fined $25,000 and ordered to serve
two years of supervised probation after their release from prison.
Parkin pleaded guilty to charges that he bribed Berlin to provide
secret Navy bid information that would help Teledyne and Hazeltine
Corp. of Long Island, N.Y., obtain lucrative contracts to sell
electronic equipment to the Pentagon.
   The Associated Press sought comment from the Navy on the
agreement. The Navy's press office said Wednesday it was unable to
provide information immediately. Both the Navy and Levin's office
confirmed the existence of the Garrett letter.
   Williams vice president for public relations, David Jolivette,
declined to discuss the issue on the advice of counsel, saying the
matter had not yet been resolved.

   Willard Smith, half of the Grammy-winning rap
duo D.J. Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince, was charged with ordering
his bodyguard to attack a record promoter, police said.
   Smith, 20, surrendered Tuesday on charges of assault and
conspiracy, police said.
   Smith's lawyer, Walter Phillips Jr., said they went to detectives
to offer Smith's version of the events.
   ``My client was not involved,'' Phillips said. ``He did not lay a
hand on this individual. It was somebody else that was involved.''
   Smith is the Fresh Prince half of the duo, which won a Grammy
this year for the hit ``Parents Just Don't Understand.'' The duo's
second album was rap's hottest seller at more than a million copies
last year.
   Police said Smith ordered his bodyguard, Charlie Mack, to attack
Philadelphia record promoter William Hendricks, 33, inside the
WDAS-FM studio in March. The attack crushed the area around
Hendrick's left eye, according to police.
   Police were seeking the bodyguard and a warrant for his arrest
was issued last month.

   Actress Cybill Shepherd, out of the detective
business since ABC canceled ``Moonlighting,'' became a
lobbyist-for-the-day in an effort to save two downtown movie palaces.
   The decaying Tower and Palace theaters should be restored and
given landmark status, Miss Shepherd told the city's Cultural

   ``Why should we wait until the bulldozers are outside to stop
it?'' she asked. Miss Shepherd is chairwoman of the Advisory Board

   Designating the theaters as landmarks would prevent demolition
for a year and would give the City Council the power to block
destruction of the old buildings.
   ``People tend to run Los Angeles down, but it's got a marvelous
history,'' the actress said.
   Both structures are owned by Metropolitan Theaters. The Tower
Theater, built in 1927, has been vacant for 18 months and the owners
are considering demolition. The Palace Theater was built in 1911 but
remains in use. There are no plans to demolish it.

   A constitutional squabble broke out this week
when police stopped a speeder but waved him on without a ticket when
they saw it was Crown Prince Harald.
   The palace confirmed Wednesday the heir to the throne was stopped
Monday for driving almost 7 mph above the limit in his luxury BMW
car.
   A statement said he neither asked for special treatment nor spoke
to the police officers.
   The prince's escape from the normal fine of $171 had legal
scholars debating about the constitution in this egalitarian country.
   Under the constitution, only the king can impose fines or
punishment on the royal family. Some experts said stretching royal
immunity to cover traffic fines is going too far.
   State attorney Georg Fredrik Rieber-Moen said police acted
properly because they followed the constitutional guidelines.

<HEAD>Continental Evacuation Flight Turned Back In Apparent Mixup</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: UPDATES thruout with plane to take off again for China after
apparent mixup. No pickup.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An apparent mixup caused a U.S.-chartered flight to
evacuate foreigners from Beijing to be denied permission Thursday to
fly over Chinese airspace and turn back, an official at the U.S.
Embassy said.
   The Continental Airlines DC-10, which left and returned to Naha
Airport on the southern Japanese island of Okinawa, apparently
approached Chinese airspace earlier than agreed upon and was forced
to turn back, the official said.
   ``At 1:20 p.m. (12:20 a.m. EDT) the jet was on the runway
preparing to take off again,'' the official said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   Haruki Yasuda, Continental Airlines' general manager in Tokyo,
said the reason for the refusal for clearance by Shanghai air
controllers was unclear. The embassy spokesman said the jet had been
granted permission to fly through, but had arrived six hours too
early.
   Yasuda said the jet, with a capacity for 284 passengers, was
refueled and parked at Naha until the confusion was cleared up.
   The U.S. Embassy and Continental planned to have passengers board
the plane during a two-hour scheduled stop in Beijing and then
proceed to Narita International Airport outside Tokyo.
   Continental has agreed to fly shuttle flights to Beijing to
assist in the orderly departure of foreign citizens, according to
company spokesman Ned Walker.
   The airline, which does not have regular service out of Beijing,
formed a special operation team to handle the evacuation flights.

   Plans to evacuate Filipinos from
Beijing were thrown into confusion today and it took a private radio
station to unravel the mess by forcing officials to talk by
telephone with harried diplomats in China.
   The sometimes testy conversations, broadcast live by radio DZMM,
were between a foreign affairs undersecretary, an assistant to
President Corazon Aquino, officials of the state-run Philippine
Airlines and Filipino diplomats in Beijing.
   For more than a week, Philippine Charge d'Affaires Ariel Abadilla
and his deputy in Beijing, Corazon Tatarata, said there was no need
to evacuate some 300 Filipinos in the Chinese capital. But
Philippine Airlines and Air Force planes were ready at a moment's
notice, officials said.
   When the decision to evacuate came, arrangements were not in
place. Officials blamed each other.
   The situation ``is very alarming'' Miss Tatarata told the radio
station, and she appealed for PAL to send a plane to Beijing today
instead of Friday.
   Some embassy dependents had to beg for seats aboard a Singapore
Airlines flight because PAL failed to come and fetch them.
   ``You should not blame the department,'' snapped Foreign Affairs
Undersecretary Jose Ingles, clearly angry over insinuations that his
office was not acting urgently enough on messages from Beijing.
   ``We are doing our best,'' Ingles said. He then refused to talk
further with Miss Tatarata, saying he would deal directly only with
Abadilla.
   Ingles then blamed Philippine Airlines, which he said was
imposing unreasonable conditions.
   PAL, according to Ingles, had scheduled an Airbus-300 to fly to
Beijing Friday on condition Chinese authorities guarantee there
would be enough fuel at the airport and that the aircraft, crew and
passengers would be safe.
   ``PAL is imposing conditions over and above the ordinary
obligation of government,'' Ingles said. In the first place, he
added, he could not understand why PAL had canceled its regular
weekly flights to Beijing and other Chinese cities.
   Other national carriers, which had even increased flights to
evacuate their nationals, were flying in and out of the Chinese
capital without any conditions, he noted.
   Nevertheless, Ingles said he instructed Abadilla to obtain those
guarantees from the Chinese foreign ministry ``but up to now, he has
not informed us if these guarantees are forthcoming.''
   In a few moments, a panting Abadilla was on the phone. He said
Chinese authorities had provided the necessary guarantees and that
he had so reported in a telex sent Ingles' department a half hour
earlier.
   DZMM then let Adolfo Azcuna, President Corazon Aquino's legal
adviser and spokesman, speak privately to Ingles and Miss Tatarata
off the air.
   In a few minutes, PAL President Dante Santos came on the line and
said a plane would leave this afternoon for Beijing.
   Problem solved? Not quite. ``We will need 14 visas for our
crew,'' Santos said.

   An anonymous buyer paid a record $3.96 million
for a copy of John James Audubon's masterwork, ``The Birds of
America,'' Sotheby's auction house said.
   Another buyer, identified only as an American dealer, paid a
record $220,000 for an Audubon manuscript at the first of a series
of auctions of the library of H. Bradley Martin, one of the great
book collectors of the 20th century.
   Audubon's five-volume ``Birds of America'' contains 435
hand-colored etched plates of 489 supposed species. The price paid
Tuesday night, which includes the 10 percent house commission,
surpassed the pre-sale estimate of $2 million to $3 million.
   The previous record for the set was $1.93 million paid on Sept.
14, 1987.
   Martin, who died last year at 82, began collecting rare books at
age 18 and kept his books in his New York apartment and at his
Virginia home. He was the grandson of Henry Phipps, arnegie.

   Perhaps the playbills at Victor Borge concerts
should include a prominent notice in heavy black type, something
like ``Warning: Laughing May Be Hazardous To Your Health.''
   Sometimes, the Danish-born musician and humorist becomes alarmed
when he glances over the footlights and sees his audience doubled
up, grimmacing, clenching fists and turning blue with mirth.
   That'sng and starts playing a piano interlude to give everyone a
breather.
   He sa he fears inducing heart attacksr good reason.
   Once, after an uproarious performance in England, Victor Borge
returned to the stage in the silence of the empty theater to savor
his triumph. Peering out at the seats, he noticed a woman sitting
motionless in the 16th row, her eyes closed.
   She had literally died laughing, he observed ruefully.
   Borge may be a Dane, but melancholy he is not.
   ``A smile is the shortest distance between two people, and there
is always room for a smile,'' the 80-year-old entertainer said in a
dressing room interview.
   Borge will be the star attraction at a black-tie gala in his
honor tonight at the 6,800-seat Filene Center atrap Farm Park in the
Virginia countryside about 20 miles west of Washington.
   The benefit concert, which will be taped for broadcast on public
TV stations, will celebrate both Borge's 80th birthday last Jan. 3
and the 18th anniversary of Wolf Trap, the only national park for
the performing arts.
   Borge promised to repeat some of his most beloved comedy
routines, which have delighted millions of people around the world
for the past 60 years. The piano lid will slam shut, the revolving
stool will never quite reach its correct height, sheet music will
fly and soprano Marilyn Mulvey will wait patiently through the
pandemonium for her cues.
   ``I'm ,'' he says, ``because I see humor in any situae funeral of
his father, a longtime viola player with the Royal Danish
Philharmonic Orchestra, when he coaxed a smile from his grieving
mother.
   The caskes borne by his father's fellow musicians, and it was
young Vict who noticed that a short, roly-poly pallbearer wore a
silk hatat was much too small, while a tall, skinny musician's hat
was arge that it covered his ears.
   ``I said that if my father could see this now, he would have died
laughing,'' Borge recalls. ``My mother, distraught as she was at
that moment, smiled. It was the first time she had smiled since my
father died.''
   His mother introduced Borge to the piano when he was 3, and he
quickly gained s a prodigy. But while he was studying with piano
masters in Copenhagen, Vienna and Berlin, he also was clowning in
private musical reviews.
   By his early 20s, he had become a popular film and stage
entertainer _ Denm Hope _ but his satiric barbs at Adolf Hitler and
the Nazi moveent forced him to flee to the United States in 1940. He
became a U.S. citizen in 1948.
   In America, ``I was received with great jubilation by no one,''
he said. ``It was strange to go into a store or a restaurant and
nobody looked at me.''
   Weary of a grueling schedule of musical comedy acts in New York
hotels and movie theaters, he finally scored a breakthrough in 1953
when he mounted a hit one-man show on Broadway. The critics called
him ``one of the funniest people in the world.''
   He has entertained kings, presidents and prime ministers. ``The
first president? It was Lincoln. No, it was a Buick,'' he says. When
he is not touring world stages, he visits his homes in Greenwich,
Conn.; St. Croix in the Virgin Islands and on Portugal's Atlantic
Coast.
   At 80, he feels that ``luck, good fortune and stamina'' keep him
clowning.
   ``I never have to get `up' for a performance,'' he said. ``The
moment I walk on the stage, no matter what my mood, if I have any
regrets or feel sick or in pain, all that disappears. That is when
the climax of my day occurs.''

<HEAD>Marcos Still Critical, But In Less Pain</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONOLULU (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos
remained in very critical condition, but his pain and fever subsided
after emergency surgery for an abdominal infection, a hospital
spokesman said.
   The 71-year-old exiled leader underwent three hours of
exploratory surgery Tuesday during which doctors discovered and
drained an abscess on his pancreas.
   The abscess was suspected as a major source of the infection that
has plagued Marcos for several weeks, but doctors said they could
not be certain it was the only source.
   ``There was some response to the treatment and the pain and the
fever appear to have decreased,'' Eugene Tiwanak, assistant
administrator of St. Francis Medical Center, said Wednesday.
   Marcos has been hospitalized since January and has been listed in
very critical condition since May 18, when he suffered heart, kidney
and lung failure. He remains on a respirator to assist his breathing
and undergoes blood dialysis four times a week, Tiwanak said.
   Despite his ailments, Marcos makes his own decisions about his
treatment and approved Tuesday's surgery, said his aide, Arturo
Aruiza.
   ``Just because he can't talk, he can't breathe, doesn't mean he
can't think,'' said Aruiza.
   Meanwhile, Marcos' wife, Imelda, planned to stick to her schedule
and sing her husband's favorite love songs at a reception Sunday, a
family spokesman said. The gathering is to promote an album
featuring the former first lady and Philippine vocalist Imelda Papin.
   ``She's still planning to be there, and she is planning to sing.
After all, they're his favorite songs,'' said spokesman Gemmo
Trinidad.
   Marcos has lived in exile in Hawaii since being ousted in a
popular revolt that carried Corazon Aquino to the Philippine
presidency in February 1986.
   He and his wife are under U.S. indictment for allegedly stealing
more than $100 million from the Philippine treasury and using it to
buy real estate and art works in the United States.
   Because of Marcos' illness, a federal judge in New York City
severed him from the case, and he will not be prosecuted unless he
recovers.
   No trial date has been set for Mrs. Marcos, who pleaded innocent
to the charges and is free on $5 million bail.

   The dollar moved up against the Japanese yen in
Tokyo Thursday, while stock prices gained moderately.
   The dollar closed at 143.05 yen, up 0.25 yen from Wednesday's
close of 142.80 yen. After opening higher at 142.98 yen, the U.S.
currency ranged between 142.73 and 143.10 yen during the day.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues, which rose 174.88 points Wednesday, added another
91.40 points, or 0.27 percent, closing at 33,718.29.
   Traders said Japanese investors' incentive to buy dollars was
weaker Thursday because of reports that the U.S. Federal Reserve
Board lowered its federal funds rate, a short-term interest rate.
   But Japan's central bank reportedly said it should keep a close
watch on the Fed's move to see if the decision really reflected a
U.S. policy toward easier money.
   Many investors still feel secure enough to invest in the dollar,
and bought the currency due to uncertainties over the Chinese
situation, said one dealer with a commercial bank in Tokyo speaking
on condition of anonymity.
   On the stock exchange, dealers said the index's rise followed
gains in the Dow Jones industrial average in New York overnight,
although trading was still directionless due to remaining
uncertainties over China.
   Nomura Securities' analyst Masahiro Umemori said, however, that
news about the Chinese turmoil has a less negative impact on Tokyo
trading than previously.
   ``Japanese investors have little feeling of insecurity about
developments in China. Plus, the foreign exchange rates have also
become stabilized and made market players feel reassured,'' he added.

<HEAD>Researchers Report Progress Toward AIDS Vaccine</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MONTREAL (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first AIDS vaccine tested in the United
States on humans triggered their immune systems into action, raising
hopes that one vaccine may protect against many forms of the AIDS
virus, researchers said.
   One top U.S. researcher said he is optimistic enough to recommend
wide testing of the vaccine.
   ``We are making progress, and I think we will be able to make a
vaccine eventually,'' said Dr. Clifford H. Lane, head of AIDS
vaccine testing at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious
Diseases.
   Despite the encouraging results reported Wednesday, many
important questions remain about whether this _ or any _ vaccine can
keep people from catching AIDS.
   Similar vaccines have failed to prevent AIDS virus infections in
chimpanzees.
   The vaccine is a synthetic copy of the outer coat of HIV, the
virus that causes AIDS in humans. The goal of such vaccines is to
warn the body's immune defenses about what the AIDS virus looks
like. Then, if all goes well, the body's sentinel blood cells will
quickly zero in on the virus and kill the invader if it somehow gets
into the bloodstream.
   The initial human testing of this approach, carried out on 115
homosexual men who were not infected with AIDS, was intended
primarily to see if the vaccine is safe.
   However, Lane said he will recommend that the next stage of
testing be started to see if the vaccine actually protects people
from AIDS infection. In the comparison study, a large group of
people at risk of AIDS but not infected would randomly be given
either the vaccine or dummy injections.
   In the study, those who received the vaccine produced
microbe-attacking T-cells that recognized different strains of the
AIDS virus, Lane said. Since the virus has mutated into many related
forms, some doctors have worried that a vaccine that works against
one variety of the virus might be useless against others.
   Lane's report was one of several on potential vaccine strategies
presented at the week-long Fifth International Conference on AIDS.
   Lane said he did not think the men in the initial study received
large enough doses of the vaccine to produce neutralizing
antibodies, probes produced by another branch of the immune system _
the so-called B-cells _ that target viruses for destruction.
   Many researchers believe that for a vaccine to work, it will have
to trigger the production of such neutralizing antibodies. In
another report, Dr. Scott D. Putney of Repligen, a biotechnology
firm in Cambridge, Mass., said his group had identified the single
tiny region of the virus' outer coat that can prompt these killing
antibodies.
   He and some other scientists believe that small fragments, rather
than the whole coat, have a better chance of serving as a vaccine.
And while not sure that it will work, he said, ``I'm certainly more
optimistic than I was a year ago.''
   Other researchers are exploring a variety of other vaccine
strategies, including using killed whole viruses, harmless viruses
that carry an extra gene or two from the AIDS virus or synthetic
antibodies.
   Scientists are trying many different possibilities because they
do not know which immune defense has the best chance of beating the
virus.
   ``There are no known cases of recovery from AIDS, so we have no
idea of the immune parameters that are important,'' said Dr. Marc
Girard of the Pasteur Institute in Paris.
   Some researchers are trying to create a vaccine that will protect
monkeys from a simian version of the AIDS virus. They believe this
will give them important clues that can easily be adapted to a human
AIDS vaccine.
   Researchers from the University of California, Davis, reported
that while a vaccine made from inactivated virus failed to keep
monkeys from getting infected, it seemed to slow down their disease
so they lived longer.
   At the New England Regional Primate Center, researchers
vaccinated monkeys with weakened virus with somewhat different
results. While four got infected, two did not, suggesting that the
vaccine might have provided at least some protection.
   A French doctor also is reported to have tested at least one
vaccine on humans.

<HEAD>Agriculture Officials Hunting for Four Missing, Hissing Roaches</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   State agriculture officials are hunting for
four hissing mouse-sized cockroaches that were set free by their
owner and could breed and spread.
   Chloe Riley, manager of the Critter Shop pet store, said a
customer said he dumped the Madagascar hissing roaches in his
backyard, fearing the state would jail him and confiscate the
insects.
   ``He came in and said: `Man, I was scared. I let them loose. I
was afraid they'd put me in jail,''' she said Wednesday. ``He said
he didn't want the (Florida) Department of Agriculture to hurt
them.''
   Ms. Riley would not disclose the identity of the Tampa resident,
not even to state agricultural agents.
   The Department of Agriculture last week ordered the Critter Shop
to stop selling the roaches, fearing if they got free, they might
multiply across the South like the flying Asian cockroach.
   When the Asian cockroach was first discovered in 1985 spreading
through central and south Florida, scientists found 250,000 Asian
cockroaches per acre, said Phil Koelher, an entomologist with the
University of Florida.
   The Madagascar roaches, which can live up to five years compared
to the German cockroaches' six-month lifespan, are bred by zoos and
distributed by wholesalers as food for certain reptiles and monkeys.
   The exotic pet store got a shipment of 12 in January, sold six
during the first four months, and the rest in two days after word
got out they were trendy, cheap to feed and easy to maintain.

<HEAD>Tieless Teacher's Suspension Thrown Out By Court</HEAD>

   A math teacher fired for failing to wear
a tie to class has been vindicated in court, but could face the same
problem next year if a school board decides to ban denim and require
neckwear.
   ``If they're smart, they'll quit while they're behind. Otherwise,
they'll get farther behind,'' said Bill Webb, who was suspended for
insubordination three times and finally fired last December.
   Judge Charlie King said Wednesday the Mason County Board of
Education erred when it suspended the 46-year-old Webb. King said a
dress policy drafted by the superintendent last year was improperly
imposed and Webb had every right to ignore it.
   But under the judge's order, a similar dress code can be put into
effect by the school board. Board member Harry Siders, who
introduced the motion to fire Webb last Dec. 19, said the matter
would come up at the board's meeting June 19.
   ``If they go on and say they'll ban any fabric made of denim, I
won't go back,'' said Webb, a Gallipolis, Ohio, farmer who had
taught across the Ohio River at Point Pleasant High School for 19
years.
   Webb was hit with three suspensions of four, 11 and 30 days, the
last two without pay, for challenging Superintendent Charles
Chambers' requirement that male teachers wear dress pants and
neckties.
   After he was fired, he returned to Ohio to run his farm full
time. While other teachers were preparing to give final exams, he
was planting corn, Webb said in a telephone interview on his way to
a Chicago appearance on today's ``Oprah Winfrey Show.''
   King ordered the board to give Webb back pay for his 11-day
suspension and up to $1,000 in legal costs. Webb didn't challenge
the four-day suspension because he was paid.
   The 30-day suspension and firing still are to be addressed, but
Webb's wife and lawyer believe King's action undermines the board's
argument.
   ``If they couldn't suspend him, they sure as hell couldn't fire
him,'' Julie Webb said.
   Mason County school board president Emma Kearns was in New York
and couldn't be reached, according to someone who answered the phone
at her Point Pleasant home. A reporter was unable to reach Chambers
and board attorney Diane Johnson, whose phone numbers were unlisted.
   Webb said he wore suits and sportcoats early in his teaching
career to distinguish himself from his students, but later opted for
the blue jeans and cotton shirts he wore around his farm.
   Chambers became superintendent last summer and enacted the dress
code. Three other teachers who balked at the code followed normal
grievance procedures and lost.
   King said Webb and the others had a right to disobey the order,
which was unlawful because it was unilaterally imposed by the
superintendent.

   President Bush and top Republicans say a press
aide was solely responsible for the GOP memo comparing House Speaker
Thomas S. Foley's voting record with that of a homosexual
congressman, but Democrats aren't buying it.
   ``One staffer can't take the fall for an entire Republican
political operation that's up to its knees in sewer-style
politics,'' said Ron Brown, chairman of the Democratic National
Committee.
   Mark Goodin, communications director of the Republican National
Committee, resigned Wednesday and took full blame for a memo
comparing Foley's voting record to that of liberal Rep. Barney
Frank, D-Mass. The memo was titled: ``Tom Foley: Out of the Liberal
Closet.''
   Goodin, who worked in the press operation of Bush's 1988
campaign, said in resigning that he never intended ``to damage
anyone's reputaion.'' He said RNC Chairman Lee Atwater, who was
President Bush's campaign manager, never knew of the document.
   The White House put out word that Bush was ``disgusted by this
entire incident,'' and top Republicans on Capitol Hill hurried to
distance themselves from it.
   ``The president was very upset,'' White House chief of staff John
Sununu said in an interview reported today in The New York Times.
``I was upset. It went too far. It was wrong. The innuendo was
wrong. It's wrong not because it damages our relationship with the
Democrats. It's wrong because it's wrong.
   ``It's a terrible thing to happen at this time. It was not
appropriate or fair,'' said Sununu, who said he and Bush had rebuked
Atwater.
   Foley, who had lunch with Bush, said he accepted an apology from
Atwater and considered the matter ``closed.'' And, in an interview,
he spoke of working to give Republicans fairer treatment in the
House.
   But other Democrats said Goodin alone could not be responsible
for a pattern of Republican smears, which Democrats contend began
during the presidential campaign and have continued with misleading
Justice Department leaks about Democrats.
   ``I think it's fair to ask President Bush if he'll also have his
handpicked party chairman, Lee Atwater, resign,'' Brown said. ``The
president himself has to be accountable for the activities of his
henchman.''
   Rep. Tony Coelho of California, the second-ranking House
Democrat, accused Republicans of ``playing good cop, bad cop'' _
allowing Bush to appear clean at the same time they were trashing
Foley.
   ``Here's a guy sent in by Bush to do the dirty deeds, and he
calls and apologizes after the fact. If they're really upset about
these tactics, all they have to do is fire somebody,'' he said.
   ``The Democrats in the House are truly bitter about the way this
thing happened on Tom Foley's first day as speaker.'' said Rep.
Beryl Anthony, D-Ark., chairman of the Democratic Congressional
Campaign Committee.
   The Foley hit was part of a ``well-concocted strategy and I think
it's one that has backfired because they overplayed their hand,''
Anthony said.
   He said it is time for the Republicans to clean house at their
campaign organization.
   ``Tom Foley's not been damaged. If anything, he's been
strengthened,'' Anthony said.
   Republican leaders on Capitol Hill expressed dismay about the
memo from their party organization.
   ``I was very distressed and rankled,'' said House Minority Leader
Bob Michel, R-Ill.
   ``I would guess this is a rather deliberate effort on the part of
some to smear Tom Foley,'' said Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole,
R-Kan. ``This is garbage. We're disgusted by it.''
   Foley, trying to end the political rancor in the House, was
intent on maintaining a conciliatory tone toward the Republicans and
declined to discuss the memo.
   In an interview, he promised to avoid the kind of strongarm
parliamentary moves that angered Republicans under his predecessor,
Jim Wright.
   ``I think we've pushed it sometimes to the point where, while we
were still within the rules, we were making maximum use of the power
of the majority,'' Foley said. ``I don't think we should do that.''

<HEAD>Dollar Gains In Tokyo</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar gained against the Japanese yen in Tokyo
today, while stock prices rose moderately despite continuing
uncertainties in China.
   The dollar ended trading at 143.10 yen, up 0.25 yen from
Wednesday's 142.80-yen finish. After opening higher at 142.98 yen,
the U.S. currency ranged between 142.73 and 143.10 yen.
   Masafumi Koyama with the Bank of Tokyo said dollar-buying
incentives were stronger than selling incentives, despite an
expectation that the United States may ease its monetary policy.
   ``Recent developments in China have a stronger impact, because
speculation over a relaxation of U.S. monetary policy has been an
issue for quite a while and is no longer fresh news,'' he said.
   Theoretically, he said, the market could shift to dollar selling
because of the narrowing interest-rate gap between Japan and the
United States.
   ``But investors are still buying the dollar, which shows how
strong their demand for the U.S. currency is,'' Koyama said.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average
closed the day at 33,718.29, gaining 91.40 points, or 0.27 percent.
The index rose 174.88 points the previous day.
   Stocks moved higher almost across the board.
   Dealers attributed the gains to an uptrend begun the previous
day, as well as to overnight rises on overseas markets.
   Kazuyuki Suzuki, a dealer with Daiwa Securities in Tokyo, said
the Nikkei gained despite turmoil in China mainly because Japanese
investors' buying interest was strong.
   ``Trading was thin and directionless because of the uncertainties
in China, but many investors bought cheaper issues following the
four consecutive days of losses which ended Tuesday,'' he said.
   Other dealers said the market's expectation that the United
States would relax its monetary policy also prompted buying. Low
interest rates are generally good news for stock investors.
   The volume traded on the market's first section was estimated at
650 million shares, up from Wednesday's 600 million. Among the
winners were construction and automobile issues.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The pace of borrowing slowed sharply in April
as Americans took out $2.73 billion more in debt than they retired,
the government says.
   Consumer credit in April rose 4.7 percent on a seasonally
adjusted annual rate, down from 6.4 percent in March and 9.5 percent
in February, the Federal Reserve said Wednesday.
   It was the slowest advance since a 3.5 percent gain last
September. It also represented a sharp retreat from the 8.5 percent
rise in consumer debt during all of 1988.
   Economists said the news was consistent with other signs that
economic growth is slowing as the record peacetime expansion extends
into its seventh year.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A drug to help treat severe cases of
Parkinson's disease, a degenerative disorder of the central nervous
system, has been approved for public use.
   The drug, selegiline, will be part of the standard therapy for
Parkinson's, which uses another drug, levodopa, to treat the
symptoms that include slowness of movement, muscular rigidity,
instability and tremors.
   Levodopa, after several years of use, often decreases in
effectiveness, even with increased doses, said the Food and Drug
Administration.
   The drug is aimed at the 20,000 to 50,000 people, most of whom
are over 40, with severe Parkinson's. The drug previously was
available to the most severely ill while the company making the drug
continued to gather data on its effectiveness.
   Scientists believe Parkinson's results from reduced levels in the
brain of dopamine, a naturally produced substance that helps
regulate movement.

   Legislation ordering the disclosure of Federal

according to Martha R. Seger, one of the seven governors of the Fed,
who testified Wednesday before a Senate Banking subcommittee.
   The 1977 law rates banks, savings and loan institutions, and

<HEAD>Thailand Says China Turmoil May Affect Cambodia Issue</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-China, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thailand is concerned that the turmoil
in China may delay the settlement of the Cambodian conflict, a
Foreign Ministry official said today.
   China is a principal player in Cambodia as the main backer of the
Khmer Rouge, the strongest of the three-party guerrilla coalition
opposing the pro-Vietnamese government in Phnom Penh.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Jete Sucharitkhul said the Thai
government was ``very concerned'' about developments in Beijing,
where pro-democracy protests since mid-April escalated until troops
shot to death hundreds of people last weekend.
   ``Usually the (Chinese) government follows the party line, if
there is a power struggle you can imagine that they will be very
busy internally and not be able to pay as much attention to the
(Cambodian) issue as they have in the past,'' he said.
   But Jete said he did not think that apparant divisions in the
Chinese leadership would change China's policy on Cambodia.
   ``I don't think there will be a shift, just that they will be
able to pay less attention to the issue. But nobody can tell at the
moment as we don't know the extent of the infighting,'' he said.
   Recent peace talks have brought the various Cambodia factions
closer to a solution to the 10-year war. Vietnam, which invaded
Cambodia in 1978, has pledged to withdraw all its troops stationed
there by Sept. 30.
   But the major stumbling block to a peace settlement has been the
Khmer Rouge, who were ousted from power by the Vietnamese invasion.
   The Khmer Rouge killed as many as 1 million Cambodians from 1975
to 1978 as it violently tried to turn the country into a radical
agrarian commune.
   Recent peace talks have focused on whether the Khmer Rouge should
be allowed to participate in a future coalition government.
   The Khmer Rouge announced last week that Pol Pot, the man who
presided over their rule, wished to resign his last official post in
the organization.
   Diplomats dismissed the move as a ploy to present a more
acceptable face in future negotiations. The government in Phnom Penh
has insisted that Pol Pot and other leaders be removed before the
Khmer Rouge is allowed any share of power.
   There are unconfirmed reports from Western diplomats in Bangkok
that the shadowy leader, believed to be in his early 60's, is
currently in Beijing for medical treatment.

   On American ground, some wept and shook with stories of a
massacre left behind.
   At the San Francisco International Airport, student Lauren
Collins said he decided to return home after a truckload of soldiers
aimed machine guns at him on a street in Beijing.
   ``The whole situation is just horrible chaos, and it scares me to
think of anyone not being able to get out, much less the Chinese who
obviously must stay,'' said Collins, of Worcester, Mass. He shook as
he recalled Wednesday ducking when soldiers aimed at him and several
others. No shots were fired.
   Hundreds of Americans arrived home as armed clashes and
government instability in China prompted the U.S. Embassy to
evacuate dependents of staff members. Busloads of foreigners today
rushed to the Beijing airport in hopes of catching emergency
flights. The U.S. government has chartered flights from two airlines.
   Meanwhile, across the United States, Chinese students held
demonstrations in support of their brethren at home, officials
denounced the killings, tourists canceled trips to China, and a new
hot line in Massachusetts continued the formidible task of locating
missing kin.
   And eyewitnesses told their stories.
   Greg Brubaker, of Hermosa Beach, Calif., said at the San
Francisco airport that he spent a night with pro-democracy
demonstrators in their tent city in Tiananmen Square before the
massacre.
   ``I saw one all by himself try to stop a tank rolling over a
barricade; just him against the might of the big army!'' said
Brubaker, who went to Beijing only a month ago to study the Chinese
language.
   Tears streaming down her cheeks, Wang Yan of the Chinese city of
Nanking arrived in San Francisco to attend school in the United
States.
   ``I think the students try hard to make life better for us all,''
she said. ``Why did they have to die?''
   Jill Suitor and Scott Feld of Setauket, N.Y., called Feld's
mother from Tokyo and told how they arrived in Japan tired, dirty,
and without their luggage after 25 hours in line at the Beijing
airport.
   The couple, both professors, were detained and beaten by Army
troops as they were taking photographs Sunday a few blocks from
Tiananmen Square, where soldiers killed or wounded thousands of
people to crush a pro-democracy movement.
   Many were overjoyed to be home.
   ``Detroit never seemed so beautiful,'' Dr. William Mays said as
he walked out of customs at Detroit Metropolitan Airport Wednesday.
He was one of 29 members of the American College of Physician
Executives who were in China for an exchange of medical and
technical ideas.
   The bloodshed continued to inspire angry reactions across the
United States on Wednesday.
   The presidents of 15 American universities wrote to a chief
educator in China to formally denounce the killing of students and
call for an end of violence in Beijing.
   Derek Bok, president of Harvard University, organized the written
protest of the universities, many of which have large numbers of
Chinese students.
   Idaho Gov. Cecil Andrus suspended a sister-state trade and
cultural agreement with China's Shanxi province, saying it was a
signal of ``complete abhorrence of the brutal and unnecessary
military intervention against the Chinese people.''
   Chinese students carrying banners saying ``Stop Bloodshed'' and
``Long Live Freedom'' marched through downtown Norfolk, Va.
   About 200 people rallied in the rain at the Oklahoma Capitol, and
Iowa's political leaders joined Chinese students at a rally that
drew about 300 people in Des Moines.

<HEAD>Colorado Health Department Cites Rocky Flats For 25 Violations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JULIA RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A plant that makes triggers for nuclear bombs was
slapped with 25 state health violations the day after federal agents
launched an inquiry into illegal dumping and burning of hazardous
wastes at the facility.
   The state's action Wednesday against the Rocky Flats nuclear
plant was independent of the federal investigation and the timing of
the two announcements was ``coincidence,'' said Tom Looby, assistant
director of the Colorado Department of Health.
   The state accused the Department of Energy and Rockwell
International Corp., which operates Rocky Flats for DOE, of
improperly storing wastes, failing to monitor groundwater adequately
and storing hazardous wastes in leaking drums.
   ``The violations involved raised some serious questions in our
mind about the overall ability of the Department of Energy and
Rockwell to manage the plant,'' said Looby.
   Rockwell International spokesman Ed Heintz said he had not seen
the health department allegations.
   ``But I would be surprised if there are any new violations and it
is just a matter of interpretation whether or not the deficiencies
are cleared up or in the process of being cleared up,'' Heintz said.
   The plant 16 miles northwest of Denver makes plutonium triggers
for nuclear bombs.
   Agents from the FBI, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and
DOE carried out search warrants there Wednesday for the second day
in a row.
   The Justice Department said plant employees allegedly concealed
contamination and illegally treated, stored and disposed of
hazardous and radioactive waste.
   Looby said the state's order included a total of 24 citations for
violation of rules for monitoring hazardous waste in groundwater;
unapproved storage of hazardous and mixed wastes; leaking hazardous
waste drums; inadequate record-keeping and personnel training, and
failure to maintain proper aisle space in waste storage areas.
   ``No individual instance is a terribly nasty violation,'' said
Dave Shelton, director of the health department's Hazardous
Materials and Waste Management Division.
   ``The concern is that in the aggregate, it shows that the
facility has a good deal of difficulty in managing its hazardous
waste ... in order to stay in compliance with state standards,''
Shelton said.
   The order gives DOE and Rockwell 10 days to request a meeting to
discuss the order. The state then has a month to finalize the order
and to set a compliance deadline for each violation. The maximum
penalty for noncompliance is $25,000 per violation per day,
officials said.
   Rocky Flats has been dogged by safety and environmental problems
since it began operations in 1953, but particularly in recent years.
   Last year, the Energy Department identified it as the most
environmentally hazardous site in the nuclear weapons industry
because toxic chemicals contaminate an underground reservoir and
threaten nearby city water supplies.
   In October, the agency closed Rocky Flats' main plutonium
reprocessing building for safety violations. Two months later, the
agency reported 32 new safety problems at the plant.
   The Energy Department has announced plans to close Rocky Flats in
the next 20 years in a consolidation of America's nuclear weapons
plants.
   In a previous federal probe of a nuclear weapons complex in 1986,
the EPA examined Energy Department handling of hazardous waste at
its Hanford, Wash., reservation. No criminal prosecution resulted.

   The jogger who was raped, beaten and left for
dead in Central Park was moved to a Connecticut rehabilitation
center following an emotional farewell from the hospital staff.
   ``We all came to feel involved in a way we normally don't as
professionals,'' said Dr. Robert Kurtz, who has treated the
28-year-old victim since her arrival at the hospital early on April
20.
   Kurtz told reporters Wednesday that two recent incidents
demonstrated the woman's increasing awareness of the unusual
circumstances around her case: She was ``floored'' by 18 roses sent
by Frank Sinatra, and surprised by a visit from her boss.
   The victim, an investment banker, was in a coma and close to
death after she was attacked by a gang of youths cruising the park,
authorities said. She was on life-support systems for more than a
week after the assault.
   ``To all of us, the degree of improvement this young woman
manifested in recent weeks has been truly remarkable,'' said Kurtz.
   Six teen-agers have been indicted in the attack.
   The woman will stay in a 16-bed traumatic brain injury unit at
the Gaylord Rehabilitation Center in Wallingford, said spokesman
Laurie Ann Brass.
   Gaylord is a 121-bed facility that specializes in short-term
rehabilitation and is affiliated with the Yale University School of
Medicine. It is located about six miles from New Haven on a 500-acre
site.

<HEAD>Defendants Plead Guilty in `Clamscam'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Five defendants pleaded guilty to reduced charges
and agreed to pay more than $300,000 in penalties in a
million-dollar clam theft case, leaving only the accused
``Clamscam'' kingpin still on trial.
   The plea bargain came six weeks into the complex trial of one of
the state's biggest white-collar crime cases ever. The agreement
also resulted in the dropping of charges against a sixth defendant.
   King County Superior Court Judge Steven Scott last week urged
both sides to negotiate a plea bargain to reduce time and costs.
Without the agreement, lawyers had predicted a trial of at least
three months, followed by trials in three other counties.
   ``We've saved the taxpayers lots of money in court time,'' said
Patrick Sainsbury, chief of the King County prosecutor's fraud
division. ``While you never get everything you want, we've
accomplished some of our goals.''
   The trial was set to resume today for Brian D. Hodgson, 50,
former president of the now-defunct Washington King Clam Inc. He
faces multiple felony charges of stealing at least $1.8 million of
geoducks, a type of giant clam, by underreporting harvests from
state clam beds and encouraging divers to go outside legal clamming
areas.
   Hodgson has blamed any illegal harvesting on divers acting on
their own and claims he took fewer clams from Puget Sound and Hood
Canal than he was entitled to under state leases.
   The geoduck, pronounced ``gooey-duck'' after an Indian word for
``dig deep,'' weighs as much as 10 pounds and is raised mainly for
export to Japan, where it can fetch $12 a pound. The industry began
in 1970.
   Under the agreement, the five defendants pleaded guilty without
admitting any wrongdoing, a so-called Alford plea.
   The only defendant to be sentenced Wednesday was Roger W. Hondle,
42, of Tacoma, who entered a modified guilty plea to misdemeanor
theft. He was given 30 days in jail or on work release, put on a
year's probation and fined $500.
   Mark E. Pearce, 37, of Olympia, pleaded guilty to felony charges
of conspiracy, theft and trafficking in stolen property.
   Richard Myers, 33, of Auburn, pleaded guilty to theft and
trafficking in stolen property; Carol K. Kondo, 58, of Federal Way,
and her company, T.C. Foods Inc., pleaded guilty to trafficking in
stolen property.
   Their sentencing was postponed to an unspecified date. The
stiffest recommended sentence was one year in prison, one year of
probation and $12,500 in fines for Pearce.
   Kondo and Pearce could have faced life prison terms had they been
convicted on the original charges of leading an organized crime
operation in marketing geoducks.
   The agreement also resolved civil proceedings in the case. Kondo
agreed to pay $275,000 in civil damages and Myers agreed to forfeit
his boat or pay its value in damages. A value was not specified.
   Pearce, Myers and Kondo also agreed to stay out of the state's
fishing industry for three years.
   Criminal charges against Kondo's daughter, Cindy L. Rommel, 29,
of Puyallup, were dismissed, but she was ordered to pay $25,000 in
damages.

   Larger than the average lobbyist, two cows called
on the Statehouse with a group of concerned dairy farmers who
demanded higher prices for milk in Massachusetts.
   Dairy cows Jersey and Simon Kat quietly chewed their cuds while
two dozen farmers and their supporters rallied on the Statehouse
steps Tuesday.
   The farmers said high land prices were pushing them out of
business and threatening the state's dwindling dairy industry. A
proposal in the state Legislature would increase milk prices 2 cents
per quart, and the money would be distributed back to state dairy
farmers.
   ``It's either pay now or pay more later,'' said Dave Patterson of
the 2,200-member Agri-Mark, New England's largest dairy cooperative.
``It's not a tax, it's a rate hike.''
   The farmers argue that at $2.12 per gallon on average, the price
of milk in Massachusetts is lower than the national average.
   According to the state agriculture department, there were 3,000
dairy farms in Massachusetts in 1960 and only 460 active farms
today. Production dropped from 800 million pounds of milk in 1985 to
about 470 million pounds last year.

   Some couples prefer non-traditional wedding
gifts, but a man planning to tie the knot Saturday revealed more
than his taste in presents when he appeared nude in the July issue
of Playgirl magazine.
   In an interview accompanying the photo spread, Benny Graham
called it ``a great wedding gift to ourselves.''
   Graham, 27, appears in the magazine as winner of the ``1989 Make
Your Boyfriend a Centerfold'' contest. He was entered in the
competition by his fiancee, Kristy French.
   Neither was eager to comment about the honor Wednesday.
   ``We're just kind of going crazy around here with the wedding
coming in a couple days,'' Graham said. ``I'd rather wait until
after the wedding to talk about it.
   In the Playgirl interview, Graham said he was ``a little nervous
about posing nude, but I got over it and then I couldn't wait to do
it.''
   Graham, now employed by a plumbing and heating company, formerly
was owner of a fitness center. His fiancee is a second-grade teacher.

<HEAD>Aquarium's Whale Exhibit Harpooned by Canadians</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Canadian government has blocked efforts by
Chicago's Shedd Aquarium to buy three beluga whales from Eskimos
near Hudson Bay, officials say.
   The aquarium had planned to buy the whales this summer for its
$43 million ``Oceanarium,'' a marine mammal pavilion due to be
opened next year.
   But under pressure from environmentalists, the Ottawa government
blocked the deal. Canadian officials gave no reason, but promised to
explain their denial by next week, said aquarium spokeswoman Betsy
Raymond.
   However, an unidentified official of the Canadian Ministry of
Fisheries and Oceans told the Chicago Tribune that his agency
doesn't think the Chicago aquarium has experts on its staff who know
how to care for belugas.
   He also expressed concern that the aquarium's new addition
wouldn't be ready by the time the belugas were to be captured.
   But Shedd's assistant director, David Lonsdale, said the aquarium
does have qualified staff members to care for the whales, who would
have been housed outside Chicago until the Oceanarium is finished.
   Barry Kent MacKay, wildlife coordinator for the Toronto Humane
Society, hailed the ministry's decision.
   ``It's a tradition for the (Eskimos) to kill belugas and eat
them, but it's not a tradition for them to sell them to the Shedd
Aquarium,'' he said.
   But Shedd officials contend the best way to educate the public
about the need to protect whales is to display them in aquariums.
   Beluga whales are not considered an endangered species, and under
Canadian law, MacKay said, Eskimos near Hudson Bay are allowed to
exercise their native hunting rights to capture a half dozen or so
whales each summer.
   Beluga whales are 10 to 15 feet long and resemble dolphins.
   Ms. Raymond said the aquarium will acquire three much larger and
more plentiful Pacific black whales for the new pavilion.

<HEAD>HUD Audit: Village Officials Gave Preferential Treatment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Officials in a predominately white Long Island
village that is home to U.S. Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato, distributed
federally subsidized homes to politically connected people and
excluded blacks, according to a report published today.
   One person who received such preferential treatment was D'Amato's
cousin, Anthony Ciccimarro, who was selected to buy a $40,000 HUD
house in Island Park, The New York Times reported, citing a 1984
audit by the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development.
   D'Amato was supervisor of the town of Hempstead, which includes
Island Park, at the time and was elected to the U.S. Senate shortly
thereafter, the Times said.
   D'Amato denied any favoritism was involved, and said he had no
role in the selection process, the Times said.
   ``There's no reason to believe anything was inappropriate,'' said
a statement released by D'Amato's office.
   Preferential treatment also was accorded to Geraldine McGann, a
village board member and high-ranking HUD administrator, whose son,
Daniel, received a $44,500 house, the Times said, citing the audit.
   Mrs. McGann, a friend of D'Amato, also denied any favoritism took
place.
   Under a federal program to build affordable housing for
minorities, Nassau County in the early 1980s received money to build
285 houses for lower-income families.
   Island Park, population 4,200 and 97 percent white, received
enough money to build 44 homes to be sold at $40,000 to $64,000. HUD
proposed that 17 of the 22 houses to be built during the project's
second phase be sold to blacks from nearby areas, but none were.
   Twelve of the 44 HUD houses have since been resold at large
profit; one went for $270,000, the Times said.
   The audit did not say whether those selected for the HUD houses
met the program's eligibility requirements. The buyers included the
niece of the village clerk, the niece of a village trustee, two
village supervisors, a lawyer who is soon to become a village
justice and the daughter of a village employee, the Times said.
   The HUD houses were supposed to be advertised in local newspapers
to reach lower-income buyers, especially minorities.
   But some residents were tipped off, and by the time the ads
appeared, 22 buyers had been selected, the Times said.
   The 1984 audit recommended disciplinary action against Mrs.
McGann and the village, but neither was penalized.
   Mrs. McGann last year was promoted to regional HUD administrator
after D'Amato lobbied Congress and the White House on her behalf,
the Times said.
   A copy of the audit was mailed anonymously to the Times, which
said it then requested and received a copy from HUD to verify its
authenticity.
   ``This program was a mockery,'' said Jeff Pless, who did the
audit and later quit in disgust that no action was taken. ``It took
everyone's tax money and gave it to the people who didn't need it.''

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   High winds and a tornado ripped through southeast Louisiana early
today, tearing down trees and power lines and demolishing a brick
home, as menacing thunderstorms rumbled through the South.
   Thunderstorms accompanied by damaging winds and torrential rains
hit northeast Texas, across Louisiana, and into southern Mississippi
on Wednesday night and early today.
   In central Louisiana, a tornado struck Marksville early today,
destroying a brick home and injuring a woman trapped inside. High
winds toppled a chimney and downed trees in eastern Baton Rouge
Parish.
   The thunderstorms also brought heavy rain across portions of
northern Louisiana. Homes and streets in Bossier City were flooded
when more than 5{ inches of rain fell in three hours.
   In Texas, four people were injured Wednesday night when a twister
destroyed several homes in Gary on the Texas-Louisiana border.
   ``We heard the noise and decided to get out of the house,'' said
mobile home resident Mark White. ``We were sitting in the car on the
highway, looking back, and saw trees flying in the air and our
trailer rolling along _ over and over.''
   Western and central Nevada also were hit by strong thunderstorms
Wednesday afternoon. A tornado touched down near Carson City. Reno
was pelted by 1-inch sized hail. Heavy rain flooded streets in Reno
and produced a mud slide that closed a highway near Hawthorne.
   Other showers and thunderstorms moved ahead of cold front from
eastern Kansas into northeast Iowa. An upper air disturbance
triggered showers and thunderstorms across much of New England.
Showers were widely scattered from northern California into central
Colorado.
   Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms from the
lower Mississippi Valley across the Gulf coastal states to the mid
and south Atlantic coastal states; severe thunderstorms from eastern
Mississippi across Alabama and Georgia into western South Carolina;
showers and thunderstorms in the Great Lakes region; scattered
showers and thunderstorms over eastern Texas, the upper Mississippi
Valley and much of the Plateau; widely scattered thunderstorms over
the mountains and eastern sections of Colorado; and showers over New
England and eastern New York.
   Temperatures were forecast in the 60s over eastern New England
and North Dakota; in the 50s and 60s over the upper Great Lakes and
Minnesota; in the 90s from south Texas across southern Arizona to
interior sections of central and southern California; between 100
and 105 over parts of the lower Rio Grande Valley and southeast
California; and in the 70s and 80s throughout the rest of the nation.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 40
degrees at Williston, N.D., and Duluth, Minn., to 87 degrees at
Phoenix, Ariz.

   Assailants shot a Palestinian man to death on
his hospital bed today in the occupied West Bank, and Arab reports
claimed he collaborated with Israel.
   Another suspected collaborator was shot and seriously wounded in
a separate incident, the reports said.
   In the occupied Gaza Strip, soldiers sealed the homes of three
Palestinians accused of throwing firebombs at troops.
   An 18-year-old Palestinian also was reported wounded in the leg
in a clash with troops in Jebaliya in Gaza.
   The fatal attack occurred in Rafidiyeh Hospital in the West Bank
town of Nablus, where Taleb Yamin, 55, had been convalescing from
injuries suffered 10 days earlier in a clubbing and stabbing attack
in Nablus' old city, two hospital doctors said.
   ``A group of people entered the hospital at 5 a.m. They forced a
male nurse and a relative to leave the room. Then they opened fire,
killing him instantly,'' Rafidiyeh's director, Abdel Rahman Shinar,
said in a telephone interview.
   Another doctor, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Yamin
was shot once in the head.
   The army confirmed the slaying and said police were investigating.
   Yamin was the 49th Palestinian slain by other Palestinians since
the Palestinian uprising began. Most have been accused of helping
Israeli authorities or dealing in drugs and prostitution.
   A total of 510 Palestinians have been killed in the 18-month
rebellion against Israeli rule, most in clashes with Israeli
soldiers. Twenty-two Israelis also have died in the unrest.
   The second shooting also occurred in Nablus. Arab assailants shot
Fayel Fawalha, 48, seriously wounding him in the head, Arab reports
said.
   Fawalha was reportedly evacuated by an Israeli helicopter after
being treated by soldiers at the scene.
   The army confirmed the man was shot and said troops had closed
off Nablus.
   The shootings came a day after a 30-year-old man was hacked to
death in Nablus with a hatchet and his naked body chained to an
electric pole.
   Arab reporters said he was a collaborator. The army suggested the
motive for Wednesday's slaying was criminal.
   Vice President Dan Quayle was quoted by the daily Jerusalem Post
today as urging that Israel put a halt to announcing new settlement
building in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   ``The announcements of new settlements are politically
problematic even if they (Israeli leaders) don't go through with
it,'' Quayle noted.
   Israel has built some 130 settlements, as homes for 70,000 Jews
who live among 1.7 million Palestinians in the occupied lands.
   The United States has frequently criticized the settlements as an
obstacle to peace. ``It's something that I wish there was a
sensitivity to this,'' said Quayle.
   He said the settlement issue gave critics of Israel ``fodder for
the cannon fire, and believe me, they want to unload on Israel.''
   ``It makes it more problematic for those of us who are strong
defenders'' of Israel, Quayle added.
   A new public opinion survey, meanwhile, showed 53 percent of
Israelis would object to dismantling the settlements as part of a
peace agreement.
   Forty-two percent of 579 of the Israelis interviewed this week by
the Dahaf Institute said they favored removing the settlements, the
Yediot Ahronot daily reported. No margin of error for the poll was
given.
   Troops maintained a curfew for a fifth day on the Gaza Strip,
confining more than 700,000 residents to their homes indefinitely.
   The restrictions were lifted for two hours in the town of Khan
Yunis so residents could purchase food.
   The homes sealed shut were in Gaza's Jabaliya refugee camp. One
belonged to Ibrahim Arrar, 24, and housed his wife and one child,
Arab reports said. The other suspects were not immediately
identified.
   The army said the three Palestinians were suspected firebomb
assailants and also accused them of belonging to the outlawed Fatah
guerrilla faction of the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   In a communique, the army said the Palestinians were accused of
throwing several firebombs at Israeli troops during April.
   ``They are also suspected of additional activity including
threats on those who work in Israel, placing roadblocks and tire
burnings,'' it said.
   On Wednesday soldiers demolished the homes of two Palestinians in
Gaza who were convicted of firebomb attacks on Israeli soldiers.
   Israel claims that house wreckings and sealings are an effective
deterrent against attacks.

<HEAD>Football Game Canceled By Kennedy Assassination Finally Played</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HOLDEN LEWIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>EL PASO, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 25 years after their game was
canceled because of President Kennedy's assassination, alumni from
two rival high schools took to the gridiron to complete their last
football season.
   Bowie and Jefferson high schools have long had the hottest
scholastic rivalry in El Paso. On the morning of Nov. 22, 1963, the
schools were holding pep rallies and preparing to cap their seasons
with the annual double homecoming. But an assassin's bullet in
Dallas prompted officials to cancel the game.
   ``If you beat Jefferson, that was it. That was your season _
nothing else mattered,'' said Felipe Peralta, who played wide
receiver as a Bowie senior in 1963 and coached Wednesday night's
game.
   ``I think at the time most of us thought it was important to play
the game. You don't actually complete your high-school season when
you can't play your main rival.''
   Alumni from the schools settled the score Wednesday night with a
spirited game of seven-man touch football before 400 spectators at
Bowie Stadium. The home team won, 20-8.
   The contest wasn't pretty. The Bowie Bears threw bombs on almost
every play and the Jefferson Silver Foxes threw so many laterals
that it resembled a volleyball game. But that didn't bother the
players.
   ``It was a lot of fun,'' said Bowie's Rudy Molinar. ``It was just
friends against friends.''
   The contest brought back memories of that fateful day.
   ``I was excited,'' Jefferson alumnus Oscar Gomez recalled about
the week leading to the canceled 1963 game. ``Then our dear
president passed away, which was terrible. It was nice to get to
play again.''
   ``The whole country was down because of the shooting, but we were
down because of the game,'' said Gomez' teammate, Manny Florez.
``It's a game you look forward to all year.''
   Or look forward to for a quarter century. Alumni from both
schools had talked for years about playing the canceled game. Last
week, Bowie's Class of '64 _ which is celebrating its 25th reunion
this week _ decided to stage the game. Those who took part were glad
they did.
   ``There was a piece missing from our lives when we didn't get to
play that game,'' Peralta said.

   The U.S. dollar was mostly firmer in quiet European
trading today. Gold prices were little changed.
   Foreign currency dealers said the market was waiting for Friday's
scheduled release of the U.S. producer price index for May.
   They said they're expecting a quiet day, with little movement in
either direction. Next week's release of U.s. merchandise trade data
for the first quarter is also adding to the market's caution, they
said.
   ``It's very quiet today,'' said a trader at Deutsche Bank in
Frankfurt. ``There's almost no turnover. Everyone's waiting for the
numbers from the U.S.''
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 0.25 yen to a closing 143.05 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted at 142.95 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Wednesday:
   _1.9730 West German marks, up from 1.9610
   _1.7100 Swiss francs, up from 1.6965
   _6.6962 French francs, up from 6.6600

   _1,437.50 Italian lire, down from 1,441.00
   _1.1968 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1967
   In London, the dollar rose against the British pound. It cost
$1.5753 to buy one pound, compared with $1.5815 late Wednesday.
   Gold opened in London at $375 a troy ounce, down from late
Wednesday's $375.65. At midmorning, the city's five major bullion
dealers fixed a recommended price of $374.60.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $374.50, unchanged from late
Wednesday.
   Silver was quoted in London at $5.45 a troy ounce, up from
Wednesday's $5.38.

<TEXT>
   Books that advocate Nazism and question
whether the Holocaust occurred were on sale last week at state Rep.
David Duke's house, says a researcher concerned that fellow
legislators are not challenging Duke.
   ``No one is speaking out against the ideas of David Duke. He has
not changed his views even though he says he has,'' Elizabeth
Rickey, a Tulane University graduate student and member of the
Republican State Central Committee, said Wednesday.
   Duke, a former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan, was elected to
the state legislature from a nearly all-white district in February.
He still heads the National Association for the Advancement of White
People, which promotes the civil rights of whites. His house serves
as headquarters for the organization.
   Rickey said she was upset that some Louisiana Republicans had
accepted Duke.
   ``They honestly don't know what to do with him,'' she said.
``They think if you ignore him, he'll go away.''
   Rickey said she and other researchers purchased anti-Jewish and
extremist material from Duke's house in Metairie as recently as
Saturday.
   Among the materials Rickey said she bought were:
   _ ``The Turner Diaries,'' described as the bible of the Order, a
white supremacist organization founded by members of the National
Alliance and the Aryan Nations.
   _ ``Imperium,'' which argues for the preservation of Western
culture through the practice of Nazi racist policies.
   _ ``Did Six Million Really Die? The Truth at Last,'' which argues
that the Holocaust was grossly exaggerated to gain sympathy for a
Jewish homeland.
   Also available were books on breeding a master race, Rickey said.
   Duke denied that he was selling the books. Asked how Rickey and
her associates could buy them, he said, ``It might have been some
old stock.''
   ``This is nothing new,'' Duke said. ``I've sold a wide range of
books. I think people have a right to read all points of view.''

   The new head of the Presbyterian Church
(U.S.A.) said a ``spiritual reawakening'' would help reverse
declining membership as the church enters its third century.
   ``I really think a new day is dawning,'' said the Rev. Joan
SalmonCampbell, 51, of Philadelphia, after she was elected moderator
Wednesday at the church's 201st General Assembly. She defeated two
challengers.
   The church's chief spokesperson made it clear her main goal is to
spread the word of God.
   ``We need a spiritual reawakening, and I think we are on the
brink of it,'' she told a reporter.
   Known locally as ``Rev. Joan,'' she is the second black
clergywoman from Philadelphia to gain a national religious post
recently. Earlier this year Barbara Harris became associate bishop
of the Episcopal Church in Massachusetts.
   ``I'm proud of my sister and I'm proud to stand with her,'' Mrs.
SalmonCampbell said. ``We are both leaders of our churches
particularly at a time when our denominations are under such fire
and criticism. Clergywomen bring a unique perspective to the
church.''
   In becoming moderator _ the seventh woman in the church to win
the post since 1971, and the first clergywoman _ she received 303 of
the 603 second ballot votes to defeat the Rev. James Johnson, of
Columbus, Ga., and the Rev. William Skinner, of Sioux City, Iowa.
   Her first official act was to appoint a vice moderator, the Rev.
Herb Meza, pastor of the Fort Caroline Presbyterian Church,
Jacksonville, Fla., who had formally placed her name in nomination.
   With church membership now below 3 million, or around 25 percent
less than it was in the 1960s, she said a top priority was to bring
new worshipers to the 11,573 Presbyterian churches around the
country. She said she would help raise $15 million for an evangelism
drive.
   ``The church must present a religious message, a message of
clarity as to who we are as Presbyterians. We must neither be bland
nor dull. The church should speak out as to how Christ would speak.
We must talk more about Jesus,'' she said.

   Gunmen killed a leading witness in a robbery trial
after shooting two of his friends while they waited for him to come
home.
   Investigators said Steve Curtis, 29, and Daniel Michael Smith,
38, arrived at Curtis' house late Tuesday and were met by at least
two gunmen, who shot the two in the head after ordering them to lie
on the living room floor.
   The gunmen ransacked the house and at one point made a telephone
call and complained that ``he'' hadn't arrived, police said.
   Frank James Magnuson, 22, who was Curtis' roommate, returned home
some hours later and was killed as he walked toward the back door,
police said.
   The account of the events was provided by Curtis, who was shot in
the head and arm but survived. He called police after the gunmen
left the house and was placed under police guard after being treated
for his wounds.
   Magnuson was to have testified Wednesday in the kidnapping and
robbery trial of Roger Lee Young, charged in a September 1988 attack
on a waitress in the parking lot of a restaurant.
   On Wednesday, prosecutor David Olivas asked Judge Warren Martin
to postpone Young's trial. Martin scheduled a new trial for Sept. 11
and allowed Young's lawyer, William Fritsche, to withdraw.
   Magnuson, who was a busboy at the restaurant, fought with one of
the two men who robbed the waitress.
   Young was arrested and charged in the crime a short time later.
Police have failed to identify any other suspects.

<HEAD>Judge Assesses More Than $1,000 For Marital Status Discrimination</HEAD>

   A landlord who agreed to rent a house to an
unmarried couple and then reneged, citing his Christian values, has
been ordered to pay more than $1,000 in damages and penalties.
   A judge refused to treble the damages, however, as the law
allows, because he said the landlord acted out of ``sincerely held
religious beliefs.''
   Administrative law Judge Peter Erickson ruled Wednesday that
Layle French must pay $368.50 in compensatory damages and $400 for
mental anguish to Susan Parsons Jenson, as well as $300 in civil
penalties to the state.
   The judge ruled in March that French violated a state law
prohibiting discrimination based on marital status by refusing to
rent a house to Jenson and her then-fiance.
   French ``reflected upon his action prior to engaging in the
discriminatory conduct and weighed his duties under the law against
his religious beliefs,'' Erickson said.
   French's argument that the discrimination statute should take a
back seat to his Christian values had attracted wide support in
Minnesota and elsewhere in the country. French is a member of the
Marshall Evangelical Free Church.
   His attorney, James Anderson, said Wednesday he plans to take the
case to the state Court of Appeals.
   Anderson said he is ``saddened about a man who is fighting a
trend, and that is a general moral decay of the country, and the
state has seen fit not to promote what he's doing but rather to
promote the moral decay.''
   Anderson said he was especially distressed at the civil penalty
because he claimed French was upholding the state law banning
fornication. He said he had not been able to reach French to inform
him of the ruling.
   Erickson noted in his decision that when French first agreed to
rent to Jenson and her then-fiance on Feb. 22, 1988, he knew that
the couple was not married. Two days later, Erickson noted, French
called Jenson ``and informed her that he could not rent the property
to her because cohabitation by two adults of the opposite sex was
not in accord with his religious beliefs.''
   By that time, Jenson had given up her rental mobile home. She
later married her fiance.

   A man who went looking for his estranged
wife in violation of a court order shot and killed three people at a
dairy farm, then turned the gun on himself after failing to find
her, police said.
   The killer, Kenneth Gehring, died at a hospital a few hours after
the shootings Wednesday.
   The victims were the couple who owned the farm, Nellie Rutheda
LaCrosse and Tom LaCrosse, both 63, and Kirby Hull, 43, a dairy
truck driver.
   Gehring's wife, Eileen May Gehring, was visiting the farm Tuesday
evening when her husband arrived and drove off in her car. Deputies
arrived and drove the woman to her apartment in nearby Puyallup,
said Capt. Steve Poythress of the Pierce County sheriff's department.
   Gehring, apparently believing his wife was still at the house,
arrived the next morning armed with a .22-caliber rifle. He shot
Hull, who had arrived to pick up a load of milk, then went into the
house and shot and killed the LaCrosse couple.
   He then shot himself in the head, said Sgt. Prentis Hunsinger of
the Pierce County sheriff's department.
   Friends and authorities said the LaCrosses did not know Gehring.
   Gehring, a 35-year-old sawyer at a local wood mill, was under a
court order to stay away from his wife of 18 years. Mrs. Gehring had
told authorities that her husband was threatening to kill her.
   Neighbors said the LaCrosses had operated the 400-cow dairy for
23 years and were well-known in the rural community south of Tacoma.
   ``They were such good neighbors, they would help anyone,'' said
Laura Schelbert, who lived across from the LaCrosse farm for 20
years. ``When we had a sick animal, he would come out and help us.
...This couple has touched a lot of lives.''
   Hull left a wife and four children, authorities said.
   ``This type of thing is unheard of in our rural community. You
try to look for reasons,'' said Marilyn Rasmussen, a state
representative and dairy farmer.

   HOPEDALE, Ohio (AP ) _ Come home, Clark Gable. All is forgiven.
   Twenty-nine years after his death, the ``King of Hollywood'' has
finally won back the hearts of those who live in his hometown.
   Gable _ at least his legend _ will be the guest of honor this
weekend as Harrison County and some stars of ``Gone With the Wind''
commemorate the film's 50th anniversary by re-enacting the famous
Twelve Oaks barbecue scene and attending a screening of a restored
version of the movie.
   The 850 residents of this eastern Ohio village, where Gable was
born Feb. 1, 1901, haven't always regarded him as a favorite son.
The gawky, gap-toothed, big-eared boy never returned to the county
after he moved about 80 miles northwest to Akron in 1917.
   ``Most folks around here were angry because he never came back,''
said Michael Cope, president of the Clark Gable Foundation. ``But
recently, we're seeing a real turnaround. There is no longer any of
that resentment we felt even after we started honoring him on his
birthday in 1984.''
   Frances Jackson, an 86-year-old Hopedale native, said she has
forgiven Gable for never returning. She has become a local celebrity
herself because she once rejected Gable's request for a birthday
kiss.
   ``He said `This is my 16th birthday. Do you want to be the first
one to kiss me?' I said, no I did not,'' Mrs. Jackson said.
   ``He had a real way with the girls. Oh, he had lots and lots of
girlfriends. But not me,'' she said, smiling. ``My father would have
killed me.''
   Harrison County has been celebrating Gable's birthday each year
since 1984, hoping that fascination with the actor and his films
will give a boost to an economy hurt by a decline in coal mining,
said Cope, who also is county treasurer. The county's unemployment
rate was 10.8 percent in April.
   Other famous native sons simply don't have the drawing power.
   John Bingham, credited as the author of the 14th Amendment to the
Constitution, was born in Cadiz, 10 miles southwest of Hopedale. And
Gen. George Custer is better know for his last stand at Little
Bighorn than his first breath in New Rumley, about 10 miles to the
northwest.
   A granite monument honoring Gable was erected in 1986 at the site
of his home in Cadiz, where his family moved when he was a child. By
coincidence, the house was razed in 1960 _ the year Gable died.
   The Gable Foundation hopes to raise enough money through special
events and corporate donations to build and operate a museum-theater
to display Gable memorabilia and show his films.
   The three-day commemoration of the film's golden anniversary
begins Friday with an auction of memorabilia at the Alameda Inn, a
roadhouse-turned-restaurant that Gable was believed to have
frequented in his younger days.
   Items to be sold include an original program from the movie's
1939 premiere, a sepia movie still of Gable and Vivien Leigh as
Rhett Butler and Scarlett O'Hara, and a first-issue postage stamp
honoring Margaret Mitchell, author of ``Gone With the Wind,'' signed
by Olivia de Havilland, who portrayed the long-suffering Melanie
Wilkes.
   On Saturday, residents and stars from the movie _ including Fred
Crane, who played one of the Tarleton twins _ will don Civil War-era
attire to re-enact the barbecue scene at an American Legion hall.
   Also during the weekend, Crane and other stars will be asked to
leave hand imprints and signatures in cement. They include Butterfly
McQueen, who played Prissy, the maid; Cammie King Conlon, who
portrayed Bonnie Blue, the ill-fated daughter of Rhett and Scarlett;
and Patrick Curtis, who appeared in the film as an infant.
   Cope said Danny Selznick, son of the film's producer, David O.
Selznick, plans an appearance.
   The reunion of the stars ends Sunday with a showing of a restored
print of the film in Wheeling, W.Va., 25 miles to the southeast.

   A planeload of Americans arrived on a special
evacuation flight today from chaotic Beijing with stories of friends
and children slain in the Chinese capital and gunshots punctuating
their escape to the airport.
   Some were greeted in Japan by relieved and tearful relatives, and
staff member from the U.S. Embassy and United Airlines helped some
evacuees who had no money with loans or tickets on credit.
   ``So many children were killed,'' said Terese James, 24, of
Liberty City, Texas, after arriving with 320 people on the United
Airlines jumbo jet that had been chartered by the U.S. State
Department.
   She said she had been teaching at the Forestry University in
northern Beijing, and saw many victims of the assault by Chinese
troops on pro-democracy demonstrators in Tiananmen Square.
   ``One couple bicycled from Tiananmen 10 kilometers back to the
university with their 7-year-old child, who died. They were running
away, and they mowed them down.''
   Similar stories were being told around the world as thousands of
foreigners left Beijing on regular flights and special planes
arranged by foreign governments.
   Ms. James said she had to lie flat on the floor of the car taking
her to the airport Monday because there was shooting, and then had
to wait almost four days to get a flight.
   The United charter flight's load of 320 people included 30
employees of Occidental Petroleum who escaped from a coal mine in
central China, some dependents of U.S. diplomats and a few people of
other nationalities.
   Most were to fly on to the United States immediately.
   ``It was dreadful,'' said the wife of a U.S. diplomat who asked
that her name not be used. ``We had friends who died. We used to go
out every night to the square to talk to the people there, and we
even brought our kids. Nobody expected to be mowed down.''
   Ms. James said it was getting ``pretty dangerous for Americans''
in Beijing because authorities were blaming the turmoil on ``Western
influence.''
   At her university, she said students piled up bodies of victims
inside the gates to keep soldiers out of the campus, and she had
heard that soldiers stripped some bodies of identification and
burned them.
   In Britain, evacuee Amanda Ling, 21, said she had been in
Tiananmen when the massacre began. She said she saw a crowd drag
away two policemen and people enraged by the shooting trying to
destroy army vehicles.
   ``I got really scared. Someone came rushing toward me and said,
`Go and look for yourself, the Chinese are shooting the Chinese.' It
was horrible. I just didn't want to see people dying,'' she said.
   Ms. Ling, a Leeds University student who had been at Beijing
Foreign Studies University, said British Embassy officials had given
British students 10 minutes to pack.
   Her evacuation flight landed today at Gatwick airport outside
London.
   ``I regret leaving the Chinese people behind to that vicious
government, that awful government. All I want to say is that the
whole world has got to know that that government is capable of doing
that.''
   Richard Haugen said at first he wanted to stay and endure the
unrest that has wracked China since mid-April.
   Then came the weekend massacre in Beijing, and his Chinese
friends told him their acquaintances and relatives were among the
dead.
   ``It was just short of being a madhouse. Stores are all closed.
... People aren't staying in their houses ... they're milling around
on the street trying to find out what's going on,'' the 25-year-old
from Camano Island, Wash., said Wednesday after his arrival in
Seattle.
   ``I saw a soldier's body, burned, hanging from the bridge. That
made me get the hell out of there,'' Australian tourist Jimie Reid
said in Hong Kong. He said people told him the soldier had killed
children and women.
   ``We were shot at by the tanks at the Peking Hotel doorway. They
were shooting at anything that moved,'' said Yves Robert, a French
tour guide, after arriving in Paris with a group of 40 tourists.
   The United States and other nations stepped up specially arranged
flights to evacuate terrified foreigners from Beijing after they
strongly urged their citizens to leave the Chinese capital.
   Japan and Australia reportedly extended their evacuation orders
today to include the industrial port of Shanghai, China's largest
city, because of growing tension there.

   Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto of Pakistan ended
talks with President Bush and other U.S. officials after winning a
commitment for new F-16 fighter sales and promising not to provoke a
regional arms race by producing nuclear weapons.
   She made the promise in an address Wednesday to a joint meeting
of Congress in which she urged the United States to work
aggressively for a broad-based political settlement in Afghanistan
and said that Pakistan's fledgling democracy deserves continued U.S.
military and economic assistance.
   Ms. Bhutto, a 1974 graduate of Harvard University, was attending
Harvard's commencement ceremonies today and addressing members of
the Harvard Alumni Association.
   On Friday she is scheduled to meet with officials of the United
Nations in New York before leaving the United States on Saturday.
   The F-16 sale, said to be worth $1.4 billion, will give Pakistan
a total 100 of the sophisticated warplanes.
   The New York Times reported in today's editions that unidentified
Pakistani officials said Ms. Bhutto had urged the United States to
try to persuade the Soviet Union to accept the departure of Afghan
President Najib from office, with whom the guerrillas have refused
to negotiate, as a step that could lead to negotiations.
   During her visit, Ms. Bhutto and Secretary of State James A.
Baker III witnessed the signing of agreements providing for $465
million to help Pakistan finance housing, narcotics and education
programs.
   The agreements are part of a $2.28 billion, six-year aid package
designed to support Pakistan's economic development, according to
the Agency for International Development. Pakistan is the third
largest recipient of U.S. aid.
   Pakistanis are grateful for such assistance, the prime minister
told Congress, because ``your military assistance has helped
maintain a relative balance in the region. It has contributed to
Pakistan's sense of security.''
   The prime minister's address was repeatedly interrupted by
applause, especially when she addressed long-standing U.S. concerns
that Pakistan is on the verge of acquiring nuclear arms.
   ``Speaking for Pakistan, I can declare that we do not possess nor
do we intend to make a nuclear device; that is our policy,'' she
said.
   ``We are committed to a regional approach to the nuclear problem
and we remain ready to accept any safeguards, inspection and
verification that are applied on a non-discriminatory regional
basis,'' she said.
   Ms. Bhutto said Pakistan has long advocated creating a nuclear
weapons-free zone in south Asia and added: ``A first step in that
direction could be a nuclear test-ban agreement between Pakistan and
its neighbors. ... We are prepared for any negotiation to prevent
the proliferation of nuclear weapons in our region.
   ``We will not provoke a nuclear arms race in the subcontinent,''
she said.
   The prime minister mentioned no other country by name. But
Pakistan's regional rival, India, which detonated a nuclear device
some 15 years ago, has resisted agreeing to test-ban and nuclear
weapons-free zones unless such arrangements also include China, a
nuclear-weapons state.

<HEAD>Court Upholds Firing of Producer Who Aired Mayor Impersonator</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An appeals court has upheld the firing of a radio
station producer for airing an impersonation of then-Mayor Kevin
White in 1982.
   The state court said that the incident ``was not exactly `The War
of the Worlds''' but that WRKO-AM had every right to fire Paul
Yovino for inviting an impersonator on air to take calls from the
audience as ``His Honor.''
   ``He pretended to be the mayor, although greatly exaggerating the
mannerisms of the persona of the real mayor,'' Judge Rudolph Kass
said Wednesday. ``Broad as the caricature may have been, the
impersonator induced a flurry of phone calls to City Hall in which
the callers made unflattering observations about what the `mayor'
was saying on the air.''
   Upholding a lower-court ruling, the judge said Yovino's failure
to ensure that the audience knew the ``mayor'' was an impersonator
amounted to a serious error.

   A blizzard of $20 bills on a highway
stopped rush-hour traffic cold and sorely tempted a man who returned
$440,000 after staring for hours at a 45-pound sack of cash on his
kitchen table.
   More than $500,000 fell out the back of a Loomis Armored Inc.
truck about 9 a.m. Wednesday on Interstate 10 near downtown, police
said. One sack broke, and $20 bills littered the four-lane highway.
   FBI spokesman Terry Kincaid said at least $100,000 was still
missing.
   ``With the turbulence of the traffic, the money was flying in the
air like a Toyota commercial,'' said police shift supervisor Hank
DiMatteo. He said at least 20 motorists stopped to grab cash,
causing a half-mile traffic jam.
   Rudy Vega grabbed a canvas sack of money, threw it in his car and
drove home, where he stacked the cash on the table and counted it.
   He turned in the money to the FBI five hours later.
   ``It was $440,000, and I said this was too much money,'' Vega
said. ``My conscience would have really bothered me.''
   Others weren't quite so honest. Police charged two men with theft
for allegedly grabbing $3,840. In addition, police got license plate
numbers of about 20 other suspected cash-grabbers and planned to
pursue them.
   ``This is an education in greed in people,'' Campos said.
   Police said the driver of the truck apparently didn't secure the
back doors before setting out from the Federal Reserve Bank in El
Paso to the one in Dallas.

   Hundreds of foreigners rushed to Beijing's
international airport today to board hastily arranged flights and
evacuate the tense capital.
   Airlines from Denmark, Japan, the Philippines, Switzerland and
the United States dispatched jetliners to carry out citizens
unnerved by the carnage and random shooting by troops roaming the
city.
   About 270 Americans left Beijing's Capital Airport aboard a
special United Airlines flight for Shanghai, where another 130 were
to board and then head to Tokyo.
   ``I was at the Beijing Hotel Monday watching people get shot all
day and that was enough,'' said an American student from he Bejing
Foreign Language Institute who watched troops, their rifles blazing,
charge repeatedly at crowds of bystanders.
   ``After being at Tiananmen that night and watching them shooting
and shooting and shooting, I reached my threshold for destruction,''
said the student, who was waiting for a Dragonair flight to Hong
Kong before making his way back to New Jersey. He asked not to be
identified.
   A Continental Airlines jetliner that was turned away from Chinese
airspace on a flight from Japan earlier today departed again for
Beijing after receiving permission from Chinese authorities, an
airline official said in Tokyo.
   People's Liberation Army soldiers stormed thousands of
pro-democracy protesters in Tiananmen Square over the weekend,
killing hundreds in the most violent suppression of a popular
movement in communist China's 40-year history.
   On Wednesday, soldiers fired on a diplomatic compound, and the
State Department in Washington ordered diplomatic dependents at the
U.S. Embassy and all non-essential personnel to leave China.
Officials also urged all other Americans to leave.
   ``We've taken an awful lot of moves to improve our security, and
the biggest one was putting those people on that plane and pulling
them out of town,'' U.S. Ambassador James Lilley told reporters at
the airport.
   ``We're watching things very closely. We think there are enough
signs of difficulties that we'd better take care of our people and
get them out fast.'' Dozens of cars and buses plastered with the
flags of Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, Sweden and the United
States made their way along the picturesque, tree-lined route to the
airport.
   The Spanish ambassador's black Mercedes Benz pulled up to the
terminal near the American ambassador's navy-blue Cadillac.
   About 1,000 people crowded the dusty departure terminal amid
tearful embraces and anxious passengers hoping to get a ticket out.
The Bank of China office was jammed with people changing money, and
the snack bar above the lobby was nearly full.
   Five planes from Japan Airlines and All Nippon Airways, including
two emergency JAL flights and one from ANA, had flown 1,170
passengers to Tokyo today, said Japanese Embassy spokesman Shigekazu
Sato. Another ANA jet was to take a few hundred more Thursday night,
he said.
   ``We were going to leave tomorrow, but the embassy and our
company told us to get out as soon as possible,'' said Naomi Nishi,
an interpreter for Japan's Seibu-Saison Group, which is setting up a
joint venture furniture company.
   All 30 of the firm's Japanese employees were leaving today, she
said.
   ``I wanted to stay six weeks, but we have to leave after one week
because it is getting very dangerous,'' said a 29-year-old Swiss
tourist who was taking a Swissair plane sent to take the Swiss and
Austrians to Zurich.
   She and other students spent two nights at the Swiss Embassy out
of fear of soldiers who constantly cruise Beijing streets, pointing
their rifles at people and shooting occasionally.
   ``We slept in the embassy garden,'' said the woman, who spoke on
condition of anonymity. ``It was very comfortable. They have a roof,
and thick blankets to sleep on.''
   Karin Denkmayr, an Austrian studying at the Beijing Academy of
Drama, was taking the same flight.
   ``I don't want to leave but the Austrian government and Ministry
of Foreign Affairs say I had better,'' she said. ``If it gets to a
critical situation then we can't get out.''
   The Philippine government sent a commercial airliner to fetch 300
Filipinos after bickering among several government agencies and the
state-run Philippine Airlines.
   Some Philippine Embassy dependents had to beg for seats aboard an
earlier Singapore Airlines flight because the PAL jet was held up.

<HEAD>Businesses Plan to Increase Spending on Plants and Equipment by 6.5
Percent</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government reported today that American
businesses plan to increase spending on plants and equipment by a
solid 6.5 percent in 1989, despite growing evidence that economic
growth is slowing.
   Businesses responding to the Commerce Department survey said they
expected to spend $451.43 billion for expansion and modernization
this year. That is up from a record $423.69 billion spent on
business investment in 1988, the department said. All of the numbers
are adjusted for inflation.
   The survey, completed in May, indicated that businesses have
stepped up slightly their capital spending plans since a similar
survey completed in March found plans to increase spending by 6.3
percent this year.
   In an even earlier survey of 1989 business investment plans,
conducted last December, companies had estimated their capital
spending would increase 5.9 percent this year.
   The economy grew at a 4.3 percent annual rate during the first
quarter of 1989, but growth in the gross national product was a
sluggish 1.8 percent discounting a statistical bounceback from last
summer's drought. That compares with GNP growth of 3.9 percent for
all of 1988.
   The slower growth is attributed to the Federal Reserve's upward
pressure on interest rates for 15 months as it attempted to slow the
economy to ease inflation.
   The projected growth in business spending would spell good news
for the economy, providing part of the momentum needed to guide it
to a slower growth path without sliding into a recession.
   It also could help stem inflation by boosting production, and
thus avoiding shortages and increasing the amount of goods available
to American consumers.
   Capital spending grew 10.1 percent in 1988 as companies rushed to
expand production to meet rising export demand. It was the sharpest
increase since a 16.6 percent jump in 1984, when businesses were
still recovering from the 1981-82 recession.
   Spending climbed just 2.3 percent in 1987 and dropped 3.9 percent
in 1986.
   In the latest survey, manufacturing companies said they planned a
3.6 percent increase in capital outlays to $170.54 billion, compared
to 12.8 percent in 1988. This includes a 1.4 percent rise in plants
that produce durable goods, items expected to last three years or
more, and a 5.7 percent increase in companies producing non-durable
goods.
   Companies engaged in mining, transportation and other
non-manufacturing ventures are expected to increase spending by 8.4
percent to $280.89 billion.
   Before adjusting for inflation, 1989 plant and equipment spending
is expected to rise by 9.9 percent to $472.08 billion, down from
10.3 percent in 1988.

   Parliament Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani said
today that Iran will help free American hostages in Lebanon if the
United States tries to win freedom for Iranians held by Christian
forces in Lebanon.
   It was the first time a top Iranian leader has commented on the
foreign hostages since the death of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini on
Saturday. Under Khomeini, Iran supported pro-Iranian groups in
Lebanan which are believed to be holding most of the 15 foreign
hostages, including nine Americans.
   Responding to a recent appeal by President Bush to help gain the
release of U.S. hostages, Rafsanjani said that if ``the Americans
who have more influence than us on the Phalangists (right-wing
Christians in Lebanon) take action in securing the release of our
hostages, then they can expect our help.''
   Rafsanjani was referring to four Iranians who have been missing
in Lebanon for nearly seven years. Although the four are widely
believed to be dead, Iran has repeatedly tried to use them as a
bargaining chip with the United States.
   In his other remarks during an unusual news conference with
foreign reporters, Rafsanjani said it could take a long time to
formally end the Iran-Iraq war and that Khomeini told him to improve
relations with the Soviet Union. He also said Britain must take the
initiative to improve ties with Iran. According to British news
reports today, Iran will not withdraw Khomeini's February order that
Moslems seek out and kill the Salman Rushdie, author of ``The
Satanic Verses,'' but ``is prepared to let the matter drop.'' Many
Moslems believe the book defames Islam.
   The four Iranians Rafsanjani referred to were seized by
right-wing Christians in Beirut in 1982 during the Israeli invasion.
They include Ahmad Motevaselian, commander of the contingent of
Iranian revolutionary guards based in the Bekaa valley in east
Lebanon; Embassy Charge d'Affaires Hussein Musavi and Kazem Akhavan,
a correspondent for Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency.
   The fourth was their Lebanese Shiite Moslem driver, Rastegar
Moqadam, who also held an Iranian passport.
   Pro-Iranian groups are believed to be holding 15 foreigners,
including nine Americans. Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press, is the longest held of the
foreign hostages in Lebanon. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   On the 8{-year Iran-Iraq war, Rafsanjani, who is acting military
commander, said Iran was not willing to make any concessions to Iraq
in the peace talks. The U.N.-sponsored talks stalled soon after they
started Aug. 25.
   The official Islamic Republic News Agency quoted him as saying,
``We are determined to put an end'' to the war. He said the
stalement in peace talks may last for some time.
   At his news conference, Rafsanjani quoted Khomeini as saying days
before he died that Iran should improve ties with the Soviet Union.
Rafsanjani said he would visit the Soviet Union later this month but
that a date had not been set.
   Rafsanjani said Khomeini told him to ```try to promote your
relations with your big northern neighbor' and we will follow this
policy drawn by the imam.''
   Iranians refer to Khomeini as their imam, or spiritual leader. He
died of a heart attack Saturday, 11 days after undergoing surgery
for internal bleeding in his intestines. Rafsanjani was addressing
foreign correspondents who gathered in Tehran for Khomeini's funeral
Tuesday.
   In his will read to Parliament after his death, Khomeini singled
out the United States for special criticism, but it also warned Iran
against aligning itself with the communist bloc.
   On Iran's relations with the neighboring Arab states in the
Persian Gulf, Rafsanjani said: ``There is no problem on our side''
for improving ties.
   ``We have received positive signals from the Persian Gulf states,
except Saudi Arabia,'' the speaker said.
   Saudi Arabia severed ties with Iran in April 1988, complaining
that it supports terrorism and attempts to destabilize governments
in the region. The Arab states backed Iraq against Iran in the gulf
war.
   Strains developed again with Saudi Arabia after the kingdom
announced it was maintaining quotas introduced last year on the
number of pilgrims allowed to attend the annual hajj, the pilgrimage
to the Moslem holy cities of Mecca and Medina. More than 400 people,
most of them Iranians, died in clashes between Saudi police and
demonstraters during the hajj in 1987.

<HEAD>Two Cuban-Born Republicans Enter Race for Pepper's Seat</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The race is on for the U.S. House seat left vacant
by the death of Claude Pepper, with early expectations that the Aug.
29 special election will produce the first Cuban-born member of
Congress.
   In bilingual news conferences Wednesday, two Cuban-born
Republicans, state Sen. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen and conservative
businessman Carlos Perez, announced they will seek the nomination
for the seat held 26 years by Pepper, a liberal Democrat in a
district that came to be dominated by conservative Hispanics.
   Democrats vowed to hold onto the seat and turn the tide of GOP
victories in the South.
   ``The perception that we are flat on our backs in the region is
false,'' National Democratic Chairman Ron Brown said in Washington.
   The Miami area is home to many of the 1 million Cubans who have
come to the United States since Fidel Castro came to power 30 years
ago. Cuban-Americans tend to be more conservative and more ardently
anti-communist than other Hispanic-Americans.
   Ros-Lehtinen is an educator elected in 1982 to the Legislature.
She is married to U.S. Attorney Dexter Lehtinen.
   Perez, a once-destitute immigrant who built a multimillion-dollar
banana importing business and raised money for former Marine Lt.
Col. Oliver North, was once hailed by President Reagan as an example
of the American dream.
   State Sen. Jack Gordon is the most prominent name in a long list
of potential Democratic candidates. He said he will announce his
decision by Friday.
   His opposition to aid to the Nicaraguan Contras angered many
Cuban and Nicaraguan exiles.
   Registration in Florida's 18th district is 54 percent Democrat,
down from 72 percent a decade ago. The district ranges from
inner-city black areas and retirement enclaves to Little Havana and
upscale suburbs.
   Hispanis make up 40 percent to nearly half of the district.
   Pepper, who died at age 88 on May 30, was known as the last of
the New Deal liberals but took strong anti-communism stands,
including support of Contra aid.

<TEXT>
   A top NATO commander cast doubt today on
whether the East and West can agree to cut conventional forces and
weapons within a year as proposed by President Bush.
   ``It's optimistic, indeed. Unrealistic? I don't know,'' West
German Gen. Wolfgang Altenburg told reporters outside a NATO defense
ministers meeting at NATO headquarters in Brussels. He heads NATO's
panel of allied commanders.
   He spoke as U.S. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and his NATO
colleagues opened their annual two-day spring session on military
strategy.
   The meeting follows a session at NATO headquarters Wednesday of
12 European defense ministers that ended with a statement welcoming
economic and political reforms in Eastern Europe. But the ministers
also said the Soviet bloc remains more powerful in some military
areas and does not appear to have slowed modernization of its forces.
   In their sessions, the ministers are studying proposals to
increase the share of NATO funds paid by several nations other than
the United States.
   In his remarks, Altenburg said East-West relations were such that
``there is a lot of pressure'' from both sides to come to an early
agreement.
   At a NATO summit last week in Brussels, Bush proposed U.S. and
Soviet troops in Europe be cut to 275,000 on each side and the
number of combat planes and helicopters in East and West Europe be
reduced to 15 percent below NATO's current forces.
   The proposal would mean a European cut in manpower of 30,000 for
the United States. According to Western estimates, the Soviet Union
would have to slash its troops in Europe by 325,000 to reach the
same level.
   Bush's proposals, endorsed by all NATO allies, will be added to
proposals at conventional arms talks in Vienna, Austria.
   Those discussions also cover proposed deep cuts in other NATO and
Warsaw Pact armaments, including tanks and artillery.
   Bush, seeking to quicken the pace of the talks that opened early
this year, said he hoped an accord on conventional force cuts could
be reached within six months to a year with the reductions completed
by 1992 or 1993. At his press conference, Altenburg called that a
``very severe time factor.''

   A mob stormed a police station and tried to seize
weapons in the Uzbek republic's Fergana Valley, where ethnic
violence has killed 71 people, official media said today.
   More than 600 people have been injured and more than 400 arrested
since the unrest began about two weeks ago in the eastern part of
the Central Asian republic, official Radio Moscow said.
   Thousands of Interior Ministry soldiers have curbed, but not
stopped, arson and murder in the area, 1,500 miles southeast of
Moscow.
   The official Tass news agency reported that in the region's city
of Kokand, a crowd of thousands ``stimulated by alcohol and drugs''
stormed a police station Wednesday and tried to take weapons, while
another crowd of 600 attacked the transportation department of the
Interior Ministry.
   The attempts to obtain weapons failed, but so did appeals from
Kokand government and party leaders for calm, Tass said. Six people
died and more than 90 were injured; 65 houses and more than 20 cars
were set ablaze, it said.
   ``More houses are burning,'' Tass reported today.
   In the city of Fergana, which has a population of more than
200,000, shootings and arson attempts continued Wednesday night,
Radio Moscow reported.
   A dispute between Uzbeks and an ethnic Turk minority led to
``pogroms, arson, beatings and murder, accompanied by harassment and
rape in conjunction with insolent marauding, resistance to police
and internal security forces,'' Uzbekistan's premier told the
government newspaper Izvestia.
   The premier, Gayrat Kadyrov, said 141 police officers along with
100 civilians were hospitalized. He said he expected the death toll
of 71 to rise as the wounded died and more corpses were found in the
ashes of gutted houses.
   ``Passions are still boiling,'' Izvestia said.
   About 9,000 internal security troops have been brought in to
quell the unrest, but Tass said the government refrained from
bringing in the Red Army.
   Tass said law enforcement officers and soldiers in the area have
been authorized to use weapons for self-defense.
   An Uzbek grass-roots movement, Berlik, appealed today to the
Soviet parliament to remedy the miserable living conditions that it
said helped give rise to the unrest.
   ``People in the villages are living on the edge of poverty and
subsisting on bread and water because of the monopoly on cotton,''
said the appeal, read over the telephone from Tashkent by the
movement's secretary, Gavkhar Normatova.
   Activists claim that cotton production quotas imposed on
Uzbekistan by Moscow have resulted in neglect of food production and
ensuing shortages, and has poisoned the enviromment with intensive
use of fertilizers and pesticides.
   ``There are 1.5 million unemployed in Uzbekistan,'' Normatova
said. ``The real reason for this unthinkable slaughter is the
economic, political and cultural frustration of the people.''
   Kadyrov said more than 10,000 members of the Meskhi-Turk minority
involved in the unrest have been evacuated to a military training
camp. ``I don't want to oversimplify the situation,'' he said, ``but
I have grounds to say we are putting the situation under control.''
   The Meskhi Turks were deported from their homeland in Soviet
Georgia in 1944 by Josef Stalin and forcibly resettled in the
Central Asian republic.
   Officials say the violence began on May 23 during a marketplace
dispute between a Meskhi Turk and an Uzbek fruit vendor. The unrest
since has spread from city to city in the Fergana region.
   Over the weekend, more than 400 houses, 116 cars, eight
industrial enterprises and some schools and government offices were
destroyed, many by arson, Tass said.
   Uzbeks and Meshki Turks are traditionally Moslem. The Turkish
minority has been pressing its demands to be allowed to return to
its ancestral homeland in Georgia.
   In Moscow, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev told the Congress of
People's Deputies on Wednesday that authorities had the situation in
the Fergana Valley under control but that there were still incidents
of arson and killings.

   Premier Li Peng reappeared in public today and
praised the the soldiers who crushed the student protests for
democracy in Tiananmen Square. ``You have worked hard, comrades,''
he declared.
   At the same time, the government issued new martial law orders
demanding that student leaders surrender.
   Li gave a rousing speech to hundreds of soldiers inside the Great
Hall of the People on the square where thousands demonstrated and
where the massacre of hundreds of students took place over the
weekend. It was his first appearance in public since May 25.
   Li's speech was shown on television after hundreds of military
trucks roared into the city center with new supplies. Busloads of
foreigners, fearing new violence, rushed to the airport to catch
emergency flights out.
   Li, accompanied by Vice President Wang Zhen, also regarded as a
hard-line conservative, was dressed in a Mao suit and looked fit.
   The martial law orders appeared to suggest the government was
planning large-scale arrests of activists who led the movement for a
freer and less corrupt China.
   The capital's streets were relatively calm today.
   Li is believed to be among the leaders who pushed for the
military crackdown that ended in the weekend massacre of hundreds of
unarmed civilians as troops cleared Tiananmen Square of
pro-democracy protesters.
   He had not appeared in public since five days after his May 20
declaration of martial law in the capital, and his appearance
indicated hardliners may have prevailed over leaders who opposed
using troops to quell the protests.
   The student protesters had demanded Li resign for declaring
martial law after weeks of pro-democracy protests, primarily in
Beijing.
   The martial law orders called the leaders of independent student
and union groups ``important members of the counterrevolutionary
turmoil.'' It demanded that all members of the groups, leaders of
the pro-democracy movement smashed by the military, turn themselves
in to police.
   Radio and television gave telephone numbers for people to call to
report those who stood up against the military takeover of the city.
   In a continuing propaganda campaign supporting the harsh military
actions, national television repeatedly showed footage of crowds
attacking soldiers and burning vehicles during the crackdown in
Beijing on Saturday night and Sunday.
   It showed gruesome shots of three soldiers who were burned to
death. One was disembowelled.
   In his speech to the soldiers, Li urged them ``to continue
working hard to protect the capital's safety and order.'' They
cheered and applauded.
   A Hong Kong newspaper had reported that he had been shot and
wounded in the thigh by a police officer on Sunday after the
military took Tiananmen Square.
   Hundreds of troop trucks rumbled into the city of Beijing early
today, but residents claimed the hated 27th Army, which carried out
the weekend assault, had left the city, replaced by new troops.
   Citizens attempted to establish order in their shattered lives
under the watchful eyes of martial law troops, and the government
issued a new decree making it illegal to put up barricades in the
street and disrupt traffic.
   Last week, the people had pushed buses, trucks and other objects
into the streets in futile efforts to stop troops from entering the
city.
   The main concern has been that military units opposing the
violent suppression of the pro-democracy movement would launch an
attack to drive the 27th Army from Beijing. Roughly 200,000 troops
from about 13 army groups are bunched in and around the city.
   In buses and caravans, many bearing their countrys' flags,
foreigners left for the airport, where chartered flights took them
out of the country. They included non-essential personnel at the
U.S. Embassy and their families.
   ``We've taken an awful lot of moves to improve our security, and
the biggest one was putting those people on that plane and pulling
them out of town,'' U.S. Ambassador James Lilley told reporters at
the airport.
   One Asian diplomat said Chinese officials in the past few days
had been privately urging foreigners to leave the city because of
the impending danger.
   However, troops were seen with brooms today rather than automatic
rifles, sweeping the streets south of Tiananmen.
   Elsewhere, disturbances still wracked many provincial cities.
   A Chinese source in Sichuan's capital, Chengdu, where
anti-government violence has been reported, said troops had come
into the city but left.
   In Shanghai, much of the work force stayed away from jobs because
of street barricades set up in anticipation of a military assault.
   Other cities where protesters had barricaded rail lines and roads
and besieged government offices included Nanjing, Harbin, Tianjin
and Lanzhou.
   There was a semblance of normalcy in Beijing for the first time
since the weekend onslaught. Bicyclists were able to pass unimpeded
on the south side of Tiananmen and catch a glimpse of the huge
military encampment there.
   Armed soldiers lined the streets, but there were no confirmed
reports of troops opening fire on crowds, which was common until
today.
   In one incident, soldiers smashed the camera equipment of a
British Broadcasting Corp. crew and held a gun to the head of one
crewman. The crew, filming near a burned out vehicle near the
troops, was released after 30 minutes of questioning at gunpoint.
   China's hard-line leaders, who appeared to gain the upper hand in
a behind-the-scenes power struggle last week, issued two harsh
edicts Wednesday.
   One said troops were authorized to ``forcefully dispose of, on
the spot'' anyone who resists arrest. The other said any Communist
Party members who ``plotted, organized and led the rebellion''
during the student protests would be expelled from the party and
punished severely. It did not mention any names.
   A few vehicles ventured onto main streets Wednesday, but gas
stations remained closed, public transportation was stopped, mail
and newspapers weren't delivered and many stores were closed.
   The official Xinhua News Agency said many people are hoarding
food. Long lines formed outside those groceries that were open.
   People on Beijing's streets said the 27th Army had been replaced
in the city center by ``more peaceful'' troops from the 63rd, 68th
and 20th armies. Soldiers said to be from the 20th Army group
engaged in relaxed conversation with groups of residents just
southeast of Tiananmen.

   A city newspaper published a belated
birthday wish to Terry Waite from colleagues in Britain today, eight
days after he turned 50 and nearly 15 months since he was taken
hostage.
   The short, paid advertisement included a telephone number in
England, an apparent effort to initiate contact with Waite's
kidnappers.
   The message, wishing Waite a ``belated happy birthday'' from
colleagues in London, appeared on page three of the independent
An-Nahar daily.
   Waite, a Church of England envoy, was on his fifth Beirut mission
to seek freedom for hostages when he disappeared Jan. 20, 1987.
   He had left his hotel in Moslem west Beirut for a rendezvous,
apparently with representatives of Islamic Jihad, or Islamic holy
war, which holds U.S. hostages Terry Anderson and Thomas Sutherland.
   Waite never returned, and no group has claimed responsibility for
taking him hostage. He is among 15 foreign hostages, including nine
Americans, held captive in Lebanon. Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press, is the longest held of the
foreign hostages in Lebanon. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.

<TEXT>
   Israel's proposal for Palestinian elections
in the occupied lands topped the agenda when delegations from the
United States and the Palestine Liberation Organization met today.
   The two sides, in their third session since the U.S. government
lifted its ban on contacts with the PLO, met in a Tunisian
government guest house in suburban Carthage. It was not known how
long the session would last.
   Robert Pelletreau Jr., the U.S. ambassador to Tunisia and the
only American official authorized to deal with the PLO, intended to
discuss the Israeli-proposed elections in the occupied territories,
a U.S. official said.
   The PLO delegation was led by Yasser Abd-Rabbou, a member of the
group's executive committee. PLO officials say they would accept the
elections only if they were under international control and after an
Israeli withdrawal.
   The U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
PLO needed to define what it meant by ``an Israeli withdrawal.''
   PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat issued a statement today that said
Palestinians would accept U.N. supervision of an election. ``I ask
the United States of America: why did you agree on an international
status for Namibia and you refused such status in our occupied
territories?'' he said.
   U.N. troops moved into Namibia in April to help supervise the
African territory's transition to independence from South Africa.
   Israel, which considers the PLO a terrorist organization, has
denounced the talks with the United States as an obstacle to peace.
   Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe Arens, in an interview with The
Associated Press in Jerusalem on Wednesday, called the U.S.-PLO
dialogue ``counterproductive'' and said it undercut attempts to win
the support of Palestinians for Israel's peace proposals.
   Nearly all Palestinians living in the occupied territories obey
PLO instructions, whether or not they are members of the guerrilla
organization.
   The United States began its dialogue with the PLO in December
after Arafat recognized Israel's right to exist and renounced
terrorism.
   As they prepared for the talks, Pelletreau and Abd-Rabbou and
their advisers sat across from each other at a table and chatted
amiably in Arabic while photographers and reporters milled around
outside.
   After a few minutes the reporters and photographers were asked to
leave, and the talks began in closed session.
   At an unofficial meeting on May 18, the PLO's representative in
Tunis, Hakim Balaoui, handed Pelletreau a memorandum concerning the
proposals put forward by Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir.
   The plan calls for the 1.7 million Palestinians in the
Israeli-occupied territories to elect representatives to negotiate
with Israel for autonomy.
   Later talks would determine the final status of the West Bank and
Gaza Strip, but Israel has said an independent Palestinian state is
out of the question.
   Sources say the PLO memorandum did not reject the Shamir plan
outright, but outlined its conditions for elections in the occupied
lands.
   The United States, for its part, has told the PLO it wants the
Palestinian uprising in the occupied territories stopped. It also
wants the PLO to allow Palestinians living in the lands to negotiate
with the Israelis, a source said.
   The United States also reportedly told the PLO that its continued
attempts to send guerrilla groups on raids into Israel from Lebanese
and Jordanian territory violated its promise to refrain from
guerrilla activity.
   Arafat said recently in Kuwait that ``nothing and nobody can
deter the PLO from attacking its main enemy, Israel.''
   In his monthly statement to Palestinians in the occupied
territories, he told them ``not to let the enemy master'' the
uprising and to ``reject the elections intended to create a
leadership in replacement of the PLO.''

   Two mathematicians have calculated pi to 480
million decimal places, more than doubling the mark set last year,
according to Columbia University.
   Pi is an infinite string of numbers that is the ratio of the
circumference of a circle to its diameter. It is roughly equal to 22
divided by seven.
   Gregory and David Chudnovsky, brothers who are associate research
scientists at Columbia, made their calculation using supercomputers,
the university said in a statement.
   Their approach will allow mathematicians to grow the number from
its middle or end without having to start at the beginning, the
university said.
   The number they produced, if printed out, would be 600 miles
long, the university said.
   It surpasses a calculation of about 201 million decimal places
made last year by a Japanese researcher, Columbia said.

   China today accused the United States of violating
Chinese law and interfering in China's domestic affairs by giving
refuge to the nation's best-known dissident, Fang Lizhi.
   Vice Foreign Minister Zhu Qizhen, in a meeting with U.S.
Ambassador James Lilley, criticized the United States for ``wanton
interference in China's internal affairs,'' the official Xinhua News
Agency reported.
   ``We hereby express our profound regret and lodge a strong
protest and will closely follow further developments,'' Zhu was
quoted as saying.
   Fang took refuge in the U.S. Embassy on Sunday, hours after the
military moved into the city to crush pro-democracy protests.
   The dissident had earlier told The Associated Press he feared
arrest as hardliners in the government moved to stamp out the
democratic movement.
   Zhu said the United States had violated international and Chinese
law by giving shelter to the dissident.
   The State Department in Washington said Fang and his wife have
sought refuge but have not requested political asylum.
   Fang, a 53-year-old astrophysicist, gained international
prominence when the government accused him of provoking
pro-democracy student demonstrations in December 1986-January 1987.
   He was expelled from the Communist Party and lost his position as
vice president of the Science and Technology University in Anhui. He
was reassigned to work at an obversatory in Beijing.
   Fang has led Chinese intellectuals in calling for release of
political prisoners and asserting that economic and scientific
progress is impossible without protections for free thought. He has
also angered the Chinese by saying that Marxism is dead.
   He was at the hub of a dispute in February when Chinese police
stopped him from attending a dinner attended by President Bush
during a visit to Beijing.

<HEAD>Cultural Commission Ponders Historical Significance Of Carwash</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The city's Cultural Heritage Commission
usually considers preservation of such historical edifices as
Victorian mansions, but now it's studying a monument to another
aspect of Southern California culture.
   A combination carwash and gas station.
   ``The car has been a great part of our culture in the valley,''
said preservation campaign organizer Jack McGrath. ``A gas station
and carwash is an integral part of the development of Southern
California as the freeway system.''
   Homeowners have urged the commission to grant the carwash
monument status to keep a developer from tearing down the building
and putting up a mini-mall.
   Commission members went out Wednesday to ponder the significance
of the Studio City structure that residents call the unofficial
gateway to the San Fernando Valley.
   The building, dominated by three towering boomerang-shaped beams
and a sign on the marquee that says only ``Carwash,'' represents _
depending on one's tastes _ either the best or the worst of 1950s
carwash architecture.
   ``As an architectural monument, I'm not that favorably
impressed,'' said Takashi Shida, commission vice president. ``A
cultural monument? The fact it's one of the earliest carwashes in
the community is something, but I don't want to prejudge.''

   President Bush spoke by telephone with former
President Nixon before making his announcement of action in response
to the current crackdown on dissidents in China, a spokesman for
Nixon said today.
   John Taylor, speaking by telephone from Nixon's office in New
Jersey, said Bush telephoned the former president about an hour and
a half before making his announcement on Monday.
   Taylor said he had no information on the content of the telephone
call, which he said lasted about 10 minutes. He said it is Nixon's
policy not to discuss his conversations with presidents.
   Bush annnounced on Monday that he was suspending U.S. arms sales
to China to protest the Chinese military's bloody weekend crackdown.
He said he was not taking action toward severing diplomatic ties or
imposing economic sanctions that could hurt ``the Chinese people.''
   Nixon is associated with China because of steps he took to
improve U.S.-Chinese relations during his administration.
   Taylor said the former president has not expressed his views on
the current turmoil in China, but may do so soon in written form.
   Nixon spoke several times in person and by telephone with former
President Reagan during his two terms.

<HEAD>Puerto Rican Nationalist Gets Maximum Sentence In $7.1 Million Robbery</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Two Puerto Rican nationalists drew prison
terms of up to 15 years today for their part in a $7.1 million Wells
Fargo robbery after the judge rejected claims they were prosecuted
for their political views.
   Antonio Camacho Negron, 45, an auto mechanic, was sentenced to 15
years and fined $150,000. Norman Ramirez Talavera, a 32-year-old
graphic artist, was sentenced to five years and fined $50,000. Both
were convicted of conspiracy and other charges in the 1983 robbery,
the second-largest cash heist in U.S. history.
   Prosecutors said members of a militant Puerto Rican separatist
group, Los Macheteros, engineered the robbery of a half-ton of money
from a Wells Fargo depot in West Hartford to finance their
activities.
   Camacho denounced his trial and that of four other defendants as
a ``web of lies.'' Speaking in Spanish through an intepreter, he
claimed he was being punished because he refused to abandon the
cause of Puerto Rican independence.
   ``I struggled for the liberty of Puerto Rico,'' he said.
   ``There is no right to rob money,'' said U.S. District Judge T.
Emmet Clarie. ``It is a crime throughout the world. No one has been
charged because of his political views.''
   Neither defendant was accused of actually taking part in the
holdup; Camacho was convicted of transporting stolen money; Ramirez
was convicted of conspiracy.
   Also awaiting sentencing today was Roberto Maldonado Rivera, 53,
a lawyer, who was convicted of conspiracy.
   The three were convicted April 10 with Juan Segarra Palmer, a
39-year-old Harvard graduate whose sentencing today was postponed a
week because his lawyer is out of town. He faces up to 165 years in
prison for robbery, conspiracy and transporting stolen money.
   A fifth defendant was acquitted in April. Two others pleaded
guilty to lesser charges, and nine more are awaiting trial.
   Prosecutors contend Los Macheteros recruited a Wells Fargo guard
to carry out the robbery, then helped him escape to Cuba, where he
is believed to be living.

   A federal judge said today he has ``broad
discretion'' to consolidate two separate indictments against
Iran-Contra figure Richard Secord.
   At a hearing, Chief U.S. District Judge Aubrey Robinson said he
will rule Friday whether to combine criminal charges that accuse
Secord of lying to Congress to cover up personal profits in the
Iran-Contra affair with 1988 allegations that Secord slipped illegal
gifts to Oliver L. North.
   Thomas Green, Secord's attorney, argued against bringing the two
sets of charges together. He said one of nine counts brought in
April, obstruction of Congress, is ``incredibly broad'' and will
result in a lengthy battle over the use of classified material.
Prosecutors have said they plan to introduce no classified material
if Secord is tried on the consolidated charges.
   Green urged Robinson to try Secord separately on the gratuities
charges relating to North, a step Green said would enable a trial in
the next month or so.
   ``You wouldn't want that,'' the judge said.
   ``I would love that,'' Green insisted.
   Green said charges involving Secord's alleged lies to Congress
don't relate to the gratuities counts.
   The judge said, however, that ``broad discretion'' is ``given to
trial courts'' under federal rules that allow consolidation of
separate indictments and that there doesn't need to be ``mechanical
linkage.''
   At a previous hearing, Nov. 19 was mentioned by lawyers as a
possible starting date for a trial on consolidated indictments.
   The government is pressing to join the two sets of charges and
plans to abandon wide-ranging conspiracy and theft counts accusing
Secord of being involved in the diversion of Iran arms-sales profits
to the Contra rebels in Nicaragua.
   Because of the ``limited scope'' of the remaining charges, any
effort by Secord to present classified material in his defense
``will be a claim with very little likelihood of success,'' the
government said in court papers filed Wednesday.
   Identical conspiracy and theft charges against North were dropped
because of national security concerns. The government refuses to
declassify sensitive material that would have to be presented in
court in a trial of those charges.
   Secord, who became an arms dealer after retiring as an Air Force
major general, is charged in a March 16, 1988 indictment with
offering and paying illegal gratuities to North.
   In a separate indictment handed up in April, Secord is accused of
lying to Congress about his alleged profits in the Iran-Contra
affair, which the government says were in excess of $1 million.
   North, then a White House aide, enlisted Secord to run arms to
the Contras during a congressional ban on military aid to the
rebels. Secord also was accused in the April indictment of lying
when he denied that any money from a complex of overseas companies
known as the Enterprise benefited North.
   ``With the requested consolidation ... the government will offer
no classified documents as exhibits'' in the prosecution's case, the
government said in court papers.
   It said Willard Zucker, who moved money in the Iran-Contra affair
for Secord and his business partner, Albert Hakim, will be the
principal witness regarding the charges of lying to Congress.
   Zucker, a former Internal Revenue Service lawyer now living in
Switzerland, will be ``a key witness'' for the government on the
gratuities charges, the independent counsel's office said.
   The gratuities charges involve a $13,800 home security system for
North and a $200,000 fund set aside for the education of his
children.
   North was convicted last month of accepting the security system
from Secord, along with falsifying and destroying documents and
aiding and abetting in the obstruction of Congress. He will be
sentenced June 23.

   A gesture of good will to high school
seniors backfired when Charlotte-Douglas International Airport
officials tried to reroute planes so noise wouldn't interfere with
outdoor graduation ceremonies.
   Wednesday's less than satisfactory results were felt all the way
to Atlanta.
   ``We had absolutely the worst of all possible situations,'' said
airport Director Jerry Orr.
   ``It was a mess,'' said Phil Loftin, Federal Aviation
Administration tower chief.
   The airport changed its takeoff and landing patterns to reduce
noise during 9:30 a.m. commencements at Olympic, West Mecklenburg
and Harding high schools, located near the ends of the airport's
three runways.
   But flights already delayed by thunderstorms got even later when
the Charlotte airport started its rerouting, and delays quickly
spread to some connecting airports as planes were late leaving or
had to await a chance to land.
   ``I know some planes sat on the ground in Atlanta for an
excessive period,'' Loftin said.
   That meant some passengers waiting in Charlotte missed
connections.
   ``We heard a lot of complaints from a lot of people today,'' Orr
said.
   Even the commencement ceremonies suffered, because the
thunderstorms worsened and controllers had to abandon the plan and
send planes out as fast as they could.
   With thick clouds reflecting the sound, noise from the jets
boomed down onto West Mecklenburg High north of the airport and
Olympic to the south. Orr said one jet flew directly over Olympic,
four over West Mecklenburg.
   Not by the count of Kay Boone, a secretary at West Mecklenburg.
``I sat out there and counted 13 planes in 45 minutes,'' she said.
``It was horrible.''

<HEAD>Two Dozen Deputies Walk Out Of Soviet Congress Session</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with Baltic deputies walking out, other
deputies warning of economic, ecological problems. EDITS to tighten. No

<TEXT>
   About two dozen deputies from the Baltics walked
out of the Soviet Congress today to protest what they called
infringement on their republics' sovereignty.
   ``Comrades, Comrades, I ask you to be calm because this is not
all so simple,'' President Mikhail S. Gorbachev urged the deputies
as they left the Kremlin's Palace of Congresses.
   Earlier, a radical economist told the parliament the country
should cut aid to the Kremlin's Latin America allies and pay farmers
in hard currency to help avert imminent economic collapse.
   Another deputy said the country was on the brink of ecological
disaster.
   The deputies walked out after they objected to formation of a
committee by the 2,250-member Congress of People's Deputies that
will decide whether laws conform to the Soviet Constitution. They
said the committee could encroach on their republics. The
legislatures of Estonia and Lithuania have proclaimed the right to
veto laws approved by the central government in Moscow.
   ``Our electors ordered us to take care of the sovereignty of our
republics,'' said Romas V. Gudaitis, a writer from Lithuania. ``We
consider the elections of the Constitutional Inspection Committee to
be without purpose and we will not take part in them.''
   Lithuanian deputies, among the most vocal at the session that
began on May 25, led the walkout, the Tass news agency reported. It
was not immediately clear if other representatives joined them.
   Soviet TV cameras, in a live broadcast of the sesssion, showed
about 25 deputies storming out.
   Baltic deputies complained that they had not had enough time to
study the committee's functions, and said the matter should be
postponed until the parliament's fall session.
   ``The question is so serious let's not hurry,'' said Igor Gryazin
of Tartu in Estonia.
   The Congress voted overwhelmingly to form the committee, but 433
deputies opposed this.
   Gorbachev said he would consult with the deputies who objected
and that the issue would be taken up again on Friday.
   The walkout was the first since the Congress convened and was the
most dramatic sign of opposition to the Communist Party
establishment that runs the session and nominates committee members
and other officials.
   Earlier today, economist Nikolai Shmelev warned that if
snowballing inflation, worsening consumer shortages and the
``monstrous budget deficit'' are not halted, ``in two or three years
we could face an economic crash.''
   Shmelev, one of the Soviet Union's most prominent reform-minded
economists, said Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov's economic program
underestimates the gravity of the country's crisis.
   Ryzhkov on Wednesday announced plans for defense cuts and
government relief for the nearly 40 million Soviet citizens he said
were living below the poverty line.
   Shmelev said the government must do away with Gorbachev's
anti-alcohol campaign and import more than $15 billion of goods to
ease the country's consumer crisis.
   Gorbachev's cutbacks on alcohol sales, introduced two months
after he came to power in March 1985, led to massive losses of
government revenue and widespread home-distilling.
   Shmelev said the hard currency to pay for imports could come
partly from motivating Soviet farmers to work harder by offering
rewards in foreign currency.
   Deputies applauded when he suggested the government tell
collective farm chairmen ``if they sell grain and meat to the state
above a certain level they will be paid in hard currency with the
right of spending it wherever they want.''
   The extra crops they produce would be cheaper than the current
Soviet practice of buying grain abroad to make up for shortfalls in
domestic harvests, he said.
   Shmelev also called for a cut in aid to Latin America.
   Quoting U.S. estimates that the Soviet Union spends $6 billion to
$8 billion on activities there, especially in aid to Cuba, he said
``no one understands what a significant portion of that money is
spent on.''
   His speech was in line with the vocal, combative role assumed by
some members of the new Congress. In the past, Soviet lawmakers
docilely adopted any measure submitted by Kremlin leaders.
   Deputy Alexi Yablokov, a Moscow biologist, said the government
should stop issuing economic decrees.
   ``Our national economy reminds me of a frog,'' he said. ``Every
one of its jumps is a decree. Sometimes it jumps straight ahead,
sometimes to the right, sometimes to the left depending on what
scares it at the moment.''
   Yakblovkov also said every third Soviet man will suffer from
cancer caused by pollution. He blamed the country's massive
ecological problems on loss of local control.
   Ryzhkov, in his economic program presented to Congress on
Wednesday, said the Kremlin would continue trimming defense spending
through 1995 and reduce the amount of national income spent on
defense by up to 50 percent.

   Actor Martin Sheen can remain honorary
mayor of this exclusive beachfront community despite the impromptu
welcome he gave to the homeless, the Chamber of Commerce decided.
   Sheen created a hubbub last month when, shortly after his
appointment, he declared Malibu a ``nuclear-free zone, a sanctuary
for aliens and the homeless and a protected environment for all
life, wild and tame.''
   A syndicated radio talk show host took Sheen up on his
declaration, offering to bus hundreds of homeless people to Malibu.
Some local business leaders urged the chamber to take back Sheen's
ceremonial title.
   Late Wednesday, the chamber met behind closed doors to take up
the matter.
   ``We unanimously voted to support him as honorary mayor for
1989,'' announced Olivia Thornton, the group's president.
   Chamber members praised the veteran actor, a longtime supporter
of liberal causes who has been arrested several times at various
protests.
   ``Sheen possesses and is entitled to his own points of view and I
think he is truly trying to do good,'' said former chamber President
Peter Arnold. The honorary mayor appears at community functions and
promotes Malibu shopping.

   Actor Robert Duvall spent the day at an
elementary school where he sat on the floor, ate lunch, answered
questions and surprised the principal who did not believe he would
accept an invitation.
   The star of the hit miniseries ``Lonesome Dove'' wore a Western
hat, jeans and cowboy boots when he visited the 220-student
Elliston-Lafayette Elementary School in rural Montgomery County.
   ``We had no idea that a person so famous would come,'' Principal
Lois Hinkle said after the actor had climbed into his pickup and
headed back to his farm in northern Virginia.
   Duvall told the children his age, 58, ate turkey and dressing,
and sat on the floor with the students.
   The children decided to write the actor after a visiting artist
drew a picture of Duvall, in his role in ``Lonesome Dove,'' as part
of a demonstration to an art class. The children suggested he might
want to visit them for a ``Lonesome Dove Day,'' with everyone
dressed in Western garb.
   ``It only took me 20 or 30 seconds to decide to come down here,
after reading their letters,'' said Duvall, who accepted the
portrait during an assembly. ``They touched me. It's an honor and
I'm really glad I came.''
   ``He was an absolutely fantastic person. He went around to all

   Sondra Locke's palimony suit
against actor Clint Eastwood likely will go to trial because
attorneys for the separated couple failed to reach a settlement,
according to a published report.
   Eastwood, 58, and Locke, 42, split after being together for 13
years. Locke's lawsuit, filed in April, alleges Eastwood persuaded
her to have two abortions and to be sterilized during their
relationship.
   Their attorneys failed to work out a settlement during a closed

Hogoboom, the Los Angeles Daily News reported Wednesday.
   Unless further talks are successful, the lawsuit is expected to
go to trial sometime this fall or early next year.
   Eastwood and Locke met on the set of ``The Outlaw Josey Wales.''
They have appeared together in several films, including ``The

refusenik movement.
   Miss Fonda, who championed the dissident's cause before she was

   Miss Fonda, who often has received brickbats rather than plaudits

   More than a 1,000 workers, intellectuals and Solidarity campaign

anti-war songs, ballads and the Beatles.
   The crowd applauded warmly and shouted ``Solidarity!'' when Baez

activist who recently visited the United States.
   Baez beamed as she opened the concert with a song with the

repressed.
   American singer Stevie Wonder and French singer Yves Montand gave

   A teen-age father-to-be who lost his
license for dropping out of school is mounting the first court
challenge to the law.
   Michael Means, 17, sued on Wednesday to have West Virginia's
first-in-the-nation anti-truancy law declared unconstitutional.
   Under the law passed last summer, students under 18 who miss more
than 10 consecutive days of school or have 15 unexcused absences
lose their driving privileges.
   ``I think the law is ignorant. It shouldn't have had to go this
far,'' said the teen-ager's father, William Means.
   The younger Means dropped out a year ago in the ninth grade. On
May 30, the license was revoked.
   Means, whose 16-year-old wife, Tonya, is expecting the couple's
first child in September, has argued that he can't get a job without
a license and that he is entitled to an exception under a hardship
clause in the law.
   However, school officials have said that Means is not entitled to
an exemption because he could work and still complete his education.
   Tom Madden, a Department of Motor Vehicles attorney, said the
agency had not seen the lawsuit and could not comment. Schools
notify the DMV of students who drop out and are also responsible for
deciding hardship cases.
   Wisconsin has a similar law. California passed one, but Gov.
George Deukmejian vetoed it.
   In West Virginia, 353 students lost their license through
December, and about 100 of them returned to class, the DMV said.
   Means' attorney, Chris Butch, said today that the dropout law
contradicts another law that allows students to quit school at 16.

<HEAD>Hiker Struggles For Survival With Two Broken Legs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PINE, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A hiker who suffered a fall that left her with
two broken legs and injured wrists crawled on her elbows for two
days and drank water from rain and hail before being rescued.
   Nancy Kruhmin was found Wednesday, bloodied and fatigued, by two
hikers and a Jefferson County sheriff's deputy. She had almost made
her way several miles back to her car through the rugged mountainous
terrain of Pike National Forest.
   ``This is a person who performed her own amazing rescue,'' said
sheriff's spokesman Bob Deutsch.
   Kruhmin, 26, fell 10 to 15 feet from a steep rock ledge during a
day's outing on Monday, Deutsch said.
   ``That incapacitated her from using her arms or legs, so she
hiked back out, crawling inch by inch,'' Deutsch said. ``She toughed
it out ... She endured the pain and kept crawling out on her elbows.
It is just amazing.
   ``To keep herself alive, she caught rain water and hail in her
mouth while lying on her back. The pain was so severe that she
wrapped her legs in her day pack and zipped it around her feet to
try to immobilize her broken bones.''
   Kruhmin was taken to St. Anthony Hospital Central where she
underwent surgery Thursday and was listed in serious condition.
   She was found about a quarter-mile from her car. Authorities are
uncertain just how far she was from her car when she fell, but
believe she had crawled several miles.
   Kruhmin carried some trail snacks and was wearing sweat pants, a
cotton shirt and a light jacket, said David Bailly of the North Fork
Volunteer Fire Department, who assisted with the rescue.
   ``She really impressed us with her instincts for survival and her
personal strength,'' Deutsch said.

   Fourteen Yugoslavs went on trial
Thursday on charges that they were members of an ``American-style
organized crime gang'' that allegedly operated in this Croatian
capital.
   If the men are convicted ``in the first Mafia trial'' in
communist Yugoslavia, ``that would be an official recognition that
organized crime has taken hold in this country,'' the Vecernje
Novosti newspaper said.
   The suspects are charged with a series of attempted murders,
extortions, intimidations and beatings, published reports said.
   The group reportedly offered ``protection'' to several private
night clubs, restaurants and shops. Owners who rejected the offer
were beaten up and their establishments were destroyed.

   President Bush, who is making his debut in
prime-time television tonight with an East Room news conference,
talked with industry leaders today about the environment and
promised new clean-air legislation to ``significantly improve'' the
quality of life in America.
   Bush conferred with industry officials during the morning and
arranged an afternoon session with environmentalists to talk about
proposed changes in the 1970 Clean Air Act.
   At 8 p.m. EDT, he planned to meet with reporters to answer
questions.
   In a speech for Ducks Unlimited, a conservation group, Bush said
that on Monday he will unveil ``the most sweeping changes to the
Clean Air Act since it was last amended 12 years ago.
   ``It will allow us to recover and restore precious forests, lakes
and streams,'' he said. ``And whether Americans live near factories,
in cities or in high woodland country, it will significantly improve
every North American's quality of life.''
   Bush told the industry leaders he was still working on his
proposal. He promised in February to fix a date certain for reducing
smokestack emissions that cause acid rain, which is blamed for
killing waterways and forests, particularly in Northeastern America
and Canada.
   Bush's news conference tonight coincides with the start of the
evacuation from China of all dependents of U.S. government employees
and non-essential personnel.
   ``We have urged all other Americans in China to leave at once,''
White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Wednesday. He said
U.S. Embassy personnel were trying to arrange safe transportation to
the airport from Beijing hotels and other locations.
   Tonight's news conference marks Bush's first question-and-answer
session in the stately, chandeliered East Room of the White House.
He has met with reporters on numerous occasions in the first 4{
months of his presidency, but always during the day and never in the
formal setting of the East Room.
   By scheduling the session in television's prime-time hours, Bush
assures himself of the largest possible audience.
   Fitzwater said Bush has held 16 to 23 news conferences so far,
depending on how you define a news conference. On Monday, for
example, Bush fielded questions for 20 minutes in the White House
briefing room.
   Bush also has held question and answer sessions in Ottawa, Tokyo,
Brussels, Bonn and London. They have ranged in length from a few
minutes to about a half hour.
   Fitzwater said the White House has been looking for an
opportunity for the past two months to have a full-blown East Room
news conference. He said Bush decided to go ahead now, given the
developments in China and his success at the NATO summit in
Brussels, where he defused a crisis over short-range nuclear
missiles and proposed a cutback in Soviet and American combat troops.
   Traditionally, presidential news conferences run for a half hour
but Bush may ignore that, Fitzwater said. He described his boss as
``a president who has trouble confining himself to 30 minutes.''
   Fitzwater said Bush would open with a prepared statement but
likely would not make any announcements, as he did Monday in ending
military sales to China.
   Fitzwater said Bush was not making any special preparations for
the news conference, although his Wednesday afternoon schedule was
largely clear of appointments. The spokesman said Bush would meet
sometime today with his staff to discuss areas of questions.
   In another development, Fitzwater said Bush will visit
Yellowstone National Park and the Grand Tetons in Wyoming on Monday
after proposing legislation to overhaul the Clean Air Act.
   The press spokesman said Bush would stop in Lincoln, Neb., on the
way home Tuesday to deliver a speech on alternative fuels, also part
of the environmental package to be unveiled Monday.
   While at Yellowstone, the president will visit some of the areas
charred from the fires last summer that are now undergoing
revegetation, Fitzwater said.
   He will spend the night in a lodge near Jackson Hole, Wyo., and
speak Tuesday morning at the Teton Science School.
   His clean air proposal, still in the final stages of preparation,
is expected to call for tighter standards for emissions that cause
acid rain and for more strictly controlling auto exhaust emissions.

   Wanda Suhr beat a speeding ticket, but
a speed-reading course might have helped her stay out of jail. She
said she was held for 15 minutes because she hadn't paid a $36 fine
to the city library.
   The Sterling Heights woman said she checked out a biography of
Clark Gable last June and returned it in October without paying the
fine. A warrant was issued but nothing happened until Monday, when
she went to court in Roseville to pay a speeding ticket.
   The ticket was dismissed, Suhr said, but then she was arrested on
the library warrant.
   Suhr, 20, said Roseville officers drove her to the border of East
Detroit, where two officers picked her up and drove her to the city
jail. She said she spent 15 minutes alone in a cell, then appeared
before a judge who released her on $100 personal bond.
   ``The judge told me if I pay the $36 and bring him the receipt he
would dismiss the case,'' Suhr said. ``You can believe that I will
pay the late fee before Monday.
   ``I liked the book. ... I like Clark Gable,'' she said. ``But
he's not worth $36.''

<HEAD>Commission Urges U.S. and Canada to Bar New Species</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An international commission urged the United
States and Canada on Thursday to bar new species of animals from the
Great Lakes in an effort to prevent additional harm to the region's
delicate ecology.
   ``The integrity of the Great Lakes ecosystem requires the
maintenance of a balanced yet dynamic natural system,'' the
International Joint Commission, a U.S.-Canadian agency, said in a
report on the lakes' environment.
   ``Introduced species can seriously affect the balance and
distribution of native species by altering the structure and
developmental patterns of their biological communities,'' it added.
   The report by the commission noted that there have been
continuing concerns about outside species in the lakes, the sea
lamprey and smelt in particular.
   However, in recent years, the number of alien species introduced
into the lakes has shown a significant increase.
   Among the outside species that now threaten the lakes' native
life forms are the alewife, the coho salmon, the Asiatic clam, the
zebra mussel and the river ruffe.
   The commission encouraged involvement by the coast guards of the
United States and Canada in controlling the problem, and recommended
that the nations ``take steps to prevent the further introduction,
particularly the unplanned introduction, of exotic life forms into
the Great Lakes ecosystem.''
   It was the first time the commission had made such a
recommendation, said Frank Bevacqua of the commission's Washington
office.
   Some of the outside species were introduced for sport fishing.
Others made their way into the lakes as hitchhikers on ships or
through extending their range from bodies of water outside the lakes
region.
   Although the new species are controlled by predators in their
original homes, many lack predators in the lakes, ``and given an
adequate food supply and appropriate life-support systems, ... they
can become a serious threat if they outcompete or destroy valuable
native species,'' the commission said.
   The report also warned of increasing concentrations of toxic
substances in Great Lakes animals, a reversal of declines recorded
in the 1970s.
   Waterbirds on the lakes, however, were producing more offspring,
the commission said.
   ``Populations that were once declining have increased
substantially, and reproductive problems in fish-eating birds are
generally confined to specific sites,'' the report said.
``Similarly, increasing bald eagle nesting sites are being reported
in the basin.''
   The report gave no figures on increased toxic-substance
concentration or bird reproduction.

<TEXT>
   A 59-year-old man who said he was driven
mad by his wife's constant playing on an electric organ was
convicted of arson for setting their house on fire.
   ``If you have someone playing the organ 24 hours a day, seven
days a week, how would you react? She didn't play it very well,
either,'' George Bangs said after he was sentenced in Exeter Crown
Court on Wednesday to two years on probation.
   Bangs said his wife's organ playing had destroyed their marriage,
and he set fire to their home of 22 years when faced with the
prospect of selling it to pay for a divorce. His wife's car also was
damaged.
   The episode hasn't stopped his now-divorced wife's musical
endeavors, Bangs said.
   ``She still plays the organ, and so does the man she lives with.
They play duets together,'' he said.

   Here is a look at key events in the student pro-democracy
movement and at events since Sunday's assault by soldiers on
protesters in Tiananmen Square:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   April 15 _ Former Communist Party chief Hu Yaobang dies. Beijing
University students put up posters praising him and indirectly
criticizing opponents who forced his resignation after student
demonstrations in 1986-87.
   April 18 _ Thousands of students march in Beijing and Shanghai,
expressing dissatisfaction with the government and shouting ``Long
live Hu Yaobang! Long live democracy!'' About 1,000 stage a sit-in
at the Great Hall of the People to demand greater democracy, a free
press, and more money for education.
   April 24 _ Students begin boycott of university classes.
   April 27 _ In the largest to date of a continuing series of
protests, more than 150,000 students, with wide support from people
on the street, surge past police lines and fill Tiananmen Square,
chanting slogans for democracy and freedom.
   April 29 _ Officials meet with student leaders, but independent
student groups are not satisfied and continue a class boycott at 41
universities.
   May 4 _ About 100,000 students and supporters march on Tiananmen
Square to celebrate the 70th anniversary of China's first student
movement. Demonstrations are held in Shanghai, Nanjing and other
cities. About 300 journalists protest outside the official Xinhua
News Agency.
   May 13 _ About 2,000 students begin a hunger strike in Tiananmen
Square.
   May 14 _ Thousands flock to the square to back the students. The
number fasting rises to 3,000.
   May 15 _ The government deadline for students to leave the square
passes. Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's welcoming ceremony
planned near the square must be moved to the airport.
   May 16 _ Hundreds of thousands occupy the square. Journalists and
intellectuals join the protest.
   May 17 _ Zhao pleads for students to leave. Students reject his
appeal and hold marches that generate 1 million supporters in
Beijing.
   May 18 _ About 1 million people, including many workers, again
take to the streets to show their support for the hunger strikers.
Li Peng issues a stern lecture to student leaders and refuses to
discuss their demands.
   May 19 _ A tearful Zhao visits weakened hunger strikers. Li also
visits the students briefly. The students later decide to end the
hunger strike.
   May 20 _ Martial law is declared in parts of Beijing. Zhao
reportedly resigns after failing to persuade Li and other hardliners
to compromise. Students resume their hunger strike, then abandon it,
saying they will need their strength for the struggle ahead.
   May 21 _ Students claim to reject an order by Li Peng to leave
Tiananman Square or face military action. Defying martial law,
hundreds of thousands of people remain in the square or block
intersections to prevent troops from reaching it.
   May 22 _ Hundreds of thousands of people again block major roads
and senior military leaders say they are resisting orders to order
their troops on the protesters. At least one military convoy is
reported to withdraw.
   May 23 _ One million people take to the streets to demonstrate
for democracy.
   May 25 _ Li makes his first appearance since declaring martial
law. State-run radio says 27 of 29 provinces support martial law,
and military units announce they support martial law.
   May 26 _ Sources say Zhao and another leading liberal, Wan Li,
head of the legislature, are under house arrest.
   May 27 _ Beijing student leaders propose students end their
occupation of Tiananmen Square. Non-Beijing students resist and the
sit-in continues.
   May 28 _ About 80,000 people, many students from outside the
capital, stage a demonstration, but unlike in past rallies few
workers participate.
   May 30 _ Students unveil their ``Goddess of Democracy,'' a
replica of the Statue of Liberty, on the square. The government
calls it an insult to the nation. Students rally outside police
headquarters to protest the detention of three members of an
independent labor union.
   May 31 _ The first of several pro-government rallies is staged by
farmers and workers in Beijing suburbs. The participants, ordered to
show up, show little enthusiasm.
   June 1 _ The Beijing Municipal Government warns foreign
journalists that under martial law they must receive approval for
all press coverage. Coverage of the demonstrations is banned.
   June 2 _ More than 1,000 troops appear outside the railway
station in a show of force.
   June 3-4 _ Tens of thousands of troops make several attempts to
move on the square but are driven back by crowds of hundreds of
thousands of people supporting the students. Riot squads beat and
fire tear gas at demonstrators. A final push is made the evening of
June 3, and soldiers begin firing on crowds. Troops surround and
enter the square June 4 in the early morning hours and thousands of
protesters flee. Hundreds are killed and thousands wounded.
   June 5 _ Soldiers terrorize Beijing with random shooting of
unarmed civilians. Army reinforces positions in city center. Reports
spread of a split in the army and a battle between military
factions. Demonstrations in Shanghai, Nanjing and other major
Chinese cities to protest the slaughter in Beijing. Chorus of
condemnation from around the world. U.S. announces suspension of all
military sales and visits of Chinese military leaders, but stops
short of severing diplomatic ties.
   June 6 _ Armies loyal to rival factions are reported to be
clashing. Soldiers continue firing into crowds around Beijing.
Anti-government demonstrations spread to Shanghai, Nanjing, Chengdu,
Shenyang and other cities. Other nations urge their citizens to
leave Beijing.
   June 7 _ Soldiers sprayed a diplomatic compound with bullets and
foreign embassies ordered their nationals to leave Beijing. Hundreds
of foreigners leave the country. The U.S. government called the
situation ``increasingly dangerous.''
   June 8 _ Premier Li Peng makes his first public appearance since
May 25 and praises the soldiers who crushed the demonstrations. The
government issued new martial law orders demanding that student
leaders surrender.

   The state Supreme Court ruled today that
Kentucky's school system is unconstitutional because of the spending
gap between rich and poor districts, and it ordered the Legislature
to develop a new setup.
   The ruling has no immediate effect on the 600,000 students; the
court, ruling 5-1 with a seventh justice partly concurring and
partly dissenting, gave the Legislature until the end of its 1990
session to come up with a system to even out spending.
   ``We do not direct the General Assembly to raise taxes. It is
their decision how best to achieve efficiency,'' the court said.
   However, the court said the Legislature _ in what would be a
major departure _ must make local tax rates uniform.
   The ruling was prompted by a lawsuit filed in 1985 by 66
``property-poor'' districts. They charged that the school-finance
system, which depends on property taxes, is not fair in a state
where wealth varies widely, from the Appalachian coalfields in
eastern Kentucky to the affluent Cincinnati suburbs.
   Most states have similar setups in which state spending on
education is supplemented by revenue raised locally through property
taxes.
   In 1988, a judge agreed with the plaintiffs that the Legislature
had failed to meet its obligation under the Kentucky Constitution to
establish an equitable system of public, or common, schools in
either spending or quality.
   The Supreme Court largely upheld the judge's finding, saying that
Kentucky children, including those who ``by accident of birth and
residence'' live in poor areas, are entitled to the same educational
opportunities.
   ``This obligation cannot be shifted to local counties and local
school districts,'' the court said.
   Chief Justice Robert Stephens, writing for the court, said,
``Lest there be any doubt, the result of our decision is that
Kentucky's entire system of common schools is unconstitutional,''
including its financing regulations.
   The court said the Legislature has a chance to launch an ``era of
educational opportunity which will ensure a strong economic,
cultural and political future.''
   Gov. Wallace Wilkinson lauded the ruling. ``We have the
opportunity to rebuild, to redefine education in Kentucky. And if we
fail, we will have failed ourselves, our fellow Kentuckians and
particularly our children,'' he said.
   Schools Superintendent John Brock said today was ``the happiest
day of my professional life.''
   ``Today the court has propelled us from the 19th century to the
21st,'' he said.
   Justice Charles Leibson, in a dissent, said the ruling was
confusing, over-reaching and destined to spawn worrisome lawsuits.

   Hammers pounded at building sites, table tennis
resumed on campuses and soldiers cleaned up the debris. Beijing was
calm Thursday, almost normal, but students in the pro-democracy
movement say it won't last.
   ``The calm is just superficial,'' said a senior at Beijing Normal
University, whose students helped lead the seven weeks of
demonstrations. ``With so many people killed, there cannot be real
calm. It's just a matter of time before the movement peaks again.''
   The government said nearly 300 people were killed, but Chinese
and foreign diplomats estimate as many as 3,000 died when soldiers
with tanks and automatic weapons rolled into the city on Saturday
and retook Tiananmen Square from the students occupying it.
   Soldiers still fired into the air and at some bystanders
Thursday, but far less often than before.
   Dozens of small restaurants and shops reopened because of the
relative quiet, along with a few post offices. Banks remained closed.
   The Beijing Daily and Beijing Evening News were on sale for the
first time since Saturday and people formed long lines to buy them.
Both were filled with articles denying heavy casualties among
civilians and reporting the reopening of businesses.
   ``There's no news,'' one reader said in disgust.
   Most residents still stayed away from their jobs. Thousands took
bicycle tours of the city, stopping to gape at bullet holes in
buildings and bloodstains on walls.
   Curiosity-seekers clambered over the hulks of tanks burned by
citizens. They crowded around hospital morgues, watching families
carry out bodies.
   People walked boldly up to soldiers ringing Tiananmen Square,
which has been sealed since Sunday. The troopers politely but firmly
refused to answer questions.
   Residents of the area insisted they were not the same soldiers
who stormed the square Saturday night.
   The evening television news Thursday showed soldiers crouching,
using pieces of metal and their hands to clear away ashes and debris.
   Others hauled the wrecks of buses and tanks off Beijing's main
streets, put twisted road dividers back in place and swept the
curbs. A dozen troopers walked west along Changan Avenue, the main
street, trimming tree branches away from telephone lines.
   Whatever the soldiers did, dozens of curious residents watched
and commented.
   ``If we sit around inside, we get too nervous, so we go out to
have a look,'' said a restaurant cook who spent the day cycling
around the city, exchanging stories with other residents.
   Minzu Hotel employees said all their guests had left, but several
said they reported for work ``to protect the property.'' There have
been no reports of looting.
   ``Life is normal when we go home. We cook, eat,'' said a woman
clerk who sat on a pile of wool rugs in a souvenir shop reading a
week-old newspaper.
   ``I spend the day listening to the radio and worrying,'' said a
middle-aged professor strolling near his home.
   Few students still live on Beijing campuses, and said they rarely
venture out of their dormitories. At Beijing Normal, some played
table tennis while others snacked, read or napped.
   The Education Commission ordered Thursday that schools take steps
to resume classes, but the word at Beijing Normal was that too few
students and teachers remained.
   ``We don't know what to do,'' one student said. ``We are waiting
for orders, but our leaders are all gone.''
   Rumors have circulated that some student leaders were killed, but
an activist in hiding told The Associated Press all were alive.
   ``Maybe new leaders will have to emerge,'' another said. ``The
movement hasn't ended. Things may be calm for awhile, but the army
can't stay forever. When it goes, we students will protest again.''
   He and others said they still seek the resignations of senior
leader Deng Xiaoping and other hard liners who ordered the crackdown.
   ``I have no regrets,'' one said. ``No one thought things would
come to this, but it would not have if the local citizens hadn't
supported us. We students have great responsibility, and maybe we
should apologize to the citizens, but they are responsible too.''

<TEXT>
   Investigators trying to determine the
cause of a Suriname Airways crash that killed at least 169 people
examined the wreckage of the jetliner in a dense forest today.
   The DC-8 was approaching the Suriname capital, Paramaribo, early
Wednesday after a flight from the Netherlands when it crashed in the
tropical forest about two miles from the airport. Airline officials
said the aircraft had been trying to land in heavy fog when it hit
trees, crashed and broke apart.
   The Suriname News Agency reported 182 people were aboard. It said
13 people, including three children, survived the crash. Most
passengers were Surinamese living in the Netherlands.
   The dead included the three Americans who were flying the plane.
Three of Suriname's senior military leaders and three top Dutch
soccer players of Surinamese origin were believed among the victims.
   The airline identified the cockpit crew as Americans Capt. Will
Rogers, pilot Glyn Tobias and engineer Warren Rose, all employees of
Surinam Airways. Further information about them was not immediately
available.
   ``This mishap is simply a national disaster and, justifiably,
great grief prevails in our society,'' President Ramsewak Shankar
said in nationwide televised speech Wednesday night.
   He declared a national week of mourning. It was Suriname's worst
airline accident, and countries from around the world offered to
help the small northern South American nation of 400,000 cope with
the tragedy.
   Government spokesman Glenn Truidman said France was sending a
helicopter and a Dutch forensic specialist would assist authorities
identify bodies.
   A five-member team from the U.S. National Transportation Safety
Board was to arrive today to help the Suriname government in its
investigation. The experts were to analyze the cockpit's flight
recorder.
   Neighboring Brazil was flying in storage facilities because
Suriname doesn't have enough morgues, Truideman said.
   Those missing and presumed dead included Suriname's army chief of
staff, Maj. Raymond Lieuw Yen Tai; air force commander Maj. Eddy
Djoe, and army chief of operations Capt. Armand Salomons. The
airline said its crew of seven flight attendants also died. They
were all identified as Surinamers.
   The Suriname news agency said flight PY764 took off late Tuesday
from Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport and crashed at 4:30 a.m. Wednesday
near the Zanderij International Airport, about 15 miles south of the
capital.
   Motilal Atta Mungra, the director of Suriname Airways, said at a
news conference that his company had virtually ruled out technical
malfunctions because the 20-year-old plane had a maintenance checkup
two weeks ago. Still, he suspended all flights of the airlines'
other remaining aircraft.
   Mungra said the plane caught fire after hitting a tree and
crashing. He said the midsection of the plane landed on its back and
debris from the plane was strewn around a radius of 490 feet.
   Rescue operations were hampered because heavy rains in previous
days had turned the area into a near swamp.
   In the Netherlands, airline spokesman Leo Marapin said the plane
crashed after its third attempt to land in ``extremely bad'' weather.
   Suriname gained independence from the Netherlands in 1975. About
200,000 Surinamese live in the Netherlands.

   Provincial leaders recommended harsh action
Thursday against disruption of their cities by demonstrators
protesting the military crackdown on the pro-democracy movement in
Beijing.
   Demonstrations, some violent, have occurred in nearly all major
cities since soldiers stormed Beijing last weekend to drive students
from Tiananmen Square. U.S. intelligence reports estimate 3,000
people were killed.
   ``The present conditions in many enterprises in Lanzhou are
critical and the situation is grim,'' the official radio in the
western city quoted Gansu provincial Gov. Jia Zhijie as saying.
   Jia said ``the dregs of society'' had forcibly occupied ``vital
communications lines and important bridges'' and stopped trains.
Some students went to factories to force workers to strike and
``forcibly order factory directors to halt production,'' he said.
   ``It is necessary to form a deterrent force against them and
develop a situation whereby, when a rat runs across the street,
everybody cries `Kill it!''' the governor declared.
   Government leaders in Shanghai broadcast similar news: ``Vast
numbers of workers are unable to report to work, and industrial
production as well as the citizens lives are being disrupted.''
   Shanghai Mayor Zhu Rongji later said in a half-hour television
broadcast that he could not guarantee the safety of city residents,
but did not explain what he meant.
   He said he had received many requests to call in the army, but
added, ``The municipal party committee, the municipal government and
I myself have never considered the use of the army.''
   About half the work force in Shanghai, China's largest city,
remained off the job after days of protest in which crowds paralyzed
traffic with street barricades, a Chinese source said.
   The government leaders said action should be taken to
``resolutely stop the conspiracy of a few people with ulterior
motives of disrupting transport and throwing Shanghai into chaos.''
   Soldiers were called into Chengdu on Wednesday night after days
of violence, but were gone Thursday, a Chinese source said.
Unconfirmed reports said police shotand killed 20 people crowds
stormed a government building Sunday in Chengdu, capital of Sichuan
province.
   A foreign teacher in Changsha, a southern city, said several
thousand people held a funeral march to the railroad station
Thursday, and on Wednesday students visited factories to tell
workers about the killing of unarmed civilians in Beijing.
   Students also went to the workers in the northeast city of
Shenyang, a foreign source said. Among them was a woman from
Beijing's Qinghua University who saw the military attack on
Tiananmen Square.
   The source reported ``heavy rumors of a military presence'' on
the city's outskirts. She said Liaoning University students held a
large demonstration Thursday.

   One man was handcuffed and all passengers were
removed from a Continental airplane awaiting takeoff from LaGuardia
Airport on Thursday in what turned out to be a groundless threat,
authorities said.
   ``He says it was all a misunderstanding,'' said Allen Morrison, a
spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.
   A 55-year-old man was questioned by authorities, including the
FBI, about the incident aboard Flight 883, a Boeing 727 to New
Orleans and Cancun, Mexico, Morrison said.
   After the man was handcuffed and taken to a police car, all
passengers and their luggage were taken off the plane and the plane
was searched, officials said.
   The handcuffed man had been carrying a large radio-cassette
player, the type often called a boom box.
   ``The stewardess said he said there was a bomb in his boom box he
had carried on board,'' Morrison said.
   ``He claims he said, `They X-rayed it so much, what do they
think, there's a bomb in it?'''
   The man's radio and luggage were X-rayed and no bomb was found,
Morrison said.
   The plane was allowed to take off about 2{ hours late, said Ned
Walker, a Continental spokesman in Houston.

   A tornado wiped out nearly a square mile
of trailers and other buildings here early today, killing at least
two people, and twisters destroyed or damaged nearly 100 homes in
Baton Rouge, authorities said.
   The twisters were part of a storm system that also sent tornadoes
to numerous other towns overnight and knocked out power throughout
southeastern Louisiana.
   No serious injuries were reported 15 miles away in Baton Rouge,
where Fire Chief Ron Spillman said at least four twisters touched
down 19 times, destroying or damaging almost 70 mobile homes and 25
to 30 houses.
   Richard Zuschlag, co-owner of an ambulance service, said his
ambulances took at least two dozen people from the Grosse Tete and
Greensburg areas to the hospital. Two people were killed in the
Grosse Tete area, he said.
   Dan Lennie, an emergency worker in Grosse Tete, said 35 to 50
homes were damaged by the twister, which struck after 6 a.m.,
splintering 75-foot trees and knocking out virtually all
electricity, gas and telephone service in the town of 750.
   ``There's more devastation than I have seen in several years of
emergency work,'' said Lennie. ``Trailers have been devastated, nice
homes completely devastated. Also homes right in the middle of the
path have not been touched.''
   Police sealed off the area to non-residents while rescue workers
using dogs searched wrecked homes for dead or injured, he said. A
chainsaw was used to free a woman trapped in the wreckage of a home,
authorities said.
   Mayor Phillilp Sarullo said the twister struck without warning
and cut a wide swath of destruction. ``I'd say in 5 to 7 seconds it
was over with,'' he said.
   Flo Nereaux, manager of a truck stop where police set up a
command post, said authorities brought two bodies there and were
looking for others.
   ``It wiped out everything in its path. It's torn a body shop up,
torn a lot of trailers up,'' she said.
   ``We have the police out here right now. They're trying to gather
up the bodies. We're trying to get a refrigerated truck to put the
bodies in.''
   One woman apparently died when her trailer flipped over. Her body
was found when a bulldozer righted the home, authorities said.
   In Baton Rouge, Spillman said 400 to 600 people lived in the
destroyed or damaged residences. A shelter was set up at a high
school for those left homeless. At least six injuries were reported
in the Baton Rouge area, none serious.
   Two minor injuries were reported near Amite.

   Most of the Americans who will greet the 21st
century are already alive, a group far different from their
ancestors who welcomed the arrival of the 1900s, population analysts
said Thursday.
   During the 20th century, the nation's population has grown to
unprecedented numbers, people moved south and west, and there have
been major shifts in family life and in the status of women.
   The 21st century is still about a dozen years away but, from a
population perspective, the future is now.
   ``Over 80 percent of the people who will make up the population
of the United States in the year 2000 are now alive,'' said a new
study by the private Population Reference Bureau.
   The elderly of the 21st century are already well into their
lifespans and the first high school class of the next century is now
in the elementary grades, the independent bureau added in a study
released Thursday: ``America in the 21st Century: A Demographic
Overview.''
   At the same time, the Census Bureau issued its ``Population
Profile of the United States 1989,'' looking at the country's
current population status.
   The aging of America is likely the most discussed and documented
trend, with 29.8 million elderly in the country as of 1987, 12.2
percent of the population, and two-thirds of the group being women,
the Census Bureau reported.
   The agency said that this group will continue growing into the
next century, jumping to one American in five when the massive
post-World War II Baby Boom generation hits senior-citizen status by
about the year 2030.
   That will critically impact health care and retirement income
programs, said the Population Reference Bureau study.
   There will be a relative scarcity of young people to take
entry-level jobs, school enrollment could shrink and employers will
face a different mix of potential workers.
   Retraining of older workers may become an economic necessity,
said the private group, and there may become a need to ease
immigration rules to recruit certain skilled people from other
countries.
   The ``traditional'' family of working husband while the wife
stays home with the children has disappeared from the scene.
   Under half of all families have children, and even in families
that have offspring the majority of mothers held jobs outside the
home as of 1987, the Census Bureau reported.
   At the same time, the Population Reference Bureau said that ``the
growing incidence of divorce and out-of-wedlock births has fueled an
enormous increase in single-parent families.''
   Currently nearly one in four children lives with only one parent,
compared with one in 10 in 1960, the private group said.
   ``The growing concern over child care, elder care and parental
leave will continue well into next century,'' the group added.
   Rapidly growing black and Hispanic populations have also
attracted attention in recent years, with the Census Bureau
reporting that blacks now constitute 12.2 percent of Americans while
Hispanics make up 8 percent _ meaning that, although there is some
overlap, these two groups now include nearly one in five Americans.
   ``By 2000, nearly one-third of all school-age children will be
from minority populations,'' the Population Reference Bureau
reported.
   The decline in birth rates in recent years means that the growth
in the labor force will slacken, but an anticipated ``shortage'' of
workers in the next century will be one of the types of employees
available, not the total number, the private group said.
   ``Jobs of the future will demand a moderate to high level of
education and training, compared with jobs of the past,'' the group
added, and business concerns will center on the potential mismatch
between worker skills and job requirements.

   A Soviet MiG-29 fighter crashed today while doing a
high- performance aerobatic routine at the Paris Air Show. The
pilot, the lone occupant, ejected from the jet before it exploded.
   The crash occurred in the middle of the airfield, up to 700 feet
away from the nearest spectators, witnesses said. The pilot was
taken to a military hospital where he was reported to be in
satisfactory condition.
   No other casualties were reported.
   The fighter performed flips and turns before making its final
pass over Le Bourget airfield in preparation for landing when
witnesses saw two pieces fall from the aircraft. The jet then
plunged to the ground and burst into flames.
   The air show, which opens to the public on Friday, was attended
today by the exhibitors, reporters and invited guests.
   Fire engines and a water tanker doused the flaming wreckage of
the plane.
   Air show spokesman Patrick Guerin said of the pilot, ``It seems
he had a mechanical problem with the left engine'' as the plane was
turning at 1,000 feet. ``When he realized what was happening,
showing excellent reflexes, he ejected. But he was too low ... He
didn't have time to open his chute.''
   Soviet and air show officials said the pilot was taken to a
nearby hospital, then to the military hospital at St. Mande, east of
Paris.
   The pilot's condition was ``more or less satisfactory and he is
able to talk,'' said Alexander Batkov of the Ministry of Aviation
Industry.
   Batkov identified the pilot as Anatoly Kvochur, 37, and described
him as ``one of our best.''
   Batkov said this was only the second MiG-29 in history to crash.
The cause was not known, he said.
   ``The specialists must analyze the situation,'' Batkov said.
``When we see the film, we'll know what happened. It is too early to
ask questions yet.''
   Air show officials said there were no plans to suspend further
demonstrations.
   The most serious crash in the recent history of the biennial air
show was in 1973, when a Soviet supersonic Tupolev 144 exploded in
flight, killing the six-man crew and seven people in the nearby
village of Goussainville, where it hit the ground.
   On Aug. 28, 1988, 70 people died after three Italian Air Force
stunt jets collided at a Ramstein Air Base air show in West Germany.
One plane plowed into spectators at the event.
   Those who witnessed today's crash said the MiG apparently lost a
wing or an engine.
   The two MiG 29s at the air show arrived on Monday as part of a
large contingent of Soviet aircraft on display.
   John Wood of Woburn, Mass., a pilot and president of Thermetics,
an air show exhibitor, said the twin-engine plane was making a
``very high-performance routine'' which included vertical climbs on
engine power alone.
   ``The pilot was putting it through a very punishing routine,'' he
said, adding that the jet might have suffered structural failure.
   Even before the show opened, Soviet jet fighters were performing
aerobatics in the skies above the airport north of Paris that
appeared to astound industry professionals.
   The MiG-29 was the hit of the Farnsworth Air Show held earlier
this year in England.
   According to Jane's All the World's Aircraft 1988-89, the
single-seat combat jet has been used since 1985, and replaced
MiG-21s and MiG-23s.
   About 450 MiG-29s are in service and 44 have been delievered to
India, according to Jane's.
   The dogfighter is powered by two turbofan engines and can carry
six medium- or close-range air-to-air missiles. It can also carry
bombs and rockets.
   On May 20, Soviet air force pilot Alexander Zuyev stole a MiG-29
from an airfield north of the Soviet Black Sea coastal city of
Batumi and flew to Turkey. Turkish officials refused a request by
U.S. military experts to examine the plane before it was returned to
the Soviet Union.

   Nearly 200 graduating high school
seniors refused to have their outdoor commencement postponed because
of rain. They demanded their diplomas so they could get on with
life, or at least go to the beach.
   All 206 graduating seniors at Oconee High School had signed a
petition requesting that alternate arrangements be made in case rain
threatened the ceremony Tuesday night on the northeast Georgia's
school's football field, said senior Tisha Layne.
   When a thunderstorm rolled in minutes before the ceremony,
Superintendent S.H. Sanders announced the commencement was postponed
for one day, and he left. But as many as 1,000 relatives and 197
students crowded into a gymnasium and chanted for Principal Tony
Dukes to hand out diplomas informally.
   ``Twice I tried to call it off,'' Dukes said, ``and then I
decided to hand out the diplomas.''
   Many of the students were scheduled to leave for Myrtle Beach,
S.C., early Wednesday.
   An official ceremony was held Wednesday night, with only 27
students in attendance.
   School board Chairman Jerry Studdard said Dukes did the right
thing. ``In my opinion, a very volatile situation was diffused,'' he
said.

   Ford Motor Co. has recalled 119,000 Mercury
Cougars and Ford Thunderbirds, including a model selected as Motor
Trend magazine's Car of the Year, because of brake or rear
suspension problems.
   The automaker Wednesday said it knows of no accidents or injuries
because of the problems.
   Spokesman Mike Parris said the cars were assembled in Lorain,
Ohio, between October 1988 and March 1989. Five percent to 10
percent of the cars were the Thunderbird SC, or Super Coupe, named
Motor Trend's Car of the Year in January.
   The company said that in a full turn at less than 5 mph, the
front suspension of the Cougars and Thunderbirds could hit part of
the brake mechanism, decreasing the brakes' effectiveness the next
time they are applied.
   Of those recalled, about 11,250 Thunderbirds and Cougars made in
mid-January also will be checked for a part that could cause the
rear suspension to fall apart.
   The company said 133 rear-suspension knuckles were heated
improperly by a supplier, which could result in cracks and failure
of the suspension. A suspension knuckle is an arm that attaches the
wheel assembly to the frame.

<HEAD>Rostenkowski Signals Willingness to Discuss Tax Question with Bush</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, who traditionally has
viewed the capital-gains tax preference as the ultimate plaything of
the rich, is signaling a change of heart may be on the way _ if the
price is right.
   The price might require President Bush to back away from his
campaign pledge not to raise taxes. Even in that unlikely event,
some members of the House Ways and Means Committee, which
Rostenkowski chairs, said Thursday they would be reluctant to accept
any such bargain, even as part of a deficit-reduction measure.
   For the moment, however, Rostenkowski, D-Ill., is indicating a
willingness to at least discuss the question with Bush, a former
committee colleague.
   ``He doesn't like a lower tax rate for capital gains,'' an aide
to Rostenkowski insisted Thursday. ``But could it ever be
acceptable? The answer is yes _ if the president offered in return
something so attractive to Democrats that they couldn't turn it
down,'' added the aide, who spoke only on condition he not be
identified by name.
   The aide elaborated on Rostenkowski's position after the
chairman, in separate interviews Wednesday with The New York Times
and The Wall Street Journal, suggested some kind of capital-gains
cut could be acceptable as part of a deficit-reduction plan.
   The aide said he is not sure Rostenkowski's position has been
changed all that much. Despite a long record of criticizing the
capital-gains benefit _ ``I'm not about to tell the wage earners in
Chicago that they should pay a higher tax than stockbrokers,'' he
said in February, when Bush called for the change _ Rostenkowski
``never says never,'' the staff member explained.
   The staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that 80
percent of the tax cut under Bush's capital-gains proposal would go
to those with incomes over $100,000 a year. Those under $50,000
would get 8.6 percent.
   ``That's traditional Republican economics,'' said Rep. Byron
Dorgan, D-N.D., a Ways and Means member, who said he is not sure the
committee is anywhere near a consensus for a capital-gains cut.
   If the chairman has changed his stance, it apparently is because
of the budget deficit.
   The Ways and Means Committee has been directed by Congress to
raise $5.3 billion in extra revenues for the budget year that begins
next Oct. 1. If several expiring tax benefits are to be renewed, the
figure will go higher.
   Bush has proposed his own package of relatively minor revenue
raisers, including higher Social Security taxes on some state and
local government workers and renewal of the expiring tax on
telephone service.
   The president also has called for taxing capital gains _ profits
from the sale of stock and certain property _ at a lower rate than
applies to wages. Unlike most tax cuts, he insists, such a reduction
would raise revenue by encouraging more economic activity.
   A great number of economists don't buy that argument over the
long run, including some who advise Congress. However, Congress'
experts and Bush's experts agree that such a rate cut would raise
more money in the first year simply by encouraging people to unload
some investments they had been holding for a while.
   Rostenkowski has discussed the possibility of cutting the
capital-gains rate for one year, perhaps two. That would be followed
by restoring a higher rate but ``indexing'' capital gains so that in
the future, an investor would not be taxed on profits that were
caused solely by inflation.
   Congressional economists say such a plan would cost the
government revenues after the first year. Bush, presumably, would be
expected to go along with some kind of other tax increase to make up
that loss.
   ``I don't know if I am prepared to make a tradeoff on capital
gains,'' said Rep. Robert Matsui, D-Calif., saying it could cause a
return to the abusive tax shelters that were all but wiped out by
the 1986 tax overhaul. ``And a multiyear reduction would mean we
would be sacrificing future years' revenues for one year of deficit
reduction.''
   Dorgan also said good tax policy must not be sacrificed. ``We
just went through tax reform, where the tax system was so riddled
with loopholes for the rich, and we spent a lot of time correcting
that national disgrace,'' he said.
   Wiping out the special capital-gains benefit and the tax shelters
it fed is often cited as one of the major plusses of the 1986
overhaul. Rostenkowski has said on several occasions that restoring
the capital-gains break would open the door to junking the new law.

<HEAD>Pi Reportedly Calculated to Record 480 Million Decimal Places</HEAD>

   Two researchers say they have cut themselves a
record slice of pi: 480 million decimal places of one of the most
famous numbers in mathematics.
   That exceeds the mark of about 201 million decimal places
produced last year in Japan, David Chudnovsky of Columbia University
said Thursday.
   Pi is the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter.
The infinite string of digits begins with 3.14159, and contains no
obvious pattern.
   The newly calculated number would stretch for 600 miles if
printed, Columbia University said.
   Chudnovsky and his brother Gregory, associate research scientists
at Columbia, came up with the number after devising a new algorithm,
which is a series of mathematical steps.
   The algorithm lets researchers calculate more and more decimal
places for pi by simply adding to an existing string, rather than
having to start from scratch, Chudnovsky said.
   It also has a self-correcting feature that can check whether the
pi calculation is on the right track while the calculation is in
progress, he said.
   The researchers checked their calculation by running the
algorithm through two supercomputers with different hardware and
software, Chudnovsky said. When the results were compared,
``everything perfectly fitted together.''
   So what good is knowing this number?
   ``We can use it as a very stringent test for testing the
performance of hardware and software,'' said Chudnovsky, who called
pi calculations ``the ultimate stress test.''
   And by calculating pi out to great lengths, researchers can
investigate whether the string of digits is random or contains some
hidden pattern, he said.
   ``We sort of see more of the tail of the dragon,'' he said.
   The new work is to be presented next week at a conference on
computers and mathematics at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology.
   Peter Borwein, associate professor of mathematics at Dalhousie
University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, said the new work
appears to be a record.
   Tackling the digits of pi ``has become something of a benchmark
in computational sophistication,'' he said in a telephone interview.
   ``It seems like since there have been computers, people have been
using them to compute the digits of pi.''

<HEAD>Baker Calls for Soviet Response on NATO Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III, saying
``the time is ripe,'' called on Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev
today to respond to President Bush's proposals to slash conventional
military forces in Europe.
   Baker, in remarks to the National Press Club, said the United
States is looking for such a response when the Soviet leader visits
West Germany next week.
   At last week's NATO summit, Bush put forward an elaborate,
four-part plan for reducing East-West troop strength and non-nuclear
forces in Europe.
   ``We urged the Soviets to reduce unilaterally their short-range
nuclear systems to our levels. Next week, General Secretary
Gorbachev can sustain this new spirit by answering our call, by
announcing a real cut in Soviet SNF (Short-Range Nuclear) forces,''
Baker said.
   ``The time is ripe for Mr. Gorbachev to respond positively to the
opportunities presented by NATO's initiatives. Indeed, we look for
him to do so when he travels to the Federal Republic of Germany next
week,'' Baker added.
   The summit meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization had
provided a major lift for Bush, who had been criticized for failing
to respond effectively to Gorbachev's much-publicized arms control
initiatives.
   The session also eased a major controversy between the United
States and West Germany. Bush was able to smooth over the rift
between the allies by agreeing to negotiations on the short-range
nuclear weapons, which are primarily based in Germany and, if used,
would probably explode on German soil.
   Under the compromise, the United States agreed to enter into the
negotiations to achieve a ``partial reduction'' of the weapons once
the implementation of the conventional arms agreement was ``under
way.''
   In the view of U.S. and British officials, that also meant that
the short-range weapons would not be eliminated, and would remain in
the NATO arsenal.
   Under Bush's proposal, the Western alliance would agree to a
ceiling of 275,000 on the number of Soviet and American troops on
foreign soil.
   That would amount to a reduction of some 30,000 U.S. troops and
325,000 Soviet troops.
   Besides his proposals on troop cuts, the president proposed that
the scope of the talks be broadened to include aircraft, a
longstanding Soviet suggestion.
   In speech to the United Nations last Dec. 7, Gorbachev said that
by the end of 1990, the Soviets would withdraw six tank divisions
from the Warsaw Pact nations of East Germany, Hungary and
Czechoslovakia and reduce Soviet troops in Eastern Europe by 50,000.
   The United States and Britain have insisted that NATO retain
short-range nuclear missiles in order to offset the Warsaw Pact's
far larger conventional forces.
   NATO has 88 short-range Lance launchers and their 700
nuclear-tipped missiles in West Germany, while the Warsaw Pact has
1,600 short-range launchers.

   The commandant of the U.S. Army War College has
been tapped for a promotion and new assignment as a top aide to the
Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Pentagon said Thursday.
   Assuming Senate confirmation, Maj. Gen. Howard D. Graves will be
promoted to lieutenant general and become assistant to the chairman
of the Joint Chiefs, the Pentagon said.
   Graves, 49, is a native of Roaring Springs, Texas, and currently
posted at the War College at Carlisle Barracks, Pa.
   The Pentagon also announced President Bush has nominated two Army
Medical Corps officers for promotions.
   Brig. Gen. Frederick N. Bussey, commanding general at the
Eisenhower Army Medical Center at Fort Gordon, Ga., has been
nominated to receive his second star and the rank of major general,
the Pentagon said.
   Col. Leslie M. Burger, commander and corps surgeon at the Fort
Hood, Texas, Army medical activity, has been nominated for the
one-star rank of brigadier general.

   He shows them movies. He feeds them popcorn. He
takes them on tours of the first family's living quarters. He knows
their first names.
   George Bush's relationship with reporters isn't a honeymoon, it's
a courtship _ or maybe a seduction.
   So far in his presidency, Bush has given reporters what they most
want: access. But he hasn't given them enough of what they want
almost as much: news.
   Before his first big-production, prime-time press conference on
Thursday night, Bush already was meeting often, usually once a week,
with reporters in brief daytime sessions.
   But because his administration hadn't framed its own policies on
most issues and because Bush was cautious in commenting on foreign
affairs, what the president had to say did not tend to generate big
headlines.
   ``For a while you had an awful lot of griping, `Yes, he's a nice
guy, he's given us access, but where are the stories?''' commented
Stephen Hess on Thursday. A senior fellow at the Brookings
Institution, Hess studies the relationship between press and
government and is the author of ``The Washington Reporters.''
   ``There was almost a slight longing for the bad old days under
Ronald Reagan, where he didn't see them much or respect them, but he
gave them lots of stories,'' Hess said.
   That changed with Bush's trip to Europe last month for a summit
with allied leaders and his dramatic proposals for cuts in the
standing armies of East and West.
   As he had promised he eventually would, Bush started making
presidential-size news.
   A Washington hand for three decades, Bush is comfortable with the
press. And, a master of detail, he tends to give more complete
answers than Reagan offered.
   Bush calls reporters who cover the White House by their first
names, has some in for off-the-record sessions, sometimes invites a
few upstairs for a not-yet-released movie and popcorn and soft
drinks.
   Hardly a week passes that he doesn't field their questions. On
Monday, when he called a news conference on 15 minutes notice to
announce sanctions against China, reporter David Hoffman of The
Washington Post arrived late and asked a question that ended,
``Could you explain what the point of doing that is?''
   Chided Bush: ``I already did, David. You missed it.'' Then he
went on to make his point again.
   That kind of relaxed relationship is the mark of an expert, Hess
said.
   ``The really good Washington politicians affect an easy-going
banter, a light humor, and the one who personified it best was
Franklin Roosevelt,'' he said. Such politicians, he said, ``know
that reporters are very easy to flatter.''
   Roosevelt mesmerized the press. He met with reporters in those
pre-television days nearly 1,000 times in his 13 years in office.
   Hess noted that Bush is following almost all the recommendations
of a report last October by the Harvard Commission on Presidential
News Conferences, composed of journalists and professors who spent a
year studying how to revive a 75-year-old institution.
   The commission said that under Reagan the press conference had
fallen into ``a serious state of disrepair.'' Reagan formally met
reporters infrequently. He let 5{ months, during the Iran-Contra
affair, slide by without a news conference.
   The commission's principal proposal: ``frequent, routine and
undramatic'' news conferences.
   The panel said presidents should meet with the media twice a
month, and do it during daylight hours ``to reduce the temperature
and encourage more substantive and useful exchanges.'' It called for
limiting prime-time news conferences to six a year.
   Hess said ``the massive news conference'' generally doesn't
generate much news.
   ``It isn't a very good way to get information out,'' he said.
``It's a way for the people to see a president in action, so it
serves him and it serves the egos of the press corps. But there are
better ways to make news.''

<HEAD>Japanese Magazine Breaks Precedence with Report on Prime Minister</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The respected magazine Sunday Mainichi broke with
Japanese journalism tradition this week by reporting Prime Minister
Sousuke Uno kept a highly paid geisha as his mistress three years
ago.
   Uno, who took office just a week ago, denied the report, but its
publication broke a long-held code of silence in the Japanese news
media about publishing or broadcasting reports on such liasons by
government officials.
   It is not unusual for Japanese men, especially if they are
wealthy, to keep mistresses, while their wives are expected to
remain faithful.
   Shuntaro Torigoe, the magazine's editor in chief, said he
published the article because he wanted to bring issues of social
ethics into the public arena.
   ``We also want Americans, who are critical of politicians, to
know that in Japan we are changing,'' he added.
   The story generated about 100 telephone calls to the magazine's
office in four days. Some 80 percent of the callers supported the
Mainichi's decision to publish the story, while the rest objected to
the story as a violation of Uno's privacy.
   Sunday Mainichi quoted the woman as saying Uno had paid her
300,000 yen ($2,100) a month over a four-month period in 1985. The
magazine said it did not identify her by name at her request. It
said she was 40 years old. Uno is 66.
   ``He is not a man of noble character,'' the article quoted the
woman as saying. ``I don't want him to use politics the same way he
treated me.''
   Geishas are women highly trained in music, dance and making
conversation. While they are not prostitutes, some develop intimate
relationships with customers who become their patrons.
   While most major newspapers and television networks avoided the
Uno-Geisha story, some of Japan's sensationalist tabloids compared
it to the sex scandal involving Democratic presidential aspirant
Gary Hart in the United States.
   ``If it happened in the United States he would have to go,'' the
Daily Gendai said of Uno.
   Uno was named prime minister June 2 after a long search for a
scandal-free politician to replace the tainted administration of
Noboru Takeshita, who resigned to take responsibility for a massive
Recruit bribery scandal.
   The geisha story is the only blemish so far in Uno's case.
   He denied the liason with the geisha.
   ``It's out of the question,'' Uno told the Tokyo Shimbun.
   Although the magazine is a Sunday publication it has been on
newsstands since Monday.
   Uno has not been asked about the article during question periods
in the Diet, Japan's parliament.
   Kuniko Inoguchi, a professor of political science at Sophia
University, said that in the past 15 years keeping mistresses has
come to be considered against the social ethic.
   ``If you are in a prestigious position in politics or business,
you have to be clean both with money and with sex,'' Ms. Inoguchi
said. ``It's now part of the general code of conduct.''
   But she added that the Recruit scandal, in which a conglomerate
allegedly sought to buy favors from politicians and bureaucrats with
cut-rate stocks and political donations, may have worn the Japanese
down.
   ``Now that the Recruit scandal has come to an end, people might
be a little tired of picking on politicians right now,'' she said.
   Takako Doi, the chairman of the opposition Japan Socialist Party
and the most powerful woman in politics, refused to comment on the
report.

<HEAD>Alaska Senator Criticizes Housing Allowance Policy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Republican senator lashed out Thursday at the
Pentagon system of providing a housing allowance to military
personnel living outside installations, charging that the current
policy is unfair to residents of economically-depressed areas.
   ``I've never seen worse stupidity in my life,'' Sen. Ted Stevens,
R-Alaska, said at a Senate Appropriations defense subcommittee
hearing on military manpower.
   The object of Stevens' ire was the Variable Housing Allowance, a
stipend that military personnel forced to live off base during a
three-to-four year stint can use to help defray the cost of housing.
   The allowance is based on 80 percent of local housing costs and
changes annually depending on the housing market.
   For military personnel with mortgages or extended leases and
living in the Southwest and Alaska, two areas hardest hit by
problems in the oil industry, the allowance has decreased as housing
prices have dropped.
   Stevens was particularly angered by the Pentagon's recent
decision to distribute $77 million in surplus allowances equally
among all recipients rather than targeting those who have had their
allowance cut.
   ``This is the most unfair system I've ever seen,'' Stevens said.
   Dr. David J. Berteau, deputy assistant secretary of defense for
resource management and support, barely getting a word in, said the
effect of penalizing those in the Southwest and Alaska is ``the
exception rather than the rule.''
   Stevens also criticized the fiscal 1990 budget's proposed level
of $3.609 billion for stationing military personnel and their
dependents overseas, an increase of nearly 10 percent over the
$3.289 billion earmarked for fiscal 1989.
   He argued against upgrading housing facilities overseas at the
same time the Defense Department will be closing bases and troops
may be reduced if the NATO alliance reaches an agreement with the
Warsaw Pact to reduce manpower in Europe.
   What's more, he said, the number of military dependents is
expected to remain constant at about 473,000.
   But Berteau, responding to Stevens statement' that many military
personnel in Japan and West Germany employee servants, said:
   ``Those increases are targeted very specifically at a hugh chunk
of lower enlisted who don't have the kind of money that can support
their dependents in any manner that you described with servants and
maids,''
   Stevens replied:
   ``I think it's unreal to put us in a position of closing down
production lines for new systems ... and building new quarters
overseas.''
   Berteau then told the senator that ``many are in very sad shape''
and argued that better facilities are necessary to maintain high
morale, attract recruits and keep them in the services.
   But Stevens said ``they've been living in these quarters for 10
years and in this very tight budget year you decide to build new
ones.''

   Murals at the Capitol depicting the
``Twelve Labors of Hercules,'' which so offended legislators that
they were covered with drapes, will be displayed for the summer and
then removed, an official said.
   The murals in the state House of Representatives, which is in
recess, will be uncovered June 16 through Sept. 29 before crews
remove, crate and store the panels, said Ron McQueen, assistant
director of the state Department of General Administration.
   The state paid $100,000 to have the murals created in 1981, but
some lawmakers found them inappropriate for the building or were
offended by the murals' nudity. The artwork represents the 12 tasks
performed by the mythological figure Hercules to obtain immortality.
   The state has spent another $100,000 to cover the murals with
gold drapes and to fight a lawsuit that sought to bar their removal.
King County Superior Court Judge Terrence Carroll ruled in December
that if the murals could be removed without damage, the state was
within its legal rights to take them down and display them elsewhere.

   A group of lawmakers urged President Bush on
Thursday to raise U.S. concerns over alleged human rights abuses in
East Timor during his White House meeting Friday with Indonesian
President Suharto.
   ``Our concern is that failure to mention the situation in East
Timor would signal a lack of United States attention to the serious
human rights and humanitarian issues in that troubled territory,''
100 House Democrats and 18 Republicans told Bush in a letter.
   They said severe human rights abuses including executions, rape
and beatings are a recurring problem in the former Portuguese
colony. East Timor was invaded by Indonesia in 1975 and annexed the
following year.

   Nugzar Ruhadze has no inhibitions when it comes to
questioning Americans about their capitalist lifestyles.
   Take the time the Soviet reporter, on loan to an Atlanta
television station, asked a construction worker if his family was
proud of his job as a manual laborer. Or when he asked an uptown
mansion owner if she was ashamed of being wealthy.
   ``Always I go back to the office and they tell me, `We can't
believe you asked that,''' Ruhadze said. ``But I am surprised that
they are surprised. I ask questions if I want to know, but maybe you
would rather not know than maybe embarrass somebody with a
question.''
   Embarrassed or not, both interview subjects answered the
questions about their social status. The laborer said his family
indeed was proud of him; the wealthy woman confessed to sometimes
feeling shame.
   Ruhadze, the first Soviet journalist to work for an American TV
station, airs such brash reports three times a week on WXIA
television.
   The journalist from Soviet Georgia can find similarities between
Soviet and American culture everywhere, even in Memorial Day, which
he compared to the Day of Victory celebrated in the Soviet union.
   ``Yes, we do it in very much the same way,'' he whispered
huskily. ``These days remind you we're not rid of wars _ they can
still occur. I saw this old veteran, he was crying, sobbing, a hero
of war, but he showed the wounds had not healed.''
   Ruhadze, 47, said he hopes such reports during his visit to
Atlanta will help dispel distrust still inherent in many Soviets and
Americans.
   ``I have a boy, 3{, and I want him never to be afraid of anything
called American,'' he said. ``I want him to take that as part of his
own culture, which is called `human.' ''
   His reports often center on cultural differences.
   ``There are so many,'' he said. ``Things you take for granted,
like nursing homes. I can never imagine my mother, who's 71, living
out of my home even if there was the most luxurious nursing home.''
   WXIA operations manager Billy Otwell said Ruhadze's reports are
unusual because they do not have scripts. Although Ruhadze speaks
fluent English, he had no experience in American news coverage.
   So Ruhadze's producers tape his conversations with Americans and
then interview him about what he thought was most interesting in the
story. Those taped, edited comments form his stories.
   In one such story, his conversation with local teen-agers on the
differences between Soviet and American high schools touched on the
problem of teen pregnancy.
   ``I asked them why girls were always in a hurry to become women
when as soon as they are women they want to be girls again,'' he
said. ``They just laughed; they couldn't answer that. It shows a
problem.''
   Usually, though, Ruhadze can find a good side to many of the
problems he discovers in American society.
   ``Everybody here tries to live in separate houses,'' he said.
``But to do that, they are in debt. This is a credit society _ you
are always in debt.
   ``But maybe that is good,'' he added. ``You know you have to
work, and that is good.''
   Ruhadze, who is host of a talk show in Tbilisi called
``Roundtable,'' will be in Atlanta until June 23. As part of WXIA's
exchange program with Atlanta's sister city, Tbilisi, reporter
Simeon Smith traveled to Soviet Georgia earlier this spring. Among
other things, he filmed a rash of anti-government ethnic riots that
broke out while he was there.
   Otwell said the station tries to air reports Smith made during
his trip in conjunction with Ruhadze's look at the same topics _
like driving styles.
   ``The (Soviet) driving is bad. Simeon would close his eyes; he
was scared out of his guts,'' Ruhadze said. ``But here, the traffic
is heavy of course, but it's not dangerous if you do defensive
driving.''
   One topic Ruhadze wants to take up before he leaves is American
funerals, and the modern cemetery with no tombstones above ground.
   ``I saw what I call a new American cemetery,'' he said. ``It was
a beautiful hillock with beautiful flowers. When I stopped, I saw a
big plate in the ground.
   ``I just stopped and sat there,'' he added. ``This showed the
American way of life _ they save the land, save money and make all
people equal.''

   Polish voters have rejected Prime Minister
Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski and 32 other top officials of the communist
coalition who ran unopposed in elections, according to official
results released today.
   The results by the National Election Commission indicated that 33
of the 35 high officials of the Communist Party and its allies were
rejected in the parliamentary election Sunday. The candidates failed
to get the 50 percent of the vote required because many citizens
crossed out their names on the ballot.
   Despite their losses, Rakowski and the others will retain their
regular government posts. But the victory by Solidarity candidates
gives the opposition power to veto legislation and even prevent that
veto from being overridden.
   Only two coalition candidates were were elected: Peasant Party
member Mikolaj Kozakiewicz, who is a communist ally but who has
gained a reputation for independence; and communist administrative
law judge Adam Zielinski.
   The results were released as Solidarity leader Lech Walesa was in
Warsaw to meet with Interior Minister Gen. Czeslaw Kiszczak and
other officials to discuss how the rejected candidates might be
seated in spite of their defeat.
   Solidarity's candidates won an overwhelming victory in Eastern
Europe's first democratic parliamentary elections in 40 years. The
union led the opposition after it was legalized under a pact with
the government.
   In all, 165 deputies were elected to the 460-member Sejm, or
lower house, in the first round: 160 from Solidarity and five from
the communist or allied parties. In the new, freely elected
100-member Senate, 92 senators were picked in the first round, all
from Solidarity.
   Besides Kozakiewicz and Zielinski from the Communist Party list,
just three party or allied candidates running for 264 contested
seats reserved for the party coalition managed to get 50 percent in
the first round. The other 261 will be decided in runoffs June 18.
   By comparison, only one of the Solidarity-backed candidates to
the Sejm running for 161 seats reserved for the opposition failed to
get more than 50 percent in the first round.
   Solidarity hopes to win that seat and the eight remaining Senate
seats in the second round. It also says it will back certain
sympathetic communist or allied candidates in the runoff to build on
its electoral success.
   Solidarity has indicated it would like to find a compromise to
seat the rejected communist officials in keeping with its previous
agreement to allow the communists and their allies 65 percent of the
Sejm. The union is also worried the Sejm might lose its importance
if top party leaders were absent.
   In addition to Rakowski and Kiszczak, the seven other members of
the 17-member Politburo who were on the communist coalition were
also rejected.
   Poland's leader, Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, was quoted today by a
British newspaper, the Independent, as conceding that election
results were ``not favorable'' to the communist Polish United
Workers Party.
   But he was quoted as saying the outcome would not hinder ``the
bold historical experiment we have begun'' and calling for further
``dialogue and compromise.'' It was Jaruzelski's first public
comments on the election.
   He also said the next parliamentary election, set for 1993,
should be totally free and that the Communist Party would have to
consider relinquishing power in Poland if its candidates again lose.

   Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis, America's most
famous duo in the 1940s and 1950s before they split up, had a rare
and poignant reunion on a Las Vegas stage.
   ``Here's to 72 years of joy you've given the world, and why we
broke up, I'll never know,'' Lewis told Martin when he presented him
with a birthday cake Wednesday night.
   ``You surprised me,'' said Martin, who was obviously overwhelmed.
``I love you, and I mean it.''
   The two made entertainment history beginning in 1946, with singer
Martin playing straight man to comic Lewis, but they split in 1956
and have rarely appeared together since then.
   Lewis paid the surprise visit at the end of Martin's performance
at Bally's Hotel and Casino on the Las Vegas Strip. Both Martin and
Lewis perform regularly at the resort, although not together. Martin
appears solo and Lewis appears with Sammy Davis Jr.
   Martin was speechless when Lewis walked onto the stage, wheeling
a giant birthday cake and complaining about the singer's act running
too long.
   The two embraced, traded banter, then hugged again.
   The last time the two appeared together was in 1976, when Frank
Sinatra surprised Lewis by bringing Martin on the nationally
televised Labor Day Muscular Dystrophy telethon that Lewis holds
here annually.
   The reunion brought a standing ovation from a near-capacity crowd
in the Celebrity showroom.
   ``Jerry knew that it was Dean's birthday and wanted to wish him
happy birthday,'' said Joe Stabile, Lewis' long-time manager. ``Dean
knew nothing about it. It's just something Jerry wanted to do.''
   Martin lives in Los Angeles and Lewis lives in Las Vegas.

<HEAD>W.Va. Governor Caperton Says Divorcing Wife After 23 Years</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Gaston Caperton announced Thursday
that he is divorcing his wife, Dee, after 23 years of marriage.
   Caperton, 49, cited irreconcilable differences for his decision
to divorce the state's first lady, a former Miss West Virginia who
served two years in the state House of Delegates before Caperton was
elected governor last fall.
   ``At the governor's request, during the separation, Dee Caperton
is residing at the Caperton residence in Charleston,'' a statement
said.
   ``This is personally painful for me and my family,'' Mrs.
Caperton told reporters. ``But I want you to know it has been an
honor to represent the state of West Virginia and I regret that I
will no longer be performing the duties of first lady.''
   She did not take any questions.
   ``My record of public service precedes and is independent of my
husband's career,'' she said. ``I will continue to serve this state
as an advocate for education, children and women.''
   The governor's statement said Mrs. Caperton will continue to work
on women's problems and will continue her work as a Democratic
National committeewoman.
   The Capertons have two sons, ages 21 and 19.

   Three allegedly killed or robbed for radical causes. One was
accused of killing a police officer. One was charged with poisoning
his estranged wife's drink.
   They are five FBI fugitives wanted longer than John Emil List,
the church-going accountant authorities say was arrested in Virginia
last week for the 1971 fatal shootings of his wife, mother and three
children in Westfield, N.J.
   As in the List case, investigators are hoping to pry these
fugitives from their new lives.
   They follow leads, thicken files, contact colleagues around the
world and prepare their cases as proposals for the television show
``America's Most Wanted,'' the fugitive showcase that prompted a tip
leading to List's arrest.
   List, who claims he is Robert P. Clark, was turned over to the
custody of Virginia authorities today and ordered back in court July
6 for a hearing on New Jersey's request for extradition.
   The FBI maintains a file of about 100 long-term fugitives,
including the 10 most wanted, deemed worthy of special attention.
Most of these cases have reached dead ends.
   ``There becomes a time when you're literally down to publicity,''
said Thomas Bush, northeast supervisor for the FBI's fugitive unit
in Washington, D.C. ``You've done every kind of record check you can
do.''
   If such long-term fugitives have anything in common, it's a
``different kind of personality'' that allows them to cut all ties
with relatives and their past, said Bush, who has been chasing
fugitives for a decade.
   The oldest case on the books is perhaps most tantalizing for law
enforcement officials.
   Joseph Michael Maloney went to his estranged wife's house one day
in 1967 in Rochester, N.Y., for their son's fifth birthday party.
The next day, June Fisk Maloney went to a hospital feeling ill, and
died a few days later.
   Police allege Maloney served his wife an orange juice cocktail
poisoned with wood alcohol.
   ``It was an especially horrible death,'' said Monroe County
District Attorney Howard Relin.
   Maloney was arrested but escaped from a hospital while undergoing
psychiatric tests and moved to Ireland, apparently in the early
1970s. He changed his name to Michael O'Shea, married and fathered
two children, authorities said.
   He was under surveillance for 11 years in anticipation of an
extradition treaty with the United States, Irish authorities said.
In 1985, he was arrested but Ireland's high court overturned the
treaty and Maloney was freed. Relin said recent reports have placed
the 53-year-old former handyman and builder in Canada.
   Relin now is seeking help from ``America's Most Wanted.''
   Another case being prepared for the program does not go back as
far as the List case, but it is strikingly similar.
   William Bradford Bishop Jr., 52, a former foreign service
officer, is wanted for the 1976 bludgeoning deaths of his wife,
mother and three sons at their home in Potomac, Md., an affluent
Washington, D.C., suburb.
   Bishop, like List, is well remembered in his old community.
   ``You mention Bradford Bishop around here to anyone who's a
long-time resident _ they'll know,'' said Montgomery County Police
Officer George Ludington.
   The four other fugitives are:
   _ George Ernesto Lopez, 39, wanted for the 1969 fatal shooting of
a San Francisco police officer investigating a burglary ring.
   _ Leo Frederick Burt, 41, wanted for the 1970 Vietnam War protest
bombing of a building housing the Army Mathematics Research Center
at the University of Wisconsin in Madison. A researcher inside was
killed.
   _ Richard B. Thomas, 43, wanted for the 1970 slaying of a
Philadelphia park police sergeant and the wounding of a patrolman.
He was a member of a group called the Black Unity Movement.
   _ Katherine Ann Power, 40, wanted for driving a getaway car in
connection with the 1970 robbery of $26,585 from a Boston bank,
where a police officer was killed in a burst of gunfire. The robbery
was believed carried out by a radical revolutionary group.

   After 23 years, in which he and his wife-to-be
raised eight children and collected 19 grandchildren, George W.
Amerson finally got married. But it wasn't easy.
   The couple, stymied in 1966 by a now defunct Georgia law
prohibiting interracial marriages, were almost delayed again, this
time by health problems. But the wedding went on Wednesday, although
the setting was not quite what Amerson and his bride and longtime
companion, Shirley, had planned.
   The vows were spoken at Amerson's bedside in the coronary
intensive care unit at Grady Memorial Hospital, where Amerson had
been admitted Tuesday night after complaining of chest pains.
   A half-dozen hospital staffers looked on as Amerson and his
bride, both 48, tied the knot in a brief ceremony, standing before a
minister beside the bed.
   The bride, dressed in a pink and white print dress and white
jacket, glided into the room on the arm of registered nurse Rochelle
G. Hersch, who arranged the ceremony and also served as witness.
   The bride carried a bouquet of pink and white carnations; the
groom, who suffered a heart attack two years ago, wore pajamas and
was attached to a heart monitor.
   The Amersons had planned to be married at their home in southeast
Atlanta on Wednesday, their 23rd anniversary together.
   The Amersons met in 1965 and began living together a year later.
They would have wed then, he said, but Georgia law prohibited
interracial marriages until 1979. So they decided to change her name
legally, and she took his.
   ``We had always wanted a marriage license,'' Amerson said. ``So
this anniversary I planned to give her a license. I decided to make
her legal,'' he chuckled, winking at his bride as they sat on his
hospital bed. ``I decided to make an honest woman out of her.''
   ``And I decided to make an honest man out of you,'' she replied.
   ``We wanted it to come through on this day,'' Amerson said. ``The
Grady employees made our wish come true.''

   The City Council has endorsed the idea of
appointing a commissioner to oversee all experiments on animals and
make unannounced laboratory inspections.
   The council Monday also agreed that all animal experiments here
should be required to meet federal standards for care and testing of
animals. Currently, only those institutions getting federal funds
are subject to the standards.
   The proposals were drawn up by a panel consisting of a
veterinarian, a lawyer and a Harvard professor. City Manager Robert
W. Healy said the city solicitor has been asked to draft an
ordinance and a vote could come early next week.
   The animal-rights measure would affect Harvard and the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology along with 11 other businesses
and institutions.
   Most of the institutions, including Harvard and MIT, already are
subject to federal standards for humane care and experimentation.

<HEAD>VOA Beaming TV Signal to Chinese Military Bases</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In response to the Chinese crisis, the U.S.
government's Voice of America is beaming television signals to the
People's Republic, the first time it has ever taken such a step, the
director said Thursday.
   The signal is going directly to about 2,000 satellite dishes
operated largely by the People's Liberation Army, although there is
no way to tell whether the transmission is being watched by the
military or passed along other channels, said VOA director Richard
Carlson.
   The U.S. Embassy is receiving the signal ``loud and clear'' on a
satellite dish in Beijing, he said. The transmission began Tuesday.
   The broadcast of news to the military is significant because of
reports that units backing the pro-democracy demonstrators may have
exchanged fire with units supporting the crackdown.
   ``We are sending a television signal that is available to every
major military installation in China,'' Carlson told The Associated
Press in a telephone interview. The signal originates in the United
States and bounces off satellites over the Indian and Pacific
Oceans, covering all of China.
   ``It makes available to the Chinese military information about
what is going on in China, information that may not otherwise be
available to the Chinese military,'' he said.
   Television and radio sets are not built to receive direct
satellite signals. The transmissions must be received by satellite
dishes and re-broadcast in a signal accessible to individual
receivers, said Carlson.
   The VOA, which broadcasts radio programs in many languages around
the world, including transmissions targeted at communist nations,
has never used a television signal before, said Carlson.
   ``It seemed like the right thing to do,'' said Carlson, who made
the decision and informed a special State Department task force
monitoring events in China. ``The State Deparment is aware of it. No
one has objected.''
   The VOA normally beams eight hours of radio broadcasts daily in
Mandarin to China, but increased that to 11 hours in response to the
student demonstrations in Beijing.
   ``Chinese authorities have said that we have a regular listening
audience of 60 million. We believe that we are over 100 million now.
We are clearly the most pervasive non-Chinese source of news in the
country,'' said Carlson.
   VOA's television image shows a broadcaster reading the news, as
the Chinese-language script scrolls across the lower part of the
screen. VOA has not attempted to broadcast television images of the
demonstrations or the aftermath.
   During the unrest, said Carlson, Chinese authorities have tried
to jam VOA Chinese radio broadcasts. They have not tried to jam
VOA's English language broadcasts.
   VOA maintains a bureau with two correspondents in Beijing, and
uses other Western news services, which have been reporting a
different story than the official Chinese media.
   ``The Chinese media have been very dishonest about the student
demonstrations and the role of the military,'' said Carlson.
   ``Chinese media have said there were 300 dead, and that they were
mostly soldiers, which is not true. The Red Cross says 3,000 people
died,'' he said. Some Western sources in Beijing have estimated the
dead at 7,000.

<HEAD>Disputed List Says Indistrial Plants Pose Cancer Risk</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A House panel chairman Thursday distributed
federal data identifying 205 industrial plants as increasing cancer
risks through release of airborne toxic chemicals. The Environmental
Protection Agency quickly disputed his interpretations.
   An EPA spokesman said the information was old and incomplete, and
complained it was ``highly irresponsible'' to use it as ``reflective
of risks in the real world.''
   However, Rep. Henry A. Waxman, chairman of the House Energy and
Commerce environment subcommittee, said that even potentially
inaccurate figures should be released because they ``indicate the
enormity of the problem'' and represent a ``stunning demonstration
of the urgency of the public health threat.''
   Waxman, D-Calif., said at a news conference that toxic chemicals
present a cancer risk near the plants at least a thousand-fold
greater than levels accepted by experts.
   The plants on the list, compiled by the EPA, pose at least a
1-in-1,000 cancer risk to people getting maximum exposure for a
lifetime, while the EPA deems a risk of more than 1-in-a-million as
unacceptable.
   ``It's public information,'' Rep. Guy V. Molinari, R-N.Y., told
the news conference in defending release of the data. ``The public
has a right to know,'' added Rep. Mickey Leland, D-Texas.
   Leland, Molinari, Waxman and Rep. Jerry Sikorski, D-Minn.,
combined release of the figures with an announcement that they have
introduced legislation to control airborne toxic chemical releases.
   The bill would limit emissions from industrial sources and motor
vehicles, attempt to prevent accidental releases, protect the Great
Lakes, which have been seriously damaged by airborne toxic
chemicals, and control emissions from small businesses. Waxman plans
to incorporate the legislation into a comprehensive clean air bill
that also would address urban pollution and acid rain.
   The Bush administration is expected to introduce its own clean
air proposals next week, including what EPA spokesman David Cohen
described as a ``strong air toxics component.''
   Cohen said the data on the individual facilities were complied to
develop computer models to compare health risks from one plant to
another.
   ``The figures ... were never used to reflect risks in the real
world,'' Cohen said, and ``any suggestion those data are reflective
of risks in the real world is an entirely erroneous interpretation
... a highly irresponsible interpretation.''
   The Chemical Manufacturers Association said, ``To imply that
these estimates depict the real risks of living near one of the
plants is not just exaggeration but an outright misuse of data to
deliberately alarm people.''
   The estimates assume a 70-year lifetime exposure to a chemical at
its maximum exposure level at a plant.
   The figures indicated that 205 facilities posed cancer risks for
the most exposed individuals that may exceed 1 in 1,000. Forty-five
of these facilities had maximum individual risks of greater than 1
in 100, and one had at least a 1-in-10 risk.
   The estimates represent evaluations of the maximum individual
cancer risk that might arise from the inhalation of a single toxic
air pollutant from an individual facility.
   For example, a risk estimate of 1 in 1,000 means that one person
out of 1,000 could be expected to contract cancer from maximum
exposure to a single pollutant.
   Waxman said that because of the potential inaccuracy of the data,
he didn't know whether the problems at individual plants should be
considered worse than the figures showed or, on the other hand,
``not serious.'' But he said there is a real possibility the problem
is worse than indicated because the data were limited.
   For instance, the information only measures cancer risks, but not
other potential hazards such as birth defects, nervous system damage
or respiratory disease.
   The figures also do not reflect the combined cancer risk of
different air toxics that might be released by a single plant.
   Also, only the cancer risk from direct inhalation of air toxics
is evaluated, although numerous studies indicate the potential
contamination of crops in nearby areas, or accumulation of toxics in
the food chain, can exceed the risk from breathing the chemicals.
   In addition, the EPA did not evaluate some toxics, including
benzene and coke oven emissions.
   The EPA said the worst plant on the list was the Texaco butadiene
plant in Port Neches, Texas, with at least a 1-in-10 risk of cancer.
   Texaco labeled the estimate ``totally unsupported by any
technical and scientific facts or by employee health records.''

<DATELINE>TUNIS, Tunisia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States opened a new round of
talks with the PLO Thursday by urging it to support an Israeli
proposal for elections in the occupied lands, but the two sides
remained sharply at odds.
   For its part, Israel said the U.S-PLO talks were hindering the
peace process.
   After 4{ hours of private discussions in Tunis, negotiators for
Washington and the Palestine Liberation Organization expressed
satisfaction with progress. The head of the PLO delegation, Yasser
Abd-Rabbou, said more talks will be held ``in the near future.''
   However, a senior American official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said, ``It was more of the same from the PLO.''
   Both Abd-Rabbou and the chief U.S. delegate, Robert Pelletreau
Jr., read statements after their meeting Thursday. They contained no
major shifts in position, however.
   ``The major focus of our dialogue today was the concept of
elections in the occupied territories to launch a political
negotiating process to deal with both transitional arrangements and
final status,'' said Pelletreau, who also serves as U.S. ambassador
to Tunisia.
   He stressed the U.S. government's view that the Israeli proposal
for elections in the occupied territories were ``constructive and
workable, deserving of a positive Palestinian response.''
   The plan calls for the 1.7 million Palestinians in the
Israeli-occupied territories to elect representatives to negotiate
with Israel for autonomy. Later talks would determine the final
status of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, but Israel has said an
independent Palestinian state is out of the question.
   The PLO, which has declared a Palestinian state, has rejected the
Israeli plan for elections. It says the Israelis must first withdraw
from the occupied territories and agree to an international observer
force.
   In his statement Thursday, Abd-Rabbou said the PLO delegation
urged the Bush administration to take ``clear and decisive measures
to stop the terrorist'' measures taken by Israel in the occupied
territories.
   ``These measures lead to more and more deaths, destruction and
deterioration of the condition in which the population has to
live,'' he said.
   More than 500 Palestinians have been killed in the 18-month-old
uprising against Israeli rule, most in clashes with Israeli
soldiers. Twenty-two Israelis also have died.
   Abd-Rabbou also called for an international conference on
bringing peace to the region.
   In his reaction to the talks Thursday, Israel Foreign Minister
Moshe Arens said the PLO is the obstacle to free elections.
   ``So contacts with them make things more difficult. They don't
help,'' he told Israel radio.
   ``Talking with them, which gives them a feeling of legitimacy and
recognition, only makes the peace process more difficult,'' Arens
said.
   Israel views the PLO as a terrorist group.
   The United States agreed to talk directly to the PLO last
December after PLO chief Yasser Arafat said his group was renouncing
terrorism. Thursday's discussions were the third round.

<HEAD>Teen Loses Driver's License for Legally Dropping Out of School</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A lawyer for a teen-ager who had his
driver's license revoked for dropping out of school says the state's
anti-truancy law clashes with other state statutes, making the new
law unconstitutional.
   ``He dropped out of high school legally because there's a statute
that says when you're 16, you can drop out,'' attorney Chris Butch
said. ``The (new) law is in direct conflict of that. The one law
doesn't jibe with the other.''
   Under an education reform law passed by the West Virginia
Legislature last summer, students under age 18 who miss more than 10
consecutive days of school or have 15 unexcused absences must give
up their driving privileges.
   Proponents of the law, which is aimed at curbing truancy in a
state where the dropout rate hovers around 17 percent, point to
Department of Motor Vehicle figures that show 100 of the 353
students who lost their license through December returned to school.
   Michael Means, a 17-year-old ninth-grade dropout, took his case
to Kanawha County Circuit Court on Wednesday, marking the first time
the statute has been challenged in court. He filed a lawsuit against
DMV Commissioner George Sidiropolis and the agency, seeking to
declare the law unconstitutional.
   A trial was set for June 21.
   Means, whose 16-year-old wife, Tonya, is pregnant, says he can't
get a job without driving, and therefore, can't provide for his
family.
   ``What I'm try to accomplish with the lawsuit is to get his
license back so he can function as an adult,'' Butch said.
   Tom Madden, a Department of Motor Vehicles attorney, said the
agency had not seen the lawsuit and could not comment.
   Means dropped out of Roosevelt Junior High School in Charleston a
year ago. In October, Means misplaced his license and requested a
new one. The DMV wouldn't agree without the consent of the Kanawha
County Board of Education, which refused. On May 30, the license was
revoked.
   A hardship clause exists in the law that allows county board of
educations to make some exceptions. However, school officials have
said that Means could have worked and still completed his education.
   ``I think the law is ignorant,'' said Michael's father, William.
``It shouldn't have had to go this far. Hopefully, it will get his
license back and get the law declared unconstitutional.''
   Butch added that under a 1973 state attorney general's opinion,
if a person is married and under the age of 18, the state considers
that person to be freed from parental control.
   ``That has been the law in this state for a long period of
time,'' he said. ``It was for the kids who weren't too good in
school and who went to work on farms or in the mines.''
   However, Del. Pat Murphy, D-Berkeley, who introduced the
legislation in 1988, said his law is designed to keep kids in school
and help those who have to work get their educations.
   ``What I do not want to see is the bill turned into a law that
encourages young people to go out and get married so they can quit
school and fall into the category of an emancipated youth,'' Murphy
said.

   Much more needs to be done to develop
community-based services for the growing number of children with
mental health problems, Tipper Gore said Thursday.
   Mrs. Gore, wife of Sen. Albert Gore Jr., D-Tenn., said that ``at
a time when we have a great deal of education, talent, skills,
research ... we have a service delivery system that emphasizes
hospitalization. In fact, some kids are sent out of state to be
hospitalized, because there's a lack of community-based mental
health services.''
   ``The goal ought to be to keep the child in the family, in the
home, in the community, if possible,'' she said. ``So we need a
commitment to funding for community-based mental health services
that are child-centered.''
   She was interviewed during a Capitol Hill conference by the
National Mental Health Association and the Child Mental Health
Interest Group, an organization that involves the wives of several
members of Congress and is chaired by Mrs. Gore.
   An Institute of Medicine study reported Wednesday that mental
disorder among children is a problem costing society billions of
dollars and depriving the nation of productive citizens.
   The report gave a conservative estimate of 12 percent of
America's children being mentally disturbed, but it added that the
true number could be as high as 22 percent, or about 14 million.
   At the conference, Dr. Joseph Coyle, director of child psychiatry
at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine and a member of the
committee that carried out the Institute of Medicine study, said it
was not ``presumptuous'' to recommend substantial increases for
funding of research into mental disorders of children at a time of
budget deficits and government program-tightening.
   Sen. Gore called the situation with child mental health ``a
problem that urgently needs attention.'' He said that in coping with
it, ``inevitably there's this tremendous inertia that society has to
get over with.''
   Mrs. Gore said that state government agencies across the country
need to take a more active role in coordinating the services and
funds available for assisting mentally disturbed children.

   A Soviet MiG-29 fighter crashed during an aerobatic
performance Thursday on the opening day of the Paris Air Show, and
the pilot was injured after bailing out of the jet.
   The aircraft was making its final pass over Le Bourget airfield
north of Paris after a dramatic demonstration flight when a part of
the aircraft appeared to break away.
   Pieces of the needle-nosed jet burst into flames while the
fuselage, in one piece, dropped like a stone in the center of the
airfield without injuring any of the thousands of exhibitors,
visitors and jouralists on hand for opening day.
   A water tanker and fire engines rushed to the scene to douse the
flames of the burning fuselage.
   The pilot, 37-year-old Anatoly Kvochur, was airlifted by
helicopter to hospital near the airstrip, then transferred to Begin
Military Hospital in a suburb east of the city. The Soviet Embassy
in Paris said he was in ``fairly good health.''
   Claude Martin, flight director of the show, said Kvochur's
parachute ``barely opened, but even so it broke the fall of the
pilot.''
   Air show spokesman Patrick Guerin said the pilot suffered serious
injuries, including injury to his stomach, but was conscious and
talked during the airlift to the military hospital.
   The Soviet news agency Tass carried a report on the incident and
videotape was shown on Soviet TV Thursday night.
   Alexander Batkov, Soviet department chief for the Ministry of
Aviation Industry, said in Paris that Kvochur is ``one of our best
pilots.''
   No immediate cause was given for the crash. Batkov said it was
only the second MiG-29 ever to crash.
   ``Specialists must analyze the situation,'' Batkov said. ``When
we see the film we'll know what happened. It is too early to ask
questions yet.''
   Guerin said the plane seemed to have ``a mechanical problem with
the left engine.'' He said the afterburner of the left engine failed
to fire during a low-speed turn at about 1,000 feet.
   One industry official said the pilot appeared to be pushing the
plane to its limits before the crash.
   John W. Wood Jr., president of Thermedics Inc. of Woburn, Mass.,
said the plane was making a ``very high performance routine,''
including vertical climbs straight up, solely on engine power
without relying on wing lift.
   John Klinghut, manager of operations for the U.S.A. National
Pavilion, who witnessed the crash, said the pilot ``apparently lost
an engine.''
   ``He was about 500 feet in the air. There was a big burst of
flames and a lot of smoke,'' Klinghut said.
   The accident occurred about two hours after President Francois
Mitterrand inaugurated the world's most prestigious aviation show,
which opens to the public on Friday.
   On display are a large number of Soviet aircraft, including the
new space shuttle Buran.
   The MiG-29, a twin-engine combat aircraft, has been used since
1985 and represents a clear effort by the Soviet Union to close the
technology gap with the West. Batkov said it was first displayed
last year at Britain's Farnborough air show, where it also was
piloted by Kvochur.
   The worst recent accident at the Paris Air Show was in 1973, when
a Soviet supersonic Tupolev 144 exploded in flight, killing the
six-man crew and seven people in the nearby village of
Goussainville, where it hit the ground.
   The last previous accident at the show, held every two years, was
in 1977 when an American single-seat twin-engine A-10 passed too low
while making a loop and hit the ground.
   On Aug. 28, 1988, 70 people died after three Italian Air Force
stunt jets collided at a Ramstein Air Base air show in West Germany.
One plane plowed into spectators at the event.

<TEXT>
   Pilot error appears the most likely
cause of the crash of a Surinamese jetliner that struck a tree and
tore to pieces trying to land in thick fog, a government spokesman
said Thursday.
   He said three Americans flying the plane, who all died in
Wednesday's crash, gave no radio warning of any problem before the
Surinam Airways jet went down near this capital's international
airport.
   The government-run Suriname News Agency said the death toll was
expected to reach 177. There were 11 known survivors who were
initially taken to a city hospital, but their condition was unclear.
   The airline gave no figure Thursday for the number of people
already known to be dead, saying families must first be notified.
   Rescue workers were searching Thursday for six bodies still in
the wreckage.
   Six investigators from the U.S. National Transportation Safety
Board arrived in Paramaribo at the request of the Surinamese
government to help investigate why the DC-8 crashed. It was leased
from an unidentified U.S. company to Surinam Airways.
   The cause of the accident was uncertain. However, government
spokesman Kenneth Schoon said: ``We think it was pilot error, but we
won't know for sure until the flight recorder is examined.''
   Commercial aircraft carry cockpit recorders that record in-flight
conversations and a flight data recorder that registers altitude,
wind speed and other data.
   The crash was the worst air disaster in the history of the former
Dutch colony on the northern coast of South America. The plane was
flying from the Netherlands.
   Schoon said the three Americans in the cockpit did not report an
emergency but circled the runway twice before asking the control
tower for more light on the runway.
   ``That was the last we heard of them,'' Schoon said.
   The airline identified the Americans as Capt. Will Rogers,
co-pilot Glyn Tobias and engineer Warren Rose. Their hometowns were
unavailable.
   Motilal Atta Mungra, the airline's director, said the company had
virtually ruled out technical problems because the 20-year-old plane
had a maintenance check just two weeks ago.
   He said the plane caught fire after hitting a tree and breaking
into pieces. Its mid-section landed upside-down, and debris was
strewn over 150 yards.
   Mungra said there were 188 people aboard.
   About 60 bodies of identified victims were being flown Thursday,
along with three badly burned survivors, to Amsterdam, Schoon said.
Other bodies were stored for identification in a temporary morgue at
the airport.
   The dead included three high-ranking Surinamese military officers
and three Dutch soccer players of Surinamese origin.
   Most passengers were people from Suriname living in the
Netherlands.

   A teen-ager convicted of vehicular
homicide was applauded at his graduation while his victim's mother
asked the school board to prohibit felons from receiving diplomas in
the future.
   Parents demonstrated last week at Santaluces Community High
School after Eric Norstrom was elected prom king. He was convicted
earlier in the death of Amber Hunter, 17, who was hit when Norstrom
drove into a crowd of youths.
   Norstrom received his diploma Wednesday, the same day Amber's
mother, Sharon Hunter, went before the Palm Beach County High School
in West Palm Beach asking for a change in school policy.
   The board agreed to consider Ms. Hunter's suggestion that
convicted felons be banned from participating in school activities.
   Amber was killed March 25, 1988, when Norstrom, racing to make a
curfew, plowed into about 100 students at a late-night Boynton Beach
street party.
   At Wednesday's commencement, people cheered longer and louder for
Norstrom than any of the other graduates in the Class of 1989.
   When guidance counselor Ray Arndt announced his name, Norstrom
crossed the stage, getting a hug from Santaluces Principal Vera
Garcia and a diploma from school board member Susan Pell. Some
spectators and classmates stood for the ovation.
   Norstrom, who didn't acknowledge the applause, walked with his
head down while students reached out to shake his hand as he walked
back to his seat.
   Norstrum's sentencing hearing was delayed by Palm Beach Circuit
Judge Marvin Mounts until after his graduation. The judge will
discuss sentencing options Monday with Norstrom, the victims'
families and attorneys, but actual sentencing may be delayed until
September because of scheduling conflicts.

   Arab gunmen forced their way into a hospital in
the occupied West Bank at dawn Thursday and assassinated a
Palestinian suspected of collaborating with Israel.
   Arab reports said the squad used a gun with a silencer to kill
55-year-old Taleb Yamin. He was hospitalized after an attack last
week in which he was beaten and stabbed.
   In a second slaying, a Palestinian suspected of cooperating with
Israeli authorities was shot in the head by Arab attackers.
   Arab reports said the victim, 48-year-old Fayel Fawalha, was
given first aid by Israeli soldiers and evacuated by an army
helicopter. The army said Fawalha died later at Israel's Tel
Hashomer Hospital.
   Also Thursday, a 13-year-old Palestinian boy was shot and killed
by a military patrol, Arab hospital officials said. Arab reports
said there were no clashes between troops and Palestinian
stone-throwers at the time, and that it was not clear what provoked
the shooting.
   All three shootings occurred in the West Bank town of Nablus.
   The army spokeswoman confirmed the slayings of the men and said
police were investigating. She said officials were checking reports
of the boy's death.
   Foreign Minister Moshe Arens termed the attacks the latest
examples of a PLO ``reign of terror'' in the occupied West Bank and
Gaza Strip.
   He also said Israel considers the U.S. dialogue with the PLO as
encouragement to the PLO and an impediment to peace. The PLO-U.S.
talks resumed Thursday in Tunis.
   ``The PLO is the obstacle to peace in the region,'' Arens said on
Israel radio. ``Talking with them gives them a feeling of legitimacy
and recognition and makes the peace process more difficult.''
   In the fatal attack at Rafidiyeh Hospital, ``a group of people
entered the hospital at 5 a.m.,'' said Dr. Abdel Rahman Shinar, the
hospital's director. ``They forced a male nurse and a relative to
leave the room. Then they opened fire, killing him instantly.''
   Another doctor, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Yamin
was shot once in the head. Arab reports said the gang was armed with
a gun with a silencer.
   The slayings of the men brought to 50 the number of Palestinians
killed by other Arabs since the uprising against Israeli rule in the
occupied territories began in December 1987. Most have been accused
of helping Israeli authorities or of drug dealing or prostitution.
   All three deaths brought to 512 the number of Palestinians killed
in the 18-month-old rebellion, most in clashes with Israeli
soldiers. Twenty-two Israelis also have died.
   In the Gaza Strip, Israeli soldiers on Thursday sealed the homes
of three Palestinians accused of throwing firebombs at troops.
   A day earlier, the army blew up one house and sealed another
belonging to Palestinians suspected in firebomb attacks.
   The United States and human rights groups have denounced the
practice, saying it violates the right to due process because those
punished usually have not been charged or tried.
   An 18-year-old Palestinian was reported wounded in the leg in a
clash with troops in Jebaliya in the Gaza Strip, which remained
under curfew for the fifth consecutive day.
   The curfew was lifted for two hours Thursday to allow the strip's
700,000 residents to buy food.
   Meanwhile, Vice President Dan Quayle urged Israel to halt all
settlement activity in the occupied lands, and suggested that even
talking about such plans was harmful to peace.
   ``These announcements of new settlements are politically
problematic even if they don't go through with it,'' Quayle said in
an interview with the English-language Jerusalem Post newspaper.
   ``It's something I wish there was a sensitivity to,'' he said.
   In an unusually blunt speech last month, Secretary of State James
A. Baker III lashed out at the settlements, saying they were a bar
to peace.
   More than 130 settlements housing about 70,000 Jews have been
built in the territories, home to 1.7 million Palestinians.
   A public opinion survey published Thursday indicated 53 percent
of Israelis would object to dismantling the settlements as part of a
peace agreement. But 42 percent of the 579 respondents favored their
removal.
   The poll was conducted this week by the Dahaf Institute and
carried in the Yediot Ahronot daily. No margin of error for the poll
was given.

<HEAD>Panel Sends State Department Authorization Bill to Senate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate Foreign Relations Committee,
permitted to act by the settlement of a partisan dispute within its
ranks, sent a $2.5 billion State Department authorization bill to
the Senate on Thursday but left some arguments over spending
priorities unresolved.
   The panel also recommended the Senate confirm four pending
diplomatic nominations, including that of former Sen. Chic Hecht,
R-Nev., to become ambassador to the Bahamas.
   The committee had been hamstrung by a Republican boycott of its
business meetings, reflecting GOP anger over a Democratic-led probe
into the past activities of Donald Gregg, named by President Bush to
be ambassador to South Korea.
   The Gregg controversy temporarily set aside, the committee faced
problems involving spending choices that must be made.
   Under a budget deal reached by the Bush administration and
Congress, combined foreign affairs spending for State Department
funding and foreign aid was set at $19 billion.
   But the administration requested total spending of nearly $19.8
billion.
   The crunch came when Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., sought to fund
$192 million for new and powerful Voice of America transmitters in
Israel by stripping money from accounts set aside to pay past and
present U.S. dues to United Nations organizations.
   Chairman Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., contended it is important the
United States meet its U.N. obligations, especially when funds are
needed for vital international peacekeeping operations.
   Refusing to pay would brand the United States as ``an
international deadbeat,'' Pell said.
   But Helms said it was ``vastly more important to build these
transmitters than to ship a whole hat full of money up to that crowd
at the United Nations.''
   Other panel members contended spending for the transmitter
project could be slowed because the Soviet Union has stopped
electronic jamming of Voice of America broadcasts, jamming that the
new transmitters were designed to overcome.
   In the end, the panel decided not to decide, at least for the
moment.
   By voice vote, it approved full funding for the transmitters.
   Then it voted not to take the money out of U.S. dues to the
United Nations.
   It then sent the bill to the Senate floor for further action at a
funding level $792 million above the budget ceiling.
   ``We will have to wrestle this to the ground further down the
road,'' said Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind.
   He and other senators expressed hope the administration will set
priorities and make choices needed to get foreign affairs spending
into balance.
   The panel also voted to recommend the Senate approve Bush's
nominations of:
   _Bernard Aronson to be assistant secretary of State for Latin
American Affairs.
   _John Kelly to be assistant secretary for Middle Eastern and
South Asian Affairs.
   _John Negroponte to be ambassador to Mexico.
   _Hecht to be ambassador to the Bahamas.
   Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said he organized the GOP boycott
because he feared a campaign of ``delays and leaks'' was being
mounted to prevent any action on the Gregg nomination.
   A committee investigation into Gregg's background was spurred by
Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif. Cranston said that Gregg _ while
national security adviser to then-Vice President Bush _ may have
helped in an illegal effort to resupply the Nicaraguan Contra rebels
with weapons and ammunition.
   McConnell and Cranston resolved the impasse on Wednesday after
administration officials promised to supply documents Cranston had
requested.
   Cranston will hold a second day of under-oath testimony on June
15. A guaranteed committee vote on Gregg now is set for June 20.
   Cranston told reporters he is satisfied with the result and
satisfied that the administration has made a ``good-faith
commitment'' to deliver the requested documents as promised.
   ``We're going to vote on the 20th,'' he said. ``If people aren't
satisfied with what we receive, they can vote `present' or `no.'''
   Cranston said he remains skeptical about Gregg's denials that he
had no involvement in Oliver L. North's attempts to resupply the
Contras.
   ``Up to this point I've found Mr. Gregg's version hard to
accept,'' Cranston said.

   Syrian gunners shelled the Christian
enclave north of Beirut on Thursday as three Arab foreign ministers
opened talks in Syria to try to end three months of fighting in
Lebanon.
   Police said two civilians were wounded during the sporadic
daylong hostilities.
   Syrian gunners, deployed in Moslem west Beirut, fired more than
100 howitzer shells in an apparent effort to prevent Christian army
commander Gen. Michel Aoun from receiving arms supplies by sea,
police said.
   A police spokesman, who cannot be named under standing rules,
said the shells exploded around the Christian ports of Jounieh and
Byblos.
   Aoun's gunners, entrenched in the 310-square-mile enclave,
unleashed a howitzer barrage at sundown aimed at Syrian gun
positions in west Beirut's seaside district, police reported.
   ``It's a limited retaliation aimed at the sources of Syrian
fire,'' said a communique from Aoun's headquarters.
   The police spokesman said gun battles broke out at nightfall
between Syrian and Christian units across Beirut's dividing Green
Line in the battle-scarred old commercial district straddling the
port.
   The latest round of fighting in Lebanon's 14-year civil war began
on March 8. Since then, 363 people have been killed and 1,432
wounded.
   In the Syrian capital, President Hafez Assad met with foreign
ministers Abdel Latif al-Filali of Morocco, Bouallam Bsayeh of
Algeria and Prince Saud al-Faisal of Saudi Arabia, who delivered a
message from their leaders on Lebanon. Syria has long considered
Lebanon within its sphere of influence.
   Al-Filali said in a statement:``We hope to find soon a final
solution to the Lebanese problem.''
   The three nations were chosen at an Arab summit conference in
Casablanca, Morocco, to come up with a peace plan within six months
to end the civil war.
   The foreign ministers are to travel later to Baghdad for talks
with Iraqi officials on the confrontation between Aoun's 20,000
troops and Syria's 40,000 soldiers.
   President Saddam Hussein of Iraq, Syria's main Arab foe, had
declared support for Aoun's ``war of liberation'' against the
Syrians.
   The current round of fighting began after Aoun ordered a blockade
of illegal ports run by Syrian-backed militias south of Beirut
because they deprive the state treasury of about $100 million in
customs dues annually.
   Syrian troops and allied militiamen of Druse warlord Walid
Jumblatt's Progressive Socialist Party retaliated by blockading the
Christian enclave, where about 1 million people live.
   The Arab League called a cease-fire on May 26 but it has not been
honored.
   Aoun on Wednesday called the confrontation ``a war for
sovereignty, nothing more, nothing less.''
   His remarks at a military graduation ceremony were published by
the independent daily newspaper An-Nahar.
   Aoun also called for the withdrawal of Israeli forces that
control, along with allied militias, a six- to 10-mile buffer zone
in southern Lebanon to prevent guerrilla attacks on northern Israeli
settlements.
   Syria troops are stationed across 70 percent of Lebanon under a
1976 Arab League peace-keeping mandate.
   Aoun and other Christian leaders accuse the Syrians of failing in
their mandate by siding with Moslems against Christians in the civil
war.
   The leftist daily newspaper As-Safir said Syrian vice president
Abdul Halim Khaddam Wednesday dismissed Aoun as ``not a man of
dialogue. ... He does not have a clear-cut political horizon.''
   It said Khaddam made the remarks in Damascus to a delegation from
Lebanon's Syrian-controlled northern province of Akkar.
   Khaddam said Syrian troops were ``prepared to remain in Lebanon
for another 14 years if need be to achieve justice.''
   He was referring to political reforms demanded by Syrian-backed
Moslem leaders who have been fighting fellow Christians since 1975
to achieve equality in running Lebanon's affairs.

<HEAD>Reports: Monk Says He Saw Up to Six U.S. POWs in Vietnam</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Japanese Buddhist monk recovering from 14 years of
imprisonment in Vietnam said he may have seen U.S. prisoners of war
at a re-education camp, according to news reports Thursday.
   Ganshin Yoshida, 65, told Japanese reporters there were ``five or
six'' prisoners of war who spoke English at the camp where he was
held for the last seven years. Vietnamese political prisoners called
them Americans, he said.
   An official of the Vietnamese Embassy in Tokyo called Yoshida's
remarks groundless.
   ``Our government has repeatedly discussed that issue in the past.
There are no more American POWs'' in Vietnam, the official told The
Associated Press on condition of anonymity.
   Kyodo News Service quoted Yoshida as saying he did not know what
the living conditions of the purported POWs were like because they
lived in a separate building. But he said they had been treated
horribly and had been tortured, Kyodo reported.
   The location of the camp was not disclosed.
   Yoshida said the prisoners were put to work in construction
projects, the news agency said.
   Hospitalized for ailments resulting from his confinement, Yoshida
has been too ill to talk until now, 4{ months after his return to
Japan, Nippon Televison said. He is hospitalized in Sapporo on
Hokkaido, Japan's northernmost island.
   Yoshida's daughter, Keiko Takatsuka, informed the U.S. Embassy of
her father's comments on Wednesday, Kyodo reported.
   An embassy official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
confirmed the meeting took place but refused to elaborate.
   The AP was unable to contact Mrs. Takatsuka despite repeated
attempts.
   Yoshida, formerly a city councilman in Hokkaido, became a monk in
1966 and emigrated to Vietnam, where he set up a temple in Saigon,
now called Ho Chi Minh City.
   Yoshida was granted citizenship in 1973 by the former South
Vietnamese government. When communist forces took over in 1975,
however, he was arrested and detained without trial in re-education
camps and jails.
   Vietnam released Yoshida on Jan. 20 for humanitarian reasons
following appeals by Yoshida and international human rights groups
such as Amnesty International.
   A total of 1,730 Americans are still listed as missing in action
in Vietnam; 634 others are missing in Cambodia, Laos and China,
according to U.S. figures.
   The Indochina war ended in 1975 with communist victories over
U.S.-supported governments in Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos.

<TEXT>
   About two dozen Baltic parliamentarians angry about
central control of their republics stormed out of the Congress
Thursday in a dramatic demonstration that lawmakers are no longer
cogs in the Kremlin machinery.
   ``Comrades! Comrades! I ask you to be calm because this is not
all so simple,'' an exasperated President Mikhail S. Gorbachev cried
as the deputies left the Kremlin's Palace of Congresses.
   It was the first walkout of the raucous Congress of People's
Deputies session that began May 25 and is scheduled to end Friday,
and it underscored the increasingly unpredictable nature of Kremlin
politics.
   It also reflected the heated opposition by some deputies to the
Communist Party establishment that runs the session and nominates
committee members and other officials.
   In other tough talk Thursday, a radical economist said the
country should cut aid to the Kremlin's Latin American allies and
pay farmers foreign currency to help avert economic collapse.
Another deputy said the country was on the brink of ecological
disaster.
   Soviet television, which broadcast the session live to millions,
showed about 25 deputies storming out.
   The Baltic legislators made the dramatic move after objecting to
formation of a committee by the 2,250-member Congress that will
decide whether laws conform to the Soviet Constitution. They said
the committee could encroach on their republics' right to
self-determination and ability to veto laws passed by the central
government.
   ``Our electors ordered us to take care of the sovereignty of our
republics,'' said Romas V. Gudaitis, a writer and deputy from
Lithuania. ``We consider the elections of the Constitutional
Inspection Committee to be without purpose and we will not take part
in them.''
   Gudaitis called the committee a remnant of the ``Stalin empire''
and part of Moscow's attempts to ``control and oppress national
problems by an iron glove.''
   Lithuanian deputies, among the most vocal at the parliamentary
session, led the walkout, the Tass news agency reported. Tass said
representatives of the two other Baltic republics, Estonia and
Latvia, also objected to the committee. But it was not immediately
clear if they joined the Lithuanian walkout.
   The Congress voted overwhelmingly to form the committee on
Thursday, but 433 deputies were against and 61 abstained, including
Lithuania's delegation. Gorbachev said he would consult with the
deputies who objected and that the Congress would vote on the
committee membership Friday morning.
   The Baltic representatives contend the Soviet takeover of their
nations in 1940 went against the people's will and believe
Moscow-based ministries have ruined their environment and economy.
Many Baltic residents are demanding autonomy from Moscow in all but
defense and security.
   In a direct clash with the Kremlin, the legislatures of Estonia
and Lithuania have proclaimed the right to veto laws approved by the
central government in Moscow.
   Later Thursday, Gorbachev told reporters to leave the hall and
asked that TV cameras be turned off. The Congress then went into its
first closed session, its topic undisclosed.
   Alexei Yastrebov, a deputy from the Ural Mountains area of
Russia, said in a telephone interview the closed session involved
discussion of violence in Uzbekistan.
   At least 71 people have been killed in a five-day rampage
involving ethnic Uzbeks and the Meskhi Turk minority in the southern
Soviet republic. More than 9,000 Interior Ministry troops have been
sent in and a curfew was imposed.
   Yastrebov said the deputies were asked whether they believe
``more decisive measures'' are needed to end the unrest but that a
decision was postponed until Friday. He said he could not spell out
what other measures the deputies could approve.
   In earlier debate, economist Nikolai Shmelev said Premier Nikolai
I. Ryzhkov's call on Wednesday for extensive defense cuts and
government relief for almost 40 million Soviets living in poverty
will fall far short of solving the country's woes.
   Shmelev said Soviet farmers should be motivated to work harder by
offering them pay in foreign currency with which they could buy
hard-to-get goods.
   Shmelev also called for a cut in aid to Latin America. Quoting
U.S. estimates that the Soviet Union spends between $6 and $8
billion on activities there, especially in aid to Cuba, he said ``no
one understands what a significant portion of that money is spent
on.''

   An Air Force C-5 cargo plane set a world
airdrop record by delivering four armed vehicles and 73 soldiers to
the ground by parachute, the service said Thursday.
   The drop on Wednesday during the international Airlift Rodeo 89
competition at Pope Air Force Base, N.C., involved four Sheridan

fully armed paratroopers.
   In all, the C-5 Galaxy was credited with an airdrop record of

<HEAD>Justices Strike Down Kentucky School System</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHARLES WOLFE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state Supreme Court declared Kentucky's
system of public schooling unconstitutional Thursday and ordered the
legislature to reinvent it.
   By permitting a wide gap between poor and wealthier school
districts, the legislature failed to meet its constitutional duty,
the court ruled.
   ``Lest there be any doubt, the result of our decision is that
Kentucky's entire system of common schools is unconstitutional,''
Chief Justice Robert Stephens wrote for the court's five-member
majority.
   Rich and poor alike ``must be given the same opportunity and
access to an adequate education,'' the court ruled in a case brought
four years ago by a coalition of 66 ``property poor'' districts.
   The decision ``applies to the entire sweep of the system _ all
its parts and parcels,'' including laws and regulations ``creating,
implementing and financing the system,'' the opinion said.
   They included laws creating local school districts and school
boards, the state Department of Education, school construction and
maintenance, teacher certification _ ``the whole gamut of the common
school system in Kentucky,'' the opinion said.
   Gov. Wallace Wilkinson, a longtime critic of the state's
school-management scheme, said the court had given Kentucky its
greatest opportunity of the last century.
   ``We've been talking about changing the management culture within
the system,'' Wilkinson said in a news conference. ``We never
imagined that we'd have an opportunity to remake the entire system.''
   State schools Superintendent John Brock called it ``the happiest
day of my professional life.''
   The General Assembly's ranking members _ Senate President Pro Tem
John ``Eck'' Rose and House Speaker Don Blandford _ said building
the kind of education system the court required was sure to be
expensive, but they were willing.
   Rose and Blandford also said the ruling was something of a
relief, although they technically were on the losing side. ``As far
as I'm concerned, there are no more sacred cows'' in education,
Blandford said.
   The Kentucky lawsuit was one of several pending in state courts
around the country. One such suit is pending in Texas, and another
in New Jersey is scheduled for arguments in that state's Supreme
Court in September.
   The Kentucky court agreed with plaintiff districts that despite
existing programs to funnel state money to local districts, ``there
are wide variations in financial resources ... which result in
unequal educational opportunities throughout Kentucky,'' Stephens'
opinion said.
   ``Even a total elimination of all mismanagement and waste in
local school districts would not correct the situation as it now
exists,'' the opinion said.
   The constitution ``places an absolute duty on the General
Assembly to re-create, re-establish a new system of common
schools,'' the opinion said, likening the present system to ``a
crumbling schoolhouse which must be redesigned and revitalized for
efficient use.''
   The legislature must provide for adequate funding of schools and
can choose its own method, the court said. But if lawmakers decide
to continue basing the system on property taxes, they must ensure
full valuation of property and uniformity of tax rates, the court
said.
   Kentucky law has always required full valuation of property.
Local school boards, which now number 177, have been allowed to set
their own tax rates, however, and they varied widely.
   Spending per pupil in 1987-88 ranged from a high of $4,094 in
Anchorage, an affluent suburb of Louisville, to a low of $1,986 in
Williamsburg, a small Appalachian town in southeastern Kentucky,
according to figures from the state Department of Education.
   Kentucky ranks 39th nationwide in per pupil spending, with state
and local funds averaging $2,574, the department said.
   The court ordered the effective date of its ruling delayed until
the end of the next legislative session, which is to begin in
January.
   Justice Charles Leibson, one of two dissenting justices, said
local school districts have no legal authority to sue the
legislature. Leibson also predicted mass confusion over the court's
apparent invalidation of decades of education law.

<HEAD>AT&amp;T Judge Will Handle Poindexter Trial</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETE YOST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal judge who presided over the
break-up of AT&amp;T will handle the Iran-Contra case of former national
security adviser John Poindexter.
   U.S. District Court Judge Harold Greene was given the Poindexter
case in a two-paragraph order signed by Chief Judge Aubrey Robinson,
who has been handling pre-trial proceedings involving Poindexter.
   Robinson said in the order that he was handing the matter over to
Greene because ``the case will be protracted and complex.''
   Robinson also is handling pre-trial hearings in the Iran-Contra
case of Richard Secord, who asked Robinson in a court session
Thursday not to consolidate a dozen criminal charges against him
contained in two separate indictments.
   Assigning the Poindexter case to another judge is aimed at
``expeditious and efficient dispostion of the court's business,''
said Robinson.
   Robinson has said it would be impossible for him to handle trials
involving both Poindexter and Secord.
   Poindexter is charged in the Iran-Contra scandal with conspiracy,
theft, wire fraud, two counts of obstruction of Congress and making
false statements to two congressional committees.
   Greene, 66, has been handling the antitrust case involving the
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. and its subsequent breakup since
1978, the year Robert F. Kennedy on combating racial discrimination.
   Robinson signed the two-paragraph order last Friday assigning the
case to Greene. Due to a clerical oversight, copies of the order
weren't made available to the public.
   Meanwhile, Robinson said at a hearing that he will rule Friday
whether to combine criminal charges that accuse Secord of lying to
Congress to cover up personal profits in the Iran-Contra affair with
1988 allegations that Secord slipped illegal gifts to Oliver L.
North.
   Thomas Green, Secord's attorney, argued against bringing the two
sets of charges together. He said one of nine counts brought in
April, obstruction of Congress, is ``incredibly broad'' and will
result in a lengthy battle over the use of classified material.
Prosecutors have said they plan to introduce no classified material
if Secord is tried on the consolidated charges.
   Secord's lawyer urged Robinson to try Secord separately on the
gratuities charges relating to North, a step the lawyer said would
enable a trial in the next month or so.
   At a previous hearing, Nov. 19 was mentioned by lawyers as a
possible starting date for a trial on consolidated indictments
involving Secord.
   Secord's lawyer said charges involving the alleged lies to
Congress don't relate to the counts involving illegal gratuities to
North.
   The judge said, however, that ``broad discretion'' is ``given to
trial courts'' under federal rules allowing consolidation of
separate indictments and that there doesn't need to be ``mechanical
linkage.''
   The gratuities charges involve a $13,800 home security system for
North and a $200,000 fund set aside for the education of his
children.
   North was convicted last month of accepting the security system
from Secord, along with falsifying and destroying documents and
aiding and abetting in an obstruction of Congress. He will be
sentenced June 23.
   North, then a White House aide, enlisted Secord to run arms to
the Contras during a congressional ban on military aid to the rebels.
   The government is pressing to join the two sets of charges and
plans to abandon wide-ranging conspiracy and theft counts accusing
Secord of being involved in the diversion of Iran arms-sales profits
to the Contra rebels in Nicaragua.
   Identical conspiracy and theft charges against North were dropped
because of national security concerns. The government refused to
declassify sensitive material that would have had to be presented in
court in a trial of those charges.

   U.S. Ambassador James Lilley promised Thursday his
embassy will get all Americans who want to leave out of the Chinese
capital.
   ``Starting from June 3, we were running very high risks staying
here,'' he told a news conference at the airport. ``We've been
planning since June 3 to move people out.''
   ``We will be able to handle the Americans leaving,'' Lilly said.
``One way or another we can do it, I can assure you.''
   Chinese soldiers were ordered into Beijing's central Tiananmen
Square on Saturday to crush a student-led movement for increased
democracy and an end to corruption. The government says nearly 300
people were killed, but Chinese and foreign diplomats say up to
3,000 died. Soldiers roamed the streets for days, shooting at random.
   Some Americans have complained that the U.S. mission was
unresponsive to the need for evacuation.
   ``They were not very helpful,'' said Stephanie Tom of Sausalito,
Calif., a student at Beijing Teacher's College who called the
embassy for a ride to the airport. ``They were very disorganized.
Those people are so exasperatingly noncommittal.''
   She eventually got a ride in a van sent by the West German
Embassy.
   ``I asked the embassy to come and get me, but they wouldn't,''
said Terese James of Liberty City, Texas, who was teaching at
Beijing Forestry University.
   ``They said I'd have to get to the airport myself,'' Miss James
said after she arrived in Tokyo on Wednesday.
   ``We've helped thousands and hundreds of Americans to get out of
here, we've been out to the universities again and again to bring
them in,'' Lilley said.
   ``They went through barricades, we got machine-gunned in our
apartments yesterday, it's a very dicey situation,'' he said.
   He said there were contingency plans to evacuate people from
China through Shanghai or Canton if escape via Beijing proved
impossible.
   ``We're not comfortable,'' Lilley said. ``Security is not a
finite thing. We've taken an awful lot of moves to improve our
security, and the biggest one was putting those people on that plane
and pulling them out of town.''
   Lilley said that, ``With the troops in town, with the shooting
going on, with your apartments being raked, surrounded, it's just
not a wise thing to keep people here at this point.''
   Chinese soldiers sprayed a diplomatic residential compound with
bullets Wednesday.
   Lilley noted that Thursday was relatively quiet compared to the
previous four days, but said, ``We aren't hearing shots, but can you
tell me we won't hear them tonight?
   Can you tell me this thing won't get unstuck tomorrow?''
   He said he was relieved that no Americans had been killed in the
violence.

<HEAD>Senate Panel Asks Lujan for Action to Help Indians</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Members of a special Senate investigating
committee told Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan on Thursday to take
aggressive action at his department to improve what they said were
deficient programs for Indians.
   Lujan said he would.
   Sen. Thomas Daschle, D-S.D., said he was worried that
shortcomings discovered by the special unit of the Senate Select
Committee on Indian Affairs would go uncorrected.
   Daschle told Lujan, whose department oversees nearly all federal
programs for Indians, ``Someone has to do something ... shake them
up. Someone has to say it is no longer going to be like it was.''
   The special committee, chaired by Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz.,
has asked President Bush to appoint a staff member at the White
House whose only responsiblity would be to make sure federal
responsibilities to American Indians are met.
   Lujan objected to that, saying the responsibility belonged to the
Interior Department and he saw no need for an outside coordinator.
   DeConcini responded by saying it might be easier to get action if
someone at the White House were helping.
   During investigative work covering most of a year and weeks of
hearings spanning six months, the committee has uncovered what
members consider gross mismanagement in numerous federal agencies
dealing with Indian interests.
   As an example, DeConcini reminded Lujan that in just a few
months, investigators working for the committee exposed millions of
dollars in thefts of Indian oil which the federal Bureau of Land
Management was supposed to be protecting.
   He asked Lujan what he would do about it?
   ``We'll do what Sen. Daschle suggested. We'll do some kicking
around,'' Lujan said.
   The committee hearings, which began in January, also have
revealed evidence of:
   _Corruption in contracting for federal projects on Indian
reservations.
   _Child abuse in Bureau of Indian Affairs schools.
   _Organized crime involvement in legal Indian gambling operations.
   _Poor management at the Indian Health Service.
   _Failure by the government to protect land granted Indians by
treaty from encroachment by non-Indians.
   _Federal projects for non-Indians that have depleted resources
such as water on reservations.
   _Corruption among some tribal leaders.
   DeConcini said the committee will have a report on its findings
by September or October.
   ``I have concluded that the secretary of interior and the
Interior Department are not meeting the trust responsibility,'' he
said. He praised Lujan for being sensitive to the problem.
   ``But you need to translate it into action,'' he said.
   ``The report we are going to issue is not going to be extremely
complimentary. It is going to single out areas where the trust
responsibility was not met.''
   Lujan said the department was already starting to make changes
based on findings of the committee.

<TEXT>
   Florida's Supreme Court reversed the
conviction of a death row inmate Thursday and ordered his fourth
trial in the murders of three adults and two children.
   In a 4-3 ruling, the court said Douglas Jackson deserved another
trial because the prosecutor in his third trial improperly
questioned him about his conviction in the first trial.
   The first verdict was overturned because his defense attorney was
taking medication for a head injury during the trial. Jackson's
second trial ended in mistrial.
   Jackson was convicted in his latest trial of killing Walter
Washington, 25; his wife Edna, 21; Larry Finney, 26; and Terrence
and Reginald Manuel in March 1981. Their bodies were found in the
charred hulk of an car on a remote stretch of road.
   The three adults died of shotgun wounds. Terrence, 4, and
Reginald, 14 months, Mrs. Washington's sons, died of smoke
inhalation.
   The killings occurred after Jackson's estranged wife, Karen,
quarreled with him and left home to live with the victims.
   ``The prejudicial effect upon a jury of testimony that a
defendant has been previously convicted of the crimes for which he
is now on trial is so damaging that it cannot be said beyond a
reasonable doubt that a jury would return a verdict of guilty absent
the testimony,'' the court's majority opinion said.
   But Justice Stephen H. Grimes argued that the cross-examination
remark was ``harmless error.''
   ``Moreover, there is every reason to believe that the jury was
already aware that this was not Jackson's first trial,'' Grimes said
in his dissenting opinion.

   Parliament speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani on
Thursday denied reports of a power struggle after the death of
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
   Rafsanjani also said the post-Khomeini regime in Iran will not
help free Western hostages held in Lebanon unless the United States
releases frozen Iranian assets and helps locate four missing
Iranians.
   Rafsanjani also signaled his intention of playing a bigger
political role, telling foreign reporters during a news conference
that he wants more executive power for the presidency.
   Rafsanjani, 55, is the only candidate running in the Aug. 18
presidential election.
   He is considered a moderate who seeks to end the country's
international isolation and boost private enterprise in opposition
to radical hardliners who favor a self-reliant fundamentalist Iran.
   Rafsanjani, who is also acting commander in chief of the armed
forces, dismissed reports that Iran was plunged into turmoil by
Khomeini's death as ``nothing but shooting in the dark by people who
know nothing about the internal situation in our country.''
   Rafsanjani stressed that President Ali Khamenei's appointment to
succeed Khomeini as supreme leader was permanent.
   Khomeini, 86, died Saturday of a heart attack, 11 days after
undergoing surgery for internal bleeding.
   Khamenei, 49, was named his successor on Sunday amid speculation
he would serve as a caretaker leader until constitutional reforms
ordered by Khomeini are approved in a referendum to be held
simultaneously with the presidential election.
   Khamenei, considered a moderate and a Rafsanjani ally, has served
as Iran's head of state since 1981. He is barred by the constitution
from running for a third four-year term.
   Rafsanjani said the constitutional reforms will reinforce the new
president's executive power at the expense of the prime minister.
   That will prevent rival power centers from stalling the
decision-making process, which has often happened in the past.
   Rafsanjani claimed that Western countries and not Iran were
responsible for the country's isolation, saying ``the West should
give up its former spirit that Iran is a satellite belonging to
them.''
   He said the country will remain faithful to Khomeini's policy of
``neither East nor West,'' but added that relations with the Soviet
Union had improved and that he plans to visit Moscow shortly.
   The Soviet Union was Iraq's main arms supplier during the 8-year
war with Iran which ended with a U.N.-sponsored cease-fire in August.
   ``If the Westerners change their policy and treat us as the
Soviet Union did, they will see the same position on our part,''
Rafsanjani said, speaking Farsi through an interpreter.
   But he charged that ``the United States and Western Europe follow
hostile policies toward Iran ...The United States practically
entered the war against us.''
   Asked about an appeal by President Bush for help in freeing
American hostages in Lebanon, he said the United States must use its
influence on the right-wing Christian Lebanese Forces militia
believed to have kidnapped four Iranian government employees.
   ``Then you can expect us to do what we can for the release of the
other hostages, although we have no responsibility in Lebanon.''
   There are 15 Western hostages in Lebanon, including nine
Americans, who are believed held by pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem
extremists.
   The four Iranians, last seen at a Lebanese Forces checkpoint
north of Beirut in 1982, are believed to be dead.
   In Washington, Secretary of State James A. Baker III said the
United States provided Iran with information on Iranians held by
Christian forces in Lebanon in 1982. He reiterated the U.S. position
that Iran should help bring about the immediate and safe release of
the American hostages in Lebanon.
   Rafsanjani also said Iran could not help on the hostage issue
while Iranian assets are frozen in the United States.
   ``The United States has acted like a pirate ... If the Iranian
assets are released as a sign of goodwill, we in return will do
whatever we can,'' he added.
   The United States broke relations with Iran, froze billions of
dollars in Iranian assets in American banks and impounded military
equipment ordered by deposed Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi after
radicals seized the U.S. Embassy and held 52 Americans hostage in
1979.
   Commenting on the break in relations with Britain over the novel
``The Satanic Verses,'' by British novelist Salman Rushdie,
Rafsanjani said the issue had been ``created by the West.''
   ``You allowed the book to be published despite warnings,'' he
said.
   Rafsanjani said Khomeini's Feb. 14 religious ruling condemning
Rushdie to death for blaspheming Islam in the book was decreed by
Islamic law and could not be evaded.

<HEAD>Study Says Operators Don't Discriminate in Programming Picks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY ARNOLD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The cable TV industry Thursday issued a study
showing that cable companies having a financial interest in program
services don't try to keep their viewers from watching networks that
the operators don't own a share of.
   Nor does the study, by Benjamin Klein, an economics professor at
the University of California, Los Angeles, show that such cable
companies refuse to license their program services to competing
deliverers such as microwave operators and backyard satellite dish
owners.
   Klein's study disputed assertions that giant cable operators such
as Telecommunications Inc. (TCI) and American Television and
Communications Corp. (ATC) use their size to discriminate against
program networks they do not own.
   He said that although these companies are more inclined to carry
the program services in which they have a stake, they also are more
likely than other cable operators to carry programming in which they
have no investment.
   More importantly to cable TV viewers, Klein said, cable
operators' willingness to invest in programming networks, a practice
known as ``vertical integration,'' has led to ``an increased variety
of programming choices not previously available to television
consumers.''
   ``As this landmark report illustrates, cable's investment in
programming has enabled our industry to offer consumers a new and
better type of television,'' National Cable Television Association
President James Mooney said.
   NCTA released the report less than a week before a Senate
subcommittee was scheduled to begin hearings on increased
concentration of media ownership.
   Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, has proposed that no single
company may own cable systems that reach more than 25 percent of the
nation's cable households, similar to federal regulations on
over-the-air broadcasters.
   Klein studied 400 U.S. cable systems of varying sizes and markets
and found that vertically integrated multiple-system operators ``are
somewhat more likely to carry networks in which they have an
ownership interest.''
   However, he said this effect is generally small because the
vertically integrated companies have ownership interests in
relatively few networks compared to the 40, 50 or even 120 channels
they may carry.

   A black palm cockatoo, a bird on the
endangered species list, was killed by a wild mink at a zoo where it
was taken after being seized in an illegal bird shipment from Asia.
   The bird, worth $10,000, was one of three sent to Mesker Park Zoo
before a transfer to other zoos in about three weeks.
   The cockatoos, which were not in good health, were sent to Mesker
because Zoo Director Ron Young is regional coordinator of the Palm
Cockatoo Consortium, a group that monitors and establishes breeding
programs at zoos.
   Only 3,000 pairs of the birds are left in the wild, Young said.
   Young said the bird was killed Sunday by a mink that entered the
bird's cage through a narrow slit.
   ``We've seen the minks, and besides when you've been working
around a zoo as long as us here, you know by how something's been
killed what did it,'' Young said. ``The mink, they kill for the fun
of killing. They are devious creatures. They're a killing machine.''

   A vaccine developed by polio pioneer Jonas Salk
may help wipe out the AIDS virus in people already infected and stop
them from getting the deadly disease, according to preliminary
research presented Thursday.
   ``It is becoming clear that a diagnosis of HIV positivity need
not be regarded as a death sentence,'' Salk said.
   Salk's approach is one of several newly reported developments
that experts say raises hopes that an AIDS vaccine is possible, if
still far away.
   If the vaccine works as Salk hopes, it will stimulate the body to
hunt down its own blood cells that carry HIV, the AIDS virus. Such
cells are virus-making factories inside the body, and wiping them
out could hold the virus in check, preventing it from spreading and
causing AIDS.
   Whether the vaccine will actually work this way is still unclear.
Although it has been tested in people, the best evidence of its
potential power comes from experiments on chimpanzees, the only
animal besides people that can be infected with the AIDS virus.
   Experts caution that much more work will be necessary in both
animals and people before anyone knows whether the vaccine will save
lives.
   However, Dr. Dani P. Bolognesi of Duke University, a top U.S.
AIDS vaccine researcher, said the new work is promising, in part
because it suggests that an effective vaccine can be made for
treatment after AIDS infection _ something many experts had doubted.
   ``This suggests it is possible to deal with the virus in
already-infected individuals,'' he said.
   While cautioning that this and other animal studies need to be
confirmed, he added, ``They are the beginnings, I believe, of
piercing the armor that has existed that it would be impossible to
protect against this class of virus.''
   The latest vaccine studies were described at the week-long 5th
International Conference on AIDS.
   Salk's animal studies, conducted with Dr. Clarence Gibbs of the
U.S. National Institutes of Health, were performed on three chimps.
   Two of them had already been infected with HIV when they received
the vaccine. After three injections, all measurable signs of the
virus disappeared. And when scientists gave them more virus, they
did not become reinfected.
   The other chimp was given virus for the first time after
vaccination. While this animal got infected, the level of virus in
its body has been steadily dropping instead of rising, as usually
happens.
   Gibbs described these results as ``very startling'' and said,
``We don't want to raise false hopes. But these studies are
increasing our understanding about what is necessary for a vaccine
for HIV-infected human beings.''
   Salk said that creating an AIDS vaccine is much more difficult
than a polio vaccine, which he developed in the 1950s. And while he
would not predict when an AIDS vaccine might be available, he
commented, ``There is light at the other end of the tunnel. We hope
to move in that direction as quickly as possible.''
   In human studies conducted with Dr. Alexandra Levine of the
University of Southern California, the vaccine was given in November
1987 to 19 people with pre-AIDS disease.
   She said they have not progressed to AIDS, and skin tests suggest
the vaccine has stimulated their bodies to produce microbe-fighting
blood cells against the virus. However, there is no clear evidence
that the level of virus in their bodies has fallen.
   The AIDS virus kills by attacking the body's immune defenses.
Salk said he hopes the vaccine will produce more dramatic results
when given to infected people whose immune systems are still healthy.
   Salk's vaccine is made from AIDS viruses that have been killed
and stripped of their outer coats.
   ``If this holds up in man, it could be of substantial
importance,'' said Dr. Robert Gallo of the National Cancer
Institute. But he cautioned against giving killed viruses to
uninfected people, because live viruses might slip through.
   Other researchers are testing similar vaccines against SIV, an
AIDS-like virus that kills monkeys.
   Researchers at the New England Regional Primate Center reported
that a killed vaccine kept two of five monkeys from becoming
infected with SIV.
   Another team from the biotechnology firm Repligen said they had
found the precise spot on the outside of the virus that stimulates
the body to produce killing antibodies. This small fragment might
serve as an AIDS vaccine.

   Foreigners fleeing China left lovers and friends
behind and came home with dark experiences instead of fond memories.
   Evacuees arrived in Asia, Europe and the United States on
Thursday with tales of children shot down by soldiers and of
acquaintances slain in the army assault on pro-democracy
demonstrators in Beijing.
   Joanne Smith, 20, of Leeds University in England, said students
strapped the bullet-riddled body of a 9-year-old boy to a truck and
paraded it through Beijing to illustrate the horror.
   ``From the moment I saw that, I realized just how inhuman the
army had been and what they had done,'' she said. ``I will never
forget the sight of that little boy as long as I live.''
   In Tokyo, U.S. Embassy and airline personnel arranged for medical
care, connecting flights and hotel rooms for hundreds arriving on
evacuation flights chartered by the State Department.
   The tearful Chinese wife of a U.S. diplomat, who did not give her
name, said: ``It was dreadful. `We were talking with the student
leaders in the square, and two days later they were dead.''
   ``I had to leave my Chinese fiance behind, I hope she'll be all
right,'' said Ted Pritikin, 20, a Chinese-language student from Los
Angeles.
   He said they parted at the Beijing train station Saturday night,
then the violence began and he was caught up in the rush to leave
China.
   Worried friends and family tried desperately to get through to
China by phone. Zhifeng Shao, a 37-year-old scholar in Chicago, said
he spent hours trying to call his relatives who live minutes from
Tienanmen Square, where troops beat and shot demonstrators over the
weekend to end a three-week sit-in.
   He says he has nightmares that his mother would be killed.
   ``I have trouble sleeping these days,'' he said in an interview
Wednesday. ``I wake up every few hours.''
   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. reported demand has been
``tremendous'' on a limited number of circuits between the two
countries.
   ``So many children were killed,'' said Terese James, 24, of
Liberty City, Texas, who arrived with her Chinese husband, Wu Wei.
   ``Students came back to the university with wounds all over,''
she said. ``Soldiers were shooting to kill. If they heard someone
cry out, they'd shoot again.''
   Isabel Marcus, a law professor who returned home to Buffalo,
N.Y., said she still has vivid images of ``frail, terrified,
peaceful, idealistic young people who were going to be killed for
nothing. ... I just keep seeing the numb terror on their faces.''
   Jean Ashbey of Surrey, England, said she was in Beijing to study
Chinese painting at Beijing's Central Academy of Fine Art.
   ``We saw students running out (of Tiananmen Square) injured, with
blood pouring down,'' she said. ``We saw smoke and heard gunfire.
There were volleys of machine gun fire all the time and helicopters
were constantly in and out of the square.
   ``We heard stories of old women being killed, men, women and
children and of students, begging not to be shot, who were simply
mowed down.''
   Mrs. Ashbey and her husband, Roy, arrived in London via Hong Kong.
   Roy Ashbey said: ``I am sickened and angry by what has happened.
We had grown to really like the Chinese people, who were happy and
friendly. The atmosphere before the carnage was wonderful. Now I am
terribly worried for the people there. I just can't understand how
the soldiers could do what they did.''
   Serena Carden, 20, of East Sussex, England, said an American
friend was near Tiananmen Square, ``walking along with his back to
the square and they just opened fire. Someone beside him was hit and
fell down at his side. He just ran.''
   Lucy Rapaport, a British tour operator, said in Tokyo the danger
in Beijing was brought home by a Chinese government announcement
that the safety of foreigners could not be guaranteed.
   She described the situation in Beijing's antiquated airport,
already disorganized by renovations, as ``chaotic, with people
sleeping on the floor and lining up at check-in counters.''
   Donna Anderson, an American journalist, said: ``Anyone going into
Beijing now must be crazy. No one's sure who's in charge. It's
dangerous.'' She left the Chinese capital Wednesday and was flying
from Tokyo to the United States on Thursday.

<HEAD>Senate Committee Said to Request Large Number of Documents</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN SKORNECK</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate committee reviewing the
controversial nomination of William Lucas to head the Justice
Department's civil rights division has asked him to provide some
200,000 pages of documents, a Justice Department spokesman said
Thursday.
   A committee source denied that that many documents were requested.
   The spokesman, David Runkel, declined to criticize the Senate
Judiciary Committee for last week's demand by its staff, saying only
that the amount of paperwork requested was ``unusual.''
   ``It seems to me it would take years for the Senate staff to
review all this material,'' he said.
   However, a committee source said, ``We have not asked for
something broad, but for something pretty narrow ... but apparently
the way the records are kept, they're in a much broader category.''
   The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity said some
documents ``may involve privacy matters and we don't even want to
look at the stuff, much less sort through it.''
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh questioned Judiciary Committee
Chairman Joseph R. Biden Jr., D-Del., about the request Wednesday
night when Thornburgh spoke to the Delaware State Bar Association.
   ``He said something like, `They're asking for a lot of stuff,'''
Runkel said.
   Thornburgh urged Biden to schedule Lucas' confirmation hearings
as soon as possible, and the senator said he hoped they could be
held before the July 4 holiday.
   The committee source declined to reveal what kinds of documents
the committee is seeking ``because we don't to be unfair to the
nominee by raising unfair implications about what we're looking at.''
   But Runkel said the committee wanted such things as employment
records and court documents ``on cases that may have been filed in
which he, as a public official, may have been a defendant.''
   Lucas, who is working for the Justice Department as a $284-a-day
consultant while awaiting Senate confirmation, seems ``somewhat
amazed by the request'' for the documents, Runkel said.
   The nominee did not respond to phone calls seeking comment.
   Lucas, who had been in private legal practice in Detroit for two
years before being nominated for the assistant attorney general's
post by President Bush in April, had served as sheriff and chief
executive of Wayne County, Mich., which includes Detroit.
   A black Republican who ran unsuccessfully for Michigan governor
in 1986, Lucas had been a lifelong Democrat before joining the GOP
in 1985.
   Lucas' nomination is opposed by some civil rights groups on the
grounds he lacks legal experience, particularly in civil rights. On
his Senate questionnaire, Lucas said he has never tried a case in
court since he entered private legal practice in Detroit two years
ago.
   In one notable case, Lucas was found legally responsible for
injuries suffered by a prisoner who was beaten while in the custody
of Wayne County sheriffs' deputies.
   The 1976 beating of Salvatore Marchese by an unidentified person
who was admitted to his locked holding cell was the subject of a
strongly worded 1985 ruling by the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
   The court cited Lucas' ``failure to provide a trained and
disciplined county law enforcement agency'' or to investigate the
beating incident.
   Lucas had testified that he did not know about the incident and
therefore would not have been able to investigate it.
   But the appellate court said he remained legally liable and that
his failure to order and direct an investigation and to punish those
responsible ``served to confirm the existence of an unstated
`policy' of toleration of illegal brutality toward any county
prisoner who had threatened the life of a sheriff's deputy.''

<HEAD>Fixed-Rate Average Down; Variable-Rate Up</HEAD>

   Interest rates on fixed-rate mortgages dropped
in early May after two straight monthly hikes, but those on
adjustable-rate mortgages continued climbing for the seventh
consecutive month, the government reported Thursday.
   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board said fixed rates fell 0.09
percentage point to 11.50 percent. The April fixed rate of 11.59 had
been the highest since December 1985, when rates averaged 12.01
percent.
   Rates on adjustable-rate mortgages rose 0.14 percentage point to
10.29 percent in early May, the highest since December 1985, when
rates averaged 10.39 percent, the bank board said.
   The drop in the fixed rate reflected an easing of other long-term
interest rates, the bank board said. Interest rates overall began
falling recently after being propped up by the Federal Reserve for
15 months to stem inflation.
   ``The increase in the ARM rate was caused primarily by a decrease
in the number of institutions offering first-year, below-market,
`teaser' rates on these types of loans,'' according to James Barth,
the bank board's chief economist.
   Barth said because of the higher rates for adjustable-rate
mortgages, ``the ARMS portion of all loans closed declined to 53
percent in early May, down from 55 percent in the previous month and
the smallest in a year.''
   Last Friday, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp., known as
Freddie Mac, reported fixed-rate mortgages averaged 10.48 percent
last week, down from 10.50 percent a week earlier. On one-year
adjustable-rate mortgages, lenders were asking an average initial
rate of 9.21 percent, up from 9.18 percent the week before.
   The Freddie Mac figures are lower than those reported by the bank
board because they do not include add-on fees, known as points,
often paid by borrowers.

<HEAD>Hills Optimistic Trade Target Action Will Result in Successful Talks</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills,
responding to complaints about high-handed American negotiating
tactics, said Thursday that the administration's decision to target
trade barriers in Japan, Brazil and India was not meant to be an
exercise in ``mindless name-calling.''
   Hills said she was optimistic that the administration's decision
would result in successful negotiations despite howls of protest
from the targeted countries.
   The administration, implementing the most controversial section
of the 1988 trade law, cited the three nations last month for
serious fair-trade violations with the threat that they could face
100 percent retaliatory tariffs if the countries do not agree to
remove the offending barriers to U.S. products.
   The United States action was criticized at an international
meeting last week in Paris, with the 24-nation Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development attacking such unilateral trade
actions.
   Hills, who attended the Paris meeting, defended the
administration against complaints from other countries that the
United States was threatening to set off a global trade war of
retaliation and counter-retaliation.
   In testimony Thursday before the House Ways and Means
subcommittee on trade, Hills said, ``We do not seek mindless
name-calling'' in implementing the trade law.
   Rather, she said, the administation hoped that it had laid out
the priorities it would be working to achieve in opening markets
over the next year.
   Hills received general praise from members of the trade
subcommittee for her decision.
   Subcommittee Chairman Sam Gibbons, D-Fla., said that the
administration had managed to walk a fine line between sounding
``tough enough to say we mean business but also saying we are here
to negotiate.''
   Some congressmen questioned why the administration had chosen
such a limited target list. For Japan, the products covered by the
negotiations will be supercomputers, satellites and U.S. lumber.
   Hills said the countries and items named represented a judgment
call on the part of the administration of the areas which offered
the best possibility of expanding markets for American products
within the tight negotiating deadlines set by the trade provision,
called ``Super 301.''
   Countries not named to the priority list this year could still be
named when the administration is required to present a new list next
year, Hills said.
   Shortly after Hills' appearance, a U.S. shipbuilding industry
group announced that it had filed a complaint challenging shipyard
subsidies provided by the governments of West Germany, Norway, Japan
and South Korea.
   The petition, filed by the Shipbuilders Council of America, an
industry trade group, requested that Hills begin negotiations to end
the subsidies being provided by the four countries.
   The shipbuilding group unveiled its demands during a Capitol Hill
news conference attended by several senators and House members who
represent cities with shipyards with many of them complaining about
the closing of 55 shipyards since 1978 with a loss of 60,000 jobs.
   Hills has 45 days to decide whether to accept the petition and
begin negotiations with the countries to end the subsidies.
   During her testimony, Hills announced that the United States and
Japan would begin talks next week on a broad range of Japanese
``structural'' impediments to trade. She said she hoped these
initial discussions would lay the groundwork for talks aimed at
removing various broad-based impediments to trade such as the
Japanese distribution system.

   A House subcommittee heard opposing views
Thursday on a bill to reduce regulation in the shipment of goods by
sea between U.S. ports, one of the last heavily regulated forms of
transportation.
   The measure would primarily affect the shipment of goods to and
from Hawaii, Alaska, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands and other
island territories.
   It would put all such traffic under the Federal Maritime
Commission. Currently, the Interstate Commerce Commission regulates
some shipments that start out on rail or truck.
   In some cases, shippers can choose which federal agency they want
to have oversee their rates.
   ``Some island communities feel they are captive to those few
carriers that serve their island, while other domestic trade areas
have vigorous competition that help restrain rates,'' said Rep.
Walter B. Jones, D-N.C., chairman of the merchant marine
subcommittee of the House Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries.
   ``This bill deregulates a great deal,'' said Jones, ``but,
frankly, it retains the concept of economic regulations where the
public interest demands a degree of oversight.''
   In the first of two scheduled hearings on the measure, domestic
ocean carriers varied in their reactions to the bill. A hearing next
week is to include federal regulators, state representatives and
shippers.
   Richard J. Knapp of Alaska Railroad Corp. opposed the bill,
saying regulation by the maritime commission would prohibit
shipments by contracts which are allowed under ICC regulations.
   ``This bill would severely compromise competition in the
interstate transportation marketplace and it would unduly restrict a
carrier's ability to tailor services to shipper requirements in a
timely manner,'' Knapp said.
   Walter J. Anderson, president of Gulf Puerto Rican Transport,
supported a provision in the bill that would prohibit the government
of Puerto Rico from requiring its agencies to use vessels operated
by the state-owned carrier even though its prices may be higher that
other carriers.
   Hudson R. Warren of Tropical Shipping and Construction Co., which
operates 12 vessels serving the Virgin Islands and several Caribbean
countries, said having two agencies regulate shipping has resulted
in ``confusing and conflicting regulations.''
   He said some shippers have tried to avoid paying for services by
filing complaints that their shipments should have been covered by a
different federal agency.

<HEAD>NATO Commander Questions Timetable for East-West Arms Deal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT J. WIELAARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An aide to U.S. Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney said Thursday the one-year timeframe President Bush set for
an East-West accord on cutting conventional forces and arms in
Europe was more a goal than a deadline.
   West German Gen. Wolfgang Altenburg, head of NATO's panel of
allied commanders, had questioned the timetable as Cheney and his
colleagues held their spring meeting at NATO headquarters.
   ``It's a real challenge,'' Altenburg told reporters. ``It's
optimistic, indeed! Unrealistic? I don't know. ... If we make it in
12 months, I do not know.''
   At a NATO summit in Brussels last week, the allies agreed to a
proposal advanced by Bush on specific cuts in troops and combat
aircraft. His new plan came in response to a flurry of recent arms
control initiatives by Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Bush wants accord reached within six to 12 months at East-West
talks in Vienna to cut U.S. and Soviet troops in Europe to 275,000
each and cut about 750 combat planes from NATO forces and 3,000 from
the seven-nation Warsaw Pact.
   The president said that if Washington withdraws 30,000 troops
from Europe and Moscow withdraws 325,000, each side then would have
275,000 troops remaining.
   Cheney discussed the timetable with the defense ministers. A
Cheney aide, briefing reporters, agreed it was ``ambitious'' to
expect a conventional arms accord within a year.
   But, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity:
``The United States put it up as a goal, not a deadline.''
   He said success at the Vienna talks hinged on Soviet willingness
to reach an accord. ``It's up to the Soviets, now.''
   The aide pointed to an improved East-West disarmament climate and
said, ``We are moving already much faster than before.''
   The ministers will end their two-day meeting Friday by
reaffirming the goal for all North Atlantic Treaty Organization
nations to increase annual defense budgets by 3 percent after
inflation.
   The Cheney aide said that although most members _ including the
United States _ will not achieve that goal this year, the defense
chiefs agreed it would be unwise to drop 3 percent as an objective.
   This week, NATO officials held their first talks on how to
implement Bush's aircraft proposal: how and where to cut 750 combat
aircraft from NATO air forces and which aircraft should be scrapped.
   East and West are already negotiating cuts in such armaments as
tanks and artillery throughout Europe at the Vienna talks that began
this year.
   Bush added troops and combat aircraft in response to a flurry of
recent arms control initiatives by Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev.
   Officials said the NATO panel considering aircraft cuts will meet
weekly until September to beat what Altenburg termed the ``very
severe time factor'' Bush put on his proposals.
   ``For instance, how is this to be broken down among the different
nations? We have to consider the role each nation has.''
   U.S. officials said there was ``general agreement'' among the
ministers not to reduce British and French planes that can carry
conventional or nuclear bombs.
   Also excluded, they said, must be the 72 U.S. Air Force F-16 jets
NATO will be moving from Torrejon Air Base near Madrid to a base in
southern Italy.
   The move follows Spain's decision to end a basing accord with the
United States.
   The ministers reviewed on Thursday their efforts to maintain an
equitable sharing of NATO's defense costs _ an issue that has
generated criticism in the U.S. Congress that many NATO allies do
not pull their weight in NATO.

   President Bush indicated Thursday he plans a
hard-line approach on new clean-air standards that will
``significantly improve'' the quality of life of all North Americans.
   Bush, who will unveil his clean-air package Monday, met with
industry leaders who said they pleaded against coming up with
standards too tough to be affordable.
   ``We urged him to make certain that, when the dust settles on
clean air, that we have a healthy economy left,'' said William D.
Fay, administrator of the Clean Air Working Group, a business
coalition.
   ``We'll have to wait until Monday to see whether or not the point
got through,'' Fay said after he and other industry officials met
with Bush at the White House.
   Later, at a session with environmental leaders, Bush indicated he
was ready to move ahead with strong measures, participants said.
   ``He said that he agreed this is a freight train coming down the
track,'' said George Frampton, president of the Wilderness Society.
``He felt that he strongly personally wanted to be out front on
this.''
   Ruth Caplan, executive director of Environmental Action, said
``We are calling on him to again do a NATO. It is time for him to
exercise leadership and call for strong measures to protect the
health of the American people.'' She was referring to Bush's
dramatic call last month for unilateral troop cuts in Europe.
   She said Bush was given information on air quality in
Kennebunkport, Maine, where he has a vacation home. ``He was shocked
to know that last summer, there were many days in which there were
serious health problems from ozone smog,'' she said.
   White House aides, as well as participants at both the industry
and environmental meetings, insisted Bush has not made up his mind
on many aspects of the package, the first major overhaul of the 1970
Clean Air Act in 12 years.
   Administration aides, speaking on the condition of anonymity,
said, however, that Bush had already decided on many key parts of
the legislation _ including tough new standards for cleaning up
smokestack emissions that cause acid rain, changes that would prove
costly to industry.
   The president has also decided on rigid new standards to prevent
chemical contamination of the air.
   These standards will be far-reaching, extending to hundreds of
categories of businesses, ranging from paint factories to bakeries,
the sources said.
   Such suggestions prompted praise from congressional Democrats
even before Bush submitted his proposal. ``He has wholly reversed
the position of the Reagan administration on this subject,'' said
Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell of Maine.
   Speaking to a hunters' conservation group, Bush reinforced the
contention that his proposals would prove costly to industry and be
wide-ranging.
   ``For too long, we've focused on cleanup and penalties after the
damage is already done. It's time to reorient ourselves using
technologies and processes that reduce or prevent pollution _ to
stop it before it starts. In the 1990s, pollution prevention will go
right to the sources,'' Bush said.
   Power plants and other industries that burn coal in the Midwest,
many of which disperse their pollutants through tall smokestacks
without technological controls, will be a key target of Bush's
clean-air attack, the sources said.
   These emissions have been cited as a major cause in the acid-rain
pollution that afflicts lakes and wildlife in Canada and the
Northeastern United States.
   In his remarks to Ducks Unlimited, a conservation group of
waterfowl hunters that seeks to protect and preserve wetlands, Bush
declared: ``I will unveil the most sweeping changes to the Clean Air
Act since it was last amended 12 years ago.''
   ``It will allow us to recover and restore precious forests, lakes
and streams. And whether Americans live near factories, in cities,
or in high woodland country, it will significantly improve every
North American's quality of life.''
   Roger B. Smith, chairman of General Motors, said the industry
leaders who met with Bush ``asked the president for a flexible
solution that would be cost effective. And he said he hadn't made up
his mind on a lot of factors yet.''
   ``He didn't make any commitments on anything. We need to have a
bill that's on an economically sound basis,'' he said.
   Smith voiced some skepticism toward one feature that Bush has
said will be in the legislation _ a program to encourage alternate
motor fuels such as alcohol blends.
   ``We need more studies on alternate fuels,'' Smith said. He said
that car engines that can accept alcohol blends use greater volumes
of fuel than gasoline-only engines _ suggesting either larger fuel
tanks in vehicles or the building of more service stations.
   Richard Lesher, president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said
Bush left little doubt that he will submit a tough bill.
   ``We hope this bill will reflect flexibility,'' he said. ``It
will be a strong bill. But this is a starting point rather than an
ending point.''
   Lesher said that much would happen to the bill when it gets to
Congress, where rival clean-air measures are already advancing
through both chambers.

<HEAD>Studies Say Services Can Save Money If They Rely on Ads</HEAD>

   The armed forces can save money if they rely on
advertising to obtain recruits instead of more recruiters or cash
bonuses, according to studies released Thursday.
   And at least in the case of the Army, they said the advertising
should be placed in national magazines and local newspapers first,
with television the next priority and local radio last.
   The report on military advertising was issued by the Rand Corp.,
a Pentagon-supported think tank based in Santa Monica, Calif. It was
asked to study the issue by the Defense Department's manpower office.
   Rand issued two studies, one focusing on Army advertising efforts
and the other assessing whether the services should do their own ads
or whether ``joint'' ads with the other armed forces work as well.
   The studies, focusing on military advertising campaigns from 1981
to 1984, were done by researchers James N. Dertouzos and J. Michael
Polich.
   The research dealing with the Army found advertising does make a
difference in an era of the all-volunteer military and cuts in the
ad budget will hurt.
   ``The empirical results show that, in general, advertising
expenditures in a given month have a significant and immediate
effect on the number of high-quality enlistments in the Army,'' the
study said.
   ``We estimated the marginal cost of recruiting a high-quality
person through increased advertising to be between $5,000 and
$6,000. The marginal cost of achieving the same goal by increasing
the recruiting staff was about $5,700, and the cost of using cash
bonuses was much higher, about $16,000 per recruit.''
   There also appear to be significant differences among the media
in their cost effectiveness, at least for the Army, the study
continued.
   ``National magazine and local newspaper advertising are the most
cost effective in promoting short-run enlistment responses, costing
$2,000 and $3,400 per additional recruit. National broadcasting
purchases also have strong effects but ... appear to cost somewhat
more than the print media, $7,000 to $10,000 per marginal recruit.
   ``At the other extreme, local radio has no detectable effect on
short-run enlistments.''
   In 1984, the study said, the Army spent $45 million on recruiting
ads and used two-thirds of that money for TV spots.
   As for the issue of individual ``service'' advertisements as
opposed to ``joint'' ads, the second study concluded both types
``appear to be very powerful tools'' and in general can produce a
new recruit for roughly the same outlay of cash.
   The Army and Navy, however, do appear to benefit the most from
joint ads, while the Air Force and Marine Corps seem to do the best
with individual ads.
   ``But in general, ... the gains of any one branch do not seem to
come at the expense, in terms of lost recruits, of any othr,'' the
study said.
   ``Each branch gained recruits from the civilian population rather
than at the others' expense.''

   Thousands of ethnic rioters attacked government
offices and a police station in Uzbekistan in a bloody bid to seize
firearms, raising the death toll in a five-day rampage to at least
71, official media said Thursday.
   ``Corpses are being found in gutted houses and the wounded are
dying in hospitals,'' Uzbek Premier Gairat Kadyrov told the
government newspaper Izvestia.
   At least 71 people were killed and the figure was likely to
continue climbing, he said.
   The violence began June 3 with fighting between ethnic Uzbeks and
the Meskhi Turk minority, forcibly resettled in the Fergana Valley
of Uzbekistan by Stalin in 1944.
   Officials have not been able to contain it despite evacuating
more than 10,000 of the Meskhi minority and sending in 9,000
Interior Ministry soldiers.
   Communist Party officials asked the Congress of People's Deputies
parliament Thursday to approve ``more decisive measures to stabilize
the situation'' in Uzbekistan, deputy Alexei Yastrebov said in a
telephone interview. He represents the Ural Mountains region of
Russia.
   Yastrebov said he could not specify measures under consideration.
He said a group of deputies, including some from Uzbekistan, were
told to investigate the latest developments and report back to the
Congress on Friday before a decision is taken.
   West German sources said in Bonn on Thursday that Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has cut the agenda for his four-day
West German visit next week to stay in touch with the Kremlin over
events in his troubled nation.
   They cited the unrest in Uzbekistan as one factor.
   The bloodshed in eastern Uzbekistan was the latest in a series of
violent clashes that have embroiled the southern rim of the Soviet
Union for more than a year.
   Scores of people have been killed in the Caucasus republics of
Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan, but the violence has spread
recently to Turkmenia and Uzbekistan in Central Asia.
   The Tass news agency said the latest spark was Wednesday in
Kokand when ``thousands of people excited by alcohol, drugs and
calls for violence ... stormed the city police department to seize
firearms.''
   At the same time a crowd of 500 to 600 attacked a local Interior
Ministry transportation office, it said.
   The attacks failed, but a preliminary count indicated six people
were killed. More than 90, including soldiers, were injured.
Sixty-five houses and six offices were burned down, it said.
   ``More houses are burning,'' Tass added.
   Tass said the soldiers were given orders to shoot to protect
themselves, but so far had avoided opening fire.
   ``The crowds of attackers have been dispersed and most active
rioters have been detained,'' it said.
   Official Radio Moscow said more than 600 people have been hurt
and more than 400 suspects in the ethnic violence have been arrested.
   The official radio said that shooting and arson attempts
continued Wednesday night in the regional center of Fergana, with a
population of more than 200,000. More than 400 houses, most of them
belonging to Meskhi Turks, had been burned down.
   The official reports did not specify which ethnic group was
responsible for the attacks in Kokand, but it was likely Uzbeks
because the Meskhis have been the victims of most of the violence
and many of them already have been evacuated.
   Uzbek sources said the violence, which started with a dispute
over the price of strawberries in a bazaar, erupted because of
smoldering resentment among Uzbeks over what they see as
preferential treatment of the minority.
   The dispute led to a wave of ``pogroms, arson, beatings and
murder, accompanied by harassment and rape in conjunction with
insolent marauding, resistance to police and internal security
forces,'' Kadyrov said.
   ``Passions are still boiling,'' Izvestia added.
   The Uzbek grassroots movement Berlik called on the Congress to
remedy living conditions, which it said was an underlying cause of
the bloodshed.
   The activists claim cotton production quotas imposed by Moscow
has forced Uzbekistan to neglect food crops. Meanwhile, the campaign
to boost cotton production has forced farms to poison the
enviromment with vast quantities of chemical fertilizers and
pesticides, they say.

   Sen. John Glenn said he may subpoena drug czar
William J. Bennett after Bennett declined to testify Thursday before
a Senate committee on the drug problem in the nation's capital.
   ``We had hoped today to hear from William Bennett, the director
of National Drug Control Policy, about his plan for the District of
Columbia,'' said Glenn, chairman of the Senate Committee on
Governmental Affairs. ``Unfortunately ... Mr. Bennett refuses to
testify, at least until Sept. 8.''
   Don Hamilton, a spokesman for Bennett, said 74 different
congressional committees and subcommittes claim responsibility for
the federal anti-drug effort. ``The director can't satisfy everyone
and at the same time prepare the national strategy he's required by
law to prepare by Sept. 5,'' said Hamilton.
   At the hearing, the committee heard witnesses including District
of Columbia Mayor Marion Barry Jr. and FBI Deputy Assistant Director
Anthony Daniels on the district's drug trafficking problem, which
authorities have blamed for a record annual murder rate two years in
a row.
   Glenn, an Ohio Democrat, said his staff offered to change the
date of the hearing to fit Bennett's schedule, but he still declined.
   ``We're trying to work together with Mr. Bennett, trying to give
him support, trying to get funding for his programs ... and he can't
give us the time of day, anytime,'' said Glenn.
   Glenn said Bennett would appear before the committee if he had to
issue a subpoena to compel his testimony. He said he had a letter
delivered to Bennett's office early Thursday expressing his
concerns, but did not disclose details of the letter.
   Earlier this year, Bennett drafted a national anti-drug plan that
calls for construction of new pre-trial detention and prison
facilities, expansion of a local law enforcement task force, efforts
to rid public housing of drug users and dealers, expansion of drug
treatment facilities and an increase in job training programs.
   However, Bennett criticized the district government and said the
city would receive no direct funds from the estimated $70 million to
$80 million sought for the program.
   Washington led the nation in murders per capita last year with
372 slayings, most of them drug-related. This year, there have been
197 homicides, compared with 127 at the same time last year.

   Chinese Red Cross officials estimate
3,600 people were killed in the military assault on pro-democracy
demonstrators in Beijing, a Chinese students' organization said
Thursday.
   The Union of Chinese Students in the Federal Republic also urged
the West German government to impose sanctions on China for the
weekend killings.
   Hu Bo, a university student in Munich, said the union found out
through communications with friends in China that the Chinese Red
Cross estimates 3,600 people died and 60,000 were injured when
soldiers routed protesters from Tiananmen Square.
   The Chinese government says nearly 300 people, mostly soldiers,
were killed. Chinese and foreign diplomats say up to 3,000 died.
   At a news conference in Bonn, the union presented a young man who
the students said was a witness to the bloodshed in Beijing and had
just returned to West Germany.
   The Chinese man, who said he works for a company in West Germany,
said army troops in Beijing shot indiscriminately at civilians and
their homes.
   ``I still have not recovered from this. It disturbs me very
much,'' said the man, who would not give his name for fear of
possible retaliation against his relatives.
   ``A nurse I know went looking for her husband at a hospital.
Bodies there were stacked one on top of the other,'' said the man.
   The man said hospital officials told his nurse friend, ``How can
we look for him? There are so many bodies.''

   An accountant accused of killing five family
members 18 years ago was transferred from federal to state custody
Thursday, but his wife insisted that authorities had the wrong man.
   In a brief hearing, U.S. Magistrate David G. Lowe authorized
federal officials to release Robert P. Clark, who authorities say
actually is New Jersey fugitive John E. List, into Virginia custody
until he can be extradited. Later Thursday, a county judge set a
hearing for July 6 and ordered him jailed without bail.
   Clark's wife, Delores, said at a news conference that she does
not believe her husband is the 63-year-old List, who is charged with
murdering his mother, wife, and three children in 1971.
   ``I love my husband very deeply. I do not believe this is the
same man,'' she said.
   Mrs. Clark said she had seen her husband in jail but they had not
discussed the case.
   Clark has not admitted he is List, but authorities have
identified him by his fingerprints and physical markings.
   ``I anticipate having no trouble identifying him and bringing him
to trial,'' said Assistant Prosecutor Eleanor Clark in Union County,
N.J.
   Clark was arrested June 1 at the Richmond accounting firm where
he had worked for a year and a half. FBI agents had been tipped off
by a viewer of the national television program ``America's Most
Wanted,'' which 11 days earlier had run a segment focusing on List.
   Authorities say List had fled to Colorado, then Virginia, and had
built a new life without changing his appearance, profession or
reputation as a quiet, churchgoing Lutheran.
   ``I'm looking forward to seeing him,'' said Westfield, N.J.,
Detective Lt. Bernard Tracy, who has been working on the List case
for 10 years. ``He's had 18 years of freedom and it's time the
prosecution started and he pay for his crimes.''
   ``It's gratifying as a prosecutor when someone who has
intentionally been eluding you so long is finally apprehended and
can be brought back,'' said Union County Assistant Prosecutor David
Hancock. ``It kind of brings a close to a chapter in one of the most
notorious murder cases in Union history.''

   Fog delayed some flights and the painters hadn't
finished rehabbing Eastern's planes, but Donald Trump was greeted
like a conquering hero Thursday as he christened his new shuttle
with champagne, Mozart and glitz.
   The Trump Shuttle, newly acquired from strikebound Eastern
Airlines for $365 million, carried its billionaire boss from New
York to Washington and back, on to Boston and back to New York. At
every stop, he was met by ebullient crowds in airport terminals.
   In New York's crowded LaGuardia terminal, festooned with red and
white balloons, a string quartet played Mozart near a buffet laden
with mimosa cocktails of champagne and orange juice, muffins and
fresh fruit.
   ``I think this is fabulous,'' said one young businessman en route
to Boston.
   But Trump couldn't meet his advertised claim for getting the
flights off precisely on time. The 8 a.m. EDT flight from LaGuardia
to Washington National took off at about 8:17 a.m., while a flight
from Washington to New York was delayed by the weather and heavy
traffic.
   Trump personally greeted passengers boarding the flight from New
York to Washington, which was packed with reporters and regular
travelers. At one point during the flight, the billionaire grabbed
the public address microphone to announce, ``Ladies and gentlemen,
this is your flight attendant.''
   A crew member announced a slight detour as the flight entered
airspace over Atlantic City, N.J., where Trump owns several big
gambling hotels.
   Flight attendants, dressed in temporary navy-blue uniforms with
burgundy stripes on the sleeves, handed out miniature bottles of
champagne.
   ``The name `Trump' carries a lot of weight,'' said flight
attendant Denise McCain, 33, an 11-year Eastern veteran. ``We're all
very excited about it.''
   Most of the Northeast shuttle's employees worked for Eastern
before the crippling strike against the Miami-based carrier began
three months ago and pushed the airline into bankruptcy court.
   For many long-time Eastern employees, Trump's debut was
bittersweet. They were relieved to be working again but sad about
colleagues left behind on picket lines.
   ``Our hearts are with them, our thoughts are with them,'' flight
captain Ed Comer said. ``I wish them the best of luck.''
   Comer, an Eastern pilot for 25 years, now is chief pilot for
Trump Shuttle.
   The real estate tycoon signed the papers formally closing the
sale on Wednesday and staff worked through the night to clean planes
and put up new signs at the terminals.
   Some changes will take more time. Only four of Trump Shuttle's
fleet of 21 Boeing 727s had been repainted by opening day in the new
color scheme: white fuselage with red, black and gold stripes, the
word ``Trump'' above the stripes and a red ``T'' on the tail.
   Several aircraft sitting on the ramp looked like the hybrids they
were: ``Trump'' had been painted in red above the familiar Eastern
silver and blue.
   Inside, the planes still had the old brown-gold Eastern color
scheme. Trump plans to refurbish the interiors in burgundy and
saddle-brown tones, with chrome and maple wood veneer accents.
   Trump and the other passengers arriving at Washington National
were welcomed by a string and accordion quintet playing ``Casino
Royale'' and ``New York, New York.''
   A statuesque blond violinist, Janette Wilkinson, mugged with
Trump for photographers. And of course there was more champagne,
passed around by waiters in formal black-tie who also proffered
canapes.
   ``The enthusiasm of the people working for the airline is
unbelievable,'' Trump told a news conference at Washington airport.
He promised shuttle fares, $99 each way and $69 on weekends, will
remain unchanged for the near future.

   Pakistan Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto on
Thursday urged nations with strong democratic traditions to help
reinforce fledging democracies like her own by forming an
Association of Democratic Nations.
   ``Democracy needs support and the best support for democracy
comes from other democracies. ... Democratic nations should ... come
together in an association designed to help each other and promote
what is a universal value _ democracy,'' Ms. Bhutto said in her
keynote address at 338th commencement exercises at Harvard
University, her alma mater.
   Ms. Bhutto said the association could help bolster freedom by
sending observers to monitor elections in countries struggling to
maintain democracy.
   ``It is much harder to steal an election if the whole world is
watching,'' Ms. Bhutto told an estimated crowd of 25,000.
   An association of democracies could also mobilize world opinion
against leaders of any coup and take such steps as economic
sanctions while using foreign aid as a reward for democracy, she
said.
   ``There is nothing wrong with rewarding an idea in which the
donors believe. The prospects for democracy may depend upon it,''
she said.
   Ms. Bhutto added a plea for understanding Muslim countries,
saying many outsiders mistakenly believe democracy can't survive in
a country like Pakistan.
   ``But I stand before you, a Muslim woman, the elected prime
minister of one hundred million Muslims, a living refutation of such
arguments,'' she said.
   The 35-year-old prime minister, the first woman in modern times
to lead a Moslem country, is a 1973 graduate of Radcliffe.
   When asked at a brief news conference later to comment on recent
events in China, Ms. Bhutto said, ``Pakistan and China have a very
old association and friendship and it was through Pakistan that the
United States restored its links with China.
   ``We regret the loss of human lives and would like to see a
return to the restraint that was initially taken,'' she continued.
``Many who have friendships with China have been very disturbed with
what has been going on there.''
   Ms. Bhutto, who also holds a degree from Oxford University,
picked up the populist political mantle of her father, deposed and
executed Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto.
   The elder Bhutto was overthrown in 1977 by Gen. Mohammed Zia
ul-Haq and executed by hanging two years later. In the ensuing
years, Benazir, oldest of Bhutto's four children and the one he
tapped as his political successor, spent seven years in arrest and
detention. She went into self-imposed exile in 1984 and from England
she became leader-in-exile of the Pakistan People's Party.
   In 1986 she returned home. Three months after Zia was killed in a
plane crash, Ms. Bhutto claimed victory in the first democratic
election in her country in 11 years.
   Since her arrival in the United States on Monday, Ms. Bhutto has
met privately with President Bush and other government officials and
addressed Congress. She planned to visit the United Nations on
Friday before departing the next day for Pakistan.

   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher on Thursday
rejected a request by Hong Kong's governor to grant 3.25 million
Chinese residents in the territory the right to emigrate to Britain.
   Hong Kong is due to be handed over to China in 1997, and fears
that China will not honor an agreement to preserve the colony's
capitalist system for 50 years increased after the violent crackdown
on pro-democracy demonstrations in Beijing.
   In a 90-minute emergency meeting, Governor Sir David Wilson said
he told Mrs. Thatcher that granting the right of entry to Chinese
carrying British passports ``would do an immense amount of good in
Hong Kong.''
   Wilson, speaking to reporters outside Mrs. Thatcher's 10 Downing
Street residence, said Mrs. Thatcher replied ``that would be a
matter of grave political difficulty,'' while reiterating promises
to be more flexible.
   Thousands of Hong Kong Chinese, usually the better off and best
educated, have already emigrated, mainly to Canada, Australia and
the United States.
   Mrs. Thatcher this week ruled out allowing large-scale
immigration from Hong Kong but promised to be more ``flexible''
about special categories, such as senior public servants and people
with private incomes.

<TEXT>
   Senators advocating disability benefits for
Vietnam veterans suffering from cancer they believe caused by Agent
Orange said Thursday they were confident of finally winning
congressional passage after repeated setbacks.
   Sen. John F. Kerry, D-Mass., said the compromise bill would
provide interim disability benefits to veterans who were exposed to
the chemical defoliant during the Vietnam War and now suffer from
either non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or soft-tissue sarcoma.
   Under the bill, disability benefits would extend only through
1993. Survivors' benefits for spouses would go through mid-April
1992. Congress, which by then would have received a new study by the
Centers for Disease Control, would have to vote to continue the
benefits.
   The measure is needed ``not only to help veterans with their
medical difficulties, but it is also important as a statement that
we intend to make good on our promises to help those who fought in
the war,'' said Kerry, a former Navy lieutenant who piloted a patrol
boat in the Mekong Delta.
   ``Too many veterans remember what it was like to fight the VC
(Viet Cong) They didn't have to come back here to fight the VA
(Veterans Administration, the name still used for the Veterans
Department),'' the senator said.
   Separate Agent Orange bills sponsored by Kerry and Sen. Thomas
Daschle, D-S.D., failed in 1987 and again last year. The Reagan
administration steadfastly opposed the proposals, saying more
scientific evidence was needed to link the chemical defoliant used
by U.S. forces in Southeast Asia to the cancers in the light of
several studies that failed to find such a link.
   But Kerry and Daschle, at a news conference introducing the
legislation, said positive signs from both the new administration
and Capitol Hill account for their optimism.
   The senators said they were encouraged by Veterans Affairs
Secretary Ed Derwinski and his decision last month not to appeal a
federal appeals court's decision striking down regulations to
restrict compensation for Agent Orange victims.
   Derwinski also ordered reviews of the cases of all Vietnam
veterans whose Agent Orange claims were denied. Daschle praised
Derwinski as the ``most sympathetic'' head of the Veterans
Administration since the Vietnam War.
   The bill's prospects improved when Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif.,
chairman of the Senate Veterans' Affairs, backed it late last year
after various changes to narrow its scope.
   The measure would cost an estimated $19 million annually in
benefits, Senate aides said.

<HEAD>Salvadorans Improperly Transferred U.S. Fuel to Contras, GAO Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   El Salvador's air force improperly sold
$100,000 worth of fuel provided by the United States to air crews
resupplying the Nicaraguan Contras in an effort set up by Oliver
North, the General Accounting Office told Congress Thursday.
   Assistant Comptroller General Frank C. Conahan testified that the
transfer of the fuel ``violated agreements between the United States
and El Salvador stipulating that title or possession of
U.S.-supplied defense items or services cannot be transferred
without prior U.S. government consent.''
   Conahan said pilots under contract to the Contra resupply
operation run by former Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard V. Secord bought
fuel on at least 63 occasions in 1986 from tanks on the military
side of Ilopango Air Base. He said U.S.-supplied fuel was provided
on 32 of those occasions.
   Conahan testified on behalf of the GAO, an investigatory arm of
Congress, before the Senate Appropriations Foreign Operations
subcommittee.
   Felix Rodriquez, a private individual supporting the Contra
effort, had, at the request of National Security Council official
Oliver North, set up an operations center at the Ilopango base to
use air drops inside Nicaragua to resuply the Contras.
   Conahan said that from April to September 1986 the Salvadoran air
force old 61,107 gallons of the U.S.-provided fuel to the Contra
resupply enterprise.
   ``We found no evidence that the Salvadoran government requested
or obtained U.S. consent for the Salvadoran air force to transfer
military aid program funded fuel to the Contra supply operation,''
Conahan said.
   Nor, he said, was evidence found that any U.S. personnel knew of
the sales.
   But he said a ``substantial violation'' of the 1986 sales
agreement with El Salvador may have occurred because the transfers
took place at a time when the United States was barred by law from
using aid funds to support military or paramilitary operations of
the Contras.
   Conahan said it was also learned that the Salvadoran air force
sold nearly a million gallons of aviation fuel worth some $580,000
to U.S. military and contract aircraft delivering non-lethal aid to
the Contras.
   He said the GAO accepted as ``reasonable'' the explanation that
those transfers were not improper because the U.S. government
provided the fuel in the first place and because it was transferred
to U.S. entities.
   But Sen. Patrick J. Leahy, D-Vt., chairman of the Foreign
Operations subcommittee, said it would seem ``unique'' that the
United States put itself in the position of first giving away the
fuel, then paying for it.
   ``You could well say we were paying for it twice,'' he said.
   Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, who initiated the investigation, said
the GAO had ``uncovered the first documented case of a transfer of
U.S. foreign aid dollars to the Contra resupply network.''
   Additionally, he said, when sales to other ``third-party''
aircraft are taken into account, ``the Salvadoran air force received
$800,000 in cash for fuel it received free under the U.S. foreign
aid program.''
   Michael Kozak, acting assistant secretary for state for
Inter-American Affairs, acknowleged that the sales and transfers did
take place.
   But he said the department does not believe the violation to be
``substantial,'' given the fact that the United States gave El
Salvador $230 million worth of aviation fuel in 1986 and 1987.
   ``Furthermore, it does not appear that the transferred fuel
sustained the Nicaraguan resistance resupply operations over an
extended period of time, nor does it appear that this was support
that the resistance could not have purchased from any commercial
facility,'' he said.
   Kozak said a ``lack of understanding'' on the part of ground
personnel at Ilopango as to which fuel required U.S. permission
before it could be transferred ``seems to have been the main, if not
the most important, factor in this unauthorized diversion.''
   H. Diehl McKalip, operations director of the Defense Security
Assistance Agency, said that because of a concern that assistance
funds might have been or might be ``converted into unrestricted
cash,'' regulations have been issued to assure that any future funds
generated from fuel transfers be deposited in a special holding
account.
   Prior to the change, he said, $801,519 was paid directly to the
Salvadoran air force. Since the change, $973,543 has been credited
to the holding account, McKalip said.

<HEAD>John Paul Meets Palme's Widow</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CECILIA LONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II on Thursday met the
widow of slain Prime Minister Olof Palme, who established relations
with the Vatican seven years ago.
   Lisbet Palme met for 15 minutes with the pope, who ``spoke with
warmth about Olof Palme's visits to the Vatican'' before he was
gunned down in Stockholm in 1986, said Prime Minister Ingvar
Carlsson, who was at the meeting.
   Carlsson said the pontiff had asked to see Mrs. Palme, who is due
to testify next week against in the murder trial of Christer
Pettersson, which began on Monday. Pettersson was arrested last
December.
   Sweden, an overwhelmingly Lutheran country, established
diplomatic relations with the Holy See in 1982, largely because of
Palme's admiration for John Paul's concern for social issues. Palme
visited the Vatican twice.
   Mrs. Palme spoke with the pope about her work as head of the
Swedish chapter of UNICEF, the U.N. organization for children,
Carlsson said.
   Carlsson met separately with John Paul on political issues
focusing on eastern Europe and the elections in the pontiff's native
Poland.
   Sweden was the final leg on a five-nation tour of Scandinavia,
where the John Paul has been extolling the virtues of traditional
religious teachings in an area with liberal views on sex, marriage
and birth control.
   In one of his strongest homilies on the subject during his 10-day
pilgrimage, the pope told a mass of 16,000 people that ``the future
of humanity comes by way of the family.''
   ``It is not alway easy today for married couples to live in a
lifelong covenant marked by mutual fidelity, respect and love,'' he
said.
   Sweden's liberal attitudes prompted reporters to ask a senior
Vatican official, Australian archbishop Edward Cassidy, why the pope
would come to a country that permits abortion and accepts
homosexuality, and where the divorce rate is high among the 50
percent of couples who bother to marry.
   ``It's a conflict of what one considers the common good,'' said
the Vatican's undersecretary of state. ``The pope either preaches
the gospel or he doesn't preach.''
   Many of Sweden's 135,000 Catholics are immigrants from more than
50 countries, and the pope could see colorful costumes of a dozen
nationalities as he gazed from the podium of the spherical Globe
sports stadium.
   ``Pray for Chinese Students,'' read one banner waving from the
crowd.
   In a remark directed at the immigrants and at some Swedes who are
reluctant to accept them, John Paul urged them to practice ``full
participation in the social, political and cultural life of Sweden.''
   ``Not only native-born Swedes, but also immigrants need to take
their proper place in society so that they too can make a positive
contribution to the country to which they now belong,'' he said.

<HEAD>HUD To Reopen Investigation Into Long Island Housing Program</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: New throughout with Kemp ordering investigation reopened, McGann
taking administrative leave, other details; No pickup</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KIM I. MILLS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Department of Housing and Urban Development
will reopen a probe into an alleged scheme to rig the awarding of
federally subsidized housing in Island Park, N.Y., HUD Secretary
Jack Kemp announced Thursday.
   ``I have asked the inspector general to reopen his investigation
into the situation surrounding Geraldine McGann and the allocation
of federally subsidized housing in the village of Island Park,
N.Y.,'' Kemp said in a news release.
   Mrs. McGann, HUD's region II adminstrator, is at the center of
the controversy. Her son, Daniel McGann, was among those chosen to
purchase a $44,500 house in the program. Mrs. McGann is a village
board member and last year was appointed HUD's Region II
administrator.
   A cousin of Republican Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, a longtime resident
of Island Park, also benefitted from the program by buying a home
for $40,000, according to a HUD audit.
   Mrs. McGann asked for and was granted an administrative leave,
Kemp said Thursday. She will continue to collect her $68,500 annual
salary, according to HUD spokesman Robert E. Nipp.
   Mrs. McGann could not be reached for comment Thursday. A woman
answering the phone in her office said Mrs. McGann would not be at
work.
   The new investigation was triggered by a report in The New York
Times that officials in Island Park, a predominantly white Long
Island village, had distributed federally subsidized homes to
politically connected people and excluded blacks between 1980 and
1984. The Times based its story on a 1984 HUD audit of the program.
   Kemp also announced high-level HUD employees will no longer be
allowed to serve on state or local government boards, agencies or
panels, and no HUD employee at any level may serve on any such body
that does business with the department.
   In addition, Kemp said in the statement that HUD discretionary
funds will be targeted at ending homelessness, enforcing fair
housing and creating enterprise zones, for example.
   The Times report noted that D'Amato had persuaded former Housing
Secretary Samuel Piece to earmark $425,000 from the fund for a
swimming pool in the oceanfront community. The pool has not been
built because the project has been tied up in local politics.
   D'Amato's cousin, Anthony Ciccimarro, paid $40,000 for one of the
subsidized houses, according to the 1984 audit.
   On Thursday, D'Amato denied any involvement, and termed the
program ``excellent.''
   ``I know of no abuse and I know of no preferential treatment,''
D'Amato told a news conference. ``I wrote no applications nor made
any applications on (people's) behalf. Had they asked me I would
have. I thought the program was a good program.''
   Under the HUD program, Island Park, which has a population of
4,200 and is 97 percent white, received enough money to build 44
homes to be sold at $40,000 to $64,000 each. HUD proposed that 17 of
the 22 houses to be built during the project's second phase be sold
to blacks from nearby areas, but none were.
   The HUD houses were supposed to be advertised in local newspapers
to reach lower-income buyers, especially minorities. But some
residents were tipped off, and by the time the ads appeared, 22
buyers had been selected, the Times said.
   D'Amato said he did not believe there were tips or that no houses
were purchased by members of minority groups.
   He blamed the Times story on ``a disgruntled former employee,''
Harry Scully, who was Island Park's village clerk at the time.
   ``It's obvious that the former village clerk, Harry Scully, has
changed his story in order to attack his former associates on the
village board for whatever reasons, and that saddens me,'' D'Amato
said.
   Scully told the Times that he misled HUD officials probing the
program in 1984. He said Mrs. McGann had called him to inquire about
a HUD house for her son, and also said he had covered up for her.
   Scully did not immediately return a message left on his answering
machine.
   D'Amato said the story was based primarily on a 5-year-old
preliminary audit.
   ``I've been given to believe that the inspector general's final
report did not concur with that 5-year-old preliminary audit, and
found no evidence of wrongdoing,'' he said.
   HUD Inspector General Paul Adams said he did not know what final
report D'Amato was referring to.

<HEAD>Puerto Rican Nationalists Get Maximum Sentence in $7.1 Million Robbery</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Three Puerto Rican nationalists drew
maximum sentences of up to 15 years in prison Thursday for their
roles in a $7.1 million Wells Fargo robbery in 1983.
   But one of them, Roberto Maldonado Rivera, a civil rights
attorney from Puerto Rico, was released on $200,000 bond pending
appeal of his conviction on a conspiracy charge. Maldonado, 53, had
been free on the same bond prior to his sentencing.
   U.S. District Judge T. Emmet Clarie agreed to a bond after
expressing concern about Maldonado's high blood pressure and
acknowledging that grounds exist for an appeal to the 2nd U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals. Earlier, the judge sentenced Maldonado to
five years in prison and fined him $100,000.
   ``I'm very happy that I can go back home,'' a jubilant Maldonado
said outside the courtroom.
   The defendant receiving the stiffest penalty was Antonio Camacho
Negron, a 45-year-old auto mechanic. He was given a 15-year prison
term and fined $150,000 on a conspiracy count and a charge of
assisting in the transfer of some of the stolen cash to Mexico.
   The third man, Norman Ramirez Talavera, a 32-year-old graphic
artist convicted on a conspiracy charge, received a five-year prison
term and was fined $50,000.
   Like Maldonado, Camacho and Ramirez told the court they will
appeal their cases.
   ``I struggled for the liberty of Puerto Rico,'' said Camacho, who
strode into the courtroom with his fist raised and wearing a red
carnation. His supporters, including his wife, also stood with
raised fists.
   The judge rejected the political argument, just as he had
throughout the trial. ``There is no right to rob money,'' Clarie
said. ``It is a crime throughout the world. No one has been charged
because of his political views.''
   Afterward, U.S. Attorney Stanley A. Twardy Jr. said only that the
defendants had received the maximum prison terms ``and that's what
the government asked.'' He declined to comment on Maldonado's
continued release.
   The three defendants, who were convicted April 10, were said to
be members of a militant Puerto Rican separatist group, Los
Macheteros. Members of the organization are accused of engineering
the Sept. 12, 1983, theft of a half-ton of money from a Wells Fargo
depot in West Hartford to finance their activities.
   A fourth defendant, Juan Segarra Palmer, had his sentencing
postponed to next week. The 39-year-old Segarra, a Harvard
University graduate, is accused of masterminding the robbery and
faces up to 165 years in prison.
   None is accused of taking part in the actual holdup. A former
Wells Fargo security guard, Victor Gerena, is accused of taking the
money, only $80,000 of which has been recovered. He is believed to
be in Cuba.

<TEXT>
   The government said Thursday it has
rejected a Soviet extradition request for a Soviet air force pilot
who defected in a MiG-29 jet fighter, and it indicated it was
willing to send him to the United States.
   Capt. Alexander Zuyev landed at the airport in the Black Sea city
of Trabzon May 20 and requested political asylum in the United
States.
   Turkish officials, appearing anxious to limit the damage to
Turkish-Soviet relations, sent the jet back a day after the incident.
   The Soviet Union also asked Turkish officials to extradite the
pilot, saying he stole the sophisticated plane after shooting and
wounding a guard at Tskhakaya airport.
   Turkey denied the request and gave Zuyev's asylum petition to the
U.S. Embassy, according to a Foreign Ministry announcement Thursday.
   The statement said a Turkish court ruled Tuesday that the
accusations against Zuyev were political and military, allowing him
to qualify for refugee status. Soviet authorities had been informed
of the decision, the announcement said.
   U.S. officials have criticized Turkey for denying American
representatives a chance to inspect the aircraft and learn more
about the latest Soviet technology. Turkish officials have said the
matter concerns only Turkey and the Soviet Union.

least 30 survivors, official radio reported Thursday.
   Radio Mozambique said the accident occurred Wednesday at
Inhambane Bay on the southern coast.
   The report, monitored by the national news agency, AIM, said the
boat, named The Mozambique, was preparing to leave port at Inhambane
City to cross the bay to Maxixe.
   The radio said it was not known how many passengers the boat was
carrying, but 30 vessels were searching for more survivors. The
report said the cause of the accident was not known.
   Local authorities declared two days of morning in Inhambane

   Early this year, 40 people died when a ship sank in the bay, a
narrow inlet that penetrates about 25 miles into the coastline on
the Indian Ocean.

<HEAD>Cab Drivers Bury Third Co-Worker Since April Amid Fears of Serial
Killer</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Taxi drivers in this Atlanta suburb are
more wary about who they pick up, and some have stopped driving at
night since the slayings of four cabbies have sparked fears of a
serial killer.
   Three of the four drivers shot to death since April 1 worked for
the Day &amp; Night Cab Co., including 30-year-old Steve Trammell, who
was buried Wednesday. Some night shift drivers have stayed home this
week because they are afraid, said company manager Willard R. Dunson.
   ``They'll be back,'' he said. ``They just wanted to take a few
days off to think about things.''
   One cabbie who is still driving, Donald Simmons, said he is more
careful about who rides in his taxi, but he added that the job has
always had an element of danger.
   ``It is a very dangerous profession,'' said Joseph Hall, director
of the Atlanta Bureau of Taxicabs and Vehicles for Hire. ``You're
picking up a complete stranger. You're taking him wherever he wants
to go, and he's behind you. You're at a disadvantage.''
   Russell O'Neal, a Day &amp; Night driver who said he was Trammell's
best friend, said he now refuses any customer who doesn't come out
of the residence to which he has been summoned.
   Trammell's body was found Sunday in a creek about 250 yards from
his cab, which still had its lights on and engine running. Police
said he was beaten and shot twice, apparently after being forced out
of his taxi.
   The other three were slain in similar fashion, their bodies found
in the nearby suburb of East Point, College Park and inside Atlanta
city limits, near College Park.
   College Park police Detective Robert Jacks said authorities
haven't established for certain that one person is behind the
crimes. But he said they haven't ruled out that possibility either.
   ``Contrary to what people think, we don't really know if we've
got a serial killer,'' Jacks said. ``It could be a coincidence.
There are a whole lot of loose ends in this case.''
   Atlanta police Detective C.R. Price agreed, but added that the
serial killer theory is viable.
   ``We have reason to believe that because they (the slayings) all
occurred among cabbies working the south side,'' he said.
   Jacks said no physical evidence has been found so far to link the
killings, except that all the victims were cabbies, all worked in
the same area and robbery did not appear to be the sole motive.
   ``Some of the victims still had money on them, but of course you
don't know how much they had to begin with,'' Jacks said. ``There's
not enough evidence to say they were all robberies.''
   The Georgia Bureau of Investigation was brought into the case
this week to lend its expertise and crime laboratory to the three
police departments working on the killings, said spokesman John
Bankhead.
   Jacks said Trammell's taxi was being examined at the lab this
week for possible clues, such as hair and other fibers.
   Hall said 16 cab drivers in the city have died violently since
1980. That includes one of the four recent victims; the others were
found just outside the city limits.

   Vice President Quayle stretched a 20-minute
appointment Thursday with the editor of a dissident Soviet journal
into a one-hour, 10-minute discussion of ethnic violence in the
Soviet Union, a spokesman said.
   Sergei Grigoryants, editor of the unofficial magazine
``Glasnost'' later told a news conference that he had discussed with
Quayle the killing of 22 Soviet Georgians in the city of Tbilisi on
April 9.
   Grigoryants said he believed the killings had been orchestrated
by the Kremlin to provide a pretext for cracking down on democratic
movements in the Soviet Union, especially those in the non-Russian
republics.
   The killings, however, provoked an outcry in the Soviet
parliament and there has been no nation-wide crackdown. Grigoryants
version of events differed sharply from official accounts. A
commission of the Soviet parliament is investigating the Tbilisi
incident.
   Grigoryants, who has been in and out of jail since Soviet
Communist Party General Secretary Mikhail S. Gorbachev rose to power
in March 1985, called the Soviet leader ``a hell of a criminal.''
   A spokesman for Quayle said the vice president ``really enjoyed
taking to this guy.''
   ``He found him a fascinating and courageous man,'' said David
Beckwith. The spokesman declined to offer a judgment on Grigoryants
views, but said that extending the meeting by 50 minutes was unusual
and ``it disrupted the vice president's afternoon schedule.''

   Premier Li Peng on Thursday congratulated soldiers
who crushed a popular movement for democracy, and the government
urged citizens to turn in those who resisted the bloody military
raid on Tiananmen Square.
   Beijing was relatively quiet Thursday after days of random
shooting, but gunfire broke out again after dark. Unrest was
reported in other cities, and provincial leaders called for harsh
action against demonstrators.
   Soldiers fired weapons at about 11 p.m. in the direction of
foreign journalists outside the Jianguo Hotel on Changan Avenue,
Beijing's main boulevard, but it was not clear whether they were
aiming at the reporters.
   Hundreds of trucks in convoys moved tons of supplies into
Tiananmen overnight, and hundreds more continued the resupply
operation Thursday.
   For about an hour during one delivery, commuters on bicycles
ventured across Changan Avenue for the first time since Sunday, then
police closed it again.
   Chinese Red Cross officials estimate 3,600 people were killed and
60,000 injured in the weekend military assault on protesters,
according to a Chinese students' organization in West Germany, the
Union of Chinese Students in the Federal Republic. The government
says nearly 300 people, mostly soldiers, were killed, but Chinese
and foreign diplomats say up to 3,000 died.
   Li's televised speech to soldiers in the Great Hall of the
People, on Tiananmen Square, was his first public appearance since
the crackdown.
   ``You've done well, comrades,'' he told the cheering troopers,
and admonished them to ``continue working hard to protect the
capital's safety and order.''
   The hard-line premier ordered martial law May 20 after a series
of protests in which up to 1 million people rallied in the streets
to demand an end to official profiteering and corruption and more
democratic freedoms.
   In the government's attempt to establish its own version of
events, which includes a statement Wednesday that no one was killed
in the square, television showed civilians burning military trucks
and armored personnel carriers, and the charred bodies of three
soldiers, one with his stomach slit open.
   Evening television also showed soldiers stooping to clear gravel
and debris from littered streets and others, with smiles, aiding
elderly people with slight injuries.
   The government declared student and labor organizers to be
``important members of the counterrevolutionary turmoil,'' and
ordered leaders of the pro-democracy movement to give themselves up.
   Radio and television urged people to turn in fellow citizens who
had engaged in ``hooliganism and destruction,'' broadcasting
telephone numbers for the convenience of informers.
   Students who organized the seven-week campaign said they had gone
underground but would continue the fight for democratic rights.
   ``We are prepared to drop our peaceful methods and take stronger
action against the government,'' said one who telephoned The
Associated Press.
   A student at Beijing Normal University, a center of the movement,
said: ``We don't know what to do. We are waiting for orders, but our
leaders are all gone.''
   Another said: ``Maybe new leaders will have to emerge. The
movement hasn't ended. Things may be calm for awhile, but the army
can't stay forever. When it goes, we students will protest again.''
   Eighty tanks were stationed at Tiananmen Square, including 40 in
front of the Gate of Heavenly Peace, with their guns pointed toward
the south.
   Two groups of 10 tanks each faced north along Changan, flanking
40 armored personnel carriers. Behind them were about 10,000
soldiers in formation, jogging or standing.
   It was not clear whether the soldiers were from the 27th army,
which shot and bludgeoned its way through the square Saturday night
and early Sunday, or were replacement troops.
   Rumors continued to circulate that the 38th army, assigned to
protect Beijing, either was replacing the 27th or already had done
so.
   Speculation continued that units of other armies might attack
those supporting Li Peng.
   Foreigners were leaving Beijing in large numbers, including
families of diplomats.
   ``It's just not a wise thing to keep people here at this point,''
U.S. Ambassador James Lilley told reporters at Beijing's
international airport, seeing off an evacuation flight.
   ``We've taken an awful lot of moves to improve our security, and
the biggest one was putting those people on that plane and pulling
them out of town.''
   Protests and transportation tieups continued elsewhere in China,
and provincial leaders rallied behind the central government's tough
stand.
   Government leaders in Shanghai, China's largest city, broadcast
that ``vast numbers of workers are unable to report to work, and
industrial production as well as the citizens' lives are being
disrupted.'' Mayor Zhu Rongji said he could not guarantee residents'
safety.
   The official radio in the western city of Lanzhou reported the
situation as ``grim'' there and quoted Gansu provincial Gov. Jia
Zhijie as saying ``the dregs of society'' had forcibly occupied
``vital communications lines and important bridges'' and stopped
trains. Students went to factories to force workers to strike and
``forcibly order factory directors to halt production.'' ``It is
necessary to form a deterrent force against them and develop a
situation whereby, when a rat runs across the street, everybody
cries `Kill it!''' Jia declared.
   A source said soldiers were briefly called into Chengdu, capital
of Sichuan province, after days of violence. Unconfirmed reports
said police shot and killed 20 people as crowds stormed a government
building Sunday in Chengdu.
   In Beijing, soldiers still fired into the air and at some
bystanders Thursday, but far less often than before.
   Most residents still stayed away from their jobs, but life was
near normal. Thousands took bicycle tours of the city, stopping to
gape at bullet holes in buildings and bloodstains on walls.
   Stores, restaurants and some post offices reopened, and people
formed long lines to buy the Beijing Daily and Beijing Evening News,
available for the first time in five days. Both were filled with
articles denying heavy casualties among civilians and reporting the
reopening of businesses.
   ``There's no news,'' one reader said in disgust.
   A student at Beijing Normal said: ``The calm is just superficial.
With so many killed there cannot be real calm. It's just a matter of
time before the movement peaks again.''

   The British Broadcasting Corp.'s Asia correspondent
and his two-man camera crew were assaulted and interrogated by
Chinese police, the BBC said Thursday.
   Correspondent Brian Barron and the crew were filming civilians
next to a burned-out tank Wednesday night when six gun-wielding
secret policemen and several uniformed policemen set on them, the
BBC said.
   ``We ran into trouble while ignoring the martial law decree
banning all foreign television coverage of the unrest,'' Barron said
on BBC TV.
   ``All media coverage here is theoretically illegal. As we filmed
civilians beside a burned-out tank, we were assaulted by half a
dozen police brandishing loaded pistols.''
   Barron said half the crew's equipment was ``deliberately
smashed.''
   ``Then at gunpoint we were forced to kneel in the road for two
tense minutes. A pistol was put to the temple of our sound recordist
Steve Moss. After that, we were frog-marched with our hands up past
a silent crowd of civilians.''
   Barron said he was ``kicked and cussed'' on the march to a
factory complex where they were detained for another 30 minutes
before being ordered at gunpoint to leave.
   Their remaining equipment and videotape was confiscated, he said.

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Abundant moisture on the Gulf Coast combined with unseasonably
strong winds to cause an outbreak of tornadoes and severe
thunderstorms Thursday from southeast Louisiana to the Florida
Panhandle.
   Tornadoes, rain and high wind from thunderstorms caused damage in
parts of Alabama, Florida, Louisiana and Mississippi.
   A tornado at Grosse Tete, La., west of Baton Rouge, killed at
least two people, destroyed at least 25 residences and injured at
least 15 people. Other damage was at Baton Rouge, Plaquemine,
Montpelier, and between Amite and Wilmer, La.
   Tornadoes and high wind also caused damage at Eglin Air Force
Base and Pensacola in Florida; coastal Lillian, Ala., and
Ellisville, in east-central Mississippi.
   Thunderstorm winds gusted to 67 mph at Biloxi, Miss., and to 60
mph at Mobile, Ala.
   Flash flood watches were posted for the southern half of
Mississippi, extreme southern Alabama and the Florida Panhandle.
Heavy rain washed out part of a major highway in Forrest County,
Miss. At least 6 inches of rain fell Thursday at Milton, Fla.
   Showers and thunderstorms developed in the southern Atlantic
Coast region from central Virginia across the Carolinas and Georgia
to central Florida.
   Hail fell at Belhaven, N.C. A thunderstorm brought a half-inch of
rain in 20 minutes at Jacksonville, Fla.
   Rain also fell in eastern New England and across parts of
Kentucky, Tennessee and Arkansas. Showers and thunderstorms were
scattered from Michigan to Missouri and over the central Rockies and
portions of Utah.
   Unseasonably cool weather prevailed in the northern Plains, with
afternoon temperatures in the 50s and 60s, and some readings in the
40s in northern Minnesota and Upper Michigan.
   In contrast, temperatures were over 100 degrees in extreme
southern Texas, with Brownsville reaching 102 degrees, a record for
the date. The desert Southwest had relatively moderate temperatures
in the 80s to lower 90s.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 42
degrees at Hancock, Mich., to 98 degrees at Brownsville, Cotulla,
Laredo, McAllen and Beeville, Texas. The nation's low Thursday
morning was 33 degrees at Dickinson, N.D., and Williston, N.D.
   The Friday forecast was showers and thunderstorms across the East
Coast, Appalachians, Great Lakes, central Gulf Coast, western
portions of the central and southern Plains, and most of the Rockies
and the area westward toward the mountains of Nevada, Oregon and
Washington.
   High temperatures were forecast in the 70s and 80s for most of
the nation, but only 60s in eastern New England, near the upper
Great Lakes and along the Pacific Coast. High temperatures were
predicted in the 90s in Florida and from southern Texas across
southern Arizona to the interior valleys of California. Temperatures
should climb over 100 degrees along the Rio Grande in Texas and in
the desert Southwest.

   Archbishop Desmond Tutu won a seat
Thursday on a Harvard University governing board, striking a blow
for forces opposed to the school's $163.8 million investment in
companies doing business in South Africa.
   ``I ... pray God I will do justice to the honor that has been
given me,'' Tutu said, speaking from South Africa.
   The 1984 Nobel Prize-winner, who promised a year ago to return
honorary degrees to any schools that had not divested such holdings
by May 1989, said he would not return the diploma Harvard conferred
on him 10 years ago.
   Instead, the South African Anglican prelate will use his new spot
on the Board of Overseers to lobby against apartheid and for
divestment, said Tutu spokesman John Allen.
   ``This is really big news,'' said Robert Wolff, director of
Harvard-Radcliffe Alumni Against Apartheid. ``I feel very confident
that once (Tutu) arrives there will be enormous pressure on Harvard
to divest.''
   Tutu's victory was the only one claimed by the pro-divestment
coalition, which ran four other candidates against an official slate
of 10 people backed by the Harvard Alumni Association.
   Actor John Lithgow and U.S. Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole, both
endorsed by the alumni assocation, were the top vote-getters in the
write-in election open to all Harvard degree holders.
   Tutu came in fourth with 14,226 of the votes cast by 39,897
people, who elected five officials to serve six-year terms on the
30-member board. The panel monitors the university's academic
policies and advises the Harvard Corporation, which manages the
school's business affairs.
   Since 1986, the Harvard-Radcliffe anti-apartheid group has
nominated candidates to the 30-member overseers panel by petition
and has succeeded in placing three members on the board.
   The campaign was more heated than any in recent years, with the
alumni association and university officials speaking out against
electing ``single issue'' candidates.
   But Wolff, a professor of philosophy at the University of
Massachusetts at Amherst, said he was optimistic Tutu's presence on
the panel would encourage other ``progressive'' board members to
join the push for divestment in South Africa.
   ``There are a large number of progressive board members who would
feel comfortable rallying to Tutu's standard,'' Wolff said. ``In his
presence he will be the moral center of the board on this issue.''
   Wolff said it was not immediately clear when Tutu would come to
Cambridge to meet with the board, but predicted that ``when he
comes, thousands of people will turn out support him.''

<HEAD>Senator's Experiment Could Lead To Recycling U.S. Capitol Garbage</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An aide's suggestion to Minnesota Sen. Rudy
Boschwitz has prompted a proposal for a pilot program that could
lead Congress to recycle the 20,000 tons of garbage and trash
generated by Capitol buildings every year.
   Boschwitz asked the Senate Rules Committee to consider a
recycling program for the entire Capitol complex, which includes the
Supreme Court, Library of Congress and six congressional office
buildings.
   As a result of the request from Boschwitz and House members, the
office of the architect of the Capitol recently proposed to begin
recycling garbage from two congressional office buildings as a pilot
project.
   ``If we don't set the example certainly it won't be set
elsewhere,'' Boschwitz said Thursday during a news conference by the
newly formed Greenhouse Crisis Foundation.
   The foundation is dedicated to halt a global warming trend known
as the ``greenhouse effect.'' One of the group's goals is to slow
the cutting of forests.
   The Republican senator, who made a fortune in the plywood
business, became interested in recycling congressional garbage at
the suggestion of Linda Garczynski, a temporary staff member on loan
to his office from the Environmental Protection Agency, that it
might save money, said Boschwitz' press secretary, Tim Droogsma.
   The Capitol Architect's office has suggested the government begin
recycling garbage from the Russell Senate Office Building and the
Rayburn House Office Building, which together house about 5,000
workers, said Raymond Carroll, director of engineering.
   ``It will be interesting to see if people will cooperate, he said.
   Recycling programs require people to segregate items that can be
recycled, such as aluminum cans and paper, from items that cannot,
such as certain plastics or food waste.
   The pilot project would cost about $50,000, mostly to purchase
extra containers.
   The project will need the approval of the House and Senate
committees that requested the study.

<TEXT>
   The advertiser-supported Channel One news service
for teens will be offered to schools nationwide starting in March
1990, packaged with two new educational networks, the creator of the
service said Thursday.
   Christopher Whittle, chairman of Whittle Communications, said his
company expects to spend $200 million on startup costs involved in
giving 8,000 or more schools the video equipment needed to receive
Channel One programming.
   He plans to pay for it with $85 million to $100 million each year
from advertisers who pay to pitch products on Channel One's daily
news show.
   Critics ncluding national educational groups argue that
advertisers should not be allowed to pitch their wares to youngsters
in the classroom.
   ``We have listened to our critics,'' Whittle told a news
conference in announcing the national launch of Channel One. But he
said their main complaint about advertising was ``unaddressable.''
   He said if schools are going to get both a daily news show and
the equipment to show it ``you have to pay for it'' and that
advertising is the most feasible way because the federal governmment
and corporate philanthropy have not provided the money.
   Nonetheless, Whittle said, he has modified the Channel One
service that was tested for five weeks this past spring at six
schools across the country and featured ads for jeans, shampoo,
chewing gum, candy bars and acne medicine.
   Whittle said schools signing up for Channel One can have some
rather than all of their classrooms wired to receive the program and
need not show it to the whole school.
   However, he said schools that participate still will be obliged
to show the program every day in those classrooms that have the
Channel One equipment.
   In addition to Channel One, Whittle will donate five hours of
satellite time every school day for a channel called the Classroom
Channel that would carry non-commercial educational programming.
   The Classroom Channel would be run by a board independent of
Whittle Communcations.
   Whittle said it was likely the board would decide against
allowing advertising on that service. Schools could pick and choose
what they want to use from that channel, he said.
   He said Whittle Communications would donate $500,000 a year for
the board to acquire rights to programming for the Classroom
Channel. The programs would include public broadcasting
documentaries and instructional shows such as an advanced algebra
class or language lesson.
   Whittle said he also was developing a third network, the
Educators Channel, to carry programming for educators, such as
briefings by national education groups.
   Schools participating in Channel One would be given equipment to
receive all three channels in exchange for running the Channel One
program every day.
   Peggy Charren, who heads a national children's advocacy group,
said she was unswayed by Whittle's modifications.
   ``It's the same deal with better packaging,'' she said.
   Gary Marx of the American Association of School Administratrors
said, ``It still turns the classroom into a marketplace for products
rather than a marketplace for ideas.''
   Whittle hopes to make Channel One available in 1,000 middle and
high schools in March 1990 and add schools at a rate of 500 or more
a month, giving each school video equipment worth $40,000 to $50,000.
   Competition has sprung up since Whittle tested Channel One.
   Turner Broadcasting System's Cable News Network plans to begin a
daily ad-free news program for schools starting in August, while the
Discovery Channel cable network says it intends to make
commercial-free documentary programming.
   C-Span, the Cable-Satellite Public Affairs Network that provides
coverage of congressional proceedings, has been providing
programming for use in the classroom since 1986 and said 3,400
teachers already use it. C-Span is expanding that service starting
in late August.
   But no cable network is donating equipment to the schools on the
scale Whittle has envisioned.
   Whittle released survey results Wednesday indicating students who
watched Channel One were better informed about daily events than
their counterparts who did not watch it. The surveys also claim a
majority of teachers, students and administrators find the
commercials an acceptable price to pay for the program.

<HEAD>Appeals Court Hears Argument on America's Cup Race</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An appeals court reserved its decision Thursday
on whether the San Diego Yacht Club broke competition rules or
simply one-upped a New Zealand group when it successfully defended
the America's Cup with a catamaran.
   San Diego's lawyer, Harold Tyler, told a five-judge panel of the
state Supreme Court's Appellate Division that the U.S. yacht club
did nothing barred by the Deed of Gift, the 1887 document governing
the races and the silver cup.
   He said state Supreme Court Justice Carmen Ciparick was wrong
when she ruled on March 28 that San Diego had to forfeit the sailing
trophy to the Mercury Bay Boating Club. He said the cup should be
returned to San Diego.
   Attorney George Thompkins argued for Mercury Bay that last
September's race was a mismatch between the conventional New Zealand
entry and the much faster double-hull catamaran and violated the
spirit of friendly competition envisioned by the race's founders 138
years ago.
   Assistant Attorney General David Samuels, speaking for the state
as a trustee of the cup, argued that ``the use of the catamaran is
proper as the rules are written. The rules need to be changed.''
   He said San Diego had told Ciparick before the race the type of
boat it planned to use and she did not object. Samuels said San
Diego should be allowed to keep the cup and some less drastic remedy
than forfeiture should be applied.
   On July 15, 1987, Mercury Bay challenged San Diego, holder of the
cup at the time, to race in a boat that was about 90 feet at the
water line, less than a year after the California club's 1986 win
over the Royal Perth Yacht Club of Australia. Boats that big had not
been raced in more than 50 years.
   San Diego rejected the challenge, noting that foreign clubs were
already preparing for a 1990 or 1991 race in so-called 12-meter
boats _ the number depends more on a complicated design formula than
an actual dimension _ and would be unable to compete effectively on
terms demanded by Mercury Bay.
   The San Diego club pointed out that every match since World War
II had been raced every three or four years in 12-meter boats, which
actually are about 45 feet at the water line.
   The San Diego catamaran easily defeated Mercury Bay's entry and
the case has been in and out of court ever since.
   The New York Yacht Club and the Royal Perth Yacht Club of
Australia asked the judges to affirm Ciparick's ruling that San
Diego relinquish the cup to Mercury Bay.

   Army Col. Juan Lopez de la Cruz was
cleared by a jury of conspiracy and bribery charges Thursday in a
case in which in which he was accused of helping an Illinois arms
contractor secure $3.7 million in weapons sales to El Salvador.
   Jurors said they simply didn't believe the contractor, who was
the government's chief witness in its attempt to prove two counts of
conspiracy and one of bribery.
   Lopez was accused of accepting $70,000 and a Rolex watch from
Dennis Reese, president of Springfield Armory in Genesco, Ill.
   According to the government's case rejected by the jury through
its verdicts of innocent, Lopez told Reese Springfield Armory could
receive tax-free money by telling the Defense Security Assistance
Agency that commissions had been paid to an agent.
   A Salvadoran resident would then act as the fake agent, cash the
commission checks and return the cash, minus a fee, to Reese.
   Reese was the prosecution's star witness in U.S. District Court
in the Washington suburb of Alexandria.
   ``The testimony of the witness was not credible enough ... just
no proof,'' said juror Bonnie Basara, 22, of Chantilly, Va.
   Another juror, who declined to give her name, said, ``The
prosecution's case was weak.''
   Defense lawyers throughout the case attempted to discredit Reese,
who testified under a grant of immunity from prosecution.
   ``Dennis Reese has committed more crimes than he has fingers on
his hands and toes on his feet,'' declared defense attorney Barry
Levin.
   Upon hearing the verdict, Lopez, 49, said he felt as if 500
pounds had been lifted from his shoulders.
   ``I feel wonderful. I was hoping my name would be cleared,'' he
said.
   Lopez, a Cuban native who joined the Army after participating in
the Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961, is commander of the Military Ocean
Terminal Bay Area in Oakland, Calif.

<HEAD>Jack Dash, Cockney Communist Dockers' Leader, Dies at 82</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jack Dash, the Cockney Communist famous for his
role in the strikes that plagued London's docks, died Thursday,
London Hospital said. He was 82.
   It declined to give the cause of death.
   Dash prided himself on being involved in every London dock strike
between 1945 and 1970. A colorful figure and gifted orator, he was
much in demand on the lecture circuit after his retirement.
   Born in south London, Dash was raised as an orphan and left
school at 14, becoming a builder, a firefighter and then a docker.
   Inspired by the novels of American author Jack London, he joined
the British Communist Party in 1936 and devoted the rest of his
working life to protecting the pay and jobs of the dockers.
   The Transport and General Workers' Union to which he belonged
barred Communists from holding union office, so Dash operated
strictly from the soapbox and became known as ``unofficial king of
the docks.''
   Although he unswervingly defended the Soviet line, he was a
fervent British patriot, always reminding listeners that this
country invented the parliamentary and trade union tradition.
   Dash retired in 1969 and immediately organized a rent strike at
his public housing project. He also painted, sculpted, wrote an
autobiography and became a tourist guide, showing visitors around
the city he loved. ``I'm a bloody London chauvinist,'' he would
often say.
   His wife Ellen predeceased him.
   In 1970 Dash told an interviewer what he wanted inscribed on his
tombstone:
   ``Here lies Jack Dash,
   ``All he wanted was to separate them from their cash.''
   ``Them,'' he hastily added, meant employers.

call, saying he hoped both Republicans and Democrats would avoid
attacking each other.
   ``I'd like to shift the gears and move into ethics legislation,''
Bush said when asked about a Republican National Committee memo
attacking new House Speaker Thomas Foley, the latest salvo in a
Congress marked by charges of ethical violations.
   ``We've got to do better,'' Bush said. ``The ugliness of the
climate is bad.'' But he brushed aside demands from some Democrats
that Republican National Chairman Lee Atwater resign because of the
memo.
   Earlier in the day, Mitchell said that skepticism about public
officials is healthy but that ``a danger occurs when skepticism
becomes cynicism and mistrust.''
   Mitchell renewed his call for a ban on speaking fees, coupled
with a pay raise. But he said members of Congress are reluctant to
risk the wrath of their constituents by voting themselves raises to
make up for losing the fees.
   One possibility, he said, would be to gradually lower limits on
speech fees, known as honoraria, while gradually increasing
congressional salaries.
   Mitchell, D-Maine, spoke to a group of reporters in his Capitol
office at a time when congressional ethics issues have been brought
to the fore by allegations that brought resignation announcements
from House Speaker Jim Wright and Democratic Whip Tony Coelho.
   Some of the allegations against Wright concerned rules on
honoraria, while Coelho has been criticized for a private investment
deal.
   Mitchell said separate Democratic and Republican task forces in
the Senate are studying proposals for ethics reform. But he said,
``It's difficult to act in a situation in which there is no clear
consensus.''
   ``We hope in the near future to be able to go forward with some
effort'' in the areas of banning speech fees, known as honoraria,
and raising pay, he said. But he also said, ``If prevailing public
sentiment were the sole determining factor, the pay of members of
Congress today would be exactly what it was 200 years ago.''
   ``One of the things we must do ... is find the proper balance
between being responsive to the wishes of the electorate and
applying one's best conscience and judgment as to what is best for
the nation or the state as a whole.''
   ``We are caught in a vise between tremendous attention devoted to
honoraria, in the press ... and a public wholly disinterested in
honoraria. It puts members of Congress squarely in a vise, squarely
in a difficult position. We are caught in a vise.''
   Mitchell's comments amplified remarks made a day earlier by
Foley, D-Wash., who told reporters he hoped the House would act
before year's end on a new ethics package. Foley also said proposals
would likely have to address the honoraria issue.
   Mitchell voiced interest in a bill, introduced by Sen.
Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., which would phase out speaking fees while
gradually phasing in increases in lawmakers salaries.
   ``Several senators, both Democrat and Republican, have expressed
to me that that's the only reasonable approach ... which some feel
is the way out of a difficult situation,'' he said.
   Members of the House and Senate currently are paid $89,500 a
year, although the top leaders make more than that. Both the House
and Senate, by overwhelming margins, defeated a proposed 50 percent
pay raise early this year after a public outcry greeted the proposal.
   Mitchell said he would not set any ``arbitrary deadline'' for
recommending ethics changes, saying it was more important to find
agreement on rules that provide ``more precise and definite
standards'' for lawmakers. He said a review also is needed of rules
concerning acceptance of gifts.
   He said he thought the increased press scrutiny of congressional
ethics was legitimate but also said he doesn't think there has been
a general deterioration in standards of behavior.
   ``There has never been a time in history when there has been a
total absence of public skepticism about public officials,'' he
said, adding that that is ``a healthy thing'' in a democracy.
   ``There is nothing new here. There is a recurring theme in
American history. Of course it is episodic,'' Mitchell said. `We're
in one of those periods when interest is high. ... A danger occurs
when the healthy skepticism becomes cynicism and mistrust.''
   Mitchell said Congress ``must address'' the questions of ethics
reform and changes in campaign finance laws, aimed at lessening the
influence of special interests.
   Meanwhile, Rep. David Nagle, D-Iowa, began circulating among
House members a letter demanding that President Bush ask for the
resignation of Republican National Committee Chairman Lee Atwater
because of a party document which attacked Speaker Thomas S. Foley.
   The RNC memo compared Foley's record with that of Rep. Barney
Frank, D-Mass., an acknowledged homosexual. Bush was said to be
``disgusted'' with the incident, but he also expressed confidence in
Atwater, who was his 1988 campaign chairman.
   Mark Goodin, a Republican official who had been a press aide in
the Bush campaign, claimed sole responsibility for the letter and
resigned.
   ``These things don't happen in a political party unless the chief
signs off on it,'' said Nagle, who was chairman of the Iowa
Democratic Party. If Bush fails to get rid of Atwater, it will hurt
the president's credibility when he asks for bipartisan cooperation,
he said.
   But the president, recalling a conversation with Atwater about
the memo, said: ``He looked me right in the eye and said he did not
know about it and and I respect that.''
   Bush said Foley had been done ``a terrible ill service by this''
and likened the attack to those made against former Sen. John Tower,
whose nomination by Bush to be defense secretary was doomed by
accusations about Tower's drinking and womanizing.
   ``I have great respect for Tom Foley and he's the one who says
the matter should be closed and he's right,'' Bush said in calling
for an end to the partisan warfare. ``Let met just repeat: It was
disgusting. It's against everything that I've stood for in political
life.''

   President Bush told a televised news conference
that first lady Barbara Bush, who turned 64 Thursday, was ``doing
just fine'' in keeping a thyroid problem under control.
   Bush added the personal note when a reporter said he wanted to
relay a happy birthday wish to Mrs. Bush.
   The president joked that the first lady did not particularly want
the birthday celebrated. Then he added that she appreciated the
messages of concern that had flooded into the White House over her
condition.
   Mrs. Bush was diagnosed earlier this year as having Graves
Disease, a thyroid disorder that had caused her to lose weight and
irritated her eyes.
   She underwent radioactive iodine treatment to treat the
overactive thyroid.
   ``She's doing just fine,'' Bush said. ``She's got this Graves
Disease under control.''

<TEXT>
   Thousands of Hong Kong residents bowed before a memorial of
bouquets and banners Thursday to mourn fellow ethnic Chinese killed
in Beijing, and a Thai official said the turmoil in China may delay
settlement of the Cambodian conflict.
   The East German government issued a statement supporting the
Chinese government's use of force to crush the protest movement.
Vietnam and Nepal expressed concern about the loss of life but said
the crackdown is an internal affair.
   In Hong Kong, nineteen long-robed Taoist mystics prayed and
thousands of people spent part of the Dragon Boat holiday Thursday,
bowing three times before the makeshift memorial set up outside the
Chinese government-run Xinhua News Agency. Many wiped away tears.
   Led by a band playing flutes, drums and cymbals, the mystics
beseeched the spirits of those killed by troops in China to rise
again from the netherworld. Eighteen men in saffron robes were led
by a white-robed priest.
   Xinhua functions as China's de facto embassy in Hong Kong, a
capitalist British colony filled with increasing fear over its
reversion to Chinese rule in 1997.
   Thai Foreign Ministry spokesman Jete Sucharitkhul said the Thai
government was ``very concerned'' about developments in Beijing,
where pro-democracy protests since mid-April escalated until troops
killed hundreds of people last weekend.
   China is a principal player in Cambodia as the main backer of the
Khmer Rouge, the strongest of the three-party guerrilla coalition
opposing the pro-Vietnamese government in Phnom Penh.
   ``Usually the (Chinese) government follows the party line, if
there is a power struggle you can imagine that they will be very
busy internally and not be able to pay as much attention to the
(Cambodian) issue as they have in the past,'' Jete said.
   But he said he did not think apparent divisions in the Chinese
leadership would change China's policy on Cambodia.
   Philippine President Corazon Aquino said Thursday that
Philippine-Chinese relations remain unaffected and her country's
embassy in Beijing will stay open despite plans to evacuate Filipino
civilians.
   But a Filipino senator said protesters in Beijing patterned their
protest on the ``People Power'' movement that swept Mrs. Aquino to
power in 1986 and that the Manila government should join others in
condemning the killings.
   Students in Malaysia and Indonesia staged demonstrations Thursday
against the Chinese government's crackdown, and Singapore's Chinese
Chamber of Commerce expressed shock at the bloodshed.
   In Central America, Guatemala and Costa Rica condemned the
killings.

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said
Thursday that the evacuation of U.S. citizens from China has gone
well and President Bush praised the work of the U.S. ambassador for
helping Americans there.
   ``Some have suggested that to show our forcefulness that I bring
the American ambassador (James Lilley) back. I disagree with that
180 degrees,'' Bush said at his first prime-time news conference of
his presidency.
   The president insisted that his decision to leave the Lilley in
Beijing was more productive than recalling him to Washington just to
show U.S. displeasure.
   Calling Lilley ``our very able ambassador,'' Bush pointed out
that he had played a key role in helping win the release of CBS
reporter Richard Roth, who had been caught up in the Tiananmen
Square disturbances and held by Chinese authorities overnight.
   ``We have seen in the last few days a very good reason to have
him there,'' Bush said.
   Bush defended as appropriate the sanctions he announced on
Monday, suspension of military aid, in response to the Chinese
military's masscre of thousands of pro-democracy demonstrators in
Beijing.
   But the president said the United States cannot return to
``totally normal relations'' with China unless that government
recognizes the validity of the pro-democracy movement.
   Bush said economic sanctions would be ``counterproductive and
would hurt the people.''
   The president added, however, that if the situation does not
improve he would take further steps ``at an appropriate time.''
   Earlier, Baker said the U.S.-Chinese relationship has suffered
``a tragic step backward,'' but stressed that economic ties should
be maintained to foster democratic reforms in China.
   Baker, speaking at the National Press Club, reported that all
Americans who had gotten to Beijing's airport had been flown out of
the country.
   ``We're keeping our fingers crossed,'' Baker said of the
evacuation of U.S. dependents of diplomatic personnel, which he
ordered a day earlier after diplomatic compounds in the capital were
strafed by gunfire.
   The secretary had also appealed to private U.S. citizens to leave
the country as soon as possible.
   Baker said that a power struggle appeared to be underway in the
wake of the Sunday massacre of pro-democracy demonstrators and that
the situation was still ``too clouded'' to tell exactly who is in
charge.
   He called the bloody massacre of the Chinese protesters ``tragic
and deplorable.''
   Baker also defended the decision to offer refuge to the Chinese
dissident Fang Lizhi, who is in the U.S. Embassy in Beijing with his
wife and son.
   China has accused the United States of interfering in its
domestic affairs by harboring the astrophysicist, who had been
prevented from attending a dinner with President Bush during the
president's visit to Beijing in February.
   The secretary said he would not discuss whether Fang has sought
asylum, but noted that the dissident ``asked for refuge and we
granted that refuge.''
   Baker made a point of saying that the United States has worked
hard to improve ties with China since relations were formalized in
1979.
   ``We've spent many years in improving relations between the U.S.
and China, in encouraging the movement towards democracy,'' Baker
said, adding, ``We've had a very tragic step backward.''
   It is vital, he said, that the United States ``recognize the
importance of this relationship.''
   Asked whether Bush intended to take additional steps against the
Chinese beyond cutting military sales and freezing military
exchanges, Baker said the president ``reserved the right to review
all options.''
   Baker noted that Bush ``has determined that it's important that
we maintain the economic relationships that exist now,'' adding that
recent turmoil appeared to be due to the fact that economic reforms
in China were more advanced than political changes.
   ``Those economic reforms are what led to the opening up that we
saw before this recent tragic and unfortunate and deplorable
crackdown,'' Baker said, adding, ``We think it's important that we
maintain, ... depending upon the future course of events there, ...
these economic ties because those are the things that for the most
part have led to a move toward openness.''
   Baker defended U.S. Ambassador James Lilley and the U.S. Embassy
in Beijing against criticism that not enough was being done to aid
Americans leaving the country.
   Lilley and his team have been ``extraordinarly responsive'' to
the needs of Americans in China, Baker said, adding that not one
U.S. citizen had been killed in the violence and that only one had
been injured.
   Baker pointed out that the U.S. government has chartered
commercial aircraft to fly to Beijing and Shanghai to supplement
regular U.S. airline departures. Also, officials have organized
convoys to help U.S. citizens get to the airports.
   He cited United, Continental and Northwest airlines for being
``quick to respond'' to the State Department's request for help.
   On Wednesday Baker ordered the 258 dependents of U.S. government
personnel in China to leave, and urged other Americans throughout
the country to leave as well.
   That step came after troops sprayed Beijing diplomatic compounds
with gunfire. Also, reports from China have indicated that
disturbances had spread to more than a dozen provincial cities.
   Some 8,800 Americans had notified U.S. officials in January that
they were in China.
   Later Thursday, State Department spokesman Adam Shub said the
U.S. Embassy in Beijing had reported it knew of 115 Americans with
official ties still in the city.
   That includes 11 non-diplomats, one of them the ambassador's
wife, plus other dependents, people who work in the embassy and two
children whose parents are both members of the diplomatic staff,
Shub said.
   The State Department estimated that there are some 5,000 private
U.S. citizens left in China and 400 to 500 in Beijing, including a
number of American students who have refused to leave their
univerity campuses in the capital city.

<HEAD>Hash, Pot Smuggler Gets Life Without Parole</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A tugboat skipper convicted of trying to
smuggle 56 tons of hashish and marijuana through the Golden Gate was
sentenced Thursday to life in prison without parole.
   U.S. District Judge John Vukasin said Calvin Robinson is a
``criminal profiteer'' without any redeeming qualities who deserved
to be put behind bars for life in the toughest penitentiary the U.S.
Bureau of Prisons could find.
   Prior to the sentencing, a belligerent Robinson told the judge,
``When you put that chain around my ankle you'll be putting it
around your own neck.''
   Robinson, 47, who acted as his own lawyer during the trial,
received the maximum sentence, including a $4 million fine.
   In February, a jury found Robinson guilty of six charges
connected to his 1988 attempt to float hashish and marijuana valued
at $175 million into San Francisco Bay behind the welded panels of a
barge.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Laurie Gray described the drug haul as
the largest of its kind in U.S. history _ ``enough dosage units for
a (drug) hit for every man, woman and child in the United States.''
   The prosecutor said Robinson deserved the maximum because of the
enormity of the drug haul, that he had brought eight members of his
family into his ``criminal enterprise, that he has a criminal record
going back to his teens, and that he tried twice to escape custody.''
   ``There are no drugs,'' shouted Robinson in reply. ``That's a
bunch of malarkey. I haven't been engaged in any criminal conduct.
... I didn't drag my family into this. ... I'm being persecuted.''
   Robinson told the judge he meant his earlier ``chain'' remark
figuratively in that he regarded the sentence as a miscarriage of
justice and both he and the judge were therefore victims. The judge
said he regarded it as a threat.

   President Bush said Thursday his concerns about
human rights in China extend to all countries, including South
Africa.
   Bush was asked at a news conference whether his concerns about
the Chinese suppression of the pro-democracy student movement
extended to other areas, including South Africa and the
Israeli-occupied West Bank.
   ``It certainly does,'' he said. ``The concern is universal. ...
We have to speak out in favor of human rights. We are not going to
remake the world, but we should stand for something.''
   As for South Africa, he said, ``Absolutely. Appalling apartheid
must end.''
   He made no specific reference to the West Bank.

<HEAD>Study Says CDC Significantly Underestimates AIDS Cases</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: INSERTS grafs 6-8: ``President Bush,'' with Bush comments from
news conference.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A University of Chicago study released Thursday
suggests that federal officials may be significantly underestimating
the number of Americans with AIDS and that there are more whites and
fewer blacks with the disease than previously believed.
   Edward O. Laumann of the National Opinion Research Center at the
University of Chicago said that estimates by the federal Centers for
Disease Control of the numbers of AIDS case are distorted because
affluent whites can afford to be treated discreetly by physicians
who do not report the disease.
   He said in a telephone interview that there also are cases that
are not reported due to bureaucratic problems that slow the count or
misfile cases.
   The CDC makes its estimate based on cases reported to official
agencies. An undercount or a failure to report cases could seriously
affect the CDC estimate, said Laumann.
   ``We are contending that there is an undercount, but we don't
know the scale of it,'' said Laumann, who co-authored a report
appearing Friday in the journal Science. ``We can estimate the
demographic composition, but not the gross numbers themselves. The
reason we're being cautious is that this is too small a sample.''
   President Bush, questioned about the need for mandatory reporting
of new AIDS cases, said he would not favor any type of reporting
that would jeopardize the patient's right to privacy.
   ``There's a lot of suffering, a lot of human tragedy out there,''
Bush said, adding that anything less than ``absolutely discreet
handling'' would not be helpful in fighting the AIDS epidemic.
   Bush, answering questions at a televised news conference Thursday
night, said that people should be encouraged to talk to their
doctors frankly about AIDS.
   To gather data for the AIDS study, Laumann and his associates
conducted interviews of 1,481 households around the country. The
households were selected to reflect a cross section of the
population.
   Each respondent was asked if he knew an acquaintance who had
AIDS. To validate the accuracy of the answers, the respondents also
were asked if they had an acquaintance who had been murdered.
Earlier studies had proven that response to the homicide survey
accurately reflected the actual number of murders. This suggested
that answers to the AIDS question would be equally accurate.
   The results, said the study, ``suggest that the white proportion
(of AIDS cases) is substantially higher than CDC reports and that a
substantially greater share of the cases is in the midwestern
region.''
   According to CDC figures from March 7, whites compose about 60
percent of the nation's AIDS cases. The University of Chicago study
said the correct number is 72 percent.
   The CDC said that 26 percent of all cases are black and 14
percent are Hispanic. The Chicago results estimate these totals as
18 percent for blacks, and 6 percent for Hispanics.
   Cases in the Midwest, according to the CDC, make up only 8
percent of the national total. The Chicago study said that Midwest
cases actually compose 20 percent of the national total.
   The comparative figures for other regions:
   _East. CDC, 39 percent of the national total; Chicago, 19 percent.
   _South. CDC, 26 percent; Chicago, 25 percent.
   _West. CDC, 27 percent; Chicago, 36 percent.
   Laumann said that ``logic alone'' suggested something wrong with
the CDC figures for the Midwest. Chicago, he said, ``has all of the
AIDS risk factors,'' such as a population of injection drug users,
and yet the city was said to have only 3.1 cases of AIDS per 10,000
residents, compared to a national total of 3.7 cases per 10,000.
   Also, he said, according to the CDC figures, ``Colorado at the
time of the 1988 survey had an absolute number of AIDS cases that
was equal to or even exceeded that of Michigan. And Colorado has 38
percent of the population of Michigan.'' Laumann said that Michigan
also has big cities where the AIDS risk factors are common.
   ``That just doesn't make sense,'' he said.
   Laumann submitted the Chicago study to officials at the CDC for
comment, and he said ``these results don't surprise them.''
   ``They know that sexually transmitted diseases are generally
undercounted for the white population because people go to personal
physicians and one of their things they are doing is buying some
discretion about it,'' he said.
   He said cases were undercounted in the Midwest because of a
flawed system of data collection by official agencies, noting
``there's been a scandal for sometime about the AIDS office in
Chicago and how inadequate it was.''
   Gayle Lloyd, a spokesperson for the Centers for Disease Control
in Atlanta, said there were no officials available to comment on the
new study.
   AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is fatal disease
caused by a virus that is spread most frequently by sexual
intercourse or by the sharing of needles among intravenous drug
users.
   Through the month of April, the CDC reports that AIDS had been
diagnosed in 94,280 Americans, of whom more than half, or 53,544,
have died since June 1, 1981. No one is known to have recovered from
AIDS.
   Science, which reported the Chicago study, is the journal of the
American Association for the Advancement of Science.

   President Bush on Thursday urged Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev demonstrate ``his desire for change''
by responding positively and quickly to U.S. proposals to cut
conventional forces in Europe.
   ``I think he has already demonstrated his commitment to change
and to reform,'' Bush told an evening news conference, declaring,
``I want to see perestroika succeed ... not fail.''
   Earlier in the day, Secretary of State James A. Baker III said
the administration hope Gorbachev will respond to the U.S. proposal
when he visits West Germany next week.
   Bush also extended a hand of friendship and congratulations to
the people Poland who, in the first democratic elections there since
World War II, gave a resounding vote of no confidence in the
Communist government.
   The president said that when he travels to Poland next month, he
will tell its leaders that, ``We want to work with you.''
   ``The quest for democracy in Poland ... if it goes forward, will
mean a much better relationship for Poland'' with the United States,
he said.
   Bush said the Soviet leader has already demonstrated that ``he is
interested in new thinking,'' one of the elements of Gorbachev's
perestroika, or restructuring.
   ``But there's ways now to solidify these changes,'' said the
president, urging Gorbachev to accept the U.S. offer to cut its
305,000 troops in Central Europe to 275,000 if the Soviets cut their
600,000 troops to that level as well.
   ``What is wrong with being equal?'' said Bush. ``So here's a test
now.''
   The president acknowledged that some disagreements remained
between the United States and West Germany over whether to modernize
Lance short-range nuclear missiles, but said a conventional forces
agreement could solve that problem.
   ``It is in our interests to quickly move forward, because if we
can get implemented within our time frame the agreement on
conventional forces, that will take a tremendous amount of pressure
off the Germans on short-range forces,'' said the president.
   Baker said that Soviet acceptance of the U.S. proposal to reduce
NATO and Warsaw Pact forces to the same level ``would substantially
reduce the threat of surprise military attack and the danger of
large-scale offensive operations against Western Europe.''
   ``The time is ripe for Mr. Gorbachev to respond positively to the
opportunities presented by NATO's initiatives,'' said Baker.
   The secretary of state said the U.S. proposals offer the Soviets
the opportunity both to channel resources from the military to the
civilian sector and to accelerate the process of political reform in
Eastern Europe.
   ``Our proposals point clearly to a long-term, dramatic
transformation in Europe's strategic and political landscape,'' he
said.
   Answering questions following his prepared remarks, Baker:
   _Said officials from the United States and the Palestine
Liberation Organization, meeting in Tunis Thursday, considered
``practical ways'' to achieve a comprehensive Middle East settlement
based on United Nations resolutions.
   _Called for a bipartisan agreement with the Congress on a new
policy aimed at hastening an end to South Africa's apartheid system.
He said a recent statement by South African Foreign Minister Pik
Botha that his party's platform for national elections will affirm
the need to abolish apartheid is a significant step.
   _Declared the administration is``very hopeful'' that Organization
of American States mediators will make progress towards bringing
about a democratic transfer of power in Panama.
   _Indicated he was not impressed by an Iranian proposal under
which Iran will help free American hostages in Lebanon if the United
States tries to win freedom for Iranians held by Christian forces in
Lebanon. Baker said the United States provided information on the
Iranian hostages to Iran in 1982. He urged Iran to help bring about
the immediate release of the American hostages.

   A Secret Service agent was convicted Thursday of
using excessive force in arresting a man near a presidential
candidate's New York City motorcade last year.
   The 12-member federal jury deliberated six hours before
convicting agent Kevin Schatzle, 28, of using unnecessary and
excessive force when he kicked and punched attorney Christopher
Gorayeb, 32, on April 10, 1988.
   Schatzle was acquitted of falsely arresting Gorayeb of New York
City near the motorcade of Sen. Albert Gore, D-Tenn.
   Neither Schatzle nor the 20 or so Secret Service agents who
crowded the tiny courtroom showed emotion as the verdict was read.
   Schatzle of Princeton, N.J., was in the security detail for Gore,
then campaigning for the Democratic presidential nomination in the
New York primary.
   The agent, who faces a maximum penalty of one year in prison and
a $100,000 fine, was released without bail by U.S. District Judge
Pierre Leval, who set sentencing for Sept. 13.
   During the seven-day trial, Schatzle testified that the lawyer
spit at him, but Gorayeb said he was attacked when he yelled an
obscenity at the passing motorcade because one of its cars almost
hit him as he legally crossed the street.
   ``I was kneed so hard in the groin that I was lifted off the
ground,'' Gorayeb testified, adding that after he fell to the
sidewalk, ``I was beaten, kicked and punched.''
   The agent maintained that he was only following standard
procedure for subduing a suspect. Seven witnesses testified that
they saw the agent beating Gorayeb, who said he suffered a broken
nose as well as eye, neck and shoulder injuries.
   Richard Ward, special agent-in-charge of the Secret Service's New
York field office, said Schatzle has not been suspended and his fate
with the agency will be decided at a later date.

   But Bush was firm in his support for the students who are
agitating for democracy. ``They're not trying to flee China. They're
trying to change China,'' he said.
   Bush was asked whether Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping was still in
charge.
   ``I'm trying to say that I don't know. And you don't know, and he
doesn't know. She doesn't know,'' Bush said, pointing around the
room of reporters. ``Nobody knows, outside (China). That's the way
the Chinese system works ...
   ``I simply cannot tell you with authority who is calling the
shots.''
   The president was reluctant to directly blame any Chinese
official for the military crackdown and massacre of students,
saying, ``I don't want to pass judgement on individual leaders.''
   Pressed on whether the United States could have normal relations
with anyone responsible for the killings, Bush replied, ``It would
make it extraordinarily difficult.'' However, he said the question
was ``so hypothetical that I'm going to avoid answering it
directly.''
   Bush said he was disappointed in the course of events since he
visited China in February. ``Armed people don't shoot down unarmed
students,'' he said.
   Bush said he was satisfied with the military sanctions he
announced on Monday morning, but suggested that if the situation
does not improve he would take further steps ``at an appropriate
time.''
   Bush had a one-word description for the Republican National
Committee circular comparing Foley's voting record with that of Rep.
Barney Frank, a homosexual House member from Massachusetts _
``disgusting.''
   But he deflected a questioner who asked whether party chairman
Lee Atwater should be called to account.
   ``He looked me right in the eye,'' Bush said of his handpicked
GOP boss, ``and said he did not know about it.'' Bush noted that
Atwater ``moved promptly to remove the person who said he did know
about it and I respect that.'' RNC communications director Mark
Goodin announced his resignation on Wednesday after saying he had
written the material.
   Of Foley, the president said, ``He's the one who says the matter
should be closed, and he's right.''
   Bush seemed eager to drop the subject, and said it was time for
Congress to adopt tough ethics legislation.
   The White House said Bush, since taking office Jan. 20, has had
from 16 to 23 news conferences, depending on how you define a news
conference. The sessions have ranged in length from just a few
minutes to more than 45 minutes.
   All his previous news conferences were held during the day, and
none was conducted in the formal setting of the East Room.
   By holding a news conference in television's prime-time hours,
Bush assured himself of a large viewing audience; the major
commercial television networks were broadcasting the session.
   The president personally decided the arrangement of the East Room
for the news conference, changing the setting that Ronald Reagan
used.
   Reagan used to make a dramatic entrance, striding down the
red-carpeted, marble-columned Cross Hall to reach the East Room,
where reporters sat facing him across the length of the room.
   Bush opted for a less regal entrance, from an adjacent state
room, with reporters seated on his left as he came into the East
Room.
   Vice President Dan Quayle, who had lunch with the president, said
Bush was ready ``to knock it right out of the ballpark.''
   White House officials said Bush, unlike Reagan, did not make
extensive preparations for the news conference _ actually his second
one this week after Monday's announcement of a freeze in $600
million in military sales to China.
   Reagan used to study sample questions and hold dress rehearsals
at which his staff asked him questions.
   White House deputy press secretary B. Jay Cooper said Bush was
doing ``nothing special'' other than talking with chief of staff
John Sununu, press secretary Marlin Fitzwater and deputy national
security adviser Robert Gates.
   Cooper said national security adviser Brent Scowcroft was in Los
Angeles, giving Reagan a periodic briefing on national security
matters.
   Quayle, during a picture-taking session with visiting Soviet
editor Sergey Grigoryants, said Bush's actions against China _
including a suspension of all arms sales but not the imposition of
broad commercial sanctions _ ``has good support in the Congress''
and that the American people ``feel the president is acting in a
prudent and a wise manner.''
   In another development, a spokesman for former President Nixon
said Bush called Nixon on Monday and talked with him about 10
minutes before announcing the steps he was taking in retaliation for
China's crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators.
   John Taylor, the spokesman, said he had no information on the
content of the call. Nixon renewed U.S. ties with Beijing in 1972
after years of diplomatic isolation.

   A man and his 16-year-old daughter
were killed 11{ hours apart Thursday in separate accidents involving
pickup trucks in which they were passengers, state police said.
   The truck carrying Ronald Lee Pirl Sr. of Normalville apparently
was traveling fast when it went out of control at a curve on state
Route 1003 at 1:15 p.m., said Trooper David Heckman.
   The vehicle overturned twice, ejecting Pirl, 38, then killing him
as it landed on him, police said.
   The driver of the truck, Ronda Carbaugh, 25, of Normalville and
her 4-year-old daughter Shannon were in serious condition at
Pittsburgh's Allegheny General Hospital, said nursing supervisor
Marcie Zebley.
   Earlier, at 1:45 a.m., Pirl's daughter, Barbara, was killed when
the pickup truck she was riding in overturned and skidded into a
utility pole along Pennsylvania Route 31. Also killed was Sheila
Moore, 17, of Connellsville.
   The driver of the truck, Thomas Vanorsdale, 20, of Canfield,
Ohio, was in fair condition at Frick Community Hospital in Mount
Pleasant. Another passenger was in critical condition.

<TEXT>
   The Brazilian company JN Filmes has
bought the rights to make a movie about the life of slain Brazilian
ecologist Francisco ``Chico'' Mendes, producer Jofre Rodrigues
announced.
   Rodrigues told a news conference the firm won over such world
companies as Warner Bros. Inc. and United Artists in a two-month
competition.
   He said on Wednesday that JN Filmes signed a $1.76 million
contract with the Chico Mendes Foundation to lease exclusive rights
to an English-Portuguese film, TV series, autobiographical book and
videocassette on Mendes' life.
   A four-member panel from the Chico Mendes Foundation, an
organization made up of ecologists, rubber tappers and family
members, selected JN Filmes.
   Panel member Gilson Pescador said JN was picked because its offer
included making a TV series, a video and a book based on Mendes'
life.
   Mendes, 44, head of a rubber tappers union, won a United Nations
award for his struggle against ranchers out to clear the Amazon rain
forest for grazing.
   He was shot and killed in December outside his home in Xapuri,
Acre state, 2,700 miles northwest of Rio. A cattle rancher's son was
arrested in the case.

<HEAD>Regulators to Require Drug, Alcohol Testing of Nuke Plant Workers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission said Thursday
it now requires random drug and alcohol tests of workers at all U.S.
nuclear power plants.
   The rule takes effect July 7 and applies to all plants, whether
operating or under construction.
   Many utilities already conduct random tests for drug and alcohol
use by their plant workers, but the commission said it wanted to
assure that such testing is uniform.
   The commission in recent months has expressed concern at
increasing evidence that illegal drugs are used by some nuclear
plant workers, including reactor operators.
   The new regulation prohibits the use of alcohol ``prior to and
during work'' and also requires plant owners to find ways to contain
the use of prescription and over-the-counter drugs, and to address
other health problems such as fatigue.
   The rule requires drug testing of all workers who have security
clearances for unescorted access to nuclear plants, as well as
random follow-up testing of these workers.
   Tests for alcohol use are to be performed at the same time.
   A concentration of alcohol in the blood of 0.04 percent would be
considered a violation of the rule. Utilities may adopt even
stricter limits if they choose.
   Some people might show show a concentration after one drink. Many
states use 0.10 percent as evidence of drunken driving.
   Workers who test positive for either alcohol or illegal drugs are
to be denied access to protected areas and removed from their work
duties. They may return later if they are deemed fit to do so.
   A second confirmed positive test would mean a work suspension for
at least three years.
   Involvement in the sale, use or possession of illegal drugs by
anyone within a secure area of a nuclear plant would mean suspension
for at least five years. Any subsequent use of drugs or alcohol
would mean permanent suspension.
   For plant construction sites, the rule requires that utilities
seeking their operating licenses implement random drug and alcohol
testing and impose sanctions on users.

<HEAD>Wife Of Ousted Philippine President Has Record Album</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Imelda Marcos, who sang for votes for 20 years in
the Philippines, has recorded her first record album, a collection
of her husband's favorite love songs.
   Mrs. Marcos, wife of ousted Philippine President Ferdinand
Marcos, for years sang for constituents at political rallies, and
still entertains guests at her Makiki Heights home-in-exile.
   The album _ ``Imelda Papin Featuring Songs with Mrs. Imelda
Romualdez Marcos'' _ will be formally released Sunday during a
private reception in Waikiki.
   According to an announcement promoting the event, the 12-song
album features the favorite love songs of the 71-year-old Marcos,
who remained hospitalized in very critical condition Thursday at St.
Francis Medical Center here.
   Marcos, who has suffered massive organ failure and is plagued by
a widespread bacterial infection, underwent surgery Tuesday to drain
a pancreatic abscess.
   According to Marcos spokesman Gemmo Trinidad, the former leader's
``eyes lit up and his vital signs improved for a bit'' while he
listened to an early version of the tape several weeks ago in his
hospital room.
   Mrs. Marcos recorded six songs for the album, five solos and a
duet with Ms. Papin, who has 25 gold or platinum albums in her
homeland.
   Ms. Papin, a longtime friend of the Marcoses, produced the album.
   Her husband's failing health and the U.S. indictment against her
have not dampened Mrs. Marcos' desire to sing.
   She often sings for guests at her home, has entertained at public
events honoring her family and even occasionally breaks out in song
during interviews with the press.
   In New York last October for arraignment on federal racketeering
charges _ to which she pleaded innocent _ the former first lady sang
``Don't Fence Me In,'' while entertaining in her Waldorf Astoria
suite.

<HEAD>Bush Advisers Says Soviets Continue Sending Weapons to Nicaragua</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A special adviser to President Bush said
Thursday the Soviet Union is still sending weapons to Nicaragua's
leftist Sandinista regime, despite assurances given the United
States that such aid would stop.
   Soviet aid to the Sandinistas continues at the same level as
before, Edward L. Rowny, special adviser to Bush on arms control,
told a news conference in Mexico City.
   ``We have no evidence that the aid has slackened or lessened. On
the contrary, we have incontrovertible evidence that it continues,''
Rowny said.
   Rowny confirmed news reports that a high Soviet official had told
Secretary of State James Baker in Moscow last May that the Soviet
Union was cutting off military aid to Nicaragua.
   He refused to name the Soviet official other than calling him ``a
high authoritative source who knew what he was talking about,''
saying it would not be diplomatically proper for him to do so.
   Rowny was on a trip to Mexico and Brazil to brief leaders of the
countries and seek their reactions to Bush's latest proposals to the
Soviet Union for reducing armaments. He also was to brief them on
Bush's meeting with representatives of NATO nations in Brussels last
week.

   Endara, 53, and his supporters say he won the May 7 election.
International observers said Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, Panama's

then annulled the election when the fraud became obvious.
   ``Adios, first lady of the republic,'' read a large sign near the

   Anel Beliz, a spokesman for Endara, said President Bush
telephoned Endara to express condolences.
   The governments of West Germany, Spain, Brazil and Venezuela were
among those sending condolences.

   Tornadoes ripped through two small towns in Louisiana and Florida
on Thursday, destroying more than 30 homes and killing five people.
Tornadoes, rain and high wind from thunderstorms also caused damage
in parts of Mississippi and Alabama.
   One twister smashed into the Florida Panhandle town of East Point
early Thursday night, destroying several homes. A mother, her
daughter and grandson were killed in one home, officials said.
   The violent weather began developing along the Gulf Coast on
Wednesday, when a man who sought shelter in a metal-roofed shed near
Stapleto, Ala., was killed by lightning.
   Tornadoes skipped across several Louisiana parishes early
Thursday.
   One twister struck the small town of Grosse Tete, La., about 6
a.m. Thursday, destroying at least 25 residences and injuring about
two dozen people, in addition to the man and woman killed,
authorities said.
   ``We can't imagine how more aren't dead,'' Willie Hurdle, a
member of the Iberville Parish Police Jury, said of the town of 790
people. ``This is devastating. There's about 20 houses that aren't
even here anymore.''
   No serious injuries were reported 15 miles away in Baton Rouge,
where Fire Chief Ron Spillman said at least four twisters touched
down 19 times, destroying or damaging almost 70 mobile homes and 25
to 30 houses.
   Spillman estimated that between 400 and 600 people lived in the
destroyed or damaged residences. A shelter was set up at a high
school for those left homeless.
   Pieces of mobile homes were strewn in tree tops in Grosse Tete.
About 100 people were evacuated and were put up in emergency
shelters, Hurdle said. The storm left the town without electricity,
natural gas, water and most telephone service.
   One elderly woman was rescued from the rubble of her home after
rescuers used a power saw to cut through a pile of wood. Dogs were
taken to the area to search for more bodies and trapped survivors.
   Gov. Buddy Roemer toured the area by helicopter and Rep. Clyde
Holloway, R-La., said he would seek a federal disaster declaration.
   Over a two-hour period, tornadoes also were reported in the
parishes of West Baton Rouge, St. Helena, Livingston and Tangipahoa.
The early morning tornadoes in southeastern Louisiana followed a
night of violent weather in the western and central part of the
state in which several homes were destroyed or damaged late
Wednesday, but no serious injuries were reported.
   A line of thunderstorms that pounded the Florida Panhandle
produced several tornadoes. One ripped through East Point, about 85
miles southeast of Tallahassee, at about 7 p.m. EDT.
   Three houses and three mobile homes were destroyed and two
businesses heavily damaged, Franklin County Sheriff's deputies said.
The three people killed were a 16-year-old boy, his mother, 33, and
his grandmother, 51.
   Other tornadoes destroyed a house, damaged a supermarket and
knocked down two temporary buildings. At least 6 inches of rain fell
at Milton, the National Weather Service reported.
   A U.S. park ranger suffered a broken arm and cuts Thursday when a
tornado destroyed the entrance station at the Fort Pickens section
of the Gulf Islands National Seashore on the western Florida
Panhandle. She was thrown 10 to 15 yards and only the concrete
foundation of the station was left, officials said.
   Another tornado hit Ellisville, Miss., damaging buildings and
uprooting trees. Trees and power lines were down across from the
campus of Jones County Community College, where summer classes were
underway, but officials said there was no campus damage as earlier
reported.
   Mississippi Power Co. official Dana Hill said most power in
Ellisville was restored by early afternoon.
   Heavy rain was reported in several areas of Mississippi during
the night, with up to 4 inches on coastal sections.
   A half-mile section of U.S. 49 near Brooklyn, Miss., was closed
after water gushed around an overloaded culvert and cut a tunnel
underneath the two-lane roadbed, Highway Department resident
engineer Ed Schaub said. The roadbed did not wash out, but a section
of pavement about 12 feet long cracked and dropped about 18 inches.
   Tornadoes touched down in several communities on the Alabama
coast, causing minor injuries and destroying two homes in Orange
Beach, damaging 23 others, and overturning a mobile home in
Robertsdale, said Lee Helms of the state Emergency Management
Agency. More than a dozen mobile homes were damaged in Bay Minette,
and a house was damaged in Lillian, near the Florida border,
officials said.
   At Gulf Shores, Ala., Police Chief Arthur Bourne said the coastal
resort experienced ``a little beach erosion, high winds and heavy
rain. But mostly we've just hit-and-missed with tornadoes and water
spouts.''
   Alabama Power Co. reported that 22,000 customers in the Mobile
area were without power. Lightning apparently struck a substation
that caught fire, power company spokesman Bernie Fogarty said. The
city got 2 inches of rain between midnight and noon.

   President Bush said Thursday he had seen no
change in Iran's terrorist policies since the death of Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini, and repeated his offer to improve relations if
Iran helped free U.S. hostages held in Lebanon.
   The United States, he said, wants ``a change in relations ... We
like the Iranian people.''
   ``I stated the other day what it would take to have improved
relationships, and that would a reunciation of terror,'' he said at
a news conference, repeating a statement he made last Monday, two
days after Khomeini's death was announced.
   ``We can't have normalized relations with a state that is branded
a terrorist state,'' he said.
   ``And secondly they must facilitate the release of American
hostages. That is what it would take,'' he said.
   The president noted that the speaker of the Iranian Parliament,
Hashemi Rafsanjani, had said Iran would use its influence to help
free nine American hostages held by pro-Iranian Shiite Lebanese if
the United States helped free Shiites taken by Christian militiamen
in Beirut. Rafsanjani had made a similar offer months ago.
   ``We supplied them information,'' Bush said, without offering
details. But he said it would take more than a change in rhetoric to
improve U.S.-Iranian lessons.
   ``It is going to take a change in behaviour,'' he said. ``We
don't mind name calling. They keep calling us the Great Satan. That
doesn't bother us ... Performance is what we are looking for.''
   ``I don't see so far any sign of change,'' he said, adding that
he had ``held out the olive branch'' in his inaugural speech on Jan.
20.
   His message to Iranian leaders, then as now, was ``You want
better relations, do what's right. Do what's right by people by
people who are held against their will. We see no movement. I repeat
that offer tonight.''

   A man who searched in 11 states for his two
sons was reunited with the boys Wednesday, 9{ years after their
mother took them to a Christmas party and never returned.
   Gerald Gromer said after meeting with his sons Mark, 14, and
Luke, 12, for the first time since 1979 that the boys were upset and
bewildered at being separated from the mother who police say
abducted them.
   The reunion was held Wednesday morning behind closed doors in a
state police barracks.
   Their father, a 34-year-old Moose Lodge manager from Bourbonnais,
Ill., described the reunion as ``not the happiest. We have lots of
things to work out in the next couple of months. But we're going to
make it.''
   After the boys were turned over to their father, a Superior Court
judge issued a temporary restraining order late Wednesday afternoon
saying the boys were to stay in Vermont until a court hearing
Thursday.
   But before the order could be served on Gromer, he and the boys
had boarded a flight from Burlington to Chicago.
   The boys' mother, Loretta Gromer Frey, allegedly took the two
boys and fled Illinois with a religious group in 1979 after their
father had been awarded custody by a divorce court.
   The group settled in Vermont several years ago but moved around
to several locations in the state, said Sgt. Jean Lessard of the
State Police.
   Ms. Frey was arrested in Woodbury on Tuesday on a warrant
charging her with child abduction, state police said.
   Gromer was told Tuesday that his children had been found, ending
a search in which he said he said he spent more than $20,000 and
traveled to 11 states.
   Gromer said his sons would not answer questions or comment
publicly. He said, ``They can't understand why they have to go back
to Illinois and why I can't come to Vermont to join their church.''
   Gromer described the church, which went by the name His Community
in Illinois but uses the name Christ Covenant Church in Vermont, as
a cult. He said his children had been ``somewhat brainwashed.''
   Lessard, in a separate interview, said police did not consider
the group a cult. ``We'd rather refer to it as a communal church,''
he said.
   Gromer's second wife, Sue, said they learned that the boys had
been found Tuesday morning. ``We've either been in police stations
or on planes or at home packing since then.''
   Ms. Frey, 34, faced a federal charge of unlawful flight to avoid
prosecution as well as the state charge, for which she was ordered
held under $75,000 bail pending extradition to Illinois.
   Gromer said that when his estranged wife abducted the chilren,
``the whole (church) group, about 100 people, up and left town on a
single day.''
   Lessard said the church group included some children, but that
Gromer's was the only case in which the children left against the
will of the person who had custody.
   His Community was founded by Roman Catholics in the Kankakee,
Ill., area as a Bible study group in the 1970s, said the Rev. James
McDermott, who worked with the group at its early meetings.
   Protestants joined in, and the group evolved into a cult with
strong leadership, said McDermott.
   ``They decided to leave. They were going to be the new exodus
from Egypt,'' McDermott said.

   President Bush and top Republicans say a press
aide was solely responsible for the GOP memo comparing House Speaker
Thomas S. Foley's voting record with that of a homosexual
congressman, but Democrats aren't buying it.
   ``One staffer can't take the fall for an entire Republican
political operation that's up to its knees in sewer-style
politics,'' said Ron Brown, chairman of the Democratic National
Committee.
   Mark Goodin, communications director of the Republican National
Committee, resigned Wednesday and took full blame for a memo
comparing Foley's voting record to that of liberal Rep. Barney
Frank, D-Mass. The memo was titled: ``Tom Foley: Out of the Liberal
Closet.''
   Goodin, who worked in the press operation of Bush's 1988
campaign, said in resigning that he never intended ``to damage
anyone's reputaion.'' He said RNC Chairman Lee Atwater, who was
President Bush's campaign manager, never knew of the document.

   House opponents of the Bush administration's
planned $6 billion FSX fighter deal with Japan are far short of the
votes needed to override an expected presidential veto.
   A measure to restrict the deal passed the House on Wednesday but
only on a 262-155 vote, far less than the two-thirds margin of 290
needed to override a veto in the 435-member chamber.
   The administration already has agreed to develop the fighter
jointly with Japan. The measure passed Wednesday seeks to stipulate
the U.S. negotiating position in future talks on how the FSX, an
advanced version of the F-16 jet fighter, actually will be produced.
   An identical Senate resolution passed 72-27 on May 16.
   Opponents of the deal say it amounts to a giveaway of critical
U.S. defense technology, but the Bush administration says the
restrictive legislation would tie its hands in the talks.

   The first AIDS vaccine tested in the United
States on humans triggered their immune systems into action, raising
hopes that one vaccine may protect against many forms of the AIDS
virus, researchers said.
   One top U.S. researcher said he is optimistic enough to recommend
wide testing of the vaccine.
   ``We are making progress, and I think we will be able to make a
vaccine eventually,'' said Dr. Clifford H. Lane, head of AIDS
vaccine testing at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious
Diseases.
   Despite the encouraging results reported Wednesday, many
important questions remain about whether this _ or any _ vaccine can
keep people from catching AIDS.

   Come home, Clark Gable. All is forgiven.
   Twenty-nine years after his death, the ``King of Hollywood'' has
finally won back the hearts of those who live in his hometown.
   Gable _ at least his legend _ will be the guest of honor this
weekend as Harrison County and some stars of ``Gone With the Wind''
commemorate the film's 50th anniversary by re-enacting the famous
Twelve Oaks barbecue scene and attending a screening of a restored
version of the movie.
   The 850 residents of this eastern Ohio village, where Gable was
born Feb. 1, 1901, haven't always regarded him as a favorite son.
The gawky, gap-toothed, big-eared boy never returned to the county
after he moved about 80 miles northwest to Akron in 1917.

   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell said
Thursday Congress is ``caught in a vise'' of competing pressures on
ethics reform, but he promised action.
   ``We do have a problem. We have to act. We will act,'' Mitchell
said.
   He said that skepticism about public officials is healthy but
that ``a danger occurs when skepticism becomes cynicism and
mistrust.''
   Mitchell renewed his call for a ban on speaking fees, coupled
with a pay raise. But he said members of Congress are reluctant to
risk the wrath of their constituents by voting themselves raises to
make up for losing the fees.
   One possibility, he said, would be to gradually lower limits on
speech fees, known as honoraria, while gradually increasing
congressional salaries.

   A House panel chairman Thursday distributed
federal data identifying 205 industrial plants as increasing cancer
risks through release of airborne toxic chemicals. The Environmental
Protection Agency quickly disputed his interpretations.
   An EPA spokesman said the information was old and incomplete, and
complained it was ``highly irresponsible'' to use it as ``reflective
of risks in the real world.''
   However, Rep. Henry A. Waxman, chairman of the House Energy and
Commerce environment subcommittee, said that even potentially
inaccurate figures should be released because they ``indicate the
enormity of the problem'' and represent a ``stunning demonstration
of the urgency of the public health threat.''
   Waxman, D-Calif., said at a news conference that toxic chemicals
present a cancer risk near the plants at least a thousand-fold
greater than levels accepted by experts.
   The plants on the list, compiled by the EPA, pose at least a
1-in-1,000 cancer risk to people getting maximum exposure for a
lifetime, while the EPA deems a risk of more than 1-in-a-million as
unacceptable.

   A University of Chicago study released Thursday
suggests that federal officials may be significantly underestimating
the number of Americans with AIDS and that there are more whites and
fewer blacks with the disease than previously believed.
   Edward O. Laumann of the National Opinion Research Center at the
University of Chicago said that estimates by the federal Centers for
Disease Control of the numbers of AIDS case are distorted because
affluent whites can afford to be treated discreetly by physicans who
do not report the disease.
   He said in a telephone interview that there also are cases that
are not reported due to bureacratic problems that slow the count or
misfile cases.
   The CDC makes its estimate based on cases reported to official
agencies. An undercount or a failure to report cases could seriously
affect the CDC estimate, said Laumann.

   The state Supreme Court declared Kentucky's
system of public schooling unconstitutional Thursday and ordered the

   By permitting a wide gap between poor and wealthier school
districts, the legislature failed to meet its constitutional duty,
the court ruled.
   ``Lest there be any doubt, the result of our decision is that
Kentucky's entire system of common schools is unconstitutional,''
Chief Justice Robert Stephens wrote for the court's five-member

   Deep inside Cheyenne Mountain, the
military's nuclear detection force uses outdated equipment to
protect the nation from attack. Officials say a $1.3 billion
upgrading now under way will not be completed for years.
   Green phosphor radar monitors, surplus from the Federal Aviation
Administration, were designed back in the 1950s to track airplanes,
not to monitor the globe for missiles, according to those who use
them. They call the washing-machine-size monitors ``green monsters.''
   Nearby is the phone they would use to contact the president in
the event of a nuclear attack. It's wired downstairs through an
old-fashioned plug-in switchboard.
   ``There's a lot of antiquated stuff at Cheyenne Mountain, there's
no doubt about it,'' said Lt. Col. Rick Oborn, a Pentagon spokesman.
   The facility was built in 1957. More than 693,000 tons of granite
were removed from Cheyenne Mountain outside Colorado Springs to make
way for 15 buildings housing 700 people. They work behind 30-ton
blast doors 1,400 feet inside the mountain.
   The Cheyenne Mountain complex, built at a cost of $142 million,
was originally designed to track airplanes that could launch a
nuclear attack against the United States. When the Soviet Union
entered the space age, monitoring missile launches became an added
duty.
   The facility has been criticized by both Congress and its
watchdog agency, the General Accounting Office, for failure to keep
pace with technology, for project delays and for cost overruns.
   Although the center's airplane tracking computer has been
improved, the updating of three other computers used to track
submarines, missiles and some 7,000 objects floating in space will
not be finished until at least 1994.
   Methods used to gather the raw tracking data used at Cheyenne
Mountain are classified, but it is known that some information comes
from satellites, some from intelligence sources, including spies,
wiretaps and monitored radio conversations, and much from
ground-based equipment.
   Work on updating Cheyenne Mountain is proceeding slowly because
of mistakes made in the past, said Col. Glen P. Doss, director of
missile warning for the Air Force Space Command, which oversees
operations at NORAD, the North American Aerospace Defense Command.
   The switchboard will eventually give way to a modern
communications system. The green monsters _ where missiles and subs
show up as green dots on dinner-plate-size screens _ are to be
replaced with multi-color displays.
   The center's aircraft trackers are already using the new
equipment to follow as many as 50 planes at a time on a screen;
where they were once represented by a jumble of green numbers, the
aircraft now are categorized by color.
   ``You can look at the green friendlies and the red unknowns,''
said a Canadian officer in charge one recent day at the joint
U.S.-Canadian tracking center.
   ``I can look at a screen and get five times the amount of
information'' as with the old ``1950s technology,'' he said.
   Replacing the communications system is estimated to cost $255
million. Replacing the display system will cost $268 million, and
putting in a survivable communications integration system will cost
$135 million.
   The project to replace the computer system to track satellites is
already over budget, behind schedule and can't perform many of the
functions required, according to a new GAO report. The system was
originally expected to cost $290 million, but will now cost $437
million. The system was supposed to be operating by June 1988, but
won't be completed until 1994, the GAO said.
   The military is even planning a backup center, in case Cheyenne
Mountain were destroyed. Construction began in April on the
underground facility at Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska.
   On a recent day in Cheyenne Mountain's Air Defense Operations
Room, a team of military officers monitored the flights of two
Soviet Bear Delta bombers off the coast of Iceland. The planes, on a
routine patrol, were are not considered a threat.
   These trackers have two minutes to identify an aircraft that
enters U.S. airspace. If it is not identified, they scramble jet
fighters.
   Now, by pointing a ``mouse,'' or computer pointer, at the dot
representing a particular plane or submarine, the trackers can see
its latitude, longitude, designation, and other details. With the
old system, planes and subs could only be tracked with paper and
pencil.
   In a room deeper inside the mountain, an officer using a green
monster kept track of three Soviet submarines in the Norwegian Sea;
they showed up as dots with their classification beside them
indicating they were capable of carrying nuclear ballistic missiles.
   Another officer tracked the Soviets' unmanned MIR space station
over Australia.
   The sub and missile monitoring area, using satellites with
infrared cameras, is at the heart of Cheyenne Mountain's operation,
the command post. The trackers work in a temporary facility,
slightly larger than the average living room, while a new $178
million command center is being built next door.
   To their right are the battle stations, each with red telephones
for officers who would help direct America's nuclear war.
   When the Soviets launch a missile, the front door of the command
center is locked tight. There are no klaxon horns, just the
beep-beep-beep of the command network telephone alerting all points
that a missile is airborne.
   The launch shows up as a triangle on a green monster, with the
fan of the triangle showing the missile's general direction.
   The commander in chief of NORAD is notified, and he stays on the
phone until the missile is considered safe.
   In these days of detente, the Soviets usually give U.S.
authorities advance notice of launches. Intelligence officials pass
the word to Cheyenne Mountain, but sometimes the officers keep it a
secret to see how their trackers perform.
   In 1979, a technician placed a training tape with missile warning
events into a newly installed computer tracking system, and the
command center thought the United States was under attack and went
on alert, NORAD officials said. Later that year, it happened again
when a computer chip failed and began feeding erroneous information
into the system, officials reported.
   As that system is replaced, Col. Louis A. Kouts, director of
space defense and surveillance, said he hopes to avoid the mistakes
that were made installing it all at once instead of in segments.
   Another problem then was that some of the computers could not
exchange information, as needed, NORAD officials said.
   Despite GAO criticism of the new system, Doss defended it and
said he is trying to do something that has never been done with
computers before: save money by using equipment off the shelf rather
than getting it specially designed.
   ``Unfortunately, cost is a factor here. I have to worry about it
every day,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   With the vast Indian Ocean to its south
and uneasy neighbors to its north, India is building up its military
might.
   ``India is a mini superpower in the making,'' a Western military
expert said.
   Its array of weapons includes a nuclear-powered submarine,
aircraft carriers, MiG-29 fighter planes and recently acquired
medium-range ballistic missile capability. Indian and Western
military analysts say the country is developing a power projection
well beyond the Asian Subcontinent.
   The nation of 880 million people has 1.36 million men in uniform,
the world's fourth-largest force in terms of manpower after the
Soviet Union, China and the United States.
   The 115,000-man air force with 870 planes ranks behind only the
United States and the Soviet Union in the crucial field of heavy
combat airlift capability.
   India also has been one of the world's largest arms importers
since 1986.
   More than 25,000 scientists and engineers are working in 15
laboratories and 60 research centers on hundreds of major weapons,
electronics and other defense-related developments. The government
is spending $1 billion a year on research and developments projects
alone.
   ``India is developing such a military might, especially in the
air force and navy, that it is amounting to giving notices to
superpowers that their roles in the region are subject to check,''
said the Western military expert, who represents a NATO and would
speak only on conditiion of anonymity.
   On May 22, India successfully test-fired its first-medium range
ballistic missile, becoming only the seventh nation in the world
with the demonstrated ability to make its own ballistic missiles.
   The 1.2 million-man army is adding four new divisions to the
existing 34 _ an increase of 80,000 combat soldiers.
   Indigenous weapons already tested or under development include
light combat aircraft, pilotless aircraft, cluster bombs,
high-altitude parachutes, light field guns, main battle tanks,
armored personnel carriers, advanced panoramic sonar to detect enemy
submarines, variable depth sonar, homing torpedoes, anti-submarine
electric torpedoes, mines and mine-breaching equipment and a new
range of small arms and wheeled vehicles.
   India is also building a superport in the southern state of
Karnataka for developing submarines and ships, including its own
30,000-ton aircraft carrier.
   A long-range reconnaissance aircraft, capable of patrolling as
far as Australia and Africa, is in the planning stage.
   India is the only country outside the Soviet bloc to have
acquired the Soviet Union's latest MiG-29 fighters. Negotiations are
under way to build MiG-29s in India.
   India's two aircraft carriers give the 53,000-man navy a
constantly available fixed-wing seaborne air power.
   ``Given the vast coastline (3,525 miles) the naval strength is
not much, but at least we have a blue-water navy now,'' said a
Defense Ministry official, speaking on condition he not be
identified.
   ``Our aim is to be self-sufficient. We are not gearing our armed
forces for battle. It is just the opposite. We believe all these
will work as deterrents.''
   India has fought three wars with neighboring Pakistan since
independence from Britain in 1947. But its biggest rival in the
region is China with whom it fought a border war in 1962 and lost
territory.
   The Indian navy has 14 submarines, including a nuclear-powered
sub leased from the Soviet Union, and it is trying to lease three
more nuclear-powered subs from the Soviets.
   India's most recent achievement was the test firing of the
medium-range Agni missile, named for the Hindu fire god.
   The missile has a range of 1,550 miles, capable of reaching China
in the east and as far west as Iran. The two-stage rocket can
deliver a one-ton payload _ enough to carry a nuclear warhead,
according to Indian military experts.
   India exploded a nuclear device 15 years ago but insists its
nuclear program is for peaceful purposes. Western military experts
say, however, Indian scientists could assemble a nuclear warhead in
a week's time.
   The Agni test capped a missile development program that started
in 1983.
   However, the Western military expert said it would be years
before India could put its capabilities to use.
   ``It is one thing to develop something, but another to use it,''
he said.

<TEXT>
   For more than a century, the Elks club has
chosen the kind of members it believes stand for the American ideals
of equality, charity and brotherhood. For all that time, almost all
of them have been white men.
   Even in cities as racially diverse as Los Angeles, Elks lodges
remain the preserve of the white male, with written rules that ban
women and voting procedures that critics say stack the deck against
blacks.
   But that may be changing, according to civil libertarians and
legal experts, because of recent challenges to the membership
practices of the 121-year-old Benevolent and Protective Order of
Elks.
   Several California lodges have threatened to go to court if they
are unsuccessful in persuading the national organization at its
convention next month in Atlanta to change voting rules to admit
more black members.
   The California attorney general's office is investigating
possible civil rights violations by a Lompoc lodge that rejected two
black applicants.
   And a Utah woman rejected for membership in a St. George lodge
has filed a sex discrimination lawsuit against the Elks club.
   Elks leaders have strongly defended the club against all
challenges, contending that members have a constitutional right to
associate with whomever they choose. But legal experts say that the
Elks will be held to the same civil rights laws the courts have
applied to the Rotary club and other organizations.
   Ultimately, they say, the Elks will be forced to change their
ways.
   ``The Supreme Court has been very clear that it is not at all
solicitous and protective of groups that want to discriminate,''
said Erwin Chemerinsky, law professor at the University of Southern
California and an expert on civil rights litigation. ``I'm sure that
would include the Elks.''
   The accusations of racism and sexism and the prospect of change
in membership have rattled Elks leaders and tarnished the reputation
of the 1.6 million-member group. ``Why's everybody picking on the
Elks?'' asks spokesman Robert Yothers. ``I wish somebody would tell
the true story, the good side of the Elks club.''
   The Elks project an image as American as the flag, its members
donating their time and money to everything from rodeos to pancake
breakfasts. The club raised $53 million last year for charity
nationally.
   Critics say the true story is actually an unusual mixture of
charity and discrimination.
   For most of its history, the Elks explicitly limited membership
to white men. In 1973, the bylaws were changed to include all men,
but women still were banned and voting rules that gave great power
to a small group of members has effectively kept out blacks.
   In the Los Angeles area, for example, the 13 Elks lodges have
more than 9,000 members, none of them women, none of them black, and
only a smattering of them Asian and Hispanic, according to lodge
officials, most of whom spoke on condition of anonymity. One lodge
exalted ruler said he was unaware of the change in rules to allow
black members. His lodge has never had one.
   Critics find it ironic that lodge members who are willing to
raise money for charitable groups serving black children are
unwilling to share a drink in the lodge with a black businessman.
College-bound girls are given Elks scholarships, but
college-educated women can't join the lodge.
   ``It just makes you feel a little disappointed that this sort of
thing could be happening in this day and age,'' said Ernest
Hutchinson, 57, a Santa Barbara County housing official who was one
of the two blacks rejected this year by the lodge in Lompoc, 140
miles northwest of Los Angeles.
   The other was Joe Martin, 56, a Realtor. The two have been told
that fewer than a dozen lodge members cast ``no'' votes by placing
black marbles into the voting box. Even though nearly 140 members
supported them, Elks voting rules require only three black marbles
to reject, or blackball, an applicant.
   ``I truly felt deep down in my heart that they would accept me,''
said Martin. ``But it is just a few bad apples. I feel more pity for
those people than anger at my situation.''
   The rejection of Hutchinson and Martin, two longtime residents
with many friends in the community and lodge, outraged the city of
31,000. The newspaper printed angry editorials, the school board
refused to accept Elks scholarships, and a boycott of Elks functions
was in the works. Just last week, the Santa Barbara City Council
voted to block donations from a local lodge, part of Lompoc's
region, to city-sponsored youth programs.
   In late March, Deputy Attorney General Louis Verdugo Jr. in Los
Angeles confirmed that the state was investigating the lodge for
possible violations of California's civil rights law, the same law
the U.S. Supreme Court upheld in ordering the Rotary club to admit
women.
   Under community pressure, the Lompoc lodge and others in Santa
Barbara County passed a resolution to urge the national Grand Lodge
to change voting procedures to a two-thirds majority. If the
national organization balks, the California lodges plan to go to
court with the NAACP.
   ``Sure we're concerned'' about opposing the Grand Lodge, said
Butch Simas, Elks Western Central Coast District leader. ``But we
are willing to go against the national lodge.''
   While the California lodges prepare to challenge the voting
rules, Sandra Beynon of St. George, Utah, continues to battle her
local lodge, with a lot less fanfare, for the right to become a
member.
   Ms. Beynon, a construction company manager denied membership in
1987, contends the Elks club is violating state liquor laws banning
discrimination in most places that serve alcoholic beverages by the
glass. Her suit is pending.
   ``The local Elks lodge in this state is one of few places where
people can conduct business over a cocktail at lunch or a drink
after work,'' said her attorney, Brian Barnard. ``By excluding
women, the Elks have denied a large segment of society of the right
to develop business contacts.''
   The challenges to the Elks membership practices in California and
Utah have rankled national Elks leaders.
   Yothers denies that racism was at work in Lompoc, noting that no
member of that lodge has admitted blackballing the two black
applicants because of their race. However, he acknowledged that if
they did make such an admission they would face expulsion from the
lodge.
   He also said it was illogical to admit women to the Elks club,
which he calls a fraternal organization similar to a college
fraternity. ``You don't let women in fraternities, and you don't let
males in sororities. This whole thing just doesn't make sense.''

   Now the GOP activist is reportedly at the top of President Bush's
list of nominees to head the U.S. Census Bureau, evoking strong
reactions from some Democrats worried he might tinker with the 1990
Census.
   ``A political hit man'' is what California Assembly Speaker
Willie Brown called Heslop, adding he ``has always been a very
political operator.''
   Brown told reporters the appointment of Heslop to head the Census
Bureau would ``guarantee an under-count of blacks and Hispanics,''
which Brown said ``would be an absolute disaster for Democrats.''
   Heslop was chief reapportionment consultant to California
Republicans following the 1970 census. He has maintained
professional and social contact with GOP leaders since he left
Sacramento in 1973 to establish the Rose Institute at Claremont
McKenna College near Los Angeles.
   Heslop, a 51-year-old Oxford-educated British immigrant, is so
publicity-shy that a reader has to search the fine print to even
find his name in the 34-page annual report of the Rose Institute.
   Heslop refused all public comment since his name surfaced for the
Census post _ except for a response to Brown.
   ``No one is more concerned than I am with ensuring an accurate
census count,'' Heslop said, adding that ``to engage in some sort of
rebuttal of statements made by Willie Brown about a position that
has not yet been offered to me is nonsense.''
   Brown's judgment of Heslop is not universal.
   ``Brown was intemperate, unfair and just plain wrong ... instead
of trying to undercount minorities, Heslop has sought ways of
increasing their representation on lawmaking bodies,'' said
political editor Martin Smith of McClatchy Newspapers.
   Many California Democrats have declined comment on Brown's
charges, with few willing to disagree with the powerful Assembly
speaker on the record.
   ``Heslop's not Attila the Hun, and he's certainly not a racist,''
one California Democrat said on the condition his name not be used.
   Tony Quinn, a former GOP reapportionment consultant who is head
of research for the California Department of Commerce, said Heslop
is ``eminently qualified'' for the Census post.
   ``He has spent a lot of time on demographic issues. Heslop knows
the West and Southwest in particular, and he has worked closely with
minorities,'' Quinn said.
   Some Democrats have read Machiavellian motives into Heslop's
assistance to minority political activists. They contend that
designing districts to put more minority politicians in office
undercuts Democratic attempts to spread the heavy Democratic
majorities of minority neighborhoods over more districts.
   That view is disputed by Richard Santillan, a Hispanic activist
who chairs the Department of Ethnic Studies at California
Polytechnic University in Pomona.
   ``That's an invalid argument. Greater minority representation is
going to help, not hurt the Democratic Party. What it may be
undermining is the entrenched white leadership of the Democratic
Party, but it's not undermining the party,'' Santillan said.
   Santillan added he ``always had suspicions that the Rose
Institute was a Republican front'' _ before he met Heslop.
   ``In 10 years working with him, Alan Heslop has never overtly or
subtly tried to slant our research or inhibit it,'' Santillan said.
``There are people who produce statistics to help one party or the
other, but Alan Heslop has never done that.''
   ``Politically, I'm exactly opposite of Alan Heslop...If he
becomes the census director, he will look to the Latino community,
to the black community and to the Asian community for input, and it
will be meaningful input,'' Santillan said.
   The Rose Institute of State and Local Government is part of
Claremont McKenna College, a private college with 840 students that
is one of six related colleges sharing a single suburban campus
about 30 miles east of downtown Los Angeles.
   Heslop serves as head of the political science department and
director of the Rose Institute, which is located in a former
psychology lab on the campus. It receives no subsidy from the
college and operates as a non-profit, self-supporting think tank.
   The institute has spent more than $1.5 million over the past
dozen years to build the California Data Base, which has
computerized 126 categories of political, economic and other
demographic data on California's 5,000 census tracts and 26,000
voting precincts.
   ``No one else, at least this side of the Mississippi, has managed
to combine political demographic data with advanced techniques of
computer analysis to the extent that we have,'' Heslop said in a
1984 interview.
   The institute has received grants from businesses and foundations
and has had contracts with political, governmental and business
groups to conduct studies, use its database or host seminars.
   The institute's 1988 annual report lists among its paying clients
both the George Bush and Michael Dukakis presidential campaigns, the
state of California, the University of California, Los Angeles
County and businesses ranging from AT&amp;T to Hughes Aircraft.
   The most controversial incident in the institute's history was a
$700,000 project, financed by a group of corporate executives known
as the California Roundtable, to develop a ``model reapportionment
plan'' for legislative and congressional districts following the
1980 census.
   Heslop insisted that the plan was intended to be a nonpartisan
yardstick for use in evaluating the plans produced by the
Legislature. Democrats denounced it as a sham to promote GOP and
conservative efforts.

<HEAD>A Literary Dame Turns to the Theater</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT WOLF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dame Iris Murdoch easily envisions the public for
her novels: ``It's the chap sitting by the window reading, or
possibly rereading, the book.''
   Plays, however, are a different matter. ``Why do people go to the
theater?'' she asks. ``Why don't they stay home?''
   The comparisons spring readily to mind for Dame Iris whose new
play, ``The Black Prince,'' is well into its London run.
   The drama, which opened April 25 at the Aldwych Theater, marks
the third West End play from the erstwhile philosophy professor and
author of more than 20 novels, beginning with ``Under the Net'' in
1954 through to the award-winning 1978 ``The Sea, the Sea'' and
``The Book and the Brotherhood'' last year.
   Adapted from her 1973 novel of the same name, ``The Black
Prince'' casts Ian McDiarmid, long a mainstay of the Royal
Shakespeare Company, as a tax assessor named Bradley Pearson who
nurses ambitions to be a great writer.
   The ``black prince'' of the title refers to the Greek muse
Apollo, whom Bradley invokes as the God of poetry and music. But the
play itself is specifically steeped in Shakespeare, particularly
``Hamlet,'' a play which Bradley exalts as ``a monument of words ...
a wild act of audacity.''
   The writing swings from black comedy to tragedy in a surreal
finish that suggests her Czech forbear, Franz Kafka. It's among
London's weightier, more highbrow nights out, and Dame Iris
acknoweldged being uneasy about how long it will survive.
   ``One does want a period of exposure,'' she said in an interview.
   She was encouraged to adapt the novel to the stage by her
producer Josephine Hart, wife of the advertising executive Maurice
Saatchi.
   ``I was interested, naturally,'' she said. ``It's jolly lonely
being a novelist; it's occasionally a great pleasure to work in the
theater.''
   She said a play is a totally different object from a novel.
   ``It's much more like a poem; one's got to pack in a great deal
of action and passion and explication,'' she said. ``Every single
line matters; every word matters.''
   Whereas theater profits from an economy of word and gesture,
novels can be more expansive, and Dame Iris' works have been likened
to the rangy, large-scale fiction of such 19th-century English and
Russian writers as George Eliot and Charles Dickens, Lev Tolstoy and
Fyodor Dostoevsky.
   Such comparisons delight her.
   ``In a humble way, I feel very much I belong to that tradition of
the novel,'' said the author, who was made a Dame by Queen Elizabeth
II in 1987.
   ``They are great sources of power. So are men like Henry James,
and I'm very attached to (Marcel) Proust.''
   Her novels exert their own mysterious power, with their
alternately satiric and comic depictions of the witty and
well-educated English tumbling into infidelities, improprieties, and
violence: murder in ``The Book and the Brotherhood''; suicide in
``The Nice and the Good'' and ``The Good Apprentice.''
   ``The Black Prince'' itself encompasses several deaths, alongside
lengthy ruminations about the function of art and the nature of
illusion versus reality.
   ``If you write a story dealing with conflicts of interest, you
encounter forms of violence of various sorts,'' explained Dame Iris,
adding that she does not regard violence as any ``particular
oddity.''
   Her blueprint for novel-writing involves ``some quite complicated
knot involving some character, or a problem.''
   ``I think the imagination just works out of the darkness. One has
to sit and wait.''
   The Irish-born daughter of a civil servant, she moved to England
with her parents as a baby. Oxford-educated, she lives in the
university city today with her husband of 33 years, English
professor John Bayley.
   Dame Iris neither courts nor shuns publicity, preferring to stick
to a daily routine: writing with a pen _ she loathes word processors
_ in the morning, followed by shopping and housework in the
afternoon. Her husband cooks the evening meal.
   Her next novel, ``The Message to the Planet,'' will be published
in Britain on Oct. 2 and in the United States early next year. While
she claims to have ``forgotten'' what it's about, she feels her
craft is improving.
   ``My books have got longer, but I also think they've got better.
If one goes on practicing a craft, up to a certain point one gets
better,'' she said.
   ``Art is very much a matter of courage and confidence, too, not
just ability.''

<HEAD>Savings Bonds Keep Up With The Times</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In their search for a hip investment for the
sophisticated 1990s, some advisers are putting aside their computers
and their calculators and recommending U.S. savings bonds.
   Why such an old plain-vanilla idea when so many newer and more
exotic flavors are available?
   Well, for one thing, recent changes in the tax laws that
drastically altered many money management strategies left savings
bonds unscathed.
   They are no way to get rich fast, and they never will be. But
they are versatile, practical and safe.
   Perhaps best of all, they offer some measure of protection
against just about any foreseeable financial misfortune, whether the
economy gets too hot or too cold.
   ``Whether saving for college or retirement, U.S. government
Series EE savings bonds offer an attractive `tax-sheltered'
investment for people at any income level,'' says William Brennan,
editor of the newsletter Financial Planning Reporter published by
the accounting firm of Ernst &amp; Whinney.
   ``Their variable interest rate, with a 6 percent floor, provides
a double-edged sword with which to fight either inflation or
deflation.''
   Furthermore, say analysts at Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. in the
firm's weekly publication The Outlook, ``just now, with interest
rates drifting lower, Series EE savings bonds have special appeal
because they lock in yields for six months at a stretch.''
   The savings bond program, revamped in 1982, has operated for
decades on a system similar to the one adopted for modern vehicles
known as zero-coupon bonds.
   They are sold, in denominations as small as $50 and as large as
$10,000, for half their face value. They provide no current cash
distributions, but instead appreciate gradually in value as interest
on them accumulates and compounds.
   Provided that you hold them for at least five years, the
government guarantees an annual interest rate of 6 percent, or 85
percent of the yield available on five-year Treasury securities,
whichever is higher.
   The variable rate, recalculated each May 1 and Nov. 1, currently
stands at 7.81 percent through Oct. 31, Brennan notes.
   Savings bonds' ``tax shelter'' is twofold. As the interest on
them builds up, you can choose not to pay any federal income tax on
the interest until you cash in a bond.
   In addition, savings bond interest, like that of other securities
of the federal government, is exempt from state and local income
taxes.
   With bonds bought any time starting Jan. 1 of next year, there
will be an extra kicker. You can avoid any tax at all if you use the
proceeds from them to pay for education expenses such as college
tuition and your adjusted gross income on your tax return is $60,000
or less for a married couple, $40,000 or less for single filers.
   Savings bonds bought before next year don't qualify for this
special treatment. However, suggests Standard &amp; Poor's, if you are
holding older bonds in a college savings program, you might consider
cashing them in at some point and reinvesting the money in new ones
that are eligible for the tuition tax break.
   Savings bonds can be bought, without commissions or fees of any
kind, from banks, savings institutions, or through payroll savings
plans offered by many employers.
   A bank that does not carry an inventory of bonds in the larger
denominations may provide you with the form necessary to order the
bonds from your nearest Federal Reserve Bank or branch.
   The government promises to replace your bonds without a fuss if
they are stolen, lost or destroyed.
   To be on the safe side, advisers say, make a list of the bonds
you own, their face amounts, serial numbers and purchase dates, and
keep the list somewhere separate from where the bonds are stored.
   That way, you'll be able to be very specific should you ever have
to ask to have them replaced.

<HEAD>Steven Banks Brings Innovative One-Man Show to Showtime</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHRYN BAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Steven Banks is not easy to categorize. He's a
comedian, actor, rock musician and impressionist. He's very funny _
and he has something to say.
   His one-man tour-de-force, ``Steven Banks' Home Entertainment
Center,'' has been packing them in on the West Coast, and viewers of
the Showtime cable network get a look-see beginning Saturday.
   The hour-long show was taped on stage at Marines Memorial Theatre
in San Francisco. This month, Banks begins an extended run at the
Canon Theatre in Beverly Hills.
   Set in Banks' slovenly bachelor pad, the show is a series of
imaginative comic vignettes, but in a larger sense it's an inspiring
story about being stuck in life at thirtysomething and taking a risk
to get your dream.
   It opens with Banks coming home early from his dead-end job in
the corporate maze and donning his jammies so he can delve into his
fantasy life as a rock star. He cheers his own entrance with the
chant: ``Banks! Banks! Banks! Banks! ...''
   His telephone messages include repeated and increasingly
irritated calls from the office, but also a surprise call from
Lance, a high-school pal who's now a rock star.
   The eccentric Banks' kitchen shelves are lined with boxes of
Duncan Hines cookie mix, the sink is full of dirty dishes, and the
walls plastered with posters of his musical heroes. The slightest
task, be it talking on the phone or typing, turns into a performance.
   Banks is being hounded by his boss, Mr. Buttle, to finish writing
a speech that was due that afternoon. Though his intentions are
good, Banks constantly distracts himself by any means available to
avoid the mundane, and grown-up, job.
   At one point, he emerges from his closet in a tacky Vegas
jumpsuit, stuffs it with a pillow and launches into a homage to
Elvis, ``Who Killed the King of Rock 'n' Roll?'' Banks' childlike
imaginings turn bitingly satiric. ``It wasn't me, says Lisa Marie,''
goes one verse. ``I loved my dad and he loved me. ... When I get all
of his mon-ey, I'll give it to Scientology. ...''
   Banks is also being pressured by his girlfriend, Phoebe, who
intends to move in with him. Not only that, the landlord is
complaining about the noise from his drums and promises to toss
Banks out if there is one more drumbeat from his apartment.
   So Banks grabs up a guitar and gets so involved in his
impersonation of Bob Dylan, he answers the phone in a nasal,
``There's no one here by that name. This is the Dylan residence. ...
D-Y-L-A-N. ... Bob. ... B-O-B. ... Yes, it is. ... Why, thank you
very much!''
   When Lance calls back, Banks thinks he's being offered the chance
of a lifetime _ Lance's drummer has quit. But Banks' drum audition
over the phone only succeeds in costing him his apartment _ he's
already lost his girlfriend and is on the verge of losing his job.
So he does the only reasonable thing _ explodes into a punk-rock ode
to his own life:
   ``Twenty-two: degree! Twenty-three: McDonald's! Twenty-four:
Unemployment! Twenty-five: Buttle! Twenty-six: Buttle! Twenty-seven,
28, 29, 30, 31, 32! But now I'm 33, I'm tryin' to be cool, I'm
jumping around in my living room ...''
   The song fades as Banks realizes that's exactly what he's doing
and his life is a shambles.
   But this is a show with a happy ending, even in real life. The
theater audience gives Banks a standing ovation and provides an
authentic, ``Banks! Banks! Banks!''

<HEAD>Taxing Inflation, A Legislated Snow Job</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As the capital gains tax law now reads, you could
pay taxes on no gains at all, which is just one of the reasons why
the capital gains issue could become a hot topic of discussion in
Washington this year.
   The discussion wouldn't be a new one; it has been around for two
decades, and if action isn't taken this year it will be around next
year too. In fact, the debate is likely to continue as long as
inflation exists.
   The explanation for this oddity is that the capital gains tax law
imposes a levy on inflation. It causes people to pay taxes on
imagined ``income,'' on earnings that never were. In some instances,
it might even tax losses.
   Tempers are flaring. Supporters of the existing capital gains law
argue that to lower the rate would be a gift to the rich, while
advocates of change contend that the existing law is a legislated
snow job.
   For this and other reasons, President Bush seeks to fulfill a
campaign promise to lower the maximum capital gains tax rate, which
is now at the same 28 percent to 33 percent that applies to ordinary
income.
   And it may be a factor also in causing Rep. Dan Rostenkowski,
chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, to consider relaxing
his strong opposition to a cut.
   The existing law makes no provision whatever for inflation,
although inflation has long been a fact of modern life and most
likely will continue to be. In fact, only rarely since World War II
has it been absent.
   Consider the predicament of an investor who bought $10,000 of
mutual funds in 1983 and who today still has only $10,000 in
purchasing power after selling his shares. The fund did appear to
grow _ by 21 percent _ but so did inflation.
   For taxing purposes, the taxpayer has earned $2,100, to be
assessed at whatever his or her tax rate might be. But in reality _
in terms of dollars equal in purchasing power _ the investor has
never made a nickel of profit because the gains did not outpace
inflation during that period.
   It could have been worse. The value of the investor's shares
could have dropped to $9,000 in real dollar terms but, because of
inflation, have given the appearance of having risen to more than
$10,000.
   Already a loser by $1,000 in real dollars, the investor becomes a
double loser after paying taxes. It is a situation that hardly
encourages long-term or risky investments in the American economy by
either rich or poor.
   What might be a fair solution, indexation, has always been
available to lawmakers but for mysterious reasons it never has been
used. Lawmakers, like most people, may not like to concede that
inflation is a long-term boarder.
   Indexation would automatically erase from tax computations any
``gains'' attributable solely to inflation, leaving taxes to be
assessed only on real earnings as measured by dollars of comparable
purchasing power.
   Simply stated, tax assessors would use the same measuring stick
of value for the investment when made and for the investment when
redeemed for dollars.
   As matters stand, critics say, the calibrations on the measuring
stick vary from year to year. For example, whereas a linear foot in
1983 had 12 inches, in 1989 it is declared, in effect, to have no
more than 9.5 inches.
   Why, they say, you wouldn't even consider measuring snow that
way.

<HEAD>Homosexual Congregation Breaks Ground By Joining Mainline Christian
Church</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Though churches have condemned homosexual
activity for centuries, gay men and women are beginning to find a
home within a mainline Christian denomination.
   The Spirit of the Lakes Ecumenical Community Church became the
nation's first openly homosexual congregation to join a mainline
church when it was accepted into membership of the United Church of
Christ in April, according to its leader.
   ``As far as we know, we're making history,'' said the Rev. Dan
Geslin, pastor of Spirit of the Lakes. ``We see ourselves as a
prophetic voice.
   ``We hope that we're breaking ground and leading the way for
other churches and other denominations to open up and recognize gay
and lesbian people's rightful place in the church.''
   Spirit of the Lakes has grown from 18 people meeting in a living
room in May 1987 to 150 members. It was voted into membership by
more than 80 percent of the delegates attending the annual meeting
of the Eastern Association, the largest of the United Church of
Christ's three associations in Minnesota with 71 churches and 24,000
members.
   Spirit of the Lakes is considered a ``developing'' church while
the association reviews the group's constitution and development
plan. Those are likely to be approved at the association's 1990
annual meeting, formalizing the congregation's admission,
association officials say.
   Samuel Loliger, co-coordinator of the United Church Coalition for
Lesbian-Gay Concerns, an Athens, Ohio-based special-interest group
within the church, said the acceptance of Spirit of the Lakes is a
first for mainline denominations.
   ``This one is certainly very different than anything we have
encountered before,'' he said. ``It is an openly gay and lesbian
congregation, and they have sought to become a church with that
right up front.''
   Most Christian churches accept homosexuals as members, equally
beloved by God as others, but condemn the practice of homosexuality.
   But the United Church of Christ, a 1.8-million-member Protestant
church formed in 1957 when the Evangelical and Reformed Church
merged with the Congregational Christian Churches, often has been at
the forefront of progressive social movements.
   In 1969, the church's general synod approved its first resolution
supporting civil rights for homosexuals, and three years later it
became the first mainline denomination to ordain an openly gay
minister.
   In 1983, the general synod passed a resolution stating that ``a
person's sexual orientation is not a moral issue'' and that sexual
orientation should not be the basis for discrimination within the
church. The synod encouraged United Church of Christ churches to
openly accept homosexuals as members.
   That inclusiveness is what attracted Spirit of the Lakes to the
denomination.
   Geslin, 39, who grew up in Anoka, a Minneapolis suburb, received
a master of divinity degree from the Pacific School of Religion, a
United Church of Christ-affiliated school in Berkeley, Calif. He
took over as pastor of Spirit of the Lakes in September and
immediately began pursuing membership in the denomination.
   ``The discussion was, `Why bother to affiliate at all?' Most
(homosexuals) look at established churches as oppressive
institutions,'' Geslin said.
   But the membership was attracted by the United Church of Christ's
structure, which allows autonomy for each congregation.
   ``This is the best of both worlds for us,'' he said. ``We can
remain an autonomous congregation ... and still associate with a
larger Christian body. That allows us to be a community of
gay-lesbian Christians and at the same time not be ghetto-ized.''
   He described the congregation as college-educated professionals
who come from Catholic, Lutheran and Episcopal backgrounds and are
interested in social justice, peace, liberation and feminist
theology.
   Although Spirit of the Lakes has generally met with quiet
acceptance, some have voiced reservations.
   ``I do not think that any congregation should come in with a
sexual or a racial orientation,'' said the Rev. James McCutcheon,
senior minister of the United Church of Christ-affiliated Wayzata
Community Church. ``I would be bothered if somebody proposed a
church just for men, or a church just for women, or a church just
for married couples, and so on.''
   Geslin says 10 percent of his church's membership is heterosexual.
   Spirit of the Lakes also is bucking Christian tradition which
holds that the practice of homosexuality is a sin.
   People who interpret the Bible literally point to several Old and
New Testament passages that appear to condemn homosexuality. One is
Leviticus 20:13, which according to the Revised Standard Version
says, ``If a man lies with a male as with a woman, both of them have
committed an abomination.''
   But Geslin and McCutcheon contend that the Bible must be
interpreted in the context of the time in which it was written.
   When Leviticus was written, Geslin said, ``the Israelites were
instinctively concerned with maximizing the probabilities of
procreation. Religious laws governing sexual practices reinforced
that basic tribal concern.''
   Geslin criticizes people who use specific Bible verses to condemn
homosexuals today.
   ``It's not taking the Bible as a whole,'' he said. ``It's picking
out little bits and pieces to justify cultural prejudices.''

<HEAD>Opera Bastille: High Tech Musical Complex</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARILYN AUGUST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The countdown has begun at the Opera Bastille.
   Some 1,500 hard hats are working double shifts putting finishing
touches on the gleaming glass and steel structure scheduled to open
July 13 as the French mark the bicentennial of their revolution.
   French opera buffs hope the high-tech musical complex _ built on
the square where revolutionaries stormed the Bastille prison on July
14, 1789 _ will finally put Paris on the international music map.
For the moment, doubts remain.
   The new Opera had been leaderless since last January when Israeli
conductor Daniel Barenboim was fired because of what President
Francois Mitterrand's representative said were his high fees and
``elitist views'' on opera.
   Pierre Berge, the head of the Yves Saint Laurent fashion empire
and the man Mitterrand appointed to manage the project in its final
days, said Barenboim's replacement would be someone who understood
the president's wish to create a ``modern and popular opera''
accessible to the masses.
   Five months of speculation and uncertainty ended last month when
that someone turned out to be Myung-Whung Chung, a 36-year-old
Korean conductor known for his skills as a pianist. Soft-spoken and
unemotional, the new music director said he would be a team player
eager to work ``in harmony and unison'' with Opera Bastille
administrators.
   Warning he would not get entangled in the political infighting
that has beset the project from the start, he said, ``If there is a
fight, and I'll say it publicly right now, I won't fight. I'll just
leave.''
   Although Berge declined to divulge Chung's salary, he said his
five-year contract requires the maestro be in Paris for 27 weeks a
year for a minimum of 30 performances,
   Chung also let it be known he has his own ideas on ``popular
opera.''
   ``Popular means the house is full and people are dying to get
in,'' he said in an interview. ``I'd like to broaden the opera-going
public and see more young people and students in the audience.''
   Meanwhile, workers are busy getting ready for the inaugural
concert, billed originally as the centerpiece of official
bicentennial celebrations to be performed before Mitterrand,
President George Bush and other luminaries.
   French conductor Georges Pretre will conduct the Paris Opera
Ballet Orchestra and Chorus, with a host of international
celebrities performing selected arias from well-known French operas.
The concert will be staged by American director Bob Wilson, the
longtime darling of the French avant-garde.
   The Opera-Bastille's first bona fide operatic production is
scheduled for next February. Although Chung did not reveal the
program, the real star of the show is sure to be the building itself.
   The new Opera is a hulking mass of polished granite, glass and
stainless steel designed by Canadian architect Carlos Ott. Critics
compare it to an ocean liner in dry dock, looming over the Place de
la Bastille in eastern Paris. The prison was torn down during the
revolution.
   A technical wonder, the Opera Bastille is everything the ornate,
century-old Paris Opera is not. The Palais Garnier may be a landmark
known worldwide for its baroque design and Chagall-decorated
ceiling, but it has been inadequate for decades.
   The old Opera has a scant 1,600 seats with unobstructed views and
virtually no backstage, which meant that sets had to be built
elsewhere, dismantled, brought in and reconstructed. The cost was
staggering, and so were ticket prices.
   Tickets to the new Opera Bastille are expected to cost a maximun
of 250 francs (about $40), less than half their cost at the Palais
Garnier, which from now on will be devoted to ballet.
   The Opera Bastille has 12 stages in all, including a main stage
flagged by five stages and an adjoining rehearsal stage identical to
the main stage, plus five identical stages one level below.
   All are fitted with freight elevators, electronically controlled
and motorized wagons on conveyor tracks so that sets for an entire
opera can be moved from rehearsal stages to the main stage within 10
minutes.
   Michael Dittmann, the scenic director who drew up the technical
specifications, calls the Opera Bastille ``practical, not
sophisticated.''
   ``Sophisticated means complicated, and this building isn't
complicated,'' he said during a tour of the building. ``It's very
simple. It's a place where you have a lot of space. Here we don't
have the daily problem of where to put our decor in between
performances.''
   The main stage offers 4,300 square feet of space and is 66 feet
high. It is equipped with 9 elevators, 72 traps and a movable
orchestra pit that can be open or closed in two to three minutes.
   A bridge over the main and backstages allows stage hands to load
the ceiling with carpets, curtains and other decor without
monopolizing the stage. The ceiling is also designed for storage,
thus economizing two hours a day when productions alternate.
   There is ample space for costumes, workshops and storage areas,
connected directly to the main stage. The Opera Bastille is a
musician's dream with rehearsal rooms galore _ three for the
orchestra, two for ballet, two for the chorus, 16 studios for
singers and 12 for musicians.
   While backstage areas are still dusty construction sites, the
main hall itself is nearly ready. On a recent visit, workmen were
busy polishing granite pillars, washing windows, waxing hardwood
floors and installing cushions.
   Despite a glass ceiling and a cold color scheme in white, black
and gray, the atmosphere is pleasant and intimate, aided, in part,
to wooden walls and two tiers of graceful balconies reminiscent of
Japanese pagodas.
   Dittmann says the hall's computer-analyzed acoustics are
excellent. Even the hall's chairs have been designed with acoustics
in mind: There are small holes which allow the sound to pass through
when they are empty.
   A polystyrene joint under the building absorbs vibrations from
the three metro lines that intersect under the Place de la Bastille.
   ``If that isn't enough, the subway cars themselves will be fitted
with special rubber tires,'' he said.

<HEAD>Analyst Says Lack of Innovation Partly to Blame for Soviet Food Lag</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The huge purchases of U.S. grain by the Soviet
Union are welcomed by American farmers and are seen by some analysts
as proof that the vast agricultural system dictated by Kremlin
policy is inefficient.
   Whether the Soviet agricultural shortcomings are a result of poor
technology, planning, climate or other factors are tantalizing
subjects for debate. But some of the facts _ notably Moscow's huge
food imports _ are unmistakeable.
   In the year that began last Oct. 1, the Soviets have bought a
record of more than 20 million metric tons of U.S. wheat and corn,
mostly the latter. Not to mention soybeans, soybean meal and sorghum
grain.
   In all, says USDA export analyst Steve MacDonald, American
farmers will ship a record $3.4 billion worth of commodities to the
Soviet Union this year, up from $1.93 billion in 1987-88.
   Soviet agriculture clearly has been unable to keep up with rising
domestic demand.
   Some observers have cited the central planning of agricultural
policy as a principal reason for Soviet deficiencies; others say
farmers are not given enough incentives; and still others say the
Soviets are technologically inferior in food production.
   Bob Koopman of the department's Economic Research Service notes
that Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, in a speech early this
year, called for broad reforms of his nation's agriculture.
Gorbachev had said that agricultural investment in the Ukraine, the
Soviet Union's bread basket, increased by 320 percent over the past
20 years, while production rose by only 39 percent.
   Koopman, writing in the June issue of Farmline magazine, examined
the ``technical efficiency'' of Soviet agriculture, roughly a
measure of ``output per amount of inputs,'' or the resources used to
produce crops and livestock.
   Many western researchers have assumed that Soviet agriculture is
not technically efficient. Koopman said he is not so certain.
   ``The Soviets combine resources differently than we do,'' he
said. ``For instance, they use relatively more labor and less
machinery than we do. But considering the way they use their
resources, they appear to be just as technically efficient as we
are. They seem able to use an older, more labor-intensive technology
efficiently.''
   Production costs are higher in the Soviet Union, but given the
available resources, Koopman said Soviet farmers produce close to
the maximum level possible.
   Using a computer model to compare agricultural production,
Koopman found that given different combinations of the same
resources _ fertilizer, labor, livestock, machinery and land _
regions in the Soviet Union compared favorably with those in the
United States, Canada and Finland.
   The results don't mean that agricultural production in the Soviet
Union is as cost-effective as in the other countries, Koopman said.
It's not, he said, but Soviet agriculture ``generally achieves as
great an output as possible _ as great as the non-Soviet areas were
able to achieve _ given the resources available to work with.''
   Thus, Koopman said, the ills of Soviet agriculture, including the
heavy handedness by planners and the lack of incentives for farmers
``appear to have little impact on technical efficiency'' when
compared with the regions studied.
   Why, then, is there such stagnation in Soviet agriculture?
   Koopman said the Soviet Union lacks ``dynamic efficiency,'' or
the ability to expand or grow where it counts.
   ``The Soviet and non-Soviet systems (in the study) have nearly
equal levels of technical efficiency, but the non-Soviet areas are
more effective at growth,'' he said. ``Perhaps the reason lies in
the inability of central planners to facilitate innovation and
technological change.''
   Koopman added:
   _Soviet farmers are slow at introducing new technology because
they are ``in a sense hamstrung'' by the government.
   _When farmers need new equipment, they have to request it from
central authorities, who may or may not plan to produce such
equipment in the next five-year plan.
   _If technology everywhere is static and no major improvemnts are
made, Soviet farming can be considered technologically efficient.
But as technical changes take place in the West, for example, Soviet
farmers lag behind.
   ``They're already using more and more resources and not achieving
any greater output,'' Koopman said. ``They need to encourage more
flexibility, more autonomy, more incentives to innovate _ rather
than just trying to improve their allocation and use of resources.''
   Just giving incentives to farm workers isn't enough by itself, he
said. They must have more freedom to select what they need to
produce.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ With the Kremlin relaxing Stalin-era bans on the
practice of religion, dozens of new Islamic mosques are opening
across Soviet Central Asia, a land awakening from decades of
complacent cronyism. But no one is sure where more religious freedom
and other reforms will lead in this volatile region separating the
heartland of the U.S.S.R. from Iran and Afghanistan.

<TEXT>
   Soviet Central Asia, an arid land
historically at the crossroads of caravans and conquerors, is being
buffeted by resurgent Islam from the Middle East and political
reforms from Moscow.
   With new freedoms under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms,
residents of the broad band separating the Soviet Union's Slavic
heartland from Iran and Afghanistan are expressing their religious,
ethnic, and political concerns.
   That represents further progress for Gorbachev, whose program
already has stirred other areas of the Soviet Union. But it also
sets the stage for a possible race between secular communist reform
and revitalized Islam for the future of a land awakening from
decades of complacent cronyism.
   Much depends on the abilities of new civil and religious leaders
to persuade people that more freedom can help solve their problems
and not just offer a vent for their frustration.
   Such frustration has sparked bloodshed in other southern Soviet
republics _Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia _ and appears to be
spreading to Central Asia. Severe economic problems led to rioting
in two cities of the Turkmen republic bordering Iran in May. A
rampage of arson and murder between ethnic groups in eastern
Uzbekistan in the past week killed scores of people.
   But ultimate success in the region is vital to the Kremlin, faced
across its southern frontier with Iran's Islamic fundamentalism and
Afghan rebels who fought the Soviet Army to a standstill. Both
inspire some radicals.
   In an interview after being chosen the new spiritual leader of
Central Asia's Moslems recently, 36-year-old Mohammadsadyk
Mamayusupov indicated he would follow previous religious leaders in
cooperating with the government, but use the reforms broadly to
improve religious life.
   ``We intend to use this moment very judiciously for the
development of our religion and the renewal of its spiritual life,''
he says.
   Mamayusupov has moved quickly where he can. Between Feb. 6 and
mid-March authorities gave permission for the opening of about 35
new mosques, and he pledged that ``we will continue to open mosques
until all the requests of our Moslems are satisfied.''
   Only about 200 mosques are sprinkled across the five Central
Asian republics: Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kirghizia, Turkmenia and
Tadzhikistan, which occupy an area half the size of the continental
United States.
   The number of students in Islamic academies is being doubled and
the number of Korans and other religious books being published will
be greatly increased. The Kremlin is removing a Stalin-era ban on
group religious education and plans to allow believers to organize
charities.
   But radicals predict the increased attention to religious needs
will lead more people to embrace Islamic fundamentalism.
   ``We need to raise the people up,'' said one Moslem radical who
favors establishment of an Iranian-style Islamic republic. ``It
won't be in two, three, or four years. It has to be done very
quietly.'' He spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The stakes are considerable. The population of the five Central
Asian republics is booming. From 1970 to 1987, it increased 26
percent to 47.5 million and now makes up about 18 percent of the
Soviet population.
   At the center of much of the region's activity is Uzbekistan and
its capital, Tashkent. The historic cities of Bukhara and Samarkand
along the Silk Route are centers of religious culture.
   What is now Soviet Central Asia accepted Islam in the first
century after Mohammed and was a crossroads for Mongols, Turks,
Persians and Slavs until it was absorbed in Czarist Russia's drive
south in the 19th century.
   Although officially atheist, the Soviet Union nevertheless has
maintained relations with Iran, and Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze held a rare meeting with Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini
last winter.
   The Soviet Union has supported Arab causes in the Middle East
diplomatically and militarily for more than two decades, but now is
trying to improve relations with Israel in order to play a bigger
role in any Middle East peace settlement.
   Mamayusupov, rector of the Higher Islamic Institute in Tashkent,
owes his selection in part to the resurgence of religious feelings.
   In early February, Mufti Shamsuddinkhan Babakhan was ousted by a
series of protests in which radicals accused him of corruption and
lacking sufficient religious knowledge. A council of religious
leaders elected Mamayusupov to replace him.

   Six weeks after ousting Babakhan, believers were demonstrating
again. But this time they were praising God for the return of a
7th-century Koran, a gift from the Uzbekistan government.
   There also have been protests that have taken on a more political
or ethnic character, reflecting other influences.
   Ethnic resentment between Uzbekis and Meskhi Turks, who were
forcibly resettled to eastern Uzbekistan's Fergana Valley by Stalin
in 1944, exploded in early June. Scores of people died and hundreds
of houses were torched. Thousands of Meskhis were evacuated to
protect them, but even then the 9,000 Interior Ministry soldiers
sent in had difficulty keeping order.
   Bands of young people frustrated with high prices and consumer
shortages rioted in two cities of the Turkmen republic bordering
Iran at the beginning of May.
   On April 9, Tashkent sources said, several thousand people
rallied to support Belik, an informal political group seeking to
establish Uzbek as the republic's official language and calling for
drastic measures to improve the environment. Belik means ``unity''
in the Uzbek language.
   In Central Asia, as in the Baltic republics and Armenia, the
deteriorating environment has become a rallying point that has
opened up broader issues such as economic reform and demands for
more local control.
   Gafkha Namatova, a Belik spokeswoman, said the group claims
100,000 members. It supports Gorbachev's reforms, she said, but ``we
see a lot that we like'' in the programs of the People's Front
grassroots organizations that have sprung up in the Baltics and
elsewhere.
   National policies demanding cotton production in Central Asia
have led to food shortages, she said. Abuse of farm chemicals on
those same cotton fields has increased infant mortality, she charged.
   In an interview with the Soviet government newspaper Izvestia in
March, the republic's new president, Mirzaolim Izragimov, said
cotton-growing must be de-emphasized.
   The policy of pushing marginal land into production ruined 1.73
million acres of pasture, he said.
   Drainage of rivers that flow into the Aral Sea, on the border of
Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan, has lowered the level of the sea and made
it one of the Soviet Union's top environmental concerns.
   Many of the policies and practices now being repudiated in
Central Asia are associated with former President Leonid I. Brezhnev
and his supporters.
   But experience has shown the danger of replacing local officials,
ignoring ethnic feelings.
   In 1986, riots broke out in Alma Ata, the capital of Kazakhstan,
following the replacement of the republic's party leader Dinmukhamed
Kunaev by Gennady Kolbin. Kunaev, an ethnic Kazakh, was a Politburo
member and a close associate of Brezhnev. Kolbin is a Russian.
   Brezhnev's son-in-law, Yuri Churbanov, was sentenced to 12 years
in a labor camp last December after being convicted of accepting
more than $145,000 from Uzbekistan officials.
   Mamayusupov pledged religious leaders would become more socially
active, fighting bribery, alcoholism and prostitution.
   Attacks on those social ills are not likely to bring him into
conflict with the Kremlin, but Moslem leaders could run into
difficulty with local authorities if they launch a serious
anti-corruption campaign.
   ``Moslems intend to struggle very actively in the social
sphere,'' he said, adding that ecology is the first target.
   While some civil discontent is organized openly through Belik and
similar organizations, the religious discontent remains largely
hidden.
   An underground group calling itself Islam and Democracy claimed
credit for the protests that ousted Babakhan, but it since has
splintered.
   Almaz Estekov, the 33-year-old chairman, preaches the need for a
strengthening of Islam as well as establishment of Western-style
civil liberties.
   But he said Islam and Democracy ultimately cannot cooperate with
Belik because of the latter's secular views.
   The influence of Khomeini's Iran may be limited. The vast
majority of Soviet Moslems are Sunnis, while Shiites are dominant in
Iran. The two sects have deep historic differences.
   Mamayusupov said the traditions of Soviet Moslems are strong
enough that they will not be carried away by attempts to export a
radical Islamic movement from Iran or Afghanistan.
   ``We have our own view and our own foundation,'' he says. ``We
can influence others, but others cannot influence us.''

   On the stage of the Eighth Van Cliburn
International Piano Competition, 12 pianists try to survive the last
performances of the semifinals.
   They sweat and smile nervously between pieces, as tension fills
the auditorium at Texas Christian University where a winner will be
announced on Sunday, June 11. But the question whispered
seat-to-seat is, ``Where is Van Cliburn?''
   The 54-year-old pianist and namesake of the quadrennial piano
competition has taken on the aura of mystery man in the world of
classical music since, at the age of 23, he stunned the world by
winning the prestigious International Tchaikovsky Competition in the
Soviet Union.
   His retirement from public performances in 1977, and his plans to
return to the concert stage later this month, have only increased
curiosity about the pianist, who says he doesn't want the world of
music to take him too far from the other things he holds dear.
   ``I want to have a balance, so that I can see my friends _ the
public _ and also be able to have home life,'' he said in an
interview. ``I must say, I'm such a Texan, being able to have
blackeyed peas and corn bread and turnip greens is just terribly
wonderful.''
   It was 1958, the height of the Cold War, when his Tchaikovsky
victory in Moscow catapulted Cliburn to international celebrity
status. He was the first American ever to win the coveted prize, and
he won by playing the explosive and romantic Piano Concerto No. 1.
   His reception back home in the states was akin that to that
granted Olympians: New York City gave him a ticker tape parade, the
city's first for a musician, and his concert schedule ballooned to
100 dates a season.
   Today, Cliburn is incredulous when he looks back on that time.
``Somebody would say, `How many did you play?' and I'd say, `Oh,
sometimes I ... don't want to count.'''
   In 1977, Cliburn said ``enough'' and stopped accepting concert
dates. While many thought his rest would be short, his hiatus
stretched to 10 years when he performed at the White House for
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and his wife. He plans to return to
the concert stage June 19 in a benefit performance of the Liszt
Piano Concerto No. 1 and the Tchaikovsky Piano Concerto No. 1 with
the Philadelphia Orchestra.
   Some of his recordings have been rereleased on compact disc and
new recordings are planned. Cliburn, however, doesn't plan to allow
the second stage of his career grow as hectic as the first.
   ``I love people and I love to meet them and all that, but I love
home life, and being able to be at home. That has been such a joy
for me,'' he said.
   Home, since 1987, has been a house overlooking Fort Worth where
he lives with his mother and first piano teacher, 92-year-old Rildia
Bee Cliburn. Cliburn was born in Shreveport, La., but spent his
boyhood in the east Texas town of Kilgore.
   He began playing piano when he was 3 years old, and made his
orchestral debut with the Houston Symphony when he was 12. The
following year, he performed at Carnegie Hall, made his New York
Philharmonic debut at 19 and went to Moscow at 23.
   But Cliburn never retired from the social scene, frequenting
favorite operas, restaurants and New York social events even while
his career was on hold. And the social whirl is never more frenzied
than during the competition, founded in 1962 to bring an
international piano contest to Texas and honor Cliburn. This year it
began May 27 with 38 competitors.
   The event has a budget of more than $2.5 million and draws
competitors from around the world. Cliburn sees its jury process,
which winnows a field of 38 competitors down to six finalists, then
a winner, as ``a way of divining an opportunity cycle'' for young
artists.
   The competitors' careers, he believes, will hinge on their
ability to communicate music, what he calls ``great pages of
literature,'' to the audience and, during the competition, to the
jurors.
   ``This is a performer's competition, and a performer is a
servant; he serves the composer and he serves the audience,''
Cliburn said. ``In my own case, I'm a very good audience _ I always
say that I am _ because I go to hear someone because I enjoy being a
member of an audience and I get very excited if someone speaks to
me.''
   Cliburn makes no choices in his own mind as he listens to the
performers, instead envisioning each in his or her career.
   A crowd favorite entering the final round is 19-year-old Aleksei
Sultanov of the Soviet Union, the youngest competitor this year,
whose appeal appears to rest in his individualistic style and boyish
charm. During the semifinals, Sultanov brought more than half the
audience to its feet with a rousing finale of Chopin's Sonata No. 3
in B minor.
   Audience members were again standing after the final recital of
the semifinals by Benedetto Lupo of Italy, who concluded with
Rachmaninoff's Sonata No. 2 in B-flat minor. Lupo, 25, also reached
the finals.
   Other finalists are Elisso Bolkvadze, 22, and Alexander
Shtarkman, 22, both of the Soviet Union; Jose Carlos Cocarelli, 30,
of Brazil; and Ying Tian, 20, of China. Shtarkman's father, Naum,
took third place to Cliburn's first in the 1958 Tchaikovsky.
   Cliburn said that while he doesn't plan to repeat the whirlwind
of performances that followed that Tchaikovsky, some aspects of a
concert career never change. One case in point: music critics.
   ``I've lived through all of that before, so I mean, that will be
not new,'' he said.
   Nevertheless, he is fearful as he plans his return to a concert
schedule. It's the same emotion he recalls experiencing every time
he went on stage.
   ``One of the things that you always feel as a performer _ at
least I always felt _ I always wanted so to do my best. If I didn't
do my best, I would be the person that would be hurt the most and
disappointed the most,'' he said.
   ``So every time I go on stage, you just remember _ I'll be
certainly wanting to do my best.''

   Tom Jackson, owner of a small electronics
business in Texas, always dreamed of a vacation hideaway, where he
and his family could play tennis or stroll on the beach any time
they wanted.
   But the 45-year-old Corpus Christi man couldn't afford to do more
than look until the developers of a nearby Padre Island condominum
slashed the price of their units by at least 40 percent.
   He and wife Kay recently snapped up a ``buy of a lifetime''
two-bedroom, oceanfront condo for $113,000, and received easy
financing.
   ``The only thing I regret is that I didn't buy a three-bedroom
condo instead,'' Jackson said.
   A number of equally anxious vacationers won't just be sunbathing
at the beach, fishing the lakes and hiking the woods this summer.
They're also likely to do some serious sightseeing in the local
housing market.
   Despite an overall slump in the property business nationwide,
real estate experts say this season is turning out to be a hot one
for many buyers.
   Many parts of the country offer bargain prices due to the fallout
from recent tax-reform changes, overbuilding, regional economic
downturns and declining interest rates, experts say.
   ``If I was in the market for a second home ... I would consider
now a good time to buy,'' said Tom Franks, a senior vice president
for the American Resort &amp; Residential Development Association, a
Washington-based trade group. ``There are a lot of good values out
there.''
   Although bargains can be had in just about any state if you look
hard enough, the market for the nation's 5.5 million vacation homes
varies by region just as with vacation spots.
   Some of the standouts this year, Franks and other experts say,
include properties located in parts of Florida; the Rockies; the
Texas gulf coast; Hilton Head Island, S.C.; Palm Springs, Calif.;
and parts of New England.
   Condominiums, in particular, carry big price cuts, experts say.
Units in the low- to medium-price range, which were eagerly snapped
up by investors during the inflationary 1970s and early 1980s, are
being unloaded because the Tax Reform Act of 1986 eliminated most of
the tax incentives on second homes, particularly for those who rent
out their properties.
   ``There's more demand this year for detached homes, little less
demand in condos. That's where I think one can do quite well,'' said
Gary Dionne, an agent with ERA Byse Realtors, a Laconia, N.H.,
broker that sells vacation homes in resort areas like Lake
Winnipesaukee.
   He said vacation homes prices, in general, have flattened out in
New Hampshire this year after skyrocketing two years ago. Prices
range from around $75,000 to $500,000.
   Condo prices on Hilton Head Island, S.C., have declined by about
40 percent overall from the mid-1980s, although oceanfront property
hasn't been hurt as much, according to local broker Juliana Toon
Pawley of Coldwell Banker &amp; Co.
   For as little as $25,000, bargain hunters can pick up a modest
two-bedroom modular unit on the Atlantic, about a quarter of what
they sold for five years ago, Mrs. Pawley said. More upscale
oceanfront condos usually start at around $120,000, she said.
   Further south, in the northern portion of Padre Island, Texas,
where Jackson, the Corpus Christi electrician, bought his vacation
home, waterfront units that sold for $200,000 three years ago now go
for around $120,000, said one developer, Jack Ponton of Nisbet
Ponton Corp.
   ``It's probably below cost,'' Ponton said, but added that prices
are starting to rebound a bit from last year as the oil-driven Texas
economy improves.
   Out West, older homes and condos in the Rockies also have been
especially hit hard, experts say.
   Los Angeles accountant Stan Ross said the three-bedroom house he
bought in the popular ski resort area of Park City, Utah, would
probably fetch the same price he bought it at seven years ago _
around $120,000.
   But Ross is taking the market downturn in stride. He said he
bought his vacation home as an easy getaway to enjoy and relax,
rather than as an alternative to the financial markets.
   Experts agree that prospective buyers should consider more than
just price when looking for a second home.
   What good is owning an inexpensive cabin across the country, for
instance, if it costs a fortune to get there?
   ``Most middle-income buyers should look at some place that can be
reached within a day's drive,'' said Franks. ``You shouldn't buy
something that doesn't have demand.
   ``It's kind of like anything in life: A bargain is not a bargain
unless it's something you want,'' said Franks.
   John Diamond, senior vice president for Real Estate Research
Corp. in Chicago, said buyers should do some careful research before
reaching any decision, like tracking local economic trends or making
sure the area in which they plan to buy isn't being overbuilt.
   It's also important to get a handle on local property taxes.
``You want to make sure it is a vacation home,'' said Diamond.
``Some people are shocked when they thought they bought a vacation
home ... and found themselves faced with the high cost of providing
schools and infrastructure in the far out suburbs.''

<TEXT>
   Saudi Aramco, Saudi Arabia's
oil-producing firm, says it struck a large well that could yield
8,000 barrels a day of crude oil.
   The company, which operates the world's largest oil field in a
country with the world's largest reserves, said Wednesday the find
was made in the Hawtah region in central Saudi Arabia about 120
miles south of the capital Riyadh.
   Saudi Aramco said preliminary tests indicated the well could
yield 8,000 barrels a day of light crude containing only 0.06
percent sulphur.
   Sadad, I. Husseini, Saudi Aramco's vice president for exploration
and production, said the find ``confirms the potential for
substantial discoveries ... in rock formations recently studied by
Saudi Aramco and assessed to be highly prospective.''
   Oil industry executives and company sources reported the strike
Tuesday. But they said it was made in the nearby Khurais region and
gave no details.
   The find was made as part of a major exploration program launched
by Saudi Aramco in 1986 after the Saudi government expanded the
company's exploration concession.
   It was the first strike since Aramco was restructured in late
1988 and the first in a promising area only recently identifed. Most
of the company's oil field is located in the east part of the
country.
   Saudi Aramco announced earlier this year that its proven reserves
have gone up from 169 billion to 252 billion barrels, and could
reach 315 billion barrels.
   The company has discovered 52 oil fields and one commercial gas
field since it started exploration 55 years ago.
   Under its current Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
quota, Saudi Arabia exports 4.524 million barrels a day, but in the
oil boom years output peaked at more than 11 million barrels a day.

<HEAD>New Season Production Outlook Better Than Forecast</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New season world grain production may be larger
than forecast, with early signs of an 11.4 percent increase on the
current season's drought-hit yield, according to the International
Wheat Council.
   The council, one of the foremost grain forecasting bodies, now
puts world wheat output between July 1989 to June 1990 at 533
million metric tons, compared with 537 million forecast last month
and 504 million last season.
   Production of coarse grains _ principally maize, rye, oats,
barley and sorghum, is now forecast at 840 million tons, against 830
million previously and 728 million this season, the council said
Wednesday.
   The rise is attributed to improved prospects for the Soviet Union
and the United States, with forecasts of 112 million tons for the
Soviets, up from with 97.6 million in 1988-89, and 240 million for
the U.S., compared with 149.6 million.
   Bigger coarse grain crops are also foreseen for China at 95
million against 93.6 million this season and the European Community
at 90 million, compared with 89.3 million.
   The Indian harvest, however, is expected to fall 2.6 million tons
to 30 million.
   Forecasts of 1989-90 wheat production, with 1988-89 estimates in
brackets, include:
   Soviet Union 90.0 million (84.5 million); China 89 million (87
million); the EEC 86.7 million (85.3 million); the United States
56.5 million (49.3 million); and India 50 million (45.1 million).
   The council's first forecast of 1989-90 world coarse grain trade
is down eight million tons at 93 million, reflecting the prospect of
lower Soviet imports, which could drop by 9 million to 16 million.

rose $1.75 to $53.50.
   Wednesday's advances were similar to gains chalked up earlier
this year when Time and Warner announced plans to merge and form the
world's largest media concern.
   News of a big takeover bid for a company often sparks interest in
other firms in that industry, but the activity in media and
entertainment stocks has had an added twist recently.
   The media, information and entertainment industries have
undergone a wave of consolidations in recent years, with large
companies snapping up other firms to create media giants.
   The buyers mainly have been foreign publishing and broadcasting
giants such as Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. and Maxwell Communication
Corp., and electronics behemoth Sony Corp. These companies have
scooped up U.S. media concerns in a torrent of deals made possible
in recent years by their own wealth and the weak U.S. dollar.
   The growth of media conglomerates was uppermost in the minds of
Time executives as they negotiated their agreement with Warner.
   Martin S. Davis, Paramount's chairman, apparently wants to be
part of the trend. If he succeeds in acquiring Time, his own
entertainment and publishing conglomerate would have a projected $7
billion in sales.
   A Time-Warner combination would have projected revenue of more
than $10 billion.
   Paramount, which changed its name from Gulf &amp; Western Inc. on
Monday, owns Paramount Pictures and Television, Simon &amp; Schuster and
Prentice Hall publishers, and a number of other broadcasting,
entertainment and publishing businesses.
   Time publishes magazines _ including Time, Life and Sports
Illustrated _ and books and also owns broadcast and cable television
properties including Home Box Office.

<HEAD>Court Denies Eastern's Appeal on Pilots' Strike</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURAN NEERGAARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A spokesman for the Air Lines Pilots' Association
says a federal appeals court ruling means Eastern Airlines' attempt
to expand its limited service may be stalled.
   But Eastern spokesman Jim Ashlock declined to comment on how the
ruling Wednesday by the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals would
affect plans for Eastern's reorganization.
   A three-judge panel of the appeals court upheld a lower court
ruling denying Eastern's request for an injunction against the
pilots union to stop the strike.
   Ashlock said the Miami-based airline has no plans to appeal the
case further.
   In another setback for Eastern, the Justice Department said
Wednesday it plans to file an antitrust suit blocking Eastern's
proposed sale to USAir Group Inc. of its airport gates in
Philadelphia and its Philadelphia-Toronto route.
   The Justice Department said the $85 million proposal ``threatens
to lessen competition'' in airline service between Philadelphia and
other cities, said Michael Boudin, acting antitrust chief for the
department.
   The appeals court ruling was prompted by a lawsuit Eastern filed
in U.S. District Court after most of the airline's 3,600 pilots
honored picket lines set up by members of the Machinists union when
it went on strike March 4.
   The walkout, also supported by Eastern flight attendants,
virtually grounded the carrier and compelled it to seek bankruptcy
protection from creditors March 9.
   Kenny Thomas, a communications specialist with the Air Lines
Pilots' Association, said the ruling ``reaffirms the pilots'
solidarity in dealing with (Texas Air Corp. Chairman) Frank
Lorenzo.''
   He also said the ruling strengthens the union's backing of
Chicago commodities trader Joseph Ritchie, who is trying to buy the
carrier from Texas Air, Eastern's parent company.
   Thomas said that in light of the ruling, officials for Ritchie
will meet with U.S. Bankruptcy Court officials in Washington to
discuss the proposed buyout again.
   Eastern's creditors have rejected Ritchie's proposal.
   Chuck Kilian, a striking Eastern pilot in Atlanta, said the
ruling was not a surprise but was a morale booster.
   ``As time moves along, we get more and more little victories,''
he said. ``This is a good victory at a good time. It gives us that
much more resolve and enthusiasm.''
   Thomas said the ruling means Lorenzo will not have enough pilots
to carry through Lorenzo's plan to rebuild the airline as a smaller
carrier and sell about $1.8 billion of its assets.
   Eastern said Wednesday it is negotiating to sell its South
American routes, possibly to rival American Airlines.
   ``We have talked to American,'' Ashlock said from Miami.
   He said Eastern also has held talks on the routes with other
airlines.
   Ashlock declined to identify the other carriers interested in the
South American network, which served 10 cities before Eastern was
struck, or to disclose Eastern's asking price.
   Wall Street analysts have estimated the value of the network at
about $150 million.
   Any sale of Eastern assets must be approved by a federal
bankruptcy court judge in New York. The judge recently approved the
sale of Eastern's Northeast shuttle to developer Donald Trump for
$365 million.
   American spokesman Ed Stewart acknowledged American's general
interest in Eastern assets but would not confirm that talks had been
held on the South American routes.
   ``We're looking at things that might be for sale,'' Stewart said
from American's Fort Worth, Texas, headquarters.
   For American, the nation's largest airline, the South American
routes would bolster its strategy to expand overseas. American
recently added new flights to Western Europe and has expressed
interest in Eastern's Caribbean routes.
   Before the walkout, Eastern served Caracas, Venezuela; Asuncion,
Paraguay; Barranquilla and Cali, Colombia; Buenos Aires, Argentina;
Guayaquil and Quito, Ecuador; Lima, Peru; La Paz, Bolivia; and
Santiago, Chile.

<HEAD>Lawmaker Warns FAA Chief on Eastern Maintenance</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shortages of staff and spare parts could be
hampering strikebound Eastern Airlines' ability to properly maintain
its fleet, the head of a congressional panel has told the Federal
Aviation Administration.
   Rep. Cardiss Collins, D-Ill., chairwoman of the Government
Activities and Transportation Subcommittee of the House Committee on
Government Operations, expressed the concern in a letter to acting
FAA Administrator Robert E. Whittington.
   While it is clear Eastern has suffered staffing problems because
of the 3-month-old walkout by Machinists union members, pilots and
flight attendants, Collins' letter raised the question of whether
the few planes still flying are receiving proper care.
   The FAA recently concluded a special investigation of maintenance
at Eastern's facilities at its Miami base and at Atlanta, but has
not disclosed its findings.
   The transportation subcommittee's staff has reviewed internal
company documents indicating that ``manpower and parts shortages
continue to plague the maintenance function of Eastern,'' Collins
wrote the FAA chief last Thursday. A copy of the letter was obtained
by The Associated Press.
   The impact of maintenance on airline safety has been highlighted
by several accidents. In one case, the National Transportation
Safety Board largely blamed Aloha Airlines' maintenance program for
failing to detect fatigue damage to the fuselage of a 19-year-old
Boeing 737 that split open over Hawaii, killing a flight attendant.
   Collins said Eastern's maintenance shortcomings appear to persist
despite several FAA investigations of the carrier and
``substantial'' fines against the airline, as well as commitments by
management to correct the problems.
   Whittington hasn't yet responded to Collins' letter, FAA
spokesman Fred Farrar said Wednesday. He said the special
investigation was completed on May 12 but the report on it hasn't
yet been submitted to the FAA chief.
   ``Everything they (Eastern) do is being watched,'' Farrar said.
``We're going to keep a very close eye on Eastern until the strike
is over.''
   Eastern spokesman Jim Ashlock said he couldn't comment on
Collins' letter because he wasn't familiar with the documents to
which she referred.
   ``Eastern is under the most intensive scrutiny that any airline's
ever been subjected to,'' he said, adding that the adequacy of its
manpower and parts could easily be checked.
   Early last month, Eastern temporarily surrendered its repair
station certificate at New York's John F. Kennedy International
Airport after the FAA determined the carrier had failed to follow
its system for recording and inspecting maintenance work.
   The suspension was for actions that predated the March 4 start of
the strike, which pushed Eastern into bankruptcy court five days
later.
   Soon after the JFK certificate was pulled, the FAA sent nine
inspectors to Eastern's main base in Miami to determine if
violations of maintenance record-keeping rules, such as those found
in New York, existed in Miami and Atlanta.
   JFK, Miami International and Atlanta's Hartsfield International
are the sites of Eastern's three principal maintenance facilities.
   If the FAA ordered Eastern to temporarily relinquish its
certificates for the Miami and Atlanta facilities, that could
severely hamper the airline's ability to operate.
   When a maintenance certificate is suspended, the airline is
prohibited from doing work at the facility until deficiencies are
corrected. The work must be contracted out, or planes needing
repairs must be ferried elsewhere.
   In her letter, Collins called Eastern's surrendering of its JFK
certificate ``unprecedented.''
   ``I am concerned that this may not be an isolated case, and may
be in fact, an indication of systemic problems throughout Eastern's
maintenance department,'' the lawmaker told Whittington. She asked
him to advise her of the results of the latest investigation as soon
as possible.
   Collins' subcommittee previously held hearings on maintenance
practices at Eastern and their potential impact on passenger safety.
She has expressed concern about Eastern's decision to continue some
operations during the strike.
   The airline has faced a number of FAA investigations in recent
years, including one in 1986 that resulted in a $9.5 million fine
for safety infractions and a threatened suspension of Eastern's
overall operating license.
   Eastern's unions contend the maintenance problems are systemwide
and endanger safety. They accuse supervisors of ``pencil-whipping,''
or signing their names to documents on aircraft repairs that weren't
made.
   The unions also charge that management, in an effort to cut costs
and maintain flying schedules, has bullied mechanics and pilots who
complain about serious maintenance violations.
   Eastern countercharges that some machinists hid or destroyed
maintenance records at JFK and then told the FAA that company
supervisors neglected to have necessary work performed. Company
representatives discovered records hidden in file cabinets and
stuffed under sofa cushions in union areas at the airport, said
Eastern spokesman Robin Matell.
   ``We've never dispatched an unsafe plane; we have one of the best
safety records in the industry,'' Matell said. He called union
complaints ``a deliberate attempt to drive away our passengers and
weaken the company.''

<HEAD>Central Bank Reveals Active Dollar-Selling Last Winter</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VIVIAN MARINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States spent more than $2 billion to
temper the dollar's rise in foreign exchange last winter, as higher
interest rates and political uncertainty abroad bolstered the value
of the currency, a Federal Reserve report shows.
   The latest quarterly foreign-exchange report issued Wednesday by
the Federal Reserve Bank of New York showed the Fed and the Treasury
sold $2.14 billion for the equivalent West German marks and Japanese
yen during the three months ended April 30.
   The dollar sales, which were mostly for marks, were the largest
since the $2.93 billion sold during the May-July 1988 period, the
Fed said.
   In the previous November-January quarter, the United States
bought $2.4 billion against the mark and yen, then sold $1.88
billion against marks as market sentiment turned more bullish for
the dollar.
   Sam Y. Cross, an executive vice president of the New York Fed,
said the latest operations were designed to maintain market
stability and generally were coordinated with the central banks of
the ``Group of Seven'' industrial nations. Besides the United
States, the G-7 includes Japan, Britain, West Germany, France, Italy
and Canada.
   Cross said that some of the government's intervention operations
were done jointly with other central banks, but at other times the
United States acted alone after notifying its trading partners.
   Currency traders are often keenly aware of the activities of
central banks in the open markets, but the Fed's policy is to
comment only well after the fact. The Fed also does not provide any
data on intervention by foreign central banks.
   The government's dollar-selling operations during the
February-April period came amid strong foreign demand for the U.S.
currency.
   U.S. short-term interest rates were comparatively higher than
those abroad as a result of inflation-fighting efforts by the Fed.
That made dollar-denominated assets more attractive to foreigners,
thereby increasing the need to convert to dollars.
   Political developments abroad also weighed against several major
foreign currencies.
   In Japan, an insider-trading scandal brought the government of
Prime Minister Takeshita under increasing pressure, while in West
Germany, the imposition and subsequent removal of a controversial
withholding tax on interest income brought considerable confusion to
the market.
   Intervention involving marks took place from Feb. 2 to Feb. 6,
when the government sold $350 million, according to the Fed report.
The government also entered the market between March 8 and March 30,
when it sold $1.419 billion; on April 10 and April 11, when it sold
$170 million; and on April 30, when it sold $50 million, the report
said.
   Sales of dollars for yen were made during the March 8-30 period,
amounting to $100 million, and on April 30, amounting to $50
million, it said.
   During the February-April period the dollar reached a high of
1.9025 marks and 133.50 yen. The dollar has risen even further
lately, trading around 1.98 marks and 142 yen.
   The dollar reached its highest point of the decade in February
1985. It declined slightly until September 1985, when G-7 leaders
agreed to lower its value to help narrow the U.S. trade gap and
stave off protectionist sentiment in Congress.
   The dollar touched bottom in the final days of 1987 before
rebounding sharply at the beginning of 1988.

<HEAD>Consumer Borrowing Slows During April, Another Sign of Economic Slowdown</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NANCY BENAC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans took out $2.73 billion more in
consumer debt than they retired in April, a sharp slowing of the
borrowing pace of earlier months, the government reported.
   The Federal Reserve Board said Wednesday that consumer credit in
April rose 4.7 percent on a seasonally adjusted annual rate, down
from 6.4 percent in March and 9.5 percent in February.
   April's increase was the slowest advance since a 3.5 percent gain
last September and was a sharp retreat from the 8.5 percent rise in
consumer debt during all of 1988.
   The report also reflected a sharp downward revision in the level
of consumer borrowing in March, which originally was estimated to
have grown at a 9.4 percent annual rate.
   Economist Sandra Shaber of the Futures Group in Washington said
the report was consistent with a host of other signs that economic
growth is slowing as the record peacetime expansion extends into its
seventh year.
   ``We've been seeing for a very long time a great deal of caution
in consumer borrowing, to the point that debt outstanding is
begininng to fall behind the growth in personal income,'' Ms. Shaber
said.
   That Americans have kept their borrowing under control so far
this year could bode well for healthy consumer spending as the year
progresses, she said.
   Consumer spending is closely watched as a barometer of the
economy's health because it represents two-thirds of overall
economic activity.
   April's slowdown in borrowing occurred even though automobile
loans increased at a 3.1 percent annual rate, rising by $752
million, after declining by 0.1 percent in March.
   Auto sales, which have been weak so far this year, picked up
somewhat in April as carmakers launched a new round of incentives to
lure shoppers back into showrooms.
   The economy has been slowing in recent months in response to a
15-month campaign by the Federal Reserve to fight inflation by
pushing up interest rates and restraining economic growth. Signs
emerged this week that the Fed has begun to ease its grip on the
money supply.
   April's consumer credit report revealed a sharp falloff in
borrowing in the category of debt that includes credit cards.
Revolving credit increased by $1.77 billion in April, an 11.6
percent annual rate of growth, compared with a 27.2 percent spurt in
March.
   Bank and credit union loans not secured by real estate increased
by $392 million in April, a 2.4 percent annual rate of advance, down
from a 9.3 percent rate of growth in March.
   The various changes left total consumer debt in April at a
seasonally adjusted $693.82 billion.

<HEAD>Coniston Wins TW Services Fight With $1.65 Billion Bid</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOYCE M. ROSENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Coniston Partners, which won TW Services Inc.
after a bitter 9-month-long fight, said it will retain the company's
core food service segments but sell off some of its other businesses.
   TW, which had repeatedly rejected Coniston's advances and tried
to thwart the investor group with a variety of defenses, said
Wednesday it had accepted the partnership's sweetened $1.65 billion
offer.
   ``I think that in the end they realized we were determined to buy
the company or at least determined to see it (the takeover battle)
to the end,'' said Augustus Oliver, a Coniston principal.
   The $34-per-share agreement marks the latest victory for
Coniston, which has reaped big profits by acquiring stakes in
companies, mounting or threatening to mount a takeover bid and later
selling its shares back to the company or a rival bidder.
   TW stock rose 25 cents a share to $33 in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading Wednesday.
   Management of TW Services _ whose holdings include thousands of
Denny's and Hardee's restaurants _ was reticent about the deal,
which suggested their decision to accept Coniston's latest offer was
a reluctant one.
   ``The only comment is that management and their directors have
worked hard to bring shareholders value and feel that shareholders
are getting a fair price for our stock,'' said James Ryan, a TW
spokesman.
   Coniston also said it planned to replace TW Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer Frank Salizzoni. Oliver said Jerome Richardson,
now TW's president, was expected to become the new chief executive.
   Salizzoni was not in his office Wednesday when a reporter called
for comment.
   Oliver said Coniston would retain the 1,220-restaurant Denny's
chain; Spartan Food Systems Inc., the largest franchisee of Hardee's
fast-food restaurants; and Canteen, which provides food services to
such corporations and clients as the National Park Service and
Yankee Stadium.
   However, Oliver said in a telephone interview, American Medical
Services, TW's nursing home business, and other minor divisions
would be sold.
   Under the sweetened offer, scheduled to expire July 5, Coniston
affiliate SWT Associates LP will pay $34 in cash for 61 percent of
TW's 48.5 million outstanding shares.
   That would give Coniston, which owns 19 percent of TW's stock, 80
percent of the company's shares. After the offer expires, holders of
the remaining 20 percent of TW stock would be given the choice of
receiving $34 in cash, or $30 and one share of stock in the
surviving company.
   Coniston had offered $29 a share, or about $1.4 billion, for TW.
   Oliver said Coniston had financing commitments from Citibank and
Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities Corp. to complete the tender
offer.
   Coniston first approached TW last September. TW consistently
rejected the bid as inadequate and said it would deploy its ``poison
pill'' takeover defense against Coniston.
   Poison pills drive up the cost of hostile takeovers by allowing
target companies to issue additional stock.
   Coniston sought unsuccessfully to have the pill invalidated by
state courts in Delaware, where TW is incorporated.
   Coniston also planned to wage a proxy fight to elect three
candidates to TW's 11-member board, a move the company attempted to
thwart by postponing its annual meeting.
   Despite the obstacles thrown up by TW, Coniston refused to back
down.
   On Tuesday, TW said its board was reviewing proposals to buy the
company or its units. Ryan, the TW spokesman, said the board would
not reveal who the other bidders may have been or the amount of
their offers.
   TW had earnings of $66.9 million in 1988 on revenue of $3.6
billion.
   Coniston failed to win a proxy fight to force a sale of Gillette
Co. last year, although the company later agreed to a stock buyback.
In 1987, the firm helped force the restructuring of Allegis Corp.,
which was renamed UAL Inc., by acquiring a large stake and
threatening to mount a takeover.

<HEAD>Appears Willingness to Compromise on Capital Gains Tax Reduction</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: also on general news wires.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of the House Ways and Means
Committee said he would consider accepting lower capital gains tax
rates as a revenue-raising measure.
   ``I haven't seen a way'' to raise revenue in the next fiscal year
without a capital gains rate cut, Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill.,
told The New York Times in an interview published today.
   He said that with President Bush's opposition to new taxes, ``The
only thing that seems negotiable is capital gains.''
   Rostenkowski has long opposed Bush's proposal to reduce the
capital gains rate _ currently the same as the income tax rate on
ordinary income _ to 15 percent.
   In Washington, a committee aide who spoke on condition of
anonymity said Wednesday night that Rostenkowski had not changed his
opposition to a reduction.
   But in an interview published today in The Wall Street Journal,
Rostenkowski said: ``Let the process begin. ... Everything is on the
table.''
   Rostenskowski recognizes that Bush, who campaigned on a slogan of
``read my lips _ no new taxes,'' and a majority of committee
Republicans are going to have to accept any revenue compromise, the
aide said.
   ``Proponents of capital gains reduction have a real leg up'' in
such a situation, the aide said, because of the recognition on all
sides that any change, up or down, in capital gains rates yields a
revenue increase in the first year.
   Capital gains are the increases in value of any assets, such as
stocks. A tax rate increase captures a bigger slice of the proceeds
of asset sales that would be made in any case; a rate decrease
stimulates more sales and brings in more government revenue that way.
   Economists disagree over what happens after the first year. Bush
argues that there are permanently more transactions with lower rates
than they would otherwise be; Rostenkowski and others argue that
this is not so and people selling stock would get an unjustified tax
break.
   Additionally, opponents of lower rates say that stock trading is
done by people of high incomes and benefits of those rates are not
available to those living on modest salaries.
   The Ways and Means Committee is under instructions from the
Budget Committee to come up with an additional $5.3 billion in
revenue for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1. The Joint Taxation
Committee estimated that a cut in rates to 15 percent as proposed by
Bush would yield $3.5 billion in the first year though it would
reduce revenue after that; the Office of Management and Budget
estimated the first-year gain at $4.2 billion.
   Though often in recent years capital gains have been taxed a
separately stated rates, currently gains are treated like all other
income. The top current federal income tax rate is 33 percent.

   The Rancho Seco nuclear power plant has
ceased producing electricity amid predictions from public interest
groups that the shutdown called for by voters would inspire similar
actions across the nation.
   Operators began shutting down the plant Wednesday after voters
became the first in the nation to say that a working reactor should
be closed.
   The vote was not binding on the Sacramento Municipal Utility
District, which owns the problem-plagued, 15-year-old plant, but a
majority of its five elected board members had promised to abide by
the will of the people.
   The plant stopped producing electricity Wednesday morning, but
the process of shutting down the reactor in the 913-megawatt plant
was expected to be take up to 72 hours, said Rancho Seco spokeswoman
Karen Wilson.
   The utility district said mothballing or dismantling the plant
will take several years and could cost more than $300 million.
   ``Basically, we will be plowing new ground,'' said Jim Shetler,
Rancho Seco assistant manager. ``Total decommissioning has not been
done on this level before, and we won't have a lot to draw on.''
   Critics claimed the plant, 25 miles southeast of Sacramento, was
unsafe and had a poor operating record. Tuesday's vote was 111,867
or 53.4 percent against continued operation, and 97,460 or 46.6
percent for continued operation.
   ``It will be essentially a shot heard around the world. Citizens
are going to know they can take on city hall and win,'' said Scott
Denman, director of the Safe Energy Communication Council, a
Washington-based coalition of environmental and public interest
organizations against nuclear power.
   Public Citizen, a group formed in 1971 by Ralph Nader, said in a
statement that the vote ``marks the beginning of the end for nuclear
power in the United States. ... America's love affair with the atom
is over.''

   Potential brake or rear suspension problems
prompted Ford Motor Co. to recall about 119,000 of its Mercury
Cougar and Ford Thunderbird cars, including the winner of a
magazine's prestigious ``Car of the Year'' award.
   In announcing the recall Wednesday, Ford said it knew of no
accidents or injuries because of the problems.
   Spokesman Mike Parris said all of the cars were assembled at
Ford's plant in Lorain, Ohio, between October 1988 and March 1989.
Between 5 percent and 10 percent of them were Thunderbird Super
Coupes.
   Of all those recalled, about 11,250 Thunderbirds and Cougars also
will be checked for a part which, if left in place for a number of
miles, could cause the rear suspension to fall apart.
   Motor Trend magazine gave its ``Car of the Year'' award to the
Thunderbird SC in January. The car has had other problems since its
formal introduction in December 1988, but Wednesday's action was the
first recall involving the Super Coupe.
   Ford said that during a full turn at less than 5 mph, part of the
front suspension of all the Cougars and Thunderbirds made during the
five-month period could hit part of the brake mechanism.
   That would cause an increase in pedal travel the next time the
brakes were applied, decreasing effectiveness. Ford said the problem
could be repeated during the next low-speed, full-turn brake
application.
   Also involved in recall were about 11,250 Thunderbirds and
Cougars made in mid-January. The company said 133 rear-suspension
knuckles were heated improperly by a supplier, which could result in
cracks and failure of the suspension.
   It wasn't clear how many cars received knuckles from the bad
batch, Parris said. A suspension knuckle is an arm that attaches the
wheel assembly to the frame.
   The company said it was unaware of any injuries or accidents
because of either problem. Inspections and repairs will be performed
free, the company said.
   The Thunderbird SC, which stands for Super Coupe, has had other
problems since production began last year.
   Ford withheld dealer deliveries of many of the cars late last
year and early this year so it could replace a cast-iron crankshaft
with a forged one. Crankshafts change the up-and-down motion of the
pistons to rotary motion that goes to wheels.
   The crankshafts were replaced in the Super Coupe and the Cougar
XR7.
   In February, the company said it had completed replacing an
engine mounting bolt in about 10,600 of all versions of the
Thunderbird and Cougar which never got to dealers.

<HEAD>Goodyear Withdraws From South Africa</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AKRON, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. is withdrawing from
South Africa with the sale of a tire and general products
subsidiary, citing U.S. sanctions and a devalued South African
currency.
   The sale of Goodyear's Uitenhage, South Africa, operations to
Consol Ltd. an industrial subsidiary of the South African financial,
industrial and mining group Anglovall Ltd., was announced Wednesday
and is subject to government approvals.
   Consol said the purchase price was about $65 million.
   Goodyear said the sale would result in a one-time charge of about
$44 million after taxes, or 77 cents per share, to be recorded in
the second quarter results, and after-tax proceeds from the sale are
expected to total about $45 million.
   Goodyear said most of the charge would result from the
recognition of a decreased value of its assets in South Africa
related to the devaluation of the South African currency in recent
years amid racial turmoil.
   ``While we will regret leaving South Africa after providing jobs
and livelihood there for 42 years, it is becoming increasingly
difficult for American companies to obtain adequate returns on
investments there,'' said Goodyear Chairman Tom H. Barrett.
   He added that the withdrawal also was prompted by U.S. sanctions,
including a double U.S. tax on South African earnings.
   Goodyear has described Anglovall as ``a responsible group that
has demonstrated concern for human rights in the work place and has
expressed intent to retain the current work force of 2,400 people,''
most of whom are non-white.
   Basil Hersov, chairman of Anglovall, has been on the
Goodyear-South Africa board for 23 years.

   Stock prices were sharply higher at midday Thursday
as several favorable factors provoked some healthy buying by British
institutions.
   Prompted by a steady pound and a rise on Wall Street,
institutions entered the market in force after remaining largely on
the sidelines in previous sessions, dealers said.
   Share prices advanced across a broad front, with special
situations and takeover speculation provoking strong rises in
selected blue chip issues.
   At midday, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was
up 36.1 points, or 1.7 percent, at 2,154.0, the day's best level.
   Volume was a healthy 296.4 million shares, compared with 261.3
million shares at the same time Wednesday.

<HEAD>Metropolitan Buys J.C. Penney Casualty Insurance</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUG FISHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARWICK, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Retailing giant J.C. Penney Co. Inc. will
pull out of the property and casualty insurance business by selling
its Ohio-based subsidiary to Metropolitan Property and Casualty
Insurance Co. for an undisclosed price.
   Penney would keep its life insurance subsidiary, spokesman J.
Duncan Muir said from the retailer's Texas headquarters. Unlike
rival Sears, Penney had been unable to produce a satisfactory
package of financial services that it could sell through its stores,
Muir said.
   ``The direction of our company is to become a department store.
We found that people did not choose to make financial decisions at
the same time they were shopping for apparel,'' he said. ``We tried
other things to make a complete financial package, and it just
didn't work for us.''
   Metropolitan, a subsidiary of Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. of
New York, probably would keep Penney's over-the-counter insurance
sales force in place for up to 18 months after the expected closing
of the sale later this summer, spokeswoman Liz Ostrowski said.
   Those operations eventually would be folded into Metropolitan's
existing sales force of agents, direct-marketing specialists and
Century 21 real estate agents, she said.
   Less certain was the future of 770 employees at J.C. Penney
Casualty Insurance Co. headquarters in Westerville, Ohio, near
Columbus. Metropolitan would keep a service center there, but
staffing levels had not been decided, Ms. Ostrowski said.
   ``We're going to provide all employees with opportunities to
continue'' with Metropolitan, she said.
   Metropolitan, which writes most of its business in the Northeast,
wants to expand to the Midwest and South, Ms. Ostrowski said. Penney
wrote nearly half its premiums in 1987 in Ohio and California, with
other significant amounts in Pennsylvania and Georgia, according to
A.M. Best Co., an industry rating service.
   Penney Casualty lost $7 million on premiums of $168 million last
year, about 80 percent of it in auto insurance, Muir said. It had
approximately 350,000 policies in force.
   Metropolitan Property and Casualty earned $40 million on premium
income of $543 million. It had 1.1 million policies, Ms. Ostrowski
said.
   Best gave Penney a B-plus rating last year, which one expert said
is generally the lowest rating accepted by insurance brokers.
Metropolitan improved from B-plus to A-minus.

<TEXT>
   Bowing to complaints from viewers, Black Flag
will no longer play taps for ants and roaches in one of its
insect-spray commercials.
   Carol Emerling, a spokeswoman for American Home Products Corp. of
New York, makers of Black Flag insecticides, said Wednesday the few
notes of the military bugle call at the end of the ad will be
deleted within about two weeks.
   ``We had some people call it to our attention, and when that
happens, we look at it again,'' she said.
   Among those who complained was Korean War veteran Bill Temple of
Bryn Mawr.
   ``Taps is a symbol,'' he said. ``It represents the finality of
someone's incredible sacrifice. To trivialize it by playing it after
blasting a bunch of ants and roaches away is terrible.''
   Ms. Emerling wouldn't say who had prepared the commercial or how
many complaints it drew.
   Temple was behind a drive to build a national Korean War memorial
and another to change a 1986 Clint Eastwood film to reflect that the
Army, not the Marines, fought at Heartbreak Ridge, one of the
bloodiest battles in the Korean War.
   ``I lost an awful lot of buddies during that time I was in
combat,'' he said. ``I know what taps means to the people who lost
friends and relatives.''

<HEAD>Rostenkowski Asking Congress to Kill Tax Break</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: also on general news wires.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, chairman of the House
Ways and Means Committee, is asking Congress to kill a tax break for
Employee Stock Ownership Plans on grounds it has been abused by
lenders.
   Rostenkowski, D-Ill., introduced a bill Wednesday to repeal a
1984 provision that allows banks and other lenders to escape taxes
on half the income from loans made to such plans, known as ESOPs.
   ``Once again, we have witnessed a special tax benefit provision
become an abusive loophole through the ingenuity of Wall Street
investment bankers,'' Rostenkowski said Wednesday. ``Congress did
not intend for this special tax provision to be used in such an
excessive manner.''
   ESOPs were given preferential treatment under federal tax law to
make it easier for employees to buy stock in the companies for which
they work. In many cases, ESOPs have been used to keep alive
employers threatened by bankruptcy.
   The government estimates that 10 million workers are covered by
about 10,000 ESOPs.
   Rostenkowski said there is evidence that many companies are
borrowing to set up ESOPs only to obtain a tax benefit while
providing nothing new for employees.
   He noted a week-old Internal Revenue Service ruling that
authorized public sale of bonds issued by ESOPs. That ruling,
Rostenkowski said, will produce even more ESOP borrowing.
   He estimated the tax preference for ESOPs will cost the treasury
$8 billion in lost revenues over five years.

   The stock market headed higher today, extending
its recent rally fueled by takeover news and rumors and declining
interest rates.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 3.49 to 2,515.81 in
the first half hour of trading.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 4 to 3 in

   New takeover bids this week for Time Inc. and LIN Broadcasting
touched off buying in a wide range of stocks thought to be possible
future candidates for acquisitions or buyouts.
   Eastman Kodak, said to be a potential target, led the active list
and rose { to 51.
   Time stock, meanwhile, dipped 2 to 168 and LIN slipped 1} to 127}
after both experienced dramatic runups in Wednesday's trading.
   Beyond the takeover hubbub, analysts say the market has benefited
from signs this week that the Federal Reserve might be starting a
change of course in its credit policy.
   After more than a year of tightening credit conditions, the Fed
is widely believed to have made an initial step toward easing, by

   McCaw Cellular Communications Inc. today
began its $5.85 billion tender offer for the shares of LIN
Broadcasting Corp. it does not already own.
   The $120 a share offer, which will expire on July 6 unless
extended, requires among other conditions approval from the Federal
Communications Commission. In a news release, McCaw stated such
approval could take six months.
   Shares of both companies edged lower in early trading today, LIN
was down $1.75 to $127.75 a share and McCaw dipped 75 cents to
$46.25 in national over-the-counter trading.
   On Wednesday, a day after McCaw announced its bid for the New
York-based cellular phone, television and publishing company, LIN
stock soared $26 a share to $129.50 in over-the-counter trading and
McCaw stock rose $3.75 to $47 a share.
   But the bid had a broad spinoff effect on the stock prices of
other companies involved in the cellular telephone business.
Officials at rival companies said the bid created a new benchmark
for the value of their cellular properties.
   ``We certainly see this as an important announcement,'' said
Diane Olberg of Pacific Telesis Group in San Francisco.
   On the New York Stock Exchange, Pacific Telesis rose $1.12{ to
$42 and Southwestern Bell Corp. of St. Louis rose $1 to $53.87{.
Cellular operations are a small part of those companies' revenue.
   By acquiring LIN, McCaw would have twice the potential cellular
market of Pacific Telesis and Southwestern Bell, its closest
competitors.
   Combining both sets of franchises would form the ``regional
supersystem'' of cellular holdings that McCaw has been seeking, said
analyst Geoffrey Johnson of Argus Research Corp. in New York.
   Cellular franchises have grown in popularity with improvements in
technology and customer demand for mobile phones.
   Johnson said a battle for LIN's stock was likely.
   ``The market is obviously anticipating a bidding war erupting,''
he said.
   Spokespersons for Pacific Telesis and Southwestern Bell refused
to comment on whether their companies are interested in LIN,
although analysts have cited both as possible suitors.
   McCaw spokesman Steven Bruce declined to say whether the company
might raise its offer. He would only say that ``the offer is on the
table.''
   LIN, which said it was studying the offer, has interests in
cellular systems serving New York, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Dallas
and Houston, in addition to owning seven network-affiliated
television stations and a specialty publishing house that produces
hardcover tourist guides for hotel rooms.
   McCaw, LIN's largest shareholder, has franchises serving
customers in Seattle, San Francisco, Miami, Denver, Minneapolis and
Portland, Ore.
   LIN's rights in five of the nation's top 10 markets ``would fit
in very nicely'' with McCaw's small- to medium-sized properties,
Johnson said.
   Details on how the deal would be structured will be announced
before the end of the week, Bruce said.
   Analysts estimated McCaw has amassed close to $3 billion for the
acquisition, including $1.5 billion through the sale of a 22 percent
interest to British Telecommunications PLC, a $1.3 billion line of
credit and $800 million in cash.
   A source close to McCaw who asked not to be identified confirmed
the company had put together around $3 billion.
   McCaw's offer values LIN at about $6.5 billion. But since McCaw
already owns 9.8 percent of LIN, it would cost $5.85 billion to
acquire the remaining shares.
   Two weeks ago, LIN announced its board had approved in principle
spinning off a new subsidiary that would own its TV stations. It
said it would operate its cellular operations and publishing
business as a separate company.
   LIN said the move was made for operating and strategic reasons
and was ``not intended as a precursor to any other corporate
transaction.''
   McCaw's cellular telephone systems serve 50 million ``pops,'' an
industry measure that refers to market-area population multiplied by
percentage ownership in the cellular systems serving those areas.
   LIN has more than 18 million pops, while Pacific Telesis and
Southwestern Bell each have about 30 million.
   At $6.5 billion, McCaw would be paying about $360 per pop. As
recently as 1986, McCaw was buying franchises for $6 per pop.

<HEAD>EEC Ready To Negotiate 10-Year Pact With Soviet Union</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A top EEC official said Thursday the
trade bloc is ready to negotiate an ``ambitious'' 10-year trade and
cooperation agreement with the Soviet Union.
   In a speech to a conference in Moscow, External Relations
Commissioner of the 12-nation European Economic Community Frans
Andriessen said formal negotiations on a pact could start before
August.
   ``It will be an ambitious agreement covering trade, commercial
and economic cooperation whose scope matches the importance of the
two parties,'' Andriessen said. Copies of the speech were made
available in Brussels.
   EEC foreign affairs ministers are to discuss on Monday proposals
for a mandate to start negotiations with the Soviet Union.
   Trade with the EEC currently accounts for 11 percent of the
Soviet Union's imports and 14 percent of its exports, while the
EEC's exports to the Soviet Union account for only 3 percent of its
total.
   Andriessen said exchanges between the two should grow in the
1990s.
   He indicated the EEC would not offer any trade concessions to the
Soviet Union, saying that the accord would include ``most favored
nation'' treatment under international trade rules established by
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
   The agreement also would offer management training, joint
ventures and ``other forms of business cooperation,'' Andriessen
said.
   The EEC has signed bilateral trade agreements with Hungary and
Czechoslovakia and is in advanced talks for accords with Poland and
Bulgaria.

   From the Mozart-playing string quartet at
LaGuardia Airport to the miniature bottles of champagne handed out
in flight, Donald Trump didn't spare the glitter in launching his
new Northeast shuttle airline today.
   The New York-to-Washington flight of the Trump Shuttle was one of
the inaugural flights for the service that Trump acquired from
strikebound Eastern Airlines.
   Trump wasn't able to meet his advertised claim for getting the
flights off on time _ the scheduled 8 a.m. flight from LaGuardia to
Washington took off at about 8:17 a.m., while another flight from
Washington to New York was delayed by weather and heavy traffic _
but he did live up to his reputation for hoopla.
   At LaGuardia, a string quartet played Mozart near a buffet
crammed with mimosas and muffins. During the flight, which was
packed with reporters and regular travelers, attendants dressed in
new navy-and-burgundy uniforms handed out miniature bottles of
champagne.
   ``The name `Trump' carries a lot of weight,'' said flight
attendant Denise McCain, 33, an 11-year Eastern veteran. ``We're all
very excited about it.''
   At one point the billionaire businessman, who sat in the front
row with Trump Shuttle President Bruce Nobles, grabbed the public
address microphone to announce, ``Ladies and gentlemen, this is your
flight attendant.''
   Passengers arriving at Washington's National Airport were met by
a strings and accordion quintet, whose statuesque, blond violin
player mugged with Trump for photographers.
   The shuttle's rebirth had been trumpted for days by newspaper and
radio ads, touting Trump's plans to rejuvenate the business that had
been Eastern's only profitable enterprise before the company was
crippled by a strike that began March 4.
   Trump formally closed the deal in a signing ceremony at his
opulent Plaza Hotel, buying the shuttle from strikebound Eastern
Airlines for $365 million.
   The real estate and casino tycoon, with trademark bravado,
pledged to make the Trump Shuttle ``the best transportation system
in the world.''
   ``I want the shuttle to be a diamond,'' Trump said. He promised
to spend as much as $2 million on each plane for refurbishing,
safety checks and painting of the new color scheme: white fuselage
with red, black and gold stripes, the name ``Trump'' above the
stripes and a red ``T'' on the tail.
   Trump, who will function as chairman and chief executive officer,
called it ``the largest scheduled airline startup in U.S. airline
history,'' with 21 Boeing 727 jets and more than 1,000 employees.
Many of the pilots, flight attendants and mechanics worked for
Eastern before the strike and were tentatively hired by Trump
starting last fall.
   The shuttle, which links New York with Washington and Boston, is
used mainly by business travelers. It was Eastern's only consistent
profit maker before the March 4 strike. Miami-based Eastern filed
for bankruptcy protection from creditors on March 9.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland formally approved the
sale to Trump on May 25, after America West Airlines withdrew its
rival $415 million buyout proposal because of failure to arrange
financing.
   The Eastern shuttle lost many passengers to Pan Am Corp.'s rival
service because of the strike and now has less than a 25 percent
market share.
   Full-page ads for the Trump Shuttle in The New York Times, the
Washington Post and other East Coast papers Wednesday blared the
message in giant letters: ``Starting Tomorrow, Business Travel Will
Be Back on Schedule.''
   The ads, as well as a similar radio version, announced that the
Trump Shuttle will begin service at precisely 7 a.m. EDT today.
   ``Which means that now, you can go back to the time you prefer
traveling _ on the hour,'' the newspaper ads read. ``What's more,
when we say on the hour, we mean on the hour. Seven a.m. does not
mean 7:01 a.m.'' Like Eastern did, Trump promises to roll out
another plane if the first one for a given hour is full.
   Pan Am's shuttle offers flights leaving on the half-hour.
   Not to be outdone, Pan Am launched the ``Corporate Jet Game,'' a
sweepstakes for passengers. The grand prize is free use of a 727 to
fly the winner and 25 guests to a weekend trip in Bermuda.
   ``We think that we can out-Trump Mr. Trump,'' said Pan Am
spokesman Jeff Kriendler. ``The battle will be won on service
considerations.''

<HEAD>OPEC Reaches Agreement to Keep Prices Strong, But Kuwait Not Firm</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDS: New throughout to UPDATE with comments from news conference,
edits throughout, no pickup.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALLY JACOBSEN</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Kuwait today confirmed it would refuse to
obey the new production limits approved just a day earlier by the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
   Ali Khalifa al-Sabah told reporters Kuwait has temporarily pulled
out of the OPEC quota system because the cartel failed to increase
Kuwait's share of total production in the last half of the year.
   But he insisted, ``We will use that freedom (from the quota
system) very, very responsibly.''
   The new agreement was designed to keep a firm grip on production
in order to keep prices strong. Oil markets initially reacted with
skepticsm to the cartel's ability to restrain output, but U.S. crude
prices appeared to stabilize somewhat today.
   Sabah said Kuwait intended to produce 1.35 million barrels a day
in the coming months, compared to its quota of 1.09 million barrels.
Its current production is estimated at 1.6 million barrels a day or
more.
   Other ministers appeared to accept Kuwait's position. Saudi
Arabia's Hisham Nazer indicated that Kuwait's extra sales would be
tolerated as long as they did not exceed 1.35 million barrels a day.
   After six days of bargaining, the cartel agreed to boost its
output ceiling to 19.5 million barrels a day in the July-December
period, up a million barrels from the current level.
   They agreed to divide up the extra sales proportionately among
all members.
   To meet the new ceiling, some of the countries will have to cut
their production. Analysts estimate output has picked up in recent
weeks to 21 million barrels a day.
   Nazer said he would have liked the production cap set at 20
million barrels a day in the second half of the year, but he said
several producers were worried a higher ceiling might have an impact
on prices.
   The ministers agreed to meet again in September and decide
whether to boost their output to 20 million barrels a day, beginning
Oct. 1.
   The cartel has been pumping an estimated 21 million barrels a day
in recent weeks, analysts say. So the producing nations would have
to turn down their taps to meet the new supply level.
   ``Everybody is supposed to rein in production levels (to their
assigned quota),'' said OPEC President Rilwanu Lukman.
   The members also decided to keep their benchmark price at $18 a
barrel, about the current price of a basket of crudes monitored by
OPEC.
   Paul Mlotok, head of energy research at Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. in
New York, said the new arrangement should not ``have a signficant
impact on gasoline prices at the pump.''
   Production cutbacks made early in the year by the cartel have
sent U.S. gasoline prices soaring.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, futures prices for West
Texas Intermediate, the American benchmark crude, closed down 79
cents to $19.67 a barrel on Wednesday, but the near-term contract
was up 5 cents at midday.
   Mlotok said prices fell because the markets figured the nations
would continue producing at the present pace.
   ``Current (output) levels,'' he said, ``are a bit high to support
a price over $20 ... so they took the price down about a dollar.''
   In reaching an agreement, the organization rejected demands by
Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates and others for a bigger share of
the pie.
   Kuwait's insistence on a larger chunk caused talks to break down
Tuesday.
   In pressing for a greater share of the increase, Kuwait was
pitted against influential Saudi Arabia, the world's largest crude
exporter.
   Saudi Arabia's Nazer wanted the increase shared on a pro-rata
basis among all members.
   ``If it is found that the demand warrants an increase in the
ceiling, then this can be raised to 20 million barrels per day or
any other level agreed upon,'' said a statement released by the
ministers. Any adjustments would be made Oct. 1.
   Prices have been much stronger than expected due to OPEC cutbacks
earlier in the year and accidents in key oil-producing regions
restricting supply.
   The average price of a basket of seven crudes monitored by the
cartel exceeded the $18 reference earlier in the year.
   With the recent pickup in OPEC production, prices have eased some
but are still more than 40 percent higher than late last November.
   The ministers' statement said they intend to talk to independent
producing nations ``with a view to soliciting their cooperation in
support of market stability.''
   Some of those countries agreed earlier in the year to curtail
their output to help bolster prices.
   OPEC's members are: Algeria, Ecuador, Gabon, Indonesia, Iran,
Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, U.A.E. and
Venezuela.

<HEAD>Wheat Price Firm Despite China Turmoil</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures opened mixed this
morning on the Chicago Board of Trade despite the continued concern
over conditions in China.
   Early trading indicates wheat prices are firming, although
analysts say traders are worried about delays in the shipment of
wheat on order by the Chinese. But the market is largely ignoring
the turmoil still evident in that nation and the possible impact it
could have on future grain sales.
   Favorable weather outlooks are expected to put pressure on corn

   However, soybean futures could get a boost from a threatened
sales boycott by Brazilian farmers who say they are worried about
their government's exchange rate policy. In addition, dockworkers in
Brazil are threatening another nationwide port strike, which would
hamper that soybean exports.
   A strike by dockworkers last month shut down most Brazilian ports.

to 8 cents higher with July at $7.19 a bushel.
   Livestock prices were mostly lower and meat futures were mixed in
early trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .33 cent lower to .23 cent higher with June at
69.05 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .15 cent lower to .13 cent
higher with August at 78.87 cents a pound; hogs were .05 cent to .18

   Time Inc. and Warner Communciations Inc. have an
array of options to protect their planned merger deal despite
Paramount Communications Inc.'s $10.7 billion buyout offer for Time.
   Securities analysts expressed little doubt that Time would resist
the unsolicited tender offer that Paramount launched only 2{ weeks
before shareholders are to vote on the Time-Warner merger that would
create the world's largest media and entertainment concern.
   Top executives of both Time and Warner were said to be
unavailable Wednesday for comment on what course they intend to take.
   Peter Appert, media analyst at C.J. Lawrence, Morgan Grenfell
Inc., said he expects Time officials ``will be pretty tough about
trying to retain their independence.''
   Paramount, the entertainment and publishing concern formerly
called Gulf &amp; Western Inc., said late Tuesday it was launching a
tender offer of $175 in cash for each of Time's shares.
   That bid prompted heavy trading Wednesday in the stock of all
three companies. Time jumped $44 to close at $170 a share in
consolidated New York Stock Exchange trading, while Warner rose
$1.75 to $53.50 a share and Paramount rose 75 cents to $54.75 a
share.
   At mid-day today, Time was down $2.75 to $167.75, Warner was up
$1.12{ at $54.62{ and Paramount ws up $2.12{ at $56.87{.
   Among the options securities analysts said Time was likely to be
considering were making its own tender offer for Warner or turning
the tables on Paramount by making a ``Pac-Man'' takeover bid for the
uninvited suitor.
   Analysts said Time previously arranged a $5 billion line of
credit that could be used if a competing bidder emerged. The down
side is that a buyout would dilute Time's earnings by saddling it
with debt.
   They said Time could exercise of any of several takeover
defenses, including a ``poison-pill'' that would make stock
available to its shareholders at a bargain rate, making a hostile
takeover more expensive.
   Time and Warner also could buy stakes in each other under terms
of their merger plan, a move that would further dilute their stock
and make a takeover of either of them more costly.
   John Reidy, media analyst for Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., said
he doesn't think the Paramount offer necessarily dooms the
Time-Warner merger plan. But he said it is ``hard to envisage a
shareholder vote taking place in two weeks while the Paramount offer
is outstanding.''
   Warner and Time shareholders are scheduled to vote June 23 on the
merger.
   Paramount filed a lawsuit in Delaware Chancery Court seeking to
block Time and Warner from exercising contingency plans designed to
deter uninvited biddders from interfering with their merger. But a
judge declined Wednesday to immediately grant Paramount's requests.
   Also Wednesday, Warner said it had filed suit in New York State
Supreme Court against Citibank, seeking an order that would prevent
the bank from providing or arranging the $14 billion in financing
that Paramount said the bank plans to arrange for its bid. The sum
includes the cost of buying Time's shares, refinancing debt and
other costs.
   Warner said it had an agreement with Citibank under which the
bank had agreed not to help finance an unsolicted offer that would
interfere with the merger between Warner and Time.
   In a statement, Citibank's parent, Citicorp, said it was not
aware of ``any violation of any agreement with Warner.''
   Paramount Chairman Martin Davis met privately with securities
analysts Wednesday, saying that while the deal would result in
``significantly lower'' earnings in the near term, the chance to buy
Time was ``a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to maximize Paramount
Communication's long-term potential.''
   He told the analysts he has no plans to sell any assets.
   Time, a publishing and cable giant, may have a tough job
explaining to its shareholders how the proposed stock swap merger
with Warner would be a better deal than the $175 a share in cash
that Paramount is offering.
   Under the planned Time-Warner merger, Time shareholders would get
a share in the new company for each share they currently own while
Warner shareholders would get 0.465 share of the new company for
each Warner share.
   J. Kendrick Noble, media analyst for PaineWebber Inc., said he
estimated the combined company's stock would trade at about $110 a
share.
   But he said that figure is not strictly comparable with the $175
a share price Paramount is offering, because anyone taking that
offer would face a capital gains tax and would have to give up their
stock to boot.
   ``Some credit has to be give to the idea of continuing to be an
equity investor,'' he said.

<HEAD>Airbus Announces $810 Million In Orders For Stretched A320 Jet</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Airbus Industrie said Thursday that it has received
18 firm orders valued at roughly $810 million for a stretched
version of its A320 medium-range passenger jet.
   Jean Pierson, head of the European commercial aircraft
consortium, told reporters at the Paris Air Show that orders include
12 planes for the U.S.-based International Lease Finance Corp. and
six for the Egyptian state carrier Egyptair.
   The Airbus board gave preliminary approval to the stretched
aircraft three weeks ago. The new plane will be called the A321-100.
   Pierson said he was confident that Airbus will have the 40 firm
orders it needs to proceed with the aircraft, but a decision is not
expected until September. First deliveries of the new plane are
expected to start in 1994.
   Airbus is a consortium among Aerospatiale of France,
Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm GmbH of West Germany, British Aerospace
PLC and Construcciones Aeronauticas SA of Spain.
   Pierson said that Airbus, a major rival of U.S. manufacturers
Boeing and McDonnel Douglas in the multi-million dollar
international commercial aircraft market, has booked orders for 200
aircraft since the beginning of this year, compared with 167 for all
of 1988.
   ``Our goal of 400 orders by the end of 1989 is achievable,'' he
said, adding that this would represent about $20 billions in new
orders.

   The stock market showed a small gain today,

   American businesses plan a strong 6.5 percent
increase in plant and equipment spending this year, the government
said Thursday, and economists said the investments would help
economic expansion while tending to limit inflation.
   Analysts said much of the spending will involve equipment that
would permit businesses to modernize their production capabilities,
thereby reducing both costs and prices.
   According to the Commerce Department survey, completed in May,
business investment is now estimated at $451.43 billion for 1989, up
from $423.69 billion in 1988. The numbers are adjusted for inflation.
   Although the economy has been slowing this year, business
spending plans have been expanding.
   In an initial survey completed last December, businesses told the
department they planned a 5.9 percent increase in expansion and
modernization spending this year. A survey completed in March showed
the forecast rising to 6.3 percent.
   ``Just about all of the increase is projected in equipment rather
than physical plants,'' according to Irwin Kellner, chief economist
for Manufacturers Hanover in New York.
   ``This is good, in the sense that it shows that industry is aware
that it has to improve product quality and reduce input costs,'' he
said. ``To the extent that industry is more productive, it will hold
down inflation.''
   The Federal Reserve has been putting upward pressure on interest
rates for 15 months as it attempted to slow the economy and ease
inflation.
   The spending forecast suggests the slowdown is not about to turn
into recession.
   ``Basically this is a plus for the economy both in terms of
continued expansion and, over the longer time, helping relieve
pressure on capacity and therefore limit the extent that price
pressures will accelerate,'' said David M. Jones, chief economist
for Aubrey G. Lanston &amp; Co. in New York.
   Both Jones and Kellner said one drawback to the increased
spending is that much of the new equipment is expected to be
imported.
   ``So even as businesses become even more productive on the one
side,'' Kellner said, ``on the other, they're adding to the balance
of trade deficit.''
   But at the same time, Jones said, much of the spending to
increase capacity is to meet expanding orders for U.S. exports.
   Capital spending grew 10.1 percent in 1988 as companies rushed to
expand production to meet rising export demand.
   That was the sharpest increase since a 16.6 percent hike in 1984,
when businesses were still recovering from the 1981-82 recession.
Since then, spending fell 3.9 percent in 1986 but rose 2.3 percent
in 1987.
   Business investment in the manufacturing sector was forecast to
increase 3.6 percent to $170.54 billion this year, compared to a
12.8 percent rise in 1988. That includes a 1.4 percent hike in
industries producing durable goods, those expected to last three
years or more. Non-durable spending was expected to rise 5.7 percent.
   Non-manufacturing spending in such industries as mining and
transportation was seen rising 8.4 percent to $280.89 billion,
compared with last year's 8.4 percent increase.
   Before adjusting for inflation, 1989 plant and equipment spending
is expected to rise by 9.9 percent to $472.08 billion, down from
10.3 percent in 1988.

   Born in protest 54 years ago, the United Auto
Workers union today advocates constructive teamwork with company
bosses and it bargains contracts for professionals who range from
clerks to jai alai ballplayers.
   The 1 million member union is discovering, as have manufacturers
and other labor organizations, that peaceful coexistence and
diversification can be keys to survival.
   The transition has come at a price.
   The UAW is taking an increasingly active role in running
companies, from the board room to the factory floor. This has shaken
the workings of a labor organization that up to now has largely
avoided the factionalism plaguing some sister unions.
   As UAW members prepare for a convention later this month, their
agenda will include how to address a growing dissident movement that
claims the union has forgotten the lessons of history.
   During the past three years, the New Directions movement has
grown within the UAW urging the organization's leaders to honor the
axiom _ managers manage and workers work.
   New Directions leader Jerry Tucker says the union is getting too
chummy with management in developing team approaches to the job and
assisting with problem-solving on the plant floor.
   It goes deeper than that, he says.
   ``I've been trying to force a debate on fundamentals from the
start of this thing'' about five years ago, Tucker says. ``I'm
relentless in my pursuit of answers to why certain hallowed
principles have to be discarded. And if they have to be discarded in
favor of corporatist activity, what's in it for us?''
   Jobs, says UAW President Owen Bieber. As times change, so must
the union.
   That doesn't mean the UAW isn't prepared to fight companies. It's
been building up a strike fund, which now totals $740 million and
pays $100 a week and insurance coverage per worker during walkout.
   ``They came up with the slogan of New Directions,'' he says. ``I
must say that I fail to see that. I sort of equate them to George
Bush _ I don't know what that program is because nobody's explained
that program.''
   The drive of New Directions really isn't new at all, says David
Cole, director of the Office for the Study of Automotive
Transportation at the University of Michigan.
   ``New Directions, despite their name, is very much oriented to
the old ways,'' he says. The loosely knit group claims widespread
shop-level support but declines to estimate it in numbers.
   In one sense, labor specialists agree, the union will benefit
from the debate New Directions is forcing. The movement is by far
the most serious and most public challenge to the UAW leadership
since the union's founding in Flint, Mich., on Aug. 26, 1935.
   ``It's good for the union to have a debate,'' says David Bensman,
director of the graduate program in labor studies at Rutgers
University in New Brunswick, N.J. ``When you have people who are
critical, it forces or gives the leadership more incentive to
explain its policies to the members.''
   That debate comes as the union looks outside the automobile
industry for membership growth. The UAW has organized some state
workers in Michigan, university staff in New England and jai alai
players in Connecticut, Florida and Rhode Island.
   For years, it has represented aerospace, agricultural equipment
and clerical workers.
   Riki Lasa, a professional jai alai player and president of UAW
Local 8868, said his organization talked with other unions,
including the United Food and Commercial Workers and the Hotel and
Restaurant Employees, before deciding in June 1988 to affiliate with
the UAW.
   ``They spoke about the democracy within the union that we, the
players, make our decisions,'' Lasa says. The 500 players are
continuing a strike that began April 14, 1988 over claims that
management violated federal labor laws.
   The jai alai players are seeking their first contract with
management.
   The UAW also has been looking outside the auto industry in
advertising campaigns that have cost the union $20 million during
the 1980s.
   The most recent campaign, running in large media markets and
costing the union about $4 million, reminds Americans of labor's
role in building the economy and criticizes financiers to make quick
profits on takeovers.
   Some doubt the ad's effectiveness.
   ``They probably make the people who run them feel better,'' says
ad analyst James Dougherty of County Securities in New York.
   The UAW's outside recruiting success hasn't been matched in the
newest segment of the auto industry _ ``transplants'' from abroad.
   Japanese companies, and joint ventures between Japanese and U.S.
automakers, have been erecting carmaking plants in the United States
since 1982. Some now are expanding.
   The UAW has organized workers at the Mazda Motor Corp. plant in
Flat Rock, Mich., and two joint ventures _ the New United Motor
Manufacturing Inc. factory by General Motors Corp. and Toyota Motor
Corp., and the Chrysler-Mitsubishi Motors Corp. Diamond-Star Motors
Corp. plant in Bloomington, Ill.
   But workers in Toyota's Georgetown, Ky.; Honda Motor Corp.'s
Marysville, Ohio, and Nissan Motor Corp.'s Smyrna, Tenn., assembly
plants aren't unionized.
   ``Nobody will admit this,'' Bieber says, ``but there can't be any
secret as to why they located any of these plants out there in the
hinterlands. It's also no accident that most of the people who got
hired probably had their ancestry checked through at least three
generations to find out whether anyone ever belonged to a union or
not.
   ``We've had an extremely tough time in organizing, and Honda was
a good example,'' he said. In March 1986 in Marysville, on the eve
of a representation election, the UAW _ fearing defeat _ withdrew
its bid to unionize the workers.
   Harley Shaiken, a labor professor at the University of California
at San Diego, says worker boredom could help bring more transplants
into the union fold.
   ``I think they will be organized, I think when they will be
organized is hard to gauge,'' he says.
   In the late 1970s, the UAW had more than 1.5 million members.
Today, it stands at 1 million, a decline that is a trend in
organized labor. Union workers also have become more conservative,
partly because of the popularity of former President Reagan.
   ``Reagan had a tremendous hold on our membership,'' said former
UAW President Douglas Fraser, now a professor at Wayne State
University in Detroit.
   ``He was kind of a macho man and the blue-collar worker is sort
of a macho fellow and that had a great attraction for them.
   ``Also I think that some of our members thought that the union
leadership and the liberals were too caught up in equal rights, and
the other factor is that I believe that as their income increases
their values change.''
   The base hourly wage for an auto assembler is about $14.50 an
hour, among the highest of any U.S. factory worker today. When
health and other benefits are included, annual compensation is about
$37,000, more with overtime. Of that, workers pay the equivalent of
two hours pay per month in dues.

   Stock prices closed sharply higher in heavy trading
Thursday on the London Stock Exchange amid a favorable economic
background and some institutional buying.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index finished 25.5
points, or 1.2 percent, higher at 2,143.4.
   The index moved in positive territory throughout the day,
recording a minimum gain of 12.4 points shortly after the opening
and then surging as much as 36.6 points around midday.
   Volume was heavy, as 782.3 million shares changed hands. But much
of the turnover was concentrated in a handful of special situation
stocks. By comparison, volume was 481 million shares Wednesday.
   A steady pound and a recovery in long-term British government
bond prices, following last week's sell-off, provided a favorable
background for equity prices to move higher, dealers said.
   In addition, some institutions stepped in with selective buying.
Various takeover rumors also made the rounds, centering on some of
the market's larger capitalized companies, pushing up prices and
inflating turnover in selected stocks.

   Kuwait said Thursday it will pump extra
crude in the coming months in defiance of the latest OPEC production
accord, and other cartel members could follow suit.
   Just a day after an agreement was reached, Kuwaiti Oil Minister
Ali Khalifa al-Sabah said his country has temporarily withdrawn from
OPEC's quota system because other ministers failed to increase its
share of total production in the last half of the year.
   Other members of the 13-nation Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries appeared to accept Kuwait's decision to cheat on
the new agreement.
   In fact, the United Arab Emirates and a few others were
considered likely to ignore their output limits. They, too, wanted a
bigger share of the production pie.
   But Algeria's Sadek Boussena said, ``I think that all countries
have committed themselves to something. That's what's positive.''
   It was Kuwait's insistence on a higher share of increased
production that stalled negotiations for a new accord.
   Sabah said he wrote in the new agreement that he would not feel
bound by his new quota. But he also told reporters that Kuwait
``will use that freedom (from the quota system) very, very
responsibly.''
   In restraining supply in the past, he said, Kuwait has
``sacrificed more than the others for a very, very long time. ...
But there is a limit to what we can do.''
   Sabah said Kuwait intended to produce 1.35 million barrels a day
in the coming months, noting that it is ``almost physically
impossible'' to pump less than that in part because of commitments
to long-time customers. Kuwait's new new quota is 1.09 million
barrels, and its current supply is estimated at nearly 2 million
barrels.
   Saudi Arabia's Hisham Nazer indicated to a small group of
reporters that Kuwait's extra sales would be tolerated as long as
they did not exceed 1.35 million barrels a day.
   Indonesia's Ginandjar Kartasasmita noted Kuwait would have to
make cutbacks to come down to the promised level.
   ``The accord is even better than what we could have dreamed of,''
he said. ``This is the maximum that we could have.''
   After six days of bargaining, the cartel agreed to boost its
supply ceiling to 19.5 million barrels a day in the July-December
period. While that is up a million barrels from the current official
level, analysts estimated output in recent weeks has risen to 21
million barrels a day.
   The ministers agreed to divide the extra sales proportionately
among all members. To meet the new ceiling, some countries will have
to cut production.
   Nazer said he would have liked to see the ceiling upped to 20
million barrels a day in the last half of the year, but he noted
that ``several of the OPEC members were just afraid it may have an
impact on price.''
   The ministers said in a statement the ceiling could be raised to
20 million barrels a day or more, effective Oct. 1, if demand
remained strong.
   ``I honestly feel that demand in the market is much stronger,''
Nazer said.
   Boussena agreed, saying that if prices hold steady, ``there is no
reason not to add another 500,000 barrels a day'' to the cap.
   OPEC retained in the new agreement its benchmark price of $18 a
barrel. The average price of a basket of seven crudes monitored by
OPEC was nearly $17.70 a barrel last week.
   The new accord was designed to keep a firm grip on production so
that prices would remain robust. But oil markets reacted skeptically
to the cartel's ability to limit output. U.S. crude prices initially
tumbled but recovered somewhat on Thursday.
   OPEC members are: Algeria, Ecuador, Gabon, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq,
Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates
and Venezuella.

   Foreign businesses' confidence in China has been
shattered by the eruption of violence.
   ``It will take years to restore credibility,'' Jan VanDenBerg, an
economist at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., said Thursday in Tokyo.
   In Washington, the United States-China Business Council said
Thursday that commercial and economic relations between the
countries ``have been disrupted and could suffer long-term damage.''
   The business council said its members ``deplore the violent
suppression and wanton killing of pro-democracy demonstrators in
Beijing'' and said the countries should ``preserve the links between
us until they can again be expanded.''
   While some businesses away from Beijing continue to do business
as normal, many report they have been crippled by workers staying
home and expatriates leaving the country.
   Many companies that had been attracted by China's cheap labor and
huge potential market have been forced into a wait-and-see attitude,
hoping their investments will survive.
   Kumigai Gumi Co., a major Japanese construction company, has
stopped work on a 51-story skyscraper in Beijing because of the
danger. ``We don't know when we can resume the project,'' an
official said. ``It doesn't look like it's going to be any time
soon.''
   But Mattel Inc. said it is continuing to operate two toy plants
in Guangdong Province, 1,500 miles from Beijing, which make clothes
for Barbie dolls and some Disney-theme pre-school toys.
   McDonnell Douglas Corp. ordered 51 employees and dependents at an
airliner assembly plant outside Shanghai to leave the country
Tuesday, said Garth Chang, Douglas' top Asia-based executive in Hong
Kong.
   Workers weren't aware of the turmoil that had engulfed the
country because of the government's news blackout, Chang said.
   Mac Jeffery, spokesman for International Business Machines Corp.
in Tokyo, said the company has 120 employees in China supplying and
maintaining computers. Half are foreigners, he said, and all but two
of those had left China by Thursday.
   ``The office is technically open, but if someone needs service,
it would depend on the situation whether we could help,'' he said.
   ``I wonder what business is to be had,'' Jeffery added.
   About 30 American staffers of an Occidental Petroleum Corp. coal
mine in north-central China were on a U.S. government-chartered
evacuation flight from Beijing Thursday. They declined to give their
names to a reporter at Tokyo's Narita airport, but said there had
not been any trouble at the mine.
   The danger of being on Beijing streets caused Sanyo Electric Co.
to tell some 100 workers to remain at home and not report to their
jobs at a joint venture plant in the capital making electronic
calculators, Sanyo said in Tokyo.
   Nippon Steel Corp. spokesman Takeshi Itagaki said the company had
no problems at a project giving technical assistance to a steel
plant near Shanghai, and its exports of steel products to 10 Chinese
cities were going ahead normally.
   Yokogawa Electric Corp., a leading Japanese manufacturer of
industrial instruments, shut a joint venture factory in Xian, Shaaxi
province, early this week, said spokesman Takeshi Mizuno.
   The 260 workers ``are participating in rallies in protest against
the military suppression in Beijing,'' Mizuno said. ``Even students
and workers from other factories are coming to call for a series of
major protest rallies. ... Some circles in the city are calling for
a general strike.''
   Japanese Foreign Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka, speaking in
Parliament Thursday, said, ``It cannot be denied that the
international image of China has been impaired a lot.''
   Singapore, where for five years the government has urged
businessmen to boost trade ties with China, also expressed worry
that the violence could damage China's ``open door'' economic policy
of welcoming foreign investment.
   After hearing of the violence early this week, Prime Minister Lee
Kwan Yew said, ``We hope wiser counsels will prevail to pursue
conciliation, so that the Chinese people can resume the progress
which the open door policies have brought them.''
   The turmoil has caused some price jumps for commodities exported
by China, such as peanuts, soybeans and silk cocoons.

<HEAD>Singapore Firms Brace For China Business Upheaval</HEAD>

   They don't recognize each other diplomatically,
but the world's largest developing country and one of the smallest
and most prosperous had been seeking mutual benefits from investment
and tourism.
   Now, bankers and businessmen in Singapore who followed official
calls to try to exploit the vast market in China are bracing for
serious disruption and possible losses.
   Over the last five years, the government urged businessmen to
bolster their established trade ties with China through direct
investments in manufacturing and hotel concerns. In addition,
Singapore lifted travel restrictions on its citizens visiting China
after a process of gradual easing that began in the early 1980s.
   The drive to strengthen business ties coincided with China's
appointment in 1985 of Goh Keng Swee as an adviser to help develop
coastal economic zones. Goh is Singapore's former deputy prime
minister and is widely credited with the country's industrial
transformation in the 1970s.
   Hopes of exploiting Beijing's open-door economic policy are
stalled and almost certainly will be reassessed after the turmoil in
China.
   ``A China with large sections of her people, including her best
educated, at odds with the government means trouble with people
resentful, reforms stalled and economy stagnant,'' Prime Minister
Lee Kuan Yew said after hearing of the initial violence.
   ``Because of her size, such a China could create problems for
herself and her neighbors in Asia,'' Lee said. Singapore is a small
island nation more than 1,000 miles south of China.
   ``We hope wiser counsels will prevail to pursue conciliation, so
that the Chinese people can resume the progress which the open door
policies have brought them,'' the prime minister said.
   Lee Hsien Loong, Singapore's trade and industry minister and the
prime minister's eldest son, offered his country two years ago as an
efficient go-between for international traders seeking contacts in
China. ``We can smooth the way for the international business
community to do business with China and we can also help, albeit in
a small way, to further modernize China's economy.''
   Lee Hsien Loong said this thriving country was a useful
commercial gateway because of formal agreements already in place.
These promise to protect investments by the Singapore-based
subsidiaries of multinationals, avoid double taxation and guarantee
the entry of goods and services into the Chinese market.
   Tourism officials in 1987 started promoting Singapore in the
United States as a complementary destination to China. One objective
was to persuade U.S. travel agents to arrange package tours
featuring Singapore and China as joint destinations with common
attractions.
   The China connection goes back to Singapore's founding as as
British colonial trading post in 1819, when it became a magnet for
migrating Chinese peasants. The population is 2.6 million, about 76
percent of whom are ethnic Chinese, and Mandarin is one of four
official languages.
   Despite being only slightly larger than Chicago, Singapore is
China's fifth largest export market after Hong Kong, Japan, the
European Economic Community and the United States, much of it for
re-export to the rest of southeast Asia.
   Trade between China and Singapore quardrupled in the past decade
to $2.25 billion last year.
   The Foreign Ministry has advised all Singaporeans to leave
Beijing and the Trade Development Board advised businessmen to
postpone trips to China.
   After the Feb. 23 announcement that Indonesia and China would
restore diplomatic ties within a year, officials said Singapore
would follow suit within a few months. Officials declined to comment
on whether the turmoil would delay that.

<HEAD>After Blockbuster Cases, Fraud Squad Faces Changes At Top</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   First came Levine. Then there was Boesky. Then
Drexel Burnham Lambert.
   The three blockbuster fraud cases epitomized the success of the
Securities and Exchange Commission in exposing financial skulduggery
and toughening securities law enforcement standards in the 1980s.
   Now, with the federal agency's enforcement chief, chairman and
several other top officials stepping down, what can the SEC do for
an encore?
   ``I think what we have seen is some very good cops and robbers
work,'' said SEC commissioner Joseph Grundfest, who has announced
he's leaving in mid-1990 to teach at Stanford University. ``The
division has scored bull's eyes with big cases.''
   The direct hits constituted a domino effect that thrust the
55-year-old federal agency charged with policing the nation's
financial markets into the spotlight during a wildly prosperous
decade whose handmaiden was scandal.
   A tip about suspicious trading practices at a Bahamian bank
eventually led to Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. investment banker
Dennis Levine, who in 1986 agreed to relinquish $12.6 million in
insider trading profits and penalties.
   Levine cooperated with the government and ratted on speculator
Ivan Boesky, who paid $100 million in forbidden profits and
penalties for insider trading and named names, including Drexel and
its junk-bond impresario Michael Milken.
   Drexel is paying $650 million in fines and restitution; Milken
has been indicted for fraud and racketeering and could face even
bigger financial punishment.
   Those cases, along with a calm response to the 1987 stock market
crash, raised the SEC's stature and stirred calls in Congress to
boost funding for an agency that raises for the Treasury nearly
three times its annual budget.
   But with most of the Drexel matter resolved, SEC Enforcement
Director Gary Lynch said he is leaving in July after four years atop
the agency police squad. SEC Chairman David Ruder, a Reagan
administration appointee, is stepping down to return to teaching,
which will allow President Bush to shape the agency.
   Besides Grundfest, the other three commissioners are rumored on
the way out; two are serving without Senate confirmation and one,
Edward H. Fleischman, is said to be considering resigning if he
isn't named to succeed Ruder.
   All that should point to a period of transition and uncertainty
at the Washington-based agency founded during the Depression in
response to the Crash of 1929. But staffers and outsiders said
enforcement groundwork laid down by Lynch should ensure a smooth
continuation.
   ``The SEC really has a very strong sense of continuity,'' said
Alan Bromberg, a securities law professor at Southern Methodist
University. ``It's a lot like the British government. The prime
minister may change but the people in the bureaucracy tend to be the
same over time.''
   ``There's no need to bring in anyone to clean things up or change
direction radically,'' he said.
   ``Things have continued to work pretty much as usual,'' said
William McLucas, an associate enforcement director and a top
candidate for Lynch's job.
   ``There is some level of anticipation about who the new chairman
will be and who the director of the division will be,'' he said.
``It's not a paralyzing kind of thing, just the kind of thing you'd
normally expect to be on people's minds.''
   Aside from the new leadership, two factors could dictate whether
the SEC remains in the spotlight. One is the direction of the
economy, which historically influences the nature of financial
crime. The other is whether the domino effect continues and the
Drexel case produces another high-profile bust.
   ``A legitimate question is, what's going to be the next Drexel or
is there going to be a next Drexel?'' said Barry Goldsmith, the
SEC's deputy chief litigation counsel, who helped handle the Drexel
case.
   ``Historically the pattern has been that each of these cases
starting with Levine has led to several others,'' he said. ``A
question is, is this going to end some time or is this going to keep
continuing? I don't know, I really don't.''
   The bull market of the 1980s with large numbers of mergers and
acquisitions led the commission to cases in which Wall Streeters
used advance information of takeover activity to illegally trade in
securities: insider trading.
   But if the economy slows as many experts predict _ merger
activity already is showing a sharp decline _ the SEC could uncover
more financial disclosure improprieties as companies try to cut
corners or tinker with statements.
   ``It's human nature not to want to disclose the bad news unless
one's forced to,'' said John Sturc, an associate enforcement
director who also is in the running for the top job. ``We had a lot
of financial disclosure cases arising out of the '81-'82 recession.''
   The SEC already is devoting more resources to fraud in cheap,
over-the-counter securities known as penny stocks. Experts also
predict more cases involving overseas transactions, a reflection of
the enforcement division's liaisons with foreign government
counterparts.
   SEC staffers said the agency's general enforcement philosophy
changed in the early 1980s to concentrate more on the market process
and financial reporting and less on tangential legal issues.
   Along with that came a more militant stance on sanctions,
including stiffer penalties in all cases and tough compliance
provisions, such as oversight powers against Drexel.
   There also has been more cooperation with the Justice Department
in filing related criminal cases, such as with Milken and Drexel.
   ``My impression is that the commission in general felt a need for
more significant sanctions against people who violate the law in the
civil context,'' said Sturc, 39, who has worked in the enforcement
division seven years.
   The SEC isn't without problems. Staffing has increased by just 4
percent in the 1980s to around 2,130, while the commission's
responsibilities, workload and enforcement actions have soared.
   Sales on the nation's securities exchanges have risen to $2.1
trillion from about $540 billion in 1980. The number of brokerage
firms jumped to 11,900 from 6,750 and of brokers and dealers to
480,000 from 196,000 in the same period.
   The SEC collected $252 million in filing fees in fiscal 1988, up
more than four times from 1980, but its budget, at $143 million,
hasn't even doubled. The SEC is seeking $168.7 million for fiscal
1990, and has support from many congressmen who have sermonized
about financial irregularity.
   The commission also is seeking to boost salaries for its 800
staff attorneys, partly to halt a high turnover rate. First-year SEC
lawyers make $27,172, a third or quarter of what top law firms offer.
   ``It's a chronic problem but it's become dramatically acute,''
said Lawrence Iason, regional director of the SEC's New York office,
where staffing has been cut from from about 240 to 200 in recent
years. ``There are greater demands on our resources and we have
fewer resources.''

   Grain and soybean futures prices closed mostly
lower Thursday on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Wheat futures, which have been on a downswing because of the
political turmoil in China, were off for the third consecutive
trading session. Analysts say the problems in China may result in no
new orders by that country for U.S. wheat.
   ``There was no feature to today's trading,'' said Frank Kouba, an
analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in Chicago. ``There was
some concern over China and additional wheat sales, but the market
lacked any real direction.''
   Soybean futures were mixed, getting a boost from a threatened
sales boycott by Brazilian farmers who say they are worried about
their government's exchange rate policy.
   In addition, dockworkers in Brazil are threatening another
nationwide port strike, which would hamper that nation's soybean
exports, Kouba said. A strike by dockworkers last month shut down
most Brazilian ports.
   Corn prices were pressured by light demand and reports of
improved growing conditions in major crop areas.
   At the close, wheat was a \ cent to 2 cents lower with the
contract for delivery in July at $3.81 a bushel; corn was 2{ cents

   The stock market gained ground today, squeezing a
little more mileage out of its recent rally fueled by takeover news
and rumors and declining interest rates.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 31.62 points over the
last two sessions, rose another 6.43 to 2,518.75 by 3 p.m. on Wall
Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 5 to 4 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 802 up, 639 down and
524 unchanged.
   New takeover bids this week for Time Inc. and LIN Broadcasting
touched off buying in a wide range of stocks thought to be possible
future candidates for acquisitions or buyouts.
   Eastman Kodak, said to be a potential target, climbed | to 51[.
   Time stock, meanwhile, dropped 2~ to 167[ and LIN lost 2~ to 126|
in the over-the-counter market after both experienced dramatic
runups in Wednesday's trading.
   Burlington Resources, the volume leader among NYSE issues, fell
2[ to 44\. Pennzoil, which had been considered a possible bidder for
Burlington, sold its stake of 11.7 million shares in a block at 45\.
   Pennzoil, which reaped a healthy profit on the investment, gained

   Beyond the takeover hubbub, analysts say the market has benefited
from signs this week that the Federal Reserve might be starting a
change of course in its credit policy.
   After more than a year of tightening credit conditions, the Fed
is widely believed to have made an initial step toward easing, by
permitting a decline in the interest rate on federal funds, or
overnight loans between banks.
   Energy stocks were mostly lower amid skepticism that members of
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries would adhere to
new oil production quotas set this week.
   Exxon dropped { to 43}; Texaco { to 49]; Amoco 1[ to 43|;
Atlantic Richfield 1| to 91}, and Chevron 1\ to 53|.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks edged

<HEAD>Martin Sorrell: Marketing Maven Builds Ad Empire Through Takeovers</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto planned</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When Martin Sorrell engineered an industry record
$566 million purchase of the parent of the J. Walter Thompson
advertising agency two summers ago, he called it the ``opportunity
of a lifetime.''
   But opportunity seems to have knocked more often than the
bespectacled 44-year-old financial maven foresaw. His WPP Group PLC
verges on a larger takeover, the $864 million buyout of another
Madison Avenue icon, Ogilvy Group.
   In his three years at WPP, the Cambridge- and Harvard-educated
son of a British retailing executive has built a global
communications empire.
   He's done it by adding more than three dozen advertising, public
relations and marketing services firms to the framework of a company
that still makes wire shopping baskets and plastic dish drainers.
   The Ogilvy deal, expected to close within weeks, will make WPP
the world's second biggest advertising and marketing company,
trailing only Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Co. PLC where Sorrell toiled nine
years as the top financial officer.
   Sorrell has said the Ogilvy purchase will make his company the
world's finest advertising and marketing services company, but
eschews any interest in surpassing Saatchi as the largest.
   His rapid rise to the top of the advertising-marketing industry
has left some people gushing at what they call his business genius
and others describing him as arrogant and vindictive.
   Sorrell has been embroiled in a bitter legal battle for more than
a year with a half dozen former executives of the ad agency Lord
Geller Federico Einstein that WPP acquired as part of the J. Walter
Thompson deal.
   The Lord Geller executives, including agency founders Richard
Lord and Arthur Einstein, walked out in March 1988 to form their own
agency after chafing under eight months of WPP ownership.
   Philip Geier, chairman of the advertising conglomerate
Interpublic Group of Cos., has criticized Sorrell for his
unsolicited advances against both Thompson and Ogilvy.
   He said WPP's assault on Ogilvy exposed Sorrell as a financial
gambler who has ``taken a major company that was doing fine and
leveraged it to the hilt.''
   WPP is using a combination of stock and debt to finance the
Ogilvy takeover. People close to Sorrell say Geier may be biased
since Interpublic failed in its eleventh-hour bid to wrest Ogilvy
from WPP's grasp by proposing a stock swap.
   Several top executives of the packaging, design, sales promotion
and corporate identity firms that WPP has acquired say they are
delighted with the deals. They speak glowingly of the opportunities
Sorrell created for their businesses by associating them with a
prestigious name like Thompson and by imposing financial discipline
they individually lacked.
   WPP's acquisition ``was the best thing that ever happened to
Reese,'' said Lynn Pounian, president of Reese Communications Co.
Inc., a 20-year-old marketing concern based in Arlington, Va.
   In a manner typical of Sorrell's approach in acquiring privately
held companies, WPP Group bought Reese in September 1987 for an
initial payment of $14 million in cash and a promise to pay up to
$21 million more depending on earnings performance over the next
several years.
   The approach, which Sorrell honed during his days at Saatchi,
enables WPP to hold onto the management of the companies it acquires
by giving them a continuing stake in the success of the firm.
   Sorrell stays out of the day-to-day operations of WPP's
companies, but has them file daily financial reports and holds them
accountable for meeting performance goals.
   ``The critical thing is what questions you ask,'' Sorrell said in
an interview following the Thompson acquisition in 1987. ``If you
ask certain things, people in giving you the answers will ask
themselves, `Why did they ask me that question?' Good things come
out of that if you are asking the right questions.''
   Reese's Pounian said officials at her company rarely had time to
ask themselves the financial questions Sorrell asks, and she
welcomes the discipline.
   ``Is it a picnic in the park every day? No. ... But the benefits
so outweigh the minor inconveniences that there is no question we
are in a better position than we would have been,'' she said.
   Sorrell, who pronounces his name with the accent on the first
syllable, was born on Valentine's Day in 1945. His father ran the
retail division of a large British industrial concern, and the
youngster worked in its credit department when he was 16. He studied
economics at Cambridge University and earned an MBA from Harvard.
   One Harvard classmate, Alabama real estate developer Still Hunter
Jr., remembers Sorrell as ``very incisive ... very bright'' and a
standout in finance. ``If he believed in something, he would
persist,'' Hunter recalls.
   After Harvard, Sorrell worked for Glendinning Associates, a
marketing consulting firm in Westport, Conn. Later bosses included
sports promoter Mark McCormack and food retailer and investor James
Gulliver, both in London.
   It was while working for Gulliver that he met the Saatchi
brothers. They hired Sorrell as their top financial officer in 1977
and the firm grew rapidly in the following nine years.
   Sorrell struck out on his own in 1986 as chief executive of Wire
&amp; Plastic Products, precursor of WPP Group.
   He lives in Hampstead, near the north London neighborhood where
he grew up. He and his wife have three sons, and Sorrell spends his
free time with them, sometimes skiing or playing cricket.

<HEAD>Management Loses Reorganization Right</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal bankruptcy judge Thursday stripped
Allegheny International Inc.'s management of its exclusive right to
file a plan to bring the company out of Chapter 11 protection.
   Judge Joseph L. Cosetti's action means any creditor can file a
plan to compete with one filed by the company's management.
   Reasons for the decision were not given, but the move came after
the about 10 days after Allegheny International filed its fifth plan
since entering Chapter 11 in February 1988. Its unsecured creditors
are owed $220 million.
   Allegheny International's lenders and unsecured creditors
immediately said they would file reorganization plans of their own.
   Allegheny International's most recent plan was to bring its
Sunbeam Corp. subsidiary, the profitable small appliance maker that
includes virtually all of Allegheny's operating companies, out of
Chapter 11 bankruptcy separately from the parent company.
   Gary Blum, an attorney representing company stockholders, said
Cosetti's action ``just made getting the financing impossible'' for
the Sunbeam plan.
   The last reorganization plan for Sunbeam would have paid cash to
settle all of the approximately $240 million in claims pending
against the subsidiary. It would have left the Pittsburgh-based
parent still in bankruptcy court to haggle with creditors.
   After collapse of the fourth reorganization plan, Allegheny
International said the judge was so aggravated that he suspended
payment of most fees to attorneys and accountants involved in the
case.

   The stock market inched ahead today, squeezing a
little more mileage out of its recent rally fueled by takeover news
and rumors and declining interest rates.
   New takeover bids this week for Time Inc. and LIN Broadcasting
touched off buying in a wide range of stocks thought to be possible
future candidates for acquisitions or buyouts.
   Beyond the takeover hubbub, analysts say the market has benefited
from signs this week that the Federal Reserve might be starting a
change of course in its credit policy.
   After more than a year of tightening credit conditions, the Fed
is widely believed to have made an initial step toward easing, by
permitting a decline in the interest rate on federal funds, or
overnight loans between banks.
   Energy stocks were mostly lower amid skepticism that members of
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries would adhere to
new oil production quotas set this week.

<HEAD>Eds: Interest rate figures reported by Donoghue's Money Fund Report
are for week ended Tuesday. All other figures are for the week ended Wednesday.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   Assets of the nation's 467 money market mutual
funds rose $1.78 billion in the latest week, the Investment Company
Institute said Thursday.
   The rise, to a record $314.48 billion in the seven-day period
ended Wednesday, broke the record of $312.69 billion set the
previous week, according to the Washington-based mutual fund trade
group. The previous week's figure was revised from the originally
reported total of $312.68 billion.
   The Investment Company Institute said that in the latest week,
assets of 231 general purpose funds fell $50.7 million to $101.59
billion, assets of 95 broker-dealer funds increased $1.44 billion to
$133.04 billion, and assets of 141 institutional funds rose $390.0
million to $79.85 billion.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds fell in
the week ended Tuesday to 9.08 percent from 9.11 percent the
previous week, according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade
journal based in Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield fell to 9.12 percent from 9.14 percent,
Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was 38
days, up from 37 days, Donoghue's said.
   Separately, the newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of
100 leading commercial banks, savings and loan assocations and
savings banks in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the
effective annual yield available on money market accounts fell to
6.60 percent as of Wednesday from 6.62 percent a week earlier.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super NOW
accounts, fell to 5.14 percent from 5.15 percent.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 9.06
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, down from 9.17 the
previous week. Yields were 9.15 percent on 1-year CDs, down from
9.28 percent; 8.98 percent on 2{-year CDs, down from 9.09 percent;
and 8.90 percent on 5-year CDs, down from 9.02 percent.

<HEAD>Crude, Gas Futures Finish Higher; Heating Oil Off</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wholesale gasoline and crude oil prices rose
Thursday, rebounding from the previous session's sharp selloff.
   Home heating oil futures finished lower, depressed by sluggish
demand typical for this time of year.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the contract for July
delivery of unleaded gasoline rose 0.66 cent to 64 cents a gallon,
after Wednesday's loss of 1.60 cents.
   The July contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
grade of U.S. crude oil, settled at $20 per 42-gallon barrel, a gain
of 33 cents for the day. The crude contract had dropped 79 cents
Wednesday.
   But the selling continued in the heating oil pits, although not
as aggressively as on Wednesday. July-delivery No.2 heating oil fell
by 0.05 cent to 48.66 a gallon, adding a minor amount to Wednesday's
loss of 2.29 cents.
   Jerry Samuels, an energy broker at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.,
attributed the buying of gasoline futures to renewed demand,
particularly for New York harbor delivery gasoline, at the beginning
of the peak summer driving season.
   ``As the value of gas moves up, so will crude,'' said Samuels.
``Heating oil got left in the dust, which is understandable from a
seasonal perspective.''
   Crude also got a boost from buying in reaction to the tumble
prices took Wednesday when the outcome of the OPEC meeting
disappointed the markets.
   Ministers of the 13-nation Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries ageed to boost the cartel's production ceiling to 19.5
million barrels a day in the July-December period.
   The new ceiling is 1 million barrels per day higher than the
current level but below the estimated daily output in recent weeks
of about 21 million barrels.
   The OPEC ministers also decided during their Vienna meeting to
divide the extra production proportionately among all members.
Analysts said this means that some countries will have to curtail
some pumping to keep within their self-imposed quotas.
   Kuwait and several other OPEC members have indicated they intend
to pump more crude than their quotas allow and energy brokers doubt
OPEC will be able to control production enough to maintain strong
prices.

   The stock market churned ahead Thursday,
squeezing a little more mileage out of its recent rally fueled by
takeover news and rumors and declining interest rates.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 4.59 to 2,516.91,
bringing its gain over the past three sessions to 36.21 points.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 5 to 4 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
842 up, 652 down and 510 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 212.31 million
shares, against 213.71 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those
stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market,
totaled 249.77 million shares.
   The Dow finished the day just short of last Friday's post-crash
high of 2,517.83 and still more than 200 points below its 1987 peak.
   However, the index at the American Stock Exchange reached a
record high, topping its best levels recorded in the summer of '87.
   New takeover bids this week for Time Inc. and LIN Broadcasting
touched off buying in a wide range of stocks thought to be possible
future candidates for acquisitions or buyouts.
   Eastman Kodak, said to be a potential target, climbed ] to 50~ in
heavy trading.
   Time stock, meanwhile, dropped 2 to 168 and LIN lost 4{ to 125 in
the over-the-counter market after both experienced dramatic runups
in Wednesday's trading.
   Burlington Resources, the volume leader among NYSE issues, fell 2
to 44]. Pennzoil, which had been considered a possible bidder for
Burlington, sold its stake of 11.7 million shares in a block at 45\.
   Pennzoil, having reaped a healthy profit on the investment,

   The dollar finished mixed against foreign
currencies Thursday in light trading ahead of Friday's release of
figures on U.S. wholesale price inflation.
   Gold prices moved lower.
   The dollar rose against the Japanese yen and French franc but
fell against other major currencies.
   Dealers said the dollar rose briefly against the West German mark
on rumors that U.S. citizens were injured or killed in China. The
dollar eased back after the U.S. State Department said it had no
information to confirm those reports.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said no U.S. citizens had
been killed in the violence and that only one had been injured.
   Traders were uncertain about how the dollar might be affected by
the Labor Department's report on the Producer Price Index for May.
   Cases could be made that either a big inflation increase or a
small one was good for the dollar, said Craig Sloane, a currency
analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. On the other hand, he
said, the dollar also could fall in reaction to a big or small
increase.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 0.25 yen to a closing 143.05 yen. Later in London,
it was quoted at 143.32 yen. In New York the dollar rose to 143.25
Japanese yen from 142.84 on Wednesday.
   In London, the dollar gained against the British pound. It cost
$1.5735 to buy one pound, compared with $1.5815 late Wednesday. In
New York the pound rose against the dollar to $1.5773 from $1.5730.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Wednesday's rates, included: 1.9725 West German marks, down from
1.9735; 1.7085 Swiss francs, down from 1.7100; 1.1973 Canadian
dollars, down from 1.1975; 6.6910 French francs, up from 6.6867; and
1,435.5 Italian lire, down from 1,436.2.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Wednesday:
1.9770 West German marks, up from 1.9610; 1.7100 Swiss francs, up
from 1.6965; 6.7040 French francs, up from 6.6600; 2.2220 Dutch
guilders, up from 2.2138; 1,439.50 Italian lire, down from 1,441.00,
and 1.1967 Canadian dollars, unchanged.
   Gold moved lower in London to a late price of $373.25 per ounce,
from $375.65 Wednesday. In Zurich, the bid price was $374.35, down
15 cents from late Wednesday.
   Later on the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for
current delivery fell to $373.50 an ounce from $376.10. Republic
National Bank of New York said gold was bid at $372.80 an ounce as
of 4 p.m. EDT, down from $374 late Wednesday.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $5.44 a troy ounce,
up from Wednesday's $5.38. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for
current delivery fell to $5.443 an ounce from $5.464.
   Financial institutions were closed in Hong Kong on Thursday for
the Chinese Dragon Boat festival.

   Gary and Elizabeth Cannon say they don't argue in
the cockpit, which their friends jokingly warn them about, and they
plan to continue flying together for Donald Trump's new Northeast
shuttle.
   The two, both former Eastern Airlines pilots who signed with
Trump late last year, are happy to be working again. They are among
170 Eastern pilots who now work for the casino-property billionaire.
   ``It's a golden opportunity. Everyone is excited,'' said
Elizabeth, a flight engineer celebrating her 27th birthday Thursday
at the Trump Shuttle's debut. She had been working for Eastern for
only a year and a half when employees struck the Miami-based carrier
on March 4.
   For co-pilot husband Gary, 42, who had flown for Eastern for 10
years, the heady enthusiasm of the occasion was tempered with
nostalgia.
   ``We'll always have a kinship to Eastern,'' he told a reporter in
the crowded Trump Shuttle terminal at New York's LaGuardia Airport.
``That's our roots. Eastern is a great group of people.''
   Cannon said he was relieved, however, that the three-month
``emotional roller coaster'' of striking Eastern was over for the
couple.
   Trump, unlike Eastern boss Frank Lorenzo, isn't in a
``confrontational position'' with employees, he said.
   The couple are relocating from Dublin, Ohio, to New Jersey.
   Other Trump Shuttle pilots, who had come from carriers other than
Eastern, were less prone to looking back.
   ``The potential is so much greater here,'' said Peter Woermann,
43, comparing his new job favorably with his former employer
Business Express, a regional airline based in Hartford, Conn. ``I
think it's a great opportunity.''
   Don Thompson, 28, came to fly for Trump from Precision Airlines,
a commuter line based in Manchester, N.H., which suspended all
operations in March. Precision, one of the carriers which had fed
into Eastern's flights, furloughed 350 workers.

<TEXT>
   Forty Chinese nationals were ordered banned
from Grumman's Long Island plant under President Bush's suspension
of military dealing with China, the company said Thursday.
   The Chinese nationals, mostly engineers, were working on a
project to modernize electronics in the Chinese fighter plane.
   The Chinese were notified at a meeting at Grumman corporate
headquarters on Wednesday that they would not be permitted on
Grumman property after 5 p.m. that day, said the spokesman Robert
Harwood.
   They were told to turn in the identification badges allowing them
on the premises in Bethpage.
   As of Thursday, they were waiting instructions from their
government, Harwood said.
   Grumman is the prime contractor on the largest U.S.-Chinese
military project.
   The company was formally told by the Pentagon on Wednesday that
under Bush's order no Chinese nationals were to be allowed into the
plant.
   ``The Chinese were very upset,'' said Harwood. ``They had a
feeling they had been let down.''
   The Chinese, many of whom had been working at Grumman since 1987,
had built up strong relationships with their American counterparts,
according to Grumman employees.
   They had been to parties and barbecues at the homes of many of
the Grumman workers.
   Now they feel cut off because they have had no contact with
officials in China, the workers said.
   All of the Chinese are here without family and are renting
apartments or houses on Long Island.
   ``We have told them if they need anything of a personal nature
that they should call us,'' said Harwood.
   Grumman officials do not know if the project will be eventually
canceled.
   Grumman was awarded a $500 million U.S. Air Force contract to
develop and modernize a weapons control system for 55 existing F-8
Chinese fighters. The Chinese had contracted with the U.S. Air force.
   Grumman had 250 employees working on the program. Those employees
will be shifted to other projects or layed-off, said Harwood.
   Grumman, Long Island's largest employer, employs some 19,000
people on the island.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The two broadest measures of the nation's money
supply rose in the week ended May 29, the Federal Reserve Board
reported Thursday.
   The Fed said the measure known as M2 rose to a seasonally
adjusted $3,077.1 billion from $3,072.6 billion the previous week.
   An even broader measure, M3, rose to a seasonally adjusted
$3,958.3 billion from $3,953.5 billion.
   The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, rose to a
seasonally adjusted $773.9 billion from $772.3 billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply
measures.
   The Fed in February reaffirmed a provisional target for 1989 of 3
percent to 7 percent growth in M2 and 3.5 percent to 7.5 percent
growth in M3. The Fed has not set a target for M1 growth since early
1987.
   For the latest 13 weeks, M2 averaged $3,077.7 billion, a 1.3
percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous 13
weeks. M3 averaged $3,953.8 billion, up 3.6 percent, while M1 fell
3.5 percent to an average of $781.1 billion.
   In other reports:
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported commercial and
industrial loans at major New York City banks rose $813 million in
the week ended May 31.
   _The Federal Reserve said bank borrowings from the Federal
Reserve System at the discount window, excluding extended credit,
averaged $464 million a day in the week ended Wednesday, down from
$534 million the previous week.
   _The Federal Reserve said net free reserves averaged $665 million
in the two weeks ended May 31, up from a revised $324 million in the
previous two-week period.
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that the monetary
base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank reserves held at
Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and in circulation,
was $289.2 billion in the two-week period ended May 31, down from
$289.6 billion two weeks earlier.

   Here are some facts and figures about the
Securities and Exchange Commission:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   HISTORY: The SEC was created in 1934 as part of the Securities
Exchange Act in a wave of financial regulation under President
Franklin D. Roosevelt reacting to the stock market crash of 1929 and
subsequent Depression.
   DUTIES: The Washington-based commission is charged with
regulating the nation's financial markets and market professionals,
including all stock exchanges, brokers and investment firms. It
regulates financial disclosures by companies and enforces federal
securities laws.
   The SEC is run by a panel of five commissioners, including a
chairman.
   It has a total staff of about 2,130, including 800 attorneys, in
13 cities: Atlanta; Boston; Chicago; Denver; Fort Worth, Texas;
Houston; Los Angeles; Miami; New York; Philadelphia; Salt Lake City;
San Francisco; Seattle; and Washington.
   The commission has the power to penalize securities-law violators
with fines, suspensions and oversight. It can refer cases to the
Justice Department for criminal prosecution.
   In 1988, the SEC brought 252 enforcement actions, including
insider trading, corporate reporting, market manipulation, fraud and
other cases. It also reviewed 10,985 disclosure filings, 4,000 more
than in 1983.
   FINANCING: The SEC had a budget of $142.6 million, up from $73
million in 1980. It has requested $168.7 million for fiscal 1990.
   In 1987, the commission raised about $264 million from stock
registration fees and $121 million from court orders to defendants
to return illicit profits. Under federal securities laws, though,
the agency cannot use any of the money it raises.

<HEAD>Cable Companies Defend Ownership Of Programming Services</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY ARNOLD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cable television operators are not stopping
their viewers from seeing independent programming, according to a
study released Thursday that was paid for by the operators.
   When cable companies hold financial stakes in program services
such as Home Box Office, Showtime or MTV they don't try to keep
their viewers from seeing non-affiliated networks such as ESPN or
USA, the study said.
   These large cable operators also don't refuse to license their
program services to competing delivery systems such as microwave and
backyard satellite dishes, according to the study by Benjamin Klein,
an economics professor at the University of California at Los
Angeles.
   Klein's study disputed assertions that giant cable operators such
as Tele-Communications Inc. (TCI) and American Television and
Communications Corp. (ATC) use their size to discriminate against
program networks they do not own.
   He said that although these companies are more inclined to carry
the program services in which they have a stake, they also are more
likely than other cable operators to carry programming in which they
have no investment.
   But more importantly to cable TV viewers, Klein said, cable
operators' willingness to invest in programming networks, a practice
known as ``vertical integration,'' has led to ``an increased variety
of programming choices not previously available to television
consumers.''
   ``As this landmark report illustrates, cable's investment in
programming has enabled our industry to offer consumers a new and
better type of television,'' National Cable Television Association
President James Mooney said.
   NCTA released the report less than a week before a Senate
subcommittee was scheduled to begin hearings on increased
concentration of media ownership. It did not say how much Klein was
paid for it.
   Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, has proposed that no single
company may own cable systems that reach more than 25 percent of the
nation's cable households, similar to federal regulations on
over-the-air broadcasters.
   Metzenbaum also has proposed a bill that would prevent cable
operators who hold financial interests in program services from
denying the services to competitors such as ``wireless cable''
(microwave) companies.
   Klein studied 400 U.S. cable systems of varying sizes and markets
and found that vertically integrated multiple-system operators ``are
somewhat more likely to carry networks in which they have an
ownership interest.''
   However, he said this effect is generally small because the
vertically integrated companies have ownership interests in
relatively few networks compared to the 40, 50 or even 120 channels
they may carry.
   He said four large, vertically integrated cable operators _ TCI,
ATC, Viacom and Cablevision Systems _ have ownership interests in an
average 7.8 program networks among the top 28 networks, whereas he
said the average cable system has 43 channels.
   TCI has interests in Cable News Network, The Discovery Channel,
Headline News and SuperStation TBS. ATC owns HBO and has stakes in
CNN, Cable Value Network, Movietime and TBS. Viacom's interests
include Showtime, The Movie Channel, MTV, Nickelodeon and VH-1,
while Cablevision has interests in American Movie Classics, CNN and
Shop Television Network.
   Klein found that on average the most popular networks are carried
by 5.1 percent more of the cable systems owned by the four
vertically integrated companies than they are by 153 non-affiliated
cable systems in the study.
   Cable systems owned by the four large companies carried Lifetime
17.1 percent more than non-affiliated cable systems; they carried
USA 2.4 percent more; MTV 4.6. percent more; and ESPN equally (100
percent).
   VH-1 was carried 7 percent less by the four large companies, and
The Movie Channel was carried 6.2 percent less by the four companies.
   The four companies provide service to 19 million, or about 39
percent, of the nation's 48.6 million cable subscribers, which Klein
said was not a large enough slice of the cable audience to allow
them to prevent entry of new programming networks.

<HEAD>MEI One Of Spurned Bidders For Northwest Airlines</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A company owned by Minneapolis investor Irwin
Jacobs and Minnesota Twins owner Carl Pohlad Thursday confirmed it
was one of the spurned bidders for NWA Inc., the parent company of
Northwest Airlines.
   A special NWA board committee rejected the bid by a group of
investors that includes MEI Diversified Inc., MEI President Donald
E. Benson said in a news release.
   Benson could not be reached by telephone for further comment late
Thursday.
   MEI, a Minneapolis-based snack foods company, submitted a bid of
about $3.3 billion, or about $110 a share, The Wall Street Journal
reported Thursday, quoting unidentified sources.
   A special NWA board committee rejected all bids earlier this week
after finding none acceptable. Board members have declined comment
on the bids and have not released information to Northwest
management, said Bob Gibbons, a spokesman for the airline.
   The other known bidders for NWA are oil billionaire Marvin Davis,
New York-based Pan Am Corp., Northwest's 20,000-member machinists'
union and an investment group led by former hotel executive Alfred
Checchi.
   The committee asked for new bids by 4 p.m. EST June 16, and said
bids should be held open until June 30 to give the committee time to
evaluate the revised proposals, Gibbons said.
   Benson was quoted by the Journal as saying an investment in an
airline was an option, as MEI seeks to diversify.
   ``We're looking for areas outside the snack food business and
we're sitting on a great deal of cash,'' he said.
   As of Dec. 31, MEI showed $123 million in cash and marketable
securities on its balance sheet, most of which came from a 1987
equity and debt offering, the Journal said.
   MEI reported revenue, primarily from sales of nuts, candies and
other snack foods, of $219.9 million last year and earnings of $6.7
million, or 35 cents a share, the newspaper said.
   Pohlad, a Minneapolis banker, is a member of Texas Air Corp.'s
board and has been involved in Eastern Airlines' efforts to
reorganize.
   Jacobs, who owns Minstar Inc., recently joined Amway Corp. to bid
for Avon Products Inc.
   Forbes magazine lists Pohlad's personal net worth at $670 million
and Jacobs' as $240 million.
   Pohlad and Jacobs did not return phone calls Thursday.
   In another development Thursday, Marvin Davis announced that his
$2.67 billion, or $90 per share, tender offer for NWA Inc. was
extended to 6 p.m. EDT, June 14. The offer previously was scheduled
to expire at 6 p.m. EDT June 7. Davis originally made his offer in
March and has extended the deadline several times.
   NWA stock rose 87{ cents a share to $108.12{ Thursday following a
gain of $1 a share the previous day amid the new takeover reports.

<HEAD>Grain Prices Continue to Tumble</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HERBERT G. McCANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices declined Thursday
on the Chicago Board of Trade due to continued pressure from
favorable weather forecasts and slack demand.
   On other markets, copper prices were up while precious metals
were down; energy prices rallied; livestock and meat futures were
down, and sugar and cotton prices rose.
   Wheat futures, which have been declining because of the political
turmoil in China, were off for the third consecutive trading
session. Analysts say the problems in China may mean that country
won't place new orders for U.S. wheat.
   ``There was some concern over China and additional wheat sales,
but the market lacked any real direction,'' Frank Kouba, an analyst
with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in Chicago, said Thursday.
   Soybean futures were mixed, getting a boost from a threatened
sales boycott by Brazilian farmers who say they are worried about
their government's exchange rate policy.
   In addition, dockworkers in Brazil are threatening another
nationwide port strike, which would hamper Brazilian soybean exports.
   Corn prices were pressured by light demand and reports of
improved growing conditions in major crop areas.
   Wheat settled \ cent to 1{ cents lower with the contract for
delivery in July at $3.81} a bushel; corn was 3 cents to 5 cents
lower with July at $2.53\ a bushel; oats were 1{ cents to 2{ cents
higher with July at $1.65 a bushel; soybeans were 5} cents lower to
3 cents higher with July at $7.14 a bushel.
   Copper futures moved higher on New York's Commodity Exchange on
speculation about supply disruptions.
   The start of contract talks next week between U.S. producers and
their unions, with the possibility of strikes, and the continued
closure of Bougainville Copper Ltd.'s Papua, New Guinea mine boosted
prices, said Bette Raptopoulos, an analyst with Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc. in New York.
   Copper settled 1.10 cents to 2.50 cents higher with June at $1.35
a pound.
   Precious metals prices declined as the dollar showed renewed
strength.
   Gold settled $2.60 to $3.10 lower with June at $373.50 a troy
ounce; silver was 2.1 cents to 2.7 cents lower with June at $5.443 a
troy ounce.
   Energy futures mostly were higher on the New York Mercantile
Exchange in reaction to promises by Kuwait to cut back oil
production.
   Kuwaiti Oil Minister Ali Khalifa al-Sabah said his country
intended to produce 1.35 million barrels a day in coming months.
   On Wednesday the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
signed a new production accord that placed Kuwait's new quota at
1.093 million barrels. Its current output is estimated at nearly 2
million barrels a day.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil was 12 cents to 33 cents higher
with July at $20 a barrel; heating oil was .19 cent lower to .17
cent higher with July at 48.66 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was
.57 cent to .66 cent higher with July at 64 cents a gallon.
   Livestock and meat futures were mixed in lackluster trading on
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle settled .30 cent lower to .50 cent higher with June
at 69.32 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent to .15 cent
higher with August at 79.02 cents a pound; hogs were .25 cent lower
to .15 cent higher with June at 48.30 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .10 cent lower to .52 cent higher with July at 32.25
cents a pound.
   Sugar futures were up strongly on New York's Coffee, Sugar &amp;
Cocoa Exchange.
   The political tension in China, which spurred selling earlier in
the week, was set aside as rumors spread that India might enter the
market, said Kim Badenhop, an analyst with Merrill Lynch Capital
Markets Inc. in New York.
   China had been expected to enter the market for 300,000 metric
tons of sugar. Rumors are that India will buy 500,000 metric tons,
Badenhop said.
   Sugar settled .22 cent to .39 cent higher with July at 11.72
cents a pound.
   Cotton futures continued their run up on the New York Cotton
Exchange as new buyers entered the market, said Ed Whitten, an
analyst with Balfour Maclaine Corp. in New York.
   ``What spurred the buying was the overselling in reaction to the
situation in China,'' Whitten said. ``Equilibrium has been
recovered.''
   Cotton settled .37 cent to 1.02 cents higher with July at 64.18
cents a pound.

<HEAD>Prime, MAI At Odds Over Meeting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A hostile suitor for Prime Computer Inc. said
Thursday the computer maker showed no interest in a merger during a
meeting, but Prime termed the charge ``a gross misrepresentation.''
   Bennett S. LeBow, chairman of MAI Basic Four Inc., accused Prime
of refusing to provide confidential information it has given other
prospective bidders during a meeting over their prolonged and
contentious takeover battle.
   He said in a statement that Prime's representatives ``evidenced
no interest in negotiating a business combination of Prime and MAI
at this time on the terms of MAI's current tender offer.''
   Prime responded by saying it was ``shocked at the gross
misrepresentation'' of the meeting by LeBow.
   Tustin, Calif.-based MAI last November launched a hostile
takeover bid for the Natick-based minicomputer maker. Its latest
offer is worth about $1.05 billion.
   Prime confirmed that its chairman, David Dunn, and two board
members met with LeBow and his partner, William Weksel, on Wednesday.
   ``We went into the meeting in good faith, without lawyers or
other advisers attending, totally willing to enter into meaningful
discussions, as we are with any qualified buyer,'' said Anthony L.
Craig, Prime's chief executive.
   ``To have MAI represent us as `showing no interest in
negotiating' is simply a gross misstatement,'' he said.
   Craig also said Prime's representatives gave LeBow the same
projections of earnings, income and costs that have been supplied to
other potential bidders.
   Last week, MAI cut its tender offer for Prime's stock from $20
cash per share to a mixture of cash and securities valued by most
Wall Street analysts at $17 to $19 a share, said Barry Willman, an
analyst with the investment firm of Sanford Bernstein &amp; Co. in New
York.
   The original, all-cash offer amounted to about $970 million for
Prime's outstanding shares, or $1.25 billion for all of its stock,
including shares that can be converted from bonds.
   The new offer is worth about $1.05 billion for all of the stock,
said Jay Stevens, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in New
York.
   Prime has said that if it does not receive a better offer before
its annual meeting, it will enter into negotiations with LeBow to
explore a merger.
   MAI has filed a lawsuit in Delaware Chancery Court to try to
compel Prime to hold the annual meeting June 14, as previously
scheduled. Prime announced this week it was rescheduling the meeting
to July 26. A hearing on the suit is set for next week.
   Wednesday's meeting took place at LeBow's request.
   A Prime spokeswoman said it was the first meeting between LeBow
and top Prime executives since last fall, when LeBow met with former
Prime chief executive Joe Henson shortly before launching the
hostile bid.

<HEAD>Burger King Reviewing Pepsi Contract, Asks Coke For Proposal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Burger King Corp. is reviewing its exclusive soft
drink contract with Pepsico Inc. and has asked Coca-Cola Co. for a
counter proposal, a company spokeswoman said Thursday.
   ``It's part of a normal vendor review,'' said Cori Zywotow,
spokeswoman for Miami-based Burger King, the world's second-biggest
fast food chain after McDonald's. ``We asked both Pepsi and
Coca-Cola to submit proposals.''
   Pepsico has held the account since 1983, the year Coca-Cola lost
it, and expressed confidence that it would continue providing the
soft drinks on Burger King's menu.
   ``We've got a good record with Miami and with the franchises,''
said Tod MacKenzie, a spokesman at Pepsi Cola Co. headquarters in
Somers, N.Y.
   The principals won't say, but industry experts believe Burger
King sales accounted for 2.7 percent of Pepsi's total soft-drink
volume and 13.6 percent of its fountain volume last year.
   In Atlanta, Coca-Cola spokesman Randy Donaldson said his company
had no comment on the proposal request.
   Pepsi's MacKenzie said the review was expected in light of the
new corporate ownership of Pillsbury Co. and the new management team
at Burger King.
   Pillsbury, Burger King's parent company, was bought out by Grand
Metropolitan PLC last winter. Changes made since at Burger King
include the appointment of Gary L. Langstaff, a former top executive
at Hardee's, as Burger King's top marketing executive. Hardee's
serves both Pepsi and Coke but does more business with Coke.
   ``We're looking forward to showing them (the new companies) how
effective the Burger King-Pepsi relationship has been for six
years,'' MacKenzie said.

   Carlson Companies Inc. said it plans a

   The Minnetonka-based group of hotel and restaurant companies,
which already controls 200 hotels, said it expects to control 550
locations with 103,500 rooms by 1992.
   The new resort chain, called Colony International Resorts, will
be operated by the group's 30-hotel Colony Hotels &amp; Resorts
division, which expects to add 100 new franchise and management
contracts by 1992, the company said Wednesday.
   Colony also will move its 20-worker Los Angeles headquarters to
Minnetonka and add 1,000 new jobs in the next two years under the
plan.
   Carlson Companies is a private company with about $5.3 billion in
annual revenue.
   In addition to the 100 Colony division hotels, 250 hotels will be
added during the expansion through other Carlson group chains,
including Radisson Hotels International and Country Hospitality Inns.
   The group also owns TGI Friday's restaurants and Country Kitchen
restaurants.

<HEAD>High-Tech Companies Need To Form Consortia, Lawmaker Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY ARNOLD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. high-technology manufacturers are facing
unprecedented attacks from abroad, Rep. Mel Levine said Thursday in
calling for business-government consortia to re-establish American
world competitiveness.
   ``As a result of foreign strategies successfully targeting the
key technologies and industries of the 1990s, America's industrial
lead is today threatened for the first time since Henry Ford
invented the modern assembly line,'' Levine told a House-Senate
panel.
   The committee is exploring government-supported research and
manufacturing consortia that could help boost fledgling industries
such as high-definition television.
   ``American companies cannot compete individually against this
foreign targeting and will be increasingly forced to form consortia
as well as other cooperative ventures in order to regain
technological and industrial parity,'' Levine said.
   Once American companies have led in creating such consortia and
pledged ``significant resources to these consortia, various forms of
government assistance will often be necessary in order for the
consortia to succeed,'' he added.
   The U.S. electronics industry, which was severely buffeted by
foreign competition in the 1960s and 1970s, is seeking a
billion-dollar program to help launch high-definition television,
which promises snapshot-sharp images with a number of medical,
educational, military and entertainment applications. HDTV could
revitalize the ailing U.S. semiconductor industry as well.
   Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher is expected to propose to
President Bush this summer a program of tax incentives and antitrust
exemptions that would allow U.S. companies to join in HDTV
manufacturing consortia.
   But Mosbacher has said these companies should not expect handouts
from ``Uncle Sugar.''
   Levine, who chairs the Congressional HDTV Caucus and House Export
Task Force, took exception to the ``Uncle Sugar'' characterization.
   He said ``high-tech consortia are being proposed by the most
successful of our companies and industries. ... If the electronics
and other high tech industries seek government support today, it is
not because they need a handout, but because foreign targeting has
left them with no choice.''
   Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., chairman of the Joint Economic Committee,
said the focus of the panel was to go beyond HDTV and semiconductors
to ``broader, longterm policy issues'' that would help foster a
stronger economy and improved competitive position.
   Those concerns including whether foreign companies should be
allowed into consortia receiving federal support and the proper role
for the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency in promoting
commercial revitalization.
   DARPA Director Craig Fields told the panel that his agency
already has a 30-year track record of successful government-industry
research and development programs and that DARPA now was supporting
300 companies.
   He said R&amp;D is getting so expensive that few companies have the
resources to go it alone. He said consortia can combine diverse
skills and talents and save money by eliminating duplication of
effort.
   The question of how much foreign involvement should be allowed
was a tough problem to solve, Fields said, given the complex nature
of today's multinational corporations.
   He said the Defense Department does support foreign firms in
programs with U.S. allies, ``but we have not as yet significantly
supported foreign firms in the development of so-called dual use
technology _ technology critical for defense and also central to the
civilian industrial base _ because we did not see a net gain for the
U.S.''
   Ralph E. Gomory, a former vice president at International
Business Machines Corp., said the problem is not conducting
effective research, which he said is a U.S. strong point, but
applying that research to production, as the Japanese have done so
successfully.

   Gtech Corp., a major supplier of lottery
networks long rumored as a takeover target, said Thursday a special
managment committee would evaluate merger and takeover offers.
   Gtech acknowledged that ``certain parties have expressed interest
in possibly acquiring'' the company, but said no offers had been
received.
   The company said its directors were working with financial
advisers Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. and Alex, Brown &amp; Sons Inc.
   ``Companies apparently, from time to time, visit Gtech and raise
the issue of possible business combinations,'' Cato Carpenter, an
analyst with Alex, Brown, said from his Baltimore office.
   Carpenter added that the company was not currently in
negotiations, but that it wanted a committee to monitor these
inquiries.
   Rumors of a possible takeover first surfaced last fall, with
Bally Manufaturing Corp. of Chicago most often identified as a
possible suitor.
   Guy B. Snowden, Gtech's president, was not in the office
Thursday, his secretary said, and could not be reached for comment.
   Carpenter said Gtech was capable of adequately financing its
growth, and ``it isn't outright apparent why they would need to be
acquired.''
   Lower earnings last fall forced Gtech to lay off 10 percent of
its 1,300 workers.
   Gtech's stock, traded nationally over the counter, closed
Thursday at $14 a share, up $1.25. There were 253,000 shares traded,
three times the normal activity, Carpenter said.
   The company designs, produces and installs computerized lottery
networks, with 32 customers on five continents, including many of
this country's state lotteries. Much of its income comes from
maintaining and operating the systems.

   The chairman of Fuji Bank, Yoshiro Araki, has died

   The Japan Times said Araki died Saturday and his funeral was held
Monday. Fuji Bank is the third largest Japanese bank in terms of
fund volume and competes with Sumitomo Bank for highest
profitability in 1989, according to the Japan Company Handbook, a
ranking that makes it one of the world's top banks. Fuji Bank acts
as the center of the Fuyo company group.
   A graduate of Kyoto University, Araki joined Fuji Bank _ then
called Yasuda Bank _ in 1945. He was selected president for three
two-year terms starting in 1981 and became chairman in June 1987.

   Eastern Airlines presented a contract proposal
Thursday to the striking pilots union that seeks temporary pay and
vacation reductions similar to those implemented for non-union
workers last week.
   The proposal was made at the second official negotiating session
since Eastern was hit by a crippling strike March 4. The concessions
are necessary to help the airline emerge from bankruptcy, the
company said at a news conference.
   The Air Line Pilots Association responded by describing the news
conference as a ``public relations hoax'' and said the contract
proposal ``does not address the primary issues'' that led to the
strike.
   Eastern officials said part of the latest proposal is identical
to an offer first made last July. New elements include the company's
request that pilots take a 10 percent pay cut for six months and a 5
percent cut during the second six months. After a year, pay would be
fully restored.
   Eastern also proposed suspending contributions to a pension fund
through 1990 and canceling vacations for the rest of this year.
   As part of its plan to emerge from bankruptcy, Eastern last week
announced an austerity program that includes a 20 percent pay cut
for senior management and increased work hours at the same pay for
non-union employees. Vacations for those workers have been canceled
for the remainder of the year.
   ALPA spokesman Ron Cole said the union was angry that Eastern
announced the proposal at a news conference before it was presented
to ALPA negotiators.
   ``Obviously the cameras are more important than the contract,''
Cole said. ``It's nothing more than a public relations hoax
presented to establish a paper trail to the doors of the bankruptcy
court, where we expect Eastern will file for abrogation of our
contract.''
   Eastern spokesman Robin Matell said abrogation of the contract
``is simply an option, one that we would not even address at this
time. ... Our primary thrust is to successfully negotiate a pilots'
contract.''
   A federal appeals court on Wednesday rejected Eastern's request
to have the pilots ordered back to work. The pilots union says it
has been honoring the picket lines of the Machinists union, while
the company argued the pilots were striking to advance their own
contract negotiations without going through federal mediation
procedures as the Machinists did.
   The pilots' last contract expired in July 1988. Negotiations on a
new agreement have been held off and on since August 1987.
   Eastern filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 five days after it
was crippled by the strike by Machinists, pilots and flight
attendants.

<HEAD>Dollar Opens Higher, Share Prices Advance In Early Trading</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar opened higher against the Japanese
yen Friday morning, while share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange
rose moderately shortly after trading began.
   The dollar began trading at 143.25 yen, up 0.20 yen from
Thursday's 143.05-yen finish.
   Traders said the dollar opened higher after its similar uptrend
overnight in New York, where the currency ended at 143.05 yen.
   A trader with the Bank of Tokyo said Japanese investors'
dollar-buying incentives continued to be strong, with most trying to
push the dollar up even higher.
   ``Turmoil in China is no longer a strong dollar-buying incentive
here, and the majority of market players, who have kept buying the
dollar, are now sort of testing how much farther they can go,'' he
said.
   On the stock exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected
issues, a 91.40-point gainer the previous day, added another 84.56
points, or 0.25 percent, rising to 33,802.56 within the first 15
minutes of trading.
   Stock brokers attributed the Nikkei's early gains to overnight
gains in foreign markets. In New York, the 30-issue Dow Jones
industrial average added 4.59 points.
   Participants targeted their buy orders at electricals and
automobiles, they said.

   The Boeing Co. on Thursday introduced its
new 737-500, a high-technology jet designed to serve airlines flying
shorter routes within a hub system.
   Boeing said it passed up a chance to unveil the twinjet at the
ongoing Paris Air Show because the new model of the 737 series is
basically a familiar design that makes use of advances already
employed in other Boeing jets.
   The successor of the 737-200 twinjet will carry 108 passengers,
be quieter and consume 20 percent less fuel, said Joe Ozimek, a
marketing manager for Boeing's 737 and 757 models.
   Industry analysts said the 737-500 helps round out the Boeing
family and gives it a model in the 100-passenger range.
   ``I think what Boeing is really trying to do is have a product
for all ends of the market,'' said Bill Whitlow Jr., an aerospace
analyst for Dain Bosworth in Seattle.
   Last April, American Airlines placed a $3.1 billion order with
Fokker, the Dutch plane maker, for 150 planes that carry about 100
passengers each.
   The 737-500 will have the same advanced engines and avionics of
the 737-300 and will have a range of approximately 3,450 statute
miles.
   The first 737-500 will be delivered to Southwest Airlines in
March 1990, after flight testing to begin late this month, Ozimek
said.
   Sixteen customers have placed 138 orders for the model, which
costs $24 million to $28 million, depending on its interior
configuration and the date of delivery.
   The planes will be equipped with CFM56-3 engines, which allow air
to pass through them at a low velocity, reducing noise and allowing
the plane to meet the limits for noise set by the U.S. government,
Ozimek said. The engines are produced in the United States by a
joint venture of General Electric Co. and SNECMA of France.
   Production of the 737-500 is running ahead of schedule despite a
backlog of orders for other Boeing models. The company currently has
a backlog of 1,558 aircraft, which has pushed delivery dates to 1996.
   Boeing recently expanded its plant in Auburn, where much of the
737 model is manufactured and assembled. A $300 million expansion
has started at Boeing's Renton plant.

<HEAD>Lawmaker Says Bush Clean Air Plan Promising For Corn Growers</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Bush's plans to reduce auto
emissions are expected to increase demand for corn-based ethanol and
expand markets for other corn products, a congressman says.
   U.S. Rep. Tom Tauke, R-Iowa, said Thursday he expects Bush will
place greater emphasis on alternative motor fuels, such as ethanol,
as part of a clean air program the president is scheduled to
announce Monday.
   The Iowa Corn Promotion Board has estimated that with just normal
growth in gasohol use, the United States would need 390 million
bushels of corn to meet ethanol demand in 1989. About three-quarters
of the nation's ethanol is produced in Iowa and Illinois.
   Tauke said he expects the president's proposal to increase the
demand for gasohol _ a blend of 10 percent ethanol and gasoline _
and to encourage higher concentrations of ethanol _ up to the use of
pure ethanol _ as a fuel for cars, buses and trucks.
   ``If there is a commitment at the national level to have a
substantial portion of the automotive fleet in the country, or buses
or trucks, being operated by alternative fuels, then there's going
to be a major expansion in the use of ethanol,'' Tauke said.
   Bush is a long-time proponent of increasing the use of ethanol to
clean auto emissions and reduce carbon monoxide and other pollutants
in the air. He promised Thursday that he will unveil ``the most
sweeping changes to the Clean Air Act since it was last amended 12
years ago.''
   The clean air program also will focus on factory emissions and
acid rain. On Tuesday, Bush is scheduled to deliver a speech on
alternative fuels at Lincoln, Neb.
   Tauke said he based his assessment on the program's content on
discussions he had Wednesday with Bush's chief of staff, John
Sununu, and other White House officials.
   ``Our expectation is that the announcement will include
substantial incentives for the use of alternative fuels, in some
case the requirement for the use of alternative fuels,'' Tauke said.
   Use of ethanol as a motor fuel is touted for reducing the release
into the air of carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxide and smog. Tauke said
ethanol also is safer and easier to transport than another
alternative fuel, coal-based methanol, because it is not toxic and
burns with a visible flame.

<HEAD>Second Bidder Emerges For Hospital Chain</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>

   A second bidder emerged Thursday for
American Medical International Inc., a New Jersey consultant who
proposed creating an employee stock ownership plan to buy the big
hospital company.
   The offer from Brian M. Freeman Enterprises Inc. of Roseland,
N.J., was revealed by American Medical. Freeman, a business
consultant who has arranged other ESOPs, refused to comment on his
offer.
   Freeman's proposal values the company at $2 billion or $27 a
share, $23 of that in cash and $4 in new preferred stock. The
company's description of the bid said it was conditional on
obtaining financing. Details of the proposed ESOP weren't provided.
   American Medical, which owns 75 hospitals, already is weighing a
bid of $21 a share cash and $3 a share in securities by minority
shareholder M. Lee Pearce, a Miami physician and investor.
   A special committee of the board of directors that is weighing
the bids, along with a management-proposed restructuring designed to
boost shareholder value, on Thursday set a June 29 deadline for
submitting buyout offers.
   ``Several other expressions of strong interest'' in buying the
company have emerged, but there haven't been formal offers, said
spokesman Mick Taylor.
   American Medical has about 76 million shares outstanding,
including warrants and options to buy stock.

<HEAD>Parent of Seized S&amp;L Sues Federal Regulators</HEAD>

   The parent company of Gibraltar Savings on
Thursday sued the federal regulators who now control the thrift,
demanding the release of $11 million the parent says it is owed.
   Gibraltar Financial Corp.'s lawsuit, filed in U.S. District
Court, is the latest development in a dispute with federal agencies
over whether the holding company will be able to stay afloat now
that the thrift is under regulators' control.
   Gibraltar Savings, the nation's ninth-largest thrift, with
operations in California, Washington state and Florida, was seized
March 31 by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which declared the
institution unsound.
   Gibraltar Financial, a holding company whose stock is publicly
traded and which hasn't any significant assets other than two
Gibraltar Savings units in California and Washington state, wasn't
included in the seizure of its thrifts.
   The suit names as defendants the Federal Home Loan Bank Board,
the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp. and Gibraltar's own seized subsidiaries.
   Bank Board spokesman Karl Hoyle responded that regulators had
ample reason to take over Gibraltar, and are required by law to
preserve the assets of the savings &amp; loan without regard to the fate
of the holding company.
   ``Our responsibility is to the insured deposits and to the
depositors and to the FSLIC,'' Hoyle said from Washington, D.C.
``Unfortunately, that means, in the case of a stock institution, the
stockholders, the debtholders, they're cut out.''
   The holding company missed a $1 million interest payment to
bondholders June 1, blaming regulators' withholding of the $11
million.
   Gibraltar Savings of California has 83 branches and the sister
thrift in Bellevue, Wash., has six branches in Washington and 18 in
Florida. Together, they had $8.8 billion in deposits when seized.
   Gibraltar Financial lost $100.5 million in 1988 and $146.5
million in 1987. In 1986, it had a $43.9 million profit.
