   Hundreds of people filled a school
auditorium Friday night to remember with prayer and hymns the 10
victims of Wednesday's Pyro Mining Co. disaster.
   Gov. Wallace Wilkinson said Kentuckians in general, and the
families of Pyro Mining Co. miners in particular, ``share in the
immense grief.''
   ``Tragedies like this one ... make us mindful of the fragile
nature of the thread that holds us together,'' Wilkinson said during
the service at Union County High School near this western Kentucky
community.
   The auditorum, with seating for 700, appeared to be nearly
filled. A large wreath with yellow mums and white carnations backed
the podium onstage, with more flowers and ferns and a candle for
each of the victims in the foreground.
   An American flag was at one side of the stage and the crowd sang
``Amazing Grace.''
   In the investigation of William Station mine, near Wheatcroft,
was delayed as officials of Pyro and state and federal agencies
attempted to clear explosive levels of methane that persisted around
the explosion site.
   Investigators entered the mine Friday afternoon in an attempt to
reduce the hazardous methane levels.
   Officials of the U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration
approved, with modifications, a company plan for reducing methane
levels, said Kathy Snyder, spokeswoman for MSHA. If the plan is
successful, officials will remain underground and the probe will
begin, she said.
   Earlier Friday, the head of a public-interest law firm said Pyro
and federal authorities failed to prevent the disaster, even though
there were plenty of warning signs.
   This year, federal inspectors briefly shut down the William
Station Mine because of ``imminent dangers,'' said J. Davitt
McAteer, executive director of the Occupational Safety and Health
Law Center.
   Pyro reported 267 accidents at the underground mine since 1985,
but failed to report several others, McAteer said.
   Last year, for example, an MSHA audit of mine records revealed
Pyro did not report eight accidents at William Station, seven of
which forced workers to miss work, McAteer said. Accidents also went
unreported the two previous years, he said.
   Ed Calman, a Pyro spokesman, refused to discuss the company's
safety record. He said Pyro would reserve further comment until
company, state and federal officials completed their investigation
of the accident, which was expected to take several weeks.
   McAteer said MSHA was too lenient on Pyro after it discovered
blatant safety violations at William Station.
   He said William Station had a coal-dust explosion in September
1988, which injured two miners, and a methane ignition three months
later, which injured no one. In 1985, one miner was electrocuted at
the mine and another died in an explosion, he said.
   The following year, another miner died at William Station,
although McAteer said the report submitted to MSHA by the company
didn't specify a cause of death.
   MSHA spokesman Frank O'Gorman, who could not immediately verify
that Pyro failed to report some accidents, denied McAteer's claim
that his agency did not properly police Pyro was ``totally false.''

<TEXT>
   For 12 years, Guenter Bachmann
worked as a loading dock supervisor at a state cooperative in East
Germany. Then he got tired of not being able to say what he really
thought.
   Last week, Bachmann and his wife, Sabina, packed the family car
with a few belongings and headed for Hungary to join thousands of
their countrymen streaming to the West over Hungary's border with
Austria.
   ``It just hit me all of a sudden,'' the heavy-set 33-year-old
Bachmann said outside a refugee camp in West Germany's picturesque
Bavarian countryside.
   ``I just finally had enough of never being able to say what I
really thought, and there was no hint it was ever going to change.''
   The estimated 14,000 East Germans who fled to the West via
Hungary in the past week come from all walks of life, ranging from
laborers to tradesmen, from bakers to doctors and lawyers.
   Their exodus occurred amid increasing pressure for democratic
reforms across Eastern Europe, which has rejected the need for
economic and political reforms under way in the Soviet Union, Poland
and Hungary.
   East Germany enjoys the best standard of living in the East bloc,
but shortages are an aggravating fact of daily life.
   Dissent quickly is silenced by security forces. Demonstrators
demanding democracy routinely are beaten and jailed.
   Public dissatisfaction in the hard-line Communist nation of 16
million has mounted steadily.
   According to the West German Ministry for Inter-German Affairs,
74 percent of East Germans who have come to West Germany since
August left because of a lack of freedom of expression and human
rights.
   The discontent is causing East Germany to lose some of its best
workers in the country's biggest drain of talent since the Berlin
Wall went up in 1961.
   A ministry report published Thursday said 55 percent of East
German refugees who have come to West Germany since August are
between 18 and 30 years old, and 86 percent have high levels of job
training.
   The survey said the majority enjoyed relatively comfortable
lifestyles in East Germany. Nearly all owned a television, more than
half of them color. Sixty-one percent owned cars, according to the
report.
   But it wasn't enough to keep them in East Germany.
   ``When you read the state-owned newspapers, you feel like they
really must take you for a fool,'' said Karl Dengler, a chemical
engineering student from Leipzig, who was interviewed after crossing
into the West. ``The paper declares one production success after
another and East Germany's commitment to human rights, while in
reality you still have to wait 15 years for what passes for a car
and land in jail if you show a banner praising Soviet glasnost.''
   Hermann Knorr, 25, said he decided to leave out of frustration at
not being able to change the system.
   ``You talk and talk in small groups and nothing ever happens,''
said Knorr, a former Communist Party member who was close to
finishing a law degree in East Berlin.
   ``When I finally gave up and tried to organize (illegal)
discussion groups, the state security paid me a visit.''
   Knorr said he had wanted to stay in East Germany but ``lost all
hope.''
   Many young refugees said the aggravations of daily life became
unbearable when added to severe travel restrictions to the West and
lack of free expression.
   ``When I applied for an apartment of my own, I was told that the
wait would be 10 years,'' said Heidi Brueckl, who was a medical
assistant in Gera.
   ``I get along with my parents all right, but I don't think I need
to live with them until I'm 35. I want to be able to live my own
life.''
   Anna Schroetter, a 27-year-old textile worker form Leipzig, said
she was proud of some of the achievements of her country, especially
social programs that guaranteed free day care and other services.
   ``But what good is day care and kindergarten when your children
are drilled full of ideological nonsense? What good are guarantees
of a job when you have no real say in the work place?'' she asked.

   Rock 'n' roll pioneer Dick Clark said
Friday he's donating hundreds of videotapes, films and other
memorabilia for a music museum in a 30-story pyramid being built
along the Mississippi River.
   ``I've got a great collection of stuff to share,'' Clark said.
   Clark's announcement was to have kicked off a night of parades,
music and fireworks to mark the start of construction of the $56
million pyramid, intended as the centerpiece of a $200 million
tourist theme park billed as a musical Disneyland.
   Then it rained, and the party was postponed 24 hours, leaving
thousands of would-be revelers wandering aimlessly past soggy beer
and souvenir stands, and the empty soundstages set up for
street-party bands.
   Promoters had promised for weeks that the celebration, called The
Big Dig, would be the biggest party Memphis had ever seen. But
Sidney Shlenker, the man who will run the pyramid, said wet
electronics made the affair too dangerous.
   Major events of The Big Dig included a fireworks display with a
ton of explosives and a laser-light show outlining the shape of the
321-foot pyramid.
   Police said they had expected up to 100,000 spectators for the
show but were unable to count the sparse crowd that showed up
because it was too scattered through downtown.
   ``We're going to have the whole show tomorrow night,'' Shlenker
said. ``It just got to a point tonight that the decision got taken
out of our hands. It rained so hard that we've got pools of water.
It's just too dangerous with the electrical equipment to risk
peoples' lives.''
   A late-night rock 'n' roll concert featuring comedian Dan Aykroyd
and his Blues Brothers Review was to go on as scheduled at an
amphitheater on the city's Mud Island tourist park near the pyramid
site.
   Clark, who helped usher in rock 'n' roll with his TV show
``American Bandstand,'' said the museum will be a hall of fame
linked to his annual American Music Awards. The museum will include
computerized displays with recordings and videotapes of the nation's
musical past.
   ``You'll be able to punch up a date and find out what musically
was happening, what world events were happening and what it meant to
your life,'' Clark said.
   The concrete and stainless steel pyramid is scheduled to open in
May 1991. It is called ``The Great American Pyramid.''

   Schools offered free pizza, door prizes and even
chauffeured transporation to lure students to class for a head count
that will determine the size of state aid payments.
   At Parkman Middle School, Principal Dennis Schumacher gave away
portable radios, movie tickets and restaurant certificates. Victory
elementary school invited parents to a picnic.
   The idea was to get as many youngsters as possible in school
Friday, the day set by the state for deciding its per-student
distribution of financial assistance among districts throughout the
state.
   Milwaukee school district spokesman David Begel said Thursday's
enrollment figure was about 96,500. Official figures for Friday were
to be announced Monday.
   The Milwaukee Public School District expects to get $2,300 per
student.
   At Burdick school, principal Robert Schleck arranged to have one
youngster chauffeured to and from school, saying he was a transfer
from another school and had not yet been assigned a bus route.
   Robert Peters, principal at Custer High School, urged each
student to ``bring a dropout to school.''
   ``I told them that it was an excellent way for each of them to
help their peers have a better future,'' Peters said.
   School officials spent the last two weeks tracking students who
did not show up on opening day with telephone calls and visits to
their homes.
   On opening day at Vincent High School, 400 fewer students than
expected showed up, principal Kery Kafka said. Since then,
enrollment has increased by 210, enough to ensure that the school
will not lose any teachers, she said.

   Theater critics stung Sting for his stage debut
in ``The Threepenny Opera,'' but some in the black-tie audience
found the British pop star's performance dazzling.
   ``Slow and turgid stuff,'' complained The Washington Post's David
Richards, who said Sting's ``acting has little resonance and his
singing voice is surprisingly thin.''
   Sting said that President and Mrs. Bush, who watched from box
seats above the National Theater stage Thursday night, congratulated
him backstage on his performance. Sting played Mack the Knife in the
pre-Broadway premiere of Bertolt Brecht's biting musical satire.
   Soviet Ambassador Yuri Dubinin, who joined Bush backstage during
an intermission, said he was delighted with the play. He also seemed
to appreciate the chance to talk with Bush. The curtain for the
final act was delayed when the two men stepped aside for an animated
conversation alone.
   ``We didn't know if we were going to have a peace treaty ending
the Cold War or a third act,'' one cast member said later.
   The show is scheduled to open at the Lunt-Fontanne Theater in New
York on Nov. 5 after a four-week run at the National.

   Entertainer Sammy Davis Jr. says he'll fight
throat cancer with radiation treatments and without cigarettes.
   The 63-year-old singer, dancer and actor said he's been a heavy
smoker since he was 14. He quit 10 days ago.
   ``I'm going cold turkey,'' Davis said. When the urge strikes, ``I
put something else in my mouth. Candy, Life Savers, anything.''
   Davis said the prognosis for his recovery is strong. ``It's just
radiation, not cutting, so the voice box won't come out. Thank God
it's localized in one area,'' he said Thursday night from Lake Tahoe.
   A throat abnormality was detected recently during Davis' annual
medical examination and was diagnosed as cancer by Dr. Joseph
Sugerman, Davis spokesman Arnold Lipsman said. Sugerman expects
Davis to recover completely from the cancer, Lipsman said.

   Morton Downey Jr., who encouraged abuse from
his audience as a television talk show host, will be trying to
tickle funny bones in his new role as a country singer on a TV
sitcom.
   SYS Entertainment Group Inc., a newly formed company based in
central Florida, announced that Downey also will return as a TV talk
show host and on a drive-time radio program.
   SYS President Dennis Richard said the company is offering for
syndication ``That's My Dad,'' in which Downey will star as a
country singer living in Nashville, Tenn., with his three daughters.
The company also is trying to syndicate the talk show, called
``America Talks with Morton Downey Jr.''
   Downey's old TV show, canceled in July by MCA Television after
declining ratings, often was trashed by critics.
   ``I was always a kinder, gentler Mort, but the critics never saw
it,'' Downey, 55, said Thursday. ``But the audience always did.''

   A group of Syracuse University students
angered by NFL Hall of Fame running back Jim Brown's comments about
women picketed a campus bookstore where he signed copies of his
book, ``Out of Bounds.''
   The students said Brown had made sexist comments in his book and
to a local newspaper columnist. Brown met with the students Friday
and later appeared with them at a conciliatory news conference.
   ``I feel very strongly about everything these students stand for
and as I travel I will make mention of these things,'' he said.
   ``All women should be respected. All people should be
respected,'' said Brown, who played for Syracuse between 1954-1956
and retired from the NFL's Cleveland Browns as the league's all-time
leading rusher.
   Brown's comments ``were things about younger women being better
than older women, that women don't need an education, about women's
role in marriage,'' said senior Amy DiGennaro.
   Brown apologized for the remarks, but did not recant them.
   ``My personal preference is my personal preference,'' he said.

   Frazier recently was in a car accident that caused soreness in
his back and legs. He may wear a neck brace for the performance,
which also will star friend Sonny Averona.
   Smokin' Joe said he remembers singing with his family in church

   Ashrita Furman bounced 13 miles on a pogo stick
to celebrate his 35th birthday, and dedicated the apparently
record-breaking hop to his guru.
   ``I used to be a totally unathletic nerd, but then I got involved
in meditation,'' said Furman, whose birthday is today. His guru is
Sri Chinmoy. According to the 1988 Guinness Book of World Records,
Furman holds the previous record for distance pogo-jumping (11.3
miles) and for pogoing under water (3 hours and 40 minutes beneath
the Amazon in Peru.)
   Furman, a New York native, said he bounced 10 miles around a
running track in a park Friday, then bopped up Third Avenue three
miles to the Empire State Building, wearing out two heavy-duty pogo
sticks during the day.
   The building's managers were unmoved by Furman's record-breaking
plans and refused him permission to hop up the skyscraper's steps.
Furman set the earlier distance record by pogo-ing up and down
Japan's Mount Fuji.

   A strong earthquake has occurred in the Caspian

says.
   The tremor occurred at 10:05 p.m. EDT Friday about 90 miles east

   Monitors at the National Earthquake Information Service in

Finley said.
   There were no reports of casualties or injuries, although an
earthquake of that magnitude has potential to cause severe damage,
said Finley.
   About 400 miles east of the epicenter of the tremor, a quake

<HEAD>Bush `Flexible' as Drug Talks Start; Jackson Rips Drug Plan</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Bush, anxious for money to launch the
war on drugs, says he is ready to deal with Senate Democrats seeking
to expand the program by $2.2 billion now and enlarge it in the
future.
   ``We're flexible in terms of the funding method,'' Bush said at a
White House luncheon Friday. ``But I strongly believe we must return
the integrated elements of this drug strategy which took more than
six months to develop.''
   His comment came as a Senate bipartisan task force came away from
two hours of negotiations Friday with Republicans promising to
present a fresh financing plan when talks resume Monday.
   Meanwhile, the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson told the House select
committee on narcotics the Bush plan ``does not match the breadth of
this social crisis'' and urged summit-style talks to draw up a new
version.
   In the Senate, the Democratic plan to generate an additional $2.2
billion through a half-percent, across-the-board cut in federal
programs remained part of a money bill for transportation programs
awaiting final floor action.
   The administration opposes the idea, offered by Senate
Appropriations Committee Chairman Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., which
would slice $1.8 billion from the Defense Department's budget.
   ``We can't afford to sacrifice our military preparedness,'' Bush
said Friday.
   Democrats were confident following the initial session of the
task force made up of nine Republican and nine Democratic senators.
``It was a good step,'' Byrd told a news conference.
   Democrats said, however, that money agreements reached now would
be only a start on the drug war and that they have fundamental
disagreements with the Bush administration over what its size and
scale should be.
   Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Joseph R. Biden Jr., D-Del.,
said Democrats eventually want to expand the attack on cocaine
dealers beyond what has been envisioned thus far by Republicans and
provide more treatment and education.
   National drug policy director William J. Bennett, author of the
drug plan, says it most likely will be expanded in the future and an
updated version is due in February. He also says the
administration's request is a sharp increase over a drug-fighting
budget that was only $2 billion three years ago.
   Jackson drew applause and scattered shouts of approval from
spectators as he told the House select committee on narcotics the
nation needs ``a new initiative equal to the scope and depth of the
problem.''
   He criticized the plan for lack of enforcement strength, aid for
the poor and input from national and community leaders with
experience in fighting drugs. He said a meeting at the Camp David
presidential retreat should be convened to redraw the strategy.
   Jackson was sharply critical of both Bennett and the president.
   ``In April, Mr. Bennett announced that he would take
comprehensive emergency action to attack the drug crisis in the
nation's capital,'' Jackson said. ``Five months later, we still have
the emergency but no action.''
   ``President Bush announced a drug plan for Bogota, Colombia.
Where is his plan for the District of Columbia and cities around the
nation?'' he said.
   Jackson, reported to be weighing a race for mayor of Washington,
suggested the nation's capital could be a model for fighting the
drug scourge. He was asked what his role in that effort would be.
``A volunteer,'' he said.

<HEAD>New AIDS Test Gives Results, On The Spot, In 10 Minutes</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Patients worried they may be infected with the
AIDS virus will be able to get a quick and confidential answer soon
with a simple test that takes only 10 minutes.
   The test, now undergoing trials at nine centers, will enable
people to get results quickly in a doctor's office instead of having
to wait to hear from a distant laboratory.
   ``It provides a new means for patients to learn of their AIDS
status and still retain anonymity,'' said Jarel R. Kelsey, president
of Murex Corp., a Norcross, Ga., firm that developed the test.
``Once this method is widely available, it will encourage more
people to determine their status.''
   Tests for AIDS now require that blood be drawn and sent to a
laboratory for complex processing. Patients must wait to find out if
they have contracted the human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, which
causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome, or AIDS.
   ``That can take a number of days sometimes,'' said Kelsey.
   Concern about whether the test information will be kept
confidential and the long wait for results discourage some people
from being tested for AIDS, even though they may be at risk for the
disease, he said.
   The new test, called SUDS for single use diagnostic system, takes
away some of that anxiety.
   It consists of a small plastic disk, slightly thicker than a
camera lens cap, that is filled with an absorbent material. A
cone-shaped indention on top leads down to a small hole that exposes
the absorbent material.
   A SUDS test starts with a blood sample obtained from a simple
finger stick. Two drops of serum, the clear fluid in blood, are
separated from the sample and then combined with two reactant
solutions. The mixture is poured into the cone of the test cartridge.
   Inside the tester, the sample mixture is absorbed and pulled
through a color reactant. If a dot on the bottom of the disk remains
white, there is no AIDS virus. A blue dot means an AIDS infection.
The whole process takes about 10 minutes.
   Kelsey said the system works through the use of microscopic latex
beads that are coated with proteins that react to AIDS antibodies.
An antibody is a molecule in the blood produced by the body's immune
system to attack specific invaders, such as bacteria or virus. The
proteins used in SUDS react to antibodies created by the immune
system in response to both the outer membrane and the core of the
HIV virus.
   SUDS is being tested at selected doctors' offices, sexual disease
clinics, hospitals and blood banks. The trials started in July and
more than 5,000 tests have been conducted.
   ``The trials so far have shown an average accuracy rate of 99.8
percent,'' said Kelsey. ``Any specimen that has evidence of AIDS
antibody has been detected by the system so we are really achieving
levels of 100 percent sensitivity.''
   Clinical trials of SUDS end in October and the Food and Drug
Administration is expected to approve a license quickly, Kelsey said.
   FDA spokesman Brad Stone said the agency does not announce its
intentions ahead of time and will have to study the data. But he
noted, ``We recognize the need to get any test for AIDS out as soon
as possible.''
   Although the SUDS test is very simple to conduct, Kelsey said it
will not be sold for home use.
   ``Everybody is aware that exposure to the HIV is a terminal
condition,'' he said. ``Having that information revealed without
counseling immediately available could be a traumatic experience.''

   President Bush is standing by his opposition to
a federal ban on assault weapons, saying he doubts such a law
``could ever safeguard'' against a tragedy like the shooting rampage
in Louisville, Ky.
   ``I have seen no evidence that banning a specific weapon is going
to guard against it,'' Bush said Friday, referring to the shooting
spree in a printing plant the day before that left eight dead and 13
wounded.
   The president, at a news conference, called the shootings the
work of a deranged individual and said, ``It is terrible, and the
loss of human life is horrible.''
   But Bush, a life member of the National Rifle Association, said
instead of enacting new laws, ``we must do everything we can to
enforce laws that are already on the books.''
   Bush was spending the weekend at the presidential retreat in Camp
David, Md., before heading west on a two-day trip next week. He will
participate in bicentennial ceremonies in South Dakota, Montana and
Washington on Monday.
   At the news conference for out-of-town reporters, Bush also:
   _Repeated his opposition to raising federal taxes to pay for the
war against drugs, but said he would not criticize state or local
governments that did so.
   _Said the nation's education system ``is not making the grade''
and hoped his Sept. 27-28 education summit with the nation's
governors would lead to national educational goals and objectives
for schools.
   _Rejected a suggestion that the United States divert funds from
its contribution to NATO to pay for the drug war. ``Let's not let
down our alliance guarantees because we are more optimistic about
peace,'' he said.
   _Indicated he was giving ``serious and active'' consideration to
using former military bases to house prisoners from overcrowded
prisons.
   Bush was asked what he would tell the families of victims of
Thursday's shooting spree in a Louisville printing plant in which a
worker with several automatic weapons went from floor to floor
shooting down former co-workers.
   ``I'd tell them I feel horrible about the loss of life.''
   But, he added, ``I would tell them I don't think banning weapons
is going to be the ultimate answer or could ever safeguard against
that kind of tragedy.''
   He recalled automatic weapons were not involved in the 1966
shooting spree by Charles Whitman, who climbed to the top of a tower
at the University of Texas at Austin with three rifles, two pistols
and a shotgun. He shot 44 people, killing 14, before being killed
himself.
   He also said that in the 1960s, when he was a member of the House
of Representatives, he went to a police station in the District of
Columbia to register ``my arsenal'' of a rifle and a shotgun to
comply with the law.
   ``The guy looked at me like I'd lost his mind,'' Bush said,
adding that only a small percentage of gun owners were complying
with the law. Bush said he asked the officer if police were
``getting a lot of criminals to turn their guns in?
   ``He said, `No. It's just a bunch of suckers like you from
Northwest Washington.' And it made a profound impression on me.''
   Bush banned the import of foreign-made assault rifles into the
United States, including the AK-47, the weapon used in Louisville.
   However, possession of these weapons is not a federal offense,
nor does the import ban prevent them from being manufactured
domestically.

<HEAD>NASA Gets Go-Ahead For Controversial Probe Launch</HEAD>

   NASA has White House approval to proceed with
its much-debated October launch of a nuclear-powered satellite to
Jupiter.
   President Bush's science adviser, D. Allan Bromley, signed the
authorization Friday which is required before a nuclear device is
put into space. Bromley had the president's approval, said White
House spokeswoman Alixe Reed.
   NASA Administrator Richard Truly was informed, she said. The
mission would have been scrubbed had White House approval been
withheld.
   Critics worried about nuclear fallout in case of an accident will
ask a court to stop the launch, and promise to try to put their
bodies in the way if that doesn't work.
   The Galileo probe will be sent on its eight-year, $1.4 billion
mission from the cargo bay of the space shuttle Atlantis _ the first
time nuclear power has been carried on a shuttle.
   The three men and two women who will be on the Oct. 12 mission
were in Washington today for a breakfast with Vice President Dan
Quayle at his residence.
   Quayle, who intends to be at the Kennedy Space Center for the
liftoff, heads the National Space Council and was particularly
interested in meeting the astronauts because shuttle commander
Donald E. Williams is from Indiana, Quayle's home state.
   Protesters claim a Challenger-like accident could poison Earth's
atmosphere with ``the most toxic substance in the universe.'' They
are preparing to file suit in federal court to stop the mission and
a protest march is scheduled to begin at Cape Canaveral, Fla. on
Sunday.
   Bruce Gagnon, a leader in the Florida Coalition for Peace and
Justice, said ``we are going to attempt to enter the launch area and
sit on the launch pad.'' He has written that ``Plutonium 238 is the
most toxic substance in the universe. If ingested, it concentrates
in the bone marrow where it can cause leukemia. If inhaled, it
sticks to the lungs, where it can lead to cancer.''
   The Galileo spacecraft was originally scheduled for launch in
January 1982 but was delayed time and again.
   It is outfitted with two radioisotope thermoelectric generators
to produce the electricity for the spacecraft, science instruments
and engineering support systems. Of the 22 RTGs used on previous
missions, three have been involved in accidents _ one releasing
17,000 curies of radioactive material 75 miles high over the Indian
Ocean.
   The generators use the heat from the radioactive decay of
plutonium-238 dioxide to generate electricity. NASA estimates the
probability of having a launch accident that results in the release
of plutonium into the atmosphere is one in 2,800.
   RTGs similar to the ones on Galileo provided the power for
Voyager 2, which recently sent back spectacular views of the planet
Neptune. Voyager 2, launched in 1977, was the last spacecraft
carrying a nuclear power source.

   Rainshowers canceled a huge shindig to
celebrate the construction of a 30-story pyramid, but organizers
said they would try again after mopping up flooded beer stands and
stages set up for street-party bands.
   The party will go on tonight, weather permitting.
   ``It just got to a point tonight that the decision got taken out
of our hands. It rained so hard that we've got pools of water,''
developer Sidney Shlenkler said Friday.
   Promoters had promised for weeks that the event would be the
biggest party Memphis had ever seen. Police had expected up to
100,000 people, and several thousand would-be revelers showed up
despite the downpour.
   At a luncheon to kick off the celebration, rock 'n' roll pioneer
Dick Clark announced he will supply hundreds of videotapes, films
and other memorabilia for a music museum in the pyramid.
   Clark, who helped popularize rock 'n' roll with his TV show
American Bandstand, said the music hall of fame will be linked to
his annual American Music Awards show and include computerized
displays with recordings and videotapes of the nation's musical past.
   The stainless steel pyramid, which is being built along the
Mississippi River, is intended as the centerpiece of a $200 million
tourist theme park billed as a musical Disneyland and scheduled to
open in May 1991.
   The pyramid and music park are being financed largely through
public funds and developed primarily by Shlenker, who helped develop
the Houston Astrodome, and by international businessman John Tigrett.
   Shlenker likes to compare the pyramid with the Eiffel Tower and
the Statue of Liberty and said he expects the music theme park to
eventually draw up to 3 million tourists a year.

   The attorney for Samuel Pierce says he'll try
to convince a House subcommittee not to subpoena the former housing
secretary, but lawmakers say Pierce's refusal to appear voluntarily
leaves them no choice.
   The chairman of the panel investigating abuses at the Department
of Housing and Urban Development said Friday he would ask members to
approve a subpoena next week. Republicans joined majority Democrats
in saying they would support the request.
   Pierce's attorney, Paul Perito, said he would try to convince the
subcommittee next week to give Pierce two weeks to prepare and then
allow him to testify voluntarily.
   In another development, Rep. Bruce Morrison, D-Conn., asked the
House Judiciary Committee on Friday to ask Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh to name a special prosecutor and have a grand jury
investigate actions at HUD during Pierce's tenure. There was no
immediate action on the request.
   The House Government Operations subcommittee on housing and
employment subcommittee denied Perito's request Friday for a
two-week extension for Pierce to testify.
   ``I am at a loss to understand why there is such a concern for
speed over truth,'' said Perito.
   Pierce told the subcommittee Thursday evening he would not appear
the next morning, prompting a number of verbal attacks from the
panel's members.
   ``We have no option but to proceed in teaching Mr. Pierce that
while he may run, he may not hide,'' said subcommittee Chairman Tom
Lantos, D-Calif.
   ``Not only is Silent Sam silent, apparently today he's also
invisible,'' added Rep. Donald E. ``Buz'' Lukens, R-Ohio, using the
derogatory nickname Pierce acquired for his low-profile demeanor as
secretary during the Reagan administration.
   The subpoena vote is scheduled for Wednesday, but it was unclear
when the panel would demand that Pierce appear.
   Perito said Pierce most likely would comply with any subpoena but
left open the possibility of fighting an order if it gave Pierce
less than two weeks to prepare.
   ``You can be assured that I will consider all options,'' Perito
said.
   The panel is investigating allegations that prominent Republicans
and former HUD officials got favored treatment from the agency under
Pierce, some making huge profits as consultants obtaining
multimillion-dollar federal housing contracts.
   The department also is still unable to account for millions of
dollars in connection with projects and home sales during Pierce's
eight years as secretary. Critics blame poor management.
   Justice Department officials have said more than 1,000
HUD-related cases are being reviewed by U.S. attorneys around the
country, and there have been a handful of criminal and civil cases
filed in recent months.

<HEAD>Agency Upgrades Ford Seat Belt Probe, Opens Others</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN FLESHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government is intensifying its
investigations of possibly defective seat belts in Ford Aerostar
vans and of bus arm rests blamed for injuries to nine people in a
New Jersey accident.
   The National Highway Transportation Safety Administration also
announced a new investigation Friday of Mazda seat belts and 10
other new investigations of cars, mobile homes, utility vehicles and
motorcycles made by Chevrolet, Pontiac, Yamaha, Jeep, Porsche,
Jaguar, Isuzu, Lincoln, Mobile and Kawasaki.
   Such investigations are used to determine whether to order a
recall of the vehicles.
   The agency said it had upgraded its examination of Aerostars
manufactured between 1986 and 1988 from a paperwork analysis to an
engineering analysis, which involves studying the allegedly
defective parts.
   The NHTSA opened a preliminary evaluation in December 1988 after
receiving seven complaints of fraying front-seat, passenger-side
seat belts.
   ``Something sharp is rubbing against the belt, apparently,'' said
agency spokesman Tim Hurd.
   The agency conducted a survey and detected other cases of fraying
but no injuries resulting from the problem, Hurd said, adding,
``We're always concerned about seat belts. They double your chances
of surviving a head-on collision.''
   In Detroit, Ford spokeswoman Joy Stinson said 450,000 Aerostars
were built between 1986 and 1988. Of those, 338,000 were equipped
with a plastic cover that shields the seat belt from contact with
the metal hinge, Ms. Stinson said.
   Belt fraying is believed to be limited to vans without the
plastic cover, which the company began installing in 1987 to protect
the hinge and improve the seat's appearance, she said.
   NHTSA also said it was upgrading to an engineering analysis a
probe of 1988 Motor Coach Industries inter-city buses. The National
Transportation Safety Board requested a preliminary evaluation June
5 after a bus crashed in Tinton Falls, N.J. Nine passengers were
hurt when arm rests broke, leaving sharp edges.
   Also, the agency began a preliminary inquiry into other arm rests
made between 1984 and 1989 by Wakefield International Seating Inc.,
the manufacturer of the Motor Coach Industries seat rests.
   The Mazda probe is of seat belts in all cars the company
manufactured between 1984 and 1989 following 11 complaints of 15
injuries resulting from failure to restrain passengers in accidents.
   NHTSA also reported launching preliminary evaluations of:
   _Breaking buckles on Chevrolet Camaros and Pontiac Firebirds
built in 1984 through 1986. The probe covers an estimated 500,000
cars.
   _Malfunctioning throttle grip sticks on 1989 Yamaha FZR400 and
FZR600 Yamaha motorcycles. The probe covers 10,000 cycles.
   _Malfunctioning rear seat belts in Jeep Cherokees, Wranglers and
Wagoneers. The probe covers the 1984 through 1988 model years.
   _Smoke and fires under the dashboards of 1987 Porsche 924 and
Porsche 944 models covering 7,500 cars.
   _Anti-lock brake system failures in 1987 through 1989 models of
the Jaguar XJ6.
   _Ball-joint failures in 50,000 1988 Isuzu Impulses after three
complaints of collapsed front suspensions causing loss of vehicle
control.
   _Power-steering failure in 1988 Ford Lincoln Continentals,
covering 40,000 cars.
   _Detaching spare tire mounts on Mobile Class A motor homes,
covering about 7,000 vehicles from 1988 and 1989.
   _Detaching handlebars on 1,000 Kawasaki ZX-7 motorcycles from
1989.

<HEAD>Tail of a Turf Battle Over Surf Products</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal government believes it's time to
inspect seafood for safety, but two agencies are arguing over just
who should put the final stamp of approval on the fish.
   Congress is being asked to resolve the turf battle, which comes
down to the question of whether fish are wild animals or should be
treated like the chickens and cattle that are raised for food.
   Almost certain, however, is that the low-fat food source
health-conscious Americans have been turning to in large numbers is
going to come under closer government scrutiny.
   ``Currently many consumers are wary about the safety of fish,''
Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif. ``They have heard many stories about
contamination from toxic industrial and agricultural chemicals,
medical waste products and red tides.''
   Waxman's House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on health and the
environment began considering legislation Friday that would have the
Food and Drug Administration set up a comprehensive federal
inspection program of the seafood industry.
   Contaminants for regular fish and shellfish include the botulism
toxin, ciguatoxin, scombrotroxin, salmonella bacteria and the
hepatitis-A virus, not to mention PCBs and other industrial
contaminants.
   Although everyone at the hearing agreed seafood needs to be
inspected, but Waxman's plan drew criticism from the Agriculture
Department, which wants to bring fish under its meat and poultry
inspection program.
   ``We would not have to start from scratch,'' said Lester
Crawford, administrator of the food safety and inspection service at
the Agriculture Department, noting the experience with meat and
poultry.
   The ``principles of inspection are the same regardless of the
species,'' he said.
   The Agriculture Department has been named as the inspection
agency for fish in legislation since 1986, but Waxman's ``Fish and
Fish Products Safety Act of 1989'' would require the FDA to set
safety standards.
   FDA Commissioner Frank Young said it's simple: fish are not like
chickens and cattle.
   ``Here we are capturing wild animals,'' he said. ``I don't do
this with any kind of turf comparison, but when one looks at the
chicken and beef, these are animals that are raised in standard
ways. They are housed and they are brought to the market in a chain
that is known.''
   Witnesses said that whichever government agency gets the task,
consumer education should be improved because many problems deal
with errors in handling seafood at home.
   Ellen Haas of Public Voice, a non-profit group dealing with food
safety issues, said federal statistics indicate the risk of a food
poisoning outbreak from eating seafood is 25 times greater than from
beef, and 16 times greater than for either chicken or pork.
   Seafood consumption has been increasing as a result of efforts to
find low-fat sources of protein. Young said there have been signs of
a decline, although he said the reason was unclear.

<HEAD>US Urges Other Nations to Take in Soviet Refugees</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department is calling on other
nations to ease the burden on the United States by taking in some of
the recent surge of emigres from the Soviet Union.
   Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger issued the call
Friday as he defended the Bush administration from criticism that a
proposal to allow 50,000 Soviet refugees into the country in the
next year is too conservative.
   ``I resent the implication that we have some heartless,
niggardly, conservative approach to this problem,'' Eagleburger told
the Senate Judiciary subcommittee on immigration.
   ``But there are limits on the numbers we can take,'' he said,
citing budgetary constraints and the press of refugees worldwide
seeking to come to the United States.
   ``No budget deficit, however large, should ever induce the United
States to abandon or compromise in any way its fundamental values
and principles'' of granting safe haven to ``oppressed peoples,''
said Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah.
   Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., chairman of the subcommittee, said
the months of administration deliberations on its Soviet refugees
strategy had given the impression that ``you're dealing with cans of
beans rather than human beings.''
   Some 150,000 applications for entry _ mostly from Jews and some
Pentacostals _ are expected in the 1990 fiscal year. Critics say
that leaves the administration's quota figure too low.
   For nearly 20 years the demand for liberalized Soviet emigration
was a cornerstone of U.S. policy, but ``never was it said that the
U.S. has an obligation to take them all in'' if the gates open,
Eagleburger said.
   He said Western Europe, Israel, Canada and Australia should also
offer entry to the Soviets, although he conceded attempts to enlist
the other countries' help over the past few months had not borne
fruit.
   ``I can't tell you there will be a massive willingness on the
part of other countries,'' he said, ``but we'll continue trying.''
   Under existing procedures, most Soviet emigres leave the Soviet
Union with Israeli visas but change course for the United States
once they reach processing centers in Rome and Vienna. Only about 10
percent to 15 percent go to Israel.
   To save money, the administration will shut down the Rome and
Vienna facilities once it clears up the backlog of an estimated
30,000 applicants there, and process all applicants in Moscow after
Oct. 1, Eagleburger said.

<HEAD>Judge Keeps Alive Suit Over Reagan Computer Files</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge's ruling will help ensure that
presidential records are preserved for future generations, says a
lawyer involved in a suit over Reagan administration computer
records.
   U.S. District Judge Charles Richey on Friday rejected a Bush
administration motion to dismiss the case, saying private citizens
may go to court to keep the government from erasing computer records
dealing with the Iran-Contra affair.
   FBI agents and congressional investigators delving into the
Iran-Contra affair used thousands of messages retrieved from the
system, called PROFS, in piecing together the most far-reaching
scandal of the Reagan administration.
   Former White House aide Oliver North and former national security
adviser John Poindexter used the system, which serves as a
substitute for the telephone.
   Richey's decision ``goes a long way toward ensuring that ...
records produced by the president'' are ``preserved for future
generations so that chapters of history are not lost,'' said
Katherine Meyer, one of the lawyers who filed the case.
   Richey said the Administrative Procedures Act empowers a private
group to seek judicial review of the president's performance under
the Presidential Records Act and the Federal Records Act. He gave
the government and private groups and individuals filing the suit
until Jan. 2 to decide how to proceed.
   The National Security Archive, a non-profit organization, went to
court Jan. 19 after learning the Reagan White House was about to
dispose of the contents of the PROFS computer system.
   On the eve of the change in administrations, a judge temporarily
enjoined the government from destroying the material. It includes
computer tapes of the NSC and the executive office of the president
as well as back-up computer files.
   Justice Department lawyers argue most of the notes aren't
presidential or agency records, but are like telephone messages. The
judge questioned that assertion in a 28-page opinion.
   ``Were telephone conversations in the Executive Branch routinely
taped, a good portion would undoubtedly qualify as presidential or
agency records,'' the judge said.

<HEAD>Author Robert Penn Warren Dead At 84</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STRATTON, Vt. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Robert Penn Warren, who won the Pulitzer
Prize three times for his novels and poetry and was named the
nation's first poet laureate, has died after a three-year battle
with cancer.
   Warren, 84, died early Friday at his summer home. His wife, the
author Eleanor Clark, and a local doctor were with him, said Andrew
King, his longtime friend and Stratton's town clerk and treasurer.
   Services will be private, with a public memorial service
scheduled later, said a spokesman for the Covey and Allen Funeral
Home in Wilmington.
   Warren was the first to win Pulitzer Prizes in both poetry and
fiction. The poetry prizes came in 1957 for ``Promises: Poems
1954-1956,'' and in 1979 for ``Now and Then: Poems 1976-1978.''
   His novel ``All the King's Men,'' a book about the myth
surrounding Huey Long, the swaggering populist governor of
Louisiana, won the Pulitzer in 1947 and became an Academy
Award-winning motion picture.
   His other awards include the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the
National Medal for Literature and the Gold Medal for Poetry from the
American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters. He also was
among the first recipients of the MacArthur Foundation's
unrestricted ``genius grants.''
   Warren was remembered as a brilliant poet, fiction writer,
teacher and critic _ and as a nice man.
   ``He had such vigor and such love of life. He was such wonderful
company _ he was the soul of hilarity,'' said novelist and short
story writer Eudora Welty, whose first work was published in the
Southern Review when Warren was editor in the 1930s. ``He was a good
friend to writers _ constantly generous and giving.''
   ``He was reticent, ironic, reserved and perfectly charming, and I
loved and respected him quite apart from his work,'' said poet
Howard Nemerov, who owns a copy of the first edition of Warren's
first book.
   His fellow writers marveled at his versatility and virtuosity.
   ``He's astounding,'' said poet Robert Bly. ``It's very seldom
that someone can write poetry and fiction and do it well. In
fiction, you take nine or ten generations and compress them; in
poetry, you take 30 seconds and expand it.''
   Born in Guthrie, Ky., on April 24, 1905, Warren grew up hearing
tales of the Civil War from his two grandfathers who had been
Confederate soldiers.
   Warren graduated summa cum laude from Vanderbilt University in
1925, received a master's degree from the University of California
at Berkeley and studied at Oxford University as a Rhodes Scholar.
   While teaching at Louisiana State University, he was a founder of
Southern Review. From 1938 to 1961, he was an editorial adviser to
the Kenyon Review.
   His first full-length novel, published in 1939, was ``Night
Rider,'' about the plight of Kentucky tobacco growers at the turn of
the century.
   Other works included ``At Heaven's Gate,'' ``World Enough and
Time,'' ``Band of Angels,'' ``Wilderness: A Tale of the Civil War,''
and ``Flood: A Romance for Our Time.''
   In 1986, Warren was appointed poet laureate, a largely ceremonial
title created by Congress.
   ``The people who create these posts don't give a damn about
poetry,'' Warren said of the appointment. ``They do it because it's
a nice thing to do. They think `There's a poet down the road; let's
make him a poet laureate.'''
   Warren lived the last three decades of his life in New England.
   Before his second marriage, to Ms. Clark, she had suggested that
they return to the South so that their children would know his world.
   ``But I discovered it wasn't the same world,'' Warren once said.
``I had been carrying a dream around in my head.''

   Makel Wright's night away from his usual
position in front of the TV set saved him from being hit by a
runaway fire truck.
   The 11-year-old Gainesville boy likes to spend each night playing
the Nintendo game on a television set in his bedroom. But Thursday,
his older brother took the television to college with him,
interrupting Makel's nocturnal habit.
   The boy was in another room when the truck crashed through the
bedroom wall Thursday night, his mother said.
   ``This is a miracle,'' said Clairese Wright. ``It demolished my
baby's room. Thank God he was not in bed. I thank you Jesus that
child was not in that bed.''
   Police Capt. Bill Taylor said the fire truck answered a call on a
steep hill near the Wright's home in Gainesville, about 40 miles
northeast of Atlanta.
   Fireman Boone Simmons said he was spraying the fire when he felt
his fire hose jerk. He and some bystanders chased the vehicle, which
rolled down the street, crashed into the Wrights' car, plunged
through their front porch and rammed into the house.
   It wasn't the first time a vehicle had smashed into the Wrights'
house. Last April, a car ran into their porch.

   On a sun-drenched day, Exxon pulled out its
cleanup crews for the winter and the state announced its own plan to
protect fish hatcheries and untainted areas from the Exxon Valdez
oil spill.
   ``It's a nice day for the first day of winter, isn't it?'' Gov.
Steve Cowper said Friday before he announced the state's plans for a
$21 million program ``to continue cleanup work left by Exxon.''
   But for that bit of sarcasm, and a crack by his spokesman about a
``dirty dozen of soiled beaches'' left by Exxon, Cowper was
conciliatory toward the oil company responsible for the March 24
tanker wreck that left 10.9 million gallons of crude oil in Prince
William Sound.
   The governor thanked the thousands of workers who helped scrub
the oil-fouled shorelines, proclaiming Friday ``Oil Spill Workers
Appreciation Day'' in Alaska.
   Exxon pulled the crews out Friday, saying Alaska's early winter
makes continuing field work too risky.
   ``I think Exxon has made a good-faith effort to clean up the
beaches,'' Cowper said. ``I'm not going to fault Exxon here. They
made some mistakes and, frankly, some of the things the state has
done were mistakes.''
   Cowper said the state should have known how to clean up a major
spill. ``At least we should have known no one else knew how to do
it,'' he said.
   Alaska's winter program, announced on a warm fall day when
residents donned T-shirts and shorts, calls for:
   _Small-scale cleanups when fish and wildlife resources are
threatened by the remaining oil.
   _Monitoring the oil's movement and changes in its composition
during the region's severe winter months.
   _Research and development of new ways to remove the remaining
oil, most of which lies under the surface of rocky shorelines.
   _Protecting the region's five fish hatcheries with standby
equipment and crews.
   _Forming a strike force of counselors and mental-health
professionals to help prevent and treat stress-related problems,
such as drug and alcohol abuse, in spill-affected towns.
   Money for the program will come from the state's new
5-cent-a-barrel oil-spill response tax. Cowper said Exxon eventually
will be billed for reimbursement.
   While Cowper had little negative to say about Exxon, he showed
reporters a seven-minute, state-produced video that focused on the
oiled shores the company has vacated. On a nearby table were oiled
rocks taken this week from what a Cowper spokesman said were soiled
beaches.
   Exxon spokesman Henry Beathard said later that the beaches where
surface oil remains visible were the last treated with a chemical
fertilizer. The fertilizer, which stimulates the oil-eating action
of microorganisms, takes up to six weeks to work.
   State environmental officials are worried about the subsurface
oil. They fear winter storms and tidal action will loosen that oil,
resulting in small slicks that will pollute other areas.
   Although Exxon has promised to monitor the oil and respond to
emergencies during the fall and winter, Cowper said it remained
unclear to what extent the company will work with the state.
   Exxon has said it will re-evaluate the shorelines next spring and
decide then whether to resume the cleanup on a large scale.
   The governor noted that some biologists alleged recently that
Exxon's cleanup, which employed as many as 12,000 workers, may have
done more environmental harm than good.
   ``That may be,'' Cowper said. ``But what was Exxon going to do?
Not only was everyone barking at them to get it done, including us,
they had a public relations problem.''

<HEAD>Kelly Urges Arabs To Drop Campaign Against Israel</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A senior State Department official is calling
on the Arab governments to abandon their efforts to expel Israel
from the United Nations.
   That ``change in tactics'' could contribute to attempts to
arrange negotiations between the Arabs and Israel, John H. Kelly,
assistant secretary of state for the Near East, said Friday night.
   ``It is time for the Arab nations to follow the example of the
PLO and acknowledge Israel's existence as a state. Israel is
entitled to membership in the United Nations under the principle of
universality,'' Kelly said in a speech before a conference on the
Middle East at Wye Plantation in Maryland.
   He referred to the step taken last year by Palestine Liberation
Organization chairman Yasser Arafat, who also publicly renounced
terrorism. That action met U.S. conditions for the dialogue opened
by the United States with the PLO last December.
   ``It is time for the Arab governments to stop the anachronistic
practice of voting against Israeli credentials,'' Kelly said.
   The Arabs have consistently failed to oust Israel from the United
Nations despite annual attempts.

   An improved computer network could make the
huge store of information in the Library of Congress available to
libraries and scholars across the country, says the nation's chief
librarian.
   ``The Library of Congress and the national library community want
to help develop a national research and education network,'' James
H. Billington, the librarian of Congress, told a Senate subcommittee
Friday.
   ``The major information resources for this nation reside in the
Library of Congress and other research libraries across the country.
These collections have been assembled in many cases with federal,
state and local revenues.
   ``Our citizens have a right to expect that these irreplaceable
intellectual resources be made ever more widely available through a
national information network,'' he said.
   Billington testified in favor of a bill sponsored by Sen. Al
Gore, D-Tenn., which calls for the establishment of national
computer-based research network. Gore chairs the Senate Commerce
science subcommittee, which held Friday's hearing.
   The Library of Congress, with 88 million items, is the largest
collection of recorded and printed information ever assembled in a
single place, Billington said.

<NOTE>Administration Retreats On Plan To Aid Ortega's Foes</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration has bowed to
congressional pressure and abandoned its idea of aiding the
presidential election campaign of Nicaraguan opposition leader
Violetta Chamorro through a U.S.-financed private organization.
   While the National Endowment for Democracy should play an active
role in ensuring a free and fair election, the United States will
not ask the group to go beyond election activities permitted by its
charter, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said Friday.
   Chamorro is campaigning to defeat Daniel Ortega, the Nicaraguan
president, in a national election next February. All U.S. efforts,
including past weapons shipments to anti-government rebels known as
Contras, have failed to unseat the Sandinista leader.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III ran into stiff opposition
when he sounded out members of Congress earlier this week about
providing around $2 million in U.S. funds to Chamorro, the publisher
of the leading opposition newspaper, La Prensa, through the
endowment.
   Boucher said the group's charter permits it ``to support election
activities in a general sense. We don't intend to ask it to do
anything that's beyond its charter.''
   The group gets its money from Congress.

   The federal drug-fighting budget for 1990
should be increased by $5 billion to $6 billion over the
administration's proposed $7.9 billion and taxes should be raised to
pay for it, says National League of Cities President Terry Goddard.
   Goddard, the Democratic mayor of Phoenix, Ariz., said Friday he
knows of no other way to get the new resources needed.
   The administration strategy will call on state and local
governments to spend $10 billion to $12 billion for drug testing and
prisons next year alone.
   ``We believe that an equivalent resource from the federal
government has got to be committed,'' Goddard said.
   He said he is asking municipal leaders to lobby Capitol Hill,
where some members of Congress already are balking at a proposal by
Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., to increase the $7.9 billion by $2.2
billion.

   A strong earthquake rocked the Soviet Union's
Caspian Sea area early today, cracking some buildings but apparently
causing no serious damage or injuries, seismologists reported.
   The quake occurred at 6:05 a.m. and was centered in the Caspian
Sea about 110 miles east of Baku, the capital of Soviet Azerbaijan,
said Nadezhda Molchanova, a spokeswoman for the Obninsk Seismic
Station near Moscow.
   The Caspian Sea separates the Caucasus Mountain region and Soviet
Central Asia, two active seismic areas. A powerful quake Dec. 7 in
western Armenia, about 370 miles west of today's quake, killed
25,000 people.
   Monitors at the U.S. National Earthquake Information Service in
Golden, Colo., measured the quake at 6.6 on the Richter scale. The
Armenian earthquake registered 6.9 on the Richter scale, a gauge of
the energy released by a temblor, as measured by the ground motion
recorded on a seismograph.
   A quake measuring 6 can cause severe damage and a temblor
measuring 7 can cause widespread, heavy damage.
   Ms. Molchanova said there were no immediate reports of
casualties. She said the quake registered 7 on the Soviet earthquake
scale in Krasnovodsk, a city on the eastern shore of the Caspian Sea
in Soviet Turkmenia.
   The Soviet scale is based on observable effects of an earthquake.
A quake registering 7 is regarded as ``very strong,'' capable of
making cracks in stone walls.
   It registered at 5 in Baku, strong enough to wake the sleeping
and shake furniture.

said.
   The Beechcraft BE-10 apparently was headed for a landing at the
Mayfield-Graves County airport when it crashed northeast of the

crash.
   ``This is a real nasty night,'' said the dispatcher, who declined
to be identified.
   She said the plane was arriving from Florida, but had no details.
   The victims were identified as pilot John Haag, of Georgia; and
Mayfield residents Charles Yancey and his wife, Belinda; Terry
Sanders and his wife, Melissa, and the Rev. Charles Nelson. The

<TEXT>
   Architect I.M. Pei and painters Willem De Kooning
and David Hockney were among the first six winners of the Praemium
Imperiale, a new award from Japan that a leading philanthropist
compared to Nobel prizes.
   The other winners of the honor, which comes with $100,000, were
Italian sculptor Umberto Mastroianni, film director Marcel Carne and
conductor Pierre Boulez, both of France.
   ``These prizes will come to be perceived as a supplement to the
Nobel Prize and will soon assume in the arts the stature of the
Nobel awards in other fields,'' said David Rockefeller, former
chairman and chief executive officer of Chase Manhattan Bank,
chairman of the Museum of Modern Art and a member of an advisory
panel for the awards.
   Prince Masahito Hitachi, brother of the emperor and governor of
the Japan Art Association, which gives the awards, will present them
in Tokyo on Oct. 27.
   A luncheon to announce the winners was attended by Pei, a
naturalized U.S. citizen born in China, and Lisa De Kooning,
daughter of the painter, a naturalized U.S. citizen born in Holland.
   ``I'm numb and I really don't know what to think or how to
feel,'' said Pei. ``It has to be `the' award, as far as I'm
concerned. ... But it does put a lot of burden on those of us who
are nominated.''
   Seiji Tanaka, Japan Art Association coordinator, said about 50 or
60 nominations were received.
   Tanaka said it was coincidental that all the winners are male and
American or European. In addition, he said, the award categories may
be changed next year _ to make theater and film separate categories,
for instance.
   The prize is funded primarily by Fujisankei Communications
International, a media corporation. Fujisankei founder Nobutaka
Shikanai is chairman of the Japan Art Association, founded in the
19th Century.
   The association selected the winners based on recommendations
from the International Committee of Advisers, which included
Rockefeller, former prime ministers Jacques Chirac of France, Edward
Heath of Britain and Amintore Fanfani of Italy and former West
German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt.
   Each adviser had his own method of coming up with nominations,
said Ned Steele, a publicist for the event.
   In the United States, Rockefeller asked Schuyler Chapin, former
dean of the Columbia University School of Arts, to recruit a
committee to give him recommendations. That committee included
Broadway composer Stephen Sondheim, New York Times art critic John
Russell, Yale Drama School Dean Lloyd Richards, former Smithsonian
Secretary S. Dillon Ripley and former CBS President Frank Stanton.

<HEAD>Colombian Suspects Under Tighter Guard After Weapons Case Linked
to Them</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FREDERICTON, New Brunswick (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two Colombians accused of drug
smuggling have been moved to a more secure prison after being linked
to five heavily armed South Americans who were arrested near the
Maine border, officials said.
   Authorities on Friday declined to say if the five men, arrested
Wednesday, had planned to interfere with court proceedings for the
Colombians.
   But asked if the two cases were related, Inspector Al Hutchinson
of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in Fredericton said, ``That's
correct.''
   ``We've re-evaluated the situation between the two groups,'' he
said without elaborating.
   Hutchinson said the connection prompted police to move the
Colombians from the Fredericton jail to a more secure prison within
the province. He would not say which prison.
   At a court hearing in Fredericton Thursday, the two were ordered
held for trial next month on charges of smuggling a half-ton of
cocaine in the nose of an airplane. It was the largest seizure of
cocaine by Canadian police.
   The five South Americans, arrested in Edmunston, 125 miles
northwest of Fredericton, had Venezuelan passports.
   But in Washington, Frank Shults of the U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration said two were `known to be Colombians.''
   The agency sent several agents to Canada on Friday to discuss the
case with Canadian authorities, Shults said.
   Fredericton police said they were seeking up to three others in
the case.
   Canadian police ruled out suggestions the five arrested were
hired killers sent by Colombian drug traffickers to murder U.S. or
Canadian officials or to attack President Bush's vacation home in
Kennebunkport, Maine.
   In Washington late Friday, Secret Service spokeswoman Jane
Vezeris said, ``We do not believe it has anything to do with threats
to individuals in this country.''
   The United States has sent Colombia $65 million in aid, including
military equipment, for its month-old crackdown on the nation's drug
cartels, which provide most of the cocaine sold in the United States.
   Canadian and American officials say the cartels increasingly are
smuggling drugs through Canada's maritime provinces because the
United States has tightened its borders.
   When Mounted Police and Edmundston authorities arrested four of
the South American men, a search of their vehicles uncovered an Uzi
submachine gun, Soviet and Israeli assault rifles and 3,000 rounds
of ammunition. Also seized were six automatic pistols, a .22-caliber
pistol, tear gas, a deactivated Japanese grenade and an electric zap
gun used to knock people out.
   On Friday, police led the four handcuffed into a heavily guarded
provincial court in Edmundston, where they were charged with a
variety of weapons offenses.
   ``Innocent, innocent. Je suis innocent,'' one of the men told
reporters outside the courthouse.
   ``No speak English,'' said another.
   Authorities have identified the four as Tito Sanchez, Euovio
Manzano, Osvaldo Gonzales and Wilmer Ramon Zanabria. Court documents
did not contain their ages or hometowns.
   They were being held for bail hearings set for Tuesday.
   A fifth man, William Jose Rodriguez of Caracas, Venezuela, was
arrested Thursday in another provincial city. He was charged Friday
in Saint John with possessing two .22-caliber handguns. Authorities
said they expected to charge him later with an immigration offense.
   Rodriguez was being held until a bail hearing Monday.
   The Colombians accused of cocaine trafficking, Jose Ali
Galindo-Escobar and Fernando Augusto Mendoza-Jaramillo, both 36,
were arrested in April after police found about 1,100 pounds of the
drug inside the nose of an airplane at a makeshift airstrip outside
Fredericton.

<TEXT>
   McDonnell Douglas Corp. says it will make
changes in its DC-10 jetliners to guard against failure of all three
hydraulic systems, the ``one in a billion'' condition in a DC-10
crash in Iowa that killed 112 people.
   The modifications were greeted warmly Friday by James B. Busey,
the head of the Federal Aviation Administration.
   ``The system design changes proposed by McDonnell Douglas ... are
a solid step forward in assuring there will be no repeat of the July
19 accident,'' Busey said in a statement issued in Washington, D.C.
   ``Once these design changes are in place, they will raise the
already high safety standards required of the DC-10 and, in effect,
make a good airplane even better.''
   The three hydraulic systems on the DC-10 are designed to operate
independently and to back each other up in case one fails. Unlike
some other plane models, the 400 or so DC-10s in use around the
world have no backup system if the hydraulic lines fail to control
the wing and tail mechanisms that steer the plane.
   ``We view the new enhancements as extra safety equipment similar
to the installation of air bags in automobiles _ additional measures
to protect occupants besides the lap belts, shoulder harnesses,
padded dashboards, etc.,'' said Dale Warren, a vice president of
Douglas Aircraft Co.
   Warren, who headed the company's investigation of the Sioux City,
Iowa, crash, said Friday modifications will include:
   _An electrically operated shutoff valve that will be installed in
the supply line and a check valve in the return line of the No. 3
hydraulic system.
   _A check valve installed in the No. 3 hydraulic reservoir.
   _A cockpit light added to alert the crew if the shutoff valve is
activated.
   The new fast-acting shutoff valve, located just behind the back
wall of the cabin, will close automatically and the cockpit light
will come on if a sensor detects hydraulic fluid dropping below a
preset level in the reservoir.
   Even if all three hydraulic systems are affected by severe damage
to the tail section, as happened in Sioux City, the valve will stop
fluid flow through the No. 3 system, Warren said.
   With adequate hydraulic pressure preserved in that system, the
crew should have enough control to fly the plane to a safe landing,
he said.
   In the July crash, the tail engine on the DC-10 disintegrated,
knocking out all three hydraulic systems _ an event with a ``one in
a billion'' chance of occurring, according to a McDonnell Douglas
release Friday.
   The pilot lost virtually all control of the plane, which exploded
in flames in a corn field after cartwheeling down the runway.
   Douglas Aircraft Co., a division of McDonnell Douglas based in
Long Beach, manufactured the DC-10s, which will eventually be
replaced by the more advanced but similar MD-11s.
   McDonnell spokeswoman Elayne Bendel said in a telephone interview
that the company had yet to decide whether to make the same
modifications to its MD-11s.

   Miss Oklahoma will compete in
tonight's Miss America Pageant despite suffering a concussion from a
beer bottle thrown during a beauty parade, officials said.
   Tamara Denise Toshiko Marler, 26, of Tulsa, was riding in the
glitzy Miss America Parade down the famed Boardwalk Friday night
when the bottle hit her in the forehead, said pageant director
Leonard Horn.
   ``It was obviously some malicious moron who hoped he could hit
something, and obviously he did,'' he said.
   Miss Marler spent Friday night at the Atlantic City Medical
Center, where she was being treated for the concussion and a slight
bruise to her forehead, said hospital spokeswoman Sherry Spatz.
   ``If everything is OK as we expect it to be, she'll be back'' for
the pageant, Horn said.
   The bottle did not cut Miss Marler, said Atlantic City police
Detective Sgt. Sam Rando, who was with her in the emergency room.
   ``She was very calm,'' he said. ``She was aware of everything
that was going on, answering the doctors who were asking her
questions.''
   But later, Miss Marler became dizzy when doctors asked her to
walk around the emergency room, Ms. Spatz said.
   If Miss Marler is able to compete tonight, doctors ``may,
depending on her condition, ask her to refrain from wearing high
heels,'' Ms. Spatz said.
   The incident occurred around 9 p.m. as the convertible Miss
Marler was riding in passed Texas Avenue. Miss Marler told the
doctors that she did not black out when struck by the bottle.
   Pageant officials delivered several large bouquets of flowers to
Miss Marler's room. Her mother spent the night with her in the
hospital, Horn said.
   Miss Marler became a likely top-10 semi-finalist after winning a
preliminary talent competition on Wednesday. She sang an
audience-grabbing rendition of ``Since I Fell For You.''
   A recent marketing graduate of the University of Tulsa, she hopes
someday to become a lawyer.
   Horn said the decision to switch the parade from Tuesday to
Friday did not change the mood of the crowd, but he said he might
reconsider the parade's future after the incident with Miss Marler.
   In past years, some contestants have been injured in the parade
by slipping or falling, but there has never been an incident as
serious as the bottle-throwing, Horn said.
   Several thousand people turned out to watch the parade.

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NYNEX Corp. and its striking workers broke off
contract talks early this morning after a day of on-again, off-again
negotiations to end the six-week strike.
   ``Nothing was resolved, and no more negotiating sessions have
been scheduled,'' said Adele Stacy of Local 2222 of the
International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers.
   Negotiators for the telephone company and the IBEW met
intermittently Friday morning and afternoon, and union leaders said
the company appeared to be pushing to reach a settlement by
midnight. But the talks at Boston's Park Plaza Hotel ended
fruitlessly at 12:25 a.m.
   Earlier in the day, ebullient union leaders addressing 700
strikers at a rally outside New England Telephone Co.'s headquarters
in Boston said the six-week strike had been significantly
strengthened by a Massachusetts ruling that the workers would be
entitled to unemployment benefits starting next week.
   Myles Calvey, head of the International Brotherhood of Electrical
Workers Local 2222, estimated that unemployment payments for 12,000
Massachusetts workers would cost the telephone company $9 million
per week.
   Calvey and Steve Early, spokesman for the Communications Workers
of America, said the ruling Wednesday by the state Division of
Employment and training had caused the company to push for a rapid
settlement.
   NYNEX reportedly made concessions on safety and insurance issues
this week in its talks with the IBEW and the CWA, which together
represent 62,000 striking workers at NYNEX companies in New York and
New England.
   Workers walked out Aug. 6 after NYNEX asked them to start paying
$10.27 a week toward health insurance. For nearly 20 years, the
company had paid 100 percent of the insurance premiums.
   Job security, safety, wages and benefits are also on the
bargaining table, but both sides have said health care is the key
issue.
   ``It was our hope that (the strike) would have ended sooner,''
said Robert O'Brien, spokesman for NYNEX in New York. ``Our hope is
that we'll find a way out of this. We know our workers want to come
back to work.''
   NYNEX is the only one of the nation's seven ``Baby Bell''
regional telephone operating companies that still has not reached a
settlement with its workers. Employees of Bell Atlantic, Pacific
Telesis and Ameritech struck last month but reached agreements.
   Beginning next week, the more than 40,000 NYNEX strikers in New
York also will be eligible for unemployment compensation, said Early.
   Union leaders introduced a plan to help support 6,000 strikers in
other New England states who are not eligible for unemployment
benefits.

   A science writer underwent brain surgery
after being shot during a dispute with his female companion, a
hospital spokeswoman said.
   Thomas Heppenheimer, 42, author of several science books
including ``Earthquake'' and ``Man-Made Son,'' was in stable
condition late Friday, said Nancy Rhomburg, nursing supervisor for
the University of California, Irvine Medical Center.
   He had been listed in critical condition Thursday, following
surgery for two gunshot wounds to the head and a wound to the
shoulder, but was stabilized by Friday, Ms. Rhomburg said.
   Police believe Angela Lee Johnson shot Heppenheimer at the home
they shared in nearby Fountain Valley after he tried to attack her
with a 3-foot-long rod.
   Johnson, 30, who said she has lived with Heppenheimer for 10
years, was questioned by police and later released, said Fountain
Valley Police Lt. Mike Hanrahan.
   ``There is a strong case for self-defense,'' Hanrahan said.
   No charges have been filed, he said. The Orange County District
Attorney's Office is reviewing the case.
   Heppenheimer worked at the California Institute of Technology in
Pasadena in the 1970s before turning to science writing, institute
spokesman Bob Finn said.

   Leftist rebels and the Salvadoran government
have agreed to monthly peace talks aimed at ending nearly a decade
of civil war.
   After negotiators announced the agreement in Mexico City Friday,
an estimated 10,000 Salvadorans marched in their capital in support
of the plan.
   The guerrilla group, Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front,
said it hoped ``that 1990 will be the year of the war's final end.''
   ``The blood that has been spilled in the longest and most costly
conflict on the continent, all this blood that has been spilled,
deserves this,'' rebel leader Shafick Handal said at a news
conference in Mexico City.
   Since the fighting began in 1979, 70,000 Salvadorans have been
killed.
   In San Salvador, President Alfredo Cristiani called the agreement
important but said: ``While welcoming the dialogue process, we don't
want to create false expectations.''
   ``We want to reiterate that our attitude is one of openness and
flexibility within our constitutional framework ... We know the road
ahead is difficult and complex,'' he told an Independence Day rally.
   The rebels and the rightist government agreed to meet next in San
Jose, the Costa Rican capital, on Oct. 16-17 and once a month
thereafter.
   They agreed that two representatives from the Roman Catholic
Church will mediate the talks and that they will also invite the
United Nations and the Organization of American States to send
observers.
   The Cristiani government initially opposed church mediation or
outside observers. It had also proposed meeting the guerrillas every
two months instead of once a month.
   The pact, reached after two days of talks, also stipulates that
neither side can unilaterally withdraw from the negotiations and
that each delegation will have authority to reach binding accords.
   The Mexico City talks were the first in two years between the
government and rebels; they were also the first meeting between the
guerrillas and Cristiani's administration.
   The rebels have already laid out their peace proposal. The
government is to present its plan in October.
   The rebels are offering to lay down their arms and form a legal
political party in exchange for sweeping social and political
reforms. They dropped previous demands for power sharing and for
merging the rebel and government armies.
   Most of the civil war's victims have been civilians. Human rights
groups and international organizations say many were killed by
right-wing death squads linked to the military and Cristiani's
party, links the party denies.
   Washington has provided more than $3.5 billion in military and
economic aid to El Salvador this decade, making it Latin America's
biggest single recipient of American assistance.
   For the first time since the civil war started in 1979,
Salvadoran authorities staged an Independence Day military parade
through their capital on Friday. About 3,000 troops from the three
military branches and the three militarized police forces marched to
music by military bands.
   Crowds lined the parade route, which followed a route different
from that of the peace march. But the peace marchers appeared to
attract more people, who waved white flags and blue-and-white
national banners and chanted slogans hailing the peace talk
agreement.
   The march was sponsored by the National Debate for Peace, an
umbrella organization comprising about 70 church, union, student and
humanitarian organizations.

   The Secret Service increased security for
President Bush's daughter but refused to say why.
   Reporters on Friday saw several agents escorting Dorothy Bush
LeBlond, who usually travels without security, from her office at
the Greater Portland Chamber of Commerce into a parked vehicle.
   Agents who had been at the building since noon indicated they
would continue their surveillance at the LeBlond home in Cape
Elizabeth.
   A woman at the home, however, said throughout the evening that
the president's daughter was not there and would take calls at her
office in the morning.
   Secret servicemen declined to comment on any connection between
the increased surveillance and reported threats against U.S.
officials by Colombian drug lords.
   ``I can't comment on that,'' spokeswoman Jane Vezeris said,
citing a Secret Service policy of not commenting on operational
matters. But she added:
   ``Something happened up there today, incident is too strong a
word, that caused the Secret Service to take action. ... We're
looking at it.''
   She said it was best described as a ``local police matter.''
   White House spokesman Roman Popadiuk also declined to respond on
grounds that the White House doesn't comment on security matters.

<HEAD>Rare Bird Sighting on Remote Islands Starts Travel Scramble</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SUMBURGH, Shetland Islands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of British bird
spotters headed for the Shetland Islands after their Birdline
telephone information service reported the presence of a rare great
knot wading bird.
   The bird spotters, nicknamed twitchers and armed with powerful
binoculars, telescopes and expensive cameras, compete among
themselves to log sightings of rare birds around Britain.
   The great knot is an Asian bird measuring just over 10 inches in
length.
   Birdline reported that one was seen Friday at a spot called the
Pool of Virkie near Sumburgh airport on the southern tip of the
remote Shetland Islands, 100 miles off Scotland.
   The British domestic news agency Press Association reported that
it was the first recorded sighting of a Great Knot in Britain and
only the fourth for the whole of Europe.
   The news agency said previous European sightings were in Spain in
1979 and Denmark and East Germany in 1987.
   Birdline said the great knot is thought to have been blown off
course by easterly winds while migrating from its breeding grounds
5,000 miles away in northeast Siberia to its winter range, mainly in
southern China, Indonesia and Australia.
   Many bird watchers were expected to be frustrated in their bid to
reach the Shetland Islands by the weekend.
   One veteran twitcher, Ian Mills, from Whitburn in northeast
England, reported: ``The word has gone round that all flights to
Shetland tomorrow (Saturday) are booked solid so it looks as if the
majority of us will miss out this weekend.
   ``It's very frustrating that such a crowd-pulling bird should
have turned up at such a hard-to-get-to place.
   ``This is one of those once-in-a-lifetime opportunities. If it
had appeared on mainland Britain, thousands of people would have
been along to see it.''

<TEXT>
   An international symposium on peace and security
through nuclear disarmament in the Asia-Pacific region opened today
with criticism that the region was lagging behind efforts in Europe,
officials said.
   Meeting spokesman Kenichi Nakamura said 31 scientists from 12
countries, including the United States, Soviet Union and Britain,
were meeting at the Pugwash Conference.
   It was started 34 years ago in Pugwash, Canada, at the suggestion
of Albert Einstein.
   Discussions at the meetings, most of which are closed sessions,
will focus on political and economic issues and how they effect
prospects for nuclear disarmament in the Asia-Pacific region,
Kenichi said.
   Yoshikazu Sakamoto, a professor at Tokyo's Meiji Gakuin
University, said during a keynote speech that the nuclear
disarmament movement in Europe has worked much harder than that of
the Asia-Pacific region.
   The major focus in the region has been disarmament at sea, which
is more difficult to accomplish than on land, he said.
   Sakamoto said disarmament would promote economic growth and
contribute to democratization of the Third World.
   Following three days of closed meetings, participating scientists
will report on the outcome of the conference Tuesday.

<HEAD>Environmentalists Ask Cuomo to Cancel Love Canal Resettlement</HEAD>

   Environmentalists are awaiting Gov. Mario
Cuomo's decision on the resettlement of the neighborhood around the
Love Canal toxic dump, saying his choice could set a national
precedent.
   ``Love Canal is not a local New York issue,'' said Penny Newman
of California's Concerned Neighbors in Action. ``It will set a
precedent for the rest of us who are living near these dump sites.''
   Newman was one of about 200 protesters who gathered outside the
state Capitol Friday night with hopes of persuading Cuomo to stop
the resettlement.
   ``If the government can get away with resettling Love Canal _ one
of the most notorious dump sites in the country _ then what do the
rest of us have to expect?'' she said.
   ``Let us learn a lesson from Love Canal and not repeat our
mistakes,'' said Lois Gibbs, the former Love Canal housewife who led
the fight 11 years ago to get people removed from the area.
   The demonstrators sang, prayed, chanted and listened to speeches.
One of the speakers was former resident Luella Kenny, whose
7-year-old son died of kidney disease.
   ``Next Tuesday ... there's young man that should've turned 18
years old ... that should've started college this year,'' said
Kenny. ``He never had that opportunity because he lived in Love
Canal. He played in his backyard with those chemicals.''
   The protesters draped the fence of the Executive Mansion with red
ribbon adorned with more than 5,000 letters to Cuomo, urging him to
stop the Love Canal resettlement, planned for next year.
   Occidental Chemical Corp., owner of the former Hooker Chemical
and Plastic Co. which used Love Canal as a waste dump, acknowledges
that 20,000 tons of chemicals were dumped there in the 1940s and
1950s.
   The dump was eventually closed and a school and playground were
built above it. Hundreds of homes were built in a surrounding
suburb, which President Carter declared a federal disaster area in
1978.
   Today, about 70 homes in Love Canal are occupied by people who
chose not to flee with most of their neighbors in 1978. Much of the
chemical contamination remains in a giant fenced-in mound at the
center of the neighborhood.
   Last fall, Dr. David Axelrod, the state health commissioner,
ruled that two-thirds of the 10-block Love Canal neighborhood was
suitable for resettlement after years of work to contain or treat
the toxic contamination from the dump site.

   A printing plant worker apparently started
buying up the high-powered arsenal he used to kill seven co-workers
at the same time he quit his job because of mental illness,
authorities said.
   Police said Joseph T. Wesbecker was armed with several
semiautomatic weapons and hundreds of rounds of ammunition Thursday
morning as he went from floor to floor at the Standard Gravure Corp.
   Wesbecker, 47, killed seven people and injured 13 before killing
himself. Three of the injured were in critical condition Friday
night.
   The first funeral for a victim of the massacre was to be held
today in Louisville. The victim, James F. Wible Sr., will be buried
Monday in Forreston, Ill.
   Police searched Wesbecker's home Thursday night and found the
Feb. 6 issue of Time magazine open to a detailed article on similar
shootings across the United States in the past two years, said Lt.
Jeff Moody, police homicide commander.
   Before he quit working, Wesbecker apparently owned only less
powerful weapons. But on Aug. 26, 1988 _ less than three weeks after
he quit _ Wesbecker purchased a semiautomatic 9mm pistol from
Archery World &amp; Guns in Louisville. Police said he used that gun to
kill himself.
   Two MAC-11 semiautomatic machine pistols were purchased last Feb.
10 _ four days after the Time article came out _ at Tilford's Gun
Sales in Louisville. He bought an AK-47 assault rifle on May 1.
   Meanwhile, state Rep. Mike Ward, D-Louisville, said he would
sponsor a bill in the General Assembly to ban assault weapons in
Kentucky.
   ``We owe it to the families and the other victims to try at least
to make it harder for a deranged person to obtain the weapon,'' Ward
said.
   Nearly 90 percent of Standard Gravure's 360 employees met with
grief counselors when they returned to the plant Friday morning.
Several hundred later attended a Mass at the Roman Catholic
Cathedral of the Assumption.
   The plant's offices had been cleaned up overnight. Bullet holes
in walls and ceilings were the only physical reminders of the
tragedy.
   Wesbecker was a pressman at the plant from 1971 until he quit on
Aug. 8, 1988. The company placed him on long-term disability last
Feb. 2 because of his mental problems _ meaning he could never work
at the plant again.
   Relatives told police that Wesbecker was a manic depressive who
had attempted suicide three times.
   Wesbecker paid $349 for the AK-47 without revealing his mental
problems on a federal form required for such purchases, said Jack
Tilford, owner of Tilford's, and federal officials. About two weeks
after he picked it up, Wesbecker returned and bought about a case of
ammunition _ 1,100 rounds _ for $139, Tilford said.
   Tilford said Wesbecker answered all eight questions properly on a
federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms gun purchase form.
   Moody said Wesbecker had spent time _ voluntarily _ in mental
institutions, including Our Lady of Peace in Louisville. Police
would not reveal when he had been hospitalized.

<TEXT>
   Two students at a rural high school that
President Bush visited early in his anti-drug campaign have been
arrested on drug charges, officials said.
   A spokeswoman for the Lancaster County Drug Task Force said
Friday the students, both 17-year-old girls, were arrested Thursday
at their homes and have been turned over to juvenile authorities.
The students' names were not released because of their ages.
   One was charged with two counts of delivery and one count of
possession with intent to deliver LSD, according to the spokeswoman,
who spoke on condition of anonymity. The youth had 579 doses with a
street value of $4 each.
   The second youth was charged with criminal conspiracy to deliver
marijuana and had about a quarter pound of the drug, the spokeswoman
said.
   The spokeswoman said the two were arrested as part of a two-month
undercover operation.
   ``We just happened to be doing our investigation and (the youths)
just became involved,'' she said. ``It did not center on the high
school.''
   Bush spoke to about 3,000 students at Conestoga Valley High
School in March and stressed the threat drugs pose to rural areas.
   The youths were selling drugs to people throughout Lancaster
County, known for its large population of Amish, mostly to users in
their late teens or early 20s, the spokeswoman said.

   Mother Teresa was feeling better today
after a persistent fever disappeared, said a Roman Catholic nun at
the mission founded by the Nobel laureate in Calcutta's slums.
   But doctors still were trying to find the cause of an infection
that posed a new danger to Mother Teresa, 79, as she tried to
recover from a heart attack, said the nun, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Nonetheless, the nun said, ``She is feeling much better today.
The fever is gone and her temperature is normal.''
   A statement issued by doctors at Woodlands Nursing Home, the
hospital where she was admitted nearly two weeks ago, said Mother
Teresa's condition had improved and that she was responding to
treatment and ``resting calmly.''
   But Dr. Vincenzo Bilotta, a heart specialist from Rome and a
longtime friend of Mother Teresa, said her condition remained
serious.
   ``Her heart is very weak. The infection is now posing a new
danger to her,'' said Bilotta, who treated Mother Teresa for a
similar ailment in 1985.
   Dr. George Lombardi, an infectious disease specialist from
Cornell University in New York, said doctors were trying to find the
cause.
   ``We are doing everything possible but could not yet diagnose
it,'' he said. Lombardi and Bilotta flew to Calcutta earlier in the
week to help with the treatment.
   Mother Teresa developed chest pains and a high fever Thursday
just as doctors thought she was progressing well.
   She was admitted to the hospital Sept. 5 with an irregular
heartbeat, a blocked artery and high fever. She suffered a heart
attack three days later.
   ``We have hopes that she will recover and overcome this,'' said
Bilotta, who planned to return to Italy this weekend.
   Born in Yugoslavia, Mother Teresa gave up a comfortable life as a
convent teacher to live and work among the poor and dying in this
eastern Indian city's filthy slums. She was awarded the 1979 Nobel
Peace Prize for her work.
   She founded the Missionaries of Charity in October 1950 in an
abandoned run-down hostel donated by the city. The order, which was
formally recognized by the Vatican in 1965, expanded and now has
3,000 nuns working in 87 countries.

   A school bus with an allegedly drunken driver at
the wheel flipped over a curb onto its side, slightly injuring 20
schoolchildren, police said.
   The bus carrying the 20 children home from school went out of
control on the city's West Side on Friday, police said.
   Charges of driving under the influence and operating a school bus
while intoxicated, a felony, were filed against the driver, Ocie
Hendricks, 53, after he refused a breathalizer test, said Chicago
Police Sgt. Gerald Satala.
   Hendricks, being held at the district station until a bond
hearing today, could be jailed for up to three years if convicted of
the felony charge, Satala said.
   The children were treated for minor injuries at four area
hospitals, said Fire Department spokesman Tom Sheppard. Their age
range was not immediately available, though the children at one of
the hospital were ages 9 to 14.
   Witnesses at the scene said the bus was traveling 40 mph in a 15
mph zone, but that could not be immediately confirmed by police.

   A plane crash killed all six people aboard,
including a man and his wife who had just been reunited after she
was reported missing and then found wandering on a Florida beach.
   Belinda Yancey, 33, who police believe was abducted Monday, was
traveling home with her husband, Charles, when the plane's wing
struck a tree and crashed into a nearby open field at 9:20 p.m. CDT
Friday, authorities said. Charles Yancey had traveled to Florida to
bring back his wife.
   The twin-engine Beechcraft BE-10, which departed from Orlando,
Fla., was approaching the runway at the Mayfield-Graves County
airport near this southwestern Kentucky community in the fog.
   A state police dispatcher said the weather may have caused the
crash.
   ``This is a real nasty night,'' she said, declining to be
identified.
   Family members had been relieved by the discovery of Ms. Yancey.
   When she was located on Thursday afternoon, Mayfield police Capt.
Bob Crawford said, ``We're thankful that she is unharmed. She is
safe and I know the family feels their prayers have been answered.''
   Ms. Yancey, who taught the hearing impaired at Mayfield High
School, was found when she wandered up to a lifeguard on a beach at
Daytona Beach, Fla., and reported that she was lost, authorities
said.
   She was disoriented and didn't know her name, said Sgt. Carroll
Rountree of the Volusia County, Fla., Rangers. Mrs. Yancey finally
remembered her name and hometown after talking to Rountree for about
two hours, he said.
   Based on statements she made to Florida authorities, Ms. Yancey
may have been drugged with Valium by her abductor, who remained at
large, Crawford said.
   Ms. Yancey told authorities that ``they kept giving me little
blue pills,'' Crawford said.
   In interviews with authorities and relatives, she could not
recall how she got to Florida and was unable to identify who drove
her there, Crawford said.
   Ms. Yancey's hair had been cut and dyed and she had bruises on
her arms, indicating she may have been tied up or restrained, he
said.
   Ms. Yancey had been last seen around 2:30 p.m. Monday, when she
told her son that she was going to Murray State University's
bookstore. She left in an automobile that has not been found and was
reported stolen, Crawford said.
   The other victims were identified as pilot John Haag, of Georgia;
and Mayfield residents Terry Sanders and his wife, Melissa; and the
Rev. Charles Nelson. Ages of the other victims were not immediately
available.
   It was not immediately known what relation the other passengers
had to Ms. Yancey.
   The plane, a 1970 model, was owned by Jimmy Holmes of Orlando,
formerly of the Mayfield area and a cousin of Ms. Yancey.
   Federal investigators were expected to arrive at the crash site
today.

   Investigators suspect that a blowtorch
probably caused an explosion that killed 10 miners, but the probe
has been delayed while dangerous levels of methane are cleared from
the mine, authorities said.
   State inspectors found the blowtorch Friday near the site of
Wednesday's explosion, which officials believe to have been fueled
by methane gas, said Willard Stanley, commissioner of the Department
of Mines and Minerals.
   Workers may have been using the torch to disassemble a longwall
mining, investigators said.
   Officials of the U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration
approved a modified company plan to reduce the methane levels at the
William Station mine that delayed the investigation Friday, said
administration spokeswoman Kathy Snyder.
   Stanley said one of the mine's curtains _ used to channel outside
air to mining areas to carry away methane gas _ appeared to be
dislodged. Stanley said he didn't know if the curtain was moved out
of place before the blast, by the explosion itself or during rescue
operations.
   On Friday night, hours after the first burial of the mine
disaster, scores of area residents gathered for a memorial service
at Union County High School.
   ``In Kentucky, our families are strong. Our communities are
supportive, and our courage is abundant,'' Gov. Wallace Wilkinson
told the crowd, which packed the 700-seat auditorium. ``The events
are irreversible.
   ``We can only share in the immense grief.''
   A funeral service was held earlier for 31-year-old Mark Hedges.
The other burials were scheduled for today and Sunday.
   Also Friday, the head of a public-interest law firm said the mine
owner, Pyro Mining Co., and federal officials had failed to prevent
the disaster despite abundant warning signs. He said the government
had been too lenient with the mine owners.
   ``There's strong evidence that there was knowledge on the part of
both company and the government that there was a methane problem at
the mine, coupled with a ventilation problem,'' said J. Davitt
McAteer, executive director of the Washington-based Occupational
Safety and Health Law Center.
   Federal inspectors briefly shut down the mine seven times this
year because of imminent dangers, McAteer said.
   Pyro had reported 267 accidents at the mine since 1985 but failed
to report several others, said McAteer.
   MSHA spokesman Frank O'Gorman angrily denied McAteer's claim that
his agency had not properly policed Pyro.
   The agency imposed many penalties on the company, O'Gorman said.
   Company spokesman Ed Calman refused to discuss Pyro's safety
record, but denied criticism from area residents that Pyro was
withholding information about the accident. ``This company is not
hiding anything,'' Calman said.

<HEAD>Heavy Rain Falls in Central Appalachians</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Showers and thunderstorms extended across the eastern Ohio Valley
and much of the middle Atlantic Coast region today and produced
heavy rain across the central Appalachians.
   Showers and thunderstorms in southeastern Kentucky brought 2.6
inches of rain to Virgie, and 1.7 inches fell in three hours in
Scott County, Va., Friday evening.
   Clouds and light rain lingered across the remainder of the Ohio
Valley into the middle Mississippi Valley.
   Flash flood watches were posted Friday night for western West
Virginia, southeastern Kentucky and southwestern Virginia, and
remained in effect today for much of West Virginia, western Maryland
and northwestern Virginia.
   Showers and thunderstorms also were fairly numerous from North
Carolina to northern Florida. Wind associated with a late evening
thunderstorm downed trees and power lines near Lexington, S.C.,
which also had flooding.
   Heavier rainfall totals for the six hours up to 2 a.m. EDT
included 2{ inches at Roanoke, Va., more than 2 inches at Mary
Esther, Fla., and about 1{ inches at Valparaiso, Fla., Charleston,
W.Va., and Greensboro, N.C.
   Clouds and light rain showers spread across Southern California
this morning. Farmers in California's San Joaquin Valley were told
to watch out for rain, which would hinder the drying of the raisin
crop.
   Today's forecast was for showers and thunderstorms scattered from
the Florida peninsula across the middle and southern Atlantic Coast
states, and the central and southern Appalachians to the eastern
Ohio Valley. Rain showers also should be scattered over western
Washington.
   Highs were expected in the 60s and 70s along the Pacific Coast
and from the upper and middle Mississippi Valley across the Ohio and
Tennessee valleys and the Great Lakes to the northern Atlantic
Coast; in the 90s in Florida, southwest Texas, the northern High
Plains, and from the southern Plateau into California's interior
valleys; from 100 to 105 degrees in the desert Southwest and in the
80s elsewhere.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 38
degrees at Yellowstone Park, Wyo., to 88 degrees at Phoenix. The
nation's high Friday was 107 degrees at Borrego Springs, Calif.

   Monsoon rains loosened earth in a
quarry in a Manila suburb, triggering a landslide today that buried
more than a dozen houses in a nearby squatter colony. At least 14
people were killed, officials said.
   Zenaida Santa Ana, head social worker of the Department of Social
Welfare and Development for the Manila area, said the landslide
occurred at 6:00 a.m. in the village of Tunasan in Muntinglupa, just
south of the capital.
   Ms. Santa Ana said soldiers, police officers and civilian
volunteers dug up 14 bodies under the tons of mud, rock and debris.
Seven of the eight people found alive were in serious condition, she
said.
   The landslide destroyed at least 14 shanties.
   Ms. Santa Ana said 68 families living near the quarry were
evacuated to a nearby chapel because of fears that additional rain
may trigger another landslide.
   Ten hours after the incident, rescuers still were searching for
one male resident of the area, she said.
   She said the rescue had been slow because the area is an interior
village and is not accessible to large digging equipment. Most
rescuers were using using their hands, picks, shovels and pails.

   Australia defeated France, 23-7 today to
move into a strong position in its battle to qualify for a semifinal
berth in the Bermuda Bowl contract bridge team world championship.
   The top teams in the 14-match round-robin will advance to
Monday's semifinals in which the Unites States and Poland, winners
of their continental championships, were automatic qualifiers.
   Brazil increased its lead over the field by blitzing Taiwan and
seems assured of one of the semifinal berths, with two matches to
go. The battle for the other is between Australia and France, and
Australia now leads by 11 points; the maximum score for a match is
25.
   In the Venice Cup women's world team championship, the
Netherlands suffered its first loss, but Australia still fell from
second to third place despite its 21-9 victory. Canada, which was
tied with Australia at the start of the day's play, blitzed Brazil
and pulled four points ahead of Australia.
   The Netherlands already has qualified for the semifinals; the
battle for the other position is between Canada and Australia.
   In that championship, the United States and West Germany,
continental champions, were automatic qualifiers.

   Gov. George Deukmejian enacted one of
the strictest drunken driving laws in the country, lowering the
blood alcohol level at which a person is presumed too drunk to drive
to 0.08 percent.
   The bill, lowering the unacceptable blood alcohol level from 0.10
percent, will take effect next Jan. 1. Only three other states _
Oregon, Utah and Maine _ have as tough a standard.
   ``This is a very strong signal and message to individuals who do
drink and do drive that it is more likely that they will wind up
being convicted of drunken driving, and hopefully this will be a
very strong incentive to prevent them from doing so,'' Deukmejian
told an audience of news reporters and uniformed law enforcement
officers at a signing ceremony Friday in his office.
   He said drunken driving deaths had decreased on California
highways in recent years, but were still too high to accept.
   ``I am convinced we are going to save lives under this bill,''
said Assemblyman Bill Leonard, author of the new law. ``I don't want
anyone arrested under this bill. I want people who drink to stay off
the road. It's a health problem. It's a criminal problem.''
   Although each individual's blood alcohol level is affected by a
variety of factors, such as weight, the average person can consume
about three glasses of beer or comparable amounts of other alcholic
beverages in an hour before reaching the 0.08 percent level.

   Former PTL board members testified in Jim
Bakker's fraud trial that they didn't know the company was
struggling to pay its bills when they approved of big bonuses for
the evangelist and his wife.
   Prosecutors accuse Bakker of diverting more than $3.7 million in
PTL money to fund his lavish lifestyle. If found guilty of the 24
counts against him, Bakker could be sentenced to 120 years in prison
and fined more than $5 million.
   Bakker and his wife, Tammy Faye, received more than $3 million in
bonuses from the ministry in the mid-1980s, according to evidence
presented in the trial. The bonuses often came during periods of
financial trouble for the ministry, witnesses have testified.
   Board members testified Friday they were kept in the dark about
the financial condition of the ministry. Bakker and his former
deputy Richard Dortch are accused of concealing PTL's deteriorating
finances from the PTL directors.
   The Rev. Evelyn Spencer, a board member from Oakland, Calif.,
said she trusted Bakker to inform board members of the ministry's
finances. ``I just trusted him, period,'' she said.
   Aimme Cortese, a New York City minister and PTL board member
testified that she never would have voted for the bonuses had she
known about PTL's financial condition. ``It didn't make sense,'' she
said. ``How could you give away bonuses while you were floating
(checks)?''
   A former PTL payroll clerk testified that 265 ministry workers
were laid off in November 1985, a month during which the Bakkers
received $300,000 in bonuses.
   Joanie Ames, a single mother of two, said she called her children
together and said, ``I'm sorry to tell you this, but we won't have
Christmas until after because the check won't be here.'''
   The prosecution has said that Bakker received a $200,000 bonus on
Nov. 12, 1985, and Mrs. Bakker got a $100,000 bonus. Less than a
year later, on Nov. 3, 1986, the PTL board approved a $500,000 bonus
for Bakker.
   Also Friday, a former PTL attorney testified that he advised
Dortch that the ministry should fight Jessica Hahn's threatened
lawsuit over a sexual encounter she had with Bakker.
   Los Angeles attorney Scott Furstman testified that he considered
Hahn's threatened suit frivolous.
   But Dortch decided to pay Hahn $265,000 because he feared
disclosure of the 1980 encounter, Furstman said.
   A deal finally struck between Dortch and Ms. Hahn included a
$115,000 payment to Ms. Hahn, and $150,000 put into a trust account
for her. The trust was never set up, but the money was deposited in
a money market account.
   The trust fund money eventually was returned to the trustee in
PTL's bankruptcy proceedings in July 1988.
   The federal charges against Bakker cite the Ms. Hahn payoff money
as an example of how he allegedly used PTL money for his personal
benefit.

<TEXT>
   The judge in Zsa Zsa Gabor's
cop-slapping trial ordered the outspoken celebrity to quit talking
to the news media in defiance of a gag order.
   ``I will make a warning, but this will be the first and last time
I say this,'' Municipal Court Judge Charles Rubin told Miss Gabor on
Friday.
   ``You are to say to the press, `No comment.'''
   The judge's warning, after a contempt of court request from a
prosecutor, was based on earlier statements by Miss Gabor. Rubin
apparently was unaware of Miss Gabor's catty remarks a few moments
before in the corridor outside court, in which she blasted Beverly
Hills Police Officer Paul Kramer, the motorcycle cop who arrested
her.
   The former Hungarian beauty queen told reporters she should have
scratched Kramer's eyes out.
   ``I think that cop is not too bright,'' Miss Gabor said. ``I
think he must be very spoiled because he's very sexy. He's gorgeous.
He's sexy, but I don't like that man.''
   Miss Gabor's diatribe had begun at the curb, where she alighted
from her Rolls-Royce in a black-and-white Anne Klein trouser outfit
and a furious mood.
   ``This man is the biggest liar and the Police Department is the
biggest liar in the world,'' Miss Gabor said, ignoring pleas from
her attorney reminding her of the gag order.
   After Rubin's warning, defense attorney William Graysen
complained about a television interview with another Beverly Hills
police officer who called Miss Gabor a ``foul-mouthed, cheap
lawbreaker.''
   Miss Gabor remained closemouthed during the proceedings and
passed time sketching a portrait of the bailiff and displayed it to
reporters in the court during a brief bench conference.
   Miss Gabor, who says the doodling ``calms my nerves,'' previously
drew pictures of the judge, the clerk and the court reporter.
   Kramer pulled her over on June 14 for having expired registration
tags on her Rolls-Royce. As he checked for other violations, Miss
Gabor allegedly drove off, was stopped again, and allegedly slapped
Kramer's face.
   She is charged with misdemeanor battery on a police officer,
disobeying an officer's orders, driving with an expired license and
car registration, and having an open container of alcohol in her car.
   Kramer, who testified on Thursday that Miss Gabor cursed, spit
and slapped him, left the stand in the morning after
cross-examination by the defense.
   Kramer was asked if he had worn a ``Free Zsa Zsa'' T-shirt at his
recent 38th birthday party and Kramer said he had.
   Asked if it got hot under his helmet, Kramer said it did.
   ``Does it ever fry your brain?'' Graysen asked, getting a ``no
comment'' from the officer and an objection from the prosecutor. It
was sustained.

<HEAD>East Germany Sticks To Hard Line Despite Acknowledging Brain Drain</HEAD>

<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   East Germany's hard-line
leadership acknowledged that the exodus of skilled workers to the
West will hurt the economy but rejected calls for reform that would
encourage citizens to stay.
   Hundreds more refugees arrived in West Germany today, confounding
expectations that the stream of people would slow to a trickle after
the initial wave earlier this week.
   Officials said Friday that about 14,000 refugees had arrived
since midnight Sunday, when Hungary decided to empty its crowded
refugee camps by opening its border with Austria and allowing the
East Germans to leave without their government's permission.
   Hungary coordinated the exodus with West Germany, where East
Germans automatically gain citizenship.
   Communist East Germany bitterly denounced its Warsaw Pact ally
and demanded that Hungary close its border. Hungary, however, said
that allowing East Germans passage to the West was in line with
social and political reforms it is carrying out.
   Hungary began dismantling its border barriers with Austria in May
and 10,000 East Germans escaped illegally prior to this week's
crossings.
   West German counterintelligence officials said Friday they were
worried that Communist East Germany may have slipped a few spies
among the refugees. They promised help to any spies who turned
themselves in.
   A surge of crossings Thursday followed news reports that Hungary
would soon close the border.
   But comments by Hungarian officials Friday appeared calculated to
dispel such fears. Government spokesman Zsolt Bajnok said there had
been no decision on when the border would be closed.
   Most of the refugees are young, educated and skilled people, and
they have left a gaping hole in East Germany's work force.
   East German Central Committee member Harry Tisch said Friday the
goverment will have to find solutions ``to bridge this gap.''
   ``It certainly won't be easy,'' Tisch said during a visit to
Stuttgart. ``Naturally, it's not unproblematical for us that skilled
workers, whether young or old, from the German Democratic Republic
are resettling in the Federal Republic of Germany.''
   According to statistics released Thursday by the West German
government, East Germany is suffering its biggest talent drain from
the nation's work force since the Berlin Wall went up in 1961.
   Several times in the past few days, West German Chancellor Helmut
Kohl has urged the East German leadership to make political and
economic reforms to curb the flow of refugees.
   But Guenter Mittag, the Central Committee member in charge of the
East German economy, rejected those calls in a commentary Friday in
the Communist Party daily newspaper Neues Deutschland.
   ``The reform proposals of those people contain only one point:
They want the type of reform that does away with Socialism,'' Mittag
wrote. ``Thanks a lot for that. It just won't be that way!''
   In Bonn, the Foreign Ministry said 60 East Germans demanding to
emigrate were holed up at the West German Embassy in Warsaw, Poland,
and 170 at the embassy in Prague, Czechoslovakia.
   There was little hope they would gain passage to the West,
however. Polish leaders have urged caution in the matter, and Prague
has refused to sanction their departure.

<HEAD>Waste Agreement Reached; Nuclear Weapons Plant Remains Open</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN K. PAULSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant will remain
open over the weekend after federal officials reached a tentative
agreement on handling the plant's wastes, a federal official said.
   Negotiators for the Department of Energy, which owns the plant,
and Environmental Protection Agency in Washington, D.C., reached
agreement on the thorny issue Friday, said the official, who spoke
only on condition that he not be identified further.
   Plant operator Rockwell International Corp. had set a Friday
deadline for the DOE and the EPA to resolve conflicting regulations
concerning radioactive, hazardous and mixed wastes at the plant.
Sources had said the plant could have closed as early as 5:30 p.m.
Friday if the demands weren't met.
   DOE officials had threatened in July to close the plant due to a
fear they could face criminal charges over ongoing environmental
violations stemming from the wastes, for which there is no federally
approved disposal site.
   The plant, which is 16 miles northwest of Denver and employs
about 6,000 people, is the only one in the country that makes
plutonium triggers for nuclear weapons, and federal officials have
warned that a shutdown could endanger U.S. defense.
   The source said the agreement calls for mixed waste to be stored
``in an environmentally sound manner,'' for DOE to launch a program
to reduce the amount of waste being generated at Rocky Flats, and
for the agency to do everything possible to improve its capacity for
treating the waste.
   The source said the agreement reached by negotiators still must
be signed by top agency officials. The state of Colorado also
reportedly gave approval to the agreement, but Rockwell thus far is
not a party, the source said.
   ``This in no way is a grant of immunity for any past
violations,'' the source said, apparently referring to an
investigation under way into alleged illegal disposal of wastes and
of a possible coverup. FBI and EPA investigators raided Rocky Flats
on June 6, and a special federal grand jury is reviewing the case.
   Cathy Kaliniak, a DOE spokeswoman in Washington, said the agency
would have no announcement until Monday and Rocky Flats would remain
open until at least that time. She said talks were continuing, but
declined to discuss details.
   ``Rocky Flats is continuing to operate as normal,'' said Dennis
Hurtt, a Rockwell spokesman.
   Rockwell later issued a statement that said its officials met
with representatives of the DOE, EPA and Justice Department to
discuss the issue.
   ``Rockwell finds itself in a position where one agency of the
federal government (EPA) says it may take legal action against our
people at Rocky Flats and against the corporation (Rockwell) for
actions that we are required to perform under contract with another
agency (DOE),'' the Rockwell statement said.

<HEAD>Former President Returns Home After Skull Surgery</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former President Ronald Reagan, in good
spirits after skull surgery in Minnesota, tipped his cap to
well-wishers on his way home to California and perhaps inadvertently
showed off his half-shaved head.
   His wife Nancy rubbed the shaved side of Reagan's head Friday as
he waved the Minnesota Twins baseball cap he was wearing when the
couple boarded a private jet in Rochester, Minn.
   Beaming ear-to-ear, the 78-year-old showed no other signs of the
surgery he underwent to drain fluid that built up on his brain
following injuries suffered after falling off a horse in July.
   By the time the plane landed at Van Nuys Airport about noon,
Reagan had traded the Twins cap for a University of Southern
California Trojans hat, which he kept on as he left the plane and
got into a car.
   ``He feels great and he's happy to be home,'' said Reagan
spokesman Mark Weinberg.
   The former president had been recuperating at St. Marys Hospital
since the Sept. 8 operation to treat a condition blamed on Reagan's
spill from a trail horse July 4 during a visit to a ranch in Mexico.
   Reagan is an avid horseman who rides regularly during stays at
his hilltop ranch in Santa Barbara County. After leaving the White
House, the Reagans moved into their home in the affluent suburb of
Bel-Air.
   About 100 people, many of them travelers at Rochester airport,
gathered as the Rochester Lourdes High School marching band played
while Reagan said good-bye to Mayo Clinic officials.
   Retired Mayo physician, Dr. Oliver Beahrs, a friend of Mrs.
Reagan's late father, said Reagan was in good health.
   ``I'm just very happy for him and for her,'' he said. ``Any
operation is a serious one, but this was fairly simple and he came
through it very well.''

<TEXT>
   Authorities arrested two men and began a
manhunt for a right-wing former presidential candidate suspected in
violence blamed for at least 34 deaths and the disappearances of
seven students.
   Federal Police spokesman Guillermo Mollinedo said at a news
conference Friday that Leonel Sisniega Otero, who ran for president
in 1982, was behind the terrorist violence.
   He said Sisniega, 64, was ``directing'' the violence but did not
elaborate.
   Police found five grenades, two AR-15 rifles and other evidence
at Sisniega's home linking him to the attacks, Mollinedo said.
   Authorities did not say what motive Sisniega or the other
suspects would have for participating in the violent incidents,
which began nearly two months ago.
   Police told reporters that Maximiliano Archila Pellecer, 44, and
lawyer Mario Roberto Martinez Pena, 46, were captured Thursday.
   ``They confessed that Sisniega Otero was the one directing the
operations,'' Mollinedo said.
   Authorities said Archila was the first captured, and told about
Martinez. Police said they found more grenades Martinez's car when
they apprehended him.
   Thirty-four people have died in terrorist violence since July 19.
   Three students and one professor at San Carlos University were
found dead from multiple gunshot wounds last Sunday after being
abducted. Three shoe repairmen were found dead Monday, also from
gunshot wounds, and their right hands had been severed.
   Dozens of bombings in Guatemala City have killed two people and
injured dozens of others. A political leader and influential
businessmen were assassinated.
   Over the past few days, 23 other people have been killed in
various incidents. Seven students are missing and presumed kidnapped.
   Until Friday, authorities said they had no suspects or motives in
the cases.
   Earlier in the week, President Vinicio Cerezo blamed unidentified
right-wing and left-wing ``extremists'' for the violence and
promised to use all the government's resources to stop the terrorism.

<HEAD>Vietnamese Woman's Trip to America Postponed</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A woman, whose pain from napalm bomb burns
became a lasting image of the Vietnam War, has indefinitely
postponed a trip to the United States due to health reasons.
   Phan Thi Kim Phuc decided to put off the trip she had planned
this month, said Merle Ratner, co-director of the Committee to
Welcome Kim Phuc.
   A black-and-white photograph of 9-year-old Kim, screaming with
agony as she ran nude down a Vietnamese road following an air raid
in 1972, was published throughout the world and was awarded a
Pulitzer Prize.
   ``Everybody remembers it,'' Ms. Ratner said Friday in a telephone
interview from her office in New York. ``It was the one enduring
image from the war.''
   What is not apparent in the photo, said Associated Press
Photographer Nick Ut, who took the picture, is that the girl's back,
neck and arm were charred ``like barbecue.''
   Ut, who fled Vietnam in 1975 and continues to work for the AP in
Los Angeles, was reunited with Kim in Havana in July, the first time
they had been together since Ut took her to a hospital that fateful
day.
   ``I would like to see her here,'' Ut said. ``But now I think the
Vietnamese government doesn't want her to come here. I wish she
would come here soon.''
   Kim, 26, developed diabetes while studying pharmacology in
Havana, Cuba, and has had so much difficulty with her eyesight and
ability to concentrate that she decided to change her course of
studies to English, Ms. Ratner said.
   ``If she came here, she'd have to put off her studies in English,
which begin in the fall,'' Ms. Ratner said.
   The trip probably has been postponed for a year or more, she said.
   Vietnam's communist government already had approved Kim's trip to
America and played no part in influencing her decision, Ms. Ratner
said.
   ``They were very interested in having her make it,'' she said.
``No one wanted her to jeopardize her health.''
   Ut's prize-winning picture was the reason Ms. Ratner and others
organized Kim's trip. The ad hoc Committee to Welcome Kim Phuc was
formed ``specifically to bring her here as a gesture of friendship
and reconciliation,'' Ms. Ratner said.
   ``She's a good representative,'' Ms. Ratner said. ``She's
articulate. She's not a (Communist) Party member. She's a young
peasant woman who happened to have become famous because of her
misfortune. And people want to meet her.''
   Last month, Ms. Ratner said she spent two days with Kim in
Havana, where the Vietnamese woman has been studying for the past
three years or so.
   ``She was in good spirits,'' Ms. Ratner said. ``She was
disappointed she would have to postpone the trip, of course. ... You
could tell she had trouble concentrating.''

<HEAD>Owner Of Shutdown Opposition Newspaper Nabbed</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than a dozen armed plainclothes
officers broke into a law office and arrested the owner of an
opposition newspaper shut down two years ago, one of his lawyers
said.
   About 15 men shattered a glass door and apprehended Jaime Padilla
Beliz on Friday, said Venus Cardenas of the firm Padilla y Asociados
where Padilla is a senior partner. She said they took him away in
one of the three cars they used.
   Ms. Cardenas said that when she called the Defense Forces
security office, a spokesman told her ``we know nothing'' about it.
   Padilla's newspaper, El Siglo, an outspoken critic of Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega, was closed in July 1987 by the Noriega-controlled
government after being accused of undermining the physical and
economic security of the state.
   Virtually all opposition newspapers have been closed.
   Noriega, as commander of the Panamanian Defense Forces, is the
most powerful man in Panama. In February 1988, federal grand juries
in Florida indicted him on charges of drug trafficking and money
laundering, charges he denies.
   Economic sanctions and other pressure by the United States to
remove Noriega from power have since failed.
   Noriega had the government annul presidential elections May 7,
which international observers said were won overwhelmingly by
opposition candidate Guillermo Endara.
   In a statement Friday, Roman Catholic Church leaders said a
provisional government that Noriega recently installed was legally
unjustified.
   Noriega on Sept. 1 named Francisco Rodriguez, 50, head of a
provisional government. Rodriguez said he won't call for new
balloting until Washington lifts its sanctions on Panama. The
opposition insists its May 7 election victory be honored.
   ``Far from being solved, the crisis is getting worse,'' the
church episcopate said. ``Contrary to all national and international
expectations, we have a de facto government which is outside the
constitutional framework.
   ``The only thing that would justify a government that calls
itself provisional would be the immediate and direct search for
constitutional order according to popular will.''

<HEAD>Arab League Committee Calls For Immediate Cease-Fire</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JIDDAH, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A three-man peacemaking committee
called for an ``immediate and comprehensive'' cease-fire in Lebanon
today as a first step in a settlement of the 14-year-old civil war.
   In a communique issued in Saudi Arabia, Morocco and Algeria,
whose foreign ministers make up the committee, the three countries
said that ``there can be no solution to the Lebanese crisis by
military means.''
   The cease-fire call was meant to ``spare the bloodletting, and to
spread security and stability and provide the propitious atmosphere
for national reconciliation.''
   The cease-fire demand was the first point in a seven-point peace
plan contained in the communique.
   A Lebanese security body to be headed by Lakhdar Ibrahimi, an
Algerian who is the committee's delegate to Lebanon, would supervise
the implementation of the cease-fire, the committee said.
   It would also supervise ships ``when information is received by
the committee that they are carrying arms and ammunition to any
party.''
   As soon as the security body began its work, the naval blockade
would be lifted and Beirut International Airport reopened, the
communique said.
   It asked all the belligerents in Lebanon to ``immediately cease
the use of arms by all means, whichever the party.''
   It called on all concerned states, and those who supported the
committee in its task, ``to work by all means to halt the flow of
arms to any one in Lebanon.''
   The committee invited the members of Lebanon's Parliament to meet
to prepare and discuss a ``charter for national reconciliation'' on
Sept. 30 after the cease-fire has been stabilized, the naval
blockade lifted and the airport reopened. The venue of the meeting
would be declared after consultations by Ibrahimi, the communique
said.
   Ibrahimi would be heading to Lebanon on Sunday to put the
decisions into effect, the communique added.

<HEAD>Assailant Firing From Jordan Injures Two Israeli Soldiers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An assailant opened fire on an Israeli army
patrol today from the Jordanian side of the border and slightly
wounded two Israeli soldiers, the military said.
   It said the soldiers came under fire near the settlement of
Ashdot Yakov at about 4 a.m. Ashdot Yakov is three miles south of
the Sea of Galilee. It was the second such attack in two weeks.
   An army spokeswoman said the assailant, who apparently acted
alone, fired from the eastern side of the Israeli security fence, or
from the Jordanian territory, and did not cross the border.
   Israel radio said the assailant apparently was a Jordanian army
soldier who abandoned his position, ran to the border and ambushed
the Israeli patrol, managing to fire about 30 rounds while hiding
behind a bush.
   The Israeli patrol returned fire and conducted searches, during
which six cartridge clips from a U.S.-made M-16 assault rifle were
found near the border, the military command said.
   The radio said the attack took place close to a Jordanian army
position and that an army combat jacket was found near the site of
the attack.
   One of the injured Israeli soldiers was evacuated to Rambam
Hospital in the port city of Haifa, the army command said. The other
soldier was treated at a nearby army clinic, the army command said.
   Both reportedly suffered shrapnel wounds.
   An Israel radio reporter who was at the site of the attack said
the Jordanians appeared to be ``in a lot of confusion, maybe even
panic. In the beginning, you simply saw them running here and there
without knowing what to do.''
   He said a Jordanian search party was organized two hours after
the attack.
   It was the sixth attack this year on Israel from along the
Jordan-Israel border.
   The most recent attack occurred Sept. 7, when several
Soviet-designed Katyusha rockets were fired from Jordan into Israel.
There were no injuries.
   Following that attack, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said
Jordan ``must work to prevent such acts...as they are responsible
for the acts.''
   Foreign Minister Moshe Arens, also speaking after the incident,
said ``the Jordanian government is responsible for every terrorist
act originating on the Jordanian territory. We are asking the
government of Jordan to take action...to prevent such acts in the
future.''

   An Arab League committee today called for
an immediate cease-fire in Lebanon as a first step toward ending the
nation's 14-year-old civil war. Earlier, shelling reportedly killed
12 people and wounded 72.
   ``There can be no solution to the Lebanese crisis by military
means,'' the foreign ministers of Saudi Arabia, Morocco and Algeria,
who make up the committee, said in a communique released in those
countries.
   Beirut radio stations interrupted programming to broadcast
reports of the cease-fire call. There was no immediate comment from
Lebanese leaders.
   The committee, appointed by the Arab League in May to find a
solution to Lebanon's crisis, called for an ``immediate and
comprehensive'' cease-fire.
   Previous similar calls have failed to end the violence pitting
Syrian troops and allied Moslem militias against the mainly
Christian troops of army Gen. Michel Aoun.
   Fierce overnight shelling by Syrian and Christian gunners blew
gaping holes in apartment buildings in Beirut's Moslem and Christian
sectors.
   Police reported 12 people were killed and 72 wounded, bringing
the casualties to 914 killed and 2,685 wounded since the clashes
broke out March 8.
   The thuds of explosions accompanied by the whooshing sound of
rockets echoed across ravaged Beirut, and fires caused by the
shelling blazed out of control through the night.
   Each side blamed the other for the escalation in fighting.
   A spokesman for Aoun's command, who refused to be further
identified, said the Syrians ``provoked the barrage Friday evening.
It seems they know that the committee's decision will condemn them
again.''
   The newspaper Ash-Sharq, which is close to the Syrian government
of President Hafez Assad, blamed Aoun, charging that the Maronite
Catholic general ``wants to foil Arab efforts.''
   By 7:30 a.m., the ferocious shelling subsided into intermittent
exchanges of mortar rounds across the traditional front lines in
Beirut, the wooded mountains southeast of the capital and the
eastern mountain range.
   ``Don't be pessimistic. The coming few hours will bring good
news'' from the Arab League committee, the Moslem Voice of the
Nation radio repeatedly told listeners early in the day.
   The pro-Syrian leftist daily paper As-Safir said the overnight
shelling duel, which at its peak reached 42 shells per minute, was
``the storm that preceded the quiet.''
   The independent newspaper An-Nahar referred to the barrage as
``the last showdown'' and said the Arab committee would issue a
``binding cease-fire call.''
   The committee, which met Wednesday and Thursday, said in its
communique that a Lebanese security body to be headed by Lakhdar
Ibrahimi, an Algerian who is the committee's delegate to Lebanon,
would supervise the implementation of the cease-fire.
   This body also would supervise ships ``when information is
received by the committee that they are carrying arms and ammunition
to any party,'' the committee said.
   As soon as the security body begins its work, blockades on ports
should be lifted and Beirut's airport should reopen, the committee
said.
   It called on all concerned states and those who supported the
committee in its task ``to work by all means to halt the flow of
arms to any one in Lebanon.''
   The committee invited the members of Lebanon's Parliament to meet
to prepare and discuss a ``charter for national reconciliation'' on
Sept. 30.
   The committee tried to arrange a settlement once before but
announced July 31 that it had failed, and it blamed Syria's refusal
to withdraw from Lebanon.
   Syria has 40,000 troops in Lebanon under a 1976 Arab League
mandate to quell the civil war. Aoun charges the Syrians violated
that mandate by siding with the Moslems and has vowed to fight until
the Syrian troops leave.
   The latest round of fighting broke out in March after Aoun
blockaded ports run by Syrian-allied militias. Syria responded by
shelling the Christian enclave north of Beirut, home to about 1
million Christians.
   Syrian gunners also have shelled a 28-mile stretch of Lebanon's
Mediterranean coast controlled by Christian forces north of Beirut
to prevent Aoun from receiving shipments of weapons and ammunition
sent by Iraq, Syria's main Arab foe.

   Senior leader Deng Xiaoping today appeared in
public for the first time in more than three months, looking tanned
and vigorous as he met an American professor at the Great Hall of
the People.
   Deng's 70-minute meeting with T.D. Lee, a Nobel prize-winning
physicist from Columbia University, was his first public appearance
since June 9, five days after the bloody military attack on
pro-democracy students and their supporters in Beijing.
   Hundreds, and perhaps thousands, of people died as troops shot
their way into the city en route to seizing Tiananmen Square from
student demonstrators.
   Since then, Chinese and foreign sources have reported Deng is
seriously ill with prostate cancer and may not have long to live.
Chinese officials have said Deng is in good health and spent part of
the summer resting at the seaside resort of Beidaihe.
   Speculation that Deng was no longer capable of carrying out his
official functions rose when he failed to meet the president of the
African state of Burkina Faso during a recent visit.
   The 85-year-old party patriarch, in remarks audible in an evening
news report on the meeting, said he sometimes swims for up to one
hour. ``I don't like indoor swimming pools, but enjoy swimming in
nature,'' he told the professor.
   The TV report showed the smiling Deng, wearing a gray Mao suit,
grasp Lee's hand with both of his and then walk steadily
hand-in-hand with the American. He was also shown in animated
conversation, gesturing and laughing.
   ``The recent turmoil has taught us a major lesson,'' Deng was
quoted as saying by the television news and by the official Xinhua
News Agency.
   ``Some of our comrades just immersed themselves in their specific
work, did not pay enough attention to ideological and political
developments, were not vigilant enough against the serious
corruption, and the measures taken to correct it proved less than
effective.''
   Deng was apparently referring to ousted Communist Party chief
Zhao Ziyang, who has been accused of abetting the pro-democracy
demonstrators and splitting the party.
   Deng stressed that China will not change the policies of reform
that he initiated a decade ago, but he also said China must stick to
socialism.
   ``There would be no new China today without the leadership of the
Communist Party,'' he said.
   Lee was a winner of the 1957 Nobel Prize for Physics.

<HEAD>76 Dead In Three Days Of Sinhalese Violence</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEXTER CRUEZ</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Security forces have discovered 52 more
bodies in central Sri Lanka, bringing to 76 the number killed by
Sinhalese radicals in three days, the military said today.
   Elsewhere, soldiers Friday fatally shot 11 Sinhalese radicals and
arrested 226 others, said military officials.
   The officials said the 52 unidentified bodies had been found
since Friday in the villages of Kundasala, Menikhinna and Arangala
in central Kandy district, about 55 miles northeast of Colombo.
   The militants killed six Sinhalese civilians in three separate
attacks Friday, said the officials, who cannot be identified under
briefing rules.
   On Thursday, they said, 18 bodies with gunshot wounds were found
by security forces in the area.
   Authorities blamed the killings on the radical Sinhalese group
the People's Liberation Front, which is trying to overthrow the
Sinhalese-dominated government and which attacks civilians not
supporting its cause. Officials also accused militants of setting
fire to 30 homes.
   Sinhalese radicals oppose a July 1987 accord the government
signed in an attempt to end Tamils' war for a separate homeland. The
Sinhalese said the accord granted too many concessions to the
minority Tamils and compromised Sri Lanka's sovereignty by inviting
Indian soldiers to enforce the accord.
   Tamils, who are mostly Hindu, make up 18 percent of Sri Lanka's
16 million people. They say they are denied jobs and education by
the mainly Buddhist Sinhalese, who comprise 75 percent of the
population and dominate the government and military.
   More than 11,000 people, including 1,000 Indian soldiers, have
been killed since the Tamil insurgency began in 1983. Five thousand
others have died in the Sinhalese backlash.

   A sudden thunderstorm dumped almost 4
inches of rain in two hours, killing two children who were swept
away after a surge of water toppled a van on a city street,
officials said.
   About 400 people were evacuated, some in boats, and lightning
caused scattered power outages as the storm pounded this
southeastern North Carolina city of 60,000 Friday evening.
   Fear of more rain today prompted officials to call in crews to
prepare sandbags, and divers, dogs and soldiers from nearby Fort
Bragg helped in the search for other possible victims.
   ``The showers turned to a deluge and they just wouldn't stop,''
said police spokesman Jason Brady.
   Nichole Pifer, 6, and Jamie Childress, 4, drowned after they were
hit by a wave as they were trying to get out of a van that tipped
over on a street, Brady said. The other occupants of managed to
escape the the nearly submerged vehicle.
   ``We do have search and rescue teams checking to see if there are
any more missing people,'' Graham Wilson, spokesman for the state
public safety agency, said today. ``We're not anticipating any more
deaths at this point, but we think we do have some people
unaccounted for.''
   Some cars were still stranded in water up to their roofs this
morning.
   ``Just a few minutes ago, they pulled a car out of some water
that had two people in it,'' Brady said this morning. The two were
not injured.
   He said officials and residents this morning were preparing for
more rain.
   ``We've got more people coming in to prepare sandbags and
environmental services folks are coming in to unclog the drains, and
buses are coming in for possible evacuation procedures,'' he said.
   Police used city buses to evacuate residents living in a
half-mile radius of Glenville Lake, as water spilled over the lake's
dam. Streets and bridges were damaged by the high water, Brady said.
   Emergency shelters were set up at the Fayetteville Central Fire
Department, the National Guard Armory and a church, officials said.
   In Raleigh, James Brackett of the National Weather Service said
weather officials did not issue a flood warning until just after 9
p.m., an hour after the storm began.
   ``We had expected the thundershowers which were forecast,''
Brackett said. ``The flooding was totally unpredictable.''
   William Henning, the manager of Hillsboro Taxi, said Friday night
that there was two feet of standing water in his office building,
and other area buildings were flooded.
   ``The phones are ringing off the hook, but we can't float
nowhere,'' Henning said. ``We are getting all kinds of business, but
we just can't do nothing.
   ``If we had a boat, we'd be in pretty good shape,'' he said.

   U.S.-based investors have contracted with a
southern China city to produce up to 300,000 small cars a year in
what would be the biggest foreign-funded enterprise in China,
Chinese and foreign sources said today.
   The official Xinhua News Agency reported the project, but a
foreign commerical official said it was highly uncertain it would be
carried out.
   Xinhua said $250 million is to be invested in Panda Motors Corp.
in Huizhou, a small city east of the Guangdong provincial capital of
Canton and 54 miles from a nearby port to Hong Kong.
   The China News Service, another official agency, said the first
stage of the project will be finished by 1995, but that the first
cars will be produced as early as next year. All the vehicles will
be exported, it said.
   It said Huizhou city was preparing to borrow $54 million to build
power generating plants, docks and other facilities needed for the
factory.
   The official reports did not identify the foreign investors.
   A foreign commercial official in Canton said one of the main
backers was Dr. Charles Kim, a Korean-American who formerly worked
for the Small Business Administration in Washington. The company's
home office is in Arlington, Va.
   The official said the company was incorporated in Delaware in
September 1988 and former Republican Sen. Paul Laxalt of Nevada was
listed as a legal adviser, but that little was known about who was
behind the project or how much of the project they were financing.
Officials of the company reached in Huizhou referred all questions
to the home office in Virginia.
   The commercial official said it did not appear that any major
American or Japanese automaker was involved in the project. He said
South Korea, which has shown an interest in expanding its investment
in China, has also denied putting money in Huizhou.
   ``The whole premise is very, very iffy,'' said the official,
speaking on condition of anonymity. He referred to the difficulty of
obtaining quality parts in China and the question of whether there
is an international market for 300,000 vehicles made in China.
   The commercial official noted that top leaders in Beijing
approved the decision before the June military crackdown on the
student protest movement and the ouster of Communist Party chief
Zhao Ziyang and other reformists.
   ``Unfortunately the top is no longer there,'' he said, adding it
is not certain the current conservative leadership will let the
project proceed.
   The project also runs counter to attempts to consolidate China's
slumping auto industry and bring it under the control of central
planners in Beijing.
   The State Council, or cabinet, late last year announced it will
no longer approve joint ventures involving cars and that passenger
car production will be confined to six major manufacturers.
   They include the First Automotive Works in northern Jilin, which
is making Audis in cooperation with Volkswagen; the Second
Automotive Works in central Hubei province; the Japan-backed Tianjin
Automotive Industry Corp.; the Shanghai Volkswagen Auto Co.; the
Beijing Jeep Corp., a Chrysler subsidiary; and the Guangzhou Peugeot
Automobile Co.
   Chinese auto officials say they want to produce up to 700,000
passenger cars by the year 2000; only 33,000 were made last year out
of total vehicle production of about 560,000.
   In the first half of 1989, China produced 290,000 vehicles,
including 37,800 passenger cars. But a tough government austerity
plan, including a ban on most public institutions buying cars, has
led to plummeting sales and huge inventories.

   She stood in the gutter outside C.M.
Russell High School in the chill morning sun of early fall, hugging
her craggy-faced biology teacher _ and crying for him.
   ``My teachers are my friends, and I support them,'' said
15-year-old Ann Gillin.
   Teacher Don Kenczka, the morning picket captain for strikers at
the school, is one of about 700 of the city's 720 teachers who have
been strike since Aug. 27. More than 500 substitutes have filled in
since classes began Sept. 5.
   ``I don't think this will end until they (the school board) see
these kids as we see them,'' said Kenczka, who returned the girl's
hug.
   Kenczka, chairman of the Russell biology department last year,
has been a teacher for 34 years. Ann, the granddaughter of Montana's
Republican Gov. Stan Stephens, refused to attend a substitute's
class, declaring to her parents that she would honor the picket line.
   The strike in this prairie city about 70 miles northwest of
Helena, the capital, has sharply divided the community's 60,000
residents.
   The only previous teachers strike in Great Falls was in 1975.
   ``Standing out here and watching somebody walk past you into your
classroom is like standing in your driveway and watching somebody
sleep in your bed,'' said Sharon, a fourth-grade teacher at
Riverview Elementary who declined to give her full name.
   The school board and the Great Falls Education Association remain
in disagreement over about 20 issues, including salaries, insurance
and transfer policy. Talks are continuing, haltingly.
   Frustration on all sides _ teachers, administrators, students,
parents _ is building into anger. Outside Great Falls High School,
one of the city's two high schools, teachers shouted ``Scab! Scab!''
recently at substitutes filing into the school.
   Some of the substitutes instinctively hunched their shoulders as
they passed the gantlet of strikers.
   Later, inside the high school, one of the substitutes called the
harassment ``terrorism.'' But most were quiet about their situation,
saying they didn't have time for an interview during school hours.
None of the substitute teachers took up invitations to talk later.
   At Great Falls High, female pupils repeatedly came to hug
striking teachers, and some cried. Grim-faced boys offered
encouragement and complained that the substitutes were incompetent.
   But many students who entered the school _ attendance has
increased gradually to more than 70 percent _ averted their eyes and
did not speak as they walked past the teachers.
   ``A lot of these kids need hugs,'' said Karol Johnson, principal
at Great Falls High.
   Johnson said she feels caught in the middle. She makes a point of
stopping to talk with the strikers each day. ``There are some of my
staff who will have a hard time forgiving me for that,'' she said.
   She helped negotiate the last three contracts, but declined to
get involved in the prickly talks this year. Recently, though, she
joined four secondary principals in sending a letter to the
superintendent urging a settlement.
   ``I want my staff back,'' she said. ``The subs are working hard,
but they are substitutes.''
   At Riverview, the mood was calmer. The strikers have a barbecue
grill in the parking lot. The young children often come to them at
recess to ask when they will come back, the teachers said.
   The teachers said it's hard explaining contracts to
kindergarteners. But, they said, the children understand the word
``fair.''

<HEAD>Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with shooting in Bogota, troops on patrol

   Soldiers patrolled city streets today and
the air force reiterated orders to force down suspicious aircraft
following drug-related violence that killed two policemen on the eve
of a holiday celebrating love and friendship.
   As the nation observed the Day of Love and Friendship, army
soldiers on foot and in jeeps roamed Bogota, Medellin, Cali and
Barranquilla, Colombia's four biggest cities.
   On Friday, gunmen firing from a speeding car killed two police
officers in Bogota, police reported. Later Friday, assailants also
in a speeding car opened fire at the daily newspaper El Siglo,
police said. No one was injured in that attack.
   In the cocaine capital of Medellin, two policemen were wounded
when a bomb exploded near a police truck Friday. And in Cali, home
of another major cocaine cartel, three bombs wounded two policemen
and seven civilians, police said.
   They said another bomb found at a bus station was deactived.
   No one claimed responsibility for the attacks, but suspicion fell
on the nation's drug lords, who have been at war for a month with
the government.
   The Defense Ministry put the country's 200,000-man army and
80,000 national police on alert, canceling all leaves and keeping
the forces on standby.
   Bogota police chief Nasin Gianini Diaz said reports of
``telephone terrorism,'' in which callers make bomb and death
threats, increased in the capital on the eve of today's national
holiday, during which Colombians exchange gifts.
   ``Citizens should take the threats seriously and report them to
police,'' he said in an interview on Colombian television. ``But we
are guaranteeing a peaceful Day of Love and Friendship.''
   Armored trucks and army troops were sent to guard banks and
government buildings.
   Banks are frequent targets of the nation's powerful cocaine
traffickers. They have declared ``total and absolute war'' on the
government, which began a crackdown on trafficking after a leading
presidential candidate, Sen. Luis Carlos Galan, was assassinated
Aug. 18.
   As part of its effort to combat drug trafficking, Colombia's air
force issued orders 12 years ago for its pilots to force down
civilian planes that do not have permission to fly over Colombia.
   The air force commander, Gen. Alfonso Amaya, sent a copy of the
orders to the civil aeronautics agency Friday as a reminder of the
policy.
   The air force has forced down dozens of planes without flight
plans in the past 12 years but never has resorted to shooting down a
plane.
   Under emergency powers decreed by President Virgilio Barco,
authorities have confiscated hundreds of properties allegedly
belonging to drug kingpins and pledged to extradite drug suspects
wanted in the United States.
   So far, one person has been extradited, Eduardo Martinez Romero,
an alleged whiz financier for the Medellin cartel. He was flown to
Atlanta Sept. 6, where he is to stand trial on money laundering
charges.
   Two other drug suspects are being held in a maximum security
prison pending extradition to Detroit and to Tallahassee, Fla.
   Colombia's top cocaine barons have escaped capture, however.
   In the Canadian province of New Brunswick Friday, authorities
said they had linked five men arrested with an arsenal of weapons to
two Colombians accused of importing drugs into that country.
   The five men were carrying Venezuelan passports and were arrested
in Edmundston, New Brunswick, on Wednesday and Thursday.
   The Colombians, Jose Ali Galindo-Escobar and Fernando Augusto
Mendoza-Jaramillo, Thursday were ordered held for trial in
Fredericton, New Brunswick next month on charges of importing 1,100
pounds of cocaine.

<HEAD>Bikes Help Protect Environment, but Mostly the Poor Pedal</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Associated Press Writer+_ The bicycle can help
solve some of the world's worst pollution and economic problems, but
in many countries only the poor pedal, a new study says.
   In the United States there is nearly one bike for every two
people, but many Americans drive cars to health clubs where they
ride stationary excercise bikes, said researcher Marcia D. Lowe in a
report published Sunday.
   In countries that have fewer cars, she said, bikes carry
commuters, deliver milk, haul squealing pigs, and deliver the mail.
   Worldwide, 800 million cycles outnumber cars 2-to-1.
   By contrast, the United States built 6 million bikes and 8
million cars in 1987. China, in the same year, produced 41 million
bikes and 4,065 autombiles, Ms. Lowe said in ``The Bicycle: Vehicle
for a Small Planet,'' a Worldwatch Institute report.
   The institute is an independent, nonprofit research organization
that analyzes environmental and economic issues.
   Many countries that should be producing and using more bicycles
and tricycles are pouring money into automobile manufacturing, roads
and industries to support a mode of transportation most of their
population cannot afford, Ms. Lowe said at a briefing on the report.
   ``One of the greatest ironies of the 20th century is that around
the globe, vast amounts of such priceless things as land, petroleum
and clean air have been relinquished for motorization _ and yet most
people in the world will never own an automobile,'' she said.
   Nearly $1 billion in U.S. oil imports could be saved if 10
percent of Americans switched to bicycles for at least part of their
commute to work, said Ms. Lowe, who practices what she preaches in
traffic-clogged Washington.
   Bicycle promotional groups say less than one commuter in a
hundred pedals to work in the United States.
   Some of the poorest countries are hostile to pedal traffic
because bicycles are viewed as ``vehicles of the poor,'' said Ms.
Lowe.
   In Jakarta, Indonesia, she said, city officials confiscated
100,000 cycle rickshaws over the past five years and dumped them
into the sea.
   Governments trying to eliminate such conveyances declare them
unsafe or inhumane, ``but the more likely motive is to clear the
streets of vehicles that make the city look poor and backward,'' the
report says.
   Michael Replogle, president of the Institute for Transportation
and Development Policy, said his organization tries to encourage
governments to put less emphasis on expensive road building and more
on producing vehicles people can afford and use.
   Ms. Lowe's report says many roads in poorer countries are more
useful for drying beans and peppers than moving traffic.
   The Netherlands and Denmark are the most bicycle-friendly
developed countries, the report says. The Netherlands has the
world's highest density of both cycle lanes and cars, it says, while
32 percent of Danish commuters cycle to work.
   The United States' most cycling-conscious communities are Davis
and Palo Alto, Calif., Ms. Lowe said. Davis has 30 miles of bicycle
lanes for every 100 miles of streets. Palo Alto's city government
pays its employees seven cents a mile for business travel by bike
and the police department has a bicycle squad, she said.
   Palo Alto also has found an answer to some of the drawbacks in
getting employees to bike to work: a 1983 zoning ordinance requires
that larger new building be provided not only with bicycle parking
but also with employee showers.

   Here is the text of an Arab League
committee's plan for ending the violence in Lebanon, as contained in
a communique released Saturday. The text was issued in Arabic with
translation provided by government officials. The committee called
for:
   1. An immediate and comprehensive cease-fire throughout Lebanon.
   2. Creation of a Lebanese Security Committee headed by
representative of the Tripartite Supreme Arab Committee, Mr.
Al-Akhdar al-Ibrahimi, this security committee will effect and
oversee the implementation of the cease-fire and will monitor all
ships that are reported to the committee to be carrying weapons, or
ammunition to any party.
   3. Lifting of ports blockades and reopening of Beirut
International Airport as soon as the Lebanese Security Committee
assumes its duties.
   4. A request to all Lebanese parties to immediately stop
acquiring weapons of any kind and from any source as well as to stop
all propaganda campaigns.
   5. A request to all concerned parties and those countries that
have supported the efforts of the Tripartite Supreme Arab Committee
in resolving the Lebanese crisis to do their utmost to stop the
supply of weapons to any party in Lebanon. The Tripartite Supreme
Arab Committee has already conducted the necessary contacts to
achieve this and has received completely positive responses in this
regard.
   6. To call all members of the Lebanese Parliament for a meeting
on Sept. 30 1989 to discuss and prepare the National Reconciliation
Charter. This will be done after consolidating the cease-fire,
lifting of all ports blockades, and reopening of Beirut
International Airport. The place of the meeting of the members of
Parliament will be decided after consultations that will be carried
out by Mr. Al-Akhdar al-Ibrahimi.
   7. Mr. Al-Akhdar al-Ibrahimi will proceed to Lebanon on Sunday
Sept. 17, 1989 to start the implementation of this decision.

<HEAD>State Department, Congress May Be at Odds Over Drift Net Ban</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LES BLUMENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department and Congress are in
disagreement over how quickly the United States should now move to
seek an international ban on drift net fishing.
   With initialing of a tentative treaty with the South Koreans
earlier this month, the United States has now concluded scientific
monitoring and enforcement agreements with the three nations that
have North Pacific drift net fleets.
   But the State Department doesn't want to consider an outright ban
until scientists have had time to asses data that will be collected
under the new agreements with Korea, Japan and Taiwan.
   ``It would be premature for the U.S. government to announce a
policy of seeking to ban drift nets,'' Ed Wolfe, the State
Department's ambassador for oceans and fisheries, said in an
interview.
   More than 50 House members, however, have signed on to
legislation that would essentially direct the secretary of state to
seek immediately an international ban and provide Congress in six
months with a list of the nations that refused to negotiate.
   ``It's time for action,'' said Rep. Jolene Unsoeld, D-Wash., the
principal sponsor of the bill. ``We don't need more studies.''
   Pressure to seek an international end to the use of drift nets is
coming from two groups: U.S. fishermen who believe the high seas
catch has already depleted U.S. salmon and steelhead stocks, and
environmentalists who believe the nets cause indiscriminate
slaughter of marine life.
   The lighweight monofilament nets, which environmentalists have
likened to ``walls of death,'' can stretch for more than 30 miles,
snaring any animal that comes in contact. On any given day, the nets
can cover an estimated 30,000 miles of ocean.
   More that 700 vessels from Japan, Taiwan and Korea have been
using drift nets in the North Pacific ostensibly to catch squid. But
U.S. fishermen say the foreign fleets have served as a ``front'' for
the illegal harvest of up to 30,000 metric tons of salmon and
steelhead worth roughly $30 million.
   Fishermen also believe that foreign trawlers using drift nets are
catching large quantities of albacore tuna in the South Pacific.
   In addition to the North and South Pacific, drift nets are now
being used by fishermen in the Mediterranean Sea.
   Environmentalists say use of the drift nets results in the
``methodical destruction'' of thousands of marine mammals, sea birds
and other marine life every year.
   A Commerce Department study released in May said there was reason
for ``serious concern'' about the incidental catch of marine
mammals, especially northern fur seals, but it did not give any
estimates.
   The report did estimate the nets could potentially snare several
hundred thousand seabirds annually.
   U.S. observers will be allowed on drift net vessels from Taiwan,
Korea and Japan under the new treaties and hopefully will be able to
collect enough data through the end of the 1990 fishing treaty to
adequatetly assess the impact such harvesting.
   Under international law, anadromous fish such as salmon and
steelhead belong to the nation in which they originated. Japan,
Korea and Taiwan also have their own laws regulating where and when
their drift net fleets can fish and prohibiting the taking of salmon
on the high seas.
   Wolfe said he expected that the drift net issue will eventually
have to be adressed on an international level.
   ``It's my opinion that because of the severity of the problem,
the intensity of the problem and the interest at the highest level
of our government that the drift net issue will have to be pursued
in a multilateral forum,'' said Wolfe.
   Unsoeld said she may try to tack her proposed legislation onto a
bill reauthorizing the so-called Magnuson Fishing Act when it comes
before the House Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee in the next
week or so.

<HEAD>Environmentalists Not Happy With House Bill Nearing Vote</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   As Exxon suspends its Alaska oil cleanup for
the winter amid sharp criticism from environmentalists, Congress is
nearing a vote that critics say could limit how much oil companies
would have to pay for major spills.
   Earlier this year, environmentalists applauded approval by a 99-0
vote in the Senate of legislation that would impose unlimited
liability against a shipper responsible for an oil spill and a $1
billion oil industry cleanup fund.
   But the House version of the bill, which is expected to come to a
vote this week, has prompted a letter-writing campaign from a dozen
environmental groups who say the measure would reduce, not
strengthen, protection against oil spills and weaken cleanup
requirements.
   ``This is an industry bailout bill,'' snapped George Frampton,
president of the Wilderness Society.
   ``It weakens current oil spill law and caters to the oil
industry,'' charged David Gardiner, legislative director of the
Sierra Club.
   The House and Senate bills would have to be reconciled before
final legislation is approved by Congress.
   In the weeks after the Exxon Valdez tanker fouled hundreds of
miles of Alaska's pristine shoreline last March, members of Congress
clamored to sign onto proposals aimed at making sure industry
prepares better for future spills and that federal law more clearly
spells out a polluter's liability.
   But the legislation that has actually emerged from two House
committees _ both often friendly to oil and shipping interests _
contains provisions the environmentalists say fall far short of
those rhetorical clamors.
   Oil industry spokesmen have supported the House legislation and
point out that _ like the Senate version _ it would establish for
the first time a $1 billion industry fund to deal with cleanup
efforts. The fund would come from a surcharge on each barrel of oil.
Environmentalists argue this would simply pass costs on to the
consumer and provide no incentive for companies to take precautions
against oil spills.
   The environmental groups, ranging from the 5.8 million-member
National Wildlife Federation to the relatively small Izaak Walton
League, are alarmed about provisions in the House legislation that
would:
   _ Put a cap, possibly as low as $60 million, on a shipper's
direct liability for a spill. Such a level dwarfs the already
acknowledged $1 billion to $2 billion cleanup costs being talked
about from the Exxon spill.
   _ Override stronger oil spill liability laws in effect in 18
states. These state laws have no liability ceiling and allow civil
suits for damages against the oil companies involved in a spill.
   _ Allow for a narrow definition in calculating the value of a
natural resource such as wildlife, fish and birds. Such calculations
would let an oil company off the hook by not making them pay for
long-term restoration of such resources, conservationists charge.
   The American Petroleum Institute, the oil industry trade
organization, has argued that unlimited direct liability for a spill
makes it difficult to obtain insurance and that the various state
laws foster the filing of too many lawsuits. The industry has sought
a federal liability law that would preempt state laws for years, but
each time has been unsuccessful.
   Rep. Walter Jones, D-N.C., chairman of the Merchant Marine and
Fisheries Committee and one of the sponsors of the House bill,
disputes claims that the oil companies would benefit by the
legislation. Jones' committee approved the bill by a voice vote last
Thursday.
   Committee staffers point out that a shipper would still be
directly liable for cleanup costs beyond the ceiling established by
the bill if gross negligence can be shown and the oil industry still
would have to pay for up to $1 billion in cleanup costs, albeit
through the special fund fueled by surcharges.
   Environmentalists maintain that the catch is in proving gross
negligence on the part of a corporation _ as opposed to an
individual that might work for the corporation.
   A floor vote is expected on the bill by midweek and
environmentalists are hoping amendments to be offered by Reps.
George Miller, D-Calif., and Gerry Studds, D-Mass., will bring it
more closely in line with the Senate version.
   ``This will show which representatives sides with big oil and
which takes the side of environmental protection,'' said Jim Maddy,
executive director of the League of Conservation Voters.

<HEAD>Scholars on Washington: Workaholic, Formal, Fond of Women and Horses</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scholars agreed that the former president
of the United States was no intellectual, was fond of horses and had
few close personal friendships. They denied that he was a figurehead
``spun around by the whiz kids in his Cabinet.''
   Sound like a seminar on Ronald Reagan? Guess again.
   The panel discussion was a highlight of a three-day conference,
winding up here Saturday, on ``George Washington and the American
Presidency.'' The event was sponsored by the Mount Vernon Ladies'
Association, which runs Washington's restored home at nearby Mount
Vernon, and the American Studies Center.
   The conference was held as part of the observance of the
bicentennial of Washington's inauguration as president in 1789.
   The picture of the nation's first president that emerges is of a
workaholic, a demanding taskmaster, chillingly formal in his public
demeanor, something of a nitpicker, and a charmer with women.
   ``I am not sure that I would really call George Washington a warm
person,'' Christine Meadows, curator of Mount Vernon, said during
Friday's panel.
   ``He had a great sense of the respect that was due to rank and
position and a strong feeling that if one had attained that
position, then he was due a great deal of respect,'' Ms. Meadows
said. ``And he conducted himself that way in public.''
   She said he had ``few close relationships'' although family
members said he could be warm and informal when out of the public
eye.
   John Stagg, associate professor of history at the University of
Virginia and editor in chief of ``The Papers of James Madison,''
said Washington and his close associates had forged their
relationships in the politics of colonial Virginia and ``they were
much more pragmatic, more political, than they would be purely
personal.''
   ``Everything went in his daily life according to clockwork,'' Ms.
Meadows said. ``Nobody entered his study without his personal
invitation. In that sense he was, perhaps with (Alexander) Hamilton,
sharing an apparent workaholism.
   ``You are almost in awe of his capacity for detail. He must have
driven people crazy who worked for him. He was a nitpicker to some
extent.''
   Dan Jordan, executive director of Monticello, Thomas Jefferson's
restored mansion near Charlottesville, Va., said Washington freely
acknowledged his own lack of a formal education.
   ``Some historians have made a great deal of this and suggested
that he was spun around by the whiz kids in his Cabinet and that
they led him by the hand for their own purposes against his own
interest,'' Jordan said. ``I don't think that argument holds water.''
   Scholars have concluded that Jefferson, Hamilton and Madison
would all score in the genius range if they could take an I.Q. test,
the Jefferson specialist said.
   ``In that company, Washington might appear a bit slow, but who
wouldn't?'' he asked.
   He cited Jefferson's own judgment of the first president: ``His
mind was great and powerful, without being of the first order.''
   The panelists did not press any comparisons with Reagan, but
critics have also pictured the immediate past president as a man of
ordinary intelligence who served as a front man for policies worked
out by his subordinates.
   Reagan's supporters defend him against this criticism, and Jordan
defended Washington, saying, ``There isn't any question from the
record and from what he accomplished and achieved that he was plenty
sharp judgmentally.'' Jordan argued that judgment and courage are
more important in a president than intellectual brilliance anyway.
   Stephen Schechter, a political scientist who is chairman of the
New York Bicentennial Commission, was asked about Washington's
fondness for horses, a trait that Reagan shares. ``He had his life
divided into parts, public service and home,'' Schechter said. ``I
think Washington truly held nothing more valuable than his return
home and that return had much that went along with it involving
agriculture and horses and the like.''
   Asked whether Washington warmed up in feminine company, Ms.
Meadows replied, ``He enjoyed women and they found him enormously
interesting. He seemed to be more at ease with women.''

   Fifty years after World War II, Europe is again in
ferment. The post-postwar era is dawning.
   As the western half of the continent approaches a watershed in
the long trek toward union, its rival bloc beyond the Iron Curtain
is falling to pieces. For Poland and Hungary, democracy beckons.
East Germany, having spurned the new spirit of Mikhail S. Gorbachev,
suffers the humiliation of more than 14,000 of its citizens fleeing
West.
   These refugees, most of them young and skilled, are the lifeblood
of the 40-year-old Communist state. Yet they have chosen to cut
themselves off from roots, friends and families and take their
chances in the West.
   The phenomenon is not new. Hundreds have died attempting to
breach the 28-year-old Berlin Wall or the watch-towered frontier
that divides the Germanys.
   What is breathtakingly different is that they fled via Hungary,
once one of the hard-line Eastern bloc countries, now reformed and
liberalized in a manner that leaves its ally East Germany looking
like a dinosaur.
   The whole continent of Europe has embarked on an adventure. The
geopolitical order that was imposed after World War II and defined
by an Iron Curtain from the Baltic to the Adriatic is crumbling, and
no one can say what finally will take its place.
   ``The `new Europe' is not yet born, but it is gestating,'' writes
Daniel Vernet, a senior editor of the French daily Le Monde.
   Much depends on whether Gorbachev can keep control of the forces
his reforms have unleashed. Will Moscow allow its satellites to fly
into new, uncharted orbits? Can it contain the pent-up ethnic and
nationalist rage simmering in Latvia, Georgia, Armenia, Uzbekistan
and other Soviet republics? Can the West afford the kind of aid
needed to keep the new democracies afloat?
   There is widespread rejection of orthodox Communism and an
admission of its political, economic and social failures.
   Meanwhile, in Western Europe, the 12 states of the European
Economic Community are about to pool their sovereignty and cement
their political and economic union at the end of 1992 in what some
will be tempted to call a united states of Europe.
   A huge bloc of 320 million people, untrammeled by frontiers, is
about to emerge. Fifty years ago they were at war with each other.
   ``Europe is rediscovering itself. It is now able to put a line
under the Second World War, look at itself and see where we are in
the world,'' says Robert Elphick, an EEC spokesman in London.
   ``Eastern Europeans are also rediscovering themselves and falling
back on old traditions, expressing themselves through their own
culture and not through something imported from outside by forceable
means,'' he said in an interview.
   East and West, compelling images are being etched almost daily on
European minds: an East German woman painting a West German insignia
onto her car before crossing the border; giant machines digging a
tunnel to link Britain to France; in Poland, the East bloc's first
non-Communist premier.
   While the unity of Western Europe is the outcome of a plodding,
painstaking process that began soon after World War II, events in
Eastern Europe are provoked by what French analyst Eva Kulesza calls
``an acceleration of history.''
   The postwar order, ``so threatening and yet so stable, so
basically unacceptable and yet so reassuringly predictable, is
unraveling at an accelerating pace,'' says Francois Heisbourg,
director of the London-based International Institute for Strategic
Studies.
   It ``may make adjustment difficult and sow the seeds of future
instability,'' he wrote in The Independent newspaper in London.
   Detlef Kuhn, director of the Bonn government's All-German
Institute, believes the refugee exodus has made German reunification
a live issue.
   In an interview, Kuhn argued that if East Germany were to
implement the reforms needed to make it attractive to its 17 million
citizens, the country would have to dump Communism, and then would
cease to have any reason to exist.
   ``My analysis is that unification would solve so many problems
that we would have an economic boom, which is good not only for
Germany but Europe as a whole,'' Kuhn said.
   But the world may not be ready for an even bigger Germany
dominating the heart of Europe with its mighty economic muscle.
   ``If you go beyond the ritual calling for pulling down the Berlin
Wall, I think there is a feeling that German unification might not
be desirable,'' says Jonathan Hyde-Price, an analyst at the Royal
Institute of International Affairs in London.
   Since it is assumed that Moscow would tolerate a reunited Germany
only if it were neutral, he said in an interview, ``I think there's
a feeling that West Germany is too important for NATO and the EEC to
risk losing.''
   Most analysts say it's far too early to write East Germany's
obituary. The Economist calculated that even with the exodus via
Hungary, proportionately fewer people have left East Germany in the
past year than emigrate from Ireland, yet ``Nobody assumes the
collapse of Ireland.''
   But it concluded unification would be the world's biggest change
in 40 years, and ``is no longer a subject from which the eye can be
comfortably averted.''
   Mrs. Kulesza, head of Soviet and East European research at the
independent French Institute of International Relations, agrees.
   ``What I'm worried about is whether we are really prepared for it
_ do we really wanted a united Germany?'' she said in an interview.
   In a profoundly gloomy analysis, Oxford University Professor John
Gray writes that the economic odds against Gorbachev may be
insurmountable, even with massive Western aid.
   ``The danger is that the decay of the totalitarian system built
up by Stalin and Lenin will result not in the reconstitution of a
stable civil society, but in mounting chaos, economic collapse and
the destabilization of the experiments in controlled democracy in
Poland and Hungary.''
   If so, he wrote, ``Then what we are now witnessing in the Soviet
Union is not the middle of a reform, but the beginnings of a
revolution, whose course no one can foresee.''
   Norman Stone, professor of modern history at Oxford University,
sees ``the wheel turning full circle,'' to a point where ``We may,
at long last, be realizing the aims with which we went to war 50
years ago.
   ``There are many problems to come,'' he wrote in The Sunday
Times, ``but 1989 is a good year to be alive; we may, at long last,
have won the war.''

<HEAD>After Koch: A Clash of Quieter Styles</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GARY LANGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One dresses like an undertaker and talks like a
diplomat; the other more resembles an ex-altar boy. Neither even
remotely takes after Edward I. Koch, the city's celebrated, reviled
and garrulous mayor since 1977.
   But one of them will take his job.
   The altar boy is Rudolph W. Giuliani, winner of last week's
Republican mayoral primary. His opponent is David Dinkins, who
toppled Koch in the Democratic contest with surprising ease.
   Whoever wins the general election, political analysts say the two
mark a new era of New York City politics. Giuliani is the first
Republican in 25 years with a shot at City Hall. Dinkins would be
the first black mayor.
   ``In a thematic way, New Yorkers are looking for change. The
voting in both primaries suggested that,'' said Raymond Harding,
chief of the city's tiny Liberal Party, whose nomination Giuliani
also holds. ``In the general election, change is the paramount
issue.''
   Giuliani hopes so. He is the ultimate political outsider, a
Republican in an overwhelmingly Democratic city, a former federal
prosecutor who made his name chasing corruption in city government
and Wall Street, a man who never has held elective office.
   ``Giuliani's principal asset is that he has no background in
government. Therefore he can say he's going to change things,'' said
Mitchell Moss, head of the Urban Research Center at New York
University. ``He can take the full offense: He says, `I'll clean
house.'''
   True to form, in accepting the GOP nomination Tuesday night,
Giuliani described his campaign as a ``crusade'' to establish ``a
new generation of leadership in this city.'' The next day he
personalized the attack, calling Dinkins a ``clubhouse politician''
tied to a discredited Democratic regime.
   Still, Giuliani, 45, faces formidable odds. Two-thirds of the
city's 3 million registered voters are Democrats. It took just
75,000 Republican votes for Giuliani to overwhelm his primary
opponent, cosmetics heir Ronald Lauder; Dinkins, to defeat Koch and
two other Democrats, got nearly 540,000 votes.
   ``This is a Democratic town with a vengeance,'' said Norman
Adler, a veteran political consultant. ``You've got to get a whole
lot of Democrats to vote for you if you want to win.''
   Dinkins, 62, has promptly seized that advantage, making party
affiliation a prime issue. ``New York will not become a Republican
beachhead in 1989,'' he declared Wednesday at a rally with his
defeated opponents. He personalized his attack as well,
characterizing Giuliani as an agent of ``reactionary Republican
government.''
   The two are likely to tangle on other issues, including legal
abortion, which Dinkins supports and Giuliani has addressed
equivocally; the death penalty, which Giuliani supports and Dinkins
opposes; and drugs and crime, on which Dinkins seeks to counter
Giuliani's crimefighting image.
   But neither is a Koch, whose acid tongue created issues as often
as it addressed them. Giuliani's first words Tuesday night were to
congratulate Dinkins and pledge ``a race that unites New York
City.'' And Dinkins called himself ``the guy that brings people
together.''
   The prime challenge for Dinkins, the Manhattan borough president,
is to bring even more voters together than he did in the primary. He
won nine in 10 black voters, half the Hispanics and roughly three in
10 whites, mainly the young and the liberal. But he lost Queens and
Staten Island, the boroughs with the largest white populations.
   ``The same people who said David couldn't win the primary for any
number of reasons _ too black, too Manhattan, too liberal _ now will
say the same thing about his race against Giuliani,'' Adler said.
   But broadening his appeal was Dinkins' byword in the primary. A
career officeholder who served 10 years as city clerk, he is a
formal, reserved and conciliatory figure, so reticent his critics
call him indecisive.
   ``Dinkins' principal asset is that he represents a new group
whose time has come,'' Moss said. ``He provides an opportunity for
blacks and Hispanics to take a major leadership role in municipal
government.''
   At the same time, he said, ``The challenge is for Dinkins to
disassociate himself from the perception that he's the candidate of
one interest group. And to demonstrate that he's a black candidate,
running for mayor, who is concerned with all people.''

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Yehya Mansour could hear the exploding
artillery shells as he flipped his radio from one station to
another, trying to find which neighborhoods were being pounded by
the Christian guns.
   The Christian Voice of Lebanon reported that the Syrians, firing
from Moslem west Beirut where Mansour lives, were hitting the
Ashrafiyeh district in east Beirut.
   That was enough for Mansour. He grabbed one of his daughters, and
his wife grabbed the other. They ran down the stairs to shelter in
the basement of their apartment block in west Beirut's Verdun
neighborhood.
   Mansour, a 32-year-old bank clerk, has learned in six months of
artillery battles between the Syrians and Christians that when
Ashrafiyeh gets hit, the Christians respond by shelling Verdun.
   ``Thank God for the radios,'' Mansour puffed as he settled the
family in the shelter. ``They're our lifeline, our companion. If it
wasn't for them, we wouldn't know what was going on.''
   In the basement, Mansour huddled with his family and
channel-hopped between all five of Beirut's radio stations,
Christian and Moslem, to keep track of what was happening.
   Many families use four or five transistor radios tuned to
different stations for news of the fighting, in which more than 800
people have been killed and more than 2,500 wounded since March 8.
   Beirut's stations also broadcast survival tips such as how to
minimize the effect of shrapnel or how to keep children amused in
the long hours in the bunker.
   During heavy shelling, the radios drop their regular programs of
music, comedy shows and dramas to broadcast messages from residents
to families and friends to assure them they're safe.
   ``Salami Abul-Mouna is trapped in his office. He assures his
family in Verdun he is safe,'' an announcer said on the Voice of the
People, run by the Lebanese Communist Party.
   ``That's our son,'' Mansour's wife Munir shouted with joy.
``Thank God he's alive.''
   That night, the Voice of the People read thousands of messages
from Beirutis for four straight hours.
   The Voice of Lebanon, run by the right-wing Christian Phalange
Party, has a big audience in the Arab world and Western Europe for
its daily ``Reunion of the Beloved'' program, in which Lebanese send
tape-recorded messages to relatives abroad to let them know they're
well.
   Each station has its own distinctive signature tune to announce a
flash. Voice of Lebanon, for instance, uses the theme music from the
movie ``Shaft.''
   Radio reporters risk their lives to hop from one stricken
district to another, feeding on-the-spot reports to their stations
by radio telephone.
   ``I feel I'm providing a humanitarian service,'' said Nafiz
Kawwas, a Sunni Molem reporter with the Voice of the Nation.
``People depend on me to know what's happening.''
   Some of the radio stations have gone underground themselves to
escape the shelling.
   The 12-story Voice of Lebanon building has taken six direct hits.
Voice of the Nation's eight-floor building has been hit once. The
state-run Beirut Radio has been hit several times.
   Only the Voice of the People and the Voice of Free Lebanon, run
by the Christian Lebanese Forces militia, have escaped unscathed.
   Voice of Lebanon, its main eighth-floor studios badly exposed to
Syrian shellfire, has set up a sandbagged ``emergency newsroom'' on
the less vulnerable first floor.
   Voice of the Nation has built set up a newsroom, control room,
workshop and library in the basement of its building. Like the other
stations, it has also set up living quarters for its personnel, so
they can stay at the station for days on end during heavy periods of
bombardment.
   ``We can take up to 40 people at a time,'' said Mohammed
Mashnouk, who heads the committee that runs the station. ``We've got
mattresses, refrigerators, water and food in the basement.
   The station has adapted its work schedules because of the
shelling so that teams work ``one week in, one week out,'' Mashnouk
noted.
   ``Many of the our people have taken their families out of Beirut
for safety and this was the most convenient solution so that they
will come to work,'' he explained.

<HEAD>New Challenge For Pilots: Fly The Airline</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dream of some pilots to buy their own
planes and run an airline is becoming reality for 6,326 United
Airlines flyers, who will have to learn to operate in the boardroom
as well as the cockpit.
   The federal government, Wall Street analysts, aviation experts
and employees of other airlines are watching closely the
employee-management buyout of United, approved last week by the
airline's parent company, UAL Inc.
   Some say it should make United's advertised ``friendly skies''
even friendlier, but the $7.2 billion deal that would make United
the nation's largest employee-owned company still faces some
obstacles and raises some scepticism.
   It won't be the first time a pilot has owned an airline or moved
in with management. But it will be the first time employees have
taken a controlling interest in a major carrier.
   The pilots' share would be 75 percent, with 10 percent held by
current management and 15 percent by British Airways PLC.
   The deal still faces potential hurdles, including participation
of the machinists and flight attendants unions and approval by
shareholders and the Department of Transportation. And despite UAL
approval, a competing bid by California billionaire Marvin Davis
still looms. On Friday, he offered to match the $300-per-share deal
if the pilot's plan falls through.
   ``Pilots spend more time in the cockpit discussing how they'd run
the airline than anything else,'' said Larry Crawford, a former Pan
American pilot who joined management and now runs AVITAS, an
aviation consulting firm.
   ``If anyone is cut out to run an airline, it's the pilots,'' he
said, but added that doesn't necessarily mean pilots will make the
best managers for a complex company like United. Some of them tend
to see little beyond the aircraft itself, he said.
   United pilots don't intend to actually run the airline, but they
will have a say in who does, and they expect some changes, including
less acrimony between employees and management.
   The plan calls for UAL Chairman Stephen Wolf and chief financial
officer John C. Pope to continue running the company for the new
employee-owners, said pilots spokesman Hank Krakowski.
   He predicted the deal will go through even without participation
of machinists, flight attendants or the company's 26,000 nonunion
employees. Negotiations are underway to include all 68,000 employees.
   Passengers might expect some changes, Krakowski said.
   Pilots are likely to announce over the plane's public address
system that the owner is at the wheel, he said.
   ``I think you'll see pilots more inclined to walk back into the
cabin and actually show an interest towards the customer,'' he said.
   Robert Joedicke, advisory director of the Wall Street firm of
Shearson Lehman Hutton, said United could become ``more attractive
from the aspect of service'' because employees who own the company
are more likely to project a friendly image.
   He said the deal also should make United more competitive on
fares because of the wage and work concessions.
   Aviation analyst Dean Stockman said the arrangement should not
make a difference in safety, because United already has a top
maintenance record, but he said it should make a more harmonious
company.
   ``They won't be arguing with management. They'll be arguing with
themselves,'' he said.
   Stockman said, however, the arrangement raises doubts about the
future of the Air Line Pilots Association, which represents pilots,
questioning whether pilot owners would want to stay in the powerful
union.
   ``Why should they pay dues to protect the employees from
themselves?'' he asked. ``We're in unchartered waters here.''
   Mark Daugherty, aviation analyst for Dean Witter Reynolds in New
York City, said the takeover could add to management problems.
   ``Management has a tough enough time. When you have different
voices and groups with different interests involved, it could be
even tougher to run the company,'' he said.
   But Daugherty added that ownership should give employees ``pretty
intense interest in making sure the company comes out OK.''

   Hurricane Hugo, the most powerful storm to hit the
northeastern Caribbean in a decade, was bearing down on the Leeward
Islands today with 140 mph winds and a 10-foot wall of water.
   ``This is an extremely dangerous hurricane,'' hurricane
specialist Max Mayfield at the National Hurricane Center in suburban
Coral Gables said. ``This is stonger than Hurricane David back in
1979,'' which left 1,200 dead in the Caribbean and Florida.
   At noon EDT today, Hugo's center near 15.6 north latitude and
59.0 west longitude, or about 175 miles east-southeast of the French
resort island of Guadeloupe in the Leeward Islands. It was expected
to hit the island this afternoon or tonight, said forecaster Martin
Nelson, before moving in the direction of Puerto Rico.
   The hurricane was moving west at 14 mph, sending showers and
gusty winds to the eastern edge of the Caribbean.
   The storm's strength flucutated this morning, dipping from 150
mph at 6 a.m. to 140 mph at 9 a.m. It was expected to continue to do
so as the size of the eye contracts and expands, forecasters said,
but storm-force winds of 39 mph and above extend 150 miles from the
center.
   In Paris, Air France announced it was canceling all three of its
flights scheduled today to Martinique because of the storm.
Miami-based Eastern Airlines planned no cancellations or reroutings
today, but spokesman Robin Matell said, ``We'll keep monitoring it
very closely.''
   Forecasters won't be able to tell for five or six days whether
Hugo will hit the coastal United States, forecaster Jim Gross said.
   A hurricane warning was posted from St. Lucia north to St. Martin
including the British Virgin Islands, and a hurricane watch the U.S.
Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico may be upgraded to a warning today. A
tropical storm watch was in effect for the islands of Barbados and
St. Vincent, according to the hurricane center.
   Forecasters classed the hurricane in Category 4, meaning it is
considered capable of extreme damage. If its sustained winds grow to
155 mph, it would be classified in Category 5, capable of
catastrophic damage. Only two Category 5 hurricanes have hit the
United States since record-keeping began; the latest, Camille in
1969, killed 256 people.
   Islanders were warned to expect rainfall amounts of 5 to 10
inches and a storm surge with waves 10 feet higher than normal.
   Dominica, Guadeloupe's closest neighbor to the south, has only
recently recovered from the destruction David wrought 10 years ago,
when floods and mud slides poured down from mountains onto coastal
towns and villages.
   On Martinique, the next island in the chain, school officials
canceled classes today.
   A disaster response team from Miami's Metro Dade Fire Department
established a communications center in Barbados, about 200 miles
south of Hugo's path, to assess damage and coordinate emergency
medical treatment throughout the Leeward Islands.
   At the U.S. Coast Guard station in San Juan, Puerto Rico,
guardsmen were preparing for the storm Friday.
   ``You go around and police the area and pick up anything that can
become a missile hazard,'' Petty Officer Alan Burd said.
   The island chain has escaped the worst of previous hurricanes
this year. Dean, Erin and Gabrielle turned north toward Bermuda
before reaching the Caribbean. This time, there were no signs of the
lowering atmospheric pressure that veered the others away.
   Hugo is the eighth named storm of the current Atlantic hurricane
season, which runs from June 1 to Nov. 30. Tropical storms have
maximum sustained winds of 39 mph and reach hurricane status when
winds reach 74 mph.

<TEXT>
   Police confiscated 980 elephant tusks
weighing about seven tons Saturday and arrested six men suspected of
running an international ivory smuggling operation.
   Police said the haul was one of the world's largest seizures of
poached ivory.
   Police spokesman Kierie du Rand said the ivory would sell for
about $1.5 million. Police discovered it when they stopped a truck
at Okahandja, 45 miles north of Windhoek, he said.
   The tusks are believed to have come from elephants in southern
Angola and northern Namibia.
   Africa's elephant population has fallen from about 1.5 million in
1978 to as few as 400,000, due mostly to poachers who seek the
valuable tusks.
   Several Western nations, including the United States, recently
have banned the import of ivory, and the 102-nation Convention of
International Trade in Endangered Species will consider a worldwide
ban on the ivory trade next month.
   Angola's 14-year-old civil war has made it virtually impossible
to stop poaching in the southern part of the country.
   Namibia allows a limited legal trade in ivory.
   South Africa, Botswana and Zimbabwe hold similar positions,
saying properly managed ivory sales allow them to keep the elephant
population under control and generate revenue for conservation
programs.

   The 156th Oktoberfest, the world's
biggest annual beer bash, opened Saturday in Munich with a milk bar
joining rows of beer tents for the first time.
   The traditional 12-gun salute reverberated across Munich as Mayor
Georg Kronawitter tapped the first keg of beer.
   City officials expect more than 6 million tourists from all over
the world for the 16-day festival and authorities said most of the

   The traditional quart stein of beer costs about $3.50 this year,
slightly more than last year.
   After allowing alcohol-free beer in 1986, festival organizers
finally gave in to dairy farmers' five-year campaign to set up a

   Evangelist Oral Roberts had a dream after
talking to God in the desert: a hospital complex where Christians
could receive medical treatment and bedside prayer. But now he's
shutting it down.
   ``However spiritual one is, you cannot do anything without
money,'' he said last week.
   But the cutbacks could save the 4,300-student Oral Roberts
University and other components of his ministry.
   Roberts had raised the money to pay for his 400-acre religious
empire in cash. He built the $150 million City of Faith medical
complex without a mortgage, funded $8 million in medical school
scholarships for two years, and paid $11 million in past-due
accounts earlier this year.
   At its height, the south Tulsa ministry he founded 25 years ago
was a $500 million operation.
   But donations from the faithful have fallen with each national
headline about wayward preachers, Roberts said. Since the 1987
scandals of Jimmy Swaggart and Jim Bakker, Roberts' ministry has
seen a drop in monthly donations from $5 million to just over $2
million.
   ``I don't know why it's happened,'' Roberts said. ``I guess life
just seems to be what it is.''
   It was the first time in Roberts' 41-year evangelical career that
he publicly acknowledged that expecting a miracle, the theme of his
ministry, is not always enough.
   The 71-year-old faith-healer said he received his vision about
the medical complex during a 1977 conversation with God in a
California desert, and was assured three years later by a 900-foot
Jesus that his dream soon would come true.
   Last week, the minister who earned his reputation as a traveling
tent preacher offering salvation and healing gave up part of that
dream. He said he was closing his City of Faith hospital and the
147-student medical school, and selling his home _ valued at
$500,000 in 1987 _ and other ministry-owned property to pay off $25
million in debts.
   ``It was a tremendous undertaking,'' Roberts conceded. ``Medical
education is far different from any other form of education I've
ever been associated with.''
   But Roberts does not see it as a failure.
   ``I don't think it's as bad a day as it seems. I think we'll look
back on this and think it's the right thing,'' he said.
   In fact, Roberts seemed almost relieved as he told reporters
about his plans to prune his ministry.
   ``Looking back now that it's made, I think it's one of the best
decisions I've ever made.''
   Roberts and those who have followed the ministry agree that the
cutbacks could work for the better.
   ``The steps that he is taking to stop the flow of money at his
two most expensive points of loss _ the hospital and medical school
_ will strengthen financially the university and the ministry,''
Tulsa Mayor Rodger Randle said. ``We have a short-term loss, but a
strengthened ability to survive in the long term.''
   The medical school has been a source of many financial problems
for the ministry. In 1987, Roberts' said he had to raise $8 million
for it or God would ``call me home.''
   The hospital, which tapped $24 million from the ministry's
coffers in its first year of operation in 1981, only recently began
covering its own expenses. Roberts built the hospital with a 777-bed
capacity, but state regulators approved only 294 beds, and the
highest average occupancy was 148 in 1984.
   ``I have reason to believe that that hospital itself was not
doing that poorly,'' said James Stansbarger, president of the Tulsa
Hospital Council. ``One of that hospital's main purposes was to help
that medical school. You have to make your choices. His choices were
the school's going, so the hospital's going too.''
   Roberts said he had no choice but to take immediate action.
   ``We've got to take the religious blinders off our eyes and end
our holier-than-thou attitude and realize that we live in a human
world and that it takes money to survive,'' Roberts told students,
faculty and staff Wednesday.

   The 16 members of the U.S. precision helicopter
team eagerly swapped war stories and tie tacks with their Soviet
competitors at the world helicopter championships, but struck out
when they tried to trade car license plates.
   ``Some guys had these great license plates made up for the team,
and wanted to trade, but none of the Soviets owned a car,'' recalled
pilot Jon Iseminger with a laugh.
   Iseminger and his co-pilot and navigator Rudolph V. Hobbs took
the top individual honors at the competition, held last week outside
Paris. Both Army warrant officers are helicopter instructors based
at Fort Rucker, Ala.
   As part of the seven-team U.S. contingent, they came away with
the United States' third consecutive championship, and a lesson in
the men they could possibly face off against should the superpowers
ever go to war.
   Hobbs, who admits to being dubbed ``Mushmouth'' by his comrades,
acknowledged that when words failed, hand signals often made do.
   But the business of flying wasn't topic No. 1.
   ``We exchanged war stories, and talked about our ways of life,''
Hobbs said in a telephone interview from Belgium after the
competition. ``They didn't speak English very well, but they
understood it better.''
   Iseminger, who also was the pilot of the winning crew at the last
world meet in 1986, said the Soviets ``were a lot more open, a lot
more jovial and friendly'' than during previous years, an apparent
reflection of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's new policy of
openess toward the West.
   However, the friendly communication had its limits.
   Although the military background of the U.S. team was clear _ it
was made up of four active Army teams and three Army National Guard
teams _ the Soviets refused to say whether they were currently in
the military or not, Iseminger said.
   The level of competence needed in the contest would not easily be
obtained in the Soviet Union without a military background.
   The international competition is open to civilians, and 38 crews
from six nations participated. The Soviets came in second, the
British third, French fourth and West Germans fifth.
   The competition is a grueling challenge that requires an immense
amount of concentration, and precision in navigation, flying and
timing.
   Competitors must fly through four events: a 150-kilometer
navigation course; a 80-kilometer course that must begin and end at
a specific time with a load dropped off during the exercise; a
precision flying event; and a slalom and skill course.
   For example, during the 80-kilometer test, a crew is handed a
packet five minutes before takeoff that contains exact takeoff and
arrival times and the course route. Contestants must take off on
time, arrive on time and then thread a glass bottle suspended on a
20-foot rope through a hole in a box, without breaking it.
   The Americans flew the OH-58 Kiowa scout helicopter, used
primarily to spot targets for other helicopter gunships on the
battlefield. The Soviets used the MI-2, or Hoplite, a utilitarian
transport or combat chopper.
   ``It takes skills, but it really boils down to mental toughness,
and who handles pressure best,'' said Iseminger.
   The pilot, who in his job checks on the capabilities of other
pilots, said the testing is useful for a military pilot.
   ``It's like money in the bank,'' he said. ``You may not need to
use these skills everyday, but you know inside yourself that you can
use them when you need them.''
   Hobbs, who tattled that his winning comrade was known as the
``ice man'' for his cool flying under pressure, said the Soviets
appeared to have inferior training, and that he wouldn't worry about
meeting such competitors in a war zone.
   ``I don't think so,'' Hobbs said. ``Really, there was just
something lacking. They just couldn't cut the mustard.''

   Vice President Dan Quayle leaves Monday on a
four-nation trip to Asia, with stops scheduled in South Korea and
the Philippines where U.S. military presence is embroiled in
congressional and regional controversy.
   Quayle also will visit Malaysia and Japan on the trip, which will
incorporate trade and human rights themes.
   He begins the 11-day journey with a brief stop at Alaska's
Elmendorf Air Force Base. There, accompanied by Transportation
Secretary Sam Skinner, Quayle plans to focus attention on the status
of the cleanup of the Exxon Valdez oil spill.
   They will meet with fishermen and state and local representatives
regarding cleanup progress since the March spill by the Exxon tanker
that despoiled thousands of miles of pristine shoreline. Exxon last
week was packing up most of its crews for the winter following a
25-week cleanup effort.
   Federal officials have insisted the oil company will return next
spring to continue the cleanup and Quayle will underscore that
message.
   After hearing about the status from the local representatives, he
might call for Exxon to conduct some winter cleanup efforts, which
Alaska state officials are planning to do themselves, said one
administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Quayle's journey to South Korea and Japan comes as uneasiness
over the U.S. trade deficits with each nation continue to fester. In
talks with leaders in those countries, the vice president will urge
them to open their markets to reverse the trade imbalance
situations, said Quayle's press secretary, David Beckwith.
   The vice president, in previewing his trip last week, said he
would focus on ``the importance of having non-protectionist
policies, the importance of having open markets and access, the
importance of having a two-way street when it comes to trade.''
   ``There are concerns of the American people about access to
Japanese markets, about whether the United States is getting a fair
shake in the trade relationship,'' Quayle said in an interview with
foreign journalists.
   Additionally, in Korea, where persistent demonstrations are
evidence of a feisty anti-U.S. movement, Quayle is expected to
stress a human rights message.
   Some U.S. officials have expressed concerns about the recent
indictment of opposition leader Kim Dae-Jung and two lawmakers on
charges of failing to report an associate's secret trip to communist
North Korea.
   One source said administration concerns center on possible
political motivations for the indictments. Kim Dae-Jung, a former
presidential candidate who heads the largest opposition party, has
accused Korea's government of trying to undermine his party and he
denies any involvement with the North Korea trip.
   Asked last week whether he would raise human rights with the
Korean government, said he would. ``Democracy and freedom and human
rights go together,'' he said. ``I know in my discussions I will be
speaking from an ideological and philosophical point of view in
those terms.''
   Quayle will be greeted in South Korea by the newly arrived
ambassador Donald Gregg, President Bush's former national security
adviser who won Senate confirmation recently after rough hearings
into his knowledge of the Iran-Contra affair.
   South Korea also figures importantly into U.S. military strategy,
with 43,000 U.S. personnel stationed there.
   Bush is running into congressional roadblocks as he tries to
strengthen that presence. Several Congress members have called for
reductions in the U.S. troop strength, but Quayle said the
administration is ``adamantly opposed'' to any reduction.
   The Senate on Friday virtually wiped out the $86.3 million Bush
requested for new construction at U.S. bases there. The House had
earlier earmarked $74.2 million for that purpose, and a compromise
remains to be worked out.
   The Senate also cut all $40.8 million Bush requested for work on
its Philippines bases, pending upcoming negotiations on a new treaty
to replace the one under which the United States leases Clark Air
Base and Subic Bay Naval Base.
   Controversy over the bases is certain to be an issue during
Quayle's visit, at a time when the United States and the Philippines
are preparing to start negotiations on renewing the six military
base leases that expire in 1991.
   Many Filipino lawmakers are demanding far higher U.S. aid in
return, or a phased withdrawal of American forces.
   A move is afoot in the Philippine Senate to close the bases.
President Corazon Aquino, scheduled to visit the United States in
November, has refused to say whether she favors keeping the bases,
which employ some 70,000 Filipinos.
   Quayle's visit to Malaysia is said by some officials to be an
effort to nudge Manila by courting another potential suitor for the
base. However, Malaysian leaders have indicated they would not want
the U.S. bases, and have voiced opposition to the position of
Singapore which said it would welcome the bases should Manila eject
them.
   Quayle is also expected to discuss with Asian allies the volatile
political situation in Cambodia, where the shape of the future
government is uncertain as Vietnam withdraws its occupying troops.
Efforts, closely watched by the United States, so far have failed to
organize a power sharing by two non-communist resistance groups and
the Chinese-backed Khmer Rouge.
   In Japan, Quayle will visit Tokyo's space center in Tsukuba for
discussions on expanding U.S.-Japan space cooperation. Japan is a
partner in NASA's project to develop a space station, and Quayle,
who heads the president's national Space Council, said he wants to
talk about how the relationship ``can move forward and be enhanced.''
   He also will be in Japan for the conference of the International
Democratic Union, an international organization of conservative
party leaders, including Great Britain's Margaret Thatcher.

   Protesters in Nagasaki trampled on a wreath offered
by a U.S. Navy captain who was seeking Saturday to commemorate
victims of the atomic bombing of that city.
   About 50 chanting protesters, many survivors of the bombing,
refused to allow Capt. Peter Roberts of the U.S. frigate Rodney M.
Davis to approach a large memorial statue in the center of
Nagasaki's Peace Memorial Park.
   The statue is dedicated to victims of the U.S. atomic bombing of
Nagasaki at the end of World War II.
   Roberts and other crew members instead placed a wreath about 100
feet away from the statue. After they left, several protesters
pushed the wreath over and stamped on it.
   National television broadcast scenes of the protest.
   The Japan Broadcasting Corp. quoted Senji Yamaguchi, chairman of
the Nagasaki Atomic Bomb Victims Council, as saying the group was
protesting because of the possibility the ship was carrying nuclear
weapons.
   The agency quoted Roberts as saying he regretted the incident,
but that it would not affect his friendship with the people of
Nagasaki.
   Japan forbids the production, possession or introduction of
nuclear weapons into its territory, but many people believe U.S.
Navy ships routinely enter Japan with such weapons aboard.
   Kyodo News Service reported that Nagasaki Mayor Hiroshi Motoshima
refused to accompany Roberts to the park Saturday after Roberts
refused to confirm or deny that nuclear weapons were on board the
ship.
   The frigate is the first U.S. Navy ship to visit Nagasaki since
the city decided in 1974 not to allow port calls by ships from
countries that possess nuclear weapons, Kyodo said.
   It said the city agreed to the visit because of the mutual
security treaty between the United States and Japan.
   The U.S. military maintains a policy of not publicly confirming
or denying the presence of nuclear weapons.
   An estimated 70,000 people died when the United States dropped an
atomic bomb on Nagasaki on Aug. 9, 1945, three days after the city
of Hiroshima became the world's first victim of an atomic attack.

   With problems piling up for President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's reforms, the mood of the Soviet citizenry has taken on a
dark edge these days. Public debate now includes such terms as
``coup'' and ``civil war.''
   Those once-forbidden words are used only by a minority speaking
of distant, undesirable possibilities. But they reflect some of the
pessimism in the fifth year of Gorbachev's reforms.
   ``It has now become obvious that our 70-year experiment has ended
in failure,'' says Vladimir A. Tikhonov. Far from being a dissident,
Tikhonov is a scholar, a parliamentarian, and the first president of
the new Society of Cooperatives.
   A. Semenchenko, of Tallinn, Estonia, expressed his fears this way
in a letter published Sept. 8 by the newspaper Socialist Industry:
   ``Ethnic hostility threatens to spill over into civil war. What
have we come to: A crisis in the economy, increase in organized
crime, a drop in the authority of the party and the Komsomol (the
Communist Party youth group).''
   Communist maverick Boris N. Yeltsin, touring the United States,
said Monday that Gorbachev has six months to a year to make some
progress or face the possibility of revolution.
   Andrei D. Sakharov, nuclear physicist, Nobel Peace Prize laureate
and parliamentarian, wrote in the July 30 edition of the weekly
Ogonyok that in Soviet society now ``any ... tragic, horrible thing
is possible.
   ``I think a military coup is possible in such a situation,'' he
wrote. ``A right-wing coup is also possible.''
   Indeed, problems keep piling up for Gorbachev _ ethnic violence,
strikes sweeping the country, empth store shelves, a
next-to-worthless currency.
   Even optimists such as economist Abel Aganbegyan say it will be
three years before the Soviet Union can regularly stock store
shelves with basics such as detergent. Tikhonov, for one, is much
more pessimistic.
   ``The only thing we can expect out of this system is ruins, and
on these ruins we have to create something new,'' he said in an
Ogonyok interview published Sept. 3. ``This period will take a
quarter-century, not less, from the moment we start real
reconstruction of the system. And we haven't started yet,'' he said.
   Soviets watched their television intently this summer when the
first Congress of People's Deputies and a revamped Supreme Soviet
met. The bodies took on a raft of much-needed legislation but often
fell into public bickering and disorganization on nationwide
television.
   A new session opens Sept. 25, with the pressure on to act more
like a parliament and less like a debating society.
   The Communist Party's Central Committee next week convenes a
long-delayed meeting to discuss deteriorating ethnic relations.
   Some members of the Moscow intelligentsia say that after several
years of increasingly grim accounts of the Soviet past and what's in
store for the future, they yearn for simple, light-hearted stories
on film and in magazines to buoy their spirits.
   The only thing that seems secure is the one thing Gorbachev has
been able to tackle directly: his place as president and Communist
Party chief. The Soviet leader appears to be solidly entrenched in
the Kremlin, able to ride out coal strikes and ethnic violence alike
without challenges to his supremacy.
   Those who warn of the possibility of civil war or a coup do so by
way of warning what will happen if Gorbachev fails rather than
making any appeal to replace the Soviet leader.
   But it was a somber Gorbachev who appeared on television last
week, assuring Soviets he was back in Moscow after summer vacation
and steering a firm course between both left and right.
   ``One can hear in this discordant choir, voices predicting
imminent chaos and speculation about the threat of a coup and even
civil war,'' Gorbachev said. ``It is a fact that some people would
like to create an atmosphere of anxiety, despair and uncertainty in
society.''
   Gorbachev has spent much of his time in power trying to spur
Soviet citizens into political action after years of passivity.
   Now that they've begun to act, they are more difficult to manage.
But Gorbachev still said the increased political activity was good
because it helped overcome years of alienation.
   ``The community is casting off illusions,'' he said. ``It no
longer believes that there are simple solutions to be brought
ready-made from above for all our problems.''
   Gorbachev himself has said that reforming Soviet society is more
difficult that it first appeared. And the Soviet leader reminded a
society that he says has largely forgotten how to work, that they
have to do more than just talk.
   ``We live the way we work, no better and no worse, it is said
more and more often. I want to add only one thing, that tomorrow,
too, we shall live exactly the way we work,'' he said.

^IRA Tax Breaks Help Savings Rate, Bentsen Study Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER DIXON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. savings rate fell sharply after
Congress slashed tax deductions for most individual retirement
accounts, according to a congressional study released Saturday by
Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas.
   Bentsen, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, has called for
restoring partial tax deductions on contributions to IRAs instead of
cutting the capital gains tax. He said the new study shows their
effectiveness in promoting savings.
   ``Now if we're going to be less dependent on foreign investment
and foreign loaning of money to us, then we have to increase the
savings rate in this country,'' said Bentsen.
   Bentsen said the study found that after 1986, when use of the IRA
was severely curtailed by cutting back on the tax deductions,
``savings rates dropped substantially in this country _ and they
were already low _ and that in addition the IRAs themselves were cut
almost in half.''
   The study, by an economist for the Joint Economic Committee of
Congress, found ``the weight of evidence suggests that IRAs generate
savings which otherwise would not occur, although the precise net
increase remains controversial.''
   The study said the personal savings rate averaged 5.3 percent of
disposable income from 1982-86 and has averaged 3.7 percent since
then. The rate fell to 3.2 percent in 1987-1988, the lowest in 40
years, according to the study.
   Savers contributed $38 billion to IRAs in 1986, but the amount
fell to almost half that the following year, the study said.
   The congressional study also mentions analyses by professors
Steven Venti of Dartmouth College and David Wise of Harvard
University, that suggest net national savings is increased by an
amount up to one-half the size of total IRA deposits.
   ``If true, then IRAs could play a productive role as a complement
to deficit reduction in efforts to boost U.S. savings, investment
and productivity,'' the congressional study said.
   Bentsen has proposed a deduction of at least 50 percent for all
IRA accounts. His plan would allow the withdrawal of IRA funds
without penalty at the time of retirement, for a down payment on the
purchase of a first home, or to finance college costs.
   ``That would help us bring interest rates down in his country,
that kind of an increased savings,'' said Bentsen. ``That would make
us much more competitive and slow down some of the consumer binge in
this country. It would help us with our trade deficit.''
   Bentsen argues his plan would have a much broader base of support
and would go farther in pulling interest rates down, and in
increasing productivity and investment, than a cut in capital gains.
   President Bush is pressing for a cut in taxes on profits from the
sale of stocks, real estate and other investments. The House Ways
and Means Committee, over the objections of the House Democratic
leadership, voted Thursday for the capital gains cut.

<HEAD>Government Prepares Emergency Plan to Slash Deficit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK J. PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet government has prepared an emergency
1990 budget aimed at cutting the deficit in half within a year and
slashing capital spending to improve supplies of consumer goods.
   But the budget, to be introduced to the Supreme Soviet
legislature, already is coming under attack by at least one leading
reform-minded economist who says parts of it are too austere.
   Committees begin work Monday and the budget will be submitted to
the full legislature when it goes back to work a week later.
   The 1990 budget will seek to cut the deficit from $192 billion to
$96 billion, the Tass news agency reported Saturday.
   The plan calls for slashing spending on new factories and
production equipment by 30 percent while calling for an ambitious
6.7 percent increase in production of consumer goods, the Tass
report indicated.
   Some of the country's most radical economists say many economic
problems are based in the decades-old practice of setting high
production targets that are not feasible and ignore the quality of
the goods produced.
   Other legislation will call for the establishment of a Soviet
securities market, Tass said. But the report gave no details on that
or actual figures included in the budget.
   In a nationwide television speech Sept. 9, President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev said the government's program to work out of the deficit,
consumer shortages and other economic ills ``may include unpopular,
probably tough and even painful measures.''
   He said the government led by Premier Nikolai I. Ryzkhov would
have to come up with a practical plan to eliminate consumer
shortages that now encompass sugar, soap, meat, cigarettes and many
other basic items. Many cities are rationing such items in an effort
to halt hoarding.
   It was only a year ago that Soviet officials announced for the
first time the country had any kind of budget deficit, and the
Supreme Soviet passed a budget with a $58 billion deficit in a
budget of almost $800 billion.
   However, much of the deficit was hidden by accounting tricks, and
estimates of the 1989 budget deficit quickly mushroomed.
   One leading economist, Abel Aganbegyan, said in an article in the
September issue of the monthly Government Herald that the plan to
cut $153.8 billion in capital outlays by 30 percent is too severe.
   ``Speaking honestly the proposal ... frightens me,'' he wrote.
``I think this could lead to extremely negative consequences. You
can't go from one extreme to the other.''
   Soviet budgets for years have been burdened by huge outlays for
new factories, buildings and equipment at the expense of basic
consumer goods. Gorbachev and his economic advisers now say much of
the equipment and many of the buildings were unnecesary in the first
place, and are operating inefficiently if at all.
   But Aganbegyan, an adviser to Gorbachev, said the 1990 budget
plan goes too far in cutting those expenditures. The Ministry of Oil
and Gas Construction, for example, is planning to freeze millions of
rubles worth of construction equipment and thousands of miles of
pipeline and discharge 76,000 highly qualified workers, he wrote.
   The economist said the capital budget should be cut by about 20
percent, with $8 billion set aside to help Soviets finance private
housing construction.
   The other $24 billion should be used to increase public housing
construction, the number of private garden plots and family resorts,
and set up a program to help consumers buy highly sought-after items
such as cars, video equipment and personal computers, he said.
   The budget is likely to come under tough scrutiny by Supreme
Soviet committees, which under the new government structure
instituted this year have become much more critical of government
programs.

   Pop singer Neneh Cherry has been diagnosed as
having Lyme disease and has dropped out of the Fine Young Cannibals
tour, according to her publicist.
   Ms. Cherry, 25, had performed on the opening night of the tour,
Sept. 5, and appeared as a presenter the next day on the MTV music
video awards program. She collapsed later that night and was
diagnosed as having Lyme disease.
   Ten dates were canceled and she was to rejoin the tour Sept. 24.
But doctors in New York, where she is being treated, have since
recommended that she not continue with the tour at all, according to
a statement from Virgin Records.
   She is known for the hit single ``Buffalo Stance'' and the
current top 20 single ``Kisses on the Wind,'' from her album ``Raw
Like Sushi.''
   Before going on tour as an opening act for the Fine Young
Cannibals, Ms. Cherry had been living on a farm in northern
Westchester County north of New York City, where officials have
launched an intense public awareness campaign about the tick-borne
disease.
   The disease, named for the Connecticut town where it was first
documented during the 1970s, can cause rashes, headache and sore
muscles, and, if not detected early, can eventually lead to
arthritis and heart problems.

   Although he is playing a retired judge in the

Burr still has more plans for his most famous role _ defense lawyer
Perry Mason.
   ``I want more characterization,'' he said of the indomitable
attorney he has played in 13 two-hour ``Perry Mason'' specials so
far.
   ``We did 300 black-and-white shows from 1957 to 1965, and you
didn't know one thing about Della Street,'' referring to Mason's
secretary, played by Barbara Hale.
   ``Then there was Mason. You didn't know if he was born in a test
tube,'' Burr declared.
   Burr says there is much more warmth between Mason and Ms. Street
in the current two-hour shows.
   ``In the old days, they couldn't be shown dancing, kissing or out
late at night where there was only two of us,'' he said.
   ``But there's much more affection in the current shows. And
Erle's widow doesn't stop us,'' he said, referring to the late Erle
Stanley Gardner, creator of the Mason books.
   Much of Burr's career has revolved around characters involved in
the law. He is not only known to millions as Perry Mason but also
played the wheelchair-bound detective on television's ``Ironside.''
Now the 72-year-old actor is a retired judge in the ``Trial by
Jury.''
   In the new series, Burr reviews the arguments of the prosecution
and defense in dramatized courtroom jury trials and invites viewers
to supply their own verdicts.
   ``I won't be telling people what points of law are, like Zeus,
but asking: `What thought processes would you be going through if
you were on the jury?''' he said.

   An Atlanta woman filed a paternity suit against
former state Sen. Julian Bond, a day after he settled his divorce.
   Deborah Kaye Moore filed the lawsuit Friday in Fulton County,
contending that Bond, 49, fathered her daughter, Mia Laureen Moore,
who was born Aug. 17, 1988.
   Ms. Moore is seeking court-ordered blood tests to prove her case.
She also seeks weekly child-support payments from Bond reimbursement
for her expenses in giving birth.
   Superior Court Judge Frank M. Eldridge is to hold a hearing on
the lawsuit Nov. 17.
   Ms. Moore, a former Delta Air Lines flight attendent, has an
unlisted telephone number and could not be reached for comment.
   Her attorney, Lewis M. Groover Jr., said his client had hoped to
avoid publicity, but added that when she approached Bond, ``He just
ignores the situation.''
   The lawsuit contends Ms. Moore is unable to earn a sufficient
income to ``fully and adequately'' support her daughter.
   In his divorce lawsuit, Bond listed his 1987 income as $99,000.
   Ms. Moore's lawsuit also asks the court to appoint a guardian to
represent Mia's interest in the case and to be awarded permanent
custody of the child.
   Bond's attorney, Edward T.M. Garland, said his client had no
comment.
   Bond and his estranged wife, Alife, reached an out-of-court
settlement in their divorce case Thursday.

   Dolly Parton says she always wants to be kind to
her fans, even when it's a chore.
   ``I mean, sometimes there are people that get on your nerves,
pulling and tugging at you when you don't feel like being pulled and
tugged at,'' the singer and actress said in the October issue of
Cosmopolitan magazine.
   ``And you'd just like to say, `Will you get out of my face, you
ugly woman, and take them bratty kids with you?' But you don't,
because it's not their problem that you don't feel good that day,''
she said.
   Her good will is global: If she ran the world, ``I'd like to see
everybody with a bellyful of food and a houseful of furniture and a
car.''
   Parton, 43, who began life in a two-room shack, said she's still
careful with a buck after all these years of hit records like ``My
Tennessee Mountain Home'' and ``Islands in the Stream'' and starring
roles in movies like ``9 to 5.''
   ``That will always be in me, from being poor, from being country.
It's like I think, `Oh, my lord, I could buy food for several
families for months with what I've paid for this stupid coat.
   ``My manager buys me fur coats and diamonds,'' said Parton. ``I
still buy pop beads and car coats. I'm still cheap.''

   Syrian and Christian gunners skirmished
with mortars and machine guns around Beirut on Saturday, ignoring an
urgent plea by the Arab League for an immediate end to the bloodshed.
   Police said at least 12 people were wounded in sporadic clashes
that continued hours after an Arab League mediation committee issued
its latest call for a truce and said it is sending an envoy Sunday
to implement a peace plan.
   A police spokesman, who by custom is not named, said he doubts
the fighting will abate before the arrival of the delegate, Algerian
diplomat Lakhdar Ibrahimi.
   A source at Christian Gen. Michel Aoun's army command accused the
Syrians of ``maintaining the provocative firing against our
positions.''
   ``Our officers have strict orders to practice maximum
self-restraint. But they can't sit and watch others attacking them
without defending themselves,'' the source said on condition of
anonymity.
   Aoun did not immediately comment on the truce call, which was
welcomed by his chief rival, acting Prime Minister Salim Hoss.
   ``This is a chance to end the crisis that might not be
repeated,'' the Sunni Moslem leader said in a statement.
   Syria also welcomed the truce call and urged ``all Lebanese
parties'' to cooperate with the Arab League envoy, according to the
official Syrian Arab News Agency.
   ``The Syrian government is convinced that the implementation of
these security measures will lead to preventing bloodshed and will
pave the way to solving the Lebanese crisis,'' it quoted an
unidentified official as saying.
   In the United States, the call was praised by the Bush
administration and U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar.
   The White House welcomed the declaration as ``a constructive
basis upon which all parties to the conflict in Lebanon can engage
in a political process devoid of violence and coercion.''
   White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the
administration plans to restaff its embassy in Beirut as soon as its
diplomats ``can be reasonably safe and effective.''
   Washington evacuated its 30 diplomats in Beirut on Sept. 5 after
Aoun reportedly threatened to take Americans hostage. The Maronite
Catholic general denied making such a threat.
   He has accused Washington of favoring Syria, saying any action
against that nation could harm eight Americans held by
Iranian-backed Shiite Moslem groups in Lebanon. Syria is Iran's main
ally and has pledged to help free the Americans, among 16 Westerners
missing in Lebanon.
   Aoun, who is armed by Iraq, has vowed to drive Syria's 40,000
troops from Lebanon, charging they have betrayed an Arab League
peacekeeping mandate by siding with the Moslems. Syria wants to link
any pullout to a withdrawal of Israeli troops in southern Lebanon.
   In Beirut, Moslem and Christian radio stations interrupted
regular programming with reports of the cease-fire call, which
followed a night of ferocious shelling duels in Beirut and the
surrounding mountains that killed 12 people and wounded 72.
   At least 914 people have been killed and 2,697 have been wounded
in the 6-month-old artillery war between Aoun's forces and Syrian
soldiers.
   ``There can be no solution to the Lebanese crisis by military
means,'' said a communique issued in Algeria, Morocco and Saudi
Arabia, whose leaders make up the mediation committee.
   The statement said the cease-fire call is meant to ``stop the
bloodshed and establish an atmosphere conducive to assuring the
return of security, stability and national reconciliation.''
   It called on all parties to stop supplying weapons to the
combatants in Lebanon and said it already has received ``positive
responses in this regard.''
   It said a Lebanese security committee would be set up under
Ibrahimi to supervise implementation of the cease-fire and monitor
ships reported to be carrying weapons, or ammunition.
   Blockades, imposed by the Syrians on the 310-square-mile
Christian enclave and by Aoun on illegal ports run by Syria's
militia allies south of Beirut, would be lifted as soon as the
security committee began its work, the statement said.
   The Arab League committee called for a meeting of Lebanon's
parliament on Sept. 30 at a location to be decided later to
``discuss and prepare'' political reforms. The committee comprises
King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, King Hassan II of Morocco and Algerian
President Chadli Bendjedid.
   Saturday's call for a halt to the fighting is the latest of many
that have gone unanswered. The new initiative follows a July
deadlock, when the committee blamed Syria for blocking its mission
by refusing to withdraw its troops.
   Prince Saud al-Faisal, foreign minister of Saudi Arabia, told
reporters in Jiddah that Syria supports the new peace plan. But he
admitted the committee has no power to enforce its call.
   ``The committee possesses no weapons with which it would impose
its will in Lebanon,'' Saud responded to a question.
   The current round of violence broke out March 8 over Aoun's
blockade of ports run by Moslem militias _ a vain attempt to
reassert government control in Lebanon.

<HEAD>IG Report Says 31 of 54 Dams on Indian Lands Pose Serious Threat</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At least 31 of the 54 dams operated by the
Bureau of Indian Affairs pose a serious threat to life and property,
according to the Interior Department's inspector general.
   The report of Inspector General James R. Richards said the dams,
all on Indians lands in the West, are either in ``poor'' or
``unsatisfactory'' condition as a result of inadequate maintenance
by the BIA.
   ``These unsafe dams, which pose a serious threat to hundreds of
lives and surrounding property, could potentially cost hundreds of
millions of dollars to repair,'' Richards wrote in a letter to
Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan.
   The report, released publicly over the weekend, has already been
seen by Lujan, who has instructed Assistant Secretary for Indian
Affairs Eddie Brown ``to take a look and take the necessary actions
to have those dams repaired or maintained in proper order,'' BIA
spokesman Carl Shaw said Saturday.
   Assistant Inspector General Harold Bloom wrote in the report:
``These dams have safety deficiencies, including serious problems
with excessive seepage and embankment erosion, that are worsening
each year because of a lack of maintenance. Most could not withstand
a major flood, and, as a result are imminent threats to rural
communities downstream.''
   Among the worst examples, said Bloom, are the Ganado, Round Rock
and Many Farms dams in Arizona, the Pablo and Lower Dry Fork dams in
Montana and the Ponca Dam in South Dakota.
   Failure of the Pablo Dam, the largest in the Flathead Indian
Irrigation Project in Montana, could cause ``considerable loss of
life _ potentially 400 people _ and excessive economic loss in the
towns of Pablo, Dunham and adjacent subdivisions,'' Bloom said.
   His report noted that the Corps of Engineers, in a 1988 study on
flood control on the Navajo Reservation, said of Ganado and six
other dams in the area: ``It is virtually certain that these unsafe
and often undersized dams will fail during a major storm.''
   The 31 dams, most of which are not listed by state in report, are:
   Ganado, Black Rock, McDonald, Lower Dry Fork, Dulce, Rosebud,
Round Rock, Jocko, Weber, Acomita, Crow Creek, Standing Rock No. 1,
Many Farms, Oglala, Tufa Stone, Pablo, He Dog, Picacho, Black Lake,
Parmelee, White Clay, Washakie, Bonneau, Ponca, Crow, Santa Ana,
Tabor, Tsaile, Coolidge, Asaayi, Elgo.

   The Bush administration on Saturday welcomed
the call by an Arab League committee for a cease-fire in Lebanon and
said U.S. diplomats will be returned to Beirut as soon as their
safety can be assured.
   The White House, in a statement by Press Secretary Marlin
Fitzwater, praised the communique from the Arab League tripartite
committee which called for a halt to the fighting and an end to port
blockades, as well as a Sept. 30 date to begin national
reconciliation talks by Lebanon's parliament.
   ``These are essential first steps on the path to restoring a
strong central governent in control of all of Lebanon's territory
and to achieving the withdrawal of all foreign forces, objectives we
all share,'' said the statement from Fitzwater.
   ``We call upon all parties to stop the fighting, lift the
blockades and allow the process of reconcilation to begin,'' it said.
   President Bush, spending the weekend at the presidential retreat
in Camp David, Md., with his wife and friends, was in contact with
his staff on the Lebanon situation. He has been engaged in meetings
and contacts with foreign leaders on the matter, aides said.
   The White House used the occasion Saturday to open the door for a
return of Ambassdor John McCarthy and the embassy staff to Beirut.
The diplomats were evacuated Sept. 6 after Christian youths loyal to
the government of Gen. Michel Aoun, besieged the embassy compound.
   ``The evacuation of our embassy from Beirut should not be
misread,'' the Fitzwater statement read. ``Our temporary absence
does not mean we are indifferent to the safety and welfare of the
people of Lebanon.
   ``Indeed we redoubled our efforts with the Arab League to press
for a cease-fire and the beginning of a political process to bring
an end to the suffering in Lebanon.
   ``Rest assured, the United States will return its diplomats to
Lebanon as expeditiously as we are convinced that circumstances
exist in which our presence can be reasonably safe and effective.''
   The United States will engage in talks with Aoun's government on
the security assurances it would require before they return, said an
administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Sources in Lebanon said Aoun considered the departure a move
directed against his rule.
   State Department officials have said they considered Aoun's own
earlier comments threats on Americans. He had said in an interview
that the United States was obsessed with freeing Americans held
hostage in Lebanon, and indicated perhaps the way to get the
attention of the United States was to take American hostages.
   The declaration Saturday by the foreign ministers of Saudi
Arabia, Morocco and Algeria, who make up the Arab League committee,
was viewed by the administration as ``a clear step in the right
direction,'' said the administration source.
   Previous similar calls have failed to end the violence pitting
Syrian troops and allied Moslem militias against the mainly
Christian troops of Aoun.
   But the setting of a Sept. 30 negotiation date, and pledges about
restricting arms supplies indicated the effort was ``reasonably
serious'' and pragmatic and may have potential, the official added.
   The Arab League, founded in 1945, is the chief representative of
Arab interests internationally and mediates disputes among the Arab
states.

<HEAD>U.S. Policy Quandary: What to Do When Vietnamese Leave?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two weeks before Vietnamese troops are to
withdraw from Cambodia, the Bush administration is in a quandary
over what it should do to block the resurgence of the Khmer Rouge, a
group that murdered up to 2 million people in the 1970s, U.S. and
congressional officials say.
   ``Basically, what's happening is that most people are trying to
figure out what to do since Paris,'' said a senior administration
official, referring to the collapse of a 19-nation peace conference
in Paris last month.
   ``People are trying to absorb what went on,'' the official said,
speaking only on condition his name not be used. ``What do we do
when, and if, the Vietnamese complete withdrawal?''
   Participants at the Paris conference failed to come up with a
political solution for easing tension among warring factions in
Cambodia after the Vietnamese leave. Hanoi has said it will pull its
troops out by Sept. 30, ending a 10-year occupation.
   The vacuum has created the ``very real possibility that the
genocidal Khmer Rouge could battle its way back to power in Phnom
Penh,'' said Rep. Stephen J. Solarz, D-N.Y., chairman of the House
Foreign Affairs subcommittee on Asian and Pacific Affairs.
   Fred Brown, an expert on Indochina and former scholar at the
Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a think tank, said the
administration is in a ``genuine dilemma'' about Cambodia. ``In the
wake of the Paris conference, there are serious questions'' about
U.S. policy, he said.
   A major concern are the ties between the Khmer Rouge and Prince
Norodom Sihanouk, the former Cambodian monarch the United States
supports with millions of dollars in aid. Washington would like to
see Sihanouk head an interim government pending free elections
supervised by the United Nations.
   Although members of Sihanouk's family were murdered by the Khmer
Rouge, which ruled Cambodia between 1975-1979, Sihanouk has endorsed
the idea of including the Khmer Rouge in a transitional government
in Cambodia.
   Both the Khmer Rouge and Sihanouk receive military aid from
China. Other factions in Cambodia are the Vietnamese-backed
government of Hun Sen, and a smaller non-communist faction.
   Some observers at the Paris conference said Sihanouk abdicated
too much of his authority to the Khmer Rouge. ``Is he every going to
loosen himself from the Khmer Rouge?'' Brown asked. ``Nobody can
come up with a leader to replace Sihanouk.''
   Vice President Dan Quayle, who is expected to discuss the
Cambodian situation with Asian allies on a trip to the Far East this
week, told a group of reporters last week that ``the non-communist
resistance has always been, from our viewpoint, the best hope to see
a political settlement occur in Cambodia.''
   Members of Congress echoed concern about Sihanouk.
   ``I think we ought to make clear to Sihanouk that either he and
the non-communists break all their ties to the Khmer Rouge, or they
don't get any help from us,'' said Rep. Chester Atkins, D-Mass.
   Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, suggested Pol Pot be brought before an
international tribunal on charges of genocide. He said the United
States should not go along with Sihanouk's apparent acquiescence on
the Khmer Rouge.
   ``The United States does not have the luxury of recusing itself''
on moral issues,'' he said.
   The Bush administration says its adamantly opposes a return to
power of the Khmer Rouge, an extreme nationalist group with about
40,000 fighters.
   ``We want to ensure that there are not more Cambodian killing
fields,'' said Richard Solomon, assistant secretary of state for
East Asian affairs.
   At the same time, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said
the administration has noted that Sihanouk as well as Washington's
Asian allies have ``said that the Khmer Rouge elements should
participate in the political process.''
   Atkins claimed administration officials used ``the most twisted
and distorted logic that I've ever seen in foreign policy'' in
defending a policy that opposes the Khmer Rouge while seeming to go
along with Sihanouk's idea of including it in the government.
   But Solomon said on Capitol Hill last week that it would be
``self-delusional'' to ignore the Khmer Rouge, a force to be
reckoned with in Cambodia.
   And one administration official explained the dilemma. Excluding
the Khmer Rouge means the rebels assuredly would launch a military
offensive to seize power, creating a ``little Lebanon in Southeast
Asia,'' he said.
   By bringing some Khmer Rouge ``under the tent, there's a
possibility that peace will break out,'' he said.
   As Solomon put it: ``The chances of avoiding conflict are not
very good,'' but they are better with a political settlement.
   Complicating the situation are the Soviets and the Chinese.
Solomon said the United States believes Moscow has stepped up arms
shipments to the Hun Sen regime in recent months. ``The Soviet
Union, as a primary supporter of Vietnam and Hun Sen, must restrict
its increasing flow of arms into Cambodia,'' he said.
   Brown said Secretary of State James Baker III is likely to broach
the issue in talks with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze
later this month. The United States also wants China to end its arms
supplies to the Khmer Rouge.
   Meantime, the administration has asked Congress _ and received
approval _ to spend about $7.5 million in humanitarian aid for
Cambodia in fiscal 1990, up about $2.5 million from the previous
year.
   But sources on Capitol Hill said Bush administration have not
requested any covert assistance for military equipment in the
upcoming fiscal year. The sources spoke on condition of anonymity.

<TEXT>
   Princess Diana's brother and his
bride exchanged wedding vows Saturday in a church where some of
George Washington's ancestors are buried.
   The marriage of Viscount Althorp and former model Victoria
Lockwood had been proclaimed ``the nearly royal wedding of the
year'' by The Sunday Times of London.
   The bride wore the Spencer family tiara that Diana wore when she
married Prince Charles in 1981.
   Like Diana's, the wedding was conducted by the archbishop of
Canterbury, the Most Rev. Robert Runcie _ ``a very nice man,'' in
the opinion of the eighth Earl Spencer, father of the groom, whose
comments were included in a packet of press material on the ceremony.
   Charles and Diana were among the guests, and their second son,
five-year-old Prince Harry, was a page. Security, in deference to
the royals, was strict, and villagers needed red tickets to be
admitted to an enclosure near the church.
   Unlike the royal wedding in the vast St. Paul's Cathedral in
London, Saturday's ceremony was crammed into the medieval Church of
St. Mary the Virgin, two miles from the family seat of Althorp. Six
pews were removed to make room for an orchestra and a choir, leaving
space for about 250 guests.
   Another 200 people were invited for champagne and a light supper
afterwards at the family house. The estate stands in
Northamptonshire amid rolling pastures where sheep and cattle graze
among the hedgerows.
   Barbara Cartland, 88-year-old queen of romance novelists and
mother of the earl's second wife, arrived in a hot pink chiffon
dress and hat.
   Charles Althorp, 25, who is a reporter for NBC's ``Today'' Show,
is in line to become the ninth Earl and inherit an estimated $80
million fortune, including the Althorp estate.
   Miss Lockwood, 24, a former fashion model, became engaged to
Althorp in July following a six-week romance.
   St. Mary's, with its tall beacon tower, has been the church of
the Spencer family _ Princess Diana's family _ since 1508 when Sir
John Spencer bought the 15,000-acre Althorp estate.
   Laurence Washington, the great-great-great-grandfather of the
first American president, was a cousin by marriage of the Spencers
and lived on the estate until he died in December 1616 and was
buried in the chancel near the church altar. Laurence's younger
brother, Robert, also is buried in the church.
   Their tombstones bear the Washington coat of arms with three
stars over two horizontal bars. It is thought to have inspired the
design of the American flag.
   As promised last week, church officials took up a collection from
among the assembled journalists to raise money to help restore the
church. There was no word on how much was raised.
   Church officials say they need $190,000 to preserve the church,
which overlooks the thatched roofs and farmlands of Great Brington,
66 miles northwest of London.
   Several hundred people, fortified by picnic baskets and
thermoses, staked out places near the church despite a drenching
rain.
   ``It's the wedding of the year,'' said Emily Coghlan, 64, an
onlooker who deployed her lawn chair in front of the church at 7
a.m., eight hours before the ceremony.

   Gunmen rampaged through three villages
in central Sri Lanka, burning and shooting to death at least 82
Sinhalese civilians in repeated night raids, residents and military
officials said Saturday.
   An army officer said the killers are believed to be
pro-government vigilantes seeking vengeance for the deaths of 15
soldiers' relatives killed by radicals of the Sinhalese People's
Liberation Front. The gunmen wore military-style uniforms, he said.
   They started the massacre Thursday in Menikhinna village, 55
miles northeast of Colombo, according to military officials who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   At least 50 houses in the village were torched Thursday and
Friday night, said the officials.
   Searchers have found 52 bodies as of Saturday, some with gunshot
wounds and others burned, they said.
   The raiders also attacked neigboring Kundasala and Aranagala
villages and killed 30 people, they said.
   The villagers were unarmed, according to the officials.
   Residents in Kandy, a few miles from Menikhinna, said at least
100 bodies have been found in the three villages, and at least 50
more people may have been killed and thrown into a nearby river. The
residents were contacted by telephone and refused to identify
themselves.
   Menikhinna is believed to be a stronghold of the People's
Liberation Front, an ultranationalist guerrilla group trying to
overthrow the government.
   The massacre is the worst committed by a suspected vigilante
group.
   On Sept. 1 suspected vigilantes shot or burned to death at least
60 Sinhalese at Punewa village, 120 miles north of Colombo,
apparently to avenge the slaying of a police inspector.
   Government officials deny opposition charges that they give
orders to vigilantes. The army is pursuing its own crackdown on the
radicals.
   Military officials said Saturday that soldiers shot 11 Sinhalese
radicals and arrested 226 others in central and southern Sri Lanka
in the preceding 24 hours.
   Also, militants killed six Sinhalese civilians in three separate
attacks Friday, they said.
   By official count, at least 5,000 people have died in the
2-year-old Sinhalese revolt. The radicals began fighting to protest
government concessions to minority Tamils fighting another war for
an independent homeland in northeastern Sri Lanka. Sinhalese
radicals also resent the deployment of Indian peacekeeping soldiers
supervising a peace accord with the Tamils.
   Tamils make up 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people and
charge they are discriminated against by the majority Sinhalese who
control the government and military.

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev urged the Baltic
republics to compromise with their minorities and settle the
region's ethnic disputes, Tass reported.
   The Soviet president spoke at a meeting with Communist Party and
government leaders from Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. Tass released
its report on the Wednesday meeting late Friday.
   ``All our problems should be tackled by joint effort in the
framework of the federation,'' Gorbachev said.
   All the country's 15 republics are tied together economically,
culturally and through human contacts, he said.
   ``If we now allowed the situation to deteriorate to the point
where these ties would start to break up, the republics and the
whole country would be rolled back by decades,'' Gorbachev said.
   He added that ``any attempt to infringe on citizens' rights on
the ethnic basis should be regarded as contradicting the principles
of Soviet statehood and humanism.''
   Gorbachev's social reforms, including greater tolerance of
dissent, has fueled a wave of nationalism in the Baltics and other
Soviet republics.
   The Baltics are seeking greater autonomy and freedom from Kremlin
control. But the growing nationalism also has heightened tensions
among ethnic Russians and other minority groups who live and work in
those republics, and who claim they are targets of discrimination by
the ethnic majority.
   Non-Estonian workers in that republic struck last month after the
Estonian government passed rough residency requirements for voting
and running for local office.
   Gorbachev's conciliatory tone comes after the Communist Party
Central Committee last month warned that separatists were leading
the Baltic republics into an abyss.
   Estonian radio editor Harry Tiido said Friday that in interviews
given when he returned to Tallinn, Estonian Communist Party chief
Vaino Vyalyas said Gorbachev spoke favorably about the republics'
plans for more economic autonomy.
   More than a million Baltic residents joined hands on Aug. 23 to
protest the 50th anniversary of a Nazi-Soviet agreement that paved
the way for Moscow to annex the Baltic states.

   A doctor treating Mother Teresa for a
heart attack said Saturday the Nobel laureate is responding to
treatment and that the cause of an infection that slowed her
recovery has been found.
   Doctors said last week that the infection posed a new danger to
the 79-year-old Nobel laureate, who has been hospitalized nearly two
weeks.
   ``We have found one or two causes for the infection. We are
hopeful that now she will improve faster,'' said Dr. A.K. Bardhan.
The doctor refused to reveal the cause of the infection.
   The Woodlands Nursing Home hospital said Mother Teresa's
temperature was normal and ``her general condition is better.'' It
said she had not suffered chest pains since Friday evening.
   Mother Teresa, who gave up a comfortable life as a convent
teacher to help the dying and destitute in Calcutta, was
hospitalized Sept. 5 with an irregular heartbeat, a blocked artery
and high fever. She suffered a heart attack three days later that
forced the doctors to attach a temporary pacemaker.
   Doctors thought she was recovering well, but on Thursday she
developed the infection and brought chest pains and a high fever.
   Bardhan said the pacemaker was still in place and that Mother
Teresa was ``improving and responding to treatment,'' even though
her heart remained weak.
   Mother Teresa was awarded the 1979 Nobel Peace Prize for her work
with the poor.
   She founded the Missionaries of Charity in October 1950 in an
abandoned hostel donated by the city of Calcutta. The order, which
was formally recognized by the Vatican in 1965, expanded and now has
3,000 nuns working in 87 countries.

<TEXT>
   East Germans by the hundreds crossed
into Austria on Saturday, afraid that their historic opportunity to
emigrate might soon be lost. But the Hungarian premier said the
border would remain open.
   Premier Miklos Nemeth was quoted by a West German newspaper as
saying that concern for human rights had dictated his country's
decision to defy its Warsaw Pact ally, East Germany.
   Using Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's concept of a
``European House'' where East and West cooperate, Nemeth was quoted
as telling Bild am Sontag: ``There can be no rooms in such a house
that are separated by barbed wire.''
   An estimated 14,000 East Germans have traveled to West Germany
since Hungary threw open its western border with Austria on Sept.
10. East Germans, who have automatic West German citizenship, have
been drawn by the promise of a brighter economic future in the West.
   Hungary had insisted its approval of the East German exodus is
temporary but has not said when it would close its border. Nemeth
was quoted as saying that the border would remain open but did not
say for how long.
   Ferenc Somogyi, one of Hungary's three deputy foreign ministers,
also said Friday his government had no immediate plans to halt the
westward flow.
   Border officials in West Germany said 500 East Germans had made
their way to registration points in Bavaria during the night Friday.
   In Budapest, workers of the West German charity registering new
arrivals at refugee camps said about 400 East Germans had gathered
between late Friday and noon Saturday.
   That is nearly double the average in the last few days. The
workers, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the refugees
continued to fear that the border might close and their opportunity
to emigrate would end.
   Many East Germans waiting at the Zugliget transit camp for buses
to take them to the West expressed anxiety.
   ``Grab the chance while you can, you never know how long you
have,'' said a burly man from Berlin, cradling a two-year old
toddler in his arms. ``I could never live with myself if I missed
the opportunity because I waited too long.''
   East Germans began crossing the border into Austria after Hungary
began removing boundary fortifications in May, a reflection of its
desire for stronger ties to the West. It also has been implementing
reforms that put it, along with Poland, at the forefront of change
in the Soviet bloc.
   Foreign Minister Gyula Horn sought to head off speculation that
Hungary's reforms and tensions with allies might lead it out of the
Warsaw Pact.
   ``As long as this bloc exists, Hungary will continue to carry out
its responsibilities in it,'' Horn told a Communist Party rally in
Komarom, on the Czechoslovak border.
   In July, thousands of the estimated 50,000 East Germans
vacationing in Hungary refused to return home. Hungary began putting
them up in emergency shelters.
   Then, seven days ago, Hungary threw open its border and allowed
the biggest single exodus West since the Berlin Wall was built in
1961.
   Hard-line East Germany, Czechoslovakia and Romania have sharply
criticized their Warsaw Pact ally's role in the refugee exodus.
   Romanian President Nicolae Ceausescu on Friday accused Budapest
of ``irresponsible actions'' and called for ``interference in other
countries' home affairs to stop,'' the state Agerpres news agency
reported.
   On Saturday, the Soviets lashed out at West Germany. A front-page
article in the Communist Party daily Pravda said ``It's completely
obvious that the carrying out of a huge provocative action against
East Germany is an open violation of international law.''
   Pravda also accused the West German press of whipping up
enthusiasm among the refugees to emigrate.
   The Czechoslovak Communist Party daily Rude Pravo also assailed
West Germany, accusing that government of having ``coordinated'' the
exodus and saying Bonn authorities were ``unable to hide their
hatred of socialism.''
   Communist East Germany kept up its bitter criticism of Bonn
Saturday. ``We are experiencing now a pitiless psychological warfare
against socialism,'' read a commentary in the Berliner Zeitung
newspaper.
   The state-run news agency ADN alleged that the recruitment of
East German workers amounted to ``slave trade.''
   In a twist to the refugee story, an Italian newspaper said
Saturday that several hundred unemployed Italians are seeking
permission to live and work in East Germany.
   The Rome-based daily Il Tempo said a delegation representing 264
unemployed people from Naples went to the East German Embassy Friday
to deliver documents asking for permission to move to the Communist
country, where they were certain they would be able to find a secure
job and an inexpensive place to live.

   An Arab League committee called
Saturday for an ``immediate and comprehensive'' cease-fire in
Lebanon, but admitted it has no power to enforce the appeal.
   ``The Lebanese crisis will not be resolved by military means,''
Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal read from the
declaration of the Tripartite Supreme Arab Committee comprising
Saudi Arabia's King Fahd, Moroccan King Hassan II and Algerian
President Chadli Bendjedid.
   It said the cease-fire is necessary ``to stop the bloodshed and
establish an atmosphere conducive to assuring the return of
security, stability and national reconciliation.''
   The call followed a night of savage shelling duels in Beirut that
killed 12 people and wounded 72 others. Saud could offer no
guarantee for the success of this latest in a string of cease-fire
efforts by the 22-member Arab League.
   ``The committee possesses no weapons with which it would impose
its will in Lebanon,'' Saud said.
   But he said Syria, whose troops are battling the Christians in
Lebanon, supports the new peace plan.
   The declaration called on all parties to stop supplying weapons
to the combatants and said the committee already has received
``positive responses in this regard.''
   Iraq has been arming the Christians. Syria backs Lebanon's
Moslems, who want a bigger share of power in the country
traditionally dominated by the minority Christians.
   A ``Lebanese Security Committee'' to be headed by Algerian
diplomat Lakhdar will implement and oversee the cease-fire,
monitoring all ships reported to be carrying weapons or ammunition,
Saud said.
   As soon as the security body begins its work, naval blockades
would be lifted and Beirut International Airport reopened, the
declaration said.
   Ibrahimi is expected in Beirut on Sunday and also is to negotiate
the location of a Sept. 30 meeting of the Lebanese parliament ``to
discuss and prepare the National Reconciliation Charter.''
   The Arab League has blamed the failure of previous peace efforts
mainly on Syria's refusal to withdraw its 40,000 troops from
Lebanon. Damascus wants to link such a pullout to the withdrawal of
Israeli troops in southern Lebanon.
   ``In the final analysis all foreign non-Lebanese forces will have
to leave Lebanon,'' said Saud.

<HEAD>Delicate Dance Around Race Highlights Virginia Campaign for Governor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE TAYLOR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After months of delicately dancing around
questions about race, Virginia's candidates for governor suddenly
were confronted by the issue with the Labor Day rioting by blacks in
Virginia Beach.
   Democrat L. Douglas Wilder and Republican J. Marshall Coleman,
though, have stuck to their caution steps.
   Wilder, seeking to become the first elected black governor of a
U.S. state, distanced himself last week from any appearance of being
sympathetic to the unrest and claims by black leaders of police
misconduct in quelling the violence.
   Coleman, who has said he will not let Wilder use race as a shield
to avoid tough questions, has been careful on his part to avoid any
comment that could be construed as racially inflammatory.
   The rioting Sept. 3 and 4 coincided with a fraternity festival
that annually draws thousands of students from predominantly black
colleges along the East Coast to the resort city.
   Rioters looted more than 100 businesses, and police arrested
about 220 people. Afterward, many of the students visiting the beach
complained that they were harassed by police and sometimes beaten as
authorities imposed a curfew after the looting and tried to clear
the ocean-front strip.
   The state NAACP chapter has asked Gov. Gerald L. Baliles to
appoint a commission to conduct a state investigation. The U.S.
Justice Department and the FBI are already reviewing the matter.
   ``Violence of this type _ of any type _ will not be condoned or
tolerated while Doug Wilder is governor,'' Wilder said Monday in a
visit to Norfolk, just a few miles from Virginia Beach. ``I will
take whatever measures are necessary to enforce this promise.''
   Wilder, the state's lieutenant governor, has been fighting
Republican efforts to make him appear soft on crime. He made no
mention of the allegations against police.
   Instead, he supported Baliles, a fellow Democrat who by law
cannot run for a second consecutive term, in calling out state
police and National Guard troops as backups for Virginia Beach
officers during the rioting.
   Wilder ``is trying to be fair,'' said Laura Dillard, his press
secretary. He steered clear of the complaints against police
``because it is still under investigation,'' she said.
   Coleman, a one-time moderate from the Shenandoah Valley whose
1989 campaign has taken on a more conservative slant, also called
Baliles' response ``necessary and appropriate under the
circumstances.''
   ``Such lawlessness can never be justified or condoned,'' Coleman
said, adding that he saw nothing racial about the episode.
   ``Given the volatility of the situation and the intense
emotionalism that surrounds it, it is absolutely essential that
public officials and private citizens refrain from politicizing this
regrettable incident,'' he said.
   Polls show the two sides about even.
   In 1977, when Coleman won the race for attorney general, he
received substantial support from black voters.
   But Wilder is expected to draw 90 percent or more of the state's
minority vote this year, partly because he is black and partly
because Coleman does not have the advantage, as he did 12 years ago,
of having a former segregationist as an opponent.
   Wilder's law-and-order comments apparently have not hurt his
standing among blacks, who comprise 17 percent of the state's
population.
   ``What he's saying is consistent with what the NAACP has been
saying,'' said Jack W. Gravely, president of the Virginia chapter of
the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
   ``We have condemned the looting. We have condemned the violation
of the law,'' Gravely said. ``We don't feel he's turning his back on
us.''
   Patrick Buchanan, a conservative newspaper columnist and one-time
aide to former President Reagan, sees the Virginia Beach rioting as
damaging to Wilder.
   ``I think this racial violence in Virginia Beach and the fact
that it's been nationalized by the TV media are really going to
finish him off in Virginia,'' Buchanan said on a syndicated
television program last week.
   However, Tom Morris, a University of Richmond political analyst,
said neither side can do anything to turn the event to his
advantage, particularly Coleman.
   ``But it was unfortunate for Wilder, because it's a reminder that
there are racial tensions in our society lurking below the surface
and they can break through at any time,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Activists pledged to expand their
anti-apartheid campaign Saturday as they buried victims of election
night violence in black and mixed-race townships outside Cape Town.
   Police were present at the four funerals Saturday, but kept a low
profile as part of a new government policy not to disrupt peaceful
demonstrations and gatherings.
   ``Death will not deter those struggling for a free South
Africa,'' the Rev. Lionel Louw told about 4,000 mourners at St.
Augustine's Anglican Church in the mixed-race township of Grassy
Park.
   ``Do you see the blood of our martyrs? Can you hear them speak?
These are atrocities committed against our people. We can't allow
(police) brutality and call it law and order any longer,'' Louw said
at the service for Pedro Page.
   Page, 18, was one of at least 23 people of black and mixed-race
that activists say were killed the night of Sept. 6 in violence
instigated by police.
   Police gradually have raised their figures in recent days and now
say there were 10 deaths in black-on-black faction fighting and nine
killings in which police may have been responsible.
   The mourners traveled two miles from the church to the cemetery,
guided by young activists serving as volunteer traffic marshals.
   The only visible police were traffic officers, and some gave
their bright orange vests to the marshals and watched from afar.
   Asked how he felt about the marshals taking over his job, one
mixed-race policeman said, ``I think it's wonderful.''
   In the past, police have placed tight restrictions on the
funerals of activists and prohibited political speeches at the
ceremonies.
   Two funerals were held in the black township of Khayelitsha, and
prominent activist Rev. Allan Boesak led a funeral service for
13-year-old Patrick Muller in the mixed-race township of Bellville.
   Boesak said activists would resume marches on ``whites-only''
beaches beginning Sept. 30 and would extend major protest actions to
the southern cities of the eastern Cape Province. He called on the
government not to act against a huge anti-apartheid convention set
for Oct. 7 in Johannesburg.
   The Mass Democratic Movement, a loosely-based anti-apartheid
coalition, launched a nationwide campaign of defiance on Aug. 2. The
organized demonstrations aimed at segregated schools, hospitals,
beaches, buses and other facilities have been peaceful.
   However, spontaneous clashes have erupted repeatedly between
young activists and police, particularly in the townships
surrounding Cape Town.
   President-elect F.W. de Klerk, in a major policy shift, announced
Tuesday that the white-led government would not block peacful
protests, which previously had almost always been banned.
   More than 20,000 people joined a Cape Town march Wednesday
against police brutality, the largest such demonstration ever
authorized by the government.
   About 15,000 chanting protesters marched through the heart of
Johannesburg and 2,000 took over the central square of the capital,
Pretoria, on Friday.
   All the demonstrations have been peaceful and the only reported
police action has been against white hecklers.
   De Klerk, who will be sworn in for a five-year term Wednesday,
has portrayed himself as a reformer who wants to bring the 28
million black majority into the national government on a limited
basis within five years.
   He has said he wants to begin negotiations with black leaders on
a new constitution. But Boesak said conditions for such talks would
include lifting the 3-year-old state of emergency, releasing
political prisoners such as Nelson Mandela, and legalizing
organizations such as Mandela's African National Congress guerrilla
movement.
   De Klerk announced Saturday that Gerrit Viljoen, a former
minister of black education, will spearhead the negotiations for the
government. The Cambridge-educated Viljoen, 63, has a reputation as
a bookish, soft-spoken, political moderate close to de Klerk.
   In another development, Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok will
meet early this week with 40 mixed-race policemen, including Lt.
Gregory Rockman.
   Rockman has become a folk hero among township youths since he
began accusing police riot units of causing violence by beating
protesters, bystanders and shoppers during anti-election
demonstrations.
   ``(Police) are going to tag me as a terrorist and a Communist,''
Rockman, 30, said Friday at a memorial service for one of the
victims of the election violence, 13-year-old Leonard Ras.
   But, he added, other policemen ``have the same ideas and views as
me and this is a sign of hope for us in South Africa. I know I am
not alone.''

<TEXT>
   Florida already is in its worst dry spell since the
1950s and its annual six-month dry spell is less than two weeks
away, meaning little relief can be expected before spring.
   With most of the state already under voluntary or mandatory
water-use restrictions, the outlook of water managers, farmers and
environmentalists has turned from caution to concern.
   ``We may go into the dry season with one of the lowest reservoir
storage levels in recent history,'' said Broward County Water
Resources Management Director Roy Reynolds.
   On Thursday, the South Florida Water Management District board
declared a water emergency and urged voluntary water cutbacks by
almost 4 million people in Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties.
   Lake Okeechobee, a principal source of drinking water for
residents of southern Florida, is about 3 feet below its normal
level for this time of year.
   To boost the lake's level, the water board decided to pump farm
water runoff into it. That runoff normally would flow south through
the Everglades.
   Environmentalists attacked the so-called ``back-pumping,'' saying
the phosphorus-rich runoff promotes algae growth that robs marine
life of oxygen.
   The restrictions, which may become mandatory next month, include
limiting car washing and lawn watering to three times a week between
4 a.m. and 8 a.m., said Tilford Creel, the deputy director of the
district, which covers 16 counties from south of Orlando to the Keys.
   During the 12-month-old drought, responsible for extensive brush
fires in the Everglades last year that occasionally shrouded Miami
in smoke, rainfall has been below normal in all sections of the
state, except the Panhandle.
   ``This is the all-time low in what we have for total surface
water storage,'' said Creel.
   In the 16-county Southwest Florida Water Management District,
which includes St. Petersburg and Tampa, mandatory water
restrictions have been in effect since February.
   The tough measures have generated some spirited vigilantism.
   In Bonita Springs, for example, the local newspaper has printed
the names and addresses of residents ticketed for water violations.
   Penalties for violating the mandatory restrictions in the
Palatka-based St. Johns River district could go as high as $500 and
60 days in jail, although most people receive only a warning for a
first violation, said spokesman Ed Albanesi.
   ``People just assumed the water was going to be there. But
attitude is slowly beginning to turn around,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Former President Jimmy Carter said
Saturday that Nicaragua's relations with the United States will
improve if the Sandinistas hold free and fair elections next year.
   Carter came to this Central American country as head of a
delegation that is to observe the electoral process here and the
balloting on Feb. 25.
   The former president also observed Panama's May 7 elections and
called them fraudulent. Panamanian leader Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega had the elections canceled when, according to Carter and
other international observers, the opposition candidate won by a
landslide.
   Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government, the 14-party
opposition coalition and the Supreme Electoral Council sent an
invitation for observers to the Council of Freely Elected Heads of
Government, based at the Carter Center at Emory University in
Atlanta, Ga.
   The Supreme Electoral Council is to organize and supervise the
balloting.
   Former President Raul Alfonsin of Argentina, a member of the
delegation, sat next to Carter and his wife, Rosalynn, at a news
conference at Managua's international airport.
   ``If President Alfonsin and I and others can certify in February
that the elections have been honest and fair and that the successful
candidates are the legitimate leaders of Nicaragua, this would
almost ensure, in my opinion, an immediate improvement in relations
between the United States and Nicaragua,'' Carter said in answer to
a question.
   He said he knew of existing ``differences'' between the
opposition and President Daniel Ortega's government. But he said it
would be premature to address those issues until he had a chance to
speak with all sides.
   Asked what lessons he had learned during the Panamanian elections
that could be applied to his current task, Carter replied: ``From
what I know to date, those means used to have a fraudulent election
in Panama have been carefully avoided for Nicaragua.''
   Referring to an aborted Bush administration plan to channel $3
million in aid to opposition presidential candidate Violeta Barrios
de Chamorro, Carter said any campaign contributions ``should be open
and overt in nature and comply completely with the laws in
Nicaragua.''
   The project, which would have channeled the money through the
National Endowment for Democracy, was canceled because of opposition
in Congress.
   Mrs. Chamorro, publisher of the opposition newspaper La Prensa,
is being fielded by the National Opposition Union coalition.
   Carter also denied speculation that he may be representing the
U.S. government, and said his delegation would remain impartial in
its observations.
   Observers from the United Nations and the Organization of America
States also have been invited to monitor the process.
   The United States has not had an ambassador in Nicaragua since
Richard Melton was expelled in mid-1988 along with several other
embassy officials, accused by the government of instigating unrest.

   An assailant opened fire Saturday on an Israeli
army patrol from the Jordanian side of the border, slightly injuring
two soldiers in the third such attack this month.
   In the occupied territories, clashes between Palestinian youths
and Israeli soldiers reportedly injured four Arabs, and a
Palestinian man shot in a clash with troops last week died of his
injuries.
   Leaders of Israel's two main parties met Saturday to discuss a
Middle East peace plan offered by Egypt. Two meetings last week
failed to bridge differences over the plan, which calls for
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.
   The border incident occurred in pre-dawn darkness near the
communal settlement of Ashdot Yakov, three miles south of the Sea of
Galilee.
   Israel radio said the assailant apparently was a Jordanian army
soldier who ran to the border and ambushed the Israeli patrol,
firing about 30 rounds while hiding behind a bush. The Israelis
returned fire.
   A Jordanian army spokesman told Jordan's official news agency,
Petra, that a Jordanian soldier fired at an ``unusual movement''
along the Jordan River and that ``Israeli patrol cars ... fired in
the same direction and that resulted in a slight injury to one of
our people.''
   Another Jordanian official told The Associated Press the
firefight appeared to be ``an accident.''
   ``It was night, and when you are on the cease-fire line, (you
know) how alert you are to any unusual movement,'' he said.
   The Israeli soldiers suffered slight shrapnel wounds.
   It was the sixth attack this year on Israel from along the
Jordan-Israel border and the third this month. The most recent
attack occurred Sept. 7, when several Soviet-designed Katyusha
rockets were fired from Jordan into Israel. There were no injuries.
   In the occupied territories, Palestinians paralyzed the West Bank
city of Nablus with a general strike to protest the deaths Friday of
two Palestinian youths shot by Israeli troops.
   Another Palestinian, 45-year-old Samir al Akhbar, died Saturday
of wounds suffered in a clash with troops last week, officials at
Anglican Hospital in Nablus said.
   Arab reports said Akhbar was shot in the back while trying to
keep soldiers from beating his son.
   Israeli officials said he was shot when he tried to grab a
soldier's gun.
   His death raised to 571 the number of Palestinians killed in
clashes with Israelis in the 21-month-old uprising against Israeli
rule of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Forty Israelis have died, and
114 Arabs accused of collaborating with Israel have been killed by
other Arabs.
   Arab reporters said four Palestinians were wounded in clashes
Saturday. The army said it was checking the reports.
   Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak proposed a 10-point peace plan
that includes Palestinian elections in the West Bank and Gaza Strip
and Israeli-Palestinian peace talks in Cairo that would include two
Arabs deported from the occupied lands.
   That aspect of the plan is designed to satisfy Israel's demand to
talk only to Palestinians from the territories and the PLO's
insistence that Palestinians living abroad be included in talks.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's right-wing Likud bloc and the
left-leaning Labor Party led by Finance Minister Shimon Peres are
deeply divided over the plan.
   Labor leaders have indicated their willingness to talk to a
delegation including deported Arabs, but Likud officials view it as
an attempt to bring in the Palestine Liberation Organization through
the back door.

   A sniper shot and killed a
British soldier who was working Saturday on a police station radio
antenna, police reported. The IRA claimed responsibility.
   Police said Staff Sgt. Kevin Froggett, 35, was repairing the
antenna when he was hit by a burst of gunfire shortly after midnight
at Coalisland, 30 miles west of Belfast.
   A second soldier who also was on the radio tower escaped unhurt
when the sniper fired 30 shots, police said.
   The British Broadcasting Corp. reported the Irish Republican Army
claimed responsibility. The mainly Roman Catholic Irish Republican
Army wants to unite the predominantly Protestant British province
with the 95 percent Catholic Republic of Ireland under socialist
rule.
   Froggett, married and the father of four children, came from
Derby, England. He had served in the army for 19 years.
   He was the 46th person to be killed in sectarian warfare in
Northern Ireland this year.

   Senior leader Deng Xiaoping appeared in public
Saturday for the first time in more than three months, looking tan
and healthy despite recent reports he was seriously ill or even near
death.
   National television news showed the 85-year-old leader laughing,
gesturing animatedly and walking steadily at the start of a
70-minute meeting at the Great Hall of the People with T.D. Lee, a
Nobel Prize-winning physicist from Columbia University.
   He displayed his bronzed hand to Lee, and said he had been
swimming for up to an hour a day in the sea. ``I don't like indoor
swimming pools,'' he was heard to say, ``but enjoy swimming in
nature.''
   Deng reportedly spent part of the past three months, among the
most traumatic in Communist China's history, at Beidaihe, a favorite
resort for top officials along the northeast coast.
   Deng, China's most powerful leader, has cut down on his public
duties in recent years and has often disappeared for long periods,
each time sparking rumors he is seriously ill.
   But this time both Chinese and foreign sources consistently
reported that he was being treated for prostate cancer and may not
have long to live. The lively Hong Kong press in recent weeks
reported Deng to be in a coma or already dead.
   Deng's last public appearance was on June 9, when he
congratulated martial law officers for their leadership in quelling
what he called a ``counter-revolutionary rebellion'' intent on
overthrowing the Communist Party and the government.
   Troops stormed Beijing June 3 and June 4, killing hundreds and
perhaps thousands of people as they shot their way to
student-occupied Tiananmen Square.
   Deng also is believed to have had the ultimate say in the
decision, announced June 24, to purge Communist Party General
Secretary Zhao Ziyang and accuse him of splitting the party by
supporting the pro-democracy goals of the student protesters.
   Zhao, the top advocate of economic reforms initiated by Deng 10
years ago, has not been seen in public since May 19. He is believed
to be under house arrest while the party decides whether to press
criminal charges against him.
   Deng, in an apparent reference to Zhao, said Saturday that ``some
of our comrades just immersed themselves in their specific work, did
not pay enough attention to ideological and political developments,
were not vigilant enough against the serious corruption.''
   ``The recent turmoil has taught us a major lesson,'' Deng said.
``After the turmoil, all of us have become sober-minded.''
   Deng, whose support of economic reforms has generally been
tempered by a hard line against political dissent, said China will
not change its policies of reform.
   But he added that China must stick to socialism. ``There would be
no new China today without the leadership of the Communist Party,''
he said.
   Deng also echoed the conservative line on reform by saying
production must develop at ``an appropriate pace,'' rather than the
rapid pace preferred by Zhao that is now being blamed for inflation
and corruption.
   Deng's comments, as carried by television news and the official
Xinhua News Agency, did not specifically mention Zhao.
   In 1987, Deng retired from all his official posts except the
powerful chairmanship of the Central Military Commission. However,
he is still regarded as the only man powerful enough to maintain a
truce among the party's different factions, and rumors of his death
invariably raise fears of a destabilizing power struggle.
   In recent days, Chinese officials have suggested Deng was about
to emerge in public, possibly to reassure the Chinese people before
Oct. 1 _ the 40th anniversary of the People's Republic _ that the
government leadership is intact.
   Lee, a Chinese-American who won the Nobel Prize for physics in
1957 and is a frequent visitor to China, was not available for
comment on his meeting with Deng or a luncheon afterwards.
   Lee also met later with Zhao's successor as party chief, Jiang
Zemin, who spoke of current efforts to help students ``enhance their
political awareness and make a clear distinction between right and
wrong.'' Those efforts include heavy doses of political education.
   Xinhua said Jiang also told Lee that Chinese leaders have shown
``much concern'' for civilians injured or killed during the military
takeover of the city.
   China says about 300 people were killed during the clashes, but
Chinese leaders have made no public statements of remorse for the
bloodshed and the official media have not reported on civilians who
lost their lives.

<HEAD>Company Plans Reopening of Railway to Grand Canyon</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WILLIAMS, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A railroad track abandoned 21 years ago
will carry paying passengers again beginning Monday with restoration
of service to Grand Canyon National Park.
   The 64-mile Grand Canyon Railway, originally a spur serving
people crossing the high country of northern Arizona on the Santa Fe
railroad, will carry tourists arriving in this town of 2,500 on
Interstate 40, which largely replaced old U.S. 66.
   The developers hope the romance of their steam locomotives and
the scenery along the tracks will persuade tourists to park their
cars and pay the fare rather than drive to the canyon. Fars for the
round trip will be $37 for adults and $21 for children under 12.
   A ceremonial trip for public officials and other railroad guests
was scheduled Sunday, the 88th anniversary of the first passenger
service on the original line.
   The rail line passes through dramatic scenery, including
ponderosa pine forests near Williams, the sparse plains of the high
plateau and steep canyons near the northern terminus, in Grand
Canyon Village only 200 yards from the Grand Canyon's South Rim.
   Grand Canyon National Park spokesman Chuck Lundy said train
travel could help the environment of the South Rim, visited by
810,000 private vehicles and 3{ million people last year.
   A Northern Arizona University study found that enough people
would opt for a train ride to the canyon to reduce road traffic by
41 percent, Lundy said.
   ``We don't see the train as being our solution, but we do see it
as one ingredient, one element of that solution. We're very
supportive and pleased that the railroad is returning,'' he said.
   Part of the $85 million project cost has gone to collect and
restore enough locomotives and passenger cars to accommodate a
projected 135,000 passengers next year. Some has been spent to
replace rails and 30,000 weather-worn ties.
   The railroad is the brainchild of Max Biegert, an engineer who
owns a commercial aviation company in Chandler.
   Biegert wound up holding title to 22 miles of track along the
line after a developer defaulted on a loan. He hired Roth as a
consultant, and they put together an investment package which raised
$15 million to organize the company and buy land.
   The company has purchased four locomotives and 29 coach cars
built by the Pullman Co., which have been repainted original Pullman
green, said spokeswoman Kathleen Boyd.

   An empty Exxon oil tanker lost power and drifted
about an hour in the Strait of Juan de Fuca before regaining some
maneuverability and heading for Port Angeles, the Coast Guard said.
   The 810-foot Exxon San Francisco lost power about 8:30 p.m.
Friday as it was 33 miles west of Port Angeles and five miles north
of Slip Point, near the west end of the strait, said Petty Officer
Sandy Calhoun in Seattle.
   Three Coast Guard cutters and a helicopter responded from Port
Angeles, but the ship had regained about 40 percent of its
maneuverability by the time they arrived, Ms. Calhoun said.
   The Coast Guard vessels escorted the ship to Port Angeles.
   The cause of the problem was not immediately released.
   Last March, the Exxon Valdez struck a reef in Alaska's Prince
William Sound and spilled about 11 million gallons of oil in the
nation's worst oil spill.
   The Strait of Juan de Fuca connects Puget Sound and the Pacific
Ocean. Tankers, many carrying Alaska crude oil, travel the strait
regularly to and from refineries near the Sound.

   Fugitive Chinese student leaders and China
scholars gathered Saturday to assess the impact of the bloody
crackdown on student demonstrators in Beijing and prospects for
democracy in China _ and to remember.
   The conference at Brandeis University on the June massacre in
Beijing began with a moment of silence led by Shen Tong, who was on
the Chinese authorities' most-wanted list when he escaped from
China. He is attending Brandeis on a scholarship.
   ``My feelings were almost frozen,'' Shen said, recalling the
night of June 3 when government troops came to clear out student
protesters who had taken over Tiananmen Square in the Chinese
capital. He said he was trying to negotiate with the soldiers when
they opened fire.
   ``When I was speaking to one of the soldiers on a truck that had
stopped, the officer of the truck shot a girl standing next to me.
She was shot in the face,'' he said.
   Hundreds, perhaps thousands, of people are believed to have been
killed.
   How the massacre happened and what can be done to keep the
democracy movement in China going were the focus of the two-day
conference titled ``Perspectives on Tiananmen.''
   Participants included Rep. Stephen Solarz, D-N.Y., who warned of
stiffened U.S. sanctions against China if the repression there
continues; Li Lu, second in command among the student demonstrators
in Beijing; and Wu'er Kaixi, who made a dangerous 10-day journey to
escape his country.
   Saturday's conference opening had the feel of a reunion as many
Chinese students who had not seen one another since the
demonstration embraced and exchanged news.
   Yuan Liu, president of the Newton-based China Information Center,
which has dispensed news to and from China all summer, was busy
passing on the latest information from his contacts in China. Among
other things, he said the number of students at Beijing's major
universities allowed to take courses in humanities has been halved
and that many students will be required to spend a year in the army
for what he called ``brainwashing.''
   Shen, 21, told of his escape, saying that after being hidden for
days by friends, he went to the Beijing airport and presented his
passport, which had been issued earlier because he was already
planning to study at Brandeis. In an apparent mistake by
authorities, he was ushered on board his flight.
   ``I think that change in China is inexorable,'' Shen said. ``But
what I really care about is, after there is a leadership change,
what can we do?'' He said students in China and out must continue to
work toward gradual change.
   Li Lu, who marshaled demonstrators as the deputy student leader
at the Tiananmen rally, said the future of the pro-democracy
movement depends on breaking through the propaganda the Chinese
government disseminated after the massacre.
   ``Information is power,'' said Li. ``In the future, the democracy
movement in China must be a cooperative effort between students
inside and outside of China.''
   Solarz, chairman of the House Subcommittee on East Asian and
Pacific Affairs, said the pro-democracy movement must continue to
emphasize non-violence. ``I do not think that armed violence is a
solution to the problems of China,'' he said.
   But he did say the United States would be willing to impose
tougher sanctions on the Chinese government if repression deepened.
   Solarz criticized President Bush's reaction to events in China as
a ``tepid response.''
   ``The president seemed to have trouble finding his own voice,''
Solarz said. ``There were times, indeed, when he seemed more in
sympathy with the difficulties of the party leaders than he was with
the aspirations of the people.''

   Calm has returned to the dusty streets of
this port for the first time since the wreck of the Exxon Valdez,
but the tranquility belies the social friction caused by the big
spill, Big Oil and big bucks.
   Valdez was flush this summer with millions of dollars spent in
cleaning up the nation's largest oil spill. Thousands of job-seekers
came here for a chance to earn more than $16 an hour sopping up oil.
   The motels were full. Business was good.
   Last week, Exxon halted its summer cleanup, pulling its laborers
off the shores of Prince William Sound and sending them home, saying
the shortening daylight hours and worsening weather made further
work ill-advised this time of year. Now Valdez faces a long winter
of problems they left behind.
   The 16-bed jail is full and the court docket is backed up because
of a record number of summer arrests. There's a housing shortage. A
cleanup-caused labor shortage persists, but some employers are
reluctant to rehire workers who abandoned their jobs last spring for
Exxon's high wages.
   ``It was short-term bucks, and in the end it's going to do a lot
of damage to this town,'' said Roger Smith, manager of a local
hardware store.
   The small town at the foot of the Chugach Mountains was the end
of the rainbow for the laborers who came in the spring. But most
will spend their pot of gold elsewhere. Even many of the cleanup
workers who were Valdez residents are returning only briefly before
taking off on extended vacations to warmer locales.
   That has sparked tensions among the town's 3,700 residents.
   ``They're not sticking around,'' Smith said. ``We'd like to
expand, but we can't seem to get anyone to work. Most of these guys
made so much money they're leaving town.''
   Still, Smith and other merchants said they profited from the boom
that came from the effort to clean up 11 million gallons of North
Slope crude oil that spilled when the tanker Exxon Valdez hit a reef
in Prince William Sound on March 24.
   ``Business has been real good,'' Smith said. ``It was crazy. We
normally would deal with 200 to 300 people a day. We were dealing
with over a thousand. We sold stuff we never dreamed of selling.''
   Business remains brisk at the Pipeline Club, a popular watering
hole since the days of the construction boom for the trans-Alaska
oil pipeline, which terminates at Port Valdez.
   Bill Lee, manager and co-owner, said he extended the bar's hours
because of the demand. It opens at 8 a.m. and closes at 5 a.m.
   ``It's even better than the pipeline days,'' Lee said. ``As long
as the spill had to happen, it certainly helped the economic picture
of this town.''
   The town's economy is expected to remain strong with more than
200 new long-term jobs created by the cleanup. City officials are
most concerned about the prospect of a winter of social problems
generated by so many people with bulging wallets and time on their
hands.
   ``We're going to have a fair amount of our residents who are
going to have a lot of money in their pockets to spend,'' city
planner Gary Hennigh said. ``In the middle of winter boredom sets
in, cabin fever, and that's the time when tempers get shorter. There
probably has to be some sociological downside to this.''
   Police Chief Bert Cottle already has seen the downside.
   ``The calls that we're getting now are of a more serious nature
as far as violence is concerned,'' he said. ``It's been a long
summer. More people are stressed out.''
   Alcohol figures in more than 70 percent of the complaints Valdez
police are responding to, Cottle said. Some cleanup workers are
drowning their sorrows after spending, gambling or otherwise losing
their summer riches.
   ``We're seeing people who have been sending their paychecks home
all summer, expecting to come back to $20,000 in the bank. Instead
they've got a `Dear John' letter waiting,'' Cottle said.
   The demand for housing caused by the influx of new residents
shows no sign of letting up. Lynn Wolf, publisher of the Valdez
Vanguard, said people still line up at the front desk on Tuesdays
for an advance peek at the few housing ads that will appear when the
weekly newspaper is published on Wednesdays.

<HEAD>Blacks and Whites Pay Tribute To Slain Guerrilla Leader</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of people packed a church in a
black suburb Saturday to pay tribute to Anton Lubowski, a leader in
the Namibian nationalist movement who was assassinated outside his
home.
   ``In a racially divided country such as ours, Comrade Anton's
role as a bridge builder will be sorely missed,'' said Theo-Ben
Gurirab, foreign affairs chief of the South-West Africa People's
Organization.
   Lubowski, 37, was shot in the head with an AK-47 assault rifle
outside his Windhoek home Tuesday night. Police are holding
50-year-old Irishman Donald Acheson in connection with the killing,
but no one has been charged.
   Lubowski was the only ranking white member of the Namibian
nationalist guerrilla movement against South African rule.
   The Lutheran Church in the Katutura neighborhood was overflowing,
and about 200 people listened from outside the church doors to the
service for the man to be buried this week.
   Lubowski's parents, his ex-wife and two children were there,
along with several diplomats such as Robin Renwick, Britain's
ambassador to South Africa. ``Nothing can justify so callous a
murder of a man ... who devoted the best part of his time to
fighting for a truly non-racial Namibia,'' Gurirab said. ``Did it
really have to happen now, at a time when his country and people
needed him most?''
   Namibia, which has been ruled by South Africa since 1915, is
having elections in November expected to lead to independence early
next year.
   South Africa agreed to implement independence under U.N.
supervision after signing a regional peace treaty last year that
also calls for the withdrawal of Cuba's 50,000 soldiers from Angola.
   The South-West Africa People's Organization, which waged a
23-year bush war for black majority rule, is favored to win the most
votes.
   Lubowski, a prominent human rights lawyer, in 1984 became the
first white to publicly declare his support for the guerrilla-backed
organization. He joined its legal political wing and served as the
group's unofficial spokesman in Windhoek while most of the
leadership was in exile.
   Right-wing newspapers often ridiculed Lubowski for belonging to
the leftist-oriented organization.
   Lubowski studied at two of South Africa's best universities,
Stellenbosch and Cape Town, and at one point was an officer in the
South African army.
   His law practice was based in Windhoek, but he represented many
anti-apartheid activists on trial in neighboring South Africa.
   Lubowski helped represent 14 blacks sentenced to death for the
mob killing of a black policeman in 1985. Four days before
Lubowski's death, the 14 won an appeal to have their case retried.

<HEAD>Scientist Issues Climate Warning, Seeks Fossil Fuel Cut</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sharp cuts in the use of fossil fuels like oil,
gas and coal are necessary to help prevent climate change that could
cause dangerous overheating of the earth, a leading scientist warned
Saturday.
   George M. Woodwell, director of the Woods Hole Research Center,
told a conference at the Smithsonian Institution that restrictions
on the use of fossil fuels, an end to deforestation and a start on
reforestation ``are essential.''
   ``We are failing foolishly and dangerously'' to deal with
environmental threats, Woodwell said at the conference on ``The
Global Environment, Are We Overreacting.''
   Woodwell focused largely on the so-called Greenhouse effect, the
threat of global warming which many scientists fear will result from
the continued introduction of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.
   A colorless, odorless gas, carbon dioxide allows warmth from the
sun to continue heating the Earth, but keeps portions of the Earth's
warmth from radiating out into space.
   The result, many researchers fear, will be an overheating of the
planet, changing climate and possibly seriously damaging crops and
other forms of life.
   Asked for a solution, Woodwell said: ``Well, you do some pretty
straightforward things. You reduce the release of fossil fuel carbon
into the atmosphere by restricting the use of fossil fuel. How much?
Maybe all of it. ... You stop deforestation and you start
reforestation.''
   Paul R. Ehrlich of Stanford University suggested that Americans
should be paying at least $2.30-a-gallon for gasoline, since
automobiles and trucks are a major carbon dioxide source.
   ``If it didn't cut consumption, it would at least reduce the
deficit,'' said Ehrlich, referring to the additional money that
would be raised by taxing gasoline to raise the price to that level.
   While scientists have measured a 25 percent increase in
atmospheric carbon dioxide over the last century, debate continues
about the Greenhouse warming and whether it can yet be measured.
   Several scientists have urged a wait-and-see attitude, contending
that natural fources such as increased cloudiness could restore
balance to the planet.
   ``Most of the projections about the future are not verifiable
without performing an experiment, and it gets performed on guess
what laboratory?'' said Stephen Schneider of the National Center for
Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo.
   Gene E. Likens of the New York Botanical Gardens pointed out that
dangerous air pollution has become so common that scientists have
begun speaking of ``pollution climates'' in some areas, particularly
parts of the United States, Europe and Asia.
   ``Chemicals released into the air come back to us in the form of
rainout or fallout. The point is, what goes up does come down, and
sometimes it travels great distances before it does so,'' added
Bruce A. Fowler of the University of Maryland.

<HEAD>Kissinger Defends China Business</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   WASHINGTON _ Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger said
Saturday his private business dealings in China do not represents a
conflict with his statements as a former public official.
   Kissinger's comment on CNN's ``Newsmaker Saturday'' came in
reaction to an article Friday in The Wall Street Journal dealing
with his business interests in China.
   ``I was involved in the opening of China,'' said Kissinger. ``I
have a record of 20 years of writing and speaking on China. For four
years after I left government I did not do any commercial
activities. For six years I did not do any consulting activities.
   Kissinger said national government service and ``serving my
country has been my principal objective and to assume that any
commercial consideration could affect the judgments that I expressed
publicly is an outrage and it is a form of intimidation by which
people who disagree with me are trying to keep me from expressing my
views.''
   The Journal reported Kissinger has extensive business interests
in China, including the establishment of a $75 million fund to be
raised from U.S. investors for joint ventures with the merchant
banking arm of the Chinese government.
   In addition, his consulting firm, Kissinger Associates, counsels
several businesses on how to conduct operations overseas and,
specifically, in their dealings with China, the Journal reported.
   A spokeswoman for ABC News said Friday that the network would not
have used Kissinger as a paid expert on a China special last June
had it known of his business ties there.

   An 8-year-old boy turned in his mother for
allegedly smoking marijuana two days after he listened to President
Bush's speech urging children to help people with drug problems,
police said.
   The boy, whose name police refused to reveal, approached Lt.
Vance Scioli and asked for help, Scioli said Friday.
   ``The boy was crying. He felt badly about it,'' Scioli said.
``But he took a stand against drugs. He was worried about his mom.''
   Acting on his tip, police arrested Darlene O'Hara, 27, and Boyd
Weber, 31, on Thursday in their apartment in the Buffalo suburb of
Depew. They were charged with with possession of cocaine, possession
of marijuana, possession of drug paraphernalia and endangering the
welfare of a child, Scioli said.
   The boy was turned over to his father, who is divorced from Ms.
O'Hara. Her other child, 6 months old, was turned over to child
welfare authorities.
   The boy's father told police the boy had listened to Bush's talk
on drugs, Scioli said. In that speech, which was broadcast Tuesday
and monitored in classrooms around the nation, the president urged
children to get help if they knew anyone who was using drugs.
   Scioli said he didn't take it seriously at first when the boy
approached him and said, ``My mom's selling and using coke and
marijuana. ... It ain't right.''
   Then the boy ran into his home and came back with a marijuana
pipe.
   Police watched the apartment overnight and raided it the next
day. Scioli said Ms. O'Hara was smoking a marijuana cigarette when
officers entered.
   Police found small amounts of marijuana, cocaine, drug
paraphernalia and $600 in cash. While making the search, a man
arrived at the apartment trying to buy drugs, Scioli said.
   The man, identified as Mark Spaick, 32, of Depew, was charged
with possession of marijuana, obstruction and resisting arrest.
   Ms. O'Hara, Weber and Spaick were held overnight at the Erie
County Holding Station and released Friday on $500 bail each.

   Lord Trafford, minister of state for
health, died Saturday of lung cancer, the government announced. He
was 57.
   The Department of Health said Trafford had been ill for a short
time and was admitted to a hospital Tuesday.
   A physician and former member of Parliament, Trafford helped
treat victims of the Irish Republican Army terrorist bombing of a
hotel in Brighton during a Conservative Party conference in 1984.
   Born July 20, 1932, Joseph Anthony Porteous Trafford graduated
from the University of London and Guy's Hospital medical school.
   He was a Fulbright Scholar in the United States in 1963 and
worked for a time in the Maryland welfare department. He was elected
to Parliament in 1970 but lost in the 1974 election.
   Trafford was knighted in 1985 and made a life peer in 1987. He
was appointed to the health ministry in July.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said, ``Those who suffered in
the bombing at Brighton in 1984 owe him an enormous debt of
gratitude.''
   Energy Secretary John Wakeham, one of those severely hurt in the
bombing, said that during four months of hospitalization Trafford
visited almost every evening for ``long political gossips'' and
``partly to keep me awake so that I didn't go to sleep too early and
therefore have a bad night. I found his depth of knowledge of many
subjects particularly history and politics, fascinating.''
   Conservative Party chairman Kenneth Clarke said Trafford's death
was a ``loss to the government and a loss to the public life of this
country.''
   Trafford is survived by his wife, Helen, and a son and a daughter.

   An explosion Saturday aboard a bus in the
ethnically troubled republic of Azerbaijan killed three people and
injured other passengers, the official Tass news agency said.
   In the republic's capital, Baku, the Azerbaijani Parliament ended
an emergency session with a call for direct control of an enclave
disputed with neighboring Armenia, the Tass news agency said.
   In its report on the explosion, Tass said the bus was traveling
from the Georgian capital of Tbilisi to Baku, on the Caspian Sea 300
miles to the southeast.
   The news agency did not link the explosion to the ethnic strife
between Armenians and Azerbaijanis. It said the KGB secret police
were investigating.
   Tass did not say how many people were injured, nor did it say how
many passengers were aboard the bus or give other details.
   About 100 people have been killed in ethnic violence during the
past 18 months in the conflict over control of the enclave of
Nagorno-Karabakh, which is predominantly Christian Armenian.
   The Armenians want the mountainous area, which is within
Azerbaijan's borders, to be transferred to their control.
Nagorno-Karabakh was in mainly Moslem Azerbaijan's jurisdiction
until February, when Moscow moved in to rule the enclave directly in
an effort to stem the violence.
   The conflict has forced hundreds of thousands of Armenians and
Azerbaijanis in the region to flee their homes.
   Tass reported the Azerbaijani Parliament's resolution on Saturday
claimed that Nagorno-Karabakh is legally part of Azerbaijan and
asked Moscow to reconsider its central rule over the area.
   In the Armenian capital of Yerevan a special session of the
republic's legislature was convened to discuss the Azerbaijani
resolution, the news agency also said.
   Communist Party officials are scheduled to meet Tuesday in Moscow
to consider changes in the country's nationalities policy and seek
ways to calm ethnic quarrels like the one between Azerbaijan and
Armenia.
   The Azerbaijani lawmakers will soon submit for public discussion
a proposed law ``to provide sovereignty of the republic, or
independent exercise of legislative, executive and judicial power
over the whole of the territory of the republic in the interests of
its multi-national population,'' Tass said.

   Pizza Hut is jumping into the fray in the
pizzas wars, urging diners not to make a ``Mcstake'' and try the
pizza McDonald's is offering at a few outlets. The upshot? An
outwardly mild-mannered war of words, half of them prefaced by
``mc.''
   The burger giant professes itself pleased with the Pizza Hut's
advertising counter-campaign, even though it goes so far as to
compare McDonald's pizza to a hockey puck.
   ``We want to thank them for giving our own ad campaign some extra
topping,'' said McDonald's spokesman Chuck Rubner, who said he was
``Mcdelighted'' with the attention.
   Pizza Hut launched the campaign in newspapers and on television
after McDonald's added pizza to the menu at 24 outlets in southern
Indiana and western Kentucky this summer. The burger colossus hopes
to lure families and couples during the dinner hour, a slack time
for much of the fast-food business.
   ``If you're looking for great pizza, make no Mcstake,'' Pizza Hut
fires back in some of its ads. ``We always use dough that's made
fresh daily. Not McFrozen.''
   A television ad shows hockey players taking slap shots at a
puck-shaped blob of frozen dough.
   Although Pizza Hut has about 22 percent of the $314
billion-a-year pizza market, it's not taking the McDonald's test
lightly.
   ``The television commercial is very humorous,'' said Roger
Rydell, a spokesman for Pizza Hut in Wichita, Kan. ``We're being,
however, very serious to our approach to the McDonald's threat.''

   A hurricane neared the Caribbean and a tropical depression spread
rain over the Southwest on Saturday, and rain fell across the
Midwest and much of the East.
   Hurricane Hugo headed for the Leeward Islands and hurricane
warnings were posted for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
Its highest sustained wind speed was about 140 mph, with stronger
gusts.
   Tropical depression Octave spread moist air over the Southwest.
Light rain caused slippery streets in the Los Angeles basin and fell
from San Diego to Santa Barbara. Thunderstorms over the Diablo
Mountains and Livermore Valley dropped about half an inch of rain
near Livermore, Calif.
   Showers and thunderstorms also extended over western Arizona.
   Showers and thunderstorms also extended over southern Lower
Michigan, Indiana, northern Ohio, Kentucky, West Virginia, western
New York state, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Virginia, Maryland, North
Carolina, eastern South Carolina, the Georgia coast and the Florida
coast.
   A tornado was reported on the ground in North Carolina's Lenoir
County on Saturday afternoon.
   Almost 4 inches of rain fell at Fayetteville, N.C., in two hours
late Friday and more rain fell overnight, causing flooding in which
two children drowned.
   In parts of West Virginia, creeks were swollen by more than 3
inches of rain Saturday, forcing some families to leave their homes
and drowning two people, authorities said.
   Elsewhere, showers were scattered over western Washington state.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 53 at
Bremerton and Everett, Wash., to 100 at Phoenix. Saturday's low for
the Lower 48 states was 19 at Gunnison, Colo.
   For Sunday, showers and thunderstorms were forecast from New
England and New York state across eastern South Carolina, eastern
Georgia and the Florida Peninsula, as well as from the Pacific Coast
across Montana, western Wyoming, Utah and Nevada.
   Highs in the 60s and 70s were predicted over New England and New
Jersey across the Great Lakes, the Ohio Valley and the Appalachians,
from Montana, Idaho, western Utah and northern Arizona across the
northern two-thirds of the Pacific Coast, and along the southern
coast of California; near 90 over much of Florida, much of Texas,
western Oklahoma and western sections of the central Plains; in the

   The Rev. Jesse Jackson said Saturday that his
Rainbow Coalition will go the districts of six Democratic
congressmen who voted to cut the capital gains tax, to alert their
constituents to the benefits the rich will gain.
   ``There is no justification for further subsidizing the rich
through the capital gains tax by abandoning the poor,'' said
Jackson. ``The capital gains tax is unfair. It is immoral. It must
be challenged.''
   On Thursday, the House Ways and Means Committee approved the tax
cut in an amendment to a larger tax bill. The reduction, sought by
President Bush, would lower the maximum tax rate on profits from
sales of assets from the current 33 percent to 19.6 percent for 2{
years.
   The rate then would be raised to 28 percent but assets would be
indexed to eliminate taxes based on increased value created by
inflation.
   The six, including Rep. Ed Jenkins, D-Ga., who co-sponsored the
amendment, joined with 13 Republicans to pass the proposal.
   But in so doing, the six Democrats incurred the wrath of
Democratic leadership.
   Jackson's action was supported at a news conference which was
attended by Democratic National Committee Chairman Ron Brown and
Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., a Ways and Means member.
   Brown called the tax ``unethical, immoral and it doesn't make
political sense'' for the Democratic party to ``give a tax break to
the wealthiest in our country'' at a time when the poor continue to
suffer.
   ``I think this is clear this is the worst example of Robin Hood
in reverse,'' Brown said.
   Former President Reagan attempted his version of trickle down
economics, Jackson said, in the belief the rich would help America
by reinvesting tax savings.
   ``They did not do that'' and the rich today probably won't
either, Jackson said. ``This is a payoff for the very elite of the
Bush campaign. It's not good for America.''
   Thus, Jackson said, the campaign was targeted at the ``six
Democrats who jumped ship and abandoned the party.''
   ``I'm concerned that these congressmen who broke rank'' have not
informed their constituents of their actions, and the poor and ``the
farmers are not aware of this,'' Jackson said.
   Besides Jenkins, the Democrats include Reps. J.J. Pickle of
Texas, Mike Andrews of Texas, Beryl Anthony of Arkansas, Andy Jacobs
of Indiana and Ronnie Flippo of Alabama.
   Rangel said his party was in a fight for its principles and that
the Democratic-controlled Congress had helped pass Republican
legislation the congressman said was bad for Americans and bad for
the party's principles.
   ``Certainly no six monkeys on the Ways and Means committee are
going to direct where my party is going,'' Rangel said.

<TEXT>
   The General Assembly opens its 44th session
Tuesday in New York still uncertain if PLO chief Yasser Arafat will
again seek to address the delegates.
   U.S. officials said the leader of the Palestine Liberation
Organization has not made a request for a visa. They declined to say
if one would be granted if Arafat did submit an application.
   Arafat was denied an entry visa last year to attend a U.N.
session in New York because U.S. officials said the PLO was backing
anti-Israeli terrorism. Instead, the international body convened a
meeting in Geneva where Arafat outlined his ideas about the PLO's
mission and its attitude toward Israel.
   At this year's General Assembly session the delegations of 159
nations will review such issues as the Middle East, the environment,
international debt, the war on drugs, and Namibia's transition to
independence.
   President Bush will address the assembly Sept. 25, the first day
of the three-week general debate. Soviet Foreign Minister Edouard
Shevardnadze is scheduled to appear the next day.
   Colombia's President Virgilio Barco Vargas will speak Sept. 29
about his nation's battle against its cocaine cartels.
   PLO officials have said Arafat is ``seriously considering''
attending the session. The Palestinian conflict is scheduled to be
discussed in November, but Arafat could address the assembly during
the general debate.
   Last year then-Secretary of State George Shultz denied Arafat a
visa, but since then the United States has opened direct talks with
the PLO in Tunisia.
   U.S. officials said last week the United States won't announce
whether it will grant a visa to Arafat until a new request is
received.
   U.S. and Arab sources said privately that the State Department is
divided over whether to grant such a request and Secretary of State
James Baker has not yet ruled on the issue.
   The Assembly is expected to choose a new president Tuesday,
replacing Argentina's Dante M. Caputo.
   Under a system of rotating regional representation the African
nations will nominate the candidate for president this year. They
have proposed Nigeria's U.N. ambassador, Maj. Gen. Joseph Garba.
   The first main session of the General Assembly ends in
mid-December, but the body will then hold a five-day special session
on the apartheid system of racial segregation in South Africa.
   The assembly session is expected to formally close in September
1990.

<TEXT>
   Nearly 4,000 Hispanics were sworn in as U.S.
citizens Saturday in an emotional ceremony timed to coincide with
local celebrations of Mexico's Independence Day.
   ``It was very emotional. It just gets you back in touch with our
liberties and what it means to be a U.S. citizen,'' said Lupe Ramos,
an organizer of the citizenship ceremony.
   Organizers billed the Weingart Stadium event as one of the
largest of its kind for a particular ethnic group.
   U.S. District Judge Manuel Real administered the oath of
citizenship and tiny flags were distributed to each of the 3,950 new
citizens, representing 19 Latin American nations.
   Mexican nationals, at 2,546, accounted for the majority of those
sworn in Saturday. Others included 333 Salvadorans, 229 Cubans and
182 Guatemalans, Ms. Ramos said.
   ``You can imagine how beautiful it is when you have 4,000 people
waving the flag and screaming because this is what they've been
waiting for,'' she said.
   After the ceremony, many registered to vote at booths set up by
local political activists.
   Among the new citizens were a family of eight from Mexico who
originally worked in the United States as field hands, and Raul
Lavista and his son, Raul Jr., both of whom served in the U.S. Navy,
Ms. Ramos said.
   The ceremony coincided with the 179th anniversary of the start of
Mexico's independence struggle, celebrated with the 48th annual
Mexican Independence Day parade in East Los Angeles.
   Father Miguel Hidalgo's call to arms sparked the first Mexican
uprising against Spanish rulers in 1810. The rebel priest was
captured and killed the following year, but his action eventually
led to independence from Spain in 1821.

<TEXT>
   A former Sears, Roebuck and Co. store clerk has
settled his dispute with the retail giant over profits from a
popular socket wrench he invented more than 25 years ago.
   Peter Roberts of Tennessee was 18 years old in 1964 when he
invented a ``quick release'' wrench that eventually sold by the
millions.
   On Friday, the 44-year-old Roberts settled an $8.2 million patent
infringement case that alleged Sears had cheated him out of his
rightful royalties from the device.
   Sears spokeswoman Kathy Gucfa declined to give any details of the
agreement, saying part of the settlement is that neither side will
comment on it.
   Roberts was believed on his way home to the Chattanooga suburb of
Red Bank and couldn't be reached for comment. His attorney John
Davidson declined to comment.
   Roberts was a clerk at a Sears store in Gardner, Mass., when he
invented the wrench in his spare time. The wrench has a push button
that permits removal of sockets from the tool with one hand.
   Roberts obtained a patent for the wrench design in 1965, and
Sears paid him $10,000 for rights to the patent.
   He then joined the Air Force. While stationed in England, he saw
a Sears catalog and was astounded at the display the wrench got
because, he said, the company had led him to believe the tool had
only minor sales potential.
   But from 1965 to 1975, Sears sold more than 19 million of the
wrenches for a net profit of more than $44 million, according to
documents in the case.
   ``I was real young, and when you're young, you may tend to trust
people too much,'' Roberts once said of his decision to take Sears'
offer.
   Roberts sued in 1969 seeking to rescind the agreement under which
he assigned the patent to the company. A federal jury in 1978
awarded him $1 million after finding that Sears fraudulently
obtained the patent.
   Roberts also asked for damages for the estimated 14 million
socket wrenches sold after 1977. He had estimated Sears earned $172
million from sales of the wrench between 1977 and 1982, but
attorneys for the retailer said the profit was closer to $5 million.
   In April 1982, a federal jury found that Sears violated the
patent and awarded Roberts $5 million, an award later increased to
$8.2 million by the judge on the grounds the infringement was
willful.
   That decision was overturned in 1983 by an appeals court, which
ordered a new trial.
   Roberts said after the appellate court decision that he kept
pursuing the case more for the principle than the money.
   ``I'm right, they're wrong,'' he said. ``I've wrapped up a
majority of my life around the thing. I'm just trying to get what is
justly and rightly mine.''
   The new trial was in its fifth day Friday when the settlement was
reached.

   The Utah Board of Pardons relied on
statements made out of context, false information and ``jailhouse
gossip'' in denying clemency to death row inmate William Andrews,
his attorneys contend.
   Andrews, who at nearly 15 years has been on death row longer than
anyone in the nation, has asked the board to vacate its decision and
grant him an unprecedent second commutation hearing.
   Andrews, 35, of Jonesboro, La., was convicted for his part in the
torture-killings of three people during a 1974 robbery. Five people
were forced to drink a caustic liquid drain cleaner and all were
shot, but two men survived. Pierre Dale Selby, who admitted firing
the shots, was executed in 1987.
   The defense petition filed Friday claims the board didn't divulge
some information it used in making its decision, including a prison
psychological report that ``apparently branded Andrews as a
sociopath.''
   The petition also contends that in testimony during Andrews'
commutation hearing, a prison official alluded to information
obtained from prison informants tying Andrews to an escape plot _
information the prison branded ``jailhouse gossip.''
   The board's decision was also influenced by statements Andrews
made in a taped interview with a prison social worker without a
lawyer present, in violation of Andrews' constitutional rights, the
attorneys said.

   Five animal rights activists were arrested
Saturday after as many as 60 protesters chased bow hunters through
the woods of a state park at the beginning of deer-hunting season.
   A sixth activist also was cited for violating Maryland's hunter
harassment law but was not taken into custody, Maryland Natural
Resources police said.
   The activists gathered before dawn near the McKee Veshers
Wildlife Management Area about 50 miles southwest of Baltimore and
traveled to the state-owned land when hunters began arriving about 5
a.m., said organizer Wayne Pacelle of The Fund for Animals.
   The demonstrators then broke into groups of five, and each group
followed a hunter from the time he stepped from his vehicle, Pacelle
said.
   ``We didn't raise our voices but we did let them know in measured
tones we were there to protect the deer and to prevent them from
cruelly killing these animals,'' said Pacelle. ``The hunters dashed
through the cornfields to escape but generally we stayed with them.''
   The activists originally had planned to spread human hair around
the tree stands used by bow hunters when they lie in wait for their
prey, but the rainy weather prompted them instead to ``focus on
establishing a presence around the hunter that would deter the deer
from approaching,'' Pacelle said.
   Natural Resources Police Sgt. William Schuller said police and
other officials were prepared for the protesters, estimated by
Pacelle at 60 and police at 40.
   No violence was reported.
   ``One hunter was pointing an arrow at a group of activists
repeatedly ... and there were lots of threats of violence but
nothing seems to have been done,'' Pacelle said.
   Pacelle said the group plans to challenge the state's hunter
harassment law on the grounds that it violates the First Amendment
right to freedom of expression. A similiar Connecticut law was
declared unconstitutional in a federal court in February 1988, and
that ruling was upheld by a federal appeals court in December 1988,
Pacelle said.
   First offenders of Maryland's hunter harassment law face fines up
to $500.

   Voters in a southeastern district
elected an opposition legislator to Parliament Saturday, handing the
Communists their fourth straight defeat in special elections,
according to preliminary results.
   The by-elections have demonstrated strong anti-Communist
sentiment ahead of general elections scheduled to be held by June.
   Also Saturday, reform Communists preparing for a showdown with
hard-line party members established an organization calling for
peaceful change. They elected the most liberal member of the
country's four-man leadership, Imre Pozsgay, to head the Movement
for a Democratic Hungary.
   Citing preliminary results from Saturday's polling, state
television reported that 59 percent of the voters chose opposition
candidate Gyula Marx in Zala county on the Yugoslav border.
   Marx was supported by the Hungarian Democratic Forum, the League
of Young Democrats and the League of Free Democrats.
   He defeated Communist candidate Istvan Gyoerffy and Istvan
Schein, an opposition Social Democrat.
   The newscast reported a turnout of 61 percent of eligible voters,
but it gave no other details.
   Three other opposition legislators won by-elections in July and
August, shutting out Communist candidates in the first multi-party
voting since the Communists consolidated power in Hungary in 1947.
   The Communist leadership decided in February to endorse
multi-party elections, arousing suspicions among some of its East
bloc allies. The general elections to fill more than 300 Parliament
seats are to be held by June.
   Pozsgay, speaking after he was elected to head the Movement for a
Democratic Hungary, said the organization was open to people of most
political persuasions, but not Marxists resisting the change to a
multi-party democracy.
   Reformers are preparing for a fight with party hard-liners at a
Communist congress set for Oct. 6.

<TEXT>
   Premier Mouloud Hamrouche on Saturday
appointed mainly Western-oriented technocrats and people viewed as
reformers to a new Cabinet.
   Hamrouche, named to the job a week ago by President Chadli
Bendjedid, picked Sid Ahmed Ghozali, former head of the state oil
and gas monopoly Sonatrach, as foreign minister.
   Bendjedid's announcement on Sept. 9 that Premier Kasdi Merbah had
been fired for opposing a reform program briefly led to a
constitutional crisis, as Merbah tried to retain his post. But he
gave way later the same day.
   The nomination of Ghozali as foreign minister was the most
significant of Hamrouche's new appontments. Ghozali, 52, is a main
partisan of Bendjedid's reform program, which includes introducing a
multiparty political system and increasing the role of private
enterprise in the state-directed economy.
   He headed Sonatrach for 12 years, building it into a massive
state enterprise.
   Later, Ghozali became minister of hydraulics in what was widely
regarded as a demotion. He then was named Algerian ambassador to
Brussels. He returned to the government as finance minister in 1988.
   Ghozali is considered a Western-oriented technocrat advocating
economic and financial reform.
   His appointment was a signal that Bendjedid is determined to push
ahead despite obstacles from the Old Guard of the ruling party. The
National Liberation Front has held power since Algeria won
independence from France in 1962.
   Other ministers considered enlightened technocrats were Ghazi
Hidouchi, economics minister; Hacene Kahlouche, minister of heavy
industry; Smail Goumeziane, minister of commerce; Hamid Sidi Said,
minister of posts and telecommunications. They have long worked
closely with Hamrouche, formerly the government's secretary-general.
   In the new Cabinet, the Ministries of Information, Culture,
Tourism and Veterans Affairs were abolished, in another move seen as
signaling transformation of an autocratically ruled state into
something closer to a Western-style democracy.
   The Ministry of Information, headed by a succession of party
stalwarts, was widely criticized for maintaining rigid controls over
the Algerian press and radio introduced by the late president Houari
Boumedienne.
   After October's riots in Algiers and other cities, Bendjedid
promised to free the press, radio and television from state control.
He also announced his program of political pluralism.
   Hamrouche's Cabinet keeps just three ministers from the previous
government in their same jobs.

   A crowded second-floor balcony of an old

and injuring 17, a police official said Saturday.
   He said three children, six women and a man were killed but he
did not know how many of the victims were on the balcony and how
many were in the street below.
   The accident occurred Thursday in the working-class district of
Karmouz as a wedding group was passing through the streets of this
Mediterranean port city.
   Balconies overlooking the street were crammed with onlookers,
many of whom danced and clapped as the newlyweds led the procession,
according to police.
   The stone balcony of a four-story house suddenly crashed to the
street below, apparently because it was overloaded, the official
said.
   He reported the bride and bridegroom were not injured.

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Poland's Roman Catholic primate, Jozef
Glemp, has called for mutual understanding to resolve conflict over
a convent next to the Auschwitz concentration camp.
   In an interview published in the Catholic weekly Tygodnik
Powszechny, Glemp said it might be possible to renegotiate
agreements to relocate the convent farther from the former Nazi
death camp.
   The Carmelite convent is at the center of a controversy between
some Catholics and Jews over an agreement reached in 1987 under
which Catholic negotiators agreed to move the convent to a nearby
interfaith prayer center by Feb. 22.
   Glemp continues to back the convent, which was established in
1984 in a building the Nazis used to store gas to kill Jews and
other death-canp inmates. He has said the agreement, signed in
Geneva, was not negotiated by ``competent people''
   In the interview published Friday Glemp said Jews should help
Catholics become better acquainted with Jewish views on the issue.
   ``Let mutual understanding be the common intention,'' he said.
   On Friday, Glemp met with the head of a fund that restores Jewish
monuments in Poland to discuss a possible resolution to the
international controversy, the state news agency, PAP, reported. No
details were provided but PAP said ``a draft of a satisfying
solution of the Auschwitz conflict was shaped.''
   Zygmunt Nissenbaum, with whom Glemp met, maintains a family
philanthropic fund. The proposals worked out by the two ``will be
carried further by an appropriate group that will handle concrete
realization'' of building the interfaith center, PAP said.
   In the interview, Glemp spoke of his earlier remarks that were
considered anti-Semitic by some Jewish leaders.
   ``Some of the press reactions (to the sermon) made me realize
that several of my opinions were interpreted contrary to my
intentions,'' he said. ``I thought the whole of my enunciation on
the need for friendly dialogue between Catholics and Jews is
sufficently clear.''
   Some Jewish groups and others consider the convent to be an
intrusion of Christian symbols at the former concentration camp
where 2.5 million of the estimated 4 million people killed were Jews.
   At one point during the interview the interviewer said it is
``better to move it (the convent) 1@3 of a mile away in tune with
the Geneva settlements. It is no tragedy and the Lord will hear
their prayer from a new place as well.'' Glemp replied, ``Of
course.''

<TEXT>
   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) _ The government announced it will
put soldiers on street patrol to help fight the drug-related
violence that has plagued this Caribbean nation for months.
   Justice and National Security Minister Selwyn Richardson said
late Friday that the move was to ``assist the police to curb the
spate of lawlessness with which the society is being afflicted.''
   He said the decision came in reaction to a Sept. 7 assassination
attempt against the wife of Trinidad President Noor Hassanaly and
the killing a month ago of Jeffrey Stollmeyer, a prominent
businessman.
   The president's wife, Zaylahar Hassanaly, was not injured when
gunmen peppered her limousine with automatic gunfire. The motive for
the attack was unknown.
   For several months Trinidad and Tobago, a country of 1.1 million
off the South American coast, has been suffered a wave of murders,
violent robberies and rapes.
   ``The present criminality definitely relates to the rise in the
availability of drugs,'' Richardson said in his remarks.
   He said the government of Prime Minister A.N.R. Robinson has
decided on an ``anti-crime action plan to take effect immediately.''
   He said the plan includes 24-hour police and army street patrols,
an increase in coast guard patrols to intercept drug runners, and
the recruitment of 150 more police officers.
   During the past 12 months, the government has passed laws aimed
at confiscating property and money gained through drug trafficking
and limiting bail for people convicted of violent crimes.

   Suspected Basque separatists started a gun
fight with security forces who stopped them Saturday at a toll booth
near this northern town, authorities reported. They said two people
were killed and three were wounded.
   A Civil Guard spokesman said the gun battle occurred on Highway
A-8 when Civil Guards told the occupants of a truck with Madrid
license plates to identify themselves.
   Two men in the truck, believed to be members of the Basque
separatist group known as ETA, began shooting and were killed by
return fire, according to the spokesman.
   He said three Civil Guards were wounded.
   ETA seeks independence from Spain for the three-province northern
Basque region. Irun is in the Basque area.
   Since beginning its violent campaign for independence 21 years
ago, ETA has asserted responsility for attacks that have killed more
than 600 people. Most of the victims have been police, military and
Civil Guard officers.
   Saturday's shooting occurred four days after suspected Basque
separatists in Madrid assassinated Carmen Tagle, a prosecutor of the
national court that handles terrorism cases.
   The same day a mail bomb believed planted by Basque separatists
exploded and killed a fish stand owner at his home in the northern
Basque city of Bilbao.

<HEAD>Report: Iowa Firing Experimental Ammmunition at Time of Explosion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The USS Iowa was being used as a floating
laboratory for high-explosive experiments, and crewmen were using
improper gun powder when the No. 2 turret exploded and killed 47
men, a news service reported.
   Transcripts from the Navy investigation into the April 19
battleship explosion showed also that the commander, Capt. Fred B.
Moosally, had not authorized the firing with experimental loads when
the explosion occurred, Media General News Services reported Sunday.
   The investigation also showed that the Navy command that
requested the experiments was the same command that performed the
tests that led the Navy to conclude that the explosion was likely an
act of sabotage by a sailor.
   The Pentagon released a report in early September that said
circumstantial evidence indicated gunner's mate Clayton Hartwig of
Cleveland intentionally sparked the explosion. However, the report
said it would be impossible to prove because all those nearby died
in the explosion, including Hartwig.
   The Navy, when contacted by The Associated Press on Saturday,
stood by its conclusion. ``Everything was very carefully
considered,'' said Cmdr. Mark Baker, a Navy spokesman at the
Pentagon.
   According to the 7,007-page report, which was available to the
public, the Navy found that gunners were firing an experimental load
from the Iowa's No. 2 turret with powder not approved for the weight
of the projectile.
   The powder was clearly marked that it not be used with the
heavyweight projectiles being fired, the report said.
   The experiments were at the request of researchers at the Naval
Sea Systems Command at the Naval Surface Warfare Center at Dahlgren,
Va.
   According to the transcripts, the tests were designed to improve
the accuracy and range of the ship's antiquated 16-inch guns.
   Commander Eugene J. Kocmich, who was the Iowa's weapons officer
between 1986 and 1988, told Navy investigators that the experiments
alarmed a number of officers on the ship, who didn't think a fully
manned battleship was meant to be a research and development vessel.
They argued that tests should be conducted under safer conditions.
   To fulfill the experiments, Iowa gunners tried reducing the
powder load by using five bags instead of the normal six. Master
Chief S.P. Skelly, who was in charge of the experiments, had
discovered that using just five bags improved the accuracy of the
guns.
   ``I knew they didn't have any authorization,'' said Lt. Cmdr.
Kenneth M. Costigan, the Iowa's gunnery officer. ``I think there
were big signs down in the magazines, `You cannot use D-846 with
heavyweight projectiles.' It was pretty clear what the rules were.''
But Costigan said he never did anything about it.
   Moosally said that on the day of the explosion, he did not know a
five-bag charge was going to be used in Turret 2 or that Turret 3 _
which never fired because of the explosion _ was loaded with an even
more innovative four-bag charge.
   Moosally told investigators he approved the use of a ``reduced
charge,'' but said he thought that meant six 55-pound bags of powder.
   The combination of experimentation on the Iowa, and the high
turnover, inexperience and poor management on board, initially
attracted the attention of investigators looking into the explosion.
   The investigators had been pursuing the theory that Hartwig, who
took over as gun captain in a last-minute roster change, perhaps was
confused by seeing only five bags of powder pop out from the powder
cars instead of six, and that somehow in the confusion the powder
got rammed into the barrel too quickly, splitting a bag open when it
crashed into the projectile, its volatile powder set off by friction.
   The friction theory was eliminated by a series of technical tests
under the direction of the Naval Sea Systems Command.
   The discovery of a $100,000 life insurance policy taken out by
Hartwig, naming a shipmate as beneficiary, put the investigation on
a new course.
   Media General, a communications company based in Richmond,
publishes the Richmond Times-Dispatch, the Richmond News Leader, the
Tampa (Fla.) Tribune and the Winston-Salem (N.C.) Journal, and

   Planned talks between officials of South
Africa and Angola were postponed because a plane carrying Angola's
representative was grounded with technical problems, a Portuguese
report said Saturday.
   The report from the Lusa news agency said South African Foreign
Minister Roelof Botha and Angolan Foreign Minister Pedro de Castro
van Dunem had to delay discussions planned for Friday on the Angolan
civil war.
   Lusa said van Dunem was due to meet Botha in the border town of
Ruacana, but his plane was held up at Cahama, 125 miles from the
border.
   Angolan government sources said they hoped to set a new meeting
for Sunday at a site to be arranged, Lusa reported.
   President Jose Eduardo dos Santos of Angola recently accused
South Africa of breaking a pledge to halt aid to rebels fighting to
share power with his Marxist-oriented government.
   Clashes between the rebel force _ the National Union for the
Total Independence of Angloa (UNITA) _ and government troops have
been reported since the breakdown of a June truce.

   Funerals were held Saturday for victims of
Thursday's massacre at a printing plant, with a chorus singing,
``Nearer My God To Thee,'' for a slain choir member.
   The Thoroughbred Chorus performed at the funeral for James Wible,
a long-time chorus member who was among the shooting victims at
Standard Gravure Corp. where he worked for 37 years.
   Wible's funeral was the first held for the seven victims of
Joseph T. Wesbecker, a deranged co-worker who entered the building
spraying bullets from an arsenal he had been collecting during the
past few months.
   Eleven of the 13 people injured by Wesbecker during the rampage
remained hospitalized Saturday, two of them in critical condition.
   Wesbecker, who turned a pistol on himself to end the shooting
spree, did not have a formal funeral. Bill Longest, an official at
Owen Funeral Home in Louisville said Saturday that the body was
embalmed and taken away. Longest said Wesbecker's family asked that
no other information be divulged.
   Reporters were barred from Saturday's services.
   Dan Burgess, a chorus member who attended Wible's funeral, said
the Rev. Gene Templar made only a few references to the violence
that caused Wible's death. Burgess said Templar's eulogy stressed
that ``God's will is about love and not about violence.''
   Chorus members also sang ``The Lord's Prayer'' and ``I Thank the
Lord.''
   Wible was to be buried in Illinois.
   Funeral services were also held Saturday for Richard O. Barger,
54, a pressman for 32 years; and a service was scheduled for
Saturday evening for Sharon L.L. Needy, 49, a receptionist at the
downtown plant, which prints newspaper inserts.
   Funerals for the other four victims were scheduled for Monday.
   Among those attending Wible's funeral was Michael Shea, the owner
of Standard Gravure. Shea, who appeared very upset, did not say
anything after the ceremony, but consoled Wible's family members and
friends.
   Meanwhile, Wesbecker's son James Thomas Wesbecker blamed Standard
Gravure for the mental problems that his father suffered.
   ``Maybe this was just his way of ending it,'' the younger
Wesbecker said in an interview Friday with the Lexington
Herald-Leader. ``I don't want to say much about the company, about
the people at the top. Maybe they didn't know what was really going
on. I'm not sure.
   ``But I feel like, over the years, the company created my dad,''
he continued. James Wesbecker, 22, is one of Wesbecker's two grown
sons by his first marriage.
   Wesbecker was on long-term disability from the company because of
his mental problems. Relatives have told police he was a manic
depressive who had attempted suicide three times.
   James Wesbecker said his father feared the company was planning
to take away some of his benefits. ``He was really afraid of that,''
the younger Wesbecker said.
   Shea said Friday that he knew of no meeting company officials had
planned with Wesbecker and refused to comment on what he called
``the speculaton, rumors and innuendo'' about Wesbecker's
relationship with the company, where he went to work in 1971.
   Meanwhile, the shooting began a debate in Kentucky over
regulations on assault weapons of the type Wesbecker used. When he
entered the printing plant, Wesbecker was armed with a Chinese-made
AK-47 semiautomatic rifle, two MAC-11 semiautomatic weapons, a
revolver and a 9mm semiautomatic pistol.
   Two Louisville legislators said they will introduce a bill in the
1990 General Assembly to ban the sale of AK-47 rifles and similar
assault weapons. Kentucky lawmakers are in general so strongly
against gun controls that there is a state law that bars cities and
towns from passing gun control ordinances.
   State Rep. Mike Ward acknowledged that passage of a gun-control
law would be difficult. ``But I think we owe it to the families of
the victims, and the surviving victims, to try to make it at least
harder to obtain assault weapons,'' Ward said.

   Communist leader Dolores Ibarruri, known as
``La Pasionaria'' for her fiery speeches during the Spanish Civil
War, was in serious condition Saturday with pneumonia, her doctors
said.
   The 93-year-old party stalwart was taken to Madrid's Ramon y
Cajal hospital early Thursday with breathing problems.
   In a statement Saturday her doctors said her condition had not
improved despite treatment with antibiotics.
   However, a report in the newspaper El Pais said Mrs. Ibarruri
managed to sit up in a chair Friday and chat with relatives.
   Mrs. Ibarruri was one of the Spanish Communist Party's founders
in 1920. She is now its honorary president.
   She became famous as a Parliament member during the 1936-39 civil
war for her radio broadcasts exhorting Republican forces to defeat
Gen. Francisco Franco's troops.
   During the 1937 siege of Madrid, her defiant phrase _ ``They
shall not pass!'' _ became the battle cry of loyalist Republican
forces.
   After Franco's victory she went into exile in the Soviet Union.
   She returned to live in the Spanish capital in 1977 as Spain
carried out a peaceful transition to democracy following Franco's
death two years earlier.
   That same year the white-haired grandmother won back her deputy's
seat in the lower house of Parliament. She later gave it up because
of her age and health.

   ``I think we can work out of this,'' Mrs. Hills told a news
conference after meeting with top officials of the European Economic
Community, the 12-nation trading bloc known as the Common Market.
   Neither side, however, reported solving any of their trade
disputes, such as a European ban on imports of hormone-treated beef
or American steel-import quotas. The European Community last year
was the United States' largest trading partner.
   During her trip Mrs. Hills expressed concern that some of the
Common Market's policies might hurt American companies.
   But Frans Andriessen, the chief trade official for the European
Commission, the bloc's executive body, said the community intends to
remain open once it forms a single market in late 1992.
   There has been concern in the United States about proposals that
appear to place protectionist barriers around the European-wide
market in 1992, when trade barriers restricting the free movement of
money, goods, services and people will be removed.
   But after talks in five other European cities, Mrs. Hills said,
``I am of a more positive frame of mind today than I was (last)
Saturday when I arrived in Paris.''
   Mrs. Hills was scheduled to return to London Saturday before
going on to Rome on Sunday and returning to the United States on
Monday.

<HEAD>Woman Found After Abduction Killed in Plane Crash</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MAYFIELD, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman who police said was abducted and
drugged then found five days later wandering a Florida beach was
among six people killed when the plane carrying them to her ``quiet
homecoming'' crashed and burned.
   Belinda Yancey, 33, and five other people, including her husband,
died Friday night when the airplane's wing struck a tree and went
down near the Mayfield-Graves County airport in southwestern
Kentucky, authorities said.
   ``As far as people going through one tragedy and then all getting
killed, I've never seen anything like that before,'' said Kentucky
State Police Lt. Tom Finck, who was at the crash site Saturday.
   Ms. Yancey, who taught hearing impaired students at Mayfield High
School, disappeared sometime after 2:30 p.m. Monday, when she told
her son that she was going to Murray State University's bookstore,
said police Capt. Bob Crawford. Her car has not been found.
   She wandered up to a lifeguard on a beach at Daytona Beach, Fla.,
on Thursday afternoon and said she was lost, police said.
   Based on statements she made to Florida authorities, Ms. Yancey
seemed to have been drugged with Valium by her abductor, who
remained at large, Crawford said.
   Ms. Yancey told authorities that ``they kept giving me little
blue pills,'' Crawford said.
   In interviews with authorities and relatives, she could not
recall how she got to Florida and was unable to identify who drove
her there, Crawford said.
   Ms. Yancey's hair had been cut and dyed and she had bruises on
her arms, indicating she was tied up or restrained, he said.
   After the disappearance, she was disoriented and didn't know her
name, said Sgt. Carroll Rountree of the Volusia County, Fla.,
Rangers. Mrs. Yancey finally remembered her name and hometown after
talking to Rountree for about two hours, he said.
   The Rev. Alfred Cobb, a family friend, said only Mrs. Yancey's
closest family members knew about her scheduled return from Florida
on Friday night.
   ``They tried not to tell too many people, because they didn't
want a big crowd at the airport,'' Cobb said. ``They thought, in
fact I think they were told, that it would be better for Belinda's
health if there wasn't a lot of people there because of the
situation she was in.
   ``No one else was aware of (the group) being on their way home.
They were looking for a quiet homecoming.''
   Finck said the twin-engine Beechcraft BE-10 was flying through
thick fog as it approached the airport. The pilot made two attempts
to land before the crash, but apparently lost sight of the runway
both times, Finck said.

<TEXT>
   Two bombs, one thrown from a motorcycle
and a second from a car, exploded in downtown Bogota Saturday as the
government tightened security to quell the wave of violence.
   Two pedestrians were injured when the devices exploded at about 5
p.m. in front of two banks, which were closed, a police spokeswoman
said.
   The banks, Banco de Santander and Banco Popular, are in the
Paloquemao area of central Bogota.
   No one claimed responsibility for the bombings but it is believed
they were connected to the drug-related violence that began four
weeks ago when the government announced its crackdown on drug
traffickers.
   Meanwhile, hundreds of soldiers patrolled city streets and
searched cars for weapons and explosives. Police said nine people
were killed and 15 wounded in widespread violence Friday.
   Colombia celebrated its ``Day of Love and Friendship'' _ the
equivalent of Valentine's Day. But shopping centers, usually filled
with people buying last minute gifts for the holiday, were nearly
deserted.
   Americans continued to pull out of Colombia for fear they could
be caught up in the month-long war between drug traffickers and the
Colombian government.
   About 20 American passengers boarding flights Saturday for the
United States told a reporter they feared for their lives. In the
last two weeks, outgoing flights have been filled with Americans.
   Two weeks ago, the U.S. Embassy ordered dependents of American
employees out of the country.
   A bomb was deactivated at the Colgate-Palmolive Co.'s
headquarters in the western Colombia city of Cali Thursday night,
police Col. Rozo Julio Navarro told The Associated Press.
   Three bombs exploded Friday night in Cali, injuring 13 people,
Navarro said. The bombs went off in a high-rise building and damaged
three banks and 12 stores, he said. No one claimed responsibility
but police suspected the drug cartels.
   On Saturday the army, declaring a maximum alert, put troops and
armor into the streets of Colombian cities in the greatest display
of military muscle seen in years here.
   Troops were patrolling Bogota, the cocaine cartel centers of
Medellin and Cali, and the Caribbean coastal cities of Cartagena and
Barranquilla.
   Early in the morning, hundreds of troops in trucks poured out of
the army's 13th Brigade headquarters in northern Bogota. Foot
patrols were seen throughout the capital of 6 million.
   Soldiers searched people, mostly men, in downtown Bogota, and the
army and police set up checkpoints to search vehicles for guns and
explosives.
   For the first time, Colombia's national police acknowledged
numerous telephoned threats to people in Bogota and said the
telephone company is setting up an operation to trace such calls.
   Troops also were deployed to guard banks and government buildings.
   Banks are frequent targets of the nation's powerful cocaine
traffickers, who have declared ``total and absolute war'' on the
government. That declaration and the Aug. 18 assassination of
leading presidential candidate Sen. Luis Carlos Galan prompted the
crackdown on drug lords.
   At Bogota's El Dorado International Airport, police closed off
all but two entrances and were frisking people and searching bags.
   Police Col. Nassin Yanine Diaz, commander of the Bogota division
of the national police, appealed in a communique Saturday for people
to remain calm and ``have confidence in the armed forces.''
   A similar communique was issued by the 13th Brigade.
   Two policemen were killed by gunfire from a speeding car Friday
night in Bogota, said a spokesman for national police headquarters
in the capital.
   As in most bombings and shootings throughout this country of 30
million, police said they had no idea who was behind the violence.
Drug traffickers have been widely blamed but leftist guerrillas
seeking to topple the government have waged their own campaign of
violence.
   In the central Colombia state of Boyaca, just north of the
capital, seven men were killed Friday in violence involving bandits
battling for control of Colombia's emerald mines, the national
police in Bogota said.
   Drug traffickers are believed to be heavily involved in the
20-year-old struggle for control of the emerald mines.
   Also in Bogota, a gunman firing from a car shot at the building
of the Bogota daily El Siglo Friday night, the Bogota police said.
   An El Siglo executive said one shot was fired in the air by a man
who became angry when he was stopped by guards checking vehicles
entering the El Siglo parking area.
   The man and a passenger fled in the car, the El Siglo spokesman
said, asking not to be identified. No one was reported injured.
   A bomb seriously damaged the Bogota daily El Espectador on Sept.
2. The paper's publisher, Guillermo Cano, was assassinated by drug
traffickers three years ago.
   In Medellin, a bomb exploded near a police vehicle Friday night,
injuring two policemen, police said in a telephone interview.
   Thirty-two bombs have exploded in Medellin Since Aug. 21.
   Last week the army said it had arrested 28 persons in Medellin on
suspicion of being leftist guerrillas and of setting off some of the
bombs that have exploded there.

<TEXT>
   As the Navy's new $1.2 billion destroyer
Arleigh Burke was launched Saturday, officials took turns firing
return salvos at a congressman who called the ship's construction a
``procurement nightmare.''
   ``Irresponsible attitudes like that hurt but ... don't take them
too seriously,'' Rep. Joseph E. Brennan, D-Maine, told a crowd
estimated at more than 10,000 people who attended the launching at
Bath Iron Works.
   The Burke is named for an 87-year-old retired admiral and World
War II hero who arrived at the launching in a 1930 Packard. Burke's
wife, Roberta, broke a bottle of champagne over the bow, sending the
8,500-ton destroyer sliding toward the Kennebec River.
   Construction of the ship, considered the most technologically
advanced surface combat vessel, has prompted complaints of cost
overruns by Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich.
   Dingell, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee
on oversight and investigations, told the Navy that the program is
18 months behind schedule and that the DDG-51 destroyer is only 38
percent complete.
   ``The acquisition of the DDG-51 has turned into a procurement
nightmare,'' his letter said.
   Bath Iron Works rejected Dingell's assertions, which were based
on a draft report from the General Accounting Office, which is
conducting an inquiry into the program.
   Dingell's ``numbers are wrong, his facts are wrong and his
so-called news in nearly two years old,'' said Brennan. ``That
number of errors in not good even for congressional work.''
   William E. Haggett, chairman and chief executive officer of Bath
Iron Works, said Thursday that the DDG-51 is ''47 to 51 percent
complete, a higher level than we launched our previous prototype
ship.''
   ``The ship is ready in every respect to be launched,'' said
Haggett.
   Gov. John R. McKernan, who declared Saturday Arleigh Burke Day in
Maine, said, ``I don't care what Dingell says. This is a great day
for Bath Iron Works and a great day for the state of Maine and a
great for the United States of America.''
   The guided-missile destroyer is designed with a steel
superstructure instead of one that is part aluminum and more prone
to splintering and fire damage. It will be equipped with
sophisticated Aegis computers and Tomahawk cruise missiles.
   Navy Secretary H. Lawrence Garrett III said the ship ``represents
the very future of surface warfare.'' The ship is scheduled to be
delivered in February 1991.

<HEAD>State Department Official Visits Haiti One Year After Coup</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ A high-ranking U.S. State Department
official left Haiti on Saturday after a visit to assess progress in
democratization a year after Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril came to power in
a soldiers' coup.
   ``This visit reflects our deep interest in Haitian affairs,''
Bernard Aronson, under-secretary of state for Latin American and
Caribbean affairs, said before leaving.
   During his 24-hour visit, Aronson met with Avril, who came to
power on Sept. 17, 1988.
   ``We had the opportunity to talk directly, to view the progress
made, and to talk about future steps,'' said Aronson. He did not
elaborate.
   However, U.S. officials have recently praised Avril, saying he
has improved Haiti's human rights record and its efforts to combat
drug trafficking.
   Soldiers angered by what they viewed as state-sponsored violence
ousted former ruler Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy a year ago and sent him
into exile in the Dominican Republic, which shares the Caribbean
island of Hispaniola with Haiti.
   The soldiers demanded respect for human rights and a return to
democratic rule.
   Avril was expected to make a speech on state television Sunday to
commemorate his first year in power.
   The general has promised to turn over power to an elected
government and allowed the creation of an Electoral Council. That
body is expected to announce later this month a timetable for
general elections.

   One of the most powerful typhoons in decades has
killed 48 people, left 26 missing, and flooded large areas in the
coastal Chinese province of Zhejiang, the official news agency
reported Saturday.
   Typhoon Vera also injured 190 people in the area south of
Shanghai, the Xinhua News Agency said.
   Rains flooded the port city of Shujiang, the report said. Also
inundated were 163,000 acres of rice paddies and 32,000 acres of
orange orchards, Xinhua said.
   The report did not say how many people were evacuated.
   Zhejiang suffered 122 deaths and economic losses of $286 million
from torrential rains in July.
   In 1988, about 400 people in the province lost their lives in
typhoons, heavy rains and flooding.

   Explorers recovering gold that may value
more than $400 million from a sunken ship off the South Carolina
coast said Saturday they also may have found two previously unknown
species of marine life.
   Researchers using remote-control equipment gathered samples of
the two organisms, apparently invertebrate animals, attached to
remnants of the SS Central America at a depth of 8,000 feet, said
Barry Schatz, a director of the Columbus-America Discovery Group.
   The creatures will be studied on board and later taken ashore for
further study, said Schatz, who spoke with The Associated Press in a
ship-to-shore telephone conversation from the Arctic Discoverer
research vessel 200 miles offshore.
   The Central America sank during a hurricane Sept. 12, 1857, en
route from Panama to New York. It was carrying a monthly shipment of
gold from the San Francisco Mint to New York banks by way of the
Panamanian isthmus. The sinking claimed 425 lives; 153 people
survived.
   Remnants of the wood and iron ship, discovered three years ago,
lie on a section of ocean floor that Schatz said is a ``biological
oasis'' in the midst of an otherwise barren area.
   Charles Herdendorf, an oceanographer from Ohio State University
who heads an onboard research team, said scientists have been trying
to informally catalogue marine life seen around the wreck through
television cameras.
   ``But these two were just total mysteries to me,'' he said in a
ship-to-shore conversation. ``These looked really new.''
   Conversations with specialists at the Smithsonian Institution in
Washington heightened belief that the creatures were previously
unknown, Herdendorf said.
   Both appear to be invertebrate animals similar to sponge or
coral. They grow on stalks about eight to 10 inches long and may be
part of the same family, he said.
   One consists of a narrow stalk that ends in plumes or polyps. The
other has a coin-sized, fleshy growth extending off a central stalk.
   ``It may be the same organism in various life stages or it may be
two different species,'' he said.
   The group planned to spend Saturday on scientific research,
Schatz and Herdendorf said.
   In addition to collecting the two organisms, Schatz said, the
group hopes also to catch other animals with traps baited with
lobster from the group's dinner, scrape animals from the wreck hull
and take a core sample of the sea floor.
   Though the first of the gold was found in August 1988, the Arctic
Discoverer and its 21-member crew did not find the main gold deposit
until Aug. 27 this year, after about a month at sea.
   Schatz said the team may be at sea for another month, and hopes
to have the bulk of the gold up by then.
   As an offshoot of the commercial enterprise of recovering the
gold, the group established an adjunct sciences program, headed by
Herdendorf.
   More than a dozen researchers are now involved in the project,
including scientists from the Smithsonian.
   ``The economic payoff is what pays for the science,'' Schatz said.
   Herdendorf said the group hopes to produce educational films and
distribute their findings throughout the scientific community.
   ``It's really a dream. I guess the dream of all biologist is to
find new life forms and advance the horizons of science. We're
probably just beginning,'' Herdendorf said.

<HEAD>Polish Party Daily Says Soviets Repressed Millions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Communist Party newspaper Saturday said
the Soviet invasion of Poland in 1939 led to repression and crimes
against millions of Poles.
   The paper, Trybuna Ludu, said the truth about the invasion must
be told before Polish-Soviet relations can be put on a new basis.
   ``The date of Sept. 17 is deeply rooted in the consciousness of
the Polish nation. Especially because the entering of Soviet troops
was followed by growing repressions, and even mass crimes, which
involved millions of Poles,'' the paper said.
   On Sunday, Poland marks the 50th anniversary of the Soviet
invasion, which came more than two weeks after the Nazi army entered
Poland at the outbreak of World War II.
   Germany and the Soviet Union had agreed to divide Poland into
spheres of influence under secret protocols in the
Ribbentrop-Molotov non-aggression pact on Aug. 23 of that year.
   Soviet troops are thought to have killed tens of thousands of
Poles during the war. Another 1.5 million were deported to Siberia
during the Soviet occupation.
   ``The crossing by the Red Army into the eastern borders of Poland
... belonged for decades in our country to the most taboo
subjects,'' the paper said. ``If Sept. 1 was the beginning of a
cataclysm for Poland and later for the world, then Sept. 17 that
year symbolizes a secondary blow that fell on our nation and the
consequences of which were also enormous and tragic.''
   Although Nazi aggression has been well publicized, the Soviet
invasion was rarely mentioned in the official press for decades. It
was, however, well documented in the unofficial or underground press.
   ``The truth about those events is deserved not only by the
victims of the repressions, their descendents, the whole nation, but
it is one of the important tasks in freeing Polish-Soviet
relations,'' Trybuna Ludu said.
   Ceremonies were planned Sunday at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier
in Warsaw, and there will be other smaller commemorations nationwide.
   Two years ago, a joint Polish-Soviet commission was set up to
investigate ``blank spots'' in history such as the massacre of
Polish officers at Katyn, the Soviet invasion of Poland, and the
1920 Polish-Soviet war.
   Last Aug. 23, deputies in the lower house of parliament passed a
resolution condemning the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact as ``shameful.''
Earlier, the Communist Party had condemned the secret protocols as
``a flagrant violation'' of international law.

   An earthquake measuring 5.2 on the Richter
scale shook southern and central Mexico on Saturday, but there were
no reports of damage or injuries.
   The National Seismological Service said the quake, which occurred
in the early evening, was centered 250 miles southeast of Mexico
City on the coast of Oaxaca state. The earthquake could be felt in
the Mexico City.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of energy released by an earthquake
as measured by the ground motion recorded on a seismograph. Every
increase of one whole number means a tenfold increase in magnitude.
   An earthquake of 5 is defined as one that can cause considerable
damage.
   At least 10,000 people died and large areas of Mexico City were
leveled on Sept. 19, 1985, when an earthquake measuring 8.1 on the
Richter scale struck and a second temblor measuring 7.6 hit the next
day.

<TEXT>
   Congressman Barney Frank says he would consider not
running again if a House ethics probe of his relations with a male
prostitute damages the causes he considers important in Congress.
   ``Do other people who share my values pay a price if I am here?''
said the Massachusetts Democrat. ``If that's so, then I would not
run for office.''
   Frank conceded in an interview with The Boston Globe _ conducted
in Washington and published Saturday _ that disclosures about his
relationship with Stephen L. Gobie have already diminished his
influence on some of the liberal causes he has supported.
   A Newsweek poll released Saturday showed 46 percent of Americans
said Frank shouldn't be re-elected because of the scandal.
Forty-five percent said they would vote against any homosexual
candidate for office, according to the poll of 600 adults
interviewed Sept. 14 and 15.
   The same poll found 60 percent of Americans believe that being a
homosexual shouldn't keep a person from being a member of Congress
and 50 percent said homosexuality shouldn't keep a person from being
president. The poll has a 4 percent margin of error.
   Frank's disclosure of his homosexuality in 1987 didn't prevent
him for gaining 70 percent of the votes in his 1988 re-election bid.
He represents a predominantly Democratic district that encompasses
parts of southeastern Massachusetts and some Boston suburbs.
   The Boston Globe, in an editorial in Sunday's editions, urged
Frank to resign for ``his own good, and for the good of his
constituents, his causes and Congress.''
   The Globe noted that it had ``enthusiastically endorsed Frank
throughout his public career,'' but said revelations about Frank and
his relationship with Gobie had led it to conclude ``Barney Frank
must go.''
   ``The issue of Frank's conduct is not homosexuality but
prostitution, which is illegal and which has always been a
destructive element in heterosexual and homosexual life,'' the
newspaper said. ``Had the issue been heterosexual prostitution,
feminist groups would not have been silent. So far, Frank has
enjoyed more than the benefit of the doubt, he has enjoyed a double
standard.''
   In the interview, Frank said that if he retired, he would
practice law and do some writing, but would continue to be involved
in such issues as housing, AIDS and homosexual rights.
   Frank said he believes most people will agree with his contention
that his activities with Gobie involved only his personal life and
did not spill over into his work as a member of Congress.
   ``My impact on people who don't know me has been diminished
some,'' Frank said. ``As public spokesman, there will be a period
that I will have to reestablish.''
   Frank said he has decided to step back from the issue of the
scandal in the Department of Housing and Urban Development, on which
he has worked recently.
   ``On that one, I think it is appropriate that I pull back until I
get my own ethics matter resolved,'' he said.
   The House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct has begun a
preliminary inquiry that is expected to take up to three months.
   The study centers on Frank's hiring of Gobie, whom he once
patronized for paid sex, as his aide and chauffeur, allowing Gobie
access to his apartment; Frank's writing of several letters on
official stationery to Gobie's Virginia probation officer; and
Gobie's contention that Frank fixed up to 100 parking tickets for
him.

   Two men trying to clean a well were

man who tried to rescue them, authorities said.
   The two were clearing land to make room for a trailer in rural
Meigs County, about 50 miles northeast of Chattanooga, said Jim
Mullins, a dispatcher with the county sheriff's department.
   Gary Harden, 26, and Jerry Buckner, 31, had climbed into the
49-foot, hand-dug well when they were overcome by methane gas fumes.
At least one of the men had entered the well to clean it, said
Robert Cartwright, another dispatcher.
   An emergency medical technician, David McCullum, 27, was overcome
by the gas as he tried to rescue the two, Mullins said.

oil was discovered spilled in the river, authorities said.
   The river was closed from the Port of Albany to below Catskill
after a petroleum product believed to be a heavy fuel oil spilled
into the river late Friday night, according to officials from the
state Department of Environmental Conservation.
   The actual spill _ which originated in the Port of Albany _ was
about 20 miles long and extended from Albany to Coxsackie, said
Coast Guard officials from Governors Island in New York City.
   The spill was reported early Saturday, said R.W. Groneman, a
department spokesman. He said it wasn't known who made the call.
   ``The type and amount of the oil as well as the source are
unknown,'' said Petty Officer Jeff Crawley.
   Groneman said the spill was toward the western shore of the
river. He said there was concern over wildlife and waterfowl in the
area.
   ``The parties responsible for this hit and run environmental
disaster will face stiff penalties,'' said Commissioner Thomas
Jorling of the environmental conservation department. ``They will
also get a bill from New York state for the cost of the cleanup.''

   More rain fell Saturday, a day after a
cloudburst caused flooding in which two children drowned in spite of
a human-chain rescue and forced the evacuation of at least 400
people.
   Elsewhere in the East, floods in West Virginia killed two people.
   Almost 4 inches of rain fell in Fayetteville in two hours late
Friday. More rain fell overnight, and scattered showers were
reported Saturday night.
   ``We've got more people coming in to prepare sandbags and
environmental services folks are coming in to unclog the drains, and
buses are coming in for possible evacuation procedures,'' city
spokesman Jason Brady said.
   Police Lt. C.P. Ware said water was still draining in some areas
of the eastern North Carolina city of 60,000. But he said
``everything's calmed down'' compared to Friday night.
   However, three rescue teams consisting of divers and police dog
units searched Saturday to make sure no one else drowned, Brady said.
   ``Just a few minutes ago they pulled a car out of some water that
had two people in it,'' Brady said early Saturday. The two people
were not injured.
   Rescuers saved five people who clutched at branches in a
rain-swollen creek after they tried to escape their flooded van, but
two children, ages 6 and 4, who were in the vehicle were swept away
and drowned.
   ``All my life in North Carolina, I've never seen anything like
it,'' said Cumberland County Deputy James E. Miller, one of those
who formed a human chain and used ropes to save three adults and one
child Friday night. A fourth adult was washed about 100 yards
downstream before she was rescued.
   Their van was struck by water overflowing a nearby dam. The water
was flowing over the van when law enforcement officials arrived,
Miller said. Water stood more than 3 feet deep on the road and more
than 6 feet deep in the creek, Miller said.
   At least 400 people were evacuated, some in boats, and were in
temporary shelters Saturday at a gymnasium, an armory and a church,
officials said. The evacuees included more than 160 people taken
from a nursing home, said Graham Wilson, spokesman for the state
Department of Crime Control and Public Safety.
   Soldiers coming through town on their way to Fort Bragg for a
military exercise were blocked by the high water and helped with the
nursing home evacuation, said Mayor J.L. Dawkins.
   ``They played a big role in that with equipment and manpower
right there on the spot,'' Dawkins said.
   Police used city buses to evacuate residents living within a
half-mile radius of Glenville Lake, which overflowed its dam in the
Mazarick City Park area.
   The main post office in downtown Fayetteville was without power.
   ``The generators which are in the basement were completely
flooded out,'' said postal spokesman Ed Odom. ``We did get some mail
out, a very limited amount. Carriers will be running today, however
they will not have the mail that they should have.''
   To the north, creeks were swollen by more than 3 inches of rain
Saturday in parts of West Virginia, forcing some families to leave
their homes and drowning two people, authorities said.
   Weather service meteorologist Peter Park said flooding was
reported in several counties in th southern and western parts of the
state.
   Appalachian Power Co. spokesman Jack Shaver said 2,000 customers
lost power early Saturday but service to more than half of them was
restored by midday.
   The drownings were both in Kanawha County, which includes the
capital city of Charleston.
   A 30-year-old woman drowned when the truck in which she was
riding was caught by a swollen creek and lodged against a bridge
abutment, state police said.
   The driver ``jumped out and he tried to get her out. But he
couldn't get her out,'' said Sgt. G.L. Clark.
   A man who was checking to make sure no one was trapped in their
homes drowned when he was swept away by high water in the Alum Creek
area, said Kanawha County Manager Ron Gregory.

   A man who found $2,000 in rain-soaked $100
bills strewn across a road gave the cash to authorities. The couple
who reported the money missing couldn't believe their good fortune.
   ``You're kidding me,'' was Jeanette Yakel's response, said
Lincoln County Sheriff's Chief Deputy Tom Casady. She said it twice.
   The money, lost on Aug. 23, survived up to 13 inches of rain over
a four-day period. The couple from Memphis, 30 miles outside
Lincoln, didn't know how they lost the money.
   ``We had flooding all over the place,'' Sgt. Robert Marker said.
``It's one of those once-in-a-lifetime deals you hear about.''
   William H. Landon, 35, of Greenwood, found the 20 $100 bills and
turned them over to the sheriff's office on Thursday. A check found
with the money helped verify the correct owners.

   Seven coal miners were buried Saturday,
and an investigation into the explosion that killed them and three
others was delayed again because of dangerous levels of methane gas,
authorities said.
   The methane gas was in the area where the explosion is believed
to have occurred, said Kathy Snyder of the U.S. Mine Safety and
Health Administration.
   Ms. Snyder said federal and state investigators conducting a
preliminary check of the mine Thursday found ``explosive levels'' of
methane.
   The MSHA then approved Pyro's plan for correcting the levels,
but, ``So far they have been unable to clear up the methane problem.
And they're still in the process of doing that,'' Ms. Snyder said.
   ``Until that happens, the investigation will be on hold,'' she
said. ``The methane levels are too dangerous.''
   She did not know how long that would take.
   On Friday, Willard Stanley, commissioner of the state Department
of Mines and Minerals, said a blowtorch found near the site of the
explosion was most likely what ignited the blast.
   The Pyro mine has been cited for 1,508 violations and assessed
$215,757 in fines over the past seven years, according to MSHA.
About $53,000 was assessed this year.
   Funeral services began in the morning in Madisonville and
continued throughout the day in western Kentucky. One funeral was
held in Morganfield, two in Madisonville, another in Muhlenberg
County, and others in Nortonville and Salem.
   Mark S. Hedges, 31, of Morganfield, one of the 10 miners killed
Wednesday at Pyro Mining Co.'s William Station Mine in neighboring
Wheatcroft, was buried Friday. The other two victims were scheduled
for burial Sunday in Providence and Madisonville.
   In Madisonville, about 250 people packed a funeral home chapel,
two family rooms and the hallway for funeral services for Paul T.
Harris, 39, of Providence.
   The scene was repeated at the Whitsell Funeral Home in
Morganfield, where about 150 to 200 people paid tribute to Roger
Clifford, 32, of Morganfield.
   During the 15-minute service, the minister read a poem from an
Elkville, Ill., woman titled, ``Coal Miner's Wife.''
   Also buried Saturday were Lynn A. Ashmore, 31, and Kenneth E.
Reed, 32, both of Slaughters; Ernest W. Stewart, 40, of Mortons Gap;
James A. Tinsley, 36, of Marion; and Rickie Dale Furgerson, 34, of
Madisonville.

<DATELINE>ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 11,000 union supporters rallied
at the state Capitol to protest the hiring of non-union construction
workers at the Boise Cascade Corp. paper mill in International
Falls, the site of a riot last week.
   Also Saturday, a state lawmaker said he would introduce a bill to
repeal a $16 million tax exemption Boise Cascade is eligible to
receive from the state; and 200 to 300 people attended a peace rally
in International Falls to oppose violence in connection with the
labor dispute.
   The Sept. 9 riot at the International Falls plant caused more
than $1 million in damage at the $535 million expansion project and
resulted in five minor injuries and 29 arrests.
   No violence was reported in International Falls on Saturday,
police said, and the St. Paul and International Falls rallies were
peaceful.
   Several protesters carried signs praising Gov. Rudy Perpich for
supporting union labor and for not sending the National Guard to the
riot. Perpich has been criticized by Boise and the contractor for
the expansion for not deploying the Guard.
   More than 11,000 people attended the rally, according to Capt.
Richard Smith, director of Capitol security.
   Thousands of rallygoers, including many children, carried signs
protesting Boise Cascade and BE&amp;K, the contractor who hired the
non-union workers.
   A few said, ``Go home scabs,'' ``$16 million for education, not
rats,'' and ``My dad's union and I'm proud.''
   Anti-Boise Cascade buttons were being sold for $5 each, with the
proceeds to pay for legal help for the people arrested in the riot.
   In International Falls on the Canadian border, 200 to 300 people
gathered at Smokey Bear Park to show their opposition to violence in
connection with the labor dispute.
   ``We will not tolerate the violence that seeks to tear apart our
community,'' the Rev. Daniel Megorden told the crowd in Smokey Bear
Park, across from the Boise plant.
   ``None of us want to see neighbor torn against neighbor, brother
against brother,'' Megorden said.
   Most speakers at the hourlong rally in St. Paul, including
Minnesota AFL-CIO President Dan Gustafson and Minnesota Building
Trades Council President Bill Peterson, said they did not condone
the violence by pro-union activists last weekend.
   But they said the rioting occurred because Minnesota union
workers are frustrated over the hiring of non-union, out-of-state
workers at the expansion project, even as Boise became eligible to
receive the tax break.
   ``How has Boise used this tax credit?'' Peterson told the crowd.
``To hire BE&amp;K, a non-union contractor from Alabama, and to
subsidize the importation of non-union workers from 22 different
states who took jobs that rightfully belong to Minnesotans.
   State Rep. Joe Begich told rallygoers he would introduce a bill
to repeal the tax exemption during a planned special legislative
session on property tax issues this month.

<HEAD>Newspaper Says Nixon Planned Hostage Rescue</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A newspaper reported Sunday that former President
Richard M. Nixon tried to organize a mission to rescue 52 American
hostages in Iran in 1980 shortly after President Jimmy Carter's
attempt failed.
   However, the Sunday Telegraph's report said it was not clear if
Nixon intended to launch an independent mission or an official one
that would be carried out under the presidency of Ronald Reagan.
   In any event, the newspaper said the idea was dropped in October
1980 when Iran announced that the hostages at the U.S. Embassy in
Tehran would be released after the inauguration of a new president.
   The weekly newspaper said Nixon held secret talks with British
helicopter pilots and ex-servicemen only three months after the
first attempted rescue in april 1980.
   He met the chairman of Bristow Helicopters, Alan Bristow, and
several former members of the Special Air Service, according to the
newspaper. The SAS is Britain's elite military assault force.
   ``Nixon was absolutely serious,'' the newspaper quoted Bristow as
saying. ``We had a long and detailed discussion about the chances of
success of a second strike. I told him it could be done, but the
strike force would suffer at least 30 percent casualties.''
   A rescue attempt authorized by Carter ended in disaster April 25,
1980, when a helicopter collided with a tanker aircraft in an
Iranian desert, killing eight servicemen.
   The Sunday Telegraph quoted unidentified security sources as
saying the second mission was conceived by the Republican Party
because it feared its presidential candidate, Reagan, might inherit
the hostage crisis if he won the election.
   The American hostages where freed in January 1981 after 444 days
in captivity.
   The British account reported a Nixon aide said, ``We will neither
confirm nor deny this story. We have nothing to say.'' It did not
identify the aide.
   The newspaper said Nixon's plan was inspired by the SAS assault
on gunmen holding hostages at the Iranian Embassy in London on May
5, 1980. Four of the five gunmen were killed in the operation, which
succeeded in freeing the hostages.

   New York Democratic mayoral nominee David
Dinkins won a thundering welcome Saturday night from black leaders
from around the country and told them, ``I promise you, I will not
let you down.''
   Dinkins, a black who defeated Mayor Ed Koch in the New York
primary five days ago, was met by a standing ovation as he appeared
before the annual awards dinner of the Congressional Black Caucus.
The dinner and fund-raiser attended by an estimated 4,000 people,
including elected blacks from around the nation.
   ``I recognize that I am a vehicle, an instrument,'' Dinkins said.
``I stand for a lot of folks whose philosophy is like mine.
   ``Everybody stands on somebody's shoulders,'' Dinkins said,
paying tribute to civil rights figure Rosa Parks and to the Rev.
Jesse Jackson, the two-time candidate for the Democratic
presidential nomination.
   ``I promise you, I will not let you down,'' Dinkins said.
   Another black candidate seeking a ground-breaking victory,
Virginia Lt. Gov. Doug Wilder, who is the Democratic nominee for
governor and could become the first elected black governor, also
appeared briefly and received a standing ovation.
   The $300-per-plate dinner concluded the Congressional Black
Caucus' 19th Annual Legislative Weekend, a three-day gathering to
discuss social and legislative concerns of black Americans.
   Jackson, who spoke at earlier events, wandered through the large
banquet room at a Washington hotel sporting a Dinkins button in his
lapel.
   Members recalled and mourned the late Rep. Mickey Leland,
D-Texas, who died last month in a plane crash while visiting hunger
victims in Ethiopia. Leland was chairman of the House Select
Committee on Hunger. Instead of their customary musical
entertainment, caucus officials dedicated a portion of their program
to a remembrance of Leland.
   The caucus consists of 23 black members of Congress, all of whom
are Democrats and members of the House of Representatives. It was
first organized as a caucus by 13 black members in 1970. Since then,
blacks have increased in numbers and positions of seniority in the
Congress.
   The event was expected to raise more than $1 million from ticket
sales and corporate donations for the caucus's fund-raising arm, the
Congressional Black Caucus Foundation, according to its leaders.
   ``We should clear $1 million, and I think that's pretty good,''
said the senior black member of Congress, Rep. Augustus Hawkins,
D-Calif., who has served in the House since 1963.
   The event has also become a major social event for black
political leaders, attracting black stars from the sports and
entertainment worlds as well as black officeholders from around the
country. At one of the opening events, black television journalist
Kenneth Walker called the gathering ``African Americans' No. 1
party.''
   Johnnetta B. Coleman, president of the historically black Spelman
College in Atlanta, was to deliver the keynote dinner address on the
event's theme, ``A Global Crisis: Our Children At Risk.''
   Award recipients were:
   _ Georgetown University basketball Coach John Thompson, receiving
the George Collins Award for commmunity service.
   _ Hawkins, the William Dawson Award for legislative development
   _ Rep. William Gray, D-Pa., House majority whip, the Adam Clayton
Powell Award for political empowerment.
   _ Faye Wattleton, president of Planned Parenthood Federation of
America, the Humanitarian Award.
   _ Ron Brown, Democratic National Chairman, the Harold Washington
award for excellence in coalition building.

<TEXT>
   The University of South Carolina told
opponents' marching bands not to play the song ``Louie, Louie'' at
its football stadium out of concern the structure could be damaged
by dancing fans.
   South Carolina's marching band last played the song at the
Nebraska game in 1986. Fans in the east upper deck of the
Williams-Brice Stadium caused the stadium to sway, and those below
the deck became alarmed.
   Engineering studies performed after the Nebraska game showed the
stadium to be safe.
   ``Structurally, if you've got the whole student body out there
jumping up and down constantly for 75 years, you might have some
metal fatigue,'' said John Trussell, assistant director for the
Insurance Reserve Fund, which insures the stadium. ``But with only
six or eight games a year, it will fall down from old age long
before that.''
   Jerry T. Brewer, dean of student life, wrote to James K.
Copenhaver, director of university bands, that the Insurance Reserve
Fund has ``specifically mandated that `Louie, Louie' not be played.
I know this request may seem unusual to band directors, but a
`swaying' stadium is definitely not a usual occurrence.''
   Trussell, however, said the fund, which gets its marching orders
from the state, had not outlawed any songs.
   ``There's no provision in a policy saying, `Thou Shalt Not Play
Louie, Louie,'' he said.

   A fire blamed on arson swept through a
Sydney area hostel popular with overseas tourists early Sunday,
killing at least five people and injuring 17, an official said.
   The fire began shortly before 5 a.m. at the Down Under Hotel in
the suburb of Kings Cross.
   The five people who perished were in two bedrooms on the second
floor, a Fire Brigade spokesman said, speaking on condition of
anonymity. It was not known if any foreigners were among the dead.
   Two of the injured were reported in critical condition.
   Arson was suspected, the spokesman said. ``We don't believe it
started naturally,'' he told the Australian Associated Press.
   It was not known how many people were staying at the hostel when
the fire broke out, according to the spokesman. He said at least 60
people were rescued from the burning building and some saved
themselves by jumping from windows.
   Danish tourist Jan Martens told a radio interviewer he escaped
only in his underwear by climbing out of a window.
   The spokesman said there might be bodies still in the gutted
wreckage.
   Many of the injured were hospitalized with burns and smoke
inhalation, he said.

   British agents planted propaganda in American
newspapers, harassed political enemies in Congress and labor unions
and waged economic warfare in this country in the years before Pearl
Harbor, according to a secret history quoted by the Washington Post
in Sunday editions.
   Agents headed by Sir William Stephenson, celebrated in the 1976
book, ``A Man Called Intrepid,'' waged their campaign out of an
office in Rockefeller Center in New York known as British Security
Coordination, the history said.
   The Post said 10 leatherbound copies of the 423-page document
prepared in 1945 were said to have been distributed but that none
have surfaced until now. The newspaper said it was allowed to take
extensive notes on a copy of the history but did not name its source.
   Several American newspaper publishers as well as columnists
Walter Lippmann, Walter Winchell and Drew Pearson were described as
helpful to the British effort to discredit isolationism and harass
Nazi sympathizers.
   The history portrays America on the eve of World War II as easy
to manipulate. ``These people, though fully conscious of their
wealth and power in the aggregate, are still unsure of themselves
individually, still basically on the defensive ...'' the Post quotes
the history as saying.
   It quotes the history as detailing a media campaign against
Gerhard Alois Westrick, allegedly a German agent in the United
States with close ties to Torkild Rieber, the president of Texaco.
   A ``first class news story'' was ``written by BSC and placed
through an intermediary in the New York Herald Tribune ...'' under
headlines such as ``Hitler Agent Ensconced in Westchester,'' the
history said.
   ``Westrick was deluged with threatening telephone calls,'' it
said. ``A hostile crowd gathered outside his house.'' His American
contacts deserted him, according to the document.
   The history said a British front group called Fight for Freedom
passed out 25,000 handbills at a September 1941 speech in Boston by
isolationist Sen. Gerald P. Nye, attacking him as ``an appeaser and
a Nazi lover.'' It said British agents tried unsuccessfully to sow
confusion at an America First rally at Madison Square Garden a month
later by distributing duplicate tickets.
   The history said the British started a rumor mill. ``Objectives
ranged all the way from publicizing misleading information about
allied strategy to undermining the prestige of an individual Nazi by
encouraging salacious gossip about his private life.''

<HEAD>Report: Government Says Pan Am Lax On Security After Blast</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pan American World Airways is trying to head off
government fines for lax security measures found after last year's
bombing of a jet over Scotland, according to a report Sunday.
   Pan Am Chairman Thomas G. Plaskett went to Washington last week
to argue to federal officials that results of a special government
investigation, which found security flaws, do not warrant penalties,
The New York Times reported.
   The security flaws are not believed to be tied to the bombing of
Flight 103 but did involve violations of rules about screening
passengers and baggage, the newspaper said. The flight originated in
Frankfurt and made a stop in London; it was headed for New York.
   Investigators say a bomb disguised in a radio-cassette player was
put aboard the plane in a suitcase at Frankfurt. The plane exploded
over Lockerbie, Scotland, on Dec. 21, killing all 259 people aboard
and 11 others on the ground.
   ABC News reported in January that baggage handlers and others at
London's Heathrow Airport were not passing background checks, and
that one Pan Am security guard in Frankfurt said he had received
only minimal training before going to work for the company.
   A routine investigation in October 1988 found Pan Am security at
Frankfurt generally acceptable, the Times reported. But in the weeks
after the explosion, the special investigation by the Federal
Aviation Administration found several violations.
   The newspaper quoted unidentified aviation officials as saying
that any flaws found in that special inquiry were corrected months
ago.

<HEAD>Fans Do Without Umbrellas During Football Games</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NORMAN, Okla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mary Poppins and her pals are no longer
welcome at University of Oklahoma home football games _ now that
umbrellas are banned.
   Robert C. Connor, manager of athletic housing and facilities,
says spectators have been cooperative about the new Oklahoma
Memorial Stadium ban on umbrellas in the stadium during football
games.
   In fact, fans cheered and applauded during the first game of the
season, a rainy 73-3 blowout aginst New Mexico State, when the
announcement was made over the public address system, Connor said
Friday.
   The decision was made to ban the use of umbrellas at home games
because for liability reasons and because fans complained that the
umbrellas blocked their view, Connor said.
   ``Our primary concern was the liability that someone can get
poked in the eye,'' Connor said.
   The new policy was put to the test at Oklahoma's first two games,
which were both played under rainy skies, but it didn't create any
major problems, Connor said.

   State Assemblyman William Hoyt, who finished
third in the city's Democratic mayoral primary, said Friday he was
dropping out of the race and endorsing Wilbur Trammell in the
November election.
   ``Clearly, there is only room for two candidates in this race,''
Hoyt said. ``Therefore, for the good of our community, I have
decided to set aside my own ambitions and give Judge Trammell that
one-on-one opportunity to beat Mayor (James) Griffin.''
   Griffin won the primary with 41 percent of the vote, compared to
Trammell's 36 percent and Hoyt's 23 percent.
   Trammell, who is trying to become the city's first black mayor,
intends to challenge Griffin on an independent line.
   With his victory, Griffin secured the Democratic line. He already
had Republican, Conservative and Right-to-Life endorsements and is
favored to win re-election to an unprecedented fourth four-year term.
   Hoyt, who was the endorsed candidate of the local Democratic
party, had said he was prepared to continue the race even after
losing the primary. Hoyt would have appeared on the ballot under the
Liberal Party line.

   A London-based movement for free speech said Friday
that three Soviet soldiers were punished for brutality, but the
Estonian journalist who helped expose the case was drafted into the
army in retaliation.
   The Index on Censorship organization appealed to supporters to
write to Soviet Defense Minister Dmitri Yazov and protest.
   It said Noorte Haal (Voice of Youth), journal of the Komsomol
Youth Communist League in Estonia, published an article on March 21
``about the appalling experiences in the Soviet army'' of ``Mati,''
a young Estonian conscript.
   It said ``brutality, degradation and corruption were starkly
revealed as well as the fact that Mati had traveled to Moscow to
describe his case and apply for a transfer.''
   It said authorities agreed to transfer him, but on Sept. 13 the
journalist, Madis Jurgen, was ordered to report for an army medical
examination in six days.
   Jurgen's report led to a trial that ended on Aug. 4 with one
soldier's being sentenced to four years in a labor camp and two
others to three years in a disciplinary battalion, it said.
   Index on Censorship said a company commander was forced to retire
and his political aide was reprimanded and transferred.
   ``The journalist, Madis Jurgen, will nevertheless be drafted for
exposing an illegality which led to the trial and conviction of at
least some of the guilty,'' it said.
   Index on Censorship did not identify the unit or give other
details about Mati, who came from Tallinn, capital of Estonia, or
Jurgen.
   The glasnost-era Soviet press has exposed widespread hazing of
recruits, poor living conditions in the barracks and other woes in
the Soviet armed forces, which once were above public reproach.

   Two East German refugees who taught ballroom
dancing in their homeland fulfilled a lifelong dream Friday by
swirling around a dance floor at Blackpool, a mecca for their art.
   When Hans Georg Stelnig and his wife, Evelyn, crossed from
Hungary to Austria with thousands of other East Germans earlier this
week, he laughingly told television reporters, ``We are going to
Blackpool!''
   Devotees of ballroom dancing consider the English east coast
resort city to be a hotbed for that dance form.
   Britain's Independent Television News arranged to bring the
Stelnigs to Blackpool, where they were greeted with a bouquet and a
tour of the sights.
   They were also allowed to switch on the city's famous
``illuminations,'' lighting up the streets and buildings.
   He wore evening clothes and she sported a black and white polka
dot gown as they pulled the electric switch and giggled with delight
to see ``Welcome Hans Georg and Evelyn'' spelled out in lights.
   They later spun gracefully around a ballroom dance floor by
themselves while an orchestra played ``The Last Waltz.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Farm-state senators said Friday they hoped the
Senate would act quickly on a committee proposal that could mean
larger disaster payments to winter wheat and cotton farmers who
started a second crop after weather destroyed their first.
   Legislation approved by the Senate Agriculture Committee Thursday
night would change the way disaster assistance payments are
calculated.
   Lawmakers have complained that an Agriculture Department formula
will penalize those producers, and in some instances mean farmers
could receive no disaster payments even though they earned little or
no profit on their second crops.
   The proposal is part of a broad budget-balancing package the
Senate is expected to consider soon, but some farm-state members
hope the disaster relief measure can be acted on separately.
   The problem stems from a nearly $900 million disaster relief
package enacted last month. In an effort to prevent farmers from
reaping double benefits, it required the department to reduce
assistance payments to farmers by the value of any crop that
replaced one ruined by bad weather.
   The legislation did not spell out how to determine the
replacement crop value. The department decided to deduct 75 percent
of the gross value of the replacement crop from the disaster payment
a farmer would have otherwise received for losses on his first crop.
   The formula is supposed to account for production costs of the
replacement crop, in effect coming up with a net value figure.
However, lawmakers contended the does not account for regional
differences in production costs.
   Under the Agriculture Committee proposal, farmers would have no
payment reductions if their replacement crops failed to produce more
than 40 percent of the average yield in their county. Those farmers
harvesting more than that would undergo the 75 percent deduction
only on the value of their replacement crops above the 40 percent
yield threshold.
   Other provisions would require quick payment for acres not
replanted, for which farmers would have to apply before Oct. 1.

<TEXT>
   The government and Mobil Oil signed a contract
Friday opening for exploration much of Peru's Upper Huallaga Valley,
a region largely under leftist rebel control and a focus of
President Bush's anti-drug strategy.
   The valley, 270 miles northeast of Lima, is the source of most of
the world's coca leaf, the raw material for making cocaine. Peruvian
police with help from U.S. drug agents are conducting raids there to
destroy labs operated by drug traffickers allied with the Maoist
Shining Path guerrillas.
   President Alan Garcia said the presence of Mobil in the Huallaga
Valley is a ``long-term way to combat subversion and to combat the
cultivation of coca.''
   Government officials and company representitives did not comment
on what security measures would be taken to protect Mobil workers.
   The agreement calls for an initial investment of $107.5 million
in the valley over the contract's six-year exploration phase and the
drilling of at least one exploratory well a year. More than 14,000
square miles of the valley will be open for exploration.
   The company is required to begin exploration work within 180 days.
   Mobil predicts a possible investment of $1.5 to $2 billion over
the 30-year extraction phase of the contract should exploration
prove fruitful.
   Daniel Nunez, president of the state-owned petroleum company
PetroPeru, which represents the government in the contract, said the
area could contain as much as 1 billion barrels of oil.
   The government estimates Peru's current oil reserves at about 440
million barrels. Peru produces about 140,000 barrels a day, of which
about 120,000 barrels are used domestically.
   The only other foreign oil company operating in Peru is
Occidental Petroleum, which has wells in the Amazon jungle near the
border with Ecuador.

   A chemical-laden train car exploded Friday
in a rail yard, breaking windows, injuring one man and prompting

   The car, a tanker composed of sealed compartments, was loaded
with calcium carbide, a powder that forms volatile acetylene gas
when mixed with water, officials said.
   At least two of the car's compartments remained intact, but an
evacuation was ordered because intermittent rain posed the threat of
more explosions, Louisville Fire Chief Russell Sanders said.
   The fire department's hazardous-materials unit eventually covered
the wreckage in plastic. Area residents were allowed back into their

   A man was injured in the blast, but was conscious and talking to
rescuers as he was taken to Humana Hospital-University of

   A nursing supervisor at the hospital identified the victim as
Tracey Knight. She said his condition was stable and that he was
being treated in the emergency room, but that no other details could

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Police on Friday arrested the No. 2

custody for illegal possession of an Uzi submachine gun, party
leader Rene Theodore said.
   He said police arrested Max Bourjolly, second-in-command of the

house in suburban Thomassin, east of Port-au-Prince, after seizing
his security guard during the night in the courtyard of the house.
   Theodore said the guard had no permit for the gun. He said
Bourjolly himself possessed no weapons.
   Private Radio Haiti Inter quoted police as saying they were
apprehended during a night patrol.
   It said Bourjolly was held in suburban Petionville police station
and would probably be charged or released Monday.
   The Communist Party, other political parties and labor unions
called on motorists to honk their horns for 15 minutes at noon
Monday to protest austerity measures, including tax increases, which
the opposition says will cause social unrest and hardship.

<TEXT>
   Ethiopia and the Eritrean People's Liberation
Front have agreed to meet in Africa to discuss an end to their
28-year-old war, but former President Jimmy Carter said Friday
``significant'' disagreements remain over the framework for the
talks.
   Carter said the two sides made progress in negotiations in
Atlanta to set an agenda for peace talks, agreeing on such items as
the official languages, publicity, recording and procedural rules
for the next talks.
   Still unresolved after a week of meetings at The Carter Center
are who would serve as co-chairmen for the peace talks, who would be
allowed as observers and what would be the duties of the meeting's
staff, Carter said.
   The talks would be held at one or more of these African nations:
North Yemen, Egypt, Sudan, Kenya, Tanzania and Zimbabwe. Carter said
no date for the peace talks has been set.
   Representatives of the Ethiopian government and the rebel EPLF
have met daily, except last Sunday, since Sept. 7 with Carter as a
neutral observer to draft an agenda for future, substantiative peace
talks.
   Carter is leaving Saturday for a three-day fact-finding mission
in Nicaragua, and the Ethiopia-EPLF talks here will conclude upon
his return Tuesday.
   Observers of African affairs had said at the outset of the
Atlanta talks that Carter had accomplished something by merely
getting Ethiopia and Eritrea to sit down together.
   Carter himself said he feared the animosity between the two sides
might doom the talks before any progress was made. But he told
reporters Friday both sides have gotten along well.
   ``I would tell you, the determination on both sides successfully
to resolve the differences that have caused the war has been very
obvious.''
   The leaders of the respective delegations _ Ashegre Yigletu, head
of the government Central Committee's Foreign Relations Department,
and Alamin Mohamed Saiyed, an EPLF Politburo member _ appeared with
Carter at the news conference but neither took questions from
reporters.
   Carter said he hoped a cease fire or an improvement in the
delivery of relief services in the region might be undertaken before
the peace talks, but he said he has not tried to suggest what either
side should do.
   He did not rule out the possibility that he would be involved in
the next round of talks, but said at least one co-chairman from
Africa must be selected before he would consider joining the talks.
   Ethiopia and the EPLF have been at war since 1961 over the
independence of Eritrea, a northern province in the Horn of Africa.
The two were joined in a federation that Eritrea opposed.
   An estimated 1 million people have been killed in the fighting
and famine directly related to the war.

<HEAD>State Loses Bid To Close `Tent City' Saturday</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A judge agreed Friday to block the state's
bid to close ``Tent City,'' the makeshift outdoor county prison camp
where 100 inmates have spent the last month, officials said.
   State corrections officials wanted Saturday to be the last day
for the Secaucus camp, opened as a court-ordered measure to relieve
severe overcrowding in the Hudson County jail.
   But the prisoners will stay at least another week under an order
by Judge Burrell Ives Humphrey in Superior Court in Hudson County.
   ``There is no way tent city is closing tomorrow,'' said Cas
Rakowski, a spokesman for the county jail. ``It would be a near
impossibility to take those 100 state prisoners.''
   Humphrey said the state cannot close the tent city without his
approval and without giving at least seven days notice, Rakowski
said.
   The state argued that it had satisfied the original court order
that forced the quick assemblage of tents and barbed wire on a site
in the Hackensack Meadowlands.
   State lawyers said the temporary order covered a 30-day period
ending Saturday, while county representatives said it was in force
long enough for them to complete the new jail, which is scheduled to
open Oct. 9.
   County officials say they cannot find room for the
minimum-security, Tent City inmates until they complete the
prefabricated, 336-bed jail at Kearny.
   The inmates are convicted of crimes that would have them in state
prisons if not for a backlog that has forced an overflow of
state-sentenced prisoners at the county jails.
   While the tent jail has been popular with inmates and has largely
been judged a success, Corrections Department spokesman James
Stabile said it would be unwise to start relying on such stopgap
measures in the future.
   ``This is a temporary measure,'' he said. ``Cold weather is
coming. It's worked with minimum security inmates, (but) it's not
something we wanted to do. It's something we had to do.''
   The inmates have praised the prison camp, saying its spaciousness
and fresh air are superior to the cramped quarters of the
overcrowded, 63-year-old Hudson County Jail, which has a population
near 900.
   ``Prisoners love it out there,'' Rakowski said. ``They have more
freedom, more recreation. ... It's like camp to them.''

<HEAD>Federal Regulators File $1.1 Billion Fraud Suit</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Federal regulators acting on behalf of a seized
California thrift filed a $1.1 billion fraud and racketeering
lawsuit Friday against the founder of the thrift's parent company
and other individuals.
   The civil lawsuit, filed by Resolution Trust Corp. under the
federal racketeering statute, was the government's largest filing
against a thrift. It also alleges negligence, breach of fiduciary
duty and breach of contract.
   The alleged wrongdoing involves Lincoln Savings and Loan, a
wholly owned subsidiary of American Continental Corp. of Phoenix.
Defendants named by the lawsuit included company founder Charles H.
Keating Jr., his wife, and various Keating relatives and company
executives.
   The lawsuit charges fraud in the takeover of Lincoln and
subsequent mismanagement that squandered the thrift's assets,
diverted ``enormous'' sums to the parent company and benefited
American Continental and its executives at Lincoln's expense.
   American Continental was not named in the complaint because it
filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy laws
in April and received an automatic stay.
   The $1.1 billion sought in damages surpasses a $500 million claim
against Sunbelt Savings and Loan. Federal racketeering laws allow
the government to seek triple damages from defendants.
   Federal regulators seized Lincoln on April 14, the day after
American Continental filed for protection from creditors.
   American Continental attorney A. Melvin McDonald said: ``We will
vigorously defend the case and we fully believe that once all the
information comes out we believe that all of the individuals named
will be vindicated.''
   The lawsuit contends that beginning in 1983, Keating and four
other American Continental officers schemed to divert funds from the
thrift for their own use. The five are accused of racketeering. The
lawsuit names a total of 20 individuals and 17 business enterprises.
   ``The implementation of this scheme involved concealing from the
regulatory authorities, first, the true intentions for acquiring
(Lincoln Savings) and, next, the actual operation of the thrift,''
the suit states.
   The lawsuit states that prior to 1984 the defendants operated an
American Continental enterprise comprised of about 17 corporations
primarily focused on speculative real estate transactions.
   It alleges that around 1983, American Continental's enterprises
needed additional funds to expand its real estate transactions.
   The lawsuit claims that American Continental acquired Lincoln
Savings by making ``material misprepresentations'' to the Federal
Home Loan Bank Board, the former agency regulating the nation's
savings and loans.
   It also alleges that once Lincoln Savings became a subsidiary,
money was diverted to the parent; insider loans, bad loans and bad
investmests were made; and transactions were manipulated to enhance
the American Continental and its insiders.
   A recurring element in the transactions, the lawsuit claims, was
that Lincoln Savings turned over cash for American Continental
allegedly to pay the thrift's income taxes, even though no taxes
were currently due.
   Keating and his advisors also face a dozen class-action suits
filed by about 23,000 bondholders. American Continental has
responded by suing the FHLBB and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to
remove Lincoln from federal conservatorship.

   Patients worried they may be infected with the
AIDS virus will be able to get a quick and confidential answer soon
with a simple test that takes only 10 minutes.
   The test, now undergoing trials at nine centers, will enable
people to get results quickly in a doctor's office instead of having
to wait to hear from a distant laboratory.
   ``It provides a new means for patients to learn of their AIDS
status and still retain anonymity,'' said Jarel R. Kelsey, president
of Murex Corp., a Norcross, Ga., firm that developed the test.
``Once this method is widely available, it will encourage more
people to determine their status.''
   Tests for AIDS now require that blood be drawn and sent to a
laboratory for complex processing. Patients must wait to find out if
they have contracted the human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, which
causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome, or AIDS.

   Bad-show fans will find much to like when ``Alien
Nation'' bows tonight with a two-hour premiere that marks Fox
Broadcasting's expansion to Monday night jousts with ABC, CBS and
NBC.
   Only the first hour of ``Alien Nation'' was available for review.
But I will count my blessings, even though I'm no good at fractions.
This hour isn't very apt in writing and direction, and odds are the
second is equally to the left of whoopee.
   Based on the movie of the same name, the new ``Nation'' series
combines cops and family life and _ here's the hook _ highly
intelligent, human-like refugees from another galaxy who now find
themselves in Los Angeles.
   The show stars Gary Graham, a fine young actor, as Matt Sikes, a
streetwise cop (when will TV get a streetdumb cop?) whose black
partner was killed by an outer-space alien during a holdup.
   Matt is bitter at ``slags,'' as he and other racist _ or maybe
it's alienist _ humans call the refugees. No matter that most of the
refugees just want to join the American mainstream and be decent,
hard-working citizens.
   Problem is, the Newcomers tend to stand out. They have strange
heads that resemble coneheads blown backwards and given a rash.
   But of course our angry plainclothes cop is assigned a new
partner, an alien named George Francisco, (Eric Pierpoint). And of
course Matt is not at all happy at this, even though the new guy is
decent, hard-working, and offers him bran muffins and prune juice
when he comes to work.
   But if you don't think Matt will come to respect George and other
decent aliens, you probably don't believe in the tooth fairy.
   The new partner is solidly middle-class and has a family _ a
brilliant wife, a lovable daughter and a rebellious teen-age son who
represents wayward alien youth and hates earthlings, particularly
cops.
   The son is sort of a skinhead who hangs out with similar alien
teens and only wants to speak in his native tongue. His native
tongue is not Mork's cheery ``Nano-Nano.'' It sounds more like a TV
producer discussing a TV critic. But at least you get English
subtitles.
   In time, Matt even has dinner with George's family at George's
home. Save for the son, the family is warm and gracious. Matt
doesn't even have to eat raw beaver as they do (their bodies can't
tolerate cooked food, you see).
   This gradual coming-together is part of the show's underlying
theme of tolerance and acceptance of living things, regardless of
race, creed or galaxy.
   The stage for all this is set at an ugly early scene of alien
hatred. A small mob of humans, one with a sign that says ``America
For Humans,'' gathers at the little alien girl's school, demanding
that the slags get out of their neighborhood.
   Matt, the supposed slag-hater, fires his gun in the air, then
shames them all away. Good Matt.
   Among other digressions, the opening hour has a mysterious case
for the new partners to solve. It concerns a dead wino covered with
rashes and slime whose corpse has been spirited away for some
mysterious alien surgery.
   There also a potential love sub-plot for Matt that involves his
beautiful alien neighbor (Terry Treas), a biochemist. One can only
wonder what kind of amour scenes this will lead to in later episodes.
   For as we learn in a bedroom scene with George and his wife
(Michele Scarabelli), the alien method of foreplay is ... humming.
   Tuesday night marks the premiere of a more humdrum CBS series set
in Hawaii, ``Island Son.'' It stars Richard Chamberlain, the
compassionate, idealistic Dr. Kildare before he became a miniseries
idol.
   Well, he is back as a compassionate, idealistic doctor, one named
Dr. Daniel Kulani, sort of a Hawaiian Kildare. The chief difference,
other than the new setting in a Honolulu hospital, is that this doc
has a lady friend who plays cello.
   The debut show opens with a car crash caused by a drunk driver
and witnessed by Kulani and his sweetie (Leslie Bevis). The crash
leaves a young girl brain-dead, and the plot centers on the anguish
of the doctor and the child's mother over a heart transplant that
could save another child.
   Medical, moral and legal issues are raised and resolved, all
predictably. True, Chamberlain often emits lines that bad-dialogue
collectors will treasure forever.
   But that may not prove sufficient to keep this medicine show from
soon being told to pack its satchel, leave Hawaii, and move to the
tiny TV island of Cancel-Cancel.

<HEAD>The NAIC Pleas For A Capital Gains Tax Cut</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If a proposed capital gains tax cut would benefit
mainly the very rich, as critics claim, then its benefits must be
broadened if it is to receive popular support.
   That's not the only major problem facing the proposal, which last
week won approval from the House Ways and Means Committee. The
Senate is considering a different approach. Somehow, a compromise
must be reached.
   With these and other considerations in mind, Thomas O'Hara,
chairman of the National Association of Investors Corp., whose
membership includes 6,832 investment clubs, decided to write
President Bush and Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill.
   His proposals:
   _Permit the first $25,000 of an individual's capital gains each
year to be tax-free.
   _Grant a lifetime exemption of $500,000 in capital gains from
stocks to an individual. This would be in line with the precedent
set for profits on home sales.
   _Allow an individual to roll-over capital gains from securities
into new investments without tax on capital gains until retirement
age is reached. And then tax only half those gains.
   _Index capital gains to inflation.
   These ideas might help, said O'Hara, because compromise must be
reached not just in Congress, but between the White House and
Rostenkowski. Bush feels a cut would encourage long-term investing.
Rostenkowski, Ways and Means Committee chairman, thinks that over
time it would deprive Uncle Sam of funds.
   The platform from which O'Hara's proposals are made is an
interesting one. Most NAIC clubs began with little money. In August,
these clubs averaged 16.2 members and $65,000 in assets, to which
they added $452.77 per club in contributions.
   As a group, therefore, they might have a small-investor view. But
they also have some big-investor credentials. Some clubs have been
very successful, helping members to buy houses and pay tuitions. As
individuals, apart from their club membership, some members have
portfolios that run into the millions of dollars.
   The association's viewpoint is further broadened by inclusion of
48,000 individual members in a low-cost investment program, in which
investors buy their first share in a company through NAIC, and
thereafter buy directly from that company on a monthly or quarterly
basis. Average investment: $75 a shot.
   From NAIC headquarters in Royal Oak, Mich., O'Hara said, ``We
asked our members why they were not as active as individual
investors as they had been in the past.''
   The common response, he says, was that members were discouraged
by the change Congress made in 1986 by taxing capital gains, plus
they felt there was a lack of consistency in taxing policy.
   That struck at the NAIC's foundation; it was created to attract
ordinary folks into becoming investors, to get them to save and win
rather than spend and lose, yet its own members showed a growing
reluctance to invest.
   In short, though interested in stocks, members were becoming like
the rest of the public. Thirty years ago the individual investor
accounted for 80 percent of New York Stock Exchange trading. Now
it's less than 20 percent.
   This situation, he feels, greatly reduces liquidity in the
securities markets, reduces capital needed for smaller businesses
and deprives individuals of the advantages that come with economic
participation.
   Moreover, he says, America faces growing international
competition. The cost of raising capital is much lower in many
nations with which we compete, one reason being that some have no
capital gains tax at all.
   ``It is clear to us that the less we have in the way of a capital
gains tax, the lower the cost of capital will be in this country and
the more competitive our industry will be,'' O'Hara wrote.
   He added a personal observation.
   ``I am 74 years old and have spent most of my life working with
individual investors, encouraging them to save more and invest more.
   ``I write with the strongest personal conviction that there are
only two things that can turn our nation of consumers into a nation
of investors.''
   One, he said, is a meaningful reduction in capital gains
taxation. The other: Depression. The latter, he said, would be an
incredibly painful lesson. The first, he wrote, ``will work beyond
our greatest expectations.''

<HEAD>Texas Air, UAL Tales Illustrate Two Schools of Airline Management</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Like two jumbo jets thundering down opposite
runways, the bosses of Texas Air Corp. and UAL Corp. have taken
strikingly different approaches to survival _ one fighting its
workers, the other offering to make them owners.
   The contentious, defiant strategy invoked by Texas Air chairman
Frank Lorenzo was on display this past week as the company staged
its long-delayed shareholders meeting in a Houston hotel with union
pickets chanting anti-Lorenzo slogans outside.
   Meanwhile, in Chicago, a labor-management coalition pressed its
bid to buy UAL with the company's blessing, proving there is no
standard operating procedure for running an airline.
   Lorenzo has carried an anti-union stigma for the past several
years, starting with a confrontation at Texas Air subsidiary
Continental Airlines, which he took into bankruptcy court to nullify
union contracts and lower costs.
   Now out of bankruptcy court, Continental flies with mostly
non-union help and often leads the way in lowering ticket prices
because the airline is cheaper to operate than many of its
competitors.
   Although Lorenzo denies he opposes organized labor, his image as
a union-basher grew over much of the past year, largely because of a
strike at Texas Air's other airline, Eastern, which he also has
hauled into bankruptcy court.
   In the Eastern case, Lorenzo has hired non-unionists and
picket-line crossers to replace the strikers. He has plans to make
the airline a low-cost, smaller, more efficient operation regardless
of what happens in the strike.
   Lorenzo reiterated those plans at the Texas Air annual meeting,
where questions abounded about his own future as well as those of
Eastern and Continental, which have enormous debts.
   He denied speculation he might sell what's left of Eastern and
walk away from a business in which he has played a major role for
more than a decade. On the contrary, Lorenzo predicted Eastern would
start making money next year.
   A different drama was unfolding at UAL, one of the nation's most
profitable airlines. Unlike Texas Air, UAL has long been seen as an
attractive takeover target because it has low debt, lots of
airplanes that can be used as collateral, and a highly prized route
network into fast-growing Asia that could defray the impact of a
domestic economic slowdown on the airline business.
   Perhaps more important, a change of UAL management in 1988 has
gained the confidence of pilots, who struck four years ago in a
bitter dispute over pay.
   That confidence has translated into their joint $6.75 billion bid
with management to buy UAL, an offer that makes important labor
concessions including pay cuts and a no-strike clause.
   As of late last week their bid seemed to have a good chance of
succeeding, although California investor Marvin Davis offered to
match the bid without demanding concessions from the unions.
   If the labor bid succeeds, UAL would become the largest
employee-owned company in the country, and could displace Texas Air
as the low-cost trendsetter.
   In other business and economic news this past week:
   _Junk-bond repayment problems by Canadian property company
Campeau Corp. jolted the market and incited widespread anxiety about
the financial health of other companies that have sold the high-risk
debt securities. Some junk bonds tumbled in value and their yields
rose to 30 percent.
   _The government dumped a load of economic statistics on the
financial markets that suggested the economy is slowing and
inflation remains subdued, but the information did little to
encourage the purchase of stocks and bonds. The Labor Department
said wholesale prices dropped in August for the third straight
month, and the Commerce Department said the July trade deficit hit a
five-year low of $7.58 billion. It also said retail sales rose in
August, but that was mainly due to a surge in auto buying that's not
expected to last.
   _Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., the Wall Street investment bank
that pioneered the use of junk bonds for takeovers and corporate
growth, formally pleaded guilty to six felonies and fines, penalties
and other costs exceeding $650 million. The plea closed a chapter in
an insider trading scandal that began with the arrest of speculator
Ivan Boesky nearly three years ago.

<BYLINE>After Hot Summer For Stocks, An Autumn Chill? ^By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After the stock market's long summer rally, many
analysts and money managers fear it is heading for an autumn fall.
   The fears started to rise even before the debt problems of
Campeau Corp. roiled the market for high-yield ``junk'' bonds in the
past few days.
   They intensified when the news about Campeau raised the question
of whether stocks might catch a chill should takeover fever die down.
   But a vocal group of optimists persists in predicting new highs
for the market above the peaks reached at the beginning of this
month. Junk bond worries, they say, may prove nothing more than a
convenient excuse for stocks to undergo a ``correction'' that sets
the stage for a renewed advance.
   ``Memories of past Octobers have stirred up fears in almost every
analyst we have heard in the past several weeks,'' said Stephen Leeb
in his investment advisory letter Indicator Digest.
   ``While admittedly few are predicting a crash, many if not most
feel that a correction of 10 percent or more is likely by the end of
October. Yet not one of these pundits is predicting a concomitant
rise in interest rates or big uptick in economic activity.
   ``This is akin to predicting that a rocket ship will blast off
without any fuel in it. It just doesn't work that way.''
   For a significant decline in stock prices to occur, Leeb argues,
``you must have _ at a minimum _ a sharp rise in interest rates. And
that is simply not in the cards.''
   Many people who make the decisions at investing institutions such
as pension funds came back from the Labor Day holiday in a wary
mood, seeking ways to preserve the gains they racked up over the
first eight months of the year.
   The most obvious way to do this is to ``raise cash,'' in Wall
Street parlance, by selling some stocks and putting the proceeds in
short-term money market investments.
   But John Connolly at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. argues that the
supposed safety in such a strategy could be illusory in a business
where money managers are measured against their counterparts'
performance and the market indexes.
   ``The problem with trying to duck a correction today is that
there appears to be very decent potential left on the table,'' he
maintains. ``A decent bond outlook, a stable dollar and an economy
without excesses is hardly the environment that makes stocks
particularly dangerous.
   ``A correction may occur, given the sharp summer advance, but we
view it as essentially unplayable. The fundamentals are too solid
and the potential too high to try to sit on a lead.''
   Wariness prevailed over enthusiasm in the past week, however, as
stocks recorded their second straight loss after nine consecutive
weeks of gains.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 34.96 to 2,674.58
on top of a 42.55-point loss the week before.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index fell 2.36 to 191.59;
the NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market lost 3.74
to 467.57, and the American Stock Exchange market value index was
down 4.46 at 379.64.
   Big Board volume averaged 165.52 million shares a day, against
155.31 million in the previous week.
   Emphatically not among the bulls on the stock market outlook is
James Grant, editor of the advisory service Grant's Interest Rate
Observer, who says:
   ``Stocks in general are strong. Yet junk bonds are markedly weak.
How to explain the divergence?
   ``As always, the correct and certain answer is unknowable.
However, we happen to have a hypothesis in the form of a prejudice,
or guess: The stock market is kidding itself and is riding for a
fall.''

   Companies controlled by billionaire Texas
investor Harold C. Simmons are cutting their stake in Georgia Gulf
Corp. and putting on hold a plan to oust the chemical concern's
board.
   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday
, the Dallas-based Simmons consortium _ headed by NL Industries Inc.
_ said it was cutting its Georgia Gulf holdings to 8.9 percent of
common stock outstanding.
   NL also said it wants to work with Georgia Gulf in its ``pursuit
of alternative transactions.''
   Previously, NL Industries said it would seek written consents
from shareholders to oust the board after it rejected an offer to
acquire the Atlanta-based company or help it recapitalize, which
would give shareholders at least $55 per share in cash.
   No further meetings between NL and Georgia Gulf are scheduled,
the SEC filing said.
   Georgia Gulf's board announced on Thursday that it had asked
investment banking firm Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. to explore alternative
transactions such as an acquisition or joint venture.
   Meanwhile, NL Industries and another Simmons affilate, NL
Chemicals Inc., have sold off 230,000 Georgia Gulf shares over the
last two weeks, cutting their holdings from 9.9 to 8.9 percent. NL
controls 5.6 percent of Georgia Gulf's outstanding common stock,
whicle NL Chemicals has 3.3 percent.
   The shares were sold in blocks ranging from 6,300 shares to
33,500 shares for prices between $58.50 and $59.50 per share.
   The two Simmons companies said they will continue selling shares
if they stay above the $55 price they believe could be obtained
through leveraged recapitalization, merger or other transaction.
   But NL and NLC also said they would resume their dump-the-board
plan in Georgia Gulf takes steps ``not reasonably calculated to
realize'' at least $55 per share for stockholders.

   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady says
investors shouldn't be worried about price drops in the junk bond
market spreading to the stock market.
   ``I don't think that's going to happen,'' Brady told a luncheon
marking the 50th anniversary of the National Association of
Securities Dealers on Friday.
   Brady also defended the proposed cut in capital gains taxes but
said he favored a reduction longer the 27 months contained in a
House bill that passed through committee this week.
   The market in high-yield, high-risk bonds has been in tailspin
since Wednesday, when retailing giant Campeau Corp. said it might
not be able to make a major loan payment for one of its affiliates
to avoid defaulting on its junk bond debt.
   Since then, panicky investors have dumped issues they deemed
especially risky.
   But Brady said junk bonds ``have a substantial assets base. This
isn't just equity in disguise. There literally are assets behind
it.''
   ``So I don't think it'll have an effect on the stock market,'' he
added.
   After a brief speech, Brady answered several questions at the
luncheon for NASD, the self-regulatory group that oversees the
over-the-counter market of securities that aren't traded on nation's
major stock exchanges.
   He defended the proposed cut in capital gains _ profits from the
sale of capital assets such as stocks or real estate _ approved by
the House Ways and Means Committee on Thursday. The plan still must
clear the full House as well as the Senate.
   The plan approved by the committee would reduce the tax rate of
33 percent to 19.6 percent for the next 27 months. The tax rate then
would rise to 28 percent but would be ``indexed'' to tax only
increases exceeding the annual inflation rate.
   Brady said he wished the terms of the proposed tax were longer,
``but let's take what we can get and keep working on it,'' he said.
   Critics have called it a tax break for the rich, while supporters
say it would help the economy by encouraging investment.
   ``People are beginning to understand that this not only benefits
people who are in our industry, purchasing and selling securities,''
Brady told the crowd of about 300 stock and bond dealers, industry
regulators and reporters.
   ``It benefits the guy who who starts a steel distribution
business, with his $10,000 savings, in his garage and 38 years later
sells it to somebody else for 750,000 bucks,'' he said. ``They're
starting to understand that this isn't some sort of Wall Street
benefit plan.''
