   An infant abducted from a hospital pediatric
ward was returned safely on Tuesday, about 24 hours after he was
reported missing, and a woman who recently lost her own baby was
arrested, authorities said.
   The infant, now 19 days old, appeared to have been well cared
for and was in excellent condition, according to Ann Chisholm, a
spokeswoman for D.C. General Hospital.
   Lisa P. Oliver, 23, of Washington, was charged with kidnapping,
police said. She was scheduled for a D.C. Superior Court appearance
on Wednesday. Oliver recently lost a baby of her own and
desperately wanted another, D.C. Police Chief Deputy Alfonso Gibson
said.
   ``She did have a child that she had lost,'' Gibson said.
``Apparently, she had a cradle and all of the necessities that's
needed to care for an infant.''
   The baby, who was up for adoption, was taken by a woman posing
as hospital volunteer, police said.
   Police spokesman Quintin Peterson said detectives were led to
Ms. Oliver after receiving tips from neighbors. Someone saw Ms.
Oliver with a baby Tuesday, and knowing that she didn't have a
child, called the police. She was arrested at her home, authorities
said.
   Hospital officials said Tuesday new security measures were being
considered.
   ``We are certainly going to take a look at some changes with
regard to the check-in procedures and the identification of
volunteers,'' Ms. Chisholm said.

   Jim Bakker, the television evangelist who
lost his PTL empire in a sex scandal, was sentenced to 45 years in
prison and fined $500,000 Tuesday for defrauding his followers for
his own enrichment.
   ``I'm deeply sorry for those I have hurt,'' Bakker, 49, said
before he was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Robert Potter. ``I
have sinned. But never in my life did I intend to defraud.''
   Bakker shook his head in disbelief while a federal prosecutor
presented arguments, as did his daughter, Tammy Sue Chapman.
Bakker's wife, Tammy Faye, did not attend the court session.
   Potter is nicknamed ``Maximum Bob'' after his reputation for
harsh sentences, particularly in drug sentences.
   Bakker had faced a maximum sentence of 120 years, but the judge
consolidated the 24 fraud and conspiracy counts to nine and
sentenced Bakker to five years on each. Bakker could be eligible
for parole in 10 years.
   His lawyers said they would appeal, and despite defense pleas,
Bakker was immediately taken into custody and driven to the
medium-security Federal Correctional Institution at Talladega,
Ala., about 60 miles east of Birmingham.
   In handing down the sentence, Potter said, ``I'm concerned about
the hundreds of letters I have here from people who say they'd do
anything for him and that could include preventing Mr. Bakker from
going to prison. I believe them.''
   Because of that, he said, ``I think we're going to have to put
him into custody.''
   At that point, Bakker's daughter broke into sobs.
   Bakker was put in a holding cell, then taken away in a
government sedan to Talladega. He arrived at the prison about 9:30
p.m. CDT and was led in handcuffs and shackles to the prison
entrance.
   Bakker kept his eyes on the ground and did not comment as he was
hustled inside surrounded by six guards. A prison official said
Bakker would probably be transferred to another prison in one or
two weeks.
   Bakker's attorney, Harold Bender, said his client was ``in as
good spirits as he can be under the circumstances. Of course, he's
concerned about the lengthy sentence but he has strong faith, and
will come through.''
   Bender said he had filed notice of appeal with the 4th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Va., and would ask the court
to free Bakker on bond.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Jerry Miller said Bakker's sentence
``sends a message that you can't use TV and the mails to make
fraudulent statements to get people to send money to you. This is a
simple fraud case.''
   Jessica Hahn, the former church secretary whose sexual tryst
with Bakker led to the hush money scandal that caused him to lose
control of PTL in 1987, said she wasn't satisfied with the sentence.
   ``It cannot repay those millions of dollars, and the years of
work people did to make it, but at least it's a start,'' Hahn said
in a telephone interview with The Associated Press from her West
Hollwood, Calif., home. ``At least people can feel like they won't
be taken for fools.
   ``How must they feel?'' she asked. ``The ones who gave millions,
the people who took out loans? ''
   Bakker supporter Helen Gordon said the sentence was not fair.
``Jim Bakker's no crook. The news media made him look like one,''
she said.
   There was no sign of Mrs. Bakker in Charlotte or at the couple's
home in Orlando, Fla., where the couple established a new church
and television ministry.
   Former defense attorney George T. Davis said the sentence was
``pretty heavy ... for a white-collar criminal. That's pretty
startling.'' Davis, who was interviewed by telephone in Atlanta
while awaiting a flight to his home in Hawaii, said he asked Bakker
to release him from the case before sentencing.
   Prosecutors didn't recommend a specific sentence, but asked
Potter for a long sentence and a heavy fine, arguing that Bakker
hasn't assumed responsibility for his crimes. The government also
asked that Bakker be ordered to repay up to $100 million in money
donated by followers.
   Potter did not order Bakker to make restitution, saying that
issue needed to be resolved in bankruptcy court.
   Bender, asked Potter to consider alternatives to prison ``and
allow this defendant the benefit of the court's compassion and
mercy.''
   Bakker was convicted Oct. 5 on 23 counts of fraud and one count
of conspiracy for selling lodging guarantees at his Christian
retreat when he knew there weren't enough rooms available.
   The jury, which began hearing the case Aug. 28, found that
Bakker used more than $3.7 million of his followers' money to buy
luxurious homes, fancy cars, jewelry and expensive vacations.
   Those who bought the lodging guarantees, called lifetime
partners, sent him more than $158 million. The partners then were
supposed to be entitled to three nights' lodging each year at the
PTL Ministry's Heritage USA retreat at Fort Mill, S.C.
   Bakker resigned from the PTL on March 19, 1987, amid a sex and
money scandal involving Ms. Hahn.
   During the trial, which lasted nearly six weeks, defense
attorneys called 75 witnesses, including more than 50 who were
loyal Bakker supporters.
   Prosecutors called more than 100 witnesses, including many
lifetime partners who had sent money _ usually $1,000.

   Beneath a cracked steeple, people prayed
and embraced. By a flattened freeway, children played in the
setting sun. As bells tolled, a man stared at the shards of his old
piano.
   It was 5:04 p.m., and Northern California took a minute for
reflection on a minute of fear.
   Exactly one week after the Oct. 17 earthquake, the sound of
church bells filled San Francisco, and James Eimers returned to the
ruins of his Marina district apartment building, the focus of the
Goodyear blimp's network camera as the structure blazed that night.
   ``I came back just to see. I wanted to get in and see what I
could see, to put some kind of closure on the whole experience,''
Eimers said.
   His 1914 Steinway piano was barely discernible in the debris.
Burned were 15 years of genealogical research on his family.
Missing were his cats, Patrick, Nicholas and Lucy.
   ``I'm still pretty numb,'' he said.
   The bells' tolling surprised Nicole Hinton, who was talking with
a friend on steps next door to the city's 200-year-old Mission
Dolores church. At 5:04, they happened to be discussing the quake.
   ``I'm refeeling the fear and terror of not knowing if my brother
and sister-in-law are safe,'' she said. ``The feeling the world's
not safe to walk on.''
   Down the coast in Santa Cruz, Holy Cross Church is closed, a red
tag marking a portal and the steeple cracked by the quake.
   ``We're not going to be saddened. We're going to rebuild, not
out of fear but out of hope,'' Pastor James P. Henry said at an
outdoor service at 5:04.
   Some of the 150 people present embraced, listening to readings
from the Book of Genesis.
   All was quiet in Candlestick Park, where light stands had shook
and concrete had fallen in chunks a week before. At 5:04 Tuesday,
construction workers were patching cracks, getting ready for
Friday's restart of the World Series. They didn't seem to notice
the time of day.
   It was sunset, and light winds wisped through the blue-collar
neighborhood on the west side of sagging Interstate 880 in Oakland.
   Children played and giggled, regardless of the road's looming
wreckage. Stopping his bike, an 8-year-old boy who gave his name
only as Nate told how he'd watched as two men jumped and a truck
fell from the buckling roadway a week earlier.
   At the Charles P. Howard terminal of the Port of Oakland, where
Buck Helm worked before I-880 fell on him, the yellow panel truck
that was his home during the week remained parked where it always
was. The rundown alarm clocks inside weren't ticking at 5:04.
   ``It's about that time, isn't it?'' said Basil Parker, a ship's
clerk like Helm who spent the moment thinking of him and of how
they'd left work around the same time that night.
   ``A train was crossing a set of tracks and he had to stop.
That's when I passed him going up to the freeway,'' said Parker,
who saw the cloud of dust rise behind him from the collapse that
would trap Helm for four days.
   ``I'm going home to celebrate. It's been one week. Momma has
some of that apple juice with bubbles in it like champagne _ yeah,
sparkling cider. I'll have a glass of sparkling cider.''
   At 5:04 on Oct. 17, Elizabeth Patrice Cupples was 1 minute old.
The quake shook the operating room where Marilyn Cupples had just
given birth by Caesarean section. Nurses struggled to keep their
balance and protect mother and baby.
   Precisely a week later, Mrs. Cupples wondered if an aftershock
would mark the moment. As for Elizabeth, she nestled in her
mother's arms, nursing.

<HEAD>Magnitude Raised to 7.1 After Additional Readings Studied</HEAD>

   The magnitude of the deadly earthquake
that pelted Northern California last week was increased from 6.9 to
a 7.1 after seismologists studied additional monitoring charts,
geophysicists said.
   The quake was recorded at 5:04 p.m. PDT on Oct. 17 and was
blamed for the deaths of dozens of people, injuries to thousands
and damage in excess of $7 billion.
   Besides altering the Richter scale reading, the U.S. Geological
Survey altered the epicenter and focal depth.
   ``The revised magnitude was based on more clearly defined data
that was recorded at 18 selected seismic stations all over the
world,'' Waverly Person, director of the USGS National Earthquake
Information Service in Golden, Colo., said in a statement Tuesday.
   ``The original magnitude of 6.9 was based on more localized
seismic readings,'' the statement sid.
   The temblor was the largest quake to occur along the San Andreas
Fault since the 1906 San Francisco quake, Waverly said. That quake
has been estimated at 8.3 on the Richter scale of ground motion,
although monitoring equipment had not been invented at that time.
   Thousands of aftershocks have rattled the Bay Area region in the
week since the main quake.
   The epicenter of the quake was moved one mile northeast but was
still in the Loma Prieta area, said USGS Geophysicist Andrew Pitt.
   Geologically, the most significant change in readings was the
focal depth, originally measured at 12 kilometers but now believed
to have been 18 kilometers, Pitt said.
   ``You measure from the surface down. It started at a depth of 18
kilometers and broke upward horizontally,'' he explained.

   Rather than just write out a check,
volunteers toil every day at the Harrison Street Salvation Army
warehouse, unloading emergency supplies, from toiletries to toys,
donated from across the country.
   For many reasons, they drive to this two-story warehouse in the
city's South-of-Market district to give their sweat and time,
helping people they do not know at a time of great need.
   ``I did it for the feeling that I get,'' says Thomas Kay, 20,
who came from San Mateo on his day off from a Safeway store to help.
   Rodger Christopherson, 60, drove from his home in Bevelry Hills,
300 miles south of San Francisco, to do his part. He worked 12
hours on Sunday, including a supply trip to quake-ravaged
Watsonville.
   Still, the self-employed screenwriter and novelist shrugs off
the long hours. ``I think it's much better to have a first-hand
experience,'' he says.
   A dozen volunteers shuttled about the 10,000-square-foot
warehouse on Monday, sorting boxes and bags filled with sleeping
bags, blankets, clothes, canned food and drinks.
   Stacked along one wall of the damp warehouse are boxes with some
6,800 loaves of bread delivered overnight by the owner of a
Portland, Ore., bakery. Other walls are piled high with 10- to
12-foot stacks of cereal, water, sodas and paper supplies.
   Almost lost amid the supplies that litter the concrete floor is
a single yellow toy truck. The toy is missing some parts, but it
symbolizes the thousands of heartfelt gifts pouring in from all
points.
   The public's generosity is not lost on the volunteers, such as
Paul Potrok, a 26-year-old sailor who came here with several other
crew members of the San Diego-based U.S.S. Schenectady.
   ``With all the problems and stuff, you'd think people would be
pretty tight. But people have been pretty good,'' says Potrok, as
he sorts through a bag of clothes.
   Stories of good deeds are told and retold by volunteers.
   One found a hand-drawn, colored postcard inside a box of donated
goods. Written in crayon, it said in child's printing: ``I hope you
get your house back soon. Angie.''
   And there's the story about the elderly woman who saved her
money for a year to buy a nice down jacket, only to give it to a
volunteer following the quake.
   ``She just said that she had open-heart surgery recently and it
had taken her a year to buy it, and she felt that other people
needed it more,'' recalls Major Gordon Helms, divisional secretary
of the Salvation Army.
   Helms oversees the volunteer organization at the warehouse.
   People have been good, he says. One gentleman stopped his car in
front of the building, jumped out, and dropped off a television
set. Helms accepted a gift of 90,000 pounds of potatoes from Oregon.
   A woman in Kansas City told him Monday she was sending a
shipment of five boxes of toiletries by airplane.
   ``People are just very generous,'' says Helms, wearing a red
sweater over his white Salvation Army uniform. ``They're very
concerned about the needs of other people.''
   He said 1,400 volunteers have pitched in to help at the Harrison
Street warehouse over the past four days.
   ``They've just been fantastic,'' says Helms.
   Christopherson, the screenwriter-volunteer, was asked if he had
any advice f or anyone thinking of volunteers.
   ``I think just to be aware of other people's suffering,'' he
said, ``and do what their conscience tells them.''

   Ann Smith likes to be where the action is
when disaster strikes.
   Bob Lytle's wife wanted him out of her kitchen.
   Both retired, they are reservists for the Federal Emergency
Management Agency who help the agency stretch when the pressure is
on.
   Last month they were helping victims of Hurricane Hugo. Now
they're pulling 12-hours shifts at the Veterans Memorial Building
in Oakland, where FEMA set up its disaster assistance center to
handle applications for grants and low-interest loans.
   Smith, 61, retired in June from the California Department of
Transportation office in Redding, but has been a FEMA reservist for
three years.
   Before she retired, she saved up vacation time to work disasters.
   ``It's an organization that's there quickly and we like to be
part of the action,'' said Smith, who is assistant manager of the
disaster assistance center here.
   Lytle, 78, of Tempe, Ariz., a retired associated professor of
agricultural engineering, has been a reservist 12 years.
   ``My wife said she married for better or worse, but not for
lunch,'' said Lytle. ``She wanted to know, `What are you going to
do to stay out of my kitchen?'''
   Until recently, neither one had been sent to a disaster in more
than a year and a half.
   On Sept. 1, Lytle was sent to Baton Rouge, La., to a flood.
Three weeks later, he was sent to Charleston, S.C., for Hurricane
Hugo. A day at home and he was in Oakland to help open an
earthquake disaster assistance center.
   Smith was packed and ready to go to the Grand Canyon on vacation
with her husband, Larry, another FEMA reservist now working in
Monterey County, when the call came Sept. 24 for Hugo.
   ``We split our clothes into two suitcases and off we went to
Puerto Rico,'' she said.
   Three weeks later, they both were sent to help out with the
quake.
   ``We had a beautiful spring and summer at home,'' she said. ``I
haven't been home at all this fall.''
   Both find getting their laundry done one of the biggest
challenges.
   ``If you go to a Laundromat, that's an hour you could be
sleeping,'' Lytle said.
   Coast-to-coast diasters have stretched FEMA, but it hasn't
snapped yet, said spokesman Bill McAda in Washington.
   ``I sure don't want to see it strained much more, though,''
McAda said. ``Right now I have laying on my desk a request for a
disaster declaration from the state of Kentucky,'' where flood
damages are estimated at $12 million, McAda said. ``We're about to
find out whether we can (meet more demands) or not.''
   The agency has 3,000 people assigned to Hurricane Hugo and the
California earthquake, he said. Of them, only 200 are full-time
FEMA employees. Six hundred are regular reservists who have been
trained in advance and are called up in time of need. The remaining
2,200 are hired locally and get one day of training before being
thrown in the breach.
   Hurricane damage has accounted for 350,000 disaster aid
applications from Puerto Rico, 8,000 from the Virgin Islands,
51,000 from South Carolina and 2,800 from North Carolina, McAda
said.
   A week after the earthquake struck California's Bay area, 10,000
applications have come in from the 12 disaster centers in seven
counties, said FEMA spokeswoman Rhoda Brooks.
   More than 400 people of various specialties from the Army Corps
of Engineers have been dispatched from around the country to verify
disaster claims before FEMA signs checks.
   The total number of applications from Hugo and the earthquake
alone amount to more than three years' worth under normal
ccircumstances, McAda said.
   ``I don't think our people would ever admit they have reached
their limit. Somewhere down the line you will run out of manpower,
but I don't know where that is,'' he said.
   ``Do you put together an agency that is big enough to handle the
current situation, then sit around and do nothing for a year?
That's not very effecive.''
   Instead, FEMA lets people like Smith and Lytle do the sitting
around.
   ``I just sit at home and rock slowly 'til they call me,'' Lytle
said.

   Timothy Busfield, who has gained fame as
an actor in ABC-TV's ``thirtysomething,'' says a little applause is
needed for the most important people in theater _ producers.
   ``The producer is the least egotistical person,'' Busfield said
during a weekend appearance at the Tennessee Arts Commission
Governor's Conference on the Arts.
   ``And if he is effective, he gets artistic performances out of
everybody. You need to find good producers to spread good producers
across the state.''
   Next in line are writers, directors and designers, said
Busfield, who holds a theater degree from East Tennessee State
University and conducts summer workshops for young people at the
school.
   ``The actor is the lowest one on the totem pole, and the most
recognized, sometimes unrightfully so,'' Busfield said.
   Busfield, 32, has worked as a producer, writer and director for
the Fantasy Theater, California's 4-year-old state theater for
children. On ``thirtysomething,'' he plays Elliot Weston, a yuppie
that Busfield has said ``doesn't want to grow up.''

   Bruce Willis says he's not nostalgic for his
wild and crazy bachelor days.
   ``I like what (mythologist) Joseph Campbell says about
marriage,'' the actor said in an interview in Fame magazine's
November issue. ``He says that it's nothing more than a symbol for
the sacrifice of the ego and of the individual towards something
larger, which is the union that is made from two individual egos.''
   The 34-year-old Willis, who is married to actress Demi Moore and
the father of their young daughter, Rumer Glenn, said he hasn't
lost anything.
   ``And I've gained a hundredfold,'' he said. ``My little child is

   Author Kurt Vonnegut made a surprise visit to the
City News Bureau of Chicago, where he was a cub reporter more than
40 years ago.
   ``It was delightful talking to him,'' said managing editor Paul
Zimbrakos, who started working at the bureau in 1958, after
Vonnegut's time.
   City News is wire service owned by Chicago's major daily
newspapers and serves as a training ground for young journalists.
   He said Vonnegut was impressed with the bureau's new look since
the days when he worked there as a reporter in 1947.
   ``His first question was, `Where are the tubes?''' Zimbrakos
said, referring to the pneumatic tubes that City News once used to
transmit stories to clients.
   Vonnegut stopped at the bureau's office Monday while on a
business trip. The 66-year-old author's novels include
``Slaughterhouse Five'' and ``Cats Cradle.''

   Opera star Luciano Pavarotti kept singing and
singing and singing _ for a half-hour worth of encores at a
sold-out fund-raising concert for the Montreal Symphony Orchestra.
   Among Sunday's appreciative audience was former prime minister
Pierre Trudeau, who received birthday greetings at an after-concert
dinner and dance.
   Trudeau, who turned 70 last week, said the concert was
``beautiful.''
   ``It was very generous of Pavarotti to give as many encores as
he did,'' Trudeau said.
   Serge Savard, general manager of the Montreal Canadiens hockey
team, said he enjoyed the concert even though he never goes to the
opera. He compared the 54-year-old Pavarotti to hockey's Great One.
   ``I guess you could say that Pavarotti is the Wayne Gretzky of
opera,'' Savard said.
   The recital was expected to raise about $700,000 for the
orchestra. Fans paid up to $1,500 for tickets.

   A kinder, gentler Morton Downey Jr.? So says
CNBC officials who are starting a half-hour weeknight series
featuring Downey called ``Showdown.''
   The 55-year-old Downey, whose syndicated talk show was canceled
last summer after losing sponsors and declining ratings, will
regularly debate social and consumer issues with Daily News
columnist Richard G. Carter before a studio audience.
   Other guests also will join the debates. CNBC said Monday,
however, that the show won't resemble the loud, boisterous, often
insult-filled series that gained Downey national attention. CNBC
president Michael Eskridge said the new series ``will not be `The
Morton Downey Jr. Show' revisited.''
   CNBC is an NBC-owned cable service. ``Showdown'' premieres Dec.
4.

   Coffins were jostled and tombstones
were toppled by the hundreds in graveyards when the earth groaned
during last week's 7.1-magnitude earthquake.
   The Virgin Mary and other religious icons, sentinals over a
century-old graveyard near midtown here, tumbled to the ground and
cemetery managers called off all burials until repairs can be made.
   ``Some of the marble monuments are shattered and they will be
very difficult to repair. The granite ones we can stand up again,
though,'' said Everett Dias, manager for the five Santa Cruz
County-operated cemeteries.
   The five cemeteries _ Valley Catholic, Valley, Pioneer,
Watsonville Catholic and Day Valley _ hold 20,000 bodies dating to
1860.
   Hardest hit was Valley Catholic Cemetery on Freedom Boulevard. A
huge pepper tree is the centerpiece of the two-acre garden of
marble and granite where most graves bear the inscription: ``Rest
in Peace.''
   ``We suffered extensive damage to the upright stones in four
cemeteries,'' said Dias. Valley Cemetery was spared damage because
only flat markers are allowed.
   Dias said the cemeteries had received dozens of telephone calls
from concerned relatives. Graveyard officials assured them repairs
would be swift.
   Dias said cemetery workers were trying to clear away debris and
repair damage. On a cold and rainy Tuesday one week after the
disaster, there were no visitors in the cemetery.
   ``At this time we are holding off on burials to the end of the
week,'' he said. ``We have holding vaults for them now.''
   He estimated up to 500 markers were toppled in the quake that
killed dozens, injured thousands and caused more than $7 billion in
damage to Northern California.
   The aged Valley Catholic Cemetery was littered with fractured
madonnas and Jesus statues. The face of a 3-foot-tall marble Mary
Magdalen was buried in the grass. Ornate marble crosses were
shattered to bits.
   Many concrete-covered gravesites were cracked. In some cases,
there had been cave-ins.
   Well-manicured lawns surrounded family plots where concrete and
plastic flowers were bleached by the sun and upended by the quake.
   The four-space Stolieh family crypt is only half full. The two
empty crypts have shattered granite doors.
   An ornate, 10-foot-tall marble marker honoring Josephine M.
Dail, who died Jan. 31, 1888, toppled. The tombstone of Cary
Freirmuth, who died in 1929, was upside down and in the mud.
   The marble cross over Thereza Gonzalves' grave was shattered. It
had withstood the 1906 San Francisco quake. She died Oct. 13, 1885.
   Patrick Mahoney died April 19, 1874. His marble marker was also
destroyed.

<TEXT>
   In 1956, the Soviet Union sent tanks and
soldiers into Budapest to crush an anti-communist revolt. Now, with
Hungary declaring itself a democracy and Moscow coping with its own
internal turmoil, the Kremlin is deafeningly quiet.
   With Poland and East Germany also absorbed in their own
turbulent politics, it has been left to Hungary's orthodox
neighbors, Czechoslovakia and Romania, to sound the communist alarm
about the historic events in Budapest.
   Their concern is compounded by worries about the reaction of
their own large ethnic Hungarian minorities, who were able to
follow commemorations of the 1956 Hungarian uprising on live
Hungarian television broadcasts Monday.
   A ``political coup d'etat,'' thundered the Communist Party daily
Pravda in Slovakia on Monday, commenting on a historic
parliamentary session in Budapest that rewrote the Hungarian
constitution to embrace democracy and pave the way for free
elections next year.
   Romania so far has been silent about that session and Monday's
rallies, in which more than 100,000 Hungarians cheered the
proclamation of a democratic republic on the 33rd anniversary of
their popular uprising.
   But President Nicolae Ceausescu of Romania, perhaps the
staunchest communist ideologue in the East bloc, last week
denounced Hungary's path. He pledged Romania would never follow the
same course toward a free market.
   At odds with Budapest for years over charges that Romania is
harassing its 1.7 million ethnic Hungarians, Ceausescu is bound to
be further unsettled by the strident demands for democracy voiced
in Budapest on Monday.
   A unique race in central Europe, with no linguistic bonds to
neighboring Slavs and Germans, Hungarians have a tradition of
maneuvering for the maximum freedom despite dominance by stronger
neighbors.
   This history has also made them fiercely nationalistic, a pride
that has not died in the extensive former Hungarian territories now
incorporated in Czechoslovakia, Romania and Yugoslavia.
   Ceausescu's tough rule has so far kept ethnic Hungarian
yearnings for more freedom from combining with widespread
discontent at food and fuel shortages to ignite major outbreaks of
unrest such as that which occurred in the Transylvanian city of
Brasov in November 1987, when 10,000 angry workers took to the
streets in protest.
   While Czechoslovakia and Romania bristle, the Soviet Union turns
the other cheek. Moscow's reticence toward the dramatic changes in
Hungary confirm that President Mikhail Gorbachev, plagued by
strikes and ethnic unrest at home, is sticking to his policy of
non-interference in eastern Europe.
   Referring to Hungary's ruling Communist Party's decision to
disband and form a Socialist Party that espouses democratic ideals,
Soviet East European expert Oleg Bogomolov wrote in the Oct. 15
edition of the weekly Moscow News, ``Obviously, difficulties lie
ahead. As it appears, the new party will be sailing in stormy and
hazardous waters.''
   Bogomolov is credited with helping forge the new Soviet attitude
toward its allies. In his commentary, he insisted on only one
point: that Hungarians ``mustn't question the existence of the
Warsaw Pact and their contacts'' within the Soviet trading bloc.
   Similar assurances from Solidarity labor leader Lech Walesa in
Poland helped lead to the August nomination of non-communist Prime
Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki.
   Hungary's reform-minded leaders hope to stave off the resounding
defeat suffered by the Polish Communists in June elections,
adopting a program of radical economic and political change in an
effort to win popular support.
   However, the pace of change in Hungary is so swift that opinion
polls indicate its current leaders will at best be only partners in
a coalition government after elections.
   The Soviets, and the rest of eastern Europe, will then have to
deal with the implications of another ouster of communism through
the ballot box.

<HEAD>Baker Calls for Sharp Reductions in First-Strike Nuclear Weapons</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Diplomatic Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Reducing first-strike nuclear weapons is the
top goal set by Secretary of State James A. Baker III for U.S. and
Soviet negotiators trying to complete a new arms reduction treaty.
   Baker singled out the deadliest missiles in superpower arsenals,
capable of devastating an enemy in a surprise attack, during a
speech Monday in San Francisco. He also urged the Soviets to join
in a strategy shift to defense.
   ``We want to see Soviet defensive military operations made
habitual,'' Baker said in his first in-depth description of the
Bush administration's goals for negotiations under way in Geneva to
cut strategic weapons _ bombers, missiles and nuclear submarines _
on both sides.
   He said the United States would explore ``a cooperative and
stable transition to a greater reliance on stability-enhancing,
cost-effective strategic defense.''
   Baker's emphasis on reducing first-strike weapons, such as
Soviet SS-18 intercontinental ballistic missiles, signals a subtle
shift from the Reagan administration's stress on across-the-board
strategic cuts.
   Baker made no reference to the 30 percent to 50 percent cutback
U.S. negotiators have been aiming for in the Strategic Arms
Reduction Talks. Some analysts, such as former Secretary of State
Henry A. Kissinger, have urged greater emphasis on slashing
first-strike weapons such as the Soviet SS-18s.
   Designed to destroy an adversary's ballistic missiles in their
silos, first-strike nuclear weapons have a potential of wreaking
havoc on the other side's nuclear forces.
   Former President Reagan responded to a perceived Soviet threat
by beginning a defensive program, known popularly as Star Wars,
designed to destroy Soviet ballistic missiles in space before they
could destroy their targets.
   Baker, in his speech, encouraged the Soviets to concentrate
their efforts on defense as well, while the Bush administration
pursues the Strategic Defense Initiative.
   He said the U.S. goal in the Geneva talks was ``a new
relationship in which the capabilities and incentives to attack
first are minimized and the possibilities of strategic defense are
pursued.''
   He said the Bush administration had tailored its proposals in
Geneva to emphasize the relative merits of slow-flying weapons,
such as cruise missiles and bombers that are not suitable for a
first strike.
   At the same time, Baker urged a skeptical Congress to approve a
White House request for $100 million to produce mobile Midgetman
missiles. Otherwise, he said, the Soviets could exploit differences
between Capitol Hill and the Bush administration.
   The House eliminated the request from the $305 billion defense
authorization bill, but the Senate gave its approval for the funds.
A congressional conference committee is trying to reconcile this
and other differences.
   ``Congress needs now to support START, not undercut it, by
funding this program,'' Baker said.
   Baker had planned to speak to the private Commonwealth Club on
arms control last Thursday, but the speech was postponed because of
the San Francisco Bay area earthquake.

<HEAD>Report Says DOE Downplayed Key Problems at Rocky Flats Arms Plant</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Energy Department underestimated or
ignored health and safety problems at the Rocky Flats nuclear arms
plant as it gave the operator millions of dollars in bonus fees,
federal auditors said today.
   A report by the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm
of Congress, said in the fiscal years 1986-88, Rockwell
International Corp. won $26.8 million in award fees for running the
plant, which has been under FBI investigation for alleged criminal
violation of environmental laws since June.
   ``We believe that the seriousness of the (environmental, safety
and health) problems ... were never conveyed in the evaluations''
of the plant's performance, the report concluded.
   Rockwell announced last month that it was withdrawing from the
plant, and the Energy Department said Oct. 11 that EG&amp;G Inc. had
agreed to take over Jan. 1.
   The plant makes plutonium triggers for nuclear warheads and is
owned by the government.
   The GAO report was being released today during a House
Government Operations subcommittee hearing on Energy Department
problems with the private companies that run major nuclear weapons
facilities in 12 states under government contracts.
   Many of the contracts, including that at Rocky Flats, reimburse
the company for all operating costs and allow bonus fees based on
performance in key areas, including production of arms materials
and compliance with health and safety rules. The fees are set
during semiannual performance evaluations.
   Rep. Mike Synar, D-Okla., chairman of the subcommittee, said
Monday that the terms of the Rockwell contract made it difficult
for the Energy Department to effectively manage the plant about 16
miles from downtown Denver.
   Synar said the Rocky Flats problem was typical of management
weaknesses throughout the nuclear weapons manufacturing complex,
which includes 17 major plants.
   ``The department effectively has left itself no way to control
the performance of its contractors or to hold them fully
accountable for their actions,'' Synar said.
   The GAO said the $26.8 million in bonus fees for Rockwell during
the 1986-88 period represented 84 percent of the total awards
possible under its contract.
   In this period, the Energy Department's operations office in
Albuquerque, N.M., rated Rockwell's health and safety performance
as ``moderately good'' to ``excellent.''
   The report said that while Rockwell rightly was applauded for
holding down the number of work days lost due to injury, fire loss
and property losses, some of its shortcomings in the health and
safety area were underestimated or ignored.
   Among the problems downplayed by the Energy Department,
according to the GAO report, were an inadequate health physics
program, repeated violations of environmental regulations and the
``questionable quality'' of the monitoring data used to comply with
environmental laws.
   Under the Energy Department award fee system, Rockwell was
encouraged to increase production at Building 771, the main
plutonium processing center, despite safety problems there.
   About two months before Building 771 was shut down due to safety
problems in October 1988, the Energy Department awarded Rockwell
$310,000 for increased plutonium production, the report said. The
building resumed production in January.
   The GAO noted that Energy Secretary James D. Watkins has
substantially changed the terms of management contracts at some
weapons facilities since he took office in March, and that further
adjustments were planned.

<HEAD>Kemp Advocates More Influence Over Fed</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Housing Secretary Jack Kemp says elected
administration officials should have more influence over interest
rate policies set by the Federal Reserve Board.
   Kemp, a longtime critic of the nation's independent central
bank, told the annual convention of the Mortgage Bankers
Association of America that he favors putting the treasury
secretary on the Fed board and forcing it to announce its monetary
policy decisions immediately.
   ``I believe sunlight on the Fed's operations is called for. I
also believe the Fed could use some input from the democratically
elected executive branch,'' Kemp said Monday.
   He endorsed legislation sponsored by Reps. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind.,
chairman of the Joint Economic Committee, and Byron Dorgan, D-N.D.,
that would require the Fed to release the decisions of its
policymaking Federal Open Market Committee immediately rather than
waiting for six weeks, the current practice.
   Originally, Hamilton and Dorgan wanted to place the treasury
secretary on the open market committee, which meets eight times a
year to set interest rate and monetary policy.
   However, Hamilton has said he will modify the bill to instead
require two meetings a year between the open market committee and
senior administration officials.
   The Fed, an independent body whose members are appointed by the
president but can't be removed by him during their 14-year terms,
has long been the target of critics who allege it favors high
interest rates to fight inflation at the expense of jobs and
economic growth.
   ``Interest rates are too high either by long- or short-term
historical perspectives,'' Kemp said. ``I believe the best thing
the Fed can do for the economy is to allow it to grow at a healthy
rate by keeping interest rates down.''
   Kemp's comments follow statements in recent months from
President Bush and his budget director, Richard Darman, both of
whom have pushed for lower interest rates.
   A housing secretary usually would not comment on monetary
policy, leaving that to either the treasury secretary or the
president's chief economic adviser.
   Kemp, however, is a former Republican member of Congress from
New York and candidate for the GOP presidential nomination who has
a longstanding interest in the subject and has frequently
criticized the central bank.
   The Hamilton-Dorgan bill is one of two measures that will
receive a hearing Wednesday before the House Banking subcommittee
on domestic monetary policy. The other, sponsored by Rep. Stephen
Neal, D-N.C., is a resolution exhorting the Fed to set a target of
reaching non-inflationary economic growth within five years.
   Neal's resolution is supported by Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan,
who is scheduled to testify at the hearing.

<HEAD>Former HUD Official Says He Did Nothing Wrong in Advising Bush Campaign</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former top housing official says he did
nothing improper in providing campaign debate advice to George Bush
last year while administering a program now at the center of the
HUD scandal.
   Former assistant housing secretary Thomas T. Demery provided
debating points on housing, using documents from computer files in
his office at the Department of Housing and Urban Development,
according to Demery and documents released by the department Monday
under the Freedom of Information Act.
   Demery's contact with the Bush campaign was Republican
consultant Paul Manafort, who has admitted to Congress that he
practiced ``influence-peddling'' at HUD.
   Manafort is a partner in a disputed New Jersey housing
development that received more than $31 million in federal
subsidies. He has acknowledged to congressional investigators that
he lobbied HUD on more than 20 other projects.
   Demery, in an interview, said he did not believe Bush used the
debate material.
   In other documents, Demery said he delivered campaign speeches
for Bush, sometimes while traveling on HUD business.
   Demery administered the department's Section 8 Moderate
Rehabilitation program, which provided lucrative subsidy grants
sought by developers, including Manafort and Manafort's clients.
   Alleged abuses of the moderate rehabilitation program, including
the steering of lucrative subsidy grants to politically favored
developers, triggered further investigations of HUD programs by
congressional committees, and the Justice Department says it is
investigating HUD activities across the nation.
   In the interview, Demery acknowledged providing tips for Bush's
debates with Democrat Michael Dukakis. He contended there was
nothing improper about providing political advice while working at
HUD because he was a presidential appointee, named by President
Reagan.
   In one document, he said that Dukakis, the governor of
Massachusetts, ``has presided over de facto segregation'' in Boston
public housing and said the city ``still contains some of the last
vestiges of segregation in America today.''
   Demery was sharply criticized in a HUD audit report issued by
inspector general Paul Adams last May. The audit charged favoritism
in the awarding of moderate rehabilitation grants and questioned
his efforts to raise money from developers and others dealing with
HUD for a favored charity, FOOD for Africa.
   Demery contends others made the subsidy decisions and that his
activities for the charity were proper.
   Demery's files contained letters he wrote to Adams last year
defending his actions and questioning the investigation.
   He wrote one letter to FBI Director William Sessions complaining
about the inspector general's investigation, but he said Monday he
never mailed it. Demery's letter charged that his mail had been
intercepted and the documents involving his personal finances
eventually were obtained by the inspector general.
   Other documents show that Demery complained to then-Secretary
Samuel Pierce about the activities of Hunter Cushing, then deputy
assistant secretary for multi-family housing, and reprimanded
Cushing directly for poor work.
   Demery contends that although Cushing reported to him, Cushing
was engaged in political work and worked with Deborah Gore Dean,
Pierce's former top aide. Dean, Pierce and Cushing have all refused
to testify before congressional investigators, citing their
constitutional rights against self-incrimination.

   Sheriff Simon Leis Jr. started an internal
television system to inform prisoners on such things as the rules
of the Hamilton County Justice Center.
   But the system has given rise to jailhouse entertainers who have
messages for fellow prisoners _ and the sheriff.
   The close-circuit channel, which has operated for about three
weeks, was made available for in-house videos after officials found
out prisoners wanted to sing, dance and recite poetry, said
sheriff's spokesman Frank Weikel.
   Five women inmates, in a performance they call ``Stay Out of
Jail,'' sing, ``We can't keep losing time by doing all kinds of
crime. So make up your mind right now to do it right. Don't you
wanna stay out of jail?''
   Delores Madden, 29, who is charged with receiving stolen
property, said the performers were trying to give a message to
young people. ``This is no place to be,'' she said.
   The five singers apparently also hope the sheriff was paying
attention. They ended their song with a plea: ``Simon Leis, please
hear me. Please release me real soon. We need to stay out of jail.
It's hard to make bail.''

   Ericka and Matthew Howard say their only
regret about their wedding day is they failed to catch the names of
two strangers who returned a few thousand dollars in missing
wedding gifts.
   The Howards, who were married Saturday, were about to leave the
reception about 1 a.m. Sunday when an unknown man and woman drove
up to the reception hall.
   The man asked if a bride named Ericka was in the group and then
handed over all the cards with money the Howards had received as
gifts earlier in the day.
   ``I couldn't believe it,'' Mrs. Howard said Monday. ``I just
about died.''
   The basket containing the cards apparently was left on a car
roof. When the car drove off, the cards blew onto a highway.
   A man collected the cards, which were in a ditch off Wisconsin
37, and brought them back to their rightful owners.
   Mrs. Howard, who along with her husband is 19, said she didn't
get the men's names because she was so rattled.
   ``They just kept saying `it's a miracle and praise be to God'
and that we shouldn't let it bother us and just be happy,'' she
said.

   The billions of dollars that Congress wants to
give California's earthquake victims will be used for a range of
relief and recovery programs, from home-rebuilding loans to mental
health counseling.
   Families whose homes are uninhabitable can seek money to pay for
temporary housing, while special loans are available to small
businesses that need quick capital and local governments can get
aid in repairing public buildings and parks.
   Congress is rushing to approve a $2.85 billion aid package for
the San Francisco Bay area, and members say more money could come
later.
   Shortly after the earthquake struck California a week ago,
President Bush signed a disaster declaration that freed up $273
million for emergency programs, but members of Congress immediately
said a major aid package would be needed. Sen. Alan Cranston,
D-Calif., estimated the damage at $7 billion, but said Monday that
he didn't expect the federal government to pay that much.
   Under some federal programs, the state of California will kick
in 25 percent of the cost. Others are fully funded by the federal
government.
   FEMA, which coordinates recovery programs, provided the
following information about available programs. The amount of money
spent on each program depends on how many applications are received.
   The Department of Transportation gives money for the repair or
reconstruction of highways.

   includes:
   _Temporary housing assistance: Reasonable payments for families
whose homes are uninhabitable. Aid is available for 18 months, with
payments based on prevailing rental rates.
   _Home repairs: Payments to make minor repairs to make housing
usable.
   _Individual and family grants: Up to $10,400 per individual or
family to meet serious disaster needs and expenses not covered by
other federal assistance programs. The federal government pays 75
percent; the state the rest.
   _Disaster unemployment assistance: Benefit payments for up to 26
weeks, based on state benefit rates, for workers who lost their
jobs because of the disaster or others who are not covered by state
compensation.
   _Crisis counseling: The National Institute of Mental Health
provides short-term counseling for mental health problems.
   _Public property: Reimbursable payments to local governments of
at least 75 percent of the eligible costs for the repair and
replacement of damaged public facilities such as roads, bridges,
utilities, buildings and parks.
   _Community disaster loans: The loans are not to exceed 25
percent of the annual operating budget of any local government
which has suffered a substantial loss of tax or other revenue as a

<HEAD>Three Utilities Report Deals With Nuclear Workers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At least three electric utilities admit making
deals with nuclear plant workers that could be seen as rewarding
them for not reporting potential safety problems, government
records show.
   All three companies insisted in letters to the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission that the labor settlements were legal and
proper, but they acknowledged some provisions might be viewed as
``silence-for-money'' deals.
   Duke Power Co. of Charlotte, N.C.; GPU Nuclear Corp. of
Parsippany, N.J.; and Omaha Public Power District of Omaha, Neb.,
disclosed the agreements in response to an NRC inquiry last spring
aimed at determining if such deals are common in the industry.
   Congress has criticized the NRC for failing to explicitly outlaw
such settlements.
   The controversy stemmed from a Senate investigation last spring
of two labor settlements between builders of the Comanche Peak
nuclear power plant in Texas and workers who received payments in
return for keeping quiet about potential safety hazards.
   The Labor Department later ruled that such settlement provisions
were unacceptable, but the NRC commissioners have been unable to
agree how and whether to outlaw them.
   In April, the NRC sent letters to all nuclear utilities and
their contractors asking to be told of any labor settlements that
restricted an employee's ability to report safety information to
the NRC.
   A review Monday of the written responses from the utilities and
contractors showed all denied having any such restrictions.
However, the three companies said they had settlements with
provisions that might be construed by others as limiting a worker's
ability to raise safety concerns.
   Duke Power was the only utility to provide specific information
about a settlement. It said it felt compelled to report the case to
the NRC ``in light of the sensitivity of the issue,'' even though
it believes the settlement was proper.
   The case involves an April 21, 1988, settlement with former
employee Howard Samuel Nunn Jr., who filed a civil suit against
Duke after he was dismissed in October 1983.
   In a passage similar to a provision of the Comanche Peak
settlement, the Duke settlement stipulated that Nunn ``will not
voluntarily appear as a witness'' in any legal or administrative
proceeding involving Duke. It also said he would not ``seek to
induce any government agency'' to take any action against Duke.
   Duke told the NRC these passages were designed to settle the
Nunn suit. The deal ``clearly left Mr. Nunn free ... to bring any
concerns to the NRC ... if he so desired,'' Duke wrote to the
commission.
   Duke said it wrote to Nunn in July saying he is free to bring
any safety matter to the NRC. Duke operates three plants in North
Carolina and South Carolina.
   GPU Nuclear and Omaha Public Power, in separate letters to the
NRC, said that while they found no restrictive clauses in their
labor settlements, the language in four settlement agreements might
be viewed as restricting the individual's ability to raise
potential safety issues with the NRC.
   The utilities provided no details, but said they advised the
people involved to disregard any settlement language that they
thought limited their ability to raise safety issues.
   GPU Nuclear owns the Three Mile Island nuclear station in
Pennsylvania and the Oyster Creek plant in New Jersey. Omaha Public
Power owns the Fort Calhoun nuclear plant in Nebraska.
   Bob Newlin, an NRC spokesman, said Monday the commission wrote
letters to people involved in questionable settlements. A few of
them wrote back to the NRC about safety issues, but Newlin said he
could not provide details.
   Five other companies said that while they saw no problems with
any of their labor settlement deals, they wrote to people involved
in 11 cases to emphasize that they were under no limits in
contacting the NRC about safety issues.
   The five are Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co. of San Francisco,
Houston Lighting and Power Co., Georgia Power Co. of Atlanta,
Carolina Power &amp; Light Co. of Raleigh, N.C., and Bechtel Corp. of
San Francisco.

<HEAD>$5.1 Billion Drained from Savings Accounts in August</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's thrift institutions allowed $5.1
billion to drain from savings accounts in August, a move an analyst
says is a positive sign.
   ``Shrinkage is the order of the day,'' said Bert Ely, a private
thrift analyst in Alexandria, Va. ``It's the only effective way
that marginal S&amp;Ls can meet the higher capital requirements.''
   Thrift legislation, signed Aug. 9 by President Bush, requires
institutions to hold more capital for every loan or other
investment they make.
   If an institution cannot earn enough profits to add to capital
or raise it from outside investors, its only alternative is to
scale back operations before the new standards go into effect Dec.
7.
   Deposit outflows, which don't include interest credited to
savers' accounts, totaled $5.1 billion, compared with an inflow of
$54 million in July. It was the highest level of withdrawals since
$5.3 billion left thrift accounts in April, the Office of Thrift
Supervision reported.
   James Barth, chief economist of the thrift office, said the
deposit outflow, as well as a record $13.4 billion reduction in
assets, largely reflected a deliberate strategy by the industry.
   ``This was the third consecutive month in which thrifts ... shed
assets to adjust to the new regulatory environment,'' Barth said.
   Thrift holdings of mortgages and mortgage-backed securities fell
by $7.8 billion in August, while cash and investment securities
dropped $3 billion.
   The data shows that mortgages originated by thrifts rose to
$16.4 billion in August, up from a six-year low of $13.2 billion in
July. However, the institutions are selling an increasing
proportion of the mortgages to investors and retaining fewer in
their portfolios.
   Savers withdrew a record $10.8 billion from thrifts in January
and net withdrawals have exceeded $1 billion in every month except
July. In the first eight months of the year, $44.5 billion drained
from thrifts. August marked the 15th month of withdrawals in the 16
months beginning in May 1988.
   The earlier outflows were attributed to interest rates, which
were rising through the spring, and to depositor uncertainty about
the S&amp;L bailout.
   With the August report, the thrift office for the first time
began reporting separate statistics for insolvent S&amp;Ls under
government control and the rest of the industry.
   The 264 thrifts taken over by the government by the end of
August, for instance, had net withdrawals of $1.2 billion in
August, compared with an inflow of $187 million in July.
   The 2,657 other thrifts had withdrawals of $3.9 billion, up from
$133 million a month earlier.

<HEAD>Adults Should Eat Less Salt, Research Council Says</HEAD>

   The average American adult can get along on as
little as 500 milligrams of salt a day, far less than the usual
diet contains, the National Research Council says.
   ``Although no optimal range of salt intake has been established,
there is no known advantage in consuming large amounts of sodium
and clear disadvantages for those susceptible to hypertension,''
the council said in an update of its nutritional recommendations.
   The NRC's 10th edition of its Recommended Dietary Allowances,
published today, also says cigarette smokers need at least 100
milligrams of vitamin C per day _ as opposed to 60 milligrams for
adult non-smokers.
   ``Smoking seems to increase metabolic turnover of the vitamin,
leading to lower concentrations in the blood,'' said the NRC.
   The new guidelines also say pregnant women should increase
vitamin C to 70 milligrams a day.
   The new guidelines are the first update of the nutrient
recommendations in nearly 10 years. The RDAs are a major guide for
developing nutrition programs and policies.
   ``There are a lot of little changes, up and down, but not
earthshaking,'' said Michael Jacobson, executive director for the
Center for Science in the Public Interest, a health advocacy group.
   One of the noteworthy changes, he said, is the one on sodium.
   ``This marks the first time this committee or any other official
committee suggested so low a number,'' Jacobson said. ``They are
telling Americans what is optimal, not what's convenient.''
   About 75 percent of the sodium consumed by Americans comes from
processed food. ``A typical serving of canned soup has almost 1,000
milligrams of sodium as flavoring,'' Jacobson said. ``A fast-food
cheeseburger has 1,400 milligrams.''
   He said previous recommendations specified 1,100 to 3,300
milligrams of sodium a day for adults.
   The new recommendations are not daily objectives, but rather
goals to be met over time.
   ``In planning meals or food supplies,'' said the NRC, ``it is
technically difficult and biologically unnecessary to design a
single day's diet that contains all the RDAs for all the
nutrients.''
   RDAs are defined as levels of essential nutrients that are
``adequate to meet the known nutrient needs of practically all
healthy persons.'' People with special nutritional needs are not
covered by the RDAs.
   The recommended allowances are intended to be consumed as part
of a normal diet. The NRC said they ``are neither minimal
requirements nor necessarily optimal levels of intake.''
   RDAs are used in a number of ways by different groups. The
Department of Agriculture, for instance, uses them to evaluate the
adequacy of the U.S. food supply, for setting standards for food
assistance programs and determining the nutritional status of the
U.S. population.
   Most average Americans come in contact most often with the
nutrition information listed on the sides of breakfast cereal
boxes. They are derived from the RDAs.
   The new volume leaves most previous recommendations unchanged or
modified only slightly, but it includes some important changes.
Instead of basing RDAS for adults on arbitrary heights and weights,
allowances now are based on actual heights and weights in the
population.
   The RDA for vitamin B12, an essential nutrient for maintaining
normal metabolism and function of the blood-forming organs, was
reduced from 3 micrograms for men and women to 2 micrograms.
   The new edition lists recommended allowances for protein, 11
vitamins and 7 minerals. It points out that besides known
nutrients, food contains thousands of other naturally occurring
substances of nutritional value.
   ``A varied diet meeting RDAs,'' said the subcommittee of the
Food and Nutrition Board of the NRC, ``will probably be adequate in
all other nutrients.''

<HEAD>Frank Hires Lawyer for Sex Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DIAMOND</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The lawyer who will represent Rep. Barney
Frank before the House ethics committee says the Massachusetts
Democrat will defend himself against false allegations.
   ``He's chastened by the events that are true, but he's damned if
he's going to run from allegations that are garbage,'' Stephen
Sachs said in an interview Monday.
   ``Barney's been forthcoming about this publicly. He is equally
certain that there has been a substantial amount of untruth
peddled, or attempted to be peddled, in the public press.''
   Sachs, a former U.S. attorney in Baltimore and former Maryland
attorney general, said he would be ready by early next week to
present a detailed case that will debunk some of the sex-related
charges leveled against the five-term lawmaker.
   Sachs' hiring was the latest move by Frank indicating a renewed
feistiness after several weeks in which friends said he was
emotionally down about his prospects.
   Frank took to the House floor last week for the first time since
the allegations about his relations with a male prostitute became
public in August. He has maintained a full schedule in his home
district and has begun a legal defense fund set up by political
aides.
   Doug Cahn, a spokesman for Frank's congressional office,
declined to disclose how much had been contributed to the fund,
saying the first public report on the account is due at year's end.
   A leading liberal in Congress, Frank has admitted paying Stephen
Gobie $80 for sex in 1985 and subsequently hiring him with personal
funds to serve as a housekeeper and driver from July 1985 through
August 1987.
   Frank had acknowledged he is homosexual well before the recent
publicity.
   Gobie has leveled various charges against Frank that the
congressman has denied. Among those are that Frank knew Gobie was
running a prostitution ring from Frank's Capitol Hill apartment and
that Gobie and Frank engaged in sexual activity at the House
gymnasium.
   The House ethics committee investigating the Frank case plans to
conclude its deliberations by the end of the year, Sachs said,
basing his statement on two meetings with the committee's legal
counsel and one with the minority counsel.
   ``They want very much to act promptly and want to conclude the
matter this year,'' Sachs said.
   Members of Frank's staff said they expect the case to come up at
least in a preliminary form at a committee meeting later this week.
A spokesman for the ethics committee said the panel's schedule for
this week had not been set by Monday and that committee proceedings
and the agenda are kept confidential.
   Sachs has prosecuted several members of Congress and recently
gained attention for his defense of Dr. Elizabeth Morgan, who spent
two years in jail after being cited for contempt of court for
refusing to allow her daughter to visit the child's father.

<HEAD>Farmers Still Waiting for Disaster Relief Checks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER DIXON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Most farmers who planted a second crop after
freezing weather and drought destroyed their winter wheat or cotton
are still waiting for disaster relief checks from the Agriculture
Department, says Sen. Phil Gramm.
   ``For people who are waiting for their checks, this is getting
to be a problem and I'm eager to do something,'' said Gramm,
R-Texas.
   Gramm and other Great Plains lawmakers contend USDA's
regulations implementing an $895 million drought relief bill
unfairly cut payments to farmers who planted a second crop.
   USDA officials said Monday that farmers who rotated their
traditional spring crop to land where winter wheat was destroyed by
drought or freezing weather are entitled to disaster payments.
   ``It doesn't solve the problem most people have with their
second crop,'' Gramm said.
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, called the decision by the
Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service good news, but
agreed it doesn't go far enough in reversing USDA regulations that
would cut disaster assistance to many other farmers who had also
planted a second crop.
   A Senate aide said the USDA's decision Monday apparently applies
only to winter wheat farmers who would traditionally plant a second
crop, such as milo, on non-wheat acres in the spring.
   Those farmers who planted their second crop on the wheat acres
instead, to take advantage of fertilizer already on the land, won't
see their disaster checks cut, the aide said.
   The decision doesn't cover hundreds of cotton farmers who also
planted a second crop, or farmers who planted non-traditional
second crops on their wheat acreage or in addition to their wheat
acreage, officials said.
   Legislators and USDA have been wrangling over the regulations on
``ghost acres'' for two months, and one Senate aide said the
decision came because ``we had to force their hand on this.''
   Bentsen said farmers from Texas, Kansas, Oklahoma and elsewhere
on the Great Plains planted milo or cotton on their failed wheat
acres this year, but were told by ASCS that their disaster checks
would be reduced if they instead planted their spring cotton or
milo crops on the winter wheat land.
   ``Had they planted the spring crop normally, without rotating it
to the failed wheat acres, there would be no reduction in the
disaster checks,'' Bentsen said. ``It is obviously unfair to
penalize farmers when they are following normal farming practices
by simply rotating their crops on the farm.''

   The chairman of the House Agriculture
Committee says he'll talk with Agriculture Secretary Clayton
Yeutter and Mexican Agriculture Secretary Jorge de la Vega on
Wednesday about Mexico's refusal to accept livestock from privately
operated inspection centers.
   Rep. Kika de la Garza, D-Texas, and Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas
raised their concerns about the bottlenecks at Texas centers with
Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari during his recent state
visit to Washington.
   The Mexican government will accept only livestock that has been
inspected at one of five Texas state operated facilities along the
border, though 23 privately run pens are available.
   Gramm said the state facilities operate only during normal
business hours, while slaughter livestock are typically shipped
through commercial facilities at any time of night or day.
   ``My people don't want to be forced to deal with the government
when private pens are available,'' Gramm said Monday.
   ``We have sent clear signals to the Mexican Embassy that there
is going to be congressional action'' unless they can ``come back
and deal with what they perceive to be a small problem,'' Gramm
said.
   Steve Poore, a spokesman for USDA's Animal and Plant Health
Inspection Service, said the five pens in Texas are the only
shipment facilities on the 2,000-mile border formally approved by
Mexico, although a few animals may have been shipped unofficially
at other points.
   The agency has suggested that Mexico consider approving about 30
other pens in California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas.
   ``Mexico is going to inspect the pens we have suggested and
decide which ones to approve,'' he said.
   Janna Evans, another agency spokeswoman, said Mexico may make a
decision within a week to 10 days.

<HEAD>FDA Orders Chinese Mushrooms Detained at Ports</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KAREN BALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration is halting
the shipment of all Chinese mushrooms into the United States,
citing a bacteria contamination that can cause severe food
poisoning.
   The order extends a ban issued in May.
   ``Very little got into the marketplace,'' FDA spokesman Emil
Corwin said Monday after the agency ordered all mushrooms detained
at U.S. ports.
   Most of the known contamination involved 68-ounce,
institutional-size cans banned in May when the FDA ordered the cans
detained at ports after food poisoning outbreaks in New York,
Mississippi and Pennsylvania.
   The February and April food-poison outbreaks caused 100
illnesses and sent at least 16 people to hospitals. The illnesses
were linked to Chinese mushrooms used by two restaurants, a
hospital and on a college campus. Recalls began in March.
   The agency said Monday that it had identified the contamination,
staphyloccocal enterotoxin, in 5.5-ounce and 16-ounce cans of
mushrooms produced by 10 plants in China.
   All of those products have been recalled or are being recalled,
the FDA said.
   In an Oct. 13 letter to the Chinese government, the agency
warned that the restrictions would remain until manufacturing
changes are made.
   Corwin said the Chinese mushrooms don't carry brand names when
they are sent to the United States and are used mostly by food
processing plants. Some importers may add their own brand names on
cans sold to groceries.
   Chinese mushrooms account for half of the nation's imported
mushrooms, Corwin said. However, Richard Sullivan, executive vice
president of the Association of Food Industries, said that since
the FDA's May restrictions, Chinese imports have dropped to 8
percent of the market.
   Enterotoxin produced by staphyloccocus aureus bacteria can
survive the high temperatures used during canning, the FDA said.
   Symptoms of staphyloccocal enterotoxin food poisoning, such as
nausea, vomiting and abdominal cramping, can develop rapidly after
eating a contaminated product. Most victims recover in two to three
days.
   The FDA said the following code numbers appear on cans affected:
   _On 68-ounce cans: TM, T3, T17, M2, B2, LT, Q15 and R12.
   _On 16-ounce cans: T1 or T17.
   _On 5.5-ounce cans: Q1.

<HEAD>Bush Signs Interior Bill Banning Obscene Art</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal funds may not be used for material
judged to be obscene by two government agencies, under a bill
signed by President Bush.
   The bill became the focal point of dispute in Congress because
of protests over the use of taxpayer money to display Robert
Mapplethorpe's photographs with homosexual subjects and Andres
Serrano's photo of a crucifix in a jar of urine.
   The measure, signed Monday, stipulates that federal funds may
not be used for materials judged to be obscene by the National
Endowment of the Arts and the National Endowment of the Humanities.
   The $11.4 billion Interior Department spending bill for fiscal
1990 also bars oil and gas drilling in 84 million acres off the
shores of California, Alaska, the Gulf of Mexico near Florida's
Everglades and the East Coast.
   Bush expressed reservations about extending for another year the
moratorium on oil and gas leasing and exploration on the Outer
Continental Shelf. However, he said the overall benefits of the
bill outweighed his concerns.
   Rep. Ralph S. Regula, R-Ohio, the ranking Republican on the
House Appropriations subcommittee on the interior, praised the
action on obscene art and said he shared Bush's reservation on the
restrictions on offshore drilling.
   ``We're up to about 50 percent plus imported oil now to meet our
needs. I'm not for drilling every square foot. There's fragile
areas off of Florida and California we should protect. ... But
there are other areas that logically should be drilled and are
still included in the moratoria for aesthetic reasons.''
   The moratorium means ``we can't look at these 84 million acres
even in the event of a national (energy) emergency,'' he said.

<HEAD>Thousands Of Federal Employees Arrested In Crackdown On Corruption</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Since President Carlos Salinas de Gortari
took office, special agents have arrested more than 6,000 federal
employees on charges ranging from extortion to embezzlement and tax
evasion, a top law enforcement official says.
   Hector Castaneda Jimenez, chief prosecutor at the Attorney
General's Office, said Monday that an estimated $82.8 million in
government property and unpaid taxes have been recovered in the
11-month campaign to root out official corruption.
   As part of the campaign, Castaneda's office will issue warrants
during the next six months for the arrest of another 10,000 federal
employees suspected of illegally gaining an estimated $376.8
million, the prosecutor was quoted as saying by the independent
news service Excelsior.
   ``It is a difficult job, but not impossible,'' Castaneda said,
and federal agents hope to recover at least half that amount. ``The
rest will probably not be recoverable either because the status of
limitations expired or because many prefer to spend additional time
in jail rather than return the money.''
   Salinas took office Dec. 1 for a six-year term.

<HEAD>State Department Welcomes Arab Plan For Lebanon</HEAD>

   The Bush administration is hailing a peace
plan approved by Lebanon's Parliament but rejected by a Christian
leader and the two main militias of the Shiite Moslem sect.
   President Bush ``congratulates the Lebanese deputies for their
courage and statesmanship, which have yielded an extraordinary
opportunity to bring lasting peace in Lebanon,'' White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Monday.
   ``This is the first step toward restoration of a sovereign,
unified, and independent Lebanon, free of all foreign forces,'' he
said.
   Gen. Michel Aoun put his Christian forces on alert after
complaining that the plan didn't provide a timetable for the
withdrawal of the 40,000 Syrian troops from Lebanon.
   ``What the deputies approved in Taif is a crime I will not
accept,'' he said of the accord, approved Sunday by a special
parliamentary session in the Saudi Arabian city.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret D. Tutwiler said the
United States ``warmly welcomes'' the accord. However, she said
there had been no change in U.S. policy calling for the withdrawal
of Syrian troops that control a vast portion of Lebanon, and
Israeli forces that hold a security belt in the South.
   The pro-Syrian mainstream Shiite Amal militia and the
pro-Iranian fundamentalist Hezbollah, or Party of God, which is
believed to be holding eight American hostages, rejected the accord
because they want a bigger representation in a new parliament.
   Apart from the troops issue, U.S. policy has called for a larger
role for Moslems in running Lebanon's government. Power is split
fairly evenly between Christians and Moslems.

   Explosions rocked a Phillips Petroleum
Co. plastics plant Monday, hurling chunks of metal and other debris
miles away and creating a fireball visible for 15 miles. At least
one worker died, more than 100 were injured and 23 were unaccounted
for, authorities said.
   Emergency crews were not likely to enter the plant before
daybreak because of the fire and intense heat, said Phillips
Petroleum President Glenn Cox. The fire was still burning late
Monday night.
   ``We're betting there's a lot of fatalities, just because of the
nature of the explosion and where it happened,'' said Dr. Paul
Pepe, the director of Houston emergency medical services. ``We
don't think there's anybody alive in there.''
   Twenty Phillips employees and at least three contract workers
were unaccounted for, Cox said. He said 109 workers were taken to
hospitals, and more than 33 were admitted and up to six were in
serious to critical condition.
   ``We know these people, we pray for their safety. It's a
difficult time for all of us,'' said Cox.
   At least 10 others were treated for injuries, hospital figures
showed. Officials had said the injured were being treated for
burns, breathing problems and cuts from flying debris.
   The blasts buckled a ceiling and blew out cafeteria windows at
an elementary school about a mile away. None of the more than 700
pupils was injured and they were all sent home, a school employee
said.
   At the plant, leaking gas and broken water lines hampered
firefighters, said Phillips environmental director Bill Stoltz, who
was at the scene. Firefighters pumped water from a sewage treatment
plant and the nearby Houston Ship Channel to fight the blaze.
   Several fires were visible beneath columns of dense smoke in the
plant complex and patches of grass smoldered outside.
   The fire was brought under control about 6 p.m., five hours
after it erupted, but was expected to take several more hours to
extinguish, said Fire Chief Jay Goyer. It was still burning at 11
p.m.
   Kelly Manerly, a pipefitter at the plant, said he heard hissing
for about five minutes, then saw a white cloud.
   ``I told a safety man I saw nothing but gas. Then it exploded. I
ran. There were a lot of people running and screaming to get out.
It's like nothing I've felt in my life,'' Manerly said.
   ``I'm real lucky. Thank God for that,'' he said.
   Maintenance worker Roby Clemons said a warning message was
broadcast over the plant's emergency radio 20 seconds before the
explosion.
   ``I never saw people run so fast,'' said Clemons.
   Stoltz said the explosion was caused when a seal blew out on an
ethylene loop reactor, releasing ethylene-isobutane, a compound
used in making plastics. The plant manufactures plastics like those
used in milk jugs and toys.
   The chemical compound is flammable and explosive but not very
toxic, said Jim Price, director of research for the Texas Air
Control Board in Austin.
   More than 900 people work in shifts at the plant, built in 1948
on the 800-acre complex on the Houston Ship Channel, said Dave
Dryden, Phillips spokesman at company headquarters in Bartlesville,
Okla.
   The Coast Guard closed a two-mile length of the channel for
about seven hours, authorities said. No ships reported damage.
   ``I went to the bank which was several miles from the area and I
could feel it shake,'' said Betty Parks, spokeswoman for police in
Pasadena, just outside Houston.
   The first explosion at Phillips' Houston Chemical Complex,
located just off Texas Highway 225 less than 10 miles southeast of
downtown Houston, occurred about 1 p.m., Ms. Parks said.
   Several explosions followed, witnesses reported.
   Seismologists at Rice University in Houston said the blast
appeared to be the equivalent of 10 tons of TNT.
   Officials closed a nearby section of Highway 225, Ms. Parks
said. Thousands of people lined up along freeways to watch yellow
and green flames shooting from the plant.
   Joe Baccus said he felt the explosion at his business at least
15 miles away and could see the flames and smoke.
   ``I just saw a few minutes ago a huge fireball that's plainly
visible. I'm now looking at the smoke and it appears like three
different fire centers, one is gigantic and two off to the side of
it,'' he said.
   Glen Dickey, who lives five miles from the plant, said he came
home from lunch and found find a 6-foot piece of metal in a tree.
   ``Pieces of stuff were falling out of the sky. I got over there
to my house, and my neighbors and they were walking out in the
neighborhood picking up pieces of metal and insulation off the
roads,'' Dickey said.
   He said he and his wife were at a restaurant eating lunch when
``all of a sudden the whole building shook.
   ``Some people started hollering `earthquake.'''
   At Kruse Elementary School, students were herded into the
gymnasium after the building was damaged. The children,
pre-kindergarten to fifth grade, were sent home Monday afternoon.

<HEAD>Two Canton Residents Jailed On Charges Of Spying During Demonstrations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two residents of the southern Chinese city of
Canton have been sentenced to jail on charges of spying for Taiwan
during the spring pro-democracy demonstrations, an official report
said.
   The Guangzhou (Canton) Municipal Mid-level Court on Monday
sentenced Zhang Yi and Wu Jidong to 13 years and 10 years in prison
respectively on charges they spied for the Kuomintang, or
Nationalist Party, that rules Taiwan, the China News Service
reported.
   The news agency claimed the two had worked for the Kuomintang
since October 1988. It said Zhang received 1,200 Chinese yuan
($323) for his services and Wu was paid 100,000 Japanese yen ($700).
   Kuomintang agents _ identified only by the surnames Zhou, Wang
and Wu _ trained Wu and Zhang to be spies, provided them with
espionage equipment and ordered them to report on student
demonstrations and protest fasts taking place in Beijing and
Canton, the report said.
   The Nationalist Chinese government on Taiwan claims to be the
sole rightful ruler of all China even though it lost a civil war to
the Communist Chinese 40 years ago. Beijing views Taiwan as a
renegade province.
   China announced nearly three weeks after crushing the
student-led pro-democracy movement in early June the arrest of 13
men on allegations of spying for Taiwan to instigate the protests.
It said the men were Chinese nationals recruited by Nationalist
military intelligence officers.
   Taiwan denied the arrested men were Nationalist spies.
   There was no immediate Nationalist reaction to the latest
allegations of spying by the two Cantonese men.

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The 273-year-old Boston Light, the nation's oldest
lighthouse, has received federal funds for someone to light the
lamp for at least another year.
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., and Coast Guard Adm. Richard
Rybacki said Monday the money will postpone plans to reassign
Boston Lights' three-man crew and automate the lighthouse this
fall. The automation was to be part of a nationwide program to
upgrade lighthouses.
   In the Coast Guard's fiscal 1990 appropriation, $100,000 that
was earmarked for automating the lighthouse on Little Brewster
Island will be used instead for staffing. Boston Light was first
lit in 1716.
   ``There are some benefits having a lighthouse manned by the
Coast Guard. It's a traditional thing and the places are very
valuable national treasures,'' said Coast Guard Lt. Paul Wolf.
``However, technology has allowed us to do the automation work so
there isn't a need for someone to go and light the lamp anymore.''

   Congress should salvage Medicare coverage of
mammograms from the catastrophic health insurance program the House
recently voted to repeal because the tests help prevent breast
cancer deaths, women's health activists say.
   ``It's time for women to take their health care into their own
hands,'' said Deborah Dingell, chairwoman of the National Women's
Health Resources Center. ``If this were a man's issue, it wouldn't
be a problem.''
   The comments came after a ceremony Monday honoring people who
have raised awareness about breast cancer, which strikes one in 10
American women.
   Rep. Mary Rose Oakar, D-Ohio, was cited for her efforts in
Congress, such as including mammography tests in the Medicare
Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988. She urged that Congress be
lobbied to accept a Senate provision retaining coverage for breast
cancer tests.
   House and Senate negotiators are trying to work out differences
on the program. The mammography program would initially cost $60
million but would ultimately save millions of dollars through early
detection that would save hospitalization costs, Ms. Oakar said.

   The night before Buck Helm unknowingly
drove his aging car into a concrete death trap, the burly
longshoreman slept as usual in the rusty yellow panel truck he kept
parked by the docks, co-workers said.
   The morning before he defied death at the hands of a killer
earthquake, he'd been a winner at tonk, the card game of the docks
played at a quarter a hand.
   At 5:04 p.m. on Oct. 17, the magnitude 6.9 earthquake caused a
1\-mile-long section of Interstate 880 to cave in around him,
killing dozens of motorists and pinning Helm across the front seat
of his tiny Chevrolet Sprint. For the next 90 hours, he remained
trapped under the crumbled concrete.
   On Monday, the 57-year-old survivor surprised his doctors at
Highland General Hospital by nodding his head to indicate he felt
no pain.
   Dr. Floyd Huen, medical director of the hospital, said Helm's
condition could be upgraded from very serious to serious if he
continued recovering at the present rate.
   ``When he was asked about whether he was hurting anywhere, he
shook his head and everbody was incredulous,'' Huen said.
   After work a week ago today, Helm jumped into his silver Sprint
and drove into what would become the heart of the disaster,
according to a ship's clerk at the Port of Oakland's Charles P.
Howard Terminal.
   Four days later, astonished rescue workers pulled him out of the
crumbled interstate.
   Helm's children and former wife have been at the hospital since
he was rescued Saturday.
   ``Buck and I was married 16 years and we have some beautiful
children,'' said his ex-wife, Lorrie, flanked by daughter Desiree,
12, sons Jeffery, 16, and Marc, 22, and Marc's fiancee, Audra.
``We've always been the best of friends no matter what.
   ``He's always been there when I needed him,'' she told
reporters. ``This is when he needs us.''
   Desiree was afraid her father had been killed because he hadn't
called to say he was safe.
   Marc is waiting for the day his father comes home and tells the
kids to clean house, the way he used to, or goes back to building a
rock wall in the yard.
   ``I'm sure when he was in there he was saying, `There's no way,'
'' Marc said. He is sure his father kept repeating: ```My daughter,
she's going to get married (some day), she's going to graduate. My
son's in college. My other son's going to be going to college.'
   ``Just no way he was going to give up,'' Marc said.
   Helm, 5-foot-11 and 230 pounds, can't talk because a respirator
tube has been run down his throat.
   After a news conference, Helm's ex-wife took a 15-minute tour of
the freeway where her former husband survived beyond all odds. She
was escorted by police officers.
   ``She said, `Oh, my God. I don't see how anyone could make it
out alive.' And then she reflected on it a minute and said, `Well,
if anyone could, Buck could,''' said police Sgt. Jack Huth.
   Fellow dockworkers disagreed as to whether Helm was headed to
The Oaks Clubroom in neighboring Emeryville, where he played
lowball poker once a week, or to Berkeley where he enjoyed exotic
foods.
   Basil Parker, a ship's clerk, passed Helm on the freeway on his
way home to Berkeley before he heard the roar and saw the clouds of
dust behind him after the freeway caved in.
   ``If he was going to The Oaks, he would have just gone up Market
to San Pablo,'' Parker said. ``I would have to assume the man was
going to Berkeley.''
   Wherever he was headed, it was in a tiny car that had more than
200,000 miles on it because of all the weekend trips he'd made to
visit his family in Weaverville, 250 miles north of San Francisco,
co-workers said.
   ``You'd look at it and think that any collision would kill the
occupant,'' said Ralph Bucher, chief clerk at the terminal where
Helm works.
   Helm also kept a panel truck at the docks and slept in it many a
night. On the left side of the truck, they said, Helm had painted
in orange the words ``Weaverville Flash,'' referring to the
Northern California logging town.
   On the right side, he painted a cartoon bunny and ``Desiree's
Delight,'' after the daughter he called his rabbit.
   Inside, Helm had a mattress, a Snoopy sleeping bag, two alarm
clocks, some clothes, and a panel of photographs of his children,
including one of Desiree in a huge pair of football shoulderpads.
   ``He has tried living down in this area,'' Bucher said. ``He
basically figured that rather than being in business for himself he
was better off with that weekly paycheck and acted to go back to
the mountains and go through the routine of commuting on weekends
to and from and basically living on the docks during the week.''

<HEAD>Soviet Editor Defies Pressure to Resign</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAREY GOLDBERG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The editor of the Soviet Union's most popular
newspaper says Communist officials want to scare the press into
toeing the party line by making an example of him for straying.
   But Vladislav A. Starkov says he will resist pressure to quit.
   The editor-in-chief of the weekly Arguments and Facts appealed
to Western public opinion on Monday from the office President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev had suggested he vacate.
   ``It's a great injustice and a violation of all my journalistic
rights,'' Starkov said in an interview of the attack on how he has
run the paper.
   He said he was the victim of unspecified high party officials
who were trying to make an example of him ``to frighten the whole
press.''
   Starkov said officials have forced him to cancel a planned trip
to Canada on Saturday, and that he was afraid he might also have to
forgo a trip to New York scheduled for Oct. 25.
   Eleven days ago, Gorbachev criticized several top Soviet editors
as inflaming passions and hurting reform efforst by allegedly
overplaying the country's economic and ethnic troubles.
   He reportedly said Starkov should resign over a poll his paper
carried implying that human rights activist Andrei D. Sakharov is
more popular than Gorbachev.
   ``Mikhail Sergeyevich told me that in my place he would
resign,'' said Starkov. ``But I took it as a warning, not a direct
firing order.''
   Despite this, Starkov reiterated his strong support for
perestroika, Gorbachev's program of economic and political reform.
   ``The most insulting thing for me in all this is that I'm being
considered almost an enemy of Gorbachev, or an enemy of
perestroika,'' he said. ``There was never anything like that.''
   Starkov said, however, that officials have not been suffiently
making clear the proper line the press should take.
   ``There is a struggle on. I understand I'm a victim of that
struggle, and Arguments and Facts fell between the stones of a
treadmill.''
   The stocky, 49-year-old editor who has headed Arguments and
Facts for 10 years said that although the weekly had made mistakes,
he stands behind it.
   The Soviet press has carried only one vaguely worded story about
the closed-door meeting at which Gorbachev rebuked the editors, and
nothing at all about the call for Starkov to resign.
   Arguments and Facts is published by Znaniye _ Russian for
``knowledge'' _ a national society that sponsors lectures, books
and periodicals and is not under direct government control. But
Starkov said the ruling Communist Party could order Znaniye to fire
him.
   He would not specify who was pressing him to resign, but he said
party officials were trying to get him to agree to a ``promotion''
to the State Publishing Committee or the parliament.
   The Arguments and Facts staff of 20 reporters and editors and
was surprised their newspaper was picked out for censure, said
deputy editor-in-chief Alexander Meshchersky.
   ``We not only criticize but try to find solutions,'' he said.
``If we have pursued an erroneous editorial policy then 26 million
people are wrong.''
   With a circulation of 26 million and annual profit of about $39
million, Arguments and Facts is the most widely read Soviet
newspaper.
   It aims to tell people what they want to know, from rumors of a
price hike on gasoline to the history of Soviet espionage.

   An upper section of the Bay Bridge that
crashed onto a lower deck in last week's earthquake is too badly
damaged to be used again, state transportation officials said.
   ``It's too bent up and unsuitable,'' said Jim Larson, spokesman
for the California Department of Transportation. But he added the
decision Monday to build a new section won't add any time to the
estimated four weeks that the main link between Oakland and San
Francisco will be closed.
   The damaged upper section is 74 feet long and 50 feet wide and
weighs 200 tons. The section was cut in half by concrete saws and
blow torches beginning Saturday to make it easier to move.
   Workers on Monday completed the dangerous job of removing the
upper section by crane and lowering it 200 feet to a barge. The two
pieces were shipped to nearby Alameda.
   Workers also lowered part of the bottom deck that was damaged
and cracked when the upper deck collapsed onto it, and planned to
complete that project today.
   For four weeks and perhaps longer, thousands of commuters who
depend on the bridge will have to find alternate routes across San
Francisco Bay.
   The 8.5-mile-long bridge, which opened in 1936, normally carries
260,000 vehicles per day. Officials say repairs will cost up to $1
million.
   Nationally broadcast pictures of the broken bridge, with the
upper deck dangling like an open trap door, provided the first
graphic illustration of the magnitude of the 6.9 Richter scale
quake. One woman died when she drove her car into the gap.
   The bridge also had been in the logo created for the 1989 World
Series between the San Francisco Giants and the Oakland Athletics.
But its closure contributed to Sunday's decision to delay
resumption of the championship until Friday, as officials attempt
to reduce traffic problems.

<TEXT>
   A film distributor was sentenced to one year
in prison for marketing videos featuring porn actress Traci Lords
when she was in her teens.
   Rubin Gottesman, 56, of Woodland Hills, pleaded for leniency
before receiving the prison term Monday.
   ``My life has been probably the worst it's ever been the last
three years,'' he told U.S. District Judge David V. Kenyon.
``Please don't send me to jail.''
   But Kenyon said Gottesman clearly had opted for profit over
restraint by distributing the videos.
   Gottesman, the judge said, was too enamored of ``the almighty
dollar'' and lacked ``the fiber or the character to say, `I won't
be involved in that kind of thing. I will not participate in making
that kind of thing happen.'''
   Kenyon also imposed a $100,000 fine on Gottesman's company,
X-Citement Video Inc., and a $650,000 suspended fine.
   Kenyon ruled in June that Gottesman knew Miss Lords was still a
minor when she appeared in the films ``Lust in the Fast Lane,''
``Sex Shoot'' and ``Screaming Desire.''
   Miss Lords, born May 7, 1968, allegedly had used false
identification to get work in sex films beginning in 1984. She
appeared in dozens of movies before she was 18.
   Gottesman's attorney, Stanley Fleischman, argued at trial that
the child pornography law under which his client was convicted was
unconstitutional. ``We will win, in my opinion, on appeal,'' he
said.

   A judge has awarded $1.9 million to a man
wrongly imprisoned six years for a murder he did not commit.
   ``How does one put a monetary value on seemingly mundane things,
like sleeping in one's own bed, a stroll through the park or a hug
from a loved one?'' wrote Court of Claims Judge Adolph C. Orlando
in a decision released Monday.
   Orlando set the price at $1.935 million, which he ordered the
state to pay to Robert K. McLaughlin, 29. The judge blamed an error
in identification and an ``overzealous'' police officer for
McLaughlin's unjust conviction and incarceration.
   McLaughlin was charged with murder, robbery and weapons
possession for a December 1979 killing in New York City. The victim
was killed fending off a robber, according to court papers.
   A jury had convicted McLaughlin of robbery and murder, and
sentenced him to 15 years to life in prison.
   His conviction was upheld by the Appellate Division of state
Supreme Court. The state's highest court, the Court of Appeals,
refused to hear the case.
   But court records say McLaughlin's foster father, Harold Hohne,
succeeded in showing authorities that McLaughlin had nothing to do
with the crime in 1986 and he was released.

   Atlantis' five astronauts were home
with most of today off, while their ``amazingly clean'' spaceship
remained in California for servicing after a successful mission
that sent the Galileo to Jupiter.
   The Galileo probe, said to be operating flawlessly, has traveled
more than 1.1 million miles since deployment about 6{ hours after
Wednesday's blastoff. The $1.5-billion, nuclear-powered probe's
2.4-billion-mile trip will take six years.
   The long-delayed odyssey to Jupiter will include one sweep past
Venus and two by Earth to gain momentum from the planets' gravity.
Once it reaches Jupiter, Galileo will fire a probe into the Jovian
atmosphere and then orbit the largest planet for 22 months.
   Atlantis returned to Earth on Monday with a picture-perfect
landing that occurred three hours early at Edwards Air Force Base,
Calif., to avoid higher winds predicted for the afternoon. Winds
moments before touchdown were only about 4{ mph.
   ``Atlantis, congratulations on an outstanding mission,'' Ken
Cameron radioed from the Johnson Space Center in Houston. ``You've
extended the shuttle's reach to the outer planets.''
   ``It's nice to be home,'' replied shuttle commander Donald E.
Williams, who guided the 97-ton winged spaceship to a pinpoint
landing on a hard clay runway in the Mojave Desert.
   The 9:32 a.m. PDT landing ended a 1.7 million-mile-mission that
unofficially lasted 4 days, 23 hours and 41 minutes. The mission's
main purpose was launching Galileo, which scientists hope will find
clues to the formation of the universe and provide the best look
yet at another planet.
   About 20,000 people were at Edwards to watch the landing. The
crowd was small compared to past touchdowns because of the weekday
landing, officials said.
   About 45 minutes after landing, the astronauts emerged from the
shuttle and performed the traditional walkaround inspection with
NASA officials. The other crew members are pilot Mike McCulley, and
mission specialists Ellen Baker, Shannon Lucid and Franklin
Chang-Diaz.
   ``The vehicle looks amazingly clean,'' said William Lenoir, an
acting associate administrator of the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration. ``We did not see, with a quick inspection,
any significant tile damage _ a little nick here and a nick there.''
   The black tiles protect the shuttle during its fiery re-entry
into the atmosphere.
   Later in the afternoon, the astronauts left Edwards aboard two
Gulfstream jets for their home base in Houston.
   The crew members and their spouses arrived at Houston's
Ellington Field at about 6:30 p.m., where they were greeted by
their children and 300 cheering friends and co-workers.
   ``This is obviously one of the highest points in my life so
far,'' Williams told the crowd. ``It's super.''
   The astronauts have most of today off, but were expected to the

   Slogging through muddy tent
encampments teeming with earthquake refugees, evangelist Billy
Graham told frightened victims not to let their faith be rattled.
   ``I think we have to recognize that God is a god of love and he
doesn't allow a thing like this to happen without a purpose,'' the
preacher said while traveling by a Salvation Army sedan.
   ``I don't know what the purpose is. It's a mystery to me. I've
never figured out all these disasters from the biblical point of
view.''
   Watsonville Mayor Elizabeth Murphy met with Graham at the city's
disaster center, where the preacher led a brief prayer of thanks
for all the volunteers who have worked to salvage what remains of
the community.
   The mayor said she was pleased Graham came. ``We want to get
people in the churches. We feel it does a great deal to get another
power to help you out,'' she said.
   Salvation Army disaster Capt. Jeni Gregory described ``pockets
of misery'' in dozens of small tent cities sprinkled throughout
this agricultural community. She said there could be as many as
5,000 refugees, many of them homeless, but many just too frightened
to go back to their homes despite inspections declaring them safe.
   An agricultural community of 27,000, Watsonville is known as the
hub that produces much of the nation's lettuce and salad greens. It
took a big hit when the 6.9-magnitude quake struck a week ago
today. A total of 175 homes were destroyed, 930 homes were damaged,
17 commercial buildings were destroyed and 47 businesses sustained
damage.
   Residential damage was placed at $88 million, structural damage
to businesses at $34 million.
   Graham shook hands with dozens of people waiting for food Monday
in a pouring rain outside a Salvation Army distributiton center.
Many had only cardboard boxes for umbrellas and plastic food wrap
for raincoats.
   ``We appreciate you coming here,'' said Mario Guzman, 34.
   Later, Graham flew to Oakland where he gave the Salvation Army a
$100,000 check for earthquake relief and toured the site of the
collapsed Interstate 880.
   ``Yes sir, there's somebody up there that's stronger than we are
and stronger than anything we can build,'' the evangelist remarked
as he gazed up at the concrete rubble.
   He called the disaster ``almost an unbelievable thing,'' and
said ``it's a miracle to me there weren't more people killed than
there were.''
   Glancing at a nearby section of freeway deemed so dangerous it
must be leveled, Graham said: ``It makes me think of the Tower of
Babel and how it came crashing down.''
   But he said he did not mean to suggest the tragedy was God's
Judgment. ``These are natural disasters,'' Graham said.

<HEAD>Former FBI Agent Being Released on Bail While Awaiting Spy Retrial</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Former FBI agent Richard Miller, imprisoned
since 1986, won permission for his release on $357,000 bail while
he awaits a new trial on charges he handed over secrets to his
Soviet lover.
   U.S. District Judge David Kenyon set bail on the order of the
9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which ruled that Miller had not
been shown to be a flight risk.
   ``The spirit of the order of the appeals court is that they
directed this court to set a bond that Mr. Miller can meet,''
Kenyon said at a hearing Monday.
   Miller was ordered returned to Los Angeles from the federal
prison in Rochester, Minn., while papers are processed for his
release.
   His brother, sister and a friend agreed to post property worth
$357,757 to assure his appearance at court proceedings. Kenyon did
not require that any cash be posted.
   ``We're pleased that he will be getting out,'' defense attorney
Stanley Greenberg said outside court. ``It's a little later than we
would have liked. But better late than never.''
   Kenyon scheduled a hearing for Monday to determine when Miller's
third espionage trial will be held. The first jury deadlocked in
1985. A second jury convicted him in June 1986, and Kenyon
sentenced him to two life terms plus 50 years.
   Miller's conviction was reversed in April on grounds that jurors
were allowed to hear too much about lie detector tests that Miller
failed.
   Kenyon at first refused to allow Miller's release on bail,
saying he might flee. But the appeals court disagreed.
   The corpulent Miller, who battled the FBI over his weight and
other problems during a lackluster 20-year career with the agency,
was depicted by prosecutors at his trial as a bitter, vengeful
failure easily recruited as a Soviet spy.
   His attorneys said Miller was a well-meaning FBI misfit who
dreamed of redeeming his career by infiltrating a Soviet spy
network.
   Among those who testified against him was a co-defendant,
Svetlana Ogorodnikov, who became his lover and allegedly enticed
him into spying. Mrs. Ogorodnikov and her husband, Nikolay, pleaded
guilty to spying and are serving prison terms.
   Miller was excommunicated by the Mormon church. His wife, Paula,
divorced him following his conviction and has since remarried. She
was last reported living in the Philippines. Some of their eight
children continue to live with their mother, Greenberg said, and at
least two are on Mormon missions overseas.
   Under terms of his release, Miller would be placed in the
custody of Albert Sayers, a former FBI agent and private
investigator who worked on the defense.
   Miller also will be forbidden to leave the Los Angeles area
without permission.

   Drug czar William Bennett urged TV
industry leaders to incorporate more anti-drug messages into their
programming, and called drug abuse a graver catastrophe than the
Northern California earthquake.
   ``While Santa Cruz was the epicenter of that disaster ... Los
Angeles is the epicenter of a social disaster _ drugs,'' Bennett
told members of the Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences.
   Bennett, director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy,
told a group of studio executives they should help fight the war on
drugs by sending anti-drug messages to their viewers.
   ``It seems to me we can do better than Pablum ... and better
than good entertainment,'' he said Monday. ``I am not the cultural
commissar. It is your business to decide what is on your shows.''
   He said progress has been made in the depiction of drugs on
television and in movies, with illegal substances being portrayed
unfavorably.
   He also praised the efforts of Hollywood to set an example of
``chic sobriety,'' but said that for every glamour capital ``there
is a Watts.''
   Following his speech, Bennett was asked by entertainer Ben
Vereen if he believed anti-drug messages delivered by former drug
abusers were sending mixed messages to children. Vereen is a former
drug abuser who recently has visited elementary schools to urge
pupils to stay off drugs.
   ``I think kids need to hear what hell has been like,'' Bennett
said. ``But they also need to hear from people who have never used
drugs.''

<HEAD>Investigators Say Severe Downdraft May Have Caused Crash</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Investigators are looking at
atmospheric turbulence during the difficult approach to
Tegucigalpa's airport as a possible cause of a plane crash that
killed 131 people, sources close to the probe say.
   Some sources say an atmospheric phenomenon called a ``rolling
wave,'' which can occur when wind whistles over mountains, could
have created a severe downdraft or turbulence that left the plane
1,800 feet below its assigned altitude before Saturday's crash.
   Co-pilot Reiniero Canales, in an interview on Honduran radio,
said the Boeing 727 was making a normal approach on instruments
through clouds when, ``Suddenly we hit something. It was all so
fast we didn't have time to react.''
   The crash of TAN-SAHSA Flight 414, which originated in San Jose,
Costa Rica with a stopover in Managua, Nicaragua, killed 131 people
and left 15 survivors, including pilot and co-pilot.
   The U.S. Embassy said 12 Americans were presumed dead; the three
American survivors have been airlifted to hospitals in the United
States and all are expected to survive.
   Investigators questioned tower and air control workers and made
an aerial survey of the crash site Monday.
   The site, heavily damaged by looters, was cleared late Monday to
allow inspection by a team from the National Transportation Safety
Board, Boeing Co. and Pratt &amp; Whitney, the engine manufacturer.
   The investigators also planned to question the crew of the last
previous plane to land at Tegucigalpa to see if they also
experienced turbulence.
   Barry Trotter, leader of the U.S. team, emphasized that he was
in Honduras to assist the Hondurans in conducting the investigation.
   ``They are giving us every facility to help them,'' he said.
   Relatives of the dead continued to gather at the morgue as
forensic experts tried to identify charred corpses. The Sandinista
Air Force sent a plane to pick up the bodies of Nicaraguan victims.
   Relatives also pored over the wreckage as the search for remains
continued. One man burst into tears when he found a photo of wife.
   The Honduran Minister of Defense, Col. Wilfredo Sanchez, looking
gaunt and unshaven, was at the site for a second straight day
searching for his daughter Fanny's personal effects.
   ``I'm not here to direct. I'm just looking,'' he said, clicking
a set of charred keys in his hands.
   When Sanchez, whose son was killed in an air force accident last
year, spotted a suspected looter he grabbed the man and ordered
police to get him ``out of my sight.''
   Col. Marco Tulio Rivera, head of the Honduran Civil Aeronautics
Authority, said pilot Raul Argueta radioed the tower at 7:52 a.m.
that he was at 7,500 feet seven miles from the airport, precisely
on target.
   The pilot was supposed to descend to 6,700 feet at the five-mile
mark, 1,800 feet above the 4,900-foot Cerro de Hule.
   ``What happened in those last few seconds is what we have to
figure out,'' said Rivera, who added that Argueta had not yet been
interviewed because of his injuries.
   Sources familiar with the investigation, speaking on condition
of anonymity, said other causes being looked at included possible
engine failure or a false altimeter reading.
   Rivera said it was unlikely that a piece of the plane's roof
might have blown off, as happened to an Aloha Air jet over Hawaii
in 1988.
   A Boeing Co. spokesman said the plane, which was leased from
Contiental Airlines, had taken off and landed 52,019 times, about
average for a 21-year-old plane. A high number of takeoff-anding
``cycles'' has sometimes been seen as a factor in accidents caused
by metal fatigue.
   Sources said repeated accounts of severe turbulence before the
crash jibed with the theory of a ``rolling wave'' downdraft.
   They explained that the 50 mph wind flowing south over the Cerro
de Hule would follow the contour of the land until it hit another
mountain behind the Cerro. The wind could then be pushed up and
over itself, turning in violent eddies that cause an airplane to
lose lift and drop thousands of feet in seconds.
   The approach to Tegucigalpa is notorious among veteran Central
American travelers because the airport is set at the bottom of a
ring of mountains, as if it were at the bottom of a soup bowl, and
the mountains are frequently obscured by racing clouds.
   ``It's a pretty hairy approach,'' said one source familiar with
the probe.

<HEAD>Judge Sets Trial Date for Boys Accused of Raping 12-Year-Old Girl</HEAD>
<DATELINE>YPSILANTI, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 7-year-old boy, slumping in a chair
and holding his mother's hand, was ordered to stand trial on a rape
charge in an attack on a 12-year-old girl.
   The 7 year old and two 12-year-old boys, all from Ypsilanti,
face one count each of first-degree criminal sexual conduct
involving accomplices, Assistant Prosecutor John Stanowski said
Monday after Probate Judge John Kirkendall set Nov. 22 as the trial
date.
   Two other defendants, boys ages 7 and 9, didn't appear at their
arraignment last week and were being sought, said the Washtenaw
County assistant prosecutor.
   ``This is not sexual experimentation between two young people of
the opposite sex,'' Stanowski said. ``This is a gang-type offense.
Two were holding her down while the third one ... knew the private
areas of a woman and was fondling and molesting her.
   ``I was aghast that kids that age were involved,'' Stanowski
said.
   Robert Reizner, a lawyer for the 7 year old, said his client was
too young to face charges.
   ``There is a common-law presumption that children under the age
of 6 are conclusively presumed not to be able to have any criminal
intent,'' Reizner said. ``This child at the time of the alleged
event was maybe a month and a half over (7 years old).''
   The attack occurred July 16, authorities said. The girl was
knocked down and kicked in the head, Stanowski said. During the
attack, the girl's 11-year-old cousin tried to stop the boys, but
they ``fended her off,'' Stanowski said.
   ``If these kids were adults they would be facing life,''
Stanowski said. ``Because they are juveniles ... there's a whole
different avenue the court may take as far as the disposition.''
   Stanowski said the boys could be put on probation and ordered to
undergo counseling, placed in foster homes or assigned to
in-patient mental health care if they are convicted.
   Stanowski said one of the 12-year-old boys also is charged with
assault with a dangerous weapon in a knife attack on the same girl
in August.

   RADAR STATION
   The power of perestroika does not in itself insure us against
mistakes. It's important not to hide them, to admit them and
correct them.
   In this respect, the Krasnoyarsk radar installation issue is
very significant. It took us four years to get to the bottom of it.
   We were charged with violation of the ABM treaty because of the
station. It took the government quite a while to learn all the
truth of the project. Finally, we saw it clearly: The station had
been built on the wrong site, not where it should have been.
   All these years, we have been working hard to keep up the ABM
treaty as a foundation for strategic stability. We have been
looking for options and having very complicated debates on the
interpretation of each article of the treaty and its supplements'
contents.
   And all the while, there stood the station, the size of an
Egyptian pyramid, representing, to put it bluntly, a violation of
the ABM treaty.
   At last we resolved this issue and announced we would dismantle
the station. This has brought some discontent in the country, as if
we were forgoing our own interests.
   In fact, we are saving the ABM treaty and opening the way to the
conclusion of the treaty on strategic weapons, and we're gaining
the legal and moral right to demand clarity on the question of
American installations in Greenland and England which were
modernized, we understand, in violation of the treaty.

   WARSAW PACT COUNTRIES
   Here, there have been historic, qualitative changes. We are
building our relations with them on the basis of sovereign
equality, the impermissibility of any intervention and the
recognition of each country's absolute freedom of choice.
   And here is where Soviet diplomacy faces the deepest
restructuring in essence, methods and style.
   In some of them, new, alternative forces are entering the
political arena. No one is leading them there. They are coming
because that's what the people want. And these states do not cease
to be our neighbors, our allies, our friends. All our obligations
remain in force.

   When more than 100 U.N. members for a number of years were
condemning our action, what other evidence did we need to realize
that we had set ourselves against all of humanity, violated norms
of behavior, ignored universal human values?
   I am referring of course to our military engagement in
Afghanistan. It should teach us a lesson that in this case, gross
violations of our own laws, intraparty and civil norms and ethics
were allowed.
   At the time I am speaking about, M.S. Gorbachev and I were
candidate (non-voting) members of the Politburo. I found out about
what had happened from radio and newspaper reports. A decision that
had very serious consequences for our country was made behind the

   For the first time in many years, not a single Soviet soldier is

military bases abroad as well as our military presence there by the
year 2000. We are prepared to head toward the dissolution of the

   Dozens of searchers hunted in cold, snowy
weather for a 9-year-old boy lost since Sunday with his horse in
the central Oregon canyons.
   Melvin Bundy, a spokesman for the Klamath County search and
rescue unit, said darkness and the poor weather forced 70 people to
temporarily stop their search Monday night, but an expanded,
helicopter-aided search was planned for today.
   Nathan Madsen was reported missing by his family Sunday
afternoon after he disappeared during a cattle roundup, said Chuck
Hoy, a spokesman for the rescue unit.
   Hoy said searchers were growing increasingly worried about the
boy as the weather deteriorated late Monday afternoon. The cold,
wet conditions posed an extreme danger of exposure to the boy, he
said.
   ``It's getting scary now,'' he said. ``It's snowing like the
devil.''
   Hoy said searchers spent a second night in the rugged timberland
along the Little Deschutes River north of Chemult, which is 160
miles south-southwest of Portland.
   Hoy said rain and sleet that fell late Sunday and early Monday
had erased any tracks searchers might have followed.

   Poland's press is condemning Lithuania's
decision to restrict travel to the Soviet Baltic republic by Poles,
many of whom have been buying up precious goods there and shipping
them home.
   Polish newspapers said the move was political. Monday's editions
of the communist youth newspaper Sztandar Mlodych called the
decision ``a kind of political schizophrenia.''
   The dispute, while economic in origin, underscores how the
decline of strict Communist Party control in Eastern Europe is
allowing long-repressed nationalist tensions to emerge.
   On Friday, Lithuania restricted Poles and other East bloc
residents to one visit a year, specified that currency be changed
to rubles when entering the republic, cut train service from
Vilnius and Warsaw to one daily and prohibited visitors from
mailing home parcels.
   The measures were to prevent scarce goods in Lithuania from
being bought out by visitors. In the Soviet Union, goods from
school composition books to meat are in short supply because of the
country's economic difficulties.
   Many Poles, themselves in the throes of economic crisis, are
expert at finding goods in neighboring countries that can be bought
cheaply and sold at home or in other Warsaw Pact nations.
   The pro-Solidarity newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza ran a dispatch on
the restrictions under the headline, ``Stop Tourist.''
   Sztandar Mlodych said, ``Erecting at our borders more and more
obstructive barriers ... represents a kind of political
schizophrenia.''
   The newspaper said the decision clearly was directed at Poland.
The rules about parcels and train service mention Poland
specifically and the number of visitors from all other East bloc
countries together is less than half the number from Poland
annually.
   The histories of the East bloc neighbors are closely connected
and the two are at the forefront of change in the Communist world.
   In the past year, the Solidarity movement in Poland and the
Sajudis movement in Lithuania have supported one another in their
parallel efforts to increase independence from Moscow.
   In the past, Poles have expressed concern about the treatment of
the ethnic Polish minority in Lithuania.
   The Soviet republic holds bitter memories of historic Polish
dominance, including a 1920 invasion in which Poland seized
Lithuania's capital of Vilnius and held it until 1939.
   About 8 percent of Lithuania's 3.5 million population are ethnic
Poles. Poland and Lithuania were allied from the 14th century
through the Jagiellonian dynasty, then formed a commonwealth from
1569 until 1795 when Lithuania and most of Poland succumbed to
Russian rule.
   Over the centuries, the gentry in Lithuanian became
Polish-speaking while the peasantry spoke Lithuanian, the country's
native language.
   In the late 19th century, a Lithuanian nationalist movement
emerged to fight Polish cultural and Russian political domination.
   In September 1939, both Lithuania and eastern Poland were
occupied by the Soviet Union. Poland regained statehood after World
War II, but Lithuania remained a Soviet republic.

   A capacity crowd of 56,000 cheered today as former
President Reagan tossed the first pitch of the third game of
Japan's version of the World Series, narrowly missing a Kintetsu
Buffaloes batter.
   Winding up about halfway between home plate and the pitcher's
mound, Reagan, a former sportscaster, fired off a throw that barely
cleared batter Daijiro Ohishi's backside.
   Reagan, wearing a blue suit, laughed and waved to the crowd.
Some people chanted, ``Reagan, Reagan.''
   The former presideint is in Japan on a nine-day visit at the
invitation of the Japanese government and Japan's largest media
conglomerate, Fujisankei Communications Group.
   Fujisankei reportedly is spending about $7 million on the trip,
which aims at improving ties between the United States and Japan.
Fujisankei officials have refused comment on reports Reagan and his
wife Nancy will earn $2 million.
   On Monday, Reagan met with Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu and
Emperor Akihito. He received one of Japan's highest awards, the
Grand Cordon of the Supreme Order of the Chrysanthemum, for
promoting free trade and friendship.
   As Reagan entered the field at the Tokyo Dome for the Japan
Series game between the Yomiuri Giants and Kintetsu Buffaloes, an
announcer asked the audience to make donations to victims of last
week's San Francisco earthquake ``to promote U.S.-Japanese
relations.''
   The temblor, which measured 6.9 on the Richter scale, struck
shortly before the scheduled start of the third game of the World
Series in San Francisco. At least 60 people were killed and damage
is estimated at $7 billion.

Sajudis movement in Lithuania have supported one another in their
parallel efforts to increase independence from Moscow.
   In the past, Poles have expressed concern about the treatment of
the ethnic Polish minority in Lithuania.
   The Soviet republic holds bitter memories of historic Polish
dominance, including a 1920 invasion in which Poland seized
Lithuania's capital of Vilnius and held it until 1939.
   About 8 percent of Lithuania's 3.5 million population are ethnic
Poles. Poland and Lithuania were allied from the 14th century
through the Jagiellonian dynasty, then formed a commonwealth from
1569 until 1795 when Lithuania and most of Poland succumbed to
Russian rule.
   Over the centuries, the gentry in Lithuanian became
Polish-speaking while the peasantry spoke Lithuanian, the country's
native language.
   In the late 19th century, a Lithuanian nationalist movement
emerged to fight Polish cultural and Russian political domination.
   In September 1939, both Lithuania and eastern Poland were
occupied by the Soviet Union. Poland regained statehood after World
War II, but Lithuania remained a Soviet republic.

   A special legislative session will be called
in the next 14 days to evaluate earthquake damage and arrange for
relief that could include a temporary increase in sales or gasoline
taxes, the governor said.
   After meeting with top lawmakers for 90 minutes Monday,
Deukmejian said: ``We certainly did discuss that,'' referring to
the tax increases.
   ``The final decision on that will depend in large part on the
extent of the damages together with the expected action of the
federal government,'' he said.
   The earthquake struck the San Francisco Bay area a week ago
today, killing dozens, injuring thousands and causing up to $7
billion damage.
   The governor said he would meet with Assembly Speaker Willie
Brown and Senate Majority leader David Roberti, both Democrats;
Senate Minority Leader Ken Maddy and Assembly Minority Leader Ross
Johnson next Monday to try to put together a special session agenda.
   The Appropriations Committee of the U.S. House of
Representatives approved a $2.85 billion aid package Monday _ $1
billion less than the amount sought by California's congressional
delegation.
   The governor said he and legislative leaders discussed the
possibility of holding an earlier, special election to consider a
ballot measure currently slated for June 1990. That proposal would
liberalize the state's spending limit and pave the way for a
gradual 9-cent gasoline tax increase.
   But he said no decision had been made on that question.
   The state temporarily raised the gasoline tax twice during the
1960s to repair roads damaged by storms and floods, but legislative
leaders said they would prefer a sales-tax boost.
   Brown said it would take a large increase in the gasoline tax to
generate the same amount of money that a 1-cent sales tax increase
would provide.
   Johnson said he might support the idea of a standby tax increase
that would be triggered if officials determined at a later date
that the funds were needed.
   Johnson also criticized the idea of moving up the election on
the spending limit-gasoline tax measure, saying legislators and the
governor might need all the time available to convince voters to
approve the proposal.
   The Legislature completed its 1989 session on Sept. 16 and is
not due to return to the Capitol until January.

   The Who, The Four Tops, The Platters, Bobby

Roll Hall of Fame, the Daily News reported today.
   Joining those rock notables, in the forefathers category, will
be Louis Armstrong and Ma Rainey, the newspaper said.
   The Who _ whose hits include the song ``My Generation,'' the
rock opera ``Tommy,'' and guitarist Pete Townshend's in-concert
destruction of his instruments _ will be inducted along with the
other nominees at the Waldorf-Astoria hotel in New York in a
ceremony in January, the newspaper said.
   The hall's announcement was expected at a news conference today
in Cleveland, where the four-year-old Rock and Roll Hall of Fame is
based.
   Cleveland has raised $37 million of the $40 million necessary to
build a museum honoring the new members as well as the 56 people

<TEXT>
   A judge today convicted 71 radical
students in connection with the burning death of seven policemen
and relatives of the dead troopers and of the defendants scuffled
in the courtroom.
   About 2,000 riot policemen were deployed around the District
Criminal Court in southern Pusan as the convictions and sentences
were read to the students, all from Pusan's Donghui University,
where the troopers were killed.
   Angry relatives of the dead policemen protested when students
were not sentenced to death. Relatives of the students and of the
troopers pushed and shoved and traded insults after the sentencing.
   Some defendants left the hearing before sentencing, saying they
didn't care about the penalty. They said police commanders were
responsible for the deaths because they ordered a raid on the
campus.
   As the judge began reading the verdicts, students in the gallery
sang dissident songs and shouted ``Clarify the truth.''
   Of the 71 students, one was sentenced to life in prison, three
received 15 years in prison and 31 others received sentences
ranging from one to 13 years. The remaining 36 received suspended
sentences.
   Both prosecution and defense lawyers said they would appeal the
sentences. People convicted of murder in South Korea can be
sentenced to death by hanging, but Judge Kim Myung-kil said the
students appeared not to have intended to kill anyone.
   Seven riot troopers were burned to death at Donghui University
during a campus battle. The troopers were trying to rescue five
police officers held hostage by radical students.
   Students set fire to a barricade drenched in paint thinner as
the troopers climbed over it. Several officers, wrapped in flames,
leaped from windows while others were burned to death or choked to
death by smoke. One student was critically injured.
   The deaths shocked South Koreans and the government ordered a
crackdown on radical students and dissidents to halt violent
protests. The radicals, who want the overthrow of the government
and removal of U.S. troops from South Korea, have little support
among the people because of their violent tactics.
   The prosecution had demanded the death penalty for three
students they said led the violence.
   ``We refuse trial!'' shouted the defendants as they arrived at
the courtroom. When some students defiantly refused to leave the
buses, they were dragged off by prison guards.

<HEAD>Polls Show Dinkins Support Slipping in Bid for NYC Mayor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL GEITNER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New polls show support for Democrat mayoral
candidate David Dinkins has eroded, and one survey put his lead
over Republican Rudolph Giuliani at only 4 points.
   Less than two weeks ago, a poll showed Dinkins leading Guiliani
by 19 points.
   Political analysts said Dinkins' apparent loss of support may be
due to controversy last week about the handling of his finances,
including discrepancies in the stated value of stock he transferred
to his son. The issue rekindled questions about Dinkins' failure to
pay taxes from 1969 to 1973.
   In a poll of 501 registered voters conducted Sunday for the
Daily News and WABC-TV and released Monday, 45 percent picked
Dinkins, compared with 41 percent for Giuliani. The survey's margin
of error was plus or minus 5 percentage points.
   Less than two weeks earlier, a Daily News-WABC-TV poll showed
Dinkins with 53 percent to Giuliani's 34 percent.
   The survey indicated that the biggest shift occurred among
Jewish voters, who last week favored Dinkins by 10 points. Now, 44
percent of Jewish voters supported Giuliani and 26 percent
supported Dinkins. Twenty-six percent of Jewish voters were
undecided.
   The election is scheduled for Nov. 7.
   Asked at a campaign stop to comment, Dinkins said he had
``anticipated there would be some fall-off, given the negative
campaigning of recent time.'' But he said he didn't put much stock
in the poll.
   ``I don't know that this barometer is an accurate one,'' he
said, noting that polls before the primary showed him and Mayor
Edward I. Koch neck-and-neck. Dinkins won the primary easily.
   A poll conducted for the weekly New York Observer found Dinkins'
support at 47 percent, compared with 27 percent for Giuliani and 25
percent undecided. The gap between the candidates had narrowed to
20 points from 33 points since the last Observer survey.
   Johnson-Singer Inc., which separately does polling for the
Dinkins campaign, telephoned 500 registered voters Friday through
Sunday for the Observer. The issue with the survey was due out
Wednesday.
   The polls were the first since the Sept. 12 Democratic primary
to show Dinkins' support at less than 50 percent.
   Independent pollster Lee Miringoff, head of the Marist Institute
of Public Opinion in Poughkeepsie, said the decline in support in
both polls showed that Dinkins had been hurt, but it remains to be
seen whether the damage will be lasting.
   Asked to comment on the polls, Guiliani said he believed
Dinkins' financial problems _ as well as the revelation that
Dinkins had paid $9,500 to convicted kidnapper Sonny Carson for a
get-out-the-vote drive before the primary _ has brought people to
his campaign, which had been close to running out of money in this
heavily Democratic city.

   Last week's earthquake destroyed the
Moss Landing Marine Laboratories, northern California's most
important oceanographic center.
   ``There really isn't any other place to go for blue ocean
oceanography, it was a world-class center,'' said James Kelly, dean
of science and professor of oceanography at San Francisco State
University.
   W. Ann Reynolds, chancellor of the California State University
system, said she has applied for disaster relief from the state and
federal governments to begin rebuilding.
   The loss, estimated at $8 million, included laboratories, a
library, electronic equipment and a museum.
   Moss Landing, 20 miles south of Santa Cruz and 100 miles south
of San Francisco, was used by researchers from six campuses _ San
Francisco, Hayward, San Jose, Stanislaus, Fresno and Sacramento.
   The nearest comparable laboratories are at the University of
California-Scripps Oceanographic Centers in San Diego and at the
University of Washington, neither of which do research off northern
California.

<HEAD>Survey: 54 Percent Think Mayor Should Resign</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than half of District of Columbia
residents think Mayor Marion Barry should resign, according to a
new poll that finds Barry would lose badly in races against Jesse
Jackson and former police chief Maurice Turner.
   The poll, conducted for WRC-TV and radio station WKYS, found 54
percent of city residents believe the scandal-plagued Barry should
leave office. That figure is up from 41 percent who said in a
similar poll in February that Barry should resign.
   The random telephone survey of 508 adult residents earlier this
month found 35 percent believe Barry, reportedly the target of
ongoing federal investigations, should remain in office and 11
percent were undecided.
   The poll released Monday also showed Barry, who is running for a
fourth term next year, with weak support when matched one-on-one
against two of the key figures in the city's political picture.
   Asked to choose between Barry and Turner, 53 percent of the
residents chose Turner and 28 percent supported Barry, with 19
percent undecided. Turner has not formally announced his candidacy
but has been endorsed by the local Republican Party.
   Barry's support is even weaker when placed solely against
Jackson, who led 65-18 percent with the rest undecided. Jackson is
not running for mayor, but has been reported to be willing to enter
the race if Barry does not run.
   Barry leads the five announced Democratic candidates with 19
percent in the poll of residents. But the other four Democrats got
between 9 percent and 14 percent and 36 of the residents were
undecided when asked to pick among those candidates.
   The survey was conducted by Hitlin Research Associates Oct. 5
through Oct. 19 and had a margin of error was plus or minus 4.5
percentage points. It was not limited to registered voters.
   Barry has seen his political support erode since his friendship
was disclosed late last year with convicted drug dealer Charles
Lewis.

   Israeli-backed militiamen shot and killed two
armed guerrillas during a firefight in Israel's self-declared
``security zone'' in south Lebanon, military sources said today.
   The gunbattle occurred late Monday when a post of the South
Lebanon Army militia came under a barrage of small artillery fire
near Kafr Hunah, 15 miles north of the Israeli border, the sources
said.
   ``SLA soldiers returned fire and a terrorist was killed. No SLA
forces were injured,'' said one source on condition of anonymity.
   The Israeli army sources said a reconaissance patrol found an
AK-47 assault rifle and an explosive charge near one guerrilla's
body.
   The patrol found a second body on a later sweep, the sources
said.
   They were unable to say if the victims were Palestinian or
Lebanese. Both Palestinian and Lebanese militias have attacked
Israeli soldiers and their militia allies in the Israeli-controlled
zone in south Lebanon.
   No organization has claimed responsibility for the attack on the
South Lebanon Army, which is trained, armed and financed by Israel.
   An Israeli army spokesman, who cannot be identified according to
regulations, said it is believed more guerrillas took part in the
clash but managed to escape. He said no Israeli troops were
involved.
   Foreign reports have said about 500 Israeli soldiers patrol the
2.5-to-12-mile-wide security zone together with the militia force
made up mostly of Lebanese Christians.
   Israel carved out the buffer zone to protect its northern border
against attack in June 1985 when it withdrew the bulk of its troops
from Lebanon after a three-year occupation.

   Fair weather prevailed across most of the nation early today,
while rain and snow brought signs of winter to the West.
   Snow advisories were in effect today for the northern and
southern Sierra Nevada and for the mountains of northeastern
California. At least 6 inches of snow fell Monday on parts of the
Sierra Nevada.
   The storm forced closure of state Highway 120 into Yosemite and
prompted the California Highway Patrol to require drivers to put
chains on their vehicle wheels when traveling on mountain roads,
including state Highways 80 and 50.
   The storm also encouraged eager skiers, said Marilyn Graham, an
operator for the Hyatt Lake Tahoe hotel.
   ``If there's a big storm like this, they naturally think it's
ski time,'' she said.
   Scattered showers and a few thunderstorms were expected today in
the San Francisco Bay area. On Monday heavy rain complicated the
area's cleanup from last week's earthquake.
   Strong and gusty winds also were over parts of the West, with 40
mph winds reported at Ontario, Ore., on Monday evening. A wind
advisory was in effect today for the Owens Valley of Southern
California.
   Elsewhere, sunny skies brightened the Plains and the Mississippi
Valley Monday. Temperatures warmed into the 70s and 80s, rising to
the 90s in parts of Texas.
   The high for the nation Monday was 92 degrees in Texas at
Laredo, Mineral Wells and San Angelo.

   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa said today
he canceled a trip to Chile after military President Augusto
Pinochet pardoned two banned union leaders the Polish union chief
had planned to meet.
   Walesa told reporters at Solidarity headquarters in the Baltic
port of Gdansk that his scheduled visit to Chile this week was no
longer necessary. He said there were more pressing problems in
Poland.
   The Solidarity leader said his visit to Chile would be
rescheduled.
   In a surprise move Monday, Gen. Pinochet pardoned Manuel Bustos
and Arturo Martinez just four days before Walesa was to arrive.
Walesa had called on Pinochet to free the union officials.
   The pardon permits the men to leave the provincial towns where
they have lived in internal exile for the past 404 days.
   Bustos and Martinez were sentenced last year to 541 days of
confinement for calling a 1987 general strike to protest the
Pinochet government. The army commander took power in a bloody 1973
military coup.
   Bustos is president of the United Worker's Central, the nation's
largest labor federation, and Martinez is the group's vice
president. The Central invited Walesa to Chile, where he had
planned to spend three days.
   Walesa was prohibited from traveling outside the country after
the Dec. 13, 1981 martial-law crackdown, but since the Solidarity
union was legalized again on April 17 he has made several trips
abroad.
   The Solidarity leader is scheduled to travel to Canada and the
United States in mid-November.

<TEXT>
   Leaders of the pro-choice and
anti-abortion factions are predicting that some form of tougher
abortion controls will be passed in the House.
   The House is expected to begin debate on the proposed controls
this afternoon.
   The debate follows setbacks for abortion opponents in Florida
and Illinois, where legislative committees defeated restrictive
proposals. National pro-choice and anti-abortion leaders have
viewed Pennsylvania as a key battleground since the U.S. Supreme
Court's Webster decision in July that gave states more authority to
regulate abortion issues.
   A proposal by Rep. Stephen Freind, the Legislature's leading
abortion opponent, would prohibit abortion after the 24th week of
pregnancy except under threat of ``substantial and irreversible
impairment of bodily function'' to the mother. Two doctors would
have to approve the abortion.
   The legislation also would prohibit abortions based on the
fetus' sex, require a 24-hour waiting period to obtain an abortion
and require women to inform their husbands if they plan to get an
abortion.
   Democratic Rep. Karen Ritter of Lehigh, who leads the pro-choice
caucus in the House, said her group needs to sway about 40 members
to defeat Freind's proposal.
   If Freind's proposal wins House approval, pro-choice lawmakers
plan to try to weaken the bill with 20 to 30 amendments on issues
ranging from restoration of unrestricted Medicaid funding to
removal of the 24-week ban.
   Ms. Ritter and Freind both said they expected some amendments to
pass, but he declined to say which ones might have a chance.
   Pro-choice groups plan to hold a candlelight vigil on the
Capitol steps today during the debate.
   The Senate is not expected to take up the abortion legislation
until the week of Nov. 13. Democratic Gov. Robert P. Casey supports
the House proposal.

   Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto
is expecting her second child, her doctor has confirmed, despite
denials earlier by family members.
   Gynecologist Faredoon Sethna said Ms. Bhutto, 36, was pregnant
but refused to say when the baby is due. Some sources close to the
prime minister said they believed it would be in late December or
early January.
   Ms. Bhutto's mother, Nusrat Bhutto, who serves her daughter as
de-facto deputy prime minister, publicly denied reports of the
pregnancy last spring.
   Asked at a news conference Sunday night on her return from a
summit of Commonwealth leaders, the prime minister said: ``I am not
prepared to answer a question relating to my private life.''
   Ms. Bhutto and husband, Asif Zardari, a Karachi businessman,
already have a son, Bilawal, born in September 1988. She assumed
office on Dec. 2 as the first female head of government in a modern
Moslem nation.

   ``Young and Reckless'' may sound like the name
of a soap opera, but a new study says it's the way some 68 million
Americans approach diet and health.
   On the other hand, the study says 45 million others are
``healthy and wealthy'' and characterizes other large groups as
``fat and frustrated'' and even ``confused and indifferent'' about
their health.
   The survey done for Prevention magazine found that middle-aged
women with college degrees lead the healthiest lifestyles, while
white, male, blue-collar workers have the worst health habits.
   The report, ``The Fit and the Fat,'' found a sizable group of
people who want to be healthy but lack the resources, both personal
and financial. Many others know what to do to be healthy but lack
motivation, said Thomas Dybdahl, director of the study.
   Even as the magazine was reporting on Americans' health habits,
the National Research Council was issuing new dietary
recommendations.
   The average American adult can get along on as little as 500
milligrams of salt a day, far less than the usual diet contains,
the council said.
   The NRC's 10th edition of its Recommended Dietary Allowances
also says cigarette smokers need at least 100 milligrams of vitamin
C per day _ as opposed to 60 milligrams for adult non-smokers, and
suggests that pregnant women should increase vitamin C to 70
milligrams a day.
   The new guidelines are the first update of the nutrient
recommendations in nearly 10 years. The RDAs are a major guide for
developing nutrition programs and policies.
   The Prevention magazine study, based on a survey of 1,250
randomly selected Americans, was conducted by Louis Harris
Associates. A survey of that size has a margin of error of about 3
percentage points.
   ``Clearly, this report demonstrates the need to deliver health
information in a method that can be both heard and understood,''
added Mark Bricklin, editor of Prevention.
   The survey categorized Americans into the following groups:
   _The ``healthy and wealthy'' are tops in health and nutrition
behavior. Members of this group are careful with their diets, limit
fat and make sure they get enough fiber, vitamins and minerals.
They get regular medical tests, maintain proper weight, wear
seatbelts and exercise.
   This is the group most likely to drink alcohol, but not to
excess.
   They are about 45 million strong, more than half are women and
the group is largely in middle age. Members of this group are
likely to have a college degree, high income and professional or
managerial job.
   _The ``safe and satisfied'' tend to have a healthy lifestyle,
but show little inclination to do better.
   They limit the fat, salt and sugar in their diet but are below
average in watching cholesterol. This group has the best record for
exercising, and does well at maintaining the proper weight. They
are below average for dental visits, sleep less than other groups
and have high stress levels, however.
   There are 13 million people in this group, divided almost evenly
between men and women. The largest share is over 50, they are
slightly below average in education and income and many hold
unskilled jobs.
   _The ``sedentary but striving'' are overweight but want to do
better.
   They have good records for avoiding salt, fat and cholesterol
but still have serious weight problems, with 77 percent of the
group overweight. They know it, and about half are trying to lose
weight. They exercise little, however. This group does get medical
checkups, drinks little and has good records for home and auto
safety.
   Nearly two-thirds of the 14.5 million in this group are women.
They are older than the national average, are more likely to be
minorities and have the lowest income levels.
   _The ``young and reckless'' know what healthful practices are
but make little effort to follow them.
   They pay little heed to nutrition, especially fat consumption,
are only average at getting medical care and have a poor record for
using auto seat belts. They do exercise regularly, however.
   This is a large group, 68 million, with males being slightly
more than half. They are younger than the national average and have
slightly higher than average education and income levels.
   _The ``fat and frustrated'' want to be healthy but don't know
what to do. This group has the most members trying to lose weight,
and the fewest who succeed.
   In nutritional habits they are about average, yet 88 percent are
overweight. Their rate for exercising is less than half the
national average.
   This group has the most non-drinkers and has regular medical
exams, but members rarely see a dentist. They have high stress
levels.
   The 13 million in this group are mostly women, slightly older
than average, more likely to be minorities and have the lowest
education level of any group.
   _The ``confused and indifferent'' have limited knowledge of what
constitutes a healthy lifestyle and don't care.
   They have the worst dietary habits, eating lots of fat and salt
and sugar; rarely have medical checks and 74 percent are
overweight. This group does have more non-drinkers than the
national average. They have a poor record for seatbelt use.
   Men are the majority in this 9 million member group, largely
whites, with lower than average education and income levels; many
hold blue-collar jobs.

<HEAD>Speaker Changes Stance; `Hercules' Murals Will Stay in House for
Now</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OLYMPIA, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Murals depicting Hercules that some
opponents consider pornographic will remain in the Washington
House, at least for now, after the House speaker decided to support
them.
   The Democratic speaker, Joe King, said recent attacks on
``obscene'' art by U.S. Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., helped change his
mind about the black, gray and white murals called ``Twelve Labors
of Hercules.''
   King, who opposed the pair of murals until earlier this year,
made a motion Monday in the House Executive Rules Committee to keep
them in the House chamber. The motion was approved on a vote of
3-2, and King said he expected the decision to stand.
   ``Helms really recast the way I look at this,'' he said. ``I'm
not for regulating free expression by censoring art. I think (art
censorship) raises really ominous threats and I was no longer
comfortable allowing the murals to come down.''
   The murals were put up in the House chamber in 1982, but they
were shrouded in draperies until July, when King ordered them
uncovered. The murals were scheduled to be removed in December
because some lawmakers complained they were inappropriate and even
pornographic.
   The creator of the murals, Michael Spafford, said he was
``shocked and extremely pleased'' by the turnaround and found
King's change of heart ``truly courageous.''
   The murals, which face each other across the top of the House
chamber, portray the mythological figure's performance of 12
labors, including the removal of Amazon queen Hyppolyta's girdle.
   One opponent of the murals, Republican state Rep. Mike Padden,
said he will continue to fight the art when the Legislature
reconvenes in January.
   Of the murals, he said: ``They appear to be numerous outlines in
black and white of people in various stages of copulation.''
   Spafford has denied any sexual content.
   Spafford, commissioned by the state to create the murals, said
he hoped he would now be allowed to complete his original plan for
a set of four.

<HEAD>Pediatrics Chief Says Lack of Kids' Health Care a National Disgrace</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDSEY TANNER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One-third of the nation's poor youths lack proper
immunization against disease, said the American Academy of
Pediatrics' chief in urging that children's health issues become a
top national priority.
   To address what it considers a national crisis, the academy is
drafting federal legislation that would guarantee access to quality
health care for all children and pregnant women, even the
uninsured, academy President Dr. Donald Schiff said Monday at the
organization's 58th annual meeting.
   Schiff, a University of Colorado pediatrics professor in Denver,
cited other statistics as well to describe what he called ``a
national disgrace.'' They include:
   _One of every three poor children is not immunized by age 2
against measles, rubella (German measles) or mumps.
   _One of every 10 children under age 4 has not seen a physician
within the past year.
   _The nation's infant mortality rate is 22nd among western
industrial nations, and lags behind countries such as Singapore,
Spain and Hong Kong.
   As many as 16 million people through age 21 are without health
insurance, said Dr. Marvin Kolb, chairman of the AAP's Council on
Government Affairs.
   Marian Wright Edelman, founder of the Children's Defense Fund
and a nationally known lobbyist for children's issues, agreed that
the state of children's health is acute.
   ``We have a child emergency and crisis that's going to bring our
nation to its knees,'' she said in a keynote address to several
hundred pediatricians at the six-day meeting that ends Thursday..
   Ms. Edelman's group, a non-profit advocacy organization based in
Washington, D.C., is working with the academy to fine tune a $12
billion proposal aimed at guaranteeing access to quality health
care for all the nation's children and pregnant women.
   The proposed legislation would provide funds to improve
employer-based health insurance for covering employees and their
dependents.
   But more importantly, for uninsured children and pregnant women,
a parallel system would be created providing private health
insurance through a state-administered fund, Schiff said.
   The academy, a 37,000-member group based in Elk Grove Village,
Ill., is looking for a congressional sponsor and expects the
measure to be formally introduced early next year, Schiff said.
   Ms. Edelman blamed the ``crisis'' in health care for children in
part on Bush administration policies that favor such things as
bailing out the banking industry and lowering the capital gains tax
over funding child-care issues.
   To remain competitive with other industrialized countries that
stress health care for children, the United States must make a
similar commitment, Ms. Edelman said.
   ``It's not only inhumane,'' she said, ``it's bad fiscal policy
not to invest in child care.''

<HEAD>FBI Investigating Missing American Indian Artifacts</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The FBI is investigating the disappearance of
American Indian artifacts from a museum and their possible sale to
collectors, museum officials and private dealers said.
   An inventory six months ago of Southwest Museum's 200,000 pieces
indicated more than 25 objects were missing from a storage area,
said Jerome Selmer, the museum's executive director.
   Selmer would not say what was missing or estimate the value of
the art. He said the FBI located several items that had yet to be
returned to the museum.
   An FBI official confirmed the agency was investigating because
stolen goods may have been moved between states. He provided no
other details.
   The museum near downtown Los Angeles has a highly regarded
collection of American Indian art, tools, clothing and other
artifacts.
   Dealers in New Mexico, a center of trading in Indian artworks,
said FBI agents showed them photographs of blankets, pots, baskets
and kachina dolls the agents said were from the museum.
   Malcolm Grimmer, co-owner of the Morningstar Gallery in Santa
Fe, N.M., was quoted by the Los Angeles Times today as saying he
almost bought a share of a stolen pot that the FBI later
confiscated from a friend.
   The friend, who Grimmer would not identify, paid $24,000 for the
pot earlier this year and did not know it was stolen, Grimmer said.
   The Southwest Museum was founded in 1907 by historian and
American Indian expert Charles Lummis.

<TEXT>
   Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze says the
Soviet Union is prepared to eliminate its foreign military bases by
the year 2000 and draw back to within its own borders.
   And he promised that as East bloc countries move away from
one-party Communist rule, the Soviet Union will observe strict
principles of non-intervention and ``absolute freedom of choice.''
   In a major foreign policy address to the Supreme Soviet
legislature on Monday, Shevardnadze also condemned his
predecessors' decision to send troops into Afghanistan, calling it
a ``gross violation'' of Soviet law and ethics.
   He also admitted that the Soviet radar station in Krasnoyarsk
violated the U.S.-Soviet Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty. The Soviets
said last month that it would be dismantled, ending a dispute that
soured U.S.-Soviet arms control talks for years.
   Shevardnadze's speech was extraordinary in its frankness and
elevated the Supreme Soviet to a forum for major policy statements.
   Without specifically mentioning any East bloc country, he said
Moscow would henceforth relate to its Warsaw Pact allies on the
basis of ``sovereign equality, the impermissibility of any kind of
intervention and the recognition that each country has the right to
absolute freedom of choice.''
   Poland and Hungary, former one-party Communist states, are
hurtling toward Western-style democracy and hundreds of thousands
of people are taking to the streets in East Germany to demand a
similar transformation.
   The foreign minister said Moscow is prepared to liquidate all
its overseas bases by the year 2000 and draw back to within its own
borders.
   He did not specify what conditions would be set for such a
withdrawal, but a year ago President Mikhail S. Gorbachev announced
the start of a pullback that he said would result in a 500,000-man
reduction in Soviet military forces.
   Shevardnadze told the lawmakers proudly that already, ``Not a
single Soviet soldier is participating _ nor, I'm sure, will
participate _ in military actions anywhere in the world.''
   And he said his government is ``prepared to head toward the
dissolution of the military-political blocs in Europe'' in a mutual
arrangement worked out by NATO and the Warsaw Pact.
   He added, however, that despite recent historic changes in the
Warsaw Pact, the Soviet Union considers that ``all our obligations
remain in force.''
   The Soviet Union previously has made similar offers to disband
the Warsaw Pact, which was formed in 1955 in response to the
creation of NATO, if the West scraps its military alliance.
   Shevardnadze denounced the decision by the late President Leonid
I. Brezhnev to send Soviet soldiers into Afghanistan in December
1979 to help the Marxist government there fight the anti-communist
guerrillas.
   He disavowed any connection with the decision to intervene and
said it involved ``gross violations of our own laws, intra-party
and civil norms and ethics.
   ``A decision that had very serious consequences for our country
was made behind the back of the party and the people,''
Shevardnadze said in the speech, the full text of which was carried
by the official Tass news agency. At the time, both he and
Gorbachev were non-voting members of the Communist Party's ruling
Politburo.
   It was not the first time highly placed Soviets have disclosed
that the decision to intervene in Afghanistan was made by a small
circle around Brezhnev. But it had not previously been
characterized by a government spokesman as an outright violation of
law.
   The last Soviet troops pulled out of Afghanistan in February.
   Shevardnadze said it took Gorbachev's government four years to
determine that the location of the Krasnoyarsk radar station in
Siberia violated the 1972 ABM treaty, as claimed repeatedly by the
United States.
   He said that as the Soviet Union tried to move forward on arms
treaties based on the pact ``there stood the station, the size of
an Egyptian pyramid, representing, to put it bluntly, a violation
of the ABM treaty.''
   Shevardnadze said the station will be dismantled but added:
   ``We are saving the ABM treaty and opening the way to the
conclusion of a treaty on strategic weapons (long-range nuclear
missiles). And we're gaining the legal and moral right to demand
clarity on the question of American installations in Greenland and
England which were modernized, as we understand, in violation of
the treaty.''
   The United States has claimed the treaty does not apply to its
modernization of the stations in Thule, Greenland, and Fylingdales
Moor, England, because they were in place before the ABM accord was
signed.
   In Washington, a Bush administration called Shevardnadze's
admission ``encouraging. It builds a degree of confidence, it
builds a degree of trust.'' Shevardnadze and Secretary of State
James A. Baker III met last month in Jackson Hole, Wyo., and issued
a joint statement saying Moscow has decided to completely dismantle
the Krasnoyarsk station.
   The Kremlin had previously offered to turn the station over to a
civilian agency and partially dismantle it, but stopped short of
acknowledging it violated provisions of the ABM treaty.
   The United States rejected any plan short of complete
dismantling of the station, saying the ABM treaty prohibited the
deployment of large radar facilities capable of giving early
warnings of missile attacks anywhere except on the periphery of
U.S. or Soviet territory.
   The Krasnoyarsk station is several hundred miles north of the
Chinese border.

<HEAD>McMartin Defense Claims Evidence May Have Been Fabricated</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A defense lawyer in the 2{-year-old McMartin
Pre-School child molestation trial claims medical evidence that
children were sexually abused by school personnel may have been
fabricated.
   Attorney Danny Davis made the claim Monday, the fourth day of
his closing arguments, as he urged jurors to acquit Raymond Buckey,
31, and his 62-year-old mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey.
   He accused prosecution medical experts of ``trying to find
molestation when they could.''
   Davis was expected to conclude his statement today. Prosecutors
then have 3{ days to rebut defense arguments.
   The Buckeys face 64 counts of molestation and one count of
conspiracy alleging that 11 children were molested at the
now-closed McMartin Pre-School they ran in Manhattan Beach.
   They were among seven people arrested in 1983, when prosecutors
contended scores of youngsters had been victimized. Charges against
the other five were later dropped on grounds of insufficient
evidence, although all had been bound over for trial after a
lengthy preliminary hearing.
   The trial has cost taxpayers an estimated $15 million, making it
the nation's most expensive and lengthy criminal proceeding.
   Because of illness and other problems, the original panel of 12
jurors and six alternates has dwindled to 12, the minimum required
by law. Superior Court Judge William Pounders has expressed concern
that loss of another juror would cause a mistrial if the case isn't
concluded soon.

<TEXT>
   Young Christian followers of Gen. Michel
Aoun today burned tires and demonstrated in Lebanon's Christian
enclave against Parliament's peace plan that shifts political power
to the Moslem majority.
   However, the right-wing Phalange Party, the main Christian
political organization in Lebanon, declared support for the peace
plan worked out by Lebanese legislators during three weeks of
discussions in Taif, Saudi Arabia.
   The Lebanese forces, the main Christian militia, did not reject
the plan aimed at ending 14 years of civil war, saying it had
positive points.
   Aoun had ordered his 20,000 troops on alert, after he rejected
the peace plan because it does not include a clear timetable for
the withdrawal of Syria's 40,000 troops from Lebanon.
   Salim Hoss, head of the rival Moslem government, also must
approve the plan. He made no immediate comment, but senior aides
said on condition of anonymity that he supports the Taif accords.
   Smoke billowed from the burning tires as schools, banks,
government offices and other businesses closed, abiding by a strike
call by Aoun's Christian cabinet.
   About 10,000 youths, mainly students, demonstrated in Christian
east Beirut.
   ``We sacrifice our blood for the general!'' the demonstrators
chanted as many of them waved huge posters of the 54-year-old
Maronite Catholic soldier.
   ``Yes, yes to the general. No, no to Taif!'' the demonstrators
said as they headed to Aoun's headquarters at the bomb-ravaged
presidential palace in suburban Baabda, east of Beirut.
   Addressing the demonstrators, Aoun said the accord's wording of
a Syrian withdrawal ``is very vague, from now until eternity.''
   Moslems have argued that the Syrian presence was their only
guarantee that political reforms would occur.
   ``We don't want to give away our beloved land,'' Aoun said in
his 15-minute address. He has said the Lebanese people should vote
on the accord and offered to step down if they support the
parliamentary plan.
   The Phalange Party, in a statement published by the daily paper
As-Safir and other newspapers, called for a ``unified Christian
stand to pursue implementation of the Taif plan.''
   Phalangist leader George Saadeh, who also heads the Lebanese
Front alliance of right-wing Christian forces, was one of the
legislators who worked out the peace plan.
   The Lebanese forces, the main Christian militia in the civil
war, said it was holding contacts with Aoun and other Christian
leaders to formulate a ``unified Christian stand on the Taif
accord.''
   When Lebanon received independence in 1943, the majority
Christians were given a 6-to-5 advantage over Moslems in all
government posts. Moslems now make up more than 50 percent of the
nation's population.
   Lebanon's pro-Syrian Moslem and leftist militias have expressed
dissatisfaction with the peace plan, mainly for not giving them as
much power in running the nation's affairs as they had requested.
   The Progressive Socialist Party of Druse warlord Walid Jumblatt
and the mainstream Shiite Moslem Amal militia called meetings to
formulate their stands on the accord.
   Jumblatt, Syria's main ally in Lebanon, said Monday he was not
happy with the accord but would accept it ``upon Syria's request.''
   Amal, headed by Nabih Berri, also rejected the plan because it
did not provide greater representation in parliament for the 1.2
million Shiites, Lebanon's largest single sect.
   Under the plan, the 99-seat chamber will be expanded to 108,
equally divided between Moslems and Christians. Amal had demanded
the number be increased to 128 and hoped to get most of the
additional seats.
   At least 930 people were killed and 2,744 wounded in six months
of fierce artillery duels between Aoun's forces and Syrian gunners
until an Arab League-sponsored cease-fire took hold Sept. 22.
   The latest outbreak began in March after Aoun blockaded illegal
militia-run ports and the Moslem-Syrian alliance responded by
shelling the Christian enclave.

<HEAD>Mayor: Commuters Must Cooperate 'Til Christmas to Ease Gridlock</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-SF Quake, Bjt</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The San Francisco Bay area's 3 million
commuters must cooperate until Christmas with officials urging them
to use car pools or ride buses, trains or ferries to avoid
gridlock, Mayor Art Agnos says.
   ``So far it has been very smooth,'' said Agnos, who boarded an
FBI helicopter to get an aerial view of commuter traffic Monday
evening. ``There is congestion, but not anything that created
gridlock.''
   Despite foul weather, commuters got through without crippling
problems on the first full workday since the earthquake. The
California Highway Patrol reported more traffic congestion but
fewer accidents than normal.
   And early today, skies were clear and traffic on freeways and
bridges moving well, transit officials said, prompting a fear that
the good news may invite a return to normal driving patterns later
in the week.
   ``We are concerned. We can only wait and see what happens. If
every one went back to their normal routine, we would have the
gridlock everyone is talking about,'' Sgt. Lisa Homen of the Golden
Gate Transportation District, which manages the famous bridge, said
today.
   The Bay Area Rapid Transit system set a single-day record
Monday, with 261,901 passengers, 39 percent more than on the
previous Monday and a record for a single day.
   Agnos said some drivers were traveling alone _ something
Metropolitan Transportation Chairman Rod Diridon termed an
``anti-social act.''
   But the mayor said many others ``have obviously made a decision
to follow the advice'' to use alternative transportation while road
and bridge repairs are made.
   ``It's just a continuation of the extraordinary cooperation and
fantastic attitude'' of area residents, said Agnos, adding that
people have refrained from looting and strangers are helping one
another.
   ``The spirit and character of our city has never been brighter
than it is is today,'' he said. ``If people will maintain this
commitment, we're going to be in great shape.''
   Agnos also said several thousand commuters took advantage of the
quick addition of 14 ferries. Rough water on the bay made some
passengers seasick, but Agnos added the gale-like weather was
unusual and the ride wouldn't be that rough all the time.
   One ferry was turned back Monday because of rough waters,
authorities said. The Union Ferry Building, the terminus of many
ferries bound for San Francisco, was closed for an hour because of
high waves and the boats were diverted to a pier about a mile away.
   On a 6 a.m. ferry from Oakland to San Francisco, what should
have been a 30-minute crossing took 55 minutes through heavy swells
that occasionally washed over the deck of the boat.
   ``I've just been through hell, but heck, I have to admit I made
it through it,'' said passenger John Trowbridge, 27, of Alameda.
``It can only get better, this can't get much worse.''
   ``Everybody's just going to have to go into slow motion. That
includes all the bosses,'' said Karen Meyer, 42, of Oakland.
   The fleet of ferries was called into service to help make up for
the collapse of a section of the 8.5-mile double-deck San
Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge. A 50-foot section of the upper deck
fell like a trap door onto the lower deck during the quake,
knocking the bridge out of commission for at least four weeks.
   Without the 10-lane bridge, 65,000 rush-hour motorists had to
find other ways to and from work. About 260,000 cars use the bridge
daily.
   Extra subway trains and ferries can accommodate an additional
45,000 riders. Other bridges must handle the rest of the traffic
that normally crosses the bridge.
   On the Oakland side of the Bay Bridge, a 1\ mile section of
Interstate 880 collapsed.
   Other freeways also are devastated, including the Embarcadero
Freeway along the waterfront in San Francisco and a five-mile
stretch of Interstate 280 in San Francisco was closed.

   Undercover federal agents shot and killed a
suspected drug dealer near St. Patrick's Cathedral after the man
drove off during a drug deal, authorities said.
   Monday evening's shooting occurred on a street in the middle of
Rockefeller Center less than 100 feet from Fifth Avenue after two
agents arranged to buy four pounds of cocaine from the suspect in a
car, said Drug Enforcement Administration spokeswoman Mary Cooper.
   Once the agents saw the cocaine, they signaled other agents, who
closed in, Cooper said. As the agents identified themselves, the
suspect began to speed off in his Mercedes-Benz, she said.
   One of the agents thrust his arm through a partly open window
and was dragged about 100 feet, the spokeswoman said.
   The agent fired two shots and rolled off the car into the
street, and another agent fired at least one shot, Cooper said.
   The suspect's car crashed into the back of a bus.
   More than 100 people watched as the suspect was handcuffed on
the ground next to the car, then treated for a bullet wound to the
chest. The suspect was unarmed, Cooper said.
   John Lowery, 23, of the Bronx was pronounced dead at Bellevue
Hospital, said Peter Schectman, a hospital administrator.
   The agent, wearing a jacket that said, ``Nobody Gives Me A Raw
Deal,'' suffered hand and knee injuries and was taken to Bellevue
Hospital, said a police spokesman, Sgt. Peter Berry. He later
returned to the shooting scene.

<HEAD>Exxon Suit Alleges State Impeded Spill Response</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Exxon Corp. has sued the state of
Alaska charging that cleanup of the nation's worst oil spill was
hindered because the state opposed the use of oil-dispersing
chemicals.
   A state official said Exxon was trying to rewrite history, and
that the state had approved the use of chemicals before the spill.
   Exxon said it will seek reimbursement from the state for cleanup
costs and damage claims that the company believes were worsened by
the state's conduct. No amounts were specified.
   The case, filed Monday in Anchorage Superior Court, is a
counterclaim to a lawsuit the state filed in August against Exxon
and Alyeska Pipeline Service Co., the industry consortium that
operates the trans-Alaska oil pipeline and the Valdez oil terminal.
   The state's lawsuit alleges that negligence was involved in the
March 24 wreck of the Exxon Valdez and the subsequent oil cleanup,
and that the oil industry misrepresented its ability to deal with a
major spill in Prince William Sound, which leads from Valdez to the
open sea.
   Exxon's counterclaim says immediate use of chemicals to break
oil into droplets was a key part of a spill contingency plan
approved by the state.
   Nevertheless, the suit alleges, the state persistently opposed
the use of chemical dispersants after the Exxon Valdez ran aground
and ripped its hull open, spilling nearly 11 million gallons of
crude oil.
   Dennis Kelso, the state Commissioner of Environmental
Conservation, said Monday that he had not examined the lawsuit, but
that it appeared to be an effort to mislead the public about what
he contends was a lack of oil industry preparedness for a major
spill.
   The state did not oppose the use of dispersants in the area
described by Exxon, Kelso said. He said the industry hadn't
stockpiled enough dispersants in south-central Alaska to do any
good.
   ``Exxon wasn't prepared to use (dispersants) and now they're
trying to rewrite the history of the spill and make it appear that
someone else was the problem,'' Kelso said.
   Before the spill, state and federal regulators agreed that at
the discretion of the Coast Guard, dispersants could be used in the
central part of Prince William Sound without further state
consultation, Exxon said.
   Kelso said the state did not renege on that agreement.
   The Coast Guard authorized use of the chemicals on the evening
of March 26, but by that time it was too dark to work, Exxon said.
During the night, a storm blew much of the oil out of the targeted
zone, the company said.

<TEXT>
   Czechoslovakian Premier Ladislav Adamec
today accused Austrian media of directing anti-government
demonstrations in his country and said a pro-democracy protest
planned for Saturday probably will be banned.
   Adamec said the Communist government in Prague, seen in the West
as one of eastern Europe's hard-liners, is open to criticism.
   ``But we expect honest treatment,'' he told reporters after
arriving on a two-day visit. ``We notice an absence of objectivity
in some of the reporting on Czechoslovakia.''
   In an interview with Austrian reporters before his visit, Adamec
accused Austria's government television of helping to organize
banned demonstrations in Prague.
   Asked by an Austrian television reporter to explain the comment,
Adamec said, ``I didn't say that exactly. But it's true that at a
series of demonstrations, directives have come from various media
in Vienna.''
   Over the past year, Austrian and West German television crews
have been beaten by riot police dispersing banned protests in an
apparent effort to curb their coverage. Their broadcasts can be
received in several parts of Czechoslovakia.
   Charter 77 and other independent groups have announced plans for
a peaceful demonstration Saturday to mark the 71st anniversary of
Czechoslovak independence.
   Adamec said he did not know whether the demonstration would be
permitted, but added, ``I doubt we would have reasons to approve
it.''
   Last year, 5,000 people who took part in a peaceful rally on the
Oct. 28 anniversary were dispersed by riot police using batons,
dogs, water cannon and tear gas.
   The Communist party daily Rude Pravo in Prague has already
warned that any protesters this year could face prosecution.
   Czechoslovakia's relations with Austria, fraught with tension
from the past centuries of Hapsburg domination of Bohemia, are
complicated today by Austrian criticism of Czechoslovakia's human
rights record.
   Austrian Chancellor Franz Vranitzky indicated after initial
talks with Adamec that Vienna hoped to focus on improving economic
and cultural ties during the current visit. The two men are also to
sign an agreement designed to address Austrian concern over the
safety of Czechoslovak nuclear reactors.

<TEXT>
   A real estate firm that set a city record
last year by selling a mansion for $4.1 million is trying to beat
its own mark with an asking price of $5.9 million for a villa along
Millionaires' Row.
   ``Right now, the market is pretty good at the high end,'' said
Spencer Potter, a broker for the Boston-based firm LandVest.
   ``Outside of Boston we just sold a place for $2.5 million the
afternoon it went on the market. Of course, that's not typical. But
it only takes one buyer to make a market at this level,'' he said.
   The firm is trying to sell Fairholme, a Tudor-style villa next
to railroad magnate Cornelius Vanderbilt's former summer
``cottage,'' The Breakers.
   Fairholme was once owned by the sister of artist Georgia
O'Keeffe, and former President Kennedy visited occasionally to swim
in the heated pool when his back gave him trouble, Potter said. The
mansion is now owned by John and Chandler Maschek Jr. of Palm
Beach, Fla.
   ``The buyer will probably be someone self-made, with new money,
who wants to make a statement,'' Potter said.
   Last year, LandVest set a city record by selling Clarendon
Court, which is where socialite Martha ``Sunny'' von Bulow slipped
into a coma that her husband, Claus, was later acquitted of causing.
   The two mansions are within a few blocks of each other, along a
mile-long stretch of Newport known as Millionaires' Row.

   A large part of the emergency response to
an explosion at the Phillips Petroleum Co. plastics plant came from
the petrochemical industry.
   In addition to fire departments from Houston, Deer Park, LaPorte
and Pasadena, emergency crews rushed to the Phillips complex Monday
from other nearby chemical plants.
   They all are members of Channel Industries Mutual Aid, a group
of 96 chemical manufacturers and six communities formed in 1955
following a series of accidents and fires along the Houston Ship
Channel.
   In Texas City in April 1947, a freighter loaded with fertilizer
exploded at a dock, killing 512 people and injuring 4,000.
   The mutual aid group had been planning to use the Phillips plant
as a practice site for an emergency drill scheduled Nov. 8, said
Elizabeth Gonzalez, a deputy coordinator of the Pasadena Emergency
Management Office.
   ``It's an annual drill, and we were working on some of the areas
we identified as deficiencies in our 1988 drill ... elements of
triage and communications,'' she said. ``Needless to say, they're
working very well on all that now.''

<DATELINE>LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Zambians glumly marked their 25th
independence anniversary today with little of the jubilation that
hailed the birth of what was black Africa's wealthiest nation.
   While it was a public holiday and bunting draped some streets of
Lusaka, the capital, there were no signs of open celebrations.
   President Kenneth Kaunda, who led the white-ruled British colony
of Northern Rhodesia to independence as black-governed Zambia on
Oct. 24, 1964, four months ago called for a low-key Silver Jubilee
to save his impoverished nation money.
   Instead, Kaunda watched sporting events, tribal drummers and
dancers and gymnastics at Independence Stadium here.
   Kaunda canceled lavish celebrations in June as part of a package
of International Monetary Fund-proposed economic reforms to salvage
his country's crippled economy.
   Kaunda at the time was forced to abandon a moderate home-grown
program and adopt more radical and unpopular measures including a
devaluation of the Kwacha currency, lifting of state-fixed price
controls and sharp increases in the cost of staple corn.
   All this meant severe belt-tightening for the nation's 7 million
people, whose living standards have plunged since they were
regarded the most prosperous black Africans at independence.
   Since the mid-1970s world prices of copper, which account for 90
percent of all export income, have plunged, spending on social
services has been axed, unemployment and inflation are at record
levels and urban crime is rampant.
   But on Monday night, in a nationwide television address, Kaunda
spoke optimistically about the future of his nation.
   ``I see a bright future for Zambia,'' he said. ``We have taken
very tough economic decisions. But there is no doubt in my mind
that these measures will yield results sooner rather than later.''

<DATELINE>VILAMOURA, Portugal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NATO defense chiefs today discussed
the Western alliance's nuclear needs in an era of reduced East-West
tensions.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and other ministers of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization began a two-day strategy session at
the Quinta do Lago resort on Portugal's southern coast.
   A Dutch official said Cheney and his aides described the U.S.
nuclear modernization effort as ``more in reaction to what the
Soviet Union is doing at this moment'' _ that despite an easing of
tensions the Soviets were building up some long-range nuclear
systems.
   The Dutch official, speaking on condition of anonymity, quoted
the Americans as saying Soviet reform has shown up in the field of
non-nuclear weapons but not on the strategic nuclear side.
   NATO's secretary-general, Manfred Woerner, opened the meeting by
talking about the ``good perspective'' on East-West arms controls
talks in Geneva and Vienna, according to this account. But he
cautioned that NATO governments should not reduce their military
budgets without any concrete results.
   The defense chiefs did not discuss a candid speech given a day
earlier by Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, in which
he said a disputed Soviet radar station violated the U.S.-Soviet
Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty and would be dismantled.
   He also told the Soviet legislature the Kremlin was willing to
negotiate the disbanding of the NATO and Soviet-led military
alliances in Europe.
   There was no immediate reaction to Shevardnadze's remarks. But
his speech was certain to be analyzed, at least informally, by
officials attending the meeting here.
   In advance of the talks, NATO officials said the ministers would
not make any key decisions on their nuclear forces.
   ``The nuclear affairs of the alliance are running along very
smoothly at this time,'' said a senior NATO official who demanded
anonymity.
   Even so, the ministers were considered likely to give their
aides the go-ahead for a detailed examination of the alliance's
nuclear role at a time of enormous changes in the Soviet Union and
Eastern Europe.

<TEXT>
   The government has asked France to
extradite three suspected IRA terrorists accused of murder in
attacks on British military facilities in West Germany, a spokesman
for the Justice Ministry said today.
   Federal officials also are considering an extradition request
for two other jailed suspects in the bombings this past spring in
the northern cities of Hanover and Osnabrueck that left a British
officer dead, said ministry spokesman Stephan Wanner.
   Alexander Prechtel, spokesman for the federal prosecutor's
office in Karlsruhe, said in an interview that his office filed
charges in absentia against the five on Sept. 13 and asked Bonn to
seek extradition.
   The five are accused of murder and attempted murder, Prechtel
said.
   West Germany is party to a European accord on extradition that
binds nations to turn over criminal suspects to states seeking to
prosecute them.
   Wanner said the Bonn government had issued a formal request on
Oct. 12 for extradition from France of the three suspects jailed
there. Prechtel identified those three as: Pauline Drumm, 22;
Donagh Mary O'Kane, 29; and Patrick James Murrey, 46, all of
Ireland.
   Two other suspects in the bombings last June and July were
identified by Prechtel as Leonard Hardy, 28, and Donna Maguire, 23,
both jailed in Ireland.
   They are suspected in the bombing of a British Army barracks in
Osnabrueck on June 19 and a car-bombing in Hanover on July 2 that
killed British Army Sgt. Steven Smith.
   The IRA claimed responsibility for those attacks, as well as
several others against British military facilities in West Germany
over the past few months.

<TEXT>
   The Phillips Petroleum Co. plant hit by
an enormous explosion and fire is the largest of its kind in the
nation and a lengthy shutdown could affect prices in the world
plastics industry, analysts say.
   Phillips' 800-acre Pasadena plant complex turns out more than 2
billion pounds of plastics per year, three-quarters of it
polyethylene. Phillips supplies up to 19 percent of the world's raw
polyethylene, and if its unit making that plastic is destroyed or
shut down for a while after Monday's explosion, manufacturers could
be affected.
   ``If the whole thing goes down, there are going to be shortages
all over the place,'' analyst Bill Kuhlke of DeWitt &amp; Co., a
Houston-based chemical consulting firm, told the Houston Chronicle.
   But, Dave Dryden, a spokesman at Phillips' Bartlesville, Okla.,
headquarters, said today: ``It's hard to say what the effect might
be on the industry. ... We're very early in the assessment (of
damages).
   ``There are thousands of different plastics,'' Dryden said.
``About a third of the world's plastics are made by Phillips or its
contractors.''
   Polyethylene is made from ethylene, a gas derived from natural
gas. Ethylene for the Pasadena plant comes by pipeline from a
Phillips plant in Sweeny. Phillips is spending $300 million to add
1.5 billion pounds per year of ethylene production at Sweeney.
   The polyethylene plant was to have increased production 15
percent in 1990.
   The high-density polyethylene comes out as milky, BB-sized
pellets that manufacturers shape into anything from motor oil
bottles, milk jugs, plastic bottle caps to industrial pipe and
shopping bags.
   Phillips also makes 500 million pounds annually of polypropylene
at the plant, using propylene gas as the base. That plastic's uses
include carpet fiber and films.
   Some industry observers said the effect of the plant's shutdown
will be tempered by a recent loosening of the plastics markets.
   ``Neither (polyethylene nor polypropylene) is nearly as tight as
it was a year ago,'' said Greg Derrick, Phillips' coordinator for
financial communications in Bartlesville.
   Consultant Earl Simpson with Bonner &amp; Moore Associates said the
Phillips explosion should allow a polyethylene price increase of
about 3 cents per pound. Stock on hand will only last about five
weeks, he said.

<TEXT>
   A Kentucky Lottery betting game on
professional football was discarded before it began when Gov.
Wallace Wilkinson declared it ``a bad idea'' in the face of
opposition from the horse racing industry.
   The SuperSports game was scheduled to begin last week, but a
flurry of court activity on a lawsuit filed by horse racing groups
delayed its kickoff.
   On Monday, the Kentucky Supreme Court lifted an injunction that
delayed the game, which involves parimutuel betting on National
Football League games.
   Several hours later, Wilkinson announced he wanted the game
discarded.
   ``The lottery, I think, is being harmed by the controversy
surrounding the SuperSports game,'' Wilkinson told reporters. ``The
fun of the on-line (lottery) game has all been lost in the media
attention given the SuperSports game.''
   Kentucky voters approved a state lottery earlier this year in a
referendum. Oregon was the first state to introduce a lottery game
based on NFL betting, but no court action was filed there and the
game is under way.
   Kentucky Lottery Corp. President Frank Keener and board chairman
William Sullivan said in a joint statement they disagreed with
Wilkinson's decision, but would comply and discard the game.
   The Kentucky Thoroughbred Association, Kentucky Harness
Horsemen's Association and the Horsemen's Benevolent and Protective
Association contended the NFL game would steal patrons from
Kentucky racetracks, the only places where parimutuel betting is
legal in the state.
   The horse racing industry groups also said parimutuel betting on
NFL games was not envisioned by voters who approved the state
lottery, or by the Legislature, which approved legislation to set
up the lottery.
   ``Listening to people across this commonwealth, I think they are
telling me this is a bad idea,'' said Wilkinson, who previously had
told lottery officials he would support the SuperSports game.

<HEAD>Bush Says Excellence in Education Should be the Norm</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush told some of the nation's best
math and science teachers today that they have demonstrated not
only that excellence is possible in American education but that it
should ``be the norm.''
   Bush, addressing the 112 winners of the Presidential Award for
Excellence in Mathematics and Science Teaching, lamented that
America's schools do not produce more top performers in these
subjects.
   ``You've seen all the surveys about American students' poor
performance in scientific knowledge compared to their peers around
the world. We've all seen it. We agonize over them,'' he said.
   ``You're not just complaining about it, you are doing something
about it. You're showing that excellence is not just possible in
American education, but that it ought to be the norm,'' the
president said.
   Bush lauded the victory of a high school student from Denver in
this year's 20th Internal Physics Olympiad in Warsaw.
   ``When the United States began competing in the tournament in
1986 some thought that our students wouldn't really have a chance
against students from Europe and the Far East. But our teams have
consistently distinguished themselves, capped by this gold medal
performance,'' he said.
   ``This is the standard of excellence that America's students and
teachers should aspire to, and that more can attain,'' the
president said. ``Our problem is not that we don't have American
students excelling in science and math; we just don't see enough of
them.''
   Bush apologized to the teachers for being ``a little bit late''
for the ceremony, held in brilliant autumn sunshine in the White
House Rose Garden.
   Nodding in the direction of the Oval Office, he said, ``I was
sitting in there trying to solve a few quadratic equations _
somewhat more difficult than balancing the budget, I might say.''
   He drew more laughter with a call for ``a moment of silence in
memory of those substitute teachers back home.''
   The award program, begun in 1983, is administered by the
National Science Foundation. The winners were named earlier this
year, two from each state and U.S. territories as well as four from
the Defense Department's schools abroad.
   The teachers were headed to Capitol Hill later in the day to
present their ideas for improving education to the House
subcommittee on science, research and technology.

   Doctors performed an emergency Caesarean section
on a dying woman after police located her and her wounded husband
from the sound of sirens coming through the couple's open car
telephone.
   Carol Stuart, 33, a lawyer from Reading, died early today.
Hospital officials said she was 32 weeks pregnant and delivered a
live baby boy. They refused to release information this morning on
his condition, which earlier was listed as critical.
   Her 29-year-old husband, Charles, was in fair condition at
Boston City Hospital with a gunshot wound in the abdomen.
   Mrs. Stuart died at 3 a.m., about seven hours after she and her
husband were robbed and shot in their car by a man who accosted
them outside Brigham and Women's Hospital, police said.
   Police said they were able to locate the couple from the sound
of their sirens coming through the open cellular telephone Stuart
had used to call for help before he blacked out.
   Arthur Jones, a spokesman for Mayor Raymond L. Flynn, said the
Stuarts were leaving Brigham and Women's, where Mrs. Stuart had
just undergone a prenatal examination, when a man climbed into
their car and forced them to drive a short distance.
   Jones said the assailant robbed the couple of their watches and
other belongings, then shot them.
   At 10:40 p.m., Stuart contacted state police with his cellular
telephone.
   State Police dispatcher Gary McLaughlin managed to get a few
details from Stuart on the couple's location before Stuart blacked
out, Trooper Barbara Bennett said.
   Boston Police Deputy Superintendent Joseph Dunford said police
conducted a search by repeatedly turning their car sirens on and
off.
   The dispatcher was able to tell police when they neared the
Stuarts' car from the sound of the sirens coming through the
telephone.
   At 10:50 p.m., police and medical personnel found the Stuarts.
   Stuart was able to provide a ``sketchy'' description of the
attacker, Dunford said. No arrests were made.
   The gunman apparently thought Stuart was a police officer,
possibly because of the cellular phone in the car, Dunford said.
Before shooting the Stuarts, the gunman said, ``I think you're
Five-0,'' slang for police, Dunford said.
   Ted Kakas, owner of the fur store Stuart managed, said it was
the couple's first child and they had been attending a birthing
class before the shooting. The couple had just celebrated their
fourth wedding anniversary, he said.

   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze today began a two-day visit expected to finalize plans
for the first trip to Moscow by non-communist Prime Minister
Tadeusz Mazowiecki.
   ``The Soviet leadership places a lot of importance'' on this
week's visit, Polish radio quoted Shevardnadze as telling Foreign
Minister Krzystzof Skubiszewski after arriving at Okecie airport.
   ``We have high expectations for it,'' said Skubiszewski, an
international law professor sympathetic to the Solidarity trade
union movement that heads the government.
   The Soviet foreign minister is later scheduled to meet with
Mazowiecki, a former Solidarity editor and close adviser of union
leader Lech Walesa.
   Shevardnadze is the second high-ranking Soviet official to visit
Warsaw since Mazowiecki was elected the first non-communist leader
in the East Bloc on Aug. 24. Two days later KGB chief Viktor
Kryuchkov met with Mazowiecki and called him a ``solid man.''
   Shevardnadze arrived in Poland one day after making a major
foreign policy speech in Moscow where he said that the Soviet Union
would observe strict principles of non-intervention in other
nations' affairs and ``absolute freedom of choice.''
   He also indicated that the Soviet Union was prepared to
negotiate the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact and NATO alliances and
to withdraw its military forces to within its own borders by the
year 2,000.
   Poland and Hungary have been leading the way in implementing
democratic reform in the East bloc. Mazowiecki and his Cabinet have
promised to respect Poland's alliance within the Warsaw Pact.

   Defense attorneys for five Americans
accused of conspiring with Carlos Lehder today called the Colombian
drug lord a ``bad dude'' but denied he had anything to do with the
defendants.
   Attorneys ended their final arguments and rebuttal this morning
in the so-called ``Son of Lehder'' trial after Raymond David, who
represents Donald Lady, 41, of Pomona, Calif., charged the
prosecution was grasping at straws.
   ``Carlos Lehder is a drug baron and bad dude, but I don't know
what he has to do with the people sitting over there at the
(defense) table,'' David said.
   Defense attorneys presented arguments Monday and today on behalf
of their clients: The accused were not part of the conspiracy that
the government alleges ran from 1974 to 1989, had withdrawn from
the conspiracy, committed crimes outside the statute of limitations
or were innocent.
   After the defense finished presenting its closing arguments
today, the judge was expected to instruct the jury so it could
begin deliberations.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Ernst Mueller told the jury, ``The
evidence shows only one thing _ that they are guilty as charged.''
   Frederick Mycock, who represents lawyer Barry Kane, 52, of
Hyannis, Mass., told the jury Monday that the government had failed
to prove with any credible witnesses that Kane was guilty.
   If Kane had flown cocaine as alleged in 1977, he withdrew from
the conspiracy, making the government unable to prosecute him
because of the 5-year statute of limitations. And, Mycock said,
there was not one all-encompassing conspiracy as alleged by the
government, but several conspiracies.
   Mueller tied each defendant to Lehder and his organization in
their roles as pilots of cocaine flights and distributors of the
drug.
   ``There was a common thread of importation and distribution,''
Mueller said.
   Lehder, 40, was convicted last year and sentenced to life in
prison without possibility of parole for running a massive
smuggling operation. The case grew out of an investigation that
followed Lehder's trial.
   Defense attorney Patrick Hallinan, who represents Thomas
Herington, 35, of Mill Valley, Calif., claimed the government
``reached down into the slime'' for witnesses.
   ``We don't have one solid piece of evidence except out of the
mouths of felons, liars and perjurers,'' said Hallinan.
   Kevin Sanders, who represents Sam Stewart of Anaheim, Calif.,
called his client a hero, a family man and a law-abiding citizen,
who was the victim of a government ``witch hunt.''
   Herington faces one count of conspiracy to distribute five
kilograms or more of cocaine. Kane, Stewart and Donald Lady, 41, of
Pomona, Calif., are accused of the conspiracy distribution count
and an additional charge of conspiracy to import cocaine.
   Jack Carlton Reed, 59, is charged with operating a continuing
criminal enterprise and conspiracy to distribute.
   If convicted, the men face possible sentences of 10 years to
life.

<TEXT>
   The United Nations, which is
distributing farm tools to thousands of recently returned refugees,
is rethinking a plan to hand out machetes because of the tense
political climate in Namibia.
   ``The decision to distribute machetes at this time, which could
be used as weapons, is under review,'' said U.N. spokesman Fred
Eckhard.
   The United Nations, which is monitoring Namibia's transition to
independence, repatriated more than 40,000 Namibians who fled
during the territory's 23-year bush war.
   The United Nations provides monthly food packets to the refugees
and has begun supplying them with the hoes and seed.
   Eckhard said the United Nations believed it would be unwise to
pass out the machetes prior to the pre-independence elections set
for Nov. 7-11.
   There has been sporadic election-related violence since
campaigning began in July.
   South Africa, which has ruled Namibia for 74 years, has not set
the date for independence, but it is expected to be early next year.

   Inmates went on a rampage in one
cellblock of the State Correctional Institution and at least 29
staff members and 19 prisoners were injured.
   Inmates broke windows, destroyed furniture, set several small
fires and threw things Monday night in Cellblock A, which houses
280 of the Huntingdon facility's 2,000 inmates, said prison
spokesman Ed Mason.
   The incident began when an undetermined number of prisoners
refused to return to their cells after dinner, Mason said.
   Then, about 25 to 35 inmates began ``throwing just about
anything they could get their hands on'' as all guards left the
cellblock, he said.
   ``We don't think it was planned. We think it was a
spur-of-the-moment type thing,'' prison spokesman Steryl Grove said
today.
   Guards regained control of the cellblock by 9:25 p.m., Mason
said. The rest of the prison remained secure.
   Four inmates and 17 correctional officers were treated for minor
injuries at J.C. Blair Memorial Hospital and released, Grove said
today. One officer suffering a head injury and one inmate were
admitted in satisfactory condition, according to a nursing
supervisor who refused to give her name.
   Eleven other staff members and 12 inmates were treated inside
the prison, Grove said.
   Grove said he did not believe Monday's disturbance stemmed from
incidents that began Thursday, when an inmate broke a guard's jaw.
The inmate was placed in restrictive housing.
   Four others were placed in restrictive housing Friday after as
many as six inmates punched and kicked a guard, causing minor
injuries, Grove said.
   Friday afternoon, about 75 inmates gathered in the prison
control center and demanded to see two of the inmates in
restrictive housing, but prison officials refused.

<TEXT>
   Jury selection and legal wrangling resumed today
for the trial of a white Hispanic policeman who killed a black
motorcyclist, touching off three days of racial protests and
rioting.
   Colombian-born Miami officer William Lozano faces two
manslaughter counts in the Jan. 16 shooting of Clement Lloyd, 23,
who was being chased by police, and the death of his passenger,
Allan Blanchard, 24, who died of injuries suffered when the
motorcycle crashed.
   The slaying led to burning and looting in predominantly black
poor neighborhoods. One person was killed and 11 were wounded, and
13 structures burned down only days before the area was host of the
Super Bowl.
   Potential jurors passed two small groups of demonstrators on the
courthouse steps Monday. Black protesters carried signs with such
slogans as ``Stop Killing Black Men,'' while Hispanic
demonstrators, some of them relatives of Lozano, waved Colombia's
flag. One man was arrested when he tried to force his way past
police guarding the courthouse door.
   Inside, attorneys and spectators passed through two sets of
metal detectors and bags and briefcases were searched.
   Defense attorney Roy Black, seeking to have the trial moved,
listed for Dade Circuit Judge Joseph Farina the extraordinary
measures adopted by police worried about a violent reaction to the
trial. Police have bought 700 gas masks and made arrangements for
use of two armored personnel carriers.
   ``I can't remember any trial in which it was necessary to buy
armored personnnel carriers to prepare for it,'' Black said. ``We
can't prevent a riot, but we can ensure jurors are not worried
about it.''
   Four times in the 1980s, police slayings of black men or the
officers' subsequent acquittals have sparked racial violence in
Miami.
   Black said jurors in Miami might be afraid to acquit Lozano and
touch off new rioting.
   Prosecutor John Hogan said he was not concerned about the jurors.
   ``The test is not whether they have heard of the case, the test
is whether or not they can base a decision on the evidence in
court,'' he said. ``We've been able to get juries in other high
publicity cases here in Dade County.''
   Attorneys estimated it could take weeks before trial testimony
begins.

   Fuel oil spilled by a wrecked Brazilian
freighter has fouled 12{ miles of coastline in western Norway's
Sognefjord, officials said Tuesday.
   About 40 volunteers and government workers began cleaning up the
mess with buckets and shovels Monday, said Odd Arne Follum, of the
National Pollution Control Board.
   Sticky sludge coated parts of the remote, sparsely populated
coast when the Mercantil Marica leaked up to 35,000 gallons of
heavy fuel oil on Monday. The ship ran aground and broke in two
during a storm near the fjord Saturday. All 35 aboard the ship were
rescued.
   Residents and a national association of bird watchers criticized
the government Tuesday for tardiness in dealing with the spill.
   Stormy weather hampered efforts to contain the slick, Follum
said.
   ``Most of it will be easy to clean, but it will take weeks,'' he
said. There has been little environmental damage, Follum said.
   A dozen salmon farms were protected from the slick by floating
barriers.

<TEXT>
   Medical science has the means to reduce the
annual number of infant deaths by 10,000 in this country, a top
government health official said today.
   ``We must remove the barriers'' to early prenatal care, Dr.
James Mason, acting surgeon general and assistant secretary for
health in the Department of Health and Human Services, told the
House Select Committee on Children, Youth and Families.
   ``There must be an outreach for those people who are unlikely to
come in by themselves,'' Mason told the committee, which is
examining this country's ranking of 22nd among industrialized
nations in infant mortality.
   The Bush administration has proposed an expansion of Medicaid
eligibility for expectant mothers, he said, and a White House
commission on infant mortality is planning to introduce other
proposals in about two months.
   Lawmakers are looking at such solutions for the problem as more
efforts to consolidate social programs that deal with pregnant
women, a streamlined application system for various social
programs, and an aggressive outreach program though schools,
clinics and welfare agencies to get to women earlier.
   Rep. George Miller, D-Calif., chairman of the panel, questioned
the administration's sense of urgency if it knows that 10,000
infants could be saved yearly. He said there is an identifiable
population of high-risk pregnant women on the rolls of the Women
Infants and Children nutrition program.
   Mason said nearly 40,000 of the 4 million Americans born this
year will not live past their first birthday. An additional 400,000
will live but will be born with or develop chronic problems due to
inadequate care before birth.
   Expectant mothers who must rely on government-funded health
centers rarely get the uniform care private patients receive,
according to a report by the committee's minority staff released on
the eve of today's hearing.
   It said only 18 percent of the government-funded agencies offer
necessary prenatal services in the same facility. Of the 91 sites
surveyed in 10 states, only 38 percent reported offering prenatal
care.
   As a result, the care that a private patient may receive from
one clinic or physician _ pregnancy testing, family planning
consultation, nutrition counseling, delivery and post-partum care _
is scattered for poor women, the study said.
   The study is part of an effort by the committee to explore the
rise during the 1980s in infant mortality and infants with low
birth weight. The figures had fallen in the two previous decades.
   ``We are needlessly wasting hundreds of thousands of lives and
millions of dollars a year because of our failure to provide
adequate prenatal care to pregnant women,'' said Miller, D-Calif.,
chairman of the select committee.
   Miller said that in 1987, the low birth weight rate in the
United States rose to 6.9 percent, the highest level since 1979.
   Each year, 300,000 babies die or are born with low birth weight,
and the U.S. Public Health Service ranks the United States last
among 22 developed nations in infant mortality rates, Miller said.
   He said the committee wants to learn about barriers to adequate
care and ``social problems that have compounded the crisis.'' Among
those are AIDS, drug abuse and the transmission of syphilis to
children because of increased trading of sex for drugs.
   A key issue is the growing number of teen-age mothers who,
according to government figures, have a disproportionate share of
babies with low birth weight and infant deaths. Only 53 percent of
teen-agers receive care in the first three months of pregnancy, the
government reported.
   The centers surveyed were in Alabama, Arkansas, California,
Colorado, Iowa, Maine, New York, Ohio, Virginia and Washington.

   When the authorities at Salisbury
Cathedral began planning new restrooms, they sought advice from the
Royal Fine Art Commission. They got an earful.
   What the bishop of Salisbury calls ``providing a few much-needed
loos'' has been denounced as ``a major act of vandalism'' by the
commission's chairman, Lord St. John of Fawsley.
   Lord St. John even arose in the House of Lords to lash the men
who run Britain's cathedrals, declaring: ``Deans are dangerous.''
   ``I think the whole thing could have been dealt with in an
entirely different and more discreet way,'' said Salisbury's dean,
the Very Rev. Hugh Dickinson.
   The Anglican cathedral has found its restrooms inadequate to
cope with half a million visitors a year who come to gaze at the
404-foot spire, the wealth of sculpture and an original copy of
Magna Carta.
   The new restrooms tentatively were planned in a hidden nook at
the rear of the cathedral, with a door opening off the medieval
cloister. Visitors couldn't see it from outside without trespassing
onto the grounds of the cathedral school.
   However, the restrooms would be a new bump on the cathedral's
ground plan, which has not changed since the foundations were laid
in 1220.
   ``Any construction here would compromise the clarity of the
cathedral plan and was therefore wrong in principle,'' the Royal
Fine Art Commission said in its annual report in July.
   ``Perhaps an aesthetically sensitive peregrine falcon flying
overhead would be troubled at an alteration, but otherwise no one
would see it,'' Dickinson said last month.
   His further thoughts on the dispute appeared in the Salisbury
Cathedral News under the title ``Nostalgia _ Sickness of the
Spirit?''
   Lord St. John, provoked by the bishop's support of the dean,
announced in a letter to The Daily Telegraph last week that the
proposed site of the restroom was among ``the most breathtakingly
beautiful spaces in the whole ecclesiastical world.''
   Despite tourist herds and present controversy, Salisbury is
recognizably the same cathedral that John Constable painted from
the water meadows, still the serene community that inspired Anthony
Trollope's ``Barchester'' novels.
   ``Who could be hard upon a dean while wandering round the sweet
close of Hereford,'' Trollope wrote in ``The Warden.''
   ``Who could lie basking in the cloisters of Salisbury, and gaze
on ... that unequalled spire, without feeling that bishops should
sometimes be rich!''
   Trollope wrote in the 19th century, when the cathedrals were
agitated by demands for reform of abuses including clergymen
enriching themselves by holding multiple offices.
   Today, stripped of their wealth, the great churches are caught
up in costly concerns of preserving the national heritage.
   Salisbury is seeking $10.4 million to repair its spire.
Hereford's dean recently provoked a bitter controversy by proposing
to sell a medieval map of the world to finance repairs costing
$11.2 million.
   Hereford is off the beaten path in western England and draws far
fewer visitors than does Salisbury, which has the additional lure
of nearby Stonehenge.
   Controversies about alterations to the cathedral are nothing new
at Salisbury, which in the 18th century suffered the attention of
James Wyatt, ``the destroyer,'' who moved tombs, knocked down a
stone screen and is said to have removed most of the glass.
   ``There is nothing which we are proposing to do, or would want
to do, to the building which could be anything conceivably on the
scale or effect of anything Wyatt did,'' Dickinson said.
   ``The only proposals which we have tentatively proposed were
things which we regarded as being so discreet that had they been
done here 10 years ago, nobody would have noticed at all.''

   Newly elected East German President Egon Krenz
today sternly warned against further pro-democracy demonstrations,
and communist authorities for the first time admitted that police
had attacked peaceful activists.
   Further protests were expected late today in East Berlin, a day
after more than 300,000 people marched through the streets of
Leipzig demanding greater freedom. It was the largest street
protest in the nation's 40-year history.
   Parliament elected Krenz as president, and he promised to
investigate charges of police brutality against pro-democracy
demonstrators earlier this month. Krenz was in charge of police
forces at the time.
   Krenz, a 52-year-old career politician, last week was named the
new Communist Party chief, East Germany's supreme leadership post.
   Krenz urged an end to further demonstrations.
   ``Demonstrations, however peacefully they may be planned and
thought out, carry within themselves the danger of ending in a
different way from how they started,'' Krenz told the People's
Chamber after his election.
   ``Our society, which has so many new things to tackle, is thus
put under increasing tension,'' he said, calling on East Germans to
refrain from demonstrations to avoid a ``worsening of situation or
confrontation.''
   The official East German news agency ADN said Parliament elected
Krenz, who took over as party chief late Wednesday, with a large
majority of the votes in the 500-member chamber.
   But for the first time during an election of an East German
president, there were votes against the single candidate.
Twenty-six members of the People's Chamber voted against Krenz and
another 26 abstained, according to Parliament speaker Horst
Sindermann.
   Parliament is under the tight control of the Communist Party,
and Krenz's election as president was assured after his nomination
by the 21-member ruling Politburo. The People's Chamber also
elected Krenz to be the head of the nation's armed forces, with
eight votes against and 17 abstentions, ADN said.
   East German officials today admitted for the first time that
police had attacked peaceful pro-democracy protesters earlier this
month.
   ``There were instances where security officials exceeded their
authority and illegal acts were committed against some of those
detained,'' the government said in a statement released by ADN.
   The report was prepared by the national defense and justice
affairs committees in parliament, ADN said.
   ADN said the government later decided to use restraint during
mass demonstrations ``unless there is violence or the threat of
violence,'' and that use of firearms to quell demonstrators had
been prohibited.
   Police officials have apologized to victims of verifiable police
brutality, ADN said. The news agency said 83 complaints of police
brutality are under initial review and four cases have been taken
up by prosecuters.
   Monday's peaceful two-hour protest in Leipzig and an
announcement from several hundred factory workers that they formed
the country's first independent labor union were considered tests
of Krenz's professed desire to embrace reform.
   In Leipzig, demonstrators carried banners and placards critical
of the new leadership and the one-party system that brought Krenz
to power last week after the ouster of his mentor, 77-year-old
Erich Honecker.
   There were smaller demonstrations in East Berlin and in
northwestern Schwerin.
   ADN reported the Leipzig demonstration and other public rallies
on Monday but denied a free trade union had been formed in East
Berlin.
   Several hundred workers at the suburban Wilhelm Pieck
electronics factory said in a statement released in West Berlin
Monday that they formed an independent labor organization called
``Reform.''
   The Reform group wants the right to strike, to set wages for
workers and prices for products.
   West Germany's ZDF television network reported that whole
sections of the factory had already resigned from the state-run
labor federation.
   An appeal to spread the Reform union movement was sent to other
factories in East Germany, the network reported.
   Reform spokesman Roelf Boerger said in the statement issued in
West Berlin that the existing, state-run trade union represents the
Communist Party's interests and ``doesn't enjoy the confidence of
the workers.''
   ADN quoted Pieck factory chief, Wolfgang Wernicke, as saying,
``there was never a meeting to create a so-called independent trade
union at our factory.''
   The news agency also quoted Wernicke as saying that ``one
factory worker'' was responsible for the Reform statement issued on
Monday.
   ``This former trade union member did not succeed with his goal
to create an independent union,'' ADN quoted Wernicke as saying.
   ADN's denial of the incident may signal the limit of the new
leadership's tolerance of dissent and its fear of a force such as
Poland's Solidarity _ which could rally East Germany's 8.6 million
workers.
   Supporters of Solidarity, born nine years ago during nationwide
strikes, now lead Poland's non-communist government.
   Under Krenz, mass demonstrations are being allowed to proceed
eacefully in East Germany and the state-run media have engaged in
unprecedented debate on the state of the country. But the ruling
Communists have made it clear they have no intention of sharing
power with the opposition.
   Opposition groups such as New Forum remain unrecognized by the
government, and officials have declined to discuss reforms with
members of the unofficial organizations.
   Protesters began taking to the streets in large numbers in early
October as East Germany celebrated 40 years as a Communist state
amid an exodus of tens of thousands of skilled young people to the
West.
   At first, police brutally beat and arrested hundreds of
protesters.
   Officials in Austria said today 530 East Germans crossed the
border from Hungary en route to West Germany since Monday. Border
guards said the crossings brought to 44,367 the number of East
Germans who have fled since Hungary opened its border for the East
Germans Sept. 11.

<HEAD>Flight 232 Survivors Form Support Group</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Several Denver-area residents who survived the
crash of United Airlines Flight 232 in Sioux City, Iowa, in July
are organizing a support group to help one another cope with
lingering emotional trauma.
   ``For me, talking to other survivors is probably the most
valuable thing as far as therapy,'' said Jerry Schemmel.
   ``You can talk to counselors, your wife, your family, but when
you sit down in front of another person who went through the same
thing you did, you know that person relates exactly to what you're
talking about.''
   Schemmel, 29, is one of 184 people who survived the crash of
Flight 232 on July 19. The airplane cartwheeled and crashed just
short of an airport landing strip en route from Denver to Chicago,
killing 112 people.
   The victims included Schemmel's colleague and friend Jay
Ramsdell, 25, commissioner of the Denver-based Continental
Basketball Association. Ramsdell was seated about 10 rows behind
Schemmel.
   ``I had one week that was particularly tough for me,'' said
Schemmel, who now serves as acting CBA commissioner. ``It was
described by a therapist as post-traumatic depression. Then I got a
call from another survivor, Garry Priest, and the discussion just
completely picked me up.
   ``Being able to relate to the others opens things up for me. You
tell the survivors things you wouldn't even tell a therapist.''
   Kate Wolfe Bressieux, 35, another survivor, said she hopes the
support group will help ``normalize what we're going through.''
   ``There are very few people who have survived a plane crash, and
nobody can really understand it unless they've shared that
experience. I hope the support group will facilitate the healing
process,'' she said.

   A doctor and his wife pleaded guilty to
prostitution and were fined $2,500 each for paying college students
to have sex with the woman.
   Under terms of an agreement between the prosecution and the
defense, neither Rodney Thorp Wood nor Nancy Steffen Wood will
serve time in prison, perform community service or be placed on
probation.
   The couple sat together Monday holding hands and exchanging
smiles as they waited in court. When Lane County Circuit Judge Jack
Mattison asked if they had anything to say, both said, ``No, your
honor.''
   The Woods, saying they were conducting research into the
``sexual potential of the mature female,'' paid male students at
the University of Oregon $10 for each orgasm they or the
44-year-old woman experienced. Police said Wood, 60, recorded the
encounters and took photographs.
   The Southampton, N.Y., couple were cited by police Sept. 16 at a
Eugene hotel.
   Police said they had evidence the couple intended to carry on
their ``research'' at other West Coast campuses.
   Wood was suspended as director of anesthesiology at Southampton
Hospital on Long Island, N.Y., after the incident became public.
   The Woods were charged with prostitution after four students who
were asked to have sex with ``Nancy S.'' testified before a grand
jury. Among them was a 19-year-old man cited for prostitution after
he received money from the couple.
   Prosecutor Sean Hoar said the 19-year-old cooperated with
authorities and never was charged.
   Defense attorney Richard Urrutia blamed his clients' plight on
the media.
   ``All their actions were undertaken innocently and in good
faith, and it is a tragedy that they now come under a cloud of
suspicion and have been subject to sensational reporting in the
press,'' he said. ``We can only hope that this sorry episode does
not have a chilling effect on future research into areas such as
human sexuality.''
   Urrutia said the Woods never received any money in the
encounters, and that paying a token fee to scientific research
subjects is customary.
   Urrutia declined to discuss the origin of the research project,
and said he didn't know why the Woods traveled across the country
to conduct it.
   He said the couple pleaded guilty because they wanted to get on
with their lives.

<HEAD>Fatalities Increase On Rural Interstates</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fatalities have increased an estimated 31
percent on rural Interstate highways in states that increased the
speed limit to 65 miles per hour, a new government report says.
   But the report by the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration said not all of the increase can be attributed to
speed and higher death tolls in some states may be due to chance
because the number of fatalities is so small.
   The agency, in a report delivered to Congress on Monday, said
states are in the best position to make decisions on posted speed
limits and enforcement.
   ``The available data show that the number of rural Interstate
fatalities and the rural Interstate fatality rate increased after
the speed limit was raised to 65 mph,'' the report said.
   It estimated that fatalities on rural highways increased 31
percent from 1986, before the higher speed limit was allowed, to
1988 in those states that raised the speed limit during 1987.
   The agency estimated that one-third of the fatalities were due
to increased traffic on the highways and two-thirds to other
factors, primarily greater speed.
   The report is based on highway fatality data provided by the 40
states that increased the speed limit on rural Interstates, which
Congress allowed beginning in 1987.
   Deaths on Interstates totaled 2,836 in 1988, or about 6 percent
of total fatalities. Interstate highways have a lower fatality rate
per miles traveled than other roads.
   Overall, traffic fatalities increased in 1988 by 1.5 percent
over 1987, from 46,390 to 47,079, the highway safety agency said.
But the fatality rate, which considers miles traveled, remained
stable at the 1987 rate of 2.4, which is the lowest in history, the
report said.

<HEAD>Orders for Durable Goods Off Slightly in September</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Orders for ``big ticket'' durable goods edged
down 0.1 percent in September and would have fallen even further
except for the second biggest increase in defense orders on record,
the government reported Tuesday.
   The Commerce Department said that orders for durable goods,
items expected to last three or more years, dropped by $147 million
last month to a seasonally adjusted $126.68 billion following a 3.9
percent rise in August.
   Without a huge 56.3 percent surge in defense orders, the
weakness in manufacturing would have been even more pronounced.
Excluding defense, orders would have fallen by 3.9 percent, the
biggest decline in civilian demand since May.
   Analysts attributed the big jump in military demand to a rush by
the Pentagon to place orders in September, the last month of the
government's budget year. They said the weakness in the civilian
categories provided fresh evidence that U.S. manufacturing is
headed into a slowdown.
   ``This is a weak report showing that the industrial sector has
lost momentum,'' said Bruce Steinberg, an economist at Merrill
Lynch. ``The only thing that held orders up in September was
defense and that category is volatile and not indicative of
underlying economic trends.''
   In September, manufacturing employment took its biggest nosedive
in seven years and many economists predicted that the weak orders
report would lead to more layoffs in coming months.
   ``This report points to a sharp slowdown in industrial activity
during the final quarter'' of the year, said Gordon Richards,
senior economist at the National Association of Manufacturers.
   Many economists pointed to a big 5.6 percent drop in demand for
non-defense capital goods in September as a particularly ominous
sign, especially since it followed an even larger 10.3 percent
August decline.
   This area, which reflects business investment plans, has been
one of the key sources of strength over the past year.
   David Wyss, chief financial economist at DRI-McGraw Hill, said
that he believed the country would be able to avoid an out-right
recession in the coming year but that the economy had entered a
period of very sluggish growth with the unemployment rate likely to
rise from its current 5.3 percent to perhaps 5.7 percent by next
summer.
   ``We are not going to have a recession, in part because the
Federal Reserve is easing credit conditions, but we will have a
very significant slowdown in the economy,'' Wyss said.
   In September, orders in the transportation category fell by 4.7
percent to $34.78 billion following a 7.3 percent August increase.
The September weakness was attributed to a $3 billion decline in
orders for new cars as manufacturers cut back on production plans
in the face of sluggish sales.
   The weakness in transportation was masked by the huge surge in
defense orders, which totaled $12.39 billion last month. It was the
second largest percentage increase on record, after a 68.3 percent
jump in June 1988 pushed orders to a record monthly level of $13.8
billion.
   Orders in the machinery category that includes computers dropped
2.4 percent to $22.13 billion, while orders for other electrical
machinery were up 6.3 percent to $20.64 billion.
   Orders for primary metals such as steel were up 1.9 percent in
September to $11.49 billion.
   Shipments of durable goods fell 2.8 percent to $124.8 billion
following a 9.6 percent rise in August. Both the September decrease
and the August advance in shipments primarily reflected swings in
the transportation sector.
   The 0.1 percent decrease in total durable goods orders was the
first decline since a 2.5 percent drop in July.

<HEAD>White House Looking for Legislation to Exercise Line-Item Veto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The White House is looking for legislation on
which President Bush can seek to exercise a line-item veto as a
test case, presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said today.
   Such a move _ vetoing just one part of a bill while leaving the
rest intact _ would produce a major constitutional confrontation
with the Democratic majority in both the House and the Senate.
   Some legal scholars contend that such powers are implicit in a
president's power to veto legislation; others argue against such an
interpretation.
   Now, Fitzwater said, the administration is willing to force the
issue and prompt a court case, believing the president has such
powers and should be able to exercise them.
   ``We are looking for a vehicle that might be a suitable test
case. We haven't found one yet,'' Fitzwater said.
   The theory is to ``try to do it and see if it works....You claim
you have the authority and you just do it,'' Fitzwater said.
   He said forcing such a test had been considered for some time,
beginning in the Reagan administration.
   Both former President Reagan and Bush called for a
constitutional amendment to ensure the president line-item veto
powers, and it has long been an item on conservative agendas.
However, the proposals never made it very far in either
congressional chamber.
   Vice President Dan Quayle told an audience in Chicago on Monday
that the president was ``inclined to do so'' if he can find an
appropriate bill in which to veto individual provisions while
signing the rest into law.
   Quayle said line-item veto power would allow the president to
reduce federal spending.
   Meanwhile, Fitzwater said the president will continue to press
for a cut in the tax on capital gains and plans to meet with groups
of mostly Democratic senators this week to lobby for the plan,
which has already passed the House.
   Fitzwater said the administration has the votes to pass a cut _
if it can have a straight majority-rule vote on the measure in the
Senate.

   An outbreak of bubonic plague has
killed five people in central Botswana, the Health Ministry said
Tuesday.
   The ministry said 19 other people had contracted the disease in
the Boteti district in the past two weeks, but the outbreak
appeared to be subsiding.
   Health workers were trying to kill rodents and fleas that might
be carriers of the bacterium.
   One primary school near the town of Orapa had been closed after
two pupils there died of the disease, the ministry said.

   A new TV movie on Richard Nixon's final days
as president won't seem tough enough to his detractors, say
journalists Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward.
   ``Nixon-haters won't be happy with the portrait because you're
feeling sorry for him,'' Woodward said in the Oct. 28 issue of TV
Guide magazine. ``You see the crushing loss, and it's just very,
very clear that ... it hurt.''
   The movie is based on Woodward and Bernstein's book, ``The Final
Days,'' which was published shortly after the release of a film
based on their first book, ``All the President's Men.''
   When the book version of ``The Final Days'' came out, Bernstein
recalls, ``we were attacked on about every ground you can imagine.''
   The book, like the TV movie to be shown Oct. 29 on ABC, includes
a scene in which Nixon and then-Secretary of State Henry Kissinger
knelt on the rug in prayer.
   ``Our colleagues in the press had trouble believing that what we
had written was true. Particularly the scene about Kissinger and
Nixon,'' Bernstein said. ``Of course, everything in the book has
since been confirmed by the principals in their own memoirs.''

   Former astronaut Scott Carpenter says
humans need to consider ``a mission to planet Earth'' before
heading to other solar systems.
   ``The planet, our home, is in desperate need of intensive
care,'' he said Monday night at the University of
Wisconsin-Platteville. ``The future of everything we do depends on
this planet.''
   The mission to this planet is needed to combat the problems that
are endangering Earth's ecology, he said.
   Carpenter, one of the original seven Mercury astronauts on the
United States' first manned mission in space, said 30 million acres
of tropical rain forests are being destroyed each year, 70 million
acres of forest in the industrial north are badly damaged, new
deserts are being created and holes in the ozone layer are getting
larger.

   Lorin Maazel said he has agreed to extend his
contract as music director of the Pittsburgh Symphony to the end of
the 1995-96 season.
   The announcement was made Monday at a news conference in Berlin,
where Maazel said he was giving up his future conducting dates and
canceling about 40 scheduled recording sessions with the Berlin
Philharmonic Orchestra.
   Maazel, who is on the final week of a four-week tour to the
Soviet Union and Europe with the Pittsburgh orchestra, is extending
his tenure beyond his current contract, which expires at the end of
the 1991-92 season.
   In a telephone interview with The Pittsburgh Press, Maazel said
he will gradually increase his time with the Pittsburgh Symphony,
which he now leads in eight subscription weeks a season.
   Maazel was a top candidate for the job of chief conductor of the
Berlin Philharmonic. That post was awarded two weeks ago to Italian
conductor Claudio Abbado, music director of the Vienna State Opera,
who will succeed the late Herbert von Karajan.
   In addition to giving up his work with the Berlin orchestra,
Maazel said he would also give up his position as resident music
director of the Orchestre Nationale de France, effective Aug. 31,
1991.

   Pinetop Perkins received the key to his
Mississippi Delta hometown Tuesday as he was honored for 60 years
of boogie-woogie piano and soulful songs.
   ``It feels good to me,'' said Perkins, 76. ``One thing, it
brings back memories.''
   His mother died in Belzoni in 1963, and this is the first time
he's come back to his hometown since, Perkins said.
   In addition to receiving the key to the town from Mayor Tom
Turner Jr., Perkins' life work was praised in concert by the guest
of honor and his band, Little Mike and the Tornadoes.
   Perkins recalled the first time he heard blues on a juke joint
piano as a youngster.
   ``I listened at that, and I said, `I got eight fingers and two
thumbs _ I figure I can do that,'' he said.
   Perkins left Mississippi in his early 20s. His first stop was
Helena, Ark., where he was one of the King Biscuit Boys on the
``King Biscuit Flour Hour'' broadcasts, playing with Sonny Boy
Williamson. In the early 1960s, he settled in Chicago.

   A 25-year-old travel book written by
newly-named Nobel laureate Camilo Jose Cela is getting a new run.
   The University of Wisconsin Press plans to reprint the book by
Cela, the Spanish writer whose violent images sprang from the civil
war that killed more than a million of his countrymen.
   In the 25 years since the translated book ``Journey to
Alcarria'' was originally published, it has sold original 2,000
copies, officials said.
   The final copies of the original printing were sold Thursday,
the same day Cela won the Nobel Prize for literature.
   Press director Allen Fitchen said Monday plans have been made to
reprint 2,000 to 5,000 translated copies of ``Journey to Alcarria.''
   ``The world was caught by surprise that the Nobel Prize went to
Cela,'' Fichen said. ``We were caught by surprise that we had been
a publisher of a Nobel Prize winner. We're delighted.''
   The Swedish Academy cited Cela, 73, for his ``rich, intensive
prose, which with restrained compassion forms a challenging vision
of man's vulnerability.'' It said his novel ``The Family of Pascual
Duate'' was the most popular Spanish fiction work since ``Don
Quixote.''

   Hundreds of children sang ``Happy
Birthday'' to the United Nations on Tuesday, then grabbed forks and
plates and dug into a mammoth birthday cake topped with 44 candles.
   The party commemorated United Nations Day, marking 44 years
since the U.N. Charter came into force on Oct. 24, 1945.
   The organization has even been accused of suffering from
middle-aged spread. The United States, Japan, Soviet Union, and
European governments have put the organization on a stringent
fiscal diet, with a zero-growth budget.
   But the world organization can look back on the last two years
as having been one of its most productive phases in years.
   U.N.-mediated accords led to the Soviet withdrawal from
Afghanistan, completed this year. The war front between Iran and
Iraq is still quiet since both nations agreed to a truce last year.
   ``There are growing signs that international relations may be
entering a new and more positive era,'' said Secretary-General
Javier Perez de Cuellar. ``There is, however, no reason for
complacency.
   ``Conflicts still persist in many parts of the globe. The
buildup of arms has not ceased,'' he said. ``Far too many people
still live in absolute poverty without adequate food or shelter and
face discrimination.''
   In 1988, the nearly half-million men and women who have worn the
blue beret in U.N. peacekeeping operations were honored with the
Nobel Peace Prize.
   On Nov. 7, Namibia will begin the first free elections in its
history under U.N. supervision, which are expected to end in the
territory becoming the world's newest nation next year, after being
held by South Africa since 1915.
   Central American nations have asked the United Nations to
oversee their regional peace agreement. This week, the Security
Council is expected to approve a U.N. border patrol force to cut
off Contra rebel infiltration into leftist Nicaragua, and shipments
of weapons to leftist rebels in El Salvador.
   Diplomats were moved from the General Assembly Hall to a large

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration today called
``extraordinary'' admissions by the Soviet foreign minister that
its invasion of Afghanistan was illegal and that a radar
installation violated the anti-ballistic missile treaty.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater praised Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard Shevardnadze's candor, calling it ``a step in the
right direction'' for arms control.
   Shevardnadze, in a speech Monday to the Supreme Soviet
legislature, said the decision under the late Soviet leader Leonid
Brezhnev to send troops into Afghanistan was a ``gross violation''
of Soviet law and ethics.
   He said the Krasnoyarsk radar station in Siberia was a violation
of the 1972 anti-ballistic missile treaty and would be dismantled.
The United States had argued for years that the massive
installation violated the 1972 ABM treaty.
   Fitzwater said of Shevardnadze's admissions: ``They're
extraordinary.''
   ``It's difficult to say what grand meaning they have, but it
certainly seems like a step in the right direction in terms of
glasnost ... and an environment for improved progress on arms
control and any other number of issues,'' he said.
   Fitzwater, who was also former President Reagan's White House
press secretary, said that, ``As the spokesman who stood here for
any number of years talking about the ABM treaty violation of the
Krasnoyarsk radar and talking about the occupation of Afghanistan,
the acknowledgements yesterday by the foreign minister are fairly
extraordinary.''

   Government agents in at least two dozen countries
illegally killed tens of thousands of people in 1988, Amnesty
International said Wednesday.
   Also, 1,903 prisoners were executed under death penalty laws in
35 countries last year, the highest number of such executions since
1981, the London-based organization said in its annual global
survey of human rights abuses.
   It cited alleged violations in 133 countries, ranging from the
activities of death squads in Latin America to the harassment of
church groups in China, the mistreatment of imprisoned Aborigines
in Australia and the lengthy pre-trial detention of a Puerto Rican
independence campaigner.
   The report said more than half the world's governments tortured
or mistreated prisoners and one-third of them jailed prisoners of
conscience, whom Amnesty International defines as those locked up
for the non-violent exercise of their human rights.
   The report was written before many of the sweeping democratic
reforms in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union.
   An accompanying summary touched only briefly on the June killing
of hundreds, perhaps thousands, by Chinese troops in Beijing to
quash the students' pro-democracy protest.
   It called those killings, and the killing of hundreds of
civilians by Sri Lanka's security forces, ``striking examples of
continuing extrajudicial executions this year.''
   The report said the victims of illegal killings last year were
government opponents, members of ethnic or religious groups, and
civilians living in areas of military operations.
   It said they were gunned down in groups or shot by snipers,
blown up by explosives, stabbed, strangled, hacked to death or
poisoned. Many were tortured to death. In Colombia, Guatemala, El
Salvador, Syria and the Philippines, victims were often mutilated
before being killed, the report said.
   It said governments made ``enormous efforts'' to conceal
evidence of such killings, but details were reaching the
international community more rapidly than ever before.
   ``Killings are carried out at night, when the victims are alone,
or in remote rural areas where even large-scale troop movements can
be undertaken unobserved,'' the report said.
   ``In urban areas, specialized squads are trained to function in
secrecy and are authorized to conduct operations in areas under
curfew and police control.''
   Amnesty International said many such killings occurred during
armed conflict within countries, including Afghanistan, Ethiopia
and Burma.
   ``Warfare makes it easier to evade accountability; not only is
access by independent observers limited but the dead can be
characterized as combatants ... or as the unavoidable civilian
casualties of war,'' the report said.
   Amnesty International said many people became victims simply
because they lived in areas whose overall population was seen as
the enemy.
   It said Iraqi forces attacked the Kurdish population with
chemical weapons, killing 5,000 men, women and children in Halabja.
Survivors of chemical attacks were often summarily executed, and in
villages near the town of Duhok, more than 1,000 executions in one
day were reported, it said.
   Many killings occurred during or after anti-government
demonstrations, Amnesty International said. It expressed concern
about the Israeli-occupied territories where more than 300
Palestinian civilians were killed in 1988; Algeria, where at least
176 demonstrators died; and Tibet, where Chinese police killed
dozens of pro-independence demonstrators.
   Amnesty International said it documented prisoners of conscience
in 76 countries in 1988.
   Among the worst offenders cited were Turkey, where thousands
were detained for political reasons, including hundreds of
prisoners of conscience, and Greece, where conscientious objectors
to military service were in prison.
   However, 1,566 prisoners of conscience were released worldwide
during 1988, or one in every three cases taken up by Amnesty
International. More than half the 300 known prisoners of conscience
in the Soviet Union in January 1988 were released by the end of the
year.
   Detainees were held without charge or trial in more than 75
countries, and torture and ill-treatment was reported in 94, it
said.
   Filberto Ojeda Rios, a member of a Puerto Rican independence
organization, was held in Connecticut for 32 months on charges of
armed robbery, it said. A federal court finally ordered his release
on bail, but he was arrested again, charged with a new offense and
again held without bail, it said.
   Amnesty International said he was held ``in virtual
incommunicado detention'' with only limited access to lawyers.
   Amnesty International, which opposes the death penalty as cruel
and unusual punishment, said 1,240 people were sentenced to death
in 58 countries last year.
   It said those figures contain only confirmed cases and believes
``the true figures are certainly higher.'' In Iran, for example,
142 executions were announced, but Amnesty International said it
learned of at least 1,700 secret ones.

   Consumers in the future may find Macintosh
computers easier to buy than red McIntosh apples, thanks to the
chemical scare that led growers to stop using the growth-regulator
Alar.
   Consumers will have to learn not to judge an apple by its color,
industry experts say, because without Alar it will be difficult to
achieve the ripe reds of the past.
   ``Appearance in the future will not be as important as condition
and eating quality,'' said John O'Donnell, marketing director of
the New York and New England Apple Institute in Westfield, Mass.
   This is the first year that Alar, labeled a possible carcinogen
by a consumer group in February, was not widely used on the
nation's apple crop.
   Uniroyal Chemical Co. voluntarily removed Alar from the market
last summer, and the federal government has taken steps to ban it.
   Alar was sprayed on apple trees because of its ability to keep
fruit on the tree longer. That extended the harvest time, allowed
development of a deeper red coloring in McIntosh and other apples
and retained their crispness in long-term storage. Alar also
prevented skin splitting on Red Stayman and Winesap varieties
without altering taste.
   Now that the 1989 crop is being harvested, growers report that
red apples are not as red, that the McIntosh crop is down, and that
Staymans are cracking more, ruining them for supermarket sales.
   The immediate effect of doing without Alar is obscured in
Washington, which will produce about 60 percent of the nation's
supermarket apples, because the state is harvesting a bumper crop.
   But Charles St. John, spokesman for the Washington Apple
Commission, noted that apples in the half-billion-dollar Washington
crop have less internal firmness this year.
   The future is more troubling for Washington growers,
particularly in warm areas like the Columbia River basin.
   Alar was needed to grow high-quality apples in those warmer
climates, said Jack Watson, Washington State University extension
agent for Franklin County.
   ``In warm climates you don't get a red apple and red seems to
sell apples,'' Watson said.
   That means growers in those areas are going to have to shift
away from older varieties and plant ``something that isn't red,''
Watson said.
   Apples from warmer climates also will not store as well,
especially after nine or 10 months in storage, said Steve Drake of
the U.S. Department of Agriculture research center in Wenatchee.
   Other apple-growing regions also face problems.
   In the Virginia-West Virginia-Pennsylvania region, which grows 4
percent of the nation's fresh-market apples, growers are
experimenting with other varieties to supplement the mainstay Red
Delicious, said Clayton Griffin of the Virginia Apple Board.
   Red Stayman apples, which split without Alar, make up 10 percent
of Virginia's $50 million apple crop, she said.
   The McIntosh has been a mainstay of the New York-New England
region, although the McIntosh crop this year was down to 7.1
million bushels from the projected 8.3 million, largely because of
weather, O'Donnell said. In the future, industry officials predict,
the variety will account for just 40 percent of the region's crop,
instead of the current 55 percent.
   New York is the nation's second-largest apple producer, at 10
percent, while the New England states combine for about 4 percent.
   The extra time on the tree that Alar produced was important in
the Northeast because many New England growers rely on visitors to
pick the fruit from orchards.
   ``Without Alar you have now cut the four-week picking time to
two weeks,'' O'Donnell said. ``Economically you've lost half your
ability to have the public come into orchards.''
   Michigan supplies about 7 percent of the nation's apples, and
growers there aren't expecting much effect from the loss of Alar
because they haven't used it in recent years, said Dave Wade of the
state Department of Agriculture.
   The remainder of the nation's apple production is scattered
across several other states.

<HEAD>Reagan Throws First Pitch in Japan, Nearly Hits Batter</HEAD>

   Ronald Reagan threw the first pitch in a Japanese
championship baseball game Tuesday, nearly hitting the batter, and
his wife, Nancy, inaugurated the Japanese chapter of her anti-drug
program.
   The former president met with two former prime ministers and, at
a reception for Americans working in Japan, praised the
``ever-growing closeness'' between the two nations.
   A capacity crowd of 56,000 at the Tokyo Dome cheered as Reagan
tossed the first pitch in the third game of the Japan Series, the
Japanese version of the World Series, from about halfway between
the mound and home plate.
   The one-time sportscaster wound up and fired a ball that nearly
hit Daijiro Ohishi of the Kintetsu Buffaloes on the posterior.
   Reagan laughed and waved to the cheering crowd, Ohishi backed
away and the visiting celebrity tossed another ball over the plate.
   Announcements during the game between the Buffaloes and the
Yomiuri Giants asked fans for donations to victims of last week's
San Francisco earthquake ``to promote U.S.-Japanese relations.''
The quake, which measured 6.9 on the Richter scale, struck shortly
before the scheduled start of the third game of the World Series in
San Francisco.
   Mrs. Reagan spoke to a group of experts on preventing drug abuse
about the importance of action on the narcotics problem. Drug laws
are strongly enforced in Japan and there is comparatively little
abuse, except of barbituates.
   ``People in Japan still think that drugs are not a serious
problem,'' said Fumiyo Mizushi, secretary-general of Just Say No
Japan. ``Mrs. Reagan said that attitude is very dangerous.''
   He said clubs would be formed in schools to raise awareness
about drugs.
   Reagan, 78, is on a nine-day visit at the invitation of the
government and Japan's largest media conglomerate, Fujisankei
Communications Group.
   Fujisankei has said it is spending about $7 million on the trip,
which it hopes will help improve U.S.-Japanese relations.
Fujisankei officials have refused comment on reports that the
Reagans are being paid $2 million.
   Except for meetings with Japanese officials Monday and Tuesday,
Reagan is spending his time in appearances planned by Fujisankei,
which owns television, radio and newspaper companies.
   The former president had lunch Tuesday with Yasuhiro Nakasone
and Noboru Takeshita, both of whom served as prime minister during
his eight-year presidency.
   ``I asked Mr. Reagan what he has been doing since he stepped
down, and he said he has been traveling around the country giving
speeches and playing sports,'' Nakasone said afterward.
   ``We said we've been involved in various election campaigns and
in sports. We all agreed to do our best to remain active.''
   At an evening reception sponsored by U.S. Ambassador Michael
Armacost, Reagan said the ever-growing involvement of Americans and
Japanese in each other's societies was ``how it should be.''
   ``We admire each other's culture, we understand our differences,
we learn from each other and we build friendships and partnerships
which enrich our lives,'' Reagan said.
   He did not comment on economic friction, which has increased as
more Americans see Japan as a threat.
   On Monday, Reagan met with Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu and
Emperor Akihito. The emperor gave him one of Japan's highest
awards, the Grand Cordon of the Supreme Order of the Chrysanthemum,
for promoting free trade and friendship.

   Amnesty International said Wednesday it
investigated allegations of prisoner mistreatment in the United
States and raised concerns about one inmate's lengthy pre-trial
detention in 1988.
   In its annual global survey of human rights abuses, Amnesty
International reiterated its opposition to capital punishment and
said the 11 prisoners executed in the United States last year
raised the total since 1977 to 104.
   The death row population grew to an unprecedented 2,182
prisoners in 34 states by the end of the year, it said.
   Amnesty International said it investigated reports that
prisoners in several state prisons had been ill-treated, including
the Michael Unit of the Texas Department of Corrections where
guards allegedly beat prisoners who were handcuffed and kept in leg
irons.
   The warden of Michael Unit informed Amnesty International that
no such incidents had occurred, the report said.
   Amnesty International said it also looked into reports that
prisoners in the Administrative Control Unit of the Southern Ohio
Correctional Facility were shackled and chained to cell fixtures.
Others were alleged to have been sprayed with chemical mace and
high-pressure water and left in empty, unheated cells for several
days.
   Prison authorities denied that prisoners had been ill-treated
but admitted that shackles, chains and mace were used for
restraining purposes, Amnesty International said.
   The organization said it also concluded that conditions in the
High Security Unit of Kentucky's Lexington Federal Prison were
substandard. The unit has since been closed.
   A federal court also ruled it was unconstitutional for two women
convicted of politically motivated offenses to be held in the unit.
   The court ordered their transfer into the general prison
population, saying conditions in the unit at times ``skirted
elemental standards of human decency.''
   Amnesty International's observer at the court hearing submitted
a report saying: ``Amnesty International concluded that the
conditions of confinement constituted cruel, inhuman or degrading
treatment. It found that the prisoners' prolonged isolation,
humiliating strip-searches and additional restrictions had a
detrimental effect on their physical and mental health.''
   Amnesty International also raised concerns about Filberto Ojeda
Rios, a Puerto Rican independence supporter held in pre-trial
detention in Connecticut for 32 months on armed robbery charges.
   A federal court ordered his release on bail in May 1988, saying
``due process cannot tolerate any further pre-trial detention,''
but he was arrested again three months later and charged with a new
offense of assault relating to his original arrest in 1985. Ojeda
Rios was denied bail and again placed in detention.
   Amnesty International said it was concerned his lengthy
pre-trial detention may have undermined his right to be tried
within a reasonable period or else be released.
   Amnesty International said it also asked California Gov. George
Deukmejian to order an inquiry into a former member of the Black
Panther Party serving a life sentence in California for a 1972
murder conviction.
   Elmer ``Geronimo'' Pratt may have been denied a fair trial
because of his political activities, Amnesty International said. It
said new evidence obtained after Pratt's trial indicated he was
targeted for ``neutralization'' by the FBI between 1968 and 1971
because of his political activities.
   It said the evidence also revealed the chief prosecution witness
was an FBI informant and that the FBI planted informers in Pratt's
defense teams.
   A 1985 court hearing dismissed Pratt's motion for a new trial,
ruling that the chief prosecution witness had been an FBI contact,
not an informer, and that Pratt had not suffered as a result of the
surveillance on his defense team. In June 1988 the Ninth Circuit
Court of Appeal also turned down his appeal on technical grounds.
   Amnesty International said Deukmejian told them he was without
the ``authority, ability and resources'' to order an inquiry.

   An engineer hired to investigate the
earthquake-triggered collapse of an Oakland freeway was fired after
just four days because of statements he made to a newspaper.
   A former state engineer, meanwhile, said the pillars supporting
Interstate 880's upper deck collapsed because they didn't meet
accepted safety standards at the time the freeway was built 32
years ago.
   Gov. George Deukmejian on Monday fired structural engineer Ian
Buckle, who had been asked to conduct a special inquiry into the
fatal collapse.
   The dismissal follows staunch criticism of the California
Transportation Department by Deukmejian after the freeway
collapsed, killing dozens of people.
   Transportation officials have said they were as surprised as
Deukmejian that the Oct. 17 earthquake sent the top level of
Interstate 880 crashing down.
   The governor reiterated that he was never told the structure was
a severe quake hazard. State engineers said they didn't believe the
structure, or those like it, would fall in a quake.
   A state expert on soils stability, Glenn Borchardt, questioned
one state engineer's conclusion that soft ground beneath the
freeway was not a big factor in its failure.
   Borchardt said the largely clay subsurface probably
``amplified'' the quake, a condition that could have been avoided
had pilings been driven to bedrock when the freeway was built.
   Deukmejian said his staff told Buckle, who works at the National
Center for Earthquake Engineering and Research in Buffalo, N.Y.,
that he could not head an inquiry into the collapse because he had
expressed ``a viewpoint'' in an article in the Los Angeles Times on
Thursday.
   Telephone calls to Buckle's home and office went unanswered
Monday.
   In the article, Buckle wrote: ``Now is not the time to be
knocking Caltrans. Rather, it's time to push for more funds'' for
earthquake safety. Buckle, has performed other consulting work for
California.
   On Sunday, when Deukmejian first publicly expressed concern
about Buckle, the engineer declined to comment except to say he
wrote the Times piece before he was asked to head the inquiry.
   The Republican governor said he would replace Buckle with
someone who can be ``totally impartial and independent.''
   Buckle last week inspected the wreckage and said it collapsed
because it was ``an unfortunate combination of an old structure on
soft ground.''
   Chief state engineer Bill Schaefer said his department could not
have warned the governor about the possibility of I-880 collapsing
because his engineers felt it would not fall apart in a quake.
   Deukmejian said he has always approved spending for earthquake
safety, and seemed to fault the department for not seeking money to
expedite a three-phase multimillion-dollar bridge stabilization
program that began after the 1971 San Fernando quake.
   While declining to comment directly on Deukmejian's criticism,
Schaefer and top structural engineer Jim Roberts defended their
department's failure to prevent the freeway collapse. During a news
conference, Roberts said: ``Is it my fault? I was in college when
this freeway was built, it was designed to the technology of the
day.''
   Roberts also dismissed a section of a 1982 report to then-Gov.
Jerry Brown that said the freeway could collapse from bad ground,
which could even turn to liquid.
   Roberts, who earlier suggested the soft ground played a role,
said his department geologist told him the structure's pilings were
driven to ``a very hard strata of compact sand, and he (the
geologist) said soil liquefaction is not a problem in that area.''
   But Borchardt, who wrote the 1982 section of the report for the
Governor's Emergency Task Force on Earthquake Preparedness, noted
that the pilings were not driven to bedrock, an expensive endeavor
given its depth of several hundred feet in the area.
   ``When pilings are not sitting on bedrock, you get
amplification'' of the earthquake waves, he said. ``Obviously, if
it had been built on bedrock, it would not have collapsed,'' he
said.
   The former state highway engineer, Jim See, who now heads the
Pleasant Hill Public Works Department, said the columns' design
should have included lateral bars running through the pillars like
steel grids, holding the vertical columns steady during a major
quake.
   See said the bracing that was missing is described as a
necessary structural ingredient in columns in the 1952 engineers'
manual distributed by the Concrete Reinforcing Steel Institute, a
non-profit Chicago trade organization.
   Roberts acknowledged that the amount of lateral reinforcement
built into the columns might have been inadequate. But he insisted
that the double-tiered portion of I-880 had been built in
accordance with what the building code required in 1957.
   ``How significant they are is something for the governor's
investigation team to determine.''

   Thirteen thousand doctors have signed a petition
asking a medical supply company to stop using surgical staplers on
dogs when training its salespeople, organizers said today.
   The company, U.S. Surgical Corp. of Norwalk, Conn., has been a
subject of protests by animal rights groups. The staplers can be
used in some cases in place of stitches.
   Eight participants _ along with Rusty, a mixed golden retriever
they said was rescued on its way to U.S. Surgical _ appeared at a
Manhattan news conference before leaving for Norwalk, where they
hoped to present the petition to company officials.
   ``We will turn them away,'' said Leon Hirsch, president of U.S.
Surgical. ``They are not welcome in our facility. ... There's been
too much animal rights terrorism.''
   ``This organization is a sham front,'' said Hirsch. ``They're a
pseudo-medical group of animal rights activists.''
   Dr. Neal D. Barnard, a Washington, D.C., psychiatrist and
president of the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine,
contended U.S. Surgical laboratories kill about 1,000 dogs a year
after practicing stapling techniques on them.
   ``Former participants have reported that the strength of the
staples was tested by attempting to lift the dogs by their staples
and by attempting to tear the stapled organs apart,'' said Barnard.
   Barnard and other doctors and veterinarians said U.S. Surgical
trains its salespeople with dogs in order to get a jump on
competitors like the 3M company, which does not use dogs.
   U.S. Surgical says the dogs are anesthetized.
   Physicians Committee members said most medical students learn to
use instruments by observing other physicians and by practicing on
cadavers or fake, foam rubber organs, making the use of dogs
unnecessary.

   Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe Arens has
notified Secretary of State James A. Baker III that his government
accepts a U.S. plan for Palestinian negotiations, with two
reservations, the Israeli embassy said today.
   One proviso is that Baker provide assurances that the Palestine
Liberation Organization will not participate in the talks. The
other is that any Israeli meeting with Palestinians before
elections are conducted on the West Bank and in Gaza would be
restricted to arrangements for the balloting, said Ruth Yaron, the
embassy spokeswoman.
   Baker's spokeswoman, Margaret Tutwiler, said: ``The (Arens)
letter reinforces what we believe _ that they are engaged and they
are working really hard to try to bridge these gaps.''
   Ms. Tutwiler said all parties had ``tough decisions to make.''
She added: ``We are hopeful we can deal with all of their concerns
and launch an Israeli-Palestinian dialogue. They key now is to get
an agreement on a framework that will enable us to launch the
dialogue.''
   At the same time, Ms. Tutwiler declined to describe Arens'
letter as acceptance or rejection of Baker's approach to
negotiations.
   Arens' letter outlining his government's position was delivered
by Ambasador Moshe Arad after Baker returned Monday from a speaking
trip to San Francisco
   ``He is not optimistic or pessimistic,'' a U.S. official said
after Baker read the letter. ``He is realistic.''
   Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, meanwhile, told reporters
during a tour of the Golan Heights that ``Israel will agree to the
plan after the changes we proposed are accepted.''
   He called the exchange with Baker positive. ``I don't see any
large gap between our views and the proposals of the secretary of
state, but there are some differences,'' he said.
   The prime minister added that ``in a few days we will know if
there is an agreement or not.''
   However, members of the opposition Labor Party, which supports
the Baker proposal without reservations, said they would stage a
walkout in parliament to protest the government's stand.
   ``I don't see anything in Baker's proposal that needs to be
changed,'' said Labor leader Shirom Peres.
   Arens informed Baker in the letter that Israel ``accepted
basically'' his five-point proposal for a meeting with
Palestinians, Mrs. Yaron said.
   Baker's proposal included an assurance that Israel would be
``satisfied'' with the composition of the delegation and it
assigned Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak a middle-man role of
consulting with the PLO.
   However, Mrs. Yaron said Arens also requested what she called
two ``tactical changes.'' One would assure Israel that the PLO
would not participate in the meeting and the other would limit the
agenda to the election itself.
   Shamir, Arens and other members of the ruling Likud coalition
have been concerned from the outset that the meeting would turn
into a negotiating session. Shamir's election plan provides for
negotiations after the 1.4 million Palestinians on the West Bank
and in Gaza choose their representatives.
   The PLO, meanwhile, has rejected both the Shamir and Baker
proposals. It was not clear whether an Israeli-Palestinian meeting
could be held without at least PLO acquiesence.
   ``We have been saying all along that we do want to advance the
peace process,'' Mrs. Yaron told a reporter. ``However, we had two
concerns _ participation of the PLO and the agenda _ in order not
to set back the peace process.''
   Baker was expected to reply to Arens, but the Israeli foreign
minister was on a trip to Brussels, which could delay temporarily
further contact between the two officials.
   Last week, as Baker's drive to set up negotiations approached a
critical point, Shamir appealed for U.S. help in drawing
Palestinian Arabs into the election plan.
   Shamir, in a letter to Baker delivered last Wednesday, urged the
administration to help overcome ``intimidation'' keeping
Palestinians on the West Bank and Gaza from participating in the
prime minister's proposal for elections, diplomatic sources said.
   Shamir also asked Baker to try to enlist moderate Arab
governments, such as Morocco and Jordan, to join with Egypt in
trying to implement the elections proposal, said the sources, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Baker followed up the letter in a telephone coversation with
Shamir last Thursday evening and with Foreign Minister Arens on
Friday morning. He then went to his ranch in Wyoming for the
weekend and to San Francisco for the arms control speech on Monday.
   A senior U.S. official said on Friday that Baker was ``not going
to pursue this from here to eternity.'' Also, the official said,
Baker was giving the Palestinian problem ``100 percent, but there
could be a limit to how long you continue.''
   But the diplomaic sources questioned the notion that Baker was
reaching a dead end.
   ``You have a dialogue at the very highest level. It is very
substantial. They are discussing substantial ideas that might lead
to a breakthrough,'' said one source.
   Baker's five-point proposal was put forward privately last month
in an effort to implement Shamir's election plan. While only the
fifth point _ a meeting be held with Israel and Egypt before the
election _ has been officially confirmed, the four others are known
to include:
   _ Talks be held between Israel and Palestinians.
   _ The meeting is designed to hold elections.
   _ Israel is to be ``satisfied'' with the delegation's
composition.
   _ Mubarak is free to consult any Middle Eastern parties about
the makeup of the delegation.

   The government placed the capital and the port
of Callao under a 30-day state of emergency today, restricting
civil rights and giving the military broad powers to fight leftist
insurgents, an official newspaper reported.
   The move came less than three weeks before municipal elections
scheduled for Nov. 12, which Maoist Shining Path guerrillas are
trying to sabotage through a campaign of terror and assassinations.
   Police said rebels set fire to 10 public and private buses
Monday night in different areas in Lima Callao, five miles west of
here, after forcing passengers to get off. No one was injured in
the attacks, police said.
   The government also extended state of emergency restrictions in
the Andean province of Yauyos in the department of Lima, the
official government newspaper El Peruano reported. The government
on Monday announced new emergency restrictions in four other
provinces in Lima department, giving the military control over most
of the country's most populous department.
   State of emergency decrees now cover more than one-third the
area of Peru, including eight departments and several provinces.
More than half the country's 21 million people, including 7 million
in Lima and Callao, are affected.
   A department is the largest political subdivision in Peru and is
divided into provinces.
   The government has used state of emergency decrees to combat
terrorism since 1982. Among the restrictions implied in the decree
are suspension of habeas corpus rights, rights of free movement and
guarantees against search and seizure.
   The decrees remain in effect for 30 to 60 days and are routinely
extended.
   The Maoist Shining Path began its armed insurgency in 1980 near
the highland city of Ayacucho, 235 miles southeast of Lima. It
operates throughout the Andean highlands, in some coastal areas and
in the coca-producing jungles of the northeast.

<HEAD>Horses Suffer Malnutrition, Neglect on California Ranch</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   In one of Southern California's worst cases
of animal neglect in years, horses on a ranch have been so underfed
that they chew on wooden fence posts and eat their own manure.
   At least a dozen horses on the Allmond family ranch walk
painfully on unclipped hooves, sleep in their own urine in unkempt
stables and have swelled stomachs, a symptom of worms.
   Nearby ranchers have been complaining about the ranch to animal
control officials for months, but said nothing was done until
recently. They said it must have taken about a year for the horses'
conditions to deteriorate.
   ``This whole thing makes me sick,'' said Brigitte Richardson, a
horse breeder and one of several residents pressing Riverside
County animal control officers for action. ``Here we are sending
aid to foreign countries and this is happening in the heart of our
country.''
   For as long as anyone can remember, the ranch has been operated
almost single-handedly by Gil Allmond, who said he is 79 years old
but is believed by friends to be in his mid-80s.
   The ranch, about 65 miles southeast of Los Angeles, is owned by
Allmond's son, Ed Allmond, a certified horse show judge who animal
control officials said is now working with the county to set up a
feeding and veterinary schedule for the horses.
   Pressure on the county peaked Oct. 11, when one of the ranch's
horses _ a former champion show mare _ had to be destroyed after it
apparently was improperly fed.
   When a reporter visited the Allmond ranch last week, about 20 of
the ranch's 30 horses were so skinny their ribs, hip bones and
spines protruded. Wooden fence posts and the top of a gate had been
chewed away by the horses. Many of the animals were eating their
own feces.
   Some horses had matted hair and skin sores from lying in their
urine. Some walked awkwardly on hooves that hadn't been trimmed in
months.
   ``I've been working with horses for years, and I've never seen
anything this bad,'' said horse breeder Brian Seaman.
   The matter may be referred to the district attorney for legal
action.
   The elder Allmond denied that he has mistreated the animals and
said they are properly fed daily.
   ``Some of the horses are OK and some are not,'' he said. ``Some
are real old and are going to have to be destroyed. That mare (that
was destroyed) was 30 years old and just couldn't go on any more.''
   Ed Allmond, who lives in nearby San Jacinto, did not return a
reporter's telephone message Tuesday.
   Emmett Gibson, the county's chief animal control officer, said
action against the Allmonds won't be taken until a veterinarian
called in finishes a report on his inspection of the ranch earlier
this month.
   The ranch has emerged as one of southern California's worst
cases of animal neglect since humane officers in 1975 discovered
100 horses starving on breeder Rex C. Ellsworth's ranch in Chino.

   China's foreign minister urged Tuesday that a
speedy solution be found to border disputes between China and the
Soviet Union.
   Foreign Minister Qian Qichen spoke at a meeting with Soviet Vice
Foreign Minister Igor Rogachev, who is in Beijing for the fourth
round of talks on the border in 2{ years, the official Xinhua News
Agency said.
   The last round, held in Moscow in 1988, ended with the two sides
saying they had settled most differences over the eastern part of
the border, the scene of bloody clashes in 1969.
   A working group was set up to discuss the western border.
   The Soviet news agency Tass had said the fourth round was to
finish Sunday. Xinhua, however, has carried no reports on its work
and its brief dispatch Tuesday did not make it clear if the round
was still going on.
   The Soviet Embassy has refused to answer questions about the
talks.
   According to Xinhua, Qian said both sides should strive to
settle outstanding issues in a just and reasonable way and at an
early date. He said progress was made at past rounds but did not
comment on the fourth round.

<HEAD>Justice Department Issues Tightened RICO Guidelines</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Justice Department has tightened its rules
for bringing racketeering cases and for seizing defendants' assets
before trial, according to memos released Tuesday.
   A policy requiring approval by senior Justice Department
officials of efforts to seize a defendant's assets was imposed in
response to criticism of the tactic in several highly publicized
cases, according to one of the memos, which were sent to federal
prosecutors.
   The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization Act allows
prosecutors to obtain temporary restraining orders to seize assets
of defendants to ensure the funds are available if a jury orders
them forfeited as part of a verdict.
   But Assistant Attorney General Edward S.G. Dennis Jr. said
prosecutors should make clear in court that ``the government will
not seek to disrupt the normal, legitimate business activities of
the defendant.''
   ``Some highly publicized cases ... have been the subject of
considerable criticism in the press, because of a perception that
pre-trial freezing of assets is tantamount to a seizure of property
without due process,'' Dennis wrote in the June 30 memorandum.
   Another memo, by Assistant Attorney General Shirley D. Peterson,
head of the tax division, sharply limits the use of the RICO law in
tax-fraud cases.
   Mail-fraud charges may be sustituted for tax-fraud charges to
form the basis of RICO prosecutions ``only in exceptional
circumstances'' when a tax return is mailed to promote a
``tax-fraud scheme,'' she wrote in a separate memorandum.
   ``Charging a tax offense as a mail-fraud charge could be viewed
as circumventing congressional intent unless unique circumtances
justifying the use of a mail-fraud charge are present,'' Peterson
wrote.
   Dennis, who heads the department's criminal division, did not
mention any specific pre-trial asset seizures that prompted
criticism.
   But defense attorneys roundly criticized former Manhattan U.S.
Attorney Rudolph Giuliani for obtaining a court order seizing the
assets of a securities firm whose officers were charged with
racketeering.
   Defense lawyers contend that the government's forfeiture demands
drove the firm, Princeton-Newport Partners LP, out of business last
December.
   Jurors who convicted five Princeton-Newport partners and a sixth
defendant of racketeering charges in August awarded only $3.8
million of the $21 million prosecutors sought in forfeitures, with
$3 million coming from one defendant.
   Originally targeted at organized crime and drug traffickers, the
RICO law was used for the first time in the Princeton-Newport case
to prosecute securities dealers.
   It has since been used as a basis to indict 46 commodities
traders in Chicago. Michael R. Millken, the former head of Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc.'s ``junk bond'' department, is awaiting trial
next March on racketeering charges.
   Justice Department spokesman David Runkel said both memos
underscored existing department policy.
   But Dennis wrote that his memo ``implements new policy''
requiring approval by the Justice Department's Organized Crime and
Racketeering Section before prosecutors seek temporary restraining
orders to seize a defendant's assets.
   To get such approval, ``the prosecutor must show that
less-intrusive remedies (such as bonds) are not likely to preserve
the assets for forfeiture in the event of a conviction,'' Dennis
wrote in the memo, first disclosed over the weekend in Newsday, the
Long Island, N.Y., newspaper.
   He noted that ``the government's policy is not to seek the
fullest forfeiture permissable under the law where that forfeiture
would be disproportionate to the defendant's crime.''
   Forfeiture orders, Dennis noted, ``can have a wide-ranging
impact on third parties who do business with the defendants,
including clients, vendors, banks, investors, creditors, dependents
and others.''
   The new requirements were instituted ``to ensure that the rights
of all interested parties are protected,'' Dennis said.
   Runkel dimissed suggestions that Dennis' memo was issued in
response to tactics employed by Giuliani, who is now the
Republican-Liberal candidate for mayor in New York City. ``To the
best of my knowledge, the answer to that is no,'' Runkel said.
   Runkel noted that the government's asset-forfeiture actions in
the Princeton-Newport case were upheld in the courts.

   Uncle Sam's bathroom has been found.
   Archaeologists made the discovery on Ferry Street, site of the
house of 19th century meatpacker Sam Wilson, City Manager Stephen
Dworsky said. During the War of 1812, Wilson stamped his crates
``U.S.,'' leading to the military joke that the meat was provided
by ``Uncle Sam.''
   The archaeologists ``are down six feet, and you can literally
see what was the floor to the bathroom,'' Dworsky said.
   A park is being built on the site by Hannaford Bros., a
supermarket company based in Scarborough, Maine. The company is
building a store next to the park.
   Uncle Sam's house stood on the site from sometime in the 19th
century until 1971, when New York state demolished it to make way
for a road that was never built, Dworsky said. Hannaford bought the
site in 1988 for $277,000.
   When the park is finished, the house's foundation and bathroom
floor will on view to visitors, Dworsky said.

   Forget monthly payments and sky-high
list prices. About 40 bargain hunters camped out on a Westmoreland
County dealer's lot for a chance to buy cars for as little as $1.99.
   ``Obviously at $1.99 you don't make money. But the good will it
creates ... is fantastic,'' Les Dugan, general sales manager at
World Class Motors, said Monday.
   Tonya Stover of Apollo, her father and a friend occupied a 1979
Ford Pinto beginning around 2:30 p.m. Sunday. Their persistence
paid off when Stover bought the car Monday morning for $1.99.
   Raylene Pogoersckey of Arnold arrived at 3 p.m. Sunday but her
first choice, a 1980 Plymouth Volare for $69.99, was already spoken
for. She settled for a 1979 Pontiac Grand Prix priced at $499.99.
   Mike Madison of Plum got the Volare, which he said is probably
worth $1,000.
   ``You can't beat it,'' said Madison, a former used car salesman.
``Believe it or not, I have a Mercedes at home in the garage. This
is my winter ride.''
   Dugan said the prices ``return something to the community to
give people a chance to own a car.''
   The dealership offered 180 cars at prices ranging to $13,000.
Twenty-six were offered for less than $500. They carried no
warranties but Dugan said all of them were driven, not towed, onto
the lot.

   In case you missed the book, now you
can rent the video.
   Portions of ``The Old Farmer's Almanac,'' the outdoor planter's
bible and an institution for 198 years, will be available on
videocassette next month, providing home remedies, gardening tips,
offbeat features and weather forecasts.
   The hour-long tape is narrated by Willard Scott of NBC's
``Today'' and features comedian Jonathan Winters passing on home
remedies for toothaches and unconventional cures for the hiccups.
   There is also a look at how the almanac is put together.
   The program was produced by Brandwon Praxis Media Productions of
South Norwalk, using segments of some of the latest almanacs, said
Tim Clark, executive editor of the book, which is published by
Yankee Publishing Co. of Dublin, N.H.
   Clark was unsure of the financial arrangements between Braxis
and Yankee Publishing. He said almanac publisher John Pierce was in
Alaska and unavailable for comment.
   ``This is a video about the almanac, it's not the almanac,'' he
said.

<HEAD>Bar: Lawyers Look To Help, Not Exploit Quake</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   It's become a cliche that every disaster is
followed by a lawyer looking to turn tragedy into a quick buck. But
the State Bar says that doesn't seem to be the case with the
Northern California earthquake.
   So far, say officials of state and local legal organizations,
the response of lawyers to the Oct. 17 quake has been to offer free
or low-cost help to victims. Still, some lawyers stand to make
substantial sums down the road if they can provide liability for
damage, injury or death.
   ``We have not received by phone any complaints of unethical
solicitation (of clients), maybe in part due to the fact that we
got out there early and acted as a deterrent,'' Clayton Anderson,
director of investigations for the 117,000-member State Bar, said
Monday.
   ``On a national basis, historically there as been solicitation
in disasters. The legal profession is trying to put a stop to
that.''
   He said the bar distributed 6,000 leaflets to legal groups and
shelters for earthquake victims, spelling out rules on
solicitation: A lawyer can advertise services but can't go to an
accident scene or hospital to recruit clients, for example. A
toll-free number is listed for complaints.
   The California Trial Lawyers Association, whose members often
represent victims in injury lawsuits, has promised to guard against
ambulance-chasing. The office of famed injury lawyer Melvin Belli,
which says it will sue the state over the collapse of a freeway
overpass in the quake, says its attorneys are being careful not to
solicit clients.
   Meanwhile, lawyers are being mobilized to help those injured or
displaced by the earthquake.
   Volunteer lawyers will be stationed at clinics run by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, helping people apply for
benefits, said Nancy Clinch of the bar's Board of Governors.
   ``Within three hours of the earthquake, the State Bar was
organizing those clinics,'' said Ms. Clinch, who organized legal
clinics after a September 1988 fire that destroyed more than 200
homes in Nevada County. ``It's a wonderful opportunity for lawyers
to become involved.''
   ``We called people Saturday morning for a 2 o'clock clinic, many
still digging out of their own rubble, and people just dropped
everything and came down here,'' said Drucilla Ramey, executive
director of the Bar Association of San Francisco.
   Plans for clinics include presentations by federal disaster
officials, insurance representatives, landlord-tenant experts and
others. Then participants could speak with volunteer lawyers.
   More information is to be provided through toll-free telephone
numbers, already set up by several counties and the State Bar.
   Ms. Ramey said common concerns of tenants of damaged buildings
include rent obligations, getting security deposits back and rights
when buildings are demolished.
   Inquiries are also numerous about whether homeowner's insurance
covers earthquakes _ the advice is to file a claim in every case _
and about federal aid and the rights of employees, said lawyers.
   Most county bar associations have ongoing lawyer referral
programs. Although free service is normally provided only after a
financial screening, ``I imagine substantially all of it will be
pro bono (free) in the next few weeks,'' said Stephen Schadlich,
president of the Alameda County Bar Association.
   At some point, however, some lawyers will be talking about
lawsuits involving large sums of money.
   Richard E. Brown of Belli's office said it has been contacted by
relatives of people who may have died in the collapse of Interstate
880 in Oakland and are interested in suing the state.
   But Brown said Belli has not contacted any victims or relatives
_ ``he'd lose his license if he'd done that'' _ and instead has two
lawyers working full-time to offer free legal consultations on
earthquake-related matters. Fees would be charged only if a lawsuit
were filed.

<TEXT>
   Professor William Lutz can live with ordinary
euphemisms but his teeth gnash when a worker is told he has been
``dehired'' because the firm is experiencing ``negative employee
retention.''
   The employee has been fired in a layoff. But no one is willing
to say so, laments Lutz, who has written ``Doublespeak,'' a book
denouncing the use of words to conceal meaning.
   In Lutz's book, patients don't experience pain, just
``discomfort.'' Too much of that and ``terminal living'' may occur;
that's death. So is ``negative patient care outcome.''
   Lutz is willing to accept terms that gloss over unpleasant
truths _ ``passed away'' and ``rest room,'' for example _ but balks
when airlines announce that the plane is in no condition to fly:
   ``Ladies and gentlemen, because of a technical difficulty there
will be a change of equipment. Will you please deplane at this
time?''
   He doesn't like it, either, even when all goes smoothly and
``the equipment has arrived and is now being serviced prior to our
beginning the preboarding process.''
   But it is going just too far, says Lutz, when the Pentagon
refers to bombs that accidentally kill civilians as ``incontinent
ordnance'' or when lawyers write off a plane crash as ``the
involuntary conversion of a 727.''
   That, he says, is language ``designed to distort reality and
corrupt thought.''
   He thinks the practice is disgraceful, dangerous to democracy,
perverse and pervasive.
   Hard work, too. Doublespeak isn't just the natural work product
of the bureaucratic mind, he says; it is invented painstakingly, by
committees laboring to cloak what the words aren't permitted to say.
   ``Doublespeak is not a slip of the tongue, or language used out
of ignorance, but is instead a very conscious use of language as a
weapon or tool by those in power to achieve their ends at our
expense,'' he writes.
   Lutz, 48, teaches English at the Camden campus of Rutgers
University in New Jersey and heads the Committee on Public
Doublespeak of the National Council of Teachers of English.
   ``I have a real sense of outrage that something as beautiful and
powerful as language is being perverted,'' he said in an interview.
``I think that language is the most precious invention of human
beings.''
   Doublespeak is used by bureaucrats, like those who wrote a
government safety pamphlet that says: ``Exit access is that part of
a means of egress that leads to an entrance or an exit.'' But it is
also used by businessmen, advertisers, and educators who call
classrooms ``pupil stations'' and students from poor homes the
``economically non-affluent.''
   In the work world, people who are fired in doublespeak are
``dehired'' or ``non-retained'' or ``non-renewed'' or ``selected
out'' by firms that are having ``workforce adjustments'' or
``headcount reductions.''
   When Chrysler closed an operation in Wisconsin, it ``initiated a
career alternative enhancement program.'' Some 5,000 employees were
enhanced out of work.
   Simple words can also conceal truth. An advertisement that says
a remedy ``helps relieve cold symptoms fast'' says little, says
Lutz.
   ``Help'' doesn't mean it will succeed; ``relieve'' means it will
ease, not cure; ``cold symptoms'' are the runny nose, not the cold
itself; ``fast'' is a matter of judgment. The ad's promise boils
down to not much.
   In the business world, a black-and-white television is
``television with nonmulticolor capability'' and a used car is
``experienced.'' A gas station attendant becomes a ``petroleum
transfer engineer.
   The disease has crossed borders and is as old as the hills.
Julius Caesar described his brutal subjugation of another state as
``pacifying'' Gaul. Pacification reappeared as an American goal in
the Vietnam War.
   To Erich Honecker, the newly ousted leader of East Germany, the
Berlin Wall was an ``anti-fascist protective rampart.'' And when
the emperor of Japan called it quits in World War II, he told his
people, ``The war situation has developed not necessarily to
Japan's advantage.''

   Folks in Boston and Chicago may have
been out of luck if they tried to buy fresh California strawberries
last Wednesday and Thursday.
   Electrical failures after last Tuesday's earthquake meant
125,000 crates of berries, many bound for East and Midwest markets
from this farming community, were left unrefrigerated overnight.
   By the time they reached their destinations, they were spoiled.
   A week after the quake forced more than 1,000 residents into
tents and shelters, employers still are assessing their losses.
   ``I would not be one to say losses will be minimal. Under the
circumstances, they might be considered minimal, but to the
individual they are pretty severe,'' said Santa Cruz County
Agricultural Commissioner Leonard Kraft.
   An estimated $5 million to $6 milion worth of crops were bruised
or damaged when the quake toppled storage bins, according to Ron
Tyler of the Agricultural Extension Service.
   And losses at the plants that process 40 percent of the
country's frozen foods won't be known until workers determine how
much of the produce shaken from 30-foot-high shelves can be
repacked and how much must be thrown out.
   Most companies say those losses should be small, indicating that
while production lines and shipments of frozen broccoli,
cauliflower and Brussels sprouts have been slowed, the industry
isn't devastated.
   ``I don't think there's a doubt the industry will rebound,''
Kraft said. ``It's the heart and soul of the area.''
   More than $7 million worth of packaged vegetables spilled onto
the warehouse floor at the Richard A. Shaw Inc. frozen food
company. But President Jeffrey Shaw said he expects most of the
vegetables can be repacked.
   ``We're hoping $500,000 (in losses) is a worst case,'' Shaw
said. ``We're hoping we can get it down to a 5 percent loss of
what's on the floor. Our focus is going to be on shipping
merchandise, ship now and clean up later. We've got to ship to
create space to speed up the clean-up.''
   Strawberry packers are expecting very little loss. ``The season
ends Nov. 1, so we're fortunate it happened at this time. There's
not really much to recover from since we're near the end anyway,''
said Herb Baum, president of Naturipe Berry Growers.
   But stalled production will be felt strongly by the 7,000
residents who harvest crops from local fields or work in the food
processing plants here.
   The personal losses they have suffered have been compounded by
the lack of a place to work. Green Giant expects to be closed for
at least two weeks, leaving 600 people out of work, and Shaw Inc.
is operating with about 200 of its 900 employees.
   ``Not only have they lost their jobs, but there are no
alternatives left in town,'' Jeffrey Shaw said.
   Even the agriculture industry, which makes up 65 percent of the
community's economy, may not be strong enough to rebuild the town
by itself.
   ``We have quite a large population in the city who work in
agriculture, and all the downtown store owners depend on people to
spend their paychecks at the store,'' Kraft said.
   ``A lot of people's homes are destroyed,'' he added. ``Those
people may work in agriculture, but that's not going to help.''

   Rescuers found one body today and planned
an extensive search for 22 missing workers in the smoldering rubble
of a plastics plant where fiery explosions killed at least two
people and injured 124.
   The body was found by six firefighters and safety experts who
ventured into the devastated Phillips Petroleum Co. complex, where
explosions Monday afternoon flung debris five miles and shook the
ground 25 miles away.
   The emergency response team decided it was safe to send a larger
search party in later today, Sheriff Johnny Klevenhagen said. He
said they would need heavy equipment to move the body and search
for others in the rubble.
   ``It's going to take a long time. This is not going to be easy.
Some of the buildings are gone _ not there,'' Klevenhagen said.
   Authorities varied on whether there could be survivors.
   ``You always hope for the best. Our fingers are crossed,'' said
Phillips spokesman Jere Smith.
   ``We don't think there's anybody alive in there,'' said Dr. Paul
Pepe, director of Houston's emergency medical services.
   Doctors treated 124 people for injuries. Thirty-five were
hospitalized, up to six of them in critical condition, Pepe said.
Some had severe burns, he said.
   Survivors said they had less than half a minute's warning to get
out of the plant after a reactor began leaking flammable gas that
ignited in a huge fireball.
   ``I thought it was the end,'' said Billy Ridenour, a 35-year-old
worker. ``I was thinking, `Run till you die.'''
   A thin column of smoke was rising from the plant this morning as
several members of an emergency response team went inside. Phillips
officials said the fire was contained and the smoke and gas
released were not toxic, but that the team would have to judge
whether it was safe to send in a larger group of rescuers.
   ``The fire is just about out. That was the objective
overnight,'' said Jere Smith, a Phillips spokesman at the scene.
``With daylight now we can start to account for the unaccounted.''
   Twenty Phillips employees and at least three contract workers
were unaccounted for, Phillips Petroleum President Glenn Cox told
reporters late Monday. The body of a worker was found at the plant,
but Cox did not have other details.
   ``We know these people, we pray for their safety,'' Cox said.
``It's a difficult time for all of us.''
   Seismologists at Rice University in nearby Houston said the
blast appeared to be the equivalent of 10 tons of dynamite. The
first explosion could be felt as far away as 25 miles. Several
explosions followed.
   ``It was like somebody just dropped an atomic bomb,'' said Kelly
Manerly, a pipefitter at the plant, which makes 4.5 million pounds
a day of plastics like those used in milk jugs and toys.
   The blasts buckled a ceiling and blew out cafeteria windows at
an elementary school about a mile away. No one was injured, but the
school's 700 pupils were sent home.
   The first explosion at Phillips' Houston Chemical Complex, on
the Houston Ship Channel just off Highway 225, occurred early
Monday afternoon.
   Maintenance worker Roby Clemons said employees had 20 seconds to
escape after a warning message was broadcast over the plant's
emergency radio.
   Workers said they heard a hissing sound and saw a white cloud.
The explosion that followed knocked them off their feet.
   Many then saw a fireball.
   ``It looked like somebody set a boulder on fire and was rolling
it towards us,'' said Terry Crowson, 37, a construction worker.
   ``Everybody was a-duckin', a-dodgin' and a-runnin','' said D.E.
Sonny Mann, 49, an iron-worker foreman who was able to account for
his 150-man crew. ``We outran the fire.''
   ``I never saw people run so fast,'' added Clemons.
   Firefighters fought the blaze by pumping water from a sewage
treatment plant and the nearby ship channel. The fire was brought
under control within five hours but continued to burn. A two-mile
section of the heavily-traveled channel was closed for seven hours,
authorities said. No ships reported damage.
   Officials didn't immediately know what caused the explosion.
   Phillips environmental director Bill Stoltz said a seal blew out
on an ethylene loop reactor, releasing ethylene-isobutane, a
compound used in making plastics. The reactor is built of tubes
where the key chemical reactions take place.
   The ethylene is fed to the plant through a pipeline from Sweeny,
about 75 miles southwest of the plant in this town if 100,000
people.
   The pipeline was shut down after the blast, but up to 90,000
gallons of ethylene and plastics were believed to have burned, said
Sam L. Price, Houston Fire Department spokesman.
   More than 900 people work in shifts at the plant, built in 1948
on the 800-acre complex, said Dave Dryden, Phillips spokesman at
company headquarters in Bartlesville, Okla.
   The blast sent pieces of metal flying through the air.
   Glen Dickey, who lives five miles from the plant, said he came
home from lunch to find a 6-foot piece of metal in a tree.
   ``Pieces of stuff were falling out of the sky,'' Dickey said.

<HEAD>Finland Seeks New Identity During Gorbachev Visit</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Finland, which has lived in the shadow
of its huge Soviet neighbor since World War II, is hoping President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev will finally recognize Finnish neutrality
during a visit this week.
   Such a declaration could once and for all bury the notion of
``Finlandization'' and open a new chapter in relations, analysts
said.
   Gorbachev, accompanied by his wife, Raisa, arrives Wednesday for
a three-day visit crammed into a busy year of traveling that has
included trips to Britain, Cuba, Romania, East Germany, West
Germany and France.
   Gorbachev will meet with President Mauno Koivisto and the two
countries will sign agreements on bilateral trade, joint ventures
and transboundary pollution control.
   The two leaders also may sign a joint declaration which, for the
first time, describes this country as ``neutral Finland.'' Earlier
communiques have said only that Finland ``aspires toward a peaceful
policy of neutrality.''
   Finland was an autonomous Grand Duchy of Russia for 100 years
before the 1917 Russian revolution, when Vladimir I. Lenin granted
Finland its independence in gratitude for hiding him from Czarist
forces.
   Gorbachev is scheduled to pay tribute to Finland's assistance to
the founder of the Soviet state with a visit Wednesday to a room
where Lenin stayed while in Helsinki.
   He also is scheduled to meet with Finnish business leaders,
visit Parliament and travel to the northern city of Oulu, dubbed
``The City of Technology.''
   Gorbachev badly needs Western technology and goods to revive the
stagnant Soviet economy that suffers from chronic shortages of
consumer goods and food, and Finnish companies have a long
tradition of doing business with the Soviets.
   Finland is the Soviet Union's No. 2 trading partner among
capitalist countries, and it imports 80 percent of its oil from its
Communist neighbor. The fall in international oil prices has thrown
off the two countries' trade balance but several trade agreements
will be signed during Gorbachev's visit, including on joint
ventures and Finnish involvement in the industrial development of
the Soviet Union's strategically important Kola Peninsula.
   The two countries have become friends and major trading partners
despite a bloody history. The Soviet Union and Finland fought two
wars from 1939-44, and Finland was forced to cede large parts of
its eastern territory.
   In 1948, the two countries signed the Treaty of Friendship,
Cooperation and Mutual Assistance, and Finland adopted a neutral
stance which depended heavily on good relations with its eastern
superpower.
   Traditionally, the Soviets have been reluctant ``to openly and
publicly'' recognize Finland's neutrality, said Raimo Vayrynen, an
international politics professor at the University of Helsinki.
   ``There have always been qualifications,'' he said in an
interview. Vayrynen said he welcomes reports that the declaration
to be signed during Gorbachev's visit will contain ``unequivocal
recognition of our neutrality.''
   Despite Vayrynen's hopes, the Soviets are not hinting yet of any
change in their position. Andrei S. Grachev, deputy chief of the
Soviet Communist Party's Central Committee's international
department, said the Kremlin has no reason to re-define Finland's
neutrality.
   ``Several decades of cooperation between Finland and the Soviet
Union have strengthened mutual trust and the value of Finland's
neutrality in our bilateral relations,'' Grachev said.
   After World War II, Soviet interference in Finnish domestic
politics was common, and the term ``Finlandization'' was coined to
describe this country's allegiance to the Soviets.
   But relations have become more open and natural.
   ``Certainly there has been a big change,'' Vayrynen said.
Referring to Gorbachev's policy of openness, he continued,
``Glasnost has alleviated some of the anxieties that existed about
the potential consequences of Finns taking a stand on issues that
might offend the Soviets.''
   Grachev said the earlier denigrating use of ``Finlandization''
was ``short-sighted'' and that other countries could use
Soviet-Finnish relations as a model.
   ``The Finlandization of Europe may be regarded nowadays as the
spreading and development of the whole European process which has
proved in the past years to be of mutual benefit practically to all
states in both parts of this continent,'' Grachev said.

<HEAD>Raymond Chandler's Final Detective Novel To Be Made Into Movie</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``Poodle Springs,'' the mystery novel that
was started by Raymond Chandler and finished by Robert B. Parker,
will be made into a movie, Universal Pictures has announced.
   Chandler, who had completed only four chapters of ``Poodle
Springs'' before his death in 1959, wrote six other Philip Marlowe
mysteries including, ``The Big Sleep'' and ``The Long Goodbye.''
   The Chandler estate selected Parker to finish ``Poodle
Springs.'' Parker has published 17 novels featuring a Boston
private eye named Spenser _ the same detective on which the
``Spenser: For Hire'' TV series was based.
   Universal announced Monday that Academy Award winning
producer-director Sydney Pollack and producer Jon Avnet will tackle
the ``Poodle Springs'' project with Michael Blake adapting the
novel for the big screen.
   ``We have the opportunity to make one of the classic movie
mysteries of all time,'' said Tom Pollock, chairman of MCA Motion
Picture Group.
   Pollack won an Oscar in 1985 for ``Out of Africa.'' Avnet has
produced movies including ``Risky Business.'' Blake wrote the
screenplay for the still-unreleased movie, ``Dances With Wolves,''
starring Kevin Costner.

<HEAD>Earthquake Knocks Out ABC's World Series Coverage</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NBC climbed back on top of the Nielsen
ratings and ABC slipped to the bottom in an unusual week in which
the San Francisco earthquake rocked television schedules.
   ABC seemed certain to repeat its victory of the week before,
when it ended NBC's 68-week winning schedule. But the earthquake
last Tuesday forced postponement of the World Series just as the
third game was getting underway in San Francisco's Candlestick Park.
   NBC's ``Cheers'' was first for the week ended Oct. 22, closely
followed by ``The Cosby Show.'' ABC's highest-ranked show was its
Monday Night Football game between the Los Angeles Rams and the
Buffalo Bills.
   NBC was first in the A.C. Nielsen Co. survey with an average of
14.1. CBS was second with 12.6 and ABC third with 12.1. The ratings
represent the percentage of the nation's 92.1 million household
tuned into a program.
   ABC's coverage of the games, and counterprogramming by NBC and
CBS, fell by the wayside. ABC, unprepared with alternative
programming, dropped to third place. None of its entertainment
programs made the Top 10 because its strong Tuesday comedy lineup
was pre-empted, first by the planned World Series and then by
special coverage of the earthquake.
   The Tuesday night pre-game show tied for 44th place.
   The networks' special coverage of the earthquake was not ranked
by Nielsen because it was unscheduled and not sponsored. The
network evening news shows, however, had nearly five million extra
viewers who tuned in because of the quake. ABC was first, followed
by CBS and NBC.
   The San Francisco Giants and the Oakland Athletics are not due
to resume World Series play until Friday. The resumption depends on
the weather and repairs to the ballpark.
   Here are the Top 10: NBC's ``Cheers,'' NBC's ``The Cosby Show,''
NBC's ``A Different World,'' NBC's ``Golden Girls,'' NBC's ``Dear
John'' and CBS' ``60 Minutes'' tied, NBC's ``Empty Nest,'' NBC's
``Unsolved Mysteries'' and CBS movie ``Do You Know the Muffin
Man?'' tied, and ABC's Monday Night NFL Football.
   The networks all had follow-up coverage of the earthquake with
special reports and in regularly scheduled news magazine show.
Here's how they did: ABC's ``20-20'' in a tie for 20th place, CBS'
``48 Hours'' 29th, ABC News special report 34th, ABC's ``PrimeTime
Live'' in a tie for 37th place, and NBC's special report 43rd.
   Fox Broadcasting's ``Married...With Children'' was its
highest-rated show. It tied for 46th place. Its next highest show
was ``Open House'' in a tie for 69th place.
   ABC's ``World News Tonight'' led the news shows with a rating of
11.5. CBS was second with 11.2 and NBC third with 10.7. CBS was
rated for only four nights because the night of the earthquake it
pre-empted its West Coast news feed for special coverage.
   The lowest-rated show of the week was CBS' ``Saturday Night with
Connie Chung.'' Here are the five bottom shows: NBC movie ``Stuck
With Each Other,'' ABC's ``Mr. Belvedere,'' ABC Mystery Movie
``B.L. Stryker,'' ABC's ``Living Dolls'' and CBS' ``Saturday Night
with Connie Chung.''

   Stock prices declined broadly in heavy trading
today as the collapse of the UAL Corp. buyout helped unnerve an
already shaky market.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials spiked downward as much
as 85 points in the morning before partially rebounding. It was
down 48.36 points to 2,614.55 by 2 p.m. EDT.
   In addition to the UAL buyout failure, analysts said traders
were worried about lower-than-expected corporate profits in the
third quarter and signs of economic weakness in the government's
latest report on factory orders.
   Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones by 11 to 2 on the
New York Stock Exchange, with 246 higher, 1,348 lower and 313
unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 164.94 million shares as of 2
p.m. on Wall Street.
   UAL plunged 32| to 145} by 2 p.m. UAL's board of directors said
late Monday it has decided to keep the parent company of United
Airlines independent for now as it examines alternatives to a
$300-a-share employee-management buyout plan that collapsed earlier
this month.
   The announcement that the UAL group was unable to get financing
for the deal helped trigger a 190.58-point drop in the Dow
industrials on Oct. 13. The market bounced back last week, gaining
a record 119.88 points total, but the Dow average slipped back by
26.23 on Monday.
   Analysts said the news that UAL would remain independent
affected other transportation stocks and generally triggered the
morning selloff. Computerized program trading also contributed to
the decline.
   In Chicago, the plunge in stock prices sent S&amp;P 500 stock-index
futures down the 12-point limit permitted under ``circuit-breaker''
rules designed to slow heavy market selloffs. Index futures prices
rebounded after trading resumed.
   The government's report today of a slight decline in durable
goods orders during September today did nothing to dispel concerns
over lower-than-expected corporate profits for the third quarter.

<HEAD>Hungarians Have a Democracy, With the Same Old Worries</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALEX BANDY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hungarians proclaimed a democracy and
honored the long-maligned 1956 revolt, but on Tuesday they had the
same leaders and the same problems: how to tell truth from lies and
live on $100 a month or less.
   A day after the heady celebration, a pensioner said he hoped for
``a price freeze, so we can live better.'' With annual inflation
above 20 percent and the government lifting food subsidies under
market reforms, his wife said, they can afford meat only on Sundays.
   An estimated 100,000 Hungarians cheered the new democratic
republic Monday when acting President Matyas Szueroes proclaimed it
from the Parliament balcony.
   That evening, even more filled the same square to honor the
anti-Stalinist revolt of 1956, which was crushed by Soviet troops.
   They applauded proclamations by former revolutionaries that real
democracy will be achieved only when Hungarians can elect leaders
of their choice.
   Although the Communist Party has changed its name, one-party
rule remains in force, at least until planned multiparty elections
planned for next year.
   Hungary has committed itself on the path to democracy.
Parliament adopted legislation last week creating the legal
framework for the first free elections in more than 40 years and,
before that, the Communist Party disbanded in favor of a new
Socialist Party committed to democracy.
   Economic survival was a common topic on the street Tuesday. Many
Hungarians place their hopes in Premier Miklos Nemeth, a
41-year-old economist who is introducing market forces and private
ownership.
   ``For the past 40 years, we have heard nothing but lies,'' the
retired couple said in unison. They and others interviewed would
not give their names.
   The husband said lies continued, but at least ``the leadership
has finally expressed the truth about what happened here 33 years
ago.''
   He and his wife live on a small pension and constantly face
poverty, which official statistics say threatens 25 percent of
Hungary's 10.6 million people.
   Even for working people, the average wage barely exceeds the
equivalent of $100 a month.
   As the retired couple spoke, a woman nearby counted bottles she
had collected to redeem for the deposits. Westerners notice an
increasing number of pensioners stopping them on the street to ask
for change.
   An 18-year-old cook said Hungary had experienced ``tremendous
changes'' in the past year, but ``I will be optimistic when I don't
see any Communists anywhere.'' He expressed faith in Nemeth's
ability to run the government.
   A store clerk said, ``I trust Nemeth because he's relatively
young and a technocrat.''
   The premier, who studied at Karl Marx University in Budapest and
at Harvard, is committed to a market-oriented economy as part of
any reform program.
   A pensioner from a village nea Lake Balaton said economic reform
would allow ``ordinary Hungarians to have a better future once a
market economy is created.''
   He said he had to supplement a monthly pension of 5,000 forints
(less than $100) with part-time work at the post office and selling
produce from his garden.
   A young book vendor said the changes this month indicated
``something has begun to move, and we just have to hope concrete
changes will come.''

<HEAD>Segregationist Commission Supplied Speeches For Mississippi Officials</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JACKSON, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mississippi's segregationist watchdog
agency supplied state lawmakers, officials and educators a standard
speech promoting segregation to deliver before Northern audiences
in 1963.
   The speech claimed separate drinking fountains and bathrooms
were necessary because many blacks lacked morals, education and
proper hygiene, according to a copy obtained by The Clarion-Ledger.
   ``There are many Negroes, of course, who have reached plateaus
of citizenship,'' the speech says. ``They are personally clean,
have high morals and are educated. However, they are still in the
minority.''
   The now-defunct, state-sponsored Sovereignty Commission spied
on, infiltrated and harassed civil rights groups during the 1960s.
It also funded the White Citizens' Council, an organization
established to promote segregation.
   Erle Johnston Jr. of Forest, who plans to describe the
commission and the events of the 1960s in a book, said he wrote the
speech and its accompanying answers to questions expected from the
Northern news media.
   Johnston, who usually accompanied the speakers, handled public
relations for the commission in the 1960s before serving as its
director from 1963 through 1967.
   Johnston defended the speech as appropriate for its time. ``We
were trying to let people know how things worked in Mississippi. We
didn't try to convert a soul. We just tried to tell them how things
worked,'' he said.
   Segregation in the 1960s was in its death throes and its
defenders ``resorted to any means of survival,'' said David
Sansing, a professor of history at the University of Mississippi.
   ``A society that discriminates and exploits will not mind lying.
It would just do whatever it had to do to justify a system that had
no defense,'' Sansing said.
   The commission paid air fare, meals and other expenses for the
volunteer speakers, who included a reporter from The
Clarion-Ledger, well-known in the 1960s for its hard line against
integration.
   Titled ``The Message From Mississippi,'' the speech claims
Mississippi blacks preferred segregationist ways.
   ``Many of our colored leaders, ministers, educators and
newspaper editors openly endorse the separate school system and
repudiate the outsiders who come into Mississippi to violate our
laws,'' the speech says.
   The questions and answers discuss two of Mississippi's most
infamous civil rights slayings, referring to both as ``unsolved
murders:''
   _Seven days after 14-year-old Chicago native Emmett Till
whistled at a white store owner's wife, his body was pulled from
the Tallahatchie River in Tallahatchie County on Aug. 31, 1955. He
had been beaten and shot once in the head.
   An all-white jury acquitted two white men of the killing.
   While Till's slaying ``was a crime of violence we deplore,'' the
speech says, what Till did was ``a very serious offense, although
it was not deserving of capital punishment.''
   _On April 24, 1959, in Poplarville, a mob of at least 23 white
men dragged Mack Parker, a black 23-year-old truck driver accused
of raping a white woman, from his jail cell, shot him, weighted him
with chains and threw his body in the Pearl River.
   The speech claims the killing took place because
``Mississippians had watched as court decrees stayed the execution
of a St. Louis Negro, Robert Goldsby, who shot down a white woman
as she was trying to protect her husband.''
   The speech also claims that the federal government was
responsible for the riot that resulted in two deaths following the
1962 admission of James Meredith into the University of Mississippi
as its first black student.
   ``There was no disturbance, no injury, no death, so long as the
state of Mississippi was permitted to be responsible for law and
order in Mississippi,'' the speech says. ``It was only when the
federal authorities acted hastily in firing tear gas into a group
of students and others that violence, injury, death and destruction
of property resulted.''

<HEAD>Palestinian Gangs Blamed For Murders</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HAITHAM HAMAD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NABLUS, Occupied West Bank (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   PLO-allied gangs with fanciful
names like ``Black Panther Brigades'' and ``Red Eagles'' are blamed
for most of the 20 murders here of Arabs accused of collaborating
with Israel.
   Israeli officials claim some gangs operate under direct order of
the PLO. But Palestinians maintain that at least some of the
murders have been carried out in defiance of PLO Chairman Yasser
Arafat.
   With 132 Palestinians killed for alleged collaboration in the
22-month-old Palestinian uprising, there are fears that the
executions are getting out of hand. Palestinians complain that
ordinary citizens are being intimidated by the frequent murders.
   In Nablus last week, the Red Eagles killed a 24-year-old
upholstery worker and wheeled his body through the streets of the
West Bank's largest city in a pushcart, presumably as a warning to
others.
   In the occupied Gaza Strip, a school guard was found burned to
death in his car Oct. 5 and graffiti signed by the ``Palestinian
Revolutionary Eagles'' took responsibility the slaying.
   A senior Israeli defense official on Tuesday confirmed a report
in The New York Times that security forces had discovered documents
linking the Revolutionary Eagles in Gaza to Yasser Arafat's
mainstream PLO faction Fatah.
   One letter quoted by the Times says slayings should be blamed on
the little-known Eagles group in order to deflect blame from the
PLO.
   The Times said, however, that the documents could be forgeries.
If genuine, the papers could give credence to Israel's repeated
arguments that Arafat is sponsoring murder despite his claim to
have renounced terrorism in December.
   Israeli officials have frequently cited the slayings of
Palestinians by fellow Arabs as reason for the United States to
halt its dialogue with the PLO, begun after Arafat's statement on
terrorism.
   The pace of the killings has quickened as the uprising has
dragged on without political gains. Of the 132 slayings by
Palestinians since the revolt erupted in December 1987, 110
occurred this year alone.
   At least 601 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli soldiers
or civilians during the revolt, and 40 Israelis also have died.
   Palestinian sources say the murders of some supposed
collaborators claimed by such groups as the Abu Jihad Phalangists
are ordered by opponents of Arafat's policies.
   The Red Eagles in Nablus are believed backed by the Popular
Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a radical Syrian-based PLO
faction that opposes Arafat's efforts to negotiate an agreement
with Israel.
   In Nablus, residents of the Yasmina quarter where the Black
Panthers operate say the gang is murdering people despite appeals
from PLO-backed uprising leaders and Arafat himself.
   They say the gang's members, believed to be 10 men ages 19 to
25, wander freely through the dark, twisting alleys of Yasmina,
often armed with knives, hatchets or pistols.
   ``People are scared to death,'' a 32-year-old Yasmina shopkeeper
said. ``They are afraid to leave their houses.''
   The shopkeeper, like others who agreed to discuss the Black
Panther slayings, would not allow his name to be used out of fear.
   Nablus residents and local journalists said the Black Panthers
have carried out 15 or 16 of the 20 slayings in the city, most of
alleged collaborators but also including prostitutes and drug
dealers who some activists consider enemies of the uprising.
   The Black Panthers are allied with Arafat's Fatah PLO faction,
but local Fatah officials say the gang's members are running out of
control, ignoring orders in uprising leaflets that any killings
must have the approval of the revolt's leaders.
   ``They are not educated enough to be judges. They are working
against the intefadeh,'' said one Fatah leader in Nablus.
   Two weeks ago, residents listened carefully to an appeal from
Arafat on the PLO's radio station in Iraq urging more control in
slayings of collaborators. They say the statement was clearly aimed
at the Black Panthers.
   Neither Arafat nor uprising leaders have condemned collaborator
killings outright, however, and there is widespread support for
killing Palestinians who endanger the lives of activists by
informing on them.
   Arafat, in an interview early this month with a London-based
Arabic-language newspaper, said he gave authority to uprising
leaders to order murders of those proven to be collaborators.
   ``The unified command has the right to kill all those who
cooperate with the enemy,'' he told the Al-Quds Al-Arabia.

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Emanuel Ungaro's sexy sirens have grown up into
savvy sophisticates for next spring's line of luxury ready-to-wear
clothes.
   As other designers showed bare skin and molded cutout clothes
for next spring, Ungaro's look was downright ladylike.
   Following his off-the-wall couture collection last summer, he
went to a looser, cooler mood. For this his many fans will be
happy. Not that there aren't curves for next season. His line
simply refines and streamlines some of his past fraught-with-detail
ideas and hourglass shapes.
   Even the draped bustier flowered silks and the flirty peplum
suits had a light touch. His patterns were softer, and the short
sheaths caressed the body rather than constricting it to look like
a vamp.
   The daytime separates, late-day black silk draped dresses and
resort wear were much better than the unconvincing evening clothes,
which resumed in a few sparkling lame drapes and black.
   Ungaro's high-powered shoulders have deflated into light padding
for shape, with some mildly puffy sleeves. But there's still plenty
of exuberance in fitted peplum or bolero checked jackets with pink
or yellow piping, flowered print crepe skirts in shades of orange
and blue.
   Some noteworthy touches for parties include the solid flared
ankle-length shiny jersey skirts topped with fabulous, softly
shaded paisley linen jackets and big pirate hats.
   Ungaro still flings colors and floral prints about like a zany
mixmaster. But his combinations are good: the wild-flower fitted
jackets, some with vests, look great with their sexy wrapped jersey
blouses, lean plaid or checked skirts. The waists are always
waspy-small and there is plenty of decollete to show off the chest.
   Ungaro's easier, softer mood also produced a raft of shifts and
smocky toppers with puffy sleeves, as well as some wonderful safari
suits with easy, cropped wide pants.
   They looked restful but beautifully cut with firmly belted
tunics and color combinations of prune, brown, violet and peach in
soft linens.
   At Guy Laroche, ready-to-wear designer Guy Douvier's sailor
looks won't rock any boats, but they're jaunty and wearable. The
organza-topped evening wear and sunny-side-up flower prints were a
youthful synthesis of the polite side of Paris clothes for next
summer.
   Not wildly original, the house of Laroche regularly makes the
grade with women who like to dress in quality-manufactured,
big-name lines for a little less money. Bernadette Chirac, wife of
the Paris mayor, was in the audience, and unfailingly chooses a
Laroche model or two.
   From smocky-topped sheer black and white print black-and-white
pajama outfits to the giant poppies on fitted pique suits, there
was a variety of colors and shapely lines in easy-to-wear clothes.
   The puffy and bowed organza toppers in hot yellow, turquoise and
Indian rose or shocking pink with black crepe draped sheaths or
lean pants are just in tune with the flouncy mood of Paris for next
summer.
   The sophisticated but young clothes at the small house of
Lecoanet-Hemant are still only available in a few shops, but their
line will come out en masse and with serious distribution next
spring thanks to Japanese backing.
   Their jazziest cruise wear came out in hot-colored Majorcan
print cotton pedal pushers with eyelet-edged overblouses.
   Women headed to Biarritz or the Ritz will like the curvaceous
silk bicolored cocktail suits and body-conscious linen dresses with
cut-outs.
   The original blue-brown damasked jeans teamed with a sequined,
pearled box jacket gave a surprising grace note to this lilting
collection.
   Madame Rose Mett, alias Torrente, launched a ready-to-wear line
called ``Miss Torrente,'' calling it ``timeless classics for
dynamic young women today.''
   Like most other designers, she took a cruise with some pretty
sailor suits, gold-buttoned at the shoulders. Her soft flower
prints, puffed-sleeve silk dinner dresses, navy coat dresses would
fit in nicely for lunch at Angelina's, the tearoom where she showed
the sleek, but unpretentious collection.
   Her nephew, Olivier Lapidus, son of Ted, put on his first big
tent show at the Louvre. The 30-year-old designer, who has studied
in Japan, has a fair way to go. The clothes weren't all bad, but
the show was awkward.
   According to Lapidus' sister, Rose Mett, Olivier is being backed
by the former Ted Lapidus money, as Lapidus himself bows quietly
out.
   Young Lapidus' cotton sundresses and shorts jumpsuits in rust,
saffron and other spicy colors looked fine for the Riviera if not
for the smarter Deauville set. The fitted plaid or chevron jackets
stiffened and curved out at hips were reminiscent of Jean-Paul
Gaultier, circa 1986.
   Better offerings in the uneven collection included the
grape-like print skirts with loose overblouses and the iridescent
graded mousseline tucked sleeveless sheaths.

<HEAD>Gramm Adds To Speculation He May Seek Presidency In 1996</HEAD>

   Conservative Republican Sen. Phil Gramm fueled
speculation Tuesday that he would be a candidate for president in
1996, saying he is considering a race for the White House at the
end of his second term in the Senate.
   ``If I ever heard the call, I wouldn't be afraid to answer the
call,'' Gramm, 46, said in an interview. ``I don't know whether it
will come or not. But I'll be listening.''
   ``I don't think that anybody who ever runs for city council
didn't ultimately think about running for president,'' said Gramm,
a first-term senator from Texas who is is up for re-election in
1990.
   Gramm said he remembers the day he was sworn into Congress for
the first time, on Jan. 3, 1979, and leaning over to fellow Texas
Rep. Kent Hance, who said: ``Reckon how many people standing here
will be speaker of the House? And I said, `Kent, the people
standing here think they're going to be president.'''
   Gramm was first elected to Congress as a Democrat. He later
resigned from the House, switched parties, and was elected to his
House seat in a special election.

   East Germans on Tuesday watched on live television
what would have been unthinkable just weeks ago: members of the
Communist-controlled parliament voting against the sole candidate
for president.
   In all, 26 lawmakers voted against Egon Krenz while another 26
abstained _ making up more than 10 percent of the 500-seat People's
Chamber.
   It was the first time in the nation's 40-year history that the
Communist Party-selected candidate for president got anything less
than a unanimous vote, and the first time such proceedings were
broadcast live.
   ``I always count badly,'' joked parliament speaker Horst
Sindermann as he fumbled while tallying the show of hands. ``I
don't want any falsified results.''
   While the 74-year-old Sindermann spoke in jest, the issue is
extremely serious for the nation's growing opposition groups. They
have accused the government of rigging regional elections last
spring.
   Sindermann, a lifelong Communist and survivor of the Nazis'
notorious Mauthausen concentration camp, said parliament should
``ban formalism'' in future meetings, suggesting more critical
debate could be allowed in the chamber.
   While some ``no'' votes may have been encouraged to give the
impression the party represents a variety of opinions, thereby
diluting opposition complaints the parliament is a rubber-stamp
body, Tuesday's vote was a radical departure from the unanimous
endorsements given all previous proposals by the ruling Politburo.
   ``Today's voting results speak for the necessary and new
self-confidence of this high chamber,'' Krenz said in his speech to
the parliament, in an apparent reference to the signs of dissent
among the ranks.
   Krenz reaffirmed the need for East Germany to stick closely to
its ``socialist foundation,'' but also spoke of the need for
renewal in the troubled nation.
   The 52-year-old East German leader also promised an
investigation into charges of police brutality during
demonstrations earlier this month. Authorities later acknowledged
for the first time there had been police attacks against peaceful
pro-democracy protesters.
   While only time will tell whether any substantive reforms are
undertaken, there already have been plenty of changes of style
since Krenz took over the more important job as Communist Party
chief a week ago.
   The broadcast of the voting for president displays the
government's attempts to show it is interested in more openness
after decades of repression of free speech.
   East German TV viewers watched pictures of a pro-democracy
demonstration of 300,000 in Leipzig on Monday, just hours after it
occurred. The same night, they were able to view the party's
ideology chief, Kurt Hager, accuse former leader Erich Honecker of
having encouraged ``elements of a personality cult'' during his 18
years of authoritarian rule.
   On Saturday, two senior party officials engaged in a heated
debate with demonstrators on an East Berlin street, and portions of
that exchange were broadcast on the main evening news.
   The change is enormous for TV viewers accustomed to being
flooded with government attacks on the West and official attempts
to contradict the West German TV shows that reach most of the
communist nation.
   State-run newspapers also have been filled with growing numbers
of critical voices, ranging from workers to artists.
   But while more people are being encouraged to talk openly, Krenz
and his colleagues have made clear that the Communist Party will
keep the ``leading role'' in the nation of 16.5 million people.

<HEAD>Death Toll in Ethnic Violence Reaches 300</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ethnic conflicts have killed 300 civilians and
injured 5,260 since they erupted 20 months ago, an Interior
Ministry official said Tuesday.
   The conflicts have prompted 360,000 people to flee their homes
in fear, including Armenians, Azerbaijanis and Meskhetian Turks,
said Col. Gen. Yuri V. Shatalin. Thousands of those homes have been
set on fire, he said.
   The Interior Ministry's troops and police have suffered 890
casualties, including 12 deaths, he said.
   Nagorno-Karabakh, the disputed territory at the focus of the
Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict, remains virtually blockaded, Shatalin
said.
   Only troop escorts permit the transport of food to the
ethnically torn territory, he said.
   Nagorno-Karabakh is a primarily Armenian enclave within
Azerbaijan. Armenians want it transferred to Armenian control and
Azerbaijanis are resisting fiercely.
   Azerbaijanis blockaded the republic of Armenia as well this
month, but troops were able to restore train traffic on the main
line to Yerevan, which runs through Azerbaijan.
   Shatalin said the Supreme Soviet legislature is due to decide
the fate of Nagorno-Karabakh soon, but he fears that any decision
will infuriate one side or the other.
   In the long-running Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict, Shatalin said,
the death toll is almost equally divided between the two
nationalities.

   U.S. medicine has the means to prevent 10,000
infant deaths each year, a Bush administration official told a
House panel Tuesday, but witnesses said obstacles keep many needy
women from proper care.
   The women who need early care the most can rarely fit that care
into their lives because poverty forces them to be preoccupied with
the struggle for personal survival, witnesses told the House Select
Committee on Children Youth and Families.
   Women who do seek care must travel long distances, changing
buses several times, for just a brief appointment, witnesses said.
   ``When one stops to consider the many problems they face,
including lack of basic necessities of life, long waits in a busy
clinic, to spend a few minutes with a doctor they have never seen
before, who uses technical terms they do not understand, and who
has to hurry to see the next patient perhaps the question should
not be `why don't they?' but `why do they?''' said Marilyn L.
Poland, a nurse and anthropologist on the faculty of the Wayne
State University Medical School.
   ``When they are faced with a choice between waiting for a
welfare check to buy basic necessities before the money is stolen
or to keep a prenatal appointment _ prenatal care becomes less
important,'' she said.
   Doctors, on the other hand, complain that they are hamstrung by
the rise in malpractice lawsuits and insurance premiums, especially
severe among obstetricians. Doctors also complain that Medicaid _
the state-administered health care system for the poor _ is
underfunded and caught up in red tape.
   Dr. James O. Mason, the acting surgeon general and assistant
secretary for health in the Department of Health and Human
Services, said the administration is trying to tackle the worst
problems.
   ``We estimate that we could save 10,000 of the 40,000 babies who
die each year, just by applying what we already know about things
like case management, outreach and home visiting,'' Mason said.
   There are 4 million babies born in the United States each year,
and the infant mortality rate _ the rate of infants who die within
a year of birth _ ranks this country 22nd among industrialized
nations.
   For the short term, Mason said, President Bush had submitted a
budget proposal that would expand the number of low-income women
eligible for Medicaid.
   Mason said that an interdepartmental commission he chairs will
give the White House recommendations in the next two months ``to
achieve better coordination among the extensive array of existing
programs.''
   Among the solutions being advanced is ``one-stop shopping'' in
which health and various social services are located under one roof.
   ``One-stop shopping is based on the premise that by allowing
eligibility for AFDC (welfare), Medicaid and other social services
to be determined at the same time and at the same site that health
care is delivered, there will be an increased likelihood that the
poor pregnant woman will receive the full range of services which
she needs and to which she is entitled,'' Mason said.
   Other witnesses said the issue is deeper rooted and must be
tackled in part with sex education beginning in grade school.
   Witnesses complained that the loss of neighborhoods and
neighborhood-oriented medical practices along with the growth in
government medical programs has also created a bureaucratic,
impersonal medical system.

   The House today moved toward passage of a
$2.85 billion relief plan for earthquake-damaged Northern
California after the White House announced its support for the
package.
   California lawmakers said the House bill wasn't nearly enough,
although it exceeded Bush administration estimates. But the White
House said President Bush would sign the bill.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the administration
could support the $2.85 billion relief package approved by the
House Appropriations Committee, calling it ``pretty close to ours.''
   Actually, new federal spending would be nearly twice what the
administration proposed. The president's budget office had said
that about $1 billion from existing federal programs should be
applied to quake relief so only about $1.5 billion in new spending
would be needed.
   ``We were hit by ten times the amount of explosive power of
World War II, including the atomic bomb,'' Rep. Nancy Pelosi,
D-Calif., whose district is in San Francisco, said as debate began.
``Please give us a chance to rebuild.''
   Before voting on the spending, the House voted 401-18 to strike
from the bill a provision exempting the disaster expenditures from
the Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction law. It was largely a show vote,
however, as the Gramm-Rudman calculations for this year are already
in place.
   The aid package could still be modified in the Senate, where
California's senators were ready to push for more money on
Wednesday. The bill was expected to get speedy passage, because it
was attached to a stopgap spending bill that must be passed before
Thursday to avoid a government shutdown.
   The House Appropriations Committee approved the aid plan Monday
and sent it to the full House for action today after rejecting the
California delegation's request for $3.8 billion.
   The spending committee rejected, 26-7, an amendment supported by
the state delegation and instead favored a proposal by chairman
Jamie L. Whitten, D-Miss., which essentially split the difference
between the state and White House plans.
   The committee approved $1.1 billion for the Federal Emergency
Management Agency to repair the devastation and $1 billion for the
Federal Highway Administration's emergency fund. Most of the deaths
and the worst damage from last week's quake in the San Francisco
Bay area was related to highways.
   In addition, $500 million would be given to the Small Business
Administration for emergency loans, and $250 million to President
Bush to spend at his discretion on other operations.
   Rep. Vic Fazio, deputy chairman of the House Democratic Caucus
and the California delegation's point man in the committee, said
the state would keep pressing in the Senate and on future
legislation to get more aid.
   ``Certainly, $2.8 billion is not bad,'' he said, but added it
was only a start. ``I don't think we've done the job yet.
   Fazio said he was especially concerned that the committee didn't
waive time limits for aid requests and other federal requirements
he said would be difficult for local authorities to meet.
   The California delegation request included the $1.1 billion for
FEMA and $1 billion for the highway emergency fund. But it wanted
$1.2 billion for SBA loans, a $100 million loan fund for poor
people, and a $400 million discretionary fund for the president.
   The White House, by contrast, said earlier that the SBA should
handle the disaster out of its existing funds, sought no
presidential fund, and wanted $600 million for the federal share of
repairing the highways. In all, the $2.5 billion administration
proposal included just $1.5 billion in spending above what was
already in the federal budget.
   Rep. Silvio Conte, R-Mass., the senior Republican on the
committee, and others at the committee meeting complained that the
powerful California delegation was asking for too much too soon.
   Rep. Bob Livingston, R-La., proposed and then withdrew an
amendment giving his home state $5 billion to compensate for all
the hurricanes it has suffered since the turn of the century.
   ``We are the Golden State and I think there is a certain amount
of jealousy,'' Fazio said afterward.
   The Californians said their estimates of the damage were more
than $7 billion and climbing.
   Committee Chairman Whitten said he would consider a request for
more money later.
   ``My whole pitch is to do something now, straighten it out
later, and don't waste any money in the meantime,'' he said. ``We
don't attempt to put all the money in here it's going to take.
   The California quake came on the heels of Hurricane Hugo, which
devastated U.S. islands and parts of the East Coast. Congress is
putting federal dollars to work on both disasters but in both cases
is dodging its budget rules, which say that the cost of new
programs shouldn't be lopped on the federal debt.
   But with Bush promising to veto any new taxes, and neither the
administration nor Congress offering any significant spending cuts,
the deficit is heading up again.

<HEAD>Commonwealth, Except Britain, Lines Up With U.S. On South Africa</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Leaders of the 49-nation
Commonwealth ended a stormy weeklong summit Tuesday, joining the
United States in giving South Africa six months to make drastic
changes before imposing sanctions.
   But dissent by Britain, a major South African trade partner,
left a gaping hole in the Commonwealth stance. It meant the
organization of former colonies, long painfully obsessed with
apartheid, still looks less of a threat than the United States to
the white-run government.
   Spurred by what she described as a ``important and positive
changes'' in South Africa, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
redoubled her lone battle against sanctions during the meeting.
   The upshot was a public sparring match between Mrs. Thatcher and
the others, led by Canada and Australia, after she issued _ without
telling them _ a lengthy repudiation of the summit's declaration on
South Africa announced Sunday.
   The declaration itself, which Mrs. Thatcher signed, incorporated
her objections to key provisions.
   They call for tighter financial measures immediately and
stipulate that a nine-member foreign ministers' committee will meet
in April to gauge how far South Africa's new president, F.W. de
Klerk, has moved.
   Canada and Australia, the declaration's main authors, thought
the dissenting note in the final text should have been enough _ or
at least Mrs. Thatcher should have told them she would be issuing a
separate repudiation.
   ``If we all behaved like this, every Commonwealth document would
be a shambles and it wouldn't be worth very much,'' said Canadian
Prime Minister Brian Mulroney.
   ``We weren't forewarned. We were blind-sided,'' he added as the
main antagonists let loose more recriminations at news conferences
before heading home Tuesday.
   Mrs. Thatcher countered that the others were being ``absolutely
ridiculous. ... These people who make use of free speech must
expect others to do the same.''
   The Commonwealth committee's meeting next April is to gauge
whether de Klerk has embarked on ``irreversible'' change by that
time.
   Canadian External Affairs Secretary Joe Clark, the committee
chairman, said that would include drawing up legislation to repeal
the basic tenets of apartheid that deny the black majority the vote
and enshrine racial segregation of land.
   Similarly, the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Herman J. Cohen
said this month that unless de Klerk takes legislative action by
June to end apartheid, the Bush administration will consider new
measures.
   The Bush administration will consult with Congress, its European
allies and Japan about tougher sanctions ``if, after the next
(South African) parliamentary session, there is very little to show
for it,'' Cohen told the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
   The next session of the white-dominated South African Parliament
begins in February and ends in June.
   Like the United States, the Commonwealth summit did not specify
any new measures. Anti-apartheid groups want coal, oil and South
Africa's huge diamond mining industry targeted.
   The United States has already left the Commonwealth well behind
on sanctions because Britain resists them and black southern
African countries, mainly Commonwealth members such as Zimbabwe and
Zambia, depend on South Africa economically.
   ``The Commonwealth in practice is in step with me ... in what it
says, we take a different view,'' Mrs. Thatcher commented in Kuala
Lumpur.
   Under U.S. legislation passed in 1986 after Congress overrode a
veto by then-President Ronald Reagan, Washington has imposed the
strictest embargoes of any major South African trading partner.
They include bans on the imports of fruit, vegetables, grain,
mineral fuels, uranium and radio active materials.
   South Africa's two biggest trading partners are Japan and Italy,
followed by the United States, West Germany and Britain.
   A list of 11 non-binding embargoes agreed to in 1986 by the
Commonwealth _ except Britain _ included a ban on air links,
agricultural products, tourist promotion and imports of uranium,
coal, iron and steel.
   Britain imposed only a few token measures as a gesture to the
Commonwealth, which South Africa quit in 1961.
   Mrs. Thatcher opposes sanctions in principle, saying they hurt
blacks most and strengthen white resistance to change. Some
critics, particularly African nations, charge she is worried about
British investments, doesn't want to lose the trade, and is
sympathetic toward Pretoria.

   Israeli troops shot and killed two guerrillas
in Israel's self-declared security zone in south Lebanon on
Tuesday, the military command said.
   The clash north of Majayoun, four miles north of the Israeli
border, came hours after the army said Israeli-backed militiamen
shot and killed two other armed guerrillas in the security zone.
   An army spokesman said an Israeli force on a routine patrol of
the zone's central sector spotted a guerrilla squad and opened
fire, attacking it from a short distance and killing two guerrillas.
   The Israeli unit suffered no casualties, the spokesman said. No
further details were released.
   Military officials said Soviet-designed AK-47 assault rifles,
hand grenades and explosives were found near the guerrillas' bodies.
   The officials were unable to say if the victims in the clashes
Monday and Tuesday were Palestinian or Lebanese guerrillas. Both
Palestinian and Lebanese militias have attacked Israeli soldiers
and their militia allies in the Israeli-controlled zone in south
Lebanon.
   No organization has claimed responsibility for the attacks on
the Israeli unit or the South Lebanon Army, which is trained, armed
and financed by Israel.
   Foreign reports have said about 500 Israeli soldiers patrol the
security zone, which covers 328 square miles, along with the
militia force made up mostly of Lebanese Christians.
   Israel carved out the buffer zone to protect its northern border
against guerrilla attacks in June 1985 when it withdrew the bulk of
its troops from Lebanon after a three-year occupation.

<HEAD>Park Service Won't Allow Timber Convoys Through Yellowstone</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Park Service says it will not
allow commercial timber hauling through Yellowstone Park, despite a
request by the U.S. Forest Service.
   Parks Director James Ridenour denied the request this week on
the advice on lawyers who said it was against federal law,
spokesman George Berklacy said Tuesday.
   ``There is a park regulation that prohibits commercial transport
across park roadways,'' said Berklacy.
   Ridenour also was concerned that a lumber company's plan to
transport about 20,000 truckloads of logs through the park would
have adverse impacts on important grizzly bear, elk and bison
habitats as well as roadways, said the spokesman.
   He said the Forest Service, which sold the timber, indicated to
the Park Service that there was an emergency need to go through
Yellowstone. But Berklacy said Park Service lawyers disagreed,
saying that the need did not meet the standards required to
constitute an emergency.
   Environmentalists were waiting for Ridenour's decision as the
first big test of his willingness to protect the parks from
commercial assault.
   ``I think the Park Service is to be commended,'' Michael Scott
of the Wilderness Society said Tuesday. ``It did the right thing.''
   Scott said he was glad Ridenour did not accept the Forest
Service's argument that an ``economic emergency'' existed to
justify the hauling.
   ``It would have set a very serious precedent,'' said Scott. He
said that if the Forest Service had prevailed, private owners who
were watching the action would have come forth with similar
requests.
   ``People expect when they enter the boundaries of Yellowstone
Park that things will be different, a world dominated more by
nature than the works of civilization,'' Scott said.
   The timber to be hauled is from national forests bordering
Yellowstone and amounts to about 40 million board feet from trees
that were partially burned by fires that blazed through the park
last year.

<HEAD>Stalin Biographer: Return to the Dictator's Methods a Possibility</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The general who wrote the first Soviet biography
of Josef Stalin said Tuesday there could be a return to the brutal
dictator's methods if Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms don't show
tangible results.
   ``Literally speaking, I rule out a repetition (of Stalin),''
Col. Gen. Dmitri Volkogonov said. ``But a certain return to
conservatism is not excluded, of course.''
   Volkogonov, 61, appeared at a government-sponsored news
conference to present his four-volume ``political portrait'' of
Stalin titled ``Triumph and Tragedy.''
   The book, said by the official Tass news agency to be the first
Soviet biography of Stalin, has been printed in an initial
Russian-language edition of 300,000 copies.
   Volkogonov's work was 10 years in the making and he was given
unprecedented access to previously secret archives, said the
author, chief of the Military History Institute of the Soviet
Defense Ministry.
   His remarks to reporters indicate his 1,344-page work, published
by the Novosti Press Agency, conforms to the new official view of
Stalin as a bloody tyrant, instead of the former version of Stalin
as the architect of the Soviet Union's wartime victory over the
Nazis and the country's industrializer.
   ``The main thing for him was power; his credo was violence,
physical and ideological,'' Volkogonov said.
   In response to a reporter's question, he estimated that from 21
million to 22 million Soviets were unlawfully imprisoned, sent into
internal exile or wrongfully convicted during Stalin's 29-year
reign as Soviet leader.
   Of that number, ``more than two-thirds perished,'' Volkognov
said.
   He said his calculations were based on the capacity of
Stalin-era prisons, labor camps and ``shooting chambers'' where the
Soviet secret police carried out executions.
   In preparation for his book, Volkogonov said he met with
hundreds of people who had known or worked with Stalin, among them
former members of the ruling Communist Party Politburo, secretaries
of the party's policy-making Central Committee, marshals of the
armed forces, people's commissars and members of the dictator's
entourage.
   Asked if another Stalin could arise in the Soviet Union,
Volkogonov said history excludes ``a total repetition.'' But he
said the apparent failure of Gorbachev's reforms could trigger a
conservative reaction.
   ``Attempts to preserve this Stalinist system, attempts to return
to some of his methods, are not excluded in principle,'' Volkogonov
said. ``To exclude them altogether, we need to do a lot. First of
all, our society needs like air at least some success to be felt in
any sphere _ social, agricultural, anywhere _ in order to infuse
new hope in the future success of the changes.''
   The Soviet Union also needs political mechanisms ``that would
guarantee against a return to the past,'' he said without
elaborating.
   For almost two decades, Volkogonov served in the Main Political
Department of the Soviet Army and Navy, but he said he gave that
job up to work on the book.

   Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe Arens has
accepted in principle a proposal by Secretary of State James A.
Baker III for Palestinian negotiations, but with the proviso that
the Palestine Liberation Organization be excluded and the agenda
restricted, the Israeli Embassy said Tuesday.
   The State Department welcomed Arens' letter to Baker and said it
`'reinforces what we believe _ that they are engaged and that they
are working really hard to try to bridge these gaps.''
   Baker's five-point proposal is designed to attract the support
of the Arabs to Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's plan for
elections among the 1.4 million Palestinian Arabs who live on the
West Bank and in Gaza.
   Its key elements include assurances to Israel it would have to
be ``satisfied'' with the composition of the Palestinian delegation
and that a three-way meeting would be held in Washington afterward.
The United States, Israel and Egypt, which is serving as a
middle-man to the PLO, would attend.
   Shamir, while touring the Golan Heights, called the recent
stepped-up exchange with the Bush administration positive. ``I
don't see any large gap between our views and the proposals of the
secretary of state,'' he told reporters. ``But there are some
differences.''
   Israel's Labor Party opposition stressed those differences and
threatened to protest its government's stand by staging a walkout
in parliament. ``I don't see anything in Baker's proposal that
needs to be changed,'' said Shimon Peres, the Labor leader who is
also finance minister.
   Margaret D. Tutwiler, the State Department spokeswoman, said of
Arens' letter, delivered Monday night by Israeli Ambassador Moshe
Arad: ``Obviously, it is a signal, it is confirmation, it is
evidence they are taking this seriously.''
   She said Baker had telephoned Arens on Tuesday, while the
foreign minister was in Brussels, and had also talked to Egyptian
Foreign Minister Esmat Abdel Meguid by phone to Cairo.
   ``He is not overly pessimistic, he is not overly optimistic
about this,'' Ms. Tutwiler said of Baker. ``He is very realistic
about this.''
   ``We believe the Israelis are working hard to advance this
process, and without saying they have accepted or rejected Baker's
five points, it is obvious they are seriously exploring a way to
bridge the gap to reach aqgreement on a framework,'' she said.
   Asked if Baker was flexible on his five points, the spokeswoman
replied: ``Jim Baker is not an unreasonable person.''
   One of Arens' provisos was that Baker provide assurances that
the PLO, whose charter calls for dismantling the Jewish state,
would not participate in the Israeli-Palestinian talks, Ruth Yaron,
the Israeli Embassy spokeswoman, said.
   The second, she said, was that the meeting be restricted to
arrangements for the election. The Palestinians elected on the West
Bank and in Gaza would then negotiate with Israel a five-year plan
for limited self-rule. At the end of that trial period, Israel,
Egypt, Jordan and the Palestinians would work out an overall
settlement.
   Shamir said Israel would agree to the Baker plan ``after the
changes we proposed are accepted.'' The prime minister added: ``In
a few days we will know if there is an agreement or not.''
   Shamir, Arens and other members of the Israel's governing Likud
coalition have sought from the outset to preclude the talks turning
into negotiations with the PLO or turning to issues other than
arrangements for carrying out the elections.
   The PLO Central Council, meeting last week in Baghdad, Iraq,
said only the PLO could represent the Palestinians and it chose a
delegation. Ms. Tutwiler said Tuesday, however, the PLO had not
rejected Baker's five points.
   While only the three-way Washington meeting has been made
public, the four other points are known to provide that:
   _ Talks be held between Israel and Palestinians.
   _ The meeting would concern elections.
   _ Israel is to be ``satisfied'' with the Palestinian
delegation's composition.
   _ Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak is free to consult any Middle
Eastern parties about the makeup of the delegation.

   A judge today sentenced actress Zsa
Zsa Gabor to three days in jail and ordered her to pay more than
$12,000 in fines and restitution for slapping a police officer.
   ``If you strike a cop, you go to jail,'' Municipal Judge Charles
Rubin told Miss Gabor in sentencing her for battery on a police
officer, driving without a valid driver's license and having an
open container of alcohol in her car.
   Rubin also fined the Hungarian actress $2,350, ordered her to
pay $10,000 in restitution to the city of Beverly Hills and its
police department and directed her to perform 120 hours of
community service in a shelter for homeless women.
   He gave Miss Gabor a 24-month jail sentence, but suspended that
to four days and gave her credit for the day she served after being
arrested June 14.
   ``The law applies equally to everybody, whether they're rich or
poor and whether they're famous or not,'' the judge said, ordering
her to serve the three-day sentence before Dec. 29 and allowing no
possibility of early release.
   Earlier, Rubin denied a motion by Miss Gabor's new attorney,
Harrison Bull.
   In setting the conditions for her community service, the judge
ordered Miss Gabor not to say anything to anyone about the case or
give interviews while performing her community service, and asked
reporters to stay away from her.
   As Rubin lectured Miss Gabor about having an open bottle of
whiskey in her Rolls-Royce Corniche, she laughed, earning her a
rebuke from the judge.
   The judge said Miss Gabor's action ``verbally slapped the faces
of every cop.''
   ``She was not satisfied with that. She turned around and slapped
the face of every American by comparing justice in the United
States to Communist Russia and Nazi Germany,'' the judge said.
   Before sentencing, Deputy District Attorney Elden Fox argued for
a tough sentence.
   ``How dare the defendant suggest that she waws not tried by a
jury of her peers? ... ``How dare she suggest they do not
understand the class of people that she comes from?'' Fox argued.
   He said Miss Gabor's antics during trial ``Suggested that this
is a joke... she had no respect for the process.''
   In his motion for a mistrial, Bull argued that Miss Gabor wasn't
properly defended during trial by previous counsel William Graysen.
But Rubin ruled that Graysen's defense was competent, and refused
to declare a mistrial.
   Bull then began calling character witnesses for Miss Gabor,
including charity fundraiser and entertainment industry publicist
Gloria Luchenbill.
   Miss Gabor listened to witnesses with her chin thrust up, and at
one point sprayed herself with a new dose of perfume.
   Bull earlier called on R.G. Markle, who identified himself as an
expert in legal ethics, to back up a contention that Graysen sought
out Miss Gabor in order to gain favorable publicity for his law
practice.
   Bull then called Graysen, who testified under questioning by
Bull that ``I took the case for several reasons, and one of them
was for the publicity.'' Graysen also said he thought the case
would be interesting, that he admired Miss Gabor, and he believed
there may have been some wrongdoing by police in the matter.
   Miss Gabor arrived at court this morning in a black dress,
stepping from a black Mercedes Benz with her husband and telling
about 100 reporters and camera crew members, ``Of course, I'm
nervous.''
   She explained the dress by saying ``My stepfather just died,''
referring to her mother's third husband, Edmond de Szigethy, who
died Sept. 30.
   A jury on Sept. 29 convicted Miss Gabor of battery on a police
officer, driving without a valid driver's license and having an
open container of alcohol in her car. She was acquitted of failing
to obey an officer.
   The maximum possible sentence for the misdemeanor conviction was
18 months in prison and a $3,500 fine.
   District Attorney Ira Reiner urged a 30-day jail sentence, a
fine of more than $3,000 plus $14,000 to compensate the Beverly
Hills Police Department for its costs. But Fox had dismissed the
idea of a jail term after her conviction, saying she was too old to
serve time.
   ``I can't believe this is happening to me,'' Miss Gabor, who is
secretive about her age but according to court documents is 66,
said in a telephone interview Monday night. ``I'm 100 percent
innocent.''
   She said she spent the evening at home, ``feeding my five dogs
and my German husband,'' Frederick von Anhalt.
   ``We were invited to a dinner party but I can't go out. I've got
to get up early in the morning,'' she said.
   During the trial, Miss Gabor told reporters she was afraid to go
to jail because jails are filled with lesbians.
   She later apologized, saying, ``I got letter from the lesbian
and gay association. They are going to boycott me because I say
there are lesbians in jail. Imagine a women's jail, there must be
lesbians ... maybe I should become a lesbian. What do I know? I
like men.''
   The three-week trial cost $30,000. Fox, unhappy with what he
called a courthouse ``media circus,'' had been eager to recoup
trial expenses instead. But Reiner spokeswoman Sandy Gibbons said
court costs could not be recouped constitutionally.
   The tempestuous Miss Gabor slapped Officer Paul Kramer on June
14 after he stopped her Rolls-Royce convertible on a busy street.
The actress testified she instinctively struck out after Kramer
roughed her up.
   Kramer overreacted, she said, and used undue force in arresting
her.

   Jim Bakker, the television evangelist who
lost his PTL empire in a sex and money scandal, was sentenced to 45
years in prison and fined $500,000 today for a federal fraud and
conspiracy conviction.
   ``I'm deeply sorry for those I have hurt,'' Bakker said before
he was sentenced by U.S. District Court Judge Robert Potter. ``I
have sinned. But never in my life did I intend to defraud.''
   Neither side presented witnesses during the hearing, which began
at 2 p.m. and ended shortly after 3 p.m. Bakker rose with his
attorney, Harold Bender, when Potter sentenced him.
   Bakker shook his head in disbelief while a federal prosecutor
presented arguments, as did his daughter, Tammy Sue Chapman.
Bakker's wife, Tammy Faye, did not attend the court session.
   Bakker could be eligible for parole in 10 years. He was
immediately taken into custody and was to be taken to the federal
correctional facility in Talladega, Ala. His lawyers have said
since his conviction that they would appeal.
   Jessica Hahn, the church secretary whose sexual tryst with
Bakker led to the hush money scandal that caused him to lose
control of PTL in 1987, said in a television interview that she was
not satisfied with the sentence.
   ``In my opinion, I still feel like it won't add up to the years
that people worked to save up money to give to PTL.''
   Bakker, 49, was convicted Oct. 5 of 24 counts charging he
defrauded followers of his television ministry, selling lodging
guarantees at his Christian retreat when he knew rooms weren't
available.
   Followers sent more than $158 million to become ``lifetime
partners,'' which was supposed to give them annual lodging rights
for the rest of their lives.
   The jury found that Bakker used more than $3.7 million to buy
luxurious homes, fancy cars, jewelry and expensive vacations.
   In a sentencing memo, Justice Department fraud specialist
Deborah Smith and Assistant U.S. Attorney Jerry Miller asked Potter
that Bakker be ordered to pay restitution. Unsettled claims total
between $90 million to $100 million, according to lawyers
representing the partners.
   Prosecutors said when Bakker was indicted that the maximum fine
could be more than $5 million. But when they filed the
recommendation, they cited the Criminal Fine Enforcement Act of
1984, which allows a maximum fine to be no more than twice the
highest fine allowed for any count in the case.
   Since Bakker faced 21 counts carrying maximum $250,000 fines and
three carrying maximum $1,000 fines, the memo said the highest fine
Potter, known as ``Maximum Bob'' for his stiff sentences, could set
was $500,000.
   Bakker faced a maximum sentence of 120 years. The memorandum did
not specify a recommended sentence but cited a number of cases.
Prosecutors said in the memo the sentence should be more than the
longest of those cases, which was 40 years.
   ``Every time there was a fork in the road and one led to a
lighter sentence and one led to a heavier sentence, Jim took the
one that led to the heavier sentence,'' former U.S. Attorney Mike
Scofield said before the sentencing. ``When Jim got on the
courthouse steps and said he was not guilty and showed a complete
lack of remorse and contrition that's going to hurt him. That means
a lot to Judge Potter.''
   Prosecutors said a tough prison sentence would show that
white-collar criminals ``will not be dealt with less harshly than
those criminals who have neither the wit nor the position to commit
crimes other than those of violence.''
   The prosecutors said Bakker has not assumed responsibility for
his crimes.
   ``The defendant's lack of remorse suggests little potential for
meaningful rehabilitation and demonstrates an increased likelihood
of recidivism,'' the prosecutors wrote. ``Since leaving PTL, Bakker
has shown a willingness to continue his solicitation of support
through the use of half truths and misrepresentations. ...
   ``A substantial term of imprisonment would impress upon the
defendant the gravity of his offenses and the need to refrain from
similar conduct in the future,'' the prosecutors said.
   Bender attached character references from Bakker supporters to
his three-page sentencing recommendation and urged the judge to
consider alternatives to prison.
   Bender asked the court to ``temper its justice with mercy and
consider reasonable alternatives and allow this defendant the
benefit of the court's compassion and mercy.''
   During the trial, which began Aug. 28 and lasted nearly six
weeks, defense attorneys had called 75 witnesses, including more
than 50 who were loyal Bakker supporters.
   Prosecutors called more than 100 witnesses, including many
lifetime partners who had sent money _ usually $1,000 _ to obtain
free mini-vacations at PTL's 2,400-acre Christian retreat in nearby
Fort Mill, S.C.

   Parliament on Tuesday began debating a
bill that would end a 122-year-old ban on abortions in this
overwhelmingly Roman Catholic nation of 10 million people.
   ``The issue is painful and divides us by its conflict of values,
the right to life and the distress of women,'' said Jacqueline
Mayence, a conservative but pro-abortion senator who opened the
debate.
   ``Nobody wants to promote abortion,'' she said, but added, ``the
ban is inapplicable, particularly because of public opinion ... and
new legislation in neighboring countries which leads to `abortion
tourism.'''
   Public opinion polls show most Belgians favor abortions.
   The bill before the 184-member senate was preceded by 30 similar
measures in the past 15 years that all failed to win legislative
approval. The latest would let a woman have an abortion before her
12th week of pregnancy if she is in a ``state of distress.''
   Under Belgian law, women who have abortions, and doctors who
perform them, risk jail terms of up to 10 years. Yet enforcement of
the law has been spotty and the courts have issued very lenient
penalties to offenders in recent years.
   An estimated 15,000 abortions are performed in Belgium each year
with hospitals reporting these as womb surgery to allow women to be
reimbursed by the social security system.
   As debate opened, Senate President Frank Swaelen, a Christian
Democrat, sent the bill to the Council of State for a ruling on
whether it conforms with the constitution.
   The Council of State, a legal panel that acts as a
constitutional court, was asked to issue its ruling by week's end.
   Swaelen's move did not suspend the debate. But it will delay a
final senate vote until next month and reflected abortion
opposition within Prime Minister Wilfried Martens' Christian
Democratic Party.
   The latest bill was adopted by two Senate committees but has
opened opened up a rift within Martens' coalition of Christian
Democrats, Socialists and a Flemish nationalist party. No
government minister attended Tuesday's debate.
   Christian Democrats, especially in Belgium's Dutch-speaking
northern half, are almost unanimously opposed to legalizing
abortions. The Socialists are in favor as are the opposition
Conservatives.
   After the senate has voted on the abortion bill, the issue must
still win approval of the dominant 212-member Chamber of
Representatives where Martens' government occupies 150 seats.
   The abortion debate really began 16 years ago when Dr. Willy
Peers, head of a maternity ward at a Namur hospital, announced he
regularly performed abortions.
   He was jailed briefly but never tried. His action set off a
pro-abortion campaign that led prosecutors to suspend some cases
and judges to acquit or give light sentences to offenders who were
prosecuted.
   ``The Parliament must thus put law in conformity with social and
legal reality,'' said Ms. Mayence.
   She added that the bill would not establish abortion on demand,
but permit it in certain circumstances. Abortions could only take
place after the 12th week of pregnancy if the foetus suffered from
serious, incurable diseases or the life of the mother was in danger.
   The bill also stipulates that abortions must only be carried out
in approved hospitals or medical centers.

   Afghan jets bombed central Afghan
cities and guerrilla strongholds to try to halt attacks on supply
lines to besieged cities, Western diplomats said Tuesday.
   U.S.-backed Moslem guerrilla sources claimed that since the
weekend, 1,500 soldiers and 700 armed militiamen defected to the
self-proclaimed guerrilla government based in Pakistan. The report
could not be independently confirmed.
   One Western diplomat, speaking in Islamabad on condition he not
be identified, said high-altitude cluster bombs rained down in
recent days on villages and guerrilla positions along the Logar
Road, which links the capital Kabul to Gardez, 100 miles southeast.
   There were no immediate casualty reports.
   Diplomats said guerrillas have stopped a 200-vehicle supply
convoy on the Logar Road at Mohammad Aga, 18 miles southeast of
Kabul. The government convoy stuck at Mohammad Aga reportedly left
the capital about two weeks ago and is headed toward the embattled
garrison town of Khost, near the Pakistan border.
   Guerrillas launched an offensive against Khost more than two
months ago but fighting is deadlocked.
   A guerrilla source, known only as Amanullah, corroborated
reports of heavy bombing along the Logar road but said about 60
percent of the villages were already reduced to rubble in bombing
raids during the early years of the war.
   Most civilians from the area moved to neighboring Pakistan,
where more than 3 million refugees have fled from the decade-long
battle between Soviet-backed communist troops and the Moslem
insurgents.
   Diplomats, quoting guerrilla sources, said guerrilla fighters
hit a government convoy traveling on the strategic Salang Highway,
linking Kabul to the Soviet Union.
   Guerrillas claimed to have destroyed more than 20 vehicles and
captured 30 others, including tanks and armored personnel carriers,
in last week's attack.
   Diplomats and rebel sources said the road between Kabul and the
eastern city of Jalalabad has been blocked by guerrilla fighters
since Sept. 25. The 75-mile stretch of highway is critical for the
government to resupply the beseiged city of Jalalabad.
   A guerrilla spokesman, who uses the single name Iqbal, said
1,500 army troops deserted their positions in eastern Afghanistan's
Ghazni province on Monday.
   The 700 militiamen defected on the weekend from 20 outposts in
northern Samangan province, guerrilla sources said. The defection
weakened a security ring around the northern town of Robatak, they
said.

<HEAD>Report Says 11 Percent of Young People's Deaths Caused by Guns</HEAD>

   A government report showing that guns cause 11
percent of young people's deaths underscores the need to lower
teen-age homicide rates, especially among blacks, Health Secretary
Louis Sullivan said Tuesday.
   Since 1968, homicide has been the leading cause of death for
black males aged 15 to 19. From 1984 to 1987, the rate for this
group jumped 53 percent _ to 60 deaths per 100,000, the report said.
   Firearms are responsible for about eight in 10 of these deaths,
the report said.
   The report, ``Firearm Mortality Among Children and Youth,'' was
released in conjunction with the premiere of a television
documentary on youth homicide, produced by the Department of Health
and Human Services. The program is being offered to stations
nationwide.
   The statistics show that ``we are losing our youth _ not only to
disease _ but increasingly to injury and violence,'' Sullivan said.
   ``Just as we have controlled so many childhood diseases, we must
now mount an equally aggressive campaign to rid our children's
lives of the causes and tools of injury and violence,'' the
secretary said in a statement accompanying the report.
   The report by the National Center for Health Statistics counted
3,392 firearm-related deaths among children aged 1 to 19 in 1987 _
about 11 percent of all childhood deaths.
   Among children aged 1 to 4, guns accounted for about 1 percent
of deaths, but the proportion rose to 17 percent among teen-agers,
the report said.
   For children aged 1 to 9, homicide and unintentional shooting
deaths each accounted for about half of all firearm deaths. Among
those aged 10 to 14, shooting deaths were about equally divided
among suicide, homicide and unintentional shootings.
   Of the firearm deaths among teen-agers, about 48 percent were
homicides, 42 percnt were suicides and 8 percent were unintentional
shootings.
   Teen-age boys are six times as likely as teen-age girls to die
in a shooting, the report said.
   Among black teen-agers, 41 percent of deaths are associated with
firearms, compared with 16 percent for white male teen-agers.
   The frequency of firearm-related deaths in the United States
changed little from 1968 to 1987, except among teen-agers, for whom
the death rate over the period rose from 10 per 100,000 to nearly
15 per 100,000.
   The overall rate decreased for children aged 1 to 4 during the
period.

<HEAD>Priest Plans Service for Poles Slain by Secret Police</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Warsaw priest plans to hold religious
ceremonies for up to 3,000 people who were murdered by secret
police during the Stalinist era and buried near his church.
   ``These people were deprived of a Christian burial, therefore
the Warsaw church has a totally special obligation to fulfill this
(funeral) ritual,'' the Rev. Jozef R. Maj, parish priest at St.
Catherine's Church, told state television Monday.
   He said lectures and ceremonies would be held Thursday through
Saturday, with a funeral service Saturday night.
   He also appealed to people to provide any information they have
that could ``broaden our knowledge'' about the Poles killed as
communism was imposed throughout the country.
   A cleaning last fall of the archives of the Roman Catholic
church revealed that 500 to 3,000 people slain by Polish secret
police from 1946 to 1956 were buried in the parish cemetery, the
television report said.
   The examination of the church archives was reported in the
Polish press last year, but at that time the Stalinist repression
in Poland after World War II was a taboo subject for the official
media.
   The existence of a mass grave in the Sluzewiec cemetery had been
known for years even though the victims were buried secretly. Names
of the victims have not been released by the Interior Ministry and
many have not been identified.
   Thousands of Poles who were accused of resisting communist rule
were arrested, held without trial, tortured and killed as Soviet
dictator Josef Stalin enforced his domination over East-bloc
countries controlled by the Soviet army.
   Among those slain were members of the underground Home Army that
had fought the Nazis and was under the command of the Polish
government-in-exile in London. Stalin broke relations with the
government-in-exile in 1943.
   The television news commentator said it is probable that among
the victims buried in the cemetery are a Home Army general and a
group of teen-age Boy Scouts who fought in the Warsaw Uprising
against the Nazis in the closing days of World War II.
   The commentator said it had been determined that the youngest
person buried in the parish cemetery was 17 years old.

<HEAD>Report Estimates 600 Killed Because Of 65 mph Limit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The 65 mph speed limit may have killed 600
people on rural Interstates, some due to a sharp increase in
drivers in some states who travel at extremely high speeds,
according to a government report.
   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's report to
Congress said states with the higher speed limit on rural freeways
for two years showed an estimated 31 percent increase in fatalities
on those roads.
   The report, dated Monday, estimated that 309 more people died in
1987 and 591 in 1988 than would have been expected based on the
historical trend before Congress allowed the higher speed limit.
About two-thirds of the increase _ 600 deaths _ could be attributed
to speed, the report said, and the remainder to increased traffic.
   Results varied widely from state to state, however, and the
report said the number of deaths was so low in some cases that the
changes were not statistically significant. In Vermont, for
example, fatalities on rural Interstates increased 800 percent,
from 2 in 1986 to 18 in 1988. But the report said that could have
been due to chance, or factors other than speed.
   In 17 states, death tolls on affected highways were 50 percent
or more higher than in 1986, when the speed limit was 55 mph, said
the report.
   On the other hand, six states with 65 mph limits showed
decreases in fatalities on rural Interstates and the eight states
that retained the 55 mph limit averaged a 10 percent increase in
fatalities on such roads over the two years.
   Speed monitoring data from 18 of the states that increased the
speed limit showed that 11 times as many vehicles were traveling
faster than 80 miles per hour than two years ago. Three times as
many were traveling faster than 70 mph, the report said.
   The agency earlier concluded that the 55 mph limit dramatically
curtailed the number of drivers using excessive speed and even
lowered average speeds on some roads posted below 55 mph.
   The gap between the speeds of the slowest and fastest traffic on
the road also increased on roads posted at 65 mph, the new report
said.
   ``The effects of these two changes were to increase the
likelihood and severity of traffic collisions,'' the report said.
   The agency made no recommendation on the speed limit, noting
that the Transportation Department ``continues to believe that
states are in the best position to make decisions on both posted
speed limits and enforcement.''
   Brian O'Neill, president of the Insurance Institute for Highway
Safety, said the government report confirms data it compiled
earlier.
   ``There shouldn't be a question any longer _ deaths have
increased because of higher speed limits,'' O'Neill said.
   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner sent a letter last month
to all governors calling for a national campaign to discourage
speeding, but said states could determine appropriate speed limits.
   The report said that despite the increase on rural highways,
Interstates remain the safest highways in the country, with fewer
fatalities for the miles traveled than other roads. Accidents on
rural Interstates killed 2,836 people in 1988, or about 6 percent
of the 47,079 fatalities on U.S. roads.
   Overall, fatalities were up 1.5 percent on all roads, but the
number of deaths per 100,000 miles traveled remained at the 1987
level of 2.4, which is an all-time low.
   The country has 29,808 miles of Interstate highway on which the
speed limit has been increased to 65 mph.
   States which have retained the 55 mph limit are Connecticut,
Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York,
Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island. Alaska and Delaware have no rural
Interstates.

<TEXT>
   The Soviet foreign minister pledged
Tuesday on his first visit to the new Solidarity government to
maintain key fuel supplies, and Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki
said he will travel next month to Moscow.
   In addition, Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze said the
Soviet Union will try to uncover the truth about the World War II
massacre of thousands of Polish officers at Katyn. The issue has
long been a sore point in Polish-Soviet relations.
   Upon arrival at Warsaw's Okecie airport, Shevardnadze said,
``The Soviet leadership places a lot of importance'' on his visit
to Warsaw.
   He was met by Polish Foreign Minister Krzysztof Skubiszewski, a
professor of international law and Solidarity sympathizer, who told
Shevardnadze: ``This is an important visit for us. We have high
expectations for it.''
   They held two rounds of talks before Shevardnadze went to the
Council of Ministers to meet Mazowiecki, a former Solidarity editor
who became the first non-communist to lead an East bloc government
on Aug. 24.
   ``I am very happy about our many-faceted talk,'' Mazowiecki said
after his two-hour meeting with Shevardnadze. ``I accepted the
invitation to Moscow with gratitude,'' and said he expected to
leave for the Soviet Union on Nov. 23.
   Polish officials say the important items on the agenda with the
Soviet Union were restructuring economic relations between Warsaw
and Moscow as part of a drive to create a market economy,
resolution of historical ``blank spots'' and easing of contacts
between Polish and Soviet citizens.
   ``There are some problems, but they were discussed in the spirit
of understanding and seeking solutions,'' Foreign Ministry
spokesman Stefan Staniszewski said after the meeting, which he said
focused on economic problems and new forms of cooperation.
   Shevardnadze will meet with Polish officials again Wednesday
before holding discussions Thursday and Friday in Warsaw with
Warsaw Pact foreign ministers.
   According to Staniszewski, Shevardnadze pledged the Soviet Union
would maintain its level of deliveries to Poland, which is
dependent on Moscow for oil, gas, electricity and raw materials.
   It was a significant gesture of good will because Poland has
been having trouble delivering products to the Soviet Union due to
its protracted economic crisis, which includes a shotage of
industrial goods, high inflation and a $39 billion foreign debt.
   Poland has said it wants to renegotiate its contracts with its
trading partners in the Soviet-led Comecon alliance to make them
more market-oriented.
   Shevardnadze is the highest-ranking Soviet official to visit
Warsaw since Mazowiecki's election. Two days after Mazowiecki took
office, KGB chief Viktor Kryuchkov met with him and called him a
``solid man.''
   The Soviet decision not to interfere in the assumption of power
by a Solidarity government, relayed by President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev in a telephone call to Polish Communist First Secretary
Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski on Aug. 22, marked a significant departure
from Soviet treatment of its East bloc allies.
   Shevardnadze underlined this point Monday in a major foreign
policy speech in Moscow, saying that as Warsaw Pact countries move
away from one-party rule, the Soviet Union would observe principles
of non-intervention and ``absolute freedom of choice.''
   Poland, the Soviet Union's largest trade partner, and Hungary
have led the way in implementing democratic reform in the East bloc.
   But Mazowiecki and his Solidarity-led cabinet have promised to
respect the country's military obligations to the Soviet-led
alliance.
   Government spokeswoman Malgorzata Niezabitowska said last week
Poland was preparing a visit by Mazowiecki to Moscow to discuss
economic relations, Polish-Soviet history and expanding
people-to-people contacts.
   Central among the historical issues is the Katyn massacre of
4,300 Polish officers on Soviet soil in World War II.
   Speaking to reporters Tuesday, Shevardnadze was asked if they
had discussed the issue.
   ``All questions, everything connected with history _ present and
future _ were raised,'' he replied. ``We are going to study history
and search for documents if they exist.
   ``I state this with full responsibility: We are interested in
the truth.''
   Poland has been pressing for a joint declaration of Soviet
responsibility for the deaths of 15,000 officers at Katyn and two
other World War II camps, but there has been reluctance on the part
of hard-line factions in the Soviet Union.
   Poland also is interested in increasing contact between Soviet
citizens and Poles. Staniszewski said Shevardnadze saw no great
difficulties in resolving problems of Poles living in the Soviet
Union and the care of Polish monuments and places of national
remembrance on Soviet territory.

<HEAD>High School Reinstates Lyrics of Fight Song After Racist Complaint</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PEKIN, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Officials at a high school here reinstated a
25-year-old fight chant one month after it was shelved when a
student complained that it contained a subliminal salute to the Ku
Klux Klan.
   ``To say that an innocent cadence, which happens to have a
`K-K-K' in it, is racist is stretching things a little bit,'' said
Chic Renner, school board president, on Tuesday.
   A student complained on Sept. 18 about the traditional chant at
Pekin High School. Superintendant Jack Wilt agreed and ordered
changes in the final line of the chant: ``P-P-P-E-K, K-K-K-I-N.
P-E-K, K-I-N. Pekin, Pekin, Pekin.''
   The new lyrics spelled out ``Dragon,'' the school mascot. But
officials said fans found the chant awkward.
   Wilt said he and principal Bill Rees reconsidered the issue last
Thursday and decided they had gone too far in ordering it
re-written.
   ``I thought the original decision was correct, but it seemed
Rees and I were the only ones who thought so,'' Wilt said. ``Some
people felt that maybe we had over-reacted.''
   Wilt said Tuesday he still believes the ``Pekin'' chant, with
its repetition of ``K-K-K,'' contains a racist overtone ``if viewed
in a narrow context.''
   ``But we decided that no racism was intended and that maybe we
over-reacted, so we changed it back,'' Wilt said. ``I hope this is
the end of it.''
   Pekin is sensitive to the racism issue after allegations that
black students from Peoria and Champaign were harassed by students
from the predominantly white Pekin High School twice in the 1988-89
school year.

<HEAD>Administration Still Wants to End Farm Export Subsidies in Five Years</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States is proceeding with proposals
to liberalize world agricultural trade, including a five-year
phasing out of export subsidies, the Bush administration said
Tuesday.
   Eventually, perhaps within a decade, the plan also calls for the
elimination of domestic programs that distort international trade
in farm commodities.
   But Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter said the detailed
plan, which will be presented formally Wednesday in Geneva to the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, would not get rid of all
government farm aid.
   ``There is nothing here that precludes any nation from having a
safety net for its farmers,'' he said.
   Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., chairman of the Senate Agriculture
Committee, said U.S. agricultural policy ``will not be made in
Geneva or some foreign capital. It will be made by Congress, which
must approve any final GATT agreement before it can become law in
this country.''
   Leahy added in a statement, ``I will not abandon our farmers to
unfair competition. I will also not allow the administration to
abandon them either.''
   The current round of talks under the 97-nation GATT began in
Punta del Esta, Uruguay, on Sept. 20, 1986, and will conclude at
the end of 1990.
   Yeutter, who joined U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills at a
news conference, said the plan now going before GATT is not much
different from the initial U.S. proposal made in 1987, although it
is ``much more comprehensive, much more specific'' than the earlier
plan.
   Hills said the agriculture proposal ``would mean that America's
farmers could compete against foreign farmers based on price and
quality, rather than on the depth of a foreign government's
pocketbook'' or the height of a trade barrier.
   The U.S. objective in the GATT talks has been to gain improved
market access for American goods and services, including major farm
commodities such as grain, oilseeds, cotton and livestock products.
   Yeutter said the U.S. proposal calls for gradually scaling down
or eliminating quotas and other non-tariff barriers by converting
them into tariffs over 10 years.
   He said safeguards would be allowed for temporary protection
against countries dumping their goods _ selling them below
production cost
   Export subsidies would be phased out over five years, Yeutter
said. The export subsidies maintained by the European Economic
Community have been a sore point with U.S. trade officials for years
   Under the proposal, some domestic subsidies would have a ``red
light'' designation and be eliminated gradually, those with a
``yellow light'' designation would be watched for possible further
negotiation, and those with ``green light'' designation, such as
conservation programs, would proceed.
   Yeutter stressed that no move would be made unilaterally by the
United States and that no farm program would be altered unless
other countries did likewise.
   ``If we travel down this correct road, we will travel it only in
conjunction with our trading partners,'' he said. ``Whether or not
we do so is now up to them.''
   Yeutter said he doubted if the GATT proposal would significantly
alter the debate in Congress on new farm legislation due next year.
He said he hoped that the 1990 farm legislation will become law
before the Uruguay Round of trade talks conclude.
   Assuming the trade negotiations are successful, he said, ``We
will make modifications in that (farm) legislation in 1991.''
   Leland Swenson, president of the National Farmers Union, said
his organization has ``some real concerns'' about the U.S.
proposal, particularly in the interpretation of
``trade-distorting'' subsidies.
   ``We see encompassed within there a call to eliminate domestic
farm programs and farm policy,'' Swenson said in a telephone
interview.
   But Swenson added that the union has supported the strengthening
of trade rules in regard to direct export subsidies and that these
could be reduced or eliminated so long as other countries did
likewise.
   Dean Kleckner, president of the American Farm Bureau Federation,
said the United States holds an advantage by being first in line at
GATT with its proposals.
   ``We're going to again set the tone for this,'' he said. ``So
ours will be the one that's under discussion.''
   Kleckner said the Farm Bureau ``believes that the thrust of this
proposal is correct.''

<HEAD>French First Lady Appeals To Congress, Democracies, To Save Kurds</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   France's first lady, Danielle Mitterrand, on
Tuesday brought an impassioned appeal to Congress to help save the
Kurdish people from annihilation.
   ``Do not forget them. Silence is killing them,'' she told the
gongressional Human Rights Caucus.
   ``They are all individuals in distress and their people is in
danger of extinction,'' Mrs. Mitterrand said. Several Kurdish women
in the packed hearing room wept during her speech.
   There are an estimated 20 million Kurds scattered among Turkey,
Iraq, Iran, Syria, Lebanon and the Soviet Union. They have been
subjected to persecution in all these countries, especially in Iraq
which is strongly believed to have bombarded them with poison gas
last year.
   Iraq has denied the accusation, but one of three American
physicians who visited Kurdish refugees from Iraq in Turkish camps
told the caucus his team found conclusive evidence of poison gas
symptoms. Robert Mullen Cook-Deegan said refugees described eye,
lung and gastro-intestinal irritation, consistent with the known
effects of poison gas.
   Mrs. Mitterrand, a noted human rights activist who co-sponsored
the first international forum on the plight of the Kurds last week
in Paris, described her visit last May to the same Turkish camps
the physicians visited.
   Without directly criticizing Iraq, which is one of France's
biggest weapons clients, Mrs. Mitterrand said the Kurdish refugees
clearly do not believe assurances by the Iraqi government that they
can return home without fear of persecution.
   ``The result is that the Iraqi Kurds in Turkey are in a
desperate situation: They can neither go home _ which is their
deepest wish _ nor become integrated into the Kurdish population in
Turkey,'' she said.
   Mrs. Mitterrand said she visited the camps, despite attempts by
Turkish authorities to dissuade her, and encountered ``dreadful''
living conditions at the barbed-wire enclosures where more than
30,000 Kurdish refugees are incarcerated.
   The only help can come from the world's democratic governments,
she said.
   Members of the caucus said Congress had ignored the Kurdish
tragedy for too long. ``This is one of the most flagrant examples
of man's inhumanity to man,'' said Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass.
   ``The brutal Iraqi campaign to eradicate the Kurds must be
condemned,'' he said. More than 60,000 Kurds fled the Iraqi attacks
``and we must act now to ensure it never, never happens again.''

<HEAD>Polls Show Dinkins Support Slipping</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democratic mayoral candidate David Dinkins'
commanding lead in the polls over Republican Rudolph Giuliani has
shrunk in the aftermath of questions about his financial dealings,
a new poll indicates.
   Dinkins, who led Giuliani less than two weeks ago by about 20
percent, was picked by 45 percent compared with 41 percent for
Giuliani in the poll conducted for the New York Daily News and
WABC-TV.
   The poll of 500 voters, conducted Sunday, had a margin of error
of 5 percentage points.
   The poll was the first since the Sept. 12 Democratic primary to
show Dinkins' support at less than 50 percent.
   The Daily News-WABC poll indicated the biggest shift in support
occurred among Jewish voters, who last week favored Dinkins by 10
points.
   Now, 44 percent of Jewish voters support Giuliani and 26 percent
support Dinkins, according to the poll. Twenty-six percent were
undecided, and 69 percent were not strongly committed to either
candidate.
   Dinkins on Monday compared the new poll results to those done
shortly before the Democratic primary ``that suggested that (Mayor
Edward) Koch and I were neck and neck. We of course were not and
the outcome was not what they predicted.
   ``I suspect that's the case here,'' he said.
   However, Dinkins said he had ``anticipated there would be some
fall-off'' in support among all voters due to the recent
controversy over his finances.
   Political analysts have said Dinkins' loss of support may be due
to questions about his finances, including his failure to pay taxes
from 1969 to 1973 and discrepancies in the stated value of stock he
transferred to his son.
   Dinkins has denied any wrongdoing.
   Giuliani said the poll results confirm ``what I've been seeing
in the streets in the last three or four weeks.''
   He said voters ``want fundamental change. They want honest,
reformed government. I think they realize ... that David Dinkins
isn't up to the task of being mayor.''

   Some 300 men, most of them permanently
homeless, had plenty of food and a warm place to sleep Tuesday
aboard a Navy ship called into earthquake duty.
   ``We're eating just fine,'' said John Clulow, among those aboard
the helicopter carrier Peleliu, docked on the San Francisco
Embarcadero, just south of the of the crippled Bay Bridge.
   ``We're getting steaks, roast beef, ham end eggs, vegetables and
snacks all day _ and regular showers _ the Navy's doin' a good
job,'' declared Clulow on the carrier's cavernous hangar deck. It
was crowded with refugees, cots, food tables, assorted officials
from all levels, and social workers.
   ``We're feeding them 900 meals a day _ Navy chow,'' said Lt.
Scott Larkin.
   The ship, whose usual mission is to deploy assault landing
forces by helicopter, landing craft and amphibious vehicles,
arrived in San Francisco from exercises in the Aleutian Islands.
   The men, brought to the carrier Sunday night, had been staying
at the Moscone Convention Center before they, along with 800
others, were bused to the ship or to Army Presidio barracks on the
northwest edge of the city. The convention center had been used as
an earthquake evacuation shelter but was emptied so it could be
readied for a convention next week.
   Security was stiff as the men paraded aboard over the gangway,
then halted for security searches.
   ``Yes, they were frisked before they came aboard,'' said Lt.
Cmdr. Mike Sloan. ``These were druggies, alcoholics. These were
people from the street. Some of them took cocaine and stuff out of
their pockets.''
   Crew members were reported to have been uncomfortable in this
task, as were the refugees.
   ``I'm sure some of them have AIDS,'' said Red Cross worker
Louise Boocher, who was obviously unhappy about the refugees. Near
the quarterdeck, Red Cross volunteer nurse Laura Roche handed out
warm clothing and toilet kits to a line of men.
   ``Some of the (Red Cross) people have been real stressed, but
everybody has been very nice,'' said Carl Dillard.
   ``I'm not unhappy at all, like at first,'' said Neal Rodgers.
``The Navy has been very nice to us. Everything's fine.
Everything's beautiful.''
   Up on the hangar deck, workers from the Federal Emergency
Management Agency filled in displaced person forms for later
disaster aid. Men who couldn't provide a ``pre-earthquake''
address, were referred to other emergency agencies, Larkin said.

<HEAD>Government Admits Questionable Payments to Atomic Weapons Producers</HEAD>

   The Energy Department acknowledged Tuesday it
may have erred in rewarding the private operators of several of its
nuclear weapons plants with millions of dollars in bonuses despite
serious failings to protect the health and safety of workers and
nearby residents.
   The admission came from Henson Moore, the deputy energy
secretary, and other department officials during a grilling by a
House Government Operations subcommittee, which documented the
bonus payments to operators of the Rocky Flats plutonium processing
plant and the Savannah River nuclear production center.
   Savannah River, the nation's only source of tritium used to make
nuclear warheads, has been closed for more than a year because of
safety and technical problems that prompted the department to
switch management companies there last April.
   The Rocky Flats plant, situated about 16 miles from Denver, is
in disarray and is under FBI investigation for possible criminal
violation of environmental laws.
   ``There is room for real question'' about whether the Energy
Department should have paid $912,000 in bonuses last year to the
top 25 E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co. managers of the Savannah River
plant near Aiken, S.C., Moore said in sworn testimony.
   He acknowledged that the three highest-paid Du Pont executives,
with collective government salaries of $561,000 and bonuses of
$306,000 in 1988, were not based at the plant site. They worked at
Du Pont headquarters at Wilmington, Del.
   Separately, government auditors disclosed Tuesday that Du Pont
on Sept. 27, 1988, told the Energy Department that some of the
reactor fuel and ``targets'' used to produce tritium at Savannah
River were defective and that others might be defective as well.
The department immediately ordered Du Pont to stop making the fuel
and targets and to investigate whether the problem might
jeoparidize safety.
   Several months later it was decided there was no safety problem,
but the Energy Department did not approve a plan for improving
manufacturing of the fuel and targets until earlier this month, the
General Accounting Office said in a report to Congress.
   Replacing the defective and suspect materials will cost at least
$731,000 and possibly an additional $8 million, depending on how
the problem is resolved, the GAO said.
   Over the objections of the Energy Department's legal staff, Rep.
Mike Synar, D-Okla., chairman of the House subcommittee, released
figures on salaries and bonuses paid to Du Pont executives in each
of the past five years. In what Synar called a compromise with the
department, the subcommittee withheld the names and job titles of
the Du Pont managers.
   Moore said that to release the managers' names would unfairly
subject them to ``public abuse.''
   From 1984 through 1988, the top 25 Du Pont executives in charge
of running Savannah River got $12.7 million in salaries plus $3.5
million in performance bonuses from the Energy Department, the
figures showed.
   Westinghouse Savannah River Co. took over as operator at the
plant last April 1. Moore told the committee that the top
Westinghouse executives are paid less than the Du Pont managers
were, and that all top Westinghouse managers are stationed at the
plant. Moore did not provide exact figures for Westhinghouse
salaries or bonuses.
   Synar also questioned why the department paid Rockwell
International Corp. $26.8 million in bonus money in the 1986-88
fiscal years for running Rocky Flats in a period when the plant was
cited for numerous flaws in safety and health protection.
   The GAO, in a separate report released at the subcommitee
hearing, said the department, in its ratings used to set Rockwell's
semi-annual bonus awards, deliberately played down or ignored
negative information about the company's performance.
   Bruce Twining, who headed the Energy Department regional office
in Albuquerque, N.M., that approved the bonus payments to Rockwell,
admitted under questioning from Synar that the department probably
went too easy on Rockwell.
   ``Looking back from today, those ratings could clearly be
questioned,'' Twining said.
   Rockwell announced last month that it was withdrawing from its
Rocky Flats contract next January because of a disagreement with
the Energy Department over the company's potential liability for
environmental violations at the plant.
   Moore disclosed that EG&amp;G Inc., which will take over as operator
of Rocky Flats when Rockwell leaves, will be paid $15 million in
advance for one year's work. After the first year, its earnings
will be pegged to performance ratings by the department, he said.

<HEAD>Chief: Fire Efforts Much Improved Over 1906</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NICHOLAS K. GERANIOS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   While fires caused the major devastation
from the 1906 earthquake, lessons learned then helped the San
Francisco Fire Department reduce losses from last week's temblor,
Fire Chief Frederick Postel said Tuesday.
   Firefighters strapped for equipment also pulled two trucks out
of a city museum and pressed them into service, and a controversial
and expensive fire boat maintained by the city proved its value,
Postel told members of the city Fire Commission in a preliminary
report.
   But perhaps the most important development was the creation
years ago of a special water main system that allowed broken areas
to be quickly sealed off and the water diverted.
   With no water available in 1906, firefighters watched helplessly
as flames consumed thousands of buildings. Only a handful were
destroyed by fire in last week's quake, fire officials said.
   ``In 1906 there was no water for four days,'' Postel said. ``We
didn't have water for 1{ to 2 hours.''
   ``That's a credit to our forefathers from the last quake,''
Postel said.
   Postel said there were just 14 breaks in water mains caused by
the Oct. 17 quake. The 1906 quake caused 300 breaks.
   But the breaks were critical in the hard-hit Marina district of
San Francisco, where fires broke out and there was no water to
fight them.
   ``It was rolling,'' said firefighter Bob Mielke. ``It was going
to take off on the whole area.''
   Firefighters ran a hose into a pond at the nearby Palace of Fine
Arts, and also pumped out of the bay with the fire boat Phoenix, to
douse the flames, Postel said.
   ``That was what in the fire service is called a miraculous
stop,'' Postel said.
   The fire boat had recently been the target of city budget cuts,
but was saved at the last minute.
   In the first hours after the quake, firefighters responded to
400 calls for assistance, including 27 fires, Postel said. On an
average day there are 159 calls for help.
   A total of 2,000 calls for help were received in the first 80
hours, 300 percent above normal, he said.
   ``Ninety percent of the calls the first day were gas leaks,'' he
said, while others were to rescue people trapped in buildings and
elevators and inspect buildings.
   With so much demand, equipment ran short and ingenious
firefighters took equipment out of the city's fire museum, Postel
said.
   One engine was a 1961 model that was the only jet turbine water
pumper ever built, said Susan Stacks, a museum trustee.
   The jet turbine, built by planemaker The Boeing Co., was not a
successful experiment and had been removed from the truck, she
said. But because it was the only one ever built, the truck was
placed in the museum.
   Mielke said the old truck was used to answer about 15 calls in
his area while regular engines raced to the Marina district.
   Firefighters refitted the old truck with pumping equipment. ``It
was missing fittings and certain things like that but it worked
fine,'' he said.
   Also used was a 1937 foam truck that is normally only taken out
in parades, Ms. Stacks said. The truck was used to transport
firefighters, she said.
   Postel said 400 off-duty firefighters rushed back to work in San
Francisco, while others were unable to reach the city because of
traffic congestion and ruined roads.
   There has been criticism of the department's reduced manpower
and defective equipment. Only about 1,325 of 1,500 authorized
firefighting poisitions are filled, Postel said, and the department
suffers from a shortage of high-rise firefighting equipment and
reserve equipment.
   But Postel said he was satisfied with the department's
performance. He could not estimate how many firefighters responded
in total.

   The Who, Bobby Darin, the Four Tops and Simon
and Garfunkel were among eight recording artists selected Tuesday
to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.
   They will be inducted in January in New York City along with The
Four Seasons, The Kinks, The Platters and Hank Ballard in the class
of 1990.
   Their selections bring to 43 the number of recording acts chosen
for the hall of fame.
   In addition to the recording artists, three ``early
influencers'' were selected to be honored at the as-yet unbuilt
hall of fame and museum _ jazz singer-trumpeter Louis Armstrong,
jazz guitarist Charlie Christian and blues pioneer Ma Rainey.
   This year's selection of inductees was announced at a news
conference by Paul Shaffer, band leader on NBC's ``Late Night with
David Letterman'' and musical director of the rock hall induction
ceremony the past three years.
   ``This is a big year for me, personally. It's starting to move
into my era,'' Shaffer quipped. ``The first album I ever bought was
a Four Seasons Golden Hits. I still have that record I bought.''
   ``Bobby Darin was an idol of mine. I love the Four Tops. Simon
and Garfunkel. Hank Ballard. ... I'm thrilled with this year's
inductees,'' he said.
   Rock music historian Norm N. Nite, who has two syndicated radio
rock 'n' roll oldies shows, called the latest group of selections
``a good cross section'' of musical style. Nite, a member of the
rock hall board, said the class represents an effort to honor
entertainers who are long overdue for recognition.
   ``We're trying to get caught up on a lot of people owed getting
in. As years go by, it will get tighter and tighter,'' Nite said.
   Two songwriting teams will be inducted in the non-performing
music industry category, although some have been important
performers as well. The writers include the teams of Brian Holland,
Lamont Dozier and Eddie Holland, and Gerry Goffin and Carole King.
   Groundbreaking for the $48 million hall of fame and museum is
set for next year in downtown Cleveland next to the Cuyahoga River.
Larry Thompson, who is heading a fund-raising effort in Cleveland,
said he hopes to reach an interim goal of $40 million by Nov. 15.
   The hall of fame and museum is to open in 1992.
   More than 200 performers, producers, writers, record executives
and broadcasters cast ballots this year.
   Inducted earlier this year were Dion, Otis Redding, The Rolling
Stones, The Temptations and Stevie Wonder.
   The 1988 artists class included The Beach Boys, The Beatles, The
Drifters, Bob Dylan and The Supremes.
   The 1987 group was made up of The Coasters, Eddie Cochran, Bo
Diddley, Aretha Franklin, Marvin Gaye, Bill Haley, B.B. King, Clyde
McPhatter, Ricky Nelson, Roy Orbison, Carl Perkins, Smokey
Robinson, Joe Turner, Muddy Waters and Jackie Wilson.
   The original 1986 group was Chuck Berry, James Brown, Ray
Charles, Sam Cooke, Fats Domino, Everly Brothers, Buddy Holly,
Jerry Lee Lewis, Elvis Presley and Little Richard.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some of the nation's top math and science
teachers listened to a pep talk from President Bush Tuesday and
then lobbied on Capitol Hill for more money for training and
classroom equipment.
   ``As you know, science and math teachers are endangered
species,'' Victoria Sanchez of Albuquerque, N.M., told the House
Subcommittee on Science, Research and Technology.
   Ms. Sanchez, who teaches at Albuquerque's Van Buren Middle
School, the nation's 13th largest inner city school, was one of 112
teachers who received the Presidential Award for Excellence in
Mathematics and Science Teaching. She and a few others testified
before a special session of the subcommittee, which gathered
information on innovative ways to teach science and mathematics.
   The teachers' focus seemed to be more on money, however.
   Ms. Sanchez said Congress must consider increasing federal funds
for teacher training and equipment, and for special grants to those
teachers willing to work in rural and center city schools.
   She also asked that the federal government subsidize summer jobs
for many of the underpaid science and math teachers, as well as
memberships in various science programs.
   Anita Johnston of Napoleon, Mich., and Larry Williams of Eutaw,
Ala., asked that increased federal aid be targeted for mathematics
and science specialists to teach and lead research projects in
kindergarten through the third grade.
   ``Once we lose them in elementary school, they are gone,'' said
Kathy Davis, of New Orleans.
   During ceremonies in the White House Rose Garden under a
brilliant autumn sun, Bush told the teachers they have demonstrated
not only that excellence is possible in American education but that
it should ``be the norm.''
   Bush lamented that America's schools do not produce more top
performers in these subjects.
   ``You've seen all the surveys about American students' poor
performance in scientific knowledge compared to their peers around
the world. We've all seen it. We agonize over them,'' he said.
   ``You're not just complaining about it, you are doing something
about it. You're showing that excellence is not just possible in
American education, but that it ought to be the norm,'' the
president said.

   The Agriculture Department said Tuesday that
France has bought 5,000 metric tons of U.S. surplus butter at
cut-rate prices.
   F. Paul Dickerson, general sales manager of the department's
Foreign Agricultural Service, said the salted butter was sold to
Fromageries Dischamp of Sayat, France, a privately owned dairy
products firm.
   The contract calls for an option buy an additional 10,000 tons
of butter, subject to agreement by both parties. Dickerson said the
butter was sold for use in France or other European Economic
Community countries.
   The butter was sold for $1,620 per ton delivered to U.S. ports,
an average of less than 74 cents per pound. A metric ton is about
2,205 pounds.
   According to the department's Commodity Credit Corp., the
surplus butter cost about $1.40 per pound to acquire under the
government's dairy price support program.
   The 1985 farm law, as amended by the Hunger Relief Act of 1988,
requires the export sale of 150,000 tons of surplus dairy products
each fiscal year through September 30, 1990.
   Products sold under the program generally are at going world
prices.

<HEAD>Report Clothing and Dentral Charts to Help Identify Crash Victims</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Reports of the clothing and dental
charts of people killed in the crash of a Honduran airliner were
read on radio broadcasts Tuesday in an effort to help identify the
charred remains of many victims.
   A Boeing 727 of the TAN-SAHSA airline crashed into a mountain as
it approached the Tegucigalpa airport Saturday and 131 of the 146
people aboard were killed. Morgue officials said Tuesday the bodies
of 97 victims have been identified.
   The grim effort to identify the others continued.
   ``Body number five, female, wearing blue jeans, gold cap on the
third pre-molar,'' said a broadcast from the morgue by Radio HRN.
   ``Body number 10, male, 1.75 meters tall, green shirt, partial
dentures in upper jaw,'' the report said.
   ``Body number 79, male, apparentlyfrom Costa Rica, blue pants,
sweatshirt with the letter B. The body has no head.''
   Hundreds of people fearing relatives or friends perished in
crash have gone to the morgue and some have been able to assist in
the identifications.
   ``The easy ones are identified first. It's a slow process,''
said U.S. Embassy spokesman Terry Kneebone. He said 12 Americans
are presumed dead, but he could not say which bodies had been
identified because of privacy act considerations.
   Three Americans, the pilot, co-pilot and two flight attendants
were among the 15 survivors.
   The pilot was severely injured and investigators have been
unable to question him.
   Co-pilot Reiniero Canales said in a radio interview Monday that
the flight was normal unril ``suddenly we hit something. It was all
so fast we didn't have time to react.'' The jetliner was 1,800 feet
below its assigned flight path when it crashed into a mountain,
Cerro de Hule, about 6 miles south of the Tegucigalpa runway.
   Some investigators were considering air turbulence as the cause,
with two theories. One focused on an atmospheric phenomenon called
a ``rolling wave'' that would create a violent downdraft and the
other involved wind pressure created by a valley near the peak and
a low pressure zone behind the peak.
   ``We haven't definitively ruled anything out yet,'' said Barry
Trotter, head of a U.S. National Transportation Safety Board team
assisting the Honduran government.
   Bodies of 23 of the 67 Nicaraguan victims were flown Tuesday to
Managua. President Daniel Ortega and about 500 relatives and
friends of the victims were at the airport.
   The transfer had been planned for Monday but was delayed because
of preparation of the bodies and a shortage of metal caskets in
Honduras, according to Daniel Abud, a Nicaraguan Foreign Ministry
official in Managua.
   Ortega said the problems ``could have been overcome if there
were a little more willingness'' on the part of Honduras.
   Relations between Nicaragua and Honduras have been tense since
Nicaragua's left-wing Sandinistas came to power in 1979,
overthrowing conservative President Anastasio Somoza.
   Ortega said Honduran President Jose Azcona Hoyo had called him
to offer condolences and apologize for the difficulties.

<HEAD>Pentagon Extends Design Work On ATF Fighter</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pentagon announced on Tuesday it granted a
six-month extension for early design work on the Advanced Tactical
Fighter, a program that has come under fire from House lawmakers.
   While Pentagon and Air Force officials said they were unable to
determine an exact cost for the delay, one report put it between
$250 million and $500 million.
   The fighter, informally known as the ATF, is slated to be the
next-generation aircraft that will succeed the Air Force's F-15 and
the Navy's F-14D Tomcat fighter.
   Two design teams are competing to build the aircraft. Northrop
and McDonnell Douglas are building a prototype design known as
YF-23 while Lockheed, Boeing and General Dynamics are constructing
a prototype known as the YF-22.
   Congressional sources, who spoke on condition of not being
identified by name, said the delay was sought because the Lockheed
team was not as far along as the Northrop-led group.
   The source said the delay also ``gives the acquisition people in
DOD more time,'' to obtain more detailed test data and to decide
which version of the plane they want.
   John Betti, the undersecretary of defense for acquisition,
informed the Air Force and the Navy last Wednesday that a six-month
extension had been approved by the Defense Aquisition Board, the
Pentagon's top procurment panel, the Pentagon said in a brief
statement.
   The extension has been granted for the phase formally known as
the demonstration-validation phase.
   Air Force spokeswoman, Capt. Robin Crumm, said the delay is
designed to ``reduce the technical risk and cost uncertainties of
the program.''
   A report in Defense News, which cited unnamed Defense Department
and industry sources, said the cost of the anticipated contract
changes ranged from $250 million to $500 million.
   The report said Air Force officials expect to take the money
from funds earmarked for the plane's full-scale development phase.
   Crumm said she could not comment on the report.
   With the additional six-month delay, full-scale development of
the plane is not expected to begin before mid-1991.
   The lastest change follows a decision in January to lengthen the
full-scale development time for the plane from 23 months to 36
months. That is the time from when the contract is awarded until
the first flight of the plane is anticipated.
   In September, the House Armed Services Committee noted that the
cost of research and development of the ATF program has increased
by $900 million, to $13.5 billion, over the past six months.
   The problems prompted the House, in its appropriations bill, to
eliminate the $1.1 billion for the Air Force's fighter and $65
million for the Navy's version in the fiscal 1990 budget.
   The action by the House was considered a proverbial shot across
the bow, with members saying they expected the funding to be
restored once the final defense appropriations bill was passed.

<HEAD>Former Labor Secretary Tapped to Mediate Coal Dispute</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Labor Secretary William J. Usery Jr.
has been picked to mediate the six-month dispute between the United
Mine Workers and the Pittston Coal Group, sources said Tuesday.
   Current Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole is to formally announce
her choice Wednesday, but aides declined comment Tuesday on whom it
might be.
   Two sources familiar with the decision, speaking on the
condition they not be identified, said that Usery, who in the past
quarter century has helped settle dozens of bitter strikes, was
Dole's choice as ``supermediator'' for the coal strike, which began
April 5 and has idled 1,700 miners in three states.
   Mrs. Dole visited a Pittston facility in Carbo, Va., earlier
this month and days later met with UMW President Richard Trumka and
Pittston Co. Chairman Paul Douglas. After that session she
announced plans to name an outside mediator.
   Usery, who was labor secretary in the Ford administration, since
leaving government has headed a labor relations consulting firm in
Washington. He was out of town Tuesday but was scheduled to return
Tuesday night, his secretary said.
   There have been some talks involving the union and Pittston, but
only with federal mediators shuttling messages back and forth to
the separate rooms of union and company negotiators.
   The major issue in the strike, which affects Pittston mines in
Virginia, West Virginia and Kentucky, is health and retirement
benefits. Pittston withdrew last year from the Bituminous Coal
Operators Association, the national bargaining arm of most coal
companies, because it said the group had given the miners too much
medical coverage in its contract, particularly for pensioners.
   As labor secretary, Usery sometimes stepped into contract
disputes but Mrs. Dole has resisted such tactics in favor of
outside mediators.
   ``I am not a mediator,'' she said during her visit to the
Pittston facility. ``I'm not here to say I have the answer to this
complex problem. But I do feel now it is time to see if we can
facilitate the bargaining process.''
   In selecting Usery, Mrs. Dole turned to a man with an impressive
and lengthy resume as a mediator.
   In 1987 he was credited with forging a settlement to a six-month
strike by the United Auto Workers against the Deere &amp; Co. Four
years earlier, Chicago Mayor Harold Washington called Usery a
genius after he brought an end to a three-week strike by the city's
teachers, their longest ever, in just 24 hours. He also helped
settle a professional football strike in 1974 and has mediated
dozens of other disputes in the rubber, auto, electric, hotel,
transportation and other industries.
   Usery, a native of Hardwick, Ga., was brought to Washington in
1969 by then-President Nixon and named assistant secretary of
labor. He quickly was credited with helping settle railroad and
airline labor disputes. In 1973 he was named director of the
Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service and served in that post
for three years until Ford tapped him to head the Labor Department.

<HEAD>Gandhi Formally Opens Bid for Re-election</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SULTANPUR, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi on Tuesday
flew by helicopter to the country's most densely populated voter
belt and filed the papers that formally launch his quest for
re-election.
   The 45-year-old Gandhi, who pledged to uphold the constitution
after paying a $30 election filing fee, was then driven through
Sultanpur, a town of 100,000 in the northern state of Uttar
Pradesh. He was greeted by about 2,000 spectators.
   Political analysts say next month's parliamentary election could
be the closest in India's 42 years of independence.
   Gandhi, appearing in public for the first time since new
elections were announced a week ago, professed confidence his party
would return to power in the balloting for the lower house of
parliament set for Nov. 22, 24 and 26.
   ``The people are going to help us win the election,'' said
Gandhi, who was filing in the Amethi constituency that he has
represented since 1981.
   So far, there has been no indication of who the opposition will
chose to oppose Gandhi in this constituency. There has been
speculation the prime minister might face Vishwanath Pratap Singh,
a former ally now leading the National Front opposition coalition.
   ``I would welcome this,'' Gandhi told reporters, ``but he would
lose.''
   A month ago, a unified opposition seemed possible as Hindu
activists joined communists in anti-government protests.
   But recent outbreaks of Hindu-Moslem violence around India have
led the communists and some centrists to question the viability of
a broad opposition alliance. At least 79 people have died in
Hindu-Moslem clashes since August, including 23 last month in Uttar
Pradesh.
   The prospects of Gandhi's party are uncertain. The prime
minister has been haunted for more than two years by charges of
high level corruption in his government.
   Singh, often perceived as wishy-washy in his efforts to unite
opposition parties, is campaigning as ``Mr. Clean,'' just as Gandhi
himself did five years ago.
   The 58-year-old Singh, who once served as defense and finance
ministers in Gandhi's Cabinet, has seized on Indian newspaper
reports that Swedish arms manufacturer AB Bofors paid up to $50
million in kickbacks to secure a 1986 contract to deliver $1.4
billion worth of artillery guns to India.
   Gandhi has repeatedly denied the reports.
   Waiting for Gandhi on Tuesday, a score of men chanted that they
would vote for Congress Party.
   However, Bahadur Singh, a university student, interrupted the
chorus. ``We are free to cast our vote _ not necessarily for Rajiv
Gandhi,'' he said.
   Other spectators said they would vote for the National Front.
   ``We like V.P. Singh because he is an honest person,'' said
20-year-old Girish Kumar, another spectator.
   With more than 79 million eligible voters, Uttar Pradesh
controls 85 seats in the Lok Sabha, the lower policy-making house
of parliament, more than any of the other 24 states.
   This year, under a constitutional amendment initiated by Gandhi,
18- to 20-year-olds can vote in the national election for the first
time. They comprise 7 percent of the electorate of 500 million.
Indians will vote in 542 constituencies.

<TEXT>
   Private insurance and health care should be
opened up to more people through a system of legal requirements and
increased taxes, state and congressional officials said Tuesday.
   ``Although we may not be able to provide universal health care
in our country at this time, we ought to provide universal access
to health insurance in the private sector,'' said Rep Doug Walgren,
D-Pa.
   Rep. Edward Roybal, D-Calif., chairman of the House Select
Committee on Aging proposed a ``rearrangement of present plans ...
to place the burdens on all Americans'' in his testimony at a
hearing of the U.S. Bipartisan Commission on Comprehensive Health
Care.
   ``We must be able to expand the cigarette tax,'' Walgren said,
explaining that surveys show Americans are willing to pay increased
taxes to solve pressing national and ethical problems such as
health care.
   Walgren, a member of the House Energey and Commerce subcommittee
on health and environment complained that health insurers want to
provide coverage only to the healthy leaving 20 percent of all
applicants for private insurance without adequate coverage because
of exclusions or above-average premiums for pre-existing medical
conditions.
   He has introduced legislation to prohibit private insurers from
denying coverage in such situations.
   Expansion of the payroll tax, increased estate and gift taxes
and universal mandatory health insurance are solutions to the
nation's health care crisis, said Barbara Matula, North Carolina's
Medicaid director.
   ``We are mandated to have car insurance and fire insurance. We
can be mandated to pay health insurance,'' said Matula, who
represented the American Public Welfare Association at Tuesday's
hearing.
   Business representatives argued mandated benefits would increase
costs and threaten the viability of small businesses that employ
most new American workers.
   But Matula insisted workers and employers not be allowed to opt
out of paying health insurance premiums because they would provide
funding for coverage for themselves, their families and the
unemployed.
   While not offering specific strategies or solutions, Melvin
Glasser, director of the Committee for National Health Insurance, a
20-year-old coalition of about 40 individuals and labor leaders
pleaded with the commission not to ``try again to resort to
piecemeal, patchwork methods'' like the catastrophic health care
program.
   The House repealed the program outright and the Senate
drastically cut its funding. The differences among lawmakers are
being worked out by a budget conference committee.
   The 15-member panel, known as the Pepper Commission for the late
Florida congressman who was its first chairman and creator, was
born in the catastrophic care law. It is to submit to Congress a
proposal for health care reforms entailing what benefits to provide
to whom and how to pay for them.
   There are an estimated 31 million people who have no health
insurance, more than 9 million Americans who need long-term care
and 13.5 million underinsured who can not get adequate health care
because of financial constraints.
   The commission is scheduled to hold at least one additional
hearing before making its final report to Congress by March 1, 1990.

   Acting just a week after the nation's most
costly natural disaster, the House on Tuesday voted to speed $2.85
billion in earthquake-relief aid to Northern California.
   State lawmakers said more money would be needed later to finish
the job.
   The House approved the appropriation by a vote of 321-99. The
Senate is expected to concur Wednesday and send the legislation to
President Bush, whose spokesman indicated he would sign the bill.
   ``We were hit by 10 times the amount of explosive power of World
War II, including the atomic bomb,'' Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.,
told her colleagues before the vote.
   ``Please give us a chance to rebuild,'' said Pelosi, who
represents San Francisco's heavily damaged Marina District.
   Rep. Vic Fazio, D-Calif., leading his state's efforts to garner
federal assistance, said that with the House vote, ``We're off to a
good start.''
   But he noted that the $2.85 billion was less than the state's
delegation had sought and said efforts would be made to increase
the relief fund when the bill reaches the Senate _ or in future
legislation.
   California's two senators, working with the Senate's leaders,
hoped to pave the way for more assistance when their chamber
debates the measure Wednesday.
   Sens. Alan Cranston, a Democrat, and Pete Wilson, a Republican,
said they would seek authority for an additional $600 million for
small business aid. That money would need subsequent legislation to
be appropriated.
   The senators said they would also seek several amendments easing
federal restrictions, such as one making the damaged Bay Bridge
ineligible for federal aid because it is a toll facility.
   Still, the $2.85 billion package would be the largest single
congressional disaster-relief appropriation ever, dwarfing the $1.1
billion approved just last month for the victims of Hurricane Hugo.
   The $2.85 billion is a compromise between the $3.8 billion
California representatives had sought and the $2.5 billion the Bush
administration had proposed. Presidential spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater said the administration supported the compromise because
it was ``pretty close to ours.''
   Here is how the $2.85 billion would be allocated:
   _$1.1 billion would go to the Federal Emergency Management
Agency to aid victims and local governments get back on their feet.
   _$1 billion would go for bridge and highway repairs.
   _$500 million would go to aid small businesses.
   _$250 million would be set aside in for kitty for Bush to spend
for the victims as he sees fit.
   Damage estimates from the earthquake have topped $7 billion.
   A 50-foot section of the Bay Bridge toppled and must be
replaced; double-deck highways on both sides of San Francisco bay
sustained severe damage; up to 1,000 homes in San Francisco alone
are said to need extensive repairs.
   At least 63 people died.
   Earlier this week, the Independent Insurance Agents of America
estimated damage from the quake at $7.1 billion. Damage from Hugo
had been estimated at $4 billion to $5 billion and from the 1906
San Francisco quake _ the previous record _ at $5.8 billion after
adjustments for inflation.
   Money allocated to the Federal Emergency Management Agency will
provide for temporary housing, home repairs, unemployment payments,
grants to families and assistance for local governments.
   There was no dispute over the need for the emergency allocation
among lawmakers, who considered the proposal with unusual speed.
Much debate focused on whether the spending in the legislation _
and in the earlier measure to aid victims of Hugo _ should be
included in the government's calculations of the federal deficit.
   On a 401-18 vote, the House decided it should. The shortfall for
fiscal 1990, which began Oct. 1, has previously been projected by
the Congressional Budget Office to be $141 billion.
   The $2.85 billion was approved as part of an emergency spending
bill needed to keep the government functioning until Nov. 15. The
legal authority that most agencies have to spend money expires at
midnight Wednesday.
   The special legislation is needed because only two of the 13
annual appropriations bills for fiscal 1990, which began Oct. 1,
have been signed into law.

   West Germany's defense minister said
Tuesday the Kremlin admission that one of its radars violates the
1972 ABM treaty was a ``remarkable'' example of the change taking
place in the Soviet Union.
   Gerhard Stoltenberg said the speech Monday by Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze containing the statement was ``a
true sign of glasnost,'' the policy of openness promoted by
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Stoltenberg and the other NATO defense ministers are in this
resort for a semiannual meeting of the Western alliance's Nuclear
Planning Group.
   ``The fact that he stands up and says straight out that
Krasnoyarsk was a violation of the anti-ballistic missile treaty is
a whole new language,'' Stoltenberg told reporters after the
Tuesday afternoon session.
   He said there had been no time for a full analysis of the
changes under way in the Soviet bloc.
   Frits Bolkestein, the Dutch defense minister, said the final
statement Wednesday was expected to welcome Shevardnadze's pledge
that the Krasnoyarsk radar in Siberia would be dismantled.
   ``It was an acknowledgement of what the United States has
maintained for a long time ... and we obviously applaud this
recognition,'' said a senior U.S. official, who demanded anonymity.
   Shevardnadze, speaking to the Soviet legislature, said the
Krasnoyarsk radar had been a stumbling block to agreement with the
West on other arms issues.
   ``We are saving the ABM treaty and opening the way to the
conclusion of a treaty on strategic weapons,'' Shevardnadze said.
   He also said the Soviet Union was prepared to withdraw all
military forces to its own territory by the year 2000 and negotiate
elimination of the opposing NATO and Warsaw Pact alliances.
   The NATO defense ministers, meeting for two days at the Quinta
do Lago vacation complex on Portugal's southern Algarve coast,
rejected the latter idea.
   ``I can assure you, we're not thinking of disbanding NATO,''
Stoltenberg said, and called Shevardnadze's offer ``an old formula
... more vague and abstract'' than before.
   Bolkestein said: ``There's not much left of the Warsaw Pact in
terms of true cohesion. The same thing cannot be said of NATO.''
   Hungary and Poland have are moving away from one-party Communist
rule and Moscow has made no move to stop them, but they have sworn
continued allegiance to the Eastern defense alliance.
   Stoltenberg said ministers agreed Tuesday that the future role
of NATO nuclear forces would be studied after the signing of a
conventional arms reduction treaty, expected at the end of talks
now being conducted in Vienna, Austria.
   He said he expected preliminary drafts of six papers for the
study to be ready next year and anticipated ``concrete proposals''
by 1991.
   During the morning session, U.S. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney
said Soviet spending on strategic and space weapons had not slowed
under Gorbachev's program of reform, officials reported.
   U.S. aides estimated the Kremlin spends $20 billion to $40
billion a year on its space program, Dutch officials said.
   All 16 NATO nations attend the nuclear strategy sessions except
France, which is not a member of NATO's integrated military
structure. Iceland, which has no armed forces, attends as an
observer.

   Stormy weather spread wind and rain across the Pacific Coast
with snow inland over the mountains Tuesday, while the extreme
north-central part of the nation basked in record warmth.
   A cold front pushing in from the Gulf of Alaska was followed by
showers and thunderstorms Tuesday over northern California and
western Oregon.
   Snow fell at some higher elevations of California and
west-central Nevada.
   Upper elevations of the Sierra Nevada above Lake Tahoe received
1 to 2 feet of snow late Monday and into early Tuesday, the
National Weather Service said. An additional 4 to 6 inches of was
expected on the eastern slopes of the central Sierra Nevada.
   The storm that arrived Monday, the first real snow storm of the
season, forced closure of a state highway into Yosemite National
Park and prompted the California Highway Patrol to require chains
on roads through the mountains.
   Elsewhere, showers and thunderstorms were scattered along the
east coast of Florida during the afternoon, and a few showers were
scattered along the coast of Texas.
   Heaviest rainfall during the six-hour period up to 2 p.m. EDT
was 1.09 inches at West Palm Beach, Fla.
   Early morning dense fog was reported in Lower Michigan,
northeastern Illinois, southwestern Ohio and east-central Louisiana.
   Record temperatures were 76 at Fargo, N.D., and 73 at
International Falls, Minn., the town in extreme northern Minnesota
that usually calls itself the nation's icebox.
   Temperatures dipped into the 20s and 30s overnight in the
Rockies, the northern Atlantic Coast, the northern Plains, the
upper Mississippi Valley, the upper Great Lakes and the middle
Atlantic Coast region.
   Tuesday morning's low for the Lower 48 states was 12 degrees at
Gunnison, Colo.

   Congressional investigators have held talks
with an attorney for a main figure in the probe of scandals at the
Department of Housing and Urban Development, but a spokesman for
the panel chairman said Tuesday they have not offered immunity to
obtain testimony.
   Bob King, administrative assistant to Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif.,
chairman of a subcommittee investigating the department, said talks
have taken place between the panel's staff and a lawyer for R.
Hunter Cushing, former deputy assistant secretary at HUD.
   King said Cushing has begun to cooperate and provide information
to the panel.
   Cushing is one of four former HUD officials who has cited
constitutional rights against self-incrimination in refusing to
testify before Congress in its investigation of alleged influence
peddling, fraud and mismanagement in the department.
   Citing sources it did not identify, The New York Times reported
Tuesday that the House panel has begun immunity discussions with
Cushing's attorney.
   King said immunity has not been discussed or considered,
although he did not rule it out. ``At this point, Mr. Lantos isn't
thinking about doing that,'' King said.
   Jamie Gorelick, Cushing's attorney, said she has met with staff
of Lantos' subcommittee but she declined to comment on the subject
of the talks. Stuart Weisberg, staff director of the panel, also
declined to comment on the content of the talks.
   Cushing had been scheduled to appear before the subcommittee of
the House Government Operations Committee last week, but Lantos
cancelled the meeting, saying he needed to return to his Northern
California district because of the earthquake.
   Gorelick said ``it was unclear what was going to happen on that
date,'' had the meeting been held. She said, ``It might be a little
strong to say he's cooperating'' with the panel.

   As a governor's panel prepares to
probe the deadly earthquake-collapse of Interstate 880, outsiders
are hurling their theories at state officials inundated by ``Monday
morning quarterbacks.''
   California Transportation Department officials have declined to
speculate on the collapse and are refusing to share information
they might have about why a 1\-mile section of freeway in Oakland
fell down in the massive quake.
   Thirty-nine bodies have been recovered from the rubble of I-880
_ making up more than half the 63 quake casualties. More are
expected from the collapse as rescuers carefully search the
unstable rubble.
   Outside engineers and structural experts, whose views are being
sought largely by the news media, are blaming everything from a
lack of steel in the vertical columns to unstable soil beneath the
structure and the peculiar way the structure may have synchronized
with earthquake waves.
   Few have visited the wreckage and must draw their conclusions
from news accounts and pictures. Caltrans ``is still not letting
anybody in but their own people to take a look,'' complained
scientist Glenn Borchardt, an expert on soil stability with the
state Division of Mines and Geology.
   ``We're not going to get into that,'' said Caltrans structural
chief Jim Roberts when asked again if the department has ideas
about the cause of the collapse. The department maintains that it
was as surprised as Gov. George Deukmejian that the structure fell
down, and spokesman Jim Drago said the agency is tired of all the
``Monday morning quarterbacks.''
   ``I've been assured there were no experts, no studies, no data
that suggested in any way that it would fall,'' said Caltrans
Director Robert Best.
   But in the quake's wake, experts are offering their theories,
and old studies and documents are beginning to surface.
   Generally, experts and Caltrans agree on a general observation:
the structure, opened in July 1957, was built with out-of-date
earthquake safety codes, and the materials used, such as concrete,
are not as strong as material available today.
   Beyond that, the theories are varied.
   Among them:
   _An engineer hired by The New York Times, Dr. Piotr D. Moncarz
of Palo Alto, who was able to visit the site, suggested that the
freeway was brought down partly because seismic waves coincided
with the swinging of the structure, amplifying the quake's power.
   _Soils expert Borchardt, who first raised the soil instability
issue in a 1982 report on earthquake dangers, said the ground
beneath the structure, made up largely of clay, may have
``liquefied'' or at least ``amplified'' the quake's effect.
   _Former state highway engineer Jim See said the freeway fell
because reinforcing bar in the concrete pillars was not braced or
wrapped with more steel.
   _Dr. Nigel Priestly, a structural expert at the University of
California at San Diego, said lack of steel in the columns
contributed to their collapse, but added that steel connections
holding the roadway to the columns also were suspect.
   _John Kariotis, a South Pasadena structural engineer, said the
columns could have been strengthened with steel jackets to avoid
collapse, an argument rejected by Roberts, who said their own
experiments showed that wouldn't have worked.
   In the end, Drago said, all the theories might turn out to be
correct, but they're little help now because ``You never get two
engineers to agree on anything.''

<TEXT>
   East Germany disbanded six tank regiments Tuesday
as part of unilateral disarmament plans the communist nation
announced earlier this year.
   The regiments were located at six garrisons around the country,
the official news agency ADN reported.
   It said 600 T-54 and T-55 tanks would either be destroyed or
converted for civilian use. It did not say what the civilian uses
would be or how many tanks were deactivated Tuesday.
   ADN also did not report how many soldiers were involved, but
said 400 were in one of the regiments.
   East Germany announced in January it would reduce its armed
forces by 10,000 soldiers, 600 tanks and 50 fighter aircraft.
   Some tanks were dismantling last summer and several hundred
soldiers were transferred to reserve units, the agency reported.
   Col. Gen. Horst Stechbarth said transferred soldiers would
``have a new task in the army or in the civilian economy.''
   Maj. Gen. Manfred Jonischkies, the tank division's commander,
said its anti-aircraft and anti-tank capabilities would be
increased. He said the changes were being made under ``the terms of
a Warsaw Pact treaty that calls for strategic changes that lead to
a more defensive posture.''

<HEAD>Panel Proposes Creating Arctic Demilitarized Zone</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OTTAWA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Canada should help create a demilitarized zone in
the Arctic, a panel recommended Tuesday at a conference on
cooperation with the Soviet Union.
   The proposal came as part of arms-control discussions for the
region by the 13-member panel that included disarmament experts,
retired Canadian military officers and native Indian
representatives.
   The recommendations, including an end to simulated bombings over
the region, came on the second day of a four-day conference on
Canadian-Soviet Arctic cooperation.
   In its recommendations, the panel said the Arctic should be made
into a demilitarized zone that prohibits military aircraft carrying
nuclear weapons from flying in or out of the region.
   However, it said under its proposal that members of NATO and the
Warsaw Pact would be allowed to fly over the region to verify
arms-control agreements.
   The panel also said the superpowers should agree to strict
limits or a total ban on sea-launched cruise missiles from Arctic
waters.
   The group further called for the Soviet Union to agree to keep
its submarines out of Canada's Arctic waters and halt weapons tests
at Novaya Zemlya in the Soviet Arctic.
   At a conference dinner Monday, Canada's junior minister for
Indian and northern affairs said negotiating Arctic security issues
outside of East-West arms talks now under way could prove
destabilizing.
   The minister, Kim Campbell, said the best way to ensure peace
and security in the Arctic ``is to lend full support to the
East-West negotiations on arms control.''
   Andrei Granowsky, a Soviet Foreign Ministry official, said he
couldn't comment officially because the conference proposals didn't
come from the Canadian government. However, he said Soviets
attending the conference had welcomed the ideas.
   ``We appreciate the fact that Canadian scholars are expressing
new ideas to strengthen security in the region,'' he said. ``We
need a stockpile of ideas for future dialogue. We ourselves are
searching for new concepts.''
   The conference was sponsored by the Arms Control Center, an
independent Ottawa think-tank, and the Union of the Soviet
Friendship Societies, a group that promotes multinational
cooperation.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   California state lawmakers who spent Tuesday
in Washington said they were encouraged by meetings with
administration officials and a House vote for an earthquake relief
package, but the praise was less than unanimous.
   ``We think we have been very successful here as it relates to
the administration,'' said State Senator Bill Campbell, discussing
meetings held with a variety of federal officials. ``Our
congressional delegation has been successful.''
   ``We're very happy with our input here,'' said Campbell, a
Republican.
   Campbell said the group of six assembly members and four
senators met with Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner, Housing
Secretary Jack Kemp, acting Federal Emergency Management Agency
chief Grant Peterson; the deputy director of the Office of
Management and Budget and a member of the White House staff.
   He said that among the progress made was a ``commitment (by
FEMA) to look at the idea'' of sending in trailers to house the
8,000 to 10,000 people left homeless in Santa Cruz and Watsonville
areas south of San Francisco; a commitment from FEMA to extend
emergency housing grants to three months for renters and more than
four months for homeowners if needed; a promise to expand the
number of disaster application centers if necessary; and a move by
Kemp to free $500 million for earthquake aid.
   Campbell also said that the Small Business Administration will
get together with the Office of Management and Budget to talk about
raising the current cap on home repair loans by the Small Business
Administration from $100,000 to $500,000.
   Lawmakers say raising the cap is necessary given the high cost
of real estate in the area and it could be done with an
administrative order if budget director Richard Darman would agree.
   The aid package passed by the House includes a requirement that
the cap be raised. Californians have argued that the action would
be too slow.
   State Assemblyman Richard Katz, a Democrat who heads the
Assembly's Transportation Committee, said he was generally
satisfied with the response from Washington but was concerned about
the source of the $1 billion in bridge and road repair funds from
Tuesday's House-passed legislation.
   ``The billion dollars that you heard talked about for
transportation to some extent right now is a fiction,'' he said.
``It's a billion dollars that would have come to California anyhow
over the next several years, and under the current proposal we're
getting it earlier.''
   ``We will go back to the state today with better feelings than
we came, more work that needs to be done,'' he said. ``We will go
into special session next week and we will probably either generate
some sales tax revenue or some additional revenue on our side to do
part of the job from our standpoint. But again, we're going to need
additional help from the White House.''

<TEXT>
   The Arab League on Tuesday promised
an accord for a complete Syrian troop withdrawal from Lebanon,
where Christian leader Gen. Michel Aoun rejected a peace plan that
lacks a timetable.
   Thousands of Aoun supporters demonstrated in Beirut on Tuesday
and burned tires in the streets after Moslem and Christian members
of Lebanon's Parliament approved the plan in Taif, Saudi Arabia, on
Sunday.
   The peace plan, which is aimed at ending 14 years of
Christian-Moslem fighting, gives more political power to the Moslem
majority. It also says Syria, which backs Moslem leaders, must pull
its troops out of the Lebanese capital within two years.
   But the forces, estimated at 40,000, could remain in the eastern
Bekaa valley near the Syrian border, and the plan had no timetable
for a total withdrawal.
   The Arab League said the duration of the Syrian forces' stay in
the Bekaa ``will be defined by an accord between the Syrian and
Lebanese governments.'' The 22-member Arab League, it said, ``will
be charged with concluding and implementing that accord.''
   The commitment came in a document read by Saudi Foreign Minister
Prince Saud al-Faisal at the closing session of the Lebanese
Parliament that was called by the Arab League.
   The document called on the Lebanese Parliament to meet in
Lebanon no later than Nov. 7 to ratify political reforms that were
agreed upon in the peace plan and to elect a president for their
fractured nation.
   The five-page document was signed by the Arab League committee,
comprising King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, Morocco's King Hassan II and
Algerian President Chadli Bendjedid. The three leaders were asked
by an Arab League summit meeting in May to try to help find a
settlement to the sectarian turmoil in Lebanon.
   King Fahd, chairing the closing session in the Red Sea port of
Jiddah, told the 63 Parliamentarians present that the peace plan
reached in the resort of Taif was a ``great achievement.''
   He thanked Syrian President Hafez Assad and President Saddam
Hussein of Iraq for their cooperation, indicating he had won
approval from the two enemies to stop arming rival factions in
Lebanon. Saddam backs the Christians, and Assad is the Moslems'
main supporter.
   Fahd promised unspecified financial support to ``restore Lebanon
better than it was'' once the peace plan is carried out.
   But as the final meeting got under way, 10,000 young followers
of Aoun marched through the Christian enclave north of Beirut to
protest the accord.
   Addressing the demonstrators, Aoun said the reference in the
peace accord to the timing of a Syrian withdrawal ``is very vague,
from now until eternity.''
   ``We don't want to give away our beloved land,'' he said.
   The peace accord also would eventually lead to the disbanding of
militias, and the main Shiite groups, the Syrian-backed Amal and
the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, have rejected the accord. Druse warlord
Walid Jumblatt also has criticized it.
   Samir Geagea, who commands the main Christian militia, the
Lebanese Forces, still has not committed himself either way.
   Syrian forces came to Lebanon under a 1976 Arab League
Peacekeeping mandate and now control 70 percent of Lebanese
territory. Aoun claims the Syrians have violated their mandate by
siding with Moslems in the civil war, and his 20,000 troops fought
the Syrians for six months until the Arab League-brokered
cease-fire Sept. 22.
   Aoun, a Maronite Catholic, has not openly criticized any of the
political reforms suggested in the peace charter that are mainly
designed to give Moslems an equal share of power with the
Christians.
   These include increasing Parliament seats from 99 to 108, to
give Moslems equal representation in the legislature.
   The reforms also redistribute the powers of the president,
traditionally a Maronite Catholic, the prime minister, a Sunni
Moslem, and the Parliament speaker, a Shiite Moslem, to ensure
wider Moslem participation in the decision-making process.
   Christians have dominated power since independence from France
in 1943, when they were considered the majority. Moslems now make
up 55 percent of the population of 4 million.
   Lebanon has been without a head of state since Amin Gemayel's
term expired Sept. 22, 1988, with Parliament unable to meet to
elect a successor. The vacuum produced two rival Cabinets, one
Christian headed by Aoun, and a Syrian-backed government headed by
Salim Hoss, a Sunni.

   The national Jaycees president said Tuesday
he plans to go to the Soviet Union in December to help three
Estonian groups become chapters of the service organization.
   ``If we can get them going in the Soviet Union, we can get in
the other Eastern bloc nations as well,'' said Robby Dawkins, U.S.
Jaycees president.
   Dawkins was in Nebraska to recognize the state's high national
ranking in the organization.
   He said in a telephone interview he would go to the Soviet Union
Dec. 1-15 ``to try to start Jaycees chapters behind the Iron
Curtain.''
   ``If we can get the Jaycees started over there, and if they
don't get oppressed and they are free to learn and grow as
individuals, then we might possibly be changing the course of
history in the next 25 years when those people who were in Jaycees
become the leaders,'' he said.
   The U.S. Jaycees began 70 years ago with 29 chapters and has
grown to 240,000 members in 5,000 communities, he said. There are
Jaycees chapters in 93 countries, including Poland where one began
about two years ago, Dawkins said.

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev sees rosier
prospects in 12-18 months for his campaign to improve the economy
and put more consumer goods on the shelves, Tass reported Tuesday.
   The official news agency said the Gorbachev, who has pressed for
reform since gaining power in March 1985, spoke to journalists from
the Communist Party daily Pravda on Monday. Ivan T. Frolov, a
Gorbachev confidant, was named editor-in-chief of Pravda last week.
   Concern is widespread that people may go hungry this winter
because of food shortages, which have caused rationing of meat, tea
and other staples. Ethnic violence has contributed to shortages in
some areas and has raised fears of mass unrest.
   Such problems have created disenchantment with Gorbachev's
``perestroika'' reform program and some people even blame it for
the nation's woes.
   Gorbachev told Pravda reporters ``the acuteness of the problems
encountered by the country should be alleviated ... within 12-18
months,'' Tass said, paraphrasing his remarks and not giving
reasons for such a precise forecast.
   It said Gorbachev expressed confidence that, ``rallying all
scientists and creative people in society, the country will be able
to improve the financial situation and the situation in the
consumer market, continue and deepen economic reform, arrest
negative processes and set the beginning to the improvement of the
situation.''
   He said ``unpopular measures'' might be needed, Tass reported
without giving details.
   The agency's dispatch said Gorbachev felt the most important
contribution the press could make at this stage was to ``promote
the values and ideas of perestroika.''

<DATELINE>WATSONVILLE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. George Deukmejian said Tuesday
that tax increases to pay for last week's devastating earthquake
would be a last resort he would turn to only if federal aid and the
state surplus prove insufficient.
   ``I certainly have not ruled out the possibility of a tax
increase,'' the governor said after a briefing with disaster
officials in Watsonville, California's ``salad bowl,'' where much
of the state's lettuce, artichokes and berries are harvested.
   ``We are going to have to see whether or not there is going to
be a need for additional revenues,'' said Deukmejian, speaking to
reporters over the din of power saws, hammers and tractors in the
central city.
   ``We are waiting to see what the federal government is going to
do. They are moving very quickly,'' the governor said.
   The U.S. House on Tuesday passed a $2.85 billion aid package and
sent the measure to the Senate. The state surplus stands at $1
billion.
   Deukmejian on Monday said a special session of the state
Legislature would be called in the next two weeks to evaluate
earthquake damage and arrange for relief that could include a
temporary increase in sales or gasoline taxes.
   The Legislature completed its 1989 session Sept. 16 and is not
due to return until January.
   The governor also said Monday that he and legislative leaders
discussed the possibility of holding an earlier, special election
to consider a ballot measure currently slated for June 1990. That
proposal would liberalize the state's spending limit and pave the
way for a gradual 9-cent gasoline tax increase.
   The governor flew to Watsonville on Tuesday for a briefing on
damages by city Fire Chief Gary Smith, who said, ``Hopefully within
the year we will be back on our feet and you won't even notice.''
   As of Tuesday, the damage total was near a half-billion dollars
in Watsonville, a community of 27,000 people. Regionwide, estimates
topped $7 billion from the Oct. 17 quake.
   The city's Main Street was still cordoned off and thousands of
people either displaced from their homes or too frightened to
return indoors, congregated in makeshift tent cities.
   Outside Salvation Army headquarters, about 50 people lined up
for tents, sleeping bags, clothing, food and household items. But
outside the Main Street area, businesses were open.
   Spokeswoman Colleen McQuillan said the Red Cross fed breakfast
to 5,357 people Tuesday. The city estimates 1,200 residents are out
of their homes because of the quake, while Red Crross and Salvation
Army say up to 5,000 people are sleeping in tents.
   Deukmejian met privately with officials in City Hall, and later
with Smith in an open session. Spokesman Kevin Brett said it was
unnecessary for the governor to get out of his car to see the
damage or suffering.
   ``As you are driving into town, the damage is very evident,''
Brett said.

<HEAD>Sen. Boren Says No Difference With Bush</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERENCE P. HUNT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP White House Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of the Senate intelligence
committee said Tuesday that he and President Bush have ``no
philosophical difference'' about easing guidelines for involvement
by CIA operatives in coups in which a foreign leader might be
killed.
   Sen. David Boren, D-Okla, said he wanted to clear up ambiguities
in the guidelines within ``a matter of days or a few weeks as
opposed to months.''
   Saying that reports of disagreement with Bush were greatly
exaggerated, Boren said, ``We're working in perfect harmony. We
have not had a quarrelsome word about it. We have no philosophical
difference.''
   Bush had similar remarks about Boren the day before.
   The unsuccessful coup attempt against Panamanian Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega brought to light a series of classified guidelines
that restrict the actions of CIA officials under a longstanding
prohibition against assassinations.
   Bush reportedly complained last week in a private meeting that
an understanding reached between the Reagan administration and the
Senate intelligence panel could, if narrowly interpreted, require
the United States to warn Noriega of any coup that might endanger
his life.
   Boren confirmed that his committee and the Reagan administration
reached an understanding last year to restrict covert activities
against Noriega because of the presidential elections in the United
States.
   ``The committee said, `Let's wait _ we've got an election season
_ to let the new president-elect have some input into it,''' Boren
said.
   Boren, speaking with reporters at the White House, endorsed the
administation's call for a freer hand.
   ``I for one don't believe that the prohibition against
assassinations should keep you from working with someone that might
want to overthrow a government,'' Boren said.
   ``Those people wouldn't be aimed at hurting anyone or
assassinating anyone,'' the senator said. ``They want to overthrow
a government. You can't guarantee that someone might not get hurt
in overthrowing a government.
   ``I certainly don't believe there should be any affirmative
obligation to inform someone like Gen. Noriega of any plan that we
might learn about that might harm him in any way,'' he said. ``I
think that goes far beyond what the executive order ever intended.''
   Boren was among a group of senators that met with Bush on his
campaign for a cut in the capital gains tax rate. However, he was
questioned by reporters later about the restrictions on CIA agents.
   ``The president and I have not had a feud about this,'' Boren
said. ``In fact we were just joking about it a minute ago. We don't
know where the feud came from.''

<TEXT>
   The government, in an effort to quell violence
by leftist guerrillas before municipal elections, on Tuesday placed
Lima and the nearby port of Callao under state-of-emergency rule
for 30 days.
   Rebels of the Maoist Shining Path movement have vowed to
sabotage the elections set for Nov. 12.
   Guerrillas late Monday seized 10 buses in Lima and Callao, five
miles west of the capital, and after ordering the occupants out
burned the vehicles, according to police. No one was injured in the
attacks.
   The state of emergency restricts civil rights, including the
right of free movement and guarantees against search and seizure,
and gives the military broad powers.
   Lima and Callao have been under a state of emergency almost
constantly since February 1986. The last decree affecting the two
cities expired in July.
   The government on Tuesday also extended state-of-emergency
restrictions in the Andean province of Yauyos in Lima department,
the official newspaper El Peruano reported.
   On Monday the government imposed emergency rule in four other
provinces in Lima department, giving the military control over most
of the state.
   A department is the largest political subdivision in Peru and is
divided into provinces.
   More than one third of Peru and about half of the country's 21
million people are now under emergency rule.
   The government has used state-of-emergency decrees to combat
terrorism since 1982. The decrees are normally for periods ranging
from 30 to 60 days and are routinely extended.
   Shining Path guerrillas began their compaign to gain power in
1980. The government has said more than 15,000 people have been
killed in violence related to the insurgency.

   More than 300 athletes are being dropped
from a U.N. list aimed at isolating South Africa by drawing
attention to athletes who competed in its racially segregated
system, an official said Tuesday.
   Over 3,000 athletes are listed in the ``Register of Sports
Contacts with South Africa,'' which is put together by the U.N.
Special Committee Against Apartheid.
   By publishing the list of athletes and a similar list for
cultural events, the United Nations hopes to isolate South Africa
until it abolishes the apartheid system of racial discrimination.
   U.N. Ambassador James Gbeho of Ghana announced Tuesday that 328
cricket players and motorcyclists who competed in South Africa
before April 1 would be deleted from the list.
   The agreement to pare down the list was reached at the urging of
the International Cricket Conference and the International
Motorcycling Federation, both of which are shunning the apartheid
state, said Gbeho.
   However, the removal of names is on a one-time basis, and
cricketers and motorcyclists will still be added to the list if
they compete in South Africa in the future, he said.
   The deletions include motorcyclists from the United States,
Britain and 14 other countries.

   President Bush, impatient with Congress'
refusal to vote him line-item veto powers, is considering casting
such a veto anyway ``to see if it works,'' spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater said Tuesday.
   Fitzwater told reporters that the White House is seeking
legislation on which Bush could exercise a partial veto _ and allow
the courts to decide whether the president acted legally.
   ``We are looking for a vehicle that might be a suitable test
case, but at this point we don't have one,'' Fitzwater said.
   Rep. Don Edwards, D-Calif., chairman of the civil and
constitutional rights subcommittee of the House Judiciary
Committee, said Tuesday that presidents do not have line-item veto
authority under the Constitution.
   ``That is an idea that many of us would resist very
diligently,'' Edwards said in an interview. ``It would give the
president enormous new legislative powers that our founding fathers
didn't have in mind for the president.''
   He said that were Bush to try to cast such a veto, ``a majority
of the members of the Judiciary Committee'' would promptly take him
to court.
   Such a move _ vetoing just one part of a bill while leaving the
rest intact _ would be certain to provoke a major constitutional
confrontation with the Democratic majority in both the House and
the Senate, Fitzwater conceded.
   ``We've got a lot of issues that probably wouldn't sit well with
the Democratic leadership. But there is a larger question here,''
Fitzwater said. He said that he assumed that such a veto would be
challenged immediately in court.
   Bush, and President Reagan before him, proposed a constitutional
amendment to spell out a right to vetosingle items in spending
bills. However, such proposals have never gotten far in Congress.
   Both Bush and Budget Director Richard Darman have raised the
possibility of proceeding directly with such a veto to provoke a
court challenge.
   But the subject gained new attention with a comment on Monday by
Vice President Dan Quayle in Chicago.
   Asked if Bush were prepared to make such a challenge now, Quayle
said: ``This is an issue in which he has stated a great deal of
interest. And if he can find an appropriate part of a piece of
legislation to test that constitutionality, I think that he would
be inclined to do so.'
   Fitzwater said the administration is willing to force the issue
and prompt a court case, believing that the president has such
powers and should be able to exercise them.
   ``You just try to do it and see if it works. ... You claim you
have the authority and you just do it,'' Fitzwater said.
   Meanwhile, the spokesman said the president was intensifying his
campaign for a cut in the tax on capital gains and plans to meet
with senators, mostly Democrats, this week to lobby for the plan,
which has already passed the House.
   Fitzwater declared that the administration has the votes to pass
the cut _ if it can have a straight majority-rule vote on the
measure in the Senate.
   ``Give us an opportunity for a vote, that's all we ask,''
Fitzwater said, accusing Senate Democratic leaders of holding up
the nation's budget ``just to make a point on capital gains.''
   Bush met with about 10 Democratic senators to solicit advice on
how to get his proposal approved. Sen. James Exon, D-Neb., told
reporters later that he suggested delaying the matter until next
year.
   ``There's nothing critical about the economy right now that
requires that we have a capital gains (cut) right now,'' Exxon
said. ``We're going through a test of wills.'' He said that Senate
Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, has enough votes to block
consideration of a reduction now.
   The House approved a two-year cut in the tax rate on capital
gains _ increases in the value of stocks, bonds and real estate _
to 19.6 percent from the current maximum rate of 33 percent.

   A judge ordered Zsa Zsa Gabor to
spend 72 hours behind bars Tuesday for slapping a Beverly Hills
policeman during a traffic stop, telling her ``if you slap a cop,
you go to jail.''
   Municipal Judge Charles Rubin also ordered Miss Gabor to pay
$2,937.50 in fines and penalties and $10,000 restitution for
extraordinary costs to the city due to the case's notoriety. He
directed the former beauty queen from Hungary to perform 120 hours
of community service at a shelter for homeless women.
   The judge repeatedly admonished and rebuked the sullen,
sometimes smirking Miss Gabor, telling her she had shown contempt
for justice, police and the American people and that she had tried
to milk the case for publicity.
   ``The law applies to everyone, whether they are rich or poor and
whether they are famous or not,'' Rubin said before sentencing her.
``In the absence of extremely mitigating circumstances ... if you
slap a cop, you go to jail.''
   Rubin sentenced Miss Gabor to two concurrent 24-month jail
terms, but suspended them and ordered her to serve 96 hours in
jail, with credit for 24 hours served after her arrest June 14.
   Miss Gabor's sentence requires her to serve the 72-hour term by
Dec. 29, with no possibility of early release. Should she violate
any condition of the sentence, she will have to serve 18 months.
The judge said the sentence was common for such offenses.
   Defense attorney Harrison Bull said no decision had been made on
whether to appeal Miss Gabor's sentence or conviction.
   The actress was convicted Sept. 29 of battery on a police
officer, driving without a valid driver's license and having an
open container of alcohol in her car. She was acquitted of failing
to obey an officer.
   The tempestuous Miss Gabor slapped Officer Paul Kramer on June
14 after he stopped her Rolls-Royce convertible. The actress
testified that she instinctively struck out after Kramer roughed
her up. She said Kramer had overreacted and used undue force in
arresting her.
   During her trial, Miss Gabor's antics included rushing out of
the courtroom and telling reporters that justice was better under
the Nazis during World War II. Rubin said she engaged in a ``public
tantrum.''
   ``It's time for you to stop it,'' the judge said. ``It's time
for you to start acting like the lady you so repeatedly say you
are.''
   The judge still had to admonish Miss Gabor not to laugh during
sentencing.
   Noting with a cough that she was ``admittedly in her mid-60s ...
but otherwise vibrant and active,'' Rubin also said her age should
play no role in sparing her time behind bars.
   The star of such B-movies as ``Queen of Outer Space'' and
``Picture Mommy Dead'' is secretive about her age, but according to
court documents is 66.
   The judge told her to have her driver's license changed so it
reflects her correct age, prompting laughter in the courtroom.
   He also directed that she be interviewed once by a psychiatrist.
   Rubin ordered Miss Gabor not to discuss her case or give
interviews while doing her community service, and asked reporters
to stay away from her then.
   The judge said her action ``verbally slapped the faces of every
cop.
   ``She was not satisfied with that. She turned around and slapped
the face of every American by comparing justice in the United
States to Communist Russia and Nazi Germany,'' he said.
   In brief comments, outside court, Miss Gabor said, ``I'm a very
good American. I love America. Why should I slap the face of
America?''
   Her husband Frederick Von Anhalt, said, ``I'm very upset about
it. I'm upset because they are sending my wife to jail.''
   ``When she was first convicted, we felt that the Police
Department and Officer Kramer were vindicated,'' police spokesman
Lt. Robert Curtis said after Miss Gabor's sentencing. ``We
certainly feel that this is even further vindication.''
   Wearing a black dress, Miss Gabor arrived at court in a black
Mercedes Benz with her husband, passing before a crowd of about 100
reporters.
   She listened to character witnesses testify on her behalf with
her chin thrust up, and at one point sprayed herself with perfume.
   Bull asked Rubin to sentence Miss Gabor to probation. Deputy
District Attorney Elden Fox argued for tough punishment.
   ``How dare the defendant suggest that she was not tried by a
jury of her peers?,'' Fox said. ``How dare she suggest they do not
understand the class of people that she comes from?''

   A man driving home after an overseas
vacation rushed to help victims of a coach crash and discovered his
mother was the sole fatality, a relative said Tuesday.
   Simon Miles, 24, arrived minutes after a coach skidded on a
rain-slicked turn in the highway and overturned into a ditch Monday
near his east coast hometown of Skegness, said Irene Jacklin, his
grandmother.
   He had just driven 150 miles from London's Gatwick Airport after
a vacation in Malta. His 50-year-old mother, Marian, was returning
the same day from a vacation in Italy.
   Mrs. Jacklin said her grandson ran to the coach when he heard
cries for help and the first person he helped out of the wreckage
turned out to be his mother's friend, Jack Milburn.
   ``Then it came to him that his mum was in there,'' she said.
``He couldn't bring himself to go back inside. It was a terrible
shock for him when he realized she was dead.''
   Eight other people in the coach suffered minor injuries.

   A man accused of dousing his pregnant
daughter with a flammable liquid and setting her on fire was
sentenced Tuesday to five to 25 years in prison, despite that the
girl had asked the judge to be lenient.
   Kimberly Richmond, 17, gave birth to a healthy girl by Caesarian
section just hours after she suffered second- and third-degree
burns on more than two-thirds of her body in July.
   Summit County Common Pleas Judge Glen B. Morgan sentenced Joseph
Richmond, 41, to five to 25 years for aggravated arson, three to 15
years for felonious assault and one year for child endangering.
   The sentences will run concurrently, but Richmond must serve at
least five years, said Dave Lombardi, law clerk for the judge.
   Ms. Richmond, who spent two months in a hospital burn unit
before her release Sept. 21, appeared in court Tuesday and asked
the judge to sentence her father to probation instead of a prison
term.
   ``I think it was an accident,'' she told the judge. ``I don't
want him to go to prison.''
   Ms. Richmond wore a neck brace and gauze gloves, but said she
felt all right. She also said her baby was doing fine.
   She declined to talk to reporters after the sentencing.
   On Sept. 26, Richmond pleaded guilty to the charges in
connection with the July 24 incident, which police said occurred
during a family argument.
   Authorities said Richmond told them he only wanted to scare his
daughter and didn't want to hurt her.
   Police said they thought the flammable liquid was brake fluid.
   Richmond initially pleaded innocent by reason of insanity to the
felony charges, but Morgan reviewed a psychiatric report and ruled
he was mentally competent to stand trial.

<TEXT>
   The Justice Department claimed Tuesday in a $7
million lawsuit that the government was defrauded by a company that
had a contract to relocate federal employees in 24 states.
   The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Des Moines, charges
that Better Homes and Gardens Family Relocation Service, a
subsidiary of Meredith Relocation Corp., defrauded the General
Services Administration on performance of the one-year contract.
   The company, required to purchase employees' homes at an
appraised value, was accused of intimidating independent appraisers
so it could buy houses at a reduced price.
   The suit also charges that the company deliberately placed
federal employees in a ``distress-sale situation'' and destroyed
records to cover up improper practices.
   The lawsuit charges violations of the False Claims Act, breach
of contract, unjust enrichment and common-law fraud, the department
said.
   The lawsuit was the result of joint investigation by the
inspectors general of GSA and the Interior and Agriculture
departments.

<TEXT>
   Tight security will be in effect for
an 18-nation summit meeting because ``drug barons have put a price
on the heads of some presidents,'' presidential spokesman Jorge
Urbina said Tuesday.
   Urbina did not say if the government knew which presidents had
been threatened. Among the heads of state expected to attend the
conference Friday and Saturday are President Bush and Colombian
President Virgilio Barco, who are at the center of campaigns
against drug traffickers in their countries.
   Urbina said 4,000 policemen and security agents will be on duty
for the summit.
   Police were seen Tuesday stationed along the road from the
airport to San Jose and at strategic points in this city of 1
million.
   President Oscar Arias said Monday, ``We want to talk of
fraternity, dialogue, understanding'' at the meeting, which will
celebrate the 100th anniversary of Costa Rican democracy.
   He said he hoped the meeting would ``serve to eliminate fears
and encourage common undertakings that cannot wait any longer.''
   Arias won the 1987 Nobel Peace Prize for his drafting of a
Central American peace accord.
   Also expected for the summit are the heads of state of Canada,
Brazil, Argentina, Venezuela, Uruguay, Paraguay, Bolivia, Ecuador,
Nicaragua, El Salvador, Honduras, Suriname, Bahamas, Belize and
Jamaica and the governor of Puerto Rico.
   Leaders of Cuba, Chile, Haiti and Panama were not invited.
   Panamanian Foreign Minister Leonardo Kam issued a protest last
week saying ``the invitations were selective ... almost
discriminatory, which does not contribute to the ideals of
integration of Latin America and the Caribbean.''

   Promotors announced Tuesday the date of
a rematch between two fighters whose earlier bout ended when the
mother of one boxer jumped into the ring and pummeled his opponent
with a high-heel shoe.
   The promoters said light-heavyweights Tony Wilson and Steve
McCarthy would meet again Nov. 15 in Reading, about 45 miles west
of London.
   Their first bout, in the south coast town of Southampton, ended
in chaos last month.
   McCarthy had just floored Wilson in the third round when Minna
Wilson, the boxer's mother, stormed into the ring and started
hitting McCarthy over the head with her shoe.
   McCarthy required hospitalization for a head cut, and Wilson was
awarded the victory because his opponent left the fight. The
British Boxing Board of Control upheld the referee's decision but
said a rematch also was in order.
   The Wilson-McCarthy rematch will be on the undercard of the
British welterweight championship between Kirkland Laing and George
Collins.
   Wilson said he told his mother to stay away from his fights from
now on.

   The Senate on Tuesday approved treaties with
six other nations providing for mutual investigative assistance in
criminal cases.
   ``These new treaties are really the central tools in the fight
against drug trafficking and other serious transnational crimes,''
Sen. John F. Kerry, D-Mass., told the Senate before it ratified the
treaties, 99-0.
   He said the conviction in New York's ``pizza connection'' case
of 17 members of a drug ring stretching from Italy and the United
States was made possible by already existing ``mutual legal
assistance treaties.''
   The latest batch of treaties is the product of four years of
talks between the United States and the Cayman Islands, the
Bahamas, Belgium, Canada, Thailand and Mexico.
   Provisions call for cooperation in taking testimony or
statements of witnesses, producing documents, records and evidence,
executing searches and seizures, serving documents, assistance with
forfeiture of assets.
   Under the treaties, the attorney general could refuse to provide
such assistance and an ``understanding'' attached by the Senate
provided that no information about U.S. citizens would be furnished
to a foreign government if if would be seen by an official of that
country involved in drug trafficking.

<HEAD>Commuters Take to Public Transportation, But for How Long?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANTHONY MARQUEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Commuters in the San Francisco Bay area
took to public transportation in unprecedented numbers Tuesday, and
transit officials hope they make it a permanent habit.
   With so many of the 3 million commuters using public transit,
traffic along the freeways flowed smoothly, despite predictions of
gridlock.
   Gov. George Deukmejian met with executives of 150 Bay area
companies, urging them to encourage use of mass transit, car pools,
vans, ferries, flexible work hours and modified truck delivery
schedules.
   ``If stories begin to circulate that things are not as bad as
expected, then greater numbers of people might start getting back
in their cars rather than using mass transit or using ride
sharing,'' he said. ``We want to caution people not to do that.''
   Rod Diridon, chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation
Commission, a regional planning agency, and other transit officials
say the transportation problems facing Northern Californians are
not tied just to the Oct. 17 earthquake.
   For years, transit officials have tried to get Californians to
make more use of public transportation and ease the overloaded
highway system. But they were up against a virtual love affair
between residents and their vehicles.
   Then the major earthquake forced changes for commuters used to
driving to work, usually alone.
   ``They really need to make permanent adjustments,'' said
Diridon. ``We might as well bite the bullet.''
   Transit officials had feared massive traffic jams from the
closure of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge, but Tuesday they
found smooth sailing for ferryboats, highway traffic and trains.
   ``The commute went excellent, everything went fine,'' said Vicki
Wills, spokeswoman for the Bay Area Rapid Transit system, which
runs trains beneath the Bay. ``No delays. We rated our commute this
morning as excellent.''
   BART was expected to pick up many of the 65,000 people who
normally enter San Francisco over the Bay Bridge at rush hour in
cars or buses. By 9 a.m. Tuesday, BART had set a new weekday
ridership record with 99,135, 4,300 more than the previous day.
   Traffic along highways and other roads was operating ``very
smoothly,'' according to Highway Patrol spokesman Don Gappa. He
said the accident rate was no higher than normal.
   For commuters arriving on BART trains at San Francisco's Civic
Center stop, the morning trips were mostly routine, though a bit
more crowded than usual.
   ``The train went quickly. It's working well,'' said Bill
Edmonds, a new BART rider from Oakland. The regulatory analyst left
20 minutes later Tuesday, his second day on BART, and still made it
to work on time.
   ``It was almost normal _ I couldn't believe it,'' said longtime
BART rider Robert Lang, a supervisor for Housing and Urban
Development. ``There's a lot of new people and they seem to be
making the adjustment.''
   Lang also believes the quake may compel some people to begin
using public transit for good.
   ``There's usually a silver lining in a lot of things. It's not
surprising there will be a silver lining in this _ traffic and
other things,'' said Lang.
   In the South Bay, the number of commuters using van and car
pools was up 500 percent, according to the MTC's Diridon.
   But Red and White Fleet spokesman Dick Arnold said Tuesday that
less than half the available space on the fleet's 16 boats is being
used by commuters despite free or cheap parking and reduced fares
of $5 round-trip.
   The boats can handle more than 7,000 passengers, and the Tuesday
morning count was about 3,200, he said.
   ``We're puzzled why ore people aren't trying this,'' said
Arnold. ``One television station had a picture of someone on a boat
throwing up, and that didn't help much.''
   Arnold also said rough weather Monday ``spoooked people,'' but
he said the bay was calmer Tuesday.
   The MTC had predicted that 2 million of the 3 million weekday
commuters would encounter delays of some kind.
   Their fears were prompted by last wities,
will be closed for at least one month.
   In Oakland, a mile-plus section of Interstate 880, the Nimitz
Freeway, collapsed, killing dozens. Other closed freeways include
the Embarcadero Freeway along the waterfront in San Francisco and a
five-mile stetch of Interstate 280, also in the city.
   In Santa Cruz, only one lane of State Highway 17, a link to the
Silconn Valley, was open because of landslides and mudslides.

<TEXT>
   Supporters of legislation that would ease
restrictions on federally financed abortions for poor women
scheduled a House vote on Wednesday in an attempt to override
President Bush's veto, hoping a changing political climate could
give them a second surprise victory.
   Rep. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., who sponsored the successful
amendment, said, ``It's going to be very tough, but we're working
to win.''
   But opponents of the change, which would relax the prohibition
on Medicaid abortions for victims of rape and incest, said they
were confident they had the votes to upphold Bush's veto.
   A two-thirds vote of House members present is needed to override
the veto. If all 434 current members were present, 290 votes would
be needed to override the veto.
   The liberalized abortion language passed on a 216-206 vote two
weeks ago, and supporters acknowledged they had a long way to go to
override the president.
   ``We don't know how many votes we'll get tomorrow; we don't know
whether we'll get 217 or 270,'' said Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y.,
a supporter of expanded abortion availability. ``But ... we know
the pendulum is swinging in our direction.''
   The measure is part of a $156.7 billion appropriations bill for
education, labor and health programs.
   Bush said he was seeking ``room for flexibility'' on the issue
immediately after the House vote, but under pressure from
anti-abortion supporters he hardened his stand and vetoed the bill
on Saturday.
   ``The times are not changing,'' said Rep. Robert Dornan,
R-Calif., a leading abortion opponent. ``We will sustain his veto
tomorrow on the floor.''
   House Speaker Tom Foley, D-Wash., called Bush's veto
``mistaken'' and said the Democratic House leadership was seeking
votes to override the veto. But he said the vote ``is not a party
issue in the sense that we don't recognize that other members of
the party have a different position.''
   The newest House Democrat is Rep. Gene Taylor of Mississippi,
sworn in Tuesday after being elected in a special election last
week. Standing with Foley at a swearing-in ceremony, Taylor told
reporters he opposes ``any federal funding for abortion'' and would
vote to sustain Bush's veto.
   But another freshman Democrat reversed a lifelong anti-abortion
stance to announce he would vote to override the president.
   In what he described as ``the most difficult and agonizing
decision'' of his political career, Rep. Frank Pallone Jr. of New
Jersey said he remains opposed to abortion. but has come to believe
``sound public policy and the needs of American women are best
served if access to legal and medically safe abortion is
maintained.''
   Supporters of the liberalized abortion language said they were
urging colleagues to change their minds on the issue and were
urging constituents to contact their representative.
   A conservative Repubican, Rep. Arthur Ravenel Jr., R-S.C., said
he supported the broader abortion language and believed some
Republicans would shift to override the veto.
   ``I'm finding some movement in my Republican colleagues,''
Ravenel said. ``I think it's possible we just may override the
president's veto.''
   The abortion provision would reverse a law in effect since 1981
that bans all federally financed abortions for poor women under the
Medicaid program, except in cases where the life of the mother is
endangered by her pregnancy.
   Although the Senate had endorsed more relaxed abortion curbs,
the House had insisted on that language until its vote two weeks
ago to accept the more liberal Senate-passed version. That vote
came at a time when abortion-rights supporters said they were
enjoying new political success since a Supreme Court ruling last
summer gave the states more room to regulate abortions and brought
new attention to the issue.
   The National Right to Life Committee, the leading anti-abortion
organization, distributed copies of a letter sent to Bush in June
pleding to uphold any veto of more liberalized federal abortion
laws. It said 152 House members signed that letter.
   That number, if all voted, would be more than enough to sustain
a veto. On the group's list, however, were some members such as
Ravenel who have since voted the other way or who did not vote two
weeks ago.

<HEAD>First Injury Claims Filed With State</HEAD>

   The first of an expected long line of
damage claims against the state from the Oct. 17 earthquake were
filed Tuesday by two workers injured in the collapse of the Nimitz
Freeway bridge, their lawyer said.
   The claims were filed with the state Board of Control, whose
rejection would clear the way for a lawsuit. They contend the
California Department of Transportation had been aware for over a
decade that the double-deck Interstate 880 structure was defective
and dangerous in an earthquake.
   The lawyer, R. Lewis Van Blois, cited published reports of
``statements made by even CalTrans engineers and former engineers,
references to interoffice memos, and the 1982 task force study that
stated in essence that the elevated structure would receive
extensive damage in an earthquake.''
   ``Ever since the 1971 San Fernando quake and the problems that
occurred there, the entire engineering world has known'' about the
dangers, Van Blois said. He said he was also in the process of
having an independent study made.
   The workers, Milton Wade Jr. and Askia Y.M. Hurts of Hayward,
were returning from a plumbing job in Wade's car on the upper deck
of the Cypress structure on I-880 in Oakland when it collapsed, the
damage claim said. Authorities say the death toll in the collapse
could reach 48.
   Hurts suffered head, back and neck injuries, had two teeth
knocked out and four badly damaged, and got 43 stitches around the
mouth, the claim said. It said Wade suffered a concussion,
fractured ribs, neck and back problems, and injuries to his jaw and
right arm.
   ``My clients have medical problems, they don't have insurance,
they're out of work and they want to get this thing moving as
quickly as possible,'' Van Blois said. He said they are at home and
he didn't know when they would return to work.
   The Board of Control, which usually rejects such claims
routinely, has 14 days to act.

   The Bush administration said Tuesday it had
asked other countries to give Americans more opportunity to provide
the services that make up an increasing part of international trade.
   The U.S. delegation on Monday presented a 20-page draft
agreement in Geneva, Switzerland, to a meeting of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the first such draft presented in
complete form, said Trade Representative Carla A. Hills.
   Delegates from 107 countries are taking part in the
negotiations, which for the first time are trying to cover trade in
services _ everything from accounting to zoo management.
   The U.S. delegation presents proposals on Wednesday aimed at
abolishing export subsidies for farm products within 10 years.
   A source in Geneva said Indian Delegate V. J. Ganesan told the
closed-door meeting that an agreememnt must reflect the need of
Third World countries to protect their own service companies
against too much foreign competiton. He was supported by Brazil,
Yugoslavia and Tanzania, the source added.
   Ms. Hills told a news conference that under the U.S. proposal
the world market in services would be open to the greatest possible
extent to firms everywhere.
   ``They would face a fair, predictable environment for their
services throughout the world,'' said the official summary of the
proposal.
   She said it seeks to:
   _Enable firms from any country to set up shop in any other and
be treated like local firms
   _Limit governments' distortion of trade in services through
regulations, subsidies and their own monopolies
   _Require that national laws on services be administered openly.
   GATT, which is an organization as well as an agreement, has
always dealt with trade in actual goods and not in what were once
called ``invisibles.''
   ``The problem today is that trade has outgrown the GATT,'' Ms.
Hills said.
   ``Areas poorly govered by GATT rules, like agriculture, or not
covered at all, like services, investment and intellectual property
(itemsw such as copyrights), are of much greater importance than
they once were.''
   Now tourism, banking, insurance, airline services and computer
work can be among a country's most significant exports or imports.
   ``All told, more than $1 trillion in goods and services trade is
not adequately covered by international rules of fair play,'' Ms.
Hills complained.
   World trade in services last year totalled $560 billion. The
United States exported $90 billion worth of services last year and
imported only about $70 billion, making a $20 billion contribution
to the nation's balance of payments.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Activists from India asked members of Congress
Tuesday to help stop World Bank support of a gigantic dam project
they said threatens to displace thousands of people without
compensation and cause an environmental disaster.
   Rep. James Scheuer, D-N.Y., told a House natural resources
subcommittee the Narmada Valley project in three states of Western
India may be an example of development projects that ``undervalue
the costs associated with environmental degradation and human
displacement.''
   The United States is the largest contributor to the World Bank
and ``U.S. taxpayers' dollars helped finance the project,'' thus
Congress should check the accuracy of criticism that the Narmada
Dam was approved without proper environmental impact studies or
resettlement plans, he said.
   A Treasury representative said the United States supported the
project on the basis that those displaced would be compensated and
that ``human welfare objectives of the project are met.'' Specific
cost and contribution figures were not available.
   Continuing involvement by the World Bank might be more helpful
than a breakoff of support, however, in solving environmental and
human welfare issues that ``have turned out to be more complex''
than anticipated, said Treasury official Frank Vukmanic.
   ``The bank may be the only point of leverage to achieve needed
environmental reforms,'' he added. ``If the Bank backs away from
this project, there is the possibility that private sources of
funding may be available with no real prospect of resolving the
problem.''
   Scheuer said 60,000 of the dam's ``intended beneficiaries''
demonstrated against its construction in September in India.
   The project will turn 100,000 farmers into migrant laborers and
benefit mainly politicians, contractors and agricultural lobbies,
testified Medha Patkar, a sociologist representing the Save the
Narmada Action Committee. One hundred thirty-one cities north of
Bombay will receive 90 percent of the project's benefits, she said,
with only 10 percent of the benefit going to 4,720 villages.
   Indian economist Vijay Paranjpye said his own figures found
calculations and cost overruns so serious that India ``will not be
able to complete the project in 25 years.''

<TEXT>
   The government reported that
France exploded a 25-kiloton nuclear device Wednesday at its test
site on Mururoa Atoll. New Zealand condemned the action as an
affront to residents of the South Pacific.
   Government scientists said the blast was detected by New
Zealand's seismological station in Rarotonga, Cook Islands, at 5:30
a.m. local time.
   ``The countries of the South Pacific have made it abundantly
clear on innumerable occasions that they have had enough of nuclear
testing in the region,'' said Disarmament and Arms Control Minister
Fran Wilde.
   ``The continued testing of these devices in the Pacific is an
affront to all of us who live here,'' she said.
   Warwick Smith, head of the Seismological Observatory at the
Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, said it was 108th
test at Mururoa since France abandoned atmospheric testing there in
1975.
   It followed tests this year on May 11, May 20, June 3 and June
10 when the largest device, estimated to amount to 70 kilotons or
the equivalent of 70,000 tons of TNT, was exploded.
   Smith said Wednesday's blast probably meant that France was
beginning a new round of four tests for the remainder of this year.
   ``There was a series of four in May and June this year, and the
pattern over the past five years has been two series of four each
year,'' he said.
   Earlier this year the French government said it would reduce the
number of annual tests from eight to six.

   A woman died of a head wound Tuesday following
delivery of her baby, hours after she and her husband were
abducted, robbed and shot by someone who apparently thought they
were police.
   The suburban couple, drawn to Boston for its medical facilities,
had recently said they were concerned about the rise in violence in
the city, friends said.
   Police had no immediate suspects in the shooting.
   Carol and Charles Stuart were located by the sound of police
sirens coming through the cellular telephone Stuart used to call
for help before he passed out.
   Mrs. Stuart, a 33-year-old lawyer, died early Tuesday at Brigham
and Women's Hospital. Just six hours earlier she and her husband
had left that same hospital after attending their birthing class.
The couple lived in Reading, 13 miles north of the city.
   The baby boy _ his parents had planned to call him Christopher,
a friend said _ was delivered one month premature by Caesarean
section, hospital spokeswoman Louise Homer said. The hospital would
not disclose the infant's condition.
   After leaving the hospital at about 8 p.m. Monday, the Stuarts
were accosted by a man in the parking lot who got into their car
and forced them to drive to an inner city neighborhood. There they
were robbed of their watches and other belongings and shot.
   The gunman apparently thought the Stuarts were police officers
because of the celluar phone in their car, said police Deputy
Superintendent Joseph Dunford. Before shooting the Stuarts,
according to Dunford, the gunman said: ``I think you're five-o,''
slang for police.
   Stuart, 29, general manager of a fur store in Boston's Back Bay,
was in critical condition Tuesday at Boston City Hospital with a
gunshot wound in the abdomen.
   State Police dispatcher Gary McLaughlin got a few details from
Stuart during the 10-minute call before he blacked out.
   ``My wife's been shot, I've been shot,'' Stuart said, according
to an edited transcript of the call, which was punctuated by his
groans.
   Stuart didn't know where he was, and acting on McLaughlin's
instructions, drove to an intersection where he could see a street
sign. He passed out before he could give the dispatcher an
intersection.
   Officers in patrol cars were told to flick their sirens on and
off, one by one. The dispatcher was able to tell which police car
was near the Stuarts' car from the sound of the sirens coming
through the car phone.
   ``Get my wife out,'' Stuart told the police officers who found
him.
   The ambulance crew that came to the aid of Stuart and his wife
had been riding with a camera crew from the CBS series ``Rescue
911,'' which tells real-life stories about rescue operations.
   The crew videotaped Stuart regaining consciousness and talking
about the attack as paramedics worked on him en route to Boston
City Hospital, and was allowed into the emergency room, CBS
spokesman Mike Silver said in New York.
   Mayor Raymond Flynn told police Commissioner Frances Roache
``he'd like to get every available detective'' on the case,''
police spokeswoman Jill Reilly said.
   At a press conference Tuesday, Flynn was asked why this slaying
was getting so much attention when shootings occur almost daily in
other distressed areas of the city.
   ``There will be the same aggressive and fair and consistent
enforcement of all our laws, regardless of where it takes place,''
he said.
   Brigham and Women's is one of a number of hospitals clustered
around Harvard Medical School.
   Its setting is deceptive. The hospital complex is a stone's
throw from Brookline, the affluent suburb where Gov. Michael
Dukakis lives, but it also is adjacent to Boston's crime-ridden
Roxbury section and dark woods.
   Gang wars, drive-by shootings and drug-related violence are on
the rise, perplexing and alarming residents and prompting police to
conduct controversial on-the-spot searches.
   Ted Kakas, an owner of the fur store where Stuart has worked for
eight years, said the Stuarts' child was their first. They had just
celebrated their fourth wedding anniversary, he said.
   ``So many senseless things going on,'' said Peter Jaworski, 24,
a close friend of Stuart and assistant manager at the fur store.
``Last night the police commissioner told us you just have to keep
fighting.''

   A blast apparently caused by a
bomb wrecked the car of a Spanish official but injured no one,
Dutch police said early Wednesday.
   The car destroyed in the blast late Tuesday belonged to the
Spanish consul general in Rotterdam, authorities said. Fifteen
homes in the neighborhood also were damaged, local police spokesman
Nico Laterveer said.
   At the time, the official, whose name was not immediately
available, was at his home in The Hague, 18 miles from Rotterdam,
said Laterveer.
   No one claimed responsibility for the attack.
   ``We haven't the faintest clue'' who might be behind the attack,
the police spokesman said.
   In Spain, police and military officials have often been targeted
for bomb attacks by the Basque separatist group ETA.

<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Council said Tuesday that
Colombia will continue to extradite drug traffickers sought in the
United States and will not negotiate with the cocaine cartels.
   It said a decree issued Aug. 19 by President Virgilio Barco
allowing extradition to the United States ``has been applied and
will continue to be applied.'' Barco issued the decree after
assassins shot to death a leading presidential candidate.
   Meanwhile, the bodyguard of a manager for the anti-drug
crusading newspaper El Espectador was fatally shot Tuesday in
western Medellin. Police said the victim, Pedro Luis Osorio, was a
member of the Medellin police force.
   Police said Osorio was walking to meet a female friend for lunch
when two men approached him on a motorcycle and opened fire, a
Medellin police spokesman said in a telephone interview. After
killing the bodyguard, police said the assassins chased down and
murdered his friend, Maria Ortega, five blocks away.
   ``It seems the murders were a result of a personal dispute,''
the spokesman said. ``Drug traffickers had nothing to do with
them.''
   She said the assassins fled and that police had made no arrests
in connection with the killings.
   The bodyguard had been assigned to protect Luis Bejarano, who
replaced one of the two El Espectador managers killed by hired
hitmen in Medellin on Oct. 10.
   Hours after the assassinations, a man claiming to represent drug
traffickers said in an anonymous phone call that the remaining 11
El Espectador workers in Medellin would be killed if the paper did
not close the bureau in that city, which is the hub of the most
powerful Colombian cocaine cartel.
   El Tiempo, a Bogota newspaper, published a message from the drug
dealers Tuesday saying they had interpreted a Supreme Court ruling
as declaring a Colombia-U.S. extratiditon treaty does exist but was
not signed correctly.
   That brought immediate speculation in the local news media that
the court had struck down possible extraditions.
   The State Council said that in applying the presidential decree
on extradition it will remain within the constitutional bounds set
by the Supreme Court in its latest ruling.
   The council is composed of the president, the chief of police
intelligence, the attorney general and the ministers of defense,
interior and justice.
   Referring to the drug traffickers' message in El Tiempo the
council said, ``Organized crime is continuing its misinformation
campaign.''
   In rejecting negotiations with the drug cartels the council said:
   ``The government has undertaken a policy of combating drug
trafficking and its criminal organizations, and nowhere in this
campaign is there room for either a dialogue or negotiations with
traffickers.
   ``No proposal by either drug traffickers or their
representatives will be accepted.''
   The traffickers' message in El Tiempo repeated previous
proposals. It asked for talks with the government to end
extraditions if the drug dealers agreed to abandon all illicit
trafficking activities in Colombia.
   There was a delay in the release of a Supreme Court ruling Oct.
5 and the court released only some parts of its decision.
   Some lawyers argued the ruling struck down extraditions.
   A court comment released after the ruling said there were two
permissible ways for Colombians to be extradited to other
countries: One is through an extradition treaty and when no treaty
exists the president may use decree powers to permit extradition.
   The question of whether a Colombian-U.S treaty exists was left
to the government to decide.
   The Barco government, apparently deciding there is no treaty,
has extradited four people to the United States under the
presidential decree. Three were extradited after the Oct. 5 court
ruling.
   A 1979 extradition treaty was nullified by the Supreme Court in
two different rulings because it was not signed by then-President
Julio Cesar Turbay. The treaty had been signed by the acting
president while Turbay was out of the country.

   The mayor announced an internal
investigation Tuesday into how the Police Department let a
confessed murderer and mob informant buy drugs, carry guns and
collect welfare while in its custody as a protected witness.
   It will be at least the third investigation into the custody and
death of admitted three-time murderer Peter Gilbert, who died of a
heart attack in June 1988 while on his way to an unsupervised
skydiving trip in Connecticut.
   Packages containing 9 grams of cocaine were found in Gilbert's
parachute bag. Later investigations showed that while in police
custody, Gilbert was paid at least $98,000, took trips, charged
meals and liquor to the state and bought bullets and jewelry at
taxpayers' expense.
   Mayor Joseph R. Paolino Jr., who maintains he didn't know
Gilbert was in department custody, said his action was prompted by
``outrageous revelations'' of recent weeks, including reports that
a police officer was videotaped joking with Gilbert about the free
ride they were getting.
   Paolino appointed Family Court Judge Susan McGuirl to conduct
the review.
   U.S. Attorney Lincoln C. Almond, who has turned down repeated
requests for grand jury inquiry, saying the matter lacks federal
jurisdiction, recused his office from further involvement last week
after learning a woman who is now a secretary in his office had
traveled to Florida with a police officer who was supervising
Gilbert on one of his seven trips there.
   The Providence Journal-Bulletin reported Saturday that Gilbert's
wife had a videotape of a police officer joking with her husband
about the free ride they were getting.
   Gilbert's wife, Debra, told the newspaper the tape shows
Detective Steven Cross with his arm around her husband's shoulders
saying, ``The criminal justice system has been good to us, Peter,
huh?''
   Gilbert responded by hoisting a soda in a toast and thanking
former Attorney General Arlene Violet.
   WPRI-TV on Tuesday night broadcast videotapes of Gilbert and
police officers cavorting at a Florida motel swimming pool. The
station said the officers were supposed to have been guarding him.
   The tape showed the encounter with Cross. Gilbert also
videotaped a police officer sleeping in a poolside lounge chair
while he was supposed to be guarding the witness, the station said.
   ``Hard time, tough duty,'' Gilbert said on the tape as he
laughed, WPRI-TV said. The station said Cross claimed he was ``play
acting'' to make Gilbert feel at ease.
   Mrs. Gilbert told the station she gave her husband a gun while
he was in police custody and that she had one as well. As a
convicted felon, Gilbert could not legally carry a firearm.
   Cross was recently transferred from the detective division to
the auto squad, which investigates stolen cars, said Police Officer
Bob Lauro.
   Police Chief Walter Clark has previously declined comment on the
transfer or the tape and didn't return calls Tuesday. Violet was
not at her law office Tuesday and did not return phone calls.
   The U.S. attorney's office recommended an investigation last
week.
   Paolino denied any political motivation in requesting the city
review.
   Paolino, a Democrat, is expected next year to challenge
Repubican Gov. Edward D. DiPrete, who announced a state police
investigation of the Gilbert case last week.
   Paolino said McGuirl's review would be different from the state
police investigation because it would look into ``appropriate
disciplinary actions and administrative changes,'' while the state
police investigation is looking into possible criminal actions.
   ``I'm just looking internally as to what happened in the past
and, more fundamentally, at the department as a whole,'' said
McGuirl, who will not have subpoena power.
   An eight-month investigation by Attorney General James E. O'Neil
and Providence police said police failed to properly supervise
Gilbert but recommended no disciplinary action.
   Former police chief Col. Anthony J. Mancuso, in charge when
Gilbert's protective custody was arranged, resigned as head of the
attorney general's drug force Monday, saying he did not want to be
``a political pawn.''
   Paolino said he would await McGuirl's report before taking any
disciplinary action.
   ``Let the chips fall where they may,'' he said.
   Police Chief Walter Clark, and Cmdr. Richard Tamburini, who was
in charge of Gilbert's supervision, did not immediately return
phone calls Tuesday.
   Two of the officers in the security detail have committed
suicide.
   Gilbert, 43, was a key witness in two trials and was expected to
testify against alleged organized crime figures. In the 30 months
he was in police custody, Gilbert was kept at a police station
apartment, then transferred in January 1988 to a safe house, while
serving a 10-year sentence for murder.
   Paolino, who took office in April 1984, said that ``if the name
Peter Gilbert was ever mentioned in my presence it was made with a
host of other issues and the name would have been meaningless to
me.''

   Safety drills were a weekly occurrence at
the Phillips Petroleum Co. plastics plant, but when an emergency
siren sounded before a series of devastating explosions, hundreds
of employees just ran.
   In all, 124 were injured, 35 hospitalized and at least two died
in the blasts at the plant Monday. Twenty-two other workers were
missing and presumed dead on Tuesday.
   Maintenance worker Roby Clemons said that employees had 20
seconds to escape after a warning message was broadcast over the
plant's emergency radio.
   Workers said they heard a hissing sound and saw a white cloud.
The explosion that followed knocked them off their feet.
   ``Each area has an evacuation area, but in some cases you just
run. We just ran. There's nothing you can do but run,'' said Lonnie
Ogden, a plant worker for 14 years.
   The explosion sent pieces of metal and concrete flying through
the air, he said.
   ``I dove underneath a front-end loader until I didn't see
anything else coming down. It was bad. I heard a big hiss, then I
seen a cloud. I knew something was wrong. Something like that
happens so quick. You can't do anything about it. ''
   The plant tested its emergency alarm system every Monday,
officials said. The alarms had been tested in the morning before
Monday's blast and there were no problems, said Greg Derrick, a
Phillips spokesman in Bartlesville, Okla.
   Alex Diaz, a general maintenance employee, said the plant had an
evacuation plan, but the volume of Monday's accident rendered it
obsolete.
   ``Just the size of it ... you just have to get out of there.''
   Phillips spokesman Jere Smith said he did not know when the last
evacuation plan was practiced.
   According to Elizabeth Gonzalez, a deputy coordinator of the
Pasadena Emergency Management Office, the Phillips plant was the
scheduled site for an annual emergency drill scheduled for Nov. 8.
   ``It's an annual drill, and we were working on some of the areas
we identified as deficiencies in our 1988 drill ... elements of
triage and communications,'' she said.
   ``We take safety very seriously. I can't explain at this time
what happened down there,'' said Bill Stoltz, Phillips
environmental director. ``We're awaiting getting in there to make a
full assessment on that.''
   Crews of nearby chemical plants as well as fire departments from
Houston, Pasadena, Deer Park, and LaPorte responded to Monday's
accident. They were among various firefighting crews from 96
factories and six cities in the area that formed a collective
emergency response plan in 1955, in the wake of major accidents and
fires along the Houston Ship Channel.
   One such accident was a 1947 explosion in which a freighter
carrying fertilizer blew up at a Texas City dock, killing 512
people and injuring 4,000.

   Only nine people remained unaccounted for
Tuesday _ one week after Northern California's ravaging earthquake
_ and geologists predicted a 50-50 chance by Christmas of a major
aftershock capable of causing considerable damage.
   The U.S. Geological Survey on Tuesday also revised upward the
magnitude of the Oct. 17 quake, from 6.9 to 7.1 on the Richter
scale.
   Church bells tolled at 5:04 p.m., one week to the minute after
the quake. And 83 minutes later, at 6:27 p.m., the strongest
aftershock in four days, with a Richter scale reading of 4.5,
rattled the area. There were no immediate reports of damage.
   A $2.85 billion quake aid bill passed the U.S. House.
   Survivor Buck Helm's condition improved to serious with his
kidney function reported normal.
   Demolition crews were taking down sections of Interstate 880 in
Oakland for fear still-standing sections of the elevated,
double-deck structure could tumble like dominoes onto the 1\-mile
stretch that collapsed in the Oct. 17 quake.
   The death toll rose to 63 with a coroner's discovery of a 39th
victim among the remains dug out of the rubble of I-880, which was
thefirst elevated freeway built in California.
   But authorities have been able to account for all but nine of
the 280 reported missing during the last week, California Highway
Patrol Lt. Kris Wraa said.
   ``I'm not willing to speculate how many of those nine missing
people may or may not be up there,'' Wraa said, referring to the
collapsed freeway.
   Rescue crews have not been able to locate other bodies in the
rubble, where 55 cars were trapped at rush-hour _ a number
considered well below a normal Tuesday, possibly because of the
scheduled third game of the World Series between the Bay area's two
major league baseball teams.
   A traffic officer reported he was ``surprised at how light
traffic was'' five minutes before the quake, California Highway
Patrol spokesman Thomas A. Noble said.
   Four sections remain inaccessible to searchers. Digging was to
resume when the threatening sections were taken down, possibly by
Thursday. There was no hope of finding anyone alive, authorities
said.
   ``The people that are (unaccounted for), I believe are
responsible people. Many of their cars have been found on that
interchange and for whatever reason their loved ones have not had
contact with them,'' Oakland Police Sgt. Greg Hughes said.
   ``We've sent officers out to check their homes, check their
jobs, and every four hours we're talking to the families,'' he said.
   Seismologists at the geological survey said they revised the
quake's Richter reading to 7.1 after checking data from 18 seismic
stations around the world.
   ``The original magnitude of 6.9 was based on more localized
seismic readings,'' said Waverly Person, director of the USGS
National Earthquake Information Service in Golden, Colo., in a
statement.
   The USGS issued a long-range aftershock forecast predicting over
the next two months an 11 percent chance of a temblor of magnitude
6.0 or larger, and a 50 percent chance of one registering 5.0 or
larger.
   On the Richter scale of earthquake magnitude, 5.0 is considered
capable of considerable damage, and 6.0 capable of severe damage.
State emergency coordinators have said that an aftershock of 5.0
could be especially troublesome to buildings already damaged or
weakened by the initial earthquake.
   The probabilities were based on statistics for California
earthquakes, and not on actual measurements at the San Andreas
Fault, USGS geophysicist Jim Luetgert said.
   More than 3,500 aftershocks, some almost imperceptible, had been
detected by Tuesday morning, the USGS said.
   The strong aftershock Tuesday evening was centered 14 miles
northeast of Santa Cruz, the USGS said. The aftershock was the
largest since the 4.6 aftershock that occurred about 9:15 p.m.
Saturday, said Pat Jorgenson of the USGS.
   ``It felt pretty sharp and fairly long, but I guess it lasted
only seven to 10 seconds,'' said Santa Cruz police dispatcher Chuck
Minuti. ``We had a few phone calls right away but no reports of
damage.''
   Engineers reported Tuesday that the toppled 50-foot section of
the Bay Bridge was unrepairable. Officials for the transportation
department said they hope to put up a new five-lane section on the
lifeline across San Francisco Bay by Nov. 16.
   Commuters, left without the bridge and several stretches of
freeway, fared well again Tuesday, using public transit in record
numbers, transportation officials said.
   Gov. George Deukmejian, speaking to business leaders, praised
efforts to reduce traffic and warned against lapsing into regular
cummuting patterns. ``We've got some longterm concerns here,'' he
said.
   In Washington, the House voted 321-99 to send $2.85 billion in
earthquake-relief funds to Northern California. The Senate was
expected to concur Wednesday and send the legislation to President
Bush.
   In a floor speech before the vote, Rep. Nancy Pelosi, who
represents San Francisco's Marina district, pleaded for ``a chance
to rebuild.''
   She said, ``We were hit by 10 times the amount of explosive
power of World War II, including the atomic bomb.''
   San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos called on the federal government
to raise the maximum home rebuilding loan to $500,000 from
$100,000, reflecting high housing costs in the region.
   ``One-hundred thousand dollars in South Carolina can make a big
difference. It doesn't here,'' Agnos said.
   In San Francisco alone, 750 to 1,000 buildings need extensive
repair, Agnos told the city-county Board of Supervisors on Monday.
He estimated damage in the city at $2.2 billion to $3.2 billion.
   Clyde Walthall, spokesman for Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, said the
utility estimates they'll need to replace about 10 miles of gas
distribution lines in the hard-hit Marina district, at an estimated
cost of $10 million.
   He did not know how long that work would take, and said the
utility was awaiting clearance from the city before beginning the
work.
   About 5,100 customers are without gas service in the district,
and that about 1,000 customers are also without electric service,
Walthall said.
   Fire officials reported five homes were evacuated on Monday and
Tuesday when heavy rains caused landslides in the Santa Cruz
mountain communities of Zayante and Boulder Creek. No injuries were
reported.
   Since the quake, as many as 90 homeowners around Zayante made
the ``common sense decision'' to leave their uninhabitable homes
without being ordered to evacuate, said Ken Boynton, district fire
chief. Some of the houses slid and leaned against trees, while
others were reduced to rubble.
   Already, damage from the quake _ estimated at more than $7
billion _ has surpassed Hurricane Hugo as the costliest disaster in
U.S. history.
   Deukmejian said he would call a special legislative session
within two weeks to work out the state's response to the
devastation.
   Documents on file at the state transportation department in
Sacramento show that I-880, opened in July 1957 at a construction
cost of $10.2 million, was the first elevated freeway in California.
   A nearly identical roadway built soon after, the Embarcadero in
San Francisco, probably will be closed until June due to earthquake
damage. Unlike its near-twin in Oakland, this structure will be
repaired rather than replaced.
   Along the Pacific coastline near San Francisco, rocks continued
to fall of cliffs damaged by the earthquake, making the beaches
below unsafe, the USGS said.
   ``There are many cracks along the tops of coastal bluffs, and
some of these could collapse without warning,'' the agency said.
   About a half-dozen wineries in the Santa Cruz region reported a
jumble of 500-pound wine barrels that rolled off madly leaping
racks stacked to the ceiling. Some lost precious bottles from their
wine ``library,'' the collection all wineries have of every vintage
produced.

   Police reported Wednesday that two
rifle bullets were found in the Putra World Trade Center where the
49-nation Commonwealth held its annual summit.
   The bullets for a U.S.-made M-16 rifle were found by a constable
Oct. 12, days before the summit opened its first session on Oct.
18, according to Police Inspector General Haniff Omar. The summit
ended Tuesday.
   Haniff also said that on Oct. 11 a telephone call, purportedly
from the Irish Republican Army, was received at national police
headuarters and the caller threatened to kill British leaders
attending the summit.
   Haniff, Malaysia's highest ranking police officer, said
information about the ammunition and telephone call were withheld
to facilitate investigations.
   He said precautionary measures were taken but police found no
explosives or additional ammunition and no arrests have been made.
   Queen Elizabeth II arrived on the royal yacht Brittania for a
state visit to Malaysia Oct. 14-18 and British Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher attended the summit, which ended without incident
Tuesday.
   Haniff said a note written in Malay was found with the two
bullets that read ``Chogm merbahaya, Hisbollah Malaysia,'' which
means ``Danger, Hisbollah Malaysia.''
   It was not known if the name Hisbollah was meant to be
Hezbollah, a pro-Iranian, Shiite Moslem organization in Lebanon
that is believed to be an umbrella group for extremist groups
holding 18 foreign hostages, including eight Americans, in Lebanon.
   Police said they did not know of any Hisbollah or Hezbollah
group in Malaysia.
   The IRA, outlawed in both Britain and Ireland, is a
predominantly Roman Catholic organization that is waging a violent
guerrilla campaign to unite Northern Ireland with the Catholic
Republic of Ireland. Protestants outnumber Catholics 3-2 in
Northern Ireland, a British province.

<HEAD>International Bank Says It is Preparing Loans to China</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The president of the Asian Development Bank was
quoted Tuesday as saying the fund is preparing new loans for China,
which lost its access to low-interest Western cash after its
crackdown on pro-democracy protesters.
   The official Xinhua News Agency quoted Bank President Masao
Fujioka as telling Premier Li Peng that the bank and China should
cooperate.
   ``The Asian Development Bank is making active preparations for
some loan projects with China, and these will soon be handed over
to the ... board of directors for discussion,'' Xinhua paraphrased
Fujioka as saying. No details of the loans were given.
   China has lost other sources of low-interest loans since June,
when the Chinese army cracked down on pro-democracy demonstrators.
Several Western governments froze new development loans to China in
protest, and the United States and other countries pressured the
World Bank to freeze its loans.
   Although World Bank President Barber Conable has said he expects
to see the bank resume new loans soon, bank members delayed voting
on the matter at a September meeting.
   Many private foreign bankers are hesitating to make new loans
because of China's economic problems and its decision to slow
industrial growth.
   However, there have several signs that the financial freeze is
ending.
   Japan has said it will begin gradually resuming aid projects
that it froze in June. In addition, West Germany recently decided
to go ahead with a $239 million low-interest loan to China that
will help build a subway in Shanghai.
   Fujioka and more than 30 foreign bankers were in Beijing to
attend a conference on policies for poor countries.

<HEAD>Inquest Reports High Methane Levels at Kentucky Mine Before Blast</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MADISONVILLE, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Workers detected high levels of methane
at the William Station Mine four days before an explosion there
killed 10 men, a state inspector testified Tuesday.
   The air was 6 percent methane in one section of the mine when
tested Sept. 9, but the high level of gas alone does not explain
the blast, said Billy Smith, an inspector for the Kentucky
Department of Mines and Minerals.
   ``You had a 6 percent level on Saturday before the explosion,''
Smith said. ``That is an explosive level and it didn't explode.
You've got to have an ignition source.''
   Workers adjusted fireproof curtains to allow more air into the
mine, assigned a miner to monitor the methane level while they
worked, and warned incoming crews of the high gas levels before the
blast, Smith said at a state hearing on the Sept. 13 explosion, the
worst U.S. mining disaster since 1984.
   Methane is considered explosive in levels of from 5 percent to
15 percent.
   Four of the bodies were found in the area where miners had
detected the high methane levels, Smith said.
   Workers in the section of the mine where the blast occurred were
dismantling a longwall mining machine. Mining in that area had been
completed Sept. 6.
   Ron Siler, president of Pyro Mining Co., the mine owner, said
officials did not learn until after the explosion of the high
methane reading.
   ``At the time of the explosion, we were depending on the men in
the area to take their own measurements,'' Siler said during
questioning from Charles Moore, an attorney representing miners'
widows.
   Testimony indicated investigators are considering several
possible causes for the accumulation of methane, including water
that blocked the mine's primary ventilation system and a regulator,
or curtain, that no longer was being used to allow air to flow
through the mine.
   What ignited the blast has not been established. Among the
sources under investigation were electrical equipment, acetylene
torches believed to have been in use before the explosion, and rock
falls that might have sparked wire rope cables.
   Under questioning from an attorney for the Department of Mines
and Minerals, mine superintendent Michael McDowell said workers
were randomly searched before going into the mine and terminated if
found to be carrying cigarettes.
   David Steele, general superintendent at William Station,
testified a cigarette butt had been found found in the area of the
explosion. But Willard Stanley, commissioner for the Kentucky mines
department, said the cigarette was not found near the bodies and he
did not believe it sparked the blast.
   There were 330 workers underground at the time of the explosion,
Siler said.

   Friends and relatives of workers who were
in a plastics plant when it blew up waited and clung to shreds of
hope Tuesday as the search for victims continued.
   ``My best friend is in there, I think,'' said Albert Gonzalez,
27. ``He hasn't called his mother and sister, and he didn't come
home last night.''
   The explosions Monday at Phillips Petroleum Co.'s No. 5 plant
left at least two people dead, 22 workers missing and presumed dead
and 124 people injured.
   On Tuesday, people gathered in small groups at Phillips
Employees Credit Union, which sits across Texas Highway 225 from
the blackened rubble of the plant. They talked quietly, trying to
learn who was still among the missing.
   Mary De La Vergne, 38, found the name of her husband, Cipriana
Rodriguez, 43, who had been working in the building that exploded.
   ``I had just taken him lunch,'' said Ms. De La Vergne. ``I heard
the explosion when I was going back home.''
   She recalled that a much smaller explosion several months ago
was followed by a call from Rodriguez to tell her he was OK.
   ``He called me right away then, so when I didn't hear from him
this time, I knew something was wrong,'' Ms. De La Vergne said.
   At 10:30 p.m. Monday, her husband's supervisor and another
Phillips official came to her house to tell her that her husband
was missing.
   ``I can only keep on hoping,'' she said Tuesday, collapsing in
tears onto the steering wheel of her pickup.
   Gonzalez, who works in the plant's distribution department,
leaned against a highway overpass buttress, his sunglasses masking
reddened eyes. He has been calling his friend's relatives
regularly, but hope has dwindled.
   ``They're sitting by the phone and it won't even go for a full
ring before they pick it up. They say, `Mark?' and I say, `No, it's
just me.'''
   Ray Rodriguez, 50, of La Porte, came so he could retrieve his
truck, which is still parked inside the plant. His ears were still
ringing from the blast, which knocked him to the ground from about
100 yards away.
   Rodriguez shook his head as he thought about how close he had
come to death.
   ``We ran for our lives,'' he said. ``Some people wanted to stop
and I just told them to keep on going, because you can't tell
what's going to happen next. And there were more explosions.''

   Amerindian insurgents angry about a
government peace accord with rival Bush Negro rebels hijacked a
ferryboat Tuesday, witnesses said.
   No hostages were taken, but the hijacking on the Saramacca River
temporarily cut off this capital from the rice-producing Nickerie
district. Rice is a leading earner of hard currency in this country
on the eastern shoulder of South America.
   Witnesses said the hijackers were Tucayana Indians, who have
been agitating against the government since it signed a July peace
agreement with rebels of the Jungle Commando group, who are mostly
Bush Negroes.
   On Aug. 31, the Tucayana hijacked a ferry at the same place. The
boat seized Tuesday replaced the one captured in August.
   Like the army, the Tucayana oppose the peace accord because it
calls for the 200 to 400 Jungle Commando fighters to become a
special police unit in the interior, where most of the Amerindians
live.
   The Amerindians, allied to the army during the three-year
guerrilla war, fear retribution if they fall under the control of
the Bush Negroes.
   The 65,000 Bush Negroes, who are descendants of escaped African
slaves, and 10,000 Amerindians are traditional rivals. They compete
for land for farming, hunting and fishing.

   Immigration authorities said Tuesday they found 658
more Chinese among Vietnamese boat people, bringing the number of
Chinese trying to enter Japan by posing as Vietnamese refugees this
year to 1,642.
   Japan plans to send the Chinese back home and is negotiating
with the Chinese government, a Justice Ministry official said.
   They were among 3,372 boat people supposedly from Vietnam who
arrived in Japan this year, compared with 219 for all of 1988, said
the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The 658 Chinese, who have been in the International Refugee
Assistance Center since arrival, were sent to immigration
facilities Tuesday pending deportation to China, the official said.
   Immigration officials escorted some of the male Chinese in
handcuffs to prevent possible disorder, Kyodo News Service reported.
   In September, violence flared between Chinese and Vietnamese
refugees at the center when 19 Vietnamese living in Japan broke in
and reportedly beat Chinese with pieces of wood.
   On Sept. 13, Japan began a policy of screening boat people and
accepting only those deemed to be fleeing political persecution and
refusing those who come seeking economic betterment.

   Egon Krenz warned East Germans on Tuesday to stop
street demonstrations, but up to 12,000 marched in East Berlin
after dark to protest his election as president. Police directed
traffic out of their way.
   The ritual election by the customarily docile parliament was
made dramatic when some members voted ``no'' for the first time.
   In a speech afterward, Krenz said continuing weeks of
pro-democracy protest could cause a ``worsening of the situation,
or confrontation.''
   At nightfall, lines of East Berliners carrying candles marched
through the central district, chanting ``Egon, who sked us?'' _ a
recurring phrase since Krenz became Communist Party chief last week
_ and ``We are the competition!''
   Police did not interfere, and kept the route clear of traffic.
   ADN, the official news agency, reported the protest without
criticism. ``Several thousand people, mostly youths'' carried
banners and chanted slogans denouncing the election and ``demanding
changes in the election laws, more democracy and an open press,''
it said.
   It estimated the number of marchers in the two-hour protest as
``as high as 12,000 at times.''
   On Monday in Leipzig, more than 300,000 people marched in the
largest protest of the nation's 40-year history.
   After his election, Krenz reaffirmed East Germany's allegiance
to Communist orthodoxy, despite the reform sweeping through the
Soviet bloc. He also promised to investigate charges of police
brutality against pro-democracy demonstrators earlier this month.
   The new leader, who succeeded Erich Honecker as Communist party
chief and president, was in charge of police at the time.
   Officials admitted for the first time Tuesday that police
attacked peaceful protesters. In a report carried by the official
news agency, the government said: ``There were instances where
security officials exceeded their authority and illegal acts were
committed against some of those detained.''
   ADN said officials decided police should use restraint ``unless
there is violence or the threat of violence,'' and had prohibited
the use of firearms.
   It said police commanders had apologized to victims of
verifiable brutality. ADN said 83 complaints were under review and
prosecutors had taken up four cases, according to the report
prepared by the parliament committees on national defense and
justice affairs.
   Krenz said in his speech, ``Proper steps will be taken if the
evidence warrants them. Anyone who was treated unjustly has the
right to take advantage of their legal rights.''
   Twenty-six members of the 500-seat People's Chamber voted
against Krenz for president, although he was the only candidate,
and 26 abstained, ADN reported.
   It was the first time members of the Communist-controlled
chamber had voted against the sole candidate for president.
   After his election, the 52-year-old leader declared to the
legislators:
   ``Demonstrations, however peacefully they may be planned and
thought out, carry within themselves the danger of ending in a
different way from how they started.
   ``That is unsettling to many people, and rightly so. Our
society, which has so many new things to tackle, is thus put under
increasing tension.''
   In Bonn, West Germany, Chancellor Helmut Kohl said Tuesday he
was prepared to meet with East Germany's new leader to advance
inter-German relations.
   ``If it is seen as useful by both sides ... from my side there
are no difficulties in the way of a well-prepared meeting taking
place,'' Kohl told reporters in Bonn.
   East Berlin's official news agency swiftly reported the summit
offer.
   Krenz and his colleagues have said they will exclude the growing
opposition from talks about change in a system whose rigidity has
caused tens of thousands of East Germans to flee and hundreds of
thousands to protest. The Communist leadership says there already
are enough officially recognized groups in which to discuss
necessary changes.
   ``Renewal of society requires the strong socialist foundation,
which was put in place in a joint effort,'' Krenz said.
   Opposition groups have released written statements from
witnesses and victims describing brutal treatment by police during
protests and while people were in custody.
   Many victims said they were forced to stand naked for hours in
frigid holding cells.
   Others reported being beaten and humiliated by officers after
street protests Oct. 7-8 in East Berlin. Police used clubs to
disperse the demonstrators and arrested hundreds.
   On Tuesday, Krenz said he would seek ``new impulses'' for
possible change from President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet
Union, who champions reform, during a forthcoming visit to Moscow.
   Representatives of several hundred workers at the Wilhelm Pieck
electronics factory said in a statement Monday they had organized
an independent labor union called Reform that demands the right to
strike, and to set wages and prices at the factory.
   On Tuesday, ADN denied such a union had been formed.
   Party leaders are expected to oppose independent unions that
could gain widespread support and challenge the Communist monopoly
on power, as occurred with Solidarity in neighboring Poland.

   Winery worker Ramon Salcido pleaded
innocent Tuesday to charges he killed his wife, two of his
daughters and four other people in a rampage last spring.
   Salcido appeared before Sonoma County Superior Judge J. Brian
Jamar, who accepted the plea and tentatively scheduled Salcido's
trial for Jan. 30.
   However, Public Defender Marteen Miller said he needed more time
to prepare and would probably request a delay in the start of the
trial.
   Miller said he was preparing motions to move the trial to
another county because of news coverage and to challenge Salcido's
reported confession in Mexico. Salcido, a native of Mexico, was
arrested there several days after the April 14 rampage in the wine
country north of San Francisco.
   If convicted, Salcido could be sentenced to death. Miller said
he would argue that the extradition treaty between the United
States and Mexico forbids such a sentence.
   Salcido is charged in the slayings of his wife, Angela; two of
their three daughters; his wife's mother; two of his wife's
sisters; and a co-worker at Grand Cru Vineyards.
   The victims were shot, stabbed and beaten. A third daughter,
3-year-old Carmina, had her throat slashed like the other two, but
survived. She was found alive in the garbage dump where the
youngsters' bodies had been dumped.

   Workers removed an earthquake-damaged
section of the lower deck of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge
on Tuesday, leaving a hole in the structure nearly as glaring as
the hole in the region's transportation system.
   Fifty-foot sections, one atop the other, have now been yanked
out of both levels of the double-decked 53-year-old bridge.
   Officials for the California Department of Transportation will
build new sections, each five lanes wide, and lift them into place.
They estimate the work will take at least one month.
   Steve Saville, a spokesman for the department, said he believed
it was the first time such large pieces had been removed since the
major highway link between the cities opened in 1936.
   ``It's a big hole,'' he said.
   For Bay area residents who escaped injury or property damage,
the closure of the bridge may be the biggest inconvenience of the
earthquake, Saville said. The bridge is normally used by 260,000
cars each day. The state is losing an estimated $130,000 a day in
tolls.
   The 200-ton lower section had been declared a total loss shortly
after the Oct. 17 earthquake. It was chopped into four pieces and
lowered more than 200 feet by crane to a barge floating next to a
bridge tower in San Francisco Bay.
   Transportation Department officials had hoped to repair the
upper section, and undertook a delicate two-day effort to lower
that section last weekend. The upper section was cut into just two
pieces and lowered, but a close inspection showed the steel
framework could not be salvaged, Saville said.
   The repairs will cost $1 million, the agency has said.
   Department planners had accounted for the possibly the upper
section would be unusable, and had already drafted a design for new
construction so the repair time estimate did not have to be
extended, Saville said.
   The 8.5-mile-long bridge had become the symbol of the World
Series between Oakland and San Francisco.
   Nationally broadcast pictures of the broken bridge, with the
upper deck dangling, provided the first graphic illustration of the
magnitude of the 7.1 Richter scale quake. One woman died when she
drove her car into the gap.

<TEXT>
   The Pennsylvania House of Representatives
on Tuesday passed a tough abortion control bill intended to make
the state the first to take advantage of a U.S. Supreme Court
ruling allowing more restrictions.
   After nearly nine hours of debate, the House voted 143-58 for
the new controls and sent the bill to the Senate, which recessed
earlier Tuesday and will not return until Nov. 13. Most attempts to
weaken the bill were easily defeated during the long session.
   Gov. Robert P. Casey has said he backs abortion restrictions
proposed by Republican state Rep. Stephen Freind, the state's
leading anti-abortion lawmaker, who opened debate on the House
floor by calling abortion an ``inherently violent'' act.
   He asked his fellow lawmakers: ``Abortion is the most wrenching
social issue of our time, but since when do we solve our social
problems with violence?''
   Freind called the bill ``a moderate, common sense approach to
this issue.'' Earlier Tuesday, also by a 143-58 vote, the House
approved adding the abortion control language into a pending bill
toughening penalties for incest. A pro-choice leader, Democratic
state Rep. Karen Ritter, argued during debate that the government
has no right to intrude on a woman's decision whether to have an
abortion.
   She said restrictions proposed by Freind trivialize ``one of the
most important decisions a woman can make. ... Why can't we trust a
woman to make the decision when to have a child.''
   Pennsylvania legislators have repeatedly voted for abortion
controls since the U.S. Supreme Court's 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision
made most abortions legal. Efforts to impose new restrictions
started anew after July, when the Supreme Court cleared the way in
a Missouri case for states to impose new restrictions on abortion.
   The anti-abortion proposals under consideration in Pennsylvania
include a ban on abortions after the 24th week of pregnancy, except
in cases where the mother faces irreversible harm, and a
prohibition on abortions for sex selection. Others include a
requirement that women inform their husbands if they plan to get an
abortion, and a 24-hour waiting period.
   ``We've lost amendments in the past and we may lose some
amendments today, but I think we'll pass the bill,'' Freind said.
   The American Civil Liberties Union of Pennsylvania called
Freind's measure ``the most dangerous abortion bill in any state
Legislature in the nation.''
   Ms. Ritter said there was an outside chance of swinging enough
votes to defeat it.
   ``We're not giving up hope on it yet,'' she said.
   The Florida Legislature, called into special session by Gov. Bob
Martinez, recently rejected all of his proposed abortion
restrictions. Last week, a committee of the Illinois House blocked
a bill to restrict abortions.

   Rather than just write out a check,
volunteers toil every day at the Harrison Street Salvation Army
warehouse, unloading emergency supplies, from toiletries to toys,
donated from across the country.
   For many reasons, they drive to this two-story warehouse in the
city's South-of-Market district to give their sweat and time,
helping people they do not know at a time of great need.
   ``I did it for the feeling that I get,'' says Thomas Kay, 20,
who came from San Mateo on his day off from a Safeway store to help.
   Rodger Christopherson, 60, drove from his home in Bevelry Hills,
300 miles south of San Francisco, to do his part. He worked 12
hours on Sunday, including a supply trip to quake-ravaged
Watsonville.
   Still, the self-employed screenwriter and novelist shrugs off
the long hours. ``I think it's much better to have a first-hand

   Fire at a plastics plant burned today
after a series of explosions that flung debris five miles and shook
the ground 25 miles away. At least one worker was killed, more than
100 were injured and 23 were missing.
   ``I thought it was the end,'' said Billy Ridenour, a 35-year-old
worker who was inside the Phillips Petroleum Co. plant. ``I was
thinking, `Run till you die.'''
   Flames and intense heat kept rescuers from getting close enough
to investigate Monday afternoon's explosion, and officials feared
the worst.
   ``We're betting there's a lot of fatalities, just because of the
nature of the explosion and where it happened,'' said Dr. Paul
Pepe, director of Houston's emergency medical services. ``We don't
think there's anybody alive in there.''

   Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze says the
Soviet Union is willing to negotiate an end to the NATO and Warsaw
Pact military alliances and is prepared to eliminate its own
overseas bases by the year 2000.
   And he has promised that as East bloc countries move away from
one-party Communist rule, the Soviet Union will observe strict
principles of non-intervention and ``absolute freedom of choice.''
   In a major foreign policy address to the Supreme Soviet
legislature on Monday, Shevardnadze also condemned his
predecessors' decision to send troops into Afghanistan, calling it
a ``gross violation'' of Soviet law and ethics.
   He also admitted that the Soviet radar station in Krasnoyarsk
violated the U.S.-Soviet Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty. The Soviets
said last month that it would be dismantled, ending a dispute that
soured U.S.-Soviet arms control talks for years.

Soviet negotiators trying to complete a new arms reduction treaty.
   Baker singled out the deadliest missiles in superpower arsenals,
capable of devastating an enemy in a surprise attack, during a
speech Monday in San Francisco. He also urged the Soviets to join
in a strategy shift to defense.
   ``We want to see Soviet defensive military operations made
habitual,'' Baker said in his first in-depth description of the
Bush administration's goals for negotiations under way in Geneva to
cut strategic weapons _ bombers, missiles and nuclear submarines _
on both sides.
   He said the United States would explore ``a cooperative and

   ``Young and Reckless'' may sound like the name
of a soap opera, but a new study says it's the way some 68 million
Americans approach diet and health.
   On the other hand, the study says 45 million others are
``healthy and wealthy'' and characterizes other large groups as
``fat and frustrated'' and even ``confused and indifferent'' about
their health.
   The survey done for Prevention magazine found that middle-aged
women with college degrees lead the healthiest lifestyles, while
white, male, blue-collar workers have the worst health habits.
   The report, ``The Fit and the Fat,'' found a sizable group of
people who want to be healthy but lack the resources, both personal
and financial. Many others know what to do to be healthy but lack
motivation, said Thomas Dybdahl, director of the study.

   Long-suffering consumers have gained the ear of
government with a thundering protest over a new sales tax, but
Japan's nearly lifeless consumer movement still lacks the spirit to
kindle indignation against everyday price gouging.
   ``Japanese consumers could certainly use a break,'' said Masaru
Ogawa, director of the America-Japan Society and a newspaper
columnist. ``They should learn that they don't have to take
everything the government hands them.''
   Japan is an economic giant, but at home people's purchasing
power is midget-sized. Overall, prices in Tokyo are 39 percent
higher than New York and 47 percent higher than Hamburg, West
Germany.
   Prices are driven up by a number of factors, including an
inefficient distribution system, common price-fixing, government
regulations, exorbitant land prices and import restrictions that
keep price competition to a minimum.

<TEXT>
   One night recently police raided several
bars in Beirut and arrested a dozen people for various violations.
Law enforcement still exists in Beirut, but just barely.
   For years, Lebanon's 7,000-man police force has been a virtual
bystander in the civil war and the feuds between heavily armed
militias, powerless to stanch the lawlessness that has engulfed the
country since 1975.
   But since a cease-fire Sept. 22 halted the most recent fighting
between Syrians and Christians, the police have slowly begun
enforcing the law again.
   ``We're like the turtle. It moves slowly, but in the end, when
no one expects it, it gets to where it's going,'' said Col. Nabil
al-Zein, a senior aide to Beirut's chief of detectives, Brig. Gen.
Issam Abu Zaki.
   As the war dragged on, killings, robberies, kidnappings and drug
abuse went virtually unchecked. There have been 60,000 bank
hold-ups since 1975, according to police statistics.
   Much of this was the work of the unruly militias, who maintained
their own rough justice, usually summary executions for those who
violated their rules.
   But ordinary street crime was also rampant, fueled by a sharply
deteriorating economy. Lebanon, long a major source of hashish and
lately heroin, became a thriving domestic market as war-traumatized
youngsters turned to drugs.
   Lebanon's prisons and courts ceased to function years ago.
Militiamen have emptied the prisons many times over, freeing
friends and relatives and leaving the gates open for other inmates.
   An estimated 7,000 murderers, rapists, gunmen and thieves have
been freed this way since 1975.
   But in Beirut, at least, the police are hitting back.
   In May, amid the Syrian-Christian battles, 30 gunmen freed 189
inmates from the central prison in Moslem west Beirut, killing a
police sergeant.
   Most were recaptured by police and headquarters ordered the
arrest of the gunmen hiding out with the militias in the mountains.
In mid-October, a patrol spotted one of the raiders in west Beirut;
he was shot and killed when he tried to pull a gun.
   The police force comprises a detectives division, vice, riot and
traffic squads, a police academy and units of gendarmes who operate
in the countryside.
   Though all the fighting the police force has remained intact,
with Moslem and Christian officers cooperating with each other,
something rarely seen nowadays in Lebanon.
   The state treasury pays police salaries, but it has been unable
to finance new recruits since 1986.
   Abu Zaki, the detective chief, said public support for the
police has reawakened in recent weeks. He noted that anonymous
telephone tipoffs have helped round up scores of drug traffickers
and users.
   ``We're getting hundreds of such tips now. The number grows
every day,'' he said.
   One of the main police functions in recent years has been
keeping statistics of the violence and casualties.
   But the police still have a long way to go before they'll be
able to regain the authority police departments in other countries
take for granted.
   Every morning, Sgt. Naji Abu-Haidar puts on his khaki uniform,
climbs on his 25-year-old Harley Davidson motorcycle and roars off
into Beirut's chaotic traffic.
   He hands out tickets to violators, cools down hot-tempered cab
drivers and tries to unsnarl the clogged streets.
   But when militiamen start shooting at each other, often over
nothing more than who gets served first at a gasoline station, Sgt.
Abu-Haidar looks the other way.
   After 14 years of war, he knows the rules of survival.
   ``I'll be retiring in a couple of years,'' he said, ``and I
don't plan to get killed.''

<HEAD>`Kojak' Star Plays Has-Been TV Detective in Cable Comedy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a case of cable spoofing art, the USA Network
tonight is airing ``The Hollywood Detective,'' a sly comedy about a
once-famous TV detective fallen on hard times. It stars Telly
Savalas.
   Savalas, of course, didn't fall on hard times when CBS axed his
``Kojak'' series in 1978. He's even returning to television Nov. 4
as the tough New York cop in a new ``Kojak,'' part of ABC's
``Saturday Mystery'' series.
   But USA's movie does make you think, particularly at one point
when a reporter asks Savalas' faded TV detective, middle-aged actor
Harry Bell, the name and network of his old TV series.
   The faded star beams. ``Oh, yes,'' he casually says. `` `John
Crowne, Private Investigator,' NBC. You know, there is talk
recently about renewing the series, and I...'' Two real police
detectives hustle him away.
   A funny moment. Savalas is wonderful in it and throughout the
film. He shows a previously unseen comic side, playing a ham who
made millions in eight years as a TV detective but hasn't worked in
12 years.
   Although our hero visibly inflates when someone recognizes him,
he now lives alone, unloved and unemployed in his personal Tap
City, an ancient Hollywood bungalow surrounded by dry weeds.
   ``Detective'' vaguely echoes a nifty Art Carney-Lily Tomlin
movie of 1977, ``The Late Show,'' complete with a flakey Hollywood
lady, sweetly portrayed here by Helen Udy. But it's gently funny in
its own way.
   The two-hour film concerns, give or take, a missing-persons case
that our hero reluctantly accepts, aware that he's no detective.
   But he also is aware he needs money. Bills are piling up, his
stove was repossessed, and he hasn't even a hot plate on which to
warm his dinner, a can of tamales. Still, he remains a ham, even
with cold tamales.
   Up for a small part as an Irish priest in a TV movie at
Universal Studios, he recalls in his gumshoe-movie narration that
``the studio had been good to me once, and I figured I owed them
one.''Nope, the network says.
   His sleazy agent (nicely played by George Coe), a fan of porn
movies, says he could land him the lead in a new ``personal
picture'' called ``Author of Lust.'' Throttling Coe, the enraged
actor shouts the worst insult he can muster: ``You agent, you!''
   But when all seems lost, there is a knock on his door. The
knocker (Udy) is a young woman, Lois Wednesday. Like some Hollywood
inmates, she is not what network executives would call
reality-based.
   This is not just because her hair has tints of purple and blue,
the number of her apartment is ``1412},'' and her phone is shaped
like a tennis shoe. No, it is because she thinks Harry Bell, the
actor, really can solve a case.
   The case is her missing boyfriend. They met, had a fling, ``and
then he kinda sorta moved in,'' she explains in her wistful, wispy
voice. But he has disappeared, leaving behind $10,000 in cash.
   Harry Bell, actor, explains that he is no detective. However,
with the chance of earning $100 a day, plus expenses, he thinks
that ``maybe, just maybe, being a real detective wasn't much
different than being one on TV.''
   He soon learns that there is a small difference as he goes
through plot twists involving medflies, blackmail, the Hollenbeck
Fruit Company, a car chase, his arrest as a murder suspect, and a
once-great TV story consultant he summons when the case gets too
baffling.
   There also are two stiffs.
   While the proceedings sag slightly near the gunfire-filled
finale, this ``Detective,'' well-written by Christopher Crowe and
deftly directed by Kevin Connor, is a fine and funny film. You'll
like it.

   Elsewhere on television...
   ANOTHER REASON TO CONTINUE LIVING: NBC's cable operation, CNBC,
has hired Morton Downey Jr. You may recall him as the host of a
much-publized, now-defunct syndicated talk show. It featured a lot
of shouting and he would bellow ``Zip it!'' to those with whom he
disagreed.
   Starting Dec. 4, he will host ``Showdown,'' a half-hour
weeknight series in which he will debate great issues with another
regular, New York Daily News columnist Richard G. Carter. Guest
experts also will check in and, as was the case in his old series,
there will be a studio audience.
   However, says CNBC spokesman Jim Boyle, Downey has ``pledged to
be much different than what he was in his old show'' and that his
new show will be ``toned down.'' And that the audience will not get
to shout.

<HEAD>Decade May Bring Insights in Fight Against Heart Disease, Cancer</HEAD>
<HEAD>AP Graphic, AP Graphic Logo</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE>
<TEXT>
   In laboratories around the world, researchers
are developing weapons to defend against life's biggest killers.
They look for major steps forward in the 1990s. This is one of a
periodic series of articles, ``The '90s,'' looking ahead o the
promise and peril of the upcoming decade, in the environment,
medicine, technology and society.

<TEXT>
   Two big killers will count their victims in the millions in the
1990s _ 13 million American lives claimed by heart disease and
cancer if the current fatality rate continues.
   But medical researchers hope to strike some telling blows
against these deadliest enemies in the coming decade. They don't
expect cures; instead, they look for new insights to help them
attack the diseases from many directions.
   Better understanding of cancer-causing genes and how to block
them, for example, and of cancer-suppressing genes and how to
harness them, would give medical scientists crucial new weapons to
wield against cancer, which will kill an estimated 500,000
Americans this year.
   And new discoveries about the relationship of diet to heart
disease might lead to innovative treatments for the nation's
leading killer, cause of 767,000 American deaths in 1988, about
one-third of the deaths from all causes.
   Just about everybody has heard about eating right to avoid high
levels of cholesterol in the blood. Cholesterol can promote
atherosclerosis, a narrowing of the arteries that sets the stage
for heart attacks.
   But in the next decade, ``we may learn that what you eat is more
important than just what it does to your cholesterol,'' said Rodman
Starke, the American Heart Association's senior vice president for
scientific affairs.
   ``We are beginning to see glimmers of evidence'' that some
dietary substances may affect atherosclerosis risk independently of
any impact on cholesterol, he said. They may also promote blood
clotting, which can cause heart attacks when it occurs in narrowed
arteries that feed blood to the heart muscle, he said.
   Scientists may also find better ways to prevent heart attacks as
they learn more details about what triggers them in people with
atherosclerosis, said James Willerson, chairman of the heart
association's research committee.
   He also said researchers may find a way to identify people at
risk for sudden cardiac death, a lethal disruption of the heart's
pumping rhythm, and develop better techniques to prevent it.
   Other potential developments Starke or Willerson suggested for
the 1990s include:
   _Greater understanding of the complex events that produce
atherosclerosis, perhaps leading to treatments to reverse or avoid
it.
   _Improved clot-dissolving drugs to stop heart attacks.
Researchers would like to reduce side effects, confine the
anti-clotting effect to places where it will do good, and stop the
effect of the drugs when needed to avoid risk of excessive bleeding.
   _Better understanding and possible prevention of a re-narrowing
of atherosclerotic arteries after a procedure called angioplasty is
used to widen them. This occurs in 25 percent to 40 percent of
patients who go through angioplasty and is a major stumbling block
to the procedure's success, Willerson said.
   As with heart disease, some of the advances experts hope for in
the fight against cancer in the 1990s deal with prevention.
   Researchers may find genetic tests to identify people at high
risk for cancer of the colon or breast, and probably some other
common cancers as well, said John Laszlo, the cancer society's
senior vice president for research.
   Warnings and instructions about prevention should pack more
wallop for those people than the blanket recommendations now given
to everybody, he said.
   ``When you're talking about the possibility of changing your
diet for your lifetime, it would be nice to know ahead of time
whether it would be important for you to do that,'' Laszlo said.
   Another payoff in identifying people at particular risk for
certain cancers would be the ability to learn more about
effectiveness of preventive steps, said Vincent DeVita, former
National Cancer Institute director.
   If experiments can be focused on people at high risk,
researchers can get better information on how much of a diet or
lifestyle change is needed, and for how long, in order to cut
cancer risk, said DeVita, who is physician-in-chief at the Memorial
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York.
   He and Laszlo also expect progress in making chemotherapy more
effective by sabotaging the ability of some cancer cells to resist
it. That could help treatment of many kinds of cancers, and
particularly those of the breast, colon and pancreas, they said.
   Among the other possible developments in the 1990s suggested by
DeVita or Laszlo:
   _The first experiments in people with ``anti-sense'' DNA,
substances designed to block the effect of cancer-causing genes.
   _Routine use during chemotherapy of recently discovered
colony-stimulating factors, allowing higher doses of medicine. The
substances counter a major side effect of chemotherapy, decreases
in infection-fighting white blood cells.
   _Advances in the use of monoclonal antibodies, molecules that
can seek out and bind to cancer cells, to deliver radiation
treatment or to keep cancer cells from responding to substances
that spur their growth.
   _More research into suppressor genes, which act to prevent
development of cancer. Perhaps the substances they direct cells to
make can be harnessed to fight cancer, DeVita said.
   ``Theoretically it should work, and technically there's no
reason it can't be done,'' he said. ``So stay tuned.''

   When the Philadelphia 76ers play their first
home game this season, Grover Washington Jr. will be there,
performing the national anthem.
   It's a tradition, and a logical one _ not just because the
saxophonist lives in the suburb of Germantown or that former 76ers
star Julius Erving is a close friend.
   Musically, Washington says, it makes sense as well. That's
right, jazz and basketball. Riffs and dunks. Horn charts and game
plans. He can hear it now, ``Starting at guard, please welcome,
Grover Washington Jr.''
   ``We live really parallel lives,'' said Washington, who even
wrote a song about Erving called ``Let It Flow.''
   ``We are trying to create, whether it's on the court or on the
bandstand or the stage, the concept of team play _ whether you are
on a basketball team or whether you are in a band.
   ``There are role players on a basketball team and role players
in a band. Everybody shifts around, everybody gets to handle the
ball, so to speak. My role is like the point guard. I try to give
the ball to the people who can really do things with it. I'm also
like a player-coach.''
   Washington has provided valuable assists to collaborators Ralph
McDonald, Ronnie Foster, Donald Robinson and others. Singer Bill
Withers got a boost in 1980 when the saxophonist phoned and urged
him to add vocals to the track of ``Just the Two of Us,'' a No. 2
hit off the platinum ``Winelight'' album, winner of the ``Best Jazz
Fusion Performance'' Grammy.
   On ``Time Out of My Mind,'' his 21st album, he offers
encouragement to the 1990 Trans-Antarctic Expedition Explorers with
``Protect the Dream.'' Sports crept in again as Washington
explained why he was supporting those inspecting environmental
conditions around the Antarctic.
   ``When I think of those guys on foot and on skis, going across
Antartica, I realize all that is really for all of us,'' he said.
``They come back with information and the ball will be in our
court. There are a lot of concerned people around that will take
the advice and the facts they will be finding out.''
   Washington sees his own work as information. Short stories
without words. Impressions, often first impressions, turned into
sound. The titles are a clue: ``Gramercy Park,'' a melodic James
McBride-Damon DueWhite composition about the historic section of
Manhattan, or the romantic ``Unspoken Love,'' written by Gerald
Veasley.
   The title track, a hit for Steely Dan, is a gesture of thanks to
the jazz-rock group.
   ``Every time I get in my car and ride to New York, its either
`Gaucho,' or `Nightfly,''' Washington said of the Steely Dan record
and group member Donald Fagen's solo album.
   ``Plus with that group, they've been some of the guys on the
cutting edge of entertaining. ... They talk about religion, the
Third World. They talk about glamour, how living hard will take its
toll.''
   Washington likes a pace as relaxed as his own sweet saxophone.
That means time with his wife, Christine, and children, Shana Bly
and Grover III. Jam sessions are balanced by parents' night at
school. It makes for a richer life, and better records, he says.
   ``Through the things I do every day, I can relate in musical
terms to my fans, let them know we have more similarities than
differences. I am more than a one-dimensional person and the
audience is more than a one-dimensional audience.''
   He was born in 1943 in Buffalo, N.Y., and was playing sax by age
10. Washington's career took off in 1970 when he was featured on
Johnny ``Hammond'' Smith's ``Breakout'' and arranged the cover of
Carole King's ``It's too Late.'' His first solo record, the
acclaimed ``Inner City Blues,'' came by accident when he wound up
doing a solo intended for tenor saxophonist Hank Crawford who
couldn't make the studio date at the last minute.
   The title track is a cover of Marvin Gaye's haunting meditation
on urban life. Appropriate, since Gaye, and another personal
favorite of Washington's, Stevie Wonder, have often incorporated
jazz into their own work.
   Jazz greats Charlie Parker, Sonny Rollins, Cannonball Adderley
and John Coltrane are important influences. Washington also
incorporates classical music and sounds from South America, Europe,
Africa and Japan.
   But he thinks locally as well as globally. He doesn't need to
travel 5,000 miles for inspiration: Just walking down the street is
enough.
   ``There's a record player playing in here all the time,'' he
said, pointing to his head. ``I'm listening to everything. The
screech of brakes. Three or four people walking and you can hear
their heels clicking. Railroad tracks.
   ``Any kind of movement. Birds wings. There's a lot of things to
be learned just by picking up on the subtle things that really
present the whole musical picture.''

   Playfully and masterfully, Julia Child sedto the kitchen in the 1960s.
Now, finally, she iuced
America ins back,
seasoned oh so slightly by the health fanatics but as spicy and
devoted to the joys of the table as ever.
   To much of America, she is the French chef they know and love,
trilling ``bon appetit'' at the close of her landmark TV cooking
lessons and willing to be a little like us by occasionally dropping
a piece of chicken live on television and putting it back in the
pan.
   ``Mastering the Art of French Cooking,'' in two volumes, became
manus cooks. And Julia Child became etched in our
datory for serioculture, her voice, her 6-foot-2 frame and her funny, charming
presence. Even non-cooks know Dan Aykroyd's parody on ``Saturday
Night Live'' (she found it ``terribly funny'').
   Now, at 77, she has published her seventh _ and, she says, last
_ book, with the no-nonsense title ``The Way to Cook'' and a
no-nonsense price of $50. With more than 800 recipes in 511 pages,
it weighs in at a very serious 5{ pounds. It is the first cookbook
chosen as a main selection by Book of the Month Club.
   ``I felt it was time for a new book and a new look,'' she said
in a recent interview. ```Mastering' was very classical French, no
deviating at all.''
   ``The Way'' deviates, blending classic technique with free-style
American cooking.
   Aimed at a generation for whom cooking may mean ``Lean Cuisine''
in the microwave, ``The Way to Cook'' includes such things as
Chinese manicotti, which she calls an ``Italo-Sino conversation
piece and unusually good eating.''
   But this is by no means a new world of food. While there are
plenty of low-fat recipes, there's no shortage of butter or cream.
   Or the egg, ``that perfect, pristine, primal object. We may not
gobble it up as profusely now as we used to, but every mouthful
should be memorable.''
   And that is the essence of her attitude toward the fervor over
healthy eating. Give up nothing. Eat with pleasure but in
moderation.
   She bemoans the loss of ``those happy days in the '60s when
everyone ate butter and cream. ... Oh, they were lovely days.''
   Child says she has had to watch her weight for the last 35 years.
   ``I am very careful about my fat content and calories and eat
much smaller portions. I am conscious of not wanting to be a Mrs.
6-by-6.''
   But that does not mean a lack of good food or good company.
   ``The main thing is getting people together,'' said Child, who
first learned to cook so she could feed her husband. ``I get very
depressed when I don't eat well _ and that doesn't mean fancy.''
   Americans' approach to food these days has her worried.
   ``What's dangerous and discouraging about this era is that
people really are afraid of their food. Sitting down to dinner is a
trap, not something to enjoy. People should take their food more
seriously. Learn what you can eat and enjoy it thoroughly.''
   In a discussion of the nutrients in vegetables, she writes of
``nervous nutritional nellies,'' who boil sprouts or green beans in
a small covered pan rather than lots of water. The results, she
writes, are ``invariably unappetizing, inedible and a dull
gray-green. One reason, I am sure, that many people hate vegetables
is because they're cooked like medicine. But fresh vegetables are
glorious food.''
   Child is foremost a teacher, though she says she would have been
happy as a butcher and is proud of her puff pastry method and of
the work she's done with poultry and bread.
   In ``The Way to Cook,'' published this month by Alfred A. Knopf,
Child teaches. The book is demanding but accessible, without
recipes like the daunting 13 pages for French bread in the second
volume of ``Mastering.''
   The color photographs show the food as the cook sees it and
there are plenty of them. Nine, for example, show step-by-step how
to truss a chicken, and nine take the cook from a pile of butter
and flour to puff pastry.
   ``It's really sort of a distillation of her whole career,'' said
Peter Kump of Kump's New York Cooking School. ``She's expressing
herself more clearly, more ably, in a way that I think is just
superlative.''
   And like a great teacher, Child anticipates questions. When she
suggests creaming butter with a wooden spoon, she adds: ``You can
use a hand-held mixer, but it's such a nuisance to scrape the
butter out of the blades!''
   Recipes are grouped unconventionally by technique, so, for
example, pork and veal chops are together rather than pork chops
and pork roast. The croutons for fish soups are with the soups, not
the breads. There are master recipes and then variations.
   ``I want to encourage them to think of their own ways,'' Child
said, and while she has little patience for fads (``It's as though
people didn't dare do anything traditional.''), the master recipe
method allows for adding the trendy ingredient de jour.
   Modern appliances, like the food processor, are used, but Child
has not been won over to the microwave oven, which she uses for
defrosting, rewarming or starting dishes, but leaves her too little
control over actual cooking.
   She does, however, suggest using a blowtorch. A blowtorch?
   ``A blowtorch is not just for laughs _ it is a legitimate
kitchen tool, and marvelous for loosening aspics from their
molds.'' She even suggests what kind to buy.

   Transplant surgeons expect to be able to
replace almost every part of the human body during the 1990s, but
they fear such medical feats will have little impact unless more
people donate organs.
   ``I see another decade of progress equal to the last decade, but
that won't happen until we figure out the organ donor problem a
little bit better,'' said the University of Iowa's Dr. Robert
Corry, president of the United Network for Organ Sharing.
   Organ donation has been at a standstill the past few years,
despite laws requiring hospitals to discuss the subject with
relatives of brain-dead patients.
   ``One of the goals is that one of these days organ donation will
be viewed as commonplace as giving blood,'' said Linda Sheaffer,
director of the federal Division of Organ Transplantation.
   ``Can we achieve that in the 1990s? I'm just not sure,'' she
said.
   Doctors hope to ease the crunch in '90s by transplanting animal
organs into humans. Such a cross-species transplant has not been
attempted since 1984, when California surgeons put a baboon's heart
into a 12-day-old girl. She died 20 days later.
   Advances also are expected in the quest for artificial organs,
especially heart assist devices, that can be implanted permanently.
   Less flashy, but no less important, are efforts to attain
long-term transplantation success without anti-rejection drugs that
suppress the patient's entire immune system, and to extend the
shelf life of donated organs.
   Doctors are working to perfect pancreas, lung, intestinal and
reproductive organ transplants and to replace limbs with cadaver
parts.
   About the only irreplaceable part seems to be the brain.
   ``It's a question of identity,'' said transplant pioneer Dr.
Thomas Starzl of the University of Pittsburgh. ``If you found a
body for the brain, you'd transplant the body to the brain. It's a
subtle distinction. I wouldn't have any plans for that.''
   Whatever the advances, however, the donor flow may remain a
problem.
   ``The whole thing would be revolutionized overnight if you could
do something about that,'' Starzl said. ``When there's a crack in
that wall, it's going to be like the Atlantic Ocean pouring
through.''
   Studies show almost all Americans are aware of organ donation
and view transplantation favorably. But only a slight majority
express willingness to give loved ones' hearts, livers, kidneys and
other vital parts so others may live. Fewer still want their own
organs donated upon death.
   A record 18,500-plus people are awaiting organ transplants in
the United States, according to the organ network. The list grows
daily, as do the number of nagging questions concerning who gets
what and who pays.
   ``In some respects, I think it's just as well there's a limited
supply of donor organs,'' said Roger Evans, a senior research
scientist at the Battelle Seattle Research Center.
   ``When you think of 1,647 hearts (transplanted in 1988), it
really is not that big a deal,'' Evans said. ``If we had more donor
organs, it would ... raise more questions of how we can afford to
offer this technology.''

   To his neighbors, John Cotter Jr. was a
wealthy real estate developer who had it all, the son of a retired
state Supreme Court chief justice, himself the patriarch of an
elegant family, a loving father who took his son hunting.
   But inside, Cotter was tortured by ``monsters,'' tormented by
his business failures, shattered by the recent discovery that his
son had epilepsy.
   Hopelessness overtook him and in the end he shot himself _ but
not before taking the lives of his wife, son and daughter.
   The tragedy recalls other cases in which people bent on killing
themselves have taken innocents, even bystanders, with them _
people like Joseph Wesbecker, the former mental patient who in
September killed nine, including himself, in a Louisville, Ky.,
printing plant rampage.
   Psychologists and physiologists are only beginning to isolate
possible reasons for such perplexing behavior. Besides personal
pressures that seem unbearable, they cite perverse love-hate
relationships between some killers and victims, and in many cases a
deficiency in a message-carrying chemical in the brain.
   The details of Cotter's final act provide a dim light down the
foreboding tunnels of the mind.
   ``There was nothing strange about them,'' said Jane
Longley-Cook, a neighbor who was in a car pool with Cotter's wife,
Anne.
   Mrs. Cotter, 44, was a patron of the arts and a caring mother so
thoughtful she'd hand out trick-or-treat candy in advance of
Halloween if she was going to be away. The daughter, Julia, 21,
graduated from college last spring with a degree in French and
planned to spend some time in England. The son, John III, 17, was
enrolled in a private school.
   ``It probably was the biggest shock of my life,'' Mrs.
Longley-Cook said of the July killings in the three-story brick
house across the street. ``I don't think we'll ever know what
causes people to do things like that.''
   Cotter, a shy, private man of 47, had started seeing a
psychiatrist about a month before. According to police reports, he
indicated to the therapist that he was depressed because of, among
other things, financial problems and the illness of his son, a
loner who had few close friends.
   About a year earlier, the son suffered a seizure while driving,
which led to the discovery he had epilepsy.
   The psychiatrist, who prescribed anti-depressant drugs for
Cotter, would not comment on the case, but police said he indicated
Cotter never talked about taking his own life, let alone killing
his family. Just a week or two before the shootings, he told the
therapist his difficulties seemed to be straightening out,
according to investigators.
   But apparently pressure began to build in a mind psychiatrists
say might have crossed the line from reality to exaggeration. His
last thoughts were scribbled on a single page of paper in
disjointed and unpunctuated notes:
   ``Depression
   ``Shaking uncontrollably inside
   ``Destitute
   ``No hope
   ``No hope for family
   ``No good insurance
   ``Epilepsy
   ``John III is depressed from Tegretol (medication to control
seizures) and ... walks the house at night as I do He worries about
another seizure and accident, becoming a closeted person
   ``Death, nervous breakdown depression is everywhere
   ``The monster shakes my body each night and I wake trembling.''
   The page ended with a reference to his wife, who was mourning
the recent loss of her mother:
   ``No future, no hope, suffering for all of us _ she suffered in
the past and can't suffer again.''
   Cotter also left an eight-page letter alleging payoffs and the
mishandling of funds and grants in the Connecticut Housing Finance
Authority, which makes loans for projects, including low-income
housing for the poor. While Cotter did not implicate himself, he
alleged that the purported scheme to defraud the authority involved
real estate he had owned. The state is investigating.
   Cotter himself was facing a half-dozen civil suits filed by
tenants of one of his developments seeking more than $2 million in
damages from a fire. At a probate hearing, a judge said Cotter's
estate might not be enough to cover his debts.
   Dr. Alan L. Berman, a professor of psychology at The American
University in Washington, said Cotter's notes are an expression of
tremendous anxiety, fear or threat he felt and an inability to
separate himself from his family.
   Some suicidal people in a twisted state of mind may see those
they murder as themselves. ``They are so fused, so incapable of
distinguishing that this other person is a separate human being,
the suicidal motive extends to having to kill this other person as
well,'' said Berman.
   The most typical murder-suicide is one in which two partners
depend on and abuse each other for affection in a love-hate
relationship marked by separations, threats and accusations of
infidelity, he said.
   ``They cannot exist separate from each other and they really
can't live with each other without being abusive. So it's sort of a
final act that communicates just that and that is: `I am so
despairing because you're threatening to leave me. I hate you so
much and I love you so much, I have to take you with me and I have
to go.'''
   Berman told of a Baltimore man who shot his lover three times in
the head, then bent over and kissed her before killing himself.
   Nancy Allen, a Los Angeles counselor, found in a study of 104
murder-suicides that 71 percent of the murderers were husbands or
boyfriends of the victims. In half of the cases, the couple had
been drinking.
   Studies since 1976 link such violent and impulsive behavior to a
decrease in the chemical called serotonin, which carries messages
between brain cells.
   ``Serotonin has been found to be the lowest in
murder-suicides,'' said Dr. Susan J. Blumenthal, a psychiatrist and
chief of the Behavioral Medicine Program at the National Institute
of Mental Health in Rockville, Md. ``It's also very low in
arsonists who then kill themselves or attempt suicide.''
   Some who commit murder-suicide fall victim to depression or
psychosis, unable to distinguish reality from fantasy, hearing
voices telling them to hurt themselves and others. They blame
others including family members or their work supervisors for their
failures and their hurt, often exaggerated in the exhaustion of the
mind.
   ``These are people ... who feel helpless in the face of being
victimized by someone else,'' said Dr. Ronald S. Ebert, senior
forensic psychologist at McLean Hospital in Belmont, Mass.

   Such was the case with Wesbecker, a 47-year-old pressman who was
put on disability leave last year. A manic depressive, he had
attempted suicide three times. Co-workers said he carried a grudge
because he was laid off and feared his disability benefits were
going to be stopped.
   ``You're dealing with a man who perceives a miscarriage of
justice and he's going to correct it,'' said Dr. Martin Symonds,
chairman of the American Psychiatric Association's Task Force on
Victimization.
   Despising what they did, unable to live with themselves after
killing someone, particularly someone close, many murderers then
take their own lives.
   The National Institute of Mental Health's Blumenthal said that
in over 90 percent of suicides there is some humiliating life event
in the recent past. ``There's a breakup in a relationship. They've
lost a job. They've lost some financial status. They're about to be
confronted by the law.''
   No one knows for sure what was going through John Cotter's mind
that fatal summer day on Woodside Circle.
   ``I think everybody wishes they knew because you could say,
`Well, it happened because of this and we can put it behind us,'''
said Mrs. Longley-Cook, a mother of three.
   ``I think that's what's very frightening to chldren. They see
this happy family across the street and then suddenly they hear the
father murdered everyone and killed himself. That's pretty
devastating for children. Every time I see the house, I just can't
believe that's happened there.''

<HEAD>The Enigmatic Pynchon To Publish `Vineland'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEVIN GALVIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rumor has it Thomas Pynchon is back in New York
again preparing to publish a new book, unless the tales about him
tracing the Mason-Dixon Line or hiding out in Latin America are to
be believed.
   Most of what's known about the elusive, award-winning author of
``V.'' and ``The Crying of Lot 49'' is learned through rumor. He
hasn't published a novel in nearly 17 years, yet some academics and
hardcore admirers still rank him among the greatest American
novelists of the 20th century, if only for his 1973 epic
``Gravity's Rainbow.''
   In a day of so many ephemeral authors, Pynchon remains
relatively unknown, virtually unphotographed and as mystifying a
character as any he's created.
   ``Simply put, Pynchon has a status in American writing that
William Faulkner had in the early part of the century,'' said
Edward Mendelson, a professor of comparative literature at Columbia
University.
   ``There seems to be a book that every age or generation develops
to understand its own world. `Gravity's Rainbow,' more than any
other, is the book post-war America can use to understand how it
got to be the way it is.''
   Pynchon has shunned the public eye since ``V.'' was published in
1963, saying, ``What's important is what's on the page.'' When he
won the National Book Award in 1973, he sent a comedian, Professor
Irwin Corey, to accept it for him. He was named a MacArthur Fellow
in 1988, but the foundation had trouble figuring out where to send
the check.
   A portrait of Pynchon emerges from conversations with several
friends on whom he has relied for decades yet hasn't contacted in
five or six years. Most of them spoke on the condition that their
names not be used.
   The 52-year-old Cornell University graduate appears to have
virtually disappeared into the fabric of society, moving almost
free of its burdens, with few possessions and never taking a wife
or a job, much as Lt. Tyrone Slothrop literally disappears at the
close of ``Gravity's Rainbow.''
   But unlike the elusive writer J.D. Salinger, who withdrew into
rural New Hampshire once he became famous, Pynchon need not worry
about being recognized; only a handful of people know what he looks
like.
   ``It isn't something that came to him because he got famous. He
was that way before, and why I don't quite know,'' said Corlies
Smith, who was instrumental in publishing one of Pynchon's first
stories in the early 1960s.
   Smith edited ``V.'' and ``Gravity's Rainbow,'' but in his
30-year association with the author, he's seen Pynchon only four or
five times.
   ``He does not wish to be written about,'' one friend said. ``He
wanted to be known for the writing and not for the story about
him.''
   ``Gravity's Rainbow'' has become a benchmark that many
post-World War II American novels are measured against. The story
is a dizzyingly entertaining tale of Slothrop's departure from
World War II London and his adventures wandering through
demilitarized Europe searching, in part, for information on the
German V-2 rockets.
   But the novel also deals with man's use of metaphor to organize
his world and through the arc metaphor that permeates the book as
it examines history.
   ``A lot of the metaphor is concerned with Christmas and Advent
and (that) seems to equate the rise of history with an upward arc
to the birth of Christ,'' said Stephen Fix, dean of Williams
College. ``There is a transformation there; history is desanctified
and replaced by technology. The other side of the arc ... is
gravity's rainbow.''
   But far from the stodgy style one might expect from such an
endeavor, Pynchon's prose is colored with surrealistic overtones
and the characters often burst into song, like a 1930s musical.
There is a ``pure goofiness that's matched with this high
rhetorical voice. He can change gears with you on a moments notice
without that ever feeling false,'' Fix said.
   Equally intriguing is Pynchon's research into the workings of
the V-2s and such arcane topics as international corporate
alliances that pre-dated the war. Past associates said his
attention to detail led him to travel the Mason-Dixon Line in the
early 1980s, gathering information for a book on the 18th century
English astronomers Charles Mason and Jeremiah Dixon.
   ``Opera librettos, movies and television drama are allowed to
get away with all kinds of errors in detail,'' Pynchon wrote in the
introduction to ``Slow Learner,'' a collection of his early short
stories published in 1984. ``Too much time in front of the Tube and
a writer can get to believing the same thing about fiction. Not so.
Though it may not be wrong absolutely to make up, as I still do,
what I don't know or am too lazy to find out, phony data are more
often than not deployed in places sensitive enough to make a
difference, thereby losing what marginal charm they may have
possessed outside the story's context.''
   The new novel, ``Vineland,'' to be published by Little Brown &amp;
Co. in February, is a shorter, straightforward story set in
California about characters who try to reconcile coming of age in
the '60s with life in the 1980s, according to its editor, Ray
Roberts.
   Roberts doesn't like to discuss the book and he refuses to talk
about his meetings and work with the author.
   Publicity material for ``Vineland'' reads: ``It is 1984, and
Frenesi Gates' job as an FBI sting specialist has just been cut
from the Reagan budget. Out in the cold now, she may also have
become a target for her ex-lover, federal prosecutor Brock Vond,
who has come storming into northern California at the head of a
heavily armed strike force.''
   Gates' old Berkeley chums are beginning to vanish, and the
daughter she walked out on 15 years ago comes looking for her.
``Combining elements of a daytime drama and the political thriller,
Vineland also marks Pynchon's return to the California dreamscape
he last explored in `The Crying of Lot 49,''' according to the
catalog copy.

<HEAD>Ecologists Despair of Global Warming; Scientists Less Sure</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Worrying about the threat of global warming
has become a major preoccupation among environmental groups and
think tanks, but in the scientific community not everyone is quite
so willing to run for cover.
   The ``greenhouse effect'' is threatening to raise temperatures,
melt the polar ice caps, change climate and generally disrupt
civilization, say those concerned about the hazard.
   But others point out that just a decade or so ago, similar
warnings were being issued that the world was headed into another
ice age.
   Many weather researchers hesitate to pronounce any conclusion on
global warming, pointing out that too little is known about the
threat to make a judgment.
   In an effort to sort out the problem, a coalition of government
agencies has launched a research effort that could extend over
several years.
   Among those taking part are the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration, the Geological Survey, the Defense Department, the
Council on Environmental Quality, the National Science Foundation,
the Agriculture Department, the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency.
   While the theory behind the greenhouse effect seems pretty
simple, it's like a lot of other theories _ the reality is more
complicated than the hypothesis.
   The theory goes like this: Industrial processes over the last
century have spilled a lot of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.
Although carbon dioxide is colorless, odorless and essentially
harmless by itself, it slows the passage of heat. Having extra
carbon dioxide in the air means light can come in and warm the
Earth, but heat can't go back out as easily as it once did.
   Thus, the theory is that the Earth should warm up because of the
extra carbon dioxide. It's called the greenhouse effect because of
the trapping of heat by the atmosphere, somewhat like the trapping
of warmth by greenhouse glass.
   Recent warm summers increased concern about this possibility,
and some eminent scientists have raised the possibility of a
hazardous overheating.
   These include G.O.P. Obasi, head of the World Meteorological
Organization, James Hansen of the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration and Stephen Schneider of the National Center for
Atmospheric Research.
   A spate of worrisome reports, studies, analyses and
recommendations has come from such wide-ranging groups as the
Worldwatch Institute, the American Society of Mechanical Engineers,
the Center for Strategic and International Studies, the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce and Zero Population Growth.
   Yet, voices are increasingly being heard on the other side of
the issue, especially in light of reports seeming to show a reduced
threat.
   ``It's obvious that the most recent scientific results are
drastically cutting the estimates of global warming,''
climatologist Patrick Michaels of the University of Virginia said
in a telephone interview.
   ``The more realistic climate models have more than halved the
estimates of prospective warming, and when compared to observed
temperatures it still appears that these may be overestimates,''
Michaels said.
   ``It's intriguing to me that people with interventionist points
of view tend to neglect the most sophisticated scientific
findings,'' he concluded.
   The effect of clouds on the warning threat has been a major
factor in recent studies.
   Computer models of the climate have been the source of many of
the concerns about the warming but many models have little ability
to include clouds. Indeed, until recently opinions were mixed over
whether clouds would cool the Earth or add to the heating.
   But new studies have found that, overall, clouds have a cooling
effect by blocking incoming sunlight. How much cooling will result
remains to be seen. Some scientists say the clouds could cut the
threatened warming in half.
   And if warming does occur it could result in more evaporation of
water, making more clouds, so a new balance could be reached with
only little global warming.
   Computer models trying to find this balance disagree with one
another, however, leaving many scientists unwilling to recommend
anything beyond more research.
   They warn that a few hot years don't make a trend, just as the
hot summers in the 1930s didn't mean global warming was imminent
and the cooling trend from 1940 to 1980 didn't mean another ice age.
   Some climate warming reported over the last century could have
resulted from changes in the brightness of the sun, commented
Robert Jastrow, former head of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space
Studies.
   ``Forecasters cannot rely on the temperature increase observed
in the last 100 years as an indicator of greenhouse warming in the
next century,'' said Jastrow.
   Other studies have indicated that reports of increases in
average temperature over the last 100 years may even be
exaggerated. National Climatic Data Center studies found that in
many cases temperature records are kept in cities that have
recorded rising temperature as they grew larger and more crowded.
   ``We are confronted with an inverted pyramid of knowledge; a
huge and growing mass of proposals for policy action is balanced on
a handful of real facts,'' said Robert M. White of the National
Academy of Engineering.
   Writing in the September issue of the Bulletin of the American
Meteorological Society, he asked:
   ``Can we arrest or slow the processes that increase the
concentrations of greenhouse gases? The answer is yes. But we have
no grasp on the social and economic ramifications of intervention.''
   Nonetheless, many environmentalists continue to advocate action
on the theory that by the time science can give conclusive answers
it may be too late to slow the warming trend.
   ``Clearly, society does not have the resources to hedge against
all possible negative future outcomes,'' concedes Schneider at the
atmospheric research center.
   But, he says, while research continues ``society should pursue
those actions that provide widely agreed social benefits even if
the predicted change does not materialize.''
   Prime among those suggestions is improved energy efficiency that
reduces release of carbon dioxide and also cuts down on energy
costs and air pollution. Other steps would include developing
alternative technologies and testing new crop strains.
   Waiting for scientific consensus, he contends, could allow the
warming to speed up out of control, forcing society to face an even
larger and faster growing problem than is already feared.

<HEAD>Army Says Beretta USA In Default of Pistol Contract</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ACCOKEEK, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Army claims Beretta USA is not
living up to its part of what has been called ``the pistol contract
of the century,'' according to a published report.
   In a terse ``show cause'' notice Aug. 2, the Army warned it
could cancel the contract with the Italian arms maker, its sole
supplier of sidearms, because of production problems at Beretta's
southern Maryland plant, The (Baltimore) Sun reported Monday.
   ``... Since you have failed to perform under the terms of (the)
contract within the time required by its terms, the U.S. government
is considering terminating the contract ... for default,'' the
notice said.
   In June, the Army rejected a production lot of M9 9mm
semiautomatic pistols produced by the U.S. subsidiary of the
Italian arms maker Beretta, causing the company to fall behind its
production schedule, Maj. Barry Bomier, an Army spokesman, said
last week.
   As of Oct. 1, Beretta had failed to deliver a total of 8,400
guns, Bomier said. Under the terms of the contract, the company is
required to deliver 6,000 guns a month, he said.
   ``Pending a final decision in this matter, it will be necessary
to determine whether your failure to perform arose from causes
beyond your control and without fault or negligence on your part,''
the notice to the company said. ``Your failure to present any
excuses ... may be considered as an admission that none exist.''
   Bomier said the Army does not plan to cancel the contract, but
wants an explanation for the delay. A response was received from
the company, but it was unsatisfactory, he said.
   The Army decided in 1980 to replace the Colt 45 and other
handguns with a standard 9mm pistol. The award to Beretta has been
called ``the pistol contract of the century'' by some. Others,
including some members of Congress, objected to the selection of a
foreign company for the contract.
   Jeffrey Reh, Beretta's contract officer, said the Army's
show-cause notice prevented the firm from discussing contractual
issues at length.
   ``We consider the shortage to be due to relatively minor testing
difficulties,'' Reh said. ``One of them has been resolved, and
we're working to resolve the others.''
   The Army said it rejected the lot in June because of possible
defects. Reh said the rejection was precautionary.
   ``The problems weren't discovered in the field: this came up in
pre-shipment testing,'' Reh said.
   The Army, which buys the 9mm pistols for all military services,
refused a lot of 500 guns because a sample weapon was found to have
possible hairline cracks in its frame, Bomier said.
   Past problems with cracked frames forced the Army to reject a
total for 12,000 handguns from lots in December 1987 and January
1988. The previous rejections prompted the company to redesign the
M9 pistol frame.
   A more serious defect that caused four injuries last year
prompted another design modification.

   Independent broadcasters have launched a
formal assault on a Rochester, N.Y., cable television system that
is operating a broadcast-style TV station on one of its 39 channels.
   The Association of Independent Television Stations, in a 47-page
petition to the Federal Communications Commission, said Monday the
establishment of WGRC-TV, channel 5, on the Greater Rochester
Cablevision system was a threat to fair competition and the
diversity of programming for viewers.
   The association said that unlike Rochester's single independent
TV station, WUHF-TV, channel 31, the cable system could drop or
change the channel location of competing local broadcast stations,
control programming and sell and package advertising on numerous
channels, and control the type, source and channel position of
competing program services.
   Greater Rochester Cablevision, which has 163,000 subscribers, is
owned by the American Television &amp; Communications Corp., a
subsidiary of Time-Warner Inc.
   John Orr, WGRC's general manager, said he could not comment
until he had read the association's filing.
   The association said the relationship between the cable system
and Time-Warner, a major producer of cable and broadcast TV
programs, could give WGRC-TV an advantage in purchasing programs
and could allow the cable system to discriminate against
competitors.
   ``The ability the system has to exploit is position ... is of
great concern,'' the association's attorney, James Popham, told a
news conference.
   He said the Time-Warner-WGRC link, known as vertical
integration, ``per se was not a problem,'' but that the ``potential
for abuses'' was.
   James Hedlund, the association's vice president for government
relations, said there was nothing inherently bad with cable
operators programming on one channel. But it becomes a problem when
a cable system is the sole provider, in most cases, of cable
service to a community and when it can control both the delivery
and the content of its programs.
   The association said WGRC had hired former TV executives and a
sales staff at the station and is running onetime network programs,
such as ``Quincy,'' ``Knight Rider'' and ``The A-Team,'' as an
independent broadcast station would.
   The station, which began operation last month, also has
purchased ``ALF'' and ``Perfect Strangers,'' as well as first-run
syndication shows such as ``Divorce Court'' and movie packages,
according to the Sept. 18 issue of the television industry
publication Electronic Media.
   ``WGRC is sort of a next generation,'' Hedlund said. ``This is a
situation we're trying to jump on before it becomes widespread.''
   The association asked the FCC to initiate proceedings looking
towards adopting rules to ``preserve fair economic competition and
a diversity of program sources in light of the increasing
incentives for and actual occurences of anti-competitive behavior
in the cable television industry.''

<TEXT>
   The chairman and chief executive of The Ogilvy
Group, an advertising and marketing company recently acquired by
Britain's WPP Group PLC, said he had resigned to take a senior post
with American Express Co.
   Kenneth Roman, 59, said Monday he was ending a 26-year career at
Ogilvy because the job offered by American Express was ``simply too
exciting to turn down'' and because the post-buyout transition at
Ogilvy had been accomplished.
   Roman will become executive vice president corporate affairs and
communications at American Express, reporting to James D. Robinson
III, chairman and chief executive. American Express is one of
Ogilvy's clients.
   The post Roman is taking is being vacated by Harry L. Freeman,
who said in August that he planned to retire by year's end in the
wake of disclosures that an American Express investigation of
banker Edmund Safra had grown into an unauthorized campaign to
discredit Safra. Freeman was not implicated in the campaign, but he
explained in announcing his plans to retire that it occurred
because of ``mistakes made on my watch.''
   Ogilvy was acquired last summer for $864 million by WPP Group,
owner of the J. Walter Thompson advertising agency, in what ranks
as the biggest takeover in the ad business.
   Roman resisted the initial takeover offer of $45 a share, but
gave in after London-based WPP sweetened it for a second time to
$54 a share.
   In a telelphone interview Monday, Roman said he ``wasn't
looking'' for a new job when American Express' Robinson approached
him in September about Freeman's soon-to-be-vacated position.
   ``Leaving the company is a hard decision on my part,'' Roman
said. ``I have been running Ogilvy &amp; Mather for five years now, I
have just managed it through a takeover, managed it through the
transition, through a move into a new building and new headquarters
and we have just had a big worldwide management meeting where we
laid out a new corporate strategy.''
   ``Everything is in good shape, and I felt it was time for
someone to come in and carry it to the next stage,'' he said.
   Roman is not being replaced in his positions at The Ogilvy Group
because the holding company's functions have largely been taken
over by WPP.
   But he is being replaced as chairman and chief executive of
Ogilvy &amp; Mather Worldwide, Ogilvy's largest advertising company.
   Graham Phillips, 50, was named chairman and chief executive of
Ogilvy &amp; Mather Worldwide. He has been with Ogilvy &amp; Mather U.S.
since 1965, helped found the agency's Houston office in 1970 and
has run offices in Amsterdam, Toronto and New York City. He has
been chairman of Ogilvy &amp; Mather U.S. since 1985 and president of
Ogilvy &amp; Mather North America since 1987.
   Roman said Phillips was ``the logical and appropriate choice''
to succeed him.
   Alexander Brody, 56, was named to the newly-created position of
president of Ogilvy &amp; Mather Worldwide and chief executive of its
international operations.
   Brody joined Ogilvy &amp; Mather Worldwide as
president-international in 1987 and previously headed DYR
Worldwide, a global advertising agency network that is a joint
venture of New York's Young &amp; Rubicam Inc. and Dentsu Inc. of Japan.

<HEAD>To Rename Broker-Dealer Subsidiary To Prevent Sales Force Exodus</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The struggling investment firm Integrated
Resources Inc. says it will transfer its main broker-dealer
subsidiary to two executives and change the division's name in an
attempt to stanch a sales force exodus.
   Integrated, which has $1.75 billion in debt, said Monday that
Integrated Resources Equity Corp. would be renamed Royal Alliance
Associates Inc. and its stock transferred to Integrated executives
Gerard M. Lavin and Gary W. Krat.
   The change is directed at retaining credibility for Integrated's
3,900 registered broker-dealers who sell products ranging from
mutual funds to investment partnerships to stocks and bonds, Krat
said in an interview.
   ``Right now now it's fair to say if you're affiliated with the
name Integrated Resources you have a problem,'' he said.
   Integrated in June defaulted on nearly $1 billion of its total
debt of about $1.75 billion. Since then the New York-based company
has sought to sell its key financial assets, including IREC, in an
attempt to raise money to pay what it owes.
   The sales force has shrunk from about 4,600 in June, when
Integrated's financial troubles became public, and the company
wanted to prevent further defections.
   ``There has been a substantial decline over these many months in
the amount of Integrated product sales they've been making as there
has been growing resistance to the Integrated name,'' Krat said,
but did not specify the decline.
   While the sales force still would sell Integrated products, Krat
said broker-dealers under a new name ``don't have that first hurdle
to overcome.''
   Under the agreement, IREC sales personnel, who are independent
contractors licensed with the subsidiary, would be offered the
opportunity to be licensed with the new broker-dealer.
   Lavin and Krat were the principal managers of the subsidiary,
based in Englewood, Colo., and New York. Krat said the deal, which
requires the approval of Integrated's board, should be completed by
year's end.
   IREC was the company's key financial subsidiary, but it's paper
worth was minimal because the sales force was independent. The
company said it would retain the right to repurchase the stock of
Royal Alliance if it arranges a sale of the subsidiary.
   In addition to IREC, Integrated wants to sell Resources Trust
Co.; Integrated Resources Asset Management Corp., an investment
adviser; and two of its life insurance companies, Integrated
Resources Life Insurance Co. of Des Moines, Iowa, and Capitol Life
Insurance Co. of Denver.
   Integrated has not paid any principle or interest to bondholders
since June. The company's woes stem from difficulties diversifying
out of real estate into financial services.

   General Motors Corp., in a cost-cutting move, may
look overseas to find companies to produce GM-sponsored television
shows that would air in the United States.
   The company plans to decide in four weeks whether to pursue the

bill for last year at $443.4 million.

automaker has no such program in place or under consideration.
Chrysler Corp. spokesmen did not return a reporter's telephone call

<HEAD>GM Using Holograms in Battle Against Counterfeit Parts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp. has copied a technique used
by credit card companies in the automaker's battle to keep
counterfeit parts out of the market.
   GM is stamping holograms, which are made by laser beams, on
packages of brake pads and electronic ignitions for export. The
difficult-to-duplicate etchings have the superimposed words
``General Motors,'' ``GM'' and ``Genuine'' in a small rectangle on
the outside of the package.
   GM, Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. have spent millions of
dollars during the past several years to find and eliminate
counterfeit parts makers.
   ``Some of these (fake) packages are so good that even we can't
tell if they're counterfeit,'' said Dan Elliott, director of GM
security.
   Besides draining an automaker's balance sheet, a counterfeit
part may not have the same quality as the real thing, and that can
lead to unanticipated problems, including lawsuits.
   For example, a Massachusetts school district sued GM after
transmissions in its buses failed. The district bought what it
thought was GM transmission fluid which, it contended, led to the
failures.
   Tests showed the fluid was a mixture of cheap oil and red dye,
and the automaker was dropped from the suit. The fluid maker's
operations were raided by federal marshals.
   Elliott declined to say how much GM has lost because of
counterfeit parts, but said that the Mideast had the largest
concentration of bogus parts. There, he estimated, about 40 percent
of all parts labeled as GM actually are fakes.
   Ford and Chrysler officials also declined to say how much their
companies may have lost to parts counterfeiters, but said raids at
warehouses have turned up millions of dollars worth of fake
components.
   Many of the fake parts are made and marketed overseas. Chrysler
has less of a problem since its parts are available only through
the company's dealerships.

   UAL Corp.'s board of directors has decided to
keep the parent company of United Airlines independent for now as
it examines alternatives to a $6.75 billion buyout that collapsed
earlier this month.
   The $300-a-share bid from United's management, pilots and
British Airways PLC couldn't generate enough bank financing, and
its failure helped trigger a Friday the 13th plunge in the stock
market.
   Last week UAL's stock lost $111.25 a share. It closed up $10 a
share on Monday at $178.37{ on the New York Stock Exchange.
   UAL's opening was delayed today due to an order imbalance, with
indications that it could open anywhere from $143 to $153 a share.
   The board's announcement Monday was vaguely and carefully
worded, leaving UAL's precise plans unclear. It said it considered
the failed bid's price of $300 a share to be ``an attractive
offer'' and ``in the best interests of shareholders.''
   ``Consistent with the effort to maximize shareholder value, the
board will continue to explore all strategic and financial
alternatives available to the company,'' the UAL statement said.
   But it did not mention any specific alternatives, including an
informal proposal from UAL's management and pilots unit reportedly
valued at between $225 and $240 a share, or as much as $5.42
billion.
   United's pilots said they were disappointed with UAL's failure
to continue negotiating a possible takeover of the airline.
   Frederick C. Dubinsky, head of the pilots' group, said the union
``was prepared to work with the board to shape a transaction that
would provide UAL stockholders with value significantly in excess
of the current market price of UAL stock.''
   Analysts had linked the surge in UAL's stock Monday to a Wall
Street Journal report saying the labor-managment group was
considering a revised offer that would give employees a majority
stake in the company and leave some stock in public hands.
   But a separate statement from UAL Chairman Stephen Wolf on
Monday indicated an acquisition effort was over.
   Wolf said the cooperative buyout effort had helped management
and the pilots to forge a ``substantially improved working
relationship.'' He said he ``hopes that all 70,000 United employees
can now turn their full attention to operating the best airline in
the world.''
   Stephen Dexter, an analyst with Kemper Financial Services Inc.
in Chicago, said Wolf's statement indicates UAL's board wants
management to return its attention to running United Airlines.
   ``What this kind of does, it gives them a little breathing
room,'' Dexter said.

   The stock market retreated again early today
amid concerns about sluggish corporate profits and the collapse of
the UAL Corp. buyout.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 20.29 points to
2,642.62 in the first half-hour of trading.
   Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones more than 2 to 1 on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 316 higher, 651 lower and 507
unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 27.92 million shares as of 10
a.m. EDT.
   The government's report of a slight decline in factory orders
did nothing to dispel concerns that corporate profits for the third
quarter were lower than expected.
   Orders for ``big ticket'' durable goods, held back by slumping
demand in the transportation category, slipped 0.1 percent in
September, the Commerce Department reported.
   Analysts said that both the August and September orders reports
were skewed by a big swing in demand for automobiles, which had
surged in August only to drop back to a more normal level in
September.
   UAL's opening on the NYSE was delayed due to an excess of sell
orders over buy orders, with indications that it could open 20 to
30 a share below Monday's close of 178].
   UAL's board of directors said late Monday it has decided to keep
the parent company of United Airlines independent for now as it
examines alternatives to a $300-a-share buyout plan that collapsed
earlier this month.
   Among other active issues in early trading on the NYSE were
Phillips Petroleum, down { at 22|; McDonald's, down ] at 31, and
Philip Morris, down [ at 43}.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks was
off 1.08 points at 189.82. On the American Stock Exchange the
market index was down 0.93 at 378.53.
   On Monday the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 26.23 points
to 2,662.91.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by nearly 2 to 1 on the
NYSE, with 503 up, 985 down and 470 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 135.86 million shares, against 164.83
million in the previous session.

<HEAD>Prime Says It Will Lay Off 2,500</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALLISON J. PUGH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Computer Inc. will lay off 2,500 employees,
nearly 20 percent of its work force, as part of a restructuring
after its billion-dollar buyout by J.H. Whitney &amp; Co., the company
said.
   The layoffs announced Monday will be spread over several months
and will mostly affect Prime's employees in the United States.
   The minicomputer company, which is based in Natick, will be
divided into four departments designed to focus on particular
customer services, said Prime spokesman Joe Gavaghan. More money
will be spent on those that do well.
   ``If there is a product for which there is not a strong market,
the spending on those products will be reduced or eliminated,''
Gavaghan said.
   The company's new strategy was part of a plan to reduce the $1
billion debt it took on after Whitney, a New York investment firm,
bought the company in August and ended Prime's 10-month battle
against hostile bidder MAI Basic Four Inc. of Tustin, Calif.
   Whitney paid $20 a share for 49.5 million Prime shares and
exchange notes with a face value of $22 per share for the remaining
21 percent of Prime's shares.
   Much of the deal, which analysts estimated was worth between
$1.06 billion and $1.16 billion, was financed by debt, said
Gavaghan.
   Gavaghan said the exact figure for Prime's debt would not be
available until a special board meeting, when the final details of
the Whitney merger were to be completed. The meeting has not yet
been scheduled, he said.
   Officials at Prime, which also announced Monday the introduction
of two new software products for computer-aided design, declined to
offer projections for Prime's revenue for the past year.
   The firm, whose revenue comes about equally from its ventures in
minicomputers, computer-aided design systems and customer service,
did not issue a third-quarter report.
   The company turned a profit of $19 million on sales of $1.6
billion in 1988. That year the firm posted a one-time loss of $58
million based on costs involved in a merger with Computervision
Corp., said Gavaghan.
   The cost of defending against MAI Basic Four and slow sales of
minicomputers led to losses of $14.4 million in the final quarter
of 1988, $5 million in the first quarter of 1989 and $19 million in
the second quarter.
   Prime said it has established a career counseling and training
center at its Natick headquarters to help those employees let go.

<HEAD>Bond Corp. Says Debt Totals 6.9 Billion Australian Dollars</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bond Corp. Holdings Ltd.'s debt
totals 6.9 billion Australian dollars, with rising Australian
interest rates and the Bell Group Ltd. acquisition the chief
causes, Chairman Alan Bond disclosed Tuesday.
   The disclosure followed Friday's news that Bond Corp. had
incurred the largest annual loss in Australian corporate history.
   In its fiscal year ended June 30, Bond Corp. lost 980.2 million
Australian dollars, the equivalent of about $762.4 million. Much of
the loss was due to one-time write-downs of the value of some of
Bond Corp.'s assets.
   Alan Bond, chairman and controlling shareholder of the
cash-strapped Australian media, brewing, natural resources and
property concern, provided the debt figures at a business gathering.
   He said the debt load would have been heavier if not for a
reduction of 5 billion Australian dollars over the past year from
asset sales. Bond indicated that detailed debt numbers, which would
include liabilities of units such as the Bell Group, would be
published soon in Bond Corp.'s annual report.
   Bond predicted that the debt would be lightened by an additional
3.8 billion Australian dollars this year, ending June 30, 1990, but
he didn't explain how the reduction would be achieved.
   Rising Australian interest rates and the acquisition of Bell
Group ``with its very high levels of short-term debt'' were blamed
by Bond for creating a condition ``that was no longer sustainable.''
   ``In order to restore confidence and ensure the support of our
principal lenders, we embarked on fundamental changes in the
structure and direction of the group,'' Bond said.
   That realignment resulted in continuing asset sales, as well as
write-offs exceeding 1.1 billon Australian dollars in the past
financial year. ``In essence we have made a decision to clear the
decks,'' Bond told the meeting.
   While some assets have been written down, others are undervalued
on Bond Corp.'s books, Bond maintained.
   Among the undervalued holdings are the company's Australian
brewing assets, which Bond said are actually worth 2.5 billion
Australian dollars while being on the books as being worth 950
million Australian dollars.
   An investment in Chile's telephone company is carried at $300
million, but really should be valued at $500 million, according to
Bond. Also, the company's property portfolio is undervalued by at
least 250 million Australian dollars, he said.
   Bond forecast that by next June, ``What will emerge will be a
company with a honed sense of purpose ... a stable balance sheet,
with good quality assets in brewing, telecommunications, media and
property.''
   He didn't mention energy resources on that list, possibly
signalling that all the company's coal and oil interests might be
for sale. Some oil holdings already have been sold.
   Bond Corp.'s annual loss compared with a profit of 273.5 million
Australian dollars a year earlier.
   Operating revenue in fiscal 1989 rose 69 percent to 8.48 billion
Australian dollars from 5.01 billion Australian dollars. But
after-tax interest costs jumped 85 percent to 686.7 million
Australian dollars from 371.1 million Australian dollars.
   In commenting last week on its results, Bond Corp. said the
financial performance of its U.S. brewing operations, G. Heileman
Brewing Co., was ``disappointing, and this has been reflected in
the results.''

<HEAD>Market Plunge Triggers Merc Circuit Breaker</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A plunge in stock prices this morning sent S&amp;P
500 stock-index futures down the 12-point limit permitted under
``circuit-breaker'' rules designed to slow a market collapse.
   Trading halted momentarily, then prices began climbing again,
said Merc spokeswoman Julie Jacobs.
   The contract for December delivery of stocks tracked by the
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index fell to 335.95 on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange at about 9:30 a.m. CDT, Ms. Jacobs said. The
contract is valued at $500 a point.
   The 12-point drop tripped a circuit-breaker rule prohibiting
selling at prices below that level for 30 minutes.
   The decline occurred as the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials
on the New York Stock Exchange tumbled more than 80 points before
recovering some lost ground.
   The decline in part was a reaction to news that UAL Corp.'s
board of directors had decided Monday to keep the parent company of
United Airlines independent for now as it examines alternatives to
a $300-a-share buyout plan that collapsed earlier this month.
   The Merc circuit-breaker, implemented after the 1987 market
crash, also kicked in on Oct. 13, when the market sold off sharply
after financing for the UAL deal fell through.

   Stock prices declined broadly in heavy trading
this morning before regaining some lost ground amid concerns about
the collapse of the UAL Corp. buyout.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was down 32.38 points to
2,630.53 in the first 90 minutes of trading. The Dow had fallen as
much as 85 points in early trading before rebounding.
   Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones by more than 8 to 1
on the New York Stock Exchange, with 149 higher, 1,253 lower and
327 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 100.98 million shares as of 11
a.m. EDT.
   ``UAL revisted,'' said Alan Ackerman, senior vice president at
Gruntal &amp; Co. ``The failure of UAL to continue moving forward on
the buyout has raised havoc with the transportation sector.''
   UAL's board of directors said late Monday it has decided to keep
the parent company of United Airlines independent for now as it
examines alternatives to a $300-a-share employee-management buyout
plan that collapsed earlier this month.
   The announcement that the group was unable to get financing for
the deal helped trigger a 190.58-point drop in the Dow industrials
on Oct. 13. The market bounced back last week, gaining a record
119.88 points total, but the Dow average slipped back by 26.23 on
Monday.
   UAL plunged 30] to 148 in early trading. The stock's opening on
the NYSE was delayed due to an excess of sell orders over buy
orders.
   Analysts said the news that UAL would remain independent
affected other transportation stocks and generally triggered the
morning selloff. Computerized program trading also contributed to
the decline.
   In Chicago, the plunge in stock prices sent S&amp;P 500 stock-index
futures down the 12-point limit permitted under ``circuit-breaker''
rules designed to slow heavy market selloffs. Index futures prices
rebounded after trading resumed.
   The government's report today of a slight decline in durable
goods orders during September today did nothing to dispel concerns
over lower-than-expected corporate profits for the third quarter.
   Orders for ``big ticket'' durable goods, held back by slumping

<HEAD>Euro-Disney Shares Rocket in Official Gray Market Trading</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shares in Europe's Disney theme park rocketed 18
percent higher on Tuesday when London's Stock Exchange allowed gray
market trading to begin officially because of heavy interest in the
new issue.
   The shares were quoted at the equivalent of $13.36, up $2.05
from the offer price of $11.31. They were up $2.88 at one point as
investors scrambled to take a stake in the theme park to be built
in France.
   Demand for the shares outstripped supply almost five times when
applications closed on Friday and a ballot was being held to divide
the allocation, the investment firm Warburg Securities said.
   Gray market trading, which takes place among investors before
full trading begins through the stock exchange, is the trading of
promises to buy and sell shares once full trading starts.
   The market is called gray because the activity is not illegal as
in a black market, yet it is not full trading, either.
   The sale of Euro Disneyland shares in Britain was part of a
public offering across Europe. Euro Disneyland SCA, the French
company building the park, is selling 85.9 million shares for about
$1 billion in the 12 Common Market countries to help finance the
$7.5 billion project.
   Euro Disneyland shares were scheduled to start trading
officially in London, Paris and Brussels from Nov. 6.
   A gray market in Euro Disneyland shares has existed in Paris
since the offer price was declared on Oct. 5.
   On Monday, London's Stock Exchange announced that instead of
allowing an unofficial gray market to develop in Britain it would
create its own, and gave several market making firms permission to
trade Euro Disneyland shares.

<DATELINE>ARLINGTON, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   USAir Group Inc., the holding company for
the nation's seventh-largest airline, reported a net loss of $77.7
million for the third quarter, which it attributed to flat demand
and higher operating expenses.
   USAir said Tuesday it lost $77.7 million, or $1.86 a share, in
the three months ended Sept. 30, compared with a net profit of
$68.5 million, or $1.58 a share, in the third quarter of 1988.
   Third-quarter revenue was unchanged at $1.5 billion.
   ``Domestic airline industry traffic growth was flat during 1989
compared to 1988, and domestic industry revenue per passenger mile
for the third quarter of 1989 was only 1.4 percent above the
comparable period in 1988,'' said USAir Chairman and President
Edwin I. Colodny.
   Earnings also were affected by the airline's Kids Fly Free
program, lower fares in California and frequent flir awards,
Colodny said.
   The company, which absorbed Piedmont Aviation into its system in
early August, also reported higher labor and fuel costs as well as
one-time costs stemming from the merger.
   The effects of Hurricane Hugo, which disrupted USAir's major hub
at Charlotte, N.C., and other southeastern cities, cannot be
quantified, the company said.
   However, it said, the effects of Hugo and the recent California
earthquake, combined with recent trends ``are expected to cause
operating results for the fourth quarter and for 1989 to be
significantly lower than those of the comparable 1988 periods.''
   For the first nine months of 1989, USAir reported net income of
$38.5 million, or 76 cents a share, on revenue of $4.8 billion.
That compares with net income of $142.2 million, or $3.28 a share,
on revenue of $4.2 billion for the same period last year.

   Ingersoll Publications Co. says it has
agreed to buy the New Haven (Conn.) Register from Goodson
Newspapers for $250 million and will terminate contracts to manage
the rest of Goodson's 66 newspapers.
   The sale of the Register, which Ingersoll announced Monday, was
expected to be finalized by Dec. 1.
   Ralph Ingersoll II, whose company owns more than 200 newspapers
and also managed Goodson's papers, acquired the Register on behalf
of Goodson from the Jackson family for $185 million in 1986.
   The Register has a daily circulation of 107,000 and a Sunday
circulation of 142,000.
   Thomas P. Geyer, the Register's chief executive officer, said
Monday that since the 1986 sale Ingersoll had been expected
eventually to acquire the Register from Goodson.
   ``Nothing at the Register will change as a result of this,''
Geyer said.
   Ingersoll also is terminating its management of Goodson
newspapers. Goodson's weekly and daily newspapers are in six states
and including the Register had total revenue of $225 million in
1988.
   Robert M. Jelenic, president of Princeton-based Ingersoll
Publications, said, ``We'll now be able to concentrate all the
energies of our extraordinary operating team on creating more value
for the communities served by our own newspapers.''
   Mark Goodson, chairman of New York-based Goodson Newspapers said
he had set up a management team that would be responsible solely
for operating the Goodson newspapers.
   The Ingersoll group includes the recently launched St. Louis
Sun; the Trentonian in Trenton; the Birmingham Post and Mail in
England; 28 other dailies; and more than 200 non-daily papers in
the United States and Europe. The newspapers have combined annual
revenue of more than $750 million.

<HEAD>Xerox Net Income Up 6 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Xerox Corp. on Monday reported
third-quarter net income of $155 million, up 6 percent from $146
million in the same quarter last year.
   Earnings per share for the quarter ended Sept. 30 were $1.41,
vs. $1.37 for the same period a year ago. Combined revenues totaled
$4.4 billion, an increase of 7 percent from $4.1 billion in the
third quarter of 1988.
   Xerox reported increases in net income in both financial
services and business products and systems.
   Net income for financial services increased by 1 percent, with
growth in financing operations and strong capital gains offsetting
the cost of strengthening reserves and the impact of Hurricane
Hugo, said David T. Kearns, chairman and chief executive officer.
   Net income for business products and systems was $77 million, up
13 percent from $68 million in the third quarter a year ago.
   Xerox President Paul A. Allaire said a restructuring program
announced in January, as well as continuing cost controls, allowed
the company to increase profits for business products despite a
softer demand for goods and adverse currency effects from selling
overseas.
   Net income for the first nine months was $492 million, or $4.55
per share, up 6 percent from $465 million last year, or $4.32 per
share. Total revenues for the nine-month period were $13 billion,
up 8 percent from $12 billion for the first nine months of 1988.

<HEAD>Control Data Reports Third-Quarter Earnings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BLOOMINGTON, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Control Data Corp. on Tuesday credited
extensive restructuring earlier in the year for a third-quarter
profit of $9.8 million, which contrasted with a $2.4 million loss
in the same period a year earlier.
   The computer company also reported earnings per share of 23
cents for the 1989 third quarter ended Sept. 30, compared with a
loss per share of 6 cents for the same quarter a year ago.
   Revenues of $763 million for the 1989 quarter were down 9
percent from $841.4 million a year ago.
   Control Data said the quarterly results were helped by the sale
of Imprimis, the disk drive subsidiary, to Seagate Technology.
Pre-tax earnings of $16.2 million include an $8.5 million gain from
restructuring, which was made up of a $33.7 million gain from asset
sales, including Imprimis, offset by charges of $25.2 million.
   For the first nine months of this year, the company reported a
loss of $484 million, or a per-share loss of $11.51, compared with
earnings of $14.5 million, or 34 cents a share, for the 1988
period. Revenues were $2.41 billion, compared with $2.7 billion a
year ago.
   The company lost $497.3 million in the second quarter, mainly as
a result of shutting down the ETA Systems supercomputer subsidiary
and cutting 3,100 jobs. Closing the St. Paul, Minn.-based ETA cost
Control Data around $335 million. The balance of the charges came
from shrinking the Cyber mainframe division, paying severance to
cover corporate staff layoffs and the company's departure from the
training and education business.
   ``The improved results the company achieved in the third quarter
are gratifying and stems from the actions taken during the past
several months,'' said Robert M. Price, chairman and chief
executive officer.
   ``While the results represent only a modest return to positive
momentum, the company can now build on that momentum.''
   Every business group except the semiconductor subsidiary was
profitable before interest and taxes in the third quarter, the
company said.

<TEXT>
   Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. reported Tuesday
that its third-quarter profit rose 11 percent over a year ago due
to improved tire sales.
   Net income for the three months ended Sept. 30 totaled $70.5
million, or $1.22 a share, compared with earnings of $63.5 million,
$1.11 per share, in the 1988 quarter. Sales rose to $2.68 billion
from $2.66 billion.
   ``Our third quarter reflects an improvement in the U.S. tire
business from the disappointing year-earlier period,'' Goodyear
Chairman Tom Barrett said in a statement.
   Goodyear said earnings in the latest quarter were held down by
higher taxes on foreign earnings.
   For the first nine months of 1989, Goodyear earned $192.1
million, or $3.33 per share, after accounting for a second-quarter
$95 million loss from sales of the company's South Africa
subsidiary and an unused pipe held by Goodyear's All Amrican
Pipeline subsidiary. Sales were $8.1 billion.
   That compared with earnings of $293.7 million, or $5.13 a share,
for the first three quarters of 1988. Sales were just under $8
billion.

<HEAD>Texaco's Profit Rose 11 Percent In Third Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Texaco Inc. said today its earnings rose 11
percent in the third quarter, helped by substantially higher
results in the company's exploration and production business.
   For the three months ended Sept. 30, Texaco earned $305 million,
or $1.10 a share, compared with $274 million, or $1.12 a share, a
year earlier.
   Revenue dipped 4 percent to $8.36 billion from $8.68 billion,
the result of the company's recent asset restructuring,
   Texaco said the lower per-share earnings in the third quarter
reflected a higher number of outstanding shares of common stock as
well as a new preferred stock for which the company must set aside
reserves.
   In the first nine months, Texaco's earnings more than doubled to
$2.13 billion, or $8.19 a share, from $1.01 billion, or $4.14, a
share, in the comparable 1988 period.
   Revenue was down slightly at $26.42 billion from $26.67 billion.
   Nine-month earnings benefited from a gain of $1.2 billion, or
$4.87 a share, from the sale of Texaco Canada Inc. in the first
quarter. The sale was part of a massive restructuring involving the
sale of some $7 billion in assets.
   Texaco completed the asset-sale portion of the restructuring
earlier this year, nearly a year after emerging from bankruptcy
protection. Texaco had filed for protection from its creditors
under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy laws in April 1987 to
avoid having to post a potentially damaging multibillion-dollar
security bond in its fight with Pennzoil Co.
   Pennzoil had sued claiming Texaco's 1984 acquisition of Getty
Oil Co. interfered with Pennzoil's prior contract to buy part of
Getty. A Houston jury awarded Pennzoil a $10.3 billion judgment.
Texaco appealed but eventually settled with Pennzoil for $3 billion.
   Texaco last week announced its first major acquisition since the
restructuring _ a $476.5 million purchase of Tana Production Corp.,
the Corpus Christi-Texas-based subsidiary of TRT Energy Holdings
Inc. with large natural gas and oil properties.
   James W. Kinnear, president of the nation's third-largest oil
concern behind Exxon Corp. and Mobil Corp., said Texaco in the
third period completed the distribution to shareholders of a
portion of the proceeds from the restructuring.
   It also initiated a stock buyback plan under which the company
proposes to repurchase, ``subject to market conditions,'' $500
million of its common stock by August 1990. Texaco also retired
approximately $1 billion of debt, Kinnear said.
   Higher crude oil prices during the third period boosted Texaco's
exploration and production earnings substantially from $68 million
in the 1988 period to $185 million in the latest quarter.
   The company's chemical's business also showed strong gains _ $68
million vs. $45 million a year earlier.
   Lower gasoline prices and higher crude costs, however, hurt
Texaco's refining and marketing business during the period.
Earnings in that sector were cut in half to $180 million from $373
million in the third quarter of 1988.

   Tenneco Inc. said its third-quarter profit soared
more than tenfold from a year ago.
   For the three months ended Sept. 30, Tenneco earned $90 million,
or 68 cents per share, on revenue of $3.2 billion. That compared
with a profit of of $7 million, or 2 cents per share, and $3
billion in revenue in 1988.
   Tenneco Chairman James L. Ketelson said the gain came because of
strong results in the agricultural and construction equipment units
and improvements in the natural gas pipeline business.
   For the first nine months of 1989, the company had earnings of
$379 million, or $2.88 per share, compared with earnings of $224
million, or $1.39 a share, the same time last year.
   Revenue rose to $10.19 billion from $9.63 billion.
   The company's natural gas pipeline division had an operating
income of $56 million for the third quarter, compared to $45
million in 1988, while the J I Case division had an operating
income of $46 million vs. a $20 million loss in 1988.
   Tenneco Automotive recorded income of $69 million for the
quarter, up $10 million from 1988, and Newport News Shipbuilding
had an income of $37 million for the quarter, down from the $43
million posted last year.
   The company's Packaging Corp. of America reported income of $44
million, compared to $60 million for the corresponding 1988 period
and Albright &amp; Wilson and Tenneco Minerals recorded an operating
income of $20 million for the quarter, down $1 million for the same
period in 1988.

<HEAD>Eds: UPDATES throughout with Ford saying it is prepared to bid for

<TEXT>
   Ford Motor Co. might try to buy Jaguar PLC
outright when British government restrictions on investors' shares
in the luxury automaker expire at the end of 1990, the U.S.
automaker said Tuesday.
   Meanwhile, Jaguar said Ford was continuing to build its stake in
the British luxury carmaker and had boosted its holdings to 12
percent from 10.4 percent.
   Ford filed documents Monday with the Securities and Exchange
Commission declaring that it might bid for all of Jaguar,
spokeswoman Lin Cummins said.
   Whether a bid would in fact be made was not immediately known.
``It isn't saying we will do it, and it isn't saying we won't,''
Cummins said.
   Under British regulations, no investor can acquire more than 15
percent of Jaguar until the end of 1990. The British government
imposed that restriction when it privatized Jaguar in 1984.
   SEC regulations require a company to state its intentions when
it acquires 5 percent or more of another company, and that led to
Monday's filing by Ford, Cummins said.
   Jaguar has said it wants to remain independent.
   The latest stock purchase coincided with talks between Jaguar
and General Motors Corp. on an operating agreement that is expected
to include a commitment from GM to take a small equity stake in
Jaguar.
   Jaguar said Ford owned 21.9 million Jaguar shares by the close
of trading Friday. Ford reported holding 19.0 million shares Oct.
17.
   Ford said on Sept. 19 it planned to buy up to 15 percent of
Jaguar and has bought Jaguar shares steadily in the open market
since receiving U.S. regulatory approval earlier this month.
   Ford notified Jaguar of its SEC filing Monday by telephone but
has not met with Jaguar officials, Cummins said. ``We are amenable
to discuss the issue with them, but no new meetings have been
scheduled.''
   She said the company would not comment on GM's talks with Jaguar.

<HEAD>Fund Manager Sues Shearson for $60 Million in Alleged Post-Crash
Fraud</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An international money manager has sued Shearson
Lehman Hutton Inc. for allegedly cheating a mutual fund out of $60
million by manipulating futures prices shortly after the 1987 stock
market crash.
   The complaint, filed in U.S. District Court on behalf of Quantum
B.V.I. mutual fund, alleges that Shearson traders and brokers
conspired to depress the price of the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index
contract at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   The alleged misconduct occurred Oct. 22, 1987, three days after
the market plunge and moments after Quantum entered a large S&amp;P
sell order through Shearson, Quantum said in the lawsuit.
   The $2.1 billion fund is headed by international money manager
George Soros, whose large sell order sent the futures market
plunging 24 percent in minutes.
   The lawsuit charges that Shearson, three of its floor brokers
and about 100 other traders and brokers conspired to sell 2,400 S&amp;P
500 futures held by Quantum at artificially low prices.
   According to the complaint, traders waited to buy the contracts
until after futures price had plunged because of the sell order,
and Quantum lost more than $60 million.
   When the market later rebounded, the defendants made a profit by
selling the contracts they had bought at depressed prices, Quantum
charged.
   A Shearson spokesman said Monday: ``We have reviewed the
complaint and do not believe that there is any merit to the
allegations, and we do intend to contest the suit.
   A lawyer for Soros said the lawsuit was filed late Friday to
avoid a two-year statute of limitations on such claims under the
Commodity Exchange Act.
   Also named as defendants are Larry Israel, Michael Mullins and
Douglas Young, who were Shearson floor brokers in the S&amp;P 500 pit
at the time of the trading.
   In addition to the $60 million in alleged losses, the suit seeks
$100 million in punitive damages.

   Stock prices declined broadly in heavy trading
today as the collapse of the UAL Corp. buyout helped unnerve an
already shaky market.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials spiked downward as much
as 85 points in the morning before partially rebounding. It was
down 48.36 points to 2,614.55 by 2 p.m. EDT.
   In addition to the UAL buyout failure, analysts said traders
were worried about lower-than-expected corporate profits in the
third quarter and signs of economic weakness in the government's
latest report on factory orders.
   ``Volatility rules the day,'' said Barton Biggs, chief
investment strategist at Morgan Stanley &amp; Co.
   ``I think we're going to see a lot of this skittishness until we
sort out the leadership in this market,'' said Peter Barry,
director of research at Fahnestock &amp; Co.
   Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones by 11 to 2 on the
New York Stock Exchange, with 246 higher, 1,348 lower and 313
unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 164.94 million shares as of 2
p.m. on Wall Street.
   UAL plunged 32| to 145} by 2 p.m. UAL's board of directors said
late Monday it has decided to keep the parent company of United
Airlines independent for now as it examines alternatives to a
$300-a-share employee-management buyout plan that collapsed earlier
this month.
   The announcement that the UAL group was unable to get financing
for the deal helped trigger a 190.58-point drop in the Dow
industrials on Oct. 13. The market bounced back last week, gaining
a record 119.88 points total, but the Dow average slipped back by
26.23 on Monday.
   Analysts said the news that UAL would remain independent
affected other transportation stocks and generally triggered the
morning selloff. Computerized program trading also contributed to
the decline.
   In Chicago, the plunge in stock prices sent S&amp;P 500 stock-index
futures down the 12-point limit permitted under ``circuit-breaker''
rules designed to slow heavy market selloffs. Index futures prices
rebounded after trading resumed.
   The government's report today of a slight decline in durable
goods orders during September today did nothing to dispel concerns
over lower-than-expected corporate profits for the third quarter.
   Orders for ``big ticket'' durable goods, held back by slumping
demand in the transportation category, slipped 0.1 percent in
September, the Commerce Department reported.
   Analysts said the August and September orders reports were
skewed by a big swing in demand for automobiles, which surged in
August only to drop back to a more normal level in September.
   Treasury bond prices rallied, following a recent pattern of
showing strength when stocks weaken. The benchmark 30-year bond was
up nearly } point at midday, equal to $7.50 per $1,000 in face
value.
   Airline stocks were down. AMR was off 4[ at 66{, Delta down 1}
at 65} and Pan Am was off [ at 3{.
   Among other active issues in early trading on the NYSE were
Phillips Petroleum, down ] at 22}; AT&amp;T, down ~ at 42[; Chevron,

   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks was

market index was down 4.44 at 375.02.

<HEAD>Jury Selection Begins in Third Round of Stock Manipulation Trial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After two mistrials earlier this year, jury
selection began Tuesday in the retrial of GAF Corp. and its vice
chairman on stock manipulation charges.
   The case initially attracted wide attention because as the first
criminal trial stemming from the insider trading scandals of the
mid-1980s. It also was seen as a test of information derived
indirectly from jailed stock speculator Ivan Boesky.
   The most recent mistrial occurred March 23 when a jury announced
after 12 days of deliberations that it was hopelessly deadlocked.
   U.S. District Judge Mary Johnson Lowe declared the first
mistrial in January after determining that prosecutors had
unintentionally withheld an expert's report that a key piece of
evidence had been altered.
   Lowe began jury selection for the third trial by explaining the
charges against GAF, two subsidiaries, and GAF Vice Chairman James
T. Sherwin.
   The defendants were indicted in July 1988 for allegedly trying
to boost Union Carbide Corp.'s stock price in 1986 shortly before
selling a large block of Carbide shares. They were charged with
securities fraud, wire fraud and conspiracy.
   GAF, a Wayne, N.J.-based chemical and building materials
manufacturer, and its two subsidiaries face maximum fines totaling
$12 million, or $500,000 on each of eight counts against each of
the three. Sherwin faces 40 years in prison and a fine of up to $2
million.
   The prosecution's main witness against GAF has been Los Angeles
stockbroker Boyd L. Jefferies, who pleaded guilty to two felony
counts of breaking securities laws in 1987 and began cooperating
with the government.
   Jefferies was sentenced July 6 to five years probation and fined
$250,000.

   Share prices closed sharply lower Tuesday on the
London Stock Exchange in a reflection of Wall Street's steep drop.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index shed 40.4
points, or 1.85 percent, to finish at 2,149.3.
   It closed above the session low of 2,147.0, which was posted
when the Dow Jones industrial average skidded 85 points within
minutes late in London trading. At London's close, the Dow Jones
average was 51.23 points lower at 2,611.68.
   The key London index began its downward course after it
registered a session high of 2,197.0 two hours into official
trading.
   Volume was a modest 405.4 million shares, up from 276.8 million
on Monday, which had been a record low.
   Dealers in London said the initial downward pressure came from
mildly disappointing British trade figures for September and a
worrisome report by the Confederation of British Industry that a
decline in orders for manufactured goods was depressing business
optimism and investment plans for the coming year.
   The trade and CBI reports refocused attention on Britain's high
interest rates and helped fuel concerns over prospects for a
recession, dealers said.
   The Financial Times 30-share index fell 33.3 points to close at
1,739.3. The Financial Times 500-share index lost 21.71 points to
close at 1,193.91.

   Volume on the Big Board came to 192.54 million shares as of 3
p.m. on Wall Street.
   UAL plunged 23] to 155 by 3 p.m. after having been down down
more than 32 earlier in the day. UAL's board of directors said late
Monday it has decided to keep the parent company of United Airlines
independent for now as it examines alternatives to a $300-a-share
employee-management buyout plan that collapsed earlier this month.
   The announcement that the UAL group was unable to get financing
for the deal helped trigger a 190.58-point drop in the Dow
industrials on Oct. 13. The market bounced back last week, gaining
a record 119.88 points total, but the Dow average slipped back by
26.23 on Monday.
   Analysts said the news that UAL would remain independent
affected other transportation stocks and generally triggered the
morning selloff. Computerized program trading also contributed to
the decline.
   In Chicago, the plunge in stock prices sent S&amp;P 500 stock-index
futures down the 12-point limit permitted under ``circuit-breaker''
rules designed to slow heavy market selloffs. Index futures prices
rebounded after trading resumed.
   The government's report today of a slight decline in durable
goods orders during September today did nothing to dispel concerns
over lower-than-expected corporate profits for the third quarter.
   Orders for ``big ticket'' durable goods, held back by slumping
demand in the transportation category, slipped 0.1 percent in
September, the Commerce Department reported.
   Analysts said the August and September orders reports were
skewed by a big swing in demand for automobiles, which surged in
August only to drop back to a more normal level in September.
   Treasury bond prices rallied, following a recent pattern of
showing strength when stocks weaken. The benchmark 30-year bond was
up nearly } point at midday, equal to $7.50 per $1,000 in face
value.
   Airline stocks were down. AMR was off 3} at 66~, Delta down 2 at

market index was down 4.65 at 374.84.

<HEAD>Digital Unveils First Mainframe Computer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANA KENNEDY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Digital Equipment Corp. unveiled what it called
the first true mainframe computer in its 32-year history Tuesday in
what may be a direct challenge to International Business Machines
Corp.
   The announcement came on the same day as IBM itself announced
upgrades to its own aging but still dominant line of mainframes,
which are the biggest kind of general-purpose computers.
   The processors in Digital's new VAX 9000 series are the most
powerful ever introduced by the company, five times as fast as its
most powerful previous processors, Digital officials said.
   Digital has previously focused on raising power by clustering
together several mid-sized machines. Tuesday's announcement is seen
as a recognition that some jobs can only be done by single, big
computers.
   ``It's going to do very well,'' predicted Howard Anderson, an
analyst who is managing director of the Yankee Group in Boston.
``Digital always has great software and their users have a hunger
for power. The users keep getting bigger systems and they'll need
this.''
   The new systems will be capable of work ranging from
supercomputing jobs such as weather forecasting and oil exploration
to business jobs such as rapid transaction processing.
   Although Digital sometimes referred to two of its computers in
the 1970s as mainframes, Digital spokesman McLaren Harris said that
in this case, ``We feel comfortable in saying this is a true
mainframe-class machine.''
   Prices for the new systems range from $1.24 million for the
single-processor model to $3.92 million for the four-processor
model.
   ``They've essentially been naked in this particular category,''
said John Adams, an analyst with Adams, Harkness and Hill in
Boston. ``They're both refurbishing one end of the product line and
extending the company's grasp into new territory.''
   At present, about 70 percent of IBM's earnings come from
mainframe hardware and software. In contrast, about 90 percent of
Digital's earnings and sales stem from its minicomputers.
   Digital's introduction of a new mainframe coincided with IBM's
announcement Tuesday that it has improved its own mainframe
computers and software. The centerpiece was Hiperbatch, a piece of
software that IBM said speeds up by as much as 60 percent the
processing of overnight, back-office ``batch'' jobs.
   IBM's biggest mainframes are still bigger than Digital's. The
processors of IBM's new machines can hold up to 4.5 billion
characters in live memory, about nine times as much as the maximum
of 512 million characters in Digital's new computers.
   IBM's Bernard Puckett said the announcement in New York had been
planned well in advance, and it was ``truly circumstantial'' that
it came the same day as the Digital announcement.
   Batch processing, an unglamorous aspect of computing, consists
of end-of-the-day work such as updating customer records at stock
brokerage houses, reconciling customer accounts at banks and
controlling inventory in factories.
   Hiperbatch was designed in cooperation with Shearson Lehman
Hutton Inc. Shearson's computer chief, Jack Owens, said it had
proven to be a ``silver bullet'' for the brokerage house, which was
squeezed for time by the emergence of global trading 24 hours a day.
   IBM also announced new equipment and software for manufacturing;
upgrades for its aging but still profitable line of 3090 mainframe
computers; and new security products, including a $1,205 pen that
can detect forgery attempts.
   IBM, based in Armonk, N.Y., is the world's largest computer
company, and Digital, based in Maynard, Mass., is the second
largest.

<HEAD>Four Finalist Sites for Billion-Dollar Chip Plant</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER DIXON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Memories Inc., a consortium of computer
chip manufacturers, has narrowed the list of contenders for its $1
billion plant to Austin, Texas; Colorado Springs, Colo.; Phoenix,
Ariz.; and Middletown, N.Y., officials said Tuesday.
   U.S. Memories said the finalists, chosen from 57 locations in 15
states, were picked on the basis of financial, business, and
quality-of-life considerations.
   ``What set the finalists apart was that they showed a very
balanced approach to satisyfing our needs,'' said Sanford Kane,
president and chief executive officer of U.S. Memories. ``These
four locations came closest to meeting most of our site
requirements and excelled in several areas.''
   The consortium of seven companies said its mission is to produce
4-megabit DRAMs _ Dynamic Random Access Memory _ computer chips, to
raise the U.S. market share. DRAMs, it said, are an increasingly
critical technology for which the United States is dependent on
Japanese sources.
   DRAMs are used in microwave ovens, cars, VCRs, computers and
supercomputers, and most defense projects.
   Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, said he expects a tough fight among
the finalist for the manufacturing complex, which would employ
3,000 people when it begins operation in 1993, with anticipated
sales of $1 billion by 1994.
   U.S. Memories said its current plans are to chose and announce a
final site by the end of November, breaking ground by the end of
1989 and to begin shipping its product by mid-1991.
   Austin in January 1988 landed the much-sought Sematech
semiconductor research consortium. Kane had been chairman of the
site selection committee for Sematech, a jointly funded effort by
the Defense Department and private industry.
   Companies in the consortium include Advanced Micro Devices Inc.,
Digital Equipment Corp., Hewlett-Packard Co., International
Business Machines Corp., Intel Corp., LSI Logic Corp., and National
Semiconductor Corp.
   Other states submitting bids for the plant were Arizona,
California, Colorado, Massachusetts, Missouri, New York, North
Carolina, Oregon, Connecticut, Georgia, Kentucky, Minnesota and
Virginia. The 15th state submitting a bid could not be immediately
determined.

   Turner Broadcasting System Inc. says it has
formed a unit to make and distribute movies to theaters.
   Gerry Hogan, president of the new division, said Monday the new
branch will be called Turner Pictures and will go into operation
immediately.
   Its first two releases will be ``The Secret Life of Ian
Fleming,'' a dramatization about the former British spy who wrote
the James Bond novels, and ``Treasure Island,'' starring Charlton
Heston.
   ``The development of Turner Pictures is a natural extension of
TBS's production of outstanding first-run television movies,''
Hogan said. ``Now, in addition to bringing American cable viewers
the best in film entertainment on a selected basis, we will bring
our work to movie audiences around the world.''
   Turner Pictures' productions will be internationally syndicated
by Turner Program Services, and Turner Home Entertainment
International will distribute the films to theaters and home-video
distributors.

<HEAD>Quarterly Earnings Down 15.6 Percent</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sears, Roebuck and Co. Tuesday said its
third-quarter profit fell 15.6 percent, reflecting a sharp drop in
retailing income and a storm of claims filed against the Allstate
Insurance Co. by victims of Hurricane Hugo.
   The claims of more than $250 million represented the greatest
single storm-damage loss in Allstate's history, Sears said in
announcing its quarterly results.
   Sears earned $257.5 million, or 75 cents a share, in the three
months ended Sept. 30, compared with $305 million, or 80 cents a
share, in the comparable 1988 quarter.
   The per-share earnings reflected a stock-buyback program
announced a year ago that has reduced the number of outstanding
shares to 343.1 million compared to 379.8 million a year ago, Sears
said.
   Third-quarter revenue rose 4.8 percent to $13.2 billion from
$12.6 billion, the Chicago-based company said in a news release.
   Income from the Sears Merchandise Group, the nation's largest
retailing operation, plunged 25 percent to $82.9 million from
$110.5 million, Sears said.
   Revenue from the retailing division edged up 1.3 percent to $7.6
billion from $7.5 billion in 1988's third quarter.
   Sears attributed the retailing results to a soft market for
big-ticket durable goods, such as home appliances, and higher
interest costs in the credit segment of the merchandise group.
   Two retail analysts expressed differing opinions on whether the
performance of the merchandise group indicated that Sears'
``everyday low pricing'' strategy is failing.
   ``My opinion is that they probably have to do more promotion to
get the customers in the door,'' said Walter Loeb of Morgan Stanley
&amp; Co.
   But John Landschultz of Cowen &amp; Co. said the results ``weren't
bad at all.'' The real test of the new retailing strategy will come
in the second half of 1990, he said, after Sears finishes reshaping
its stores into collections of ``superstores,'' offering low-cost,
brand-name items in general groupings such as women's clothing,
major appliances or menswear.
   ``They're still in an adjustment period,'' Cowen said.
   Sears spokesman Douglas Fairweather was upbeat about the
strategy, which Sears began implementing last March to better
compete with discounters such as K mart Corp. and Wal-Mart Stores
Inc.
   ``We're very pleased with the results of everyday low pricing,
but that durable goods trough is very real and very significant,''
he said.
   Allstate's income fell to $126.1 million from $202.7 million,
largely as a result of damage claims from Hurricane Hugo, which
battered the southeastern U.S. coastline in September.
   The claims exceeded $250 million but because of reinsurance _
the practice among large insurance companies of farming out some of
their risk to smaller insurers _ the negative impact on Sears'
third-quarter net income was only $80 million, the company said.
   Allstate spokesman Greg Rossiter said it was ``a natural
conclusion'' that the company would also be hit with a lot of
damage claims from the earthquake that struck northern California a
week ago.
   But Rossiter said he could not predict the dollar amount of the
earthquake claims.
   The Dean Witter Financial Services Group reported net income of
$35.7 million for the quarter, up 32 percent from $27.1 million in
1988. Those results included a 71 percent increase in income from
Discover Card operations, which totaled $23.3 million.
   Third-quarter income from the Coldwell Banker Real Estate Group
jumped to $81.2 million from $22.2 million last year, reflecting a
nearly four-fold increase in after-tax gains from sale of
properties.
   For the nine months ended Sept. 30, Sears reported overall net
income of $906.4 million, or $2.56 per share, compared to $1.34
billion, or $3.52 per share, for the first nine months of 1988.
   Nine-month revenue rose 8.2 percent to $38.6 billion from $35.7
billion.
   The nine-month results for 1988 include a first-quarter
accounting change that resulted in a $550,000 increase in the
reported net income, Sears said.

   The stock market went for another rough ride
today, dropping steeply in morning trading only to finish the day
about even.
   The collapse of the UAL Corp. buyout helped unnerve an already
shaky market, and the Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks
briefly tumbled as much as 85 points in the first 1{ hours of
trading.
   After partially rebounding, the Dow Jones average was down
between 40 and 50 points for most of the session, then rallied in
the final hour.
   Contributing to the late recovery were separate rumors about
billionaire investor Donald Trump: one that he was interested in
buying UAL, the parent of United Airlines, and one that he was
considering renewing his bid for AMR Corp., the parent of American
Airlines.
   In addition to the UAL buyout failure, analysts said traders
were worried about lower-than-expected corporate profits in the
third quarter and signs of economic weakness in the government's
latest report on factory orders.
   Underlying the market's volatility is continued nervousness that
Wall Street has not entirely recovered from the Friday the 13th
crunch, when the Dow Jones average fell 190.58 points.

   Wall Street rose a session of bucking stock
prices today, watching shares plummet in early trading and bounce
back up in a late rally to finish the day little changed.
   The widely watched Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks,
down as much as 85 points in early trading, finished down just 3.69
points at 2,659.22.
   Broader market indicators also fell in heavy trading, with
declining issues outnumbering advancers ones by almost 7 to 2 on
the New York Stock Exchange. Big Board volume totaled 237.96
million shares, compared with 135.86 million in Monday's session.
   Analysts said news that UAL Corp.'s board of directors had
decided late Monday not to proceed with a buyout plan by an
employee-management group affected other transportation stocks and
helped trigger the morning selloff.
   UAL finished down $8.37{ at $170, after having been down down
more than $32 a share earlier in the day.
   Computerized program trading involving stock-index futures also
contributed to the decline, market watchers said.
   The UAL group's Oct. 13 announcement that it was unable to get
financing for its $6.75 billion buyout played a role in the
190.58-point drop in the Dow industrials that day and turmoil in
stock markets worldwide.
   The market rebounded from that drop, with the Dow industrials
gaining a record 119.88 points last week.
   Market watchers also said the government's report today of a 0.1
percent slight decline in durable goods orders during September did
nothing to dispel concerns over lower-than-expected corporate
profits for the third quarter.

<HEAD>GM Plans to be Sole Sponsor of Several TV Specials</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp. said Tuesday it is making a
multimillion-dollar commitment to become the sole sponsor of
several television specials over the next two TV seasons.
   John McNulty, a spokesman for the automaker in Detroit, said the
programs will be billed on the broadcast and cable television
networks that carry them as ``GM Mark of Excellence Presentations.''
   He said GM is committing about $11 million to the project this
TV season and an unspecified amount for next TV season starring in
the fall of 1990.
   McNulty said GM spent about $8 million last year to be the sole
sponsor of similar shows, and feels that consumers who have watched
the shows tend to remember the sponsor and usually have an improved
opinion of the company.
   The new programs will include ``The American Playwright's
Theater'' series of plays on the Arts &amp; Entertainment cable
network; the annual ``Kennedy Center Honors'' specials on CBS,
``The American Film Institute Life Achievement Award'' special on
ABC and NBC's planned movie ``The Old Man and the Sea.''
   GM will be the sole advertiser on telecasts of these programs,
which are variously scheduled for later this year through 1991.
   In addition, GM said it had agreed to be the sole corporate
underwriter of Public Broadcasting System programs including the
``A World of Ideas with Bill Moyers'' series, the ``Live from
Lincoln Center'' series of music and ballet performances and a
planned 10-hour movie epic called ``The Civil War.''
   McNulty said GM has over the past five years of devoted a large
portion of the money it spends on ``corporate image'' advertising _
as opposed to ``product'' ads that tout specific cars _ on sole
sponsorships.
   ``It is one company's attempt to underwrite and exclusively
sponsor programs we believe are worthy to carry our name ...'' he
said.
   McNulty declined to say how much GM spends on corporate image
advertising.
   The trade journal Advertising Age recently estimated that GM
spent nearly $1.3 billion on all types of advertising last year,
making it the third-biggest advertiser behind consumer products
companies Philip Morris Cos. Inc. and Procter &amp; Gamble Co.

   The dollar finished lower against most major
currencies Tuesday, depressed by volatility on Wall Street and
expectations of lower U.S. interest rates.
   A steep morning plunge of more than 80 points in the Dow Jones
industrial average touched off a heavy but brief flurry of dollar
sales that subsided once the stock market started to recover later
in the day.
   David Jaques, a vice president at Barclays Bank PLC in New York,
said the dollar didn't manage to recover all of the ground lost
during the temporary stock market selloff. The Dow industrials
closed with a loss of 3.69 points at 2,659.22.
   He said currency dealings were lethargic in the early going,
with traders lacking a compelling reason to buy or sell. News of a
0.1 percent decline in September orders for U.S. durable goods
created barely a ripple in the currency markets because the figure
virtually matched advance estimates.
   The durable goods report tended to support the view that
economic growth is flattening out to such an extent that the
Federal Reserve might decide to pump it up with more generous
credit.
   Looser credit would push down interest rates. Declining U.S.
interest rates generally weigh down the dollar.
   The dollar began its trading day in Tokyo with a fall to 142.10
Japanese yen from 142.40 yen at Monday's close. Later, in London,
it declined further to 141.95 yen. It was quoted at 141.50 yen in
New York, down from 141.90 yen on Monday.
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.6065 from $1.5945 late
Monday. A pound cost $1.6075 at the end of New York trading,
compared with $1.6030 on Monday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday's
quotes, included: 1.8358 West German marks, down from 1.8470;
1.6095 Swiss francs, down from 1.6190 Swiss francs; 6.2370 French
francs, down from 6.2740; 1.1713 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1704;
and 1,345.75 Italian lire, down from 1,356.00.
   Late rates for the dollar in Europe, compared with late Monday's
rates, included: 1.8390 West German marks, down from 1.8550; 1.6120
Swiss francs, down from 1.6270; 6.2475 French francs, down from
6.3050; 2.0860 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0965; 1,349.00 Italian
lire, down from 1,364.50; and, 1.1723 Canadian dollars, up from
1.1720.
   Gold prices rose. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold
for current delivery settled at $370.20 a troy ounce, up $3.20 from
Monday's settlement. Republic National Bank of New York quoted a 4
p.m. EDT gold bid of $368.70 an ounce, compared with Monday's late
bid of $366.25.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid price of $367.75 a troy ounce
from $365.75 bid late Monday.
   In Zurich, Switzerland, gold rose to a closing bid of $367.50
from $365.60 late Monday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose 37 cents to close at a bid of
$366.91.
   Silver bullion prices rose in London to a late bid price of
$5.12 a troy ounce, up from $5.09 late Monday. On New York's Comex,
silver bullion for current delivery settled at $5.148 an ounce, up
from $5.089 on Monday.

   Treasury bond prices rose sharply Tuesday,
sustaining most of large early gains despite an afternoon rebound
in the volatile stock market.
   Encouraging signs Tuesday that the Federal Reserve would not
drive interest rates higher to fight inflation, the enemy of
fixed-income securities such as bonds, also boosted the credit
market during a hectic trading day.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, the bellwether
30-year issue gained 5-32 point, or $4.69 per $1,000 face value,
down from as much as 15-32 point earlier in the day.
   The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its
price, tumbled to 7.89 percent from 7.93 percent late Monday.
   ``The stock market was the real story,'' said Steven A. Wood, an
economist with BankAmerica Capital Markets Group in San Francisco.
   The rise in Treasury prices followed a pattern established in
the Friday the 13th stock market tumble, when bonds rose sharply as
investors shifted money out of stocks when the Dow Jones industrial
average fell about 190 points. The long bond rose about $5 on
Monday, after the Dow closed down 26 points.
   On Tuesday, the Dow industrial average declined as much as 85
points in the morning session before rebounding to finish the day
down 3.69 points.
   Bond prices typically rise during a stock market selloff because
Treasury bonds, which are guaranteed by the government, are
considered a safe haven in times of financial instability.
   ``Half the gains were sustained and that really was a pretty
good performance,'' Wood said of Tuesday's dealings.
   Wood also said the Federal Reserve did not drain reserves from
the banking system, as widely had been expected. He said that by
staying out of the market the Fed kept a lid on the federal funds
rate, which is regarded as an indicator of the Fed's short-term
intentions.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, was quoted at 811-16 percent, up from 8} percent Monday.
   ``People are now convinced the Fed is more likely to allow the
funds rate to be soft than to push them up for fear either the
stock market or the economy will tank,'' Wood said.
   Prices of short-term governments were up 1-32 point to 5-32
point, intermediate maturities gained [ point to 5-32 point and
long-term issues gained from 5-16 point to 7-16 point, according to
Telerate Inc., the financial-information service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Hutton Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, rose 2.38 to 1,193.45.
   Many corporate bonds also increased. Moody's Investment Grade
Corporate Bond Index, which measures total return on a portfolio of
80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer, gained
0.49 to 338.54.
   High-yield, lower-rated ``junk'' bonds followed the stock market
descent but not its rebound. Traders said many widely traded issues
were off about { point.
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds was 9225-32, up 3-16 point. The average
yield to maturity dropped to 7.31 from 7.33 percent late Monday.
   Meanwhile, yields three-month Treasury bills auctioned Monday
fell to 7.75 as the discount was down 1 basis point to 7.51
percent. Yields on newly auctioned six-month bills fell to 7.85
percent with the discount off 4 basis points to 7.46 percent.
Yields on one-year bills fell to 7.78 percent as the discount fell
3 basis points to 7.26 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.

<HEAD>Recession Fears Fuel Copper Selloff</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Copper futures prices nosedived Tuesday for the third straight
day, dropping to 2{-month lows on New York's Commodity Exchange on
selling fueled by perceptions of a weakening economy.
   On other futures markets, precious metals advanced; stock-index
futures retreated in a day of wild trading; grain and soybean
futures fell; oil futures were mixed; and livestock and meat
futures were mixed.
   Copper futures settled 0.9 cent to 4.6 cents lower with the
contract for delivery in December down 4.5 cents at $1.151 a pound,
its lowest daily close since Aug. 11.
   ``It was a bloody, bloody day,'' said James Steel, a metals
analyst with Refco Inc., a large commodities brokerage.
   The decline began early and accelerated as prices fell through
successive levels of technical support. The December contract
traded as low as $1.134 before rebounding shortly before the close.
   Copper prices have fallen nearly 12 percent in the past seven
trading sessions, largely in reaction to an improving supply
picture.
   But analysts said Tuesday's selloff was more a reflection of
economic anxiety prompted by the stock market's volatility and by a
government report Tuesday that orders for durable goods fell 0.1
percent in September.
   On the stock market Tuesday, the Dow Jones average of 30
industrial stocks briefly tumbled 85 points in the first 1{ hours
of trading, partially rebounded, then was down 40 to 50 points for
most of the session before closing with a modest 3.69-point loss.
   ``I believe the copper market is fearing a recession,'' said
Peter Cardillo, a commodities trading adviser with Josephthal &amp; Co.
in New York. ``As an industrial metal, copper would suffer if a
recession came along.''
   Stock-market jitters and a weaker dollar helped the precious
metals as some investors ditched stocks and shifted assets into the
perceived safety of gold.
   Gold settled $3.20 higher across the board on the Comex with the
December contract at $373.40 a troy ounce; silver was 5.4 cents to
5.7 cents higher with December at $5.195 a troy ounce.
   Stock-index futures tripped a circuit-breaker on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange when the December S&amp;P 500 contract fell the
permitted 12-point limit, to 335.95, early in the session.
   The drop triggered a rule prohibiting selling at prices below
that level for 30 minutes, but trading halted only momentarily
before buying entered the market and prices rebounded.
   The rule is one of several circuit-breakers designed to slow a
market collapse.
   The contract for December delivery of stocks tracked by the
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index settled 1.45 points lower at 346.50.
Each point is worth $500.
   Grain and soybean futures drifted lower on the Chicago Board of
Trade as the fast-moving Midwestern harvest continued to bring new
supplies to the market.
   Wheat settled unchanged to 3{ cents lower with December at $4.07
a bushel; corn was \ cent 1\ cents lower with December at $2.40 a
bushel; oats were \ cent to 1 cent lower with December at $1.45\ a
bushel; soybeans were 2\ cents lower to 1 cent higher with November
at $5.60} a bushel.
   Oil futures finished mixed on the New York Mercantile Exchange
with the November gasoline contract down sharply amid rumblings of
OPEC overproduction.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 4 cents lower to 1
cent higher with November at $18.60 a barrel; heating oil was .08
cent lower to .08 cent higher with November at 58.45 cents a
gallon; unleaded gasoline was .69 cent lower to .05 cent higher
with November at 52.79 cents a gallon.
   Cattle futures fell moderately on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, giving back Monday's gains. Pork futures were mixed.
   Live cattle settled .20 cent to .58 cent lower with December at
75.22 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .15 cent to .45 cent lower
with October at 82.80 cents a pound; live hogs were .13 cent lower
to .05 cent higher with December at 47.67 cents a pound; frozen
pork bellies were .25 cent to .60 cent higher with February at
52.87 cents a pound.

<HEAD>Mobil, Chevron, Shell Earnings Fall; Texaco's Profit Rises</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDS: UPDATES with 4 final grafs to include Sun Co. earnings</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JULIA C. MARTINEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Texaco Inc. reported an 11 percent rise in third-quarter
earnings Tuesday, while Mobil Corp., Chevron Corp. and Shell Oil
Co. said earnings declined.
   The results reflected the benefits of Texaco's post-bankruptcy
restructuring as well as the mixed impact of higher crude prices,
which helps oil companies boost earnings on the exploration and
production end of their business but hurts the ``downstream'' end
of refining and marketing.
   Crude prices have been hovering between $19 and $20 a barrel,
about $3 higher than the same time last year.
   Mobil's earnings slipped 4 percent in the three months ended
Sept. 30 to $532 million, or $1.30 a share, from $557 million, or
$1.36 a share, in the comparable 1988 period. Revenue for the
nation's second-largest oil concern totaled $13.64 billion, up 4
percent over $13.12 billion a year earlier.
   In the first nine months, New York-based Mobil earned $1.4
billion, or $3.32 a share, down 16 percent from $1.6 billion a year
earlier. Revenue reached $41.69 billion, up 2 percent from $40.99
billion.
   Contributing to the lower quarterly earnings, Mobil said, was a
decline in chemical results and a $40 million provision for
restructuring of its U.S. exploration and production business.
   Mobil spokesman John Lord declined to give details of the
restructuring except to say that it would involve the transfer and
termination of employees over a two-year period ``in order to
reduce costs and focus efforts in areas where the projected
financial returns are most attractive.''
   Texaco earned $305 million, or $1.10 a share, in the third
quarter, up 11 percent from $274 million, or $1.12 a share, a year
earlier. Revenue dipped 4 percent to $8.36 billion from $8.68
billion, the result of the company's recent post-bankruptcy court
restructuring,
   Texaco, based in White Plains, N.Y., said the lower per-share
earnings in the third quarter reflected a higher number of
outstanding shares of common stock as well as a new preferred stock
for which the company must set aside reserves.
   In the first nine months, Texaco's earnings more than doubled to
$2.13 billion, or $8.19 a share, from $1.01 billion, or $4.14, a
share, in the comparable 1988 period. Revenue was down slightly at
$26.42 billion from $26.67 billion.
   Besides strong gains in the company's exploration and production
businesses, Texaco benefited from the restructuring, which lowered
its corporate losses, including interest expenses from the payment
of debt, by $117 million in the period.
   ``There are so many changes going on internally that the
financial data really isn't comparable with a year ago. It's almost
misleading to compare it with last year,'' said oil industry
analyst Rosario Ilacqua, with the investment firm of Nikko
Securities Co. International Inc.
   Texaco completed the asset-sale portion of the restructuring
earlier this year, nearly a year after emerging from bankruptcy
protection. Texaco had filed for protection from creditors under
Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy laws in April 1987 after
losing a high-stakes court battle with Pennzoil Co. that cost
Texaco $3 billion.
   Chevron Corp., headquartered in San Francisco, earned $417
million, or $1.22 a share, in the third quarter, down slightly from
$420, or $1.23 a share, a year earlier. Revenue jumped 11 percent
to $8 billion, from $7.2 billion.
   In the nine-months, Chevron's earnings declined 29 percent to
$1.13 billion, or $3.31 a share, from $1.6 billion, or $4.66 a
share, in the year-earlier period. Revenue totaled $23.9 billion,
up about 9 percent from $22 billion.
   Shell's third-quarter earnings fell 7 percent to $340 million
from $364 million a year earlier. Revenue dipped to $5.40 billion
from $5.47 billion.
   Nine-month earnings grew by 11 percent to $1.14 billion, from
$1.03 billion, while sales at Houston-based Shell increased 3
percent to $16.44 billion from $15.94 billion.
   Shell is wholly owned by the Royal Dutch-Shell Group of
Companies, based in both London and the Hague, the Netherlands. The
company does not report per-share earnings.
   Sun Co. said its earnings jumped 18 percent in the third
quarter, due largely to higher earnings from the company's Canadian
subsidiary and increased exploration and production results
overseas.
   Sun earned $85 million, or 80 cents a share, compared with $72
million, or 67 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue totaled $2.73
billion, up 11 percent from $2.46 billion.
   Nine-month earnings totaled $271 million, or $2.54 a share, a
turnaround from the $69 million loss, equal to 66 cents a share,
recorded in the year-earlier period. Revenue in the first nine
months rose 14 percent to $8.30 billion from $7.28 billion in the
1988 period.
   Sun said the absence of $10 million of losses from domestic
exploration and production operations in last year's results
contributed to an improvement in the latest figures.

<TEXT>
   Oil futures prices closed mixed in lackluster
trading Tuesday as the market awaited new statistics on oil
inventories.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the November contract for
West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude oil,
finished 4 cents lower at $19.72 per 42-gallon barrel. The contract
lost 39 cents in Monday's session.
   Wholesale unleaded gasoline for November delivery slipped 0.69
cent to 52.79 cents a gallon while the December contract lost 0.47
cents to end at 52.31 cents a gallon.
   Domestic heating oil, meanwhile, recovered slightly from sharp
declines on Monday. Contracts for November and December delivery
each gained 0.3 cent. The November contract settled at 58.45 cents
a gallon, while the December contract closed at 58.87 cents. On
Monday, the contracts fell 2.02 cents and 2 cents, respectively.
   Analysts said the market continued the anemic performance of the
last several days, reflecting concerns about the growing supply of
crude on world markets and reports suggesting that the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries is continuing to increase its
output.
   Energy brokers said the market was focusing on new American
Petroleum Industry inventory statistics due out after the close of
trading.
   ``The expectation is that they will be up across the board,''
said Chris McCormick, a futures trader with Drexel Burnham Lambert
Inc.

<HEAD>Norfolk Southern Announces $1.65 Billion Repurchase of Stock</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NORFOLK, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Norfolk Southern Corp. announced Tuesday a
3-year plan to repurchase 45 million shares of its publicly owned
stock at market price.
   The deal is worth around $1.65 billion.
   The transportation company currently is in the midst of a 20
million-share repurchase program that ends at the end of this year.
   ``We believe our stock purchase program over the last two years
has been successful and that an expanded program of purchases
should serve to enhance stockholder value,'' said Arnold B.
McKinnon, chairman and chief executive officer.
   Norfolk Southern's third-quarter earnings report is to be issued
Wednesday in New York.
   The company has 172.2 million shares publicly held.
   Deborah Noxon, a company spokeswoman, said Norfolk Southern has
purchased 19 million of the 20 million shares in the first
repurchase plan, and expects to buy back the remaining shares by
the end of the year.
   If the remaining 1 million shares and the newly authorized 45
million shares all are acquired, the number of publicly held shares
will be reduced by 26 percent, Ms. Noxon said.
   She said the company began its repurchase program in 1987 after
efforts to acquire the Conrail system and Piedmont Aviation fell
through. Norfolk Southern had $1 billion in cash reserves and
believed its best return was to buy back its own stock.
   Ms. Noxon said the latest repurchase would be financed by the
remainder of that reserve, some borrowed funds, and anticipated
income.

   Wall Street added to its casino image Tuesday in
a heart-thumping session that saw the Dow Jones 30-stock industrial
average plummet 85 points in the morning but rally to finish nearly
even.
   The Dow Jones average closed with a narrow decline of 3.69
points at 2,659.22.
   Broader measures of the market showed bigger declines than the
Dow average. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones more than
3 to 1 on the New York Stock Exchange.
   The market's wild behavior was attributed to speculation over
the fate of buyout plans for UAL Corp. and continued skittishness
dating from the Friday the 13th plunge, when the Dow industrials
fell more than 190 points.
   Adding to the market's volatility was computer-driven program
trading, which seems to compress up and down trends into far
briefer periods of time.
   ``This is clearly a market that you can't turn your back on for
10 minutes,'' said Barton Biggs, chief investment strategist at
Morgan Stanley &amp; Co.
   UAL led the market downward in the morning and back up late in
the day, when rumors spread that several potential buyers including
Donald Trump were accumulating stock in the parent of United
Airlines.
   The initial decline in UAL's stock came after the announcement
late Monday by UAL's board that it had decided to stay independent
for now as it examined alternatives to a $300-a-share
employee-management buyout plan that collapsed earlier this month.
   The stock of UAL fell more than 30 a share in the morning but
recovered to finish down only 8] at 170.
   The worst period for the market came at midmorning, when the Dow
Jones average fell more than 50 points in less than half an hour to
touch its low of 85 points off.
   In Chicago, the S&amp;P 500 stock-index futures contract fell the
12-point limit permitted under ``circuit-breaker'' rules designed
to slow heavy market selloffs. Index futures prices rebounded after
trading resumed.
   Adding to traders' nervousness Tuesday were lower-than-expected
third-quarter profits from several major companies and worries
about an economic slowdown. The Commerce Department reported that
orders for ``big ticket'' durable goods slipped 0.1 percent in
September.
   Peter Barry, director of research at Fahnestock &amp; Co., said he
was alarmed by reports that UAL takeover speculation was the main
factor in the market's rally in the final hour.
   ``I would truly hope that an event such as that (a new offer for
UAL), true or not, would not be enough to turn the entirety of
financial assets, stocks and bonds, on its ear. That would raise
questions about the underpinnings of the market, wouldn't you
say?'' Barry said.
   Aside from UAL, other actively traded issues included Security
Pacific, which fell ~ to 44{; Philip Morris, up | to 44{; Chase
Manhattan, down ~ at 38~; and AMR, down 1} at 68~.
   At the close, among New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, there
were 360 issues up, 1,213 down and 381 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to a heavy 237.96
million shares, up from 135.86 million in the previous session.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 283.28 million shares.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the nation's stock markets as a whole fell
$18.69 billion, or 0.55 percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
0.85 to 190.05.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell 0.75 to 392.83, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index fell 1.13 to 343.70.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market fell
5.52 to 461.70. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 376.36, down 3.10.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   France has bought 5,000 metric tons of U.S.
surplus butter at cut-rate prices, the U.S. Agriculture Department
said Tuesday.
   F. Paul Dickerson, general sales manager of the department's
Foreign Agricultural Service, said the salted butter was sold to
Fromageries Dischamp of Sayat, France, a privately owned dairy
products company.
   The contract calls for an option buy an additional 10,000 tons
of butter, subject to agreement by both parties. Dickerson said the
butter was sold for use in France or other Common Market countries.
   The butter was sold for $1,620 per ton delivered to U.S. ports,
an average of less than 74 cents a pound. A metric ton equals about
2,205 pounds.
   According to the department's Commodity Credit Corp., the
surplus butter cost about $1.40 per pound to acquire under the
government's dairy price support program.
   The 1985 farm law, as amended by the Hunger Relief Act of 1988,
requires the export sale of 150,000 tons of surplus dairy products
each fiscal year through September 30, 1990.
   Products sold under the program generally are sold at prevailing
market prices.

<HEAD>Reports Increase in Third-Quarter Earnings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Supercomputer maker Cray Research Inc. on
Tuesday reported a 35.4 percent increase in third-quarter earnings,
but said the results still lag behind expectations.
   The company, which earlier this month announced plans to lay off
400 workers or 7 percent of its workforce, reported earnings of
$30.65 million, $1.04 per share, for the quarter ended Sept. 30.
That compares with 1988 third-quarter earnings of $22.61 million or
73 cents per share.
   Third-quarter 1989 revenues were $210.16 million, up 44.7
percent from $145.21 million in the same period a year ago.
   Earnings for the first nine months of the year total only $36.57
million or $1.24 per share, compared with $68.1 million or $2.19
per share for the same period a year ago. Nine-month revenue
totaled $454.56 million compared with $425.42 million for the first
nine months of 1988.
   ``Since much of our current backlog is for 1989 deliveries, we
do not have great visibility into 1990,'' said Marcelo A. Gumucio,
Cray's president and chief operating officer.
   ``With the visibility we do have, along with an assessment of
our prospect list, we have concluded it is prudent to plan for next
year on the assumption that revenue again will be flat.''
   He said based on the company's revised projections, earnings
results will likely be 40 percent to 45 percent lower than the
company's 1988 performance of $156.6 million.
   Cray said customers accepted 17 systems, with total contract
value of about $175 million, during the third quarter. The value of
systems ordered during the quarter totaled about $145 million, and
the value of the order backlog at the end of the quarter was about
$315 million compared to $340 million at the end of the second
quarter.

<HEAD>Mack Chairman Resigns As Third-Quarter Loss Expected</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALLENTOWN, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   John B. Curcio, whose authority at the
wheel of Mack Trucks Inc. plunged along with company profits for
the past nine months, has relinquished his last title with the
truck maker.
   With the company on the verge of announcing a third-quarter loss
it expects to be about $50 million and looking at projected losses
in the final three months of the year, Curcio resigned Monday as
chairman.
   Curcio lost the post of president to newcomer Ralph Reins in
June when expectations of a loss in the second quarter were
announced, and then chief executive to the heir apparent in
September when the third-quarter projection was disclosed.
   Curcio's resignation will be effective with the election of his
successor, possibly as soon as Nov. 2, when the Mack board of
directors will hold a special meeting, Reins said.
   The push to remove Curcio apparently has been led by Renault's
truck operations, which owns about 45 percent of Mack's stock and
has four directors on Mack's 10-member board.
   ``Heads will roll at Mack,'' Phillipe Gras, chief of Renault's
truck operations, promised a French newspaper after the
third-quarter projections were announced.
   Curcio, 56, moved out of his office at Mack's world headquarters
in Allentown Friday, concluding a 10-year stay in the sixth-floor
executive offices.
   Curcio is the third key executive to leave the company in recent
months, following the departures of Louis J. LaFontaine, executive
vice president of administration, and John J. Costa, executive vice
president of manufacturing.
   To fill their respective places, Reins recruited William C.
Craig, a vice president of human resources at Volkswagen of
America, and Don DeFosset, president of off-highway products and
driveline division at Rockwell International Corp.
   Mack's earnings dropped 77 percent in the first quarter to
$1.203 million then further to a $18.42 million loss in the second
quarter.
   ``Curcio was running it, and he stumbled, '' said Frank
Prezelski, an analyst for Deutsche Bank Capital Corp. of New York.
``When you're a strong-willed central manager as he was, there's no
one else to blame. It's unfortunate, but he has to take
responsibility.''
   According to Prezelski, Renault lost its patience with Curcio's
regime early last month, when Gras learned of Mack's continuing
problems with its new E-7 engine and an industry-wide decline in
the truck market.
   ``This truck industry is a never-ending battle,'' Curcio said in
a telephone interview Monday with The Morning Call of Allentown
from his home. ``It's time for someone else to be on the front
lines.''
   ``Mack is in good hands,'' Curcio said.

<TEXT>
   Honeywell Inc. on Tuesday announced the sale
of 16 percent of the outstanding common stock of its Tokyo-based
partner, Yamatake-Honeywell, for $280 million.
   The interest in Yamatake-Honeywell was acquired by a group of 10
Japanese financial institutions and industrial corporations, the
controls maker said.
   On Oct. 17, Honeywell said it had reached an agreement to sell
the 16 percent stake as part of the company's program to enhance
short- and long-term shareholder value, announced in July.
Honeywell said proceeds from the sale would be used in the
company's announced program to repurchase up to 10 million of its
own shares.
   A second sale of additional Yamatake-Honeywell outstanding
common stock is being negotiated, Honeywell said.
   ``This action follows through on two objectives we set for this
part of our value-enhancement program,'' said James J. Renier,
Honeywell chairman and chief executive officer.
   ``We unlocked part of the value of our investment in
Yamatake-Honeywell for our shareholders. At the same time, we are
maintaining the excellent long-time partnership with
Yamatake-Honeywell that has led to successful cooperative worldwide
research and development, marketing and distribution strategies.''

<HEAD>Mesa Rejects StatesWest Proposal to Combine Two Airlines</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FARMINGTON, N.M. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mesa Airlines on Tuesday rejected a
proposal by Phoenix-based StatesWest Airlines to combine the two
companies.
   Mesa's board of directors considered the proposal too vague and
ill-defined to constitute an offer or merit further consideration,
said Gary Risley, Mesa's vice president for corporate affairs.
   Mesa's board decided not to refer the Oct. 16 proposal to its
financial adviser, Risley said.
   StatesWest's proposal ``did not set forth the source of funds
for the proposal or describe the terms of the StatesWest securities
which the proposal contemplated would be issued to Mesa
shareholders by StatesWest,'' he said in a news release.
   StatesWest had offered about $15.3 million in cash and
StatesWest securities for all of Mesa's common stock that
StatesWest did not already own.
   The offer, made in a letter from StatesWest Chairman Rudy
Miller, called for $7 a share in cash plus securities of StatesWest
with a value of $3 a share.
   Risley has said Mesa has 1.65 million shares of stock
outstanding.
   StatesWest acquired 7.25 percent of the stock in May, and Miller
said he had recently purchased some additional stock.
   Mesa officials said earlier this month they had no interest in a
friendly takeover proposal by StatesWest. Mesa later announced it
was examining the possibility of buying Air Midwest of Wichita, Kan.
   StatesWest services cities in Arizona, Southern California and
Nevada.
   Mesa services cities in New Mexico, Colorado, Wyoming, Texas and
Arizona. A Mesa subsidiary, Milwaukee-based Skyway Airlines,
operates in Iowa, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan and Wisconsin.

   Olympic officials Tuesday signed a
previously announced contract with CBS-TV that awards the American
network exclusive U.S. broadcasting rights at the 1994 Winter
Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway, for $300 million.

<HEAD>Quaker Oats Reports 24 Percent Gain In Quarterly Earnings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Quaker Oats Co. announced a 24 percent gain in
its fiscal first-quarter profit Tuesday, citing strong improvement
in its domestic and international food businesses.
   Chicago-based Quaker reported net income of $55.7 million, or 70
cents a share, for the three months ended Sept. 30, compared with
$45 million, or 57 cents a share, for the same period a year ago.
   Results for the prior year's first quarter were restated to
reflect an accounting change that resulted in a charge of $6.4
million before taxes and $3.7 million after taxes, Quaker said.
   Quarterly sales rose slightly to $1.44 billion from $1.43
billion a year ago, the company said.
   Operating income from North American food operations soared 66
percent to $62.8 million from $37.8 million despite only a $300,000
increase in sales, to $901.4 million, Quaker said.
   The improvement resulted from lower advertising and
merchandising costs as a percentage of sales, and from better
productivity, the company said.
   ``We are taking a more focused approach to our advertising and
merchandising expenditures by targeting high-margin, value-added
products with our marketing dollars,'' said Chairman William D.
Smithburg.
   Quaker reported operating income from international food
operations at $38.6 million, a 55 percent gain over the $24.9
million reported in last year's fiscal first quarter.
   Operating income from Quaker's Fisher-Price toy subsidiary fell
32 percent to $28.9 million from $42.7 million, mainly due to lower
shipments of toys, the company said.
   First-quarter financing costs, including interest expenses and
foreign exchange, rose by $13.1 million to $30.7 million, mainly
due to borrowing for the fiscal 1989 acquisition of Continental
Coffee Products Co. of Chicago, Quaker said.

<HEAD>Dunkin' Donuts Starts Accepting Purchase Bids</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RANDOLPH, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dunkin' Donuts Inc. announced Tuesday it
has set up procedures to accept bids to buy the company from
interested parties, but one potential buyer alleged the company
isn't seriously considering offers.
   The international doughnut shop chain, which battled takeover
attempts for months before deciding in September to accept bids on
a friendly basis, set a Nov. 10 deadline for receiving bids.
   The move came after a Canadian partnership filed a motion Monday
to bring to early trial its lawsuit against the doughnut chain,
alleging the company reneged on its promise to receive friendly
bids.
   ``We've been responding to the fact that they are bringing up
litigation again,'' said Maureen Burgess, a spokeswoman for Dunkin'
Donuts. Several companies have expressed interest in buying the
company, which is based in this Boston suburbn, she said.
   Dunkin' Donuts officials, however, refused to say the company
was for sale.
   ``No determination has yet been made to sell the company,
although such a sale is one alternative being considered,'' said
Robert M. Rosenberg, chairman and chief executive officer, in a
statement released Tuesday.
   DD Acquisition Corp., a Canadian partnership that has pursued
Dunkin' Donuts since June, asked the Delaware Chancery Court on
Monday to move up a trial date for its lawsuit against Dunkin'
Donuts, currently set for Nov. 1 or later.
   The suit challenges a series of extensive efforts Dunkin' Donuts
undertook to prevent its acquisition.
   The trial date was postponed after Dunkin' Donuts announced
Sept. 29 it would begin looking at alternatives, including a merger
or leveraged buyout, to try to increase its stock price.
   DD Acquisition offered Dunkin' Donuts $45 a share, or $308
million, in late August, up from an offer of $43 a share tendered
two weeks earlier.
   Dunkin' Donuts reported a 34 percent drop in third-quarter
earnings, much of it attributed to costs associated with battling
the hostile takeover.

<HEAD>Johnson &amp; Johnson Third-Quarter Profit Up 10 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Johnson &amp; Johnson reported Tuesday
its third-quarter profit rose 10.4 percent from the same period
last year, spurred by the performance of four new products.
   The New Brunswick-based pharmaceutical maker said earnings rose
to $265 million, or 80 cents a share, compared with $240 million,
or 71 cents a share, for the same 1988 period.
   The company also set a quarterly sales record, up 11.5 percent
to $2.45 billion from $2.2 billion in last year's third quarter.
   Ralph S. Larson, chairman and chief executive officer, said the
sales record was particularly pleasing in light of increasing
competition in domestic consumer markets.
   ``Johnson &amp; Johnson posted record revenues in the quarter due to
the exceptionally strong sales growth by the pharmaceutical
business and a solid performance by the professional operations,''
he said in a statement.
   Larsen cited four new company products in particular. Acuvue, a
disposable contact lens, and Hismanal, an antihistamine, led the
domestic sales surge, he said.
   Eprex, a drug used by dialysis patients suffering from anemia,
and Prepulsid, a gastro-intestinal drug, were leaders in overseas
sales, he said.
   Net earnings for the first nine months of 1989 were $879
million, or $2.64 a share, up 11.3 percent from $790 million, or
$2.31 a share, for the last year's first nine months. Sales
increased 7.1 percent to $7.29 billion from $6.8 million, the
company said.

   Procter &amp; Gamble Co. said Tuesday a 6 percent
increase in sales and settlement of a cookie formula infringement
suit gave the company a 38 percent increase in its fiscal
first-quarter earnings.
   For the quarter ended Sept. 30, P&amp;G had a profit of $551
million, or $1.66 a share, on sales of $5.57 billion. During the
same period last year, the company earned $400 million, or $1.18 a
share, on sales of $5.26 billion.
   The per-share figures are adjusted to reflect a 2-for-1 stock
split stockholders approved this month.
   The company received a $125 million settlement during the
quarter in a patent-infringement lawsuit it filed accusing three
food companies of infringing on P&amp;G's formula for chewy cookies.
   P&amp;G received the settlement from Keebler, Nabisco and Frito-Lay
under a consent judgment signed by U.S. District Judge Joseph
Longobardi in Delaware last month.
   P&amp;G sued the companies in 1984, contending they obtained Procter
&amp; Gamble's formula for Duncan Hines chewy cookies by spying on the
company, then introduced similar cookies.
   P&amp;G cut back on production of the cookies in 1987, and has a
small share of the cookie market.
   The consumer products giant, which had sales of $21.3 billion
last year, makes and markets a variety of laundry and cleaning
products, personal-care products, pharmaceuticals, food and
beverage products, and products for business and industry.

   The president of the international Machinists
union toured picket lines Tuesday on the 21st day of a strike by
57,800 Boeing Co. workers.
   George Kourpias, president of the International Association of
Machinists and Aerospace Workers, also was to meet with local union
leaders as the strike against the aerospace giant continued with no
negotiations scheduled.
   Kourpias on Monday addressed a gathering of Boeing strikers in
Wichita, Kan., but no rally was planned in Seattle. Kourpias
instead planned to visit pickets at all of Boeing's major
installations in the Seattle area.
   ``We had our rally last weekend,'' said Tom Baker, president of
Machinists District Lodge 751. About 5,000 people attended a strike
march and rally Saturday featuring a speech by the Rev. Jesse
Jackson.
   The visit came two days before the first strike payments, a flat
$100 a week per striker from a $100 million Machinists strike fund,
and a day after Boeing chairman Frank Shrontz reiterated the
company's hard-line stance.
   Meanwhile, Boeing spokesman Deane Darling said two 737-300s were
delivered Tuesday to Lufthansa Airlines, bringing total deliveries
during the strike to 18 _ all planes that were virtually complete
before the walkout.
   In addition, Trans European Airways, a Belgian charter firm,
ordered 12 jets, a mixture of 737-300 and -400 models, said
spokesman John Wheeler.
   Firm orders received during the strike now total 68 aircraft
worth $4.3 billion, boosting total orders for 1989 to 804 planes
worth $42.8 billion. Boeing's firm-order backlog is now 1,653
planes worth about $82 billion, with deliveries stretching into the
late 1990s, Darling said.
   Shrontz said Monday that Boeing would not increase its total
money offer because any boost would jeopardize the company's
competitive position.
   The union represents 57,800 Boeing production workers
nationwide, including 43,300 around Seattle, 12,000 in Wichita,
1,700 in Portland, Ore., and several hundred at sites in
California, Hawaii, Utah, Montana, Wyoming and other states.
   A three-year offer that was rejected in an 85 percent strike
vote Oct. 3 included pay increases of 4 percent, 3 percent and 3
percent; bonuses of 8 percent of gross pay in the first year and 3
percent in the second; cost-of-living increases to cover inflation;
a 20 percent reduction in mandatory overtime; and higher benefits.
   The production-halting strike against the world's largest
commercial airplane builder began Oct. 4. The only talks since then
collapsed after less than four hours last week with no further
meetings scheduled.
   Meanwhile, contract talks with Boeing's second-largest union,
the Seattle Professional Engineering Employees Association resumed
Tuesday.
   Preliminary talks covering 28,000 engineers and technical
workers, about 95 percent in the Seattle area, began Oct. 16 but
broke off later that day with Boeing negotiators complaining of
excessive pay demands.
   Leaders of the association are seeking a three-year pact with
pay raises of 14 percent in the first six months, 5 percent the
second and 4 percent every half-year thereafter for engineers. For
technical workers, the association is seeking 14 percent the first
year and 2 percent every six months thereafter.
   The association's contracts expires Dec. 1. Both sides have said
a strike is unlikely.

<HEAD>Dollar Down, Share Prices Bounce Back</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: New throughout to UPDATE with morning Nikkei, comments.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar was lower against the Japanese yen
Wednesday morning, while share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange
bounced back.
   The dollar was changing hands at 141.63 yen at late morning
after opening at 141.57 yen, down 0.53 yen from Tuesday's
142.10-yen finish. It was moving in the narrow range of 141.55 to
141.75 yen by late Wednesday morning.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues regained 71.90
points, or 0.20 percent, to move to 35,598.45 to end the morning
session. On Tuesday it shed 58.97 points Tuesday.
   The Nikkei rebounded as the yen's recovery against the dollar
reassured Japanese market players, said Yoshiro Inoue, a stock
analyst with Nomura Securities.
   ``Participants bought mainly domestic core industries issues,
including housing, railways and constructions,'' he said.
   ``After the market crash in New York almost two weeks ago
Japanese investors started buying domestic core industry issues and
avoiding import-export related issues, which had been the market
leaders,'' Inoue said.
   In currency dealings, the dollar started lower after a similar
downswing in New York overnight as American investors sold the
currency. The dollar in New York ended at 141.56 yen, down from
141.90 yen the previous day.
   Many Japanese market players expect the dollar to fall more,
considering a recent downtrend in U.S. interest rates, said a
trader with a major Japanese commercial bank, speaking on condition
of anonymity.
   But the dollar was unlikely to fall too quickly because
institutional investors tended to buy the dollar whenever it fell
during trading, he said.
