   Tropical storm-force winds swept the island of
Bermuda on Thursday, forcing boats to stay in port as a weakened
Hurricane Gabrielle approached. Hurricane Felix, meanwhile, dwindled
into a tropical storm.
   Gabrielle was heading due north, with its center passing about
300 miles east of Bermuda late Thursday, forecasters said.
   The hurricane's winds weakened earlier in the day from 135 mph to
105 mph, but then rose by 10:30 p.m. EDT to 110 mph. Little change
in strength was expected for Gabrielle as it headed towards Tropical
Storm Felix.
   ``The winds won't change much until it reaches cooler waters,''
said Bob Sheets, director of the National Hurricane Center.
   Swells in Bermuda's harbors were reported at 10 feet, and the
island's eastern tip reported swells of 15 to 20 feet. The high
seas, combined with winds of 30 to 35 mph, prevented any seagoing
traffic around the island.
   Otherwise, Bermuda's residents were making few preparations for
the storm, Sheets said.
   Strong winds stretched as far as 1,000 miles from Gabrielle's
center, reaching the U.S. East Coast.
   ``A ship 60 miles off the coast of Long Island reported seeing
12- to 15-foot seas,'' Sheets said. High seas were also reported off
the coast of North Carolina.
   At 10:30 p.m. EDT Thursday, Hurricane Gabrielle was centered near
32.6 degrees north latitude and 59.6 degrees west longitude, or 310
miles east of Bermuda. It was traveling north at nearly 17 mph.
   Felix was downgraded from a hurricane to a tropical storm earlier
Thursday as it continued to weaken. The tropical storm posed no
threat to land on its northward trek.
   Forecasters expect Felix to turn toward the northwest and become
engulfed in the larger Gabrielle system. Felix is traveling
northward at 7 mph with winds of 60 mph.
   At 10:30 p.m. EDT Thursday, Felix was located near 41.0 degrees
north latitude and 48.5 degrees west longitude, or about 450 miles
southeast of Cape Race, Newfoundland, in Canada.
   Felix was the sixth and Gabrielle the seventh named storms of the
1989 Atlantic hurricane season. Storms are named when their winds
reach 39 mph, and are classified as hurricanes when they grow to 74
mph.

   A smoky fire touched off by a welder's torch
raced through a new casino under construction Thursday at the
Riviera Hotel and Casino, forcing the evacuation of at least 3,000
gamblers and guests.
   Only two minor injuries were reported in the 10:20 a.m. blaze,
which burned curtains and broke windows in up to 75 rooms in the
hotel before being stopped by automatic sprinklers. Damage was
estimated at about $3.5 million.
   Gamblers and guests were evacuated without incident when smoke
began filling the inside of the resort. The hotel patrons joined
several thousand spectators on the Strip watching the fire, which
was put out in about two hours.
   ``The first thing we did was secure all of the money (in the
casino) and evacuate all the people,'' hotel President Mark Sterbens
said. ``To my knowledge it's the first time we've ever shut down
gambling at the Riviera.''
   Arthur Waltzman, Riviera chairman, said he went floor to floor
with security officers, knocking on doors to alert hotel guests as
corridors filled with smoke.
   ``Everything worked the way it was supposed to work,'' Waltzman
said of the hotel's sprinkler and fire alarm systems.
   The casino, which suffered water damage, reopened about 9 p.m.
Thursday, and a performance by Paul Anka was delayed until 10 p.m.
Hotel officials invited all guests to a free prime rib buffet and
offered them free tickets to Anka's performance.
   The fire blackened the exterior of a section of the original
hotel's nine-story structure built in 1953. The fire reached inside
50 to 75 rooms in the building, fire officials said, before being
stopped by automatic sprinklers.
   The fire began in wooden forms being used to build a new 125,000
square-foot two-story casino touted as the world's largest. The
blaze also spread to the eaves of an existing casino area and burned
part of an outdoor sign on the casino. Embers fanned by 25 mph winds
also crossed the street and briefly set the roof of a motel on fire.
   Two other high-rises at the Riviera, where most of the hotel's
rooms are located, were not affected by the fire but were evacuated
anyway.
   Clark County Fire Department spokesman Bob Leinbach said the
blaze was touched off by welders who were building a swimming pool
on top of the new casino. Leinbach said firefighters later found two
empty fire extinguishers nearby.
   Sterbens said the hotel's 2,200 rooms were sold out. The hotel is
hosting a convention of the American Association of Spinal Cord
Injury Nurses and Psychologists.
   Nevada enacted some of the most stringent fire safety codes in
the nation after a fire at the former MGM Grand Hotel in November of
1980 killed 87 people and a blaze at the Las Vegas Hilton three
months later killed eight people.

<DATELINE>HOT SPRINGS, Ark. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hot Springs has an army of silver-haired
ambassadors who love to brag about mineral springs, pure air and
cheap living in the Ouachita Mountains.
   When a prospective senior settler calls the Greater Hot Springs
Chamber of Commerce-run Retiree Recruitment Office, coordinator Gail
Ezelle unleashes the 150-strong force of volunteers whose enthusiasm
bubbles like this resort's hot spring water.
   Dapper in matching blue blazers, breast pockets adorned with
their names and the city logo, the volunteers court potential new
neighbors with answers about health care, expenses, and recreation.
   They escort guests up the 216-foot Hot Springs Mountain Tower for
a panoramic view, then head downtown for a look at restored
Bathhouse Row. The leisurely tour may end with a meal, or maybe a
sunset cruise aboard a Lake Hamilton party barge.
   The personal pitches have been potent. The office has fielded
more than 6,500 inquiries since it started advertising nationally
last summer; it takes credit for 75 moves. Part of its success comes
from a 1987 Rand-McNally study listing Hot Sprngs as the nation's
third most desirable retirement spot, after the Murray-Kentucky
Lake, Ky., and Clayton-Clarksville, Ga., areas.
   To Mrs. Ezelle, 55, who moved from Texas, recruiting retirees is
just like recruiting an industry. ``They have such a tremendous
economic impact on the community, and they give us expertise and
enthusiasm.''
   But retirees don't bring some of industry's bothersome baggage:
pollution, clogged highways and fluctuating workforces. They arrive
with average assets of $215,000 and average annual incomes of
$33,000, along with taxes and spare time to devote to community
activities. That equates to an annual economic impact of more than
$9 million, the office estimates.
   Mrs. Ezelle praises her volunteer corps, who buy their own
jackets, pay for their own gas and provide any extras, such as lake
cruises or meals. She offers a toll-free telephone line and
complimentary passes to the mountain tower.
   Aggressive retiree recruitment is nothing new. But Hot Springs is
innovating by applying the concept to an existing city instead of a
carefully planned senior citizens development, said aging expert
Charles F. Longino Jr.
   ``Arkansas has been a nice place for people to retire for a long
time, so they have a tradition up there,'' said Longino, associate
director of the Center for Adult Development and Aging at the
University of Miami.
   ``But the difference with Hot Springs is they are really going
after the retirees, instead of letting the retirees come to them.
States have to kind of compete for retirees. They bring expendable
income and lots of advantages. And older people rarely move
someplace where they don't know anybody.''
   That's why volunteers like Dick and Marge Bingham are valuable _
they know what it's like to downshift from a fast-paced working
lifestyle.
   The Binghams moved to Hot Springs in 1987 from Covina, Calif.,
their home for more than three decades. Dick, 57, knew it was time
to get out when his 28-minute commute to a securities office turned
into a 1{-hour headache.
   They were familiar with Arkansas because their daughter and
grandchildren live in Mena, on the state's western edge. A deal on a
lake house clinched the decision. And once Dick unwound after three
months of relaxation, he decided to tell others about Hot Springs.
   Marge, 53, says she was floored by friendliness. ``Out in
California, it was so huge and impersonal. We maybe knew our
neighbors across the street and on either side of us. But here,
we've already got 50 to 100 close friends, and 500 speaking
acquaintances. I love it.''
   Dick Bingham likes to end a recruiting session by inviting guests
onto his party barge, docked a few yards behind his home on Lake
Hamilton. He doffs the blazer, kicks back and steers the vessel
toward the setting sun.
   Marge waves to a passing dinner cruise boat; two dozen strangers
wave back. ``See what I mean? Everybody's friendly. Heck, in
California, if a guy raises his hand like that, he may have a gun in
it.''
   The office generally refrains from bashing other states, but
proudly displayed is a map showing states generating the most
inquiries this year shaded in blue. In descending order, they are
California (400 calls); Illinois (314); New York (291); Texas (265);
and Florida (221).

   Japan's most eligible bachelor, Crown Prince
Naruhito, is looking for a bride, but the heir to the Chrysanthemum
Throne has discovered it's not easy finding a woman both willing and
suited to marry into the world's oldest royal family.
   Four years ago, upon his return from postgraduate history studies
at Oxford University's Merton College, the prince said he would like
to marry by age 30, a milestone he reaches in February.
   But few palace watchers expect the prince to achieve that goal,
despite his obvious assets _ he's the eldest son of Emperor Akihito,
has an excellent education, and enjoys foreign travel.
   Women who appreciate culture might be interested in knowing he
plays the viola. For sporty types, the prince is an avid mountain
climber and enjoys tennis.
   ``We are trying to realize (his marriage) as soon as possible,
but have not yet reached the point where we can speak of any
particulars,'' Iwao Miyao, deputy head of the Imperial Household
Agency, told a parliamentary committee Aug. 29.
   Miyao's comment on Naruhito's nuptial difficulties was prompted
by news a few days earlier that Prince Aya, Naruhito's younger
brother, was engaged and likely to marry first.
   The idea of 23-year-old Aya, second in line to the throne,
marrying before his elder brother was met with considerable
opposition from palace conservatives, one palace source said.
   ``But the crown prince seems to be in no hurry, and hasn't found
the right woman yet,'' the source said, requesting anonymity.
   A formal palace announcement on Aya's engagement will be made
after it is approved by the 10-member Imperial Council, headed by
Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu. It is scheduled to meet Sept. 12.
   Qualifications for women marrying into the imperial family have
eased in recent years, but candidates still can expect their family
histories and personal backgrounds to be thoroughly checked by both
the palace and the media.
   Newspapers dug up high school album photographs of Kiko Kawashima
and even published diagrams of her family tree, complete with
detailed profiles going back four generations when it was discovered
she will marry Aya.
   Miss Kawashima comes from a good, but common, family, they said.
   Her father is a professor of economics at Tokyo's Gakushuin
University, the alma mater of much of Japan's royalty. She has lived
in Austria and the United States.
   Because Naruhito's wife will become empress, his choice will be
subject to much closer scrutiny.
   Descendants of prewar nobility or daughters of leading
industrialists are preferred in prospective princesses, though these
qualifications are not ironclad. A clean bill of health, however, is
a must, as is Japanese citizenship.
   Some experience living abroad, or ability in a foreign language,
is also seen as a plus, since members of the imperial household
often are hosts to foreign dignitaries.
   Attention has focused on three women singled out by the media as
possible mates for Naruhito: Mari Hatano, 23, fluent in French and
English, and a student in Geneva, where she lives with her parents;
Masako Owada, the 25-year-old daughter of a diplomat and a student
in England; and Teruko Kuni, 25, a cousin of the prince.
   But many palace watchers suspect the prince's final choice will
come as a surprise.
   ``The crown prince has a very clear idea of the kind of woman he
wants to marry, and he is too stubborn to just accept whomever the
palace chooses, which was how things used to be done,'' said
Toshiaki Kawahara, a journalist who has written several books on
Japan's imperial family.
   Kawahara said the tradition-minded, strictly regimented life of
the Japanese royal family has frightened away women reared in the
relatively open atmosphere of modern Japan.
   ``Before Empress Michiko married the emperor, she had to go
through hours of `princess studies' every day for three months,'' he
said. ``And because she was not of noble heritage, she had to endure
a good deal of bullying from the old nobility. Her precedent may
scare off other women who could marry into the imperial household.''
   Michiko, the daughter of a wealthy businessman, is the first
commoner to become empress of Japan. She wed Akihito in 1959, when
he was crown prince, and is credited with shrinking the gap known as
the Chrysanthemum Curtain between the public and palace.

   An arson fire caused $5,000 damage to an
abortion clinic that had moved in the hope of escaping further
attention of abortion protesters, authorities said.
   Flammable liquid was thrown against the Allegheny Reproductive
Health Center entrance early Wednesday, then was ignited, said
Deputy Fire Chief John Harper.
   The fire damaged the door, a staircase and an awning, Harper said.
   No arrests were made.
   The building was unoccupied when the fire broke out, said
executive director Claire Keyes.
   ``We're very thankful that there were no injuries when this
terroristic act occurred,'' she said. ``We want to assure our
patients that services will be continuing uninterrupted.''
   During the weekend, the clinic moved from a building across the
street, where several protests had been staged.

   Psychiatrists and psychologists at Hartgrove
Hospital bristle at being called modern-day exorcists, but they're
creating one of the nation's first treatment programs to wean
teen-agers from Satanism.
   ``In no way are we comparable to the old exorcists,'' says
Michael Weiss, an adolescent psychologist at the North Side
hospital, which plans to begin offering the program this month.
   ``The kids who will be admitted will be here primarily because of
their behavioral and emotional problems. No one will be hospitalized
for strange beliefs or unusual values that we would disagree with,''
Weiss said Wednesday.
   ``I don't think there is any doubt Satanism is a growing
problem,'' said social worker Dale Trahan, who has been researching
satanic beliefs for three years and was contracted to organize the
program for Hartgrove's new Center for the Treatment of Ritualistic
Deviance.
   ``We don't know the percentages because so much is secretive, but
we do know ... it is beginning to show up throughout the country,''
Trahan said.
   More such programs will be needed as police, teachers and parents
learn to recognize involvement, said Jerry Simandl, a Chicago police
youth officer and expert on satanic cults, who has helped train
Hartgrove staff.
   ``That's been the problem. There aren't places to take the
kids,'' Simandl said.
   In the program, teen-agers will spend four to eight weeks as
in-patients and undergo individual and group counseling. Most of the
youths will be admitted voluntarily.
   Hartgrove's facility _ to be staffed by specially trained
psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers and nurses _ should
receive its first patients in two to four weeks, and initially will
take as many as six patients at a time, Weiss said. A similar
program exists at Denver's Bethesda PsychHealth.
   The new program will seek to undermine Satanism's underlying
belief system, which hampers conventional treatment.
   Satanism ``gives them the promise of power and privilege beyond
anything they ever imagined. Not only can they have everything they
want ... but can do so while totally indulging themselves in drugs,
sex or any momentary pleasure,'' Weiss said.
   ``We try to help them see how unrealistic the promises are. Our
ultimate goal is to make them able to function in the world so they
can have a reasonable and successful life for themselves and not
harm anyone else.''
   Youngsters involved in Satanism often exhibit unusual behavior,
which can include suicide attempts, violent rages, rejection of
family, drug use, sexual promiscuity, a drastic drop in grades,
intensified rebellion, a strong interest in heavy-metal music,
role-playing games or horror films, and the use of occult symbols
such as ``666'' or upside-down crosses, Trahan said.
   ``They usually are intelligent, creative and bored with
traditional pursuits. They generally have a feeling of being
different and not belonging, are often underachievers and generally
have a feeling of being powerless,'' he said.
   ``One of the problems is helping people see and diagnose the
problem,'' Trahan said. ``Often people with a little bit of
knowledge think they see it everywhere and think if a kid is into
heavy-metal music he must be a Satanist, but that's not true.''

   A 12-year-old boy was arrested in
connection with the fatal stabbing of an elementary school teacher,
police said Wednesday.
   The boy, whose name was not released because of his age, was
being held at Tarrant County Juvenile Detention Center, police said,
but it was not known when he would be formally charged.
   The body of Jana Simpson, 24, was found on stairs outside her
classroom at Glen Park Elementary School on Aug. 28. She had been
stabbed several times in the chest, neck and head. Her purse was
untouched and she did not appear to have been sexually assaulted.
   Police said the boy has admitted he was prowling around the
schoolgrounds when Ms. Simpson was killed and he has given other
details about the crime.
   Police spokesman Doug Clarke on Wednesday night stopped short of
calling the boy's statement a confession.
   ``We feel real confident that we'll have a good case on it,''
Clarke said. ``We really don't have a motive. We feel like she was
just in the wrong place at the wrong time.''
   Immediately after the slaying, police said they were looking for
a teen-ager who was seen in the area.
   Ms. Simpson's brother, Chris Simpson, said he and his family
learned there had been an arrest in the case as they were gathering
Ms. Simpson's belongings at her Fort Worth residence.
   ``We feel a lot better that it wasn't someone who knew Jana,''
said Simpson.
   Fort Worth schools opened Tuesday. A plainclothes police officer
walked the Glen Park campus and teachers were encouraged to discuss
the killing with pupils.
   Ms. Simpson was new to the school, and was to have taught
third-and fourth-graders.

<HEAD>Strike Accord Seen as Blow to Union Corruption in Mexico</HEAD>

   U.S. assembly plants, back in operation
after winning a three-week labor dispute, have blazed the trail for
other companies to fight the extraordinary power labor unions hold
in Mexico, industry spokesmen say.
   A union power struggle that shut down 15 American plants known as
maquiladoras in the border city of Reynosa ended with labor and
government officials agreeing Aug. 18 to let the workers form a
union independent of the nationally powerful Mexican Workers
Federation whose local representative forced the workers to strike.
   ``It definitely means that companies can take a stand against
illegal activities and corruption and be successsul,'' said Don
King, manager for Reynosa's West Bend plant.
   ``We blazed a new trail.''
   The strike was settled after intervention of President Carlos
Salinas de Gortari's government in Mexico City.
   Salinas has made clear he will not let unions stand in the way of
his goal of modernizing the Mexican economy and attracting more
foreign investors.
   ``The Salinas government has acted in a certain direction to
remove as much of the corruption as it possibly can,'' said Arnold
Kezsbom, president of the New York-based Service Manufacturing Corp.
whose Reynosa plant was closed in the strike.
   ``He doesn't want to have the negative publicity that occurred
out of this permeate throughout the world. The issue was the
expansion of the maquiladora industry in Mexico.''
   Maquiladoras, in which foreign-owned companies take advantage of
cheap Mexican labor to produce goods for sale in their own countries
or elsewhere, have become a top foreign income earner for Mexico.
   The industry, which generated $2.3 billion in foreign currency
last year, has grown by more than 70 percent since 1985 and employs
about 392,000 people, mainly along the U.S.-Mexican border.
   The strike cost an estimated $500,000 a day in lost production,
but plant managers said it was worth it because the outcome was
favorable to them.
   Although the plant workers indicated no great sympathy for a
walkout, they went on strike July 25 on the orders of Rafael
Morales, a local leader of the powerful Mexican Workers Federation.
   Strike flags were hoisted. Traditionally in Mexico, workers who
violate strike flags face severe consequences, including possible
physical harm, immediately or later.
   The plants, nevertheless, continued to pay the workers their
wages and benefits, averaging about $1.20 a hour, during the strike.
   Kezsbom said the American managers resisted Morales, who controls
most of the labor contracts at Reynosa's 27 other maquiladoras,
because they considered him corrupt.
   Morales forced companies to give him control of trucking
contracts, waste disposal and scrap resale, and to issue food
coupons good only at stores he controls. The coupons are part of the
employee benefit packages.
   The nearly 2,000 workers at the plants Morales shut down waited
for two weeks while plant managers and business leaders pleaded with
the federal government in Mexico City to step in.
   Then, frustrated by government inaction, about 900 workers ripped
down the strike flags, stormed back into their plants and went to
work.
   That same day Interior Secretary Fernando Gutierrez Barrios met
with industry leaders in Mexico City and promised the government
would intervene.
   Gov. Americo Villarreal of Tamaulipas summoned the managers to a
meeting in the state capital, Ciudad Victoria, the next day to work
out an accord giving the plant workers the right to form an
independent union.
   The agreement surprised those familiar with the strength of the
Mexican Workers Federation, the nation's largest labor organization
and a powerful sector of the governing Institutional Revolutionary
Party.
   Although the agreement stipulates that only workers from the
affected 15 plants can join the independent union, industry
spokesmen say it may open a new era of labor relations in Tamaulipas
and other Mexican states with maquiladora plants.

   From the green hills of Arkansas to the
granite faces of Mount Rushmore, Brutus the traveling dog has seen
it all _ from the back of a motorcycle.
   Brutus, a 70-pound mix of boxer and Labrador retriever, has
traveled 25,000 miles during the past year standing on the trailer
of a motorcycle driven by Kent Wassenberg.
   Wassenberg, of Marysville, Kan., said the former stray dog hopped
on his bike about two years ago.
   ``I don't tell him to get on. I just hook up the trailer and he
knows it's time to go and gets up there,'' Wassenberg said. ``He
stands up the whole time. Sometimes he takes a break and sits when I
stop at a stoplight or get gas.''
   Brutus wears goggles to protect his eyes and a hooded sweatshirt
when the temperature drops below 30 degrees. A harness keeps him
hitched to the trailer.
   ``He actually prefers to ride on the gas tank, but many states
are against that because he could obscure my vision,'' Wassenberg
said during a recent stop in Joplin en route to Arkansas on a
sightseeing trip.
   Brutus has made two trips with Wassenberg to motorcycle rallies
at Sturgis, S.D. They make weekend jaunts of several hundred miles
through Missouri and Arkansas.

   Anyone who has seen ``Nightmare on Elm Street''
horror movies knows fiendish Freddy Krueger is no doll. But a toy
company has sweet dreams about sales of a new talking doll version
of the popular movie villain.
   Matchbox Toys (USA) Ltd. Wednesday announced creation of a
17-inch-tall, bendable doll based on the Freddy Krueger character
with a repertoire of six ghoulish sayings.
   Pull a string and the Freddy doll spouts phrases such as
``Pleasant dreams,'' ``Watch Out, Freddy's back'' or the character's
trademark diabolical laugh.
   The doll, which will sell for about $25, will be available in
stores for Halloween sales.
   ``Freddy Krueger has translated nightmares into a dream
business,'' said Gene Morra, senior director of marketing at
Matchbox. ``We've known the talking doll business and we hope to do
well with Freddy because we know when Freddy talks, people listen,''
Morra said in a news release.

   Nevada, home of easy divorce, legalized
gambling and prostitution, isn't a blot on the nation and should be
proud of its unique heritage, says the producer of a video history
of the state.
   The video will be the cornerstone of a year-long celebration of
the Silver State's 125th birthday, and is being paid for by a
$50,000 grant the Nevada Bell telephone company presented Wednesday
to Gov. Bob Miller.
   ``Actually, we're treating this anniversary celebration as a
sophisticated educational campaign,'' producer Norm Neilson said.
   ``Some writers have referred to Nevada as a blot on the nation,''
Neilson said. He said the video would dispel those impressions and
show ``it was just frontier values'' that paved the way for
legalized prostitution, gambling and quickie divorces.
   On Oct. 31, 1864, Nevada became the 36th state in the union.

   A spokesman for former Philippine President
Ferdinand Marcos quit his job and returned to Manila on Wednesday,
giving up his appeal for political asylum in the United States.
   Guillermo ``Gemmo'' Trinidad, 45, was media spokesman since
shortly after Marcos was exiled here in February 1986. Trinidad left
Honolulu for Manila early Wednesday, after visiting his parents and
son in Los Angeles.
   Trinidad entered the United States in March 1986 on a tourist
visa.
   After the Immigration and Naturalization Service began
deportation proceedings against him last January for overstaying the
visa, Trinidad applied for political asylum, claiming his life would
be in danger in the Philippines now that Marcos foe Corazon Aquino
is president.
   A hearing on the appeal was scheduled for later this month.
   Although he still fears persecution, Trinidad said personal
problems, including a recent divorce, prompted his decision to go
home.
   ``I believe the emotional problems caused by the divorce have
caused me to be less effective as spokesman,'' he said. ``I'm still
a bit apprehensive about what will greet me, but if I get arrested,
it will help my colleagues.''
   Several other Marcos aides seek political asylum here.
   Trinidad was married in 1978 and divorced last January. His
ex-wife, Norma, will remain in the United States, as will their
8{-year-old son, Juan Reynaldo, Trinidad said.
   Tomas ``Buddy'' Gomez, Philippine consul general here, called
Trinidad's fears of persecution ``preposterous'' and said many
Marcos allies prosper in the Philippines.
   Trinidad said he would work for an export company in Manila, as
well as write a twice-monthly column for a Filipino newspaper in Los
Angeles. He's also working on a book detailing his years with the
Marcoses.
   Near the end of Marcos' 20-year rule, Trinidad was a regional
director in the Ministry of Human Settlements, then headed by
Marcos' wife, Imelda.
   The Marcoses are under U.S. indictment for allegedly stealing
nearly $200 million from their homeland and stashing it in the
United States. The U.S. government has filed a companion civil
lawsuit, so that claims against them can continue if the 71-year-old
Marcos dies. He has been hospitalized here for the past eight months
and remained in critical condition Wednesday.
   Although Mrs. Marcos has said the U.S. and Philippine
governments' freeze on many of the couple's vast assets made it
difficult to pay bills, Trinidad said he got a regular ``allowance''
and money played no part in his decision.
   Mrs. Marcos downplayed reports that Trinidad left because of
increasing tension between him and other members of the Marcos
entourage, including Ferdinand Marcos Jr.
   ``Gemmo is a good guy,'' said Mrs. Marcos. ``He can always come
back and he still has my trust.''
   His attorney, Ronald Oldenburg, said Trinidad withdrew the
application for political asylum Tuesday and the INS granted him a
voluntary departure order, meaning the deportation proceedings would
be suspended.
   The INS said Trinidad could apply for a new visa if he wants to
return to the United States.

   The conviction of a billionaire drug kingpin
whose arrest in his native Honduras sparked a week of riots there is
a big victory in the war on drugs, federal prosecutors said.
   Jurors on Wednesday found Juan Ramon Matta Ballesteros guilty of
masterminding a California drug ring linked to a Colombian cocaine
cartel.
   After the conviction, U.S. Attorney Gary Feess described the
45-year-old Matta as ``one of the most significant narcotics
traffickers in the world today.''
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Jimmy Gurule said the federal court
jury's decision was a message to the Colombian government ``that if
they extradite drug kingpins we will prosecute them to the full
extent of the law.''
   Matta could be sentenced to life imprisonment without possibility
of parole, Feess said. Sentencing is scheduled for Oct. 5.
   Matta led a powerful cocaine cartel based in Cali, Colombia, that
funneled thousands of pounds of the drug to Arizona and Southern
California through Mexico, Feess said.
   He compared Matta's power to that of Carlos Lehder Rivas, the
Colombian drug lord convicted earlier this year in Miami.
   ``The conviction of Ballesteros is a major blow to the gangsters
who run the international drug rings,'' Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh said in a statement from Washington.
   The jury convicted Matta on one count each of conspiracy, running
a continuing criminal enterprise and possession with intent to
distribute cocaine and four counts of distribution of cocaine.
   Matta's lawyer, Martin Stolar, said he will file motions to have
the verdict overturned and, failing that, will appeal. He insisted
that the case was prejudiced by publicity surrounding the
U.S.-Colombian anti-drug campaign and President Bush's speech
Tuesday night.
   Stolar said he asked Bush to delay his address but received no
response. He maintained that Matta was a legitimate businessman and
Honduras' largest single employer. He said Matta's fortune came from
cattle ranching, construction and the tobacco, coffee and spice
trade.
   The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, however, said Matta
controlled a narcotics empire worth up to $2 billion. He was accused
of overseeing a network that distributed $72 million worth of
cocaine in Los Angeles.
   The case against Matta stemmed from a September 1981 raid on a
Van Nuys apartment complex, where $1.9 million in cash and 114
pounds of cocaine were sezied. At that time, that was the largest
seizure of cocaine in California history.
   Matta became a folk hero to his impoverished neighbors in
Honduras where he granted loans, bought desks for school children
and employed about 800 people on his tobacco and dairy farms. His
extradition triggered outrage in Tegucigalpa where 2,000
demonstrators burned the U.S. Embassy annex. Five Hondurans died in
the week-long violence.

<HEAD>Man Trails Actress, Threatens Suicide Outside Theater</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BERKELEY, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man who had been following actress
Justine Bateman, former star of the television series ``Family
Ties,'' was arrested Wednesday after threatening suicide at a
theater where she was appearing, police said.
   John Thomas Smetek, 39, was taken into custody about three hours
after he appeared outside the Berkeley Repertory Theater holding a
loaded revolver to his abdomen, said police Lt. Robert Peters.
   Bateman, 23, best known for her television role as Mallory
Keaton, appeared in the title role of the theater's production of
``Lulu'' at its premiere Wednesday night.
   Smetek, who will undergo a psychiatric evaluation at Highland
Hospital, had been trailing Bateman for months and maintained that
the two shared an intimate relationship, Peters said. ``He just
wants to talk with her and indicate his love-fixation with her,''
Peters said.
   Theater workers first noticed Smetek about 10 a.m. sitting on a
bench in the theater's courtyard. He was holding a .22-caliber
Magnum revolver to his chest, said Berkeley Rep spokesman Richard
Griffoul.
   Another theater worker told police Smetek threatened to kill
himself.
   A team of about 10 police officers and mental health officials
negotiating with Smetek persuaded to take the cocked gun away from
his abdomen and tuck it in his waistband, said Peters.
   At about 12:30 p.m., Smetek surrendered to authorities without
incident, Peters said.
   Smetek was taken to the Hall of Justice, where investigators
arrested him for investigation of possession of a loaded firearm
within city limits and two felony counts of displaying a firearm.
   They were reviewing Smetek's criminal record and also considering
a possible harassment charge, Peters said.
   Bateman's concern about Smetek was raised following two
incidents, which were not described, on the ``Family Ties'' set at
Paramount Studios earlier this year, said the actress' publicist,
Cindy Guagenti.
   ``Justine was aware that he was pursuing her and took the
situation seriously,'' said Guagenti. ``She contacted the police in
Berkeley when she found out he was up there. And she hired a private
security firm.''
   Bateman and theater officials said a temporary restraining order
against Smetek is scheduled to take effect Thursday.
   The slaying of actress Rebecca Schaeffer on July 18, allegedly by
an obsessed fan, has heightened celebrities' uneasiness about
mentally unstable fans.

   Anne Pollard, the wife of convicted spy
Jonathan Pollard, has been denied early parole on her conviction as
his accessory, but will probably be released in 1990, a federal
official said Wednesday.
   In denying Mrs. Pollard's request, Daniel Lopez, regional parole
commissioner, accepted a recommendation made last month by a board
of examiners.
   Mrs. Pollard was sentenced March 4, 1987, to five years in prison
as an accessory after the fact in her husbad's case. Her husband is
serving a life sentence at the federal prison at Marion, Ill., for
selling secrets to Israel while he worked as an intelligence analyst
with the U.S. Navy.
   Mrs. Pollard has been earning a 10-day-per-month reduction in her
sentence for good behavior and probably will be released at the end
of March 1990, Joseph Kravisky, a U.S. Parole Commission spokesman
in Washington, said Wednesday.
   Mrs. Pollard is at the federal penitentiary in Danbury, Conn.,
which is part of the Philadelphia region of the U.S. Parole
Commission. Her first appeal for parole was denied last year.

   The governing party suffered
its worst election setback in 41 years of power on Wednesday, losing
nearly a quarter of its parliamentary seats to far-right and
anti-apartheid rivals.
   Riot squads with whips, tear gas and shotguns dispersed blacks
protesting their exclusion from the balloting, and police said more
than 50 people were arrested. Anti-apartheid leaders, who called a
general strike, said 3 million people stayed away from jobs and
classes.
   It appeared, with just four of 166 districts undecided, that the
National Party would retain 93 or 94 of its previous 123 seats. The
far-right Conservative Party improved from 22 to 39 seats and the
liberal Democratic Party moved from 20 to 33 seats, the most ever
for an anti-apartheid faction.
   With his party narrowly retaining its majority in Parliament,
National Party leader and acting President F.W. de Klerk is expected
to be chosen by an electoral college next week to serve a five-year
term as president.
   He described the results as ``a clear mandate'' for his party's
plans for gradual political reform and contended that both
opposition parties had little chance for further growth.
   Independent commentators said it was the first time since 1953
that the National Party failed to get a majority of the popular
vote. The Nationalists won about 48 percent of the vote, to 31
percent for the Conservatives and 21 percent for the Democrats.
   About 69 percent of the 3,160,667 registered white voters turned
out for the election.
   The Conservatives, who favor stricter racial segregation, lost by
just five votes in Vereeniging, former district of de Klerk, who was
not a parliamentary candidate.
   Foreign Minister Pik Botha and Defense Minister Magnus Malan were
re-elected by margins sharply lower than in the white election of
1987. The Conservatives won their first-ever seats in Pretoria, the
capital, and in Cape Province and the Orange Free State.
   The election was widely viewed as among the most important in
history for the whites who control South Africa. It gave white
voters the choice of stating that they want to strengthen apartheid,
eliminate it or take a middle course.
   The amount of support for the other parties was expected to
influence the National Party in deciding whether to speed up or slow
down its program of limited political reform.
   Voting stations around the country were heavily guarded. Armored
vehicles patrolled some mixed-race townships, which were enveloped
in smoke from burning street barricades.
   Also at stake were seats in mixed-race and Indian chambers, which
were established in 1984 and have little power. Blacks, who
outnumber whites more than 5-1, have no voice in national affairs.
   Anti-apartheid activists called for a boycott of the non-white
elections.
   Of the nation's 37 million people, 5 million are white, 28
million black, about 3 million of mixed race and nearly 1 million of
Indian descent.
   The campaign platform of de Klerk called for limited black
participation at the national level within five years.
   He is depicted as more flexible than his predecessor, President
P.W. Botha, but supports segregation of schools and neighborhoods
and rejects a one-person, one-vote system leading to black majority
rule.
   The Conservative Party opposes political concessions to blacks
and favors comprehensive racial segregation. The Democratic Party
wants an immediate end to segregation and a vote of equal weight for
every South African.
   In the five weeks before the election, anti-apartheid groups
mounted an unprecedented defiance campaign, in many cases provoking
violent response by police.
   Riot squads have used shotguns, water cannons, tear gas, clubs
and dogs against anti-election marches, campus rallies and church
meetings. More than 2,000 people have been arrested for disobeying
laws that segregate hospitals, beaches and buses, and for defying
restrictions on speech and political activity.
   Desmond Tutu, the black Anglican archbishop and anti-apartheid
leader, said of the election: ``I'm not paying a great deal of
attention. I'm more interested in how many people stay away.
   ``I would hope that white South Africans would be aware that the
bulk of the people in this country are not voting, and they should
join us in getting rid of the system.''
   Black worker absenteeism ranged from about 70 percent in the
industrial heartland around Pretoria and Johannesburg to virtually
100 percent in the eastern Cape province cities of Port Elizabeth
and Uitenhage, labor experts at Johannesburg's University of the
Witwatersrand reported. Most mines operated normally, but all motor
vehicle plants were shut down.
   Officials said registered voters included 665,870 Indians and
1.77 million people of mixed race.

   The addict slips the needle into his scarred
arm and drives down the plunger, or flares a crack-filled pipe and
inhales the heated vapor.
   In both cases, the cocaine hits the brain within seconds, giving
the user sensations of pleasure that some have said is like no other
high.
   But the pleasure lasts only 10 to 20 minutes, followed quickly by
a ``crash'' and a relentless, ignore-all-else craving to get high
again.
   It's that cycle of ecstasy, depression and renewed craving for
euphoria that makes cocaine and crack among the most habit-forming
drugs. And, experts say, medical science has not found a treatment
that can be applied universally to break the cycle of dependency.
   ``Cocaine is clearly a very addictive drug because it is the most
reinforcing and pleasurable of the abused drugs,'' said Dr. Jack
Blaine, chief of the treatment branch at the National Institute on
Drug Abuse. ``As yet, we don't have any good, solid research on
successful crack or cocaine treatment.''
   Both cocaine and crack, a crystallized form of cocaine that is
smoked, work directly on the brain.
   It's believed the drug causes protein molecules called
neuroreceptors to ignite sensations of pleasure and send pulses of
euphoria along nerve pathways time after time after time.
Eventually, the molecules are absorbed and the effects diminish. For
the user, there's a letdown and then, quickly, a desire for more of
the drug.
   That, Blaine said, is a cycle of reinforcement that makes cocaine
so dangerous.
   By some estimates, almost half of all cocaine users quickly slip
from casual use into an uncontrolled craving. And an even higher
percentage of crack users quickly become addicts.
   ``Crack may be the most euphoric of all the drugs,'' said Dr.
Herbert Kleber, a former Yale researcher who is with the National
Drug Control Policy office.
   ``It is intensely pleasurable. It wears off very quickly and puts
the user back to not feeling good. And the body has no barrier to
its use.''
   Those who inhale powdered cocaine are limited by the amount the
nose will absorb, Kleber said, and those who inject the drug
eventually run out of veins. But the lungs have a virtually
unlimited ability to absorb crack smoke, he said.
   Success in treating addiction, he said, depends to a large degree
on who is being treated.
   ``Some need only rehabilitation,'' he said. ``Give me an employed
(professional) and I will have 60 to 70 percent success. In a year,
he'll be off the drug.''
   But for addicts living in poverty, particularly in the inner
city, there are few positive elements to provide an incentive to
stay away from cocaine. Drugs in such neighborhoods often are viewed
as an industry and an economic opportunity for the young to gain
wealth quickly.
   ``For those in the inner city, you have to address not just the
drug, but the whole lifestyle,'' Kleber said. ``First they have to
be off the drug. Then they have to get the skills to stay off it.''
   That must include medical care, housing, education and vocational
training.
   And ``when they go back into the community there's got to be a
strong support system, a drug-free network'' to reinforce the new
way of life, he said.
   Meanwhile, scientists are searching for a medication to help wean
addicts from cocaine.
   ``This is not an area yet where we have good clinical science,''
said Dr. Donald R. Jasinski, chief of a chemical dependency clinic
at Francis Scott Key Medical Center, which is affiliated with Johns
Hopkins University Medical School in Baltimore.
   Finding a cocaine substitute, he said, ``is going to be very
important'' in finding the best way to control cocaine.
   ``Within two or three years, we should have a major medication to
help us,'' Kleber said. ``But I can't see any of these being a magic
bullet'' that will automatically stop the craving or provide an
effortless cure.
   ``It's not going to be that easy,'' he said.

<HEAD>Fungicide Voluntarily Withdrawn Due to Possible Cancer Risk</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A widely used class of fungicides is being
taken off the market voluntarily for dozens of crops _ from apples
to cucumbers _ because government tests indicate a higher risk of
cancer than may be acceptable.
   The three manufacturers of the fungicide EBDC announced Wednesday
they are curtailing the use of the chemical ``to maintain public
confidence'' in the food products involved. However, they maintained
the chemical is safe for consumers if used properly.
   EBDC, or ethylene bisdithiocarbamate, has been under a special
review by the Environmental Protection Agency since 1987 because a
breakdown product from the chemical has been shown to cause cancer
in test animals.
   The agency recently informed the companies of preliminary cancer
risk estimates that likely would require curbs on the use of EBDC on
some food products, according to agency documents obtained by The
Associated Press.
   The fungicide has been used for nearly 40 years to combat mildew
and mold on more than 70 different food crops including apples,
potatoes, tomatoes, sweet corn, onions, mushrooms, carrots, grapes,
lettuce and citrus fruits, among others.
   In a joint announcement the three manufacturers _ the Du Pont
Co., Pennwalt Corp. and Rohm &amp; Haas Co. _ said Wednesday they will
discontinue sales of the chemical for use on all but 13 food
products.
   The manufacturers maintained that use of the chemical _ if
applied properly _ poses no health concerns, but said ``the
theoretical risks'' that are being reviewed by the EPA in connection
with use on some products ``unnecessarily raises questions about the
safety of this entire class of fungicides.''
   Such concerns have been heightened since the uproar earlier this
year over the pesticide Alar. While the EPA did not formally order
Alar off the market, its link to cancer and the widespread publicity
over its use on apples earlier this year caused the sale of apple
products to plummet, costing the apple industry tens of millions of
dollars.
   The manufacturer of Alar subsequently stopped selling the
pesticide in the United States to calm consumer fears.
   EPA spokesman John Kasper confirmed that the agency is preparing
to announce some curbs on the use of EBDC because of the latest
cancer risk data on some food crops.
   ``We've got some risk estimates that we're concerned about,''
said Kasper. He said the agency will review the voluntary withdrawal
of the chemical for some foods and determine whether that is
adequate.
   But, according to EPA documents, agency tests show that the
cancer risks posed by EBDC residues on some foods were many times
the one in 1 million level the agency uses to indicate negligible
risk.
   In the case of tomatoes the risk was found to be 63 times the
one-in-a-million risk level which the EPA considers negligible. For
apples it was 150 times that benchmark, according to the documents.
   By comparison, the EPA estimated risk estimate for Alar on
applies earlier this yeas was 45 times the one-in-a-million
benchmark.
   EPA spokesman Albert Heier emphasized that the risk figures EBDC
were preliminary and assumed crop residues at the maximum level of
application according to manufacturers' instructions.
   The companies are conducting marketbasket studies to determine
actual exposure to consumers since the chemical is known to decay
with time and residues likely will be reduced through handling,
processing and washing.
   Although the manufacturers' announcement named no food products,
an environmental group, the Natural Resources Defense Council, said
the 13 crops for which EBDC will continue to be used include
potatoes, sugar beets, sweet corn, tomatoes and wheat and almonds.
   Janet Hathaway, an attorney for the environmental group, called
the voluntary withdrawal of the chemical from many food crops ``an
unprecedented and responsible step'' in that it comes even before
the EPA has proposed curbs on the fungicide's uses.
   But Ms. Hathaway maintained that the chemical continues to pose
significant health risks in some of the foods for which it has not
been withdrawn ``particularly foods like bananas, grapes and
potatoes which are consumed in large quantities by children.''

<TEXT>
   The evacuation of the last U.S. diplomats
from Beirut marks a milestone in 30 years of American involvement in
turbulent Lebanon.
   Washington's envoys had clung tenaciously to the war-battered
capital despite the assassination of one U.S. ambasador, the suicide
car bombings of two embassy buildings, the abductions of Americans
and murderous artillery barrages.
   But on Wednesday, Ambassador John McCarthy and his 29 remaining
American staff members slipped out of the country aboard three U.S.
Navy helicopters amid mounting criticism from militant pro-Western
Christians.
   The Christian standard-bearer, army commander Gen. Michel Aoun,
had charged that Washington has ``sold Lebanon to Syria'' out of
fear for the lives of eight Americans held hostage by pro-Iranian
zealots.
   But U.S. State Department Spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler angrily
blamed the evacuation on Aoun, saying he had threatened to expose
McCarthy and his staff to a ``good dose of Christian terrorism.''
   She said that before the evacuation, an unidentified telephone
caller had threatened to shoot down a U.S. helicopter that brought
supplies to the hilltop embassy compound in east Beirut's Christian
suburb of Aukar.
   Aoun's supporters besieged the embassy on Tuesday and Ms.
Tutwiler said an unidentified leader of the protest had warned that
embassy employees moved in and out of the premises ``at their own
risk.''
   The protesters called off the siege hours after the evacuation.
   It is the first time that an American ambassador has been pulled
from Beirut since Lebanon's civil war between Moslems and Christians
began in 1975.
   U.S. officials were at pains to point out that American diplomats
would return to the Mediterranean country as soon as conditions
permit, but there was no sign that this would be any time soon.
   Observers in Beirut said the American pullout would escalate the
nearly 6-month-old confrontation between Aoun's 20,000 mainly
Christian troops and 40,000 Syrian soldiers based in Lebanon's
Moslem areas.
   The fear is that the Syrians could be encouraged by the U.S.
withdrawal to step up their military pressure on Aoun's forces in
the besieged Christian enclave north of Beirut.
   Aoun's troops have been locked in savage artillery duels with the
Syrians and their Druse Moslem allies since March 8. The battles
have killed 828 people, wounded 2,455 and forced many of Beirut's
1.5 million residents to flee the city.
   Syria intervened in 1976 under an Arab League mandate to stop the
civil war. But Aoun, who heads a Christian military Cabinet in
Lebanon's splintered government, contends the Syrians betrayed their
mission by supporting the Moslems.
   Aoun declared a ``war of liberation'' March 14 to drive the
Syrians out. They retaliated by blockading and ruthlessly shelling
the Christian enclave.
   McCarthy, whose mansion in suburban Yarze was frequently hit by
Syrian shellfire, has been outspokenly critical of Syria's actions
and repeatedly urged Damascus to begin a dialogue with Aoun.
   But the 54-year-old Maronite Catholic general said McCarthy's
behests were merely ``lip service'' and demanded full U.S.
recognition of him as the legitimate prime minister of Lebanon.
   McCarthy came to Lebanon late in September 1988. But he did not
present his credentials pending the election of a new head of state
to succeed former President Amin Gemayel, whose six-year term
expired that month.
   McCarthy's move was designed to avoid recognizing either Aoun's
Cabinet, which was formed by Gemayel minutes before he bowed out, or
that of acting Prime Minister Salim Hoss, a Sunni Moslem.
   The power struggle between the two Cabinets has deepened the de
facto partition of the country into sectarian mini-states.
   The evacuation of McCarthy and his staff was carried out with
surgical precision. Two helicopters landed at the embassy compound
at first light and took off with all 30 people within five minutes.
A third gunship flew cover, witnesses reported.
   Nearly 540 Lebanese guards and administrative employees were left
in control of the embassy and of the ambassador's residence in Yarze.
   U.S. involvement in Lebanon began July 15, 1958, when President
Dwight D. Eisenhower sent Marines to Beirut at the request of
Christian President Camille Chamoun to quell an uprising by
Chamoun's Moslem rivals.
   Civil war broke out in 1975 and the following year Moslem
radicals kidnapped and murdered U.S. Ambassador Francis Melloy along
with his economic counselor Robert Waring.
   With the war, Yasser Arafat's Palestine Liberation Organization
became the dominant force in Lebanon's Moslem areas. That lasted
until Israel invaded in June 1982.
   In August of that year, 800 U.S. Marines, part of a 5,400-man
peacekeeping force with British, French and Italian units, went
ashore to oversee the evacuation of Israeli, Syrian and PLO forces
from Beirut.
   The U.S. force was later increased to 1,800 men.
   In April 1983, a Shiite Moslem suicide bomber rammed an
explosives-packed van into the seaside U.S. Embassy in west Beirut,
killing 63 people, including 17 Americans.
   The worst was yet to come.
   On Oct. 23, 1983, another Shiite suicide bomber attacked the U.S.
Marine base near Beirut airport, killing 241 men, and a second
bomber attacked a French paratroopers' base, killing 58 men.
   In December, American reconnaisance planes were fired on and the
United States responded with a Naval fighter-bomber attack that
inflicted ``significant damage'' on Syrian missile and artillery
batteries in Lebanon.
   A few days later, the battleship USS New Jersey bombarded Moslem
positions with 250 shells from its 16-inch guns.
   But in February 1984, as the civil war erupted anew, the Marines
were pulled back to warships off Beirut, a move that marked the
beginning of their final withdrawal after a 22-month peacekeeping
operation in which 264 U.S. servicemen were killed.
   In September 1984 a suicide bomber hit the U.S. embassy annex in
Christian east Beirut, killing 12 people and wounding 96, including
the U.S. ambassador. It was this compound that was evacuated
Wednesday.

<HEAD>Kabuki Troupe Opens in Met Opera House</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Stands for PMs.</HEAD>

   Americans who only occasionally see Japanese
kabuki theater may not find Ennosuke's Kabuki as controversial as
publicity before its appearances here and in Washington has led them
to expect.
   Except for some acrobatics, quick costume changes and one exit on
wires through the sky, at Wednesday's first of eight performances at
the Metropolitan Opera, Ennosuke's Kabuki seemed largely to follow
kabuki's traditions such as stylized fights and poses held a moment
to increase tension. The troupe later will perform at Kennedy Center.
   The most remarkable aspect of Ennosuke's Kabuki is its leading
actor, Ichikawa Ennosuke III, who has organized this company of 36
actors and 24 musicians.
   Two pieces are done at each performance, which lasts three and a
half hours, longer than many Americans wish an evening of theater to
last.
   The first is three acts from ``Yoshitsune Senbonzakura,'' an
eight-hour, six-act play which was first done in 1747 with puppets
and adapted to kabuki the following year. In it, Ennosuke plays two
parts, Tadanobu, a warrior faithful to a hero and a fox who has
transformed himself to look like the warrior. The fox did it, the
audience learns, to be near Tadanobu's lover who has a drum made of
the skin of his parents. This illustrates fillial piety.
   Ennosuke, who is 49, is young enough to jump up a flight of steps
two at a time, vault off the back of a porch and crawl under it,
emerging at the front in white fox fur. But more remarkable than
that is the difference in stance the actor has for Tadanobu and for
the fox as Tadanobu, when his hands subtly become paws and his head
is held less militarily.
   Some kabuki companies' strongest actors play young women.
However, the actor playing Tadanobu's lover was simpering and whiney.
   In the second play, ``Kurozuka,'' Ennosuke played an old woman,
actually a demon, whose soul is soothed by a Buddhist priest who
says that even demons can find enlightenment. Ennosuke does a gentle
dance in what looks like a corn field, including deep breaths of
relief.
   Then a comic character, played by Ennosuke's younger brother,
blunders and Ennosuke becomes a demon with red tongue and deep,
angry voice.
   In other kabuki troupes visiting here, older actors have made
characters like the old woman more poignant. But Ennosuke's old
woman isn't superficial. One would like to see his troupe again and
him again, as he deepens farther in conveying human emotion.
   Viewers could rent an apparatus to place in one ear, for English
summary and commentary, while allowing the rise and fall of the
Japanese voices to be heard with the other ear.

<HEAD>NBC News Special `Bad Girls' Makes TV Top 10</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY BUCK</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``Bad Girls,'' a news special on juvenile
delinquents, helped NBC extend its prime-time Nielsen ratings streak
to 63 weeks in a week dominated by sitcoms.
   ``Bad Girls,'' reported by NBC correspondent Deborah Norville,
tied for seventh place with ABC's ``Who's the Boss?'' It was the
only original show in last week's top 10 during this summer rerun
period.
   ABC's ``Roseanne'' was first again in the A.C. Nielsen Co.
survey, followed by NBC's ``Cheers.''
   Fox Broadcasting Co.'s highest-rated show, ``Married...With
Children,'' dropped from 17th to 41st place. Still, most of the Fox
shows were able to hold their newfound positions in the middle of
the ratings.
   NBC extended its record streak at the top with an average
prime-time rating of 10.6. ABC's average was 9.7 and CBS' was 9.0.
   The rating point is the percentage of the nation's estimated 90.4
million homes with televisions.
   The first of the new fall shows for the three networks will make
its appearance this week. CBS' ``Rescue: 911'' had its premiere on
Tuesday. Next week, five more shows will make their debut, and the
fall season begins Sept. 18. Fox has gotten an early start with some
of its shows.
   NBC last week had seven of the top 10 shows. CBS once again
failed to make the top 10. Its highest-rated show was ``Designing
Women'' in 13th place.
   Here are the top 10: ABC's ``Roseanne,'' NBC's ``Cheers,'' ``The
Cosby Show,'' ``A Different World'' and ``Dear John,'' ABC's ``The
Wonder Years,'' NBC News special ``Bad Girls'' and ABC's ``Who's the
Boss?'' tied, NBC's ``Golden Girls'' and NBC's ``Empty Nest'' and
ABC's ``Anything But Love,'' tied.
   ABC was first among the evening news shows with a rating of 9.1.
CBS had a 9.0 and NBC 8.6.
   ``The Joan Rivers Show,'' a new syndicated daytime talk show,
made its premier Tuesday with good ratings in the Nielsen
overnights. It was first in six of 13 cities, according to Tribune
Entertainment.

   Former Laker Girl Paula Abdul's
energetic ``Straight Up'' video won four trophies at the sixth
annual MTV Video Music Awards as Madonna claimed the Viewers' Choice
and three technical honors Wednesday night.
   ``I owe a lot to being a Laker Girl,'' Abdul, who began her
career as a cheerleader for the National Basketball Association team
here, said backstage at the Universal Amphitheatre. ``It was a great
vehicle to start off.''
   Abdul's video, which drew on cheerleading dance styles, took best
female video, dance, choreography and editing.
   Veteran rocker Neil Young earned best video for the satirical
``This Note's For You,'' which MTV once banned from broadcast,
ostensibly because it contained commercial messages. The video
satirized rock star endorsements of products, and featured Michael
Jackson and Whitney Houston lookalikes.
   Madonna, who was nominated six times, got the Viewer's Choice
award for ``Like a Prayer.'' Her ``Express Yourself'' video earned
direction honors for David Fincher, the art direction trophy for
Vance Lorenzini, and best cinematography for Mark Plummer.
   ``I guess this means you like me, you really like me,'' the
singer said after receiving her Viewers Choice award, in a joking
echo of actress Sally Field's ``You like me'' acceptance speech at
the 1984 Academy Awards.
   ``And I'd like to thank Pepsi for causing so much controversy,''
Madonna added.
   The Pepsi Cola Co. in April withdrew its television commercial
featuring Madonna and also its sponsorship of her tour. The
commercial featured a burning cross and other images that offended
Christian groups, particularly Roman Catholics.
   The Viewers Choice is a popularity award determined by telephone
votes and ballots received by mail and fax machine.
   Funk rockers Living Colour won best group, new artist and stage
performance awards for ``Cult of Personality.'' They accepted their
trophies backstage at Three Rivers Stadium in Pittsburgh, where they
were performing with the Rolling Stones.
   Stones' lead singer Mick Jagger presented the best group video
trophies during the live satellite remote.
   Elvis Costello got the male video honor for ``Veronica,''
R.E.M.'s ``Orange Crush'' captured the post-modern category.
   Madonna, taking a sultry stage pose with a cigarette and a
two-woman entourage, introduced the career-achievement Video
Vanguard award to pop singer George Michael. The award had been
announced in advance.
   D.J. Jazzy Jeff &amp; The Fresh Prince won the rap award for
``Parents Just Don't Understand.''
   ``This is a dream come true,'' said Fresh Prince, 19, who urged
all of the ``kids out there'' to ``Stay away from drugs and all that
stuff.''
   ``Kiss,'' by Art of Noise and featuring vocals by Tom Jones, was
hailed as the year's breakthrough video.
   Guns N' Roses won the heavy metal category for ``Sweet Child O'
Mine'' and the combination of Irish rockers U2 and veteran bluesman
B.B. King earned a best video from film trophy for ``When Love Comes
to Town'' from the concert movie ``Rattle and Hum.''
   The awards show, hosted by Arsenio Hall, lasted 2{ hours and
featured performances by Abdul, Cher, Def Leppard, Jon Bon Jovi,
Richie Sambora, and Madonna.
   A performance by MTV comic Andrew Dice Clay was filled with
obscene, unprintable poems and comments about overweight women and
sex. MTV Vice President Barry Kluger quickly went before reporters
backstage and apologized for the material.
   ``Andrew Dice Clay did not do this in rehearsal and we were very
surprised by it. Based on this experience, Andrew Dice Clay will not
be appearing on MTV in the future,'' Kluger said.
   The comic had already left before Kluger's statement.
   Pop superstar Michael Jackson had the odds in his favor going
into the show, but he cashed in only one of his eight nominations,
earning a special effects trophy for Jim Blashfield.
   Jody Watley came up emptyhanded despite six nominations for
``Real Love.''
   Puerto Rican singer Chayanne won best Latin rock video in the
International Viewers Choice award, a popularity contest determined
by telephone votes and ballots received by mail and fax machine.
   Nominations were made in 18 general and professional categories.
The additional special categories included Hall of Fame, Viewers
Choice and International Viewers Choice, the latter for best
European, Australian, Japanese and Latin rock videos.
   Jackson was a multiple winner at the first MTV Video Music Awards
in 1984, taking the special Viewer's Choice, choreography and
overall performance honors for ``Thriller.'' But even then he was
overshadowed by Herbie Hancock's six awards for ``Rockit.''
   Jackson didn't get another MTV award until last year, when he was
given a special Video Vanguard award.
   And despite an emphasis on stunning visuals, Madonna didn't win
an MTV award until 1986. Her second came in 1987.
   In the short history of the MTV awards, Peter Gabriel was the
biggest winner of a single year, collecting nine silver statuettes
for ``Sledgehammer'' in 1987.
   The first and second MTV awards were staged at Radio City Music
Hall in New York City. The 1986 show originated from both the
Universal Amphitheatre and the Palladium in New York. Since then the
amphitheater has been its home.

   When Cath Tschirn marries Richard Thomas
on Saturday, she plans to get out of her wheelchair for the first
time in five years and stand up to say her vows.
   With the help of the 2-year-old southeastern Virginia branch of
Volunteers for Medical Engineering, Miss Tschirn (pronounced Churn)
said she hopes to fulfill her dreams of a fairy tale wedding.
   ``I got the dress I wanted. If I hadn't had the accident, I'd be
standing up. Plus, I think I'll shock the whole church,'' she said.
   The 20-year-old Miss Tschirn was a junior in high school, a
cheerleader and a drama club member on Oct. 17, 1984, when the car
in which she was riding flipped over.
   ``All that really happened to me is I was paralyzed,'' she said.
``I didn't have a scratch.''
   The organization built a stand for Miss Tschirn to hold herself
up, and on the bottom is a lazy susan, which will allow her to turn
around and greet the congregation when she and her husband are
introduced as Mr. and Mrs. Richard Thomas.
   Founded in 1982 by John Staehlin, the organization has grown from
the first club in Baltimore to 400 members and 12 chapters,
according to Carole Forsythe, its executive director.
   Ms. Forsythe said Staehlin, an engineer at a defense plant in
Baltimore, had wanted for years to do something other than defense
work. ``He was sitting in church and heard a sermon on using your
talents'' and decided to do it, she said.
   Besides the stand for Miss Tschirn, projects have included
software and switches that enable an immobilized person to use a
computer by blinking one's eyes; research on an artificial muscle;
and voice-controlled videocassette recorders.
   Using donated funds, the Newport News chapter bought the
materials to make the device for Miss Tschirn, said Roy Whitlock,
president of the club and director of maintenance engineering and
environmental services at Riverside Rehabilitation Institute in
Newport News.
   One club member helped in Miss Tschirn's rehabilitation and let
the group know of the young woman's dream.
   ``I understand soon after she was injured, she stated it blankly:
`I want to stand up at my wedding,''' Whitlock said.
   After a yearlong rehabilitation, Miss Tschirn graduated with her
high school class. She has regained some movement in her feet. She
works, lives in an apartment behind her parents' garage and
considers herself more independent than many people who have
suffered similar accidents.
   She also talks to children and anyone who will listen about
wearing seat belts, since she was not wearing one when the accident
occurred.
   She met her fiance a year after her accident. Thomas also was in
a car accident and used a wheelchair for three months.
   ``My fiance said, `I don't see why you're so hung up on standing
up,''' she recalled. ```I didn't meet you standing up.'''
   Miss Tschirn hopes to leave the wheelchair behind at the altar
and sit in another chair for the first part of the ceremony, then
stand up for the vows. She and Thomas will operate the stand, which
will be decorated with ribbons and lace.
   ``I'm going to get him to carry me down the aisle,'' she said.

   Former President Reagan and his wife,
Nancy, arrived for routine physicals at the Mayo Clinic.
   The Reagans were to undergo the examinations today before
returning to their Bel Air, Calif., home, said their spokesman, Mark
Weinberg, who accompanied the couple.
   As the Reagans' motorcade from the airport pulled up at the
Kahler Hotel on Wednesday, about 100 onlookers applauded. Reagan
waved as he got out of his car and entered the hotel.
   Asked by a reporter what he thought of the drug plan President
Bush outlined Tuesday night, Reagan said, ``It's fine. It's high
time.''
   The former president, who also was applauded by a crowd in the
hotel lobby and shook hands with a number of people, appeared to be
in good health.
   The Reagans have a long relationship with physicians at the
clinic in this city 70 miles southeast of Minneapolis. Mrs. Reagan's
doctor stepfather was a friend of Dr. Oliver Beahrs, a retired Mayo
surgeon.
   A team of Mayo physicians examined Reagan in January 1987 for any
recurrence of an earlier colon cancer, and performed surgery to
correct an enlarged prostate.
   In October 1987, two Mayo physicians were part of a team that
treated Mrs. Reagan's breast cancer.
   Reagan ``looks very healthy,'' said Leonard Harms of Reidsburg,
Wis., a hotel guest visiting the clinic who ran for his camera when
he heard the Reagans were coming. ``I got lots of pictures and a
picture of her.''

   An Energy Department laboratory is under
investigation for possible ethics violations in transferring
sensitive computer technology to a new company led by former lab
scientists who helped develop the process.
   Officials at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory on Wednesday
defended the licensing, which is being investigated separately by
the House Energy and Commerce investigations subcommittee and the
Energy Department's Office of Inspector General.
   ``We are satisfied that from all we know, all was legal and above
board,'' said Jeff Garberson, a spokesman at the Livermore,
Calif.-based laboratory managed by the University of California
under an Energy Department contract.
   Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of the House panel, raised
ethics and other questions about the licensing agreement in a letter
to Energy Secretary James D. Watkins.
   A copy of the July 7 letter was made available to The Associated
Press on Wednesday.
   Dingell called the awarding of a license to the company n-Chip
for commercial development of the technology ``highly curious.''
   He cited ``the appearance of a conflict of interest'' in the
granting of an exclusive license to a company whose top officials
include at least three people who helped the lab develop the process.
   Laser pantography is used for interconnecting computer chips in a
way that permits supercomputers to be compressed to the size of a
pack of cigarettes.
   Gordon Longerbeam, head of the lab's technology transfers
program, said in a telephone interview that stringent measures were
taken to ensure that the n-Chip licensing process was fair and legal.
   No other companies expressed interest in getting the license
until after the lab had signed a legally binding agreement with
n-Chip to negotiate terms of the deal, he said.
   Longerbeam said laser pantography was developed as part of a
Defense Department electronics program but that it had no direct
connection to work on the Strategic Defense Initiative, commonly
known as Star Wars.
   He said the technology was not classified but that some of its
applications could be.
   The exclusive licensing agreement with n-Chip was made in January
and took effect in June.
   Three of n-Chip's main officers are former Lawrence Livermore
employees, including A. Carl Haussmann, who was associate
director-at-large at the lab and had management responsibility for
the laser pantography project until he left in April 1988.
   Haussmann is vice president for special projects at n-Chip.
   The others previously involved in development of the technology
are Bruce McWilliams, n-Chip president, and David Tuckerman, vice
president of technology.
   Carol Powell, a spokeswoman at the Energy Department's San
Francisco field operations office, which oversees work done at
Lawrence Livermore, said she could not comment because the case was
under investigation by the inspector general.
   Ms. Powell confirmed that the investigation was requested by the
San Francisco office, but she declined to say what prompted it.
   Judy DeMaire, executive director of the inspector general's
office, said that as a matter of policy she could neither confirm
nor deny the existence of any investigation.
   An investigator on Dingell's subcommittee, speaking on condition
he not be identified, said the panel had seen no sign of criminal
activity in the licensing of the technology. But he stressed that
recent meetings with Energy Department and lab officials had not
answered all questions about possible ethics violations.
   Among the issues raised by Dingell was whether Lawrence Livermore
had alerted other private companies that the technology was going to
be made commercially available before choosing n-Chip for the
license to develop it.
   ``What we're looking at is does this mean a person gets an unfair
advantage in acquiring this technology just because he has a
connection with a lab?'' the subcommittee investigator said.
   Longerbeam said the technology was ``broadly communicated to
segments and sectors of the electronics industry'' for several years
before the agreement with n-Chip.

<TEXT>
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell says
President Bush, not the Senate, is responsible for the 200 vacancies
still remaining in top policy-making positions in the Bush
administration.
   Bush's attempt to blame the Senate for foot-dragging is
``unwarranted and unfair,'' Mitchell said.
   In each of the 200 positions, the president has not indicated
that holdovers from the Reagan administration will be asked to stay
on, the Maine Democrat told the Senate on Wednesday. There are a
total of 432 such jobs.
   ``Thus, nearly eight months after he took office, the president
has failed to make nominations for nearly half of the full-time
positions in executive departments and independent agencies which
require Senate confirmation.
   ``Whose responsibility is that?'' Mitchell asked. ``It is
certainly not the Senate's.''
   Mitchell noted that after he met with Bush on Aug. 4 to discuss
nominations, White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said,
``The president wanted to express his deep concern that these
(nominations) were being held up for artificial reasons not related
to the candidates themselves.''
   Mitchell said that, based on a careful review of the status of
the Bush nominations to date, he is ``urging that the president
discontinue such criticism.''
   ``It is unfounded and unfair,'' Mitchell said. ``The principal
problem is in the slow pace at which nominations are being made, not
in the pace at which nominations, once made, are being processed.''
   He said there are 48 policy-making positions in government
departments that are ``totally vacant,'' with no nominations
submitted and no holdovers from the Reagan administration.
   ``Out of 14 Cabinet departments, only the Department of
Transportation has no totally vacant positions,'' Mitchell said.
``There are five totally vacant positions in the Executive Office of
the President and another 20 in major independent agencies.''
   In education, he said, there are no nominees to fill assistant
secretary positions in elementary and secondary education or in
vocational and adult education and civil rights.
   In public health, Mitchell said, there is no nominee for Surgeon
General, commissioner of aging or for administrator of the Health
Care Finance Administration.
   ``The vital 1990 Census is rapidly approaching and there is no
nominee to be director of the Census Bureau,'' Mitchell said.
``Whose responsibility is that?''
   Mitchell said the Senate has confirmed 212 Bush nominees, 90
percent of them within two months of the time the nominations was
received. He did not include nominations for U.S. ambassadors, U.S.
marshals or U.S. attorneys.
   He said a slow-motion nominating process is hurting the way the
government functions because senior Civil Service professionals ``do
not set policy for an administration.''
   ``When there are no people at the top, the professional civil
servant does the best he or she can; but policy initiatives await
the arrival of presidentially nominated personnel,'' Mitchell said.

<HEAD>Court Lifts Injunction on Logging in Spotted Owl Habitat</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The government will seek the resumption of
logging in western Oregon's old-growth forests, an official said
after a federal court lifted its ban on timber-cutting in the
northern spotted owl's habitat.
   Conservationists who sued to prevent lumbering said that while
the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeal's unanimous ruling Wednesday
removed the overall ban imposed June 7, it still permitted
challenges to individual projects.
   Ed Ciliberti, the U.S. Bureau of Land Management's Oregon
spokesman, said 66 million board-feet of timber are ready for sale.
The injunction had forbidden timber sales within 2.1 miles of any
spotted owl site identified by the bureau.
   ``We are giving direction for our districts to begin moving those
sales that have been enjoined,'' Ciliberti said.
   If timber sales proceed, conservationists will seek ``endangered
species'' status for the owl, said James Monteith, executive
director of the Oregon Natural Resources Council.
   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has proposed ``threatened''
status for the bird, a designation which would be weaker than that
desired by conservationists.
   The owl inhabits old-growth forests in western Washington,
western Oregon and northern California, mostly on federal land.
Scientists view it as a species whose condition indicates a forest's
overall health.
   The three-member appeals court rejected conservation groups'
chief argument that new information on dangers to the owl's survival
was ignored by the BLM in its environmental review. The panel said
the issue could not be raised in a lawsuit because of a federal law
backed by the timber industry.
   However, the court revived sections of the lawsuit contending
that destruction of owl habitat by logging violated federal bird
protection law and federal and state land-management laws.
   Mark Rutzick, the lawyer for the timber industry's Northwest
Forest Resource Council, said the ruling offered the promise of
final victory in the case for loggers and Oregon communities that
depend on logging.
   Victor Sher of the Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund, the lead
environmentalst attorney, said: ``It's a disappointment, but the
fault is Congress' and not the court's. ... We proved that the BLM
had violated the law, but Congress has said the courts can't hear
the case.''
   The lawsuit challenged the BLM's refusal in 1987 to conduct a new
environmental analysis of hundreds of planned timber sales in
western Oregon based on a new study increasing previous predictions
of danger to the owl. The bureau contended it already had taken
adequate measures to protect the bird.
   In May, U.S. District Judge Helen Frye of Portland dismissed the
lawsuit, allowing the BLM to proceed with logging of 337 million
board-feet of timber. She said the agency had failed to plan
adequately for protection of the spotted owl, but added that her
hands were tied by federal law.
   The appeals court agreed with Frye's interpretation that the
BLM's timber management plan could not be challenged in court on the
basis of new information. The law allowed challenges to particular
activities in the plan.
   In his opinion, Chief Judge Alfred Goodwin said
environmentalists' challenge to numerous individual logging sales
amounted to a challenge to the overall BLM plan, even if disputed
sales added up to only 30 percent of the total.
   The attacks on individual sales were based on a disagreement with
the BLM's decision to designate certain areas for ``intensive timber
management,'' Goodwin said.
   That decision ``was made with the knowledge that owl habitat
would be sacrificed in the clear cuts and conversion to
second-growth forest,'' he said. ``That intentional trade-off of
owls for economic gain was precisely the land-use decision which is
being challenged.''
   The court reinstated conservationists' claims that the
destruction of spotted owl habitat violated the Migratory Bird
Treaty Act and federal, Oregon and California land management laws.
   Frye had dismissed those claims, saying they should have been
made while the BLM's timber plans were being developed. But Goodwin
said environmental groups had acted as soon as they could after
getting the new information about possible dangers to the owl.
   The court ordered Frye to consider the claims on their merits but
did not impose a new injuction during that review.

   Hundreds of striking Eastern Airlines
employees, ending a 3,000-mile march that began last month in Miami,
want the Senate to bring to a vote a measure to force resolution of
the 6-month-old walkout.
   The 26-day relay march, which included rallies in a number of
East Coast cities, ended Wednesday on the west steps of the Capitol
amid chants of ``One more day.''
   The marchers were joined by union leaders and several members of
Congress.
   ``We're in a tough battle against one of the worst employers in
the country,'' AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland told the crowd.
   ``We know which side the president of the United States is on.
He's made that abundantly clear,'' said Kirkland, prompting marchers
to chant ``Where was George?''
   The strikers vowed to continue the walkout ``one more day'' until
Frank Lorenzo, owner of Eastern's parent company Texas Air Corp.,
gives in.
   Sen. Paul Sarbanes, D-Md., describing Lorenzo as a ``modern-day
robber baron,'' said the strikers were ``fighting for justice for
all American workers.''
   Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., donned a red shirt that urged a boycott
of Eastern and Lorenzo-owned Continental Airlines.
   ``I believe Frank Lorenzo is vicious and greedy,'' Lewis said.
   After the rally, hundreds of pilots, flight attendants and
machinists paraded to the White House.
   Kirkland demanded that the Senate bring to a vote a measure to
force resolution of the strike. The House approved such a bill after
President Bush refused to follow a National Mediation Board
recommendation that he appoint an emergency board.
   ``Working men have to stick together,'' said Sen. Paul Simon,
D-Ill., vowing to push for Senate approval of the emergency
legislation.
   The rally came at the end of a march and caravan that began Aug.
12 in Miami. Leaders said 13 Eastern employees traveled the entire
route, while hundreds of others participated in mile-long relays of
a symbolic picket sign along the East Coast route that included New
York and Boston.
   The striking unions accuse Lorenzo of planning to strip away
Eastern's assets until the airline is dead. However, Eastern
officials have said they are gradually building the airline back up
to a major carrier and have been adding flights and personnel since
filing for reorganization under bankruptcy laws.

<HEAD>Interpretation of Regulations Will Affect S&amp;Ls</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Savings institutions representing 80 percent of
the industry could fail new capital standards if regulators choose
the strictest interpretation of legislation enacted last month.
   Under one interpretation of the bill signed into law Aug. 9 by
President Bush, about 1,400 of the nation's 2,700 solvent thrifts,
representing $1 trillion in assets, or 80 percent of the industry,
would fall short, regulators in the Office of Thrift Supervision
said Wednesday.
   However, under a more lenient reading of the law, only 600
institutions with about $500 billion in assets would miss the
standard and be subject to regulatory sanctions, including
restrictions on growth and government review of their business plans.
   The key reform in the bill requires S&amp;L owners to risk more of
their own capital as a buffer between losses and government deposit
insurance funds. However, S&amp;L regulators said they were not sure
exactly how tough the standard should be.
   The problem, according to M. Danny Wall, director of the thrift
office, is that the final bill was cobbled together from very
different versions passed separately by the House and Senate.
   ``When you compromise widely divergent views, you don't
necessarily come up with something that's clear and that's what we
have here,'' he said.
   One section of the bill _ the section that got the most attention
during congressional debate _ establishes a new standard for
``core'' capital of 3 percent of loans and other assets.
   However, the S&amp;L bill also requires thrifts to meet capital
standards ``no less stringent'' than those adopted for national
banks. Currently, that is 5.5 percent.
   Further complicating the matter is the fact that national bank
capital standards will be overhauled by 1991 in a way that varies
required capital depending on the riskiness of an institution's
loans and other investments.
   Regulators could impose very stringent standards on S&amp;Ls, only to
wind up having to write more lenient rules a year later when the new
risk-adjusted bank standards for banks take effect. S&amp;Ls generally
fare better than banks under risk-adjusted rules because they
concentrate heavily on mortgage lending, which is considered safer
than commercial lending.
   Regulators must resolve the dilemma by Nov. 7, when they're due
to publish capital rules taking effect a month later. Before that,
the Office of Thrift Supervision, which was once an independent
agency called the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, must clear the new
rules with the Treasury Department.
   In deciding the issue, Wall said regulators are trying to figure
out the intent of Congress when it passed the bill, but because
different factions assigned different meanings to the same passages,
that's not easy.
   Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, chairman of the House Banking
Committee, said in a letter to Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady
that Congress intended the 3 percent standard to apply, not the 5.5
percent.
   Robert Glauber, under secretary of the Treasury, said Gonzalez's
letter was an important contribution to unsnarling the problem.
   But, he said, ``a literal reading of the language of the bill
leaves it open to a variety of interpretations. ... I don't think
there's a particularly persuasive case for one interpretation or
another.''

   ``We were ready to die but the hand of God guided our descent,''
passenger Epaminondas de Sousa Chaves, 36, said Wednesday after Air
force helicopters airlifted 41 survivors out of the jungle.
   Their Varig airlines Boeing 737-200 crashed Sunday night, killing
at least 10 of the 54 people aboard.
   ``It is incredible that we came out alive,'' said Regia Acevedo,
29, who was thrown from the plane with her husband, Raimundo.
   Air Force spokesman Col. Jose Maria dos Santos told a news
conference that two passengers died Wednesday and identified them as
a man trapped in the wreckage and a woman who died on a rescue plane
en route to Brasilia.
   The aircraft disappeared Sunday night when the pilot reported
problems with his navigational system and the plane strayed far off
route.
   Chaves said the aircraft ran out of fuel and went down in thick
forest cover.
   ``With a calm voice the pilot asked us to forgive him, and told
us to pray to God and wished us luck. All of a sudden the motors
stopped and I don't know if 10 minutes went by, 15 or even a
minute,'' Chaves said.
   He said the plane ``seemed to bounce'' when it hit the top of the
100-foot trees, then smashed through the jungle cover in the
northern part of the central-western Amazon state of Mato Grosso.
Both wings were ripped from the plane but the fuselage was nearly
intact.
   The plane bore a 300-by-120-foot hole in the jungle but did not
explode, Chavez said.
   ``It was as if a giant claw had scratched the body of the plane.
First there was a deafening screech and then a silence, and then
absolute darkness,'' Ms. Acevedo said.
   Another passenger, Jose Maria Gadelha, said: ``All of a sudden
there was a flash of lightning. I lost consciousness, and when I
woke up I was outside the plane and alive.''
   The air force found the plane Tuesday night after four survivors
walked through the jungle and contaced authorities by ham radio.
   On Wednesday morning rescue helicopters airlifted 41 people
nearly 30 miles to a ranch near Sao Jose do Xingu, about 1,050 miles
northwest of Rio de Janeiro, Santos said.
   From the ranch, three twin-engine Bandeirante planes took the
survivors to the mountain Serra do Cachimbo air base 185 miles
northwest. There, the survivors let their emotions go and wept was
they were greeted by rescue workers.
   They later were flown to Brasilia, the capital, for care at the
Brasilia Base Hospital, Santos said.
   The pilot of plane did not speak with reporters upon arriving in
Brasilia and airline officials declined further comment on what
caused the crash.
   The plane, purchased by Varig airlines in 1982, had strayed off
course while on the last leg of a regularly scheduled flight between
the southeastern city of Sao Paulo and Belem, 2,140 miles northwest
of Rio at the mouth of the Amazon river.

<HEAD>Atlantis Astronauts Believe Nuclear-Powered Planetary Probe Safe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURA TOLLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SPACE CENTER, Houston (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The astronaut who will command
Atlantis next month on a mission to deploy a probe to Jupiter says
he has no qualms about flying with two nuclear generators aboard the
shuttle.
   The two radio-isotope thermo-electric generators, or RTGs, will
power the Galileo probe on its trip across the solar system. Some
anti-nuclear groups claim the nuclear material could pose a health
hazard if released during a shuttle accident.
   ``The chances are so remote it's not worth worrying about,''
Atlantis commander Don Williams said Wednesday.
   Williams and Atlantis' four other astronauts discussed the
mission during individual interviews and at a final preflight press
conference. The crew will spend the next month training for the
mission, scheduled to begin Oct. 12.
   ``There's a certain amount of risk involved in anything you do
these days,'' Williams said. ``(But) I'm satisfied in my mind ...
that we've done the best possible job we can to make these things as
safe as we possibly can.''
   Atlantis' other astronauts agreed.
   ``I don't see how it can hurt anyone unless it hits him on the
head, and that's pretty remote,'' said pilot Mike McCulley.
   The other crew members are Franklin Chang-Diaz, Ellen Baker and
Shannon Lucid _ all mission specialists. Baker and McCulley are
space rookies.
   Each of the 122-pound RTGs contain about 24 pounds of highly
toxic plutonium-238 dioxide. The heat released by the plutonium's
decay is converted into electricity by instruments called
thermocouples.
   The astronauts noted that the nuclear generators are the only
known devices that can power a spacecraft going deep into the solar
system far from the sun.
   Voyager 2, which last month relayed stunning photos from Neptune,
is powered by similar RTGs.
   ``If we want to explore the outer parts of the solar system, we
don't have a choice right now,'' Mrs. Baker said. ``Voyager wouldn't
be where it is today and we wouldn't have gotten those beautiful
pictures of Neptune back had it not been for the three RTGs that
have powered Voyager so well for the last 12 years.''
   The United States has launched 22 nuclear-powered spacecraft
since 1961, with all the plutonium packages encased in super
hardened material designed to survive the worst possible fire or
explosive conditions. None resulted in the release of radioactive
release, even though one package was aboard a rocket that exploded
and two survived flaming re-entries through Earth's atmosphere after
accidents.
   But some anti-nuclear and environmental groups have protested the
use of plutonium aboard Atlantis, citing the 1986 Challenger
explosion as an example of how things can go wrong. They contend a
similar explosion could result in radioactive contamination of the
Cape Canaveral, Fla., area.
   The White House has to approve the mission because of the nuclear
material aboard, and an announcement is expected soon. If the
mission is approved, opposition groups said they would seek a court
order to block the liftoff.
   NASA said an exhaustive post-Challenger safety review indicates
that the chances of a launch accident in which substantial
quantities of plutonium, pulverized to breathable form, could be
released is about 1-in-2,700. And even then, NASA said, any
contamination would be minor.
   Once deployed, Galileo will embark on a six-year journey to
Jupiter where it will fire a scientific probe into the Jovian
atmosphere and orbit the planet for 22 months of extensive
exploration.
   ``It's just very exciting,'' Lucid said. ``It's important for us
to learn. It's important for us to know about our solar system. It's
important to learn about the universe we're in.''

<HEAD>With PM-Drug Plan, Bjt</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Drug czar William Bennett's suggestion that
entertainers who reveal past addictions might lead others to abuse
drugs was ridiculed by some celebrities.
   Bennett is ``an embarrassment to the American people,'' said
Danny Goldberg, producer of the groundbreaking television campaign
Rock Against Drugs, which featured popular musicians such as Belinda
Carlisle and Vince Neil talking about their own drug addiction
recoveries.
   In the National Drug Control Strategy report issued this week,
Bennett praised campaigns that encourage negative attitudes toward
drugs and that label drug users as losers.
   ``Less useful _ and probably even counterproductive _ are
commercials in which sports and pop music stars who are reformed
drug users tell young people not to do as they have done,'' Bennett
also said.
   ``Such commercials may lack credibility, and they also carry an
unintended message: that you can do drugs and still be rich and
successful.''
   Actor Gregory Harrison, who has made public service announcements
on television and radio discussing his eight-year addiction to
cocaine and alcohol, said that Bennett's criticism was misguided.
   ``I'm just out here to try to educate, and I think most of the
celebrities who do these things are there to help educate,'' said
the former star of ``Trapper John. M.D.,'' now sober for two years.
   ``If William Bennett thinks that it's a mistake, he can think
that. But I'd like to see him do something constructive instead of
just critiquing other people's attempts,'' Harrison said.
   Atlanta Braves outfielder Lonnie Smith, a recovering cocaine
addict who has discussed openly his habit's costly toll, simply
laughed and shook his head when asked to respond to Bennett's
comments. ``William Bennett is entitled to his opinion,'' is all
Smith would say.
   Goldberg, who brought the Rock Against Drugs campaign to national
television in 1987, said RAD's TV spots were useful because they
employed former addicts steering users toward sobriety, a tactic
shared by Alcoholics Anonymous and Cocaine Anonymous.
   ``There was no question that the people with the greatest
credibility with young people were people who had grappled with the
same demons that were assaulting the teen-age fans,'' Goldberg said.
   ``I think that rock stars are people that young people could
understand,'' he said.
   In one of the RAD spots, former Sex Pistols guitarist Steve Jones
said, ``A good friend of mine, Sid Vicious, died of drugs. I nearly
died from drugs. Drugs suck.''
   Another spot featured David Crosby, formerly of Crosby, Stills,
Nash and Young. Crosby said, ``Four things can happen to you if you
do drugs: You can go crazy; you can go to prison; you can die; or
you can quit.''
   Goldberg reported that one fan wrote to RAD participant and
heavy-metal rocker Ronnie Dio to say, ``Teachers can preach for
hours about how bad drugs are and I still went out and got high. But
man, once I heard you say how stupid drugs are, I never touched them
again.''
   Harrison said that the ``Just Say No'' anti-drug rhetoric favored
by former first lady Nancy Reagan is essentially useless.
   ``If some guy who's never done drugs in his life, never had a
drug problem, comes on and does a `Just Say No' commercial ... I
watch that and I think, `You ignorant fools. Don't you understand
how much worse it is than that?'
   ``If I could just say no and walk away, I'd have done it five
years ago,'' he said. ``People who just say no don't have the
problem. They have no credibility at all. And it's infuriating.''

<HEAD>Kemp to Revive Suspended Program That Has Cost HUD Millions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Department of Housing and Urban Development
will revive, with significant reforms, a housing insurance program
that has cost the government millions because of defaults blamed on
mismanagement, agency officials say.
   The revised multi-family housing co-insurance program will
include tighter eligibility requirements for lenders and an expanded
monitoring effort by HUD, the officials, who spoke on condition they
not be identified, said Wednesday.
   HUD Secretary Jack Kemp suspended the program four months ago,
ordering a review of its management. Kemp was to announce plans to
renew the program Wednesday but delayed it because of unresolved
issues dealing with new regulations, one of the officials said.
   The officials said staff members would be added to monitor the
lenders and the program would be upgraded from a branch of the
department's housing division to a separate office under the
assistant secretary for housing.
   The program was a major part of the Reagan administration's
effort to turn government tasks over to the private sector.
   Under the program, HUD insures up to about 80 percent of
mortgages for multi-family housing projects against default.
Defaults in the program total more than $700 million, with
Washington-based DRG Funding accounting for $583 million of the
total.
   HUD's inspector general, in a critical review of the program,
said lenders appeared to be overvaluing property to issue inflated
mortgages. That would bring them higher fees because they receive a
percentage of the loan amount.
   Kemp suspended the program three months ago, one of a number of
HUD programs halted or put on hold amid reports of widespread
mismanagement, fraud and influence-peddling at the agency under the
Reagan administration.
   Since Kemp took over the agency in February nine companies have
been suspended from the program or placed on probation.

<HEAD>Stroh Officials Drop Sponsorship of Audubon Specials</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of Stroh Brewery Co. says the
company is withdrawing its sponsorship of National Audubon Society
television specials, but insists it has nothing to do with a
threatened boycott by Northwest loggers.
   ``We sought to keep these issues separate and unrelated,'' Peter
Stroh said in a statement, adding the decision reflected the
Detroit-based company's mounting financial problems.
   Northwest loggers, upset with an upcoming program on the region's
ancient forests, began a loosely organized campaign threatening to
boycott the brewery's products unless Stroh dropped its support for
the specials.
   Environmental sources, who asked to remain anonymous, had earlier
said that Stroh requested that changes be made in the program,
``Ancient Forests: Rage Over Trees,'' and when the Audubon Society
refused the company decided to drop its $600,000 in underwriting.
   The timber industry and environmentalists have been locked in a
bitter struggle for months over future logging in the Northwest's
old-growth forests, which provide prime habitat for the northern
spotted owl.
   The Audubon Society is among environmental groups that have
sought to have the owl protected and logging in the ancient forests
halted. Audubon officials insist that the special, which will be
shown on cable television Sept. 24 and on public television later,
is ``fair and balanced.''
   Stroh has provided about half the funding for the four-show
series with the balance coming from Turner Broadcasting System.
   Turner spokeswoman Kirsten White said Wednesday that her company
had no plans to drop the show.

<NOTE>Government Could Not Handle Major Spill, Experts Say</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Budget cuts are hampering the government's
ability to prevent major Great Lakes oil spills and to minimize the
damage if they occur, experts say.
   The oil industry, meanwhile, underestimates the threat to the
lakes as it prepares to open emergency response centers along the
nation's sea coasts but none on lake shores, witnesses told the
Governmental Affairs subcommittee on oversight of government
management.
   The panel, chaired by Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., is investigating
the dangers posed by spills into the lakes in the wake of the March
24 Exxon Valdez disaster off the Alaskan coast.
   At a hearing Wednesday, speakers said the ramifications of a
comparable spill on the lakes would be economically devastating.
   ``The Great Lakes are far more vulnerable to spills than most
people realize, and there are far more inadequacies in our spill
response and prevention capabilities than we can or should
tolerate,'' Levin said.
   None of the five emergency response centers envisioned by the oil
industry is close enough to contain a major spill on the lakes, said
David F. Hales, director of the Michigan Department of Natural
Resources.
   In a written statement, the American Petroleum Institute said its
New York response office would handle Great Lakes spills.
   ``Equipment from the ... center could be rapidly airlifted to any
Great Lakes port,'' the statement said.
   The U.S. and Canadian coast guards reported 492 oil and chemical
spills into the lakes in 1988. There were 384 reported spills in
1987 and 401 in 1986.

   Otto G. Obermaier, President Bush's nominee to

doesn't anticipate any problems being confirmed by the Senate.
   ``I may be naive in that regard but I am more than happy to
answer any of their questions,'' he said in an interview Wednesday
from New York.
   Obermaier says he has no skeletons in his closet.
   ``I don't think I buy outdated milk,'' he said, laughing. ``I
don't think I speed _ at least I don't get caught at it. I pay my
taxes. I'll even answer questions like, Have I ever used drugs? ...
The answer is indeed no.''
   On Wednesday, Bush announced the nomination of the 53-year-old
Manhattan attorney to succeed Rudolph Giuliani, who resigned Jan. 31
to run for the GOP nomination for New York City mayor.
   Benito Romano has been acting U.S. attorney.

<HEAD>American Expedition in South Pacific Aimed at Solving Earhart Mystery</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SUVA, Fiji (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The leader of a U.S. team hoping to solve the
52-year-old mystery of where Amelia Earhart crashed said today he
believes her plane went down on an uninhabited island and she died
of thirst three days later.
   ``We wouldn't be going through this exercise if we didn't think
there was something there,'' said Richard Gillespie, head of The
International Group of Historic Aircraft Recovery.
   The group, based in Wilmington, Del., believes Earhart's plane
crashed on the Phoenix Island of Nikumaroro in the Kiribati
archipelago, about 1,000 miles east of Fiji in the South Pacific.
   Gillespie said a 16-member expedition will leave Suva on Monday
in a converted Japanese trawler and spend three weeks on Nikumaroro
and nearby McKean Island looking for evidence.
   Earhart's plane disappeared in 1937 after she set off for Howland
Island from Wau, Papau New Guinea, to attempt the first
trans-Pacific flight. The famed aviator's exploits achieved
legendary status in the United States.
   ``We do not claim to have new and revolutionary information or
new and revolutionary technology,'' Gillespie said in a telephone
interview. ``We have applied rigid academic techniques to solving
the Earhart enigma.''
   U.S. Embassy official Robert Benzinger said Wednesday that
Gillespie's group had ``fairly persuasive'' evidence that Earhart
went down much further eastward than previously thought.
   ``They have two basic theories about where Earhart crashed, and
if they find the evidence it will be sensational,'' he said.
   Gillespie's group searched old U.S. Navy records to produce the
theory that Earhart, running short of fuel, dumped her plane on
Nikumaroro, which was on her flight path to Howland Island.
   Howland lies north of the Phoenix Islands and has an airstrip
that Earhart had planned to use for refueling before going on to
Hawaii.
   ``We know for a fact she did not arrive at Howland Island because
people were there waiting for her,'' Gillespie said. ``We know for a
fact how fast her plane was going and how much fuel she had on
board. When she sent a distress signal she was about 100 miles from
Howland.
   ``It would be logical for her navigator to put down on the
nearest bit of land, and that would have to be Nikumaroro or McKean
since she was lost.''
   Gillespie said the U.S. Coast Guard picked up 24 distress signals
for three days after the crash.
   ``They heard a faint woman's voice, which people recognized as
Earhart's, it was on her frequency and her call sign,'' he said.
``The U.S. Navy launched a search and sent a battleship but because
the waters were not well charted it did not put a landing boat
ashore'' on Nikumaroro.
   Gillespie said a pilot flew over Nikumaroro in an ensuing aerial
search and reported recent signs of human habitation.
   He said he believed Earhart died of thirst three days after the
crash because Nikumaroro has no fresh water and is uninhabited.
   The island, also known as Gardener, is a rim of land a
quarter-mile wide situated around a V-shaped lagoon. McKean, also
uninhabited, is a half-mile long and about 800 yards wide.
   The expedition expects to arrive on Nikumaroro around Sept. 16
and Gillespie said he expects to know whether the mission is a
success before Oct. 12.
   ``We hope to find the plane or bits of it. It may have been swept
away in a hurricane, and that's why some members of the team are
experts in sonar and metal detection,'' he said.
   He said the expedition will cost $250,000. Benzinger said the
government of Kiribati, a group of 33 islands straddling the
equator, gave permission for the expedition.
   Kiribati, formerly the Gilbert and Ellice islands, was a major
battleground during World War II and has a population of about
61,000.
   An Australian woman pilot, Gaby Kennard, is attempting to fly
solo around the world in a single-engine plane as a tribute to
Earhart.
   Kennard, 44, flew this week to Atchison, Kan., Earhart's
hometown. She is a member of the 99 Association of Women Pilots,
which Earhart founded.
   She expects to complete the journey to Australia via Europe, the
Middle East and Asia later this month.

<HEAD>Judge Says Quadriplegic Can Let Himself Die</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURAN NEERGAARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 33-year-old quadriplegic quietly accepted the
news that a judge had granted his wish to be allowed to shut off the
machine that has kept him alive the past four years.
   Larry McAfee, paralyzed from the neck down in a 1985 motorcycle
accident, won permission Wednesday to fit the ventilator that allows
him to breathe with a device he designed in his head as he lay
paralyzed.
   ``He said, `Well,' and was quiet, just said, `Well, good,''' said
nurse Carol Philpot at the Briarcliff Nursing Center in Alabaster,
Ala., where McAfee is staying. ``He's kind of digesting the news, I
think.''
   Under his plans, McAfee would be administered a sedative and use
a mouth-held stick to activate the device, which would be connected
to a timer to shut off the ventilator.
   Fulton County Superior Court Judge Edward Johnson ruled that
McAfee's right to refuse life-sustaining treatment outweighed the
state's interest in preserving life.
   As a competent adult, McAfee has the right to refuse medical
treatment, the judge said.
   ``The ventilator to which he is attached is not prolonging his
life; it is prolonging his death,'' said Johnson, who had
jurisdiction because McAfee is from Atlanta and had petitioned the
Georgia court before he was taken to the Alabama nursing home.
   McAfee asked the court's permission to shield anyone who helped
him from potential legal problems.
   Johnson told McAfee's parents and three adult sisters that the
ruling would set a precedent so families in similar situations could
make their decisions more privately.
   In that way, the judge said: ``Larry will have made his last and
greatest contribution to his community.I have never met anyone who
had a stronger impact on my own life than he had on me when we had
the hearing at the hospital.''
   Although most ``right-to-die'' cases involve comatose patients or
those who cannot make their wishes known, a case similar to McAfee's
came up in July. A 38-year-old Michigan man paralyzed in a surfing
accident died after a court decided he had the right to have his
life-support system shut off.
   Johnson ordered the state, which supported McAfee's petition, to
appeal to the Georgia Supreme Court but said McAfee need not await
the outcome.
   McAfee's lawyer, Randall H. Davis, said he didn't expect any
opposition.
   ``The judge hopes they will issue a definitive opinion to make it
so that similarly situated people won't have to go to court and go
through all this,'' Davis said.
   Davis was unsure when McAfee would ask to be sent back to Georgia
so he could disconnect the ventilator; he said his client wanted to
be sent to a friend's apartment instead of a hospital.
   ``He has expressed a desire all along to move this along as
quickly as possible,'' Davis said. ``I assume that continues to be
his desire.''
   McAfee had not arranged to be moved to Georgia yet, but the
Alabama nursing home officials would expedite a move to wherever
McAfee wished, said Richard Lazarnick, a spokesman for the home.
   Johnson conducted a hearing at McAfee's bedside last month,
hearing him testify that he wakes up ``just fearful of each new day.
There is nothing I have found or can think of that I really enjoy or
that has helped me or my situation.''
   A petition filed last month included an affidavit that stated,
``I understand turning off the ventilator will result in my death,''
and was signed by a shaky ``X'' made with a pencil held in McAfee's
mouth.
   Five family members and a family friend testified that McAfee
told them numerous times he wanted to die rather than continue
living as he is.
   Julie Orr, a sister, said after the ruling that the family was
simply glad it was over.
   ``It's what Larry wants,'' she said. ``You never know (how hard
it is) until you're put there.''

   Tougher prison sentences, more treatment,
more prison cells, more judges, more police and more money.
President Bush's 1989 national war on drugs? No, Nelson
Rockefeller's 1973 New York war on drugs.
   Calling for an end to a ``reign of terror,'' the then-governor
told the Legislature in early 1973:
   ``What is needed now is a truly effective deterrent to the
pushing of drugs so that innocent people will not fall victim to the
pusher's tactics or be robbed, mugged or murdered by him.''
   With that, Rockefeller proposed mandatory life sentences for drug
dealers.
   The late New York Republican, who went on to become vice
president, also asked for 100 new judges and more than 6,000 new
prison cells.
   He got the money for those and for 30,000 new drug-treatment
spaces. And, with some modification to make the proposal less
Draconian, Rockefeller got stiff mandatory prison sentences for
pushers. He even got approval for a $1,000 bounty to those who
turned in drug dealers.
   New Yorkers got a bill that year for an extra $67 million.
   Rockefeller, having largely failed with earlier programs for
voluntary and then mandatory drug treatment, was trying what he
called ``the toughest drug law in the nation.''
   ``When are we going to open the concentration camps?'' Democratic
state Sen. Manfred Ohrenstein asked at the time. He, and others,
predicted failure.
   In fact, after a brief decline, felony drug arrests were on the
rise again by late 1974 in New York.
   State officials reported last month that New York City's violent
crime rate, linked largely to drug-related cases, rose by 9.8
percent in 1988.
   ``It didn't make a goddamn dent on anything,'' Ohrenstein said
this week of Rockefeller's war on drugs.
   Ohrenstein, who now serves as Senate minority leader, said he
views the Bush drug offensive in much the same light.
   ``Each time, we were deceiving the American public,'' said
Ohrenstein. ``I think we keep trying without trying to face up to
what really is the problem ... What's wrong with us that there are
so many people who need a fix every day?''
   Noting that the state had pumped million of dollars into
education and treatment programs during the 1960s with little
success before moving to tough punishment in 1973, then-Republican
Assemblyman Dominick DiCarlo said the get-tough policy failed
because it was simply too tough.
   DiCarlo, now a judge on the U.S. Court of International Trade,
also complained of the approach used in New York.
   ``We would concentrate on one aspect at a time,'' said DiCarlo,
who joined the Reagan administration in 1981 as the State
Department's assistant secretary for international narcotics
control. ``Hopefully, what the president is doing now is
concentrating on the entire area.''
   Republican Warren Anderson, who had just taken over as Senate
majority leader the year Rockefeller's tough anti-drug laws were
adopted, also hopes Bush's move to attack the drug problem on all
fronts at once may make it more successful than Rockefeller's
approach.
   ``We tried so many different things,'' said Anderson, who retired
from the Legislature last year after 16 years as the Senate leader.
``Here we are 17 years later and, if anything, the conditions are
worse. I don't think you can say it (Rockefeller's program) was a
failure, but it wasn't a success either.''
   Even Democrat Ohrenstein said the Rockefeller approach wasn't a
complete miscalculation.
   ``To what degree did it hold back the tide for a little while or
staunch the flow of blood for a little while? It's hard to say,'' he
said. ``Should we not have tried at all? The answer is, we should
have tried.''
   The Rockefeller-era drug laws have since been eased in New York
state. Former Gov. Hugh Carey and current Gov. Mario Cuomo, both
Democrats, have granted clemency to some drug dealers given
mandatory life sentences under the Rockefeller drug laws.

<HEAD>Dutch Voters Endorse Premier; Make Environment a Priority</HEAD>
<HEAD>By ROLAND DE LIGNY</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dutch voters have overwhelmingly
endorsed Premier Ruud Lubbers' economic recovery program and given
notice that cleaning up the nation's heavily polluted environment is
a priority.
   In Wednesday's general election, Lubbers' Christian Democratic
Appeal party maintained its 54 seats in the 150-member Parliament,
remaining the body's largest single party.
   Traditionally, the largest legislative grouping gets the
premiership and Lubbers, the country's longest-serving premier in 30
years, seemed certain of a third term.
   Voters dealt a blow to Lubbers' errant junior partner in the
center-right coalition, the right-wing Liberals, who in May toppled
the government over how to finance a long-term cleanup of the
environment.
   The Liberals, perceived by many voters as anti-environmentalist,
lost five of their 27 seats on Wednesday.
   The opposition Labor Party lost three seats in the voting,
keeping 49.
   It remained the second-largest force in Parliament but failed to
rally the left-of-center vote around its platform of economic growth
and redistribution of wealth among the 3 million people living on
welfare outlays.
   The Green Left, an impromptu coalition of left-wing fringe
parties, doubled its parliamentary contingent Wednesday to six seats
and the traditionally environmentalist Democrats '66 party won 12
seats, a gain of three.
   The remainder of seats went to small right-wing fringe parties.
   The electoral blow to the Liberals and the surge in support for
green parties clearly indicated voter concern over ecological issues.
   Earlier this year, Lubbers' government adopted a far-reaching,
multibillion-dollar plan to clean up the environment in this nation
that has been dubbed ``the garbage can of Western Europe.'' The
country is located on the estuary of the Rhine, Europe's prime
industrial waste artery.
   But the Liberals, under pressure from its affluent constituency,
rejected the proposed abolition of a tax break for car commuters.
The revenue was to finance the $3.3 billion clean-up over the next
four years.
   The governing coalition that will now emerge is difficult to
predict, and building it is expected to take months. Lubbers said
Wednesday that it was possible to form a coalition with either the
right or the left.
   Aske whether he would accept the Liberals as future coalition
partners, Lubber said he ``shouldn't exclude any party beforehand.''
   But he also told Dutch Television ``I see no reason why we
couldn't get together'' with the Labor Party, despite major
differences over government austerity and industrial revitalization.
   A continued alliance between the Christian Democrats and the
Liberals, favored by the predominant part of both parties'
constituencies, appears less likely because such a coupling would
have just a one-seat majority.
   But hammering out a center-left coalition of Christian Democrats
and Labor would be difficult because of the wide chasm on pressing
issues.
   Most prominent among them was how much those on welfare would
share wealth generated by an economy that has recovered partly by
slashing social security outlays.
   Other divisive issues included defense, with Labor opposed to
modernizing NATO's nuclear arsenals and the Christian Democrats in
favor, and euthanasia, which Lubbers' party wants to ban and Labor
wants to legalize.
   The Christian Democrats' strong showing proved overwhelming voter
support for Lubbers' policy of economic austerity and fiscal reform.
   The economy is expanding at a healthy 2.5 percent annual clip, up
from near zero when Lubbers rose to power seven years ago. Consumer
spending is growing 2.25 percent yearly, compared to minus 10
percent earlier in the decade.
   Lubbers has scheduled income tax cuts of $1.8 billion annually,
beginning next year.

<HEAD>Annulment Granted for Sir Rudolf Bing and Wife</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY McSHANE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sir Rudolf Bing's marriage has been annulled, but
his lawyer says that comes too late for the former opera impresario
to finish his life in his own home.
   State Judge Carmen Ciparick on Wednesday granted the invalidation
over the objections of Carroll Douglass, ending a 33-month union
during which attorneys for both said the pair had lost touch with
reality.
   As the case proceeded, the 87-year-old Bing, who suffers from
Alzheimer's disease, was moved from the fashionable Essex House
hotel along Central Park to a nursing home.
   ``In 1985, he came to a 30-year friend and said, `The one thing I
really want is to stay in the Essex House and die there,''' said
Bing's lawyer, Paul Goldhamer. ``But we ran out of money and time.''
   Goldhamer said hiring security and nurses to protect Bing from
Ms. Douglass took up $400,000 to $450,000 of Bing's $600,000 estate.
What's left is mostly paintings.
   ``It's truly a tragic event,'' Goldhamer said.
   The judge denied alimony or any part of Bing's estate to Ms.
Douglass, 50, who is hospitalized in a mental ward of Bellevue
Hospital, said her lawyer, Harvey Sladkus.
   Ciparick ordered Bing's estate to pay the expenses for Ms.
Douglass' hospitalization for mental problems last summer, Sladkus
said.
   Ms. Douglass' sister and brother in Washington will confer on the
next legal move, Sladkus said.
   Ms. Douglass, who had a history of mental problems, was
hospitalized in August 1988 after she ``lost touch with reality,''
he said.
   Bing's legal guardian, Paul C. Guth, was on vacation and
unavailable for comment. Bing's first marriage lasted 54 years but
ended in divorce.
   Bing and Douglass married Jan. 9, 1987, in a civil ceremony in
Arlington, Va. Attorneys for Bing, the general manager of the
Metropolitan Opera for 22 years, claimed he was mentally incompetent
and had no idea of what he was doing when he got married.
   The annulment trial began in May 1988. Almost half the couple's
marriage was spent in court.

<HEAD>Stallings Denies Allegations He Had Sex With Altar Boy</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDS: Note contents.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Rev. George A. Stallings Jr. is denying
published reports that he had sex with an altar boy 12 years ago.
   ``Read my lips _ I am innocent,'' Stallings declared on CNN's
Larry King Show on Wednesday.
   The Washington Post reported Monday that Stallings, who recently
started a controversial African-American Catholic congregation,
allegedly had oral sex two or three times a week with an altar boy
in a Washington church rectory for several months in 1977.
   Stallings' accuser, who was then 16 years old, gave the newspaper
a signed statement saying the incident occurred, saying he never
reported the relationship to church authorities. The paper agreed
not to identify the man.
   A caller asked Stallings on the live show Wednesday night if he
was considering a lawsuit against the newspaper.
   ``In order to sue The Washington Post, it would take between
$75,000 and a $100,0000,'' the priest responded. ``I have already
sought legal counsel about this matter.''
   Stallings, 41, had previously denounced the newspaper's reports,
saying he would not dignify the ``scurrilous and baseless charge''
with a answer, but had not denied the charge.
   Washington Post reporter Bill Dedman, who co-wrote the article,
was a caller on the show and asked Stallings if he has ever had
sexual relations with the young man in question or with any man.
   ``Bill Dedman, I said I wouldn't respond to you at all,''
Stallings said. ``I told him I do not deal with sleaze reporters and
journalists, and I won't talk to him.'' Stallings threatened to walk
off the set if pressed to answer Dedman's question.
   Another caller asked Stallings if he would agree to take
polygraph test to prove his innocence.
   ``Are you asking all the cardinals, the priests and the bishops
of the Catholic Church to take a polygraph test?'' Stallings said.
``When you can ask that of every priest, bishop and cardinal, then
you can ask me.''
   The black priest defied Roman Catholic hierarchy by forming an
independent church that blends tradition Catholic liturgy with
African and gospel traditions in July.
   Cardinal James A. Hickey, the Washington archbishop, suspended
Stallings following the first unauthorized mass at Imani Temple.
   In a statement released Monday, Hickey said he ``was sorry to
read the allegations'' and felt great sorrow and sympathy if they
were true.''
   An unidentified person allegedly wrote Hickey three years ago
claiming that Stallings had a sexual relationship with a male family
member, The Post reported. That letter prompted a formal
investigation, but the inquiry ended after the person refused to
talk, unnamed sources said.

<HEAD>Woman Survives Rape, Slashing, Flees Burning Home</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Blindfolded, bleeding and trapped in the basement
crawl space of her burning home, a rape victim scrawled her
attacker's name in blood with bound hands and then made a desperate
escape, authorities said.
   ``Donnie next door,'' she scratched on the wall Wednesday,
minutes after she was raped, robbed, slashed and beaten, police said.
   Her home had been set on fire and she had been left to die in the
crawl space sealed shut with furniture, police said.
   The 30-year-old woman was reported in fair condition Wednesday
night at Denver General Hospital.
   Her head throbbing from a hammer beating and her hand bleeding
from a knife wound, she had managed to kick her way out of the crawl
space and break her basement window with the knife with which she
was stabbed, police said.
   Half-nude, blood-caked and clutching the foot-long knife, the
woman scaled a 6-foot fence in her backyard and ran through her
neighborhood screaming for help.
   Police said terrified neighbors, unsure whether she was running
from trouble or looking for it, shut their doors.
   ``People didn't want to get involved,'' said Detective Christine
Wallis.
   But after hearing the woman's weak moans, one neighbor did phone
police.
   ``I was in the back room working on my computer when I heard her
scream, `Help me! Somebody help me!''' the unidentified neighbor
told The Denver Post.
   ``I looked out the window to make sure it wasn't some kids
playing around. I saw her climbing over the fence with a knife in
her hand. I went and called the police.''
   As paramedics treated the woman moments later, the neighbor saw
smoke flowing from her clapboard and brick house, the newspaper said.
   Another fire truck was summoned, and firefighters quickly doused
the blaze.
   At the hospital, the victim underwent surgery on the sliced
tendons in her hand.
   ``She may lose the use of her hand,'' Wallis said.
   Police were searching for the suspect, identified as Donnie E.
Russell, 18.
   Detectives said they were drawing up arrest warrants charging him
with attempted homicide, first-degree sexual assault, aggravated
robbery, first-degree arson and felony theft.
   Wallis left her business card pinched in Russell's front door
shortly after police began their search for the suspect. He called
the detective later in the day and promised to drive to police
headquarters immediately to answer questions. He never showed up,
police said.
   The teen-ager, whom the victim has known for two years, allegedly
got into her house about 10 a.m. by asking to use her telephone,
police said.

   Two police officers on their way to an
armed robbery seminar noticed a man walking down the street with
money sticking out of his pockets.
   Detective Larry Massey remarked, ``If I were on road patrol, that
would be someone I would pull over.''
   That's when a call came over the police radio Wednesday about a
$2,000 armed robbery 10 minutes earlier at an NCNB bank branch a
half-mile away.
   Massey and Officer William Martin stopped the pedestrian, Brendan
Vincent Masterson, 19, of Carol City, and drove him to the bank,
where a teller identified him as the robber.
   In addition to the cash in his pockets, Masterson was carrying
three notes that said, ``Freeze, I have a bomb. Give me all your
cash,'' police said.
   Masterson was charged with armed robbery and was being held
without bail in the Broward County Jail.

<HEAD>Dollar Up Slightly, Nikkei Down</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar inched up against the yen today, while
share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange declined for the third
consecutive day.
   The dollar closed at 146.87, up 0.22 yen from Wednesday's close.
The currency opened at 146.20 yen, 0.45 yen lower than the previous
day's close of 146.65 yen. But the dollar soared to 147.05 yen
during afternoon trading before easing down to the day's close.
   Currency dealers said market participants were waiting on the
sidelines on speculation that the West German central bank would
raise key interest rates to drive the dollar lower later in the day.
   They said the speculation caused the West German mark to rise
against the dollar, depressing the relative value of the U.S.
currency against other currencies, including the yen.
   ``When there is such speculation swirling around the market, it
is hard to buy the dollar though I believe the dollar is still quite
bullish,'' said a dealer with Daiichi Kangyo Bank, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   The dealer also said many market participants share the view that
the dollar has been rising too fast, and ``that led to easing of the
dollar today.''
   ``Traders are keeping their eyes on central banks'
intervention,'' he said.
   But another dealer with the Bank of Tokyo said the dollar is
expected to remain bullish for some time because of the strength of
the U.S. economy.
   On the stock market, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected
issues, which lost 170.64 points Wednesday, fell another 118.75
points, or 0.35 percent, to close at 34,152.56.
   Securities dealers attributed the bearishness of the stock market
to unstable exchange rates and the weakness of the yen.
   ``Many investors are sidelined until the instability of exchange
rates settles down,'' said a dealer at Nikko Securities, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   He added that buying incentives are increasing in the market
though ``the Nikkei average is not improving yet,'' he said.
   The volume traded on the first section of the exchange, where
most major shares are listed, was estimated at a moderate 600
million shares.

<TEXT>
   Comic Andrew Dice Clay was booted
off the MTV cable network after delivering a monologue laced with
lewd poetry and references to obese women and sex.
   As the MTV Video Music Awards show continued Wednesday night
shortly after Clay's segment, MTV Vice President Barry Kluger came
backstage and read to reporters a network statement expressing
``extreme regret'' for Clay's performance.
   ``As you know, our show is a live performance and we had
assurances, repeatedly, that his material would be in line with our
programming standards, which naturally preclude profanity and
obscenity,'' Kluger said.
   ``MTV apologizes for his breach of his agreement with us and we
apologize to our viewers.
   ``Andrew Dice Clay did not do this in rehearsal and we were very
surprised by it. Based on this experience, Andrew Dice Clay will not
be appearing on MTV in the future,'' Kluger said.
   The comedian had stopped by the press area immediately after his
routine and answered questions in a brief session in which he stayed
in his stage character of an arrogant chauvinist.
   He left before Kluger arrived backstage with the MTV reaction.
   Kluger would answer no questions.
   Clay's brash style caused a record company to put a warning label
on his live album, ``Dice.''

<HEAD>Boston University Takes Over Chelsea School System</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FRED BAYLES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP National Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHELSEA, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When public school students returned to
class there was something else beyond the usual change of new
classes, new teachers and new books. There also was a new
administration, run by Boston University.
   After months of sometimes bitter controversy, the private
university was at the helm of the Chelsea public school system. It
is the beginning of a 10-year experiment to see if academia's
resources can make a difference.
   ``It's like Christmas morning and we're ready to go,'' said Ted
Sharp, an assistant dean at BU's School of Education, as students
returned to class Wednesday.
   ``We're off to a positive start as far as the university was
concerned.'' Despite the fanfare, there was little evidence of the
university's new role. Signs welcomed students and university
officials in Vietnamese, Cambodian and Spanish, reflecting the
native tongues of a third of the student body.
   There also was talk of new computer system and a special program
for truants. But the university has longer-term goals than improving
attendance or school equipment.
   University officials talk of creating a new climate in this
working class community of 26,000. There are plans to teach parents
about nutrition, child care, even neo-natal care with the idea of
preparing children for school long before they can read or write.
   ``We're talking about a philosophy that education can emancipate
the underclass in the United States,'' said Peter Greer, dean of
education who oversees the management team.
   But there are many who still have doubts about the university's
involvement in the local schools. The teacher's union and Hispanic
parents have filed separate suits challenging the agreement. Others
are worried the city may be left in deeper debt if the university
doesn't raise the $2 million to $3 million it promised for special
programs this year.
   ``I'm concerned we may get stuck if the money doesn't come in,''
said Elizabeth McBride, chairwoman of the Chelsea School Committee.
``We just keep getting deeper and deeper.''
   The unique agreement between the university and Chelsea follows
years of hard times for 3,500-student system. An influx of
immigrants from Latin America and Southeast Asia swelled the school
population; declining tax revenues cut school budgets.
   Chelsea spends $1,600 less per student than the national average.
Test scores, graduation rates and teacher salaries are among the
state's lowest.
   Seeking help, school committee members approached John Silber,
president of Boston University who has long sought to use his
school's resources in public education. After months of negotiations
among the school committee, aldermen and the Legislature, an
agreement was reached in June giving the university control.
   While planners have talked about new courses and individualized
teaching plans, an emphasis has been placed on preparing children
and their parents for school. This spring, the university
experimented with a literacy program for mothers and their young
children.
   There are other plans for parental courses in nutrition, and
classes for expectant mothers, all aimed at improving the health of
future students.
   ``You can't just prepare the teachers and the building if you
want a successful school system,'' said Greer. ``You have to prepare
the students and their families.''
   But the ambitious plans require money. University officials
talked of raising $50 million through the life of its contract with
Chelsea. While more money is expected, only $726,000 in pledges are
in hand.
   And there are other concerns. Chelsea's teachers are mindful of
Silber's stormy relations with his university's unions; Hispanics,
fearful the new management might end bilingual education, went to
court to try to stop the takeover.
   The university has tried to soothe those fears, appointing a
management team with several bilingual experts, including Diana Lam,
a Peruvian-born Boston school administrator, picked to be Chelsea's
new school superintendent.
   The union has signed an interim contract with BU that gives
teachers an average bonus of $1,300.
   ``There was some apprehension on the part of the teachers,'' said
Edwin Weinstein, head of the Chelsea Teachers Union. ``Now they've
adopted a wait-and-see attitude.''
   Ms. Lam realizes it will take more than goodwill programs to end
complaints and concerns within the community.
   ``We are not going to smooth over or dismiss these problems. We
have to deal with the emotions and find a common ground,'' she said.
``But what we do is what should count. That is how we should be
judged.''

   Paula Abdul doesn't mind being
known as a former Laker Girl but the four MTV Video Music Awards
showered on her ``Straight Up'' video should help sideline the
cheerleader image.
   ``You don't want to see me weep, do you?'' she asked the audience
Wednesday night as ``Straight Up'' collected trophies for best
female video, dance, choreography and editing.
   ``I owe a lot to being a Laker Girl,'' the ex-cheerleader for the
Los Angeles basketball team said backstage. Only nominations for
best new artist and breakthrough video didn't pan out.
   Madonna, veteran rocker Neil Young and newcomers Living Colour
also were top winners at the sixth-annual event.
   Young's satirical ``This Note's for You'' won the coveted best
video award, although MTV once banned the video, ostensibly because
it contained commercial messages.
   Madonna won the Viewers' Choice trophy for ``Like a Prayer.'' Her
``Express Yourself'' video earned direction honors for David
Fincher, the art direction trophy for Vance Lorenzini, and best
cinematography for Mark Plummer.
   ``I guess this means you like me, you really like me,'' Madonna
told the crowd in a joking echo of actress Sally Field's ``You like
me'' acceptance speech at the 1984 Oscars. ``And I'd like to thank
Pepsi for causing so much controversy.''
   The Pepsi Cola Co. in April withdrew its TV commercial featuring
Madonna and its sponsorship of her tour. The commercial featured a
burning cross and other images that offended some Christians.
   Living Colour, a band that blends rock, funk, reggae and jazz,
won the best group, new artist and stage performance awards for
``Cult of Personality.'' They accepted by satellite from Pittsburgh,
where they were performing in concert with the Rolling Stones.
   ``Veronica'' gave Elvis Costello the male video honor, and
R.E.M's ``Orange Crush'' captured the post modern category.
   The career-achievement Video Vanguard award went to pop singer
George Michael.
   Rap went to D.J. Jazzy Jeff &amp; The Fresh Prince for ``Parents Just
Don't Understand.''
   ``This is a dream come true,'' said Fresh Prince, 19, who urged
all of the ``kids out there'' to ``stay away from drugs and all that
stuff.''
   ``Kiss'' by Art of Noise featuring vocals by Tom Jones was named
breakthrough video of the year.
   Guns 'N Roses had the best heavy metal video with ``Sweet Child
O' Mine'' and the combination of Irish rockers U2 and veteran
bluesman B.B. King earned a best video from film trophy for ``When
Love Comes to Town'' from the concert movie ``Rattle and Hum.''
   The show, with host Arsenio Hall, featured performances by Miss
Abdul, Cher _ in a leather jacket and skimpy teddy _ Def Leppard,
Jon Bon Jovi, Richie Sambora, and Madonna.
   Comedian Andrew Dice Clay made what became his last MTV
performance, a routine filled with obscene and unprintable poems and
comments about overweight women and sex.
   MTV Vice President Barry Kluger suddenly appeared at a backstage
press rome and issued a statement of apology: ``Andrew Dice Clay did
not do this in rehearsal and we were very surprised by it. Based on
this experience, Andrew Dice Clay will not be appearing on MTV in
the future.''
   Two stars had major disappointments. Michael Jackson's work was
nominated in eight categories, including best video for ``Leave Me
Alone,'' but came away with one special effects trophy.
   Jody Watley, the Grammy Awards' best new artist of 1988, had six
nominations for her ``Real Love'' video and came away emptyhanded.

<HEAD>Instruction Mix-up Blamed for Jetliner's Near Collision</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A TWA jetliner nearly collided with a military
plane near Chicago because the commerical plane's pilot obeyed an
air traffic controller's instruction intended for another airliner,
a federal agency said.
   TWA Flight 818, a Boeing 767 carrying 151 passengers, was flying
non-stop from St. Louis to Paris on Tuesday when it was forced to
dive to avoid the collision at 37,000 feet. Five people, including a
flight attendant, were treated for minor injuries after the jetliner
returned to St. Louis.
   The National Transportation Safety Board, which investigated the
incident, said Wednesday that the TWA jetliner dived to miss a KC-10
tanker that was part of the 452nd Air Refueling Wing out of March
Air Force Base in California.
   Radio transmissions will be reviewed, tract data reconstructed
and crew members and air traffic controllers interviewed, the NTSB
said.
   Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Mort Edelstein said
shortly after Tuesday's incident that the agency had ``had no
knowledge of air traffic controllers being involved.''
   But Keith Potts, the FAA's associate administrator of aviation
safety, said later the pilots mistakenly followed the controller's
instructions that were intended for another aircraft.
   The FAA said it was unclear whether the TWA pilot or the
controller based at Aurora, Ill., was at fault. The TWA plane and
the KC-10 tanker were within five miles of each other when the
evasive action was taken about 30 miles southeast of Chicago, the
FAA said.

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vice President Dan Quayle called the Reagan
administration's ``Star Wars'' missile defense strategy unrealistic
and unveiled a less expensive, revised version called ``Brilliant
Pebbles.''
   Instead of the system that Reagan said would end the danger of
nuclear war by making atomic weapons ``impotent,'' the Bush
administration is supporting Brilliant Pebbles, Quayle said in an
interview published in today's Los Angeles Times.
   ``We have redefined Star Wars and put it into missions,
requirements, doctrine and strategy much differently than we did in
the early 1980s,'' Quayle said.
   Under Brilliant Pebbles, clusters of mini-missiles would track
incoming rockets. The system is intended only to cope with a limited
Soviet attack or with the sort of missile strike that could be
mounted by a Third World country or some other nation that might
acquire a small arsenal of relatively unsophisticated rockets.
   Quayle declined to estimate the cost, but said it would be
cheaper than the previous administration's concept.
   He conceded that former President Reagan's plan, known formally
as the Strategic Defense Initiative, was never authentic.
   Reagan ``talked about this impenetrable shield that was going to
be completely leakproof,'' Quayle said.
   ``I believe that, in the semantics of let's say political jargon,
that that was acceptable,'' he said. ``But it clearly was stretching
the capability of a strategic defense system.''
   As a partial defense system, Star Wars might be effective, but
supporters admit it would be nearly useless defending a city because
a single warhead that got through could cause tremendous damage and
loss of life.
   Quayle said that in addition to blocking a limited Soviet attack,
the defense envisioned by the Bush administration may protect the
country from accidental missile launches or from attacks by other
nations that recently have acquired missile technology.
   He said that Brilliant Pebbles may be better received by the
Soviets and help U.S.-Soviet negotiations to reduce strategic
offensive weapons. Moscow has insisted on stringent limits on the
U.S. missile defense program as part of any strategic arms agreement.
   Quayle, who still considers the Soviet Union a dangerous
adversary, cautioned that the United States must not be duped by
apparent sweeping changes in the communist bloc.
   ``I think we have to get away from the wild euphoria that somehow
this transition and change is going to come in the real near term,''
he said. ``We are very heartened by what's happened in Poland.
Poland has made tremendous progress. We're heartened by what is
beginning to happen in Hungary. But we're also realists.
   ``Let us remind ourselves that we're still dealing with a
totalitarian government and there are going to be bumps along the
transition.''

<HEAD>Tests Help Predict Early Recurrence of Breast Cancer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   By checking cancerous tissue for one protein,
doctors believe they can help predict which women with early breast
cancer are at high risk of spreading cancer, according to a report
published today.
   Doctors who experimented with this approach found that by testing
for the protein, called haptoglobin-related protein, they could
identify women who had an extremely high risk of recurrence.
   They said that the presence of the protein ``appears to be a
powerful primary discriminator between clinically aggressive and
clinically indolent breast cancers.'' Its prediction power is
``dramatically improved'' when it is combined with information about
the sensitivity of the tumors to the hormone progesterone.
   The research was conducted by Dr. Francis P. Kuhajda and
colleagues at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and
published in the New England Journal of Medicine.
   The study was based on 70 patients with early breast cancer who
were treated by mastectomy from 1977 through 1985. Doctors checked
samples of their tumor tissue for the protein as well as sensitivity
to progesterone.
   Overall, the cancer returned in 31 women. The study found that it
recurred in 91 percent of those whose tumors produced the protein
but were not sensitive to progesterone. By contrast, it recurred in
24 percent who showed no signs of the hormone but were sensitive to
progesterone.
   Doctors hope that such information will help them identify women
who might benefit from aggressive early therapy, such as
chemotherapy and mastectomy rather than lump removal.

<HEAD>Therapies Aimed at Blood Vessel Protein May Avert Malaria Complications</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New therapy to block malaria infection from
harming the brain may result from a study that implicates a protein
in that problem and other serious complications of the disease,
researchers say.
   Scientists reported today that red blood cells infected with a
malaria-causing parasite stick to the protein, which is found in the
inner lining of blood vessels.
   Attachment of infected red cells to vessel walls is thought to
play an important part in producing complications of malaria, said
researcher Anthony Berendt.
   For example, it makes red cells clog some blood vessels of the
brain. The clogging is a key factor in cerebral malaria, a
complication reponsible for more than half the world's deaths from
malaria, said scientist Luis Fajardo of Stanford University Medical
School.
   Berendt said that if further work demonstrates that the protein
plays a key role in cerebral malaria, finding drugs aimed at
dislodging the red cells from the protein may prove useful.
   Berendt, of John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford, England, and
colleagues there describe their work in the British journal Nature.
   The protein is called intercellular adhesion molecule-1, or
ICAM-1. Two other proteins, called CD36 and thrombospondin, had
previously been implicated as possible attachment sites for infected
red cells.
   But studies suggested those proteins could not account for all
cases of red cell attachment, Berendt said in a telephone interview.
That led to the work that implicates ICAM-1, and there may be still
more blood vessel proteins involved, Berendt said.
   Fajardo, a pathology professor at Stanford, said the findings
were very important.
   Fewer than 1 percent of the world's estimated 100 million to 200
million annual malaria cases are thought to progress to cerebral
malaria, but it probably kills more than 500,000 people a year in
Africa alone, he said.
   The condition can be treated with quinine, but new drugs would be
welcome because quinine does not always work and because it has
undesirable side effects, Fajardo said.
   Malaria occurs after a parasite is injected into the bloodstream
from the bite of a mosquito. The Nature paper shows that red blood
cells infected by the most dangerous species of malaria parasite,
Plasmodium falciparum, can stick to the protein ICAM-1.
   That protein is widely distributed in the inner linings of
capillaries, the tiny blood vessels where red cells can attach
themselves in malaria, researchers said.
   In the test tube, red cells infected by a parasite strain from
Brazil stuck to the ICAM-1 protein on the surface of tissue cells.
Red cells infected by a strain from Gambia did not.
   The rate of binding increased after the tissue cells were exposed
to tumor necrosis factor, a natural substance known to stimulate
production of ICAM-1.
   Fajardo said that fits in with research that found higher levels
of tumor necrosis factor in malaria patients who suffered cerebral
malaria than patients who did not.
   The British researchers are now preparing to test a range of
parasite strains to see how widespread the affinity for ICAM-1 is,
Berendt said.
   In the Nature paper, they suggested that the severity of a case
of malaria may depend on red cell affinity for various blood vessel
proteins, as determined by the infecting parasite, and the infected
person's levels of those proteins.

<HEAD>Study: Women's Cholesterol Changes After Menopause</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The discovery of sharp changes in women's blood
cholesterol levels during menopause may help explain why their heart
attack risk soars when they reach their 50s, according to a report
published today.
   In the research, doctors measured changes in two main components
of cholesterol _ high density lipoprotein, or HDL, and low density
lipoprotein, or LDL _ as women reached the change of life. HDL
protects against heart disease, while LDL increases the risk.
   The researchers found that women's HDL levels dropped four
milligrams per deciliter of blood when they went through menopause,
while their LDL rose 12 milligrams.
   Dr. Karen A. Matthews said the study supports the idea that ``the
menopause does lead to increased risk of coronary artery disease in
women because of the negative changes in lipids.''
   While heart disease is rare in women before menopause, their risk
increases 10-fold after age 55.
   Matthews, a researcher at the University of Pittsburgh, directed
the study, which was published in the New England Journal of
Medicine.
   The study found that when menopausal women took estrogen
supplements, there was little change in their blood cholesterol
levels.
   Matthews said more study will be necessary before researchers
recommend routine use of estrogen to protect against heart disease.
Estrogen supplements after menopause have been linked with an
increase risk of some forms of cancer.
   She said that women should become more aware of their cholesterol
as they reach menopause.
   ``As women enter the period when they likely to undergo
menopause, which is around 50, it's an ideal time for them to have
their cholesterol levels regularly checked,'' she said. ``If they
begin to experience declines in HDL or increases in LDL, it would be
very useful to alter dietary factors and exercise to have a more
health-promoting lifestyle.''
   The study began with 541 women between ages 42 and 50 who had not
undergone menopause. Over the next 2{ years, 101 of them stopped
menstruating, and 32 of these women began taking estrogen
supplements.
   Their HDL and LDL levels were compared to those of women the same
age who had not reached menopause.

<HEAD>Bank, Texan Guilty In Money Laundering; Consular, Bank Officials
Innocent</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A Yugoslavian diplomat and a bank chairman
have been cleared of conspiring to launder nearly $3.5 million
provided by undercover agents posing as mobsters, but a Texas
businessman has been found guilty.
   Hubert Cole, an admitted money launderer, testified he lied when
he told investigators that 48-year-old Bahrudin Bijedic,
Yugoslavia's consul general in Chicago, gave him consular seals,
which bar U.S. officials from opening packages, and an official
courier letter to help him transport cash to Yugoslavia.
   ``In 10 years I've represented many not guilty people, but only
four innocent men. Bijedic was one of them,'' attorney Michael C.
Goode said.
   Vinko Mir, 55, chairman of LBS Bank of New York, also was
acquitted of the conspiracy charge, but his bank, a branch of
Ljubljanska Banka of Yugoslavia was convicted and faces a $500,000
fine.
   Businessman Vjekoslav Spanjol, 42, of Plano, Texas, was convicted
too and faces a sentence of about 60 years in prison and a $4.1
million fine, Assistant U.S. Attorney Paul A. Sarmousakis said.
   Lawyer Denver G. McCarty said he would appeal Spanjol's
conviction. Vince Fuller, the bank's lawyer, could not be reached
after the verdict.
   ``I thought it was entirely possible that he'd be found not
guilty on everything. I was surprised he and the bank were found
guilty of the conspiracy because he did not have anything to do with
the bank or its officers,'' McCarty said.
   Spanjol, Bijedic, Mir and the bank branch were charged with
conspiring to launder $3.47 million by depositing the money in
Yugoslavia and wiring it back to accounts in the United States to
conceal its source.
   Spanjol, a naturalized citizen, and LBS Bank of New York were
convicted of conspiracy to obstruct the U.S. Treasury from
collecting taxes, gathering accurate information on domestic
currency transactions and obtaining information on international
cash movements.
   Spanjol was found guilty of seven other counts, including
smuggling out of the country two underwater breathing devices
restricted by the State Department. The jury acquitted him of two
related counts.
   All three men were arrested Dec. 1, 1988. Cole and Spanjol were
apprehended at Philadelphia International Airport as they tried to
ship $2 million to Yugoslavia, Customs officials said.
   Cole, 44, of Carrollton, Texas, who had faced up to 230 years in
jail and a $10.6 million fine, pleaded guilty to money laundering
charges and agreed to testify for prosecutors.
   Larry Card of Chattanooga, Tenn., who could have been sentenced
to five years in jail and fined $250,000, also pleaded guilty in the
case and testified for the government.

   An exile's life is not what Wu'er Kaixi
wanted, but he took a leading role in China's student uprising last
spring and when the dust had settled was on his government's
most-wanted list.
   Wu'er, a student at Beijing Normal University, made a dangerous
10-day journey to escape his homeland. Now he's starting over as a
student at Harvard University, but he told The Associated Press on
Wednesday his eye is still on the battle back home.
   ``If you experience that kind of massacre it changes your life,''
said Wu'er. ``Whenever I think of my friends who were murdered in
Tiananmen Square, I feel the obligation.''
   The China Information Center here is now his focus. It's through
this hub's telephones, fax machines and computers that he works to
effect change back home.
   In June, the events in Beijing riveted the world and millions saw
Wu'er's drawn face as he stood up to Premier Li Peng and demanded a
dialogue.
   Then came the quiet morning after troops stormed the square,
killing hundreds, maybe thousands. Only a few who fled could carry
on in the wake of such force.
   He and his girlfriend navigated China's backroads for 10 days
before they finally reached the South China Sea and what seemed the
only route to go.
   ``The first step I took was into the sea, and I knew that I
wouldn't go back,'' he said. ``I didn't feel anything because it was
just after the massacre and my feelings were already frozen.''
   Those few, bloody days last spring also numbed the Chinese
people, but they did not cower, Wu'er said.
   ``This is a famous face now,'' the tall, muscular man said.
   ``But in the city and in the country, the people protected me.
Even people who I didn't know kept quiet and immediately showed
support,'' said Wu'er, who tried to find a way out of the country
from eight cities before succeeding.
   The people didn't like the government before, but dislike has
been displaced by hatred since their sons and daughters were gunned
down in June, Wu'er said.
   He and many other exiled students, their supporters and those who
remain at work underground in China, are getting the word out and
forming unions.
   ``We aren't organized officially, of course, because the
government doesn't want it,'' said Wu'er, who refused to provide
many details on the escape. ``But we can establish a voice outside
China.''
   He said that on a recent trip to Paris he helped form a group
called The Front for Democratic China as a central organization to
coordinate efforts outside of China. He said a congress would be
held later this month in Paris to set an agenda and elect a
governing board.
   China's largest newspaper recently featured Wu'er, complete with
various statements about his character _ all derisive. But the
insults don't vex him.
   ``They're paying a lot of attention to what we're doing outside.
And that means they're scared,'' said Wu'er.
   Wu'er says chance played a large part in his own place in the
spotlight.
   ``When I was a freshman (in Beijing) I loved beer and parties,
like American kids,'' he said. ``But the political and economic
situation forced me to think about the country's system...
   ``I stood in the front because I care about my self-worth,''
Wu'er, who will study English in his first semester at Harvard, said
through a translator. ``I stood in front because the government
doesn't allow ... the Chinese people to realize their own
self-worth.''

   It's being called Love Canal II and
lately a trailer park where toxic contamination was discovered has
begun to resemble the infamous toxic waste site just three miles
away.
   A house at the entrance to the Forest Glen trailer park, one of
two non-trailers in the subdivision of 53 families, was the first to
be boarded up Monday. The house's owner, Dennis Bauer, has relocated
to Lewiston, about 10 miles north of Niagara Falls.
   The Bauer family was one of 23 households in Forest Glen where
traces of benzothiazole, a carcinogenic industrial chemical, were
found. The federal Environmental Protection Agency said the amounts
in the homes were so small that they are not a health concern.
   Nonetheless, the Bauers left a sofa on their front lawn with the
words ``Danger Contaminated'' spray-painted on it.
   Such displays were common 11 years ago when dioxin and other
contaminants were discovered at the Love Canal neighborhood.
Eventually, 1,030 families were evacuated from a 10-block area
around the former chemical dump site.
   Forest Glen, home to some of the people who left Love Canal, also
was built on a toxic dump.
   EPA spokesman Michael Basile said the Bauers' property will be
padlocked and that a private security force has been hired to patrol
the area.
   Despite the EPA's recommendation to leave the neighborhood, some
residents said they did not want to move away temporarily because
they were afraid their homes would be looted.
   Many homes in Love Canal were vandalized after the evacuations.
The dilapidated homes still stand as a monument to environmental
disaster, although some have been torn down as part of a plan to
revitalize the area.
   Federal officials have made no determination on the long-term
future of Forest Glen. Until residents are out, there can be no
excavations to determine the extent of the contamination, officials
said.
   As of Monday, the Federal Emergency Management Agency had taken
24 applications for temporary relocation, said spokesman Bert
Gallowing.
   Of those, six have moved off-site, eight have found new
residences and are waiting to move, and 10 others are still looking.
   Twenty-three other families are considering moving their trailers
out of the park. Six families have not announced plans and are
believed to be waiting for the federal buyout, which is expected to
take up to a year.
   Basile said once families moved, the EPA will board up their
homes to protect them from vandalism.

   Greek objections to NATO proposals on
limiting military maneuvers in Europe prevented their introduction
as East and West resumed their search today for ways to reduce the
armies and weapons massed across Europe.
   Diplomats who asked not to be identified said the NATO proposals
required further consultation after Greece began voicing objections
to them early in the week.
   NATO diplomats in Vienna and Brussels worked hard Wednesday to
put the finishing touches to the proposal, billed by senior
officials as an unprecedented effort to curb military exercises on
the world's most heavily armed continent.
   But Greece objected to provisions mandating that maneuvers
requiring the callup of 40,000 or more reservists and the use of
1,200 or more armored personnel carriers be announced in advance,
diplomatic sources said.
   Athens, which is traditionally wary of NATO ally and neighbor
Turkey, was seeking lower limits, they said, adding they viewed this
as a ``psychological problem'' that could be overcome.
   NATO and the Warsaw Pact also hope during this six-week round to
present what both sides bill as sweeping proposals on verification.
   But diplomats from both military blocs, speaking on condition of
anonymity, have suggested they are finding it difficult to reconcile
interests within their two alliances.
   U.S. Ambassador Stephen J. Ledogar said in an interview Wednesday
that ``some tough problems'' have so far blocked a NATO compromise
on verification proposals.
   He mentioned specifically differences between the United States
and Canada, which are pushing for maximum verification, and European
nations that are concerned this would mean almost constant visits by
military inspectors from the Soviet bloc.
   But both Ledogar and a diplomat from another NATO nation
expressed confidence the verification proposals would be ready
during the current round of talks.
   Soviet ambassador Oleg A. Grinevsky, in an interview with West
Germany's ZDF television station, announced Warsaw Pact intentions
of introducing sweeping verification proposals he billed as bolder
than anything NATO could produce.
   Reiterating offers Western diplomats said had been made during
earlier closed-door negotiations, Grinevsky said the Soviet Union
would even be prepared to countenance the permanent stationing of
NATO officers on its territory to check its compliance with eventual
accords to cut Europe's non-nuclear weapons. He revealed no other
details.
   The 23-nation Vienna talks opened in March and, despite
continuing differences over definitiions of weapons and which
categories to cut first, have moved along briskly.
   Most diplomats at the talks have dismissed President Bush's goal
of agreement by year's end as too optimistic. But Ledogar said he
thought it realistic to aim for some agreements by next year.
   Grinevsky also told West German television that 1990 was a
realistic target for preliminary agreement, after what he called the
``unique breakthrough'' achieved in the first two rounds of talks.
   President Bush has proposed limiting the United States and the
Soviet Union to no more than 275,000 troops outside their borders in
Europe.
   The West wants no more than 20,000 tanks, 16,500 artillery pieces
and 28,000 armored troop carriers for each alliance.
   On the sensitive issue of aircraft, identifed by both East and
West as the biggest stumbling block of the talks, NATO proposes that
East and West each be limited to no more than 5,700 combat aircraft
and 1,900 combat helicopters.
   No one country could have more than 3,420 combat aircraft and
1,140 combat helicopters.
   The Warsaw Pact in March proposed to reduce six kinds of weapons,
including aircraft, by 10 to 15 percent by 1994, cutting by a
further 25 percent by 1997 and moving to purely defensive forces by
the year 2000.
   The Soviet Union, which under Mikhail S. Gorbachev is clearly
anxious to save on military spending to meet pressing consumer
demands at home, has also begun unilateral troop withdrawals from
eastern Europe.
   Some 50,000 Red Army soldiers and 5,000 tanks are to leave
Hungary, East Germany and Czechoslovakia by the end of 1990.

   Rebels in northern Ethiopia say they have
taken four more towns, including a strategic government garrison, in
an offensive that began last week.
   The clandestine radio of the Tigray People's Liberation Front
said Wednesday the rebels had captured the garrison town of Weldiya
in Wollo Province, killing 103 government soldiers and capturing 26.
   The broadcast was monitored in Nairobi on the eve of scheduled
peace talks in Atlanta in the United States between the government
and another major rebel group, the Eritrean People's Liberation
Front.
   The Tigrean rebels also said they had overrun three smaller towns
in Wollo Province in three days of heavy fighting that began Aug.
31. The radio identified them as Robit, Gobiye and Dorogebir.
   The Tigrean front, newly allied with the Ethiopian People's
Democratic Movement, had earlier claimed the capture of a string of
towns along a major highway leading south toward Addis Ababa, the
capital.
   Weldiya, about 200 miles north of the capital, is an important
junction on the north-south highway, connecting it with a route
running west to Gondar Province.
   The Eritrean rebels have been fighting since 1962 for the
independence of Ethiopia's northernmost province.
   The Tigreans seek greater autonomy for their region, which is
immediately to the south of Eritrea.
   The Ethiopian People's Democratic Movement is a much smaller
group that has been active in Wollo and Gondar provinces.

<HEAD>Judge Says Sodomy Law Can't Be Used Against Consenting Couples</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Georgia's 156-year-old sodomy law cannot be
applied to consenting married couples, a judge ruled in clearing a
man who spent 18 months in prison for having oral sex with his wife.
   A lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union lauded the ruling
Wednesday as a step toward getting rid of ``this monstrous statute.''
   Superior Court Judge Robert Castellani said James D. Moseley, a
35-year-old carpenter, had been imprisoned illegally. He was serving
a two-year term.
   ``Government has no business with a married couple's private
consentual sexual practices,'' Castellani wrote. Moseley's ``right
to marital and domestic privacy has been violated by the sodomy law
as applied to him.''
   ``Whew! I feel like someone took a millstone from around my
neck,'' said Moseley, apparently the first person convicted under
the law for conduct between marriage partners. The judge had freed
him last week pending a decision.
   Attorney General Michael Bowers said the state may appeal after
an examination of whether the ruling might reach beyond married
couples.
   Bowers said he agreed that the sodomy law cannot be applied to
consenting married couples. But the prosecutor had argued that the
evidence suggested Moseley's wife did not consent to the sodomy.
   ``I think at least all married couples can celebrate,'' said
Clive Stafford-Smith, an ACLU lawyer who represented Moseley. ``They
can bring out the champagne. But there are still a large number of
nervous people in Georgia who are not married.''
   Moseley's common-law wife, Bette Roberts, had accused him of
forcing himself on her and she filed a complaint in 1988 that led to
Moseley being charged with rape, and aggravated, or forcible, oral
and anal sodomy.
   Moseley denied using force and was acquitted on those counts but
was found guilty of the lesser charge of oral sodomy after admitting
the couple had oral sex. Georgia law makes oral sex a crime even
between consenting adults.
   The judge said that the jury's acquittal of Moseley on the rape
and aggravated sodomy charges meant it believed no force had been
involved.
   Castellani cited a recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling that upheld
application of the sodomy law against homosexuals. The majority
decision in that case acknowledged the law might not hold up if
applied to married couples.

<HEAD>Businesses Increase Capital Spending Plans</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government reported today that American
businesses plan to increase spending on plants and equipment by 7.7
percent in 1989, a sign that many company managers do not believe a
recession is imminent.
   Businesses responding to a Commerce Department survey completed
in August said they expected to spend $463.95 billion for expansion
and modernization this year, up from a record $430.74 billion spent
on business investment in 1988. The 1988 figure was revised from
$423.69 billion reported earlier. The numbers are adjusted for
inflation.
   Some economists had feared that business leaders would be
inclined to cut back on capital spending if they felt a severe
economic slowdown was on the horizen.
   There was concern earlier this year that the economy, now
approaching its seventh year of growth, might be headed for a
recession as the Federal Reserve tightened credit in an attempt to
contain inflation.
   However, interest rates began creeping down last spring and a
number of statistics since then have shown an economy that is
slowing, though not as fast as previously thought.
   The new estimate for capital spending this year shows businesses
were increasing their plans for plant and equipment spending as the
year wore on. An earlier survey released in June found businesses
planning to increase spending by 6.5 percent. A March survey
indicated a 6.3 percent increase.
   In an even earlier survey of 1989 business investment plans,
conducted last December, companies had estimated their capital
spending could rise 5.9 percent this year.
   Economists generally interpret plant and equipment spending as a
plus for the economy because it indicates continued expansion and
eases inflationary pressures by increasing productive capacity.
   Capital spending grew a revised 8.9 percent in 1988, the
department said, as companies rushed to expand production to meet
rising export demand.
   Spending climbed a revised 4.2 percent in 1987 and dropped 3.9
percent in 1986.
   In the latest survey, manufacturing companies said they planned a
6.1 percent increase in capital outlays to $178.24 billion, compared
to a revised 11.7 percent in 1988. This includes a 2.8 percent rise
in plants that produce durable goods, big-ticket items expected to
last three years or more, and a 9.1 percent increase in companies
producing non-durable goods.
   Companies engaged in mining, transportation and other
non-manufacturing ventures are expected to increase spending by 8.7
percent to $285.72 billion.
   Before adjusting for inflation, 1989 plant and equipment spending
is expected to rise 10 percent to $473.65 billion, down from 10.5
percent in 1988.

<HEAD>Officials Arrested For Corruption; African Leader Makes Visit</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Four veteran Communist Party members have been
convicted of making thousands of dollars through corruption, a
government newspaper reported today.
   The Economic Daily said the officials admitted their guilt and
are awaiting sentencing. It said they were expelled from the party.
   The officials, three from the northeast province of Heilongjiang
and one from Inner Mongolia, have been members of the party for at
least 40 years.
   Also today, China welcomed its first foreign head of state to the
country since the June 3-4 military attack on pro-democracy
protesters. President Blaise Compaore of the western Africa country
of Burkina Faso was welcomed in Tiananmen Square with a 21-gun
salute.
   ``You are the first head of state since we quelled the
counterrevolutionary rebellion,'' President Yang Shangkun said to
Compaore after the ceremony.
   The Economic Daily said Wang Lizhong, former head of the
Petrochemical Industry and Environmental Protection bureaus in
Heilongjiang; and Guan Wenbin, former vice-director of the Daqing
Petrochemical factory, purchased 200 tons of benzene and 1,000 tons
of petroleum coke at lower state-set prices and then sold the
materials on the open market.
   Wang made $5,135 on the deals and Guan received $5,400, the paper
said.
   The newspaper quoted Guan as saying after his arrest: ``My wife
and children work, my family's living conditions are pretty good. I
used to not pay much attention to money, but now I'm old and
selfish, I was thinking too much of myself ... It's a bitter
lesson.''
   Yao Zhiwu, an engineer and party official in Inner Mongolia, was
convicted of accepting bribes totaling $5,400 from two construction
companies.
   ``I was so stupid,'' the newspaper quoted Yao as saying. ``I have
enough money _ I just thought that if I had a little more, things
would be more convenient.''
   Yao conceded he committed the crime because his ``capitalistic
world vision had not been completely reformed.''
   Li Kexiang, former vice-director of the Daqing Petrochemical
Factory in Heilongjiang, also accepted bribes of $2,700. ``My will
power is too weak,'' the Economic Daily quoted him as saying.
   The newspaper said they are awaiting sentencing.
   Corruption was a key issue raised by students during the
nationwide pro-democracy movement this spring.
   After the crackdown of the movement, China announced a major
anti-corruption campaign that would include top government officials
and party members.
   Most of the cases involved officials who obtain large supplies of
scarce raw materials at low government-set prices and then sell them
for large profits on the free market.
   The visit by Compaore was the first by a head of state since
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev visited in mid-May, when the
student-led protests that began April 15 reached their peak.
   Up to 1 million people crowded Tiananmen Square, forcing
humiliated officials to cancel ceremonies planned for Gorbachev in
the vast plaza.
   Compaore was welcomed by Yang, one of the key figures behind the
government's decision to send troops to crush the student
demonstrators. Hundreds, perhaps thousands, were believed killed in
the crackdown.
   ``Your excellency and other African leaders have fully understood
and supported the quelling of the counter-revolutionary rebellion in
Beijing. That's why we have to thank you,'' Yang told Compaore.
   High-level diplomatic contacts with the West have been largely
frozen since the crackdown, with the United States and other Western
countries condemning the Chinese leadership for its violent
suppression of the student movement.

<DATELINE>TITUSVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Arlee Andre, creator of the original
Duncan Hines cake mixes, has died at age 89.
   Andre, who died Monday, was a cereal chemist testing flour for
Nebraska Consolidated Mills in Omaha in 1952 when he decided to
develop a cake mix with better flavor and uniformity than the two
mixes then commercially available.
   Working after hours and on his own time, Mr. Andre researched the
best ways to make yellow cake, white cake, chocolate cake and angel
food cake.
   ``My sister and I were more or less raised on it. We were the
test subjects,'' said his son, Alan. ``He'd bring home these little
cakes, unfrosted, with little numbers on them. He'd say, `Taste them
and tell me what you think.'
   ``Of course, we weren't good critics; my sister and I were
children and liked them all.''
   When the mixes were ready to be marketed, Nebraska Consolidated
Mills paid food and drink connoisseur Duncan Hines a penny a box to
use his name. The mixes quickly became popular and were sold to
Procter &amp; Gamble in 1956.
   Andre also moved to the conglomerate and retired from P&amp;G in the
mid-1960s.
   Besides a son and daughter, survivors include his wife, Thelma,
four grandchildren and one great-grandchild.
   Services will be private.

<HEAD>Two Arrested in Sabotage of U.S. Distribution of Films</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two film makers were arrested today on
charges of sabotaging the distribution of U.S. films in South Korea,
police said.
   One of the suspects, Yoo Dong-hun, chairman of the Korean Film
Workers Association, admitted hiring others to attack theaters doing
business with a Holywood-based film distributor, Universal
International Pictures, by releasing snakes in the theaters and
attacking the buildings with firebombs, police said.
   Yoo, 48, and screenwriter Lee Jung-u, 45, were charged with
arranging the sabotage. On Monday, two film directors were arrested
on similar charges.
   Police said today they are searching for three Koreans accused of
carrying out the attacks on the theaters. Their names were not
released.
   In an unrelated development today, prosecutors indicted two Roman
Catholic priests for sending a fellow priest to escort home a South
Korean radical student who had made an illegal trip to Communist
North Korea.
   Yoo and Lee have been active in a campaign opposing Universal
International Pictures releases in South Korea. Yoo also reportedly
collected funds from movie producers to launch campaign against the
U.S. films.
   Police said Yoo arranged a firebomb attack Aug. 13 on Seoul's
Cine House. The theater was partly burned, but no injuries were
reported. The non-poisonous snakes were released into another
theater last year.
   Universal International Pictures has faced a boycott campaign by
South Korean film workers since its first film, ``Fatal
Attraction,'' was shown in September. The South Korean film industry
wants to handle the distribution of U.S. films itself, rather than
see a foreign company do it.
   A trade law adopted last year allowed U.S. companies to bypass
South Korean distributors by releasing films directly to cinemas.
   Revs. Nam Kook-hyun, 40, and Park Byong-jun, 37, were charged
with sending a fellow priest, Moon Gyu-hyon, to accompany a radical
student across the border with North Korea on Aug. 15 after her
illegal trip to the North.
   If prosecutors from the Seoul District Prosecutors' Office win
convictions for the priests, they could receive up to seven years in
prison.
   The radical student, Im Su-kyong, 20, will be formally indicted
Friday on charges of making an illegal trip to North Korea to attend
a World Youth Festival there July 1-8, prosecution officials said.
If she is found guilty, she could receive up to 10 years in prison
under the National Security Law.
   Im, a student at Seoul's Hankuk University, said her North Korean
trip was aimed at promoting unification of the divided Korean
peninsula. Her arrest touched off violent anti-government protests
by radical students in the South.
   Radicals stepped up anti-government protests to press their
demand for the release of Im, whom they described as ``the flower of
unification.''
   South Korea bans unauthorized trips to North Korea, an enemy
country since the division of the Korean peninsula in 1945. The two
Koreas fought a three-year war in the early 1950's.

<TEXT>
   Security has been tightened around some New York
City judges following a death threat from a caller claiming to be a
member of a Colombian drug cartel, authorities said.
   The anonymous call was made at 2 a.m. Saturday to the FBI in New
York City.
   ``An anonymous call is just that. It's hard to verify or judge
the level of the threat,'' said FBI spokesman Joe Valiquette.
   Alfred Lerner, administrative judge of the Supreme Court in the
city's borough of Queens, said the caller threatened to kill a judge
in Kew Gardens, a Queens neighborhood. He said he called a meeting
in the court's Kew Gardens branch and told 25 judges about the
threat after learning of it Wednesday.
   ``I don't know if it's a crank call, but I think (the judges)
have a right to know,'' Lerner said.
   One judge, Vincent Naro, a past target of death threats, was
escorted to his car Wednesday by a police officer, New York Newsday
reported today. Extra court officers were posted in the Kew Gardens
courthouse parking lot as well.
   Other, unspecified measures have been taken to protect the 77
judges of the Queens Supreme and Criminal courts, said John Perno,
director of security at the Office of Court Administration. In New
York, Supreme Court is a trial-level court.
   ``I took the necessary measures we ordinarily take when we learn
of death threats,'' Perno said. Judges in other court branches were
also told of the call.

<HEAD>Court Hears $810-Million Suit Against Marcos</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A court today began hearing an $810
million lawsuit against Ferdinand Marcos based on the former
president's tax returns.
   It is the first case against Marcos that has gone to trial in the
Philippines since he was ousted three years ago.
   In all, the government has filed 35 civil suits since in 1987 to
recover $100 billion that Marcos and 300 associates are accused of
stealing during his 24 years in power. He was forced into exile in
Hawaii after a popular-military uprising ousted him in February 1986.
   Solicitor General Frank Chavez said he expects to call as many as
20 witnesses and hopes the trial will persuade courts in Switzerland
and elsewhere to speed up proceedings to recover money Marcos
allegedly invested abroad.
   ``This is the first real, significant step toward the recovery of
ill-gotten wealth,'' Chavez said.
   In the case, being heard in the nation's anti-graft court, the
government is seeking $476 million in damages and recovery of up to
$334 million in property Marcos and his wife, Imelda, allegedly
purchased in New York.
   Government lawyers said they will argue that Marcos and his wife
owned properties worth far more than they could afford based on
assets declared in income tax returns.
   Assistant Solicitor General Romeo de la Cruz told the three-judge
panel that Marcos' presidential annual salary totaled $71,000 for
his nearly quarter-century in power. Mrs. Marcos earned $34,000
during nine years as minister of human settlements and governor of
the Metro Manila Commission, de la Cruz said.
   Eliseo Pitargue, intelligence chief of the Bureau of Internal
Revenue, testified that between 1960 and 1984, the couple declared
total assets equivalent to $657,000 at current exchange rates.
   They paid nearly $271,000 in income taxes in that time, Pitargue
said.
   Chavez said Marcos' tax records will ``establish the patently
gross and scandalously disproportionate acquisition of Mr. Marcos on
the basis of his declared wealth.''
   Marcos' lawyers, Rafael Recto and Juan David, were in the
courtroom but told reporters they are not representing the couple.
Recto said he will report to Marcos on the proceedings.
   ``This is all a big charade,'' Recto told reporters before the
proceedings adjourned until Friday. ``This case will take about 100
years more.''
   Marcos had insisted on his right to defend himself, but the court
ruled he forfeited it by ignoring subpoenas delivered to his
Honolulu home.
   President Corazon Aquino, Marcos' successor, has refused to allow
him to return, citing national security. Marcos is reported in
critical condition at a Honolulu hospital, where he has been
confined since January with heart, kidney and lung failure.
   Marcos and his wife were indicted by a U.S. federal grand jury
last year on racketeering charges for allegedly pillaging the
Philippine treasury and investing some of the money in the United
States.
   Mrs. Marcos denied the charges and is free on $5 million bail.
Marcos was temporarily separated from the case because of failing
health.
   The Marcoses have never been charged with a criminal offense in a
Philippine court because the government fears they would invoke
their constitutional right to return to face their accusers.

<HEAD>MBTA Settles Suit Over Racial Attack</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The city transit agency has agreed to pay at least
$689,000 to the estate and children of a black man who was struck
and killed by a subway train after being chased into a station by a
gang of whites in 1982.
   The settlement was reached in July and made public Wednesday by
the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority in response to a
Freedom of Information Act request by The Boston Globe.
   William F. Atkinson Jr., a 30-year-old janitor, died after
fleeing a group of white men who chased him in the city's Dorchester
section. In 1985, two men were convicted of manslaughter and three
of assault in the attack.
   The settlement stemmed from a $10 million negligence and
wrongful-death suit filed by the mothers of Atkinson's children,
ages 10 and 19.
   The suit alleged that MBTA workers neglected to notify police
immediately when Atkinson and a friend fled into the station and
failed to alert train operators that Atkinson had run onto the
tracks.
   The suit also claimed that the train that hit Atkinson was
operating without headlights.
   The MBTA also agreed to pay $138,000 to Atkinson's estate, of
which some will go to his children. The agency will also pay the
children at least $551,000 in installments for the rest of their
lives, the Globe said today.
   The children are Atkinson's sole heirs because their mothers
never married him.
   Atkinson was walking along a street around 12:30 a.m. with a
white friend, William Grady, when a group of whites began shouting
racial epithets, hurling bottles and threatening to kill the pair,
authorities said.
   The suit claimed that William Davulis, a coin changer, failed to
call police when Atkinson ran into the station and called for help.
It was not until Davulis saw Grady punched that he finally called
for help, the suit alleged.
   Davulis called police a second time after he was initially placed
on hold but left for home before police arrived, the suit said. MBTA
police arrived seven minutes later, looked around, saw no one, and
left, the Globe reported.

<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell today
assailed a proposed capital-gains tax cut as a break for the rich
that would be paid for by middle-income Americans.
   In addition, he said, the cut proposed by President Bush and
others would undoubtedly cause a loss of government revenue ``over
any period of time beyond one year'' and thus would worsen the
budget deficit.
   ``The present proposal is unfair, unwise,'' the Maine Democrat
told reporters. It is ``effectively a tax break for the wealthy to
be paid for by the middle class. It is a $31,000-a-year tax break
for those whose income exceeds $200,000 a year.''
   A capital-gains reduction also would unravel the big 1986 tax
overhaul, Mitchell added. When the tax system was rewritten by
Congress, capital gains was only one of several special tax breaks
that were wiped out in order to allow a significant reduction of tax
rates.
   Under the new law, capital gains _ profits from the sale of stock
and other assets _ are taxed at the same rate as wages and other
income. Bush has proposed to reduce the rate to 15 percent.
   Mitchell reasons that if a preference is restored for capital
gains, pressure will increase to bring back other benefits that were
ended in 1986.
   In that regard, Sens. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., and Christopher
Dodd, D-Conn., announced today they were introducing a bill to
restore tax-deductible Individual Retirement Accounts for all
workers, regardless of income. The 1986 law restricted deductible
IRAs only to lower-paid workers and those not covered by a company
pension.
   In running for the presidency last year, Bush promised to seek a
reduction in the capital-gains tax in order to spur investment and
saving.
   A majority of the House Ways and Means Committee favors a
temporary cut in the capital-gains tax, which could help reduce the
budget deficit in the short term by prompting investors to sell some
assets they have been holding for some time.
   However, many economists dispute the administration's contention
that a capital-gains cut would produce long-term revenue gains.
   The Ways and Means Committee is weighing an alternative by
Chairman Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., that would protect against
taxation of gains caused solely by inflation and also provide more
favorable tax treatment of long-term gains.
   But Mitchell said now is not the time to even consider a
capital-gains cut, chiefly because of the budget deficit.
   He noted that in 1986, when tax overhaul was being debated, he
offered an amendment that would have retained a special tax break
for capital gains _ but only as part of a plan that would include a
higher tax rate on income of all kinds earned by wealthier taxpayers.
   That amendment was defeated when 49 of the 53 Republican senators
voted against it. Now, Mitchell said, Republicans have made a
complete reversal and want a lower rate for capital gains.
   The Internal Revenue Service estimates that 70 percent of the
benefit of a capital-gains cut would go to those with incomes over
$100,000 a year.

<HEAD>Hungary's Communist Party to Divest Itself of Some Assets</HEAD>

   The Communist Party will turn over
millions of dollars to the government and open its books for
inspection as it prepares to share power, the state newspaper said
today.
   Imre Pozsgay, a reformist member of the four-man Communist
leadership, made the pledge Wednesday to opposition groups
discussing the political shape of Hungary as the country gears up
for free elections next year, the paper said.
   The talks, focusing on preparations for the first free elections
since the 1948 Communist takeover, frequently have been bogged down.
   But the newspaper, Magyar Hirlap, reported some progress after
the Wednesday session agreed to increase the number of seats in
Parliament from 350 to 374. Other issues remained in dispute, it
said.
   MTI, the state news agency, said Pozsgay was defeated in an
election Wednesday of delegates to the Oct. 6 Communist Party
congress where reformists are expected to battle orthodox Marxists
over the Communist Party's future.
   He will have a vote at the session anyway because he is a member
of the 113-member Communist Party Central Committee, but his defeat
was seen as a victory for those in the party who oppose the rapid
pace of reforms.
   Leading Communist reformist Zoltan Szabo told reporters the
Communist Party's ``oligarchy is becoming active, now that they have
realized that they may be in danger of losing control of the party.''
   The Communist leadership decided in February to permit multiparty
elections by June 1990. The decision was part of the political,
social and economic reforms that have kept Hungary in the forefront
of change within the Soviet bloc, creating concern among leaders of
more hard-line Warsaw Pact countries.
   At the talks, opposition leaders continue to urge that only
registered parties be allowed to nominate candidates, Magyar Hirlap
said. The Communist Party, which still exercises some control over
broad-based organizations such as the Patriotic People's Front,
wants them to propose candidates as well.
   Opposition spokesmen have made the finances and property of
Hungary's Communist Party an issue, claiming the party seized many
things illegally when it took power. Pozsgay's announcement appears
calculated to defuse controversy.
   The paper quoted him as saying the party will hand over $35
million to the increasingly independent-minded government to finance
the emerging multiparty system and that party books will be opened
after the elections.

   Two freight trains collided and derailed
early today, injuring 10 people, authorities said.
   None of the injuries appeared serious but some of those hurt were
being taken to two hospitals, said Albemarle County police Commander
Scott Hambrick.
   Three engines and 23 cars jumped the tracks and spilled coal in
the 6:20 a.m. collision 60 miles west of Richmond, said Commander
Tom Maxwell.
   Lloyd Lewis, a spokesman for CSX Transportation in Jacksonville,
Fla., said it is not known how the trains ended up on the same track.
   The eastbound train was moving down the single-track line and had
been cleared to move onto a siding when a westbound train came
around the curve and hit it, Lewis said. He said crew members of
both trains were injured.
   The eastbound train was moving slowly or standing still at the
time; the other train's speed isn't known, he said.

<HEAD>Many Latino Immigrants Say Citizenship Test Too Hard: Survey</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Inserts graf 6, Rep. Edward Roybal, with quote from news conference.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The overwhelming majority of Latino immigrants
say they intend to stay in the United States, but many say they've
delayed applying for citizenship because the exam is too difficult,
a survey released today said.
   ``These findings suggest that one effective method to increase
U.S. citizenship among Latino immigrants would be education and
outreach activities to demystify the naturalization process,'' the
National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials said.
   In a release announcing results of the telephone survey of 1,635
immigrants in eight states, the association said such activities
should also be designed to ``allay fears about the difficulty of the
citizenship examination.''
   The average European and Asian immigrant waits seven to eight
years before naturalizing, but Hispanic immigrants wait an average
of 14 to 15 years, the association said.
   However, once Latino immigrants take the exam, the survey said,
most pass and don't find it difficult.
   Rep. Edward Roybal, D-Calif., president of the association's
educational fund, told a news conference the survey results are
especially important ``because this is a group that many believe
will not be fully counted in the next census.''
   The Latino group said its survey also showed that Hispanic
immigrants are more politically active than previously believed.
   ``In light of the survey's findings, many of our society's
assumptions about Latino immigrants will need to be re-examined,''
the group said. ``Foremost among these assumptions is the perception
that Latino immigrants are here temporarily and are planning to
return to their homelands upon accumulation of savings or upon
retirement.''
   Ninety-eight percent of those interviewed said they wanted to
make the United States their permanent home, and 79 percent said
life in the United States is better than in their native country.
   Ninety-five percent said that an important reason for wanting to
become a U.S. citizen is that it allows you to vote.
   Sixty-three percent of the Cubans interviewed identified
themselves as Republicans, while 42 percent of Mexicans and 34
percent of other Latin Americans said they were Democrats.
   The study said 81 percent of the naturalized Latinos surveyed
were registered to vote, compared with 70 percent of the general
U.S. voting age population.
   Paradoxically, however, 46 percent said they saw no real benefits
of becoming a U.S. citizen.
   Difficulty of the Immigration and Naturalization Service
examination was cited as an important reason by 39 percent and
discrimination against Latinos by 35 percent.
   Forty-four percent of those interviewed were naturalized citizens
and the remaining 66 percent were permanent legal residents.
   Despite their overwhelming desire to remain in the United States,
17 percent of the non-naturalized Latinos said an important reason
for not becoming a citizen was that they planned to return to their
homeland some day.
   Rosalind Gold, a research associate with the Latino group, said
the respondents ``may have thought about whether it was an important
reason for a person not becoming a citizen, rather than really
answering in the personal sense about what their personal plans
were.''
   The survey was conducted in California, Texas, Florida, New York,
New Jersey, Illinois, Arizona and Maryland. Nearly half of those
interviewed were from Mexico and one-fourth from Cuba. The principal
other countries of origin included the Dominican Republic, Colombia,
El Salvador and Ecuador.
   The survey was conducted by the educational fund of the
association, which claims a membership of more than 3,300 Hispanic
elected officials, appointed officials and community and business
leaders. It did not give a margin of error.

<HEAD>Actress Opens Play As Fan Put Under Psychiatric Observation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BERKELEY, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A fan who pursued Justine Bateman for
months was put under psychiatric observation for holding police at
bay outside a theater and threatening to kill himself if the actress
didn't talk to him, authorities said.
   Bateman, who played shopping-crazy Mallory Keaton in the TV
series ``Family Ties,'' was not inside at the time but went on stage
hours later for the opening of the play ``Lulu,'' in which she has
the title role of a femme fatale.
   Authorities said John Thomas Smetek, 39, of Houston, imagined he
was romantically involved with with the 23-year-old Bateman. He was
taken to Highland Hospital after his arrest Wednesday at the
Berkeley Repertory Theater.
   Smetek was booked for investigation of weapons offenses. Bail was
set at $25,000.
   ``She just hopes that he seeks the help he needs,'' said
Bateman's publicist, Cindy Guagenti.
   Smetek kept police at bay for three hours, holding a loaded gun
to his abdomen and forcing cancellation of a midday rehearsal. ``He
just wants to talk with her and indicate his love-fixation with
her,'' said Lt. Robert Peters.
   Earlier this year, police said, Smetek claimed to be a producer
and tried to speak to Bateman at the ``Family Ties'' sound stage in
Hollywood.
   He first appeared outside the Berkeley theater Friday, and
Bateman ``more or less brushed him off,'' Peters said. When she saw
him the next day, she notified police, who questioned Smetek, but
``he really hadn't committed any crimes.''
   Richard Griffoul, a spokesman for the theater, said the theater
had hired security guards and circulated Smetek's description among
employees.
   ``Justine was aware that he was pursuing her and took the
situation seriously,'' said Guagenti.
   ``It's no joke,'' said Griffoul. ``This type of thing is the
worst scenario for a person in the public eye.''
   The incident was the latest in a series of security threats to
celebrities.
   On July 18, actress Rebecca Schaeffer, who appeared in the TV
series ``My Sister Sam,'' was shot to death at the door to her Los
Angeles apartment. A 19-year-old described as an obsessed fan has
been charged.

   The United States is planning to use what may
be the ultimate weapon against Fidel Castro's Cuba: television.
   By the end of the year, a million or more Soviet-made TV sets are
expected to tune in six hours a day, seven days a week to
American-made news programs and the best reruns Hollywood has to
offer, courtesy of the U.S. Information Agency.
   Could programs such as ``Dynasty,'' ``Days of Our Lives'' and pro
bowling lure big Cuban audiences away from state-run TV?
   Proponents say Cubans will flock to their sets, as they
apparently did with Radio Marti, and take their first uncensored
look at the outside world in 30 years.
   But critics say TV Marti may harden anti-American attitudes in
Cuba, violate international communications laws and cause massive
headaches for Florida broadcasters who may find themselves blacked
out by TV Marti's powerful signal or who may be bludgeoned by
retaliatory broadcasts from Havana.
   President Bush supports sending TV to Cuba, as do many members of
Congress and Cuban exile groups.
   But the plan has faced some powerful opponents, including Sen.
Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, and the National Association of Broadcasters.
   After three years of rancorous debate over the wisdom of such an
enterprise, the House and Senate this year voted money to begin TV
Marti testing this fall.
   But the Senate, before it appropriated $7.5 million in July for a
90-day TV Marti test, agreed to hold up funds for full operation
until the Senate Foreign Relations Committee holds hearings on
whether TV Marti would violate U.S. treaty obligations.
   The House earlier authorized $32 million for TV Marti over the
next two years, and the House and Senate measures are awaiting
resolution in conference committee.
   If the spending plan gains final congressional approval, the USIA
will begin satellite relays of Spanish-language programs from
Washington to a receiving station in Cudjoe Key, Fla. There, weather
permitting, the signals will be fed to a transmitter aboard a giant
balloon tethered two miles above the Atlantic, and thence to Cuba
some 90 miles away.
   Cubans, TV Marti backers say, are eagerly awaiting U.S.
television.
   ``My understanding is they can't wait for it to start,''
Jacqueline Tillman, executive director of the Cuban-American
National Foundation in Washington, said Wednesday.
   ``Radio Marti has, and hopefully TV Marti will as well, provide
views to the Cuban people that they are not receiving.''
   Tillman said Radio Marti has helped nurture human rights groups,
made the Cuban populace aware of the number of Cuban army casualties
in Angola, the level of oppression in Cuba, AIDS and the new era of
openness in the Soviet Union and East Bloc.
   ``All that news is frequently censored by the Cuban government
media, so the promise of TV Marti, with pictures, is very
important,'' she said.
   Cuban officials have labeled TV Marti ``anti-Cuban propaganda''
and said they will take appropriate measures against it. When Radio
Marti was launched in May 1985, Cuba briefly tried to jam the
broadcasts.
   The National Association of Broadcasters has lobbied against TV
Marti, saying it could wreak havoc on U.S. stations, which already
are subject to periodic radio blasts from enormously powerful Cuban
transmitters.
   ``The idea is technically flawed and there are no provisions to
protect U.S. broadcasters from either direct interference from TV
Marti's signal or retaliatory broadcasts from Cuba,'' NAB spokesman
Walt Wurfel said Wednesday.
   ``Cuba has demonstrated in the past it has powerful transmitters
that can cause interference to U.S. radio stations'' from Florida to
North Carolina and as far west as Des Moines, Iowa, Wurfel said.
   Some Cuban-American groups also oppose TV Marti.
   Manuel R. Gomez, president of the Cuban-American Committee Fund,
wrote recently in a New York Times op-ed piece that TV Marti
violates a 1982 treaty that stipulates that normal TV transmission
wavelengths are for domestic, national use only.
   ``The creation of TV Marti would surely be perceived by Cuba as a
hostile act,'' Gomez said. ``The Cuban community in the U.S. will
suffer the brunt of Cuba's displeasure, as we did after Radio Marti,
when Cuba virtually closed off all family visits to the island.''

<TEXT>
   The Christian army commander, Gen. Michel
Aoun, today said the U.S. decision to remove its diplomats from
Lebanon was based on ``half-truths, hearsay and downright black
propaganda.''
   Aoun lashed out at the United States during a news conference in
his underground bunker hours after another artillery battle between
Christian and Moslem forces left at least two people dead and seven
injured.
   The U.S. staff at the Beirut embassy was evacuated on Wednesday
amid souring relations with Aoun and a protest at the facility
during which hundreds of Christians demanded the United States press
Syria to end the fighting.
   On Saturday, the 54-year-old Maronite Catholic charged that the
United States has ``sold Lebanon to Syria'' out of fear for the
lives of eight Americans held hostage by pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem
groups in Lebanon.
   He compared his war against the Syrians to the American war of
independence and called on the American people to support the
Christians.
   The U.S.-trained general was clearly angered by U.S. State
Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler's remark that the 30 U.S.
diplomats were pulled out because he had threatened them with a
``good dose of Christian terrorism.''
   She said an unidentified Christian leader told diplomats they
moved in and out of the compound in the Christian sector of Beirut
``at their own risk.''
   Aoun said during the hour-long news conference that Ms.
Tutwiler's remark was ``a calculated but crude personal attack on me.
   ``It's an attack perhaps born of desperation, rather than
exasperation at the continued Lebanese resistance, and based at best
on half-truth, hearsay and downright black propaganda at which we
all know the State Department excels.''
   Lebanon's Ambassador to Washington, Abdallah Bouhabib, also
disputed the U.S. charge that American diplomats were exposed to
terrorism.
   ``We think that there was no danger whatsoever for the American
diplomats there,'' the envoy said. He appealed to Americans to
``support all the Lebanese, Moslems and Christians, in our war of
liberation'' against Syria's 40,000 troops in Lebanon who the
Christians refer to as an occupation force.
   Police said two people were killed and seven wounded in five
hours of shelling before dawn today. The fighting ended a week of
diminished fighting in the six-month confrontation between Aoun's
forces and the Syrians.
   The deaths raised the casualty toll since the fighting erupted
March 8 to at least 830 killed and 2,462 wounded, nearly all of them
civilians.
   The artillery battles began late Wednesday, 12 hours after the
American diplomats were airlifted by U.S. Navy helicopter to Cyprus,
100 miles away.

   Attackers fired several rockets from Jordan into
Israel today, but the shells exploded harmlessly, the military said.
   At least one rocket landed in Jordan, officials of the Arab
country said. It was the second attack in a week and the fifth this
year across the normally quiet border.
   Israeli soldiers watched the Soviet-made Katyusha rockets sailed
into the sky shortly after midnight, and found the remains of one
107mm rocket in searches this morning, the military command said in
a communique.
   The blasts roused Israelis from sleep at a nearby kibbutz, or
collective farm. The only damage was a crater in the Jordan River
Valley.
   Jordan's official news agency said one rocket landed near the
border village of Adasiyya.
   In keeping with Israeli army policy, military sources declined to
be more specific about where the rockets landed in the Jewish state.
   Israel's border with Jordan has been a quiet frontier for years,
but several recent incidents have broken the calm.
   Israeli officials said a Palestinian guerrilla crossed the border
Saturday and killed two Israeli soldiers before he was shot to
death. Jordan said it could find no evidence of a crossing.
   Another Israeli trooper was killed in a March 18 infiltration
along the southern border claimed by Fatah-Uprising, a Syrian-based
Palestinian group outside the Palestine Liberation Organization.
Jordan said it arrested several people involved in that raid.
   The Israelis killed two Jordanian soldiers in two other border
crossings this year in the north and south of the country. Jordan
said the two had deserted their posts.
   Neither Jordan nor Israel use Katyusha rockets, but some
Palestinian guerrilla factions do. Jordan does not permit guerrilla
attacks across its borders into Israel, and it expelled Palestinian
guerrillas in a 1970-71 civil war, sharply reducing such attempts.

   The informant who helped arrange a Border
Patrol sting aimed at smuggling of illegal aliens was arrested on
suspicion of murder after the bust went awry. One federal agent was
slain and his partner wounded.
   Four people in all were arrested in the shooting in a convenience
store parking lot early Wednesday.
   Agent Keith Connelly, 42, an 18-year Border Patrol veteran, died
of a gunshot wound to the chest. His partner, Ted Jordan, also shot
in the chest, was downgraded from serious to critical condition
today.
   Connelly and Jordan had arranged through the informant, an
illegal alien farmhand, to meet a group of smugglers at the store,
said J. William Carter, chief Border Patrol agent. He said the
agents posed as employers offering to pay about $500 for the alien
and were about to make arrests when they were shot.
   The agents had met the informant Saturday, and he did not tell
them the smugglers would be armed, Carter said. After the shooting,
the informant fled.
   Authorities could not immediately say what his role was in the
shootings.
   ``At this time I have no idea whether or not it was a setup,''
Carter said.
   Arrested on suspicion of murder and other, unspecified, charges
were Lorenzo Macias Arreola, 41, Florentino Nunez Mujica, 31, and
Rosura Rodriguez, 22, all of Los Angeles, and Albert Serrano
Saldana, 18, of Costa Mesa, Calif.
   Authorities have not identified which one was the informant.
Police Capt. Pat Rhames said Rodriguez apparently was not involved
directly in the shootings.
   One of the downed agents fired before backup agents arrived and
began shooting, Carter said. It was not known if any suspects were
shot, but one was bleeding, said Sgt. Jerry Dyer, head of the SWAT
team that sealed off the area.
   Two suspects sped off in a station wagon and two others ran in
opposite directions, Dyer said. The car was abandoned a few blocks
away. Police arrested the first suspect within an hour of the
shooting, and the final suspect was dragged out of a yard around
7:20 a.m., police said.

<HEAD>Senate Panel Extends Airline Smoking Ban</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Senate subcommittee voted today to
permanently forbid smoking on all domestic airline routes, expanding
the current ban covering flights lasting only two hours or less.
   On a unanimous voice vote, the Senate Appropriations
transportation subcommittee adopted an $11.9 billion spending bill
for transportation programs for fiscal 1990 that includes the
strengthened smoking prohibition. The 1990 fiscal year begins Oct. 1.
   There was no debate on the smoking provision.
   The full Appropriations Committee planned to vote on the bill
later in the day. Subcommittee Chairman Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J.,
who sponsored the proposal, said he expected to prevail there but to
face a tough fight from tobacco-state senators when the legislation
reaches the Senate floor next week.
   ``We hear rumblings in the woods that the war drums are being
beaten and we expect a full-dress battle in the future,'' he said.
   On Aug. 3, the House adopted legislation that would permanently
extend the current ban on cigarette smoking on flights of two hours
or less. The existing restriction, enacted two years ago, will
otherwise expire next April.
   House sponsor Richard Durbin, D-Ill., was blocked from offering
an amendment that would have applied the prohibition to all domestic
flights.
   The ban on two-hour flights covers four out of five U.S. airline
routes.
   Health groups and airline employee unions have worked for the
extended ban, arguing that cigarette smoke inhaled by non-smokers
can cause cancer and other diseases. Cigarette manufacturers insist
that evidence of health problems is inconclusive, and say that the
ban harms tobacco farmers and others who rely on cigarette sales for
their livelihoods.
   The tobacco lobby has conceded that a permanent extension of the
ban on two-hour flights is inevitable. They have even signaled that
they prefer the permanent ban to a temporary one, hoping it would
eliminate a renewal of debate on the issue every time the
restriction expires.

   President Bush today praised ``the courage and
determination'' of the government of Colombia for extraditing an
accused major drug trafficker to the United States and warned
against letting critics of his anti-narcotics strategy ``lose the
war.''
   Bush, addressing the annual convention of the American Legion,
appealed to the veterans to rally behind his anti-drug and
anti-crime measures to help ``free our country from the fear of
drugs and crime.''
   The president, recalling a now-famous campaign gaffe he made ast
last year's Legion convention, also jokingly told the veterans to
``remember Pearl Harbor.'' Bush shocked the convention on Sept. 7,
1988, by saying it was Pearl Harbor Day. The day actuall is Dec. 7.
   Bush said the extradition Wednesday of Eduardo Martinez Romero,
indicted in Atlanta on charges of laundering money for the Medellin
drug cartel, ``sends a strong signal of the courage and
determination of President Barco and the Colombian government to
deal with this scourge which drugs are inflicting on all of us.''
   He said his $7.9 billion anti-drug package, unveiled in a speech
to the nation Tuesday night, ``will require the bravery and
sacrifice that Americans have shown before and must again.''
   ``As veterans, you know how battles are often fought, house by
house, block by block. Well, we'll win this battle the same way.
We're going to win win it kid by kid, neighborhood by
neighborhood,'' said the president.
   Democrats have charged the Bush drug plan is underfunded and
inadequate to meet the menace.
   To them, Bush replied, ``Some, incredibly, say it's not enough.
This from the very people who oppose the death penalty. It's that
kind of thinking that's lost too many battles.
   ``So let's not let these critics lose the war,'' said Bush. ``I
ask you to support our crime plan and also the other parts of our
drug strategy.''
   Bush, who entered the convention hall wearing his American Legion
Post 77 cap from his hometown of Houston, also attacked the
House-passed defense authorization bill and commended the Legion's
support of his call for a constitutional amendment to protect the
flag.
   Legion officials presented him with petitions signed by a million
people in support of a constitutional amendment.
   He said the House-passed $295 billion defense budget ``is totally
unacceptable to the commander-in-chief of the United States armed
forces.''
   He charged that the House version, now headed for compromising
with a Senate defense bill, would ``strip money from programs
crucial'' to modernizing strategic weapons, including the mobile
Midgetman missile and putting the MX missile on rail cars.
   Recalling his campaign gaffe, Bush said, ``Today surprisingly is
Sept. 7. Can you believe it? And I'm determined not to repeat the
mistake I made exactly one year ago when I referred to this as Pearl
Harbor Day. ... As long as I live I'll remember the gasp from the
audience.''
   From the convention. the president went to nearby Fort McHenry
for a ceremony marking the 175th anniversary of the Battle of
Baltimore in the War of 1812 against the British, which inspired
Francis Scott Key to write ``The Star-Spangled Banner.''
   Standing before a 90-foot white flagpole, Bush called it ``one of
America's most hallowed shrines.'' He said Baltimore ``stopped a
British invasion and preserved our independence'' in ``one of the
greatest chapters in the American experience.''
   The speeches in the Baltimore area kicked off a series of
out-of-town appearances to drum up support for the anti-drug
strategy. On Friday he heads to New Orleans to deliver the same
message.
   Although the drug plan doesn't call for direct use of U.S.
troops, it proposes sending some drug offenders to military-style
boot camps. In addition, the administration is seriously considering
using National Guard forces for marijuana eradication, said drug
policy director William J. Bennett.
   Bush, in a series of appearances Wednesday in behalf of his
program, struck back at Democrats who attacked his program.
   While apologizing for getting ``down into the trenches of
domestic politics,'' he told an audience that included a group of
Latin American ambassadors: ``I couldn't help but notice that the
minute I finished speaking, there was the predictable response by
some that we haven't done enough.''
   On Capitol Hill, some Democrats pushed the case for raising taxes
to finance an all-out fight against narcotics with Rep. Dan
Rostenkowski, D-Ill., declaring: ``Unless the president supports the
tax increases that will be necessary to fight this war, the drug
dealers are going to win.''
   House Speaker Thomas Foley, D-Wash., said that ``without the
administration's support, the idea of raising taxes is futile.''
   Bush has rejected new taxes.

<HEAD>British Hooligans Hustled Out of Sweden</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with Thatcher quote, ferry refusing passage
to some Britons, raises news report of attack near train station. No pickup.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARTHUR MAX</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Swedish police hustled hundreds of
English soccer hooligans out of the country today after they
ransacked shops and scuffled with rowdy Swedish youths.
   Police said 102 Britons and 106 Swedes were arrested before and
after Wednesday's World Cup qualifying match, which ended in a 0-0
draw.
   Duty officer Lennart Norden said 78 people spent the night in
jail.
   Newspapers ran a picture of two youths, one with a raised club in
his hand, kicking a man outside a Stockholm train station. Dozens of
people looked on.
   A few Britons and Swedes may be charged with assault and
vandalism, but nearly all the foreigners have been freed and given
48 hours to leave Sweden, said Superintendent Kurt Nilsson.
   In London, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher called the fans'
behavior ``a disgrace to Britain,'' and her government asked soccer
officials to cancel a visit by the national team to the Netherlands
in December.
   ``I am always horrified if there is any difficulty with football
fans abroad,'' she said.
   Scandinavian Seaways said today it refused passage to about 20
Britons, fearing violence. It bought back return tickets from one
group and volunteered to pay for 10 people to find another way home.
   ``We didn't want them on board,'' said a spokesman.
   The shipping line said it confiscated passports of another 30
passengers, and threatened to turn over the documents to British
police if there was any problem at sea.
   About 600 policemen at the Rasunda Stadium in suburban Stockholm
kept the British fans isolated in a standing terrace during the
game. Dozens of visitors were escorted directly from the stadium to
trains for the west coast ports of Goteborg and Helsingborg for the
return ferry to Britain.
   Swedes and Britons clashed later in town, but no serious injuries
were reported. The trouble ``was less than we expected,'' said
police Superintendent Sture Hoglund. One newspaper headline read:
``Police Win the Match.''
   Earlier, about 100 England supporters, mostly teen-agers,
rampaged through downtown Stockholm, throwing bottles at police
vehicles, knocking down passers-by and vandalizing shops.
   One large group of youngsters entered the Ahlens department
store, overturning flower pots and goods displays. Some looting also
was reported, Norden said.
   ``No more,'' wrote sports commentator Stefan Thylin in the
Aftonbladet daily. ``This problem seems insoluble. England must be
shut out of the European soccer community.''
   The hooliganism could effect a decision by the European soccer
clubs' governing body, UEFA, to lift a ban against English clubs
playing in Europe. The ban was imposed after England supporters were
blamed for a riot that triggered a stampede in Belgium, killing 39
spectators. The ban does not apply to the national team.
   On Monday a British fan died when he jumped off a ferry into the
North Sea. Under the influence of drugs, he panicked when companions
sprayed him with a fire extinguisher.
   Fears of hooliganism prompted the British Football Association to
ask its Swedish counterpart to cut back ticket sales in Britain.
About 1,000 visitors attended the match at Rasunda, which was filled
to its 38,500-seat capacity.

<HEAD>Bennett Defends Bush Stance on Assault Rifles</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Top 11 grafs new to lead with Biden pledging fast track for
legislation; picks up 11th graf pvs, Bennett told.</HEAD>

   Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Joseph
Biden pledged today to put President Bush's anti-drug legislation
``on a fast track,'' while another senior Democrat clashed with
William Bennett over the administration's refusal to ban U.S.-made
assault rifles.
   Bennett, the point man in the administration's war on drugs, told
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy in a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing there
were constitutional problems with a rifle-ban proposal.
   Bennett's appearance was his first of two during the day as
Congress began its review of the $7.9 billion drug package Bush
outlined in a nationally televised speech Tuesday night. Bush wants
a crackdown on casual users of drugs and more money for treatment
facilities, as well as more prison cells to house criminals and
stepped-up efforts against South American drug lords.
   A number of congressional Democrats have said Bush should
recommend a tax increase to pay for the plan instead of proposing to
take money from other programs. The $7.9 billion sought is $2.2
billion above the 1989 budget authorization.
   Biden, D-Del., told Bennett he hoped consultations could begin as
soon as possible with congressional leaders over the drug
legislation.
   No formal bills have been introduced yet, although they are
expected to be over the next several days.
   Kennedy said the arsenals kept by Colombian drug lords have been
heavily stocked with American-made guns. ``The American people want
action'' to outlaw ``the weapons of choice of these thugs and
mobsters on the streets,'' he said.
   ``Are we going to get action out of the administration?''
Kennedy, D-Mass., asked the drug policy coordinator.
   ``I think there are very serious constitutional problems,''
Bennett responded.
   The Bush administration already has banned the import of a number
of foreign-made assault rifles but has balked at shutting off U.S.
manufacturing amid a heavy lobbying campaign from the National Rifle
Association.
   The president's anti-drug strategy itself brought surprisingly
little fireworks at the hearing, although Democrats have complained
over the last several days that the Bush administration's plans for
financing it were insufficient.
   Bennett told a packed National Press Club audience Wednesday that
Biden revealed ``no substantive disagreements with the strategy'' in
his Democratic response to the Bush plan aired Tuesday night.
   Biden said the Bush plan isn't ``bold enough, but it's a good
start.''
   As for those who say the $7.9 billion is inadequate to fight the
war on drugs, Bennett said, ``I'm just not going to be all that
receptive to criticism of the figure of $8 billion from people whose
correct mark is $6 billion.''
   Bennett said the strategy, if pursued ``consistently over time,''
will enable the country to win the war against drugs, but he
cautioned that it won't happen quickly with any ``Batman through the
transom'' flashy solutions.
   The strategy, which Congress had directed Bennett to develop,
calls for a law enforcement crackdown on all levels of drug
trafficking, from drug kingpins overseas to casual users in America.
It seeks a 53 percent increase in funding for treatment programs, a
25 percent increase in prevention efforts, and a vast expansion of
the federal prison system to house drug offenders.
   The strategy also calls for $261 million next year in military
and law enforcement aid to Colombia, Peru and Bolivia, the three
main cocaine-producing countries. The administration plans to offer
those countries some $2 billion more over the next five years once
they demonstrate solid efforts to cut down on drug trafficking.
   Meanwhile, Bush on Wednesday visited the District of Columbia
General Hospital's pediatrics ward and cradled one of about a dozen
infants who were abandoned after birth by mothers addicted to drugs.
   The babies, after being cured of their own drug dependencies,
still must wait for months until foster care can be found for them.
   Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, temporarily halted a Senate effort to
bolster treatment programs by cutting funds for congressional
mailings. The measure, proposed by Republicans and accepted by
Democrats, would reduce the $80 million proposed for next year's
congressional mail, transferring $45 million of it to a treatment
program for pregnant women addicted to crack cocaine and other drugs.
   A vote was blocked by Stevens, R-Alaska, who argued that such a
cut would deprive Alaskans of an important source of news.
   The American Civil Liberties Union said the drug strategy will
compromise civil liberties and will be ``counterproductive and
cynical,'' shortchanging prevention and treatment programs while
putting ``overwhelming reliance on the criminal justice system.''
   Donald Fiedler, national director of the National Organization
for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, said the program declares ``war on
at least 25 million fellow citizens who are leading productive lives
but for their casual or regular use of marijuana.''
   Also, the Drug Enforcement Administration said drug agents have
detected a sharp increase in cocaine prices in Miami over the past
few weeks, but are not yet ready to say whether the Colombian
government's crackdown on traffickers has disrupted the business.
   The retail price of cocaine in South Florida has gone from an
average of $11,000 to $16,000 per kilogram to about $20,000, based
on sales of 5 to 15 kilograms, DEA spokesman Frank Shults said.

   Jurors deliberated only nine minutes before
convicting a man of plotting to kill his mother with a rattlesnake.
   Reginald Wayne Pope, 37, could be sentenced to life in prison for
his conviction Wednesday on a charge of criminal solicitation.
   Prosecutor Wade Drinkard called Pope ``one sick individual.''
   Prosecutors said Pope met snake handler Keith Davis by chance at
a restaurant. Davis testified Pope asked him about the possibility
of using a timber rattler to kill his adoptive mother, Kathleen
Etheridge.
   Davis contacted police, and he wore a concealed microphone to
record later meetings with Pope, who offered him $300, with the
promise of more later, to release a snake at his mother's house.
   Pope was arrested in October.
   ``I loved him so much and I thought he loved me,'' Mrs. Etheridge
said of her son.

<HEAD>Khomeini's Son Rules Out Relations with United States</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The son of the late Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini today ruled out relations between Iran and the United
States and said Iran's new president, Hashemi Rafsanjani, is
undoubtedly anti-American.
   Ahmad Khomeini, 43, appeared to be trying to rally radicals
against conciliatory moves toward the West expected from Rafsanjani,
who is associated with the so-called pragmatist camp in postwar Iran.
   Hatred of the United States, referred to in Iran as the ``Great
Satan,'' is strong among radicals who favor maintaining
revolutionary Islamic fervor.
   Tehran radio, monitored in Nicosia, quoted Khomeini as saying:
``You know well the higher authorities of the country and our dear
president. If our president is not anti-American, who in Iran is?''
He spoke at a meeting with families of soldiers who died in the
eight-year Persian Gulf war.
   Khomeini added that Rafsanjani ``is not a person to take even one
step outside the path of the imam, and against his guidance,'' the
radio reported.
   Iranians regarded Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini as a supreme
spiritual leader, or imam. Before his death on June 3, he preached a
staunchly anti-American doctrine that ruled out any ties with
Washington.
   His son's description of Rafsanjani's anti-American credentials
would seem to make any friendly gesture toward the United States
more difficult.
   Rafsanjani, elected July 28, is known to want to shed Iran's
radical image abroad, to end Tehran's international isolation, and
to attract foreign investment and technology to rebuild the
country's war-battered economy.
   Rafsanjani recently won parliamentary approval for a 22-man
Cabinet consisting largely of technocrats, many Western-educated,
and his administration is making positive gestures to ease strains
with some foes.
   Earlier this week, Iran's deputy foreign minister, Ali Mohammad
Besharati, said 16 Western hostages, including eight Americans,
being held in Lebanon by pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem groups could be
freed if Washington releases billions of dollars in frozen Iranian
assets. Washington has made the release of the hostages a condition
for improving ties with Iran.
   The younger Khomeini used to act as a spokesman for his father
and was expected to become part of the senior leadership when his
father died.
   But he has no official role and is considered more of a symbol
for the hard-line elements with which he has allied himself.

   Investigators are trying to determine
whether the Ohio State Fair's grand champion steer, Hank, also goes
by the name Carl, a ribbon winner at an Illinois farm show.
   The key piece of evidence is a patch of white hair on Hank's
underside that had been dyed black, an Ohio state fair official said.
   Coloring the animal's hide is itself a violation, but fair
officials are also investigating whether Hank was shown as Carl
three weeks earlier at the Iroquois County Fair in Illinois, where
it won a second-place ribbon.
   If the allegation is true, the prize steer violates the rules of
both fairs because it was shown by different families and because it
fails to meet ownership requirements. An exhibitor must own and care
for the animal as of Jan. 1 to show at either fair.
   The Ohio 4-H, the Future Farmers of America and the state fair
have been gathering evidence for more than two weeks.
   When officials examined the Ohio fair's grand champion steer
after the competition Aug. 14, a dark dye was wiped from the steer's
abdomen. The dark-colored hairs have grown out.
   ``It is white,'' Jim Goard, director of livestock and agriculture
for the state fair, said Wednesday. ``It needs to match the spots on
pictures of the animal from Illinois, but it appears to be white,
and coloring an animal is a major violation in itself.''
   A white spot was visible in photos of Carl, shown by Jeremy
Simmons, 12, at the Iroquois County Fair on July 24.
   Hank was shown by Susan Shealy, 17, of Tiro, who could be forced
to forfeit her first-place ribbon and the $28,000 price the
Angus-cross steer brought at the fair. Her family could be banned
from showing at the fair for three or more years.
   Jeremy, of Donovan, Ill., also could face a penalty.
   Both families deny any wrongdoing.
   Hank has been in the custody of Ohio State University while his
hair grows out. Investigators visited OSU's beef barn Tuesday to
photograph the steer in postures similar to the stances shown in
photos of the Illinois winner.
   Jeremy's father, Donald Kopsell, has said Carl was destroyed
after eating tainted corn.
   State fair rules require investigators to make a recommendation
to the fair's Beef, Sheep and Swine Committee. The committee must
recommend action to the nine-member Ohio Expositions Commission,
which runs the fair.
   ``If they call for a hearing, all parties will be notified and
given a chance to tell their side of the story,'' Jack Foust,
general manager of the fair.

   The Morton H. Meyerson Symphony Center is I.M.
Pei's first concert hall _ a once-in-a-century opportunity, and the
world famous architect knows he may never have a chance to do it
again.
   ``There aren't that many concert halls built in this world,'' the
72-year-old designer said.
   But would he do another?
   ``I tell you, you know, never say never, `No, I don't know,' but
I don't think I would be seeking it as much as I once would, because
I have done it.''
   Pei, whose buildings include the John F. Kennedy Library in
Boston, the East Wing of the National Gallery of Art and the new
Louvre in Paris, speaks lovingly of the new Dallas symphony hall and
the opportunity it presented to him.
   ``I would have to say that this is one of the great buildings
that I have had the fortune'' to design, he said. He received a $10
million commission for the Meyerson Center in 1982.
   Pei likes the feel of the 2,065-seat music chamber. It is more
vertical than horizontal, and he says it lends intimacy to the room.
   The public areas outside the music chamber presented the greatest
design challenge for Pei. The lobby area curves around the music
chamber in a series of pieces of circles, overlooked by glass that
curves and sweeps the area. ``I haven't done a work that has had
such a complex geometry,'' he said.
   Ieoh Ming Pei was born in China. His creations fuse environment
with structure.
   He attributes his rise in architectural circles to his first big
break in 1969 _ the commission for the Kennedy Library. Pei was not
well-known at the time, and the decision to bypass other masters for
him was so surprising that Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis felt it
necessary to explain the decision.
   From there, he received commissions for the Christian Science
Church Center and the John Hancock Tower in Boston, and the East
Building of the National Gallery of Art in Washington.
   With the addition of the symphony hall, there are six Pei
buildings in the Dallas area _ the ARCO Tower, One Dallas Centre,
City Hall, the Allied Bank Tower and the Field Research Center for
Mobil Oil Co. Only Boston and nearby Cambridge have more Pei
structures: 10.

   More than 50 people were believed to be in the truck when it

<TEXT>
   A prosecutor concerned about motorcycle
riders doing wheelies through city streets has ordered police to
confiscate motorcycles of riders arrested for dangerous driving,
newspapers reported Thursday.
   The motorcycles will be regarded as ``instruments used in the
committing of a crime,'' prosecutor Christos Dakouris was quoted as
saying. A court will decide whether to return the vehicles or keep
them.
   In a bid to cut down on noise pollution in 1985, traffic police
began to confiscate noisy motorcycles. Irate riders alleged some
officers confiscated parked bikes on suspicion that if they were on
the road, they would have been noisy.
   The latest moves have already drawn fire from the nation's
estimated 196,674 motorcyclists.
   ``These decisions are absurd,'' Yannis Efraimidis, president of
the Greek Motorcycle Club, told the Athens daily Proti. Six-time
Greek motorcycle champion Dimitris Papandreou questioned the
legality of the decision.
   A spokesman for the traffic department said officers had not
received the prosecutor's order to confiscate motorcycles, but Proti
reported that the first victim of the order was arrested Wednesday
for racing in the city and that his motorcycle would be held at
least until his trial in January.

<HEAD>Peru's Garcia Wants European Help for Bush Anti-Drug Plan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Alan Garcia of Peru on Thursday urged
Western Europe to join the fight against drugs to bolster President
Bush's new initiative.
   Garcia, whose country is a major producer of cocaine, called
Bush's plan ``serious'' but said it is incomplete without support
from members of the European Economic Community.
   One element of Bush's plan would offer $261 million in aid to
military and police forces in Colombia, Bolivia and Peru where
cocaine is produced.
   ``The (drug) problem involves the entire international community
and not only the producing nations and the United States,'' Garcia
told a news conference. ``I believe that the dialogue that has begun
is incomplete without an active participation by the European

   Garcia stopped briefly in Rome for meetings with Pope John Paul
II and Italian political leaders en route home from the summit of
non-aligned nations in Yugoslavia.
   Garcia met with the pope for 30 minutes at his summer residence
in the Alban Hills south of Rome. The Vatican listed the meeting as
private and released no details.
   Earlier, Garcia called on Italian President Francesco Cossiga and
met with Socialist leader Bettino Craxi.
   Craxi said after the meeting that the fight against drugs can be
effective only if it includes a crackdown on places of production.
``It's an international problem, not only American,'' he said.

<HEAD>Judge Indicts 44 People in Italy-US Drug Ring</HEAD>
<DATELINE>REGGIO CALABRIA, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge indicted 44 people Thursday
on charges of involvement in a Mafia drug ring, including a Roman
Catholic priest who lived in New York, the Italian news agency ANSA
reported.
   The indictments came as part of an investigation that resulted in
more than 200 arrests in the United States and Italy in the spring
of 1988 in connection with the ring, which smuggled heroin to the
United States in exchange for cocaine.
   Investigating Magistrate Enzo Macri of the Reggio Calabria
criminal court, who issued the indictments, said Reggio Calabria, in
southern Italy, ``represented between 1986 and 1988 the terminal,
for departure and arrival, for a colossal exchange of heroin and
cocaine between Italy and the United States.''
   A Mafia-style organization known as the 'ndrangheta operates in
the Reggio Calabria area, and its members were believed to have run
the drug operation.
   FBI officials announced the breakup of the ring in April 1988.
   The priest was identified as the Rev. Lorenzo Zorza. Authorities
said Zorza and another man headed a company that sold artwork and
archaeological pieces. The profits were allegedly used to buy drugs,
ANSA said.
   Zorza, 48, a U.S. citizen, was arrested in Bologna in April 1988
and is also wanted by federal authorities in New York on drug
charges.
   The breakdown of charges in the indictment was not given by ANSA.
There was no answer Thursday afternoon at the judicial offices in
Reggio Calabria, and Macri's home number was not listed.
   Macri decided not to indict 14 other people, citing lack of
evidence, ANSA said.
   Also Thursday, police in Milan said they seized 57 pounds of
cocaine in the luggage of a Venezuelan merchant marine officer at
Milan's international airport.
   Police said the cocaine, worth $20 million, was found during
routine checks of passengers at Malpensa airport Wednesday.

<HEAD>British Report To Contradict Howe Finding On Waldheim's Unit</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A British investigation of Kurt Waldheim's
World War II actions contradicts Deputy Prime Minister Geoffrey
Howe's finding that the Austrian president's military unit did not
torture British commandos, a Jewish organization said Thursday.
   Howe told Parliament in 1986, when he was foreign secretary, that
four British commandos captured in Nazi-occupied Greece were held by
the German Gestapo secret police rather than by Waldheim's
Wehrmacht, or armed forces, unit.
   The new British Defense Ministry report ordered by Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher includes German war records which show the
commandos were transferred to Waldheim's unit in the Greek town of
Salonika, said the World Jewish Congress.
   The Defense Ministry said only that it will release its report on
the investigation in a few weeks.
   The WJC, which was instrumental in the 1986 campaign to expose
Waldheim's past as a Nazi officer, said it had been informed about
the contents of the British report and supplied some of the
documents on which the report is based.
   Records show Waldheim's duties as an intelligence officer
included prisoner interrogation, the WJC said.
   In written testimony to the U.S. Justice Department, Waldheim
contended there were no interrogations at his unit's headquarters.
Nevertheless, in 1987 the Justice Department placed Waldheim on a
list of people barred from the United States after finding he
participated in the execution of hostages and mistreatment of Allied
prisoners.
   Howe wrote British Member of Parliament Greville Janner in 1986
that his own investigation had determined the four commandos were
held in a Gestapo jail. But the Defense Ministry study says there
was no Gestapo jail in Salonika and the men were not interrogated by
the Gestapo, the WJC said.
   According to the report, the British prisoners ``suffered ill
treatment'' at the hands of Wermacht personnel working at the
detention center, the WJC said.

   The normal random rotation of judges was bypassed
and a black judge assigned to the case of a black man slain Aug. 23
by a gang of whites in Brooklyn's Bensonhurst section, a court
spokeswoman said today.
   Justice Thaddeus Owens, 70, will take over the murder case on
Sept. 18, spokeswoman Mary de Bourbon said.
   Owens, an Arkansas native who has said an uncle was the victim of
a lynch mob, is one of three blacks among the 42 state Supreme Court
justices in Brooklyn.
   The New York Post, which first reported the story today, said
court officials bypassed normal procedures _ in which judges are
randomly picked from a list _ to get an experienced and able judge
for what will be a difficult trial.
   Seven whites have been arrested in the attack on 16-year-old
Yusuf Hawkins. Police said he was ambushed and shot by a gang of
about 30 whites, many of them carrying baseball bats and clubs.
   The Post quoted Sol Wachtler, chief judge of the Court of
Appeals, as saying, ``Neither race nor gender was a factor in this
decision. Excellence was the sole criterion used in this case.''
Wachtler oversees administration of the court.
   ``As far as I'm concerned, I appointed a capable and experienced
judge and not a black judge to handle this case,'' Matthew Crosson,
a deputy chief court administrator, told the newspaper. ``The judge
who I designated happens to be black and the fact that he is black
will not affect the case.''
   On Wednesdsay, 18-year-old Joseph Fama, the alleged gunman, was
indicted on murder charges, as were two other young men earlier. The
grand jury found Fama ``shot four times at close range and struck
Yusuf Hawkins twice in the chest,'' said Assistant District Attorney
Bruce McIntyre.
   Police said Hawkins and three friends were attacked after
entering the mostly white neighborhood to buy a used car.
   Chief of Detectives Robert Colangelo said more arrests are likely.

   The king of body-building won't be
there to help crown America's beauty queen.
   Actor and muscleman Arnold Schwarzenegger backed out of judging
the Miss America Pageant because his wife, TV reporter Maria
Shriver, plans to report on the contest for NBC, pageant director
Leonard Horn said today.
   ``She assured me that her post was unbudgeable and she felt there
was a conflict of interest,'' Horn said.
   Horn said he learned of the problem only last week, though Ms.
Shriver knew several months ago she was doing a piece on the Sept.
16 pageant for NBC's new show ``Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow.'' The
pageant will be on NBC.
   ``Our dispute is that they waited so long to tell us,'' he said.
``We saw no conflict, but she does.''
   Schwarzenegger agreed to be a judge several months ago if he
finished work on a film being shot in Mexico, Horn said.
   Horn said he was looking for a replacement, though one was not
necessary, but most people approached have said they have prior
commitments.
   Ms. Shriver's spokesman at NBC, Paul Reader, said she was
traveling and unavailable for comment.
   The judges who will choose Miss America from 10 finalists include
developer Donald Trump, entertainer Merv Griffin, former baseball
player Mike Schmidt, psychologist Joyce Brothers, actresses Phylicia
Rashad and Debbie Allen, and entertainment writer Claudia Cohen.

<TEXT>
   The government offered a $250,000 reward
for the capture of two cocaine barons, and said today it would
appoint a military mayor in a town infested with death squads
employed by drug traffickers.
   Meanwhile, a reputed money launderer for the Medellin cocaine
cartel arrived in the United States, the first person extradited
from Colombia during the recent crackdown on drug traffickers.
   Two men on a motorcycle tossed a bomb made of dynamite at the
Banco Central Hipotecario in Medellin, the cocaine center of the
nation, said a Medellin police official who identified himself only
as Cardona, his last name.
   The blast Wednesday night caused $45,000 in damage and came just
a few hours after authorities defied drug traffickers' threats and
carried out the extradition.
   The government said Wednesday night that President Virgilio Barco
would use his state of siege powers to name military mayors of
violence-plagued cities.
   Today, Alvaro Garcia, spokesman for the governor's office of
Boyaca state, said Mayor Marino Estrada of Puerto Boyaca, 95 miles
north of Bogota, would be summarily replaced by a military officer,
Army Maj. Alvaro Matallana.
   Estrada was elected in March.
   Puerto Boyaca has been a stronghold of right-wing death squads
that the government says are controlled by Colombia's notorious
cocaine cartels, and it is in a region that is believed to be rife
with cocaine-processing laboratories. In 1988, a judge order the
arrest of Luis Rubio, a former mayor of the town, on allegations of
links to drug traffickers. Rubio fled.
   The opposition Conservative Party issued a communique declaring
hat Barco's decision to impose military rule on some towns was
unconstitutional.
   Barco's Liberal Party has supported him in previous instances
when he has named military governors in areas where leftist
guerrilla violence has been prevalent.
   The decree is the latest in the extraordinary measures Barco has
taken to quell violence by drug traffickers.
   Eduardo Martinez Romero, who was flown out on Wednesday, is the
first drug figure extradited to the United States under the special
emergency powers decreed last month by Barco.
   He arrived in Atlanta today under heavy guard and was being held
at a federal courthouse pending a hearing.
   Martinez, 35, is charged in Atlanta in connection with the
laundering of $1.2 billion worth of illicit cocaine cash.
   High-ranking U.S. diplomats and drug enforcement officials in
Bogota have said that once extraditions start, they expect
drug-related terrorism and violence in Colombia to worsen.
   Colombia's drug lords have said they would rather die in Colombia
than suffer ``life in death' in a U.S. prison. The traffickers
threatened last month to kill 10 judges for every extradited drug
suspect.
   For years, the traffickers had largely succeeded in evading
justice through bribery and intimidation. They have had politicians,
police, judges and journalists killed and reportedly purchased
influence in high places.
   In 1987, the Colombian Supreme Court threw out an extradition
agreement with the United States. The last Colombian drug trafficker
to be extradited, the Medellin cartel's Carlos Lehder, was sent to
the United States early that year. He is serving a life sentence in
a U.S. prison.
   The extradition agreement was revived by Barco last month when he
invoked emergency powers after the assassination of Sen. Luis Carlos
Galan, the leading presidential candidate and an outspoken foe of
the drug lords.
   Barco pledged a relentless campaign against drug traffickers and
police say the government has since virtually paralyzed cocaine
production, raiding labs and sending drug bosses into hiding.
   The drug lords have declared ``total and absolute war'' on Barco
and practically the whole Colombian establishment and, in
retaliation, drug gangs have bombed factories, newspapers,
restaurants and government installations.
   The Defense Ministry said Wednesday that in 2,042 raids conducted
against suspected drug traffickers under emergency legislation,
anti-narcotics squads confiscated 1,190 weapons, more than 20,000
rounds of ammunition, 499 cars and other vehicles, 48 boats and 358
airplanes and helicopters.
   On Wednesday, the government announced a $250,000 reward for
information leading to the arrest of either of the two men it calls
olombia's top cocaine barons, Pablo Escobar and Gonzalo Rodriguez
Gacha.
   The Justice Ministry, showing ``wanted'' posters on television,
announced a cash reward for information leading to the arrest of
either Escobar or Rodriguez Gacha. Both are wanted by the United
States and both are in hiding.
   All tips will be ``absolutely confidential'' and all calls will
be toll-free, the government announcement said.
   Fortune magazine has estimated Escobar's net worth at $3 billion.
   The National Security Council the day before issued a ban on
public demonstrations in Bogota, the capital and largest city with 6
million people.
   Colombian impresarios reported a rash of cancellations, due to
the unstable situation here, by foreign artists and entertainers who
had scheduled Colombian appearances.
   In a statement on Wednesday, Barco called President Bush's
support for Colombia's war on drugs ``a very favorable start'' but
said the key to the battle is to stop drug use in the United States.
   Barco called the United States ``one of the countries that has
the greatest number of drug addicts.''
   He was responding directly to the $7.9 billion drug initiative
Bush announced Tuesday night, which pledged financial and even
military support to this violence-plagued republic that produces 80
percent of the cocaine consumed in the United States.

<HEAD>Senators Want Aid, Experts Sent to Poland</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States and the world's industrial
democracies should send economic, business and labor experts to
Poland to help that nation's new non-communist government establish
a free economy, Sen. Pete Domenici said Thursday.
   The New Mexico Republican explained his proposal as other
lawmakers urged the Bush administration to expand the modest package
of aid it has earmarked for Poland as a critical signal of political
support.
   Domenici said the team of experts he envisions would make a
complete but speedy survey of Poland's largely state-controlled
economy and recommend basic changes needed to spur investment and
free enterprise.
   Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas said many of the
Polish leaders he spoke with when he visited Warsaw last month asked
for just such help.
   ``Poland's leaders, including its communist leaders, are wide
open to new American investment,'' said Dole.
   Dole said the Bush administration is considering ways to expand
the $100 million aid package the president announced in Warsaw
earlier this summer.
   ``I am convinced we can take some additional steps at no cost and
perhaps also find some additional resources within existing budgets
and programs,'' Dole said.
   He said although Poland needs long-term help, especially to ease
the strain caused by payments on its $39 billion foreign debt,
short-term aid is essential.
   ``There cannot be a long-term approach unless Poland's government
makes it through the short term,'' Dole said. ``That's where an
immediate American signal of support can be critical.''
   ``We in the United States, and our allies in Western Europe and
Japan, have a big security, political and economic stake in what
happens in Poland,'' Dole said.
   ``If Solidarity remains in power and succeeds in governing, the
threat of war in Central Europe will go down, democratization in
Hungary, elsewhere in Eastern Europe and even in the Soviet Union
itself will get a big boost, and the prospects for expanded private
investment in and trade with Poland will grow,'' he said.
   Meanwhile, Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., urged support for his
three-step plan to send U.S. assistance to Poland.
   Simon introduced legislation Wednesday which would postpone
interest payments on Poland's $2.8 billion debt to U.S. banks for
three years and defer half of the interest payments due in the
following two years.
   The proposal also calls for establishment of an investment fund
to distribute $300 million for development projects in Poland for
each of three years. It would also call for spending $25 million to
help Poland modernize its telephone system.

   Acting President F.W. de Klerk
today said the results of national elections show that most white
voters support his plan to grant some political rights to blacks,
despite his party's worst showing in 41 years.
   Black activists said at least 25 people were killed in clashes
with police during protests of the elections Wednesday, from which
blacks were excluded.
   The governing National Party narrowly retained its parliamentary
majority in the balloting, losing nearly a quarter of its seats in
the dominant white chamber t anti-apartheid and hard-line
segregationist parties.
   With votes counted in all of 166 election districts, it appeared
the Nationalists would retain at least 93 of their previous 123
seats in Parliament.
   The Conservatives, who want stricter enforcement of segregation
laws and oppose any political rights for blacks, improved from 22 to
39 seats.
   The Democratic Party, which seeks an end to apartheid laws but
wants some guarantees that whites and other minorities would retain
a voice in the government, went from 20 seats to 33 seats. The jump
was the biggest ever for an anti-apartheid faction.
   In one rural district, officials announced another election would
be held to settle a tie between Conservative and National Party
candidates.
   Protesting their disenfranchisement, blacks on Wednesday observed
a nationwide general strike that anti-apartheid leaders called the
biggest anti-government protest ever with 3 million people taking
part.
   Violence flared in many black and mixed-race areas around Cape
Town and white riot police were seen marching through townships
firing in all directions.
   Cape Town attorney Essa Moosa said 25 black and mixed-race people
had been killed in violence in seven townships.
   Police said 12 deaths occurred in the Cape Town area: seven
during violence associated with a feud between factions in the black
township of Khayelitsha, and five during mob violence of unknown
origin in three mixed-race townships.
   Police said four police officers were slightly injured and that
more than 50 people were arrested.
   ``Mr. de Klerk's president's seat sits now in a pool of blood,''
said Rev. Allan Boesak, a mixed-race anti-apartheid activist in Cape
Town. ``People who begin a new term of office with a massacre of ...
people have no right to be in government.''
   Jay Naidoo, general secretary of the 980,000-member Congress of
South African Trade Unions and a leader of the defiance campaign,
called the police response to the protests ``brutal'' and said of
the government: ``They have to deal with us as human beings and
respect our dignity and sense of justice or there will not be any
peace in our country.''
   Alfred Mzo, secretary-general of the outlawed African National
Congress guerrilla group, praised the huge opposition to the
elections and said the group's call for a boycott resulted in low
turnout among mix-race and Indian voters.
   ``Of historic significance for the future of South Africa is the
massive challenge of the oppressed working people who in their
millions stayed away from work as a massive protest against the
undemocratic nature of the elections,'' he said during news
conference today in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, where he was attending a
summit of non-aligned nations.
   Hospitals and monitoring groups said more than 100 people were
hurt as riot squads used whips, tear gas and shotguns to stop
peaceful anti-election rallies and disperse stone-throwing crowds in
more than 20 townships.
   Archbishop Desmond Tutu said he had warned Western nations that
there would be ``chaos in South Africa'' and urged them to act
against the government. He said de Klerk should condemn the police
actions and ``express sorrow and condolences to people who have
suffered this bereavement.''
   De Klerk, who is expected to be chosen by an electoral college
next week to serve a five-year term as president, described the
election results as ``a clear mandate'' for his party's plans for
gradual political reform and said the government now should open
negotiations with blacks.
   ``Seventy percent of the whites voted for parties favoring
renewal and reform ... and granting political rights,'' he said
today, linking his party with the liberal-minded Democrats.
   During the campaign, de Klerk had associated the Nationalists
with the right-wing Conservatives, saying that in the 1987 white
election 80 percent of voters had shown a preference for those
parties' promises to enforce segregation.
   De Klerk's campaign platform called for limited black
participation in national politics within five years. However, he
rejects a one-person, one-vote system leading to black majority rule
and supports maintaining segregated schools and and neighborhoods.
   ``The implementation of a comprehensive economic action plan
together with political development will get our country on the road
of prosperity again,'' de Klerk told a news conference.
   However, he would not answer a question about how the government
would begin negotiations after the tough police action against
blacks during five weeks of protests leading up to the election.
   ``The government handled the defiance campaign with aplomb and in
a very reasonable way,'' de Klerk said.
   Of South Africa's 37 million people, 5 million are white, 28
million black, about 3 million of mixed race and nearly 1 million of
Indian descent. Under apartheid, blacks have no vote in national
affairs and maintain separate districts, schools and health services.
   About 69 percent of the 3,160,667 registered white voters cast
ballots in the election and, for the first time since 1953, the
Nationalists received less than a majority of the white vote. They
won 48.6 percent, to 31.3 percent for the Conservatives and 20
percent for the Democrats.
   Also at stake were seats in Parliament's the mixed-race and
Indian chambers, which were established in 1984 and have little
power. Anti-apartheid activists also called for a boycott of the
non-white elections.
   Incumbents won most races, but National Party candidates
generally fared worse than in the white election of 1987.
   Two prominent Cabinet members, Foreign Minister Pik Botha and
Defense Minister Magnus Malan, were re-elected by margins sharply
lower than 1987.
   The Conservatives lost by only five votes in Vereeniging, de
Klerk's former district. They failed to win some seats they had
targeted and fell far short of the 50 to 60 seats they had expected.
   But they won their first seats in Pretoria, the capital, nd their
first seats in Cape Province and the Orange Free State. Previously,
they held seats only in Transvaal, the most populous of the four
provinces.

   A huge but weaker Hurricane Gabrielle should skirt
Bermuda sometime after midnight with high winds and big ocean
swells, but the East Coast will get little more than heavy surf,
forecasters said today.
   Forecasters said it appeared the storm center would pass 200 to
300 miles east of Bermuda, far enough away for the island to escape
destructive tropical storm-force winds. Swells of more than 20 feet
were reported in Bermuda this morning.
   ``They'll get some showers, some winds and definitely some surf
problems,'' Bob Sheets, director of the National Hurricane Center,
said Wednesday night.
   Gabrielle's top sustained winds dropped from a high of 135 mph to
105 mph as it swirled north on a path far from the United States,
but the storm was so large that swells of five to 13 feet were
recorded more than 1,500 miles away, from Florida to New England.
   ``We have a very large wind field around this hurricane,'' Sheets
said.
   Winds 39 mph or higher _ a speed that forecasters define as
tropical storm-force _ stretched 250 miles to the west and 300 miles
to the east as Gabrielle curved north in the mid-Atlantic.
   At noon EDT, Gabrielle's center was located near 29.9 degrees
north latitude and 60.0 degrees west longitude, or about 320 miles
east-southeast of Bermuda. It was heading north at 15 mph.
   Gabrielle is the largest and most powerful hurricane of the
season, rating just below last year's Hurricane Gilbert, which
ravaged the Caribbean with 155 mph winds.
   Far to the north of Gabrielle, Felix maintained its status as a
minimal hurricane, with winds of 75 mph. The storm was drifting
slowly out in the Atlantic and was no threat to land, forecasters
said.
   At noon EDT, Felix's center was near 39.5 degree north latitude
and 48.0 degrees west longitude, or about 900 miles west of the
Azores. It was drifting north at 7 mph.
   Felix is the sixth and Gabrielle the seventh named storm of the
1989 Atlantic hurricane season. Storms are named when their winds
reach 39 mph and are classified as hurricanes when they grow to 74
mph.

   Teachers strikes disrupted classes for more than 160,000 pupils
in nine states Thursday, including a Rhode Island dispute the school
board labeled the state's first illegal strike in three years.
   The union representing the 190 teachers in Bristol, R.I., called
the job action that began Wednesday informational picketing, but
``when school is started and there are no teachers in the
classrooms, I call that a strike,'' School Committee member Joyce
Pitman.
   Thursday was the second day that classes were canceled for the
2,250 students in the district. It was the first walkout in Rhode
Island, where teachers strikes are illegal, since an eight-day
strike in East Greenwich in 1986.
   The two sides bargained over pay and other issues until early
this morning and planned to go back to the table later in the day.
Officials said that the School Committee may take legal action if
the stoppage continued.
   Elsewhere, strikes were reported in Michigan, Illinois,
Pennsylvania, Ohio, Montana, Massachusetts, California and
Washington state.
   In Northampton County, Pa., about 15 high school students
picketed Wednesday to protest the cancellation of the first day of
classes at the Wilson Area School District. The strike there affects
110 teachers and 1,850 students.
   The largest single district to be struck was Sacramento, Calif.,
with 47,000 students affected in a walkout that began Tuesday. The
teachers union said more than three-quarters of the 2,300 people
covered by the union, which includes non-teaching professionals such
as psychologists and nurses as well as teachers, were taking part in
the strike.
   Michigan had nine districts with 1,680 teachers and more than
32,000 students affected by walkouts on Thursday, according to
figures supplied by the the Michigan Education Association. One of
those districts, Gibraltar, had already settled by the start of the
school day, but classes were not going to resume until Friday.
   The state with the second-largest number of school strikes was
Pennsylvania, with five. Ohio and Illinois had two strikes each,
while one strike each was reported in Montana, Washington,
California, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts.

   Two freight trains collided head-on
early Thursday near the James River, injuring nine people and
spilling 100 gallons of diesel fuel, authorities said.
   Three engines and 23 cars of the two CSX trains were derailed.
But three tanker cars carrying hazardous material were untouched,
police said.
   Albemarle County police commander Scott Hambrick said four cars,
one carrying coal, dumped their loads onto Virginia 626, and one was
leaking a white powder identified as borax, which is not hazardous.
One engine leaked about 100 gallons of diesel fuel which was dammed
by firefighters, Hambrick said.
   ``We have no idea why the trains ended up on the same track,'' he
said.
   Lloyd Lewis, a spokesman for CSX Transportation in Jacksonville,
Fla., said one train was heading west from Richmond and the other
was heading east from Clifton Forge.
   Lewis said all of the injured were from the train crews, and all
were hospitalized in good condition.

   Police marched through townships
firing shotguns and tear gas to break up rallies by people
protesting the segregated national elections, and at least 25 people
were killed, activists said today.
   Media reports and a church monitoring group said at least 100
people were injured in more than 20 townships, and one police
officer said other officers caused the unrest by indiscriminately
beating and whipping blacks.
   Essa Moosa and Associates, a Cape Town law firm, said 25 people
died Wednesday night and early today in seven black and mixed-race
townships outside the city.
   More violence broke out this afternoon, with white riot squads
firing shot guns and tear gas at crowds of dancing and chanting
young people in the Lavender Hill township near Cape Town, a
journalist on the scene said. There was no word on casualties.
   ``They (police) got out of the van and ran down to the road where
the students were coming and started firing. There was a lot of tear
gas,'' said the journalist, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu said earlier today that 23
people had been killed during election day violence, adding: ``We
expect the numbers of the dead to grow.''
   Police Maj. Reg Crewe in Pretoria said at least seven people
``but certainly not as many as 23'' died in violence in the Cape
Town area Wednesday night. He said the circumstances were being
investigated.
   A later police statement said 12 deaths occurred in the Cape Town
area: seven during violence associated with a feud between factions
in the black township of Khayelitsha, and five during mob violence
of unknown origin in three mixed-race townships. Police said more
than 50 people were arrested.
   The independent South African Press Association described the
area outside Cape Town as ``a war zone ... as residents danced
around dozens of burning barricades blocking streets in the area and
police fired repeatedly at groups of youths.''
   One local newspaper, Grassroots, said it had confirmed 15 bodies
were in a local mortuary.
   Acting President F.W. de Klerk's governing National Party
narrowly retained its majority in Wednesday's parliamentary
elections, which excluded the black majority.
   An anti-apartheid activist, the Rev. Allan Boesak, said de
Klerk's presidency ``now sits in a pool of blood.''
   ``People who begin a new term of office with a massacre ... have
no right to be in government,'' he said.
   The National Party has ruled South Africa for 41 years.
   The Western Province Council of Churches said at least 100 people
were injured, including children.
   Groote Schuur Hospital in Cape Town said 40 people were admitted
Wednesday night with birdshot injuries. Gatesville Medical Center
said it treated at least 20 people hit by birdshot, including a
4-year-old. Tyberberg Hospital reported 20 admissions for ammunition
wounds.
   Police reported 200 instances of unrest nationwide from Wednesday
through today, including rock throwing, arson and illegal
gatherings, police said.
   Police said they used shotguns, rubber bullets, whips and tear
gas to disperse placard-carrying marchers as well as people throwing
stones. In at least two instances, police said they whipped and
arrested demonstrators who sat down when they were told to disperse.
   Police said seven officers around the country, including four
near Cape Town, suffered minor injuries when they were hit by rocks
and bottles.
   On Wednesday, journalists saw five white policemen flanked by a
yellow armored vehicle walking through the mixed-race township of
Manenberg outside Cape Town. They said the officers slowly raised
their shotguns and tear gas rifles and fired straight ahead and down
side streets as they marched along.
   A crowd of mixed-race youths, men and women had set fire to
burning barricades of tree branches, newspaper and mattresses at
each end of the street.
   They were dancing and talking in the street, but scattered behind
fences and into houses when the armored vehicle rolled over the
first barricade. One or two youths threw rocks toward the police,
but hit nothing.
   A mixed-race police lieutenant in the Mitchell's Plain area of
Cape Town said Wednesday night that police riot squads were ``the
cause of the riots'' in that area on Tuesday.
   Lt. Gregory Rockman, 30, said a white riot-squad major threatened
to detain him under emergency regulations when he tried to stop
officers from hitting bystanders as well as students holding a
placard demonstration.
   ``They just stormed and hit them whenever they felt like doing
that _ they hit them like mad,'' Rockman said.
   He said four officers joined to beat a woman waiting for a bus
with whips.
   ``She was jumping up and down. Then she ran and they chased after
her,'' Rockman. ``One of them even fell and then got up again and
chased her, hitting her. Their was an elderly man (who) collapsed
because of the beating.''
   As the local crime prevention officer, Rockman said he had tried
to defuse trouble by telling the students they could ``do their
thing'' and then disperse in 20 minutes.
   He said he took one riot squad out of view of the students, but
that another squad repeatedly charged into ``the normal curious
crowds,'' including shoppers.
   ``They were just hitting people. They couldn't care if they were
innocent bystanders or not,'' Rockman said. ``They were running
after them even when they were fleeing, hitting them.
   ``It seemed to me that they were enjoying themselves, feasting on
the people. `You could just see the killer instinct in their eyes.''
   Cape Town police Maj. Gen. Phillipus Fourie confirmed that
Rockman had been summoned to his office Wednesday to discuss police
matters but he would not comment further.
   Tutu said that Rockman could face retaliation, but that he was
``going to be given very wide recognition in the black community''
for his willingness to describe police action.

   NATO on Thursday began its annual fall
maneuvers, which this year involve 205,000 troops in 16 land, air
and sea exercises throughout Western Europe.
   NATO's Allied Command Europe said its Autumn Forge maneuvers
began with the arrival of a U.S. Air Force C-130 Hercules transport
plane from West Germany's Rhein-Main Air Base to participate in
``Armada Exchange,'' the first of the fall maneuvers.
   U.S. Gen. John Galvin, NATO's top military commander in Europe,
said in a statement that military maneuvers remain necessary despite
the warming in East-West relations in recent years.
   ``There is probably no need to remind anybody that while we can
be hopeful about the success of arms control negotiations, there is
still a requirement for national and collective security,'' Galvin
said in the statement issued by Allied Command Europe headquarters
in southern Belgium.
   ``Our potential adversaries are still quite big and
unpredictable.''
   In ``Armada Exchange,'' 2,500 Allied Mobile Force troops from
Belgium, West Germany, Luxembourg, Britain and the United States
join 1,500 Italian soldiers and air forces for a land and air
exercise in northeastern Italy.
   The multinational force is a rapid-deployment unit for use on the
NATO flanks. It is to be deployed in times of crises before the
outbreak of war, when the key aim is to deter an attack.

   PTL raised nearly $17 million in one week
during 1986, but its Heritage Grand Hotel was almost constantly
short of cash, the jury in Jim Bakker's fraud trial was told today.
   The testimony came after a day after the judge pronounced the TV
evangelist competent to stand trial. A government psychiatrist had
testified that Bakker suffered a ``panic attack'' last week but is
not going crazy.
   Delores Jones, who worked in PTL's cash management office,
testified this morning that during the week of May 31, 1986, the
ministry collected $13,000 from passing the plate at Sunday services
and $7,000 from the TV audience of ``The Jim and Tammy Show.''
   ``It was sometimes more, sometimes less,'' she said when asked
whether the $20,000 in cash collections for the week were unusual.
   Ms. Jones said the rest of the $17 million ``would have to be the
Lifetime Silver 1000 Account,'' one of several ``lifetime
partnership'' programs that offered $1,000 contributors three
nights' free lodging each year for life.
   Prosecutors say Bakker and other PTL executives diverted to their
own use more than $4 million of the $158 million raised by
partnerships from 1984 to 1987. If convicted on all counts, Bakker
could receive 120 years in prison and more than $5 million in fines.
   William Maybrey, general manager of Heritage Grand Hotel in
1984-85, testified today that the management contract with Brock
Hotel Corp. required that half the 500 rooms be set aside for
lifetime partners. Brock employed Maybrey to run the hotel.
   He said PTL had agreed to keep a $300,000 balance in an operating
account for the hotel, but he warned Bakker in two memos in 1985
that the account was at least $195,000 short of the requirement.
Brock had to pay employees out of its own funds at one point because
of the shortages, Maybrey testified.
   ``It was difficult to balance the level of services with the cash
flow problems we were experiencing,'' said Maybrey.
   Last week, U.S. District Judge Robert Potter committed Bakker to
a federal prison for psychiatric evaluation after his lawyers
reported he was hallucinating and cowering under a couch. After a
competency hearing Wednesday out of sight of the jury, Potter
released Bakker.
   ``He is not going crazy,'' Dr. Sally Johnson, head of the
psychiatric team at the Federal Correctional Institution in Butner,
told the judge. ``He has no hidden mental illness. The stress that
he's feeling is normal.''
   Ms. Johnson said she didn't think Bakker had faked his breakdown.
She said Bakker told her that journalists at the courthouse took on
the form of frightening animals.
   In Wednesday's testimony, former fund-raiser Carol Price broke
into tears when she described trying to discourage an elderly woman
from purchasing a $1,000 lifetime partnership. She said she was
fired for complaining about PTL policy.
   ``I told her that selling a burial policy to buy a lifetime
partnership was not a good idea,'' Ms. Price said Wednesday.
   Former PTL Vice President Steve Nelson, whose fainting episode on
the stand last week was cited by doctors as triggering Bakker's
breakdown, returned to testify Wednesday.
   Nelson said he had gone to Bakker and former PTL Vice President
Richard Dortch with concerns over the number of ``lifetime
partnerships'' sold at the 500-room Heritage Grand Hotel.
   ``I told them we had problems getting people in there,'' he said.
``I told them we could not sell more memberships.''
   Ms. Price testified that workers were encouraged to sell as many
partnerships as they could, regardless of whether the hotel could
accommodate them.
   Ms. Price, who was in charge of handling partner relations, said
she took her concerns to Bakker on several occasions. She said that
when she and 10 members of her staff were fired in 1985, she asked
Nelson, her boss at the time, why she was let go.
   ``He leaned back in his chair and said, `That's the price you pay
for knowing too much and not keeping your mouth shut,''' she said,
crying. ``Ten people lost their jobs because my conscience wouldn't
let me keep my mouth shut. I carry that with me to this day.''
   Bakker, who said he was suffering from the flu, appeared more
alert during Wednesday's testimony. He smiled, chatted with
attorneys and reviewed documents.
   He showed little emotion during the morning competency hearing,
sometimes hanging his head and staring at the floor.
   Bakker, who resigned from the PTL ministry in 1987 in a
sex-and-money scandal, went on trial Aug. 28.
   Prosecutors contend Bakker oversold the partnerships and used
nearly $4 million in ministry funds to live in high style.

<HEAD>U.S. Fights Oakland Ordinance Barring Nuclear Weapons</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB EGELKO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration is suing to overturn
an Oakland ordinance barring ``nuclear weapons work'' in the city.
   The ordinance _ one of the few such nuclear-free ordinances not
considered symbolic among about 160 in the country _
unconstitutionally interferes with national defense, the Justice
Department said in a lawsuit filed Wednesday in federal court.
   The ordinance could force two federal installations employing
2,170 people to leave Oakland, the department said.
   They are the Naval Supply Center, which supplies Pacific Fleet
ships with components for nuclear weapons, and a Department of
Energy operations office overseeing weapons research at the Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratory east of Oakland.
   But Steve Bloom, primary author of the ballot initiative, said
the measure approved by voters in November was drafted to exclude
the Naval Supply Center, where more than 2,000 people work.
   And City Attorney Jayne Williams said the ban on nuclear weapons
work covered such activities as ``creating nuclear weapons in their
offices,'' and should not apply to an administrative office like the
DOE's.
   The lawsuit said the Constitution gives the federal government
exclusive authority over defense. The lawsuit also said the Atomic
Energy Act gives the federal government sole authority over nuclear
weapons and nuclear energy.
   The ballot initiative's sponsors countered that local communities
also have rights.
   ``We should be able to exercise the full power of local
governments to protect our health and safety and to direct policy
about what happens in our city jurisdictions,'' said Madge Strong of
the Nuclear-Free Oakland Coalition.
   Bloom added that the First Amendment should take precedence.
   ``The people of an entire city are saying, we don't want this
going on. The federal government is saying, you have no right to say
that. That ceases to be democracy,'' Bloom said.
   Williams, the city attorney, called Oakland's nuclear-free
ordinance one of the broadest in the country. Among other things, it
bans nuclear weapons work in the city in two years.
   Williams said she believed it was the first such ordinance the
federal government has challenged. A conservative legal group filed
a federal lawsuit challenging it four months ago.

   Someone paid Ferdinand Marcos' $500,000 hospital
bill, but his wife said she was unsure exactly how the payment was
arranged.
   Eugene Tiwanak, a spokesman for St. Francis Medical Center,
confirmed Wednesday the bill had been paid in full.
   Marcos' basic intensive-care needs cost about $2,000 a day. The
former Philippine president has been hospitalized since Jan. 15 for
treatment of heart, lung and kidney ailments. He remained in very
critical condition Thursday.
   Imelda Marcos said the money might have come from loans from
friends and supporters and from assets not frozen by the courts.
   Tiwanak said the Marcoses at first were not paying their bills
and officials approached the family when the bills reached $300,000.
   In March, Mrs. Marcos asked the U.S. government to cover the
hospital costs, saying she and her husband had been brought to this
country against their will.
   Mrs. Marcos said the U.S. government never responded to that
request.
   The money paid to the hospital does not include an estimated
$250,000 owed to Marcos' doctors.

   Mary Kathleen Kaufman won't have to ask her
husband how his day at work went for a while: She's a juror in a
malpractice case over which he is presiding.
   ``Yes, I'm your wife,'' Mrs. Kaufman responded Wednesday when
Wayne County Circuit Judge Charles Kaufman asked if she was related
to anyone in the courtroom.
   Mrs. Kaufman was among prospective jurors selected randomly from
lists of licensed drivers. Neither attorney struck her name from the
list, so she was seated on the jury.
   ``I didn't really know what to do with her,'' said Euel Kinsey,
the attorney representing a man suing over a wrist injury. ``But as
the judge handled the questioning, it developed that she could be
fair and impartial. It was cute, him asking her questions he already
knew the answers to.''
   ``She seemed like a nice and conscientious lady,'' defense
attorney Kenneth M. Mattson said.
   ``She'll be wonderful. She's very fair,'' the judge allowed.

   Final touches are being put on Lincoln's
first trashy video, but the producer isn't worried about legal
ramifications.
   In fact, Doug Boyd of the Citizen Information Center, is making
this video with the blessings of the League of Women Voters and the
Economic Development Department.
   And ``Give Trash a Second Chance'' gets only an R rating _ four
Rs, that is: reduce, reuse, recycle and recover.
   The intent of the video is to educate people about the the city's
goal of reducing the amount of trash going to its new landfill by 40
percent and to change waste disposal habits.
   ``You can't make a video and expect the problem to be solved. But
it's a part of the process, a valuable, important resource,'' Boyd
said.
   The video, which features the ``Garbage'' song by Pete Seeger,
begins with shots of people overstuffing trash cans. It includes a
shot of deep piles of garbage bags strung out for 20 miles to depict
the amount of trash the city sends to the landfill each year.
   City recycling coordinator Gene Hanlon said a follow-up recycling
``how-to'' video is in the works, funded by the $2,000 or so
remaining from the initial $5,000 grant from the League of Women
Voters.

<TEXT>
   The judging system of the Miss America
Pageant has changed so much that a retired statistics professor has
stopped his tradition of predicting who the new Miss America will be.
   George L. Miller of Bellevue, Wash., who retired in 1984 from
Northern Illinois University, says his statistical model was thrown
off balance by the decreasing emphasis on swimsuits and additional
emphasis on brains.
   ``The interview counts for 30 percent this year, and I can't get
any information related to the interviews,'' said Miller. ``The
swimsuit counts only for 15 percent this year. They've downgraded
swimsuits so much that it took care of poor old George.''
   Each year, Miller, 66, compiled statistics on every Miss America
contestant and past winners, tallying up a composite to set odds on
woman might win. His first year he correctly predicted Cheryl
Prewitt would be crowned Miss America 1980. He then named four more
winners over the next nine years.
   But in the past few years, his statistical odds have failed. He
gave little hope to the past two winners, saying a Tahitian dancer
and a violinist had little chance of capturing the crown. They did,
and the dancer _ Miss America 1988 Kaye Lani Rae Rafko _ turned out
to be Miller's favorite so far.
   Miller used various statistics to devise his predictions,
including height, weight, hair and eye color, academic major and
talent. He was forced to stop using bust, waist and hip measurements
after the pageant stopped releasing those figures three years ago.
   Despite the changes, he said, ``in some ways, they're improving
the pageant.''
   ``They're getting better people. They seem brighter and come from
better schools.''
   Last year's winner, Gretchen Elizabeth Carlson, attends Stanford
University and hopes to go to law school. This year's winner is to
be crowned Sept. 16.
   Pageant officials were never pleased at Miller's uninvited annual
prediction. Leonard Horn, director of the Miss America Pageant, was
not disappointed to learn Miller would not pick a winner this year.
   ``The fact that he's decided not to do it proves these young
women are individuals with varying degrees of talents and positive
characters,'' Horn said.
   Miller said he will switch from beauty queens to baseball. ``Some
people may think I'm backsliding, but some may think I'm moving
forward,'' he said.

   The pilot of a jetliner that crashed in Havana
and killed 170 people took off in severe winds against the control
tower's advice, Cuban news reports said Thursday.
   The Soviet-made Cubana de Aviacion jet crashed into a suburb off
the end of the runway Sunday. All but one of the 126 people on board
died, and 45 people on the ground were killed.
   Gen. Rogelio Acevedo, head of the Cuban government commission
investigating the Sunday crash, said winds up to 30 mph near the end
of the Jose Marti airport runway in Havana were believed to be the
basic cause of the crash, the Cuban government news agency Prensa
Latina said.
   The tower advised the pilot, Capt. Armando Oliveros, to wait
before leaving, and the commission thinks his decision to take off
was in error, the agency quoted Acevedo as saying.
   Luigi Capalbo, 22, of Parma, Italy, was the only survivor on the
Ilyushin 62. Doctors at Hermanos Ameijeiras Hospital were treating
him for head injuries, burns over 65 percent of his body and a
broken left leg.
   Acevedo, who is president of the Civil Aeronautics Institute,
said the pilot, faced with winds of 28 to 30 mph and heavy rain,
reduced the angle of the wing flaps apparently to gain speed, but
wind drove the plane down.
   A tail wheel struck the runway and the right wing hit an antenna
at the end of the runway. The plane then lifted slightly, clearing a
concrete median on a major street, and plunged into homes, he said.
Two square blocks were destroyed.
   No indication was found of mechanical problems on the 7-month-old
plane, which had been flown 1,300 hours, he said.
   Oliveros, 51, had been flying 29 years and instructed other
pilots, the news agency said.
   Builders of the plane arrived early Thursday from the Soviet
Union to aid Cuban and Italian teams in the investigation. One of
their tasks will be to analyze data on the three flight recorders
that were recovered.

   Daniel Boyle said he would ask the County Board to approve an

   Boyle said he would also try to persuade pet owners and

   ``This is going to be, essentially, the ultimate ID,'' Boyle said
Wednesday. ``Since the dog can't talk, maybe his chip can talk for
him.''
   If approved, the county would register the ID numbers of all the
microchipped pets.
   The chips are manfuactured by a California company, American
Veterinary Indentification Devices Inc.
   Hannis Stoddard, a veterinarian and chief executive officer of
the company, said the chips have been implanted in 5,000 prize
hunting falcons owned by a sheik of the United Arab Emirates.
   ``It's the only unalterable ID ... that can be used safely and
humanely for animals, and it does not scar or disfigure them,''
Stoddard said.
   The microchip, about the size of a grain of rice, is injected via
a syringe into the fatty tissue above the shoulder or hip of a dog
or cat. The number on the microchip can be read by a handheld
scanner.
   Boyle said a microchip injection by a veterinarian would cost $20
to $25.

<HEAD>State Judge Allows Bush Administration to Enter Shoreham Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARC HUMBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TROY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A state judge today ruled that the Bush
administration _ the most powerful opponent to Gov. Mario Cuomo's
plan to tear down the Shoreham nuclear plant _ may enter the state
court fight against the agreement.
   Supreme Court Justice F. Warren Travers ruled that the federal
Department of Energy was an ``interested party'' through its
ownership of the Brookhaven National Laboratory on Long Island.
   There was no immediate word from the Cuomo administration on
whether it will appeal.
   Cuomo has sought to prevent the $5.5 billion plant on Long Island
from operating because of concern over whether the region can be
safely evacuated.
   Under a deal negotiated by Cuomo and the Long Island Lighting
Co., the state will buy the plant for $1 and have it dismantled. In
return, LILCO gets at least a decade's worth of annual rate
increases of about 10 percent. Its customers already pay among the
highest electric rates in the nation.
   If the deal goes through, and it has already been approved by the
required state agencies and LILCO stockholders, it will be the first
time a completed nuclear plant was torn down without having gone
into commercial operation.
   In his ruling, Travers noted that Brookhaven lies on 5,000 acres
of federal land and that the DOE intends to purchase 41,000 megawatt
hours of electricity from the Long Island Lighting Co. this year at
a cost of more than $3 million.
   ``Here, where DOE is a landowner and user of power provided by
LILCO, the court, in its discretion determines that DOE should be
allowed to and is granted permission to intervene,'' said Travers.
   Last week, state lawyers argued that DOE intervention would be
``superfluous'' and that interested parties were all represented in
a lawsuit filed against the Shoreham deal by the conservative
Atlantic Legal Foundation.
   The lawsuit before Travers argues, among other things, that Cuomo
usurped the power of the Legislature in negotiating the Shoreham
deal and that there should have been a state environmental impact
statement.
   Travers has yet to rule on the merits of those arguments.

   Mother Teresa, who won the Nobel Peace
Prize for her work with the poor and destitute, has been admitted to
the intensive care unit of a Calcutta hospital with a heart ailment,
doctors said Thursday.
   She was admitted to a private hosptial Tuesday with high fever
and an irregular heartbeat, but her condition is stable, said Dr. A.
Bardhan, a cardiologist who treated the 79-year-old nun.
   Mother Teresa, who was given the 1979 Nobel Peace prize, became
ill Sunday night, said an aide who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   She attended mass Monday but was moved to hospital when her
condition deteriorated Tuesday, the aide said.
   The Roman Catholic nun, revered in India as a living saint, was
born in Albania. She founded the Missionaries of Charity, an order
of 3,000 nuns in 87 countries, in 1950.

   A New England Telephone Co. cable was
cut early Thursday, knocking out service to tens of thousands of
customers in Massachsuetts and Rhode Island.
   The company said three fiber optic lines were cut in a
Bridgewater manhole about 2:30 a.m., but spokeswoman Claire
Silvestri said the company was not pointing blame.
   ``Let's just say that the rural location of the manhole and the
selection of the cables in the manhole seems to indicate that the
person, or persons, chose the location carefully and knew what to do
to disrupt service,'' she said.
   The Communication Workers of America and the International
Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 2222 have been striking
against NET parent company NYNEX Corp. for about six weeks, but
neither union has advocated vandalism.
   The vandalism disrupted toll call service from Boston to the
region's communities and calls between Boston and Rhode Island.
Silvestri also said that customers in most communities also had
difficutly reaching an operator.
   The company offered a $50,000 reward for information leading to
the conviction of the vandals.

   Clayton Hartwig's family today rejected the
Navy's conclusion that the gunner's mate probably caused the
explosion that killed 47 sailors on the USS Iowa by shoving a
detonator between gunpowder bags.
   ``I never believed it right from the start,'' Kathy Kubicina,
Hartwig's sister, said outside her father's home following a
two-hour briefing by Navy officers this morning. ``I didn't really
hear anything I didn't hear before.''
   The family attorney, Kraig Brusnahan, said Hartwig's relatives
want a congressional investigation into the Navy probe of the April
19 blast aboard the battleship and repeated leaks to the news media
from investigators.
   ``The Navy is kind of investigating itself and clearing itself,''
said Brusnahan.
   Hartwig's father, Earl V. Hartwig, a Navy veteran, also said he
didn't believe the Navy conclusion. ``I think there was a powder
explosion _ accidental _ that caused the explosion,'' Hartwig said.
   The family was briefed at Hartwig's home by a three-officer team
led by Capt. Douglas J. Katz.
   ``This is probably one of the hardest things I've ever done in my
entire life,'' said Katz, who left the home a half hour before the
Pentagon released the report on the April 19 disaster off Puerto
Rico.
   The report said the exact cause of the explosion, the worst naval
disaster since the Vietnam War, cannot be pinpointed since the
sailors close enough to see what was going on, including Hartwig,
were all killed in the fiery blast.
   However, Rear Adm. Richard Milligan, presenting the conclusions
in Washington, said there was much ``circumstantial information''
pointing to Hartwig.
   He cited an FBI psychological profile of Hartwig ``with the
opinion that he took his own life and hoped it looked like an
accident.''
   Navy investigators had been examining the possibility that
suicide or murder was involved in the explosion.

   An elementary school principal kept an 11-inch
python in his office and showed it to children who misbehaved,
parents charged.
   The principal, who has been transferred to another school, said
the charges were unfounded.
   ``It was intimidating. He would feed it mice and the snake would
crush them. I don't know what the children thought, but the parents
didn't like it,'' said Dorothy Carrillo, a spokeswoman for the

   Robert Hill Lane Elementary School Principal Dennis Duylea called
the charges ``ludicrous.''
   The school district found no wrongdoing on his part. The
transfer, the district said, was to ensure ``a quiet operating
environment'' for students.
   Deputy district Superintendent Sidney Thompson said: ``There is
no evidence he used the snake in a threatening manner. It was a
scientific instrument.''
   Duylea denied frightening children with the snake, saying it was
part of a reptile study program.
   ``He was not used to intimidate people. He's a nice guy. He's not
dangerous,'' he said. ``Yes, he did eat mice, but that is a fact of
nature. Snakes eat live mice.''

<TEXT>
   A reputed money-launderer for the Medellin cocaine
cartel arrived in the United States under heavy guard today at a
tiny suburban airport, the first person extradited from Colombia in
its recent drug crackdown.
   Eduardo Martinez Romero, who is accused of helping the drug
cartel launder at least $15 million, later appeared with a lawyer at
a preliminary federal court hearing, telling Magistrate Joel M.
Feldman through an interpreter that he speaks only Spanish and does
not fully understand the charges against him.
   Feldman postponed arraignment until Monday and ordered Martinez
held without bail until then. Prosecutors said they would ask that
he be denied bail then. They would not say disclose where Martinez
was being held.
   Martinez left Bogota aboard a Drug Enforcement Administration
plane on Wednesday night, federal officials said.
   U.S. Attorney Robert Barr of Atlanta said the plane landed under
tight security just outside Atlanta today at Charlie Brown Airport,
a small, county-run airport used by private planes. Martinez was
whisked away in a helicopter.
   He appeared in court without handcuffs or leg irons. Additional
officers were in the courtroom and security appeared higher, but not
extraordinarily so.
   Federal agents were ``on an increased state of alert'' for any
retaliation from the Medellin cartel, said Weldon Kennedy, agent in
charge of the FBI in Atlanta.
   ``We're very concerned because of the events transpiring and
because of the violence that has occurred in Colombia,'' Kennedy
said.
   He said some cartel members reportedly have said ``there might be
... some violent act attempted in the United States because of the
extradition.''
   Martinez was arrested the first weekend after Colombian President
Virgilio Barco launched a crackdown on drug traffickers triggered by
the Aug. 18 assassination of leading presidential candidate Luis
Carlos Galan, an outspoken foe of the drug trade.
   The Bogota newspaper El Tiempo quoted Martinez after his arrest
as saying he was innocent.
   ``At no time have I had links to the Medellin cartel and I don't
know any of its members,'' he said.
   In the emergency measures imposed by Barco was a reinstitution of
the extradition agreement with the United States that had been
thrown out by the Colombian Supreme Court in 1987.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said in a statement late
Wednesday, ``I applaud the extraordinary courage and resolve of
President Virgilio Barco and the government of Colombia in their
efforts to restore the rule of law to Colombia.''
   Martinez, 36, was indicted in March in Atlanta as a result of an
investigation code-named Operation Polar Cap that federal officials
said revealed an operation that laundered billions of dollars in
cocaine profits through U.S. and foreign banks. Charges were brought
against 127 people and two Latin American banks as a result of that
investigation.
   Drug traffickers in Colombia, who supply an estimated 80 percent
of the cocaine consumed in the United States, are said to fear
extradition to the United States because they believe they will not
be able to escape conviction and prison sentences.
   In response to Barco's crackdown, the traffickers declared
``total war'' on the government and have carried out bombings and
shootings in Medellin, home of the world's largest drug cartel and
the second largest city in the country, and in Bogota, the largest
and the capital.
   The last trafficker to be extradited was Carlos Lehder, a leader
of the Medellin cartel who was sent to the United States in 1987 and
is serving a life sentence in the federal prison in Marion, Ill.
   The U.S. government responded to the outbreak of violence in
Colombia by sending $65 million equipment and other aid _ airplanes,
helicopters and vehicles _ as well as military advisers to the South
American country.
   In addition, plans were accelerated to send some $2.5 million
worth of help to protect Colombian judges, dozens of whom have been
killed by drug gangs.
   In his national drug control strategy announced Tuesday night,
Bush said military and law enforcement aid to Colombia, Peru and
Bolivia would increase from an estimated $53 million this year to
$261 million next year. The administration also promised an
additional $2 billion over the next five years to the three
countries if they demonstrated their commitment to cracking down on
drugs.
   Meanwhile, the DEA said Wednesday that drug agents have detected
a sharp increase in cocaine prices in Miami over the past few weeks
but they're not ready to say whether it is due to the crackdown on
traffickers.
   The retail price of cocaine in South Florida has gone from an
average of $11,000 to $16,000 per kilogram to about $20,000, based
on sales of 5 to 15 kilograms, said DEA spokesman Frank Shults.
   Whether Colombia's crackdown on traffickers is actually stemming
the flow of drugs into the United States, the price increase
probably has been enhanced by that effort, Shults said.
   ``It may just be individual entrepreneurs capitalizing on
perceived market pressures,'' he said.

<HEAD>Frank Defends Voiding Tickets Incurred by Aide Who Was Prostitute</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rep. Barney Frank said Thursday he used his
congressional immunity to void parking tickets incurred by a
personal aide who was also a male prostitute, but only when the
assistant had used Frank's car for official business.
   Frank, D-Mass., said he allowed the aide, Stephen L. Gobie, to
use his car for official business and also gave him authorization to
drive it when the congressman was out of town.
   The lawmaker had said earlier that he hired Gobie in July 1985 as
his housekeeper and driver, paying him from personal funds, and
fired him in August 1987.
   Frank, an acknowledged homosexual who has asked that his
situation with Gobie be investigated by the House ethics committee,
issued a statement on the parking tickets after a story on the
subject appeared in Thursday's Washington Times.
   ``Part of Mr. Gobie's uties was the use of my car on official
business and access to my car when I was away from Washington,''
Frank's statement said. ``There are some occasions when tickets were
issued even though the car was being used on official business. I
did ask that such tickets be waived. At all other times, it was my
policy to pay for tickets incurred.''
   Frank branded as ``lies'' Gobie's assertion to the Times that the
lawmaker had knowingly intervened to waive tickets the aide received
while using Frank's car to keep appointments for illicit sex.
   Gobie told the Times he used the car to transport prostitutes and
even to have sex. He previously said he operated an escort service
from Frank's Capitol Hill apartment.
   ``He knew what I was doing,'' said Gobie. ``I used to drive that
car around all the time.''
   Gobie told the Times he always left Frank's official
congressional plate on the dashboard when he used the car. He said
Frank's car was ticketed about 50 times over a year-and-a-half.
   Frank has said he paid Gobie $80 for sex after answering a
classified ad in a Washington gay newspaper in the spring of 1985.
   The representative said he then hired Gobie as his housekeeper
and driver, hoping to change his ways, but fired him when he found
out Gobie was using Frank's apartment to operate a prostitution ring.
   In Thursday's statement, Frank said, ``These and all other issues
are rightfully before the House ethics committee at my request and
will be dealt with in detail.''

<HEAD>Chinese Pilot Says He Defected Because of Military Crackdown</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SHIRLEY LAI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Chinese air force pilot who flew a MiG-19
jet to Taiwan said Thursday he defected because of his contempt for
the Communist government after its suppression of a movement for
democracy.
   Lt. Chiang Wen-hao, 24, told reporters he sympathizes with the
soldiers who carried out the crackdown in June, saying they had to
follow government orders.
   ``I don't want to dedicate my blood and my life to a Communist
regime that the people spit on in contempt,'' said Chiang.
   For the defection, Taiwain will pay him 206 pounds of gold worth
about $880,000. Taiwan has a sliding scale of gold rewards for
Chinese military defectors, calculated on the type of aircraft they
bring out.
   Chiang flew his Soviet-built fighter to the Nationalist-held
island of Quemoy on Wednesday from Longxi airport in China's
southern Fujian province, just over a mile away. The flight took 14
minutes.
   He was brought to Taipei on Thursday for a news conference and
told reporters he had planned to defect for two years but was
spurred to action by the June crackdown on the student-led democracy
movement at Tiananmen Square in Beijing.
   After taking off, Chiang said he kept the fighter low to escape
pursuing aircraft, but the Chinese air force apparently did not
notice he had left.
   ``I was so nervous that I didn't know if anyone followed me,'' he
said. ``I could still hear the air base's communications when I
landed at Quemoy airport.''
   Chiang said he left his parents, a sister, and his grandmother
behind.
   In Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Li Zhaoxing said
``the press reports about the plane are under investigation by the
departments concerned.''
   Chiang defended the Chinese military, which fired on thousands of
residents in Beijing on June 3-4.
   ``The military stood beside the people and supported the
pro-democracy movement, but they had to carry out orders from
authorities,'' he said. ``They executed orders against their own
will. I sympathize with the soldiers. They were but the tools to
execute the orders of the Chinese Communist Party.''
   China says about 300 people died in the street clashes, including
unspecified ``dozens'' of security personnel and more than 200
civilians. Western security sources say the death toll may have been
3,000.
   Four women from the opposition Democratic Progressive Party
draped a banner outside the conference room protesting Chiang's
entry to Taiwan. They said the government should not welcome
communists while barring many Taiwanese political dissidents from
returning home.
   The last Chinese pilot to defect to Taiwan, Liu Chih-yuan, 30,
also flew a MiG-19 when he fled in 1987. The Nationalist government
rewarded him with 412 pounds of gold then valued at about $3
million. Liu, now a member of Taiwan's air force, was at the news
conference to show support for Chiang.
   Last year, gold rewards were cut by more than 50 percent after
China abolished a similar practice of rewarding defectors from
Taiwan.
   Officials said 14 Chinese military personnel have defected to
Taiwan since 1949, when the Nationalists fled to this island after
losing a civil war to the Communist forces on mainland China.
   China regards Taiwan as a renegade province and the two
technically still are at war.
   More than a dozen Nationalist air force officers have sought
asylum in China since 1949. The most recent Nationalist defection
was in February when Lt. Col. Lin Xianshun parachuted to safety as
his F-5E jet crashed in a rice paddy in Guangdong province.

<HEAD>General in Charge of Dispersing Protest Removed</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A Soviet general who reportedly ordered an army
assault that killed 19 demonstrators in the Georgian city of Tbilisi
in April has been removed from his post, officials said Thursday.
   Col. Gen. Igor Rodionov, who was head of the Transcaucasian
Military District, was replaced by Col. Gen. Valery O. Patrikeyev,
said an editor at the official Gruzinform news agency in Tbilisi,
the capital of the Georgian republic.
   Spokesman Vyacheslav Kirillov of the Soviet Defense Ministry's
International Relations Department confirmed that Rodionov had been
removed.
   Neither had any information on Patrikeyev.
   Nationalists have accused Rodionov of ordering soldiers armed
with shovels and irritating gas to attack a crowd on Tbilisi's
Rustavelli Prospekt the night of April 9.
   The protest was a demonstration for more autonomy for the
republic. Nineteen people were killed in the assault and another
young man was shot for violating a curfew that was imposed later.
   Rodionov was chosen a representative to the national Congress of
People's Deputies parliament in March, and he staunchly defended
himself during debate on the assault at the congress' first session.
   Rodionov said the protest turned into a ``pure orgy, with
anti-Soviet slogans ... appeals to overturn the government, appeals
to exterminate communists.''
   A Georgian commission accused the military of a ``planned mass
massacre.''
   The removal of Rodionov also was noted in a dispatch by the Tass
news agency in a report on Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze's
visit to Georgia.
   Tass said Shevardnadze told Georgian party officials they had
made progress in mending ethnic relations since April but that it
still was the most difficult problem they face.
   The foreign minister, who used to be the Communist Party chief in
Georgia, said, ``It's as if much appears quiet on the outside, but
on the inside everything is boiling, and the situation continues to
be explosive.''

<HEAD>House Votes to Reward Hungary's Economic Reform</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House, eager to reward Hungary for its
steps toward economic openness and human rights, voted Thursday to
grant the Warsaw Pact nation a three-year extension of preferential
trade status.
   The 221-169 vote, over the objection of President Bush, sent the
matter to the Senate.
   The bill would grant an extension through July 4, 1992, of the
most-favored-nation trading status Hungary currently enjoys on a
year-to-year basis. Sponsors of the bill said it was time to reward
Hungary's moves toward a more Western-style market economy and
relatively open emigration policies.
   ``For 25 years they have fought the communists, and they have
turned that country around, and we have not done a damn thing to
help them,'' said Rep. Sam Gibbons, D-Fla., chairman of the Ways and
Means trade subcommittee.
   The original measure would have provided a five-year extension,
but that was scaled back in a compromise with opponents, primarily
conservative Republicans, who argued the gesture infringes on Bush's
right to conduct foreign policy and diminishes pressure on Hungary
to keep the reforms going.
   ``Let us remember that Hungary remains a member in good standing
of the Warsaw Pact,'' said Rep. Gerry Solomon, R-N.Y., speaking
against the provision.
   ``This bill is an embarrassment to the people of Hungary who have
been fighting for their freedom. They want the pressure kept on
their government to allow them to live where they want to live, work
where they want to work, move where they want to move,'' he said.
   ``This is a fairly delicate time,'' said Rep. Richard T. Schulze,
R-Pa., who helped work out the three-year compromise. ``I don't
think we should let the emotional euphoria (over Hungarian reform)
carry us into a policy we might regret.''
   The five-year version of the bill had been rejected by the House
in June when it failed to muster the two-thirds majority needed
under the expedited floor procedure used to bring it before the
chamber.
   At the time, opponents argued that Bush was about to travel to
Eastern Europe, including Budapest, and planned to annouce his own
rewards for Hungary. During his trip, Bush declared ``the Iron
Curtain has begun to part'' and promised new trade benefits and a
$25 million grant to spur free enterprise.
   Bush said he would be inclined to grant permanent
most-favored-nation status, which offers the best tariff rates
available, if Hungary adopts a liberalized emigration law now under
consideration.
   Current law bars most-favored-nation status to communist
countries with restrictive emigration policies. Since the ban was
imposed in 1974, three nations have been granted waivers: Hungary,
Romania and China.
   ``The president of the United States went over there and put his
Good Housekeeping seal of approval on it,'' argued Rep. Larry Smith,
D-Fla., speaking for the bill. ``This is a country that has proven
over and over again that it wants to be free, open and democratic.''

   A grand jury indicted one of its own

bilking three men in a stock scheme.
   In an indictment issued Tuesday, the grand jury charged Michael
McCay, 24, with two counts of first-degree forgery, four of theft by

   Representatives of the government of Ethiopia and
an Eritrean rebel group began preliminary talks at the Carter
Presidential Center today in an effort to end the war that has raged
between the two since 1961.
   Former President Jimmy Carter, acting as an observer at the
closed-door talks, said the two sides agreed that no statements on
the progress of the negotiations will be made until the open-ended
sessions are complete.
   Delegations from the government and the Eritrean People's
Liberation Front appeared with Carter at a news conference after
arriving at the center.
   Alamin Mohamed Saiyed, head of the EPLF negotiating team, said
through an interpreter that his people want a ``just and peaceful
solution'' to the war.
   ``We realize that the path to peace is tortuous and requires
patience and time. The Eritrean case cannot be resolved either by
evading it or by cover-ups,'' he said. ``It cannot also be solved by
running away from the truth or by playing some tricks.''
   Ashegre Yigletu, head of the government delegation, said, ``We
would like to affirm that the delegation ... is prepared to conduct
these talks tirelessly and with the utmost patience, and in a new
spirit of broad-mindedness.''
   Carter said he did not know how long the talks would last. He
said the first order of business was an agenda.
   The former president stressed that the talks here are preliminary
and that it would take further negotiations, with the top leaders of
Ethiopia and the EPLF participating, to produce concrete results.
   ``Both sides have limits with how far they want to go in
Atlanta,'' he said.
   An estimated 1 million people have died in the 28 years that the
Eritrean People's Liberation Front has been fighting for
independence.
   Eritrea, a former Italian colony, is a province of Ethiopia and
contains the troubled East African nation's only direct access to
the Red Sea.
   The Carter Center, which houses the presidential library, a
museum, a think tank and foundations working for peace and public
health, is trying to fill a gap by acting as go-between in the
dispute. U.N. intervention is limited to disputes between nations.
   ``These are very intransigent, difficult, dividing issues that
have never been addressed in a substantive way before,'' Carter said
recently. ``Of course my hope is, my expectation is, that we'll go
from there to fairly sustained talks that might bring about a
cease-fire.''
   During his presidency, Carter served as a go-between in the Camp
David talks that led to an accord between Israel and Egypt.
   The Atlanta Constitution reported today that Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak has been asked by both sides to serve as mediator if
the Atlanta talks lead to further negotiations. Mubarak succeeded
Anwar Sadat, who took part in the Camp David accords.
   Exactly when such long-term talks on Ethiopia would be held and
who would oversee them are matters the delegations hope to decide in
Atlanta, Carter has said.

   American actor Mickey Rourke is only in films
to make money _ at least that's what he told an Italian interviewer.
   ``Until four years ago I still was an idealist, certain that to
be a good actor one must know acting ... now I know it's not that
way,'' he told Milan's Corriere della Sera newspaper.
   ``To be a star you must butter up the right people. They will get
this from me any time they pay me enough,'' he was quoted Thursday
as saying.
   Rourke, at the showing of his ``Johnny Handsome'' at the Venice
Film Festival, said he came ``just for business, for commercial
reasons.''
   The actor, whose relations with the media are often tense, had a
brief and stormy news conference Wednesday. Some Italian
commentators called him capricious and nasty.
   Rourke starred in `` 9{ Weeks,'' ``Barfly,'' and ``The Pope of
Greenwich Village.''

   A new Miss America will be selected
next week without a vote from actor-muscleman Arnold Schwarzenegger.
   Schwarzenegger withdrew from the judging because his wife, TV
reporter Maria Shriver, plans to report on the contest for NBC,
pageant director Leonard Horn said Thursday.
   ``She assured me that her post was unbudgeable and she felt there
was a conflict of interest,'' Horn said.
   Horn said he learned of the problem only last week, though Ms.
Shriver knew several months ago she was doing a piece on the Sept.
16 pageant for NBC's new show ``Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow.'' The
pageant will be on NBC.
   ``We saw no conflict, but she does,'' he said.
   Ms. Shriver's spokesman at NBC, Paul Reader, said she was
traveling and unavailable for comment.
   The judges who will choose Miss America from 10 finalists include
developer Donald Trump, entertainer Merv Griffin, former baseball
player Mike Schmidt, psychologist Joyce Brothers, actresses Phylicia
Rashad and Debbie Allen, and entertainment writer Claudia Cohen.

   Prince Charles prodded American businesses in
Britain on Thursday to contribute more to a trust that helps young
people set up their own businesses.
   ``I need your help,'' Charles, the heir to the British throne,
told a luncheon meeting of the American Chamber of Commerce.
   The Prince's Youth Business Trust was launched on his 40th
birthday last November. With a goal of $60 million, donations have
reached $42 million, with U.S. contributions accounting for $1.5
million.
   The trust provides seed money and professional advice to help
young people, particularly from Britain's economically depressed
inner cities, set up their own businesses.
   ``What I am trying to do is invest in this nation's future and as
you, on the whole, have operations in this country, you do to a
certain extent have a stake in that as well,'' Charles said.

2{-hour show that crossed several generations of rock 'n' roll
lovers.
   ``Hey, Pittsburgh, it's been a long time,'' guitarist Keith
Richards said Wednesday night as 63,000 jammed Three Rivers Stadium
for the hard rockers' first Pittsburgh concert since 1972.
   Mick Jagger praised the crowd for its dancing-in-the-aisles
enthusiasm and often stopped singing to let the fans take over.
   ``You're a rowdy, rowdy, rowdy, rowdy crowd, Pittsburgh,'' Jagger
said after a full-tilt version of the 1978 hit ``Miss You.''
   Teens danced to the band's latest single, ``Mixed Emotions,''
then watched bemusedly as their parents swayed to songs they didn't
recognize, such as ``Play With Fire'' and ``Little Red Rooster.''
   But all sang along to ``Honky Tonk Woman,'' ``Brown Sugar'' and
``You Can't Always Get What You Want,'' whch have become anthems to

   Singer Tom Jones will pay child support for a
14-month-old boy the entertainer fathered during a 1987 visit to New
York, said attorneys who reached a tentative settlement Thursday.
   But the settlement failed to assuage the feelings of the child's
mother, 27-year-old Katherine Berkery, who waged a bitter paternity
fight against Jones. Manhattan Family Court Judge Judith Sheindlin
ruled July 27 that the Welsh singer was the father of Jonathan Jones
Berkery.
   ``I think he's a disgusting human being,'' said Ms. Berkery after
the agreement was reached during a private negotiating session in
Family Court.
   Although no support figure was announced under terms of the
agreement, Ms. Berkery's lawyer, Raoul Felder, was reportedly
seeking $3,800 a month. Ms. Berkery said she was ``very happy with
what I'm going to get.''
   Alton Abramowitz, the attorney for Jones, said the agreement
still needs the singer's approval. Jones did not yet know the
details of the plan, Abramowitz said.
   During the paternity fight, attorneys for Jones argued Ms.
Berkery was a prostitute who lied about her background. Jones, who
has never seen the child, did not attend the hearings.
   Ms. Berkery said Jones fathered the child when they spent two
nights together in October 1987. The boy was born June 27, 1988.

<HEAD>EDS: LEADS with 10 grafs to UPDATE with vote on amendment to transfer
money from congressional mailing to program of assistance to mothers with
drug addictions; Picks up 9th graf pvs, The measure.</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate today approved 83-8 legislation
shifting $45 million used for congressional mailings to a drug
treatment program aimed at helping drug-addicted mothers and their
babies.
   The lopsided vote came over strong opposition from Sen. Ted
Stevens, R-Alaska, who accused its backers of political posturing at
the expense of lawmaker communications with constituents.
   Republicans proposed the measure Wednesday, the day after
President Bush announced a $7.9-billion anti-drug abuse campaign _
aimed at transferring the money from the account legislators use for
their mailings. The provision was offered as an amendment to a bill
providing $2 billion for Congress' own expenses for fiscal 1990,
which begins Oct. 1.
   The proposal all but eliminates district-wide mailings used often
by senators and representatives to keep their names in their
constituents' minds, but it allows members to continue answering
individual queries.
   Critics said the mass mailings provided taxpayer-financed
publicity to incumbents, making them difficult to defeat.
   Stevens had said Wednesday that such a dramatic cut in
congressional mailings to constituents would deprive Alaskans of an
important source of news. He said many Alaskans get no daily
newspapers and learn of news from Washington only from radio and
brief television broadcasts.
   ``We send out a postal patron newsletter to people who have no
other source of information about what's going on in the nation's
capital,'' Stevens told his colleagues.
   But Stevens lured few senators to his cause during today's
debate, although Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., did say he thought the
amendment was ``not in the national interest.''
   Seven Democrats and one Republican voted against the amendment.
They were: Bill Bradley, D-N.J.; Ernest Hollings, D-S.C.; Daniel
Inouye, D-Hawaii; Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn.; Spark Matsunaga,
D-Hawaii; Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y. and the Republican,
Stevens.
   Nine senators did not vote. Final action on the appropriations
bill was put off until later in the day.
   The measure was proposed by Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif., a
supporter of tougher efforts against drug abuse, a longtime critic
of the burgeoning costs of legislators' mailings and a candidate for
governor of California.
   ``What we are faced with is the opportunity to not spend on
newsletters, and instead to put this money into one of the least
well-funded'' drug programs, Wilson said.
   The money would go to a program started in 1988 that provides
treatment to drug-addicted pregnant women, focusing on those who use
crack. Wilson said 400,000 babies are born annually to mothers who
use drugs.
   In his Tuesday evening speech unveiling the $7.9 billion drug
campaign, Bush proposed spending $300 million for treatment
programs. He listed initiatives to help pregnant drug users as part
of the effort, but didn't specifically say how much should be spent
for them.
   Without Wilson's amendment, the legislative spending bill would
limit congressional spending on mail next year to $80 million: $48
million for the House, which has 435 members, and $32 million for
the 100-member Senate.
   The bill would also reduce from six to two the number of
district-wide mailings permitted each year, except for notices of
town meetings. Legislators could send more, but would have to pay
for them out of the funds each receives for general office expenses.
   Congress is on track to spend $53.9 million on its mail this
year, but those expenses traditionally skyrocket during election
years, which 1990 happens to be.
   The House passed a $1.6 billion version of the legislative
spending bill July 31 that would provide $124.7 million for
congressional mailings.
   House and Senate negotiators will have to find a compromise to
their differences over congressional mail before the bill can be
sent to Bush for his signature.

<HEAD>Sri Lankan Leader Invites Sinhalese, Tamil Rebels For Peace Talks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PATRICK CRUEZ</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has invited Sinhalese
and Tamil rebels for peace talks with all political parties in a bid
to end ethnic wars in which 16,000 people have been killed,
officials said Thursday.
   Military officials said the latest violence, largely inspired by
Sinhalese radicals of the People's Liberation Front, had claimed 32
lives since Wednesday.
   The Sinhalese group is an ultranationalist guerrilla organization
that has waged a campaign of assassinations and strikes to topple
President Ranasinghe Premadasa's government.
   Bradman Weerakoon, the president's foreign affairs adviser, told
reporters the government invited the People's Liberation Front and
leaders of Sri Lanka's 23 recognized parties to the proposed peace
conference Sept. 13.
   ``We have positive responses from 10 parties. We have not
received a single negative response. So for all intents and purposes
there is a general acceptance of the government's invitation,'' said
Weerakoon.
   He said the Sinhalese radicals are not among the 10 who have
accepted, but they have not rejected the invitation. The group has
rejected all previous peace overtures.
   Weerakoon said Premadasa also had invited the Liberation Tigers
of Tamil Eelam, a dominant separatist group, and other former Tamil
militant groups.
   Most groups of the minority Tamils ended their battle for an
independent nation in the northeast two years ago following an
accord that promised Tamils limited autonomy.
   But the Tamil Tigers reneged on the peace plan and began
attacking Indian peacekeeping soldiers deployed to supervise the
accord, which was signed June 29, 1987. At least 1,000 soldiers have
died in the fighting.
   At least 10,000 other people have been killed in the Tamil war.
Most of the deaths occurred between 1983, when the Tamils took up
arms, and 1987, when the accord was signed.
   After Tamil agitation subsided, Sinhalese radicals in the south
and center of the island began fighting to protest the accord, which
they said gives too many concessions to the minority Tamils, and an
Indian troop presence they charge compromises Sri Lanka's
sovereignty.
   Tamils form 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people and say
they are discriminated against by the Sinhalese who make up 75
percent of the population and control the government. Most Tamils
are Hindu, while Sinhalese are mainly Buddhist.
   The government says at least 5,000 people have died in the
Sinhalese rebellion and blames the radicals for most deaths. The
radicals say the military and pro-government vigilante groups are
responsible for the killings.
   Among the 32 people killed in the latest violence were three
soldiers blown up in a land mine blast Thursday, and another shot by
Sinhalese extremists who ambushed troops bathing in a stream, the
military officials said. They said they did not know who planted the
land mine.

<HEAD>Business Spending Plans Show No Fear of Recession</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Businesses plan to increase their plant and
equipment spending by 7.7 percent this year, the government said
Thursday in a report that analysts said shows no sign that industry
fears an imminent recession.
   ``It's yet another indication the economy looks quite healthy,''
said Allen Sinai, chief economist of The Boston Co.
   The Commerce Department reported that responses to a survey
completed last month show that businesses expect to spend $463.95
billion on expansion and modernization this year despite earlier
concern about a significant economic slowdown.
   If the plans are realized, capital spending this year would break
last year's record. The department revised its 1988 spending figure
to $430.74 billion from $423.69 reported earlier.
   All of the numbers are adjusted for inflation.
   Economists had worried that the economy, approaching its seventh
year of growth, might be stalled by Federal Reserve efforts to halt
inflation by restraining credit.
   However, interest rates began edging down last spring and a
number of statistics since then have shown an economy that is
slowing, though not as fast as previously thought.
   Sinai said the survey indicates ``nothing but a green go-light
for the economy for the rest of the year.''
   Plant and equipment spending is seen as a plus for the economy
because it indicates continued expansion and eases inflationary
pressures by increasing productive capacity.
   But economist Michael P. Niemira of Mitsubishi Bank in New York
said corporate profits have been falling recently and the subsequent
drain on cash flows is likely to have an effect on next year's
capital spending.
   ``Right now is the corporate planning time for next year when I
think we will see a much reduced pace,'' he said. ``But for this
year, the money has been allocated.''
   The Commerce Department surveys have shown a steady increase in
capital spending plans for this year. In its first survey, conducted
last December, companies had estimated their spending would rise 5.9
percent.
   Subsequent surveys showed spending plans up 6.3 percent in March
and 6.5 percent in June.
   Capital spending grew a revised 8.9 percent in 1988 after a
revised 4.2 percent gain in 1987. Plant and equipment spending fell
3.9 percent in 1986.
   Manufacturing companies estimated they would increase their
spending by 6.1 percent to $178.24 billion in the latest survey,
compared to a revised 11.7 percent advance in 1988. The new figure
includes a 2.8 percent gain for plants that produce durable goods,
big-ticket items expected to last more than three years, and a 9.1
percent gain for companies producing non-durable goods.
   Companies engaged in mining, transportation and other
non-manufacturing ventures said they planned to increase capital
spending by 8.7 percent to $285.72 billion.
   Before adjusting for inflation, 1989 capital spending is expected
to rise 10 percent to $473.65 billion, compared with 10.5 percent in
1988.

   Two holdup men shot and killed an armored
car guard and seriously wounded two other men today in the Bank of
America headquarters building, police said. Witnesses said the
gunmen fled on 10-speed bicycles.
   ``It looks like a well-planned, well-orchestrated robbery,'' said
Deputy Chief Larry Gurnett.
   It was not immediately known what, if anything, was taken.
   Police said it appeared the two robbers, in ski masks and
baseball caps, followed a pair of Brink's Inc. guards into the
55-story building in the city's financial district and for some
reason opened fire outside the indoor entrance to a Bank of America
branch on the office tower's ground floor.
   A third man, drawn to the scene by the gunfire, was wounded in
the mouth, said police Officer David Ambrose. He said police
received the first call at about 9:55 a.m.
   Ambrose said it also was not immediately clear if the Brink's
truck was there to pick up or drop off cash. The truck's driver
remained with the vehicle as required by Brink's policy and was not
injured, authorities said.
   Witnesses told police the holdup men fled on bicycles.
   ``We're trying to seal off as much as we can here and have an
opportunity to arrest these people,'' Ambrose said.
   A spokeswoman at San Francisco General Hospital said the dead
guard had gunshot wounds in the face and the back of the head. The
other guard was shot above the left eyebrow but was conscious, the
spokeswoman said.
   The third victim was listed in stable condition.

<DATELINE>COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An eight-month campaign to make honesty the
best policy in Columbus has been extended to January, and if crime
statistics are a measure, the extension is needed.
   ``Take an Honest Look,'' headed by Jeb Stuart Magruder, Watergate
conspirator-turned Presbyterian minister, was touted at its kickoff
in January as the first phase of a bid to raise consciousness and
discussion about ethics in daily life.
   Spokeswoman Carol McBurney of Zimmerman Public Relations said the
Columbus Commission on Ethics and Values voted Wednesday to extend
it until mid-January to allow several projects to be completed. One
project is a change in school curriculum to include lessons in
honesty.
   ``We will have some kind of a wrap-up event in January. We had to
set an ending date _ some people on the commission never want it to
end,'' she said.
   The extension also gives the panel time to determine how _ and if
_ it will be able to gauge the campaign's effectiveness.
   Magruder said an attempt will be made this fall in conjunction
with Ohio State University to determine public opinion on the isse.
   ``Honesty isn't something you can measure,'' he said. ``But you
can measure whether the message has been heard. Whether it sank in
is another question altogether.''
   But if crime statistics are any indication, the commission has
more work to do. Overall, the rate of felony crimes as of June was
up from last year, said Howard Wilson, city police crime prevention
coordinator.
   ``For the city of Columbus, the uniform crime index is up 8.2
percent in a comparison of January to June 1988 to the same period
in 1989,'' he said.
   Cases of murder and manslaughter are up 20.5 percent from last
year, vehicle thefts rose 28 percent and aggravated assaults were up
11.6 percent.
   However, the number of cases of forcible rape dropped by 24.9
percent, he said.
   Told about the increase in the crime rate, Ms. McBurney joked,
``Well, I guess we'd better not use those figures, then.''
   Magruder, deputy director of communications in the administration
of Richard Nixon and deputy director of Nixon's Committee to
Re-elect the President in 1972, went to prison after he admitted
destroying records and committing perjury in the Watergate scandal.
   He was ordained a Presbyterian minister in 1981 and now serves at
First Community Church in suburban Marble Cliff.
   Magruder said he is pleased with the dozens of tales he has
collected demonstrating individual acts of honesty.
   ``We had a woman return five bags of lottery tickets she found,
and someone returned $100 from an automatic teller machine at the
Columbus airport that wasn't his,'' he said. ``And a woman from Fort
Wayne, Ind., who stayed in a local hotel to attend a wedding left
behind an envelope with cash in it. She forgot about it until she
got home and was pleased and delighted to find out from the hotel
clerk that somebody turned it in.''
   The privately funded campaign has spread its word via billboards,
public service announcements on radio and television, and one public
forum. It also has sent information to schools to encourage teachers
to include honesty in lesson plans.
   The commission's next effort, which will begin sometime early in
the new year, will focus on respect and prejudice.

<TEXT>
   A pregnant woman was abducted off the street,
taken to an apartment and sexually assaulted by nine men and women
for six hours, police said Thursday.
   The attackers also beat and tore clumps of hair out of the
25-year-old victim, who is seven months pregnant, said Officer Clyde
Brandenburger. He said they used no weapons.
   The victim was treated for bruises at Jackson Park Hospital and
released, said nursing supervisor Edna Sistrunk. She said she
couldn't comment on the status of the pregnancy, but Detective Ray
McNally said he believes the fetus survived.
   ``She says she was raped six or seven times and forced to perform
other sexual acts during six hours,'' McNally said. ``This has
happened before, but never with so many people involved.''
   Three suspects _ William Patterson, 31, Courtney Hicks, 36, and
Diane Daniels, 30, all of Chicago _ were arrested and charged with
aggravated criminal sexual assault, McNally said. Police were
seeking six other people, three men and three women.
   Investigators don't believe illegal drugs were involved, McNally
said.
   The victim had been a few miles from her home, visiting her
sister, when two men grabbed her and dragged her into a nearby
apartment where Patterson lives, McNally said. He said she
apparently didn't know any of her attackers.
   After being repeatedly attacked, the victim was able to sneak
from the bathroom to a back door and escaped from a rear window of
the house, McNally said.
   The nude woman flagged down a police car and led officers to the
apartment, where the three suspects were taken into custody, he said.
   Police recovered her clothes at the scene, and about $30 in cash
she said had been stolen from her.

<HEAD>Aoun Says US `Biased and Short-Sighted' and Asks for Its Help</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Gen. Michel Aoun said Thursday that U.S.
foreign policy is ``biased and shortsighted,'' then asked American
help in what the Christian leader calls the war of liberation
against Syrian troops in Lebanon. Aoun said the U.S. withdrawal of
its last diplomats Wednesday was based on ``rumors, false
suppositions and unconvincing reasons.''
   He likened the 6-month-old battle between his 20,000 Christian
soldiers and a Moslem alliance led by the 40,000 Syrians to what
Americans' ``forefathers did ... 200 years ago'' in the
Revolutionary War.
   Syrians and Christians exchanged artillery fire for five hours
before dawn Thursday and police reported two dead and seven wounded.
At least 830 people have been killed and 2,462 wounded since the
artillery war began March 8. Nearly all the victims have been
civilians.
   The U.S.-trained general said he would welcome the return of
Ambassador John McCarthy and other American diplomats to Lebanon
only if Washington recognized his Christian Cabinet as the
legitimate government.
   His government competes for power with a Moslem Cabinet led by
acting Premier Salim Hoss. McCarthy, who had been in Lebanon since
the rival regimes were created a year ago, avoided taking sides by
not presenting his credentials to either.
   U.S. military helicopters evacuated the 30 remaining Americans
from the U.S. Embassy compound in east Beirut on Wednesday morning.
   ``It is pitiful that American-Lebanese relations should
deteriorate to that point due to the stubbornness of the American
Embassy ... backed by a biased and shortsighted foreign policy,''
Aoun said.
   He was clearly angered by the State Department's declaration
Wednesday that it evacuated the U.S. diplomats because Aoun
threatened to expose them to a ``good dose of Christian terrorism.''
   Speaking to reporters in his bunker under the shattered
presidential palace in Baabda, east of Beirut, the 54-year-old
Maronite Catholic general urged the ``American people and their
elected representatives to ignore their State Department's policy.''
   Americans should ``support all the Lebanese, Moslems and
Christians, in our war of liberation'' against the Syrians, he said.
   Syrian soldiers are in Lebanon under a peacekeeping mandate the
Arab League issued in 1976, the year after the sectarian civil war
began. At least 150,000 Lebanese have been killed in the war.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said Wednesday
that a leader of Christian youths who massed outside the embassy
before the evacuation told diplomats they could move in and out of
the compound only ``at their own risk.''
   Aoun said her remarks were ``a calculated but crude personal
attack on me.''
   ``It is an attack perhaps born of desperation rather than
exasperation at the continued Lebanese resistance, and based at best
on half truth, hearsay and downright black propaganda, at which we
all know the State Department excels,'' he told journalists.
   Ms. Tutwiler quoted Aoun as saying in an interview with the
French newspaper Figaro that ``perhaps he should take 20 American
hostages.''
   In the interview published Sept. 1, Aoun was asked whether the
United States was putting pressure on France not to aid him, and
replied in part:
   ``They put pressure on everyone and claim in addition to have so
acted because they have 10 hostages being held in Lebanon. As if the
war were being waged without hostages or victims. If I understand
well, it would be enough that tomorrow I take 20 Americans hostage
so that the United States stops putting pressure on my friends.''
   Eight Americans are among the 16 Western captives in Lebanon.
   After Aoun's news conference Thursday, Ms. Tutwiler repeated her
feeling about the remark to Figaro: ``I view it as a threat.''
   Aoun was not asked about it during the news conference.
   The general said he had assigned his ``best officers and
soldiers'' to protect the embassy and American diplomats. He said
the decision to evacuate them was ``unjustified ... because there
have never been any victims or any hostage-taking in this region at
all since the current events started.''
   His reference was to the 310-square-mile enclave north and east
of Beirut in which an estimated 1 million Christians live. It has
been sealed off by the Syrians and their Moslem allies.

<HEAD>Govs Will Press Bush to Rally for Education Changes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE GLOVER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's governors will prod
President Bush to be a cheerleader for changes in schools, but few
will seek more federal money when they meet him for an education
summit, the governors' leader says.
   ``Sure, they'd like to see more money in some areas, but I think
realistically they recognize that's not going to happen,'' said Iowa
Gov. Terry Branstad, a Republican who chairs the National Governors
Association.
   The governors will meet Bush on Sept. 27 and 28 in
Charlottesville, Va. Branstad said he's surveyed all 50 to develop a
list of priorities, which include drugs, improving support of
teachers, raising literacy rates, dealing with ``at-risk''
youngsters and restructuring schools.
   A few governors indicated they'll push for more money for college
loans for low-income students, but most understand that ``our best
hope is to try to get the administration to buy into giving the
states more flexibility,'' Branstad said in an interview this week.
   Instead, the governors will ask Bush to bring the visibility and
muscle of the White House to a year-long effort to develop a
national consensus for changes in education, Branstad said.
   ``He's the most visible person in the United States and if he
decides to make something an issue, it's going to be an issue,'' he
said. ``What we want to do is raise the visibility of education as a
national agenda item.''
   Branstad said the result could be the nation's first coordinated
response to ``A Nation at Risk,'' a report critical of American
education.
   ``We haven't really had a consensus response,'' Branstad said.
``We've had various experimentation and different things going on,
some which has worked, some of which hasn't.''
   Branstad said some education reform efforts have failed because
elected officials haven't worked to gain support.
   ``Governors and legislatures passed laws that said `we will have
better education.' It didn't work because it didn't get down to the
people in the classrooms,'' he said.
   Representatives of the governors and White House staffers are
negotiating over the summit's format. The meeting will have many
closed-door sessions, Branstad said.
   ``The president is interested in casual, candid and fruitful
discussions between himself and the governors,'' Bush aide Roger
Porter said in a memo. ``Therefore, there will be no outside
speakers and very limited staff.''

<HEAD>House Defense Bill `Totally Unacceptable'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush denounced a House-passed defense
bill as ``totally unacceptable to the commander in chief'' on
Thursday and accused the chamber of holding the defense budget
hostage to $20 billion in ``unneeded programs.''
   Bush, in a speech to the American Legion that mixed defense and
anti-drug themes, also praised Wednesday's decision by Colombian
president Virgilio Barco to extradite a major drug figure to the
United States.
   The extradition of Eduardo Martinez Romero to face U.S. drug
money-laundering charges ``sends a strong signal of the courage and
determination of President Barco and the Colombian government to
deal with the scourge which drugs are inflicting on all of us,''
Bush said.
   Declaring ``Remember Pearl Harbor,'' Bush also poked fun at his
1988 campaign gaffe _ to the same group one year ago _ confusing
Pearl Harbor Day.
   ``Today, surprisingly, is Sept. 7. Can you believe it? And I'm
determined not to repeat the mistake I made exactly one year ago
when I referred to this as Pearl Harbor Day.''
   A year ago, Bush, a World War II combat veteran, told the
American Legion convention in Louisville, Ky.: ``I wonder how many
Americans remember that today is Pearl Harbor Day.'' The Japanese
air attack on the U.S. naval base in Hawaii occurred Dec. 7, 1941.
   The president, moving from drugs to defense, said Americans
deserve protection from both ``the fear of war abroad (and) the fear
of drugs and crime at home.''
   But he claimed that the national defense was threatened by the
House version of a defense spending bill for the fiscal year that
begins Oct. 1. A House-Senate conference committee begins work on a
compromise version Friday.
   While suggesting he could live with the Senate-passed bill, which
preserves most of the administration's programs, Bush declared:
``The House version is totally unacceptable to the commander in
chief of the United States armed forces.''
   Congressional negotiators must reconcile rival versions of the
legislation to authorize $295 billion in Pentagon spending and $10
billion for defense programs in the Energy Department.
   The House refused to fully fund either of the two types of mobile
intercontinental ballistic missiles Bush wants. It chopped in half,
to $502 million from $1.1 billion, Bush's request for the rail-based
multiple-warhead MX; and it deleted all funds for the single-warhead
Midgetman.
   The House bill ``contains unneeded programs costing nearly $20
billion from 1990 to 1994, holding our defense budget hostage to
projects that will strip money from programs crucial to strategic
modernization,'' Bush said.
   ``Fellow veterans, real peace is not an accident, so let us
modernize our strategic forces and thus encourage arms control,''
Bush said.
   The president, a longtime American Legion member, wore a cap from
his home post _ Post 77 in Houston _ at the beginning and end of his
appearance, although removing it for the speech.
   On drugs, Bush said his $7.9 billion anti-drug package, unveiled
in a speech to the nation Tuesday, ``will require the bravery and
sacrifice that Americans have shown before and must again.''
   ``As veterans, you know how battles are often fought, house by
house, block by block. Well, we'll win this battle the same way.
We're going to win win it kid by kid, neighborhood by
neighborhood,'' he said.
   To critics of the plan, Bush said: ``Some, incredibly, say it's
not enough. This from the very people who oppose the death penalty.
It's that kind of thinking that's lost too many battles.
   ``So let's not let these critics lose the war,'' he added. ``I
ask you to support our crime plan and also the other parts of our
drug strategy.''
   Afterwards, Bush attended a ceremony at nearby Fort McHenry
marking the 175th anniversary of the War of 1812 battle against the
British that inspired Francis Scott Key to write ``The Star-Spangled
Banner.''
   Standing before a 90-foot white flagpole, Bush called the fort
``one of America's most hallowed shrines'' and said its small force
of soliders had ``stopped a British invasion and preserved our
independence.''
   While Bush used his appearance before the American Legion to
promote his drug plan and criticize the House's defense bill, one
Republican lawmaker suggested using money for the Pentagon's B-2
stealth bomber to fund the anti-drug effort.
   Rep. John G. Rowland of Connecticut said he will introduce
legislation next week to cancel all procurement money authorized by
the House for the stealth bomber in fiscal 1990 and transfer the
funds to Bush's anti-drug program.
   The House, in approving its version of the defense bill last
month, authorized procurement of two stealth bombers, which at a
cost of $530 million apiece are considered the most expensive planes
in history.

<HEAD>Four Ill, One Critically After Eating Poisonous Wild Mushrooms</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One man remained in critical condition
Thursday after he and three other people ate what experts described
as the deadliest species of wild mushroom.
   ``It's the worst outbreak of amanita mushroom poisoning in at
least 20 years,'' said Dr. Samuel Hall, medical director of the
Minnesota Poison Control Center.
   The victims ate the amanita phalloides in two incidents Friday,
one near Siren, Wis., and the other by Gull Lake north of Brainerd.
All were taken to St. Paul-Ramsey Medical Center.
   An unidentified 52-year-old man from Isanti was in critical
condition. He had picked mushrooms Friday evening near Siren and
cooked them into a creamed soup-like mixture that he shared with a
friend, Sandy Barton, 32, of Blaine. The man ate about two bowls of
the mushroom mixture; Barton ate just a little, and she was released
from the hospital Tuesday.
   Hall said the man had liver failure.
   Daniel Padrnos, 59, and his wife Yvonne, 52, who own the Gull
Lake Four Seasons Resort just north of Brainerd, were the other
victims. Padrnos was discharged from the hospital Wednesday; his
wife remained in the hospital and was improving steadily.
   The cases prompted health and plant experts to issue warnings
about eating mushrooms picked in the wild. Mushrooms have flourished
in the recent cool, wet weather and will be plentiful through early
October, said Neil Anderson, a plant pathologist at the University
of Minnesota.
   Only those who have been trained should pick mushrooms, Anderson
and Hall said. Amanita phalloides and its relatives resemble the
edible field mushroom.
   Padrnos said he had some doubts about the safety of the mushrooms
as he sliced them into a frying pan. ``They didn't seem just
right,'' he said. ``So I fried them for a long time, 15 minutes.
Dumb me, I didn't throw them out.''
   Padrnos said he and his wife scooped the fried mushrooms onto
pork chops and ate them.
   The last recorded amanita death in Minnesota occurred in 1960,
but there have been several non-fatal cases since then, Anderson
said.
   Amanita phalloides contain amatoxin, a deadly poison that keeps
recycling through the body, damaging the liver and sometimes the
kidneys. Hall said there is no antidote for the toxin.

<HEAD>Iraq Says Explosion Killed 19, Not Hundreds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Iraqi Embassy said Thursday that 19 people died
in an explosion at a fuel depot outside Baghdad, contradicting
reports by British media and Kurdish dissidents that at least 700
people died and that the site was a top-secret missile plant.
   The embassy said 19 firefighters and civil defense workers
fighting a fire at a depot containing ``highly flammable gasoline
materials'' were killed when a passing truck packed with explosives
detonated.
   In a statement, the embassy said all the casualties were Iraqi
nationals, and that a small number of workers suffered minor cuts
when the explosion shattered the windows of passing buses. The fire
was put out in a few hours, it said.
   The embassy said the truck was en route to a dam under
construction in northern Iraq and its explosives were ``for use in
engineering projects.''
   An official of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, an outlawed
Kurdish movement fighting the Baghdad government, quoted sources in
Iraq on Wednesday as saying 700 bodies had been recovered. The
official spoke on condition of anonymity.
   London's Independent newspaper, quoting unidentified diplomats
and Middle East sources, also reported at least 700 people were
killed, including Egyptian engineers helping the Iraqis develop a
new ballistic missile.
   The embassy denied that a modified version of Argentina's
medium-range Condor-2 surface-to-surface missile known as the
Badr-2000 was being developed ``between Iraq and any other country
including Argentina,'' as news reports had said.
   ``Iraq has already proved being self-sufficient in its
technological capabilities, and it has produced middle-range
missiles by developing a technology that is not yet available to
Argentina itself,'' the statement said.
   The embassy gave no further details about the facility between
Al-Hillah and Ad-Diwaniyeh, about 40 miles south of Baghdad, which
dissidents described as a top-secret missile plant. An embassy
employee who answered telephone calls said the embassy was closed
and no officials were available for comment.

<HEAD>Man Found in Culvert Never Gave Up Hope of Rescue</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A man who fell into an 8-foot-deep drainage
culvert lived there for a week without food, water or sleep but said
he never gave up hope he would survive.
   ``I prayed to God. You better believe I prayed to God,'' William
Logsdon, 56, said in a telephone interview from his hospital room.
``But I never thought I would die. I knew I would get out. I always
had hope.''
   Logsdon was rescued Wednesday after a man collecting aluminum
cans spotted him. He was in stable condition Thursday.
   Logsdon said he had been walking along U.S. 61 in his hometown of
Canton, in rural northeastern Missouri near the Illinois and Iowa
borders, on Aug. 30 or 31 when he moved to the shoulder of the road
to avoid a passing car and fell into the culvert.
   ``I laid back in there because I didn't have the strength or
energy to get up,'' he said. ``I was screaming for help but nobody
heard me, so I just sat there.''
   On Wednesday afternoon Canton resident Bob Miller spotted Logsdon
as he roamed the area collecting aluminum cans. Miller called police
and an ambulance.
   One of the first officers on the scene, state Trooper Ernest
Schroeder, ``It was a miracle he was in such good condition.''
   ``I have no doubt in my mind he was there for a week,'' Schroeder
said.
   He said Logsdon, who has limited use of one arm and walks with a
limp, is well-known in the community, and someone saw him the day he
disappeared carrying yellow bags that were with him when he was
rescued.
   Logsdon, who suffers epileptic seizures and lives with his
brother and sister-in-law, also was in the habit of telling his
family where he was going and when he would return home. It wasn't
clear whether a seizure contributed to his entrapment.
   Logsdon also missed a dental appointment Sept. 1, and ``he would
never miss a dental appointment,'' Schroeder said. Logsdon's
sister-in-law filed a missing-person report that day.
   Authorities had searched extensively for him using helicopters
and a ground sweep during the week.
   Dr. Robert Prosser, director of Emergency Services at the
University of Kansas Medical Center, said the weather conditions
helped Logsdon survive.
   ``It was hot and humid and he was probably sheltered by the
culvert and able to retain some water,'' Prosser said. ``Certainly,
going without food is not unusual at all.''

<TEXT>
   The State Department estimated Thursday that up
to 250,000 Soviet citizens will apply for admission to the United
States in 1990.
   ``We are seeking ways to fairly and equitably respond to the
expansion in demand,'' spokeswoman Margaret D. Tutwiler said.
   About half the applicants are Jews. Armenians comprise another
large category, as do Pentecostal Christians.
   The spokeswoman denied published reports that because of the
heavy flow some Soviet Jews would be declared ineligible. This would
have the effect of diverting many of them to Israel.
   The United States was instrumental in persuading the Soviet Union
to lower is immigration barriers. The rising exodus is a mark of
success, Ms. Tutwiler said, and ``we welcome it.''
   Most Jews who leave the Soviet Union have permits to go to
Israel. But the vast majority opt for the United States once they
reach Vienna.
   A U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
U.S. Embassy in Moscow was receiving 10,000 applications a month
from Soviet Jews for admission into the United States. Another
10,000 a month were applying through the Dutch Embassy for
emigration to Israel, he said.
   ``The rate is going straight up,'' he said.
   The Bush administration is pondering how to handle the situation,
with a decision expected within a week or two.
   ``The administration is definitely not proposing to bar Soviet
Jews from emigrating to the United States,'' Ms. Tutwiler said. ``We
are not propsoing rules to make any Soviet Jews ineligible.''
   Known to be under consideration is the addition of dozens of U.S.
workers to the U.S. Embassy in Moscow to handle the applications.
   The State Department also is considering a six-month waiiting
period for Soviet Jews who do not have close relatives in the United
States.
   ``We are seeking ways to fairly and equitably respond to the
explosion in demand because of our successful efforts in pressing
the Soviets to open emigration,`` Ms. Tutwiler said.
   She estimated that applications will be received from up to
100,000 Soviet nationals in the fiscal year that ends Sept. 30.
   ``In fiscal year 1990,'' she said, ``we expect that the number of
Soviet applicants could increase to around a quarter of a million.''

<HEAD>West German Diplomatic Offensive Fails to Break Impasse Over Refugees</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROL J. WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government accused East Germany on
Thursday of trying to disrupt talks on the fate of 6,500 East German
refugees awaiting passage to the West.
   West Germany launched a diplomatic offensive in Bonn, East Berlin
and Prague, but the flurry of high-level talks failed to break an
impasse on the refugees.
   More than 6,000 East Germans frustrated with the lack of reform
under East Berlin's rigid Communist leadership have escaped to West
Germany through Hungary in recent weeks.
   Another 6,000 are huddled in Hungarian tent cities and nearly 500
are in Bonn's missions in Eastern Europe demanding the right to
emigrate to West Germany.
   Hungary promised a week ago it would not force any East Germans
to return home. West German politicians said the Hungarians had
agreed to allow the refugees to migrate to West Germany.
   However, Hungary has since refused to authorize the refugees'
departure, calling on East Germany and West Germany to work out a
solution.
   Czechoslovakia has taken the same view, the Bonn Foreign Ministry
indicated in a statement released late Thursday.
   It said Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher had dispatched a
senior envoy, Dieter Kastrup, to meet with Czechoslovak Foreign
Minister Jaromir Johanes to discuss the East Germans crowding Bonn's
embassy there.
   Johanes said the refugees' fate depended on an agreement between
Bonn and East Berlin.
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl's chief of staff, Rudolf Seiters, met with
East Germany's top diplomat here, Horst Neubauer, but a statement
issued by Bonn indicated the talks made little if any headway.
   ``The recent public comments from the East German side can only
be seen as an attempt to disturb the negotiations and to shift
responsibility elsewhere for resolving the problem,'' the government
statement said.
   East Germany's ambassador to Hungary, Gerd Vehres, held a press
conference for Hungarian reporters and restated East Berlin's
promise that those who return voluntarily will not be punished.
   Vehres denied East Germany demanded the refugees be forcibly
returned but again characterized West Germany's decision to give
them shelter as interference in domestic affairs.
   Hungarian government spokesman Zsolt Bajnok told reporters ``a
few days are still required'' before the East Germans can be
released, but he refuse to be more specific.
   There also were talks in East Berlin on Thursday between
officials of the East German Foreign Ministry and Bonn's
representative to East Germany, Franz Bertele. West Germany does not
recognize East German sovereignty, and therefore does not send an
ambassador there.
   Both sides agreed to keep the East Berlin talks confidential.
   According to the West German government statement, Seiters told
Neubauer that Bonn ``expressly rejected'' an accusation by the
official East German news agency, ADN, claiming Bonn had reneged on
a deal to clear out the 116 refugees from the West German mission in
East Berlin.
   Seiters reaffirmed that Bonn will not force anyone to leave the
mission's protection, the statement said.
   Hungary, a Warsaw Pact member that is seeking closer Western
ties, has been caught in the middle of the diplomatic dispute,
because its decision last spring to dismantle border barriers with
Austria unwittingly provided a new escape route for East Germans.
   While East Germans face numerous obstacles to travel West, they
can usually obtain permission to visit neighboring Hungary.
   The 6,000 being cared for in Hungary by international aid workers
were mostly vacationers who decided against returning home after
word spread that a one-time caravan to West Germany would be
authorized by the Hungarian government.
   Many of those at the West German mission in Prague were caught
trying to cross illegally between Czechoslovakia and Hungary and
appealed to the West Germans out of fear they would be punished if
they went back to East Germany.

   The family of Joan Whitney Payson, which sold
Vincent van Gogh's ``Irises'' two years ago for $53.9 million, hopes
to fetch a similar price on Nov. 15 for an early Picasso
self-portrait.
   Sotheby's said Thursday that ``Au Lapin Agile,'' named after a
tavern frequented by the artist, has been consigned by Mrs. Payson's
daughter, Linda de Roulet, who kept the Picasso in her home in
Manhasset, on Long Island.
   She inherited it from her mother, a philanthropist, co-owner of a
racing stariod are in museums;
this one appeared briefly in 1980 at the National Museum of Western
Art in Tokyo, said David Nash, senior vice president of fine arts
for Sotheby's New York.
   Picasso, then 25, painted the unsigned work in 1905 as a gift to
Frederic Gerard, the tavern owner, who appears in the background,
strumming a guitar. ``Maybe Picasso gave it in exchange for a few
drinks _ who knows?'' said Nash.
   Mrs. Payson acquired it in 1952. ``This magnificent painting was
in our parents' home in Manhasset for 27 years and, for a time, hung
near van Gogh's `Irises,''' Mrs. de Roulet said in a statement.
   Her brother said in an interview that Mrs. de Roulet also
displayed ``Au Lapin Agile'' prominently. But she became ``a bit
nervous having the painting in her house'' because of the prices
commanded by ``Irises'' and ``Yo Picasso,'' a 1901 self-portrait,
sold for $47.8 million on May 9.
   The real clincher, said Payson, was in December, when Mrs. de
Roulet discovered her grandsons playing with a dartboard near the
Picasso.
   ``That seemed to be some kind of an omen,'' said Payson.
   Nash said it's difficult to set a presale estimate because of the
unpredictable art market.
   ``This is much larger than `Yo Picasso.' It is a much more
complex painting, with considerable psychological tensions,'' he
said. ``In a logical world, it should lead to a higher price.''
   Part of the sale proceeds will be used to establish a foundation
for medical research and education.

<HEAD>Cocaine Shipments Dry Up in Wake of Colombia Violence</HEAD>

   The flood of drugs into the United States has dried
up since Colombia's latest round of violence began, raising the
price of cocaine and shrinking the size of crack rocks, authorities
said Thursday.
   But they warn the sudden drop in trafficking may be temporary,
and could simply be the work of middlemen trying to drive up the
price.
   The Miami-based Seventh Coast Guard District, which has accounted
for 97 percent of the more than 10,000 pounds of cocaine intercepted
by the entire service this year, has seen import activity suddenly
grind to a halt, said Lt. Cmdr Jeff Karonis.
   ``We're still carrying out the same operations as we were, but
the boats aren't coming out, and the air drops aren't happening _
the targets just aren't there.''
   Pat O'Brien, outgoing head of the U.S. Customs Service in Miami,
said agents from his district, by far the busiest in the nation, had
been tracking three to five air drops a week prior to the Colombian
crackdown.
   ``That has now come to a standstill,'' he said. ``There was only
one right after the violence started, and we weren't even able to
confirm that.''
   The only recent major cocaine haul _ 800 pounds on a freighter in
Tampa on Saturday _ had been loaded and shipped before the violence
began.
   Undercover agents trying to make cocaine buys have been put off
for two to three weeks, and even though that period is about up,
there are still no shipments ready, he said. The summer months have
traditionally been the traffickers' busiest.
   In addition, money-laundering activity tracked by Customs is
sputtering _ traffickers are still moving wire transfers for old
cocaine shipments, but there are few new payments.
   The Drug Enforcement Administration has also spotted the change,
but agents there aren't sure if it marks a true disruption.
   ``Yes, there appears to be a slowdown of drug activity out of
South America, a fluctuation in distribution, and a rise in the
wholesale price of cocaine,'' said Miami DEA spokesman John
Fernandes. ``But we don't know if that's because of what's happening
in Colombia, or if entrepreneurs are trying to take advantage of
what's happening to raise the price.''
   Fernandes said the price of large cocaine shipments in the last
two weeks has increased from $11,000-$15,000 a kilogram to
$18,000-$19,000, with individual kilogram sales reaching as high as
$23,000.
   The scarcity is being felt on the street as well, says Metro-Dade
police Cmdr. Steve Rothlein, head of the county narcotics bureau.
Street prices for a kilogram of cocaine have shot up about $7,000,
he said.
   ``Crack, on the other hand continues to sell for $10 dollar a
rock _ but some of the rocks are getting smaller,'' said Rothlein.
   O'Brien attributes the disruption in part to the confiscation of
planes used to carry cocaine from processing plants in southern
Colombia to coastal staging areas.
   The heads of the cartels are also having difficulties trying to
control their operations while on the run, he said. But how long the
situation lasts depends on whether the Colombian government can keep
up the pressure.
   Fernandes warns that the cocaine business is cyclical, just like
any other commodity operation.
   ``There have been slowdowns before,'' he said. ``Slowdowns at
different intervals ... are normal for the narcotics-trafficking
business.''
   He said other traffickers wait in the wings to replace anyone
arrested or extradited, and planes and boats can be bought again
quickly when the pressure is off.

<HEAD>Star Co. Studies Whether to Merge</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Kansas City Star Co. said it has
begun a study to determine whether the morning and evening
newspapers should be merged.
   Publisher James H. Hale said in a letter to employees Thursday
that no decision has been reached and no deadline set for deciding
whether to merge the The Kansas City Star with The Kansas City
Times. The study began several weeks ago.
   ``For years there have been consistent rumors that publication of
the afternoon paper would cease,'' the notice said. ``These rumors
have been unsettling to our employees, readers and advertisers. The
time has come to provide a definitive answer.''
   The Star publishes weekday afternoons and Sunday morning. The
Times publishes Monday through Saturday morning.
   The Star reported Thursday that some employees speculated after
the letter was posted that the study would concern itself with ways
to accomplish a merger rather than to determine the viability of The
Star. Hale said that speculation was false.
   Hale, who became publisher in 1977 shortly after the company was
acquired by Capital Cities Communications Inc., said one of the
first questions he was asked was how long Capital Cities would
continue to publish the afternoon newspaper. He said Thursday that
he did not have the answer then and does not have the answer now.
The study will determine that, he said.
   ``I always said I didn't want to be here when that happened,''
Hale said. ``Nobody wants to preside over the death of a great
newspaper, especially me.''
   According to the 1989 edition of the Editor &amp; Publisher Yearbook,
the Times has a daily circulation of 281,886. The Star's circulation
was listed at 184,882 daily and 408,916 on Sundays.

<TEXT>
   An abortion-rights coalition of women's groups
and religious, labor, business and advocacy organizations on
Thursday announced plans for rallies in the nation's capital and in
cities across the country this fall to kick off a nationwide
political organizing effort.
   Under the banner ``Mobilize for Women's Lives,'' the groups said
they will use the Nov. 12 rallies and other events in the states to
register supporters to vote, to enlist their help in political
organizing and to boost the campaigns of abortion-rights candidates.
   ``We will make it the political issue of 1989, 1990, 1992, and we
will change the legislative halls of this country so that we have
pro-choice legislators everywhere in the majority,'' said Molly
Yard, president of the National Organization for Women.
   Organizers said the coalition was formed before the Supreme
Court's July 3 decision giving states broad powers to regulate
abortions. NOW had wanted to stage a Washington rally this fall to
protest the court ruling, but other groups wanted more state and
community involvement in the demonstration.
   Abortion-rights groups brought hundreds of thousands of people to
the nation's capital in April for one of the largest marches in
recent years in the capital and the largest abortion-rights
demonstration ever. Police estimated the crowd at 300,000;
organizers said their numbers reached 600,000.
   Coalition leaders declined to estimate how many people they
believe will participate in the Nov. 12 events, but Yard said she
expected it would be in the millions.
   Organizers said the Washington rally is intended to demonstrate
the unity and strength of the movement, while the events in the
states will be designed to recruit volunteers for political
campaigning and abortion-rights education efforts.
   ``This will mark the 51-week countdown to the 1990 elections,''
said Kate Michelman, executive director of the National Abortion
Rights Action League.
   The groups will be signing up volunteers to ring doorbells, raise
money, write letters and get out the vote at election time in their
state and community, organizers said.
   Among the groups in the coalition are the American Civil
Liberties Union, American Jewish Congress, Americans for Religious
Liberty, Catholics for a Free Choice, Coalition of Labor Union
Women, National Black Women's Health Project, National Federation of
Business and Professional Women's Clubs, People for the American
Way, Planned Parenthood Federation of America, Physicians for
Reproductive Health, Women's Legal Defense Fund and YWCA of the USA.

<HEAD>Eds: New thruout to add denials from Israel, Norway and lawyer. CORRECTS

<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A national newspaper said Thursday that
a nine-nation spy swap is being negotiated by the East German lawyer
who arranged the 1986 release of Soviet dissident Natan Sharansky.
   The Bonn-based daily Die Welt gave no source for its information
but said lawyer Wolfgang Vogel was on a secret mission to Israel
over the weekend to work out the deal.
   Die Welt said the mass release of convicted spies would likely
free two agents from Israel convicted of spying for the KGB, as well
as prisoners in the Soviet Union, the United States, East Germany,
Britain, South Africa, Norway, Iraq and West Germany.
   West German government sources refused comment on the newspaper
report, which said the spy swap was planned some time in the fall.
In Washington, the State Department also refused comment.
   Israel and Norway denied the report.
   Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said: ``From time to time
there are articles like this. It is certain that we are interested
in exchanges of prisoners and hostages, but we have no information
on what was printed. No one has spoken to us on this and Israel was
not involved in this story.''
   Arne Strand, a spokesman for Norwegian Prime Minister Gro Harlem
Brundtland, said ``The government is completely unaware of any such
spy swap.'' Die Welt said Vogel refused to discuss the reported deal
when asked by the newspaper for details.
   The 63-year-old East Berlin lawyer has arranged other spy swaps
in the past, including the 1986 exchange that allowed Sharansky to
emigrate to Israel.
   The newspaper said Shabtai Kalmanovich, sentenced to nine years
in an Israeli prison for his conviction of spying for the Soviet
KGB, was one of the prisoners being considered for release. It also
named a Professor Glinberg, without giving his first name, who Die
Welt said was an expert on chemical warfare. The man referred to is
believed to be Marcus Klingberg, sentenced in 1983 to 18 years
imprisonment in Israel for spying for the Soviets.
   Die Welt said the Soviets were also seeking the release of Dieter
and Ruth Gerhardt from South Africa. Dieter Gerhardt, a former
admiral, is serving a life sentence while his Swiss-born wife is
serving a 10-year term. They were arrested in 1981, the paper said.
   Norway is involved through the case of former government official
Arne Treholt, who was convicted of spying for the Soviet Union and
Iraq and sentenced to 20 years in jail, the newspaper said. He was
arrested in 1984.
   But Treholt's lawyer, Arne Haugestad, ridiculed the report.
``This is nothing but a cock-and-bull story,'' NTB state news agency
quoted Haugestad as saying.
   East Germany's secret service was hoping to win the release of
Reinhard and Sonja Schulze, a couple arrested in Britain, according
to Die Welt.
   The East Germans also reportedly wanted the release of an agent
captured in West Germany and were in return ready to release a
number of Western agents caught in East Germany, Die Welt said.
   Die Welt did not specify any agents convicted in the United
States or U.S. agents serving sentences abroad.

   A sign-language interpreter was allowed to work
on the Senate floor for the first time Thursday, translating the
debate on proposed legislation to protect the disabled.
   Jean Lindquist, an employee of Gallaudet University for the deaf,
sat at the side of the presiding officer's podium while senators
debated amendments to the Americans With Disabilities Act.
   Ms. Lindquist was later relieved by Mary Owens, of the Senate
Special Services section of the Sergeant-at-Arms office. Other
interpreters were to take turns as well.
   Their interpretation could be seen from the gallery and on the
C-Span television service, which broadcasts Senate proceedings.
   The legislation would guarantee a full range of employment and
equal access rights to the nation's 43 million disabled. The bill
contains a provision guaranteeing special telephone service for the
hearing and speech impaired.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, obtained
unanimous consent from fellow senators to allow the interpreters on
the floor.

   Hispanic immigrants register to vote at a
significantly higher rate than most Americans and are ``almost up
for grabs'' by both Republicans and Democrats because many have not
decided which party they favor, a Latino group said in announcing
results of a survey Thursday.
   The telephone survey of 1,635 immigrants from 17 nations showed
that 81 percent of the naturalized immigrants are registered to
vote, compared with 70 percent of the general U.S. voting age
population, the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed
Officials said.
   Forty-nine percent of those interviewed, all of whom were either
naturalized citizens or legal permanent residents of the United
States, said they had ``no preference'' between the major U.S.
political parties.
   ``This is a large population that is almost up for grabs,'' said
Rep. Edward Roybal, D-Calif., president of the association's
educational fund, which conducted the survey.
   ``Republicans and Democrats have an open field to go out into the
Latin community and convince them that their party and platform is
the best,'' said Roybal, a Hispanic from a Los Angeles district with
the heaviest concentration of Hispanics in his state.
   He said the Southwest, and California in particular, ``will have
a vast reservoir of people who haven't made their minds up yet, but
they do register.''
   ``Despite the myths of the past, they will be registering in high
numbers and will be getting out to the polls in high numbers,''
Roybal said.
   The study gave no overall figure on the number of Hispanic
immigrants in the United States, but said more than one-and-a-half
million have legally entered the country in the past decade and they
will soon be the largest ethnic minority in the country.
   A study in April by the Center for Political Studies at the
University of Michigan showed that among Hispanic citizens who had
made a choice, 63 percent of Cubans considered themselves
Republicans, 9 percent Democrats, 13 percent independents and 16
percent no preference.
   The corresponding figures for Mexican immigrants were 42 percent
Democrat, 16 percent Republican, 10 percent independent and 33
percent no preference. For immigrants from other Latin American
countries, the figures were 34 percent Democrat, 28 percent
Republican, 10 percent independent and 27 percent no preference.
   The numbers don't add up to exactly 100 percent because of
rounding.
   Twenty-seven per cent said they had attended political
fund-raisers or contributed money, 9 percent had written letters on
political issues and an equal percentage had taken part in
canvassing or marching. Five percent said they had distributed
political literature and 4 percent said they had helped people
register or vote.
   Roybal said he believed the survey indicates that more Hispanics
will be elected to office ``in years to come, perhaps after the year
2000.''
   He said political participation by Hispanics would give them
leverage to help prevent state legislatures from drawing
congressional district lines, after the 1990 census, that are
``gerrymandered to keep them out.''
   Results of the survey are particularly important ``because this
is a group that many believe will not be fully counted in the next
census,'' Roybal said.
   The survey also showed that 95 percent of those responding said
an important reason for wanting to become a U.S. citizen is that it
allows you to vote.
   The survey was conducted in California, Texas, Florida, New York,
New Jersey, Illinois, Arizona and Maryland. Nearly half of those
interviewed were from Mexico and one-fourth from Cuba. The principal
other countries of origin included the Dominican Republic, Colombia,
El Salvador and Ecuador.
   The association claims a membership of more than 3,300 Hispanic
elected officials, appointed officials and community and business
leaders. It did not give a margin of error for its survey.

<HEAD>Iraqis Ready To Swap POWs Unconditionally</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A top Iraqi official said Thursday his
country is ready for a comprehensive, unconditional exchange of
prisoners-of-war with Iran.
   A former Iranian official still close to the government declared
there has never been a better time for reaching a full peace
settlement with Iraq.
   Speaking at the summit of the non-aligned movement in Belgrade,
Yugoslavia, Iraqi Deputy Premier Taha Yassin Ramadan said his
country was prepared for a full exchange of all POWs with Iran,
regardless of the lack of progress on other issues in the peace
talks.
   His remarks were carried by the Iraqi News Agency, monitored in
Nicosia.
   Talks on implementing U.N. Resolution 598, which halted the war
Aug. 20, 1988, began five days after the cease-fire. But the talks
stalled almost immediately and have been deadlocked since. The last
round of talks, held in Geneva in April, broke down in an
acrimonious stalemate.
   The deadlocked peace talks have left an estimated 100,000 men
held by both sides languishing in POW camps.
   The Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in Nicosia, quoted
Mohammad Javad Larijani, a former deputy foreign minister close to
newly elected President Hashemi Rafsanjani, as writing that ``There
has never been such a good chance of attaining peace as there is
now. One should appreciate such chances.''
   Larijani, whose remarks quoted by IRNA were carried in the daily
Ettelaat, said that was partly because the Iraqis were desperate to
rebuild their war-shattered economy.
   No new peace talks between Iran and Iraq are scheduled.
   The Iraqis insist on direct talks with the Iranians without U.N.
mediation, but Iran has refused.
   After the last round of talks broke down, the Iraqis proposed
exchanging POWs. The Iranians refused, insisting that the full U.N.
peace resolution must be implemented step by step.
   The resolution calls for withdrawal of troops to internationally
recognized boundaries, the exchange of POWs, and dredging of the
Shatt-Al-Arab waterway, which is shared by both sides according to a
1975 agreement but which is cluttered with war debris.
   The talks have been stalled over Iran's insistence that Iraqi
troops withdraw from some 385 square miles of its territory before
the talks can continue.
   But the Iraqis reject the 1975 Algiers Treaty which drew the
border in the middle of the Shatt-Al-Arab. They insist that the
border must be redrawn along the Iranian bank of the Shatt to
include all of the waterway in Iraqi territory.

   Hundreds of bats descended on downtown
in daylight, many dying on streets and sidewalks, and officials are
not sure why.
   ``I have never seen bats on the sidewalk at 4 o'clock in the
afternoon before,'' said Chris Farkas, who estimated there were 50
to 100 bats on the ground outside his restaurant just before the
Wednesday evening rush hour.
   Jeff Derosa of the Humane Society of North Texas found 100 more
bats on a sidewalk nearby and said at least 1,000 were hanging from
the eaves of a building.
   Another Humane Society official, Lynn Buffington, said Thursday
that no one was sure whether the bats had been poisoned or suffered
heat stroke. The temperature reached 96 degrees Wednesday afternoon.
   ``My concern was that we got this call at 4:15 yesterday and most
of the employees in these downtown buildings would be coming out and
there would be these tiny little things on the ground,'' Ms.
Buffington said. ``I was concerned about a health problem.''
   Bats become disoriented in daylight, but if they are not too sick
they probably could regroup after nightfall, said Dudley Brown,
assistant director of the Fort Worth Zoo.
   The Humane Society had received no reports of bats downtown
Thursday morning, Ms. Buffington said.

   Alexander Dubcek, Czechoslovakia's leader
when the nation embraced its ill-fated reforms of 1968, has for the
first time signed a document criticizing the government, a human
rights organization said Thursday.
   Dubcek and 32 other Slovaks signed an appeal to President Gustav
Husak, the man who succeeded Dubcek as leader of the Communist Party
in 1969, to drop charges against two Slovak dissidents arrested Aug.
14, the Vienna-based International Helsinki Federation said.
   The two men, Jan Carnogursky and Miroslav Kusy, originally were
charged with incitement, but the charge was later changed to the
more serious offense of activity against the state, which carries a
penalty of three to 10 years in prison, the Helsinki Federation said
in a statement.
   Carnogursky and Kusy were among four people who signed an appeal
to Slovaks to lay flowers at public monuments on Aug. 21 in memory
of those killed when Soviet-led Warsaw Pact tanks invaded in 1968 to
crush the reforms led by Dubcek.
   No date was given of the signing of the appeal by the former
Communist Party leader, who has lived in Bratislava since he was
expelled from the party in June 1970.

<HEAD>Attackers Fire Rockets Into Israel From Jordan</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Attackers fired several rockets Thursday from
Jordan into Israel, and a news report said a PLO faction claimed
responsibility. The government demanded that Jordan do a better job
of policing its border.
   There were no casualties in the attacks, but Israelis living
along the border expressed concern that the generally quiet boundary
might be changing into a line of confrontation.
   Jordanian officials said at least one rocket fell on their side
of the border and that they were checking the source of the firing.
   Israel radio reported that a Syrian-backed Marxist faction of the
PLO, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, claimed
responsibility for the attack in a statement released to Radio Monte
Carlo.
   ``We still do not think that Jordan's policy of ensuring the
security and quiet of the border between us has changed,'' Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir said on Israeli television's Arabic language
service. ``But all the incidents that have occured lately require
caution and alertness.''
   When asked what Jordan should do following the raid, Shamir said:
``First of all, they must prevent this. This is their
responsibility.''
   Foreign Minister Moshe Arens echoed Shamir's comments in an
interview on Israel television.
   ``It is certain that the Jordanian government is responsible for
every terrorist act whose source is Jordanian territory,'' Arens
said. ``We are asking the government of Jordan to take action ... to
prevent such acts in the future.''
   Shamir said the attack could be the result of recent Jordanian
moves at a rapprochement with the PLO.
   ``It could be that as a result of some improvement in ties
between the government of Jordan and the PLO, the PLO men were given
more freedom to act in Jordan and this (attack) could be the
result,'' Shamir said.
   The rocket attack was the second incident in a week and the fifth
this year across a normally quiet border.
   The other attack was Saturday when an infiltrator shot and killed
one Israeli soldier and fatally wounded another.
   Israeli newspapers have reported that the army asked farmers who
live along the border to carry weapons when they go to their fields.
   Menachem Regev, secretary of a collective farm near where the
rockets fell, said on army radio there was concern about the growing
number of incidents, which were the most frequent since a four year
war of attrition that started in 1969.
   ``It's like we're returning to the situation of 20 years ago,''
Regev said.
   Jordan does not permit cross border attacks and expelled
Palestinian guerrillas in a 1970-71 civil war, sharply reducing such
attempts.
   But some radical Syrian-based Palestinian groups have
occassionally tried to use Jordan as a launching pad for raids.

   The government said Thursday that a
visit by Romania's defense minister has been canceled, an apparent
result of the deteriorating relations between the Warsaw Pact allies.
   ``Ilie Ceausescu, Romanian deputy minister of national defense,
is not to visit Hungary, in spite of preliminary plans,'' the
official MTI news agency quoted Hungarian Defense Minister Col. Gen.
Ferenc Karpati as saying.
   Ceausescu is the brother of Romanian leader Nicolae Ceausescu.
   MTI did not say which nation canceled the visit. A date for it
was never announced. Hungarian officials had been criticized for
weeks over the planned visit.
   Reporting on the cancellation, the government daily Magyar Hirlap
said Karpati told reporters that ``Hungarian youth is opposed to the
visit of the Romanian general.''
   The Warsaw Pact countries are seriously split over the plight of
1.7 million ethnic Hungarians in Romania.
   Romania claims no wrongdoing, but Hungary says Romanian citizens
face discrimination and has given 18,000 of them asylum during the
past two years. The actions flout an agreement obliging Hungary to
return Romanian citizens fleeing over the countries' border.
   The two nations also have disputed control of Transylvania, which
is under control of Romania.
   The bitterness between the Soviet bloc countries also stems from
changing politics.
   Under Ceausescu's undisputed one-man leadership, Romania's
Communist Party prohibits dissent. Hungary, meanwhile, has moved
toward reform and next year plans to hold the nation's first free
elections since the Communists consolidated power more than 40 years
ago.
   Ilie Ceausescu's planned visit first was announced in the July 14
issue of Nephadsereg, Hungary's military weekly.
   Hungary's fledgling political opposition parties and some senior
Communist officials immediatey criticized the plan.
   Central Committee member Matyas Szueros, the speaker of
Parliament, said he found it ``incomprehensible.'' He accused the
Romanian leadership of an ``official political campaign'' to
persecute the Hungarian minority and said bilateral relationships
had ``hit bottom.''
   He also called Ceausescu's leadership an example of ``degenerate
socialism,'' and called for Transylvanian autonomy.
   Tensions even have caused senior Hungarian officials to express
concern about Romania's defense policies.
   Foreign Minister Gyula Horn told reporters in July it would be
``irresponsible'' to ignore signals from Romania, referring to
claims by Bucharest that it was capable of manufacturing nuclear
weapons and was thinking of acquiring mid-range missiles.

   The reputed financial wizard of the Medellin
cocaine cartel arrived under guard at a tiny, out-of-way airport
before sunrise Thursday, the first of Colombia's ``Extraditables''
brought to the United States for trial.
   The extradition of Eduardo Martinez Romero, an alleged
money-launderer for the drug cartel that is believed to supply 80
percent of America's cocaine, came days after President Bush
declared war on Latin America's cocaine barons.
   Martinez, 36, was put on a Drug Enforcement Administration plane
in Bogota on Wednesday night. He arrived at 4 a.m. outside Atlanta
at Charlie Brown Airport, an airfield used mostly by private planes,
and was whisked to court by helicopter.
   Hours later, after the government obtained an interpreter for
him, he appeared before U.S. Magistrate Joel M. Feldman and told him
he speaks only Spanish and does not fully comprehend the
money-laundering charges against him.
   Feldman postponed arraignment until Monday and ordered Martinez
held without bail at an undisclosed site. Defense attorney Ed
Garland said even he had not been told where Martinez was being held.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Wilmer Parker III said he will ask that
bail be denied.
   Security at the courthouse was unremarkable, despite the wave of
bombings associated with Colombia's crackdown on drugs, which
resulted in Martinez's arrest Aug. 20. Martinez was not handcuffed
or shackled in court.
   The Medellin cartel's reputed money man is on the United States'
list of so-called ``Extraditables,'' Colombia's most important drug
kingpins.
   Martinez, who told the judge he holds a post-graduate degree is
marketing, is accused of laundering up to $27 million in drug
profits by funneling the cash through U.S. banks, including one in
Atlanta.
   He is the first person extradited to the United States since
Colombia's crackdown began last month.
   Martinez has previously denied any links to the Medellin cartel,
which the government claims is the largest cocaine operation in the
world.
   ``Based on what I heard today I would anticipate he will enter a
plea of not guilty,'' said Garland. The Atlanta lawyer said he was
contacted by a member of Martinez's family.
   Martinez was indicted in March in Atlanta as a result of an
investigation code-named Operation Polar Cap, which officials said
revealed an operation that laundered billions in cocaine profits.
Charges were brought against 127 people and two Latin American banks.
   In March, U.S. authorities enlisted the aid of Gen. Manuel
Noriega's military to help arrest Martinez while he was inside a
bank Panama City. But Martinez slipped through the dragnet,
according to the DEA.
   He was arrested in Colombia the first weekend after Colombian
President Virgilio Barco launched a drug crackdown prompted by the
Aug. 18 assassination of a presidential candidate and outspoken foe
of the drug trade.
   Included in the emergency measures imposed by Barco was a
re-institution of the extradition agreement with the United States
that had been thrown out by the Colombian Supreme Court in 1987.
   In response to the crackdown, the cocaine barons declared ``total
war'' on the government and have carried out bombings and shootings
in Medellin, home of the drug cartel, and in Bogota, the capital.
   Weldon Kennedy, the agent in charge of the Atlanta FBI office,
said federal agents were ``on an increased state of alert'' against
any retaliation. Federal officials would provide no details on the
alert.
   ``We're very concerned because of the events transpiring and
because of the violence that has occurred in Colombia,'' Kennedy
said.
   He said some cartel members reportedly have said ``there might be
... some violent act attempted in the United States because of the
extradition.''
   The last trafficker to be extradited to the United States was
Carlos Lehder, a leader of the Medellin cartel who was sent to the
United States in early 1987 and is serving a life sentence in the
federal prison in Marion, Ill.
   Garland told reporters after the hearing that President Bush's
speech Tuesday outlining a battle plan for a war on drugs may whip
public opinion into such a frenzy that Martinez cannot get a fair
trial.
   ``The speech probably expressed accurately the feeling of the
American people,'' said Garland. ``My concern is that in our
frustration over the drug problem, we will ignore our other
freedoms. He, like anyone else in our country, should be presumed
innocent.''

   Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak ended a
diplomatic mission to Senegal and neighboring Mauritania on Thursday
and promised further efforts to resolve the bloody ethnic and racial
dispute between the countries.
   Mubarak, acting in his role as president of the Organization for
African Unity, said before leaving the Senegalese capital for
Algeria that a panel of OAU ministers would meet Oct. 5 at the
United Nations to study the problems causing the conflict.
   An initially minor border dispute between the two West African
nations in April has erupted into an ethnic and racial dispute
between the predominantly black, French-speaking Senegalese and the
mostly Arabic-speaking Moors of Mauritania.
   The conflict has left hundreds of Mauritanians and Senegalese
dead in each other's countries and thousands more without homes or
property.
   Senegal and Mauritania broke diplomatic relations Aug. 22.
   Mubarak arrived in Mauritania on Wednesday for talks with the
chief of state, Col. Muawiya Ould Sid'Ahmed Taya, and later flew to
Senegal for an overnight visit with President Abdou Diouf.
   ``There are points that need to be discussed,'' Mubarak said,
expressing hope that the OAU commission will eventually produce a
settlement to the conflict.
   The commission, formed in July, is composed of the OAU ministers
of Egypt, Niger, Nigeria, Togo, Tunisia and Zimbabwe.

   The United States is pleased that Salvadoran
officials may open peace talks with leftist rebels for the first
time in two years, the State Department said Thursday.
   Spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler made the statement after Salvadoran
President Alfredo Cristiani announced his acceptance of a rebel
proposal that talks be held in Mexico sometime next week. He said
the contacts would be largely preparatory.
   ``President Cristiani called for dialogue in his inaugural
address, and we believe it is time for the FMLN (rebels) to realize
that democracy and violence do not mix,'' she said.
   She added that FMLN support for opening a dialogue is a tribute
to the resolve Congress has shown in reaffirming continued U.S. aid
to El Salvador and for observance of human rights standards.
   ``In doing so, it has signaled to the FMLN that it will be unable
to gain power in El Salvador by winning a political battle in the
U.S.,'' she said.

<TEXT>
   More than 10,000 measles cases were reported in
the United States in the first eight months of this year _ three
times the number reported all last year.
   The national Centers for Disease Control blamed the 1989
increase, which follows two years of declines, on the failure to
vaccinate young children and ineffective vaccinations.
   The CDC said Thursday that 10,115 cases of the once-widespread
childhood disease had been reported through last week.
   That's nearly five times the 2,170 cases reported at the same
time last year and also is well above the 3,411 reported for the
entire year in 1988.
   This year has seen a large number of outbreaks, most of them in
the nation's high schools and colleges, the Atlanta-based CDC said.
   So far this year, more than 90 measles outbreaks have been
reported, including one large outbreak among unvaccinated
preschoolers in Houston, which struck more than 1,700.
   The unvaccinated young children, particularly in outbreak-prone
inner cities, are one of two major impediments to wiping out measles
in the United States, the CDC said in its weekly report. The other
is the failure of vaccinations to protect some people, which has
allowed outbreaks in ``highly vaccinated'' school populations.
   The CDC earlier this year recommended a second dose of measles
vaccine for children beginning kindergarten or first grade.
   Everyone born since 1957 _ when measles was so widespread that
Americans had some natural immunity _ is considered a potential
measles risk.
   ``It would be an expensive, exhaustive undertaking to revaccinate
everybody born since 1957,'' but revaccinating children upon school
entry should ``start chipping away'' at the problem, said Dr. Steve
Wassilak, a CDC immunization specialist.
   The CDC also has recommended earlier vaccinations for inner-city
children _ as early as 9 months, rather than the standard 15 months
_ to try to prevent large outbreaks, and revaccinations for certain
children in the case of school measles outbreaks.
   Specifically, the CDC recommended outbreak revaccinations for
students who were vaccinated before 1980 or vaccinated between the
ages of 12-14 months. In both cases, the agency said, studies have
shown diminished vaccine effectiveness.
   ``The two-dose schedule and intensive efforts to raise ...
immunization levels should facilitate the goal of measles
elimination in the United States,'' the CDC said.
   But Wassilak cautioned that measles rises and falls in cycles, to
some degree, and ``even if next year is low, that's not
inconsistent. There's not going to be an immediate effect; it's
going to take a while for the new policy to deter a significant
number of measles cases.''
   Federal health officials believed measles eradication was within
reach early in this decade, when only a few remaining clusters of
the disease remained. However, measles reporting then increased
between 1983 and 1986.
   The 1989 total is already the highest since 1980, when 13,430
cases were reported in the United States. The disease fell to a
record low of 1,497 cases in 1983, but increased in 1984, '85 and
'86, before beginning another decline, from 6,282 cases in 1986 to
3,652 in 1987 to the 3,411 in 1988.
   All this, however, pales in comparison to the prevaccine levels;
more than half a million cases a year were routinely reported in the
1950s. A measles vaccine became available in the early 1960s.

<TEXT>
   Representatives of the Ethiopian government and an
Eritrean rebel group shook hands and began preliminary talks
Thursday aimed ending their 28-year-old war.
   Former President Jimmy Carter is acting as a neutral observer for
the private talks at The Carter Center. The talks are expected to
last three days, though no time limit has been set; the goal, Carter
said, is to pave the way for more substantive negotiations later.
   Ethiopia and the rebels are warring over the independence of
Eritrea, a province that holds Ethiopia's only direct access to the
Red Sea. An estimated 1 million people have died in the conflict and
its related famine.
   Officials of the two delegations said Thursday they are eager for
peace, but made it clear that profound differences exist.
   ``The Eritrean case cannot be resolved by running away from the
truth or by playing some tricks,'' said Alamin Mohamed Saiyed, head
of the Eritrean delegation.
   ``The search for peace ... should not be viewed as a subterfuge
to buy time, or, still worse, as part of military maneuvers and
tactics of war,'' said Alamin, a member of the Politburo of the
Eritrean People's Liberation Front.
   Ashegre Yigletu, head of the government delegation, said Ethiopia
has tried repeatedly during the past 15 years to end the conflict
peacefully.
   ``It is our view that these peace talks should start off in an
atmosphere that avoids polemics and recrimination and constructively
lead to the restoration of peace in the northern part of our
country,'' said Ashegre, head of the government Central Committee's
Foreign Relations Department.
   Meeting with reporters, Alamin and Ashegre each sat stone-faced
as the other delivered his opening statement in Arabic, followed by
an English interpretation. But, prodded by Carter, they rose at the
end of the meeting and shook hands.
   No public statement on the talks will be issued until they end,
as both sides agreed that issuing progress reports would be
counterproductive, Carter said.
   ``With the success and building of confidence here in Atlanta,
the possibility of a cease-fire and unimpeded delivery of relief
supplies would be facilitated,'' he said.
   The Atlanta Journal-Constitution on Thursday quoted unidentified
diplomats as saying Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak would mediate
further talks if the preliminary sessions succeed.
   A U.N. agreement federated Eritrea, a former Italian colony, with
Ethiopia in 1952. Rebel groups began forming in the early 1960s when
they did not get self-rule and Ethiopia unilaterally annexed the
area.
   Ethiopia considers the conflict a war of secession.
   The Atlanta talks are under the auspices of an informal group
called the International Negotiating Network, which includes
scholars and former diplomats and operates out of The Carter Center.
The meeting is the network's first effort.
   Carter is acting as a private citizen in the talks, though the
Bush administration has wished him well and Carter has said he will
keep the administration informed.
   As president, Carter withdrew U.S. assistance to Ethiopia, but
Bush has indicated a desire to thaw the relationship between the two
nations.

<HEAD>Bill Allows Federal Agencies to Repay Some Student Loans</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With the hope of luring talented young
professionals into public service, a House panel approved a bill
Thursday to allow federal agencies to repay outstanding student
loans of some employees.
   On a voice vote, a subcommittee sent to the full Post Office and
Civil Service Committee the legislation, which authorizes a federal
agency to repay up to $6,000 of an employee's federal student loan
debt in any calender year. The measure also would give agencies the
flexibility to pay or reimburse employees for degree training in
certain occupations.
   The Subcommittee on Civil Service also passed on a voice vote a
bill to prevent the Department of Housing and Urban Development and
other agencies from stacking performance review boards with
political appointees. It merely clarifies sections of the Civil
Service Reform Act by requiring agencies to have a majority of
career appointees on review boards when making performance award
recommendations.
   The subcommittee chairman, Rep. Gerry Sikorski, D-Minn., said
HUD's present policy ``not only circumvents the spirit of the Civil
Service Reform Act, but also undermines the very goal of a
performance award system.
   ``Instead of instituting a system which motivates and awards
individuals for successful performance, HUD's policy threatens to
politicize and void the award process,'' he said.
   The full committee chairman, Rep. William D. Ford, D-Mich.,
introduced the student loan bill.
   Subcommittee members passed the measure with little fanfare or
discussion because Sikorski offered an amendment that addressed most
of the problems raised by the administration during a July hearing.
   Under the amended bill, an agency may repay a total of $40,000 of
an employee's student loan indebtedness. Employees cannot be
reimbursed for any loan payments made before the job began and must
agree in writing, before receiving the benefit, to remain at the
agency for a specified period, not less than three years.
   In selecting workers for the program, an agency is required in
the bill to follow ``merit principles taking into consideration the
need to maintain a balanced workforce representative of the racial,
female-to-male ratio and ethnic makeup of our society.''

<HEAD>Nine States Want All to Share Cleanup Costs</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawmakers representing nine states demanded
Thursday that the entire country share the cost of cleaning up their
states' acid rain emissions, but colleagues said states that foul
the air should foot the bill.
   ``The country owes some help to those asked to do more,'' said
Rep. Philip Sharp, D-Ind., who is chairman of the House Energy and
Commerce energy and power subcommittee and represents one of the
coal-producing states that contribute to acid rain.
   ``We are talking about economic justice for the country,'' Sharp
said at a hearing of the subcommittee.
   The regional conflict, which has been festering for years,
erupted anew with added urgency because President Bush and lawmakers
from both parties are pushing for a new clean air bill. The question
of who pays to clean up acid rain that is fouling lakes and killing
trees would have to be resolved before such a bill is passed.
   Lawmakers from the nine states say their electric utilities
produce 50 percent of the nation's acid rain pollution, but would
have to finance some 67 percent of the cleanup under Bush's plan and
other bills. The extra cost would likely be passed on to consumer
and business electric bills in those states.
   That idea is vigorously opposed by miners who produce high-sulfur
coal that is burned exensively in the nine states: Ohio,
Pennsylvania, Indiana, West Virginia, Illinois, Kentucky, Missouri,
Tennessee and Georgia.
   United Mine Workers of America President Richard L. Trumka told
the hearing up to 30,000 miners could be thrown out of work by the
year 2000 unless other regions share the costs. Utilities would
simply adopt the cheapest solution, he said, and switch to other
fuels rather than installing expensive pollution-reducing equipment.
   Sharp said it ``galls us'' that the nine states would pay ``more
than our fair share.''
   But Rep. Carlos J. Moorhead, R-Calif., said other states have
already paid to clean up their air. ``The other 41 states have
cleaned up their act'' and customers are financing anti-pollution
efforts with higher utility bills. ``The nine states have the
cheapest rates,'' he said.
   ``California has had to do away with all our coal-fired plants''
and adopted technology that includes expensive solar energy and wind
machines, he said, asking why the 41 states ``should pay for states
that have not cleaned up their act.''
   Rep. Michael Bilirakis, R-Fla., argued that states such as
Florida ``went to the expense, they went to the trouble. Now you're
saying we should bear part of the cost.''
   The Bush plan calls for reducing sulfur dioxide emissions by five
million tons by 1995 and by 10 million tons by 2000.
   The cleanup burden in the first phase would fall entirely on 107
utilities burning high-sulfur coal in 20 states. But after 1995,
utilities that exceed their cleanup requirements could trade credits
with other utilities and with other industries.
   Sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen oxide _ which has its own reduction
schedule _ are the main components that form an acid in the
atmosphere and destroy trees and lakes thousands of miles from the
emissions. Refineries and smelting plants emit these pollutants
also, although certain coal-burning utilities are the main culprits.

   The death toll from torrential rains that

   Authorities said three Moroccan tourists were killed and 10

   Meanwhile, officials in Murcia said a woman died when flood
waters swept her car from the road.
   Six people died Wednesday in the flooding.
   Authorities said rescue workers also were searching for three
people missing after waters flooded a campground outside the capital.
   The rains have caused hundreds of millions of dollars of damage

authorities said.
   The Balearic Business Association said damages alone in the
Mediterranean islands off eastern Spain were estimated at $245
million.

<HEAD>Medfly Quarantine in Effect, Spraying Begins Friday</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Agriculture officials plan to begin
an air attack on the Mediterranean fruit fly Friday night, seven
years after similar sprayings in the area wiped out an invasion of
the voracious insects.
   Only 16 medflies have been found so far, but those were enough
for federal and state officials Thursday to seek a quarantine of
fruit from a 60-square-mile area in Santa Clara County, southeast of
San Francisco. The quarantine from San Jose to Palo Alto is
voluntary until the filing becomes official next week.
   Gov. George Deukmejian declared a state of emergency Wednesday,
letting authorities spray the pesticide malathion without issuing an
environmental impact report that could take months to prepare.
   At 9 p.m. Friday, if the weather is good, two helicopters are
scheduled to begin five hours of aerial spraying in a $2 million
battle against a bug that is capable of causing up to $50 million
damage locally to tomatoes, apples, pears, grapes and other produce.
   Millions of sterile medflies will be released in 10 days in a
further attempt to stop the spread of the pests.
   In 1980-82, the state sprayed 1,400 square miles in eight
counties to wipe out a medfly infestation. That war cost $100
million to fight and cost California growers another $100 million in
lost sales.
   Medflies started showing up in traps Monday, and state officials
Wednesday completed a ground spraying of malathion on a
200-square-yard area around a peach tree where the larvae were
breeding.
   Agriculture officials, who are checking 1,700 traps in an
81-square-mile area, warned residents to cover their cars and remain
indoors during the aerial spraying on trees and lawns.
   The quarantine, the officials said, is necessary to prevent
widespread infestation.
   ``It has to be emphasized that the reason the quarantine kept
expanding last time is people kept ignoring our warnings about
moving fruit out of that zone,'' said Greg Van Wassenhove, the
county agricultural commissioner.
   Statewide agriculture is a $16 billion per year industry. Last
year, Santa Clara County's agricultural production was worth $142.5
million, with $94.3 million of the total in fruits, nuts, vegetables
and nursery crops that are among the 250 crops that the medfly
devours.
   Gera Curry, spokeswoman for the state Department of Food and
Agriculture, said harvesters, truckers, processors and sales people
also would be hurt by a medfly infestation because every $1 in
agricultural sales produces $3 in the general economy.

<HEAD>House Panel Approves Child Care Proposal</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House Ways and Means Committee on Thursday
approved its own version of a bill to help low-income parents with
their child care costs, providing the bulk of the aid by raising
existing tax credits and entitlements.
   On a voice vote, the tax-writing panel rejected a competing
version by the House Labor and Education Committee that would
establish a new program of direct child care subsidies to middle-as
well as low-income families.
   With the legislation a key priority for members of both parties,
the chief Democratic sponsors of the competing versions said they
hoped to reach a compromise and avoid a politically damaging fight
on the House floor.
   ``We're not that far apart; we want to avoid Democrats fighting
Democrats,'' said Rep. Thomas J. Downey, D-N.Y., chief author of the
Ways and Means version that, because of its reliance primarily on
tax credits, is more agreeable to Republicans and the Bush
administration.
   With the Senate having approved a shotgun marriage of the two
approaches in June, House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., has said
he hopes to bring the legislation to the floor for a vote before the
end of September.
   The Ways and Means panel's voice vote Thursday was a virtual
repeat of the same stand in took in July. However, the committee
amended its proposal to begin raising the existing child care
subsidies that the federal government finances through block
entitlement grants to states by $200 million in 1990 rather than in
1991.
   Those entitlements _ meaning the money does not have to be
appropriated for them every year _ are designated for a wide variety
of programs to aid the poor and are now capped at $2.7 billion a
year.
   No one knows exactly how much of that existing entitlement money
is actually spent on subsidizing child care, but estimates range
from $400 million up to slightly over $1 billion.
   Whatever the total is, the legislation envisions increasing the
amount devoted to child care by $400 million a year by 1994.
   All versions of the legislation envision increasing direct
federal child care subsidies by a total of $1.75 billion over the
next five years. Included in the total are increases in the existing
Head Start program for poor children ages 3 to 5 and so-called
``latch-key'' subsidies for keeping elementary schools open as care
facilities after classes have ended for the day.
   Indirect aid through an increase in the earned income tax credit
for low-income families would total some $11 billion under the
Senate bill and $13.5 billion in the House Ways and Means version.
   That credit, which is indexed to inflation, now totals a maximum
of $910 a year for a family with an income of between $6,500 and
$10,240. For every dollar of income above the $10,240, the credit is
reduced by a dime, reducing it to zero for a family with an income
of $19,340. The income threshholds for elibility also are raised
every year by the rate of consumer price inflation.
   In 1991, the first year that the new child care tax credit would
take effect, the maximum _ instead of the projected $1,002 _ would
rise to $1,217 for families with one child under the House Ways and
Means version. It would rise to a maximum $1,504 a year for families
with two children and $1,790 with families of three or more children.

<HEAD>Survey Says Most Favor National Health Insurance</HEAD>

   Most Americans think employers should provide
health insurance for their workers, and more than half favor
national health insurance, according to a survey released Thursday.
   But the survey conducted for the Employee Benefit Research
Institute also suggests that Americans undervalue their insurance
benefits, the institute said.
   The survey found that 80 percent of those polled believe
employers should be required to provide health insurance to their
full-time workers.
   Fifty-four percent said the federal government should insure all
Americans, according to the survey.
   However, few would be willing to bear the full cost of benefits.
   About half of those without health insurance said they would be
willing to pay less than $600 annually for coverage, while those
favoring national health insurance said they would be willing to
pay, on average, $664 per year, for that coverage.
   The average cost of individual coverage is $1,056 and for a
family, $2,700, according to the institute.
   ``Everybody is desperately searching for a silver spoon,'' said
Dallas Salisbury, president of the private, nonprofit, nonpartisan
public policy research organization.
   Salisbury said the survey results show that most Americans don't
know what health insurance costs, and that most workers who are
insured through their employer do not consider these benefits to be
part of their compensation.
   Seven out of eight of those surveyed opposed taxing health
insurance benefits received from employers. But of the bulk who
favored requiring employers to provide health insurance, 73 percent
said they would still back that requirement even if benefits were
taxed.
   The survey also asked whether respondents would rather have cash
that would be taxed or the equivalent amount in health insurance
benefits that would be taxed. When the amount was $1,000, 53 percent
opted for health insurance benefits and 40 percent for cash. When
the amount was $2,000, 49 percent took health insurance and 44
percent went for cash.
   Of the 1,000 adults surveyed by telephone during the last week in
June, nine out of 10 said they had health insurance. Of the 10
percent who did not, more than one-third said it was because they
couldn't afford it, 14 percent said they were between jobs and 10
percent said they saw no need for it.
   The survey was conducted by the Gallup Organization Inc. The
margin of error was plus or minus 3 percentage points.

<HEAD>Toxic Waste Cleanup by US Superfund Is `Superslow,' Rand Corp. Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE SIEGEL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal Superfund program has
been ``superslow'' in cleaning toxic waste dumps and in making
polluters pay for the work, according to a study.
   In the program's first eight years ending last September, the
Environmental Protection Agency finished cleaning only 34 dumps out
of 1,175 on a priority list, according to the Rand Corp. study, to
be released Friday. The list represents only the worst of 30,000
dumps where waste ultimately may need to be treated or removed.
   The report also found that EPA spent only $2.6 billion of the
$4.5 billion in Superfund money from Congress during 1980-1988, and
only $1.6 billion went directly to cleanup work, with the rest spent
on management and legal costs.
   Finally, the agency recovered only $230 million of the $2.6
billion from polluters who are supposed to pay for the cleanup work,
said the study by Jan Paul Acton, of Rand's Institute for Civil
Justice.
   ``Superfund has been superslow at cleaning up toxic waste sites,
spending available funds and recovering its outlays from those who
did the polluting,'' the non-profit, Santa Monica-based think tank
said in a statement summarizing Acton's findings.
   Other studies have criticized Superfund's pace, but Rand's is ``a
very good attempt'' to statistically measure progress in cleaning
dump sites, said Walter Kovalick Jr., the EPA's deputy director of
Superfund.
   After he was appointed by President Bush, EPA Administrator
William Reilly ordered an internal review that criticized Superfund.
Reilly pledged in June to toughen toxic waste cleanup enforcement.
Kovalick said that despite problems, the cleanup effort isn't as bad
as Rand's study suggests.
   While only 34 dumps had been declared clean by September 1988,
Kovalick said cleanup is under way on another 170. Designs for waste
isolation or treatment facilities or other cleanup work are in
progress at another 230 dumps. Studies of the extent of
contamination and cleanup options are under way for more than 640
other waste sites, Kovalick said.
   The $2.6 billion actually spent doesn't include formal EPA
obligations to pay for work now under way, Kovalick said. Only a
fraction of cleanup costs has been recovered from polluters because
``it's hard to recover the money until you've finished the (cleanup)
project.''
   ``We think improvements are possible, but substantial progress
has been made,'' Kovalick said by telephone from Washington.
   Rand blamed cleanup delays partly on EPA sluggishness under
ex-President Reagan _ when Superfund official Rita Lavelle went to
prison for perjured testimony to Congress _ and on high staff
turnover, confused management, failure to learn from experience and
other ``inefficiencies'' at the agency.
   But the study also suggested the cleanup effort is lagging due to
court battles that occur because the Superfund law requires the EPA
to make polluters perform or pay for the cleanup work whenever
possible. If companies responsible for pollution can't be identified
or no longer exist, then the Superfund trust fund pays for the
cleanup.
   Acton said that when the law comes before Congress for
reauthorization in 1991, lawmakers may want to ask: ``Is it more
important to clean up the sites (faster) or is it more important to
shift the financial burden to private parties?''
   Under the current law, he said, ``We seem to be getting some of
the worst of both worlds: We set up an adversarial system so it
(cleanup work) goes slower, but then we're not recovering very much
in the way of costs.''
   But Linda Greer, technical director of the Hazardous Waste
Treatment Council, which represents companies that do cleanup work,
said ``there's no reason for the American taxpayer to pay for
industrial dumping'' if the polluting companies can be tracked down.
   The Chemical Manufacturers Association also believes ``the
polluters should pay,'' although many other polluters have fought to
shift the cost to taxpayers, spokesman Tom Gilroy said.
   Greer and Lois Epstein, an engineer with the Environmental
Defense Fund, blamed Superfund's laggard pace on weak enforcement by
the EPA during the Reagan years and foot-dragging by polluters
trying to escape financial responsibility.
   ``We're optimistic that Reilly is ready to improve the program,''
Epstein said.
   The Rand study said EPA may recover another $824 million in
cleanup costs spent through September 1988, and also has signed
agreements with polluters who plan to clean their own dump sites
with work valued at more than $1 billion.
   Acton acknowledged his study doesn't take into account voluntary
cleanups performed by polluters fearful of being forced into more
costly solutions by the EPA.

<HEAD>Congressional Witness Links Organized Crime to Penny Stock Fraud</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An admitted penny stock scam artist, wearing a
hood to conceal his identity, told a House subcommittee Thursday
that penny stocks traded over-the-counter are often controlled by
organized crime.
   Lorenzo Formato, a former broker and promotor of the inexpensive
but highly risky securities known as penny stocks, testified that
``organized crime has their hand on the shoulder of someone inside
any (over-the-counter) brokerage that's making money.''
   Formato is now in the federal Witness Protection Program.
   He told the Energy and Commerce subcommittee on
telecommunications and finance that although there are legitimate
companies offering their stocks over-the-counter they are often
manipulated by brokers, promoters or salesmen.
   Although their price _ a few cents up to a few dollars a share _
makes penny stocks attractive to small investors with limited funds,
many are prone to abuse because information about the issuing
company often is hard to obtain and fraudulent claims are difficult
to dispute.
   Small or young companies, or those that trade infrequently or in
a limited area, are often listed only on so-called ``pink sheets''
rather than with larger and more stable companies. Brokers and
investors must call a broker that deals in a specific company's
shares to get a price quote.
   According to a survey by state securities regulators, American
investors have been cheated out of at least $2 billion a year by
crooked schemes involving penny stocks.
   The National Association of Securities Dealers, a self-regulating
organization that oversees over-the-counter stock brokers, said any
investigation of organized crime links to the industry was in
government hands.
   ``We're cracking down hard on unscrupulous penny stock brokers,
but we're not Elliott Ness,'' said Robert Ferri, a NASD spokesman.
``If an investigation has to go farther than our purview, the law
enforcement agency we're dealing with will take it from there. And
that's quite often the FBI or the Justice Department.''
   ``Penny stock swindles are now the No. 1 threat of fraud and
abuse facing small mom-and-pop investors in the United States,''
said Rep. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., the subcommittee chairman. He
called Formato's testimony ``a blistering, scalding indictment of
the entire penny stock market.''
   Formato entered the crowded congressional hearing room surrounded
by federal marshals and wearing a gray hood with holes for his
mouth, nose and eyes. He testified from behind a screen with his
voice altered deliberately to protect his identity.
   He said he got involved with the mob in his native New Jersey to
prevent competitors from trying to undercut him.
   ``I needed the protection. I needed the strength of organized
crime,'' he said.
   But Formato, who is serving a six-year prison sentence incognito,
declined to say what organized crime family he was involved with.
   He pleaded guilty in 1987 to charges of income tax evasion, mail
fraud and interstate transportation of money taken in stock fraud,
according to Robert Warren, a federal prosecutor in Newark, N.J.
   Formato was the government's key witness at the trial of five
people later convicted of participating in a penny stock fraud
involving a bogus company, Laser Arms Corp., that purported to have
developed a self-chilling beverage can.
   Formato was described at the trial as one of the masterminds
behind the scam. In addition to the five convicted at trial, nine
other people pleaded guilty to charges involving Laser Arms.
   Formato gave several recommendations for cleaning up the penny
stock market, especially tougher penalties.
   He said he used to laugh at the Securities and Exchange
Commission, the watchdog of the stocks and bonds markets, because it
did not have the authority to put him behind bars.
   ``I did not fear the Securities and Exchange Commission,''
Formato said. ``They could only attack me on a civil basis. The
people who bought the stocks lost their money.''
   ``There are thousands of people making millions of dollars doing
what he did,'' said John Baldwin, director of the Utah Division of
Securities.
   Baldwin is also president of the North American Securities
Administrators Association, a Washington-based organization of state
securities regulators.
   ``The evidence is clear and convincing: Penny stock fraud has
evolved into a problem of truly national proportions,'' said Baldwin.
   A report on NASAA's 50-state survey of securities regulators
noted that investors in legitimate penny stocks ``are believed to
lose all or some of their investment 70 percent of the time and the
presence of fraud pushes up that figure to 90 percent.''
   The SEC has created a Penny Stock Task Force and has adopted
rules that will make tougher to sell penny stocks over the telephone.

   Cuban soldiers will begin returning Saturday
from Ethiopia under an agreement between the two countries, the
Cuban government news agency Prensa Latina said Thursday.
   A communique from the Revolutionary Armed Forces Ministry said
the decision to withdraw the troops was taken after ``the conditions
of aggression and threats from abroad that made necessary our
presence in that heroic land ... changed.''
   Cuban military advisers and other specialists were sent to
Marxist Ethiopia in April 1977 and later were joined by combat units
who helped defeat Somali rebels and troops in 1978. Those troops _
which at one point reached 20,000 _ were withdrawn and a small
contingent was left behind as protection, according to the
communique in the Communist Party newspaper Granma.
   The dispatch did not say how many Cuban troops remain in Ethiopia.

<HEAD>Mass Murder Convictions Upheld</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state Supreme Court on Thursday rejected
an appeal by Juan Corona, the farm labor contractor convicted of
murdering 25 farm workers in 1971.
   The justices unanimously denied a hearing on Corona's challenge
to a lower-court ruling upholding his convictions. He was sentenced
to 25 years to life for each of the murders.
   The bodies, most of them stabbed or hacked to death, were found
in shallow graves in orchards in the Marysville-Yuba City area.
Defense lawyers denied Corona's guilt and blamed the murders on a
half-brother, now dead.
   Corona's first convictions were overturned on appeal because of a
finding that his lawyer had acted incompetently and had a conflict
of interest. Corona was convicted again at a second trial.
   The 1st District Court of Appeal upheld the convictions in June
despite finding that a reported confession by Corona had been
admitted into evidence improperly.
   A Mexican consul, Jesus Rodriguez Navarro, testified at the
second trial that Corona had told him in 1978 he had killed the farm
workers because he was a ``sick man.''
   Under an international agreement, consular officials cannot be
required to testify about matters related to their official duties
unless their government issues a written waiver. The Mexican
government did not try to stop Rodriguez from testifying but did not
furnish a written waiver.
   The appeals court said Colusa County Superior Court Judge Richard
Patton, who presided over the retrial, should have excluded
Rodriguez's testimony and was wrong in deciding that the consul was
authorized to waive the privilege of confidentiality on his own.
   But the court, in an opinion by Justice Donald King, said
Corona's rights were not violated because the right of
confidentiality was held legally by the Mexican government, not
Corona. As a result, King said, the defense cannot complain that
violation of that right deprived Corona of a fair trial.
   ``We are fully satisfied that Corona's second trial was fair and
that, ultimately, justice has been accomplished for both Corona and
the people of this state,'' King said.
   In seeking state Supreme Court review, Michael Mendelsohn, a
lawyer for Corona, said Hispanics were not represented adequately on
the grand jury that indicted Corona. Mendelsohn challenged the
appeals court's conclusion that Corona was required to show that the
lack of Hispanics had harmed his case.

<TEXT>
   A man who tried to extort $10,000 from
the family of Mark Kilroy, who was killed by a drug cult in Mexico,
was sentenced to 70 years in prison.
   Robert George Miller, 25, one of five people charged in the
extortion plot, pleaded guilty to theft stemming from the Kilroy
case and two unrelated burglary charges, Tim Weatherly, an assistant
Galveston County district attorney, said Wednesday.
   Miller will be eligible for parole in six years, Weatherly said.
   Kilroy, a University of Texas student from Santa Fe, disappeared
in March while on a spring break outing in Matamoros. He was found
slain on a ranch near the border city on April 11. Investigators
said he was the sacrificial victim of a drug cult.
   During the weeks of Kilroy's disappearance, Miller, who was in
the Galveston County Jail on burglary charges, and another inmate
called Kilroy's parents and said they could arrange his return for
$10,000, police said.
   At one point, officers said the inmates threatened to cut off
Kilroy's fingers and mail them to the family if police arrested or
followed people who would pick up the ransom money.
   Although Kilroy's mother made two trips in April to meet with
alleged accomplices to the inmates, no money was exchanged.
   No connection was found between the alleged conspirators and the
drug smugglers accused of abducting and killing Kilroy.

   Here are excerpts from a Navy statement
Thursday on the investigation into the April 19 explosion aboard the
USS Iowa and from the unclassified version of the endorsement of the
investigation by the chief of naval operations, Adm. Carlisle A.H.
Trost.
   First from the statement:
   The tragic loss of 47 personnel within turret II and associated
ammunition handling rooms precluded a precise causal determination,
since the personnel most knowledgeable of actions and intentions
were those who lost their lives.
   After an examination of all available evidence and extensive
tests, the investigation concluded that the explosion was most
probably caused by an intentional act. The weight of evidence
indicates that some type of detonation device was deliberately
placed between the powder bags being rammed into the breech of the
center gun. The most likely person with the access, knowledge and
possible motivation to accomplish this act has been identified as
Gunner's Mate 2nd Class Clayton M. Hartwig, USN, the center gun
captain in turret II at the time of the explosion.
   The investigation resulted in a complete review of all aspects of
gunnery operations on board USS Iowa. The investigating officer
found deficiencies in training documentation, ordnance handling
requirements and safety procedures; however, exhaustive tests and
duplication of the type of blast that occurred conclusively
demonstrated that these shortcomings did not cause the explosion.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   From Adm. Trost's endorsement of the investigation:
   On 19 April 1989 a rapid series of three explosions within turret
II aboard USS Iowa resulted in the instantaneous deaths of 47
American sailors. A Judge Advocate General's Manual investigation
was convened immediately.
   Every conceivable source of ignition and every aspect of USS
Iowa's condition and shipboard routine that might have bearing on
the incident were evaluated: routine, procedures, training, safety,
manning and personal conduct.
   Since the primary explosion was determined to have occurred
within the center gun room the focus of the investigation was
properly directed to that location.
   The tragic loss of personnel within turret II and adjacent
ammunition handling spaces precluded a precise causal determination
since the personnel most knowledgeable of actions and intentions
were those who lost their lives. ...
   The initial explosion was caused by premature ignition of five
bags of smokeless powder contained within the center gun with the
breech open.
   The point of ignition was most probably between the first and
second bags. Exhaustive technical tests have ruled out the following
possibilities which constitute the most logical inadvertent causes:
burning ember, premature primer firing, mechanical failure,
friction, electromagnetic spark, propellant instability and
personnel procedural error.
   Although deficiencies in training documentation, weapons handling
procedures, and adherence to safety procedures were found within the
weapons department, the exhaustive tests and duplication of the type
of blast that occurred have conclusively demonstrated that these
shortcomings did not cause the explosion. ...
   The thought of an intentional, wrongful act is repugnant to all
professional seagoing men and women; however, this consideration had
to be pursued when information surfaced that introduced its
possibility.
   Extensive laboratory tests using optical and electronic
microscopy revealed the existence of foreign elements not normally
present in the 16-inch guncharge.
   An attempt by separate FBI analysis to correlate these elements
with material associated with an improvised explosive device proved
inconclusive. ...
   Additional hard factual evidence such as the position of the ...
rammer and the subsequent delay in retracting the rammer to allow
closing of the breech provides credibility to the theory that an
intentional human act caused the ignition of the powder charge.
   The critical controlling station within turret II to allow the
aforementioned factors to occur was that of the center gun captain.
These factors, when combined with circumstantial evidence associated
with the individual manning that gun captain position at the time of
the explosion, strongly suggest that an intentional human act most
probably caused the premature ignition. ...
   The evidence amassed includes: (1) irrefutable facts on condition
in the center gun room at the instant of the explosion, such as the
position of the rammer, (2) the fact GMG2 Clayton M. Hartwig was in
the gun captain position, and (3) significant circumstantial
evidence documenting the lifestyle and thought patterns of GMG2
Hartwig over a lengthy period of time.
   The combination of these factors leads me reluctantly to the
conclusion that the most likely cause of the explosion was a
detonation device, deliberately introduced between powder bags that
were being rammed into the breech of the center gun.
   This caused premature detonation and the subsequent disastrous
explosions aboard USS Iowa on 19 April, 1989, resulting in the
deaths of 47 sailors, including Hartwig.
   I further concur with the investigating officer and the
subsequent endorsers that the preponderance of evidence supports the
theory that the most likely person to have introduced the detonation
device was GMG2 Hartwig.

   A Senate committee agreed Thursday to
permanently prohibit cigarette smoking on all domestic airline
flights, expanding the current ban on smoking on trips of two hours
or less.
   The restrictions were included in an $11.9 billion spending bill
for fiscal 1990 transportation programs that the Senate
Appropriations Committee adopted by a 17-0 vote. The measure is
expected to reach the full Senate next week.
   ``It's time to get on with protecting public health and safety,
and this is one way to make certain that happens,'' said the sponsor
of the restrictions, Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J.
   By 18-11, the lawmakers rejected an attempt by Sen. Thad Cochran,
R-Miss., to water down the proposal by making permanent the current
ban on smoking on flights of two hours or less.
   The issue, as usual, cut across party lines: Democrats on the
panel opposed Cochran by an 11-5 margin, while Republicans did the
same, 7-6.
   The committee also rejected 15-8 an amendment by Sen. Ernest
Hollings, D-S.C., that would have forbidden both smoking and alcohol
drinking aboard airliners.
   Current restrictions, which will otherwise expire next April,
cover 80 percent of all U.S. airline routes. Lautenberg's proposal
would take effect 90 days after the bill becomes law, and would
supersede the current prohibition if enacted before April.
   House-Senate negotiators must now work out compromise language
before sending the measure to President Bush for his signature. The
House voted Aug. 3 to make the current prohibition permanent.
   The vote spelled yet another defeat for the tobacco industry and
edged health groups and airline employee unions a step closer toward
their latest victory.
   Supporters of the ban argue that with the recirculated air of
airline cabins, non-smoking passengers face the risk of lung cancer
and other diseases by breathing cigarette smoke.
   Opponents have claimed that health hazards from the fumes are
unproven, and that the ban hurts people who rely on cigarette sales
for their jobs.
   ``The previous system of separating smokers from non-smokers
worked and made the vast majority of people happy,'' said Brennan
Dawson, spokeswoman for the Tobacco Institute, the trade group for
most of the nation's cigarette manufacturers. The industry pocketed
$35 billion in sales last year.
   As under current law, Lautenberg's extension would levy fines of
up to $1,000 for passengers caught smoking and up to $2,000 for
people found to have disconnected smoke detectors in aircraft
restrooms. Lavatories are considered the most dangerous spot for a
fire on an airliner because of the paper stored there, but they also
tend to attract smokers trying to light up in secret.
   Cigar and pipe smoking has been prohibited aboard airliners since
1983.
   Lautenberg and Rep. Richard Durbin, D-Ill., were sponsors of the
current smoking ban, which was enacted in 1987.
   The spending bill would provide $7.3 billion for aviation
programs, $3 billion for the Coast Guard, $12.2 billion for highway
spending, $3 billion for mass transit assistance, and $615 million
for Amtrak, the Northeast passenger railroad. Besides the $11.9
billion in new spending, the measure would also allow $15.9 billion
to be spent from money the government has collected from various
fuel and airline passenger taxes.
   The Bush administration proposed spending $10 billion for
transportation in fiscal 1990, which begins Oct. 1, with lower
spending for mass transit, higher spending for aviation, and no
assistance for Amtrak.
   The Senate measure includes:
   _$35.5 million for subsidies paid to airlines that serve small
communities. The House version of the bill would provide $12.4
million.
   _$1.2 million for a commission on aviation terrorism that
President Bush created last month
   _A requirement that the Transportation Department study what
legal changes would be needed to allow the Coast Guard to fire on
suspected drug smugglers.
   As usual with spending bills, the measure contained funds for
projects in the home states of members of the subcommittee.
   Thus, it bore $500,000 for New Jersey state officials to work on
blocking drug trafficking on interstate highways in Lautenberg's
home state.

   Senate President Larry Tucker resigned
Thursday after his guilty plea to a felony charge was disclosed in
federal court, becoming West Virginia's latest state official to
leave in disgrace this summer.
   Earlier Thursday, a defense lawyer told U.S. District Judge John
T. Copenhaver Jr. that Tucker has agreed to plead guilty to
extortion on a charge that he accepted $10,000 from racetrack
officials seeking favorable legislation.
   ``I just made a stupid mistake,'' he told WSAZ-TV in Charleston.
   The announcement came just before opening arguments in the U.S.
District Court trial of Tucker's predecessor as senate president,
Marshall County Democrat Dan Tonkovich. Tonkovich is charged with
three counts of extortion, two counts of attempted extortion and one
count of racketeering.
   Tucker, also a Democrat, is listed as a defense witness for
Tonkovich, who is accused of soliciting money from groups that had
legislation pending before the Senate.
   Tonkovich's lawyer, James Lees, told Copenhaver he was unaware of
Tucker signing an agreement to plead guilty when he placed the
Senate president on his list of defense witnesses.
   Among other West Virginia Democratic officials who have resigned
or pleaded guilty this summer are Attorney General Charlie Brown,
who resigned as part of an agreement in which a grand jury
investigation of him was halted; state Treasurer A. James Manchin,
who resigned to halt his removal trial in the state Senate on 17
impeachment counts; and state Sen. Si Boettner, who pleaded guilty
to a felony income tax charge and resigned.
   Tonkovich's former top aide, Bob Cain, recently pleaded guilty to
a federal tax charge.
   Federal prosecutors had previously filed documents alleging that
Tonkovich supported legislation in 1987 favorable to Tri-State
Greyhound Park in Cross Lanes in exchange for $10,000 from track
co-owner Bill Ellis. At the time, Tucker was Senate Judiciary
chairman and Tonkovich was Senate president.
   Ellis could not be reached for comment Thursday, but he
previously denied any wrongdoing.
   Tucker, 54, told WSAZ he accepted $10,000 from race track
lobbyist Sam D'Annunzio, then unsuccessfully tried to return it to
him. He said D'Annunzio refused to accept the money.
   D'Annunzio eventually cooperated with federal prosecutors in
their investigation of the Legislature, and he committed suicide in
December 1988.
   Senate Clerk Darrell Holmes said Tucker submitted a one-sentence
letter of resignation Thursday afternoon.
   Tucker, a two-term senator, was elected president in 1989 after
Tonkovich gave up his Senate seat for an unsuccessful campaign for
the Democratic nomination for governor.
   Under legislative rules, Senate President Pro-Tem Tony Whitlow
will serve as acting president until a replacement is elected by the
full Senate, Holmes said.
   The state constitution requires the governor to call a special
session of the Senate within 10 days so a new president can be
elected, Holmes said.

<HEAD>Government Claims It Repulsed Attack on Khost</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NEIL MACFARQUHAR</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government today claimed troops
battling U.S.-backed Moslem rebels had regained control over areas
surrounding the eastern border city of Khost after two weeks of
heavy fighting.
   ``The battle is completely over,'' Lt. Gen. Abdul Ulumi,
secretary of the Supreme Defense Council, told a news conference in
the Afghan capital. There was no immediate confirmation or denial of
his claim.
   Ulumi said at least 3,500 mujahedeen rebels had attacked the
city, just 10 miles from the border with Pakistan, where most of the
rebels are based. He claimed 1,000 rebels were killed and 1,000
wounded in the fighting.
   A rebel victory at Khost would have opened a direct rebel supply
link from Pakistan to fighters in northern and western Afghanistan.
Convoys supplied at depots in Pakistan are now forced to take long
routes around Khost to reach upper Afghanistan, where the
countryside is largely controlled by the rebels. Ulumi said the
fighting ended after government forces recently took back two
military posts at Tani, 10 miles south of the city. He would not
confirm when, but government sources said the posts were retaken in
fighting overnight Wednesday.
   ``We are back in the positions we were in around Khost'' when the
attack was launched Aug. 24, Ulumi said.
   Ulumi told the mujahedeen, who have not had a significant
military victory since the Soviet troops withdrew from Afghanistan
in February after nine years of fighting, that it was futile to
continue trying to capture the country.
   ``Those who imagine they can capture Afghanistan will only take
their coffins with them back to Pakistan,'' he said.
   The mujahedeen have previously launched attacks on Kandahar, the
country's second-largest city, and Jalalabad, a strategically vital
town east of Kabul. Both attacks have bogged down, reflecting the
rebels' inability to switch from their previously successful
guerrilla tactics to more conventional warfare.
   Ulumi also said the Afghan air force had acquired Soviet MiG-29
jet fighters and Sukhoy-27 interceptors but had not used the planes
in combat. The battle of attrition between both sides has usually
been confined to ground fighting, although the government has been
using airplanes and helicopter gunships to strafe rebel positions.

   A proposal to strengthen automobile
fuel-efficiency requirements is unrealistic and could lead the
industry to compromise safety and cut its work force, labor and
industry leaders said Thursday.
   But supporters said the bill was needed to reverse trends toward
U.S. reliance on foreign oil and global warming. They accused the
industry of exaggerating the difficulty of meeting the proposed
standards and their economic impact.
   ``Your predecessors ... in effect forecast the collapse of
Western civilization as we know it in 1974'' when they lobbied
against the original Corporate Average Fuel Economy law, Sen.
Richard H. Bryan, D-Nev., told industry representatives at a hearing
of the Commerce, Science and Technology consumer subcommittee.
   ``Why should I believe you based upon your previous testimony?''
asked Bryan, chairman of the subcommittee.
   Bryan wants to require a 20 percent improvement in fuel
efficiency from the current fleet average by 1995 and a 40 percent
improvement by 2000.
   The current law requires each manufacturer's fleet of new cars
and light trucks sold in the Unites States average at least 27.5
miles per gallon. For General Motors, the Bryan bill would require a
minimum of 33 mpg in 1995 and 40 mpg by 2000, said Marina N.
Whitman, a GM vice president.
   Strengthening the law this year would be especially burdensome
for the industry, which already faces higher costs should Congress
approve President Bush's demand for lower emissions of nitrogen
oxides, Ms. Whitman said. Various federal laws and regulations are
requiring air bags, larger air conditioners and anti-lock brakes,
adding still more costs, she said.
   The law ``fails because the law pressures producers to build
still more fuel-efficient vehicles without creating incentives for
consumers to buy them,'' she said.
   Foreign-car manufacturers complained the Bryan proposal would
punish those who have exceeded the 1974 law's requirements by
forcing them to improve efficiency by the same proportion as those
who have not.
   ``Not only will this reduce competition among companies to
improve fuel economy, but it will prevent consumers from having a
price-competitive range of products from which to choose,'' said Hal
Bracken, a Toyota vice president.
   Owen Bieber, president of United Auto Workers, told the panel
that cars probably would become more fuel-efficient but that
specific targets should not be a matter of law.
   Bryan said his bill would save the country 49.1 billion gallons
of fuel and would reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 483 million
tons between 1995 and 2001.
   ``While we no longer wait anxiously as OPEC meets in Vienna ...
America is becoming more dependent on imported oil,'' he said.
   Sen. Albert Gore, D-Tenn., is pushing a separate idea to levy a
fee on auto emissions and granting a rebate to owners of
fuel-efficient vehicles.

<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa said
Thursday he is concerned about ``a few voices'' in West Germany that
question the legality of Poland's western border.
   The Polish union leader and Nobel Peace laureate, delivering a
speech in Bonn before about 1,000 people, also pleaded anew for
major Western investment to help stave off the collapse of Poland's
battered economy.
   In Duesseldorf earlier Thursday, Walesa welcomed U.S. proposals
to aid Poland, but said the United States and Europe should do far
more.
   Poland's new Solidarity-led government is struggling to revive
the country's economy, weighed down by inefficient state companies,
shortages of goods and a $39 billion foreign debt.
   Walesa stressed that without major economic investment, reform
could be in jeopardy not only in Poland but elsewhere in East
Europe. He said Poles are ready to make sacrifices to attract
Western business investment.
   He also addressed efforts by Poland and West Germany to forge
closer ties. Bitter feelings linger in both countries stemming from
Nazi Germany's invasion of Poland 50 years ago, the start of World
War II.
   Walesa, on the third day of a four-day visit, said he is
optimistic about intensifying West German-Polish relations. But he
said the ``first basis'' for that is the ``inviolability of our
borders.''
   ``We are concerned about a few voices in the Federal Republic
relating to the allegedly open question about the (western)
border,'' Walesa said.
   ``It would be useful, if this topic were no longer present in the
bilateral relations.''
   He called such discussion a waste of time.
   Finance Minister Theodor Waigel and some other archconservative
West German politicians have suggested former German lands now in
Poland technically still belong to Germany because a peace treaty
was never signed establishing the border.
   Resentment continues among many West Germans about the forced
removal of millions of Germans from the now-Polish lands after World
War II.
   But West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl reassured Poland this
country makes no claim to the lands and abides by the 1970 West
German-Polish treaty in which both countries pledged to respect
existing borders.
   Walesa said he is not comforted when archconservatives in West
Germany say they are only pointing out a legal technicality.
   ``If it is possible to interpret the situation in two different
ways, then perhaps the situation should be changed,'' he said.
   Walesa also said he was concerned by resentment among some West
Germans about ethnic Germans who came here from Poland and other
East bloc nations seeking better living conditions.
   A rise in ultraright sentiment in West Germany has been at least
partly attributed to an increasing wave of refugees.
   ``This emigration problem .... activates a wave of intolerance
and provokes nationalistic feelings. People, we must take charge and
find humanitarian solutions!'' Walesa said.
   Kohl met with Walesa on Thursday and called for a new beginning
in Polish-West German relations, calling this especially important
on the 50th anniversary of the start of World War II.
   In Duesseldorf, Walesa was asked about proposed legislation in
the U.S. Senate that would provide aid of up to $300 million a year
and ease Poland's foreign debt burden.
   President Bush has already proposed $100 million in U.S.
assistance to Poland.
   Although asked about the Senate initiative, Walesa instead
referred to Bush's proposal, saying, ``What Bush did is in the right
direction.''
   ``This is not enough for the improvement of living conditions in
Poland. It should be seen as having symbolic value, it should show
people the way, it should animate people.''
   Walesa asked again that the United States and other Western
nations invest $10 billion in Poland.

   Chinese exiles will meet this month to form a

Communist Party chief Zhao Ziyang said Thursday.
   Chen Yizi, who left China after the brutal army crackdown on
student pro-democracy demonstrators June 3-4, said about 120 exiles
were expected at the meeting Sept. 22-24. Chen, who lives in France,
said the site had not been chosen, but it probably would be in
France.
   He said the federation would try ``to build a nonviolent base for
a democratic China.'' Chen, 49, headed the Institute for Economic
Structural Reform in Beijing and was an advisor to Zhao, who was
forced out after the crackdown.

   Special Justice Department operators were
assigned Thursday to answer calls from people protesting the fraud
trial in North Carolina of television evangelist Jim Bakker.
   Three special telephone lines were set up after the department's
main switchboard was inundated with calls that were prompted by
appeals from the evangelist's wife, Tammy Bakker.
   Mrs. Bakker complained that her husband was unfairly treated when
he was confined for a psychiatric examination at the Federal
Correctional Institute in Butner, N.C.
   Bakker was sent there last week after apparently suffering a
mental breakdown.
   Mrs. Bakker's protests were prompted by a judge's ruling that her
husband was mentally competent to stand trial on charges he fleeced
PTL followers out of $4 million.
   On Thursday, she urged supporters to call the Justice Department
to complain ``because the next person that's treated this way could
be your husband or your minister or someone that you love.''
   Justice Department spokesman Joe Krovisky said the operators were
getting ``a continuous stream'' of calls from people protesting the
prosecution of the former PTL leader in federal court in Charlotte,
N.C.
   One of the two operators, who refused to identify himself, said
the department received more than 280 calls on the special lines on
Thursday.

   The former chairman of the House committee that
investigated the Iran-Contra scandal said Thursday that so many
questions remain about the role of President Bush and others that
Congress should not yet close the books on the affair.
   Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., asked that the House Intelligence
Committee begin ``a continuing investigation'' of new documents and
other evidence that have surfaced in the trial of former Marine Lt.
Col. Oliver North or which may surface during other upcoming trials
of Iran-Contra figures.
   Congressional investigators in late 1987 concluded that top
Reagan administration officials had circumvented the law to sell
arms to Iran and generate money to buy weapons for Nicaragua's
Contra rebels. But the yearlong probe failed to fully pinpoint the
extent of personal responsibility of Reagan, Bush and others.
   ``Most importantly, we still do not understand precisely what
were the roles in these events of President Reagan, Vice President
Bush and other top Reagan administration officials,'' Hamilton said
in a letter to Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Anthony C.
Beilenson, D-Calif.
   ``Congress was charged with the responsibility to investigate
these events thoroughly and to understand them as best we could. We
will have failed to discharge fully that responsibility if we leave
important evidence unexplored,'' Hamilton wrote.
   ``In light of the importance of the questions that remain and the
enormous implications of the events that have occurred, I do not
believe we can consider the congressional investigation of the
Iran-Contra affair to be complete.''
   Hamilton acknowledged that there is a certain weariness with the
matter on Capitol Hill, but noted that each new effort to dig back
into the affair has shed new light.
   He asked that as part of its continuing probe, the Intelligence
panel ask the Bush White House to undertake a comprehensive search
of all relevant Reagan administration files, including the ``heads
of state'' file recently discovered at the Reagan Library in
California.
   ``It is possible that other important documents were missed by
have not yet come to light,'' Hamilton wrote.
   He also asked that the committee evaluate the seven new documents
turned up at the North trial, which strongly suggested a Reagan
administration deal with the Honduran government under which the
Hondurans would help the Contras in return for increased U.S. aid.

<TEXT>
   Congress is conducting at least four
investigations of possible security and conflict-of-interest
problems at an Energy Department laboratory that performs top-secret
nuclear weapons work, congressional sources said Thursday.
   The newest probe, launched in July by the House Energy and
Commerce oversight and investigations subcommittee, focuses on the
terms under which the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
transferred a new computer technology to a company led by former lab
scientists who had helped develop the technology.
   Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of the subcommittee, has
raised ethics questions about the deal, although lab and company
officials deny any wrongdoing.
   Congressional sources involved in the probes disclosed Thursday
that lab officials also are under investigation for allegedly
``failing to protect important security assets'' at the site, near
Livermore, Calif.
   The sources, who spoke on the condition they not be identified,
declined to reveal details of the security lapse but said John Tuck,
the energy undersecretary, acknowledged in a closed hearing in July
that the problem posed an unacceptable risk to national security.
Immediate corrective actions were promised, they said.
   A reporter's telephone call to Tuck was not returned.
   Plutonium and other sensitive materials are used at Lawrence
Livermore in nuclear weapons design and research activities. The
lab, one of three major weapons design facilities, is operated by
the University of California under an Energy Department contract.
   The Dingell subcommittee also is investigating the national
security implications of an allegation by Roy Woodruff, formerly a
leader of the lab's weapons program. Woodruff contends he was
blocked by lab superiors from writing to national security officials
in Washington in 1983-85 to dispute optimistic projections by
physicist Edward Teller about the X-ray laser weapon being developed
there.
   The X-ray laser uses the energy of a nuclear explosion in space
to destroy enemy rocket boosters.
   Separately, the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm
of Congress, is probing allegations of thefts of government property
at the lab. This probe was launched last year after Dingell's panel
was told in a public hearing that some lab employees had sold
computers and other government assets for drug money.
   The lab in 1986 launched its own investigation of drug
trafficking by employees after a number of workers became involved
in drug-related incidents and arrests. Dingell later accused the
Energy Department of pressuring the investigators to drop the matter
just days before they were to enter the highest-security sections of
the lab.
   Dingell stepped up pressure on Energy Secretary James D. Watkins
to review the University of California's management of Lawrence
Livermore by pressing him for information about the circumstances of
a licensing deal the lab made earlier this year with n-Chip Inc., a
Livermore-based company started by former lab scientists.
   The department's internal auditors also are investigating the
licensing deal at the request of the department's San Francisco
field office, which oversees the lab operations.
   In a July 7 letter to Watkins, a copy of which was made public on
Wednesday, Dingell called the awarding of the license to n-Chip to
commercially develop a technology known as laser pantography
``highly curious.''
   He cited ``the appearance of a conflict of interest'' in granting
an exclusive license to a company whose top officials include at
least three people who helped Lawrence Livermore develop the
technology.
   Laser pantography is used for connecting computer chips in a way
that permits supercomputers to be compressed to the size of a
cigarette pack.
   In a telephone interview Thursday, Philip Dauber, the chairman of
n-Chip, said his company and the lab took special care to meet all
ethical and legal requirements for the licensing deal. He called it
a ``normal, usual patenting agreement.''

   President Bush asked Congress on Thursday for
the downpayment on a $150 million aid package for Poland and
Hungary, and the White House said it might increase the amount if
more economic and political reforms are adopted by those countries.
   For the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1, Bush requested $33.5
million.
   ``We'll always be looking for opportunties to increase that aid
but we believe certain economic reforms and political reforms are
necessary as a link with any real increases in aid, so we have some
assurances that it is, indeed, revitalizing the Polish economy,''
said White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater.
   He said Bush wrote to congressional leaders and asked for rapid
approval of his request.
   In addition to the economic aid, the administration is preparing
a $58 million package of food aid for Poland that is expected to be
ready around Oct. 1. Fitzwater said, ``We want to get all the food
aid in there we can.''
   Bush announced the $150 million package during his July trip to
Poland and Hungary. Some members of Congress have urged the
administration to expand the package to reward the installation of
Solidarity member Tadeusz Mazowiecki as prime minister of Poland.
   The president discussed the package, along with other subjects,
with Republican members of Congress during a meeting at the White
House.
   Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole, R-Kan., who earlier had
recommended a higher figure, said, ``I think he's doing what he
should do in providing the leadership, working with the Western
alliance.''
   Dole said ``the bottom line is ... it's primarily the
responsibility of Poland.''
   Sen. Pete V. Domenici, R-N.M., said he recommended to Bush that
he name a task force of American businessmen, labor leaders and
others to work with Poland's government to identify the reforms it
should adopt ``to get from a communist economic base to a more
productive base.''
   Fitzwater said the idea is being considered.
   In July, Bush said he would provide Poland with $100 million to
spur private enterprise and $15 million for environmental projects.
Hungary is to receive $25 million for entrepreneurial projects and
$5 million for environmental projects. Bush also requested $5
million to promote organized labor.

   Common Cause accused the Federal Election
Commission Thursday of falling down on its job of policing federal
campaign finance laws, claiming the FEC's ``seemingly willful
refusal to act'' has encouraged illegal practices.
   The self-styled citizens lobby said the problems are so pervasive
``the best, albeit drastic, remedy may be to abolish the FEC
altogether and to create a new election law enforcement agency.''
   ``The FEC in recent years increasingly has abdicated its most
basic responsibility _ to enforce the law,'' Common Cause said in a
report.
   Fred Eiland, a spokesman for the election commission, said he
wasn't certain whether the agency would issue a response. Common
Cause is an enduring critic of the FEC and has sued the agency
frequently.
   The failure to enforce the federal campaign finance laws
``springs both from the structural defects Congress created in the
agency and from the recalcitrance of the commissioners themselves,''
the study said. ``Congress virtually has ignored the FEC's failure
to enforce the law.''
   Under laws passed after the Watergate scandals in the early
1970s, the FEC is charged with administering public funding of
presidential campaigns, policing public disclosure, interpreting
laws pertaining to presidential and congressional elections,
investigating alleged violations and undertaking enforcement actions.
   Common Cause spotlighted so-called ``soft money'' practices in
which contributions from corporations, labor unions and invididuals
are channeled to state and political party organizations.
   The study said that in 1988 the presidential campaigns of George
Bush and Michael Dukakis ``together raised up to $50 million in soft
money contributions from corporations, labor unions and individuals
in donations as large as $100,000, money that is strictly prohibited
in federal elections campaigns.''
   ``Although this occurred in full public view, the FEC took no
action to stop it, in spite of a federal court decision ordering the
agency to issue new soft money rules.''
   The study said, ``by its inaction, the FEC virtually issued an
invitation to presidential campaigns to continue violating the law,
an invitation which both presidential campaigns seized upon.''
   Common Cause said such inaction discourages voluntary compliance
with the law, encourages non-compliance ``to the point where the
integrity of the presidential campaign finance system, in particular
is now at risk.''
   The advocacy group praised the FEC for performing well in the
areas of public disclosure of campaign records and administering the
distributions of public funds.

   Fourteen parties formally united
Thursday to oppose the ruling Sandinistas in the February general
election.
   Gustavo Tablada, spokesman for the National Opposition Union,
said the alliance would be registered Friday with the National
Council of Parties and the Supreme Electoral Council.
   All parties in the alliance approved Violeta Barrios de Chamorro
as the opposition presidential candidate last Saturday, but
disagreement arose over the choice of Virgilio Godoy, a former
Sandinista, for vice president. Mrs. Chamorro is publisher of La
Prensa, Nicaragua's only opposition newspaper.
   When the split over Godoy appeared to widen, four parties asked
the electoral council to extend the Friday deadline for registration.
   All 14 parties, from conservative to Communist, signed a founding
document Thursday that allows parties to withdraw and others to join.
   Only a unified opposition is considered to have a chance against
the Sandinistas in the election, scheduled for Feb. 25.
   ``This is our weapon, the unity of the Nicaraguan people so that
from today on our nation can once again be a republic,'' Mrs.
Chamorro said after the signing at opposition headquarters. ``We
hope Ortega fulfills his promises of clean elections.''
   President Daniel Ortega is expected to run as the candidate of
the leftist Sandinista National Liberation Front, which overthrew
the pro-American government of the late President Anastasio Somoza
in July 1979.
   Godoy, labor minister in the Sandinista government from 1979 to
1984, was chosen as the opposition vice presidential candidate over
businessman Enrique Bolanos. Some on the right see him as too
liberal.
   Members of the opposition alliance are the Popular Social
Christians, Liberal Independents, Liberal Constitutionalists,
Socialists, Democratic Movement, Social Democrats, Communists,
Popular Conservative Alliance, National Action, National Confidence
Democrats, Neoliberals, National Conservatives, Central American
Integrationists and National Conservative Action.
   Nicaragua has seven other small parties that are not in the
alliance.

<HEAD>Bush, Quayle In Step On SDI: Fitzwater</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said
Thursday there was no difference of opinion between President Bush
and Vice President Dan Quayle on the Strategic Defense Initiative.
   The spokesman also said that former President Reagan had not
exaggerated the potential ability of SDI to defend against incoming
nuclear missiles.
   The Los Angeles Times published an interview with Quayle on
Thursday in which the vice president suggested that Reagan had
resorted to ``political jargon'' in his original, 1983 sales pitch
for a multi-billion-dollar research effort aimed at creating a
space-based defense shield.
   Quayle said Reagan, in launching his SDI initiative, ``talked
about this impenetrable shield that was going to be completely leak
proof.''
   ``I believe that in the semantics of let's say political jargon,
that that was acceptable. But it clearly was stretching the
capability of a strategic defense system,'' said the vice president.
   Fitzwater said Quayle's comments reflected ``the fact that we
have been able to winnow the objectives of the program to ... fit
more definable kinds of objectives.''
   He said there was ``no difference'' between Bush and Quayle on
SDI.
   Quayle was ``just saying there was some strange language
associated with some of the discussion of it,'' said Fitzwater.
``But he believes in it.''
   Referring to Quayle's ``political jargon'' phrase, Fitzwater
added, ``The only thing we have different today is two inflammatory
words.''
   Fitzwater said Bush still has not given up the goal of perfecting
a space shield against all incoming nuclear missiles.
   ``That's kind of the goal that you keep working for,'' said
Fitzwater.
   The ``ultimate goal,'' he added, remains ``a space shield that
protects against the intercontinental ballistic missiles.''
   Quayle, an early, ardent advocate of SDI, said in the interview
that the on-going research effort on SDI has been ``clearly
rethought,'' with emphasis on an approach called ``Brilliant
Pebbles'' that would rely on clusters of mini-missiles to track and
knock out incoming rockets.
   ``We have redefined Star Wars and put it into missions,
requirements, doctrine and strategy much differently than we did in
the early 1980s,'' Quayle said.
   Quayle said the new emphasis could help protect the United States
against an accidental launch or a limited nuclear attack ``rather
than an all-out, bolt-out-of-the-blue attack'' by the Soviets.
   The administration's request for $4.9 billion for SDI research
for fiscal 1990 is under attack on Capitol Hill, where the House
wants to cut $1.8 billion from the program.

<HEAD>Arabs Claim Graveyard Bulldozed to Improve View for Villas</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HERZLIYA, Israel (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israeli Arabs demanded an investigation
Thursday of claims that a century-old Moslem graveyard was bulldozed
so adjacent villas would have a better view of the Mediterranean.
   ``The municipality does nothing when a graveyard is criminally
desecrated and the bones of the dead are crushed by bulldozers of
people who have no morals,'' said a statement released by Moslem
leaders who gathered at the site near Herzliya, a coastal town eight
miles north of Tel Aviv.
   Moslem clerics and three Arab members of the Israeli parliament
said the city sent the machines to change a pipe in the graveyard,
then the workers hauled away hundreds of cubic yards of earth to
give the villas a better view, the newspaper Yediot Ahronot reported.
   Israel radio quoted Mayor Eli Landau as saying the bulldozers did
not enter the graveyard, but that the city would investigate. It
quoted him as saying the incident was an ``attempt to create
friction between Arabs and Jews.''
   Yediot Ahronot quoted Parliament member Rafi Edri, who owns a
house in the area, as saying no graves were violated.
   ``If there was any desecration of a graveyard, I'd be the first
to scream,'' the independent paper quoted him as saying. It said the
Labor Party legislator joined neighbors in helping pay for the
earthmoving work.

   The U.S. ambassador to Lebanon, John McCarthy,
said Thursday he hopes to be able to return to Beirut ``as soon as
the situation is calm again.''
   McCarthy and 29 members of the U.S. Embassy staff were evacuated
from Beirut Wednesday after a Christian commander in the embattled
city had voiced threatening remarks.
   McCarthy spoke briefly with reporters when he arrived at Dulles
International Airport on a flight from Frankfurt, West Germany.
   ``Any embassy has to rely on the host government authorities to
provide protection,'' he said. ``When we felt that that wasn't being
provided any more, we had to leave.''
   Asked whether the United States was washing its hands of Beirut,
McCarthy replied:
   ``Never. We're very interested in what's happening in Lebanon. We
have a strong attachment to the Lebanese people.''
   The ambassador was asked whether the evacuation of him and the
embassy staff would have any impact on efforts to free Western
hostages believed held in Beirut.
   McCarthy said that while the U.S. Embassy was located in
Christian East Beirut, the hostages are believed to be held captive
in Moslem West Beirut. Movements of Americans assigned to the
embassy had been restricted to East Beirut.
   For that reason, he said, ``our absence from Beirut will
unfortunately not really impact significantly on what we know about
the hostages.''
   The envoy was met at the airport was met by his wife, Marija, and
their 11-year-old daughter, Julia.
   Earlier Thursday, the State Department renewed its allegation
that a Christian commander in Lebanon had threatened to take 20
Americans hostage.
   ``I view it as a threat,'' spokeswoman Margaret D. Tutwiler said
of General Michel Aoun's remark to the French newspaper Figaro that
taking hostages was evidently the way to get U.S. attention.
   Aoun had complained in the interview that the United States was
not paying enough attention to the war in his country between
Christians and Moslems backed by Syria.
   In reply, Ms. Tutwiler said the Bush administration had taken an
active role in seeking a settlement.
   She said President Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker III
had called for a cease-fire and U.S. ambassadors and government
officials in the Middle East were working toward that end.
   ``I think we have been engaged,'' Ms. Tutwiler said.

<HEAD>Family, Sailors Dispute Navy Finding</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Iowa Inquiry, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The Navy's conclusion that a gunner's mate probably caused a
deadly explosion on the battleship USS Iowa was met Thursday with
harsh criticism from his family and skepticism from other sailors.
   The Navy ``has concocted this fable ... in an attempt to shift
the blame away from its dismal track record in their operation of
this battleship and lay the blame on a dead sailor who isn't here to
defend himself,'' said Kreig J. Brusnahan, an attorney for the
family of Clayton Hartwig.
   In a report released at the Pentagon, the Navy said Hartwig
probably placed a detonator between gunpowder bags in one of the
battleship's 16-inch guns. The April 19 blast killed 47 sailors
including Hartwig, who was the gun captain, or supervisor of loading
the weapon and with its World War II-vintage ammuntion.
   ``The idea that one man blew up 47 others, I don't find it
feasible. I think it was somehow an accident,'' said a petty officer
second class at the USS Iowa's home port, Norfolk, Va. He declined
to give his name. ``If the man wanted to commit suicide, there are a
lot of other ways to do it, without taking 47 of your crewmates with
you.''
   Retired Rear Adm. Eugene Carroll, deputy director of the Center
for Defense Information in Washington, called the finding ``a very,
very far-reaching grasping at straws.'' He said the report
criticized the equipment maintenance and crew training but did not
blame those factors for the explosion.
   ``This probable cause diverts attention from the question of the
performance of the equipment and the personnel,'' he said.
   Others defended the Navy's investigation.
   ``I don't think it's a cop-out,'' said electrician's mate 3rd
Class Michael Glass, who is stationed aboard the amphibious cargo
ship Charleston in Norfolk.
   ``I would say the Navy Investigative Service has probably done
their homework. They probably know for a fact, or have enough
evidence, circumstantial or not, to back up this theory,'' said
Steven Haight, of Norfolk, who retired from the Navy after 20 years,
most in intelligence.
   The report on the explosion was delivered to the ship Wednesday
during a port call in Gaeta, Italy, said Capt. Paul Hanley, an
Atlantic Fleet spokesman. The Iowa left Norfolk in June for six
months in the Mediterranean Sea.
   A criminal investigation of the explosion was launched after
Hartwig's sister, Kathy Kubicina, disclosed the existence of a
$100,000 accidental death and dismemberment policy on her brother's
life, naming gunner's mate 3rd class Kendall Truitt as a beneficiary.
   At a news conference in Miami, Truitt's attorney, Ellis Rubin,
dismissed the Navy's version of the explosion, which he said is
``nothing more than speculation.
   ``Our information was that it was the Navy's negligence,
untrained and unqualified crew members and 50-year old technology,
dangerous from day one,'' said Rubin.
   Truitt had expected to attend the news conference, but was
ordered to remain at the Mayport Naval Station in Jacksonville,
Fla., until too late to catch a flight for Miami, Rubin said.
   Harwig's family in Cleveland was briefed on the Iowa report by a
three-member Navy contingent on Thursday.
   Hartwig's father, Earl V. Hartwig, a Navy veteran, said he was
unconvinced that his son or any other crew member had caused the
explosion.
   ``I think there was a powder explosion _ accidental,'' Earl
Hartwig said.
   ``I've never believed it right from the start,'' Ms. Kubicina
said when asked if she thought her brother had caused the blast.
   Ms. Kubicina and her father said they wanted a congressional
investigation into the Navy's handling of the Iowa probe. Ms.
Kubicina also said the family is planning a defamation lawsuit
against the Navy.

<HEAD>Government Changes Election Could Be Referendum on Governor</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS 4th graf, `Leading the ..., to restore dropped first reference

<BYLINE>By MARK PAXTON</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Residents vote Saturday on three
proposed changes to state government in a special election that
could serve as a referendum on Gov. Gaston Capterton's first eight
months in office.
   Caperton, a Democrat, could win broad, new powers if two of the
measures pass.
   One amendment eliminates three statewide elected offices _
secretary of state, treasurer and agriculture commissioner _ and
places their duties under the governor's control. The second gives
the governor control of the state primary and secondary education
system, taking it away from the largely independent state Board of
Education. The third gives cities and counties the ability to merge
or choose new forms of government.
   Leading the campaign against the first amendment are two of the
officeholders _ Secretary of State Ken Hechler, a Democrat, and
Agriculture Commissioner Cleve Benedict, a Republican.
   ``This is a much larger issue than party loyalty,'' Benedict
said. ``This is a very fundamental choice on who we, Ken Hechler and
I, trust to exercise power _ whether we trust citizens at the ballot
box, or whether we trust the political elite.''
   Hechler and Benedict, both former congressmen, say they aren't
campaigning just to save their jobs; the amendment wouldn't take
effect until their terms end in 1992.
   ``I'm just a temporary occupant,'' said Hechler. ``It belongs to
the people, and future generations ought to continue to have the
right to choose whoever they want.''
   The third official, Treasurer Thomas Loehr, supports Caperton's
plan. Caperton appointed Loehr to the post in July after two-term
Treasurer A. James Manchin resigned rather than face trial in the
state Senate over the loss of $279 million from an investment fund
his office supervised.
   Caperton contends he can save $3 million a year by assigning the
officeholders' duties to other officials.
   ``This is not a turf war,'' Caperton said in his weekly radio
address last weekend. ``It's an economic battle.''
   He said critics who accuse him of a power grab are distorting the
issue.
   Saturday's election comes at a time of widespread trouble in West
Virginia politics. In addition to Manchin's resignation, Attorney
General Charlie Brown resigned Aug. 21 to halt a grand jury
investigation of his campaign financial records and allegations that
he lied under oath.
   Former state Senate President Dan Tonkovich went on trial
Thursday on federal extortion and racketeering charges. Three
others, include the former Senate majority leader, pleaded guilty to
lesser charges in exchange for their testimony for the government.
   Supporters and opponents say the special election for 868,802
registered voters could turn into a referendum on Caperton's first
eight months in office.
   Caperton, a millionaire businessman, won a landslide victory last
November over Republican incumbent Arch Moore. One of his first acts
was to push through the largest tax increase in state history, $392
million, despite a campaign promise not to raise taxes.
   ``There's a lot of anger out there about the tax increase, a lot
of anger about politics of the past, about broken promises,''
Benedict said. ``Those are all probably going to be factors in the
outcome.''
   Former Gov. Cecil Underwood, who is supporting the amendments,
agreed that Caperton's job performance will be a factor.
   ``Constitutional revision should never be a referendum on the
incumbent,'' Underwood said. ``At the same time, it is almost
impossible to keep that element out of the issue.''
   A statewide survey conducted Aug. 19-23 for The Associated Press,
the Charleston Daily Mail and WSAZ-TV showed that two-thirds of the
registered voters surveyed knew little about the amendments, but a
majority said they would vote against the two measures that would
give the governor more power.
   The secretary of state's office maintains records regarding
corporations and supervises state election laws. The Agriculture
Department regulates farming and provides assistance to farmers and
gardeners. The treasurer's office handles state investments and
maintains the state's bank deposits.
   If voters approve the amendment, the remaining elected statewide
jobs will be governor, attorney general and auditor.

<HEAD>Navy Says Suicidal Behavior All But Impossible to Guard Against</HEAD>

   Navy admirals said Thursday it would be
virtually impossible to guard against the type of suicidal behavior
they believe caused the explosion that killed 47 sailors aboard that
USS Iowa last April 19.
   A Navy report said ``circumstantial evidence'' indicated Gunner's
Mate Clayton M. Hartwig, who was closest to the breech in the middle
gun of turret No. 2, dropped a detonator between bags of gun powder
being loaded during firing exercises off Puerto Rico.
   ``As with any catastrophe, the immediate impulse is to take every
possible step to prevent a recurrence,'' wrote Adm. Carlisle A.H.
Trost, the chief of Naval Operations and the top officer in the Navy.
   But Trost said, ``it is virtually impossible to have established
procedures to absolutely preclude disastrous results of such an
individual choice.''
   Documents released with the report show Hartwig was depressed
over the collapse of a close friendship, and one letter from Hartwig
11 days before the explosion eulogized sailors who died in action
and said, ``I could become one of those little white headstones in
Arlington National Cemetery.''
   The report said Hartwig ``was emotionally capable of committing
suicide, probably with the intent of killing others also.''
   The report used the words ``repugnant'' and ``incredulous'' to
describe the idea that ``an intentional human act'' sparked the
blast, but concluded that Hartwig was ``the principle suspect.''
   ``We don't know the motivation,'' said Adm. Leon Edney, the vice
chief of naval operations.
   Edney told a Pentagon press conference the Navy did not plan to
change its psychological screening procedures.
   ``We didn't see anything that required a drastic change,'' he
said.
   Hartwig's allegedly suicidal character only became apparent after
interviews with his acquaintances and family over the course of the
four-month investigation, Edney said.
   ``He was a clean-cut sailor. He didn't smoke. He didn't drink. He
didn't carouse on leave. ... He wasn't a troublemaker,'' said Edney.
   The investigation also uncovered lax procedures aboard the Iowa,
the report said, and the Navy announced immediate steps to correct
them.
   The circumstances of the explosion are muddied by ``a number of
major administrative and supervisory discrepancies on board the USS
Iowa, as well as substantial and serious failures by senior USS Iowa
personnel to properly discharge their responsibilities,'' Adm.
Powell F. Carter, commander of the Atlantic Fleet, said in a letter
released with the report.
   But, Carter wrote, ``exhaustive testing and evaluation has
virtually ruled out any of these discrepancies as directly causing
the deaths of the 47 crewmembers in Turret 2.''
   ``Nevertheless, the number and egregriousness o the discrepancies
create an impression of laxity and disregard that will cloud the
investigations in the minds of non-experts for the immediate
future,'' Carter wrote.
   Among the problems cited in the report were a failure to fully
train sailors in the gun turret on firing procedures.
   To prevent a repeat, ``all battleship weapons departments are to
be inspected and deficiencies corrected prior to authorizing full
unrestricted use of 16-inch gun systems,'' the report said.
   Rear Adm. Richard D. Milligan, who led the investigation,
concluded after numerous tests none of the irregularities could have
sparked the blast.
   He began to investigate the possbibility that the explosion was
intentional after receiving a letter from Hartwig's sister, Kathy
Kubicina, saying Hartwig meant to change the beneficary of a
$100,000 accident death insurance policy to his parents from another
sailor aboard the Iowa, Kendall Truitt.
   Truitt was once a close personal friend of Hartwig, but the
friendship had cooled after Truitt became involved with a woman,
Milligan said.
   Although Milligan said he found no evidence that Hartwig was a
homosexual, documents released with the report show investigators
were examining possible ``homosexual activity'' and ``Hartwig's
alleged homosexuality.''

   President Bush said Thursday he is keeping Paul
A. Adams as inspector general of the scandal-plagued Department of
Housing and Urban Development.
   Adams has been HUD's inspector general since 1985.
   It was Adams' report that led to the current congressional
investigations of influence-peddling at HUD during the Reagan
administration.
   Over the years, Adams has written a number of reports warning of
problems such as those that have recently come to light.
   But some members of Congress have criticized him for not being
aggressive enough in pushing department officials, including former
HUD Secretary Samuel R. Pierce Jr., into correcting the problems.
   The White House announced Bush's decision to keep Adams in the
post without further comment.
   In other personnel moves, the president also said he will
nominate:
   _Federal Trade Commissioner Margot E. Machol to serve on the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Mrs. Machol, 40, is a former
Treasury Department official and White House economics aide
appointed to the FTC last year.
   _LaJuana Sue Wilcher as assistant administrator of the
Environmental Protection Agency in charge of water programs. Ms.
Wilcher, 34, is a lawyer and former EPA official.
   _Duane Perry Andrews as assistant secretary of defense for
command, control, communications and intelligence. Andrews, 44, is a
former Air Force officer who has served on the staff of the House
select committee on intelligence since 1977.
   _David Courtland O'Neal as assistant secretary of the interior
for land and minerals management. O'Neal, 52, is a former Illinois
lieutenant governor who has worked for the Interior Department since
1986, most recently as acting assistant secretary for mine safety
and health.
   The president also said he is keeping James R. Richards as
inspector general of the Department of the Interior, and Carol C.
Adelman as assistant administrator for Asia and the Near East at the
Agency for International Development.

   The National Party government
promised reform Thursday after suffering heavy losses in an election
accompanied by protests and political violence in which 25 people
were reported killed.
   If the death toll is confirmed, it would be the highest in a
24-hour period since 69 blacks were shot to death during a peaceful
protest in Sharpeville township in 1960.
   In Wednesday's white parliamentary election, the Nationalists got
less than 50 percent of the vote for the first time since 1953. They
lost nearly a quarter of their seats to an anti-apartheid party and
to a far-right group that favors strict racial segregation.
   Police used shotguns, tear gas and whips on anti-election
protesters in black and mixed-race townships outside Cape Town.
   Essa Moosa and Associates, a prominent Cape Town law firm, said
25 people were killed Wednesday night and early Thursday in seven
townships on the sprawling Cape Flats. Activists blamed most of the
killings on police.
   Desmond Tutu, the black Anglican archbishop, said 23 people were
killed and ``we expect the numbers of the dead to grow.'' The
newspaper Grassroots said it had confirmed 15 of the bodies were in
a mortuary.
   One victim was a 69-year-old woman whose headless body was found
riddled with bullets, said The Star of Johannesburg, the country's
largest newspaper. The Western Province Council of Churches said at
least 100 people were injured, including children.
   Leon Mellet, spokesman for the Law and Order Ministry, confirmed
12 deaths. He said at least seven were related to black factional
fighting and the others were being investigated.
   South African Press Association, an independent news agency, said
the Cape Flats resembled ``a war zone ... as residents danced around
dozens of burning barricades blocking streets in the area and police
fired repeatedly at groups of youths.''
   A mixed-race lieutenant said police caused riots Tuesday in the
Mitchell's Plain area of Cape Town.
   Lt. Gregory Rockman said police ``were just hitting people. They
couldn't care if they were innocent bystanders. It seemed to me that
they were enjoying themselves, feasting on the people. You could
just see the killer instinct in their eyes.''
   Activists said 11 people were reported killed Wednesday night in
Mitchell's Plain. Police would not comment on Rockman's remarks.
   Violence resumed Thursday afternoon when police with shotguns
opened fire on dancing and chanting teen-agers in the mixed-race
Lavender Hill township, said a journalist at the scene. Four people
were reportedly killed in the township the night before.
   The Rev. Allan Boesak, a prominent activist, said the presidency
of F.W. de Klerk ``now sits in a pool of blood.''
   ``I don't know how people can become vaguely excited about these
elections when ... the man with a new vision has allowed this kind
of massacre to take place,'' Boesak said.
   The outlawed African National Congress, the main black group
fighting white rule, said from Harare, Zimbabwe: ``The elections .
.. were a farce and irrelevant to the ANC and the oppressed majority
of South Africa.``
   De Klerk described the election result as ``a clear mandate'' for
his party's gradual political reforms, which envision bringing
blacks into the national government on a limited basis within five
years.
   ``Seventy percent of the whites voted for parties favoring
renewal and reform ... and granting political rights,'' he said,
linking the National Party with the liberal-minded Democrats.
   He now is acting president. An electoral college is expected to
given him a full five-year term next week.
   South Africa's 5 million whites control the government and the 28
million blacks have no voice in national affairs. Separate
Parliament chambers for people of mixed race and Indian descent were
established in 1984 but have little power.
   The National Party, in power since 1948, dropped form 123 seats
to 93 in the 166-seat white chamber and received 48.5 percent of the
vote.
   Voters gave the far-right Conservative Party 39 seats, compared
with 22 in the old Parliament, and 31.2 percent of the vote. The
anti-apartheid Democrats, who favor a vote of equal weight for every
South African, went from 20 seats to 33 with the support of 20
percent of the white electorate.
   Another election will be held in one rural district because of a
tie between Conservative and National Party candidates, officials
said.
   De Klerk said emphasis must be ``on intensive dialogue, and
hopefully from that must flow real negotiations'' with blacks.
   In Washington, the State Department issued a statement that
congratulated De Klerk on his party's victory, then said:
``Apartheid must end. The elections themselves once more underscore
the systematic denial of political rights to the majority population
in South Africa. ... Promises of reform must be followed by
concrete, specific action.''
   Elections for the mixed-race and Indian chambers also were held
Wednesday, but anti-apartheid activists urged a boycott and fewer
than 10 percent of voters turned out in some districts.
   The Mass Democratic Movement, which organized a nationwide
defiance campaign in the past several weeks, said about 3 million
people joined a general strike Wednesday. It claimed ``more people
participated in our protest action against the racist elections than
voted.''

   A man climbed over a safety barrier inside the dome
of St. Paul's Cathedral and leapt 105 feet to his death Thursday, a
witness said.
   The cathedral was filled with tourists, when the unidentified man
plummeted from the dome's Whispering Gallery onto metal folding
chairs.
   French student Jacques Peyrou, who saw it, said there was no time
for anyone to act.
   Peyrou, 23, from Paris, said he was standing about 15 feet from
the man, who he said was about 50 years old.
   ``I looked up and I could see a man climbing over the barrier.
Very quickly he then leapt over. There was no chance for anyone to
grab him or stop him.''
   Several fatal falls have occurred from the gallery and safety
barriers were built after one such incident in the 19th century. The
last previous fatality came in the 1920s, according to the dean of
St. Paul's, the Very Rev. Eric Evans.
   The round Whispering Gallery is a special attraction at the
cathedral _ Sir Chrisopher Wren's 17th-century masterpiece. Sound is
reflected off the walls and a whisper can be heard clearly more than
100 feet away.

   Police once again are hunting for Zbigniew
Najmrodzki who made his fourth prison break through a tunnel dug
under the penitentiary courtyard, PAP news agency said Thursday.
   Najmrodzki, 35, was awaiting trial for assault and burglary in
Gliwice, southern Poland, when he escaped on Saturday, PAP said.
   It said he was taking a routine half-hour walk in the prison
courtyard when he disappeared underground into the camouflaged
entrance to a tunnel running 18 feet under the prison wall to a
nearby school.
   Najmrodzki's accomplices had even installed electric lighting in
the tunnel, the report said, adding that the tunnel led to a
schoolroom and from there he disappeared into heavy street traffic.
   Najmrodzki ``never quite got used to the idea of serving his
prison terms,'' PAP said.
   It said hefirst escaped in 1978 while being transported in a
military convoy; escaped from a court while on trial in 1980, and
knocked down a guard and walked out of a police station dressed in
police uniform in 1985.
   He was caught each time, but the agency gave no details as to how.

<HEAD>Former Congressman Released from Jail</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Former Rep. John Jenrette was released from
jail Thursday after serving a 30-day sentence for stealing a necktie
and shoes from a suburban Washington discount store, his attorney
said.
   ``He was released in a normal procedure. He will begin performing
community service soon,'' said attorney Stephen Merril.
   Jenrette, 53, was sentenced to the jail time and 200 hours of
community service last month on convictionm of two counts of petty
larceny for shoplifting at a Marshall's discount department store in
nearby Tyson's Corner last Dec. 7.
   The former South Carolina Democratic congressman also was placed
on on two year's probation and ordered to continue psychiatric and
alcoholism treatments.
   At his sentencing, Jenrette said he was sorry, and didn't know
why he stole the items. ``I can only say that I'll never be back.
Why I let this happen, I don't know,'' he said.
   Jenrette also said the conviction dashed his hopes of regaining
his licenswe to practice law.
   Jenrette, a member of Congress from 1975 to 1980, served 13
months in prison after his conviction on bribery and conspiracy
charges in the ABSCAM congressional sting operation of the 1970s. In
that case, FBI agents posing as oil-rich sheiks offered bribes to
members of Congress.
   As Jenrette is still on probation in that case, he will likely
face a hearing before a federal probation board to assess the latest
conviction, Merril said. But no hearing has been scheduled, he added.

   Two Soviet cosmonauts successfully completed a
series of maneuvers on board their Soyuz TM-8 spacecraft early
Friday to dock up with the Mir orbiting complex, the official news
agency Tass said.
   Tass said the Soyuz capsule hooked up with the space station at
2:25 a.m. Moscow time (6:25 p.m. EDT Thursday), five minutes later
than scheduled.
   The cosmonauts carried out two manuevers earlier Thursday to
bring their craft close to the space station, Tass said.
   ``Everything is in order on board, and the cosmonauts feel
well,'' Tass said.
   Commander Alexander S. Viktorenko and engineer Alexander A.
Serebrov blasted off from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Soviet Central
Asia early Wednesday to reman the space station after it was left
vacant for more than four months.
   Along with the cosmonauts, scientists are sending up two modules
to increase the amount of living space at the space station and
upgrade its scientific capabilities.
   Viktorenko and Serebrov are to remain in orbit six months.
   Their mission was delayed because the new modules were not ready
and because of sharp public discussion that has surfaced in the
Soviet Union over expenditures for space exploration at a time when
the country is running a high budget deficit and seeking ways to
improve supplies of many consumer goods.

<HEAD>Southern Command Accuses Panama of Jamming Radio, TV</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELOY O. AGUILAR</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>QUARRY HEIGHTS, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Southern Command on
Thursday accused Panama's Defense Forces of jamming English-language
radio and television broadcasts aimed at the American military based
in Panama.
   It said in a communique that the jamming ``could potentially
thwart U.S. Forces' Canal defense missions or endanger military and
civilian personnel if it prevented the reception of emergency
Command advisories.''
   Repeated telephone calls to Defense Forces spokesmen for comment
were unavailing.
   Jamming occurs when there are news reports about Panama or
related stories, a Southern Command official said.
   The Command's TV station Southern Command Network carries local,
national and international news and programs for the U.S. forces and
their dependents in Panama. The signal is beamed from a hill in the
former U.S. Canal Zone and can be received up to 50 miles away.
   No opposition news media are allowed in Panama.
   The Southern Command encompasses 10 military installations where
nearly 14,000 soldiers and their dependents are based.
   Under terms of the 1977 Panama Canal Treaties, the bases may
remain until the end of 1999, when Panama takes full responsibility
for operation and defense of the waterway.
   Panamanian-U.S. relations have been tense since two U.S. grand
juries indicted Pnama's leader Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega on drug
trafficking charges in February 1988.
   The Southern Command also complained of jamming of its TV
programs before and after the May 7 presidential election.
   At the time, the Panamanian government denied it was jamming the
broadcasts.
   International observers said the opposition won the election,
which Noriega had annulled.
   As Defense Forces chief, he is the most powerful man in Panama.
   Hundreds of university students staged a brief anti-government
protest Thursday by forming a human chain on campus, but no
incidents occurred. They were protesting the arrest of three
students during disturbances last month.

   Two masked men trying to hold up an armored
car opened fire inside Bank of America's world headquarters
Thursday, killing one guard and wounding two other men before
fleeing on 10-speed bicycles.
   An intensive search of the city's crowded financial district,
involving police, FBI agents, transit police and the California
Highway Patrol, was launched for the pair, dressed in blue jeans and
baseball caps.
   Brink's Inc. offered a $100,000 reward for information leading to
the apprehension of the suspects, described as white males in their
30s, said the armored car company's corporate vice-president, Buck
Crebs.
   An empty Brink's bag was found at the scene and some envelopes,
their contents unknown, were missing, said officer David Ambrose.
Neither authorities nor the bank would immediately release details
on what might have been stolen.
   ``It looks like a well-planned, well-orchestrated robbery,'' said
Deputy Chief Larry Gurnett.
   Ambrose said the ski-masked bandits apparently entered the
52-story building shortly before 10 a.m. through a sidewalk-level
door on California Street, while the Brink's guards entered on Pine
Street, a parallel street on the opposite side of the building.
   The four apparently met near the rear indoor entrance to the
city's main Bank of America branch. The robbers opened fire, hitting
both guards, said Ambrose.
   Robert Gee, 57, of San Francisco, apparently tried to intervene
and also was shot, said Ambrose.
   Brink's identified the dead guard as Joseph San Arriola, 53, of
Vallejo, Calif. The father of six children, Arriola was a five-year
veteran of the company. He suffered gunshot wounds to the face and
the back of the head.
   The other wounded guard was identified as Clifford Spencer, 24, a
part-time Brink's employee who started working for the company 2{
months ago.
   Spencer underwent surgery to remove a bullet that entered above
the left eyebrow, ricocheted off the skull and entered the upper
spine, hospital officials said. He was in serious condition with
paralysis on his left side before surgery, hospital spokeswoman
Gloria Rodriguez said.
   Gee was wounded in the mouth, she said. He was listed in fair
condition.
   Judy Adami, owner of The Smoke Shop, on the same floor but out of
sight of the bank entrance, said Gee collapsed at her stand, but was
conscious and asked for help.
   ``He said, `There's been a robbery. I've been shot. I'm hurt,'
and his teeth were all out,'' she said. Gee gave Adami, and later
police, a description of the robbers before he was taken for medical
treatment.
   Bank of America is a subsidiary of BankAmerica Corp., one of the
nation's largest banking concerns. The building is the city's
largest in terms of square feet.

   Officials of two dozen Western nations
will hold a conference Sept. 26 on ways to provide badly needed
economic aid to Poland and Hungary, the European Community said
Thursday.
   More than 100 officials met last month at the 12-nation trading
bloc's Brussels headquarters for an initial assessment of the need
and of aid available for the two reform-minded communist nations.
   A spokesman for the European Community, who demanded anonymity,
said the conference would consider aid programs already begun and
that another high-level meeting may be scheduled for later this year.
   President Bush and leaders of other affluent democracies asked
during their annual economic summit in July that the EC coordinate
economic aid for Poland and Hungary.
   Western nations want to encourage the trend toward economic and
political reform in both countries.
   The European Community said it began emergency shipments of beef
to Poland this week and half the total of 10,000 tons was expected
to arrive next week. It is part of a $120 million food aid package
for Poland agreed to in July by agriculture ministers of the 12
Common Market countries.
   Poland is being given the food under an arrangement that allows
the government to sell it to consumers and use the money to improve
private agriculture.
   According to the spokesman, a delegation from the trading bloc
will visit Poland and Hungary soon for further discussions. In
Warsaw, the officials are expected to sign a recently completed
agreement on expanding trade and cooperation between Poland and the
European Community over five years.
   At last month's meeting on Poland and Hungary, the United States
pledged to send Poland $50 million worth of food from surplus stocks.
   In July, President Wojciech Jaruzelski said Poland needed 685,000
tons of beef, pork, powdered milk, butter, oils, wheat, corn, rice
and sugar in the next few months. He said it would need at least 3.7
million tons of food next year and again in 1991.

   Five U.S. technicians came to Brazil at
government request on Thursday to help investigate why a Brazilian
jetliner crashed far off course in the Amazon jungle, killing at
least 10 of the 54 people aboard.
   Varig airlines President Helio Smidt did not rule out the
possibility of pilot error.
   ``I would be very happy if human failure could be ruled out,'' he
told reporters Thursday. ``But we do not want to jump to
conclusions.''
   The pilot, Cesar Garces, 32, did not speak with the press after
arriving in Brasilia on Wednesday.
   Sixteen survivors of the Sunday night crash left the hospital on
Thursday. Of the 35 survivors treated at the Brasilia Base hospital,
21 now have been released and two remain in the intensive care unit,
a doctor said.
   Reports conflicted on the number of dead. Air force officials
reported 10 dead. A Varig spokesman listed 11 deaths.
   The Boeing 737-200 vanished Sunday night on the last leg of a
flight between Sao Paulo and Belem, at the mouth of the Amazon River.
   After six scheduled stops, the plane took off from Maraba at 5:25
p.m. for what was supposed to be a 41-minute flight to Belem.
   But the plane strayed far off course, circled above dense
tropical jungle for three hours, then crash-landed near Sao Jose do
Xingu, in north-central Mato Grosso state, with just 15 minutes of
fuel left, authorities said.
   Brazilian investigators reached the crash site on Wednesday and
began a search for the plane's flight registers, which log flight
patterns, pilot conversations and other data.
   The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board sent five experts
who arrived Thursday in Brasilia, the capital, and later left for
the crash site. Americans involved in the investigation include an
adviser from the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration and three
experts from the Seattle-based Boeing Co.
   The local press reported Thursday that a malfunction in the
plane's navigational system was possible, but experts reportedly
said the pilot could have used a magnetic compass in the instrument
panel.
   Surivivor Epaminondas de Sousa Chaves, 36, said Wednesday that
soon after takeoff from Maraba, the pilot ``began heading southeast
instead of north.''
   ``Thirty minutes later the pilot told us to prepare for the
landing, but I know the area well and I thought it was strange to
see that we were flying above a river with waterfalls and small
islands,'' said Chaves.
   At least three other survivors interviewed by The Associated
Press agreed with Chaves' account.
   Two other survivors, Rita de Cassia and Elza Gasparim, said the
plane at one point descended as if it were going to land, then
pulled up sharply after dark forest cover was sighted below.
   Chaves said the pilot announced over the intercom, ``Pray to God
and pray that we will find a place to land. There are only 15
minutes of fuel left.''
   The plane's belly clipped the top of the 100-foot-high trees, the
aircraft ``seemed to bounce,'' then smashed through the forest
cover, ripping off both wings but leaving the fuselage nearly
intact, he said.
   The plane ripped a hole 300 feet by 120 feet in the jungle, but
did not explode, Chaves said.

   The Senate, forced to choose between preserving
its members' mass-mailing privileges and approving aid for drug
rehabilitation programs, voted overwhelmingly Thursday to give $45
million to help addicted pregnant women, mothers and infants.
   Faced with a recorded vote on whether to slash money for
unsolicited mailings, the Senate decided 83-8 to approve the
amendment, which was attached to a $2 billion legislative-expense
budget for fiscal 1990.
   It was the first such assistance measure acted upon by either
chamber since President Bush announced his $7.9 billion anti-drug
abuse campaign Tuesday.
   Republicans, led by Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif., proposed the
measure Wednesday. It was aimed at transferring to drug treatment
programs a large sum of money from the account legislators use for
their mailings.
   The Senate gave the overall legislative appropriations bill final
passage on an 81-9 vote late Thursday. The measure will have to be
reconciled with a $1.6 billion House-passed version.
   The Senate measure virtually eliminates district-wide mailings
used often by senators and representatives to keep their names
before their constituents, but allows them to continue answering
individual queries.
   Sen. David Boren, D-Okla., told colleagues the bulk of the money
used for mass mailings is spent by senators seeking to bolster their
chances for re-election. He said that was wrong.
   ``We're approaching some $70 million a year on mass mailings to
the public that have not been solicited ... figures show a much
higher percentage of the mass mailings are by those who are up for
re-election,'' he said.
   Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, led the opposition, saying
mass-mailed newsletters were indispensable tools of communication
with his constituents.
   But Wilson said, ``This is an opportunity for Congress to do
something about something we have talked about,'' he said. ``So,
let's begin to break the habit and let's begin to help those who
need help.''
   Also voting against the amendment were Sens. Bill Bradley,
D-N.J.; Ernest Hollings, D-S.C.; Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii; Joseph
Lieberman, D-Conn.; Spark Matsunaga, D-Hawaii; Daniel Patrick
Moynihan, D-N.Y. and Paul Simon, D-Ill.
   Bradley and Simon are the only two of the eight who are up for
re-election next year. Nine senators did not vote: Brock Adams,
D-Wash., William Armstrong, R-Colo., Max Baucus, D-Mont., Conrad
Burns, R-Mont., James McClure, R-Idaho, Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska,
William Roth, R-Del., Terry Sanford, D-N.C., and James Sasser,
D-Tenn.
   The money would go to a program started in 1988 that provides
treatment to drug-addicted pregnant women, mothers and infants,
focusing on crack. Wilson said 400,000 babies are born annually to
mothers who use drugs.
   Without Wilson's amendment, the legislative spending bill would
have limited congressional spending on mail next year to $80
million: $48 million for the House, which has 435 members, and $32
million for the 100-member Senate.
   The Wilson amendment slashes the total for both chambers from $80
billion to $35 million. The bulk of that money would be used to
cover a shortfall in mailing expenses for the current budget year,
which ends Sept. 30, leaving little mass-mailing money for fiscal
1990, which starts Oct. 1.
   The House-passed bill seeks to allocate $124.7 million for all
congressional mailing privileges in the new budget year.
   The nine senators voting against the overall $2 billion measure
were: William Armstrong, R-Colo.; Kent Conrad, D-S.D.; Alan Dixon,
D-Ill.; Jake Garn, R-Utah; Jesse Helms, R-N.C.; Connie Mack, R-Fla.;
Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.; Steve Symms, R-Idaho; Malcolm Wallop, R-Wyo.
   Not voting were Brock Adams, D-Wash., Max Baucus, D-Mont., Conrad
Burns, R-Mont., John Glenn, D-Ohio, Trent Lott, R-Miss., Howard
Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, William Roth, R-Del.,
Terry Sanford, D-N.C., and James Sasser, D-Tenn.

   Summer warmth and humidity prevailed Thursday across the Gulf
Coast states and from the southern Plains to the Great Lakes, while
heavy rains drenched parts of Iowa.
   Scattered showers and thundstorms hit Florida, southeast Georgia,
parts of Louisiana and coastal Texas, as well as Iowa, eastern South
Dakota and southern Minnesota. There were also a few showers in the
central Appalachians.
   In southwest Iowa, thunderstorms brought 5-6 inches of rain
Thursday morning to parts of southern Adams and northern Taylor
counties. Some small streams overflowed in the area and streets were
flooded in Corning.
   Wind gusts reached 44 mph around Yankton, S.D., as thunderstorms
dumped heavy rain.
   Heavier rainfall during the six hours ending at 2 p.m. EDT
included almost 2 inches at Brunswick, Ga., and more than half an
inch in Iowa at Spencer, Des Moines and Sioux City.
   A cold front extended from the upper Mississippi Valley across
the central Plains to the Great Basin area. Cool autumnlike weather
settled into the northern Rockies and northern high Plains under a
high pressure ridge that extended from western Canada to Montana.
   Sunshine prevailed Thursday afternoon from the Rockies to the
West Coast, while partly cloudy skies dominated the East.
   Hurricane Gabrielle continued to move northward, well to the east
of Bermuda. Heavy surf advisories continue from North Carolina to
New York.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 54
degrees at Winnemucca, Nev., to 102 degrees at Imperial, Calif. The
low in the nation Thursday morning was 27 degrees at Truckee,
Calif., and Butte, Mont.
   Friday's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms from
Michigan and northern Ohio across the upper half of the Mississippi
Valley to the northern and central Great Plains; showers and
thunderstorms scattered across the southern Plains, the lower
Mississippi Valley and Florida; rainshowers in the northern Rockies,
and western sections of New York and Pennsylvania.
   Predicted high temperatures were in the 60s along portions of the
California coast, and from the northern Rockies across North Dakota
to northwest Minnesota; 50s in some locations in western Montana and
northwest Wyoming; 90s from Florida across the Gulf coastal states,
the lower Tennessee, lower Ohio and middle Mississippi valleys, the
southern Plains and southern New Mexico to interior valleys of
California and southwest Oregon; near 100 degrees in the Big Bend
area of southwest Texas, and between 100 and 110 degrees in the
desert Southwest. Elsewhere, highs will be in the 70s and 80s.

<HEAD>Study: Divorce Rates Higher When Wives Better Educated Than Husbands</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Married couples are more likely to
divorce if the woman has more education than her husband, a study
concludes.
   The study found that the divorce rate for marriages in which the
wife has more schooling than her husband is over 50 percent higher
than it is for marriages in which the husband has the same or higher
educational achievement.
   ``Apparently many men and women have not been socialized to
accept the notion of a woman being educationally more accomplished
than her husband,'' said Neil G. Bennett, an associate professor of
sociology at Yale University, who led the study.
   That women are better able to support themselves and less fearful
of going it alone, could account for the higher rate of divorce,
Bennett said.
   ``We might have expected that couples who had very different
levels of education, regardless of which spouse had the higher
education, would have higher divorce rates than average because
these couples would have different world views and be subject to
greater conflict and stress in their marriage.
   ``But that was not true. We found only couples in which the wife
was more educated than the husband had higher divorce rates than
average,'' Bennett said in an interview Wednesday.
   In the United States, about half of all marriages today will end
in divorce.
   Bennett's study has not been published, but the results were
presented last month at the American Sociological Association in San
Francisco.
   The study was based on data from nearly 3,500 married or divorced
women under age 50, collected by the National Survey of Families and
Households between March 1987 and May 1988.
   Bennett received widespread attention three years ago when he
concluded that single, college-educated women over age 30 had only a
20 percent chance of getting married. A Census Bureau researcher,
studying the same statistics, disputed his findings, and said those
same women actually have a 66 percent chance of eventually marrying.
   Bennett has done a new study on the same subject with more recent
data, but the results will not be made public until they are
published in November.
   In looking at divorce rates, the Yale researchers also examined
the effects of religious differences on marriages. Not unexpectedly,
they found that divorce rates are higher for couples in interfaith
marriages.
   When a wife and husband have different religion, but both are not
very religious, the divorce rate is not much different from the
average, the study found.
   To study the effect of educational differences, the women and men
were placed in four different educational categories: those with
less than a high school education, those with a high school
education, those with some college education and those with at least
a college degree.
   Bennett emphasized that men and women who marry someone who has a
substantially different education, religous belief or age are
generally less traditional than those who marry people with similar
characteristics, and may therefore have less conventional views
about marriage to begin with. Such factors, however, cannot be
measured.

   Sevens whites accused of killing a black
teen-ager in the mostly white Bensonhurst district will be tried
before a black judge whose assignment bypassed the usual selection
process, court officials said Thursday.
   Justice Thaddeus Owens, 70, was selected by a panel of judges and
court administrators last week because of his experience and his
ability to handle cases receiving a lot of publicity, said Matthew
T. Crosson, chief administrator of the state court system.
   Owens' race played no part in the selection, Crosson said.
   Owens was named solely because of his judicial excellence, Court
of Appeals Chief Judge Sol Wachtler, who oversees court
administration, told the New York Post, which first reported the
selection in its Thursday editions.
   The judge had no comment on his appointment or on the case, his
clerk said.
   Lawyers for the young white men charged in the Aug. 23 attack
greeted the announcement with mixed reactions.
   The attorney for the accused shooter said he might file a motion
to block it. David DePetris, who represents 18-year-old Joseph Fama,
said he objected ``not because of the judge that was selected but
because it may violate my client's rights.''
   Fama, who is being held without bail in the Brooklyn House of
Detention, has been charged with murder in the attack and is
suspected of firing the shots that killed 16-year-old Yusuf Hawkins.
   Hawkins and three of his friends had gone to the mostly white
Brooklyn neighborhood to look at a used car when they were set upon
by a gang of some 30 bat-carrying whites, the police said.
   Seven young white men who allegedly took part in the attack have
been arrested and the police say they expect to pick up other
suspects.
   Michael L. Santangelo, the lawyer for 21-year-old Charles
Stressler, labeled the selection ``indiscreet, insensitive and
illegal.''
   However, Albert C. Aronne, lawyer for 19-year-old Joseph Serrano,
praised the selection, as did Mathew J. Mari, the attorney for
18-year-old Steven Curreri.
   ``I've known Thaddeus Owens for a number of years and have tried
a number of cases before him. He is a good man and a good judge,''
Aronne said. ``He's tough and we need someone tough who calls it the
way he sees it.''
   Judges usually are selected at random or specialize in certain
types of cases. But for trials expected to generate high interest or
controversy, court officials frequently handpick whomever they
believe most suited to handle the case, Crosson said.

<TEXT>
   The non-aligned movement ended its
ninth summit conference early Friday after adopting a resolution
calling for the release of all hostages.
   The four-day conference of 102 nations was attended by about 50
heads of state and a dozen prime ministers. It was due to end
Thursday, but delays brought on by wrangling between hard-liners and
moderates kept the summit going until after 1 a.m. Friday.
   The session passed a final declaration and adopted 30 political
and economic resolutions dealing with topics ranging from
Afghanistan and the Middle East to terrorism and drugs trafficking.
   Many of them were compromise resolutions, reflecting the deep
divisions among members.
   The ``international terrorism'' resolution was agreed upon by the
meeting's political committee after tough bargaining.
   It said the heads of state and government ``resolutely demanded
that all hostages and all kidnapped persons be immediately released
... irrespective of the perpetrators and the place of the crime.''
   The resolution condemned all acts of terrorism perpetrated by
individuals, states or groups of states and expressed the movement's
determination to fight such acts ``with all possible legal means,
both nationally and internationally.''
   Yugoslav spokesman Goran Milic indicated in a meeting with
reporters at midnight that the final session was delayed about 5{
hours by disputes.
   Pleas for pragmatism and cooperation with the industrialized
world contrasted with strident attacks on the United States. Several
delegates denounced ``Zionism'' in their speeches, a topic that
caused problems to the very end.
   Chairman Yasser Arafat of the Palestine Liberation Organization
insisted that in addition to the final document's stressing the
``struggle against imperialism, colonialism, neo-colonialism, racism
and apartheid,'' it should also condemn ``Zionism and its
practices.''
   Heated arguments with moderates followed, with Arafat drawing
support from such hard-liners as Bangladesh, Yemen and Cuba. A
compromise was reached on including the ``Zionism'' reference in one
of the many political resolutions, sources told The Associated
Press, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Nicaragua, in a bid to gain international prestige, sought to get
the summit to agree to hold its next summit there, but no agreement
was reached, conference sources said.
   Delegates did agree, however, that Ghana would be the site for a
non-aligned foreign ministers' conference to be held in 1991 in
preparation of the 10th non-aligned summit.
   Moderates have emerged as the big majority and resisted
throughout the summit attempts by radical nations to introduce cold
war rhetoric.
   Yugoslav President Janez Drnovsek told the closing session, ``We
have achieved a high degree of unity about what the future of our
movement should be.''

   A 30-year-old woman who was raped, beaten, stabbed
and left to die in a crawl space of her burning home used her blood
to scrawl the attacker's name on a wall, and police Thursday
arrested her next-door neighbor. The woman, described by police as
``very, very brave,'' also cut her way out of the burning house with
the knife that stabbed her and scaled a six-foot wall to escape,
police said.
   She was in fair condition Thursday after undergoing surgery at
Denver General Hospital to repair sliced tendons in her right wrist.
   ``She's alert and awake ... but still is very frightened because
this person is still at large as far as I know,'' said Lisa Duchon,
a hospital spokeswoman.
   Donnie E. Russell, 18, who has lived next door to the victim for
about two years, was arrested at a truck stop in Oklahoma City at
4:20 p.m. MDT, said Oklahoma City police Sgt. Don Matthews.
   ``We got a teletype from the Oklahoma City police saying that
Donnie Russell had told them he was wanted for rape, arson and
attempted murder in Denver,'' said Denver Detective Christine Wallis.
   Matthews said police in Oklahoma City had gotten an anonymous
phone call that Russell would be coming through the city trying to
contact relatives.
   Wallis said extradition procedures would be started Friday.
   The woman's ordeal began Wednesday morning when she let Russell
into her home to use a telephone, police said.
   She was robbed of jewelry and money and raped in the basement,
Wallis said. She was beaten about the head with a hammer, stabbed in
the arm and hand and left in the crawl space, which had been closed
off with furniture. Her home then was set afire.
   The woman managed to write, ``Donnie, next door,'' in blood on
the wall before she kicked her way out of the crawl space, Wallis
said.
   She then used the foot-long knife that she had been stabbed with
to break the basement window and then scaled a 6-foot fence in her
backyard, screaming for help, police said.
   ``She is a very brave, gutsy woman,'' Wallis said Thursday after
interviewing the victim in her hospital room. ``She at one point
feigned unconsciousness and grabbed the knife from him.''
   The residents in the middle-class northeast Denver neighborhood
didn't know whether she was in trouble or looking for it. ``People
didn't want to get involved,'' Wallis said.
   But one woman, who asked not to be identified, telephoned police
after hearing the victim scream, ``Help me. Somebody help me.''
   ``I looked out the window to make sure it wasn't some kids
playing around. I saw her climbing over the fence with a knife in
her hand. I went and called the police,'' the neighbor said.
   ``She was disheveled, beat up, bloody, half-dressed. She looked
crazy. Now that I've heard what happened, I guess I would be crazy,
too,'' the neighbor said.
   After the incident, Wallis left her business card in Russell's
front door and he called her later in the day. He promised to go to
police headquarters and answer questions, but never arrived, she
said.
   He lives with an uncle, and Wallis said both the uncle and the
victim's husband were shocked to learn that he was a suspect in the
attack.

   The 25-year-old sailor accused of causing the
USS Iowa explosion that killed 47 soliders grew up as a Seventh Day
Adventist and is remembered as a religious and devoted student.
   The Navy released a report Thursday that said gunner's mate
Clayton Hartwig ``most likely'' caused the April 19 explosion that
ranks as the worst U.S. naval disaster since the Viet Nam war.
   Hartwig attended Lakewood Seventh Day Adventist Elementary school
and graduated from Mount Vernon Academy, a Seventh Day Adventist
school in Mount Vernon, Ohio.
   Seventh Day Adventists are vegetarians who neither smoke nor
drink alcohol and coffee. They attend church on Saturday and believe
in the second coming of Jesus Christ.
   Harvey Allison, maintenance director at of the co-educational
school of 140 students about 40 miles northeast of Columbus, said
Hartwig worked for him part of the day, doing manual tasks and
supervising students, and went to classes the other half of the day.
   ``He was religious and a devoted worker,'' Allison said Thursday.
``Whatever task he did, he did it efficiently _ he got good grades.''
   Allison said he did not believe the Navy's report. ``They got a
scapegoat. They have to blame it on someone and he is not here to
defend himself,'' Allison said.
   While attending the academy, Hartwig enjoyed camping and the
outdoors, but his heart was set on joining the Navy, Allison said.
   ``He went straight into the Navy (after graduation) because it
was his love. He came back once a year to see the students,''
Allison said.
   Hartwig's sister, Kathleen Kubicina, said Seventh Day Adventists
do not believe in violence or the firing of guns, but the family
allowed Hartwig to join the service because he had a great desire to
do so.
   Ms. Kubicina said Hartwig had a girlfriend, Charlene Meter, and
he wrote her a number of letters while he was aboard the Iowa.
   Copies of 11 letters written by Hartwig were provided to The
Associated Press by Ms. Kubicina. Ten were written to Ms. Meter and
one was written to his parents.
   ``For the last 6 yrs, all I've known is the Navy,'' wrote Clayton
in a Nov. 8 letter. ``I'm military through and through and at times
it's hard for me to get along with civilians.
   ``I guess it's like this. I have no idea what goes on in your
life in college. Your problems from day to day, your frustrations,
the people you can't stand, what you do. It's the same for you with
me. There's no way you could understand what it's like to live in a
cramped ship and be at sea for months at a time,'' he wrote.
   Following the explosion, at the request of the Navy, the FBI
Center for Anaylysis of Violent Crimes conducted a psychiatric study
and found that Hartwig was disturbed and under a lot of stress,
``virtually insuring some type of reaction. In this instance, it is
suicide.''
   Hartwig and gunner's mate Kendall Truitt, 21, each bought $50,000
life insurance policies from the Navy credit union just before the
Iowa left for the Persian Gulf in 1987.
   Truitt since has married and has denied suggestions he was
involved in a homosexual relationship with Hartwig.
   Hartwig's family rejects the enquiry's conclusion and is calling
for a congressional investigation into the Navy's handling of the
Iowa probe.

<HEAD>Woman Convicted in Slaying Of Lesbian Lover</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A woman who used the ``battered
spouse'' defense against charges she killed her lesbian lover was
convicted Thursday of second-degree murder.
   Annette Green, 30, was found guilty by a jury in the Oct. 30,
1988, shooting death of her 11-year lover, Ivonne Julio.
   The jury found that Ms. Green's shooting of Ms. Julio, 32, was
not premeditated, and decided on the lesser charge. Prosecutors had
sought a first-degree murder conviction, which could bring the death
penalty.
   The two-week trial was reportedly the first time a lesbian had
tried the ``battered spouse'' defense, which some women have
successfully used after slaying an abusive husband or lover.
   Ms. Green faces a 12- to 17-year prison term. Palm Beach Circuit
Judge Tom Waddell ordered a pre-sentencing investigation but set no
sentencing date.
   Defense Attorney William Lasley said in his closing argument
earlier Thursday that Ms. Julio beat and tormented Ms. Green for
years.
   Lasley made no statement after the verdict, and gave no immediate
indication whether he would appeal the ruling.
   Assistant State Attorney Robert Johnson told reporters afterwards
that he felt the case did not support use of the ``battered spouse''
syndrome.
   On Tuesday, Wadell ruled to allow the battered spouse defense in
the case. The judge said the type of relationship made no difference.
   Ms. Green testified in her own defense during the trial, saying
she ``never wanted to do anything to (Ms. Julio).''
   ``I was just trying to defend myself,'' she said.
   Ms. Green also testified that after she shot Ms. Julio following
an argument, she then held the gun to her own head.
   ``I was going to kill myself ... because I loved her,'' she said.

<TEXT>
   Quaker Oats Co. has duped consumers by
claiming its oatmeal can help reduce the risk of heart disease, the
Texas Attorney General's office said Thursday in suing the nation's
biggest seller of hot cereal.
   ``We are in the middle of an oat bran craze in this country that
was primarily started and prompted by Quaker in order to sell its
products,'' Attorney General Jim Mattox said at a news conference.
   ``Consumers have been duped. Quaker's claims are largely not
true,'' he said.
   Spokesmen for Chicago-based Quaker Oats defended the
advertisements, saying they feel the advertising is truthful and is
supported by scientific evidence.
   ``We expect to prevail in this litigation,'' said Luther C.
McKinney, senior vice president of law and corporate affairs for
Quaker Oats.
   In the lawsuit, filed on behalf of the Texas Department of Health
in a Dallas state district court, the state said Quaker Oats' ads as
``replete with exaggerations, half-truths, and misinformation.''
   One of those ads reads, ``Studies say that just two ounces of
Quaker Oats a day, along with a low-fat, low-cholesterol diet, can
help lower your cholesterol almost 10 percent. Other studies say
that's enough to reduce your risk of heart attack by nearly 20
percent.''
   The state claims Quaker's own tests showed that only a 3 percent
reduction in risk could be realized if oatmeal was added to a
low-fat, low-cholesterol diet. And that reduction applied only to
women if they ate 25 percent more oatmeal than Quaker recommends as
a regular serving, Mattox said.
   Mattox said Quaker Oats has ``a good product, but it's only
cereal. It's not a heart-attack preventative.''
   Ron Vottrell, a spokesman for Quaker Oats, said the ad was
cleared by the Federal Trade Commission, which reviewed it after
complaints were lodged by the Center for Science in the Public
Interest, a Washington consumer rights group.
   The Texas lawsuit, filed under the Texas Deceptive Trade
Practices-Consumer Protection Act, asks the court to prohibit the
company from continuing its allegedly misleading ads and seeks
$10,000 in civil penalties and additional court and investigative
costs.
   Assistant Attorney General Stephen Gardner, who is prosecuting
the case, said the lawsuit is part of an ongoing examination of food
manufacturers' health claims.
   ``Quaker was not so much jumping on the health-claims bandwagon
as being the horse that was pulling it. We wanted to look first at
the companies that were responsible for creating a series of
outrageous claims about what their product can do for your health,''
he said.
   Mattox has recently taken on other giant food companies, such as
Campbell Soup Co., Sara Lee Corp. and Carnation Co., saying they
have engaged in false advertising. The companies all deny the claims.

   Singer La Toya Jackson denied Thursday that she
married her manager in a quiet civil ceremony here, saying an
imposter had signed her name to Washoe County court wedding
documents.
   ``It could have been an imposter,'' Ms. Jackson said in a
telephone interview with The Associated Press. ``It's totally untrue
that I got married. I'm not ready for marriage yet. I'm too involved
in my career right now.''
   Washoe County Clerk Judi Bailey on Thursday produced marriage
license No. D044127 purchased Tuesday by La Toya Jackson, 33, and
Jack Gordon, 50, and said the couple went through a legal wedding
ceremony that night.
   ``They had to show their driver's licenses and tell the clerk all
kinds of information in order to prove who they were,'' Ms. Bailey
said. ``They even had to know their mothers' maiden name and where
she was born. And where their father was born.
   ``She got married right here in the Washoe County Commission
chambers. When they say `I do' before a witness and the deputy
marriage commissioner then they're married.''
   Ms. Jackson had been in the gambling city to perform a concert at
Bally's Reno that is scheduled to be televised later on pay
television, and which kicked off her world tour produced by Gordon.
   ``I was surprised when I heard about it,'' Ms. Jackson said. ``I
have no idea why someone would say that.''
   According to Washoe County Court documents, it was the second
marriage for Gordon, a Springfield, Ill., native who was divorced in
1982, and the first marriage for Ms. Jackson, a native of Gary, Ind.
   Ms. Jackson said her relationship with Gordon is ``strictly
professional.''
   ``He's a great man but not a person I'd settle down with,'' she
said.
   Ms. Jackson moved out of her parents' home in May after an
apparent rift developed between her and her family because of her
relationship with Gordon, a former carnival operator and Las Vegas
businessman.
   The rift is only one of several that has reportedly kept Ms.
Jackson at odds with her family in the past year.
   She posed nude in the January issue of Playboy which ran a
12-page spread on the sister of pop recording star Michael Jackson.
   And her family has reportedly been trying to get her to tone down
an alleged ``tell-all'' autobiography scheduled to be published next
year.

   The Energy Department said Thursday it will put
one of the two plants producing uranium fuel for naval reactors on
standby because less fuel is needed nowadays.
   The plant being mothballed is at the Savannah River site in South
Carolina, where some 600 afffected employees will be absorbed into
other projects.
   The only other plant producing fuel for reactors that drive
nuclear powered warships is operated by Nuclear Fuel Services Inc.
at Erwin, Tenn. The department said the Erwin plant could supply the
Navy's entire needs.
   ``The projected demand for fuel no longer justifies the cost of
operating two facilities,'' the department said in a statement.
   Several reasons were given for reduced demand, among them:
   _Reactor core design and manufacturing are getting better,
permitting cores to last longer and reducing the need for refueling,
and reducing the amount of fuel needed for a core in the first place.
   _The Navy has reduced its projected building plans for
nuclear-powered warships.

<TEXT>
   The brother-in-law of Mexico's former
president was indicted on perjury charges Thursday, nearly a month
after he was taken into custody for questioning as a material
witness in the slaying of a U.S. drug agent.
   Ruben Zuno Arce, 59, was accused in the indictment of lying when
he told a federal grand jury in Los Angeles that he did not know two
alleged Mexican drug figures charged in the killing of DEA agent
Enrique Camarena.
   In his grand jury testimony, he apparently denied knowing Rafael
Caro Quintero and Ernesto Fonseca Carrillo.
   Zuno, a prominent Mexican businessman, was arrested Aug. 9 in San
Antonio by U.S. immigration officials and brought to Los Angeles to
testify as a material witness in the 1985 killing of Camarena.
   But a judge Tuesday found that Zuno was not a material witness
and ordered him released. The order, however, was blocked by U.S.
Immigration and Naturalization Service officials on grounds that
Zuno is an alleged drug trafficker.
   Zuno, brother of the wife of former Mexican President Luis
Echeverria, was taken back to San Antonio, where he was being held
on an immigration warrant.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Manuel Medrano denied the indictment was
an attempt to keep Zuno in the United States.
   ``The indictment speaks for itself. ... He was indicted because
he lied under oath,'' said Medrano.
   Zuno's attorney, Edward Medvene, could not immediately be reached
for comment in a telephone call made to his office after business
hours.
   In the past, Medvene has contended his client is not a drug
trafficker but a legitimate businessman and that the U.S. government
has illegally detained him.
   Medvene has said Zuno merely had the misfortune of having a house
that was sold to Caro, a reputed drug who allegedly masterminded
Camerena's murder in that house.
   Camarena and his pilot, Alfredo Zavala Avelar, were killed after
the agent led a series of raids on marijuana plantations allegedly
operated by Caro.
   Camarena's body was found March 5, 1985, on a ranch 65 miles
southeast of Guadalajara. He had been tortured before his death.
   Zuno testified before a grand jury last month, and authorities
had wanted him to testify in the upcoming trial of Juan Jose Bernabe
Ramirez, a former Mexican state police officer charged in Camarena's
killing.
   Three people have been convicted in the case, and six others,
aside from Bernabe, are under indictment.
   Caro is being held in Mexico City, awaiting trial.

   Salvador's leftist rebels on Thursday

the rightist government to respond in kind to create ``a serious
climate'' for peace negotiations.
   The Marxist-led rebel coalition announced no time or date for the
talks and said differences over a mediator still clouded prospects
for a dialogue.
   Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani called the announcement
encouraging and suggested the first meeting be held in Mexico Sept.
12-13.
   He said that as a gesture of good will, his administration will
let dozens of wounded guerrilla prisoners leave El Salvador for
treatment elsewhere.
   Cristiani spoke to reporters Thursday in San Salvador, his
capital, at a ceremony during which he named four lawyers and a
military officer to represent the government at peace talks.
   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler
said the United States is pleased about the prospect of the first
Salvadoran peace talks in two years.
   ``President Cristiani called for dialogue in his inaugural
address, and we believe it is time for the FMLN to realize that
democracy and violence do not mix,'' she said.
   She said the development is a tribute to the resolve Congress has
shown in reaffirming continued U.S. aid to El Salvador and for
observance of human rights standards.
   FMLN leaders told a news conference in Mexico City that rebel
fighters will stop sabotaging telephone and electrical facilities
and stop planting land mines and booby traps at midnight Sunday.
   ``The FMLN will maintain these unilateral measures during a
sufficiently prudent time for the armed forces and the government to
take corresponding steps that will contribute to creating a serious
climate for negotiation,'' said a rebel communique read to the
reporters.
   The leaders would not say what constitutes ``sufficiently
prudent.''
   The communique accused the government and its armed forces of
bombing civilian areas; using mines and booby traps; arresting and
torturing students, workers and other activists, and attacking
journalists.
   It said this must stop and the government must suspend the draft
and must allow the immediate, unrestricted return of all refugees.
   The communique said a positive government response would
``demonstrate a real will for peace.''
   No immediate response came from the government.
   The FMLN has fought a series of U.S.-backed Salvadoran
governments for nearly 10 years. The war has killed about 70,000
people, most of them civilian.

   Colombia replaced the mayors of two towns
with army officers in cocaine regions Thursday, but then rescinded
its action after an outcry that the moves were unconstitutional and
antidemocratic.
   The development was the latest wrinkle in this South American
country's fierce anti-narcotics campaign.
   Two bombs exploded Thursday in a pedestrian mall in the drug
center of Medellin, injuring two policemen.
   In Bogota, cattle rancher Jaime Castillo Franco was shot to death
Thursday by two men while driving in the capital. The killers sped
away and it was not known if the shooting was related to the drug
war.
   President Virgilio Barco used emergency anti-drug decrees late
Wednesday to name military officers to replace indefinitely the
elected mayors of Puerto Boyaca and Pacho, two towns believed to be
strongholds of drug kingpins.
   Puerto Boyaca, 95 miles north of Bogota, has been a strongpoint
for right-wing death squads the government says are controlled by
cocaine cartels. The town is in a region believed rife with
cocaine-processing laboratories.
   The government also replaced the mayor of Pacho, 40 northeast of
the capital, saying it too is believed to be a strongpoint for drug
cartels.
   But civil libertarians and politicians vehemently accused the
government of exceeding its constitutional powers. Late Thursday,
Interior Minister Orlando Velasquez canceled the moves because of
``accusations that we are acting anti-democratically.''
   ``I will obey the order, but I don't agree with it,'' Puerto
Boyaca's mayor, Marino Estrada, had told the Radio Caracol. ``They
must have their reasons but I don't know what they are. Everything
has been calm here.''
   The war between drug cartels and government broke out Aug. 18
when assassins believed to be paid by the drug lords killed the
front-running presidential candidate, Sen. Luis Carlos Galan, a
strong foe of drug dealing.
   The private National Radio Network chain and a police spokesman
reported two bombs blew up in a crowded outdoor Medellin mall,
extensively damaging several shops. One bomb was left in a sports
duffle bag under a table in a fast-food restaurant, police said.
   ``By luck, there weren't any more injuries,'' said the police
spokesman, who spoke on condition of not being identified.
   Telephoned warnings of bombs placed in buildings in Barranquilla
forced evacuation Thursday of several government offices and banks,
including the Venezuelan Embassy, Caracol said. No bombs were found.
   In this capital, about 500 students at the National University of
Bogota, shouting ``Gringos, go home!,'' burned a U.S. flag and threw
stones at journalists. University officials evacuated the campus and
suspended classes for the day. They said two students were slightly
hurt.
   The protest came one day after the extradition to Atlanta of
Colombian economist Eduardo Martinez Romero, 37, accused of being
one of the main money launderers for the Medellin cocaine cartel.
   Americans fled Colombia on Thursday fearing a deadly backlash by
the drug lords, who have said they would rather die in Colombia than
live in prison in the United States, and who have threatened to kill
10 judges for every Colombian drug suspect extradited.
   Shortly after Martinez's extradition, two men on a motorcycle
tossed a dynamite bomb at a bank in Medellin, 150 miles northwest of
Bogota, causing $45,000 damage but no injuries, police there told
The Associated Press. Another bomb damaged a Medellin warehouse
Wednesday night, but police said that might have been an act of
personal vengeance, not a drug reprisal.
   Along the 1,000-mile-long Venezuela-Colombia border, 12 U.S.
aircraft with sophisticated reconnaissance gear have begun
overflights of the mountainous Sierra de Perija terrain, observers
in Venezuela reported Thursday. The Indians living in the area said
this week that drug smugglers maintain a vast, 60,000-acre coca
plantation there. Cocaine is made from the coca leaf.
   Colombia's largest newspaper, El Tiempo, reported the crackdown
forced closure of some cocaine laboratories. It predicted a cocaine
shortage within a month in the United States, which gets 80 percent
of the drug from Colombia.
   The Supreme Court began debating whether the draconian state of
siege powers are legal. The opposition Conservative Party called
Barco's decision to impose military rule on violence-plagued towns
unconstitutional.
   Mayor Juan Gomez of Medellin said as long as he is carrying out
his legal duties, ``no one will remove me from this job.''
   Among Americans leaving were 20 families of employees of
U.S.-based Occidental Petroleum Co., which has been developing
Colombia's largest oil field, a source said Thursday on condition of
anonymity. He said they left Wednesday night.
   Three Americans playing on popular semi-pro basketball teams in
Medellin were also reported leaving.
   Ron Davis and Napoleon Petteway, both of New York City, playing
for the Banco Cafetero team, and Kenneth Garrett of Chicago, of the
Sprite squad, ``are returning to the United States right away,''
Jaime Arenas, president of the Colombian Basketball Federation, told
the AP.
   ``Unfortunately, we had to do this because of the violence
affecting Colombia and in particular Medellin.''
   Senior U.S. diplomats and drug enforcement officials in Bogota
have said that once extraditions start, they expect drug-related
terrorism in Colombia to increase.
   For years, drug traffickers have largely evaded justice through
bribery and intimidation, killing or bribing politicians, police,
judges, journalists and others.
   Martinez, who arrived in Atlanta under heavy guard Thursday, has
denied any links to the Medellin cartel. He is accused of laundering
up to $27 million in drug profits by funneling the cash through U.S.
banks, including one in Atlanta.

   Plane crash survivors who were

   ``We were ready to die but the hand of God guided our descent,''
passenger Epaminondas de Sousa Chaves, 36, said Wednesday after Air

   Defying threats that more judges will be
murdered, the government extradited an alleged drug money launderer
to the United States and offered hefty rewards for Colombia's two
reputed top cocaine kingpins.
   Eduardo Martinez Romero, who U.S. officials say was flown out on
Wednesday, is the first drug figure extradited to the United States
under special emergency powers decreed last month as part of an
unprecedented anti-drug war.
   Colombian officials and U.S. diplomats kept mum about Martinez's
extradition, but it was confirmed by officials in the United States.
   Martinez, 35, is charged in Atlanta in connection with the
laundering of $1.2 billion worth of illicit cocaine cash.

   The National Party has narrowly
retained its parliamentary majority, suffering heavy losses to both
anti-apartheid and segregationist rivals in its worst electoral
showing in 41 years in power.
   But acting President F.W. de Klerk said today that the results
showed that most voters support the Nationalists' plan to extend
limited political rights to blacks, who were barred from voting in
Wednesday's election.
   With just two of 166 election districts undecided, it appeared
the Nationalists would retain at least 93 of their previous 123
seats in Parliament's dominant white chamber.
   The Conservatives, who want stricter enforcement of segregation
laws, improved from 22 to 39 seats, and the liberal Democratic Party
from 20 to 33, making the biggest gains ever for an anti-apartheid
faction.
   In protest of their disenfranchisement, blacks observed a
nationwide general strike, which anti-apartheid leaders called the
biggest anti-government protest ever with 3 million people taking
part.

   A 33-year-old quadriplegic quietly accepted the
news that a judge had granted his wish to be allowed to shut off the
machine that has kept him alive the past four years.
   Larry McAfee, paralyzed from the neck down in a 1985 motorcycle
accident, won permission Wednesday to fit the ventilator that allows
him to breathe with a device he designed in his head as he lay
paralyzed.
   ``He said, `Well,' and was quiet, just said, `Well, good,''' said
nurse Carol Philpot at the Briarcliff Nursing Center in Alabaster,
Ala., where McAfee is staying. ``He's kind of digesting the news, I
think.''
   Under his plans, McAfee would be administered a sedative and use
a mouth-held stick to activate the device, which would be connected
to a timer to shut off the ventilator.

   A widely used class of fungicides is being
taken off the market voluntarily for dozens of crops _ from apples
to cucumbers _ because government tests indicate a higher risk of
cancer than may be acceptable.
   The three manufacturers of the fungicide EBDC announced Wednesday
they are curtailing the use of the chemical ``to maintain public
confidence'' in the food products involved. However, they maintained
the chemical is safe for consumers if used properly.
   EBDC, or ethylene bisdithiocarbamate, has been under a special
review by the Environmental Protection Agency since 1987 because a
breakdown product from the chemical has been shown to cause cancer
in test animals.
   The agency recently informed the companies of preliminary cancer
risk estimates that likely would require curbs on the use of EBDC on
some food products, according to agency documents obtained by The
Associated Press.

   The evacuation of the last U.S. diplomats
from Beirut marks a milestone in 30 years of American involvement in
turbulent Lebanon.
   Washington's envoys had clung tenaciously to the war-battered
capital despite the assassination of one U.S. ambasador, the suicide
car bombings of two embassy buildings, the abductions of Americans
and murderous artillery barrages.
   But on Wednesday, Ambassador John McCarthy and his 29 remaining
American staff members slipped out of the country aboard three U.S.
Navy helicopters amid mounting criticism from militant pro-Western
Christians.
   The Christian standard-bearer, army commander Gen. Michel Aoun,
had charged that Washington has ``sold Lebanon to Syria'' out of
fear for the lives of eight Americans held hostage by pro-Iranian
zealots.

   President Bush denounced a House-passed defense
bill as ``totally unacceptable to the commander in chief'' on
Thursday and accused the chamber of holding the defense budget
hostage to $20 billion in ``unneeded programs.''
   Bush, in a speech to the American Legion that mixed defense and
anti-drug themes, also praised Wednesday's decision by Colombian
president Virgilio Barco to extradite a major drug figure to the
United States.
   The extradition of Eduardo Martinez Romero to face U.S. drug
money-laundering charges ``sends a strong signal of the courage and
determination of President Barco and the Colombian government to
deal with the scourge which drugs are inflicting on all of us,''
Bush said.
   Declaring ``Remember Pearl Harbor,'' Bush also poked fun at his
1988 campaign gaffe _ to the same group one year ago _ confusing

   The Navy said Thursday that gunner's mate
Clayton Hartwig ``most likely'' caused the explosion that killed 47
sailors aboard the USS Iowa by shoving a detonator between gunpowder
bags in one of the battleship's huge guns.
   The formal report on the explosion, the worst naval disaster
since the Vietnam War, said the exact cause cannot be pinpointed
since the sailors close enough to see what was going on, including
Hartwig, were all killed in the fiery blast.
   However, Rear Adm. Richard Milligan, presenting the official
conclusions at a Pentagon briefing, said much ``circumstantial
information'' pointed to Hartwig, whose job put him closest to the
gun.
   He cited an FBI psychological profile of Hartwig ``with the
opinion that he took his own life and hoped it looked like an
accident.''

   The National Party government
promised reform Thursday after suffering heavy losses in an election
accompanied by protests and political violence in which 25 people
were reported killed.
   If the death toll is confirmed, it would be the highest in a
24-hour period since 69 blacks were shot to death during a peaceful
protest in Sharpeville township in 1960.
   In Wednesday's white parliamentary election, the Nationalists got
less than 50 percent of the vote for the first time since 1953. They
lost nearly a quarter of their seats to an anti-apartheid party and
to a far-right group that favors strict racial segregation.
   Police used shotguns, tear gas and whips on anti-election
protesters in black and mixed-race townships outside Cape Town.

   Senate tax-writers, yielding to loud complaints
from many older Americans, indicated Thursday they would join their
House counterparts and go along with major changes in Medicare
insurance covering the costs of a catastrophic illness.
   Several members of the Senate Finance Committee, however,
rejected a revision approved by the House Ways and Means Committee
to cut costs for the higher-income elderly but raise them for older
people with lower incomes.
   ``I want to make it clear at the outset that, as chairman, I will
oppose any increase in the flat premium paid by retirees of modest
means,'' said Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, who heads the Finance
Committee.
   The program, enacted barely a year ago, is under heavy fire from
some older Americans who say they don't need the protection and from
others _ mainly those with higher incomes _ who object that the
coverage is financed only by the elderly and not by all taxpayers.

   Gen. Michel Aoun said Thursday that U.S.
foreign policy is ``biased and shortsighted,'' then asked American
help in what the Christian leader calls the war of liberation
against Syrian troops in Lebanon.
   Aoun said the U.S. withdrawal of its last diplomats Wednesday was
based on ``rumors, false suppositions and unconvincing reasons.''
   He likened the 6-month-old battle between his 20,000 Christian
soldiers and a Moslem alliance led by the 40,000 Syrians to what
Americans' ``forefathers did ... 200 years ago'' in the
Revolutionary War.
   Syrians and Christians exchanged artillery fire for five hours
before dawn Thursday and police reported two dead and seven wounded.
At least 830 people have been killed and 2,462 wounded since the
artillery war began March 8. Nearly all the victims have been
civilians.
   The U.S.-trained general said he would welcome the return of
Ambassador John McCarthy and other American diplomats to Lebanon

   Greece's mistrust of its old enemy Turkey,
a NATO ally, blocked Western plans to propose limits on military
maneuvers, sources reported Thursday after talks resumed on reducing
conventional forces in Europe.
   The West had hoped to begin the third six-week round between NATO
and the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact with proposals that would help
maintain what U.S. Ambassador Stephen J. Ledogar called the
``breathtaking pace'' of the 23-nation talks, which began in March.
   On Wednesday, NATO diplomats in Vienna and Brussels put the
finishing touches on the Western plan, described by senior officials
as an unprecedented effort to curb military exercises on the world's
most heavily armed continent.
   Diplomatic sources said, however, that Greece felt NATO set the
limits too high when it proposed requiring maneuvers to be announced
in advance if 40,000 reservists would be called up or 1,200 armored
personnel carriers used.

   The reputed financial wizard of the Medellin
cocaine cartel arrived under guard at a tiny, out-of-way airport
before sunrise Thursday, the first of Colombia's ``Extraditables''
brought to the United States for trial.
   The extradition of Eduardo Martinez Romero, an alleged
money-launderer for the drug cartel that is believed to supply 80
percent of America's cocaine, came days after President Bush
declared war on Latin America's cocaine barons.
   Martinez, 36, was put on a Drug Enforcement Administration plane
in Bogota on Wednesday night. He arrived at 4 a.m. outside Atlanta
at Charlie Brown Airport, an airfield used mostly by private planes,
and was whisked to court by helicopter.
   Hours later, after the government obtained an interpreter for
him, he appeared before U.S. Magistrate Joel M. Feldman and told him
he speaks only Spanish and does not fully comprehend the
money-laundering charges against him.

   Ultraviolet-B radiation, those sun rays that
may cause skin cancer, can destroy a protein essential to plants,
suggesting that ozone holes in the sky could lead to less food on
the table, an agriculture scientist said Thursday.
   Autar K. Mattoo, leader of the plant molecular biology laboratory
at the U.S. Department of Agriculture research station in
Beltsville, Md., said that studies using duckweed plants showed that
exposure to ultraviolet-B, or UV-B, radiation destroyed half of the
plant's store of a critical photosynthesis protein every half hour.
   The plant is able to restore protein at normal UV-B levels, he
said, but at higher levels of UV-B the plant would be stripped of
the protein and photosynthesis would stop.
   ``In a few hours time, you would have hardly any of this protein
left in the plant,'' he said. ``The plant would wither away and
die.''

   The federal Superfund program has
been ``superslow'' in cleaning toxic waste dumps and in making
polluters pay for the work, according to a study.
   In the program's first eight years ending last September, the
Environmental Protection Agency finished cleaning only 34 dumps out
of 1,175 on a priority list, according to the Rand Corp. study, to
be released Friday. The list represents only the worst of 30,000
dumps where waste ultimately may need to be treated or removed.
   The report also found that EPA spent only $2.6 billion of the
$4.5 billion in Superfund money from Congress during 1980-1988, and
only $1.6 billion went directly to cleanup work, with the rest spent
on management and legal costs.
   Finally, the agency recovered only $230 million of the $2.6
billion from polluters who are supposed to pay for the cleanup work,
said the study by Jan Paul Acton, of Rand's Institute for Civil
Justice.

   Lunchtime at Mulates: The friendly waitress
serves up fried catfish, stuffed peppers and jambalaya to the
tourist while the fiddle and accordion wail another chorus of
``Jolie Blonde.''
   It may make the tourist commission here in the heart of Acadiana
happy, but it has Trent Angers hotter than a cayenne pepper.
   ``That's exactly how a lot of people got their image of Cajuns. A
reporter comes to town and he is sent to Mulates and on a swamp tour
and then he heads off to write his story. Most people think we're a
bunch of laid-back, drunken hedonists who eat too much and dance all
night.''
   Fun, food and music may be part of the Cajun heritage, but it's
not the whole story, said Angers, author of ``The Truth About
Cajuns.''
   ``That doesn't define who we are. Cajuns are a people with a
strong work ethic, strong family ties and a fidelity to the land.''
   In his book, Angers traces the history of the French exiles who
moved from Nova Scotia in the mid-1700s and whose descendants kept
many of their native customs, including the language, and became
known as Acadians or Cajuns.
   Angers, 41, whose mother is Cajun, blames the media, tourism,
counterfeit Cajun products and humorist Justin Wilson, whose ``Cajun
Chef'' cooking show is nationally syndicated, for the Cajun
stereotype.
   ``He speaks in broken English and with a lot of malaprops. To
hear him you'd think all Cajuns are barely literate and not very
bright. He is not a Cajun, but this is the only image of a live
Cajun many people have.
   ``His contrived accent and the demeaning nature of many of his
jokes are embarrassing to many people in south Louisiana. They just
wish Mr. Wilson would go home and do his cooking instead of
ridiculing them.''
   Wilson and his manager-wife Jeannine refused to even discuss the
issue. ``I don't want to talk about that,'' Wilson said.
   Paul Edward Joubert, a Cajun and a sociologist at the University
of Southwestern Louisiana, said Angers' book makes some valid points.
   ``To see some of it you would think we all have pirogues still
and are barefoot and are living in a swamp. There's the implication
that these people don't know any better but they're happy because
they dance a lot,'' he said.
   Working from national publications, Angers compiled a list of
stereotypes. For example:
   _``What lives in the swamps, plays an accordion, eats crawfish,
speaks French and rocks your socks off?''
   _``In these parts, if you don't dance and drink beer, people
think you're a communist!''
   _``Cajun country (is) a land of fiddles and etouffee, squeeze
boxes and two-steps ... where everybody's a cousin and everything's
cooked in cayenne by a people whose religion is hospitality.''
   Alice Ferguson, a spokeswoman for the Lafayette Parish Convention
and Visitors Commission, denied tourism officials have helped to
generate such stereotypes. ``When a writer or film crew comes in,
they sometimes only want to see a swamp or Cajun dancing or one part
of the culture,'' she said.
   ``We try to make sure they get what they want. If they don't have
a specific request, we try to show them some of everything _ the
museums, the city, the university, as well as the swamp and the
dancing.''
   Even Cajun food has been slandered, Angers said, accusing
national writers and cooks for erroneously labeling it hot and
peppery. ``To read about Cajun food or taste so-called Cajun food
like Cajun potato chips, or Cajun Whalers at Burger King, or the
Cajun Pizza at Pizza Hut, you'd think Cajuns had to drink a lot of
beer just to preserve their taste buds. Cajun food is about the only
thing that has been more maligned here than the people.''
   His definition of Cajun food is good home cooking made with fresh
ingredients and skill. Some may be spicy, but it's not hot or
peppery.
   While Cajuns have managed to maintain a cultural identity, they
are not a group of simple people living in the past, Angers said.
``It may be good for tourism, but it undermines the dignity of the
Cajun people.''
   And it is good for tourism. Although Ferguson has no figures on
how many people visit the area annually, she said the four major
festivals in Lafayette each draw 200,000 to 300,000 people.
   Although 8 percent to 10 percent of the Cajuns still hunt, trap
and live in the swamps, Angers said the majority are mainstream
Americans these days.
   ``Because of the fact we're projected as good-time Charlies,
people who are in a position to bring industry into this state don't
even give this area a thought. They assume we are so busy playing
that we don't ever work.''
   Angers, who also is the editor and publisher of the magazine
Acadiana Profile, said, ``I don't want to go overboard in the other
direction and make Cajuns seem like boring, humorless people who
never have fun. But come on, you couldn't do to another minority

<HEAD>The Green Man Returns: Pagan Figure on London Subway</HEAD>

   The Green Man is back, staring at travelers from
posters in London subway stations.
   The mysterious and arresting image of a face with sprouting
leaves is older than Christianity, harking back to pagan times when
the Earth, the sun and all living things were believed to have
spirits.
   There have been many types of Green Man. This one was carved in
the 14th or 15th century in the ceiling of Norwich Cathedral, 115
miles northeast of London.
   He is on a poster for an exhibition called ``Out of the Wood: the
Tree as Image and Symbol,'' about the relationship between trees and
the arts. It features mainly contemporary wood carvings and
ornaments and ceramics based on the shapes of trees and leaves, and
poems about trees.
   ``It was an inspired choice to put the Green Man on the poster
because we have had a steady stream of visitors all day since we
opened on Aug. 2,'' said Julia Bennett, who helps run the exhibition
in the Crafts Council Gallery in Waterloo Place near Piccadilly
Circus.
   Susan Clifford, a former landscape planner also involved with the
exhibition, said in an interview: ``The Green Man seems to have had
a lot of uses before he was taken over by Christians and then
discarded. In his simplest version he was the spirit of
regeneration, the spirit of the forest. He was a giant garlanded in
green, sometimes frightening, sometimes benign.''
   William Anderson, a writer and poet and author of a forthcoming
book on the Green Man, said the figure can be seen in medieval
churches and cathedrals throughout Europe. At times, these days, he
can be seen in England as a pub sign.
   ``But his origins are much more ancient than the Middle Ages. He
is one of those symbols that appear and disappear in history,'' the
writer said.
   ``The Green Man may be the origin of a folk cult figure known as
Jack in the Green or Robin of the Wood, and it was Robin who may
have inspired the legend of Robin Hood and his merry men in Sherwood
Forest.''
   The gallery is a showplace for contemporary arts and crafts but
hardly a tourist attraction and doesn't usually get many visitors on
hot days.
   ``But we had TV and radio interviews and good notices in the
papers because the Green Man is so striking,'' Bennett said.
   The version of the poster Green Man is based on the drawing still
high up in the cathedral, but the exhibition offers a modern Green
Man, made of gently flickering neon tubes by Peter Freeman.
   The idea of a visible spirit of the trees is repeated in other
exhibits. ``Gold Jacket'' by Richard Wincer, priced at $3,100, is a
dark coat covered with real oak leaves that were preserved with
resin and painted gold.
   ``I thought of oak leaves because I wanted to do something very
English,'' said Wincer.
   Oak forests dotted England centuries ago and provided the timber
for homes, farms and ships.

<HEAD>Classic Neapolitan Song Gets Rock 'n' Roll Revival</HEAD>

   Pino Daniele grew up steeped in traditional
Neapolitan music, the sometimes mournful, sometimes joyous melodies
passed down for centuries in this Mediterranean city.
   But it didn't stop him from wanting to be Elvis.
   ``I loved rock 'n' roll but I also loved my music, Neapolitan,''
says the 34-year-old singer. ``I am a big fan of Elvis Presley, and
at the same time I'm a big fan of (Neapolitan crooner) Roberto
Murolo.''
   Today, Daniele is leading a revival of the Neapolitan song, which
made Italian music world-famous with such tunes as ``O Sole Mio,''
``Funiculi, Funicula'' and ``Turna a Surriento'' (``Return to
Sorrento'').
   But instead of mandolins, it is electric guitars and a rock or
jazz rhythm that mark the new Neapolitan sound.
   Daniele's albums have won him huge audiences and encouraged a
whole school of Neapolitan singers at a time when Italian performers
account for less than half the record sales in Italy while American
and British singers dominate the pop charts.
   ``Neapolitan song represents one of the main points of Italian
culture. We members of the new generation said, `let's create a
fusion,''' explained Daniele in an interview at his studio in
Formia, 50 miles from Naples.
   ``That is, we fuse it (Neapolitan song) with modern music, a
universal language, which could be jazz or rock or other kinds of
music.''
   With a faded T-shirt covering his husky frame, his gray-streaked
black hair pulled back in a ponytail, there is no mistaking Daniele
for Enrico Caruso. But he does claim a number of other similarities
with his Neapolitan predecessors.
   Like them, Daniele sings about the sea, the sultry Mediterranean
afternoons, the plight of the city's poor. He places special
emphasis on melody, like past Neapolitans whose songs are still
played in Italian restaurants the world over.
   And he uses the local dialect, which is laced with French and
Spanish from Naples' colonial past and English from the American
soldiers based in the area since World War II.
   In Daniele's songs, the tradition is mixed with a rock or
Afro-Cuban beat _ something that startled people when he first began
playing it in the mid-1970s.
   ``It was something new, but it communicated emotion,'' said the
musician. ``This is the important thing in the end.''
   Indeed, crowds frequently join in an emotional chorus with
Daniele, particularly for his older ballads such as ``Napule e''
(``Naples Is'') and ``Terra Mia'' (``My Land'') about the corruption
and neglect that have scarred Naples.
   His success has helped fuel a boom in Neapolitan pop music,
featuring singers Edoardo Bennato, Teresa De Sio and Tony Esposito.
A Neapolitan, Massimo Ranieri, won the Italian national song contest
``San Remo'' last year with a new Neapolitan ballad, ``Perdere
L'Amore'' (``Losing Love'').
   Daniele's songs aim to bring together not only Italian and
American music, but the experience of the poor in the two countries.
   ``They're Neapolitan melodies but with the rhythm of American
blacks,'' explains Gianni Borgna, author of ``History of Italian
Song.''
   ``Daniele suggests the poor of Naples are a bit like American
blacks, not so different from outcasts in America.''
   The modern tunes are a long way from traditional Neapolitan song,
which was influenced by arias in Donizetti and Rossini operas, as
well as French and Spanish traditions.
   Daniele heard those songs while growing up as one of six children
of a Naples port worker. As he taught himself to play the guitar in
his teens, he also followed singers such as Peppino di Capri who
were beginning to adapt Neapolitan melodies to a nightclub style.
   In recent years, Daniele has increasingly worked with American
and Latin American musicians to experiment with other influences and
establish broader appeal for his music.
   ``We are trying to develop this to get into the international
market, which is very difficult,'' he said. ``If you don't sing in
English, you're out automatically.''
   He hopes nonetheless to win broader success with a
``Mediterranean'' sound, featuring Neapolitan melody, Latin and
blues rhythms and perhaps an English singer.
   While he is not an international superstar, his reputation has
spread in Europe. He has given concerts in France, England, the
Netherlands, Austria and Cuba.
   In January, he will head for the United States for a concert
series called ``Night of the Guitar,'' in which he will play
instrumentals with guitarists including Leslie West of Mountain and
Robby Krieger of the Doors.
   Daniele says with the international contacts, his songs have
developed a more modern sound. ``But they always have a reference to
the Neapolitan way of communicating,'' he insisted. ``There's always
that.''

<DATELINE>TINGO MARIA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American narcotics agents, trained in
tropical combat and armed with automatic weapons, are preparing to
move into a heavily fortified police garrison built with U.S. funds
in the heart of Peru's coca-rich jungle.
   The base at Santa Lucia, 65 miles northwest of here, is part of a
major offensive by the Peruvian government against drug gangs and
their allies _ dogmatic Maoist guerrillas who call themselves the
Shining Path and control much of the lush Upper Huallaga River
Valley on the eastern slopes of the Andes.
   Despite the danger posed by the guerrilla force, the United
States is making the campaign in Peru the centerpiece of its drive
against cocaine trafficking in the Andean nations, which supply the
coca leaf from which the drug is refined. The plans were drawn
before President Bush outlined his $7.9-billion drug program Sept. 5.
   ``Sixty to 70 percent of the world's coca production comes out of
here,'' said Craig Chretien, chief of the U.S. Drug Enforcement
Agency's operations in Peru. ``Peru, of all the countries, offers
the best opportunity to do significant damage to the coca trade.''
   Once the anti-drug base is completed in October, as many as 50
Americans will operate directly from the Upper Huallaga region,
providing training and air support to some 300 police rangers
assigned to the garrison.
   The Americans include DEA agents and contracted Vietnam War
veterans who fly and maintain the nine U.S. Bell helicopters and two
C-123 cargo planes currently on loan to Peru for the anti-drug fight.
   ``The base is strategically located near all of the most
important trafficking areas,'' said Gen. Juan Zarate, chief of
Peru's drug police.
   The compound will have a three-quarter-mile airstrip that can
accommodate C-130 cargo planes, three helicopter pads, and nine
buildings, mainly barracks. The 100-acre area will be enclosed by
barbed wire and the outlying perimeter will be protected by mines.
   The step-up in the U.S. involvement comes as the Peruvian army,
armed with recently acquired Soviet armored helicopters, has
launched its heaviest campaign so far in the valley against the
Shining Path _ ``Sendero Luminoso'' in Spanish.
   The escalation in the fighting in the valley, however, has
aroused the concern of the Andean Commission of Jurists, among
others, that the United States could be drawn into the war against
the guerrillas.
   The commission, affliated with the Andean Pact alliance of
Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia, noted recently that
while the base is intended for the drug fight, ``observers are
concerned that in the medium term it can be converted into a
springboard for the internationalization of the counterinsurgency
fight in Peru.''
   The DEA agents came to Tingo Maria, about 250 miles northeast of
Lima, Peru's capital, in search of cocaine traffickers. But they
have found themselves in the middle of a revolution and working in a
valley dominated by at least 2,500 guerrillas.
   ``It's probably the most hostile situation the DEA works in
anywhere,'' Chretien said in an interview in Lima.
   Earlier this year the Shining Path offered a $50,000 reward for
any DEA agent killed in the valley, according to the Rev. Paul
Feeley, a Canadian Roman Catholic priest working in Aucayacu, a town
35 miles north of Tingo Maria.
   ``The DEA has become a dirty word in the Huallaga Valley,'' he
said. ``Sendero, and most other people around here, too, see the DEA
as being anti-subversive, not just anti-drug.''
   In return for providing protection from police raids, the Shining
Path enjoys the support of tens of thousands of peasants who grow
coca in the valley, earning 10 times what they could from other
crops.
   The guerrillas collect a 10 to 15 percent ``tax'' from the
growers as well as charging Colombian traffickers $10,000 to $15,000
for each small plane that picks up cocaine paste for refining in
Colombia, according to the peasants and police.
   Houses along the Jungle Highway leading out of Tingo Maria, the
largest town in the valley, are scrawled in blood-red paint with
deadly messages for the DEA.
   One on a school building said: ``Get out, Yankees, while you can
_ you will find your tombs here.''
   The DEA is not permitted to take part in counterinsurgency wars.
But in practice that changed in Peru when it became clear two years
ago that the guerrillas were actively involved in the cocaine trade.
   ``The rule is that Sendero is fair game if they're trafficking in
drugs,'' Chretien said. ``What counts is if they're traffickers, not
their politics. That doesn't mean we go looking for guerrilla camps
or columns. But if we spot them from the air, we notify the police.
And if they attack us, we defend ourselves.''
   The DEA pulled out of this ramshackle settlement in a hurry in
April after a force of 200 rebels, aided by local drug gangs and
Colombian traffickers, overran a police post in Uchiza, a town a few
miles from Santa Lucia, killing 10 policemen. Three of them were
officers who were executed publicly in the town plaza after the
garrison ran out of ammunition.
   ``Tingo Maria isn't a healthy place if you're an American,'' said
a DEA agent. ``There's a Sendero committee on every block, every
block.''
   Tingo Maria, at the southern end of the narrow, 150-mile-long
valley, has the look of a town expecting an attack at any moment.
Nervous troops behind sandbag barricades guard the bridge over the
river to the town's airstrip.
   Villagers say the Shining Path now moves boldly through the
valley, in columns of up to 500 fighters. The rebels wear uniforms
of black T-shirts and khaki pants, forsaking the clothing of the
Peruvian peasantry that would allow them to fade into the civilian
populace.
   In response, the army has begun employing its Soviet helicopters,
known as ``flying tanks'' and armed with heavy-caliber machine guns
and rockets. In July the armed forces reported killing 210 rebels,
110 of them in three air and land battles over a two-day period in
the valley.
   ``It's getting to the point where there are going to be
full-scale battles between two strong forces,'' said Feeley, the
Canadian priest.
   Making use recently of four of the MI-25 helicopters, the army
strafed guerrilla columns and at least one village of peasants
considered to be Shining Path supporters.
   Human rights groups fear that the casualty tolls provided by the
army may include many civilians.
   Feeley said that 17 suspected Shining Path leaders detained by
the army in late July in Aucayacu ``are now on that long list of
disappeared people.''
   But the guerrillas have taken their own toll.
   In June three Shining Path assassins walked into the office of
Tingo Maria's popular mayor, Manuel Espinosa, and shot him to death
as he sat behind his desk.
   In Aucayacu, the Shining Path has assassinated four of the last
six mayors.
   ``The other two quit before they were killed,'' said Feeley.

<TEXT>
   The Maoist Shining Path guerrillas who
dominate Peru's Upper Huallaga River Valley have brought their own
law and order to a cocaine-corrupted, violence-ridden region.
   With a system they call ``revolutionary justice,'' they have
banned drug abuse, prostitution, homosexuality and thievery from the
villages they control.
   ``Two years ago you could not travel the roads without being held
up, but the `companeros' put an end to that,'' said cab driver David
Nicolas, referring to the guerrillas by the Spanish term for
comrades. ``They killed a few bandits and the rest got the message.''
   Much of the appeal of the rebels is rooted in their reputation
for almost puritanical honesty.
   Shopkeepers say the guerrillas never fail to pay for the food and
supplies they acquire in the villages. The same shopkeepers complain
bitterly about the local police who take what they want without ever
offering to pay.
   In a rare conversation with reporters, a Shining Path political
officer, who spoke only on condition he not be identified, gave an
example of the kind of law the guerrillas have laid down: ``Do not
steal so much as a needle or thread and return what you borrow.''
   In a nation where economic chaos reigns and few laws are
respected, the Shining Path is setting down clear rules and making
them stick.
   ``In a sense they enforce a hyper-Christian morality _ except
they kill you if you break the rules,'' said the Rev. Paul Feeley, a
Canadian Roman Catholic priest working in Aucayacu, 255 miles
northeast of Lima.
   In late July four young homosexual men who rendezvoused at a
bridge a few miles outside Tingo Maria, 35 miles south of here, were
set upon and killed by the rebels. Their bodies were dumped into the
river.
   A few months earlier the rebels executed eight youths near Tingo
Maria for smoking cigarettes laced with semi-refined cocaine.
   ``People have had to discipline themselves,'' said Raul Aranda,
an agronomist in Tingo Maria, explaining the effects of
``revolutionary justice.'' ``In rural areas a man must be faithful
to his wife and is permitted to go drinking only once a week.
Violators are warned only once.''
   Villagers say they are told, ``The revolution has a thousand eyes
and a thousand ears.''
   Peru's elected officials have painted the Shining Path insurgents
as lunatic killers. In the bleak Andean highlands, where the rebels
launched their insurgency in May, 1980, they have slain thousands of
peasants in attacks on villages they viewed as traitors to the rebel
cause.
   But here in the jungle-cloaked Upper Huallaga Valley, the world's
largest source of coca leaf, the Shining Path _ ``Sendero Luminoso''
in Spanish _ enjoys the support of tens of thousands of farmers
because the rebels protect them against a U.S.-funded coca
eradication program.
   Although they prohibit drug consumption, the guerrillas defend
coca production as an important source of income for the peasants.
Their only condition is that the semi-refined coca paste be sent out
of Peru.
   The rebels charge coca farmers a ``tax'' of 10 to 15 percent on
the earnings from the sale of their crops to drug traffickers, who
process the leaf into paste and sell it to Colombian cocaine
dealers. The Colombians arrive in small planes at dozens of
clandestine airstrips throughout the 150-mile-long valley.
   People in the Upper Huallaga appear to accept Shining Path's
social order. They say they feel protected from the violence of drug
gangs, corrupt local officials and ``abusive'' police.
   ``Why do you think people have joined the Shining Path? For the
coca and for revenge,'' said Carlos Ferrer, a taxi driver who
travels the road between Tingo Maria and Aucayacu. ``When the
government began trying to wipe out coca, police came and mistreated
people. They robbed peasants; they raped their women.''
   That view of the police as corrupt and abusive of their power is
widely held in the valley. Even top government officials in Lima say
there is much truth to the complaints.
   ``A cop in the Huallaga Valley expects to be bribed,'' said a
senior Interior Ministry official, speaking on condition of
anonymity. ``He figures it's a right coming to him. He gets off the
plane from Lima with his hand out for a payoff.''
   Official corruption is a problem throughout Peru, but in the
Huallaga Valley it seems rampant.
   A half dozen peasants complained in separate interviews that to
obtain a farm loan from the local Banco Agrario they have to kick
back 25 percent of the loan to bank officials.
   ``What I've heard is that if you want to be named a teacher in
the valley,'' said Feeley, ``it's three months salary as payment.
And if you're a woman, also the bed.''
   The Shining Path has been quick to kill local officials they
deemed to be corrupt, according to residents of the valley.
   ``If the Shining Path has the image of an organization that's
fighting corruption in a very corrupt place, that's going to win
them some points,'' Feeley said.
   A lawyer in Tingo Maria said his caseload had dropped off
dramatically because peasants no longer come into town to seek
justice.
   ``Formal justice here is ineffective, corrupt and time
consuming,'' he said. ``The Shining Path's justice is quick, free
and very effective.''

   A 150-mile-long valley in central Peru is the
world's biggest producer of the coca leaf used in making cocaine and
a main supplier of the drug cartels of neighboring Colombia. Monte
Hayes, AP bureau chief in Lima, recently visited two key areas of
the Upper Huallaga River Valley _ one, a government base from which
the United States will soon be going to war against the cocaine
trade at its source, an possibly against anti-government Maoist
guerrillas; the other, a stronghold of the guerrillas who are
cooperating with drug traffickers but also lay down tough laws of
their own in the villages they control, including a ban on drug
abuse. Here are his reports.

<TEXT>
   Tom Pickens makes no attempt to conceal he's the
son of a well-known takeover strategist _ on one wall of his office
hangs a caricature of his father in pursuit of Phillips Petroleum Co.
   But said the youngest son of T. Boone Pickens Jr.: ``I always had
a real independent streak.''
   Pickens, 32, is chairman of Catalyst Energy Corp., a New
York-based power producer he bought in August 1988, using his own
money and capital from a Canadian company, Great Lakes Group.
   Pickens said he did not ask his father, who heads the Mesa
Limited Partnership oil concern in Texas, to contribute toward the
purchase.
   He did not need Boone Pickens' money or his reputation _ by the
time he bought Catalyst, Tom Pickens already had founded and sold a
business and tried his hand at other investments, including hostile
takeover attempts like those his father has become famous for.
   The younger Pickens _ his full name is Thomas Boone Pickens III _
began trading a stock portfolio when he was 14. In his senior year
at Southern Methodist University he started a company that
distributed computer components.
   The company's sales went from zero to $10 million in about 2{
years before he sold it, and then Pickens went into what he called
``small venture capital-type companies.''
   But about 1985, Pickens said, he found that business had become
``pretty risky and a very difficult way to build a portfolio of
operating companies.'' He sought a more stable operation, something
he believed Catalyst would be.
   Catalyst was attractive, Pickens said, because ``independent
power is on the leading edge of the energy business and I look for
consistent forms of cash flow, which it can bring.''
   Pickens said he expects to expand the privately held company _
which has $1 billion in assets and annual sales of $460 million _
through acquisitions.
   The firm's projects include a $500 million floating power plant,
the Merrimac, recently towed up the Mississippi to be part of a
hyroelectric project that Catalyst partly owns.
   In 1987, Pickens' made his first hostile takeover attempt, when a
group he led bid for Japan Fund Inc., a mutual fund that escaped the
advance.
   Pickens' group later made a $106 million offer for the Richmond
Hill Savings Bank in New York City, but sold its stake in the bank
when a higher bidder emerged. The group also made a run at another
mutual fund, Clemente Global Growth Fund, but was stymied when a
federal judge blocked the offer.
   Pickens said he looks for ``whatever's the cheapest way to
acquire a corporation ... whatever's the most efficient form.''
   Under the right circumstances, that can mean a tender offer, or a
direct appeal to shareholders for their stock, regardless of what
the company's management wants.
   Tender offers made Tom Pickens' father unwelcome in the
boardrooms of major U.S. oil companies. Besides Phillips, Boone
Pickens pursued Unocal Corp., Gulf Corp. and a number of smaller
firms.
   Although he never succeeded in taking one over, the elder Pickens
profited handsomely from his attempts and embodied the emergence of
the corporate raider as both a feared and admired symbol of business
power in the 1980s.
   Learning about business and investment was a natural part of
growing up in Boone Pickens' home.
   ``It was always around,'' said Tom Pickens, whose blond,
blue-eyed boyish looks make him appear much younger than 32.
   He held jobs typical for a teen-ager in high school and college,
working in a photo lab and liquor store and operating a forklift for
International Paper _ and in the process got training on how a
manager should treat employees.
   ``I worked for a lot of jerks,'' he said. ``I know what kind of
special talent it is to be a jerk, having worked for those guys, and
I also know the way around it.''
   ``I know the way that I would like to be treated in order to give
100 percent and that is how I treat my people,'' he said.
   Pickens worked briefly for Mesa, including a stint in the North
Sea after he graduated high school, but joining the company
full-time was never an option.
   ``Dad's really big on the whole idea of efficient management,
professional management,'' he said. ``I didn't really realize that a
lot of public companies hire the siblings or hire the sons and
daughters (of managers) _ I was always under the impression that
that was not acceptable.''
   A career at Mesa was also out of the question because ``I didn't
like the feeling of it, going in there and being `daddy's boy,'''
Pickens said. ``If I messed up, I wanted somebody to tell me, just
like they would tell everyone else ... I wasn't getting honest
opinions.''
   His independence also led him along his own career path, but it
has not stopped him from doing business with his father. Pickens
also chairs the New York chapter of his father's advocacy group,
United Shareholders Association.
   He acknowledged there are similarities between his outlook and
his father's: ``Any time that you have a relationship like the one
that my father and I have shared throughout the years, I think that
there's going to be a certain amount of sharing of attitudes as
well.''
   He said their management styles differ in some ways but ``I have
a great deal of respect for the time and the effort and the
consideration that he has spent'' on Mesa and its employees.
   ``He motivates them very well and he compensates them very well
and he makes sure they are part of a very close-knit family,'' he
said.
   Pickens has similar goals for his 800 employees at Catalyst.
   ``We're trying to be sure that the people here are very proud to
be in the position they're in,'' he said.

<HEAD>John Sununu: Outsider Easing into White House Insider's Job</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   John Henry Sununu sees his job as White House
chief of staff as something more than Oval Office doorkeeper _ but
something ``not as hectic'' as, say, being chief executive of New
Hamsphire.
   ``There's less pressure to work with each and every department
and agency,'' Sununu says. ``Here a lot is ... rightly or wrongly,
under the control of the bureaucrats.''
   Sununu's approach to the job differs from those of his
predecessors under Ronald Reagan. James A. Baker III, for example,
called it ``a great big catcher's mitt.'' To Donald T. Regan, it was
``a shovel brigade that follows a parade down Main Street.''
   But Sununu, 50, the abrasive three-term New Hampshire governor
who was one of George Bush's earliest campaign workers, may still be
one of the surprise acts of the Bush White House.
   Originally an outsider to Washington politics, Sununu eight
months into the Bush presidency is not only proving himself adept at
survival but has been winning allies in an institution where critics
originally thought he would make only enemies, Congress.
   ``I've tried very hard to make every day a learning day,'' Sununu
said in an interview.
   After an admittedly rocky start that included the failed
nomination of John G. Tower for defense secretary, Sununu says he
has been working hard to keep lines of communication open with
members of Congress and with the bureaucracy, and in keeping his
fabled temper in check.
   And were there mistakes to learn from? ``Lots. And I'm not going
to tell you any of them.''
   Sununu, one of the first aides Bush sees each morning at the
White House and the last one he meets with at the end of each day,
says one of his principal jobs is ``just to make sure that everybody
that the president should see gets a chance to see him.''
   Blunt and quick-witted (he is a member of the high-IQ society,
Mensa), Sununu handles the No. 1 staff job differently than the
three men who held it before him.
   He is less of a behind-the-scenes negotiator and conciliator than
were either James Baker, Reagan's first staff chief and now the
secretary of state, or former Senate Republican leader Howard Baker,
Reagan's third staff chief.
   Where James Baker has been credited with moderating some of
Reagan's more conservative views, Sununu is the in-house
conservative in the Bush White House.
   Sununu has been criticized by some for maintaining too high a
profile compared to the low-key and generally soft-spoken Baker.
   But while he exercises firm control over the staff, Sununu does
not exert the iron discipline that Reagan's middle chief of staff,
Donald T. Regan, did; nor does he attempt to maintain the same
degree of control over the president's personal schedule, according
to White House insiders.
   Some White House staffers have privately criticized Sununu for
appearing at Bush's side so often. Still, Sununu said, ``I can
wander in to any meeting, any time. He (Bush) wants it that way.''
   Stuart Eizenstat, a former senior aide to President Jimmy Carter
and now a Washington lawyer and consultant, says Sununu ``seems to
have subdued his own personal agenda for the president's agenda, and
seems to have achieved a sense of teamwork.''
   Tom Griscom, a former aide in the Reagan White House, which was
rife with staff clashes, said Sununu ``has exceeded expectations.
There are still many tests out there. But, so far, people have to
acknowledge that Gov. Sununu knows his way around more than people
gave him credit for.''
   While Sununu made an early peace with Senate Republican Leader
Bob Dole (something Donald Regan was unable to do) in an effort
salve bitterness remaining from the 1988 presidential primaries, he
hasn't completely retired the hatchet he wielded for Bush during the
presidential campaign.
   A favorite target has been Sen. Joe Biden, D-Del., chairman of
the Senate Judiciary Committee which earlier this month dumped
Bush's nomination of William Lucas to head the Justice Department's
civil rights division.
   ``Sen. Biden is out there, to be blunt about it, trashing the
president,'' Sununu says.
   But the chief of staff also has another role, one not often seen
by the public _ that of White House jester.
   When Bush stepped away from an Oval Office meeting briefly,
Sununu impishly had a White House photographer snap a picture of the
empty presidential chair as he and other top aides looked on
intently.
   Sununu and national security adviser Brent Scowcroft then
presented an autographed enlargement to Bush.
   It was inscribed to ``President Skippy,'' from a staff ``who can
see through you,'' a clear reference to cartoonist G.B. Trudeau's
long-running ``Doonesbury'' depiction of him as an invisible leader
with a fictitious ``evil twin'' brother, Skippy.
   ``It was in the middle of a tough week,'' Sununu said.
   ``People feel comfortable doing something that breaks the tension
a little bit. I think it allows for a decision to be made in a much
more relaxed climate. And you usually end up with better decisions.''
   Then there was the time he talked Budget Director Richard Darman
into donning a gorilla suit to greet the president. Or when the
staff turned the tables and all showed up at a meeting wearing black
arm bands to mark Sununu's 50th birthday.
   The bespectacled, round-faced aide staff chief claims he's gotten
a bad rap in the image department: that the perception of him as
arrogant, imperious and aggressive is all wrong.
   ``What a lot of people miss was that ... I was governor in a
state in which, constitutionally and statutorily, the governor's
office was relatively weak.''
   Running New Hampshire, he said, was in some ways much harder than
running the White House staff. ``The pace down here is not as
hectic,'' he said.
   What Sununu lacked in legal authority in New Hampshire, he made
up for in swagger and bravado. Then he brought the same
aggressiveness to managing Bush's come-from-behind victory in the
1988 New Hampshire primary _ and to his travels around the country
trashing neighboring Gov. Michael Dukakis.
   ``That was before his kinder and gentler days,'' Bush said the
other day in Kennebunkport, Maine, in discussing his chief of staff.
   Bush said Sununu ``has my full, unequivocal confidence. And it
makes life a lot easier for me. ... He's made a lot of friends for
our administration on the basis of competence, sheer competence.''
   Still, while staff morale seems generally high, there have been
some clashes even in this ``kinder and gentler'' White House,
including friction between Sununu and Scowcroft whenever the chief
of staff wanders into the foreign-policy domain, according to White
House sources.
   And while staff members say that Sununu exhibits a sense of
humor, he is not one to cross.
   As Andrew H. Card Jr., a key Sununu deputy and former
Massachusetts legislator, puts it: ``He expects people to have done
their homework.''

<HEAD>Bennett's New Job Could Position Him Well for 1990s</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When Congress decided that there should be a
drug czar, the Democrats may not have bargained on getting Czar
Bennett. After the war on drugs, William J. Bennett could be a
formidable figure in the political wars of the 1990s.
   Bennett, now 46, will come away from his current assignment as
one of the most visible figures in the Republican lineup. His ample
ambitions are directed at government service, as he demonstrated by
volunteering for the drug job after a brief, lucrative season away
from the federal payroll.
   This might have been a million-dollar year for Bennett as a
writer and speechmaker. He was heading in that direction at $14,000
a speech, plus book advances. As director of the Office of National
Drug Control Policy, he makes $99,500.
   And, as he once observed, the hours are bad, the subject
depressing.
   Add the fact that there's anything but a guarantee of success.
Critics are saying President Bush's drug strategy is old stuff,
underfinanced and unlikely to succeed. Bennett denies the first two
complaints and dismisses the third as political pessimism.
   The voters want something done about drugs. They probably will
punish failure, if they can figure out whom to blame. So far that
hasn't happened, but now there is a yardstick: the goals Bennett set
for the Bush drug strategy. It calls for a 10 percent reduction in
drug use by Labor Day, 1991. The administration also seeks to cut
crack use by addicts in half.
   Those clear and specific goals come due one year before the next
presidential election campaign. The Bennett blueprint does provide a
line of political insurance, saying that the goals are realistically
achievable only with full federal, state and local implementation of
the Bush plan. Should they come up short, the Republicans can argue
that they didn't get that kind of top-to-bottom action.
   The drug job is at best a risky political assignment.
   But Bennett has dealt with risks before. He made his national
reputation as Ronald Reagan's secretary of education, running an
agency the president once said he would eliminate. Near the end of
his tour there, Bennett told a congressional critic that ``largely
because of me'' it was likely the education slot would stay in the
Cabinet.
   ``I made a hell of a commitment,'' he said at a Senate hearing,
storming back at a liberal Republican who complained about budget
cuts. ``You just didn't like the direction. I was damn successful.''
   So far, the debate over the Bush drug program has been restrained
and polite. But there will be some shouting before it's over.
   Bennett is not given to low-profile operations.
   He made a point and angered a Democrat last spring by refusing to
show up for a Senate hearing called by Sen. John Glenn. Bennett's
explanation: with 74 congressional committees claiming some piece of
the drug program, he couldn't spend his time at their hearings or
he'd never get the plan finished.
   Now that it's done, he will be the chief salesman, in speeches,
television appearances, and at hearing after hearing before
Congress. Bennett has more than a dozen dates for congressional
testimony this month, before panels run by Democrats who complain
that there's not enough money in the Bush program. He has a script
ready for them: ``I'm just not going to be all that receptive to
criticism of $8 billion from people whose current mark is $6
billion. They're just not going to get away with that.''
   By Bennett's reckoning, nobody should be surprised at the
political side of the drug program debate. ``You can't get politics
out of politics,'' he said. In mock surprise, he said that since
Bush's drug speech, ``political acts have been committed in this
city.''
   Bennett committed some himself.
   ``For a couple of months, I have been criticized by some for
emphasizing law enforcement and judges and prosecutors,'' he said in
one of three almost simultaneous and almost identical television
interviews the morning after the drug speech. ``This goes on for
quite some time. And then I go to bed last night, realizing that Joe
Biden, speaking for the Democrats, has moved to my right, saying
that we need more prosecutors, more law enforcement.''
   Biden, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, was an
architect of the bill that created Bennett's position and required
the new drug strategy. While there are political risks ahead, there
also are potential rewards, so the Democrats don't want their role
forgotten.
   Biden said the reason Bush made the drug speech in the first
place was the law written in 1988. ``That's why the president was on
TV,'' he said. ``He's required by law to lay that strategy out for
the first time in our history.''

   This time, America cannot simply come home.
   George Bush speaks determinedly of victory, but the fact remains,
a generation after Vietnam, that the United States is losing its
second war.
   Again the carnage, the brutality and the futility radiate nightly
into living rooms across the land.
   The scenes seem so familiar. The dead being carried off in body
bags. Wives and mothers grieving over senseless loss. Bewildered
children, ravaged by violence and disease. Commandos in flak jackets
charging again and again into enemy havens, only to find them
quickly reoccupied.
   This time, the homefolks are not seeing these things just on
television. No matter how sickened, they cannot demand that the
politicians and the generals return their sons and daughters from
some faraway combat zone. Because home is where the war is.
   Guerrillas are roaming the streets, not of Saigon, but of Los
Angeles and Chicago and Washington. Not the jungles of Vietnam, but
the farmlands of Iowa and Minnesota.
   Bush, like every president of the modern era, has promised to win
the drug war. It will happen, he said Tuesday, ``block by block,
child by child.'' He has a new program, latest in a long line. In
eight previous years, Bush, by his own account, was the hands-on
administrator of President Reagan's drug war. Polls show most people
believe that effort failed.
   According to the Drug Enforcement Administration, crack cocaine
has become ``the fast food of drugs'' and has spread from just three
U.S. cities eight years ago to virtually every state, including
rural areas, ``now manifesting itself in all strata of society.''
Not a happy legacy for the crime-fighting Reagan-Bush administration.
   Now, Bush would channel $261 million into Columbia and other
Andean nations to help finance the hunt for drug kingpins and their
henchmen, for whom human life is cheaper than a coca leaf.
Meanwhile, America's drug users are spending an estimated $100
billion each year to keep them in business.
   To this day, some Americans affix exclusive blame to foreign
villains, be they Colombian drug lords, corrupt Third-World generals
or Jamaican immigrants. A recent poll suggests a majority of the
public would favor the use of U.S. troops to wipe out the drug
exporting centers around the globe.
   Others argue that supply only exists to satisfy demand, and speak
boldly of mandatory prison terms or hospital confinement for all
drug abusers, as if there were room for them all.
   There isn't. According to the American Council for Drug
Education, 72 million Americans, or a whopping 37 percent of the
population aged 12 or older, have used illegal drugs at least once
in their lifetime. An estimated 14.5 million people had used them
within a month of the federally sponsored National Household Survey
on Drug Abuse last year.
   An estimated 21 million Americans have tried cocaine, at least 3
million are still occasional users and nearly a million are heavy
users. About 28 million people used one banned drug or another,
counting marijuana, in the last year.
   Drugs favor no race, sex or class. Three-fourths of illicit drug
users are white; 41 percent are women, including 5 million of
child-bearing age. The drug education council says 11 percent of all
babies born over the last year were exposed to illicit drugs during
their mother's pregnancy.
   Drugs are in the schools, the home and in the workplace. Eight
percent of last year's high school seniors said they had used
cocaine over the previous year; 10 percent of college students said
they did so. The drug council says 3 percent of workers between the
ages of 20 and 40 are cocaine users. In a recent survey, the
nation's employers said as many as one in five workers have alcohol
or illegal drug problems. Drug-related absenteeism, medical expenses
and lost productivity are costing employers an estimated 3 percent
of their payroll _ half the typical company's payment for an
employee's Social Security coverage.
   There are some encouraging signs. The national survey on drug
abuse has found a recent decline in so-called ``casual'' drug abuse
by young people. Two years ago, an estimated 17 percent of college
students were occasional users, compared to 10 percent today.
   But the number of heavy abusers _ particularly involving cocaine
_ has risen sharply. The percentage of weekly and daily cocaine
users has doubled since 1986; the number of cocaine-induced deaths
recorded by hospital emergency rooms totaled 1,696 last year, up
from 604 in 1984. Overall, emergency rooms treated 46,020 cocaine
patients last year, compared to 8,831 in 1984, an increase of 421
percent.
   Like the brass-hat body counters in Vietnam, prosecutors and
police often trumpet their battlefield victories to the news media _
seizures of vast quantities of drugs worth fortunes on the street,
massive arrests purporting to destroy this or that trafficking ring.
Like Lyndon Johnson's tunnel light, such announcements bear little
semblance to the real course of the war.
   Fact is, illicit drugs, especially cocaine, are in more plentiful
supply, at cheaper prices, in more potent form, than ever.
   The marijuana smoked today is as much as 10 times more powerful
than the stuff used by the flower child of the 1960s. A California
study shows the purty of cocaine sold on the streets increased from
29 percent to 73 percent in just the two years between 1982 and
1984, and has remained there. The price has dropped to under $100
per gram for the much purer, deadlier drug.
   Urban slums have long been the stomping grounds of drug dealers.
But the arrival of crack, a potent and cheap derivative of cocaine,
has done for those neighborhoods what gunpowder has done for Beirut.
   Cocaine was once considered the rich man's drug. With crack rocks
selling for a mere $5, nearly anyone, children included, can find a
way to obtain it.
   Pharmacologists say the drug itself chemically induces more
paranoia and violence than most any other, though another drug of
choice _ PCP or ``angel dust,'' can be as bad or worse. And
desperation among users, prepared to rob and kill for the money to
buy it, and competition among sellers, eager to establish
trafficking monopolies, heighten the explosive mix.
   The firepower and disregard for innocent life exhibited by the
gangs of young punks marketing crack, from Jamaicans in Washington
to the ``Crips'' and ``Bloods'' in Los Angeles, is astonishing.
``Drive-by'' killings, the spontaneous murder of someone because he
is dressed, sometimes unwittingly, in the colors of a rival gang,
have become commonplace. In Chicago, the cops who raided the arms
cache of one drug gang found the usual assortment of machine guns
and sawed-off shotguns along with, of all things, a cluster bomb.
Cluster bombs, normally dropped from airplanes, are designed to kill
anyone within a wide area.

   The Urban Institute recently sent its drug reseachers into
schools located in Washington's poorer neighborhoods, where they
interviewed adolescent boys in the ninth and 10th grades. The
information was later corroborated by criminal activity reports and
school records. Eighty percent denied using or selling drugs. But 28
percent admitted carrying a concealed weapon; 17 percent had
participated in a group attack; 13 percent admitted selling drugs,
making an average $1,000 per week; 11 percent had assaulted an
adult; and 5 percent had shot, stabbed or killed someone.
   And that, from kids only 14 and 15 years old.
   Last month, a Justice Department study in 14 major cities found
that more than half the men arrested for any serious crime _ and who
volunteered for drug testing _ were drug users. In Philadelphia, the
figure was 82 percent. ``There should be no longer any question as
to how much of a catalyst for crime the lust for illegal drugs has
become in America today,'' Attorney General Dick Thornburg said.
``Drug users and traffickers will beat, rob and kill anyone for
drugs and profits.''
   The toll, of course, is not limited to physical violence. The
House Select Committee on Narcotics Abuse and Control estimated in
February that there are 6 million to 6.5 million Americans in need
of drug-abuse treatment, including 1.3 million intravenous drug
abusers. Currently, treatment programs are available for only
250,000 abusers, the committee said.
   Meanwhile, quite aside from the thousands of drug-stupified
patients they treat, hospital emergency rooms are soaked with the
blood of drug-related violence. Washington's homicide rate, 59.4 per
100,000 population, edged out Detroit's last year to make the
District of Columbia the nation's murder capital. The majority of
the killings were drug murders, and the rate is climbing again this
year.
   Washington's police arrested 43,000 people last year. The vast
majority were set free, mostly because the city had no place to
imprison them. The same story applies in other cities. In Chicago,
misdemeanor offenders are released on personal recognizance because
there is no room in the Cook County jail. Nationwide, fewer than one
in six people arrested on drug-trafficking charges spend more than a
year in jail.
   Rural America is hardly immune. In a survey of all 93 U.S.
attorneys, the Justice Department found cases involving major drug
trafficking and related contract killings throughout the heartlands.
``We knew that the country was awash in narcotics and dangerous
drugs, but we did not expect to find significant cocaine operations,
for example, in Wyoming, or heroin trafficking in Iowa,'' said
Thornburgh.
   ``Crack,'' he added, ``is everywhere.''
   But cocaine is just the salt in America's drug stew. Colombia's
drug lords are not responsible for the 100,000 elementary school
children who get drunk at least once a week on the beer and
fruit-flavored wine coolers they see consumed by their parents and
television heroes. They are not responsible for the 48,000
youngsters who are killed or injured in automobile accidents caused
by intoxicated drivers every year. They are not responsible for the
five-fold increase in lung cancer since 1963 among women, who now
smoke tobacco in nearly the same numbers as men.
   The American Council for Drug Education says half a billion
workdays are lost each year because of alcoholism alone. That's a 2
percent loss in the nation's productivity.
   The federal government estimates that alcohol and drug abuse
costs the economy nearly $200 billion a year. Two-thirds of that is
attributed to alcohol.
   There is no end to this war. Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics
Anonymous, the two most successful, self-supporting treatment
programs, know there is no such thing as a cured addict; only a
recovering one.
   Their members go about it one day at a time. The government can
do no better.

<HEAD>Global Warming: How Much? How Soon? Experts Disagree</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID FOSTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SUNDANCE, Utah (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Should we all be checking out real estate
in Alaska, or are scientists who warn of catastrophic global warming
just blowing hot air?
   Sometimes it's hard to tell, admits one of those scientists. At a
recent conference here on global warming, climatologist Stephen
Schneider displayed two New York Times articles from last January.
   ``US Data Since 1895 Fail To Show Warming Trend,'' one headline
proclaimed.
   ``Global Warmth In 88 Is Found To Set A Record,'' said the other.
   Schneider turned to his audience and asked, ``Anybody here
confused?''
   If so, they're not alone. Ever since the hot, dry summer of 1988,
the news has been full of scientists grimly predicting droughts,
floods and famine if we don't act immediately to halt global
warming. At the same time, others urge caution, saying it's foolish
to solve a problem nobody has proved to exist.
   While most scientists concur on the basic mechanism behind global
warming, there is less agreement over how much or how quickly the
Earth is heating up, and even less over what should be done about
it. Now politicians and special interests have leaped into the fray,
making it even harder for a concerned citizen to winnow science from
speculation and reason from rhetoric.
   Here is a look at what scientists know _ and just as importantly,
don't know _ about global warming:
   The underlying principle is called the greenhouse effect,
familiar to anyone who has left a car with the windows rolled up in
a sunny parking lot. The short-wavelength sunlight passes through
the windows and is absorbed by the seats, which give off
long-wavelength heat radiation that's trapped by the glass.
   The ``windows'' in Earth's atmosphere are gases such as carbon
dioxide, methane and chlorofluorocarbons (chemicals used in
refrigeration and aerosol products). They let sunlight through but
trap heat radiated from the ground, keeping it from escaping into
space.
   ``If anyone is dubious that a greenhouse effect can be
dangerous,'' says astronomer Carl Sagan, ``just point them to our
neighboring planets.'' A thin atmosphere keeps Mars in a
deep-freeze, while an atmosphere rich in carbon dioxide keeps Venus
roasting like an oven.
   Earth, meanwhile, with a moderate carbon dioxide concentration,
has equable temperatures, liquid water and abundant life.
   But since 1850, Earth's atmospheric carbon dioxide has increased
25 percent, mostly due to burning fossil fuels. During the same
period, average global temperature, compiled from hundreds of
monitoring stations, has increased about 1 degree Fahrenheit.
   Cause and effect? Common sense might suggest that rising levels
of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases are responsible for
global warming, and that is the basis of mathematical models being
used to predict future warming.
   If nothing is done to reduce society's production of greenhouse
gases, the Earth faces the equivalent of a doubling of carbon
dioxide by the middle of the next century. And that, the various
models predict, could produce a global temperature rise of 2 to 10
degrees.
   The serious disagreement starts here.
   Robert Jastrow, former director of the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration's Goddard Institute for Space Studies,
questions both the accuracy of those models and the assumption that
increasing greenhouse gases have already caused warming.
   The past century's warming trend could be due to natural climate
variations or changes in the sun's brightness, he says. And present
climate models are so coarse that their treatment of how clouds
affect warming varies by a factor of three; such a wide discrepancy
casts doubt on all the models, he says.
   But Jastrow's successor at the Goddard Institute, James Hansen,
is a leading supporter of the climate models. Though uncertainties
remain, he says, they are unlikely to change his basic conclusion,
``that a growing greenhouse effect will increase the frequency and
severity of the extremes of the hydrologic cycle: droughts, on the
one hand, and extreme wetness and storms on the other.''
   While Hansen and Jastrow argue the big picture, little nuggets of
information are offered up almost daily, providing fodder for each
side of the global warming debate.
   Skeptics can use the first New York Times story mentioned by
Schneider. It noted that U.S. temperatures since 1895 do nothing to
confirm global warming. But believers can point out that the United
States occupies just 2 percent of the globe. And they can cite the
second Times story, which said that 1988 had the warmest average
global temperature on record.
   Each finding may be accurate, as far as it goes. But how
significant is it?
   A warm year, like 1988, may draw attention to global warming, but
most scientists now say last year's U.S. drought and heat were
natural atmospheric fluctuations caused by cyclical swings in
Pacific Ocean water temperatures.
   Yet, the six warmest years on record all have been within this
decade. In order, they are 1988, 1987, 1983, 1981, 1980 and 1986.
   To sort out nature's fickleness from longterm trends,
climatologists continually plug new factors into mathematical models
already so complex it takes days to run them through powerful
computers.
   Verifying the major effects of greenhouse warming could take 10
to 20 years of observation, Hansen says. By then, some scientists
warn, it may be too lae to stop greenhouse warming already in the
works.
   A temperature change in the lower range of predictions might not
cause catastrophic damage. But a 10-degree rise could expand ocean
water and melt enough polar ice to raise sea level nearly three
feet, flooding coastal regions worldwide, some scientists say.
   Despite the uncertainties, many scientists _ and more recently,
government policymakers _ have decided global warming is too much of
a risk to ignore.
   In May, the White House softened its go-slow attitude to embrace
the idea of a formal international treaty-negotiating process on
global warming.
   Citing a ``growing consensus'' among scientists, the
Environmental Protection Agency in March urged the reduction of
carbon dioxide through energy conservation techniques such as
development of fuel-efficient cars, energy-saving homes and solar
technology.
   But such measures can cost big money, and maneuvering has already
begun to protect special interests. Last month, the oil industry
released a study that concluded natural gas heat might contribute
more to the greenhouse effect than oil heat. The gas industry
attacked the report as flawed and biased.
   Such spirited debate, while not always enlightening, at least
keeps the issue of global warming alive. And that, Schneider said,
is key. A crisis _ last summer's heat wave _ drew attention to
global warming. But addressing the problem will take a long-term
commitment to research and action, he said.
   ``I hope that a cold, wet winter or normal summer or two won't
deter humanity'' from learning more about global warming, he said.
``The bottom line is, we insult the environment at a faster rate
than we understand the consequences.''

<HEAD>Testing Finds Mercury Contamination Around State</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD COLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>THE EVERGLADES, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The catch from some of Florida's most
popular fishing spots is unhealthy and even fish and alligator meat
from the protected Everglades is off limits as test after test shows
alarming levels of mercury.
   ``If it's so bad here in the Everglades, which is supposed to be
so pristine and so pure, then what's it like outside the park?''
said Pat Tolle, spokeswoman for Everglades National Park, where 10
times the federally set safe level of poisonous metal was found in
fish and alligators.
   Health officials have warned against eating large amounts of fish
from Deer Point Lake near Panama City and fishing spots down to the
Loxahatchee National Wildlife Refuge south of Lake Okeechobee. The
second annual alligator hunt was canceled in much of southern
Florida because the meat was tainted, and high levels of mercury
turned up in the Tampa Bay area and the Suwannee River.
   The levels of mercury, usually associated with factories and
processing plants, shocked state experts when testing began last
year.
   ``An hour before we got the first results, I would have been
willing to say to someone, `Not in Florida, because we don't have
that type of industry,''' said Thomas Savage, a Department of
Environmental Regulation biologist.
   ``But what we're finding is that there is a chronic low level of
mercury in fish statewide, and then there are hot spots like the
Everglades.''
   Wildlife officers are testing the rare Florida panther and plan
to do the same with wading birds. They hope those animals, unlike
bass and alligators, do not eat enough fish to ingest dangerous
amounts of mercury _ but they say no one expected to find mercury in
the first place.
   ``Birds and mammals need to be looked at,'' said Burkett Neely,
manager at Loxahatchee. ``We're doing testing into the estuary and
out into Florida Bay _ and there, you're getting into a commercial
fishing zone.''
   If mercury is found in higher animals, Ms. Tolle said it might
help explain one of the park's mysteries, a drop in wading birds
since 1900. ``The numbers now are 90 percent less that at the turn
of the century.''
   Mercury's effects on people _ damage to the nervous system that
can cause deafness, numbness, reduced vision and coordination _ are
well documented, but little is known about what it can do to the
complex ecology, she said.
   Most people seem to be heeding the health advisories. Before the
first warnings, the Florida Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission
found that fishermen relased 56 percent of the largemouth bass
caught around Loxahatchee. After the warnings, that climbed to 81
percent, said Frank Morello, an agency biologist.
   Harder to convince are low-income residents around the parks who
supplement their diets by fishing and are suspicious or ignorant of
the advisories. But so far, there's no evidence of anyone affected
by mercury poisoning, Savage said.
   Of most concern is determining the origin of the contamination.
   A prime suspect for the mercury present in lower levels around
Florida is airborne pollution, Savage said. ``Just like Canada and
the United States have an acid rain problem, Florida may have a
problem with mercury.''
   That would explain why mercury is widespread, but Savage said
some areas have virtually no mercury in fish, undermining the theory.
   When the initial findings were confined to Loxahatchee, prime
suspects were farms south of Okeechobee, who once used now-banned,
mercury-based fungicides. But it became clear that agriculture alone
wasn't enough of an explanation.
   Savage and others are looking at a theory that mercury, which
occurs in small amounts naturally, may concentrate in certain
plants, which in turn die and are compressed into peat at the bottom
of the Everglades.
   ``The peat down there, that very rich Everglades muck, has
naturally a very high level of mercury,'' Savage said. ``It's
possible man has disrupted the peat with drainage and water
movement, mobilizing the mercury.''
   Drainage canals and water movement could help explain why some of
the highest concentrations are in areas of the Everglades never
exploited directly by man. ``You have to look what's upstream,''
Neely said.
   Water in southern Florida flows from the agricultural areas along
Lake Okeechobee generally southward into the Everglades, he said.
``It's possible the mercury is being released naturally from the
peat and is being moved up and down by farming practices.''
   Whatever the cause, the discovery has changed for the worse the
way people look at their natural surroundings.
   ``My worst fear is, what else don't I know?'' Neely said. ``What
is this going to do to the wildlife? What are the long term effects?
And what other bear traps are we going to step in out there?''

<HEAD>Birds of Prey Research Leads To Forest Preservation Work</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL ERTELT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   From the Great Seal of the United States to
the folklore of Native Americans, birds of prey have been powerful
symbols of freedom, dignity and strength.
   But eagles, hawks and other raptors also send another message.
Because of their position near the top of the food chain, they serve
as environmental monitors, warning of impending danger like canaries
in a coal mine.
   ``If we see things happening to these birds ... that signals us
that there are more severe problems lower down in the food chain,''
said Tom Cade, who founded the Peregrine Fund in 1970 while a
professor at Cornell University.
   Peregrine Fund researchers and volunteers, who helped bring the
species back from near extinction, now are applying what they
learned to the study and preservation of raptors _ predatory birds
distinguished by talons, hooked beaks and keen eyesight _ from the
jungles of Guatemala to the plains of Africa.
   At the World Center for Birds of Prey in the southwestern Idaho
desert, researchers breed tropical raptors in captivity for release
in the wild. Others are in the field, collecting data on the birds
in their native habitat.
   Their work has led them into the battle to preserve tropical rain
forests that are home to half the world's plant and animal species
and are disappearing at the rate of 50 acres a minutes, said Bill
Burnham, the center's director.
   ``Many of the nations are beginning to see their environments as
their futures,'' Burnham said. ``If you eliminate your natural
resources, if you cut down all your forests, your children and your
grandchildren won't have much to look forward to.''
   The impact of the rain forests reaches far beyond the boundaries
of the nations they cover; many songbirds, waterfowl and raptors
considered indigenous to North America actually spend much of their
time in the tropics.
   ``Wildlife do not recognize political boundaries,'' Burnham said.
``You can't be provincial and manage a highly migratory species.''
   Little is known about many of the tropical raptors, and ``there
is no way to know how to preserve them if you know nothing about
them,'' he said.
   In its ``Maya Project'' in Guatemala and Belize, the Peregrine
Fund is studying raptors in both pristine and altered forests to see
how the birds adapt to changes in their environment. It also is
trying to determine where the birds live in the forests and how much
territory they need to survive and breed _ information that later
can be used in establishing wildlife preserves.
   For example, the harpy eagle, thought to be the most powerful
eagle in the world, may require 5,000 acres or more for each pair,
Cade said.
   Studying the birds first required finding them in the dense,
mosquito-infested jungles. From perches atop trees and ancient Mayan
temples, researchers were able to observe some birds flying above
the forest canopy. Other species were lured with taped calls. The
team has detected 26 raptor species in the two Central American
nations.
   Working with peregrines not only gave the group a scientific
background that can be applied to other raptors, but it also helped
them develop skills needed to work with other people, Burnham said.
``Cooperation is the key word. We are not a confrontational
organization. We are a conservation organization that works together
with other groups.''
   Among those cooperating on the Maya Project are Guatemala's
Institute of Anthropology and History and the Belize Department of
Agriculture.
   Though prospects of saving tropical raptors seem daunting, the
Peregrine Fund can take heart from past success when the odds were
against them.
   Because of the effects of the pesticide DDT, peregrine falcons,
once common in much of the United States, had been had reduced to 35
pairs by 1975, and none remained east of the Mississippi. Largely
through the efforts of the fund, there now are more than 600 falcons
in 25 states. The group's goal is to have the birds removed from the
endangered species list by the turn of the century.
   ``It's gone a long way further than I ever envisioned it back
when we started,'' Cade said.

<HEAD>Chicago Struggles to Cope With Measles Outbreak</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 1,100 measles cases have been reported
in Chicago as it copes with the worst outbreak in the resurgence of
the disease this year.
   The national Centers for Disease Control said 1,123 measles cases
were reported to Chicago health officials through Aug. 23, and that
78 percent have occurred in preschool children. In the United
States, 9,650 measles cases have been reported in the United States,
compared with 2,151 in the 1988 period.
   The Chicago outbreak ``is similar to others among inner-city
populations in the United States in that it involves primarily
unvaccinated black and Hispanic preschool-aged children,'' the CDC
said. Blacks and Hispanics account for 94 percent of the Chicago
cases.
   Chicago authorities have set up at least seven new vaccination
clinics, which have administered at least 21,000 doses of measles
vaccine. Door-to-door teams have given at least 2,000 more doses,
and the CDC said vaccination clinics have also been set up in four
hospital emergency departments.
   Measles, a once-common childhood disease, was believed on the
verge of eradication in this country in the early '80s _ just 1,497
cases were reported in 1983 _ but case counts have increased since.

   Federal wildlife officials plan to split the
world's only captive colony of whooping cranes this November to
reduce the chance the flock could be wiped out by disease or natural
disaster.
   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said 22 of the 54 endangered
birds at the Patuxent Wildlife Research Center would be shipped to
the International Crane Foundation in Baraboo, Wis.
   ``The service has been concerned about having all of their eggs
in one basket, literally,'' said David Trauger, the center's deputy
director. ``The service felt it was the prudent thing to do, to
separate the breeding flocks, and there's enough breeders now to do
that.''
   The center started in 1987 to breed the rare birds under a joint
program with Canadian wildlife officials. The Wisconsin foundation
was selected as the home of the new flock after considering several
groups across the nation.
   Although the foundation has not bred whooping cranes, it has
successfully bred 13 of the 14 other existing species of cranes in
the world.
   Scientists hope that by successfully breeding whooping cranes in
captivity, they will be able to establish another flock in the wild.
An attempt to do that failed in 1975 when an experimental flock at
the Grays Lake National Wildlife Refuge in Idaho failed to produce
enough eggs to sustain the colony.

<HEAD>Apache Reservation Car Death Rate Seven Times Nation's</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Indian Health Service has determined that the
2,600-square-mile White Mountain Apache Reservation in eastern
Arizona has a car-crash death rate seven times that of the nation as
a whole.
   The national Centers for Disease Control said 24 people were
killed in crashes on the reservation in 1985-86, a rate of 129 per
100,000 people. That's nearly seven times higher than the U.S. rate
of 19 per 100,000 and three times the national rate for Indians and
Alaskan Natives of 43 per 100,000.
   Vehicle death rates go up as population density goes down, and
the rural location of the Arizona tribe, population 9,300, ``may
account in part for the elevated ... death rate,'' the CDC said.
   Pedestrians accounted for seven of the 24 fatalities, and the CDC
said new streetlights were installed along pedestrian routes in
December.

<TEXT>
   A computer chip covered with a sensitive
membrane can indicate when nuclear detonators need replacement and
could lead to wristwatch-sized detectors for hazardous chemicals,
bombs and illicit drugs.
   The chip, no larger than a fingernail, was developed by Air Force
researchers. Air Force and Department of Energy researchers will
concentrate on joint study to develop chips to detect poison gases
and degrading detonators.
   ``I think what we've developed is a very sound scientific
technique that can be used for detecting very small concentrations
of gas,'' said Kolesar. The chemical-sensitive membrane lets gas
through to trigger an electronic signal.
   Such chips could be installed in nuclear warheads to detect the
chemicals given off by the degradation of chemicals in the warheads,
he said. ``What we really see though is that because the technology
is generic, by putting down different membranes ... it's essentially
limitless.''
   For example, the devices could be used by workers to signal
unacceptable levels of hazardous materials, Kolesar said.
Dosimeters, which are used in many cases to detect toxic materials,
only reveal exposure after the fact.
   Another possible application is in developing lighter and
stronger metals by combining existing metals, he said. ``There is an
optimum cure temperature and cure length cycle,'' which the chip
could be used to pinpoint.
   It also could be used to ferret out bombs by the chemicals they
emit. Current detectors for measuring contaminants are mostly bulky
and vulnerable to being confused by the presence of more than one
chemical, he said.
   The microchips so far have been developed to detect only organic
phosphate and nitrogen dioxide, said Kolesar, who has been working
on the process for 12 years. It will take another three to five
years for commercial development.
   ``It's very rewarding to change something quite dramatically,''
he said. ``You probably get only one of those opportunities in
life.''

   Now that Congress has passed the savings and

insurance funds.
   However, S&amp;L regulators said Wednesday they are not sure exactly

<HEAD>Report: Value-Added Tax Has Drawbacks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 40 percent of chief executives surveyed
nationwide favor introduction of a value-added tax to help reduce
the federal deficit, according to a report.
   But the report released Wednesday by the Conference Board offered
mixed conclusions on whether the enormous revenue potential of a
value-added tax, or VAT, outweighs its drawbacks.
   A value-added tax is passed along during the stages of
production, from raw materials suppliers to manufacturers to
wholesalers to retailers to consumers, who bear the final burden of
the tax.
   At each stage, buyers pay a progressively higher tax to sellers,
who recover a portion of the VAT paid during earlier purchases.
   The Conference Board report estimated that VAT could raise
between $13 billion and $22 billion annually in the United States
for each percentage point of tax levied.
   But it said a VAT would not be cost efficient at below 10 percent
and that countries employing the tax have rates between 15 percent
and 25 percent.
   In a survey of 400 chief executive officers asked recently to
evaluate new revenue sources to reduce the deficit, 42 percent
favored a VAT, 35 percent were opposed and 33 percent were neutral.
   ``Many like VAT because it has demonstrated its feasibility
through a history of good compliance, reasonable administrative
costs and public preference,'' Conference Board research associate
Jessica Skelly said.
   Among concerns cited in the report, though, were the cost and
number of employees that would be needed to implement and operate
the tax.
   The Internal Revenue Service estimated that in 1988 the tax would
have cost the government $700 million and required 20,000 new
employees. Other estimates have been higher, the report said.
   Also, opponents argue that VAT would only allow the government to
spend more money while not necessarily reducing the deficit and
would place a greater burden on poor families who spend more on
goods and services, the report said.
   The report also said that no way of coordinating the federal
value-added tax with state and local taxes such as sales taxes has
been determined.
   The Conference Board is a nonprofit research organization
supported by companies, trade and professional groups, government
agencies, labor unions, schools, libraries and individuals.

<HEAD>British Takeover Panel To Decide On Extension of Hoylake Bid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain's Panel on Takeovers and Mergers says it
will hold a hearing next week to decide whether Hoylake Investments
Ltd. could extend its $21.4 billion hostile bid for BAT Industries
PLC beyond the normal 60-day deadline.
   A ruling on an extension would be pivotal to the outcome of the
13.4 billion-pound hostile offer for the British conglomerate,
analysts said.
   Last week, Sir James Goldsmith, who leads Hoylake, said it would
be difficult for the offer to succeed without an extension from the
panel, an independent body which under British law monitors takeover
developments.
   The panel said Wednesday that Holylake's request would be
considered at a hearing on Wednesday.
   Hoylake made the request for an extension because it is seeking
the required approval from insurance regulators in the United States
for the acquisition of Farmers Group, BAT's U.S. insurance unit.
   Under the laws of the nine states where Farmers operates,
officials must approve any change in control of insurance concerns.
   Hoylake launched its bid for BAT on Aug. 8. Under British law the
first closing date for the offer is Oct. 7.
   Additional delays in gaining approval from insurance regulators
could put Hoylake's ability to meet that deadline into question.
   BAT has argued that the timetable is an integral part of takeover
rules and should not be altered, especially when delays in the U.S.
could have been anticipated.
   Meanwhile, Axa Midi Assurances, the French company that would
acquire Farmers if Hoylake is successful in its bid, said it had
begun seeking regulatory approval to buy the insurance company in
the states where Farmers operates.
   Farmers does business in Texas, Washington, Oregon, Illinois,
Ohio, Kansas, Idaho, Arizona and California.
   Hoylake has filed suit in those states, claiming its purchase of
BAT would not constitute a change in control of Farmers, and that
U.S. regulators have no right to hold up a deal between two foreign
companies.
   Axa has a U.S. subsidiary, Gamma Re, a reinsurer which operates
in 37 states.
   BAT's other businesses include retailing, tobacco and paper
products. It owns Saks Fifth Avenue and Marshall Field's stores,
Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp. and Appleton Papers in Wisconsin.
   Goldsmith announced last month he would sell Farmers to Axa Midi
if his bid succeeded.

<HEAD>Record Fed Intervention to Halt Dollar's Rise in May-July Period</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VIVIAN MARINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States intervened in record amounts
from late spring to mid summer to halt the dollar's sharp ascent in
foreign exchange, which resulted from higher interest rates and
political turmoil in China.
   A quarterly foreign-exchange report issued Wednesday by the
Federal Reserve Bank of New York showed the Fed and the Treasury
sold $11.92 billion in exchange for West German marks and Japanese
yen during the three months ended July 31.
   It was the largest intervention since the winter of 1978-79, when
the government leaned the opposite way, buying $6.9 billion with
marks and yen to support a dollar that was being eroded by high
inflation.
   The previous largest sale of dollars occurred when the Fed dumped
$3.2 billion from August to October of 1985. That sale reflected an
agreement among the big industrialized nations, known as the Group
of Seven, to lower the dollar's value to shrink the U.S. trade
deficit.
   The latest quarterly New York Fed report showed the government
bought $7.24 billion worth of yen and $4.68 billion worth of marks.
Overseas central banks also sold dollars, according to the report.
   The United States sold $6.74 billion in May, $4.95 billion in
June and $230 million in July.
   The dollar reached its peak of the year in early June, when it
traded at two-year highs of 2.047 marks and 151.90 yen, up roughly 9
percent and 14 percent respectively from the end of April. However,
by the end of July it was up just 3 percent against the yen and less
than 1 percent vs. the mark.
   Samuel Y. Cross, an executive vice president for the New York
Fed, attributed the retreat from the peak to the central bank dollar
sales and changing perceptions about the economy.
   Lately the dollar has been trading around 1.97 marks and 146 yen,
its highest levels since the May-July period, due to signs of
renewed strength in the economy.
   Currency traders already suspected that the Fed had intervened
heavily during the period, but the Fed's policy is to comment only
well after the fact. In early 1987 the Group of Seven nations _
Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Italy, Canada and the United
States _ agreed to work together to stabilize the currency markets
following a sharp decline in the dollar. The group also secretly set
target zones for exchange rates, although it has never confirmed
that the zones exist or what they are.
   ``All the intervention we did could be taken as an indication we
wanted to ... bring about greater stability in the exchange rates,''
said Cross. ``We're not driving it down as much as keeping it from
rising.''
   Fed intervention was the strongest in late May, when the dollar
first pierced the psychologically important 2-mark and 142-yen
levels. At that time, investment demand was strong because U.S.
interest rates remained high in comparison to rates abroad.
   During the dollar's surge, the economy appeared strong and the
trade deficit seemed to be shrinking. Traders decided to test the
central bank's firmness in holding down the dollar.
   Also adding support to the dollar was political turmoil abroad,
including the bloody crackdown against student protesters in China
and government scandals in Japan.
   By late June the dollar had softened as interest rates began to
drop and signs of slower economic growth began to emerge.

   The biggest employee-owned company in the nation
would be created if UAL Corp.'s pilots and management succeed with
their $6.75 billion bid for the parent of United Airlines.
   UAL would lead a fast-growing group. In the past two years, more
than 300 U.S. companies have been acquired by their employees,
according to Joseph R. Blasi, a business professor and expert on
employee ownership.
   Federal tax benefits and the wave of hostile buyouts have spurred
employees to take over their companies completely or acquire big
equity stakes.
   The latter category includes big corporations such as J.C. Penney
Co. Inc., Lockheed Corp., Procter &amp; Gamble Co., Polaroid Corp. and
PPG Industries Inc.
   Chicago-based UAL would enjoy marked advantages over other
employee-owned enterprises, some experts say. The company is widely
recognized as one of the strongest and most profitable in the
airline industry, giving it a head start under the new regime of
employee owners.
   UAL Chairman Stephen Wolf, who is part of the takeover team, has
said that under the proposal, the employees do not contemplate
selling any essential assets or revising plans for expanding the
airline fleet and routes.
   ``The fact that United is in good shape certainly does give
(employee ownership) a better start,'' Corey Rosen, executive
director of the National Center for Employee Ownership, said
Wednesday.
   ``It's the first time it's been tried on this scale. If it
succeeds, it would put in a whole new array of weapons for unions to
use.''
   That's a fairly big ``if.'' The Machinists union at United, whose
cooperation is considered critical, has expressed doubt that the
takeover attempt could succeed because it would require enormous new
debt.
   ``I look at it sort of pessimistically now, because we've done an
analysis on United Airlines ... I think they've put a price on it
that's too overpriced,'' John Peterpaul, general vice president of
the Machinists, said Wednesday. ``We don't see the future as rosy as
a lot of people see it.''
   That stance appeared to strengthen the chances that billionaire
investor Marvin Davis could succeed in his rival bid for UAL.
   If the pilot-management attempt does prevail, UAL would displace
car rental giant Avis Inc. as the nation's largest company owned by
its employees.
   An employee stock ownership plan, or ESOP, representing 11,000
Avis workers in the United States took the company private in a
$1.75 billion buyout in September 1987.
   Avis Chairman Joseph Vittoria says he received a letter over a
year ago from the United pilots seeking his advice on ESOPs.
   ``I don't think UAL's size is a hindrance to an ESOP,'' Vittoria
said in a telephone interview. Asked whether its size could actually
be an advantage for employee ownership, he replied, ``It could be,
but it depends on management getting employees involved.''
   Avis has a multi-tiered employee participation program that is
considered a model by some experts. Worker representatives are
elected by their co-workers and participate in monthly
district-level meetings with managers to review operations and make
suggestions.
   The local groups also elect representatives to attend quarterly
zone meetings, semi-annual regional meetings and an annual
company-wide meeting.
   Under the UAL pilot-management proposal, British Airways PLC
would own 15 percent of UAL's stock for an investment of $750
million. The employees would agree to unspecified wage concessions
in exchange for participation in an ESOP that would give them 75
percent of the company.
   News reports have indicated that the pilots union might invest as
much as $1 billion. The rest of the buyout funding apparently would
be borrowed.
   Only a small proportion, about 15 percent, of the employees
participating in ESOPs are unionized. But the pilots, Machinists and
flight attendants at United, the nation's second-largest airline,
are strong unionists.
   UAL under employee ownership ``would have to be run as a
partnership, not as a feudal barony,'' said Blasi, a professor at
California Polytechnic University in San Luis Obispo, whose book,
``Employee Ownership: Revolution or Ripoff?'' is critical of some
ESOPs.
   ``In the airline industry, most ESOPs have not been combined with
a strong employee involvement program. Board seats are not enough,''
he said.
   Blasi said he is waiting to see specific details from Wolf and
the pilots on how labor-management committees would be set up to
address problems and make decisions.
   He cited a 1983-84 experiment with partial employee ownership at
Eastern Airlines, under former chairman Frank Borman, which he
called ``a great success.'' Under the program, Eastern employees
generated ideas to improve productivity.
   An ESOP at Western Airlines, before it was merged into Delta Air
Lines, also was a good example of labor-management cooperation,
Blasi said.
   America West Airlines, an aggressive regional carrier based in
Tempe, Ariz., is about 20 percent owned by its employees. And Delta
established an ESOP in July, in a moved widely viewed as a deterrent
to unwanted suitors as takeover speculation swept through the
airline industry.

<HEAD>Report Says Government Failing to Track Economy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The White House budget office has been blamed
for the inability of government statisticians to track significant
changes in the economy and their effect on people and businesses,
even while spending some $2 billion this year trying.
   While the skills of workers are increasingly recognized as key to
economic growth and improving the nation's competitiveness, the
government spends nearly seven times more collecting data on
agriculture than education, said the congressional Office of
Technology Assessment.
   ``It seems unlikely that this is the right ratio, given the
transformation under way in the economy,'' the agency said Wednesday
in a 40-page report. ``Even worse, no organization in either the
executive branch or the Congress has assumed responsibility for
asking whether it's the right ratio.''
   The report, ``Statistical Needs for a Changing U.S. Economy,''
said the White House Office of Management and Budget was told in
1980 to set priorities and coordinate the government's
statistics-collecting efforts.
   ``While it has a mandate to perform this task,'' the technology
experts said, ``OMB has not given it much priority and has dedicated
few resources to the effort.''
   Efforts by agencies in the Labor, Commerce, Health and Human
Services and other departments to correct shortcomings have been
hampered by White House budget officials, said the report, which was
requested by the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee.
   As an example, it cited cuts in the budgets of most agencies for
collecting and analyzing data during the past eight years and a
resistance by OMB officials to allow new surveys sought by
statisticians.
   ``These organizations are painfully aware of the problems,'' the
researchers said. ``The greatest problem appears to be the absence
of any central place in government where basic questions about
priorities in statistics are being asked.''
   Sen. Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M., chairman of the Senate panel's
subcommittee on government information and regulation, said Congress
will likely have to force the issue when the 1980 Paperwork
Reduction Act comes up for reauthorization next year.
   Barbara Clay, a spokeswoman for the White House budget office,
said its officials had not seen the report and so could not comment
on it immediately.
   The congressional researchers acknowledged it has become much
more difficult to develop meaningful statistics on economic growth
and productivity with the emergence of an international market and a
service-based U.S. economy.
   ``The most important inputs purchased by a business may be
research and engineering information and the skills and education of
its employees,'' it said. ``The existing statistical system makes it
extremely difficult to anticipate the potential impact of emerging
technologies.''
   It cited computers and how changes in their capabilities and
prices are reflected in the nation's economic growth, inflation and
productivity figures. For example, it said, the price of one
megabyte of computer memory capacity fell by 95 percent between 1972
and 1987.
   ``Measuring changes in the quality of computers, however, can
seem easy in comparison with the challenge of measuring changes in
the quality of services,'' the report said. ``How do you measure
quality changes in legal services?''
   Changes in the quality of health care and education, which
together account for more than one-sixth of the nation's gross
national product, are not measured at all, the report said.

<HEAD>Government To Allow Drexel To Pay Milkens; Firm To Enter Plea</HEAD>

   After months of challenges and delays, Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc. is scheduled to plead guilty to securities
crimes Monday and formally settle the highly publicized Wall Street
corruption case.
   The court date was set after prosecutors switched course and
allowed the investment firm to pay its former junk-bond chief,
Michael Milken, his 1988 compensation of more than $100 million,
removing the last roadblock to the plea bargain.
   ``We are pleased that the government has reversed its position
and dropped the unconstitutional provisions of its settlement with
Drexel,'' Arthur Liman, a lawyer for Milken, said in a statement
released Wednesday by a Milken spokesman.
   ``These unconstitutional provisions were a gross abuse of
prosecutorial power,'' the statement said. ``Perhaps now the
government will also reconsider its use and abuse in this case of
the Draconian RICO statute.''
   A 98-count indictment in March charged Milken and his brother
Lowell with wide-ranging securities law and Racketeer Influenced and
Corrupt Organization Act violations. A broader indictment is
expected next month.
   The hearing Monday before U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood in
Manhattan should end months of negotiations and challenges over an
agreement announced in January in the government's insider trading
probe.
   The government's reversal to allow Drexel to pay its indicted
former bond financier was made in court papers filed late last week.
The move was first reported to be under consideration last month.
   Under the plea agreement, Drexel will enter guilty pleas to six
securities and mail fraud felonies. The firm also has agreed to pay
$650 million in fines and restitution.
   The pact had required Drexel to fire Milken and withhold his
compensation for last year, estimated in court papers at more than
$100 million. The agreement also had barred Drexel from giving
Lowell Milken more than half his 1988 pay.
   Both Milkens have since resigned from Drexel.
   In a letter to Wood filed in U.S. District Court late Friday,
Assistant U.S. Attorney John K. Carroll said prosecutors dropped the
pay provisions because of a bail agreement in which the government
will monitor hundreds of millions of dollars of the Milkens' assets.
   ``In light of this security, the matter of any payment to be made
by Drexel to the Milkens can be resolved adequately between Drexel
and the Milkens,'' the letter said.
   Lawyers for the Milkens immediately dropped a motion filed in
January challenging the plea agreement on the grounds that it
unfairly denied the brothers their 1988 pay.
   Defense lawyers and other experts following the case have said
they surmised the government dropped the provision withholding pay
because of a belief it would be rejected in court as
unconstitutional.
   Sources familiar with the case said the government acted
independently.
   ``It was the government deciding on its own, 100 percent, that
they wanted to drop it,'' said one source who asked not to be named.
   A separate settlement with Drexel of fraud and insider trading
charges by the Securities and Exchange Commission is to take effect
once Drexel enters its plea. Under that deal, Drexel has agreed to
broad structural changes and federal supervision for three years.

<HEAD>Settlements Approved in WPPSS Bondholder Suit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S. District judge says that plaintiffs in the
nation's largest municipal-bond default might have gotten
significantly smaller awards had they won their case at trial
instead of settling.
   U.S. District Judge William D. Browning of Tucson, Ariz., on
Tuesday approved settlements to allow $750 million to be distributed
to holders of Washington Public Power Supply System bonds in what he
called ``one of the most complex lawsuits in the history of
securities litigation.''.
   ``There is more than adequate reason to conclude that the
aggregate amount of these settlements ... is fully satisfactory,
given the risks associated with a full trial of the issues,'' said
Chemical Bank of New York, trustee for the bondholders, in a
statement quoting the judge's 106-page opinion, which was not
immediately available.
   It was Browning who presided over the enormously complicated
WPPSS litigation that in the last year resulted in settlements
between Chemical Bank and defendants in the case.
   The trial began a year ago in Tucson but defendants reached
settlements by January. In April, Browning held a fairness hearing
on the settlement in Seattle.
   William H. Berls, a Chemical Bank vice president who has handled
WPPSS matters, on Wednesday called Browning's ruling a ``carte
blanche'' approval of the negotiated settlements.
   ``This is a major milestone in the WPPSS litigation,'' he said.
``The bondholders are just one step away from distribution'' of the
settlement money.
   The final step is for Browning to schedule a distribution
hearing, at which attorneys will argue precisely how the funds
should be distributed, Berls said. No such hearing has been
scheduled, he said.
   In determining the distribution, the judge will emphasize when
each bondholder purchased the bonds, Berls said. The plaintiffs in
the case essentially broke down into two types of bondholders: those
who purchased their bonds before the default on June 15, 1983, and
those who bought bonds afterward.
   In 1983, WPPSS defaulted on $2.25 billion in bonds it had sold to
finance construction of a nuclear power plant at the Hanford nuclear
reservation in Eastern Washington and another at Satsop, west of
Olympia. WPPSS had abandoned construction of those two plants in
1982 because of rising construction costs and doubts about the need
for the plants' power.
   The default was triggered by a Washington state Supreme Court
ruling that the participating utilities lacked the legal power to
sign contracts with WPPSS guaranteeing payment even if no
electricity was generated.
   Dozens of lawsuits were combined into one action against WPPSS,
all 88 utilities that contracted with the consortium to build the
two reactors, engineering firms, Wall Street bond underwriters,
utility and WPPSS directors and a consulting firm.
   The settlements approved require the defendants to pay $580
million into the Chemical Bank-administered settlement fund.
Together with $107 million in settlements approved earlier, plus
interest, the amount available for distribution in December would be
$750 million, Berls said.
   Berls said Chemical Bank was not worried that Browning would have
exercised his other option, that of rejecting the settlements.
   Browning's ruling ``validated all the actions we've taken,''
Berls said.
   ``I think the court by taking the action it did endorsed the end
we were all trying to reach, which was peace,'' he said.
   WPPSS paid no money in the settlement in exchange for cooperation
from its employees at the trial. Plaintiff's attorneys said there
wasn't enough money left in WPPSS to pursue.
   WPPSS was building five nuclear reactors to generate electricity
in the late 1970s, but only one was completed. Two remain
``mothballed'' for construction to resume if enough demand
materializes for the electricity they would produce.

   A 21.4 percent rise in late-August car and light
truck sales may be a sign that sales will drop dramatically as the
calendar year draws to a close, analysts say.
   The eight major U.S. based automakers reported Wednesday that
their vehicles sold at an average daily rate of 49,276 during the
Aug. 21-31 period this year, compared with a rate of 40,578 during
the same time last year.
   ``We think a lot of the volume that we're seeing here is really
coming out of the fourth quarter of this year or the first quarter
of next year,'' said analyst John Kirnan of Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. of
New York City.
   ``The $64,000 question is really how bad is volume going to be in
the fourth quarter,'' he said.
   With overseas makers' results added in, car and truck sales were
up 8.4 percent in August over the same month last year. Car sales
rose 11.2 percent and truck sales were 2.2 percent higher for the
month.
   Typically, dealers offer closeout deals as the model year draws
to a close, traditionally on Sept. 30. On top of that, manufacturers
have been offering customers and dealers incentives that lower the
prices of 1989 cars.
   Consumers also have been learning that prices for 1990 cars will
rise, prompting some to buy now rather than later.
   ``Consumers have been bombarded by these price hikes on the 1990
models going up anywhere from 2 (percent) to 9 percent,'' said
analyst Kathleen Heaney of Nikko Securities Co. International Inc.
of New York City. ``Domestic automakers haven't done that in a long
time.
   ``It's people out there thinking `I've got to buy a car by the
end of the year.'''
   Herb Adcox, owner of Adcox Chevrolet in Chattanooga, Tenn., said
he has seen some increased traffic through his showroom recently,
and incentives are the reason.
   ``With this factory incentive that they have given the dealers,
it's going to lower the price of the car,'' he said. ``I just hope
that it works.
   ``If it doesn't you've got a lot of dealers who are not going to
order '90 models. They can't have inventory on top of inventory.''
   For the first eight months of this year, domestic and imported
car and truck sales were running 3.7 percent behind the pace of last
year, the second-best year in history. Car sales were down 4.1
percent and truck sales were off 2.7 percent.
   Domestic automakers held 77.3 percent of the car and truck market
at the end of August, up from 76 percent at the same time last year.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The American consumer's continuing taste for
chicken has prompted McDonald's Corp. to begin eyeing the
fried-chicken market.
   McDonald's has begun a new test at six restaurants in Dallas and
six in Houston, selling combination packets of two, three and nine
pieces of deep-fried chicken.
   ``Americans are going toward lighter eating and we're following
the tastes of America,'' said Tom Horler, regional marketing manager
for the Dallas region.
   The company already serves chicken in sandwiches, salads and in
bite-size boneless bits.
   ``The testing is in the embryonic stage,'' said Horler. ``The
question is, can we deliver a good quality, value-priced product in
the quick environment we have?''
   To find this out, the company is looking at how its equipment is
handling the new product and what customers think about it.
   Sometimes, as with the company's experimental pizza, the product
goes back to the kitchen for a recipe makeover after the operational
testing and before it goes out for a full market test.
   McDonald's salads were in the testing phase for 10 years before
being made generally available, Horler said.
   The fried chicken is being sold after 4 p.m., aimed at the family
dinner business.
   There are three combinations: two pieces, a breast and leg,
selling for $1.99; three pieces, breast, leg and thigh, for $2.89;
and nine pieces, three breasts, three legs and three thighs for
$7.89. Dinner rolls are included.
   The chicken is kept frozen and then fried for customers.
   No decision has been made on whether to expand the fried chicken
experiment, Horler said.

   The European Economic Community's
average jobless rate was 9.3 percent in July, unchanged from the
previous three months and 0.1 points below the rates of January and
February, the EEC statistics agency Eurostat said Thursday.
   ``In the six months to July 1989, the unemployment rate for the
Community as a whole has remained stable,'' Eurostat reported.
   ``Falls in Spain (-1.3 percent), the United Kingdon (-0.6
percent) and Ireland (-0.3 percent) have been offset by rises in
Denmark (0.6 percent) and Italy (0.3 percent) while the rates in all
other member states have remained broadly unchanged.''
   Eurostat said the jobless rates have stabilized for both men and
women at 7.3 and 12.2 percent respectively.
   It gave no figure for the total number of jobless in July,
because of a new calculating method used in the Netherlands. The
figure for June was 14.1 million.
   Eurostat reported these unemployment rates for each EEC state at
the end of July: Belgium, 9.7 percent; Denmark, 7.3 percent; West
Germany, 5.8 percent; Spain, 17 percent; France, 10.1 percent;
Ireland, 17.1 percent; Italy, 10.9 percent; Luxembourg, 2 percent;
Netherlands, 10 percent; Portugal, 5.6 percent and Great Britain,
6.7 percent.

   H.J. Heinz Co. Chairman Anthony J.F. O'Reilly
says his company and animal rights activists stand in agreement _
the slaughter of dolphins caught with yellowfin tuna must end.
   Aside from humanitarian reasons, O'Reilly said, Heinz has a
commercial interest in saving the dolphins because dolphins swim
with tuna in the eastern Pacific Ocean, leading fishing boats to
their catch.
   ``We have more interest in the porpoise than they have ... if you
see them as the sheepdog of the sea,'' O'Reilly said. ``The simple
truth is that releasing dolphins represent a more successful fishing
technique than ignoring their safety.''
   O'Reilly reacted after about 50 protesters, led by the San
Francisco-based Earth Island Institute, picketed Heinz's annual
shareholders meeting at a downtown hotel Wednesday, carrying
anti-Heinz signs and chanting, ``Boycott tuna. Boycott Heinz.''
   Two protesters _ Todd Patterson, 23, of Pittsburgh, and Mark
Heitchue, 24, of Santa Cruz, Calif. _ lowered themselves from a
nearby eight-story building and unfurled a banner reading, ``Heinz
Stop Killing Dolphins,'' before police arrested them on disorderly
conduct, criminal trespass and criminal mischief charges.
   Another protest organizer, Candace Batycki of San Francisco,
briefly disrupted the shareholders' meeting by screaming, ``You're
slaughtering dolphins. What kind of world do you want to live in?''
   Protesters and company officials agreed thousands of dolphins are
being killed with yellowfin tuna in large, encircling nets set
mostly by foreign fishermen.
   Ms. Batycki estimated at least 150,000 dolphins die in the catch
annually.
   ``It's not necessary to fish on dolphins, just easier,'' she
said. ``They (Heinz) have a lot of power in their hands. They have
the power to end this.''
   Protesters claimed a boycott of tuna products has hurt Heinz's
StarKist Seafood Co. subsidiary and other producers. O'Reilly
estimated Pacific yellowfin tuna represents 20 percent of StarKist's
catch.
   But Heinz, in its first-quarter earnings report issued Tuesday,
said StarKist's tuna contributed to a 15 percent increase in
earnings.
   ``Our sales of tuna are at an all-time high,'' O'Reilly said.
   But he told shareholders the killing of dolphins was ``a
legitimate concern.''
   ``We're doing everything we can to save the porpoise,'' O'Reilly
said.
   A new $100,000 research program, announced by StarKist last
Thursday, promises to find ways of using sound to lure dolphins away
or out of fishing nets, he said.
   Heinz spokesman D. Edward I. Smyth said the company is willing to
spend more if early research is fruitful.
   None of about 3,000 Heinz shareholders questioned O'Reilly about
the dolphins issue, but they applauded warmly at a review of Heinz's
television commercials and when O'Reilly announced a two-for-one
stock split and a 16.7 percent increase in quarterly dividends.
   On other matters, O'Reilly said Heinz will not accept irradiated
food from suppliers and will not use radiation in any of its food
processing.
   Sister Patricia Daly of the Sisters of St. Dominic of Caldwell,
N.J., representing several Roman Catholic institutions holding Heinz
stock, said Heinz's policy follows a request by the Interfaith
Center on Corporate Responsibility.
   She called Heinz's policy ``an unprecedented move by any U.S.
corporation.''
   O'Reilly also told reporters the company is trying to expand its
food products into the ``gray market'' of senior citizens. He said
Heinz believes today's consumers will be more concerned with
``health and wellness'' as they age.
   He declined to speculate what products or companies the food
conglomerate might produce or buy.

<HEAD>Polly Peck Buying Del Monte's Fresh Fruit from RJR</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   RJR Nabisco Inc. has agreed to sell its fresh
fruit operations of Del Monte Corp. to the British conglomerate
Polly Peck International PLC for $875 million in cash, both
companies announced today.
   The sale of Del Monte Tropical Fruit Co. represents the second
major step by RJR toward divesting around $5.5 billion in food
assets to help offset expenses incurred in the $25 billion buyout by
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. earlier this year.
   In June, RJR sold five European food businesses to BSN SA of
France for $2.5 billion.
   The Del Monte unit being acquired sells bananas, pineapples,
papayas, mangoes and other fresh fruits, and represents about a
quarter of Del Monte's sales, which totaled $600 million last year.
   The acquisition, due to be completed by the end of October, is
expected to boost Polly Peck's sales by about 50 percent, according
to the company.
   ``The acquisition of Del Monte represents a remarkable
opportunity for (Polly Peck) to establish itself as one of the
world's largest suppliers of fresh fruit and vegetables,'' Polly
Peck Chairman Asil Nadir said in a statement.
   London-based Polly Peck already markets fruits and vegetables
grown in the Middle East under the brand name of Sun Zest. It also
has interests in electronics, textiles and hotels.
   Del Monte is the world's largest distributor of fresh pineapples
and third largest distributor of bananas. Other Del Monte units
include Del Monte Foods USA and separate units in Europe, Latin
America, Canada and the Far East.
   RJR Chairman Louis V. Gerstner Jr. said several parties have
expressed an interest in acquiring other Del Monte businesses. ``We
are reviewing those proposals but there has been no final decision
yet,'' he said.
   Polly Peck said it planned to finance the acquisition through a
rights issue and bank loans.

<BYLINE>Pacific Lumber Heirs Sue Drexel Over Buyout</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>EUREKA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three ex-heirs to the Pacific Lumber Co.
have filed suit against Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. of New York,
charging fraud during the financing of a hostile buyout of the
company.
   The suit filed Wednesday in Humboldt County Superior Court said
Stanwood Murphy Jr., Suzanne Murphy and Warren Murphy received $40 a
share for stock that was actually worth more than $70 a share. It
seeks $18 million from Drexel to cover the difference.
   The Murphys are descendants of Simon J. Murphy, who bought
Pacific Lumber in Humboldt County in 1905. It was bought by Texas
investor Charles Hurwitz's Maxxam Group in 1985.
   The suit also names as defendants former Drexel junk-bond king
Michael Milken and former Wall Street financier Ivan Boesky, who the
suit claims secretly bought stock for Drexel.
   The suit claims a scheme to take over the lumber company at a
cheaper price was worked out in secret talks in the spring of 1985
between Drexel and unnamed Maxxam officals. Hurwitz was not named as
a defendant in the suit.
   According to the lawsuit, Drexel ``knew it would be able to sell
these shares to Maxxam, through Boesky, at a profit,'' but did not
disclose its intentions.
   The suit contends that at the time Maxxam was attempting the
takeover, Drexel filed a false affidavit indicating that it did not
own any Pacific Lumber stock.
   The suit contends Drexel owned more than 5 percent of the redwood
lumber company with Boesky acting as its representative.
   Pacific Lumber's articles of incorporation required 80 percent
shareholder approval of a merger deal if any stockholder owned more
than 5 percent of the company. Maxxam held about 4.6 percent of the
company's stock.
   Since Drexel concealed its stake during the takeover attempt,
shareholders assumed that the Maxxam bid needed only 51 percent
shareholder approval, the suit contends. Many shareholders,
believing they would be unable to stop a simple-majority approval,
decided to sell to Maxxam, the suit maintains.
   The suit says that concern that the Drexel affidavit was false
surfaced in September of 1988 when the Securities and Exchange
Commission filed charges against Drexel in a celebrated
securities-fraud case.
   Drexel has agreed to settle that case by pleading guilty to six
felony fraud counts and paying a $650 million fine.
   Boesky is serving a federal prison sentence after pleading guilty
to unrelated securities-law violations. Los Angeles-based Milken,
former head of Drexel's junk-bond unit, has been charged with
separate securities violations.
   Drexel officials could not be reached for comment.

   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 9 to 5 in the early tally of
New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 603 up, 352 down and 545

<HEAD>Easy Confirmation Expected for Successor to Manhattan U.S. Attorney</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush has nominated prominent
Manhattan defense lawyer Otto G. Obermaier as successor to former
U.S. attorney Rudolph Giuliani, the crime-busting prosecutor now
running for New York mayor.
   Obermaier's nomination Wednesday, which had been widely
anticipated, is expected to receive routine confirmation by members
of the Senate Judiciary Committee, though Giuliani once said he
opposed the nomination because Obermaier's firm has represented
targets of securities fraud investigations.
   ``I may be naive in that regard but I am more than happy to
answer any of their questions,'' Obermaier said in an interview from
New York after the nomination was announced.
   ``I've practiced law for 30 years and the great thing about being
a litigator is we do all our professional work in public. The
mistakes and the glories and the victories are all a matter of
public record,'' he said.
   Obermaier, 53, said he has none of the skeletons in the closet
that have derailed some recent federal judicial nominations, as well
as sitting politicians.
   ``I don't think I buy outdated milk,'' he said. ``I don't think I
speed _ at least I don't get caught at it. I pay my taxes. I'll even
answer questions like, Have I ever used drugs? ... The answer is
indeed no.''
   Giuliani, who resigned Jan. 31, has been temporarily succeeded by
acting U.S. attorney Benito Romano, who said he would work with
Obermaier for a smooth transition and then would return to private
law practice.
   As U.S. attorney, Giuliani was at the forefront of the recent
Wall Street scandals, prosecuting numerous cases of insider trading
and stock manipulation.
   Obermaier, of Syosset, N.Y., is a founding partner in the law
firm Obermaier, Morvillo and Abramowitz, which specializes in
white-collar cases. He was recommended for the job in January by
Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y.
   From 1964 to 1968, Obermaier was an assistant U.S. attorney in
the Southern District, prosecuting cases involving organized crime,
tax evasion and narcotics. His boss was Robert M. Morgenthau, who is
now Manhattan district attorney.

   Several European central banks intervened in
currency markets Thursday in a move apparently intended to hold down
the surging U.S. dollar.
   Central banks in West Germany, France, Spain and Italy confirmed
that they were selling dollars, and sources close to the Bank of
England said that institution was selling dollars against the West
German mark.
   Traders in Frankfurt, West Germany, said the Bank of Canada and
the U.S. Federal Reserve Board also were participating in the
intervention.
   The Swiss National Bank said it had sold dollars against the
Swiss franc.
   The dollar was quoted at 1.9902 marks in Frankfurt in afternoon
trading, only slightly higher than its morning level.
   Gold prices, meanwhile, declined.
   In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 146.87 yen, up 0.22 yen from
Wednesday's close. In afternoon training in London the dollar was
quoted at 147.02 yen.
   The pound sterling fell to $1.5390 in London trading, compared to
Wednesday's late $1.5552 rate.
   Other dollar rates in Europe compared with levels late Wednesday,
included: 1.7180 Swiss francs, up from 1.7045; 6.7050 French francs,
up from 6.6480; 2.2402 Dutch guilders, up from 2.2280; 1,425.50
Italian lire, up from 1,417.50; and 1.1822 Canadian dollars, up from
1.1798.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $359.00 a troy ounce,
down from $360.25 late Wednesday. At mid morning, the city's five
major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $359.20.
   In Zurich, gold traded at $359.20, down from $359.75 late
Wednesday.
   Gold in Hong Kong dropped the equivalent of 76 cents an ounce
today to close at $359.71, compared with Wednesday's $360.47.
   Silver bullion traded in London at $5.11 bid a troy ounce, down
from $5.12 late Wednesday.

<HEAD>Miller Brewing Co. Says Will Stop Making Matilda Bay Wine Cooler</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Miller Brewing Co. says it will stop
production of its Matilda Bay wine cooler in early November because
of poor sales.
   ``From a business standpoint, it is economically imprudent for us
to continue production and marketing of Matilda Bay,'' Thomas A.
Koehler, vice president of sales, said in a prepared statement
Wednesday.
   Koehler said the wine cooler segment declined more than 14
percent in 1988 and industry analysts are predicting this rate of
decline to continue or increase this year.
   Miller said the action would not affect employment at its brewery
in Albany, Ga., the only facility where Matilda Bay is produced.
   Beverly Jurkowski, a Miller spokeswoman, said employees now
working on the Matilda Bay line would get jobs in other areas of the
brewery.
   Ms. Jurkowski said Matilda Bay had climbed to the fourth most
popular wine cooler in the country, but said the brand never made
money nationally.
   ``The chips get pretty spread out by the time you get to No. 4,''
she said.
   The product differed from most wine coolers in that it was
non-carbonated.
   Miller's move means Stroh Brewery Co., Detroit, will be the only
major brewery still selling wine coolers.

<TEXT>
   Politics are secondary to business in
sultry Shanghai, where teeming sidewalks, old brick mansions and
bustling bars and dance halls yield few signs that police crushed
mass protests two months ago.
   Shanghai residents, once famous for their business acumen in
China and beyond, are more concerned about the economy than with
political maneuverings to the north in the capital Beijing, city
officials and citizens say.
   So far, Shanghai has been spared nationwide moves to suppress
private entrepreneurs and capitalist ideas. Some attribute the
reprieve to the protection of former Shanghai leader Jiang Zemin,
who in June replaced ousted leader Zhao Ziyang as head of China's
Communist Party.
   In contrast with Beijing, guarded by armed soldiers, Shanghai
seems almost apolitical.
   The university students who led the pro-democracy demonstrations
here in June face mandatory political education, but Shanghai's
workers have been spared that fate.
   ``A worker's first responsibility is to produce,'' says Yang
Xianghai, deputy chief of the City Planning Commission. ``Our
workers need to improve the quality of their work, their morality
and discipline, but we're not having political education.''
   Shanghai seems to be busy making up for time lost in June as it
tries to proceed with an ambitious industrial restructuring program
aimed at making the city an international economic center that would
resurrect its historical preeminence in Asia.
   Government figures show the sprawling city's industrial output
has jumped by more than 77 percent over the past nine years because
of economic liberalization and joint ventures with foreigners that
range from medical equipment to aircraft and car assembly.
   But Shanghai remains encumbered a burgeoning population of more
than 6 million people that overwhelm the decaying infrastructure of
a city still crammed with crumbling 40-year-old factories.
   City planners say one of their main goals is to replace plants
that produce cheap products like windup watches and plastic toys
with industries that make high-tech goods for sale abroad.
   ``We want to increase our exports, which now account for only 15
percent of our total production, with high quality bicycles and
electronics goods, sophisticated electrical machinery and basic
industrial inputs,'' Yang says.
   ``We've been producing just about everything here, and it's not
to our advantage. It's too disorganized,'' he says. ``We're paring
away sectors that aren't much use. There are some industries we just
won't be able to save.''
   The city faces severe shortages of raw materials and energy in
its efforts to modernize. An official report noted recently that
many factories were closed for two or three days a week due because
of insufficient electricity and other scarce resources.
   Shanghai's mostly state-controlled industries also have suffered
from China's general predicament of skyrocketing costs for raw
materials while retail prices remain under strict controls.
   For decades, China relied on Shanghai's state-run industries to
help foot the government's bill for the rest of the developing
economy. The city retained little for its own upkeep.
   A new policy allowing Shanghai to use locally all but 17 percent
of its tax revenues gave the city an extra 1.4 billion yuan, worth
about $376 million at today's exchange rates, but a nationwide
economic slowdown and a year-old fiscal austerity program have
resulted in a 3 billion-yuan shortfall in investment funds, Zhu
Xiaohua, deputy director of the Shanghai branch of the People's Bank
of China, reported recently.
   In the first six months of this year, the city postponed
construction of 1,612 projects and slashed its total investment by
5.16 billion yuan or about $1.39 billion.
   It also stopped or restricted production of 109 products as it
set priorities for using scarce resources.
   In a bid to scrounge additional cash, the city sent salesmen to
China's remote northwestern provinces of Inner Mongolia and
Xinjiang, where factories aren't so plentiful, to try to sell an
estimated 1 billion yuan worth of excess televisions, refrigerators,
washing machines and bicycles, Yang said.
   Plans to make Shanghai an international financial center also
have been stymied by the lack of available cash, foreign executives
and officials say.
   Shanghai's fledgling stock exchange, where 1,625 companies have
issued shares, has a total stock value of only 800 million yuan or
$215 million.
   Yang says the city hopes to go ahead, however, with major
renovation and modernization projects, including a new harbor, a
subway system and new sewage and telephone lines, despite foreign
exchange and local currency shortfalls.
   Shanghai's government also is building satellite towns around the
city and plans to raze old buildings to make way for spacious
apartment blocks and green parks. Industrial centers and
international hotels are sprouting amid the city's old red and gray
brick mansions.
   Shanghai's ability to pull off plans to create a modern city in
the end may depend on the fate of Shanghai's leaders _ urbane
bureaucrats like Communist Party Secretary General Jiang and
Shanghai Mayor Zhu Rongji.
   Some analysts attribute the city's continuing relative freedom to
pursue its economic goals to Jiang's protection. But Jiang is
increasingly being seen as an interim leader whose influence at the
top may be short-lived.

<HEAD>Soybean Futures Rise On Crop Forecast, Harvest Fears</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices rose strongly early in
today's session on the Chicago Board of Trade, boosted by a bullish
private crop estimate, new export sales and fears that rain could
slow the harvest.
   Grain futures were mostly higher in early trading.
   Some of the soybean buying sprouted from new crop estimates
released late Wednesday by Sparks Commodities Inc., a Memphis,
Tenn.-based analytical firm, that were lower than the Agriculture
Department's August projections.
   Sparks pegged the 1989 U.S. soybean crop at 1.85 billion bushels
compared with the USDA's 1.91-billion-bushel estimate. Sparks
projected the corn harvest at 7.13 billion bushels compared with the
USDA's August estimate of 7.35 billion.
   The USDA will revise its crop estimates on Tuesday.
   A USDA report of a sale of 200,000 metric tons of U.S. soybeans
to unknown destinations prompted further selling, as did fears that
continued wet weather in the Midwest could delay the corn and
soybean harvest, which gets underway in about three weeks.
   ``The ideal weather now would be 80 degrees and dry for the next
four weeks,'' said Gerald Zusel, manager of Board of Trade floor
operations for Balfour Maclaine Corp., a futures brokerage firm.
   In early trading, wheat futures were \ cent lower to } cents
higher with the contract for delivery in September at $3.97{ a
bushel; corn was { cent to 1\ cents higher with September at $2.36}
a bushel; oats were unchanged to } cent higher with December at
$1.46\ a bushel; soybeans were 4{ cents to 7 cents higher with
September at $5.94 a bushel.
   Cattle and pork-belly futures were higher in early trading on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange while hog futures declined.
   Live cattle were .05 cent to .38 cent higher with October at
72.75 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .18 cent to .43 cent higher
with September at 82.35 cents a pound; live hogs were .02 cent to
.10 cent lower with October at 39.57 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .50 cent to 1.38 cent higher with February at 46.20
cents a pound.
   All livestock and meat futures settled higher on Wednesday.

<HEAD>U.S.-Korea Telecommunications Talks Bog Down</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL SHIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Talks on opening South Korea's closed
telecommunications market to the United States bogged down Thursday
with both sides showing few signs of compromise, officials said.
   The Seoul talks were called after the United States named South
Korea as an unfair trader in telecommunications in February under
the 1988 Trade Act calling for tough retaliatory trade sanctions.
   The meeting began Wednesday and continued until late Thursday
night but there was little chances of agreement, said officials at
the Communications Ministry.
   Gordana Earp, the chief U.S. delegate, asked South Korea to
announce a timetable to open its market before July 1 next year but
Seoul officials refused to comply, saying their telecommunications
industry needs two or three more years to grow, the ministry
official said.
   South Korea expressed willingness to accept parts of Washington's
demands to open its market to U.S. telecommunications equipment but
refused to allow direct U.S. investment in the market for
value-added networks, the official said.
   Earp strongly indicated that Washington may impose trade
sanctions against South Korea unless its demand was fully accepted,
he said.
   The telecommunications talks were the first in a series of
intensive trade negotations scheduled in the coming months between
the two countries.
   Seoul officials are concerned that Washington's trade pressure
will get tougher in the coming months when U.S. Vice President Dan
Quayle, Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher and Trade Representative
Carla Hills visit Seoul.
   Mosbacher is scheduled to visit Seoul Sunday through Tuesday to
discuss wide-ranging trade issues, presumably with emphasis on South
Korea's market-opening measures.
   Mosbacher is expected to seek to further open South Korea's
agricultural market to U.S. beef and other farm products and demand
Seoul's stricter protection of U.S. intellectual property rights,
Korean officials said.
   The two countries signed an agreement for protection of
intellectual property rights in 1985 but the United States has
complained that South Korea neglected its strict enforcement.
   Mosbacher is also expected to raise a plan by Du Pont Co. to
construct a $150 million plant in South Korea.
   South Korea, under Washington's pressure, opened its market to
243 U.S. agricultural products in May but the United States says the
action was not enough, accoring to Seoul officials.
   South Korea is Washington's second largest agricultural market in
the world after Japan. It imported $2.3 billion worth of U.S. farm
products last year.
   Washington ran a trade deficit of $8.5 billion with South Korea
last year.

<HEAD>Japanese Investment Increases in Britian</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japanese businesses are ``more anxious than ever''
to gain a foothold in Britian before the European Community forms a
single market in 1992, British officials and businessmen said
Thursday.
   ``The Japanese fear that after 1992, they will be locked out by a
fortress Europe,'' said Danny Sharpe, director of investment in the
government's Department of Trade and Industry-Northeast.
   ``They are more anxious than ever to get into our area before
1992 to conform with our way of doing things. Our inquiry rate is
greater than ever before,'' Sharpe said.
   The 12-member European Community in 1992 will form the largest
single market in the world, which will comprise more than 350
million people.
   ``The north of England is the number one choice in Europe for
Japanese investment,'' said Chris Fraser, director of the Agency for
Development in the North of England (NDC).
   With 33 Japanese companies operating in the area _ the majority
in the last few years _ a package that includes tax incentives,
investment allowances and freedom from planning restrictions for
Japanese manufacturers is being offered to attract still more.
   Government efforts are aimed at restoring investment and jobs in
areas that have suffered economically from the decline of
traditional industries such as shipbuilding and coal mining, Sharpe
said.
   The government has alloated more than 150 million pounds, or
about $231.5 million, over the next five years to transform the
industrial structure of the area and will set up a special economic
enterprise in Sunderland, where a Nissan Motor plant is located, to
attract further Japanese investment, said Gordon Ramsey, director of
business development for the Tyne and Wear Development Corporation.
   The northern region has operated a Tokyo office since 1974, and
its presence in Japan has been ``essential'' to efforts to attract
Japanese investment, Fraser told a news conference. It sponsored a
one-day seminar on business opportunities in the region attended by
representatives of more than 200 Japanese companies.
   Nissan Motor Co., Sanyo Electric Group, Komatsu and NSK Bearings
are the leading Japanese companies with plants in northern Britian.
   The Foreign Ministry recently opened an office to deal with
Japanese companies' inquiries about trade barriers and regulations
that will result from the unified market in 1992.

<TEXT>
   About 2,200 United Auto Workers walked off
their jobs at Borg Warner Corp. early today after failing to reach
agreement on a new three-year contract.
   Negotiations resumed about 8 a.m. today, said union member Dennis
McKibben, who answered the telephone at UAW Local 287, but he said
he did not know how close the two sides might be to a settlement.
   Borg Warner is the sole supplier of transmissions to Ford Motor
Co. and has several other long-term contracts, said Jack Reising,
vice president of human resources at Borg Warner.
   Those contracts could be in jeopardy if the strike continues for
very long, he said. The company, which has some inventory
stockpiled, met with salaried workers today to come up with a plan
to resume manufacturing, he said.
   Reising said the company had asked the workers to pay a greater
share of health insurance costs in exchange for partial ownership in
the company.
   Hourly and salaried employees could have established 50 percent
or more ownership of the operation, including seats on the baord of
directors, Reising said.
   Salaried workers accepted the plan but the union turned it down,
he said.
   Union officials said sticking points were insurance, pensions and
wages. Local president Sam Dragoo said the two sides had been
negotiating since July.
   The plant, which employs 2,600, produces automotive, marine and
industrial transmissions and transmissions for four-wheel drive
vehicles.

   Share prices closed sharply higher Thursday on
London's stock exchange, recovering some lost ground in modest
dealings after interest-rate fears abated.
   The FT-SE 100-share index closed at 2,415.9, up 25.1 points, or
1.04 percent. The key index had lost 35.2 points Wednesday.
   A narrower measure of the market, the FT-SE 30-share index, rose
19.8 to 1,998.5. The FT 500 share index rose 12.20 points to
1,350.25.
   Volume was modest at 508.9 million shares, down from 540.1
million Wednesday.
   Dealers said they saw the recovery largely as a reaction to the
severity of Wednesday's drop.
   Dealers said there have been growing concerns over whether
institutional players will aggressively buy anew, or just seek to
book profits before the end of the third quarter.
   ``It feels good enough at the moment,'' a British dealer said of
the FT-SE 100's return to levels above 2,400. ``It could go further.
But a lot depends on what Wall Street does overnight.''

<HEAD>Japan Orders Construction Firms To Stop Price-Fixing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELAINE KURTENBACH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government said Thursday it has ordered six
Japanese construction firms working on a multibillion-dollar airport
project in western Japan to disband a price-fixing cartel.
   In a similar move, Japan's Fair Trade Commission has ordered 24
shipbuilders to end a production cartel by October, it was reported.
   The actions seem to indicate Japan is responding to U.S.
criticisms that price-fixing cartels prevent foreign firms from
competing for business in Japan.
   James F. Rill, assistant attorney general of the U.S. Justice
Department, told Fair Trade Commission chief Setsuo Umezawa in a
meeting Wednesday that Japan should strictly enforce the
anti-monopoly law, said the Asahi Shimbun, a major national
newspaper.
   Rill participated in Japan-U.S. trade talks earlier in the week
in which American officials said business practices such as
collusion were preventing progress in shrinking the U.S. trade
deficit with Japan.
   Umezawa told Rill the Fair Trade Commission would take strong
action against violators of laws prohibiting private monopolies and
maintaining fair trade and said violators of those laws would be
treated ``with a stern attitude,'' the paper reported.
   The Kyodo News Service, quoting reliable sources, said late
Thursday that the Fair Trade Commission had ordered 24 top
shipbuilders to disband a cartel formed to help them weather a
serious slump in the industry.
   Japanese officials were not immediately available for comment
late Thursday evening.
   The Fair Trade Commission's order to disband the construction
cartel followed a year-long investigation into a price-fixing
agreement among contractors supplying sand for the Kansai
International Airport, said a commission official.
   The Kansai airport became the focus of a major dispute between
Japan and the United States three years ago when U.S. officials
claimed that corporate collusion and obscure bidding procedures were
preventing foreign companies from winning contracts.
   Construction of the $6.7 billion airport off Osaka began in
January 1987, with completion of the first phase of the nation's
first 24-hour commercial airport slated for 1993.
   Mitsuo Omura, representing the eight-company Offshore Reclamation
Construction Association, told a news conference in Osaka Wednesday
the cartel was ``necessary and an appropriate method to smoothly
carry out a big national project'' like the Kansai airport.
   But an official at major construction firm Ohbayashi Corp.,
speaking on condition of anonymity, said, ``We will discuss the
matter with other firms a way to accept the commission's order.''
   The FTC identified the members of the cartel as Ohbayashi, Kajima
Corp., Aoki Corp., Takenaka Doboku Co., Saeki Kensetsu Kogyo, and
Yorigami Construction Co.
   The mass-circulation Mainichi Shimbun said Thursday the six firms
would be fined a total of $2.2 million in surcharges, equivalent to
1.5 percent of the total value of sand supplied to the project.
   The construction association, which has two weeks to notify the
antitrust agency whether it will comply with the order, faces
exclusion from bidding on public works projects, including those of
other local governments, the newspaper said.

<HEAD>Westinghouse Seeks Simpler, Safer Nuclear Power</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EARL BOHN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Westinghouse Electric Corp. is developing a new
generation nuclear power plant by adopting aspects of the first
generation of commercial reactors _ smaller, simpler and believed to
be safer.
   ``Features like this in the '90s and the next century are really
going to be required for the public to have confidence in nuclear as
a power source,'' said Richard J. Slember, vice president and
general manager of the company's energy systems business.
   The Department of Energy late Wednesday confirmed it is awarding
a team led by Westinghouse $50 million to design a plant that could
be licensed and replicated as needed by electric utilities.
   With a projected five-year construction schedule, costs of under
$2 billion and simplified operation and maintenance, the new
600-megawatt advanced passive plant, or AP600, could overcome the
decadelong delays, skyrocketing costs and some of the controversy
involved in contemporary plants.
   Today's nuclear power plants, most of them significantly
different from the others, are rated for 1,300 to 1,400 megawatts
and cost around $10 billion.
   ``We have nothing to lose. How many people have ordered a nuclear
power plant in the last 10 years? Nobody,'' Slember said late
Wednesday.
   The AP600, a light water reactor using standard uranium fuel,
will be built in large segments in factories and assembled at the
permanent site, affording greater precision and higher quality.
   Westinghouse, the U.S. leader in nuclear power plant design,
hopes to have the AP600 ready to market in time for the next wave of
construction in the electric utility industry.
   ``Many places have gone past the point where it's unlikely they
can meet the power demands without brownouts no matter what they do
in the short run,'' Slember said, citing New York and Long Island.
``Something's got to happen.''
   Success with the AP600 could also stretch the U.S. lead in
nuclear power technology, he said.
   Energy Department spokesman Dan Butler on Thursday declined
comment on published reports that General Electric Corp. has also
been picked for a $50 million grant to develop a similar reactor.
   Westinghouse identified the members of its team as Chicago Bridge
&amp; Iron Co., Bechtel North American Power Corp., Avondale Industries
Inc., Burns &amp; Roe Co., and MK Ferguson unit of Morrison Knudson
Corp. Together with the Electric Power Research Institute, the team
would match the $50 million grant with cash and services, said
Westinghouse spokeswoman Mimi Limbach.
   The AP600 will use sealed motor pumps, ``like the pumps used in
the Navy,'' Slember said. ``They run without maintenance for years
and years. They're hermetically sealed so ... you don't have to
worry about leaks during an accident.''
   The number of valves and large pumps and the length of pipe have
all been reduced by 60 percent. There is 80 percent less control
cable, 50 percent fewer heat exchangers and 35 percent less heating,
cooling and ventilation ductwork.
   The portions of the powerplant that must be fortified to
withstand earthquakes has been cut by 60 percent.
   ``If an accident occurs, if a pipe breaks, we're not dependent on
a large number of pipes and valves operating to cool the reactor,''
Slember said.
   A large tank above the core would allow water to flow by gravity
to cool the reactor, while the steel containment vessel would
dissipate heat. Air, set in motion by temperature differences, would
flow from the outside to pick up heat from the reactor and pass out
the top of the building.
   ``Today, you have containment spray systems and fan coolers that
depend on pumps and valves and a fair amount of electric power,''
Slember said. Contemporary cooling systems require safety grade
diesel engines for backup power.
   Westinghouse began considering the advanced passive design in
1984, while designing a major Japanese reactor ``with a lot of
improved safety features,'' Slember said. ``What really made sense
was to go back to the basics and start with a clean piece of paper.''

<HEAD>British Petroleum Chairman To Retire</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sir Peter Walters, chairman of British Petroleum
PLC, plans to retire March 10 and will be succeeded by the former
head of BP America Inc., the company announced Thursday.
   British Petroleum, the world's third-largest oil concern in sales
after Exxon Corp. and Royal Dutch Shell Group, said Robert Horton
will replace Walters as chairman. Horton, 50, former chief executive
of British Petroleum's U.S. subsidiary based in Cleveland, Ohio, was
appointed deputy chairman on March 1.
   Walters, 58, has been managing director of the company for 17
years and chairman since 1981. He was knighted in 1984.
   He had been poised to step down this year and take over as
chairman of National Westminster Bank, but could not come to terms
with the bank. He resigned from BP's board in August.
   Earlier this year, Walters drew criticism within the company for
accepting a 48 percent increase in his compensation to 514,558
pounds, or about $800,000 at current exchange rates.
   When he became chairman in 1981, Walters said he hoped to
restructure the company within 10 years and then retire.
   His first moves were to sharply reduce BP's refining capacity in
Europe, turning a $1 billion-a-year loss to a $1 billion profit
within four years.
   Since the start of the decade, BP's European refining capacity
has been cut by 57 percent.
   Horton was in charge of cutting losses in BP Chemicals
International group.
   During Walters' term, BP acquired the outstanding 45 percent
minority interest of Standard Oil for $7.8 billion in 1987 and
undertook the 2.5-billion-pound-takeover, about $4 billion, of
Britoil last year.
   The full takeover of Standard Oil has allowed BP to integrate its
U.S. operations under BP America, and to call off a disastrous
exploration program that cost Standard billions of dollars. Half of
BP's assets are now in the United States.
   The acquisition of Britoil gave BP a major stake in the North Sea
as a hedge against declining production. Although the company has
said it can maintain production of 1.7 million barrels a day until
the mid-1990s, its two main oil fields, Forties in the North Sea and
Prudhoe Bay in Alaska, have both peaked.
   Walters, a native of Birmingham in central England, joined BP in
1954 and was involved mainly with the company's international oil
supply organization, including assignments to the New York office in
1960-62 and, as vice-president of BP North America Inc., in 1965-67.
   In 1971 he was appointed BP's regional director for the Western
Hemisphere, Australasia and Far East. He was named deputy chairman
in 1980.
   The company did not announce Walters' plans following retirement.
   Horton joined BP in 1957, and was appointed general manager of
the BP Tanker Co. in 1975. The next year, he was appointed general
manager of BP Group's Corporate Planning Department.
   In 1980 he became chief executive officer of BP Chemicals
International. He was elected to the board in December 1983 as a
managing director with responsibility for finance, planning and the
Western Hemisphere.
   He resigned from British Petroleum in 1986 to become chairman and
chief executive officer of Standard Oil. Following the merger of BP
and Standard in 1987, he was appointed chief executive officer of BP
America.
   In February, British Petroleum reported that after-tax profit in
1988 fell 13 percent to 1.21 billion pounds on an historical cost
basis from 1.39 billion pounds in 1987.
   Current cost after-tax profit rose 10 percent to 1.44 billion
pounds, or about $2.55 billion, from 1.31 billion pounds. Per-share

<HEAD>Toy Companies Bet Big on Super Fast Cars</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN COOPERMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As American kids grow bored with video games and
stop buying them, toy companies are hoping to pick up the slack by
importing the latest craze from Japan: 6-inch model cars that move
at the equivalent, when scaled up to full size, of 320 miles per
hour.
   But executives who gathered in Boston for a toy industry
conference Thursday expressed one nagging doubt about their new
``hyper cars.'' The darn things move so fast, how can kids possibly
play with them?
   ``It's a real problem,'' conceded Kenneth A. Bloom, vice
president for finance at Matchbox International Ltd. ``You put it
down on the rug and let it go, and it's just going to shoot off and
keep going until it hits something or flips over.''
   The $5 to $12 cars, powered by two or three AA batteries, move at
actual speeds of about 10 miles per hour. But in comparison with
their scale, which is 1-32 of a full-sized car, they easily outrun
Formula I racers.
   Matchbox and its major competitors _ Hasbro Inc., Mattel Inc. and
Tonka Corp. _ plan to spend a total of $20 million to $25 million by
Christmas to promote the flashy vehicles, most of which are just now
hitting retail stores.
   It's an unusually late product introduction for the industry, and
a marketing gamble driven by equal parts of excitement and worry.
   At the International Toy Fair in New York in January, when new
products traditionally are unveiled, Mattel and Tonka displayed
their super-fast cars but were virtually ignored by retailers.
   Since then, however, two things have happened.
   One is that the cars have taken off in Japan, selling an
estimated 45 million units and whetting the appetites of American
toy store chains.
   The other is that the $2 billion-a-year market for video games
may have peaked, and no ``hot'' new toys have emerged since Cabbage
Patch Dolls and the board game Trivial Pursuit racked up hundreds of
millions of dollars in sales in the mid-1980s.
   Stephen O. Shank, Tonka Corp.'s chief executive officer, told the
Boston toy conference that he expects ``an orderly decline'' in
video game sales starting next year, and Tonka has decided to drop
its Sega video line in 1990.
   The last time there was a downturn in video games, in 1980-81,
several toy companies' profits plunged and ``it got pretty bloody
out there,'' said Steve Eisenberg, a toy industry analyst for the
investment firm of Bear, Stearns &amp; Co., the conference's sponsor.
   To avoid such a debacle again, toymakers have been casting about
for something with enough sparkle to pull parents and children back
into the toy stores.
   ``The industry has lacked a hot product for two years, and
everyone thinks this (hyper car) thing could be it,'' said Bruno
Ferretti, president of Tons Of Toys, a chain of 25 stores in the
Northeast.
   The cars come in numerous designs, inclding some with
interchangeable motors and gear boxes. Although they are being
marketed under various names, such as Hyper-Drivers and Record
Breakers, most versions are made in Japan and are nearly identical
in construction.
   Toymakers hope to solve the problem of how to play with the
speeding vehicles by selling plastic track that kids can put
together in their bedrooms, garages or backyards. In Japan, arcades
have installed elaborate tracks that junior racers pay to use. But
some toy executives are doubtful the same thing will happen in
America.
   Tyco Toys Inc., the leading maker of slot cars and
radio-controlled vehicles, has decided to sit out the craze.
   ``We don't think it's a good product, we don't think it has good
play value, and we don't think it's going to be successful,'' Tyco
President Richard E. Grey told the industry conference. ``We're
prepared to be wrong. But we're also willing to stand up and be
counted.''

<HEAD>No More Bananas: RJR Sells Del Monte's Fresh Fruit Business</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VIVIAN MARINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   RJR Nabisco Inc. said Thursday it would sell the
fresh fruit operations of Del Monte to the British conglomerate
Polly Peck International PLC for $875 million in another major step
toward reducing debt from its record buyout.
   The cash sale of Del Monte Tropical Fruit Co. moves RJR past the
halfway mark in its efforts to sell about $5.5 billion in assets to
reduce the debt accumulated in the $25 billion buyout of the food
and tobacco giant by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co.
   Del Monte is the world's largest supplier of fresh pineapples and
No. 3 in bananas. Its acquisition would make Polly Peck a major
player in the fresh fruit industry by allowing it to use the
well-known Del Monte brand name on its entire range of produce.
   RJR's plan to divest assets, particularly among its food
holdings, began in June, when it sold five European food businesses
for $2.5 billion to BSN SA of France, and its Chun King unit for $52
million to a Singapore syndicate. The following month it sold its
biscuit and food businesses in India and Pakistan for $44 million.
   ``We are significantly ahead of schedule in completing that
plan,'' said RJR Chairman Louis V. Gerstner.
   RJR said the amount received for the fresh fruit business was
about 13 times the unit's projected 1989 operating income, a price
tag generally in line with analysts' expectations.
   ``I'd say it's a good price. Of course, it's not as good as what
they extracted from the (European) snack food operations,'' said
Marc I. Cohen, of the New York securities firm Sanford C. Bernstein.
   John Maxwell, an analyst with Wheat First Securities in Richmond,
Va., said he expected RJR to proceed with plans to sell the rest of
Del Monte as well, including Del Monte Foods USA and separate units
in Europe, Latin America, Canada and the Far East.
   He predicted the remainder of the division would fetch between
$1.5 billion and $2 billion.
   Del Monte Tropical Fruit, with $600 million in sales of
pineapples, bananas, papayas, mangoes and other fresh fruits last
year, accounted for about a quarter of Del Monte's total sales.
   RJR had total revenue of $7.44 billion for the first six months
of 1989.
   Gerstner acknowledged RJR already has received inquiries about
acquiring other Del Monte businesses, ``but there has been no final
decision yet.''
   Polly Peck said the Del Monte acquisiton is expected to boost its
sales by 50 percent.
   ``The acquisition of Del Monte represents a remarkable
opportunity for (Polly Peck) to establish itself as one of the
world's largest suppliers of fresh fruit and vegetables,'' said
Polly Peck Chairman Asil Nadir.
   ``The two businesses are truly complementary: PPI is strong in
citrus fruits and in many European markets, whereas Del Monte Fresh
Fruit is strong in bananas and pineapples and in the American and
Far Eastern markets.''
   Polly Peck said it planned to finance the acquisition through a
rights issue and from bank loans. It said it hopes to complete the
deal by Oct. 26.
   The rights issue will allow existing shareholders to buy new
Polly Peck shares at 245 pence, or $3.77, about 20 percent below
their recent trading range.
   The London-based company also has operations in electronics,
textiles and hotels. Its sales totaled $804 million for the first
six months of this year.

   The stock market edged upward today, bidding to
rebound from Wednesday's broad decline.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which fell 24.89 points
on Wednesday, rose 2.28 to 2,722.07 by 3 p.m. today on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 7 to 6 in the overall tally
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 753 up, 645 down and
575 unchanged.
   Analysts said traders had been encouraged to see the market
stabilize in late trading Wednesday after an early selloff.
   They also noted a positive response to a strong showing by the
dollar in foreign exchange today.
   In the last few days a debate has heated up on Wall Street over
whether stocks are due for a pullback after their sharp runup to
record highs this summer.
   The optimists argue, however, that the market's rise has not yet
produced the excesses of speculation and exuberance that typically
occur when prices are peaking out.
   Allergan led the active list, down 3| at 20~. The company said
its sales this year wouldn't grow as much as it previously projected.
   Airline stocks were weak for the second straight session as
traders continued to cash in the issues' dramatic gains of late. AMR
fell 2] to 84|; UAL 4~ to 282, and Delta Air Lines 3] to 76[.
   Applied Biosystems tumbled 4 to 24{ in the over-the-counter
market. The company said its earnings for the quarter ending Sept.
30 would fall hort of their level in the comparable period a year
ago.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.23 to 194.41. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up .63 at 383.50.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 130.51 million shares with an

<HEAD>Soybean Futures Rise On Increased Exports, Crop Estimate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices posted strong gains
Thursday on the Chicago Board of Trade, boosted by perceptions of
increased foreign demand for U.S. soy products and by a private crop
analysts' bullish harvest forecast.
   Grain futures closed mixed.
   The export news came from three directions, beginning with the
Agriculture Department's announcement late Wednesday that 200,000
metric tons of U.S. soybeans had been sold to unknown destinations.
Traders speculated the beans were bound for China, Russia or Japan.
   Rumors that the USDA would grant Pakistan $80 million in credit
to purchase U.S. soybean oil prompted further buying in the soybean
complex, as did talk that a vegetable oil sale to the Soviet Union
was in the works.
   The soybean market also was supported by new crop estimates by
Sparks Commodities Inc., a Memphis, Tenn.-based analytical firm,
that were lower than the Agriculture Department's August projections.
   Sparks pegged the 1989 U.S. soybean crop at 1.85 billion bushels
compared with the USDA's 1.91 billion-bushel estimate.
   Sparks projected the corn harvest at 7.13 billion bushels
compared with the USDA's August estimate of 7.35 billion.
   The USDA will revise its crop estimates on Tuesday.
   If Sparks' estimates prove correct, soybean prices may be headed
for an extended stay above $6 a bushel, said Pat O'Connell, a grain
market analyst with Refco Inc. in Chicago.
   At the close, wheat futures were 1\ cents lower to 1} cents
higher with September at $3.97 a bushel; corn was 1 cent lower to 1\
cents higher with September at $2.36} a bushel; oats were } cent to
2 cents higher with September at $1.36\ a bushel; soybeans were 3{
cents to 9} cents higher with September at $5.97 a bushel.

<TEXT>
   U.S. Agriculture Secretary Clayton
Yeutter met on Thursday with European Community officials but
appeared to make little headway in solving some tough problems
separating the giant trading partners.
   Both sides reported the talks were constructive, but neither
indicated any moves to settle their disputes over European
agricultural subsidies and a European ban on imports of
hormone-treated beef from the United States.
   Even so, Yeutter told reporters he was ``mildly encouraged'' that
the current round of international trade negotiations could be
wrapped up on schedule, by the end of 1990. Those talks, called the
Uruguay Round, are being held under the auspices of the 96-nation
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
   Earlier, Ray MacSharry, the top agricultural official for the
European Community, raised the possibility that the two sides'
dispute over the trading bloc's ban on beef from cattle treated with
growth hormones might be easing.
   The United States has refused to comply with the prohibition,
arguing the hormones used by its farmers are safe. It has retaliated
with stiff duties on some European imports.
   MacSharry said more than 200 feedlots in the United States and
about 10 slaughterhouses have been approved to ship hormone-free
beef to the 12 nations of the community. A major packing company
also has shown in interest in gaining approval for its products, he
said.
   The recent shipments of hormone-free beef would amount to about
$9 million if stretched out over 12 months, according to community
estimates.
   As a result, MacSharry said he expected an easing of the U.S.
sanctions shortly.
   Yeutter, however, described the recent shipments of high-quality
beef as nominal and said they did not include the lower grades which
make up about 80 percent or 85 percent of the disputed meat sent to
the community.
   ``We've still only solved about 15 percent of the problem,'' he
said.
   Yeutter also said governments should wait for the results of
scientific studies on another hormone, bovine somatatropin or BST,
before deciding whether to ban its use. BST boosts the milk yield of
a cow.
   MacSharry has proposed that the community hold off making a
decision on the hormone until the end of 1990.
   The United States, the European Community and other nations are
tackling agricultural policies as part of the Uruguay Round talks.
   A sticking point has been an American demand for the community to
get rid of import barriers and export and domestic farm subsidies
that it says distort trade.
   To do that, the United States has suggested to GATT that steps be
taken to convert subsidies or other trade barriers into tariffs so
that these duties could then be negotiated to lower levels. The idea
is to quantify the restrictions in order to reduce them.
   MacSharry said that plan was ``of major concern to us.''
   If such action were taken to reduce support for European farmers,
he said, the community would have to look at ways of slapping
tariffs on ``an enormous amount'' of products that now enter the
trading bloc duty free.
   Yeutter, in turn, said the United States was ``vigorously
opposed'' to those tariff adjustments, known as ``rebalancing.''
   ``What is proposed by the community constitutes increased
protectionism rather than icreased trade liberalization,'' he said.
   Yeutter was scheduled to travel to Switzerland and Germany before
returning to the United States.

   Government farm programs must encourage
alternative methods of food production that save the soil and use
fewer chemical fertilizers, weedkillers and pesticides, a National
Research Council report said Thursday.
   Federal farm policies ``have generally made a plentiful food
supply a higher priority than protection'' of the nation's soil and
water resources, the report said.
   Instead of supporting ``environmentally benign'' ways of
producing food, the report said, government programs have worked
against those alternative methods.
   Linda Worthington, a coordinator for Americans for a Safe Food, a
subsidiary of the private, non-profit Center for Science in the
Public Interest, said she agreed with the report's charge that
government farm policies have been an impediment.
   ``Some of the basic agricultural policies that have been in
motion almost since World War II have pushed the American farmer
into a high-chemical (method of) farming and makes it difficult, if
not impossible, for the farmer to move into more sustainable
practices,'' she said.
   Worthington's group earlier this year released a study showing
that efforts to promote organic and low-chemical farming ``is
flourishing at the state level,'' while the federal effort is moving
slowly.
   The latest report, ``Alternative Agriculture,'' came after a
three-year $625,000 study by a 17-member committee headed by John
Pesek of Iowa State University. The council is an agency of the
National Academies of Sciences and Engineering.
   As used in the 450-page report, alternative agriculture is not a
single system of farm production with a siple list of do's and
don'ts. It is a generic term that includes a wide range of
methodology and labels _ organic, biological, low-input,
regenerative, sustainable.
   The USDA uses its own acronym _ LISA, for low-input, sustainable
agriculture _ in a bid to help farmers find lower-cost ways of
producing crops and livestock while helping protect the environment.
   Assistant Secretary Charles E. Hess said at USDA that Congress
has already authorized a number of program changes to give more
choices to farmers and that flexibility will be an important part of
drafting a 1990 farm bill to replace the 1985 law.
   Hess told reporters that the Agriculture Department also has
expanded its work in IPM, or integrated pest management, which uses
a variety of methods to control crop pests instead of the old
practice of dousing fields with pesticides.
   The report recommended that the department boost its spending on
LISA to at least $40 million a year from the current level of $4.45
million. Hess said the total USDA research budget is about $1.2
billion this year and that a substantial upgrading of that is under
review.
   Hess acknowledged that there has been ``a major step forward in
the last five years'' in the recognition of alternative farm
methods. This has been a ``shared repsonsibility'' of USDA, the
land-grant universities and Congress, he said.
   Only a few of the nation's 2.17 million farms have adopted entire
alternative systems of production. But the report said the need is
there and that bits and pieces have been successfully used.
   Hess said there is ``no magic formula, and the practices will
vary from farm to farm.''
   Crop rotations, in which soil-building crops are grown after the
production of corn or other grain for several years, are examples of
alternative methods. The conventional method might call for the same
crop year after year, with farmers heaping on costly chemicals to
boost production.
   ``Many federal policies discourage adoption of alternative
practices and systems by economically penalizing those who adopt
rotations, apply certain soil conservation systems, or attempt to
reduce pesticide applications,'' the report said.
   ``Federal programs often tolerate and sometimes encourage
unrealistically high yield goals, inefficient fertilizer and
pesticide use, and unsustainable use of land and water,'' it said.
``Many farmers in these programs manage their farms to maximize
present and future program benefits, sometimes at the expense of
environmental quality.''
   A primary goal of commodity program reform should be ``the
removal of the existing disincentives'' that discourage alternative
methods of production.
   ``This step would ensure that farmers who employ crop rotations
and recommended resource conservation practices are not deprived of
farm-income support,'' the report said.
   Thus, it added, Congress would have to revise existing programs
to eliminate penalties for farmers adopting crop rotations, and to
allow more flexibility in substituting or adjusting acreage
allotments to accommodate rotations.
   The American Farmland Trust, a non-profit conservation group
based in Washington, said the report ``documents the compatibility
of economic concerns and conservation measures'' on the nation's
farms.
   ``Today many farmers successfully implement safe, sustainable
agricultural practices,'' said Ralph Grossi, AFT president.
``However, there is no widespread coordination of these efforts.''
   The study was financed mainly by a $410,000 grant from the W.K.
Kellogg Foundation. Other private contributors put up the balance,
and the USDA provided $80,000.

<HEAD>Mitchell Says He'll Fight Capital-Gains Tax Cut</HEAD>

   Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell said
Thursday he will vigorously oppose a capital-gains tax cut, which he
called a giveaway to the rich that would have to be financed by
middle-income taxpayers.
   Mitchell said he favors preferential tax treatment for capital
gains, but only as part of a fair, progressive tax structure that
would include raising the maximum tax rate paid by wealthier
Americans on all types of income.
   ``The present proposal is unfair, unwise and will increase the
deficit,'' Mitchell, D-Maine, told reporters. ``It will require
middle-class taxpayers to make up that tax break for the wealthy.''
   Mitchell cited estimates that on average, a capital-gains
reduction would be worth $31,000 a year to a person with income over
$200,000.
   The House Ways and Means Committee is expected to approve a
capital-gains cut next week.
   Until passage of the 1986 tax overhaul, capital gains _ which are
profits from the sale of stock and other investments _ were taxed at
a lower rate than other income. But the capital-gains preference _
as well as such breaks as deductions for sales taxes and universal
Individual Retirement Accounts _ was taken away so that tax rates on
all kinds of income could be cut significantly.
   President Bush promised during the campaign last year to restore
the preference for capital gains, arguing such action would spur
investment and saving. He has asked Congress to cut the maximum
capital-gains rate, now 33 percent, to 15 percent.
   A compromise reduction, which has the president's support, was
proposed by Rep. Ed Jenkins, D-Ga. It would cut the top rate for 2{
years to 20 percent, then raise it permanently to 28 percent and
ensure that profits caused solely by inflation would not be taxed.
   Jenkins' plan has the backing of a bare majority of the House
Ways and Means Committee, but the panel's Democratic leadership has
delayed a vote in an effort to win support for a third plan.
   Offered by Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., the new proposal would
``index'' the value of investments so that inflation-caused gain
would not be taxed. But it would go a big step further for assets
held for five or more years, exempting from taxation as much as half
the price for which such an investment is sold.
   Mitchell said that because of the budget deficit, this is not the
time to consider any cut in capital-gains taxes. Asked if he is
``prepared to go to the mat'' in opposition to a cut, he stomped his
foot and replied ``yes.''
   He said that if a preference is voted for capital gains, that
would increase pressure to restore other breaks that were taken away
in the 1986 overhaul.
   Coincidentally, Sens. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., and Christopher
Dodd, D-Conn., introduced a bill Thursday that would restore
slightly modified but fully deductible IRAs for all workers. A
worker, regardless of income, could avoid tax on up to $2,000 per
year contributed to an IRA; one with an unemployed spouse could
contribute another $1,000.
   The worker would be allowed a tax credit for 15 percent of the
IRA contribution. Thus, one who made the maximum $2,000 contribution
could save $300 in taxes.
   The 1986 law retained fully deductible IRAs only for those not
covered by a company pension regardless of income, and couples
earning less than $35,000 and single workers earning less than
$25,000.

   The head of Fluorocarbon Co., who felt like a
corporate Al Capone because people wrongly thought his products
zapped the ozone layer, said Thursday he's received more than 9,000
entries in his contest to rename the company.
   The safe-sounding suggestions, from Fluoroseals to Notox to
Pro-Ozone Inc. to Oat Bran Co., came in letters from points as
farflung as Stuttgart, West Germany, to a couple of U.S. jails, said
Peter Churm, chairman of the Laguna Niguel-based company.
   ``One of the jailbirds was in San Diego and one was in the
Cleveland pokey,'' Churm said. ``The guy from the San Diego County
Jail apologized that he couldn't have it typed.''
   Churm decided to rename Fluorocarbon this year after brokers
balked at pitching the stock to investors.
   The problem: A lot of people confused Fluorocarbon with
chlorofluorocarbons, the compounds that are believed to erode the
ozone layer that screens cancer-causing ultraviolet rays.
   In fact, the smallish company ($250 million in 1988 sales) makes
custom seals, gaskets, bearings and the like from Teflon and related
plastics known as fluorocarbons. Whirlpool Corp., Boeing Co. and
Navistar International are among Churm's customers, and Fluorocarbon
seals are even used in the space shuttle.
   The deadline for postmarked entries was Aug. 31, so Churm figured
nearly all of them had arrived by Thursday.
   ``As of this morning, we've had 3,647 letters with somewhere
between 9,000 and 10,000 suggestions altogether,'' he said.
   Some suggestions were silly: Not Chlorofluorocarbon Inc.,
Fiber-Fab, Seals R Us, Fluoraluralura.
   ``And any with American, Laguna, or my name will be instantly
eliminated,'' Churm said.
   There went The Churminators Inc. and Laguna Buna.
   A committee headed by Churm will winnow the entries to 10 in the
next couple of weeks. Then the lawyers will get busy starting with
the first name until they find one that isn't yet taken by another
company. The winner should be announced by late October.
   The prize is 100 shares of Fluorocarbon stock, which has been
trading at about $16 per share.
   ``We'll do something special for the winner,'' Churm said.
   The flood of entries became so huge this summer after the Great
Name Change was announced that Fluorocarbon assigned two workers to
the contest, one hired temporarily to feed names into a computer.
   Most employees will be glad when it's over.
   ``It's been a bit overwhelming,'' Churm said. ``We're set up to
be a manufacturing company, not some PR firm.''

   White House economic adviser Michael J. Boskin
on Thursday reinforced the Bush administration's call on the Federal
Reserve Board to lower interest rates.
   ``My own personal view is if there are signs of softness in the
economy from where we are now, that further easing would probably be
appropriate,'' said Boskin, chairman of the Council of Economic
Advisers.
   ``We see the economy is continuing to grow, albeit at a slower
rate than the fairly rapid pace of 1987 and 1988,'' he said.
   His remarks at a U.S. Chamber of Commerce breakfast came three
weeks after White House budget director Richard Darman complained
that the central bank was keeping interest rates too high and would
have to bear the blame if the country toppled into a recession after
nearly seven years of economic expansion.
   President Bush later endorsed Darman's statement, calling it
``very balanced.''
   Boskin has generally avoided publicly criticizing the Federal
Reserve, which is considered an independent branch of government,
and his statement was muted compared to Darman's remarks.
   ``Picking fights between the administration and the Fed is the
best game in town and I don't really intend to get involved. I think
that's counterproductive,'' Boskin said.
   ``I'm sure the Fed is monitoring the data as closely as we are
and I'm certain they will adopt a sensible monetary policy because
they themselves have said that their goal is to try to achieve the
maximum sustainable economic growth consistent with controlling
inflation,'' he said.
   Beginning in March 1988, the central bnk boosted short-term
interest rates by 3 percentage points. Its goal was a so-called
``soft landing'' _ slower but continued economic growth that would
prevent an acceleration of inflation.
   Then, when signs of sluggishness began to emerge, the Fed in June
began loosening credit, allowing rates to fall by about
three-quarters of a percentage point.
   However, recent statistics indicate the economy, although slower
than last year, was doing better than most economists thought. The
Fed has not nudged interest rates down further since mid-July,
causing some impatience within the administration, which is
depending on continued growth to generate tax revenue and help it
reduce the budget deficit without a tax increase.
   ``We would not be satisfied with a definition of soft landing
that merely avoids a recession,'' Boskin said. ``The economy can and
should do better than that. It should sustain growth sufficient to
provide rising employment and real income to Americans.''

<TEXT>
   A bankruptcy judge on Thursday pulled
former Ohio financier Marvin Warner's case out of liquidation and
restored it to Chapter 11 reorganization so creditors can decide on
a proposed $16 million settlement.
   The creditors are expected to vote on the plan within the next
few weeks, and U.S. ankrutpcy Judge George Proctor scheduled a Sept.
27 hearing in Orlando to confirm the tally.
   The judge approved a motion to return Warner's case to Chapter 11
protection from the liquidation he'd ordered on July 31, saying,
``The court does not plan to throw a monkey wrench'' in the proposed
settlement filed earlier this week in court.
   Under the plan, Warner would immediately pay $10 million and make
three annual $2 million payments beginning with the first
anniversary of the plan's approval. Warner also will pay all legal
fees and administrative costs, and an estimated $2 million in taxes
associated with liquidation of assets to pay the settlement.
   Warner, 70, has been the target of a flood of lawsuits following
the collapse of his Cincinnati-based Home State Savings Bank in
March 1985. He filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in October
1987 against creditors seeking more than $4.5 billion.
   Warner was convicted on Ohio felony charges in Home State's
collapse but was acquitted of federal charges in a separate trial.
He is appealing the state conviction and a restitution order.
   Home State collapsed four days after Fort Lauderdale-based ESM
Government Securities Inc. was shut down by federal regulators for
insolvency. Home State had invested heavily with ESM through
securities trades and lost $144 million when ESM was closed.
   The creditors, most of whom have already agreed to the
settlement, will formally vote on the plan before attending the
hearing in Orlando.
   At that hearing, the judge will determine whether it was approved
by all classes of creditors and whether it meets the requirements of
the bankruptcy law. If that is the case, he will sign an order
confirming the plan and it will go into effect.

   The stock market lost ground for the third
straight session today, yielding to a late round of selling.
   In the last few days a debate has heated up on Wall Street over
whether stocks are due for a pullback after their sharp runup to
record highs this summer.
   The optimists argue that the market's rise has not yet produced
the excesses of speculation and exuberance that typically occur when
prices are peaking out.
   But talk persists of an impending ``correction'' as traders seek
to cash in profits built up over the first eight months of the year.
   Brokers say stocks have also been weighed down by doubts that the
Federal Reserve will take any further steps in the near future to
relax its credit policy.

   Assets of the nation's 463 money market mutual
funds rose by $1.26 billion in the latest week to a new record of
$344.65 billion, the Investment Company Institute said Thursday.
   It was the 10th straight weekly all-time high and reflected the
growing popularity of such investments despite a recent trend toward
lower interest rates.
   The rise in the seven-day period ended Wednesday followed a $53.7
million rise in fund assets the previous week, the Washington-based
mutual fund trade group said.
   In the latest week, assets of 227 general purpose funds rose
$770.1 million to $110.68 billion, assets of 95 broker-dealer funds
increased $1.04 billion to $149.21 billion, and assets of 141
institutional funds declined $557.1 million to $84.77 billion, the
institute said.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds fell in
the week ended Tuesday to 8.24 percent from 8.29 percent the
previous week, according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade
journal based in Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield fell to 8.30 percent from 8.32 percent,
Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was 37
days, down from 38 days, Donoghue's said.
   The newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of 100 leading
commercial banks, savings and loan associations and savings banks in
the nation's 10 largest markets showed the effective annual yield
available on money market accounts fell to 6.45 percent as of
Wednesday from 6.46 percent a week earlier.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super NOW
accounts, was unchanged at 5.11 percent.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 8.26
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, down from 8.28 the
previous week. Yields were 8.31 percent on 1-year CDs, up from 8.30
percent; 8.23 percent on 2{-year CDs, up from 8.21 percent; and 8.21
percent on 5-year CDs, up from 8.20 percent.

   Defense lawyers portray a former New York
Federal Reserve Bank director who admitted leaking secret data as a
generous ``country banker'' seduced into the crime by a friend.
   A memorandum submitted Wednesday to the judge preparing to
sentence Robert A. Rough described the ex-banker as a man shattered
by betraying his trust.
   His attorneys asked for probation and a sentence of 200 hours of
community service at Newton Memorial Hospital, where the 50-year-old
man would be willing to perform the ``most demeaning manual tasks.''
   U.S. District Judge Dickinson R. Debevoise could impose up to
five years in prison at sentencing Sept. 13. The government has
recommended no more than one year.
   Rough, while president of the National Bank of Sussex County, sat
on the board of the New York Federal Reserve Bank from 1982 to 1984.
   In a plea agreement with the government last June, he admitted
regularly disclosing advance word on New York Fed recommendations to
the Federal Reserve Bank in Washington regarding the discount rate.
Several times he revealed actual Fed decisions on the rate.
   Federal authorities called the case the first to involve insider
trading of government securities, and the first such charges against
a director in the Fed system.
   The discount rate, which is the interest the Fed charges on loans
to member banks, can have a powerful effect on the securities market.
   Rough gave the information to principals of the now-defunct
brokerage firm Bevill, Bresler &amp; Schulman Inc., and the government
claims they used it to reap millions in profits and avoid losses.
Five top executives, including company president Gilbert C.
Schulman, who was Rough's neighbor and friend, were implicated in
the firm's 1985 collapse and sent to prison.
   Schulman was described in the defense attorneys' memo as a
``nefarious individual well-known to this court ... the consummate
flim-flam artist.''
   The memo said Schulman saw Rough's position on the New York Fed's
board as a chance to profit.
   ``Accordingly, Schulman constantly prodded, poked, cajoled and
pleaded with Rough'' to reveal discount-rate data, the memo said.
   In his own statement to Debevoise, Rough blamed his actions on
``misguided notions of friendship;'' the ``rationalization'' that
the discount rate was a market follower; and the fact that 11 other
regional banks made recommendations.
   But Assistant U.S. Attorney Paul Weissman, who handled the case,
argued, ``Nobody twisted his arm. It was Rough's decision to reveal
the information.''
   Weissman, in his memo, had called Rough's actions ``serious
criminal behavior'' by someone who ``grossly abused'' his position.
   The government charged that Rough was given $47,000 in
interest-deferred loans in exchange for the information, but added
in its memo that Rough probably didn't see the loans as a payback,
only as unrelated personal loans from Schulman.
   Along with Rough's apologies to Fed officials and admission that
he abused his trust, Rough's memo detaile how he ``has seen his
entire world crumble before his eyes.''
   From successful ``country banker'' _ the third generation of his
family in banking _ who counseled the community, chairman of the New
Jersey Bankers Association and local Fed director, Rough has lost
his profession and is ``virtually penniless,'' said the memo. A
supportor's letter cited $250,000 in legal fees.
   His wife has filed for divorce and his two sons, age 18 and 20,
are unemployed and frequently in trouble with the law, it said.
   ``My career is finished in disgrace; I have tainted the Fed which
I so revered; I have brought shame to my family; and finally my life
is in personal and financial ruins,'' he wrote.

   Senate tax-writers, yielding to loud complaints
from many older Americans, indicated Thursday they would join their
House counterparts and go along with major changes in Medicare
insurance covering the costs of a catastrophic illness.
   Several members of the Senate Finance Committee, however,
rejected a revision approved by the House Ways and Means Committee
to cut costs for the higher-income elderly but raise them for older
people with lower incomes.
   ``I want to make it clear at the outset that, as chairman, I will
oppose any increase in the flat premium paid by retirees of modest
means,'' said Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, who heads the Finance
Committee.
   ``We should neither repeal ... (catastrophic coverage) nor shift
a greater share of costs ... to beneficiaries who can least afford
them,'' said Sen. Spark Matsunaga, D-Hawaii.
   Meanwhile, Republican congressional leaders met with President
Bush at the White House. Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., told reporters
afterward that several of the lawmakers told Bush the catastrophic
care act ``ought to be repealed in toto.''
   The program, enacted barely a year ago, is under heavy fire from
some older Americans who say they don't need the protection and from
others _ mainly those with higher incomes _ who object that the
coverage is financed only by the elderly and not by all taxpayers.
   About two-thirds of the cost of the catastrophic care insurance
program is paid by the 41 percent of older citizens whose incomes
are high enough that they owe federal income tax of more than $150.
They pay a surtax of 15 percent on income tax above $150; about 1.8
million of the 33 million Medicare beneficiaries will pay the
maximum surtax of $800 this year.
   The surtax rate is due to increase to 28 percent and the maximum
surtax to $1,050 by 1993.
   The rest of the cost is financed through a flat fee of $4 per
month per retiree. That fee is due to rise to $10.20 by 1993.
   Complaints from the elderly prompted the Ways and Means Committee
to reduce some catastrophic care benefits, cut the surtax rate by
half and raise the flat monthly fee significantly. Those changes
have not been enough to mollify the protesters, as Rep. Dan
Rostenkowski, D-Ill., the Ways and Means chairman, learned; he was
chased down a street in his hometown of Chicago by angry retirees
last month.
   ``You almost have a sense when you go home of being unwanted,
unloved and unappreciated on this issue,'' Sen. Robert Packwood,
R-Ore., told colleagues Thursday.
   The Finance Committee is likely to begin voting on how to change
the program Friday.
   The Bush administration said it would prefer no change at all,
but William Diefenderfer, deputy director of the Office of
Management and Budget, conceded ``that doesn't seem to be what's
going to happen.''
   Diefenderfer noted that repeal of catastrophic care coverage
would worsen the federal deficit in 1990 by as much as $7 billion
because taxes earmarked for the program come in faster than benefits
are paid out. Killing the program would automatically trigger
across-the-board cuts in most federal spending.
   There is considerable support in the House for outright repeal of
catastrophic care insurance, an idea that drew the support of Sen.
John C. Danforth, R-Mo.
   ``I question the kind of commitment we made last year,'' he said,
noting the program leans toward long-term hospital care.
   ``This isn't something they (older Americans) want,'' Danforth
said. ``It's something they fear..., being hooked up'' to
life-support equipment and the like.
   The Finance Committee staff outlined seven options for changing
catastrophic care coverage, most of which would require retirees to
pay a larger share of expenses but also allow them to reject the
insurance _ but only if they also drop Medicare Part B, which covers
physicians' fees.
   The panel has two basic proposals for changing the way the
program is financed:
   _Freeze the surtax rate at 10 or 15 percent and reduce the
maximum annual surtax to $585. This would require retirees to
continue paying most of the costs of coverage.
   _Require non-retirees to pay a share of the cost of catastrophic
insurance by raising to $60,000 the $48,000 maximum amount of wages
subject to the 1.45 percent Medicare hospitalization tax. The tax,
paid as part of the Social Security tax through payroll deductions,
is matched by the employer.

   Stock prices showed some spotty declines Thursday
after a modest early rally attempt failed to attract much support.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up about eight points in
the early going, was down 12.91 at 2,706.88 by the close.
   That extended its loss over the last three sessions to 45.21

   Advancing issues and declines ran about even in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 713 up, 714
down and 569 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 160.16 million
shares, against 161.80 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those
stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market,
totaled 194.08 million shares.
   In the last few days a debate has heated up on Wall Street over
whether stocks are due for a pullback after their sharp runup to

   The optimists argue that the market's rise has not yet produced

wouldn't grow as much as it previously projected.
   Tiffany jumped 6[ to 60]. Financier Donald Trump received

   Investor Donald Trump has received government
clearance to purchase more than $15 million of the jewelry firm
Tiffany &amp; Co.'s stock, a Trump spokeswoman said Thursday.
   ``Mr. Trump thinks that Tiffany is a very exciting company that
represents a good investment opportunity,'' said Susan Heilbron,
spokeswoman for the Trump Organization.
   She declined to disclose whether Trump already owns any Tiffany
shares or how large a stake he contemplates acquiring.
   Tiffany issued a brief news release in which Chairman William R.
Chaney said Trump had advised him that a filing was made to the
government so that Trump might acquire and hold more than $15
million of Tiffany's stock ``as an investment and not as part of a
takeover effort.''
   Tiffany's stock recently has gone up amid takeover speculation
and talk on Wall Street that the stock was being accumulated.
Responding to the rumors, Tiffany released a statement on Aug. 25
saying it hadn't received any takeover offers and wasn't seeking any.
   Trump, whose holdings include hotels, casinos and an airline,
hadn't been mentioned as a potential Tiffany suitor. He hasn't made
any filings to the Securities and Exchange Commission involving
Tiffany, which would be required if he owned 5 percent or more of
the company's stock.
   Tiffany stock rallied on news of Trump's interest. It closed at
$60.37{, up $6.12{ a share in composite New York Stock Exchange
trading.
   New York-based Tiffany, which owns tony jewelry stores in
numerous cities and a flagship store on Fifth Avenue adjacent to the
Trump Tower building, was founded in 1837 by Charles Lewis Tiffany.
   It was acquired by cosmetics company Avon Products Inc. in 1979,
by which time Tiffany had become a public company traded over the
counter.
   Tiffany's management took the company private in 1984 in a buyout
from Avon for $135.5 million. In May 1987, Tiffany made an initial
public offering on the New York Stock Exchange at $23 a share.
   For the first half of Tiffany's 1989 financial year, which ended
July 31, the company earned $9.8 million, or 63 cents a share, up 44
percent from $6.8 million, or 44 cents a share, a year earlier.
Sales in 1989's first half rose 35 percent to $159 million from
$117.9 million.
   Trump obtained the clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act
which generally requires advance notification of stock or asset
acquisitions if a purchase would result in an acquirer holding 15
percent or more of the voting stock of a company or more than $15
million worth of a company's voting stock.
   A Federal Trade Commission spokesman Thursday confirmed that the
agency granted Trump early termination of the legal waiting period
specified in the act. The waiting period is 15 days from when
notification documents are submitted to the government for purchases
taking the form of cash tender offers and 30 days for other types of
investments.

<HEAD>Oil Markets Maintain Upward Momentum But Rally Loses Some Energy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oil futures finished with small to moderate gains
Thursday as the recent rally in the energy markets appeared to
weaken.
   Wholesale gasoline prices, which spurted Wednesday on reports of
refinery fires, maintained much of their upward momentum, helped by
a bullish weekly report on stocks.
   But prices of crude oil and wholesale home heating oil ran into
resistance.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the contract for October
delivery of unleaded gasoline rose 0.52 cent to 55.63 cents a
gallon, adding to Wednesday's gain of 1.35 cents. The November,
December and January contracts also moved up.
   Among other refined petroleum products traded on the exchange,
the October contract of No.2 heating oil edged 0.02 cent higher to
55.50 cents a gallon, stabilizing after Wednesday's jump of 0.91
cent. Contracts for more distant months ended with minor gains.
   The October contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
grade of U.S. crude oil, settled at $19.41 per 42-gallon barrel, up
13 cents from Wednesday when the contract settled with an increase
of 23 cents. Other delivery months closed with small losses and
gains.
   Richard Kane, a vice president of energy futures trading at
Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., said activity in the energy pits retained a
positive tone even though some futures faltered.
   ``The market seemed to stall in crude but continued strong for
gasoline,'' said Kane. ``On the day, we saw a very good
consolidation period.''
   Prices for gasoline recently have benefited from concerns about
possible tightening in supplies temporarily. On Wednesday, a fire at
Shell Oil Co.'s Martinez, Calif. refinery and one at Ashland
Petroleum Co.'s refinery in St. Paul Park, Minn. added to the
speculation.
   After the close of business Wednesday, the American Petroleum
Institute issued its weekly inventory statistics that were viewed as
bullish for gasoline.
   The API reported a 5.8 million-barrel drawdown in gasoline stocks
and a 1.5 million-barrel drawdown in crude stocks. The drop in
gasoline inventories was larger than the market had expected while
the crude figure was in line with projections.

<HEAD>Experimental Vaccine for Cow Venereal Disease Shows Promise</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURA MYERS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RENO, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An experimental vaccine for a venereal disease
that kills unborn calves appears to be controlling the illness that
causes an estimated $500 million in losses annually nationwide, a
researcher said Thursday.
   ``Within the next two or three months we'll begin to get a much
better idea of just how efficient this product is,'' said Bill
Kvasnicka, Nevada Extension Veterinarian. ``But at this point,
everything points toward the fact that this is going to be an
extremely good vaccine for use in the field.
   ``We see it as a major breakthrough to controlling this disease.''
   The vaccine for the sexually transmitted trichomoniasis is now
available in 41 states under conditional license from the U.S.
Department of Agriculture. Researchers estimate the vaccine reduces
the incidence of trichomoniasis by more than 90 percent.
   Kvasnicka, Mark Hall, a microbiologist at the University of
Nevada School of Medicine, and Don Hanks, department chair at UNR's
Veterinary Medicine Department, began developing the vaccine a few
years ago.
   ``Nevada's cattlemen asked us to develop something because so
many cattle were infected with this disease,'' said Kvasnicka,
citing statistics that 44.1 percent of Nevada cattle tested positive
for the disease in 1987.
   Adult cows don't show symptoms of the disease when infected with
trichomoniasis that's spread during breeding. But cows with the
illness can become infertile, abort or their fetuses die, Kvasnicka
said.
   Vaccinated cows tested so far in Nevada are ``clearing'' the
trichomoniasis disease within weeks and there appears to be no
embryonic damages, Kvasnicka said.
   ``It's really amazing,'' he said. ``But we're still measuring the
impact on whether we can save the embryos.''
   Researchers are scheduled next week to check on a couple of
Nevada cattle herds that have been vaccinated to determine whether
the disease has killed any unborn calves.
   ``A key test will come in October when we test the cattle after
120 days of pregnancy,'' he said. ``But we're pretty optimistic
because the disease appears to have the biggest effect in the 30 to
60 day period of pregnancy.''
   Cows have a 282-day gestation period.
   An acutely infected herd can lose up to 40 percent of its calves
while one that has been carrying the disease for years can lose as
many as 10 percent of its unborn calves, Kvasnicka said.
   If the vaccine is proven safe, Kvasnicka said the USDA is
planning by Jan. 1 to decide whether to fully license the product
that was refined by Fort Dodge Laboratories.
   In the early 1980s, researchers in Australia studied the disease,
developing a vaccine for bulls. But Hall said that didn't stop the
disease.
   ``The problem with that approach is that if one bull in a herd
fails to develop immunity and becomes infected, he passes the
disease to every heifer he breeds,'' he explained. ``That is not a
good way to go. We need to protect the whole herd.''

   Traders carried the dollar to the highest levels
in nearly three months on Thursday, although selling by central
banks knocked the currency off its peak of the day.
   Central banks in West Germany, France, Spain, Italy and
Switzerland confirmed they sold dollars to restrain the currency,
and traders said the Bank of Canada and the U.S. Federal Reserve
joined in the concerted action.
   The bankers are committed to keeping exchange rates stable to
avoid damage to world trade.
   At its peak in late European trading the dollar went above 1.99
West German marks, just shy of the psychologically important level
of 2 marks to the dollar. It ended the New York trading day below
1.98 marks.
   Propelling the dollar upward have been attractive U.S. interest
rates and confidence in the health of the U.S. economy and financial
markets. The dollar is near its levels of mid-June, when a rally
carried it to two-year highs.
   The volume of trading was not especially heavy, reflecting
traders' uncertainty about the strength of the current rally, said
Keith Raphael, an assistant vice president at Bank Brussels Lambert
in New York.
   In the absence of heavy buying demand, central banks were able to
get some results from a relatively modest amount of dollar-selling.
Still, many traders expected the market to keep testing the central
banks' resolve.
   ``There's fundamentally no reason for the dollar to come off,''
said Bill Doyle, a corporate foreign exchange trader at the Hong
Kong and Shanghai Banking Corp. branch in New York.
   In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 146.87 yen, up 0.22 yen from
Wednesday's close. Later in London the dollar was quoted at 147.10

   In London, the dollar gained against the British pound. It cost
$1.5460 to buy one pound, cheaper than $1.5552 late Wednesday. In
New York the pound traded at $1.5520, weaker against the dollar than

<HEAD>Seagram's Profit Up 20 Percent in Second Quarter</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Figures are U.S. dollars</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Seagram Co. Ltd. reported Thursday that its
second-quarter profit jumped 20 percent from a year earlier, due
partly to continued strength in its beverage business.
   The Montreal-based company said net income for the three months
ended July 31 rose to $198.4 million, or $2.07 a share, from $165.5
million, or $1.74 a share, in the same period in 1988.
   Revenue totaled $1.3 billion, up 5 percent from $1.2 billion last
year.
   For the first half of its fiscal year, Seagram netted $394.9
million, or $4.07 a share, on revenue of $2.5 billion. That was 20
percent higher than earnings in 1988 of $328 billion, or $3.45 a
share, on $2.2 billion in revenue.
   Seagram attributed the increase in earnings to continued strength
in its beverage business, which includes distilled spirits, wine and
juice, and to favorable results of chemical giant Du Pont Co., in
which it holds a 24 percent stake.
   Among Seagram's brand-name products are Chivas Regal, Martell
Cognacs, Mumm and Perrier-Jouet Champagnes, Seagram's Coolers and
Tropicana Pure Premium Orange Juice.

<HEAD>Belly Futures Surge On Hopes For Polish Pork Aid</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Futures prices for frozen pork bellies soared the 2-cents-a-pound
daily limit Thursday on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange on
speculation that America's belly surplus could disappear in a
package of food aid to Poland.
   On other markets, soybean futures posted strong gains while
energy futures and precious metals futures were mixed.
   Frozen pork belly futures settled 2 cents higher across the board
with the contract for delivery in February at 46.82 cents a pound.
The rally helped lift livestock futures contracts: live cattle
settled .12 cent to .55 cent higher with October at 72.70 cents a
pound; feeder cattle were .30 cent to .58 cent higher with October
at 82.05 cents a pound; live hogs were .03 cent lower to .40 cent
higher with October at 39.75 cents a pound.
   The February pork-belly contract has risen about 21 percent in
value since Aug. 1, when February bellies traded as low as 38.70
cents a pound.
   Most of the gains have occurred in the past week on hopes that
some of the near-record supplies of bellies languishing in deep
freeze will be given to Poland along with other U.S. commodities.
   ``We probably will end up shipping bellies to Poland,'' said Dale
Durchholz, a livestock-market analyst with AgriVisor Services Inc.
in Bloomington Ill. ``The question is how many and when.''
   A pork belly is the part of a pig from which bacon is made.
   The Agriculture Department's last count showed 96.4 million
pounds of pork bellies in cold storage as of Aug. 1, the largest
supply for that date since the record year of 1971.
   Analysts say the resulting drop in bacon prices has led to
greater consumption and a more rapid movement of bellies out of
freezers, so that the USDA's Sept. 22 cold-storage report is
expected to show 55 million to 60 million pounds in cold storage as
of Sept. 1.
   When talk of a Polish pork-belly shipment first surfaced last
week, traders were speculating the amount would be about 30 million
pounds.
   On Wednesday, a financial news service reported the Poles were
seeking 50,000 metric tons, or more than 110 million pounds each of
bellies and beef.
   U.S. officials have been cautious in their statements about a
possible shipment. On Thursday, Christopher Goldthwait, an assistant
administrator with the USDA's foreign agriculture service, said it
was premature to talk about quantities or even about what
commodities may be included in an aid package.
   Durchholz said the market may be overreacting, but he conceded
the U.S. belly surplus no longer looked so enormous.
   ``When I start looking at the numbers being batted around, all of
a sudden you're saying that what was an overabundance is not
necessarily so,'' he said.
   Soybean futures prices reached two-week highs on the Chicago
Board of Trade, boosted by perceptions of increased foreign demand
for U.S. soy products and by a bullish harvest forecast from
Memphis, Tenn.-based Sparks Commodities Inc.
   Sparks pegged the 1989 U.S. soybean crop at 1.85 billion bushels
compared with the USDA's August estimate of 1.91 billion bushels.
The USDA will revise its crop estimates on Tuesday.
   If Sparks is right, soybean prices could be headed for an
extended stay above $6 a bushel, said Pat O'Connell, a grain market
analyst with Refco Inc. in Chicago.
   Soybeans settled 4\ cents to 9\ cents higher with September at
$5.96} a bushel; wheat futures settled 1 cent lower to 1\ cents
higher with September at $3.97 a bushel; corn was 1 cent lower to 1
cent higher with September at $2.36{ a bushel; oats were \ cent to 2
cents higher with September at $1.36\ a bushel.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, West Texas Intermediate
crude oil settled 4 cents lower to 13 cents higher with October at
$19.41 a barrel; heating oil was .11 cent lower to .04 cent higher
with October at 55.50 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .10 cent
to .54 cent higher with October at 55.63 cents a gallon.
   On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold futures settled $1.40
lower across the board with October at $362.30 a troy ounce; silver
was 1.3 cents to 1.7 cents higher with September at $5.117 a troy
ounce.

   Seven large companies will offer at-home
emergency child care to more than 13,000 employees in a yearlong
experiment in day-care assistance.
   The employees will qualify for emergency assistance in a variety
of situations that typically force parents to stay home from work:
when a child becomes ill and cannot go to school, when the family's
regular child care arrangements fall through, or when a parent is
suddenly called away on business. An employee will be entitled to
use the service up to three consecutive days.
   ``This is a perfect example of what I have in mind when I write
about the concept of the family-friendly workplace,'' Edward F.
Zigler, a Yale professor and a longtime advocate of a national child
care policy, told The New York Times in a story published Thursday.
   The seven companies, all in New York, are Home Box Office,
Colgate-Palmolive, National Westminster Bank USA, the Time Inc.
Magazine Co., the accounting firm Ernst &amp; Young, the electric
utility Consolidated Edison Co. and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher, &amp;
Flom, New York City's largest law firm.
   A mixture of bottom-line profit considerations and concern for
employees spurred companies to create the program, officials said.
   ``We no longer live in communities where there are extended
families, or where we even know our neighbors, so parents have no
backup systems,'' said Karol Rose, manager of the Work and Family
Program at Time.
   ``When an employee doesn't come to work, or leaves a child in a
situation he worries about, it is stressful for the employee and
costly for the employer.''
   Five participating companies will pay the full cost of the care,
about $10.50 an hour, and the others will pay most of the cost, with
employees covering the balance.
   Some companies expect the program to cut costs because of the
high cost of temporary workers. For example, Home Box Office pays
$15 to $20 an hour to hire a temporary word processor, said Nancy
Platt, a company spokeswoman.

<TEXT>
   More than a year after threatening to seek
control of Allegheny International Inc., an investment group led by
Irwin Jacobs said Thursday it has reduced its holding in the company
to 6.75 percent.
   The group, which includes Minneapolis banker Carl Pohlad,
previously held 9 percent of the appliance maker's stock. It
disclosed the latest move in a filing with the Securities and
Exchange Commission, but did not give a reason for reducing its
Allegheny stake.
   Neither Jacobs nor Pohlad returned phone calls seeking comment on
the move and there was no answer after 5 p.m. EDT at Allegheny's
headquarters in Pittsburgh.
   Before Allegheny was given approval in June 1988 to file a
bankruptcy reorganization plan, Jacobs' group had indicated to the
SEC that it might seek control of the company.
   In late July, Allegheny introduced its sixth proposal to
reorganize after management's first five plans failed to win the
approval of creditors.

<HEAD>EPA Orders Du Pont To Stop Sale Of Two Fungicides</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chemical giant Du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co. has been
ordered to stop selling two fungicides which were contaminated with
an herbicide during manufacture, the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency announced Thursday.
   The two fungicides, Benlate and Tersan, were contaminated with
atrazine during manufacture by a subcontractor, Terra Chemicals of
Blythe, Ark., said spokesman Pete Bentley of the EPA Philadelphia's
office.
   Use of the tainted fungicides poses potential risks of plant
injury and illegal residue on food crops, the EPA reported. Benlate
is registered for use on ornamental plants and certain food crops,
while Tersan is registered for turf and ornamental uses.
   Bentley said since atrazine is applied early in the growing
season, residue from the pesticide is not normally found on crops.
Because of that tolerance standards for atrazine residue have not
been established by the EPA.
   Benlate, however, is applied later in the growing season and
because of that atrazine residue could show up, Bentley said.
However, the contamination does not pose a significant health
threat, he said.
   The EPA issues between 1,000 and 2,000 stop-sale orders a year
and the move is not considered unusual, Bentley said.
   Du Pont spokesman Sam Waltz said most of the product has already
been sold and the company initiated a voluntary recall last month.
   The EPA issued the stop-sale order after receiving numerous
complaints of plant injury nationwide, Bentley said. Because
atrazine is an herbicide, the contaminated Benlate was killing some
of the plants it was applied on.

   Mazda Motor of America Inc. has formed a
task force to study whether Mazda should make a luxury line for the
U.S. market to compete with Honda's Acura, Nissan's Infiniti and
Toyota's Lexus.
   Mazda, riding high on its hot-selling roadster Miata, made the
announcement Wednesday.
   The company's U.S. sales arm also said it had restructured its
divisions in a move that solidifies George McCabe's spot as the
top-ranking U.S. executive. McCabe, who had been group vice
president of sales and marketing, was promoted to group vice
president in charge of operations as well.
   August sales of trucks and cars from the No. 4 Japanese automaker
increased 11 percent from 1988 to 35,131, including 5,029 Miatas,
which were not available in August 1988. For the first eight months
of 1989, sales were off 1.8 percent, to 239,232.
   Toyota Motor Corp., Nissan Motor Co. and Honda Motor Co. all have
or will have separate luxury car divisions in the United States by
the end of the year. Wednesday's announcement of the task force by
Mazda was the first official indication that it might do the same.
   Richard Colliver, 50, formerly senior vice president of Mazda's
western area operations, was named to head the task force, which
will report to Yoshi Taura, president of Mazda Motor of America.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The two broadest measures of the nation's money
supply fell in the week ended Aug. 28, the Federal Reserve Board
reported Thursday.
   The Fed said the measure known as M2 fell to a seasonally
adjusted $3,137.3 billion from $3,138.4 billion the previous week.
   An even broader measure, M3, fell to a seasonally adjusted
$4,005.4 billion from $4,010.4 billion.
   The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, fell to a
seasonally adjusted $777.2 billion from $779.6 billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply
measures.
   The annual growth rate in M2 so far this year is 3.3 percent,
which is within the Fed's target range of 3 percent to 7 percent.
The annual growth rate in M3 is 3.6 percent, which is within the
Fed's target range of 3.5 percent to 7.5 percent. The Fed has not
set a target for M1 growth since early 1987.
   For the latest 13 weeks, M2 averaged $3,112.2 billion, a 4.6
percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous 13
weeks. M3 averaged $3,994.4 billion, up 4.1 percent, while M1 fell
3.0 percent to an average of $775.2 billion.
   In other reports:
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported commercial and
industrial loans at major New York City banks fell $3.03 billion.
   _The Federal Reserve said bank borrowings from the Federal
Reserve System at the discount window, excluding extended credit,
averaged $492 million a day in the week ended Wednesday, down from
$540 million the previous week.
   _The Federal Reserve said net free reserves averaged $535 million
in the two weeks ended Wednesday, up from from $246 million in the
previous two-week period.
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that the monetary
base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank reserves held at
Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and in circulation,
was $291.9 billion in the two-week period ended Aug. 23, up from
$289.5 billion two weeks earlier.

<TEXT>
   Citing stock declines and losses
exceeding $126 million, a Datapoint Corp. shareholder said Thursday
he is trying to oust takeover specialist Asher B. Edelman as
chairman and place his own nominees on the company's board.
   ``I think the company needs a workout or turnaround philosophy
rather than its present philosophy,'' said Martin S. Ackerman, a New
York attorney who tries to revive troubled companies.
   Ackerman filed papers with the Securities and Exchange Commission
on Thursday stating why he believes Edelman should be removed from
Datapoint's board.
   Ackerman is awaiting SEC clearance to submit a 25-page proposal
to Datapoint's estimated 4,500 shareholders seeking their consent.
More than 40 percent of the computer company's stock is held by 46
large institutions, he said.
   ``If the institutions think they've had enough of Edelman, then
I'll win,'' said Ackerman, who also is chairman and chief executive
officer of Authorized Distribution Network Inc., a New Jersey-based
computer sales and service company.
   The motion should be put to the stockholders within 60 days, he
said.
   Edelman ousted Datapoint's longtime management in March 1985. He
used some of Datapoint's liquid capital for investments, mostly in
bids to take over other corporations.
   In the SEC filing, Ackerman said a review of public information
indicates that Datapoint's stock value has declined about 58 percent
since Edelman took over in 1985, a period in which the Standard &amp;
Poors Composite Index increased 81 percent.
   Also, according to Ackerman, from fiscal year 1985 to 1988
Datapoint suffered net losses exceeding $106 million, and it had a
$20.3 million net loss for the nine months ending April 29.
   He claims Edelman used Datapoint money for speculation in the
securities of other companies and that Edelman and his associates on
the board were paid large fees by Datapoint.
   Edelman did not immediately return a telephone call Thursday
seeking comment.
   By law, Ackerman said, he could only approach up to 10 Datapoint
stockholder institutions about his plans for the company, and he has
contacted eight. ``So far all of them have encouraged us to go
forward,'' he said.
   Ackerman, a Datapoint stockholder since May, said if he is
successful in taking control of the Datapoint board, he would
immediately halt the company's involvement in investing in the
stocks of potential takeover targets.
   He said Datapoint needs to get back into computers and ``out of
the raid and trade business.''
   Datapoint has about $330 million in annual sales and employs
2,600 people.
   It encountered trouble in the early 1980s because of a soft
computer market, a fight with stockholders who claimed in a lawsuit
the company misled them, and an inability to sell San Antonio real
estate and lease office space in Datapoint-owned buildings.

<HEAD>Delaware Judge Rules Chris-Craft Has No Voting Rights in Time-Warner
Merger</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Delaware judge ruled Thursday that Chris-Craft
Industries Inc., a major shareholder in Warner Communications Inc.,
has no power to veto the merger between Warner and Time Warner Inc.
   Chancery Court Judge William Allen, ruling in Wilmington, Del.,
said the terms of a class of preferred stock held by a Chris-Craft
subsidiary, BHC Inc., did not entitle Chris-Craft to vote on the
merger of the two media giants.
   Allen ruled in response to a request for a declaration of
Chris-Craft's rights by Warner and Time Warner.
   Time Inc. completed a $14 billion tender offer for Warner in
July, and then changed its name to Time Warner Inc. The companies'
merger is expected to be completed later this year.
   A decision by Allen, later upheld by the Delaware Supreme Court,
threw out a challenge to the merger by Paramount Communications
Inc., which had sought to acquire Time Inc. for $12 billion.
   In his latest decision, Allen said that under the terms of the
stock, Chris-Craft does not ``possess a veto over every merger in
which its interests would be adversely affected.''
   Chris-Craft contended it had a right to vote on the merger
because its preferred Warner shares can be converted into preferred
Time Warner shares.
   Warner, Time Warner and Chris-Craft have settled other parts of
their dispute.
   Warner and Chris-Craft Chairman Herbert Siegel have been feuding
ever since Chris-Craft helped Warner fend off an unwanted takeover
bid from publisher Rupert Murdoch in 1984.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission does not
believe it has authority to intervene in Sir James Goldsmith's
hostile takeover bid for the British conglomerate BAT Industries
PLC, two congressmen said Thursday.
   In a letter to Reps. Neal Smith, D-Iowa, and Harold Rogers,
R-Ky., departing SEC Chairman David Ruder said the agency would
monitor the battle for London-based BAT, which owns several major
U.S. companies, although it lacked jurisdiction.
   Ruder's response led the two lawmakers to issue a joint statement
saying new legislation may now be needed to strenghten the SEC's
ability to protect U.S. shareholders.
   ``The House is now much more likely to support legislation that
would ensure that the SEC does have jurisdiction to intervene in
this and other highly leveraged offshore transactions,'' said the
two legislators.
   ``But if the new SEC chairman has different views on the issue,''
they said, ``or if the commission asserts jurisdiction as Chairman
Ruder indicated they might do if an understanding of the facts
changes, new legislation may not be required.''
   Ruder has said he will leave the SEC at the end of the month.
President Bush has nominated White House assistant Richard Breeden
to succeed him.
   Goldsmith's consortium, Hoylake Investments Ltd., launched a $21
billion takeover bid for BAT, the world's largest tobacco company,
in late July.

<HEAD>Ashland Oil, National Iranian Settle for $325 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ASHLAND, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ashland Oil Inc. said Thursday it had settled
a dispute with the National Iranian Oil Co. for $325 million, less
than a week before a trial was scheduled to begin in Mississippi.
   The dispute has been the subject of litigation between Ashland
and National Iranian since 1980 in courts in England, Bermuda and
the United States, as well as other proceedings, Ashland said.
   It involved National Iranian's claim for about $283 million of
unpaid invoices for crude oil shipments to Ashland in 1979, plus
interest of about $285 million, for a total claim of about $768
million.
   John R. Hall, Ashland Oil's chairman and chief executive officer,
said in a statement the settlement was fair and in the best
interests of both parties.
   ``Ashland never disputed receiving the crude oil or that it was
obligated to pay a reasonable price for it,'' Hall said in the
release. ``Ashland simply wished to recover losses it sustained in
1979 due to breaches of contract by NIOC. Considering Ashland had
the use and benefit of $283 million for almost 10 years, we feel
this settlement satisfactorily addresses our counterclaims.''
   Ashland had counterclaimed in the courts for breaches of contract
by National Iranian.
   A trial regarding National Iranian's claim was scheduled to start
in U.S. District Court in Jackson, Miss., on Sept. 11. No trial date
had been set in a case in Bermuda.
   Hall said the settlement will result in a pre-tax charge of $42
million in Ashland's fiscal fourth quarter, ending Sept. 30.
   Ashland is the nation's largest independent oil refiner.

<HEAD>Armco Agreement Ratified</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Members of the United Steelworkers union
ratified a new four-year agreement with Armco Inc., the union said
Thursday.
   The agreement covers 4,700 Armco workers at plants in Ashland,
Ky., Kansas City, Mo., and Baltimore, Md. It was approved by a mail
ballot vote of 3,011 to 685, the union said.
   ``This is an outstanding agreement consistent with the pattern
established at other major steel producers that restores past
sacrifices, assures future economic improvements and develops new
programs for training,'' said Jim Bowen, chairman of the USW
bargaining committee.
   Highlights of the agreement, which runs through July 31, 1993,
include a $500 signing bonus, a profit-sharing plan and immediate
restoration of past wage sacrifices that averaged $1 an hour at the
Baltimore and Kansas City plants.
   The agreement also features wage increases at Baltimore and
Kansas City averaging 35 cents an hour on Aug. 1, 1991, and 40 cents
an hour a year later. Ashland workers will receive average increases
of $1 an hour on Jan. 1, 1991, and 25 cents each of the following
years.

   Kemper Financial Services Inc. said Thursday it
was dissolving its 9-year-old joint venture with Scotland's Murray
Johnstone Group because each firm had reached the goal it
established at the outset.
   The joint-venture firm, Kemper-Murray Johnstone International
Inc. has been providing international asset-management services for
U.S. accounts since 1980.
   Charles M. Kierscht, president of Kemper Financial, said Kemper
had accumulated international investment expertise while Murray
Johnstone had gained a foothold in the U.S. investment-services
market.
   ``These two objectives have been pursued successfully over the
past nine years during which time the businesses of both Kemper and
Murray Johnstone have grown substantially,'' Kierscht said in a news
release.
   On the Kemper side, assets under management increased from $8
billion in 1980 to more than $56 billion today, Kemper said.
   Murray Johnstone has grown from $1 billion in 1980 to $7.5
billion today.
   The breakup is effective Dec. 31, Kemper said.
   ``The primary objective of both parties is to ensure the
continuity of asset management and client servicing during the
transition period and thereafter,'' Kierscht said.

<HEAD>Computer Printer Company Rejects Takeover, Announces Restructuring</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dataproducts Corp. spurned a buyout bid from a
New York investment firm Thursday and said it would restructure by
laying off 400 employees, a fifth of its U.S. work force, and
selling its headquarters and a New England subsidiary.
   The computer printer maker said it expected to realize about $60
million in cash after completing the sales and paying costs of the
restructuring and taxes. It said it would distribute the profit to
shareholders as a special dividend worth about $3 per share.
   The regular semi-annual dividend of 8 cents per share will be
dropped.
   The company is facing tough domestic and Japanese competition as
well as the takeover proposal by DPC Acquisition Partners, a group
led by John K. Castle, a former chief executive of the Wall Street
investment firm Donaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette Securities Corp.
   DPC owns 8 percent of Dataproducts' shares and proposed last
month to buy the rest for $273 million, or $15 a share, with at
least $10 per share in cash.
   Dataproducts said neither that offer, nor another buyout proposal
it declined to describe in detail, had adequate financing.
   It said its board decided restructuring was best for its
shareholders after it and its investment bankers, Goldman Sachs &amp;
Co., discussed selling all or part of its businesses ``with more
than 70 entities.''
   Dataproducts shares fell $2.25 Thursday to close at $10 on the
American Stock Exchange.
   The company said it would save about $20 million a year through
the layoffs.
   It said it intended to sell Wallingford, Conn.-based Dataproducts
New England, which makes heavy-duty computer printers and
communications equipment for the military.
   DPC last month offered to buy the New England operation in
exchange for $25 million cash and its existing stake in Dataproducts.
   Dataproducts said it agreed in principle to sell its 21-acre
headquarters property to Trizec Properties Inc. for $63 million. The
company said it will lease back the facilities for two years while
it looks for a cheaper place to relocate in Southern California.
   Dataproducts also said it would:
   _Take one-time charges of $45 million this fiscal year in
connection with the restructuring. The sale of the headquarters and
the New England subsidiary are expected to offset the charges.
   _Save corporate expenses by decentralizing into three stand-alone
operations: printer equipment, printer supplies and solid ink
printers and technology.
   _Phase out most domestic printer manufacturing, relocating it to
its plants in Hong Kong and Dublin, Ireland.

<HEAD>Appeals Court Sides With Chrysler Corp.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals panel Thursday upheld
Chrysler Corp. in an antitrust lawsuit filed by three companies that
buy and resell replacement parts for Chrysler-produced vehicles.
   A three-judge panel of the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
upheld a ruling by U.S. District Judge Robert DeMascio of Detroit in
favor of Chrysler.
   International Logistics Group Ltd., Aargus Truck and Automotive
Supply Inc. and Guardian Auto Supply Inc. sued Chrysler, alleging
the automaker illegally conspired to restrain trade.
   The companies also alleged that Chrysler attempted to monopolize
the resale of Chrysler-produced auto parts to Chrysler-franchised
dealers and to the government.
   Chrysler argued that it and about 2,400 independent manufacturers
or suppliers of compatible replacement parts compete for the
replacement parts market. Chrysler also argued that the plaintiffs
failed to prove their monopoly allegations because Chrysler's share
of the replacement-parts market was only about 20 percent.
   DeMascio, presiding at a trial of the lawsuit, issued rulings in
February and May 1988 in favor of Chrysler. The three plaintiff
companies appealed.
   The companies buy and resell Chrysler-produced and compatible
replacement parts for Chrysler vehicles. Businessman Theodore Henke
owns and operates the three companies through stock ownership.

<HEAD>Dollar Up, Share Prices Gain</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: New throughout to UPDATE with morning Nikkei, comments.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar was slightly lower against the
Japanese yen during morning trading Friday, while share prices on
the Tokyo Stock Exchange gained moderately.
   The dollar closed the morning trading session at 146.55 yen, down
0.32 yen from Thursday's close of 146.87 yen. After opening lower at
146.59 yen, the currency ranged from 146.40 to 146.90 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which lost
118.75 points the previous day, gained 72.03 points, or 0.21
percent, to close the morning session at 34,224.59.
   Currency dealers said there were strong dollar-buying incentives
following Thursday's decision by West Germany's central bank to
leave that nation's interest rates unchanged.
   A dealer with a major commercial bank in Tokyo, who spoke
anonymously, said the dollar edged up from the opening with some
early buying, but profit-taking quickly eased its upward path.
   On the stock market, the Nikkei index moved higher as investors
welcomed the yen's reversal against the dollar, dealers said.
   But a dealer at Nikko Securities Co., speaking anonymously, said,
``We still need to determine whether the yen-dollar rate has really
stabilized or is just easing temporarily.''
