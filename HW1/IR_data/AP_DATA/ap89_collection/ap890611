<HEAD>Small Plane Makes Emergency Landing During Storm, Four Killed, Officials
Say</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A small commercial plane with 20 people
aboard made an emergency landing near the Venezuelan border during a
storm Sunday, killing four people and injuring 12, the government
said.
   The plane, a Canadian-built Twin Otter operated by the private
domestic company Aerotaca, landed on a bank of the Casanara River
because of a driving rain, said Colombia's Civil Aeronautics Agency.
   The report did not say what damage the plane suffered or how the
four people died, and it did not give the breakdown of passengers
and crew. A press report said all people aboard the twin-engine
plane were Colombian.
   Among the passengers were Colombian folk singer and composer
Arnulfo Briceno as well as reporters and television cameramen
invited by the state-owned company Ecopetrol to retrace the route
taken by Simon Bolivar during the final battles on Colombian
independence from Spain 170 years ago, said an agency spokesman.
   The names of the other passengers and crew were were not
immediately available and it was not known whether Briceno was among
the victims.
   The plane was flying between Bogota and Tame, an oil town 220
miles east of the capital, the spokesman said, speaking on condition
of anonymity.
   A company source said the pilot reported the plane could not land
in Tame because of the heavy rain and was fly on to Bucaramang, the
largest city in eastern Colombia. Authorities declared the plane
missing when it failed to reach its destination.
   Some Colombian Air Force units searched for the plane, but it was
not immediately clear who spotted the aircraft.

<HEAD>Seven Overcome by Carbon Monoxide at Ice Rink Released From Hospital</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEAVERTON, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Seven people hospitalized after being
overcome by carbon monoxide in an ice skating rink were released
Saturday, and special precautions were taken to avoid more problems.
   The seven were among 25 people sickened by gas emitted from an
ice grooming machine, known as a Zamboni, during a hockey tournament
at the rink Friday. The others were treated with oxygen at the scene.
   A faulty exhaust system on the Zamboni apparently caused it to
emit the carbon monoxide, which stayed close to the ice, said
Tualatin Valley Fire and Rescue Department dispatcher Rod Nodland.
He said the carbon monoxide readings in the arena were at safe
levels Saturday.
   John McBride, the Valley Ice Arena general manager, said large
fans were set up Saturday to circulate air at the rink and the ice
grooming machine was fitted with a catalytic converter to reduce its
emissions.
   He theorized that extra refrigeration used to keep the ice solid
in recent warm weather brought the temperature so low in the arena
Friday that carbon monoxide from the Zamboni stayed near the ice and
wouldn't disperse normally.
   This was the second year in a row that carbon monoxide poisoning
has occurred at the rink during a hockey game for the Rose Festival,
the city's annual June festival.
   Paramedics were first alerted to the problems at the rink Friday
night when a parent sought aid for a child that was vomiting.
Several children complained of dizziness and nausea, and at least
one child fainted.
   Dr. Gregory Lorts of Providence Hospital said one boy brought
there Friday night was treated for 90 minutes in a glass-enclosed,
pressurized chamber, where pure oxygen was pumped into the boy's
lungs.
   Because of the relatively low levels of the carbon monoxide in
Friday's incident, Lorts said, it is unlikely that any person at the
rink would suffer long-term ill effects.
   Carbon monoxide is odorless, tasteless and colorless and is
produced during combustion.
   Capt. Terry Kline, who headed Tualatin Valley Fire and Rescue's
hazardous-materials team at the rink, said initial readings of
carbon monoxide in the building were 120 to 170 parts per million of
air.
   He said 50 parts per million was considered the maximum
concentration before people felt sick, and 1,500 parts per million
would be lethal.

   Police on Saturday arrested nearly 600 abortion opponents who
tried to blockade clinics around the nation, including one in Los
Angeles disrupted by shouting and shoving matches between protesters
and abortion rights advocates.
   Protests also took place in Philadelphia, Fort Wayne, Ind.;
Milwaukee; Ann Arbor, Mich., and Richmond, Va.
   Police arrested 250 of the approximately 500 members of the
national anti-abortion group Operation Rescue who staged a sit-in
that blocked doors to the Los Angeles Midland Medical Clinic, said
Police Officer Robert Plourde.
   The demonstrators, who prayed and sang hymns, were far
outnumbered by about 1,000 chanting abortion rights advocates led by
organizers using bullhorns.
   ``This is disgusting! This is a baby!'' Lorna Casey shouted as
she thrust a picture of a fetus at counterdemonstrators.
   ``This woman's ignorance is the mass ignorance of her movement!''
an abortion rights advocate yelled from the crowd, apparently
referring to the debate over when life begins.
   The ill will prompted pushing and shoving as well as angry
shouting matches before about 300 police, including several on
horseback, moved in. It took them about three hours to clear the
sidewalk in front of the clinic, which offers pregnancy counseling,
family planning advice and abortions.
   ``It's a little bit scary today, there's a lot more fighting,''
said Operation Rescue spokeswoman Elaine Bingham. ``Our people are
willing to be beaten or arrested to save the lives of the babies.''
   Among those arrested was Operation Rescue national field director
Joseph Foreman, said Scott McGuirk, another group spokesman.
   The protest was the latest in a series by Operation Rescue as the
U.S. Supreme Court considers a challenge to the Roe vs. Wade
decision legalizing abortion.
   Among the abortion rights advocates at the rally were Norma
McCorvey, 41, of Dallas, who was ``Jane Roe'' in the high court's
landmark 1973 ruling, and Eleanor Smeal, president of the Feminist
Majority and past president of the National Orgniazation for Women.
   ``Rescue the homeless; rescue the many thousands of hungry people
and children that are already here today,'' Ms. McCorvey said
outside the clinic in a message to the protesters. ``Think not about
the women who choose to have the right to control their own bodies
and destinies. You cannot choose their destinies for them.''
   Those arrested were booked on trespassing charges, and many
refused to post $500 bail or to identify themselves, Plourde said.
Without positive identification, detainees cannot be released on
their own recognizance.
   ``Our standard policy is, `Don't post bail,''' McGuirk said.
``Don't accept probation or plea bargaining. Everyone stays (in
jail) until they all get out.''
   In Philadelphia, police arrested all but 10 of the 150
anti-abortion protesters who blocked the doors to the Northeast
Women's Center.
   Protesters surrounded woman trying to enter, said clinic acting
director Diane Straus.
   ``Several women left very upset, in tears, crying and in
stress,'' she said. ``Their health has been endangered.''
   The protest organized by the Pro-Life Non-Violent Action Project
of Southeastern Pennsylvania came three months after a federal judge
issued a permanent injunction against disruptive abortion
demonstrations in the Philadelphia area.
   U.S. District Judge Clarence G. Newcomer's order includes a
$5,000 fine for each violation.
   The center will return to court to accuse the protesters of
violating the injunction, said Straus.
   Michael McMonagle, executive director of the Pro-Life Coalition
of Southeast Pennsylvania, said the protesters ``don't let
injunctions keep them from saving lives.''
   The center also was involved in a case considered the first in
the nation accusing protesters of violating anti-racketeering laws.
Last March, the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a jury
verdict against 27 leaders of the Philadelphia-area movement.
   The leaders and Operation Rescue have been been fined about
$110,000 in the case, which has been appealed.
   In Milwaukee, about 90 of the 225 anti-abortion protesters who
turned out at Affiliated Medical Services, a downtown clinic, were
arrested, police said. Officers had to carry away many, who sat down
and refused to move.
   Nearly 40 abortion rights advocates staged a counterdemonstration
across the street.
   In Ann Arbor, Mich., police arrested 63 of the 100 to 200
protesters who turned out a Planned Parenthood clinic, said Lt.
Craig Roderick.
   The protesters, who were arrested on trespassing charges, were
released after giving officers their names, Roderick said.
   In Richmond, Va., police arrested about 45 anti-abortion
demonstrators who were blocking entrances to a clinic.
   Police Maj. Charles W. Bennett said the protesters were charged
with obstructing public passage to a building. ``They come and
picket a lot, but this is the largest number of arrests,'' Bennett
said.

<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jose Lopez Rega, a police corporal
and amateur astrologer who rose to power after he became President
Juan Domingo Peron's personal secretary, died in jail of a heart
attack. He was 72.
   Lopez Rega's death was announced Friday night by Judge Martin
Irurzun's office.
   The son of Spanish immigrants, Lopez Rega was born Oct. 17, 1916,
in Buenos Aires. He tried a singing career and then became a
policeman before being employed as a bodyguard for Peron, who was
elected president in 1946 and then overthrown in a military coup in
1955.
   Lopez Rega renewed his acquaintance with Peron in the mid 1960s
when the ousted leader was living in exile in Madrid. He became
Peron's personal secretary and returned to Argentina with Peron
after the military dictatorship agreed to free elections.
   Peron was elected president in 1973 and he appointed Lopez Rega
the minister of social welfare.
   Peron died July 1, 1974, and his wife, Isabel, who was vice
president, became chief executive. Lopez Rega was a key adviser to
her and gained wealth and power.
   Critics claim he helped set up the Argentine Anti-Communist
Alliance, a rightist death-squad organization accused of dozens of
killings.
   Isabel Peron was ousted by an armed forces coup in 1976 and Lopez
Rega fled Argentina and went into hiding.
   He was arrested in the United States and extradited to Argentina
in July 1986 to face charges of fraud and conspiracy.
   Earlier this year he was acquitted of fraud but remained in jail
pending trial on charges stemming from his alleged connection to the
Anti-Communist Alliance.

   Two men identified as Chinese Consulate
diplomats announced they can no longer support their government and
said they were defecting at a vigil on Saturday for students slain
in Beijing.
   To the amazement and delight of 5,000 people gathered in front of
City Hall, the duo mounted a stage and said that as Chinese
nationals and as human beings they could no longer go along with a
government whose troops fired on unarmed students.
   Both men were then taken to the nearby offices of the FBI, said a
policeman, Stanley Lee.
   They had called the bureau before the announcement, said K.K.
Woo, one of the rally organizers.
   The two announced their intention to request political asylum in
the United States, an FBI spokesman confirmed.
   A Chinese Consulate spokesman said he had not heard about the
men's statements and had no information.
   The men announced their action at a rally where a largely Asian
crowd, including some crying and many wearing black arm bands,
carried candles and makeshift banners reading ``Their blood, Our
tears.''
   The crowd cheered when the announcement was made, Woo said.
   Rally organizers, reading from the men's Chinese business cards,
identified the speakers as Zhou Li-ming and Chang Li-mun. But they
said they were unsure of the proper English transliteration.
   One of the diplomats told a local television station he was
optimistic about the future of the China's prodemocracy movement
despite the government's political crackdown.
   ``I think their victory is only temporary. The people will win,''
the man, who was not identified, told television station KTVU of
Oakland.
   The station said one of the men was the vice consul and the other
either the consulate's information officer or cultural affairs
officer.
   The FBI would release no information about the men.

   A woman was shot to death in a bedroom
of boxer Thomas Hearns' home on Saturday night and six witnesses
were being questioned, police said.
   One of the boxer's brothers, accompanied by attorney Neil Fink,
was at the police station, but Southfield police Officer Gary Conat
refused to say whether Henry Hearns was among those being questioned.
   The woman, whose name was not released, was shot once in the
head, Conat said. She was in her 20s and known to the Hearns family,
he said. She was found about 9:40 p.m.
   Detectives found a gun they believed was used in the slaying,
said Conat.
   Hearns was in Las Vegas where he is to meet Sugar Ray Leonard on
Monday night in a scheduled 12-round fight for Leonard's World
Boxing Council super-middleweight title at Caesars Palace.
   ``He's going forward with the fight and he says it won't affect
him in the least,'' promoter Bob Arum said in Las Vegas. ``He did
assure me that the fight would go on and he said it wouldn't affect
his performance. Incidents are incidents and they're unfortunate,
but we're all professionals here.
   ``Is he concerned about his brother? He probably is, but he says
he doesn't want to think about it, and he won't.
   ``As he says, he'll block it out of his mind until he knocks Ray
Leonard out Monday night.''
   Arum said three people in Hearns' entourage left Las Vegas for
Detroit, including his younger brother, John Hearns, who is a
student at the University of Nevada-Las Vegas.
   His mother, Lois Hearns, will remain in Las Vegas for the fight.
``Tommy talked to her and asked her to stay in Las Vegas,'' Arum
said. ``She is here and she is going to stay.''
   Arum said ``it has been made clear to me that the (dead) woman
herself has absolutely no connection with Thomas.''
   Asked how he knew that since he didn't know the victim's name, he
said, ``They apparently know who she is.''

<HEAD>Army Lifts Weeklong Curfew on Gaza Strip</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Israel's military Sunday lifted a weeklong
curfew that confined 700,000 Palestinians to their homes in the Gaza
Strip, ending one of the longest restrictions imposed in the
18-month Arab uprising.
   Also Sunday, 15-year-old Mohammed Saeed Shaweeshin died of a
gunshot wound in the head suffered in a clash with soldiers Saturday
in Gaza's Jabaliya refugee camp, Arab reports said. An
eight-year-old boy also was killed in the stone-throwing
confrontation.
   Officials at Israel's Tel Hashomer Hospital near Tel Aviv, where
the teen-ager was taken for treatment, declined immediate comment.
The army said it is checking the report.
   Shaweeshin's death brings the toll to at least 515 Palestinians
killed since the revolt against Israeli rule began in the occupied
West Bank and Gaza Strip. Twenty-two Israelis have died in the
violence.
   Some 4,000 cars carrying Palestinians left Gaza after the curfew
was lifted to take workers to their jobs in Israel, Israel Radio
said.
   But the restriction remained in Jabaliya camp, where 53,000
Palestinians had to stay home.
   The military imposed the curfew June 4 to control the population
by issuing identity cards that workers will have to show to enter
Israel.
   In the Tel Aviv suburb of Petah Tikva, 150 peace activists
demonstrated Sunday against the town's plan to require that Arab day
laborers wait in a specially designated ``transit station'' on the
outskirts.
   The activists say the plan, to keep Arabs out of the town center,
is racist.
   Police have challenging the legality of the station. Its planned
opening Sunday was delayed as town councilors debated.
   Eight Israeli peace activists who met with Palestine Liberation
Organization representatives in June 1987 were charged Sunday in an
Israeli court with violating anti-terror laws.
   Israel considers the PLO a terror organization and bans citizens
from meeting with the group.
   The activists were led by Charlie Biton, a Communist Party
legislator who was not charged because he has parliamentary immunity.
   If convicted, activists could be jailed for up to three years.

   Piedmont Flight 1253 to New York City was
delayed for more than an hour, but the reason wasn't a mechanical
problem, bad weather or labor strife _ it was a harmless 4-foot
snake.
   The plane was taxing out to take off from Baltimore-Washington
International Airport when a passenger saw the serpent slithering
down the aisle and alerted a flight attendant, said Larry Pickett,
spokesman for USAir, Piedmont's parent company.
   ``The pilot pulled back to the gate and all the passengers
deplaned, the maintenance people did their thing and the plane took
off about an hour later,'' Pickett said.
   Workers had to remove three seats in order to capture the
critter, a harmless gopher snake, Pickett said. Airline officials
did not know how it got into the plane, he said.
   The reptile was sent to a pet store.

   Nancy Brehm said she and her daughter and
grandson were upstairs in their house one recent afternoon when they
heard an odd noise in the living room.
   About 12,000 bees, apparently swarming or looking for a new hive,
had flown down the chimney and tried to take up residence in the
Brehm house.
   Mrs. Brehm made a beeline for the upstairs telephone and called
her husband, Bruce, at work.
   ``I know my wife and daughter don't like insects, so I thought
they were exaggerating,'' Brehm said. ``I expected 10 or 20 bees. I
couldn't believe what I saw when I got there.''
   Mrs. Brehm said she called various agencies, including police and
exterminators, but no one would help. She finally persuaded
Peterborough beekeeper John Camp to come to her aid.
   Camp arrived with a beehive, about the same time the fire
department showed up to help the family out a second-floor window.
   Camp coaxed most of the bees into the hive, but a few were left
over.
   ``We were vacuuming bees til 1:30 in the morning and dead ones
are still turning up,'' Mrs. Brehm said.

<HEAD>Soviets Hint at Major Initiatives During Visit</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROL J. WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mikhail S. Gorbachev's first state
visit to West Germany is overshadowed by tragedy and unrest in the
Soviet Union and an accelerating threat worldwide to the socialist
ideology that guides his leadership.
   But the Soviet president's advance men have been deftly
deflecting the distractions, hinting that major initiatives may be
in the making during the much-publicized summit.
   Gorbachev's four-day visit, which begins Monday, comes with high
expectations on both sides. Each speaks of a new era in relations
and a historic chance for closing the gap between East and West.
   Both nations are focusing on the opportunities presented by
Gorbachev's reforms, relegating to the sidelines the reform-related
crises in China, Eastern Europe and among ethnic groups within the
Soviet Union.
   ``We consider this an extremely important meeting, perhaps the
most important one we've had in Europe,'' Gennady I. Gerasimov, the
Soviet government spokesman, said in an interview on Friday.
   Acknowledging West Germans' enthusiasm for the Kremlin leader and
his reform program, Gerasimov said Gorbachev wanted a close look at
West Germany and would go out and ``press the flesh.''
   Asked if Gorbachev planned to respond to President Bush's arms
control initiative announced May 29 during the NATO summit in
Brussels, Gerasimov said: ``There is no ground for a quick reply.''
   He said the conventional weapons reduction plan outlined by Bush
and endorsed by the Western allies has not been formally presented
to negotiators at superpower talks in Vienna, so an official Kremlin
response was unlikely.
   But he said another Soviet step in the disarmament volley was
``possible'' during the summit that opens Monday.
   Another member of the Soviet advance delegation, political
observer Lev A. Bezymensky of the magazine New Times, told reporters
Friday that ``we should let ourselves be surprised'' by what takes
place during the summit.
   Hans Klein, a West German government spokesman, sees the visit as
a chance to reach a goal of ``peace with ever fewer weapons.''
Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher predicted ``a milestone in
German-Soviet relations.''
   The atmosphere of hope, however, has been tainted by numerous
domestic troubles likely to continue boiling while the Soviet leader
is abroad.
   Ethnic unrest in the Central Asian republic of Uzbekistan
reportedly prompted some last-minute schedule changes to allow
Gorbachev to stay in close contact with the Kremlin throughout his
visit.
   The Congress of People's Deputies finally ended its stormy
inaugural session Friday. The lawmakers' struggle to redefine the
nation's course for democracy and their sharp criticism of the
Communist Party amazed the Soviet people, who watched on television,
and preoccupied the Kremlin leadership.
   Soviets are in mourning over the hundreds of deaths resulting
from a train disaster in the Ural Mountains June 3, and the advance
delegation indicated Gorbachev would not be attending a gala concert
in Bonn on Wednesday so as to maintain an appropriately somber
atmosphere. But the hosts' eagerness to give the summit the highest
profile appears to have won out.
   ``The Germans have done a very clever thing,'' said Yuri A.
Gremitskikh, another senior Soviet Foreign Ministry official in Bonn
to prepare the summit. ``They have now made it a concert to benefit
the victims of the train tragedy, so we will have to reconsider.''
   Both sides have pinned high hopes on the visit and its potential
to maintain good momentum in improving relations between East and
West.
   West Germans have embraced Gorbachev's call for ``a common
European home,'' an aim they see as an opportunity to let the
barriers fall between East and West and perhaps lead to an eventual
reunification of Germany.
   The conservative Bonn daily newspaper Die Welt reported two weeks
ago that the West German government ``expects that Gorbachev will
stress the German right of self-determination in some form or
another when he visits West Germany.'' That would soften the
Kremlin's traditional view that reunification could take place only
under a socialist leadership.
   Soviet officials have indicated such a gesture is possible, but
they have given no clues as to what Gorbachev might say on that
subject, or in response to persistent questions about the Berlin
Wall erected by East Germany in 1961.
   Eduard Shevardnadze, the Soviet foreign minister, visited Berlin
on Friday for talks with East German leader Erich Honecker.
   Gerasimov described his visit with Honecker as a matter of
protocol prior to the state visit to West Germany, but the minister
declined to specify what matters would be discussed at the Gorbachev
summit.
   The visit is likely to provide a boost to the standing of West
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
   Gorbachev was rated as the most popular foreign statesman ever in
a poll released a week ago by the weekly magazine Der Spiegel,
outdistancing even John F. Kennedy, and the Gorbachev visit may help
Kohl and his Christian Democratic party in next week's European
Parliament elections.
   Heinrich Vogel, director of the federal Institute for Eastern and
International Studies in Cologne and a specialist in Soviet affairs,
predicted that the summit would focus on atmosphere rather than
substance, mostly because of the sensitive stage in which the
Kremlin leader finds himself.
   Vogel said problems with socialism as an ideology began
escalating with the Polish Solidarity movement in 1980 and lately
have ``been accelerating at an unbelievable pace, a pace that is
really staggering and frightening.''

   The rebels of the Mozambique National Resistance were killed
while attempting to attack a military training center Friday in the
town of Machubane, AIM said, citing a statement by Col. Ernesto
Bulele.
   Machubane is about 120 miles northeast of the capital of Maputo.
   The report gave no additional details and made no mention of
government troop casualties. Information on the fighting is often
sketchy and can take days or even weeks to reach Maputo.
   The rebels have been fighting since 1977 in a bid to undermine
Mozambique's Marxist government.
   The rebels have devastated the economy of the southeast African
nation with hit-and-run attacks on both military and civilian
targets.
   Mozambique is one of the poorest countries in the world and an
estimated 6 million of its 15 million people are in need of food aid.

<HEAD>Replica Of Henry Hudson's Ship Christened At Albany Dock</HEAD>

   Nearly four centuries after explorer Henry
Hudson's crew mutinied and set him adrift, a replica of his ship has
been launched to honor the Netherlands' contributions to the New
World.
   ``What the sea separates, the shipbuilder unites,'' ship designer
Nicholas Benton told a crowd of about 500 Saturday before the
christening of the Half Moon.
   The 85-foot, 120-ton wooden vessel was lowered by crane into the
Hudson River, which Hudson discovered in 1609 during his search for
a Northwest passage to the Orient.
   Two years later, Hudson's crew mutinied, setting him, his young
son and seven others adrift in a small boat in Canada's Hudson Bay.
They were never seen again.
   The replica was conceived by Andrew Hendricks, a dermatologist
who plans to use the Half Moon as a platform to give history lessons
on Dutch contributions.
   Hudson himself was born in England but was working for the Dutch
East India Company at the time he found the river that bears his
name.
   There's a ``historical blind spot'' that keeps historians from
considering Dutch contributions to the New World, Hendricks said.
That's partly because the English ousted the Dutch from their early
stronghold in the New World in the 1600s, he said.
   The Dutch first settled the area between English colonies in
Virginia and New England, including Albany, the nation's oldest
incorporated city, he said.
   The ship will spend the summer touring the states once called the
New Netherlands _ New York, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, New Jersey
and Delaware.
   At the christening, Netherlands Consul General Adrien Tieleman
said the Dutch have always been proud of their ``small contribution
to the mightiest, most free and prosperous nation in the world.''
   The Half Moon replica cost about $1 million, raised mostly
through donations, and took a year to build. The builders are
applying finishing touches and the ship's maiden voyage is scheduled
for July 5.
   About 25 people worked to build the square-rigged ship, which
will be outfitted with replicas of 17th century cannons, said
shipwright Ernie Cowan of Mayville, N.Y.
   Sailmaker David Bierig of Erie, Pa., hand-sewed the ship's nine
sails. About 600 man-hours went into the sails, made of synthetics
treated to look like canvas sails of the 1600s, he said.
   Because ships four centuries ago were built for cargo, the squat
Half Moon won't win any races, Bierig said.
   ``It will be on the slow side,'' he said. ``Sailors were cheap
and in those days there was no reason you needed speed.''

   The Communist Chinese propaganda machine is
working at a frenzied pace to portray the bloody military occupation
of Beijing as a heroic operation against ``counter-revolutionaries.''
   The saturation campaign serves to shield the government from
blame for the June 4 massacre in which hundreds, perhaps thousands
of people died when soldiers fired at unarmed citizens supporting a
movement for a freer society.
   Word of the assault on the pro-democracy movement quickly spread
to several large Chinese cities, where huge crowds took to the
streets to demand the fall of conservative leaders who ordered the
military attack.
   But hardliners such as senior leader Deng Xiaoping and Premier Li
Peng have kept their grip on power, supporting their position with
the propaganda barrage.
   The main vehicle for the campaign has been nationwide television.
   After a few days of virtual silence on the attack, television
began showing grainy black-and-white tapes of angry crowds attacking
soldiers and torching military vehicles. Color videotapes of similar
scenes soon appeared, often shown dozens of times over several days.
   Soldiers indiscriminately firing at crowds or crushing people
with armored vehicles were not shown. Neither were scenes of
hospitals filled with the dead and the injured from the withering
attack on Beijing's Tiananmen Square.
   The videotapes often did not have sound, perhaps so the audience
could not hear the gunfire or the angry chants of ``fascists''
directed at the soldiers.
   The official theme of soldiers as victims soon was expanded, with
television showing injured troops lying in hospital beds. In one
particularly gruesome scene, an evening newscast showed the charred
bodies of three soldiers burned to death, including one who was
disemboweled.
   The campaign also stresses the theme of soldiers as friends.
Under guard of rifle-toting soldiers, propaganda trucks with signs
reading ``the People's Army loves the people'' rolled down Beijing's
main streets with loudspeakers blaring.
   Scenes of soldiers and citizens helping one another have
dominated television, which in recent days have devoted several
hours of special newscasts daily to present the government line.
   On Saturday, television showed a peasant bringing three huge pigs
to applauding soldiers. The next day's evening newscast showed
troops at an elementary school playing with children and helping
them clean their classrooms.
   The newest phase of the propaganda onslaught has shown dozens of
``scoundrels'' and ``counterrevolutionaries'' under arrest on
charges of participating in the demonstrations. Television has shown
them questioned at gunpoint and signing confessions.
   Chinese media also has attacked the U.S. government-funded Voice
of America, which has provided millions of Chinese with an
independent account of the weekend bloodbath.
   In another attempt to quell non-official accounts, television
Saturday urged viewers to turn in a ''rumor-monger'' who was shown
giving a bloody account of the attack. On Sunday, the evening news
reported his capture and the man was shown expressing remorse to
security officials.
   Television interviews with citizens applauding the military
action increased during the weekend.
   ``It gave use great satisfaction to see the People's Liberation
Army go into the city and put down the turmoil,'' said one man.
   Several people who were interviewed said they were shocked by the
attacks on soldiers seen on television. ``I was greatly pained to
see PLA soldiers burned to death and beaten to death,'' primary
school teacher Chen Qing told a television reporter.
   Many Chinese are skeptical of the state-controlled media so it is
impossible to know how many people find the propaganda campaign
convincing.
   ``Not a single person will believe it,'' said one Beijing
University student who claimed he saw more than 10 people shot in
Tiananmen Square by soldiers early June 4.
   But some Chinese who did not see the weekend events themselves
could find the relentless television accounts persuasive.
   ``In Beijing, people know what happened. But those on the outside
do not,'' said another Beijing University student. ``Most Chinese
are peasants. They believe what the government says.''

   Inmates being driven from one jail to
another smilingly showed the officer guarding them their new
discovery: that their seat belts made handy tools for breaking
handcuffs.
   The sheriff's office and FBI didn't smile, though, and are
warning officers nationwide of the technique.
   ``There is danger to every law enforcement officer in the
country,'' said Franklin County Sheriff Earl O. Smith.
   Ten prisoners learned the seat belt trick while being taken from
the downtown jail to the Jackson Pike jail, and before the ride was
over all were free, Smith said Saturday.
   ``When the deputy opened the back of the van, all 10 guys were
smiling and said `See what we did,''' Smith said, adding that each
prisoner held up his arms to show broken handcuffs.
   The cuffs that go around each wrist are connected by a chain,
attached to each cuff by a swivel that moves freely to ensure that
the chain doesn't twist.
   Seat belt clips have one or two holes or slots, that lock them
into place with the buckle. The prisoners learned that jamming the
swivel link through a hole on the clip stops the swivel from turning
freely.
   ``A quick twist of the wrist, and the chain shears off at the
cuff,'' Smith said.
   The prank led Franklin County authorities to issue emergency
bulletins to law enforcement agencies across the state Friday.
Similar warnings also would be given nationwide, the sheriff said,
and an FBI spokesman said an advisory would be placed in the
agency's Law Enforcement Bulletin.
   ``Although only 10 people know the technique, I guarantee that
the entire jail population, all 690 of them, will know how to do it
before the day is up,'' Smith said. ``The only people who won't know
about it is law enforcement officers.''
   Smith ordered seat belts removed from jail vans. He also ordered
that prisoners in police cars be cuffed with their hands behind
their backs and that the seat belts be locked firmly across them.
   Handcuff manufacturers were contacted Friday and are studying
ways of redesigning the handcuffs, Smith said.
   The 10 inmates who revealed their discovery may regret the caper.
The sheriff was not amused.
   ``Charge them with destruction of county property,'' he told
deputies. ``We'll see how funny they think that is.''

<HEAD>Bush Putting Final Touches on Environmental Package</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush worked on the final details
Sunday of a package of proposals aimed at cleaning up the nation's
air by imposing sharp cuts in acid rain pollutants and reducing the
smog that plagues most cities.
   The proposals, to be unveiled at the White House on Monday,
represent the first time in nearly a decade that the White House has
joined in an effort to overhaul federal air quality laws.
   President Reagan refused to send clean air legislation to
Congress during his eight years in office.
   Bush told a conservation group last week his proposals would
represent ``sweeping changes'' in federal air pollution laws and
``significantly improve every North American's quality of life''
whether they live near industrial plants or in the woodland
countryside.
   Environmentalists say Bush's clean air package is his severest
test so far on whether he plans to make good on campaign promises to
take environmental issues seriously.
   While details of the president's proposals are not yet clear,
government and congressional sources said the plan is expected to
include:
   _ Requirements for cutting sulfur dioxide emissions, mostly from
older coal-burning electric power plants by 10 million tons by the
year 2000 to combat acid rain, which has been blamed for destroying
lakes, streams and forests.
   _ A requirement for industry to install control technology to
curb the release of cancer-causing and other toxic chemicals from
such facilities as chemical plants and oil refineries. It also is
likely to streamline the way the Environmental Protection Agency
regulates such chemicals, allowing them to set standards by broad
category rather than chemical by chemical.
   _ Reductions in smog-causing pollutants from automobiles through
a combination of pollution controls and a limited shift to
alternative, cleaner fuels instead of gasoline.
   The urban smog problem, largely caused by automobile pollutants,
has been among the thorniest issues facing the administration. Some
members of the administration have favored requiring specific curbs
to reduce ozone-causing pollutants, while others have favored
broader flexibility that would allow the oil and automobile
industries to work out how best to meet government-imposed targets.
   Even though the president's proposals were expected to fall short
of what some environmentalists sought, they welcomed his
administration's willingness to get involved in efforts to update
the 1970 Clean Air Act.
   Congressional leaders have said that they expect revisions to be
enacted by this Congress, although probably not until next year.
   Legislation already has been introduced in the House to require
stringent reductions in pollutants _ primarily hydrocarbons and
nitrogen dioxide from motor vehicles _ that cause ozone pollution
which in turn is a key component of smog. Other bills already being
considered would require the ``best available technology'' to be
enlisted to curb toxic chemical emissions into the air by industry
and establish specific benchmarks for cutting acid rain pollutants.
   The president's proposal was expected to be less demanding of
industry than some of the legislation already before Congress.
   Environmentalists, for example, have sought a reduction in sulfur
dioxide from power plants of at least 12 million tons over the next
decade and have argued for tightening of automobile tailpipe
emission controls to fight urban pollution.
   The utility industry has called those actions too expensive and
some in the administration, particularly the Office of Management
and Budget and the presidents Council of Economic Advisers, have
agreed.
   During a meeting with the president last week on the clean air
proposals, industry representatives pleaded that the proposals not
be too costly. ``We urged that when the dust settles on clean air,
that we have a healthy economy left,'' said William D. Fay, head of
the Clean Air Working Group, a business coalition.
   After a later meeting attended by environmentalists, the
president was told that pollution itself also is costly as well as
being pervasive.
   To make the point they provided a chart showing that during a
week last summer the air in Kennebunkport, Maine, where the
president has a vacation retreat, had ozone concentrates that were
``unhealthy'' by federal definition on two of the seven days.
   ``He sat there and said, `I'm not safe anywhere,' and we said,
`Yes, and its worse in Houston, Connecticut and Washington,'''
recalled Paul Prichard, one of the environmentalists at the meeting.

<HEAD>Defector: Soviet Committee Quietly Shifts Foreign Policy</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Soviet defector has been telling U.S.
government agencies some of the inner secrets of a little understood
Kremlin body that plays a key role in charting Soviet foreign policy.
   Under Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the International
Department of the Communist Party Central Committee has shifted
course, loosening its ties with Marxist parties in the West and
cultivating relations with other less radical elements, said the
defector, Evgeny Novikov.
   ``Gorbachev started to promote the principles of his `new
thinking,' to find new clients, sometimes at the expense of old
clients, to find parties and groups that have influence in
capitalist countries,'' Novikov said in a recent interview with The
Associated Press.
   The new approach has brought closer Soviet ties to American and
Western European environmental and peace groups that agree with
Gorbachev's approach to disarmament and attempts to lessen
international tension, said Novikov.
   Because his work in the International Department centered on Arab
and Middle Eastern affairs, Novikov declined to speculate on which
Western groups were sympathetic to Gorbachev's new approach.
   U.S. intelligence officials, who said they were not familar with
the specifics of Novikov's case, confirmed that Novikov's
description met their understanding of the International Department.
   They said most U.S. and Western European groups were
sophisticated enough to remain independent even while developing
contacts with Soviet officials known to be linked to the
International Department.
   The International Department, for which Novikov worked from 1970
until his defection last year, was the successor to the Comintern,
or Communist International, or later the Cominform, disbanded by
Josef Stalin in 1947.
   The Comintern was the main organ of Kremlin influence on
communist parties outside the Soviet Union, a means of molding
political platforms and sometimes recruiting intelligence agents,
according to numerous accounts by defectors.
   The International Department shares with the Foreign Ministry
responsibility for formulating Soviet foreign policy, which is
decided by the ruling Politburo, Novikov said. The Foreign Ministry
carries out state-to-state contacts, while the International
Department handles party-to-party matters.
   Senior International Department experts are driven in chauffeured
cars, receive salaries equal to those of deputy ministers and have
access to intelligence reports from the ministries of defense and
foreign affairs, and the KGB, Novikov said in a paper prepared for
the U.S. government.
   Shortly after Gorbachev rose to power in March 1985, he tried to
gain control of the International Department and change its inner
workings by appointing as its chief Anatoly Dobrynin, who had served
as the Soviet ambassador to Washington since the 1960s.
   ``Dobrynin, however, was very much an outsider'' to the Moscow
bureaucracy, Novikov said. Thus Dobrynin's reform attempts
foundered, forcing Gorbachev to move him from the Central Committee
Secretariat into a newly created post as adviser.
   ``The old timers in the International Department opposed
Dobrynin,'' said Novikov. ``The old cadres sabotaged Dobryinin.''
   Last fall, Gorbachev reorganized the Central Committee
Secretariat, naming his right-hand man, Aleksandr Yakovlev, as head
of a newly created International Commission, which controls the
International Department.
   The new head of the International Department is Valentin Falin, a
former ambassador to West Germany.
   Before the reorganization, said Novikov, many of the senior
officials in the International Department dated back to the days of
Mikhail Suslov and Boris Ponomarev, two Stalinist holdovers who
served under the late Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev.
   Novikov lectured from 1970 to 1985 in the Institute for Social
Sciences, which he described as a secret school run by the
International Department in Moscow. His job was to conduct seminars
in political philosophy for small groups of students from Marxist
parties in South Yemen, Syria and Iraq and for two radical
Palestinian groups, the Democratic Front for the Liberation of
Palestine and the Peoples Front for the Liberation of Palestine.
   Professors at the institute drew up classified reports on those
movements, based in part on what the students said in class.
   ``For example, I made a study of the Yemeni Socialist Party, its
origins, history, influence of Marxism, influence of Islam,
influence on the masses,'' said Novikov.
   From 1985 until his defection, Novikov was chief of the Arabic
editorial office of the World Marxist Review in Prague,
Czechoslovakia.
   Arabic versions of the magazine ``were printed mostly in Western
countries, and distributed in various Arab countries under titles
very different from the original.
   ``The goal was to pretend it was a national magazine, produced in
each nation, but 70-100 percent of it was prepared in Prague ...
under directions from the International Department,'' said Novikov.
``Nowhere did it say it was printed in Prague. One percent of the
readers would know where it came from.''
   Novikov crossed the border in Austria in March 1988, was given
asylum by the U.S. Embassy there and spent the next seven months
briefing Western officials.
   Novikov, who has the Soviet equivalent of a doctorate, has been
living in the United States since last September, working as a
butler in a small hotel while he tries to launch a career as a
consultant in Soviet affairs.
   In contrast to past Soviet defectors who complained about
insensitivity on the part of their CIA handlers, Novikov said he
``met with a very human attitude from the United States government.''

   Millions of dollars of special interest money
is expected to prime the political pumps as Republicans battle for
three historically Democratic seats in races spawned by the
congressional ethics wars and the death of Claude Pepper.
   ``You're going to see candidates in all of these races spending a
good deal of time trying to squeeze money out of the lobbyists, and
there's no doubt that millions of dollars special interest funds
will pour in,'' says Michael Waldman of Congress Watch, a citizens
group based here.
   The stakes are not momentous, since Democrats control the House,
259 to 175, and even a Republican sweep would not change things
much. For that matter, registered Democrats predominate in all three
districts.
   But Republicans lost face in April with special-election defeats
in Alabama and Indiana, even though they held on in Wyoming. They
want to avenge those losses in the upcoming round. Democrats, on the
other hand, want to avoid the embarrassment of an upset.
   The three districts are:
   _The 12th District of Texas, taking in much of Fort Worth. Jim
Wright, who has represented it since 1955, stepped down as House
Speaker on May 31 at the end of a yearlong ethics probe and is
expected to resign from the House itself by the end of the month.
   _The 15th District of California, in the rich cotton, fruit and
vegetable-growing San Joaquin Valley, the nation's premier center of
agribusiness. House Majority Whip Tony Coelho, who represented the
district since 1979, announced on May 27 that he would resign to
head off a protracted controversy over a $100,000 ``junk bond''
purchase.
   _The 18th District of Florida, taking in much of Miami, Miami
Beach, Key Biscayne and Coral Gables. Rules Chairman Claude Pepper
died May 30 after representing the district since 1962.
   There is no denying that the races will cost a bundle.
   ``We're talking about $500,000 at this point, but if we have to
go higher, I guess we can,'' says Modesto, Calif., Mayor Carole
Whiteside, already an announced candidate. ``But I want to earn this
race, I don't want to buy it.''
   Candidates in April's Indiana race spent $500,000 each as did
contestants in a Wyoming election where Republicans eked out victory
on April 29. Need for money and lack of time most likely will send
the new set of candidates scurrying to Washington lobbies that have
plenty of ready cash as well as long legislative shopping lists.
   ``I would think that the Democrats would do what they've done
already, which is to organize labor union political action
committees to turn on the spigot, and Republicans will do what we
can to reach out to the business PACs to help raise money for
Republicans,'' says John Buckley, spokesman for the National
Republican Congressional Committee.
   In Texas, Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen already
is putting out word that he backs Fort Worth attorney Pete Geren.
   Geren, 37, a former Bentsen staffer, is unlikely to announce,
however, until after Wright leaves or at least sets a specific date
for his departure. Other Democrats being mentioned as possible
contenders include state Sen. Hugh Parmer and former state Rep. Mike
Millsap as well as Fort Worth Councilman Gary Gilley.
   Republicans include state Rep. Billy Carter, television health
show host Dr. Bob Lanier, airport board member Erma Johnson, former
Republican county Chairman Jim Ryan and county Judge Roy English,
who switched to the GOP at a heavily ballyhooed White House ceremony
in 1986.
   Under Texas law, candidates from both parties slug it out in a
single special election, with a runoff between the two top vote
getters if no one gains a majority.
   In California, Democratic state Rep. Gary Condit is also
campaigning.
   Condit, 41, is a member of the ``Gang of Five,'' conservative
Democrats who warred with liberal Assembly Speaker Willie Brown in
1988. ``I was stripped of all my committee assignments and had my
office moved about once a month,'' Condit chortles.
   The antics helped Condit. ``Fighting with Willie Brown didn't
hurt him at all because fighting with a liberal in that district is
what you want to do,'' says GOP consultant George Gorton of San
Diego.
   Water availability and quality loom as crucial issues in
district, where farmers are also irked by pollution damage to crops
from autos of increasingly numerous commuters to Bay Area jobs. Both
candidates vow to shun negative campaigning.
   Whiteside does say, however, that ``my opponent already has been
involved in special interest politics in Sacramento and Sacramento,
frankly, is not a whole lot better than Washington. I'm glad I
wasn't there.''
   Only one other Democrat has been mentioned as a possible
contender: state Rep. Rusty Areias, D-Los Banos, another ``Gang of
Five'' member. Republicans include Stanislaus County Chairman
Barbara Keating-Edh, Fresno County Supervisor Daran Koligian, Fresno
Councilman Rod Anaforian, Merced businessman Terry Newman and highly
decorated Vietnam veteran Chris Patterakis.
   Under California law, candidates of both parties are lumped in
one race. If no one gains a majority, the top Republican fights the
leading Democrat in a runoff.
   The Florida election, set for Aug. 29, puts the spotlight on the
sizeable Cuban-American community in the Miami area.
   Pepper won their hearts with TV ads in Spanish and firm backing
for Nicaragua's Contra rebels while cementing ties with just about
every other ethnic group in one way or another. In 1988, the
88-year-old lawmaker ran without opposition.
   Battle lines are drawn again, however, with two Cuban-Americans
already in the race on the Republican side, state Sen. Ileana
Ros-Lehtinen and millionaire banana importer Carlos Perez, a
prominent supporter of former President Reagan and Lt. Col. Oliver
North.
   Among Democrats, state Sen. Jack Gordon, a one-time Claude Pepper
business partner who plans to get in the race this week,
acknowledges that his stand against Contra aid could be vexing. ``As
a matter of fact, the right-wing Cubans threw rocks and eggs at me''
at an anti-Contra demonstration, he says. He says he has a strategy
to counteract the problem that he will reveal this week.
   ``I think the chances are pretty good for a Cuban-American to be
elected,'' said Democratic strategist Sergio Bendixen.
   Already announced among Republicans are state Sen. Ileana
Ros-Lehtinen and millionaire banana importer Carlos Perez, a
high-profile supporter of former President Reagan and Lt. Col.
Oliver North.
   Also mentioned as a possible contenders was GOP state Sen. Al
Gutman. Democrats include Hialeah Mayor Raul Martinez Commissioner
Rosario Kennedy, Miami Beach Mayor Alex Daoud, Dade County
Commissioner Joe Gersten, State Attorney Janet Reno and former
school board chairman Paul Cejas.

   American burn experts flew to the Ural Mountains on
Sunday to treat hundreds of victims of a huge gas explosion that
engulfed two trains in flames. Official media said more than 400
people have now died in the tragedy.
   Authorities said the death toll likely would climb, especially if
severely burned patients do not receive immediate treatment.
   ``We are close to the most critical stage for patients,'' Russian
federation Health Minister A. Potapov told the government newspaper
Izvestia.
   Izvestia said only 32 of the 805 people hospitalized following
the June 4 blast had recovered sufficiently to be discharged while
another 114, including 28 children, had died.
   At the site of the huge explosion along the Trans-Siberian
Railway, 308 bodies, including the remains of 67 children, have been
found to date, the paper said. ``These are terrifying figures, but
they are not final,'' it said.
   Just one search party in which passengers' relatives took part
located the remains of three more victims Friday, Izvestia said.
   Previously, state-run media had said more than 190 of the
approximately 1,200 passengers aboard the trains were killed when a
spark from the railway's electrical line ignited a highly flammable
mixture of benzine and propane-butane gas that leaked from a
pipeline about a half mile away.
   The trains, traveling in opposite directions between Siberia's
largest city, Novosibirsk, and the Black Sea resort city of Adler,
had made unscheduled stops in the valley in the Ural Mountains. One
train was carrying schoolchildren to vacation camps in the southern
Soviet Union.
   The blast had the force of 10,000 tons of TNT, half as strong as
the A-bomb that fell on Hiroshima, said Gen. Mikhail Moiseyev, chief
of the Soviet military's general staff. But its true human costs are
only now becoming apparent.
   A government commission looking into the accident, which occurred
750 miles southeast of Moscow, concluded Sunday that ``the
dimensions of the June 3-4 railway tragedy are much broader than
supposed before,'' the Tass news agency reported from the Ural
Mountain city of Ufa.
   The commission said the number of passengers aboard the two
trains was greater than originally believed, but that even now it is
``impossible to cite excat numbers.
   ``Night and day in the hospitals of Ufa, the fight continues for
the lives of the injured,'' Tass added.
   A group of U.S. medics flew into Ufa on Sunday and headed
straight for the city's hospitals to begin helping accident victims,
Tass said. All the doctors are specialists in treating burns, and
the group brought its own drugs and equipment, Tass said.
   The 17-member team from the Institute of Surgical Research at
Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio, Texas, stopped Saturday
in West Germany on its way to the Soviet Union. The group's leader,
Lt. Col. William Becker, said the medics expected to remain in the
Soviet Union for up to 10 days.
   ``What we've been told is that there are more than 100 children
with serious burns and in addition to that, there are an unknown
number of adults with significant burns,'' Becker told The
Associated Press in Frankfurt.
   He said the group, responding to a request for aid from the
Soviets, was bringing 18,000 pounds of medical supplies on its giant
C-141 transport plane, as well as three Russian-language translators
and two administrative officers.
   State-run television reported last week that 50 percent of the
injured suffered burns over more than 70 percent of their bodies.
   Health Minister Yevgeny Chazov says Soviet doctors lack
experience in treating such severe burns, and the Soviets appealed
for advice and urgent airlifts of equipment from West Germany,
Italy, Japan and the United States.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and other officials have charged
that workers in charge of the pipeline noticed a drop in pressure
caused by the leak but increased pressure instead of shutting the
line down.
   KGB chief Vladimir Kryuchkov has told Izvestia the Soviet secret
police sent a team of investigators to the accident site to learn
what had happened.

<HEAD>East German Welcomes Bush Arms Plan, Cites New Berlin Wall Policy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of the East German government says
President Bush's proposal for a reduction in conventional arms in
Europe is a welcome step that is in tune with Warsaw Pact desires
for speedy negotiations, according to a published report.
   The Washington Post also quoted Erich Honecker in its Sunday
edition as confirming that East German border guards have been
ordered not to use deadly force to stop civilians who attempt to
flee into West Germany unless the soldiers are threatened themselves.
   In a two-hour interview conducted last Wednesday in East Berlin,
the Post quoted the influential Warsaw Pact leader as saying the
Bush proposal for NATO and Warsaw Pact nations to cut conventional
arms is ``close to our striving for radical conventional
disarmament.''
   Questioned on Bush's call to ``lock in'' reductions in tanks,
artillery, armed personnel carriers and other non-nuclear forces in
Vienna during a 23-nation negotiation on Conventional Forces in
Europe, the paper quoted Honecker as replying:
   ``We are interested in having those proposals included in the
negotiations, so that we can identify where the Warsaw Treaty states
concur (with NATO) and those areas where more intensive negotiations
are needed.''
   As to nuclear arms, he said, ``We are in favor of the
step-by-step elimination of tactical nuclear weapons in Europe. Of
course we know that this can't be done in one stroke.'' He raised
the possibility that each side might decide to ``keep, say, 10''
weapons.
   ``One has to enter negotiations and see what progress can be
achieved,'' said Honecker, who is head of state and general
secretary of the East German Communist Party. ``Sometimes surprises
even occur.''
   He rejected Bush's call for the Berlin Wall to be torn down, but
said his government wants ``to humanize the border regime'' as part
of generally improving relations with Western Europe and the United
States.
   Honecker said East German border guards are authorized to shoot
people trying to flee the country only if the guards are in physical
danger or if a soldier or other uniformed person is trying to desert.
   He did not say when the restrictions took effect, but Western
officials have said the policy apparently was adopted as a goodwill
gesture prior to Honecker's visit to West Germany in 1987.
   Although 190 people have died trying to flee East Germany since
the wall was built in 1961, there has been only one confirmed case
since the 1987 Honecker visit to West Berlin.

   The ``Hurricane Hotline'' will resume this year
when a storm threatens, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration announced Sunday.
   The hotline is a special telephone service providing regular
updates of the progress of named tropical storms and hurricanes. It
operates only when such a storm is active.
   Last year the hotline received more than 100,000 calls during
Hurricane Gilbert, and the year before 700,000 calls were recorded
when hurricanes Gloria and Elena threatened, officials said.
   The hotline number is 1-900-410-NOAA and calls cost 50 cents for
the first minute and 45 cents for each additional minute. Most calls
cost 95 cents, officials say.
   The hotline, which has a taped message, is operated by the
National Hurricane Center in Coral Gables, Fla., with assistance
from NBC News and USA Today.

   The government has moved to silence three top
dissidents who share a passion for democracy: an internationally
known astrophysicist, his college professor wife and a shaggy-haired
accountant.
   The Public Security Department issued an arrest warrant for
astrophysicist Fang Lizhi and his wife, Li Shuxian, who are hiding
in the U.S. Embassy in Beijing.
   Meanwhile, ABC News quoted Chinese sources as saying another
dissident, Ren Wanding, was arrested late Saturday.
   Fang, 53, is the most prominent dissident in China. He was
expelled from the Communist Party in 1987 on charges of having
helped provoke an earlier series of student pro-democracy
demonstrations.
   After his expulsion, Fang continued to condemn Marxism as a
failure and to urge democratic change in this authoritarian
Communist state. He also sent an open letter to Deng Xiaoping in
January calling for the release of political prisoners.
   ``Many people don't agree with Marxism, even workers and
students,'' he said in an interview with The Associated Press last
year. ``Even people of my generation ... don't believe in Marxism.''
   The Beijing Observatory professor was at the center of a
U.S.-Chinese controversy in February when Chinese police prevented
him from attending a banquet given by visiting U.S. President George
Bush.
   Although he kept a low profile during the recent student-led
demonstrations for democracy, Fang told The Associated Press just
before he disappeared into the U.S. Embassy that he feared he would
be arrested as part of a crackdown on liberal intellectuals.
   His wife is a professor of physics at Beijing University, the
country's most prestigious school, and also has criticized the lack
of democracy in China.
   She was elected a deputy to the People's Congress of Beijing's
Haidian district by Beijing University students.
   Ren Wanding does not have the international standing enjoyed by
Fang but nonetheless has waged a crusade for human rights and
democracy in China.
   Ren, 44, was jailed in 1979-83 after helping edit an underground
pro-democracy magazine. After a long silence, he renewed his call
for multi-party democracy late last year with an open letter to the
U.N. Human Rights Commission and a 22-page essay on freedom.
   After the recent pro-democracy movement began, he went to
universities and student-occupied Tiananmen Square to read his
essays on political reform. But Ren insisted he had no formal
connection with the student protesters.
   At a news conference two week ago, Ren told reporters he feared
arrest but defended his actions and speeches. ``I must speak,'' he
said. ``It is my fate to do such things.''

<HEAD>Hometowns, Seeking Tourism Boost, Commemorate Judy Garland, Clark
Gable</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By THEASA TUOHY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   It was a big weekend for 1939 movies with hometown folks
celebrating in the birthplaces of both Judy Garland and Clark Gable
to mark 50th anniversaries of the classics ``The Wizard of Oz'' and
``Gone With the Wind.''
   Talking trees from Oz paraded in Grand Rapids, Minn., Saturday,
and a barbecue in Cadiz, Ohio, re-created the lawn party at Twelve
Oaks, home of Ashley Wilkes, on the eve of the Civil War in ``GWTW.''
   No one seemed to pay much mind that neither Garland nor Gable
showed much interest in their tiny hometowns after shaking the dust
from their heels on their respective roads to Hollywood and stardom.
Folks in both towns are hoping that more hoopla about their famous
former residents will boost tourism.
   Garland, best known as as Dorthy in ``Oz,'' was born in Grand
Rapids as Frances Gumm. She who died in London in 1969 would have
been 67 Saturday.
   Gable was born Feb. 1, 1901, in Hopedale, Ohio, 10 miles from
Saturday's festivities, but a monument to the actor is in Cadiz
where he lived as a child. The gawky, big-eared boy never returned
to Harrison County after moving to Akron in 1917.
   Known as ``The King of Hollywood'' during his heyday, Gable
played the Confederate blockade-runner Rhett Butler in ``Gone With
the Wind,'' while Vivien Leigh played the Southern belle Scarlett
O'Hara.
   In Grand Rapids on Saturday, lawn chairs and strollers were
10-deep in some spots along the street for the Judy Garland Festival
parade. Fern Formica, who played a munchkin in ``Oz,'' was parade
grand marshal. One float featured the Wicked Witch of the West, the
talking trees with moving arms and even some flying monkeys.
   Lorelei Matten of Wrenshall, Minn., was the official Dorothy, and
a half-dozen unofficial ones could be seen along the parade route
wearing gingham jumpers and holding little black terriers or
whatever other dog was available as a Toto stand-in.
   Two of the youngest actors in ``Gone With the Wind'' attended the
Twelve Oaks barbecue in Cadiz _ Cammie King Conlon, who was Bonnie
Blue, the doomed child of Scarlett and Rhett; and Patrick Curtis,
who portrayed the infant son of Ashley and Melanie Wilkes. Fred
Crane, who played one of Scarlett's suitors, also was on hand.
   ``I got the role by default,'' Ms. Conlon recalled. ``My older
sister was cast for the part, but by the time the shooting began,
she was too old to play Bonnie Blue.''
   Curtis said he appeared in the film because Gable was a friend of
his father's. ``When I was older, he took me for a ride in his new
Jaguar,'' he said. ``That is the thoughtful kind of person he was.''
   Grand Rapids, which was renamed the Emerald City for the nine-day
festival that began Saturday, swelled to more than double its 8,000
residents as it celebrated one the world's most enduring films.
Hotel, motel and resort rooms were filled for miles around, city
tourism officials said.
   ``One old fellow from Boston said he's seen everything Judy's
ever done,'' said Elaine Erven, who staffed a tourist information
booth in town. ``He even went to her funeral. He said he wouldn't
have missed this.''
   Garland paraphernalia was everywhere, including hats, balloons,
stickers, pins, T-shirts and post cards emblazoned with Dorothy,
Toto and the rest of the Oz characters.
   ``I love her charisma, her windows to her soul,'' said Garland
fan Laurie Savran of Minneapolis. ``You can read her so well. The
pain. The struggles of her life.''
   Not everyone had joined the fan club, though.
   ``I think it's kind of stupid,'' said Jennifer Gaustad, a
17-year-old Grand Rapids High School student. ``She hated Grand
Rapids. She said she didn't want to admit being born here. She
wanted to get out of here as fast as possible.''
   Garland left the area with her family when she was 4 years old
and returned only once, in March 1938.

<HEAD>AT&amp;T Pact In Hand, Unions Open Talks With Baby Bells</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two unions and the seven so-called Baby Bells
spawned by the 1984 AT&amp;T breakup begin contract talks this month, a
splintered and complex process affecting more than 350,000 workers
in 48 states and the District of Columbia.
   Across the tables from unions at negotiations in seven cities
will be representatives from the highly profitable regional phone
companies, several of which were hit by strikes three years ago in
their first post-divestiture negotiations.
   ``Both sides had problems in 1986,'' Communications Workers of
America President Morton Bahr said in an interview last week.
``There was no blueprint. There were people involved who had never
negotiated a contract before.''
   The unions, CWA and the International Brotherhood of Electrical
Workers, say the blueprint for this year's talks is the recent
agreement they reached with American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.,
which includes wage and pension increases, a profit-sharing plan and
an innovative package of benefits dealing with parental and elder
care leaves and child care.
   Spokesmen for the regional phone companies, however, say they do
not feel obligated to match the AT&amp;T contract.
   ``We'd be reluctant to acknowledge that any patterns have been
set,'' said NYNEX spokesman Robert O'Brien. ``Things will vary from
one region of the country to another and I don't think we want to be
locked into any feeling that a pattern has been set. We want to
start at the beginning.''
   Added BellSouth's Terry Johnson: ``We are different companies
facing different circumstances and what AT&amp;T and the CWA doe is
between that company and those union members. Ours is a completely
different situation as far as we are concerned.''
   Nonetheless, AT&amp;T briefed officials representing all of the
regional companies last week.
   For NYNEX, parent company for the local phone service providers
in New York and most of New England, the beginning of the talks is
Tuesday, the same day the unions first sit down for formal
negotiations with US West, which provides service to 14 states in
the Midwest and West, and Pacific Telesis, which serves Nevada and
California.
   Talks between the unions and two of the companies begin Monday.
They are Ameritech, parent company of local phone companies in
Indiana, Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin; and BellSouth, which serves
nine southeastern states.
   Negotiations with Bell Atlantic, which serves six Mid-Atlantic
states and the District of Columbia, open on June 19 and the final
Baby Bell, Southwestern Bell, which serves Arkansas, Kansas,
Missouri, Oklahoma and Texas, will open formal negotiations June 26.
   Four of the contracts expire Aug. 5; the others Aug. 12, except
for Ameritech's Illinois Bell, which faces a July 1 deadline and has
already begun negotiations.
   Parts of NYNEX, US West and Ameritech were struck in 1986. Bahr
said the unions were making preparations for strikes this year as
well but said he was optimistic settlements would be reached by the
deadlines.
   CWA represents all but 32,000 of the 352,000 union workers at the
seven companies, with IBEW representing the others.
   The unions have a nationwide agenda that will dominate all of the
talks, but there are a number of local issues as well.
   The national issues will mirror those in the AT&amp;T talks, with
health insurance again likely to emerge as the major hurdle to
settlements.
   Bahr identified NYNEX and Pacific Telesis as the companies with
which he expected the greatest fight over health insurance.
Ameritech, BellSouth and Southwestern Bell already have in place
many of the cost-containment measures that were inserted into the
recent AT&amp;T agreement.
   The unions also want all of the companies to offer profit
sharing; some now offer performance-related bonuses but the unions
say they are inadequate.
   Another provision of the AT&amp;T contract the unions will be seeking
in the regional talks is company participation in a lobbying effort
designed to curb rising health care costs through revisions in
federal policy.
   Bahr said he was optimistic the companies would sign on, but said
the larger problem will be getting them, major employers from other
industries, lawmakers and interest groups to reach consensus on a
strategy.
   As for local issues, disputes over job titles and use of outside
contracts likely will surface at all of the regional talks. NYNEX is
the only one of the Baby Bells still offering cost of living
adjustments to its workers and any attempt by the company to
eliminate those would be meet heavy resistance from union
negotiators.

   Companies are handing out $5,000
checks, paying hotel bills and promising more help for people whose
low-income neighborhood was ravaged by a runaway train and exploding
pipeline.
   But many furious survivors are afraid to return home, and worry
they won't recover their losses, particularly less-tangible losses
like a drop in property values.
   ``I don't like the neighborhood any more. There's not much of it
left,'' said plumber Mark Kingston, 30.
   Kingston lived 1{ blocks from the row of Duffy Street homes
demolished one month ago Monday when an overloaded freight train
speeding down from Cajon Pass at 90 mph derailed on a curve.
   After the wreck, Calnev Pipe Line Co. inspected its 14-inch
pipeline buried next to the Southern Pacific tracks, and assured
residents they could safely return home. The 250-mile pipeline
provides 90 percent of Las Vegas' gasoline and supplies three Air
Force bases with gasoline, diesel and jet fuel.
   But on May 25, the pipeline ruptured, spewing gasoline that
exploded in a fireball and engulfed homes spared by the train wreck.
   The toll of the twin disasters: six people dead, 42 injured, 800
to 1,000 evacuated, and at least 22 homes destroyed, significantly
damaged or considered unsafe to reoccupy.
   Trains are running again. After failed legal efforts by the city
and residents, gasoline resumed flowing Friday through the repaired
and reinforced 600-foot section of pipe.
   Southern Pacific Transportation Co., Calnev and government
officials again are telling residents of the roughly 200 homes in
the subdivision that it's safe to go home.
   ``This is probably the most looked at and examined pipeline in
the United States,'' Calnev spokesman Richard Kline said.
   ``I would not hesitate moving back into this neighborhood,'' said
Anthony Andrukaitis, vice president of Chicago-based GATX Terminals
Corp., Calnev's parent company.
   ``They told us that after the derailment,'' said Duffy Street
resident Paul Evans Jr., 21. ``Everybody believed it and moved back
in. And what happens? It blows up after they say they checked it.
They messed up and I'm never going by their word again.''
   Police Sgt. George Finkle estimated that by Sunday, only 40
percent of the evacuated residents had returned.
   ``We deeply regret that this occurred,'' Andrukaitis said. ``The
only thing Calnev can do is everything in its power to work with the
citizens and elected officials to get them back to where they were.''
   Calnev and Southern Pacific agreed to pay the city's costs, and
buy the 22 homes, most of which have been razed. They are footing
hotel and restaurant bills until Monday for evacuees from undamaged
homes.
   The companies distributed dozens of $5,000 checks to heads of
evacuated households. Recipients still can sue.
   Andrukaitis and Southern Pacific claims manager Floyd Parker
estimate the companies will spend tens of millions of dollars.
   Southern Pacific accepted full blame for the derailment. The
National Transportation Safety Board is investigating Calnev's
post-derailment pipeline inspection, and whether the pipeline was
dented or cracked by the train wreck.
   Calnev acknowledged it visually inspected only portions of the
pipe.
   Duffy Street residents like Dwight Pledger believe another
derailment is possible.
   ``We can't go back _ the fear, the apprehension and anxiety,''
said the 36-year-old real estate agent. ``I've got to make mortgage
payments on a place I can't even live in. Real estate values are
just gone. They ought to clear the whole area.''
   ``We're not going to buy the whole neighborhood,'' Parker
replied. Southern Pacific lawyer Douglas Stephenson said the
railroad and Calnev will establish a panel of retired judges to
arbitrate claims by residents who say their property values
plummeted.
   Stephenson predicted most claims will be settled without
lawsuits. Parker said residents soon will realize ``we really are
intending to right as much of the problem as is possible.''
   That's not good enough for many.
   ``It was a nice neighborhood,'' said retiree Jack Samuels. ``It
was quiet, and we could let our kids run loose.''
   ``Now,'' said Angela Kingston, 19, ``we've got to worry about
them blowing up.''

<HEAD>Rebels Claim to Kill Afghan Colonel in Road Ambush</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Moslem rebels said Sunday they
ambushed and killed an Afghan army colonel and nine soldiers on the
main road linking Afghanistan's capital and the besieged eastern
city of Jalalabad.
   The Soviet news agency Tass, meanwhile, said guerrillas launched
another attack on Jalalabad during the weekend with rockets and
artillery, killing 10 people and injuring 16. It said ``considerable
damage was done to the city'' and that the cities of Herat and
Gardiz also were under fire.
   Insurgents, known as the mujahedeen or Islamic Holy Warriors,
ambushed three government convoys on Wednesday and Thursday along a
40-mile stretch of the road linking Jalalabad and Kabul, the rebel
Afghan News Agency said.
   The agency said 10 soldiers were killed, including a colonel, and
27 were wounded. One officer deserted to the mujahedeen, the agency
said.
   Qaribur Rehman Saeed, head of the news agency, said he did not
know the colonel's identity. There was no independent confirmation
of the attack.
   The mujahedeen, backed principally by Pakistan and the United
States, have besieged Jalalabad since March 6, three weeks after
Soviet troops ended nine years of intervention on behalf of the
communist regime.
   The guerrillas have rendered the communist-held airport unsafe
but supplies have been dropped by air to government forces. A few
armored convoys have fought their way through from the west.
   The guerrilla news agency said 51 communist soldiers have died
and 54 have been wounded in fighting around Afghanistan since June 7.
   The Tass report said that the Afghan air force attacked enemy
positions outside Jalalabad, killing 270 guerrillas. It claimed 12
were Pakistani military personnel.
   The Soviet Union has accused Pakistan of aiding the rebels and
violating the accord that resulted in the withdrawal of Soviet
troops from the country. Pakistan has denied that its troops have
aided the guerrillas.
   Meanwhile, two of the most powerful mujahedeen groups, the
Jamiat-i-Islami of Burhanuddin Rabbani and the Hezb-i-Islami of
Gulbaddin Hekmatyar, both based in Pakistan, denied claims by the
Kabul government that guerrilla commanders approached the communists
for a truce.
   ``The regime's claims that the mujahedeen commanders have
contacted them is based on fabrication and falsehood ... ,'' they
said in a joint statement.
   They said it was a ploy by Afghan President Najib to sow discord
among rebel groups.
   ``The writing on the wall is clear _ the puppet regime's days are
numbered,'' the statement said.
   Guerrilla leaders predicted the ruling People's Democratic Party
of Afghanistan would fall quickly after the Soviet troop withdrawal.
But Najib has cited his forces' tenacious defense of Jalalabad as
proof that his government has the power to survive.
   He has offered repeated deals to the rebels to end the fighting
and recently launched a propaganda campaign indicating the
insurgents were pressing for peace.
   But guerrilla leaders, who want to establish an Islamic republic
in Afghanistan, have rejected overtures from Kabul.
   Afghanistan's ruling party seized power in a 1978 military coup,
sparking the Moslem insurgency.

   Hundreds of protesters and even some police
officers wept as two Chinese diplomats made a surprise and emotional
public appeal for political asylum, and rally organizers Sunday
predicted more defections.
   ``Many of my friends have lost their lives and we wanted to do
something to show we support what they stood for,'' said one of the
diplomats during a rally Saturday night against China's repression
of the pro-democracy movement.
   ``Compared to them, I am not brave at all,'' added the man, who
was not immediately identified. ``They are brave for standing up for
democracy in the face of death or imprisonment.''
   The two men, identified as a vice consul for cultural affairs and
an overseas affairs officer, told the crowd of 5,000 they decided to
defect after Beijing leaders launched a propaganda campaign claiming
no citizens died in the clash.
   Chinese troops opened fire on tens of thousands of students and
Beijing residents June 4 to put an end to the seven-week
pro-democracy movement and the sit-in at the city's Tiananmen
Square. U.S. intelligence estimates put the number of people slain
in the hundreds and possibly the thousands.
   ``We are supposed to tell you that no one was injured or killed.
Why? Because we are diplomats. But we won't fake it here. Before we
are diplomats, we are Chinese and we are human beings,'' one of the
men told the crowd.
   ``We are public servants, we are not slaves,'' he added.
   The whereabouts of the diplomats Sunday were not immediately
known.
   The FBI would not release their names but confirmed the two
requested political asylum. A bureau spokeswoman Sunday said only
that their case would be handled by the Immigration and
Naturalization Service.
   A staffer in the office of David Ilchert, INS regional director,
said Sunday morning the two had not filed an asylum request. He
would not give his name.
   To obtain political asylum, an applicant must show a well-founded
fear of persecution in their homeland.
   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Daria Novak said the
department had no immediate comment on the situation.
   Telephone calls to the Chinese consulate went unanswered.
   Organizers at the rally and candlelight memorial said at first
they refused to allow the consulate officials to address the crowd
outside City Hall. Even later, when event organizers were convinced
of their sincerity, three people were posted alongside the diplomats
on stage to yank them off in case of trouble.
   ``We didn't know if they'd start a riot or what, and it was a
complete surprise for everyone when they said what they did,'' said
Humphrey Wou, a member of the Chinese Christian Mission, one of the
sponsors of the rally.
   ``But then we were ecstatic and everybody was hugging them and
crying and saying that they were true Chinese and very, very
brave,'' Wou said. He said he saw several police officers weeping
after the announcement.
   Wou and other rally organizers predicted there would be other
defections from Chinese consulates in the United States.
   ``We are encouraging this sort of thing to happen and expect more
people to come out of these consulates to freedom,'' said Steve Lu,
general coordinator of San Francisco-based Support Democracy in
China. However, Wou said he expects most Chinese students eventually
to return home to support the pro-democracy cause.
   Lee Man-kar, an editor at San Francisco's Chinese Times, on
Sunday identified the two from their business cards as Zhou Li-ming,
26, vice consul for cultural affairs, and Zhang Li-man, 25, acting
consul for overseas affairs. He said both had been in the United
States for 2{ years and were unmarried.
   He estimated that the total number of Chinese staff members and
dependents at the consulate was 300 to 400.
   Wou said the diplomats told him they had walked to the rally
after finishing dinner at the Chinese Consulate, about a half-mile
away. On the way, they stopped at a public telephone and called the
FBI, which escorted them to an undisclosed location from the rally.
   The defections were announced in Chinese and English at the
protest, where a largely Asian crowd denounced the Beijing
government. Many wore black arm bands and carried banners reading
``Their blood, Our tears.''

   The first Gadhafi international human rights prize
was awarded Sunday to Nelson Mandela, the jailed South African
anti-apartheid leader, the Libyan news agency JANA reported.
   The award was presented in Tripoli to Mandela's daughter, Zenani,
JANA said in a report monitored in Rome. A ceremony celebrating the
event was also held Saturday night, the agency said.
   Ms. Mandela was quoted as telling Libyan radio that the prize was
``a further impetus for all freedom fighters.''
   Her 70-year-old father, leader of the outlawed African National
Congress, has been in jail for more than two decades for leading the
fight against South African's racial segregation system.
   The winner of the prize, named after Libyan leader Moammar
Gadhafi, was chosen by an ``international people's committee,'' JANA
said, without identifying its members.

   France detonated its fourth
underground nuclear bomb this year in the South Pacific, New Zealand
government scientists said Sunday.
   The explosion of about 70 kilotons occurred Saturday at Fangatau
atoll in French Polynesia, said Warwick Smith of the Department of
Industrial and Scientific Research.
   It brings to 107 the number of underground tests Paris has
conducted since it began nuclear tests in the region in 1975, Smith
said.
   This year the French exploded an 11-kiloton bomb on May 11, a
two-kiloton bomb on May 20 and one of 20 kilotons on June 4. One
kiloton is equivalent to blasting 1,000 tons of TNT.
   New Zealand and other South Pacific nations question the safety
of the tests and argue they escalate the arms race.
   France refuses to confirm reports of nuclear testing.

   After industrialist Armand Hammer decided not
to give his $250 million art collection to the Los Angeles County
Museum of Art, its trustees decided they don't want the 21-year
member on the board anymore.
   Hammer's term will expire June 30, following the board's refusal
last week to renew Hammer's trusteeship, said Museum board president
Daniel Belin. The chairman of Occidental Petroleum Corp. has been a
board member since 1968.
   Hammer, 91, dashed expectations in January 1988 by announcing he
would not be donating his collection of Old Master and 19th century
paintings to the museum. He had insisted that his collection be
housed in its own wing, separate from the museum's existing
collection and overseen by a separate curator, Belin and others said.
   ``That was unacceptable,'' Belin said.
   Hammer subsequently decided to house his art in a private museum
to be built in Westwood for at least $86 million. Several Occidental
shareholders have filed a lawsuit trying to block the plan, claiming
it is a waste of corporate assets without significant benefit to the
company.

   Actor Clint Eastwood said Sunday that he
hoped his first African film venture will encourage the conservation
of wild animals, particularly the African elephant.
   The movie will criticize the obsessional hunting of big game
animals for ivory or souvenirs, Eastwood said.
   ``I think it is better in the long run run to have animals alive
than dead trinkets,'' he said. ``I personally will not buy ivory for
this reason.''
   Eastwood arrived in Zimbabwe from France late Saturday and was
scheduled to travel 240 miles to the remote town of Kariba to begin
filming ``White Hunter, Black Heart'' on Tuesday.
   He is producer, director and star of the movie based on Peter
Viertel's novel set in Africa during the filming of director John
Huston's classic ``The African Queen.''
   Marco Barla, spokesman for Eastwood's Malpaso production company,
said the movie depicts the obsession of fictional movie director
John Wilson, based on Huston, with the African bush and his desire
to kill an elephant in its bush habitat.
   ``We are making an anti-hunting statement,'' Barla said.

   Actress Goldie Hawn will start building her
country-style mansion in Pacific Palisades after more than a year of
planning.
   Construction of the 10,000 square-foot residence in the coastal
suburb, 20 miles west of downtown Los Angeles, will take about 15
months.
   Miss Hawn, star of such films as ``Cactus Flower'' and ``Private
Benjamin,'' paid $2.1 million in April 1988 for the property, and
then demolished the existing house, according to Readysystems Group
in Burbank.
   She is currently in Canada filming ``Bird on a Wire'' with
co-star Mel Gibson.

   During a visit to Myrtle Beach, Oliver
North was just like any other tourist.
   The retired Marine colonel took a spin at amusement-park rides,
went to see the new Indiana Jones movie and caught King mackerel
while deep-sea fishing here last week.
   ``People would ask him if he was going to run for president,''
said Russell Holliday, co-owner of the beach house where North and
his family stayed. ``He would laugh and say right now he was real
busy running for husband and father.''
   ``He said this was the most relaxed he has been in many, many
months,'' Ms. Holliday said. ``They needed to get away. They had a
normal vacation. They sat on the beach, and they had suntans. They
had a great time despite the weather.''
   His wife Betsy, two of their children and a security guard
accompanied North.
   A federal court recently found North guilty of three of 12 felony
counts for his role in the Iran-Contra affair. Sentencing has been
set for June 23.

   If Judge Joseph A. Wapner of television's ``The
People's Court'' wants to hear small claims cases in this historic
city, court officials say he can go right ahead and help himself.
   The television show, which features the retired judge arbitrating
real disputes in California, is on the road this year taping the
courtroom show in other cities.
   Producer Jim Crum approached Chief Justice William J. Tierney of
the Municipal Court about opening up small claims files to the
show's researchers and a courtroom to the show's star.
   Tierney, in a recent letter to Crum, said the court would be
pleased to cooperate.
   The old Suffolk County courthouse, where the Boston Municipal
Court's small claims section is located, was built 103 years ago and
is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
   After researchers find some interesting suits, Crum said, the
litigants would be contacted to see whether they want to have Wapner
settle their claims, instead of pursuing them in the real courts.

   Filming of ``Dances With Wolves,''
starring Kevin Costner, is set to begin July 17, according to a
South Dakota stockbroker who said he persuaded the film company to
come here instead of Nebraska.
   The movie, which will be Costner's debut as a director, is to be
shot primarily near Fort Pierre and north of Rapid City along the
Belle Fourche River, said Guy Edwards.
   Edwards helped persuade Costner and the movie's producers to film
in the Rapid City area instead of going to Valentine, Neb., where
most of the film was to have been shot. He has since helped the
actor and the film company prepare for two months of shooting in
western South Dakota.
   ``Costner will visit Rapid City one more time sometime next week
to finalize a few things,'' Edwards said last week. ``He'll be here
a day or two before heading to Pierre to finish up things there
before shooting begins.''
   The movie takes place in 1863 and revolves around the character
played by Costner, Lt. John Dunbar, and his experiences with members
of a plains Indian tribe.
   Costner's most recent movie is ``Field of Dreams.''

   In an odd way, Indianapolis art dealer Peg
Goldberg feels honored.
   ``Very few people in the United States have had the privilege of
being sued not only by a country, but by a religion,'' Goldberg said
following the conclusion of a six-day civil trial in U.S. District
Court last week.
   The Republic of Cyprus and the Autocephalous Greek Orthodox
Church of Cyprus are demanding the return of four sixth-century
Christian mosaics. Taken from a church in northern Cyprus in 1979,
the works were purchased by Goldberg last summer.
   Goldberg says she fell in love with the rare Byzantine pieces and
purchased them for $1.1 million only after her investigation turned
up no evidence they had been reported stolen. She later offered them
for sale for $20 million, but they are off the market pending the
outcome of the lawsuit.
   Judge James E. Noland's decision, which is not expected until
August at the earliest, could rest on two legal questions:
   _Did Goldberg act recklessly and hastily when she purchased the
mosaics during a four-day visit to Switzerland in July?
   _Did Cyprus diligently seek the return of the mosaics and try to
notify the international art community after it learned the works
were stolen in 1979?
   At stake are not only the ``spiritual treasures'' of one of the
earliest Christian religions, but also the status of antiquities in
United States museums and around the world, analysts say.
   Goldberg's actions were criticized in testimony from three
witnesses: a Harvard University law professor and curators at the J.
Paul Getty Museum in Malibu, Calif., and Walters Art Gallery in
Baltimore, Md.
   Gary Vikan of the Baltimore gallery said the objects,
circumstances and people involved in Goldberg's purchase should have
warned her away.
   Among those who brought Goldberg into the deal were an
Indianapolis art dealer who has used three names and a Dutchman who
has been convicted of art forgery in France, court records show.
   The Dutchman, Michel van Rijn, is well-known as a ``shady
dealer'' who markets stolen art, Vikan testified. But Goldberg
testified she liked van Rijn and he seemed to have universal respect
in Amsterdam.
   ``There wasn't anyplace that we went that somebody didn't come
out of a shop and say, `Hi, Michel,''' she said. ``We were always
bumping into people he would chat with and introduce me to.''
   The roughly 2-foot-square mosaics _ which depict the heads of
Jesus as a boy, the apostles James and Matthew and an archangel _
were taken from a war-torn area of northern Cyprus under control of
a breakaway Turkish state recognized only by Turkey.
   Vikan testified he would have walked away from the purchase.
   New York art dealer Andre Emmerich, a former president of the Art
Dealers Association of America, said he might have gone ahead.
   ``When confronted by a really major work of art, and it's
perfectly clear the piece is authentic and of unequaled quality, I
might well have proceeded the same way. My God, yes,'' Emmerich
testified on Goldberg's behalf.
   Emmerich also testified he felt Goldberg had left ``no stone
unturned'' in her investigation.
   ``I think her inquiry met the best professional standards,''
Emmerich said. ``I couldn't have expected more.''
   Goldberg seemed incredulous at the suggestion she would sacrifice
her business and the livelihood of her partner, George Feldman, by
purchasing stolen artwork.
   ``Who in their right mind can imagine that we would borrow one
million dollars to buy stolen property?'' she said.
   Goldberg's attorneys tried to prove Cyprus gave up claim to the
mosaics when Greek Cypriots fled the village of Lythrankomi in 1976,
leaving the church and its mosaics unattended. Turkish forces had
taken control of the area, stifling the rights of Greek citizens,
Greek Cypriots testified.
   ``Did, in fact, southern Cyprus have a right to lay claim to
something in northern Cyprus?'' Goldberg asked.
   Six Greek Cypriot officials testified how they tried to recover
the mosaics against political and bureaucratic roadblocks erected by
the division of their country.
   They said they notified museums and agencies of the theft, issued
press releases and sent representatives to speak about stolen
Cypriot antiquities at international art conferences.
   However, none of them could say they had notified Interpol, an
international police agency, or tried to pursue Aydin Dikmen, the
Turk who sold the mosaics to Goldberg and who had been publicly
linked to the mosaics in 1982.

   One of every four U.S. households was the
target of a violent crime or theft in 1988, the same proportion as
the previous three years, the Justice Department said Sunday.
   This proportion remained at the lowest level since the Bureau of
Justice Statistics began calculating the household rate in 1975.
That year, almost one in three households was the target of a
violent crime.
   ``In 1988, 27 percent of households with incomes of $25,000 or
more, 29 percent of black households and 30 percent of urban
households were touched by crime,'' the report found, adding that
Hispanic households remained more vulnerable to crime than
non-Hispanic households.
   Geographically, households in the Northeast were the least
vulnerable to crime, with 19 percent hit, while those in the West
suffered the most with 30.3 percent. About 24.9 percent of
Midwestern households and 24.4 percent of Southern households were
hit, the report found.
   The report, based on the National Crime Survey, covered 92.9
million households and found that 22.8 million experienced a theft
or burglary or had a member who was raped, robbed or assaulted.
   The Bureau of Justice Statistics does not include murders in the
survey because it relies on a polling technique based on what the
crime victim says and then estimates a total amount of crime
nationwide.
   Murder statistics would not change the overall figures for
household crimes, the bureau said. Other crimes not measured by the
crime survey include kidnapping and arson.
   Overall, members of about 141,000 households were raped, 872,000
were robbed and 3.7 million were assaulted, and the bureau found a
total of 7.19 million households, or one in 13, were targeted by
crimes of ``high concern,'' including rape, robbery, assault by a
stranger or a burglar.
   Black households, 29 percent of which were touched by crime, were
significantly more vulnerable to crime than white households, of
which 23.9 percent were targeted, the bureau found.
   In addition, black households were more likely than white
households, if victimized, to be victimized by a serious violent
crime or a crime of high concern, the report said.
   A total of 16 percent of the black households touched by crime in
1988 had a member suffer a rape, robbery or aggravated assault,
while 9 percent of white households had a member who suffered from
one of those crimes, according to the study.
   The bureau, in trying to explain the overall downward trend in
the households-touched-by-crime indicator since 1975, said
``population movements and changes in household composition
undoubtedly affected'' it.
   In addition to a movement away from the Northeast and Midwest in
the South and West as well as away from urban areas into suburban
and rural areas, the report noted that the average American
household decreased in size during the 1975-88 period.
   ``One-person households represented 21 percent of all households
in 1975 but 25 percent in 1988,'' which the percentage of households
containing six or more people fell from 7 percent to 3 percent, the
report said.
   If a household contains more people, it is more vulnerable to
crime, particularly for personal crimes since larger households have
more members at risk, the study said.

<HEAD>Agreement Seems Near on Early Exit for Alfonsin</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ED McCULLOUGH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President-elect Carlos Menem will
assume power several months ahead of schedule in an agreement being
worked out with Argentina's lame-duck leader, Raul Alfonsin,
officials said Sunday.
   The arrangement would allow Menem to begin tackling the nation's
crippling economic problems sometime this summer, rather than wait
until December, when he is scheduled to take over from President
Alfonsin.
   ``I have no doubt he doesn't want to stay until Dec. 10,'' Juan
Manuel Casella, an official of the governing Radical Civic Union,
said of Alfonsin. ``There will be an accord shortly.''
   Casella was the governing party candidate for vice president in
the May 14 elections, which were won by Menem of the Peronist Party.
   Under the constitution, Menem is scheduled to take office on Dec.
10.
   But with the economy in chaos and food riots in early June that
left 14 dead, many people have called on Alfonsin to step aside
sooner.
   Although no date was set in weekend talks between the two main
parties, Alfonsin might hand over power in the first half of August,
said Eduardo Menem, the senate president and a key adviser to his
older brother.
   President-elect Menem has said he won't push Alfonsin to step
down early. But last week, after he appointed a Cabinet and fleshed
out an economic plan, the Peronist said he was prepared to take
power any time.
   Shortly after the Peronist election landslide, Alfonsin offered
to step down early, but he could not agree with Menem on terms. The
main differences were over economic policies and how Alfonsin could
leave office without resigning.
   Menem also insisted that Peronist congressmen who won election
with him take office when he does and that the trials of military
officers charged with human rights abuse during the 1976-83
dictatorship be resolved by Alfonsin.
   The military ``situation stems from the current government and I
consider it convenient that the answer and the solution be granted
by this government,'' Menem said.
   In an apparent solution worked out over the weekend, the
Electoral College would meet early to confirm Menem's victory and
Congress would modify the law that sets the transition day. That
would allow Alfonsin to step down without resigning.
   In addition, Radical Civic Union congressmen would agree to
support whatever legislation Menem deemed necessary to stabilize the
economy, which has soared out of control under Alfonsin.
   Hyperinflation, economic recession and high unemployment caused
food riots in which Argentines looted supermarkets and grocery
stores. Alfonsin declared a nationwide state of siege.
   Alfonsin has tried to cut the budget deficit _ a main cause of
inflation _ by cutting government spending and raising tariffs for
public services. The measures, coupled with inflation expected to
reach 70 percent this month, have torn into pocketbooks and prompted
cries for Alfonsin to leave office early.
   Menem has said the higher rates are ``anti-popular.''
   Measures reportedly being developed by the economy
minister-designate, Miguel Roig, include an across-the-board wage
raise, easy access to Central Bank credit, and a new currency to
replace the austral.
   It was unclear how the military issue, which has brought on three
insurrections against Alfonsin, would be resolved.
   Alfonsin took office in December 1983 for a six-year term after
elections that ended rule by military dictators since 1976. He was
barred by the consitution from seeking re-election.

<HEAD>Two Million Flock to Khomeini Memorial Service</HEAD>

   Two Iranians died and thousands fainted as
huge crowds flocked to the grave of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini on
Sunday for a memorial service marking a week since his death.
   Iran's most powerful leaders were among the more than 1 million
mourners at Beheshte Zahra cemetery, 10 miles south of Tehran,
according to Iranian press reports monitored in Nicosia.
   ``Soon this site will become a shrine to attract the Moslems of
the world,'' said Parliament speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani, who broke
into tears during his speech. ``This is a center which radiates
heavenly light.''
   In Islam, the seventh and 40th days after death are considered a
time for special mourning rites. Free food and drink was distributed
around the grave.
   Iran's state-run television showed mourners beating their heads
and chests with clenched fists in the Shiite Moslem expression of
grief and chanting ``Khomeini, Khomeini, why did you leave us?''
   But the atmosphere appeared calmer than during Tuesday's burial,
which was delayed for six hours after some in the hysterical crowd
of 2 million tore pieces from Khomeini's white shroud and sent the
body falling to the ground.
   The 86-year-old patriarch died June 3 after suffering a heart
attack. There were eight deaths and 11,000 injuries in subsequent
three days of mourning.
   On Sunday, one man died of a heart attack and another died after
falling from a cargo container used for television cameras,
according to press reports.
   The official Islamic Republic News Agency said the mourners were
so densely packed during the afternoon ceremony that on average one
person fainted every second in temperatures around 96.
   The sick were passed overhand to one of 23 mobile medical units
stationed around the site and more than 1,000 doctors and medical
workers were on duty, the news agency reported. More serious
injuries were rushed to nearby hospitals in one of 250 ambulances.
   The television, also monitored in Nicosia, showed a shrine built
from four metal cargo containers to stop crowds from carrying off
the dirt. The containers were covered in green, a holy color for
Islam, and were topped with a golden dome and a black flag.
   The television showed weeping mourners gripping a metal grille
built around the structure, trying to touch and kiss the shrine,
which they consider sacred.
   Those unable to reach it threw clothes and other articles to the
guards standing on top the containers. The guards touched them to
the shrine and threw them back.
   ``It would take a stone heart to stay composed at such a time,''
Rafsanjani said in his speech. Khomeini's 43-year-old son, Ahmad,
was reported too overcome to speak.
   A crop-dusting plane sprayed rosewater on the mourners, and
helicopters circled overhead, showering the crowds with flowers.
   The agency said crowds began collecting at the grave site on
Saturday night and swelled to almost 2 miles wide. There were
unprecedented traffic jams on the expressway leading to the cemetery.
   In a related development, Iranian opposition leaders said exiled
Iranians living in the United States and Europe have flocked to
rebel training camps, reopened after the death of Khomeini, a
guerrilla spokesman said Sunday.
   The National Liberation Army, the armed wing of the Baghdad-based
Mujahedeen Khalq, received many new supporters in the past week and
sent them to camps on the Iraq-Iran border, according to spokesman
Farid Suliamani.
   The camps were closed after the Aug. 20 U.N.-mediated cease-fire
in the eight-year Iran-Iraq war then reopened in a show of strength
following Khomeini's death, according to diplomatic sources. They
said, however, there was no indication the rebels would attack Iran
in violation of the cease-fire.
   The rebels fought alongside Iraq in the gulf war.

<TEXT>
   The Department of Veterans Affairs has awarded
US Sprint and Science Applications International Corp. an $84
million contract to build a data network linking VA offices and
medical facilities nationwide, according to Telenet, a Sprint
subsidiary that designed the system.
   San Diego-based SAIC is the prime contractor and will provide
computer software and management systems for the ``integrated data
communications utility,'' while US Sprint will provide network,
office and transmission equipment, Reston, Va.-based Telenet
Communications Corp. said Friday.
   The new system will serve 377 geographic locations, including the
172 VA medical centers, when it is fully installed in about two
years.
   The network will replace the VA's data transmission systems and
its benefits delivery system, which serve about 80 million veterans,
dependents and survivors of deceased veterans, Telenet said.
   ``At a cost to VA of just over $84 million over 10 years, the
IDCU will increase efficiency and result in cost savings to the VA
by enabling it to take advantage of new technology and new, lower
circuit rates,'' Telenet said.

<HEAD>U.S. Ambassador Sees Bright Future For Hungary ... Unless</HEAD>

   With accelerating economic reform and political
liberalization, Hungary could emerge as a ``Western country'' within
the next decade, the U.S. ambassador to Budapest said Sunday.
   At the same time, Ambassador Mark Palmer cautioned that under
certain conditions the Soviet Union might again use military force
to reassert its control in Hungary or elsewhere in Eastern Europe.
   ``I think the Brezhnev Doctrine is not dead, that there are
circumstances under which the Soviets would intervene,'' he said.
``Hungary's a little less of a concern to them, I would say, than
the militarily more important countries of East Germany,
Czechoslovakia and Poland, but I would not rule out the possibility
of their intervening again.''
   Under the Brezhnev Doctrine, named for late Soviet President
Leonid I. Brezhnev, Moscow reserved the right to intervene _ as it
did in Hungary in 1956 and in Czechoslovakia in 1968 _ to preserve
communist regimes in Eastern Europe.
   Palmer, interviewed on the ABC program ``This Week With David
Brinkley,'' was asked about the longer-term prospects for Hungary,
which recently began taking down its ``Iron Curtain'' barbed wire
and fortifications along its border with Austria.
   The envoy said the outlook depends partly on what the United
States and other Western nations do.
   ``If we come into these countries with our political parties, our
trade unions, with our ideas, our values and our institutions, our
churches, our universities, our foundations, I think there's a real
chance that what you will see 10 years from today in Hungary is a
Western country,'' Palmer said.
   Also interviewed on the program was John Davis, U.S. ambassador
to Poland, where candidates backed by the Solidarity movement won a
resounding victory in parliamentary elections last week.
   Davis was asked whether Solidarity would now be a permanent
political force in Poland, or could be suppressed again in a way
comparable to the martial law crackdown in 1981.
   ``I think it's back to stay,'' he replied.
   Davis added: ``I think that Solidarity has proved through its
nonviolence, its responsible attitude and its willingness to share
power in the country that it is a partner that the government can
look forward to working with.
   ``In fact, the situation now is that the government in Poland,
the communist government, cannot pass any legislation without the
agreement of Solidarity,'' the ambassador said.

   The city government ignored a Sunday
deadline set by protesters to open talks and instead continued
arresting leaders of the pro-democracy movement.
   Authorities also expelled a British journalist, the first foreign
newsman ordered out of the country since the protest movement began
seven weeks ago.
   At a rally Friday, students gave the Shanghai municipal
government 48 hours to agree to direct talks on democratic reform,
publicize the truth of the military attack in Beijing and fly flags
at half-staff in this city to commemorate the victims of Beijing.
   Chinese troops stormed Beijing's central square a week ago,
shooting their way through the student-led protesters. Western
diplomats and U.S. intelligence sources have estimated that 3,000
were killed.
   The People's Square in downtown Shanghai was largely empty Sunday
despite students' threat to resort to stronger tactics if their
ultimatum was not met.
   The inactivity by protesters was reflected across China as the
government intensified its crackdown, rounding up leaders of
independent worker and student groups and waging a propaganda war to
discredit demonstrators.
   ``Our hearts support the students' struggle for democracy,'' said
one worker at a cargo firm. ``But many people feel it is time to
stop the protests and think of the best way to achieve the goal.''
   ``There was no way the government would agree to their demands,''
said a young worker at Shanghai's riverfront. ``They know the
students are all gone, that they're not at their schools.''
   News reports in Shanghai, the largest city in China with a
population of 12 million, announced more arrests Sunday in a
continuing crackdown, but no figure was given. Up to 680 people have
been arrested nationwide, according to partial estimates in some
cities.
   Yao Yongzhan, identified as head of the Autonomous Union of
Shanghai College Students, was arrested at Shanghai's international
airport in the company of consular officials from an unnamed
country, Shanghai radio said.
   Police also arrested Weng Zhengming, chairman of the China Youth
Democratic Party in Shanghai, on Saturday, state-run television news
said. It claimed Weng had drafted plans as early as 1986 to
overthrow the ruling Communist Party.
   About 200 workers mobilized by the government to maintain order
gathered outside Tongji University. Workers said Mayor Zhu Rongji
ordered 10 percent of all factory workers in Shanghai to report for
such duty.
   ``We're here to keep traffic flowing smoothly,'' said a
22-year-old woman at the Tongji University gate. She denied the
group was there to keep students from marching off campus.
   City officials also cracked down on foreign journalists.
   Authorities ordered Peter Newport of Britain's Independent
Television News out of the country for filming a student sit-in in
front of Shanghai's police headquarters, said a British diplomatic
source speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The Shanghai municipal government issued an open letter Saturday
to all diplomatic missions in the city, instructing them to tell
journalists from their countries that they cannot cover news in
Shanghai without government permission.
   ``Some unexpected danger may arise and we are unable to guarantee
their life security,'' said the English letter, signed by the
consular division of Shanghai's Foreign Affairs Office. ``Please
call the journalists' attention to that.''

<HEAD>Dukakis Walks Tightrope in Signing Chelsea School Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DIAMOND</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An unprecedented experiment in public education is
about to begin with Gov. Michael S. Dukakis expected to sign a bill
Monday that will let Boston University take over the troubled school
system in the city of Chelsea.
   The plan, approved by the Legislature after months of sometimes
bitter discussion, will link a public school system with one of the
highest dropout rates in the state _ 17 percent _ to a world-class
university with all its financial and educational resources.
   Boston University will get the prestige of conducting an
educational experiment never before tried in the United States, one
that will be watched closely and possibly duplicated by universities
around the country.
   ``One of the things I think we'd like to encourage in this state
is innovation and experimentation,'' Dukakis said at a news
conference. ``And there's no question this is innovative and
experimental.''
   ``We have a bill which I think has real promise for the future of
the schoolchildren in Chelsea,'' Dukakis said. ``It's an experiment,
and like most experiments, it is one that has to be tried before we
know whether it will succeed.''
   Under the plan, BU will run the 3,600-student system for 10 years
and pump in money from private donors and foundations for a variety
of new programs, including early childhood education, counseling and
nutritional services.
   Chelsea schools have been woefully underfunded, according to
officials in the largely Hispanic, working-class city of 25,000
outside Boston. Chelsea has seen its tax base shrink and faces cuts
of about $2.8 million in next year's school budget because of a
state budget crunch.
   BU's refusal to agree to any language guaranteeing open meetings
while orally promising to abide by state open-meeting laws had held
up the bill and had put Dukakis in a difficult position once the
measure reached his desk.
   Local teachers unions and the American Federation of Teachers,
which endorsed Dukakis in his bid for president last year, had
complained that the pact would allow BU to make decisions behind
closed doors. But a veto would have set up Dukakis for an
embarrassment, since the Legislature had passed the bill with enough
votes to override.
   On Friday, however, the governor said he would sign the bill _
and also direct the state Board of Education to set up a monitoring
panel to make sure BU abides by the open-meeting and public-records
laws.
   That move seemed to satisfy several factions that were
practically at one another's throats days earlier.
   BU administrators were delighted with the announcement, saying it
allowed them to begin raising the roughly $30 million they hope to
spend over the next decade.
   Hispanics opposed the agreement, saying university officials have
ignored requests for more information about bilingual programs.
   BU President John Silber said he would heed concerns raised.
   ``We are not going to privatize the schools,'' Silber said. ``We
are going to manage the public schools and they are going to remain
public.''
   For higher education there could be a long-term benefit if the BU
experiment succeeds.
   ``Universities are looking at themselves and saying, `What is our
role in terms of the reform movement in education?''' said Peter
Greer, dean of the BU education school. ``One thing universities
have said is say how bad the entering freshmen are.''

   Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski of Poland laid a
wreath at the grave of one of his country's war heroes on Sunday and
ignored the jeers of anti-communist emigres.
   The Polish leader, on the second day of a British visit, was
heckled by protesters as he honored Gen. Wladislaw Sikorski,
commander of the Free Polish Forces who joined the Allies against
the Nazis during World War II.
   Police sealed off the Polish war graves section of Newark
Cemetery, 125 miles north of London, several hours before Jaruzelski
arrived in a 12-car motorcade. He left immediately after the short
ceremony for lunch with local officials and a return flight to
Poland.
   Sikorski, a prime minister of Poland in 1922-23, was killed in an
air crash in the British colony of Gibraltar on July 4, 1943. He is
buried with other Free Polish veterans, many of whom served at
British air bases during the war.
   The British visit, preceded by a one-day stop in Belgium, was
Jaruzelski's first trip outside Poland since his communist party
suffered a resounding defeat in national elections to the
Solidarity-led political opposition.
   Several hundred Polish emigres, some holding banners saying
``Jaruzelski, who are you kidding?'' and ``We want 100 percent
democracy,'' gathered outside the cemetery entrance and yelled as
Jaruzelski arrived.
   Several dozen protesters slipped around to the side of the
cemetery near the Polish war graves and shouted ``sacrilege!'' at
Jaruzelski while he laid the wreath.
   ``This man (Jaruzelski) is the one who sent tanks against his own
people and he is a product of his masters, the Soviet Union,'' said
Artur E. Rynkiewicz, president of the Federation of Poles in Great
Britain, which sponsored the protest.
   Jaruzelski ordered a martial law crackdown to crush Solidarity in
December 1981. It was made legal again under an agreement in April
that also allowed limited opposition participation in elections.
   The emigres also said it was Sikorski's last wish that his body
not be returned to Poland until his homeland was free.
   ``The Polish government wants the world to think that Poland is
free. They want to use Gen. Sikorski's return as window dressing,''
said Ted Lawrence, 65, of Long Eaton. He served in the Free Polish
Forces.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has refused requests for the
return of his body to Poland, where a marble tomb awaits his burial
among the last Polish kings.
   Press Association, Britain's domestic news agency, said
Jaruzelski did not raise the issue during his meeting with Mrs.
Thatcher on Saturday.
   During the visit, the British told Jaruzelski they would provide
limited economic aid, including a $7.75 million annual contribution
to a new fund to train Poles for a more market-oriented economy.
Britain also agreed to press for rescheduling of Poland's $38
billion foreign debt.
   Jaruzelski has been stepping up contacts with Western countries,
mainly in the hope of getting economic aid after the domestic
political reforms.

<HEAD>New Security Devices Detect Plastic Explosives</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two new security systems capable of detecting
plastic explosives were displayed Sunday at the Paris Air Show, the
first international aviation exposition since the December bombing
of Pan Am flight 103.
   The sophisticated systems, both on the market for the first time
this spring, were created by two American companies. The companies
were invited by the Federal Aviation Administration to show the new
technology during the 10-day gathering at Le Bourget airport north
of Paris.
   In recent years, searches, metal detectors and X-ray machines
have become routine at airports and the number of hijackings has
declined. But passenger planes remain vulnerable to hidden devices.
   It takes less than a pound of plastic explosive, the size of a
chocolate bar, to bring down a jumbo jet. The deadly material can be
molded into shapes that are easy to hide.
   Such an explosive hidden in a casette tape player is believed to
have caused the death of 275 passengers aboard the Pan Am jet downed
over the Scottish village of Lockerbee in December.
   Thermedics Inc. of Woburn, Mass., came up with a ``sniffer'' that
detects chemical vapors. The $125,000 hand-held sniffer, called
EGIS, is a computerized chemical analyzer with programmed rules,
called algorithms.
   ``If you look at the last 15 incidents of bombing or attempted
bombing, in six of them the bomb found its way into the aircraft
cabin,'' said Thermedics President John W. Wood Jr. ``This
illustrates the need to screen people and carry on bags as well as
checked luggage.''
   Thermedics has developed a second sniffer that is about a year
away from the markeplace. It is called SecurScan and works on the
same principle as EGIS but is designed as a walk-through chamber
similar to the now common metal detector.
   A second new device is being shown by Science International
Applications Corp. of Santa Clara, Calif. Their apparatus is called
a thermal neutron activation, or TNA and sells for $900,000.
   Baggage passes on a conveyor belt through a chamber where it is
showered with neutrons that react when exposed to nitrogen, the
chemical emitted by virtually all explosives. The reaction produces
a scattering of gamma rays, a sort of chemical fingerprint that is
analyzed by a computer.
   Six units have been purchased by the FAA for installation at New
York's Kennedy Airport and London's Gatwick and 12 others will be
installed in high-risk airports in the United States and overseas.
   Meanwhile, thousands of visitors to the airshow cast their eyes
skyward over Le Bourget airport Sunday to watch the first
demonstration flight by a Soviet MiG-29 since the crash of an
identical fighter last week.
   The camouflage-green fighter, emblazoned with a red star flew
loops and spins in the blue sky, its engines spitting pale fire.
   The sister MiG-29 crashed just after the opening of the air show
on Thursday, but pilot Anatoly Kvochur managed to eject from the
plane at 500 feet.

   About 1,500 Burmese troops attacked a
stronghold of ethnic Karen rebels near the Thai on border Sunday,
Thai border police reported.
   They said about 700 Karen guerrillas were defending the Pa Loo
base and about 2,000 civilians had fled the area.
   Burmese forces began pounding the camp with hundreds of shells
and bombs early Sunday, said the police, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   There were no immediate casualty reports from Sunday's fighting,
which was still heavy late in the day.
   However, Karen sources said 22 Burmese soldiers and six rebels
had been killed since battles began around the camp on June 1. They
said 31 government troops were wounded along with 13 Karens.
   Karens are the largest of a dozen ethnic rebel groups which have
battled for 40 years seeking more autonomy from the central
government. Authorities opened an intensive campaign last October to
crush the Karen insurgency.

   A committee investigating a helicopter
crash that killed Iraq's defense minister determined the crew lost
control of the chopper during a sandstorm, the official Iraqi News
Agency reported Sunday.
   The agency, monitored in Nicosia, said the committee's report
blamed ``extraordinarily bad weather conditions and lack of
visibility coupled with a sandstorm'' for the crash that killed Gen.
Adnan Khairallah.
   There were no indications of mechanical trouble, an explosion or
fire aboard the U.S.-made Bell military helicopter, which had flown
for only 603 hours when it crashed in northern Iraq on May 5.
   Bell helicopters normally are used by Iraq's President Saddam
Hussein and his aides when traveling inside the country.
   Khairallah, who was deputy armed forces commander-in-chief and a
close confidante of Saddam, was killed along with six others, on a
flight to Baghdad from a mountain resort near Mosul, 280 miles
northwest of the capital.
   He was considered the second-most powerful man in Iraq after
Saddam.
   The helicopter went down near the village of Kweir, close to the
main Mosul-Kerkuk road, an uncultivated area inhabited by Bedouin
tribes, the report said.
   Khairallah, who was Saddam's brother-in-law but had recently been
at odds with the president, was the third senior Iraqi official to
die in a helicopter crash in the past 18 months. Diplomats in
Baghdad said Saddam and Khairallah had a brief misunderstanding in
late 1988 over the president's treatment of his oldest son, Odai.
   The report said the meteorological department at the Firnass air
base had warned of possible sandstorms and bad visibility in
northern Iraq.
   The Iraqi News Agency said the investigating committee included
representatives of the army transportation staff, the air force and
air defense command, military intelligence and general security
service, the Iraqi intelligence agency and the military's technical
department.

   Gary McGivern is both an environmental
activist and a convicted cop killer, a combination which may prove
deadly to an annual festival that raises money for conservation.
   The Westchester County executive says that because McGivern edits
a newsletter published by the event's sponsor, the county will back
out of the Great Hudson River Festival in coming years. County
police say they won't help patrol the festival this year in their
off hours.
   ``This guy is a convicted killer of a police officer who was a
member of my department,'' said Ronald Harbolic, head of the county
Police Benevolent Association. ``We aren't going to work for people
who hire cop-killers.''
   For five years, McGivern and his wife Marguerite Culp have
co-edited The Navigator, the newsletter of the Hudson River Sloop
Clearwater, the group founded by folksinger Pete Seeger to help
clean up the Hudson River.
   McGivern did his work from a prison cell until this year, when he
was granted clemency by Gov. Mario Cuomo. McGivern, who has always
claimed his innocence, was convicted of the 1968 murder of
Westchester Deputy Sheriff William Fitzgerald.
   This year's festival is scheduled for Saturday and Sunday at
Westchester Community College. It has roots going back more than 20
years, when Seeger sang on a lawn and passed the hat to raise money
to build the Clearwater, a replica of a 19th century sloop. The ship
has sailed the Hudson to promote efforts to clean the river, efforts
that have met with some success.
   The full-scale festival has been staged annually for 12 years.
   Last year, 20,000 people attended. The county contributed
services it estimated to be worth $45,000, including bus
transportation, park attendants and police. The county also allows
use of the college campus.
   ``It's an impossible situation for Westchester to give up to
$45,000 in taxpayer dollars to an organization which hired a cop
killer, someone who murdered a Westchester County deputy sheriff,''
said County Executive Andrew O'Rourke. ``It's impossible to
underwrite the organization. Public money can be better spent than
paying Gary McGivern.'' McGivern and his wife put out the newsletter
under a contract.
   John Mylod, executive director of the Clearwater, said the
organization knew who McGivern was when he was hired and has never
tried to hide him.
   O'Rourke and Harbolic both said they failed to notice McGivern's
name on the newsletter's masthead and had not seen a festival
program in which McGivern and Culp were pictured and profiled.
   McGivern and his wife declined to be interviewed about the
controversy.
   McGivern, 44, has maintained he was innocent in the 1968 shooting
of Fitzgerald which occurred while McGivern and two other inmates
were being transported from the Auburn Correctional Facility to a
White Plains court.
   McGivern was serving time on a robbery charge when the shooting
occurred. He said one of the other two inmates did the shooting.
That inmate was killed in the shootout along with the deputy sheriff.
   He a model inmate and made powerful friends, such as Seeger,
Cuomo and columnist William F. Buckley. When he was released this
year, the parole board cited his ``outstanding record of
institutional adjustment.''
   Mylod indicated that McGivern would not be let go because of the
threats and protests: ``Some hateful things are being said. It's
unfortunate ... but we're not going to change anything.''
   Mylod said he thought the Clearwater's 1,500 volunteers would be
able to handle any problems at the festival this year.
   He was unmoved by suggestions that some people might stay away
from the festival this year because of the McGivern connection;
that's their right, he said. The same, he said, goes for police
officers who may picket the fair.
   ``We may not have to worry about next year,'' he said. ``If it's
a bad year financially _ especially if it really rains _ that may
answer the question about next year from a practical, financial
point of view rather than a political one.''

   North Korea declared solidarity Sunday with Chinese
hard-liners and rebuked U.S. complaints about their crackdown, but
Hong Kong demonstrators burned a coffin of the ``Chinese soul''
during more worldwide protests.
   In San Francisco, two men identified as Chinese diplomats
declared they could no longer lie about their government's
suppression of pro-democracy protesters and asked for asylum in the
United States.
   The Bush administration, many leaders around the world, and
thousands of protesters have been speaking out against the Chinese
government since it ordered soldiers to move against the protesters
on June 3-4. The death toll remains uncertain, but U.S. intelligence
estimates say 3,000 died.
   The United States decided to suspend arms sales to China.
   In a commentary carried by the official North Korean News Agency,
that country said: ``No matter what may happen in China, it is not a
business of the United States across the ocean.''
   The dispatch, monitored in Tokyo, added that Washington ``cannot
bar the triumphant advance of socialism.''
   Chinese troops fought with North Korea against U.S.-led U.N.
forces that came to South Korea's aid in the 1950-53 Korean War.
   In Hong Kong, protesters burned a cardboard coffin marked
``Chinese soul'' next to the local office of China's official Xinhua
News Agency. In keeping with Chinese funeral customs, the coffin as
well as wreaths and banners were set on fire a week after the deaths.
   During a separate rally in a downtown park, thousands of people
watched actors portray Beijing residents braving bullets fired by
troops.
   Organizers urged the Chinese government not to arrest
demonstrators, called for strikes in Hong Kong and China, and
appealed to Chinese-funded companies to break with Chinese
authorities.
   U.S. educators evacuated from China to Hong Kong said Sunday they
fear the departure of foreigners from China will leave student
protesters and others there more vulnerable.
   ``We're worried not only about the safety of the students. We're
worried about the safety of everybody in the university that we
knew,'' said Larry Slifman, an economist from Washington, D.C. He
had been teaching at Wuhan University.
   At a protest of about 5,000 people in San Francisco, two men
identified as diplomats at the Chinese consulate said they no longer
could support their government and were defecting.
   ``We are supposed to tell you that no one was injured or killed.
Why? Because we are diplomats. But we won't fake it here,'' one of
them said.
   The FBI confirmed the asylum request but did not release the
men's names. Lee Man-kar, an editor at San Francisco's Chinese
Times, identified the two as Zhou Li-ming, vice consul for cultural
affairs; and Zhang Li-man, acting consul for overseas affairs.
   At least 5,000 Chinese students and British supporters in London,
many chanting ``Long live freedom!'' marched from Chinatown to the
Chinese Embassy, following behind a banner proclaiming: ``Condemn
the murderous government in China.''
   In Sydney, Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke said concern for
fundamental human rights ``transcends national boundaries'' and that
China's leaders have lost international standing.
   The newspaper Tokyo Shimbun reported Japan is reluctant to
provide more development assistance to China unless its government
takes responsibility for the violence. However, the report did not
say exactly what China would have to do.
   Malaysia's Home Ministry said it would keep tabs on domestic
supporters of the Chinese protest movement for fear they might
threaten Malaysian security.
   Malaysia has long been wary of China, which gives moral support
to communist guerrillas on the Malaysia-Thailand border.

   The government said Sunday it
expects an international conference later this week to help it stem
a tide of Vietnamese refugees.
   The two-day conference, which Vietnam has agreed to attend, will
review an orderly departure program worked out by Southeast Asian
countries in March.
   The agreements call on Vietnam to take back people who are merely
economic refugees, but it has so far agreed to accept only those who
volunteer for repatriation.
   The meeting, beginning Tuesday in Geneva, should help relieve
some of Malaysia's problems with the flood of boat people, Foreign
Minister Abu Hassan Omar was quoted as saying by the Bernama state
news agency.
   He said specifically that Malaysia hopes to close down one
temporary camp with 15,000 refugees on Pulau island in the South
China Sea.
   The March plan, which Vietnam approved, also urges other third
countries around the world to increase their intake of refugees. It
must be approved in Geneva before it is put into effect.
   About 20,000 Vietnamese refugees remain in Malaysia, down from a
peak of 76,500 in 1979.
   Under the March accords, Malaysia and other Southeast Asian
countries have begun separately sheltering people viewed as economic
refugees until they can be repatriated.
   Despite the agreements, many refugees have still fled Vietnam for
Malaysia, Thailand, Hong Kong, the Philippines, and other Southeast
Asian countries.
   In Cebu City, Philippines, 17 Vietnamese refugees arrived aboard
a cargo ship Sunday.
   Their leader, 41-year-old Nguyen Van Lam, said he was a former
lieutenant in the Vietnamese army.
   He said the group left Vietnam on May 23, their sailboat sank 11
days later, and a ship rescued them. He said they were transferred
in China to the cargo vessel, which brought them to the Philippines.
   ``We want a better life,'' said Lam.

<HEAD>Many People Expected to Address Court Before Sentencing in Judge's
Death</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Activists for battered women are
advocating the maximum sentence for a man convicted only for
manslaughter in the shooting of his estranged wife, a county judge.
Sentencing was set for Monday.
   When Judge Carol Irons was shot to death in her chambers eight
months ago by Clarence Ratliff, a former police officer who was her
estranged husband, deputy clerk Mary Harrison tried to stanch Irons'
bleeding.
   Harrison still has nightmares about the shooting and attends
weekly counseling sessions. She says she'll be among the many people
expected to speak Monday before Ratliff's sentencing.
   ``This has consumed me for months now,'' said Harrison. ``Now, I
want `Rat' (Ratliff) to know what he's done to us here, the whole
building. He didn't just kill Carol, though that was horrifying
enough in itself. He's changed all our lives.
   ``We'll never be the same again.''
   A thousand people rallied last month outside the county Hall of
Justice to protest the voluntary manslaughter conviction. On May 11,
a jury acquitted Ratliff of first-degree murder, which carries a
possible sentence of life in prison without parole. Ratliff, 53,
testified that he was drunk and upset over their impending divorce
and did not mean to kill Irons, 40. Manslaughter carries a sentence
of up to 15 years.
   The jury also convicted Ratliff of attempted murder for firing at
two officers who tried to help Irons _ a conviction that carries a
potential sentence of life in prison with possibility of parole.
   ``We are outraged that the murder of a woman is considered less
serious than shooting at _ and missing _ two men,'' said Dotti
Clune, one of those who protested the verdict.
   Another deputy clerk, Danielle Smith, said she also would address
Kent County Circuit Judge Dennis C. Kolenda before the sentencing.
   Smith, 27, said she opened the locked door to let Ratliff into
his wife's chambers on the day of the shooting.
   ``At first, though, when it was happening, I laid under a desk
and thought, `God, I let that man in!'' she recalled.
   Also planning to speak are former college classmates of Irons who
formed the Carol S. Irons Committee for Justice in response to the
Ratliff verdict.
   Kolenda said he was told Irons' brother, Peter, would speak. Her
parents, James and Virginia Irons of Farwell, have asked an attorney
to speak on their behalf.
   Ratliff will also have a chance to address the court before he is
sentenced.
   ``This is the time for the defendant to tell me anything he wants
me to consider, so he can't complain later something was said to
which he didn't have a chance to respond,'' Kolenda said.
   ``I plan to be very explicit in explaining the process, what I'm
doing and why I'm doing it. I take time with every defendant,'' he
said. ``But I'll be especially careful here, because I want
absolutely no room for complaints on appeal and because there are so
many people interested in this.''

<HEAD>New Orleans Board to Vote on Year-Round School Experiment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Summer may be over almost before it's begun
for students at two elementary schools where officials are planning
to try the Three Rs year-round.
   The Orleans Parish School Board meets Monday to make its final
decison, after giving tentative approval in February to add 40 days
to the school year at the two city schools.
   For pupils at Robert Moton and Johnson C. Lockett elementary
schools who volunteer to take part, it would mean returning to
school July 10 instead of Sept. 5 like the rest of the city's
students. The schools have a combined enrollment of 1,400.
   Its estimated cost would be $703,000 and some supporters fear
board members might balk at the expense of the plan when they meet
on Monday.
   ``We really have to try a model to work out the kinks,'' board
member Woody Koppel said Sunday.
   He said he expects a unanimous vote, even though some board
members may have reservations about parts of the plan.
   ``It's expensive but it's worth spending the money to try it
out.''
   Plans call for the money to come from the federal government's
Chapter I supplemental program for disadvantaged students _ about
three-quarters of the students at each school are from low-income
families, Koppel said.
   But federal rather than local tax dollars won't mean the program
will be judged any less strictly, he said.
   ``It has to prove that it's cost-effective and can improve test
scores and deportment in the schools,'' said Koppel. ``We will see
after the first year how well this program is judged.''
   He said the program is planned for both Moton, which had 798
students last year, and Lockett, which had 710, because they serve
students from the same general area _ an area which includes two
housing projects.
   ``Sometimes the kids move around. We don't want a situation where
they move from one school to another and lose the services,'' he
said.
   Nelka Smith is one parent who will be disappointed if the
year-round plan is postponed.
   ``Year-round school is a plus,'' said Smith, who was at Moton on
Thursday to pick up report cards for her five children, all of whom
made the honor roll and earned perfect attendance certificates.
   ``A longer school year would give the children something better
to do than playing in the street, especially in that dirty water
after it rains,'' she said.
   Like other Moton parents, Smith said the year-round program will
give the children an alternative to the drugs and violence prevalent
in the nearby Desire housing project area.
   ``I'd rather see them here safe than exposed to drugs in the
streets,'' said Sandra Doyle, whose three children attend Moton.
``Three months without nothing to do is too much time wasted.''
   While most American children spend 180 days in the classroom,
school terms in Japan last 240 days. The New Orleans experiment
would be for a 220-day term. Two American high schools offer an
extended year.
   California has year-round schools, Koppel said, but that program
was started because there were too few school buildings rather than
as an attempt to boost learning.
   Moton and Lockett teachers were given the option of transferring
to other schools, and student participation is voluntary.
   Lockett Principal Herbert Dunn said all but two of his teachers
signed up for the year-round program.
   ``The parents are enthused about it,'' he said.

   A private investigator returned from
Switzerland to face charges that he allegedly beat John Wayne's
daughter at her ex-husband's request.
   Oded Daniel Gal, 32, of Beverly Hills was being held Sunday on $1
million bail. He gave up his extradition fight, returned to the
United States on Friday and was charged with conspiracy to
intimidate a witness and conspiracy to commit assault.
   Gal was hired by Aissa Wayne's former husband, Thomas Gionis, to
follow her during the couple's custody dispute last year. He was
accused of recruiting two men at Gionis' direction to attack Ms.
Wayne and her boyfriend, Roger Luby.
   Gionis, 35, was charged with assault and has denied any
involvement.
   Gal was the fourth person accused in the October 1988 attack at
Luby's Newport Beach estate. Ms. Wayne and Luby told police that two
men with guns handcuffed them, smashed their faces into a concrete
floor and slashed Luby's leg.

<TEXT>
   The wife of a missing Briton who was
believed kidnapped a month ago marked his 75th birthday Sunday with
a tearful televised appeal to the Syrian army to ``find Jacky for
me.''
   ``Our 48th wedding anniversary is on June the 18th. Please send
him home for me,'' sobbed Sunny Mann in a 90-second plea over the
Christian-controlled Lebanese Broadcasting Corp. network.
   Jack Mann, a World War II pilot, disappeared in Moslem west
Beirut May 12. The couple has lived in west Beirut for more than 40
years.
   ``I'm not a young woman to stand the continuous pain of not
knowing if he's dead or alive,'' Mrs. Mann said, reading from a
prepared statement.
   She then removed her glasses, faced the camera and as her eyes
welled with tears, said, ``We love you darling; happy birthday.''
   A terrorist group, the Cells of Armed Struggle, claimed in a
statement delivered to a Western news agency on the day Mann
disappeared that it had kidnapped a Briton. It did not give any name.
   The group demanded the release of comrades who it said were
jailed in London in connection with the 1987 killing of Palestinian
cartoonist Ali Naji Al-Adhami.
   It did not identify the people allegedly jailed and Scotland Yard
said no arrests have been made in the case.
   Mrs. Mann said in her plea, ``I am appealing to the Syrians who
are in charge of security in west Beirut. Find Jacky for me. You
have found other hostages, Lebanese and foreigners. I know you made
several inquiries but please try harder.''
   The Syrians maintain an estimated 12,000 troops in west Beirut
and parts of Lebanon under an Arab League mandate.
   Fifteen Westerners, not counting Mann, are missing in Lebanon and
it is believed they were kidnapped by Moslem extremists. Nine
Americans are among the hostages. Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press, has been held the longest.
He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.

   Iranian opposition forces, hoping to take
advantage of the disarray in Iran following the death of Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini, have reopened camps in Iraq to train thousands of
recruits, according to diplomats.
   They said Iranians living in exile in Europe and the United
States have flocked to Iraq to join the National Liberation Army of
Iran since Khomeini's death June 3.
   The National Liberation Army is the military wing of the
Mujahedeen Khalq, or People's Holy Warriors, the main Iranian
opposition group.
   Thousands of exiled sympathizers were immediately sent to rebel
bases along the Iran-Iraq border for training, according to a
mujahedeen spokesman.
   ``A stream of our supporters has been pouring in and they are
being given proper training in our bases here,'' said Farid
Suliamani, a spokesman for the Baghdad-based organization. He did
not give figures on new recruits.
   Witnesses said dozens of military vehicles carrying rebel
fighters were seen Thursday and Friday near northern Suliamaniya
heading toward rebel camps on the border with Iran. The vehicles had
Farsi markings and bore mujahedeen emblems, they said.
   Border camps were closed after a United Nations cease-fire halted
the eight-year Iran-Iraq war on Aug. 20. The Mujahedeen fought
alongside Iraq in the war and also halted operations inside Iran
following the truce.
   But rebel leaders put their forces _ estimated at 20,000 _ on
alert after Khomeini underwent surgery May 23 to stop intestinal
bleeding.
   After the patriarch's death, opposition leader Massoud Rajavi
called on Iranians to prepare to welcome the rebels and help them
when they move into Iran ``at the appropriate moment.'' Rebel camps
were reopened in a show of force, diplomats said.
   The diplomatic sources spoke on the condition they not be
identified.
   But there has been no indication that the rebels are planning
military action.
   Military analysts do not believe the rebels are strong enough to
topple the Iranian government alone unless a power struggle
develops. And despite earlier indications of factional fighting,
Iran's new leader, President Ali Khamenei seems to be consolidating
his position, sources said.
   In addition, any military move would need approval from the Iraqi
government. It is thought unlikely that Baghdad would permit any
action that might jeopardize the temporary truce with Iran or impede
progress in deadlocked peace talks.
   One diplomat said although it was unlikely the rebels would move
across the border while the cease-fire holds they might take
advantage of any serious truce violation to attack Iranian positions
or set up rebel bases inside Iran. Mujahedeen officials said the
group's military strength has increased steadily since the
cease-fire and that months of intensive training in Iraq have made
it ``a far more effective military force than before.''
   The rebels were allied with Khomeini in the struggle to topple
the late Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. But in 1980-81, a year after
Khomeini took power, he turned on the group and other leftist
factions, killing and imprisoning tens of thousands of people.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. ambassador to China, James R. Lilley,
said Sunday it would be a ``terrible mistake'' for the United States
to give up on maintaining relations with China despite the Beijing
government's harsh crackdown on the democratic reform movement.
   Lilley said U.S. policy toward China needs to respond to the
immediate situation there but also take a long-term approach rather
than seek any kind of ``quick fix.''
   The envoy's comments came in a telephone interview from Beijing
broadcast on the CBS program ``Face the Nation.''
   ``I think we've gone through many ups and downs with China, and I
think right now we're going through a down,'' Lilley said. ``But I
don't think we should sort of give up on it. I think that would be a
terrible mistake.''
   He said the United States can continue to have some influence in
China through avenues including Voice of America broadcasts,
training of Chinese students and ``in the multitude of business
decisions that are made every day on the basis of investment climate
and trading atmosphere.''
   ``What we do is we play for the long term, and we don't look for
a quick fix. ... We look for a long term solution. And I think
that's what we're working towards,'' Lilley said.
   The ambassador was asked about leading Chinese dissident Fang
Lizhi, who has taken refuge in the U.S. embassy in Beijing and is
seeking political asylum.
   Lilley responded: ``I would prefer not to discuss that situation.
I will say that I have had conversations with them (Chinese
officials) in the last two or three days. ... It's a very sensitive
thing, and it's best to do it and shut up.''
   Lilley gave no indication during the interview that he was aware
the Chinese government had issued an arrest warrant for Lizhi and
his wife, Li Shuxian, on charges of ``committing crimes of
counterrevolutionary propaganda and instigation.''
   Asked if the Chinese had approached U.S. officials about the two
dissidents, Kenneth Bailes, a State Department spokesman refused to
comment on the report and on any aspect of the situation.
   Upon arrival at the White house from the Camp David weekend
retreat, esident Bush declined to give a reaction to the Chinese
demand.
   As reporters shouted questions he cupped his hand to his ear and
said: ``I can't hear a thing. This is not an appropriate time.''
   The head of an organization supporting U.S.-China trade and
business ventures said American companies should first take steps to
ensure the safety of their personnel in China, then carefully
reassess their business prospects.
   Roger Sullivan, president of the U.S.-China Business Council,
said that in the short term, ``Nobody's talking about business as
usual. Business with China has been devastated, and it's very
important for us to bring home to the Chinese people that their
government did it.''
   He estimated that up until the current turmoil, the American
business presence in China totalled 8,000 to 9,000 people, with
about 300 U.S. companies having investment contracts worth $3.4
billion.
   ``Companies are taking their people out. That's the first thing
to do. I mean you've got to protect the safety and security of your
people, and then take a long look at and test your assumptions about
how you're going to be able to continue _ if indeed you're going to
be able to continue at all,'' Sullivan said.
   Also appearing on the CBS program was Sen. Alfonse D'Amato,
R-N.Y., who said he expects to see congressional action within the
next 10 days on economic sanctions against China, including a cutoff
of high technology.
   D'Amato said the United States should act as a ``catalyst'' in
promoting multilateral sanctions against China by Western European
countries and Japan.
   Rep. Stephen J. Solarz, D-N.Y., chairman of the House Foreign
Affairs subcommittee on Asian and Pacific affairs, also endorsed a
strategy of seeking multilateral economic sanctions.
   Interviewed on CNN's ``Newsmaker Sunday,'' Solarz said the United
States should deprive China of ``any special concessions or credits
which they've been receiving in the past which we ordinarily
wouldn't give to a communist regime which engages in the fundamental
abuse of the human rights of its own people.''
   Solarz was asked about the question of maintaining electronic
listening posts in China which help monitor Soviet missile tests.
   He responded that ``in terms of the listening posts, I believe
that those are mutually beneficial and so I don't think we need to
be overly concerned about them.''

   Maoist guerrillas killed a mayor in a small
town in the central Andes, blew up electric power lines and burned
the hammer and sickle symbol on a hillside, police said Sunday.
   Shining Path guerrillas on Saturday night seized the town of
Aija, near Huaraz, 190 miles north of Lima, calling a popular
assembly.
   During the meeting the mayor, Eugenio Soria, 52, was given a
``popular trial'' and shot with a submachine gun, the police said.
   The guerrillas also ran up a red flag with the communist hammer
and sickle. In two other incidents in two communities in the Huaraz
area, the guerrillas ignited the symbol of the hammer and sickle
made with cans full of oil on a hill, and they blew up two electric
power lines, police said.
   Since 1980, when the Shining Path began its insurgency, more than
14,000 people have been killed in this impoverished nation.

<HEAD>Navy Changes Gunpowder Storage Practices After Iowa Explosion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NORFOLK, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Navy is changing the way it stores
gunpowder for 16-inch guns on its Iowa-class battleships, despite
indications that powder was not at fault in the fatal blast on the
battleship Iowa.
   When the battleship Wisconsin heads for maintenance and repairs
this summer, its powder charges _ 110-pound bags _ will not be
stored aboard uncooled, unventilated barges as the Iowa's were, Navy
officials told The Virginian-Pilot and The Ledger-Star of Norfolk.
   When the Iowa went in for similar overhaul during the summer of
1988, its powder was stored aboard uncooled barges at the Yorktown
Naval Weapons Station on the York River during the hottest part of
the summer.
   In April, 47 sailors aboard the Iowa were killed when powder
exploded in the No. 2 gun turret during open seas gunnery practice.
Before the explosion, the No. 1 turret had a misfire when the five
bags of powder used to propel the gun's projectile wouldn't ignite.
   Navy officials have said they do not believe the storage of the
powder was to blame and are investigating the possibility of
sabotage. Nevertheless, the charges aboard the Iowa have been
removed and replaced with powder that was stored in
temperature-controlled underground bunkers.
   Smokeless powder is less stable and less effective ``if it is
stored in damp atmosphere or subjected to high temperatures. A
combination of the two is particularly bad,'' according to Navy
Manual OP5, the service's guide to munition storage.
   The manual says the powder charges decompose faster at
temperatures above 70 degrees Fahrenheit, ``becoming relatively high
at 100 degrees Fahrenheit and dangerously accelerated at
temperatures above 110 degrees Fahrenheit.''
   An internal Navy report estimates the temperature inside the
aluminum-sided barges used for storage was 25 degrees higher than
the outside air temperature. Using that estimate, the newspaper
calculated from National Weather Service readings for the area that
the temperature inside the barges could have exceeded 110 degrees on
66 days at the time the Iowa's powder was in storage.
   The newspaper, quoting internal memos from the station's safety
officer to his superiors, said the station's command was urged to
remove the Iowa's powder charges from the barges anchored at piers
on the river bank.
   ``Permitting these charges to be stored in the barge for this
period of time indicates the lack of importance that is placed on
compliance with the safety requirements'' set forth in the manual on
munition storage, a September 1988 memo said.
   Thomas Black, administrative officer at the Yorktown station,
said the Wisconsin's powder would not be stored at the station, the
largest of the Navy's six weapon stations.
   ``If it was for a short period, it would be something different.
We'll move it inland, and then bring it back when it's needed,'' he
said.
   Black said additional magazines are being built at the weapons
station to accommodate more munitions. According to the Pentagon,
Yorktown is the only one of the Navy's munitions stations that uses
barges for temporary powder storage.
   The Navy is continuing its investigation into the explosion, and
has regularly declined to comment on its findings until the
investigation is complete.
   Preliminary tests by the Navy of the Iowa powder have not shown
any indications of instability, according to the Pentagon.

<HEAD>OAS Makes Second Visit To Try To End Election Crisis</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A mission from the Organization of
American States arrived Sunday for its second try at mediating the
month-old election crisis, and the legislature's speaker urged the
group to focus on what he called U.S. meddling.
   The four-man delegation includes OAS Secretary General Joao Baena
Soares and the foreign ministers of Ecuador, Guatemala and Trinidad
and Tobago.
   The OAS mission failed on its trip in May to negotiate an end to
the crisis, touched off when the government led by Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega annulled results of the May 7 presidential election.
   International observers say that when the counting was halted the
opposition candidate had a 3-to-1 margin of victory over the one
backed by the Noriega-controlled government.
   The opposition insists Noriega, head of the Defense Forces, must
resign and that its victory be recognized. The government says
Noriega's status is not negotiable and has proposed that a
provisional junta take power Sept. 1, the constitutional
inauguration date.
   The speaker of the Noriega-dominated Legislative Assembly on
Sunday made public an open letter to the OAS asking it to focus its
efforts on U.S. actions, not those of Noriega.
   ``The fundamental reasons for the Panamanian crisis are rooted in
the open U.S. intervention in our internal affairs aimed at
maintaining hegemony in Panama and the region,'' Celso Carrizo said
in the letter.
   ``This intervention is carried through slander, disinformation,
economic aggression, psychological war, constant violations of the
Torrijos-Carter treaties and the threat of military attack.''
   The treaties signed in 1977 by then-presidents Jimmy Carter and
Omar Torrijos cede control of the Panama Canal to Panama at the end
of the century. Noriega has long maintained the United States wants
to renege on the pacts.
   The falling out between Noriega and the United States began last
year when he was indicted in the United States on drug trafficking
charges. The United States threw its support against the
anti-Noriega movement that has so far failed to budge the strongman.

<HEAD>Storms Loom Over The South</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Heavy thunderstorms and at least one tornado developed Sunday
over the South, and wet weather was scattered elsewhere across the
central part of the nation.
   An upper air disturbance moving across the southern Plains
triggered strong thunderstorms in humid, unstable air from the
central Gulf Coast and the lower Mississippi Valley into southern
Missouri.
   A tornado was produced by a severe thunderstorm near Bee Branch,
Ark., whileheavy rain that started falling Saturday caused rivers
and streams to rise across the southern Plains.
   Up to 7 inches of rain fell in parts of southeastern Kansas late
Saturday and early Sunday, forcing some rivers and streams out of
their banks. By 6 a.m. Sunday, Coffeyville had 7.2 inches of rain,
including 4 inches in one 45-minute period, and minor street
flooding was reported there and in nearby Caney.
   In north-central Kansas, vehicles were stranded throughout Beloit
after 3 inches fell in one hour late Saturday. At the Elks Club in
the center of town, the hoods of some cars were covered by water for
a short time.
   Two to 4 inches of rain fell overnight around Abilene, Texas,
which caused more than a foot of water to run over the spillway of
Lytle Lake.
   Flooding was expected in rural areas along the Verdigris River in
northern Oklahoma. Showers and some thunderstorms were scattered
across eastern Kansas and northeastern Oklahoma, with more
thunderstorms expected during the night across northern Texas.
   A cold front pushing across the northern Plains and central
Rockies produced showers and thunderstorms from the Great Basin of
Nevada and western Utah to the Dakotas.
   Elsewhere, thunderstorms were scattered across the Florida
Peninsula.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 51
degrees at Presque Isle and Caribou, Maine, to 98 at Needles,
Calif., and Laredo, Texas. Sunday's low in the 48 contiguous states
was 31 at Alamosa, Colo.
   For Monday, showers and thunderstorms were forecast from Florida
and much of the Gulf Coast region across the Mississippi and Ohio
valleys, and the Great Lakes to eastern sections of the central and
southern Plains. Showers were expected across the northern Plains
and the northern Rockies. Showers and thunderstorms developing later
in the day were forecast across the central Rockies.
   Highs in the 50s and 60s were predicted from central Montana
across the northern Plains and upper Mississippi Valley to the upper
Great Lakes; in the 90s from Florida and southern Georgia across the
Gulf Coast region, much of Texas, the southern Rockies and interior
valleys of California and Oregon; above 100 over the desert
Southwest, interior valleys of southern California, and along the
Rio Grande Valley in Texas; and in the 70s and 80s across the
remainder of the nation.

<HEAD>Gov't TV Shows Film of Trial Of Executed Reformist Premier</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hungarian television on Sunday showed
brief film footage of the trial of Premier Imre Nagy, a leader of
the 1956 anti-Soviet revolt who was executed in 1958.
   Nagy and the bodies of several of his close associates were
buried in unmarked graves, but the remains are to be reburied during
a ceremony Friday.
   Reformers, including Communist Party members, have claimed Nagy
and the others were convicted at an unconstitutional ``show trial''
and said they should be ``rehabilitated.''
   The film clip showed Nagy and some of his supporters being led
into a courtroom where they were charged with crimes against the
state.
   It was shown during a half-hour news program on the 1956 revolt
when Nagy's government sought to organize multiparty free elections
and sever Hungary's ties with the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact alliance.
   Soviet tanks crushed the revolt and Nagy and hundreds of other
government and political leaders were arrested.
   The bodies of Nagy and a few associates were dumped in a grave in
a cemetery in suburban Budpest. During Friday's ceremony, which will
be televised, the remains will be buried again in the same cemetery.
   Re-evaluation of the revolt began after hard-line Communist Party
chief Janos Kadar, who succeeded Nagy, was ousted in May 1988 under
strong criticism from reformers.
   In a statement last week the Communist Party leadership called
Nagy a ``significant'' figure in post-World War II Hungary.
   Leading Communist reformer Imre Pozsgay, in an interview on
Sunday's television program, said the time has come ``to face the
facts of what happened between Oct. 1956 and June 1958.''
   He said Nagy's trial was a ``political trial on trumped up
charges.''
   Foreign Minister Gyula Horn, who also was interviewed on the
program, said ``many of the tasks he (Nagy) set remain important to
this day.''

<HEAD>Republicans Aren't Pinning Hopes on Wright Seat</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican Party officials are playing
down their chances for Rep. Jim Wright's 12th District seat despite
an ethics investigation that forced the House Speaker to resign.
   ``It's like running the 100-yard dash between a Republican and a
Democrat, and giving the Democrat an 80-yard head start,'' said
Brian Epstein, a Republican political consultant in Fort Worth.
``It's not a fair race.''
   Republican officials point to several factors in their decision
to focus their efforts elsewhere.
   The district, which includes all of Fort Worth and most of its
surrounding communities, was drawn by Wright himself. It is full of
blue-collar Democrats and boasts a solid bloc of minority voters
that averages 30 percent to 40 percent of the voter turnout.
   In addition, Wright brought home more defense contracts, jobs and
federal funding than any other large urban area in the country
received, according to a computer study earlier this year by The
Dallas Morning News.
   Many residents view Wright as a martyr in an unjust political
war. And two of the strongest of possible GOP candidates, Fort Worth
Mayor Bob Bolen and Tarrant County Judge Roy English, have indicated
they are not interested in the seat.
   Finally, state Sen. Hugh Parmer, a formidable Democrat and
longtime friend of Wright, is considered a viable candidate.
   Ed Rollins, deputy chairman of the National Republican
Congressional Committee, said the district ``was drawn for the
Democratic leadership.'' Steve Hollern, chairman of the Tarrant
County Republican Party, called the seat ``marginally winnable.''
   The 12th District seat is one of three formerly Democratic seats
to be filled in upcoming special elections. Claude Pepper of Florida
died May 30 at the age of 88, and Majority Whip Tony Coelho of
California announced last month he would resign rather than face an
ethics investigation similar to Wright's.
   Rollins indicated last week that Republicans probably would
target Pepper's seat more heavily than the Fort Worth district.
   ``You cannot attack Jim Wright,'' Epstein told The Morning News.
``Anywhere in Texas, his name is mud, except in the Congressional
District 12.''
   Gov. Bill Clements can set a date for a special election not less
than 36 days after Wright submits his resignation from the House.
Wright indicated that would happen by the end of June.
   Republican officials say as many as 15 potential candidates have
begun to scope out potential supporters and financial backers, but
the field is not expected to narrow for at least another week.
   The potential GOP candidates include Alvarado businessman Don
McNiel, who unsuccessfully challenged Wright in 1986; state Rep.
Bill Carter; Erma Johnson, former chairwoman of the Dallas-Fort
Worth International Airport board; and former Fort Worth City
Council member Russell Lancaster.

   Former President Ronald Reagan arrived Sunday night
for a private visit _ his first trip abroad since leaving the White
House in January.
   Reagan, accompanied by his wife Nancy, arrived at London's
Heathrow Airport aboard a private Boeing 727 jetliner. They were
greeted by U.S. Ambassador Henry Catto and former Foreign Secretary
Francis Pym.
   The Reagans waved to onlookers before entering a limousine and
driving off without comment.
   They were scheduled to stay in Battersea Lodge, a private home
owned by magazine publisher and author Malcolm Forbes.
   Reagan is to deliver the Churchill Memorial Lecture on Tuesday.
The English Speaking Union invited Reagan to present an address on
``The problems, perils, challenges and opportunities confronting the
English-speaking peoples of today.''
   Last month Prince Philip presented the Churchill Award to Reagan
in Los Angeles. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, Reagan's host for
dinner on Tuesday, is among four recipients of the award.
   On Wednesday the Reagans have been invited to lunch with Queen
Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace, and he will be honored that
evening at a dinner sponsored by the Ronald Reagan Library
Foundation.
   Reagan last visited London on his way back from the Moscow summit
in June 1988. He also visited Britain in 1982 and 1984.

   A 2.5 million-gallon tank of methanol set
afire by lightning continued to burn Sunday as officials allowed it
to burn itself out.
   ``According to what they say, it should be burned out before
daylight,'' said Iberville Parish Sheriff's Deputy Roy Hebert.
   ``The tank is folding in as the fire burns itself down,'' Hugh
Lansford, manager at the six-month-old Ashland Chemical Co. plant
where the tank was located, said late Saturday. He said there was
little danger the fire would spread to nearby tanks.
   Just to be sure, state police said, firefighters sprayed water on
the burning tank and another tank of methanol, or methyl alcohol,
about 400 feet away to keep them as cool as possible.
   Damage appeared to be confined to the tank and no injuries were
reported.
   The plant turns natural gas into methanol, a high-quality fuel
used for, among other things, drag racers. The fire was reported
Saturday afternoon.

<TEXT>
   Rebel leader Alfredo Cesar returned to
his homeland Sunday, saying he was ending seven years of exile to
join the political fight against the leftist Sandinista government.
   ``I come ready to contribute to the political opposition through
my integration into the Social Democrat Party,'' Cesar said to
reporters at the Managua international airport after arriving from
Miami via Guatemala.
   Cesar, asked repeatedly by reporters, refused to say whether he
resigned from the seven-member directorate of the Miami-based
Nicaraguan Resistance, the umbrella organization of the U.S.-backed
rebels known as Contras.
   His last meeting with the directorate was ``four or five days
ago,'' Cesar said, adding that he came to Nicaragua ``to devote
myself exclusively to the civic political fight.''
   The 38-year-old leader said he will not seek an elective post in
general elections scheduled February 1990.
   Another opposition leader in exile, Pedro Joaquin Chamorro
Barrios, had been expected to return along with Cesar but his
absence was attributed to documentation problems.
   Over the past two weeks two other Contra leaders have returned
from exile, both signing an amnesty document saying they do not
support armed struggle against Nicaragua.
   Cesar arrived in a small jet plane provided by the Venezuelan
government, said his wife, Sylvia Lacayo de Cesar, who was at the
airport to greet him.
   Cesar, who lived in Miami, flew to Guatemala on Saturday and on
to Managua on Sunday.
   Some nine other fellow exiles and Contra members returned on a
commercial flight about one hour before Cesar's arrival.
   Cesar was president of the Sandinista government's Central Bank
when he left the country on April 25, 1982.
   The Sandinistas took power in July 1979 after spearheading a
civil war that toppled the rightist government of President
Anastasio Somoza.

   China on Sunday ordered the arrest of a prominent
dissident hiding in the U.S. Embassy, and authorities rounded up
more workers and students nationwide who helped lead pro-democracy
protests.
   The official Xinhua News Agency said warrants were issued for
dissident Fang Lizhi and his wife, Li Shuxian, who were charged with
``committing crimes of counterrevolutionary propaganda and
instigation.''
   The State Department said Tuesday that Fang and Li took shelter
at the U.S. Embassy after the army rolled into central Beijing and
opened fire on demonstrators June 3-4.
   Military attacks that left hundreds dead ended seven weeks of
protests that spawned demonstrations nationwide and caused a power
struggle in which hard-liners emerged in charge.
   The Chinese Foreign Ministry has strongly protested the U.S.
decision to grant sanctuary to Fang.
   The U.S. Embassy had no immediate comment on the Xinhua
announcement. Fang already was at the center of a U.S.-Chinese
conflict in February when police barred him from attending a banquet
given by visiting President Bush.
   James R. Lilley, the U.S. ambassador in Beijing, declined to
discuss Fang's case when asked about it in a telephone interview
broadcast Sunday on the CBS program ``Face the Nation.'' He gave no
indication he was aware the government issued arrest warrants for
Fang and his wife.
   The news of the warrants came as the government intensified its
efforts nationwide to round up students and workers who led the
demonstrations demanding a freer society and an end to corruption.
   A heavy troop presence in the capital remained on Sunday, and the
government kept up its propaganda effort to blame last week's
violence on protesters, urging citizens to turn in anyone suspected
of involvement.
   ABC News quoted Chinese sources as saying police arrested another
leading dissident, Ren Wanding. Ren, 44, an accountant, was jailed
from 1979-83 for helping lead an earlier pro-democracy movement.
   Beijing Communist Party chief Li Ximing reportedly named him as
an instigator of the latest student movement in a report to the
central government May 19, and Ren had told foreign reporters he
feared arrest.
   Authorities in Shanghai said they arrested the leader of a
``counterrevolutionary clique'' called the China Youth Democratic
Party, Weng Zhengming, and the head of an independent Shanghai
student group, Yao Yongzhan.
   They said Yao was arrested at the Shanghai airport as he tried to
board a Hong Kong-bound plane and was ``in the company of personnel
of the consulate of a certain country.'' They did not identify the
country.
   The government has announced the arrest of only one Beijing
student leader, Gua Haifeng, secretary of an independent student
group that organized hunger strike and marches by tens of thousands
of students. Other Beijing student leaders were in hiding.
   Television news broadcasts showed dozens of people being arrested
and questioned by police at gunpoint in various cities. Many looked
as if they had been beaten, and the face of one man, identified as a
leader of an independent labor union, was swollen so badly he could
barely open his eyes.
   One of those arrested was a man accused of ``rumor-mongering''
for telling ABC that 20,000 people were killed in the military
crackdown. China's national television broadcast network footage of
the man Saturday and appealed to the public to turn him in. It
announced his arrest Sunday in the northeastern city of Dalian.
   In New York, ABC News said in a statement that it was ``deeply
distressed to learn that in this instance the Chinese authorities
intercepted unedited news material that was being satellited and
used it for political purposes.''
   Laura Wessner, an ABC spokeswoman, said that last Monday, World
News Tonight used about eight seconds of the tape in a report by
correspondent Jim Laurie and it was one of several man-on-the-street
interviews.
   She said she did not know how the raw footage was intercepted by
Chinese authorities, who broadcast one minute and nine seconds of
the man's interview with ABC.
   ``We intend to do whatever we can to protect the identities of
those that we interview who feel their safety might be jeopardized
or at risk,'' Ms. Wessner said.
   The government has said nearly 300 people were killed but that
most were soldiers attacked by ``ruffians.'' Chinese witnesses and
Western intelligence sources have said as many as 3,000 may have
died when troops fired on crowds of citizens.
   The government issued no figure for the total number of arrests
nationwide, but partial figures issued by some cities totaled more
than 680.
   At least one city, the northwest tourist city of Xian, ordered
its residents to hand over foreign news reports of the attacks in
Beijing. The city government said the materials contained
``distorted propaganda.''
   An unspecified number of students from neighboring Hong Kong and
Macao were arrested in the southern Chinese city of Canton last week
after they protested the Beijing crackdown, Thailand's consul in
Canton, Wichai Vanasin, reported.
   Chinese authorites were in full control of Canton after arresting
the students from the British colony of Hong Kong and the Portuguese
territory of Macao, the consul said. Hong Kong is to revert to
Chinese rule in 1997 and Macao in 1999, and the violence in Beijing
has created concern in both.
   Authorities in Beijing, which has been under martial law since
May 20, issued a new order Sunday calling on anyone who ``burned
army or police vehicles, public buses and other public vehicles, or
plotted, organized or abetted in providing the conditions for such
atrocities'' to turn themselves in for lenient treatment, or expect
harsh punishment.
   Other cities issued similar orders and banned the independent
groups that led the protests.
   In the northeast city of Changchun, authorities held a rally
parading 26 alleged lawbreakers ``so the public would ... be
educated.'' Mass rallies to parade and in some cases execute
suspects were common elements of political control in the past but
had become less frequent in recent years.
   No new protests were reported in any cities.
   Student protesters in Shanghai had given the government until
Sunday to open talks with them on democratic reform, publicize the
truth of the military attack in Beijing and fly flags at half-staff
in honor of the Beijing dead. However, the deadline passed without
new student action.
   The media stepped up its criticism of the U.S. government-run
Voice of America radio station, accusing it of distorting the
crackdown.
   The Shanghai government sent foreign consulates a letter during
the weekend warning that foreign journalists there needed official
permission to report. Foreign reporters in Beijing already are
banned from conducting interviews on the street and most other
places.

<HEAD>Ethics Committee Offered Wright Deal to Resign, Newspaper Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Members of the House ethics committee,
not Speaker Jim Wright, initiated an attempt to strike a deal and
negotiate his resignation, the Dallas Times Herald reported Sunday.
   ``Everybody made it sound like Jim Wright went in on his knees
and asked for a deal,'' one senior Democratic source told the
newspaper. ``That is the complete opposite of what is true.''
   The Times Herald reported that numerous sources who asked not to
be named said the house speaker's resignation began with a call from
ethics committee Chairman Julian Dixon, D-Calif, to Rep. Louis
Stokes, D-Ohio, the former ethics chairman.
   Dixon said Wright's resignation would ``spare the House a harsh
and divisive confrontation,'' sources told the newspaper. Dixon said
the committee could drop some of the 69 allegations against Wright
by accepting portions of his legal motions filed the previous week,
if the speaker would agree to resign.
   Stokes relayed the message to Rep. Robert Torricelli, a New
Jersey Democrat who joined Wright's defense team several weeks
earlier. He passed the information on to the speaker.
   Wright, who told Torricelli to go ahead with negotiations,
reportedly said he was interested in an agreement if it would clear
the names of his wife, Betty, and friend George Mallick. Mallick had
been accused of providing Betty Wright with a phony job and improper
gifts.
   As negotiations continued, Wright turned down offers that would
have included continuing the censure over the sale of his book,
``Reflections of a Public Man,'' and the stipulation that Wright
step down within 24 hours.
   Wright reportedly said there would be no ``quid pro quo''
agreement for his resignation in exchange for exoneration on charges.
   Wright's representatives met with the committee's outside
counsel, Richard Phelan. Phelan said he had votes of all six
Republicans and at least one Democrat, Rep. Chester Atkins, D-Mass.,
to continue the investigation into other allegations against Wright
for several months.
   When those talks failed, Thomas Foley, D-Wash., then the House
majority leader and now the Speaker, was called in as a mediator.
The relationship between Dixon and Wright had deteriorated to the
point that neither man trusted the other, the newspaper reported.
   Then the ethics committee convened, with some Republicans
reportedly angered by the negotiations. But three hours later, the
group had heard nothing from Wright.
   ``If he wanted to make an offer, we were sitting there,'' said
Rep. John Myers, R-Indiana, who added that he was opposed to any
deals.
   To Wright's closest allies, the former speaker was the victim of
a ``setup.''
   But John Buckley of the National Republican Congressional
Committee disputed the claim.
   ``It is quite a typical Democratic ploy once they have lost to
claim that they were tricked or the tactics against them were
illegitimate,'' Buckley said. ``Wright's decline was inevitable,
whether it happened as quickly as it did or not. He was going down.''

<HEAD>Jordanian Foreign Minister Says Iranian Troops in Lebanon</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AMMAN, Jordan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foreign Minister Marwan Kassem says two
regiments of Iranian soldiers have arrived in war-ravaged Lebanon,
the Jordan Times newspaper reported Sunday.
   ``The Iranian military presence in the country is an attempt
designed to partition the sovereign Arab state ... through deepening
sectarianism, which in turn facilitates Israeli plans,'' he was
quoted as saying.
   The English-language daily quoted him as saying two Iranian
regiments had arrived in Lebanon and that more could arrive soon.
But there was no indication when the troops had arrived or how many
men were in each regiment.
   Sources in the eastern Baalbek region of Lebanon, a
fundamentalist stronghold, said 500 Revolutionary Guards had arrived
last month to reinforce the 3,000-strong garrison in the area.
   The contingent has been based there since early 1983, months
after the Israel invasion of Lebanon. Their stated purpose was to
fight with the Syrian army against Israel, but the Syrian troops did
not engage Israeli forces.
   Former President Amin Gemayel asked for their withdrawal several
times, severing relations with Iran over the issue in 1984.
Relations were restored in 1987.
   The contingent has been preaching Khomeini's brand of
fundamentalism among the Shiites in the Bekaa valley. It has its own
radio and television stations.
   Syria has allowed increasing Iranian influence in Lebanon,
annoying the many Arab states allied with Iraq during the 8-year
Iran-Iraq war that ended in a cease-fire last August. Those states
oppose the spread Iran's Shiite Moslem religious fundamentalism.
   Kassem was a member of a six-man Arab League committee which
tried to solve the 14-year-old Lebanese conflict earlier this year.
Rival Christian and Moslem Cabinets have been vying for power since
September, and artillery duels between their sectors in Beirut has
left more than 360 dead in the latest round of fighting that began
March 8.
   An Arab summit late last month replaced the earlier panel with a
three-man committee of Saudi Arabia's King Fahd, Morocco's King
Hassan and Algerian President Chedli Benjedid.
   The summit failed to win Syrian agreement to withdraw its 40,000
troops in Lebanon, who are backing the Moslem forces.
   The newspaper quoted Kassem as saying foreign occupation of
Lebanon could end when the Arabs can solve Lebanon's political
problem and can assure Syria it will not face Israeli threats
through Lebanon.
   Israel occupies a strip of territory in south Lebanon. Kassem
suggested Arabs could try to push for Israel's withdrawal under U.N.
Security Council resolutions _ a solution that he said might require
increased numbers of U.N. peacekeeping troops in Lebanon.

   Israel's military command on Sunday lifted a
weeklong curfew that confined 700,000 Palestinians to their homes in
the Gaza Strip, ending one of the longest restrictions imposed in
the 18-month Arab uprising.
   A curfew remained in effect on the 53,000 Palestinians in Gaza's
Jabaliya refugee camp because of clashes there Saturday with Israeli
troops.
   Two Palestinian teen-agers injured in the refugee camp violence
died Sunday of gunshot wounds to the head, an army spokesman
reported.
   He identified the victims as Mohammed Saeed Al Shaweesh, 15, and
Musa Omar Khalil Shama, 17, and said they died at Israel's Tel
Hashomer Hospital near Tel Aviv.
   The deaths raised to at least 516 the number of Palestinians
killed since the Palestininan uprising against Israeli rule in the
West Bank and Gaza Strip began in December 1987. Twenty-two Israelis
have been killed in the violence.
   In other developments Sunday:
   _A pamphlet issued by the clandestine Unified National Leadership
of the Uprising called on Palestinians to kill one soldier or Jewish
settler for each Arab slain. ``It is our right to defend ourselves
and slaughter our enemy with knives because our blood is not cheaper
than theirs,'' it said.
   _An Egyptian Cabinet minister discussed the uprising with Israeli
politicians and a Palestinian activist who supports the Palestine
Liberation Organization.
   _Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir agreed to convene the governing
body of his right-wing Likud bloc, where he will face a challenge to
his peace plan by three of the party's leading members;
   _Israeli peace activists protested a plan to require Arab day
laborers to wait in a specially designated ``transit station'' in a
town near Tel Aviv; and
   _Another group of eight Israeli peace activists who attended a
meeting with PLO representatives in June 1987 were charged by an
Israeli court with violating the nation's anti-terror law.
   After the curfew was lifted, 4,000 cars streamed out of Gaza
carrying Arabs to their jobs in Israel for the first time in a week,
Israel radio said.
   The curfew was imposed June 4 at the start of a government
campaign to give Gazans computerized identification cards to monitor
their travel into Israel.
   No violence was reported in Gaza or the West Bank Sunday.
   Butros Ghali, the Egyptian minister of state for foreign affairs,
began a two-day visit Sunday by meeting Labor Party members. They
hope Ghali's visit, the first by an Egyptian Cabinet minister in
nearly two years, will lead Egypt to support the Israeli peace plan
for the occupied lands.
   After meeting with Finance Minister Shimon Peres, leader of the
left-wing Labor Party, Ghali told reporters: ``I believe that on
some of the things where we agree, that we must continue to work
together where we can find a peaceful solution to the Palestinian
problem.''
   Ghali also met with Faisal Husseini, a Palestinian who heads a
study center in east Jeruslalem and is a PLO supporter. After the
meeting Husseini told reporters, ``The Egyptian position, I believe,
supports the Palestinian position.'' He declined further comment.
   The PLO has rejected the peace plan, which which calls for
elections and limited automony in the West Bank and Gaza.
   In the Tel Aviv suburb of Petah Tikva, 150 peace activists
demonstrated against the town's plan to require Arab day laborers to
wait in a specially designated ``transit station.'' The Town Council
put up plastic-roofed shelters on the edge of Petah Tikva to prevent
Arab workers from loitering on the streets as they await hiring on
work crews.
   The station was to be used starting Sunday, but a town spokeman
said implementation of the plan was delayed while Town Council
members debated it. Police have objected to the plan, challenging
its legality.
   Opponents described the holding area as racist and reminiscent of
South African apartheid. ``We didn't believe they would use it,''
said Shirley Eran, a member of the 21st Year group that organized
the demonstration. ``It is shocking to think they would.''
   Shamir, the Likud leader, has threatened to resign if the July 2
meeting of the 2,600-member Central Committee rejects his peace plan.
   His party rivals, Industry and Trade Minister Ariel Sharon,
Economics Minister Yitzhak Modai and Housing and Construction
Minister David Levy, have demanded that the Central Committee amend
the plan.
   Sharon has demanded that the elections be held without
international supervision or the participation of the 140,000 Arabs
of East Jerusalem. Palestinians have insisted on both as a condition
for agreeing to elections.
   The plan is silent on both points, and would have little chance
of Palestinian acceptance if Sharon's amendments are accepted.
   The charges against the eight Israeli peace activists say they
met PLO members in Hungary and discussed political matters without
authorization. If convicted, the activists face a maximum sentence
of three years in jail.

<TEXT>
   Friends of former President Franklin D.
Roosevelt celebrated Sunday the 50th anniversary of King George VI's
visit to Hyde Park, believed to have strengthened U.S.-Anglo
relations on the eve of World War II.
   About 250 people turned out at the Franklin D. Roosevelt Library
on the grounds of the Roosevelt home, said William Emerson, library
director.
   England's King George and Queen Elizabeth visited Roosevelt's
home June 11, 1939, during a tour of the United States.
   Sunday's celebration began the same way the king and queen's
visit did, with morning prayers at St. James Episcopal Church.
British Amabassador Antony Acland read an Episcopalian lesson
similar to the service attended by the Roosevelts and the king and
queen in 1939.
   Acland opened a special exhibit at the FDR Library that includes
the king's notes on conversations he had with Roosevelt about how
the United States might help Great Britain against Germany, Emerson
said.
   Acland also read a message from Queen Mother Elizabeth
reminiscing about her 1939 visit.
   Roosevelt invited the king and queen as part of his strategy to
shift American public opinion and policy away from isolationism,
Emerson said.

<HEAD>Gadhafi Praises Bush Administration As Mature And Wise</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi on Sunday praised the
Bush administration as ``wise and mature'' and said he expected
``balanced relations'' with both superpowers, the official Libyan
news agency JANA reported.
   Gadhafi's comments in Tripoli, the Libyan capital, appeared to be
part of an effort in recent months to improve relations with the
United States, which were sour under former President Ronald Reagan.
   The Libyan leader spoke to JANA, monitored in Rome, after a
ceremony marking the 19th anniversary of the eviction of U.S. forces
from bases in Libya.
   ``The Bush administration is a wise and mature administration and
understands international politics and it is not possible that it
will repeat the ignorance of Reagan and it is not possible that it
will inflict new damages to American interests and foreign policy,''
he told a JANA reporter.
   ``But contrary to that, we believe the new administration will
make up for the damage caused to America during the Reagan era and
that Great Jamahiriya (Libya) will establish balanced relations with
America and the Soviet Union,'' Gadhafi said, according to the JANA
dispatch.
   Gadhafi told The Associated Press in September that he expected
U.S. foreign policy to change from the strongly anti-Libyan stance
pursued under Reagan. The Libyan leader has also said President Bush
realized the ``irrationality'' of the Reagan policy and would make
amends for it.
   In a January interview, Gadhafi called for a dialogue with the
United States but Washington says Libya must first renounce
international terrorism. Gadhafi has said his country does not
practice terrorism.
   In his remarks to JANA Sunday, Gadhafi also said Libya ``will
invite American and Soviet companies to explore for oil and gas as
there are massive quantities of these raw materials in Great
Jamahiriya (Libya) and perhaps these companies will even participate
in water projects.''
   There have been reports in recent months that Libya is trying to
induce Americans to return to its oil operations.
   In his final weeks in office, Reagan authorized American oil
companies to resume operations in the North African country through
foreign subsidiaries. He had forbidden them from working there three
years earlier under sanctions imposed on Libya.

   The Ku Klux Klan held a rally and nobody came
Sunday, with the exception of about 100 anti-racism protesters.
   The Dixie Knights had called the protest against a company that
makes kosher foods. Instead, the counter-demonstrators assembled on
the steps of the Taylor County Courthouse, chanting slogans and
holding signs against racism.
   ``This is great. It shows when decent people gather together, the
slugs crawl under the rocks,'' said Tom Baxter, a member of Veterans
for Peace.
   The KKK's target had been Tom's Foods, a company that produces
snacks for vending machines and lunch counters. Included in its line
are kosher potato chips.
   ``We don't know why they picked us,'' said Tom Serff, executive
vice president of Tom's Foods. ``Just about every other food company
follows the kosher guidelines.''

<HEAD>EPA Orders Halt to Town's Planned Diversion of Rocky Flats Water</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BROOMFIELD, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Environmental Protection Agency
ordered the city to stop digging a ditch to divert water coming from
the Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant, despite allegations that the
plant dumped hazardous chemicals.
   Officials of the suburb northwest of Denver ordered the ditch dug
Saturday, citing federal allegations that the plant had dumped
hazardous chemicals into Walnut Creek, which is used for some of the
city's drinking water.
   The allegations were made public last week in an affidavit which
also charged that hazardous wastes were illegally burned at the
plant.
   The proposed one-mile diversion would take Walnut Creek water
around Great Western Reservoir, where city drinking water is stored,
and reconnect with Walnut Creek's outflow from the reservoir.
   The EPA told Broomfield officials such a diversion would be
illegal because the city of 27,600 residents does not have a federal
permit from the Army Corps of Engineers. The permit is required to
divert any river or stream, EPA regional director Jim Scherer said.
   ``Broomfield asked why the Department of Energy can be in
violation of the law and it can't,'' Scherer said.
   ``I told them two wrongs don't make a right. They agreed to talk
with our people on Monday.''
   City officials said they intended to go ahead with ditch, which
will cost about $50,000, but they agreed not to divert any water
into it without a permit, said Marvin Thurber, city public works
director.
   Only a few yards had been dug on the ditch before the EPA told
them to stop.

<TEXT>
   Alexsei Sultanov, a 19-year-old Soviet
noted for his aggressive, crowd-pleasing performances, won the
Eighth Van Cliburn International Piano Competition on Sunday.
   Sultanov was the youngest of the 38 competitors in the
prestigious two-week contest, which is known for launching musical
careers. He shook hands with Van Cliburn, the Fort Worth pianist for
whom the contest is named, and host Dudley Moore.
   Jose Carlos Cocarelli, a 30-year-old Brazilian making his second
appearance in the competition, won the silver medal. Benedetto Lupo,
a 25-year-old who now teaches in the Italian city where he grew up,
was awarded the bronze medal.
   As the bronze medalist was announced the crowd erupted in wild
applause and shouts of ``Bravo!'' Sultanov was given a standing
ovation.
   ``In this competition, I wanted to get first prize or nothing,''
the winner said afterward through an interpreter.
   A native of Tashkent, Sultanov has played concerts throughout the
Soviet Union and Europe and attends Moscow State University. He
studies under L.N. Naumov, who taught two previous Cliburn medalists.
   Along with his gold medal, the winner of the competition receives
$15,000, a Carnegie Hall debut recital, concert tours and free air
travel.
   The only other 19-year-old gold medalist in the history of the
contest was Christina Ortiz of Brazil, who won the Third Van Cliburn
in 1969. The only woman to win the Van Cliburn, Ms. Ortiz was one of
the judges of this year's contest.
   Sultanov became the sentimental favorite of the audience during
the semifinal round, bringing the audience to its feet during a
performance of Chopin's Sonata No. 3 in B minor. For the finals, he
performed Chopin's Piano Concerto No. 2 in F minor and
Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto No. 2 in C minor.
   The three medal winners were chosen from six finalists in the
quadrennial competition. Cocarelli and Lupo, the last contestants of
the final round, played for jurors Saturday night.
   Lupo played Chopin's Piano Concerto No. 2 in F minor and
Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto No. 2 in C minor. Cocarelli chose
Chopin's Piano Concerto No. 2 in F minor and Brahms' Piano Concerto
No. 1 in D minor.
   Lupo said he will not enter any more competitions, explaining,
``I don't like competitions. You can't compare two completely
different ways to play the piano.''
   He said a pianist's career is not defined by a competition.
   ``I think that a career is very long and it doesn't matter if you
are first prize, second prize, third prize,'' Lupo said.
   All six finalists were required to play a concerto with the Fort
Worth Symphony Orchestra and one with the Fort Worth Chamber
Orchestra.
   Two of the three Soviet finalists, including Sultanov, appeared
for their last-round performances Friday. Elisso Bolkvadze, 22,
played Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 21 in C major and Saint-Saens'
Piano Concerto No. 2 in G minor.
   Alexander Shtarkman, 21, of the Soviet Union led off the finals
round Thursday with Mozart's Concerto No. 21 in C major and
Prokofiev's Concerto No. 3 in C major. Shtarkman is the son of Naum
Shtarkman, who placed third to Cliburn's first in the 1958
International Tchaikovsky Competition in Moscow.
   Ying Tian, a 20-year-old Chinese student who lives in Boston,
played Chopin's Piano Concerto No. 2 in F minor and Beethoven's
Piano Concerto No. 4 in G major.
   Begun in 1962, the competition was started in honor of Cliburn,
who rose to international fame after winning the Tchaikovsky
competition at age 23.
   His concert schedule and performance fees swelled. But in 1977 he
took a career ``intermission'' that lasted a decade. Cliburn, now
54, gradually has been returning to the stage.
   The competition finalists, announced Tuesday, emerged from 12
semifinalists narrowed from 38 contestants since the contest began
May 27.
   Cocarelli has studied with Adele Marcus in New York. He was born
in Rio de Janeiro and lives in Paris.
   Lupo, born in Bari, Italy, teaches at the Piccinni Conservatory
and was a student of Aldo Ciccolini.

   A man who stunned doctors when he began
breathing again 40 minutes after being declared dead from
electrocution died Sunday evening without ever regaining
consciousness, hospital officials said.
   Jerry Middleswart, who had been listed in critical condition
since Friday at St. John's Regional Medical Center, was declared
dead a second time about 6:30 p.m., a nursing supervisor said.
   Middleswart, 47, was first declared dead Friday after the antenna
he and six other men were attempting to put up at his Oswego, Kan.,
veterinary clinic came in contact with a power line.
   ``He was a friend of mine,'' said Dr. Phillip Bortmes, the doctor
who worked for 45 minutes Friday trying to revive Middleswart before
two monitors indicated the man was dead. ``I made damn sure I tried
everything before I stopped working on him.''
   At 10:45 a.m. Friday, last rites were administered on Middleswart.
   Forty minutes later, ``a nurse hollered for me to come down,''
Bortmes said. ``I thought maybe somebody passed out.
   ``We had a steady pulse. He was unconscious, but his pupils were
functioning. He was alive.''
   David Torchia, a physicians assistant who worked with Bortmes,
said it was possible for a patient to revive after a long period of
not breathing if cardiopulmonary resuscitation had been administered.
   The nursing supervisor, who would not give her name, said
Middleswart never regained consciousness before he died.
   It was the second death from Friday's accident. The five others
suffered burns on their hands and feet when the antenna touched a
7,600-volt power line, the main line serving the small town in
southeast Kansas.

   Ethnic rioting that has killed 100 people in the
Uzbekistan republic has driven nearly 15,000 refugees into a camp
where living conditions are so primitive that women give birth on
the ground, Soviet media said Sunday.
   The military newspaper Krasnaya Zvezda said mobs of intoxicated
residents continue to direct violence at minority Turks in the
republic's Fergana valley region.
   ``The green colors of Fergana do not cover the remains of
burned-out homes which belonged to Turks not so long ago,'' the
newspaper said. ``In some places of the region, clouds of smoke are
visible. Numerous are the crowds made up of drunks and people high
on drugs.''
   The state-run television's evening news program Vremya showed
some of the estimated 14,500 Meskhi Turks housed at the camp outside
Fergana huddled under canvas tents out of the blazing sun.
   ``The most explosive situation is here, in the refugee camp,''
the report said.
   A spokesman for the Turks interviewed by Vremya demanded their
``immediate evacuation'' from Soviet Central Asia to ``save our
people.''
   The government newspaper Izvestia said conditions are so hard in
the camp that ``some of the 20 babies born in the past week were
delivered on the bare ground.''
   Most of the violence in the cotton- and grape-growing region,
about 1,500 miles southeast of Moscow, has been directed at the
Meshki Turks, a minority uprooted by dictator Josef Stalin in 1944
from its homeland in Soviet Georgia and forcibly resettled in the
Soviet east.
   Krasnaya Zvezda said about 100 people had been killed in the
first days of the week-long rioting, and approximately 1,000 other
people wounded. Official media previously reported 80 deaths.
   From Sunday's Soviet press, it was clear the violence was
continuing despite the presence of 9,000 Interior Ministry troops
sent to restore order. But the reasons for the outburst, which
officials said began as an ethnic dispute between Turks and the
dominant native population, the Uzbeks, were still unclear.
   Krasnaya Zvezda quoted Col. E. Nechaeyv, deputy chief of the
political department of Interior Ministry troops, as saying: ``We
think that the extremists' actions are guided by interested leaders
with mercenary goals, which they use vile methods to achieve.''
   Interior Minister Vadim Bakatin on Saturday blamed the rampage on
outside agitators who came pouring into the valley in cars and
trucks. He called them opponents of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
reforms, which have brought a crackdown on high-level corruption in
Uzbekistan.
   ``One thing is absolutely clear,'' Bakatin told the Sovietskaya
Kultura newspaper. ``Evil forces that want to destabilize the
situation ... are behind these events.'' But he said he could not
yet determine who was responsible.
   At Kimyagar settlement, five miles from the city of Kokand, young
people who arrived in cars smashed kiosks and shop windows on
Saturday, attacking people who tried to stop them, the labor daily
Trud said.
   It said the young rioters were detained and some admitted that on
the eve of their attack, instigators from the city of Kokand came to
their region and threatened to set their homes ablaze if they did
not set out for Kimyagar.
   But the Trud report, like past Soviet accounts, did not explain
why the instigators wanted the Turks attacked.
   A. Ansarov, a resident of the village of Komsomolsk, was quoted
by Izvestia as saying that on Saturday ``a bus drove into our
street. I saw how they took a Turkish boy out of the bus _ he was
terribly beaten and covered in blood.''
   Ansarov claimed hoodlums cut the ears off a 10-year-old boy in
his neighborhood, and said he and his family were saved because they
were concealed by their Uzbek neighbors.
   According to Krasnaya Zvezda, 136 Interior Ministry soldiers have
been injured since the disturbances began.
   According to Izvestia, a 200-bed field hospital has been set up
at the refugee camp to treat wounded Turks who left hospitals in
Fergana because they were afraid to stay there. Soldiers guarding
the refugees have turned their barracks over to the Turks and moved
into tents, it said.
   But Izvestia quoted Interior Ministry Lt. Col. N. Usmanov as
saying about 20 of the refugees had gone on hunger strike demanding
to be taken out of Central Asia altogether.
   It quoted one old man as saying: ``For how long will we be moved

   Krasnaya Zvezda said the decision had been taken to evacuate
women and children from the camp, and that 400 people had already
been airlifted to a children's camp operated by the Ministry of the

<HEAD>Egyptian Cabinet Minister Makes First Visit to Israel in Two Years</HEAD>

   The first Egyptian Cabinet minister to visit
Israel in nearly two years met Sunday with Israeli officials and
said any Middle East peace plan must consider ``the legitimate
rights'' of the Palestinian people.
   Butros Ghali, minister of state for foreign affairs, was greeted
at Ben Gurion Airport by Foreign Minister Moshe Arens who said he
hoped to gain Egyptian support for Israel's peace plan.
   Ghali, who will spend two days in Israel, met later with Finance
Minister Shimon Peres, leader of the socialist Labor Party.
   Ghali's visit indicated a new effort to improve Israeli-Egyptian
relations that have been cool since the beginning of the Palestinian
uprising in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip in
December 1987.
   The last Egyptian Cabinet minister to visit Israel was Foreign
Minister Esmat Abdel-Meguid in July 1987.
   Ghali also met Sunday with a Palestinian activist who supports
the Palestine Liberation Organization and is opposed to the Israeli
peace proposal for Arab elections in the occupied territories
followed by limited autonomy.
   At a dinner given by Arens, Ghali said a comprehensive peace
``must take into consideration the legitimate rights, the national
rights, of the Palestinian people.''
   Speaking before Ghali, Arens said Egypt was an important factor
in the Israeli plan.
   ``The peace initiative specifically provides for a very important
role for Egypt,'' he said.
   Egypt is the only Arab nation that has signed a peace treaty with
Israel _ the Camp David accords in 1979.
   Israel has urged Egypt to encourage other Arab countries to join
the peace plan proposed by Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir. Egypt,
however, supports an international conference on Middle East peace
that would include the United States and Soviet Union.
   In an unscheduled move Sunday, Ghali met briefly with Faisal
Husseini, a Palestinian politician who heads a study center in East
Jerusalem and supports the Palestine Liberation Oranization.
   Husseini said after the talks at Jerusalem's King David Hotel
that ``the Egyptian position, I believe, supports the Palestinian
position.'' He declined further comment.
   Shamir's peace plan is for elections in the occupied territories
to select Palestinians who would negotiate with Israel on a type of
autonomy.
   The PLO has rejected the plan, saying it ignores Palestinian
aspirations for an independent state. Israel bars negotiations with
the PLO, saying it is a terrorist organization dedicated to the
destruction of the Jewish state.
   Ghali is scheduled to meet with a group of Palestinian leaders
Monday and then hold talks with Shamir.
   Ghali said he will deliver a message to Shamir from Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak.
   News reports have said Israel is seeking a summit meeting with
Mubarak. The last Israeli-Egyptian summit was in September 1986.

   The Rev. Jesse Jackson and Gov. Michael S. Dukakis
marched together in an anti-drug parade and rally that drew
thousands of people Sunday.
   The two former Democratic presidential candidates exchanged only
a few civilities before Jackson addressed the rally in City Hall
Plaza, urging residents to drive drug-pushing ``terrorists'' out of
their neighborhoods.
   ``We don't need no police to drive drug pushers out. We must
drive them out,'' Jackson told several thousand people who attended
the rally, dubbed Boston Against Drugs or BAD.
   Jackson was criticized last week for accepting a $15,000 fee for
the appearance. He said he did not request the money, which came
from business sponsors of the anti-drug effort and was offered to
him by city officials.
   Jackson said the money would go to his political organization,
the Rainbow Coalition, rather than into his own pocket.
   ``Oliver North gets $25,000 for his own personal
aggrandizement,'' Jackson said, referring to speeches given by the
former National Security Council staffer. ``It's perfectly
reasonable (to accept the $15,000 fee) and it's a proper thing to
do. It came from people who can afford it.''
   Before the rally, Jackson and Dukakis briefly marched together in
a parade through the city.
   The meeting was one of the first since between Jackson and
Dukakis since the governor's presidential bid fell short in
November. Aides said they shook hands and said hello cordially but
did not have time for any substantive discussions.

<HEAD>Investment Firm Predicts 8.8 Percent Growth in Media Business</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: For release 6:30 p.m. EDT; Time set by source.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The communications industry will grow at an
average annual rate of 8.8 percent over the next five years, down
from a 9.8 percent yearly growth pace over the past five years,
according to a report for release Monday by an investment banking
firm that specializes in media buyouts.
   Veronis, Suhler &amp; Associates Inc. said the communications
business will generate $251 billion in spending by 1993, up from
$164 billion in 1988.
   It said the projected growth pace will place the communications
business second only to the anticipated 9.5 percent annual growth
rate in the health and medical services industry among the major
segments of the economy.
   John Suhler, president of Veronis Suhler, said the main reasons
for the slower growth in communications from 1988-93 compared with
the 1983-88 period is an anticipated slowdown in the expansion of
spending in cable television, home video and business information.
   Growth in cable television, for instance, should moderate over
the next five years because most households already have access to
cable service and basic cable service rate increases are expected to
moderate, it said.
   It put cable spending growth at 7.7 percent over the next five
years, down from 11.3 percent in the past five.
   Home video growth will also slow as that segment of the industry
begins to mature, falling to an 11.2 percent growth pace in the next
five years from 52.7 percent a year in the past five, it said.
   Spending on business information services will still be the
fastest-growing segment of the comunications business at 10.5
percent a year, but that is down from a 12.1 percent growth pace
over the past five years.
   None of the projections is adjusted for inflation.
   The forecasters said they expect the economy will grow at a 7.5
percent annual rate including inflation over the next five years,
compared with 7.4 percent over the past five years.
   Suhler said that advertising and promotion spending growth should
accelerate in the next five years after slowing in the 1983-88
period when ``the nation's economic focus shifted from expansion to
cost control.''
   ``Such trends run in cycles, and as this one runs its course over
the next five years, higher spending on advertising and promotion
will benefit the advertising-supported segments of the
communications industry,'' he said.
   The broadcasting business is expected to grow at an 8.7 percent
annual rate from 1988-93, up from 8.2 percent over the past five
years.
   Ad spending on the networks should rise at a 6.9 percent yearly
rate over the next five years, up from 6.2 percent over the past
five, while spending at local TV stations should edge up to 9.8
percent a year, up from 9.7 percent.
   The rate of audience decline for the three major networks is
projected to moderate between 1988 and 1993 because of lower growth
in cable television and independent stations.
   The networks' share of the prime time audience fell to about 68
percent last year, down from 81 percent in 1983, but Veronis Suhler
expects it will dip to only 63 percent by 1993.
   Spending on radio is expected to grow 9 percent a year in the
next five years, up from 8.3 percent in the past five, the study
said.
   In the newspaper business, spending is expected to grow at an 8.1
percent rate in the next five years, including an 8.6 percent yearly
increase in advertising spending and 6.2 percent annual growth in
circulation.
   That compares with a 7.7 percent growth rate overall in the past
five years, including 8.6 percent in advertising and 4.8 percent in
circulation.
   Projections for annual growth over the next five years in other
segments of the industry include:
   _9.9 percent in filmed entertainment including home video, down
from 17.5 percent in the past five years.
   _9.8 percent in book publishing, up from 8.9 percent.
   _7.4 percent in recorded music, down from 10.4 percent.
   _7.3 percent in magazine publishing, down from 7.4 percent.

<HEAD>S&amp;L Bailout Bill Reaches House Floor This Week</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House Republicans are telling President Bush to
take a hike on his demand that all savings and loan operators put
some of their own money at risk as the price for a $157 billion
taxpayer bailout of the industry.
   ``The administration is asking Republican members to go through
the hoop any number of times getting no points for their own
parochial interests,'' complains House GOP Leader Bob Michel of
Illinois.
   As the rescue plan moves to the House floor this week, it was
mostly liberal Democrats scrambling to salvage the key reform in the
president's package _ making all thrift operators put up real money
as capital as a buffer between risky loans and the government's
deposit insurance funds.
   Bush and other industry critics have blamed loose government
regulations and accounting practices that have allowed S&amp;Ls to
attract and lend federally insured deposits with little or no money
of their own at risk as the primary cause of the thrift crisis.
   While Bush proposed stiffer capital standards in general terms,
it was one of the Congress's most liberal Democrats, Howard
Metzenbaum of Ohio, who put a real dollar figure behind it _ $1.50
in capital for every $100 in loans by June 1991 _ when the Senate
passed its version in April.
   The administration immediately embraced Metzenbaum's measure and
asked for more.
   The House Banking Committee complied, adopting the $1.50 standard
by 1991 and upping the ante by telling S&amp;Ls they will have to have
$3 in capital for every $100 in loans by 1995 over the opposition of
most of its GOP members.
   ``So far it looks like the Republicans are more interested in
weakening the president's own bill and the Democrats more interested
in helping him,'' said Rep. Dennis Eckart, D-Ohio. ``We intend to
make it somewhat of a political test.''
   The Senate, meanwhile, is expected to spend most of the week
debating a bill to lift the remaining government price controls on
natural gas.
   Only about one-third of the nation's supply of the fuel is still
under the controls. Experts generally agree prices to consumers
would not rise if it is decontrolled because current market prices
are well below the federal ceiling.
   However, many acknowledge that anticipated increased demand for
natural gas in the 1990s could drive gas prices much higher then.
   The battle over cash investment requirements for savings and
loans underscores one of the differences between banks and S&amp;Ls in
general.
   Even though banks already have twice as tough capital
requirements _ $6 for every $100 in loans and expected to rise to $8
in the near future _ many of the nation's biggest S&amp;Ls cried foul at
raising their requirements and are engaged in an intensive lobbying
effort to knock some loopholes in the bill on the House floor.
   More than two-thirds of the nation's 2,949 S&amp;Ls already meet the
$3 capital requirement. Moreover, all but about 250 of those
expected to still be in business once the immediate crisis is solved
are expected to have little trouble meeting the new standard by 1995.
   However, about 450 S&amp;Ls now have absolutely no cash capital and
it is their losses of up to $100 billion in depositors' money
driving the emerging 30-year bailout plan that works about to about
$600 for every man, woman and child in the country.
   Many S&amp;Ls are meeting the current capital requirements only
through ``supervisory good will'' _ an accounting device regulators
adopted to encourage healthy thrifts to take over failing S&amp;Ls in
the early 1980s.
   More than 730 S&amp;Ls now hold about $20 billion in ``supervisory
good will'' exemptions. Effectively, that allows them to lend out
$600 billion in federally insured deposits with no money of their
own at risk.
   Some of those exemptions were supposed to have lasted for up to
40 years. But the life span of all of them would be whittled down to
five years under the bill approved by the House Banking Committee
and endorsed by Bush.
   The fight appears to be centering on an amendment by Rep. Henry
Hyde, R-Ill., to make the government grant hearings to 241 S&amp;Ls now
possessing ``good will'' exemptions before making them meet the
proposed new standards.
   ``The institutions who relied in good faith on the word of the
federal government deserve some consideration,'' Hyde said.
According to Michel, about 40 of them are in Illinois.
   Rep. Charles Schumer of New York, one of the Democrats leading
the fight to preserve the tougher capital requirements, said Hyde's
proposal could prevent regulators from moving in on unsound S&amp;Ls for
up to 18 months.
   ``This will allow the shysters over and over ... to strip an
institution of its assets before the regulators could move in,'' he
said. ``As we're seeing, it only takes a few bad apples to bring a
whole industry down.''
   Another fight when the bill reaches the floor Wednesday and votes
start Thursday will be over whether to add the immediate $50 billion
taxpayer share of the costs to the federal deficit.

<HEAD>Apple Commission Rejects Call for Labeling Alar-Treated Apples</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WENATCHEE, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Washington Apple Commission has
rejected a call to put special labels on boxes of Alar-treated
apples.
   Commissioners voted instead Friday to ask growers to approve an
emergency assessment of 25 cents a box to pay for additional
advertising to move the remaining 1988 crop.
   Some 12 million boxes of Washington apples are in storage now,
about 4.5 million more than last year. To sell that inventory before
the 1989 crop arrives will require moving about 682,000 boxes of
apples a week, executive director Tom Hale said. That compares to
the past two summers' average of 425,000 boxes a week, he said.
   The emergency assessment must be ratified by growers, and then
come back to the commission for final approval. It would be in
effect only between July 1 and Aug. 30.
   The manufacturer of Alar, Uniroyal Chemical Co., announced June 2
it was taking the substance off the U.S. market immediately to help
rebuild consumer confidence.
   Alar is the marketing name for daminozide, a growth regulator
that enhances the appearance of apples and increases their shelf
life. It was labeled a possible carcinogen by the private Natural
Resources Defense Council in a February report. The Environmental
Protection Agency subsequently announced it plans to ban Alar next
year.
   The commission's advertising money is depleted now, but a
proposed $2 million supplemental advertising program funded by the
assessment would promote apples as a portable summer fruit, and try
to lure customers with sweepstakes and cash prizes.
   The commission had sent a questionnaire to growers, asking, in
part, whether ``All Washington apple cartons should be labeled
`Alar' or `No Alar' for the remainder of the 1988 crop.''
   In the results announced Friday, 689 growers said yes and 734
said no.
   Several commissioners said they thought segregating Alar-treated
apples would be harmful to the industry. They also said it would be
counterproductive to the commission's plan to erase the word
``Alar'' the public's mind.
   The Alar controversy already has cost Washington growers more
than $77 million this year, and nationwide has cost growers more
than $100 million, Hale has said.

<HEAD>Amway President: If He Can't Buy Avon, `We'll Just Beat 'Em'</HEAD>

<DATELINE>GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Amway Corp. President Richard DeVos
has taunted Avon Products Inc. for rejecting Amway's recent takeover
bid, telling a company convention crowd that if Amway can't join
them, ``we'll just beat 'em.''
   The thousands of Amway distributors roared in approval Saturday
as DeVos joked the company's new motto may be ``Sponsor An Avon Lady
Today.''
   About 7,500 of Amway's approximately 1 million independent
distributors worldwide attended the two-day annual convention at the
Amway Grand Plaza Hotel.
   The convention, commemorating the 30th anniversary of the
Ada-based company, comes about a month after Amway teamed up with
corporate raider Irwin Jacobs to buy a 10.3 percent stake in Avon. A
week later, Amway offered to buy the New York-based cosmetics
company for $2.1 billion.
   Avon rejected the offer, and in a series of stinging letters to
Amway it described the direct-sales company as ``marked by
zealotry'' and said such a merger ``would destroy Avon's good name.''
   Amway withdrew its offer, calling Avon's rejection hysterical,
irresponsible and vicious.
   ``I don't think we'll have to buy Avon, we'll just beat 'em,''
DeVos said.
   After an inspired, evangelical-oriented speech about how Amway
distributors are ``life-enrichers,'' DeVos said of the Avon bid,
``We were only trying to enrich their lives.''
   DeVos, with company Chairman Jay Van Andel, founded the company
in 1959 by mixing laundry suds in their basement.
   ``Instead of seeing what kind of dirt they could dig up, we could
have shown them how to clean up,'' DeVos said of Avon.
   The ``dirt'' refers to an investigation Avon launched into Amway
operations to fend off the bid. It turned up possible financial
wrongdoings by the company's chief executive officer, William W.
Nicholson.
   Amway also is under investigation by the Federal Trade Commission
and Securities and Exchange Commission for alleged illegal stock
activity in the Amway-Jacobs partnership.
   DeVos reiterated his support of Nicholson, who orchestrated the
takeover bid.
   The convention also featured two floors of Amway product
exhibitions, while singer Paul Anka crooned for a standing-room-only
audience of distributors. In beginning his famous ``My Way,'' Anka
took out a sheet of paper on which he had penned new lines to the
song.
   ``How could you flop, when we can shop and not go shopping,'' he
sang, ending with, ``You do it Amway.'' The audience responded with
a standing ovation.
   The privately held company, known for its patriotic, pep-rally
style, reported $1.8 billion in sales in the last fiscal year. Avon
lost $404.5 million in 1988 on revenue of $3.06 billion.
   Amway has distributors in about 40 countries and territories,
selling 300 household and personal care items under the company name
and 4,000 brand name products.

<HEAD>Chrysler Drops Interest-Free Financing For Many Cars</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Analysts say a decision by Chrysler Corp. to drop
2-month-old interest-free financing on most models may be a sign the
No. 3 automaker will adopt other incentive programs.
   Chrysler on Friday altered the incentive package by offering cash
rebates ranging from $500 to $2,000 and interest rates as low as 2.9
percent for the bulk of its car and truck line. The program runs
indefinitely.
   Chrysler's move brings it closer to incentive programs at Ford
Motor Co. and General Motors Corp.
   Jeannette Garretty of the Bank of America in San Francisco said
the move could indicate other incentives are planned.
   ``The issue that is facing all of the manufacturers right now is
with sales not as high or not responding as quickly to the
incentives that have been put out there, the question is what do
they do,'' she said.
   ``Do they have to take them off for a little while in order to be
able to trumpet a whole new this-is-it, end-of-the-year clearance?
There are going to be all sorts of deals.''
   Chrysler began offering interest-free financing on two-year loans
for all of its cars and some of its light trucks on April 3.
Effective Monday, the automaker said, no-interest, two-year loans
would be available only on six cars and trucks.
   During April, about half of the loans written by Chrysler
Financial Corp., the automaker's financing arm, were zero percent,
said spokesman Bob Heath. Figures for May are not yet available, he
said.
   Chrysler's car sales were down 2.9 percent and truck sales were
up 5.5 percent in April compared with April 1988.
   Typically, less than 25 percent of the automobile buyers going
through financing arms of the Big Three automakers choose two-year
loans. Garretty speculated that most Chrysler buyers who chose
two-year loans already were in the car market, and were ready with
large down payments.

<HEAD>Tyson, ConAgra Officials Offer Details of Settlement Talks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LITTLE ROCK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tyson Foods Inc. had agreed to pay ConAgra
Inc. $50 million to back out of a deal with chicken processor Holly
Farms Corp., a Tyson official says.
   According to Jim Blair, chief counsel for Tyson, his Springdale,
Ark.-based company and Omaha-based ConAgra agreed to the deal on May
18, the day before the deadline for Holly Farms' latest auction for
itself.
   However, the morning of May 19, Blair said, ConAgra ``totally
welshed on the deal'' by asking for a $25 million deposit that Tyson
would have forfeited if Tyson had failed in its bid to acquire Holly
Farms, of Memphis, Tenn.
   The deal having failed, ConAgra increased its bid for Holly Farms
to $70 a share later on May 19, a bid which the Holly Farms board
subsequently accepted and which Tyson, the nation's largest poultry
processor, has challenged in court.
   Blair said Friday in a telephone interview that Tyson had agreed,
after extensive negotiations with ConAgra, that ``if we acquired
Holly we would require Holly to settle with ConAgra by paying
ConAgra $50 million.'' The payment arrangement had been suggested by
ConAgra, a major food processor and agricultural supply company,
Blair said.
   Blair said that when ConAgra sought the $25 million deposit on
the morning of May 19, it made him so ``dismayed and angry and
irritated'' that he handed over negotiations to an attorney who
represents Tyson in its effort to acquire Holly Farms.
   The attorney's efforts failed to clear the air, Blair said, and
just as the 5 p.m. EDT deadline approached for the Holly Farms
auction, ConAgra began to transmit via a facsimile machine its bid
for the Memphis company.
   The fax transmission was interrupted when Tyson Chairman Don
Tyson called Michael Harper, ConAgra's chairman, to renew talks,
ConAgra spokesman Walt Casey said Friday.
   That effort also collapsed, ``so we turned on the fax machine''
and resubmitted the bid, Casey said.
   After the Holly Farms board accepted ConAgra's $70-a-share bid
over Tyson's $63.50-a-share offer, Tyson petitioned the Delaware
courts for relief in the 8-month-old battle for Holly Farms.
   As part of the proposed settlement between Tyson and ConAgra,
ConAgra would have dropped its insistence on enforcing the asset
lockup agreement Holly Farms granted it in November. The agreement
gives ConAgra the right to buy some of Holly Farms' most valuable
assets in the event ConAgra does not acquire Holly Farms,
effectively blocking any other company from acquiring Holly Farms.
   The lockup agreement is at the heart of Tyson's court claims that
it has never had a fair shot at bidding on Holly Farms.
   The three companies are now waiting for a trial date to be set
for Tyson's challenge to the lockup.

   Printing presses, newsroom computers and other
equipment filled two New Orleans convention centers at the opening
of the American Newspaper Publishers Association technology
exposition.
   More than 300 exhibitors spread out over 320,000 square feet to
show off the latest equipment for the big business of newspapering.
   ``I'm a little overwhelmed. There's a lot to see. It's very
impressive,'' Alix Cohen of The Daily Press in Newport News, Va.,
said Saturday, the first day of the exhibition.
   As many as 15,000 people are expected to attend the five-day ANPA
``Protocols for Progress'' convention, said registration manager
Ernest King. The formal conference gets under way Monday and
concludes Wednesday.
   The meeting coincides with the International Federation of
Newspaper Publishers conference, also in New Orleans Monday through
Wednesday.
   Exhibitors showed how computers can be used to do everything from
laying out newspaper pages to designing graphics. One company even
offers a robot that changes printing plates on the press.
   Cohen said some of the most interesting displays involve ``open
architecture'' systems, computer systems that integrate equipment
from different manufacturers.
   ``I think that's the future,'' he said.

officials as saying that negotiations on trade could not be held
under threat of retaliation.
   Last month, Washington cited India under section 301 of the 1988
trade act for impeding direct foreign investment and closing the
Indian insurance market to foreign companies. The law allows the
United States to impose tariffs of 100 percent on goods from India
if negotiations fail to remove the barriers within 18 months.
   Washington had suggested that negotiations to remove the barriers
begin not later than June 16.
   The United States is India's largest trading partner and two-way
trade between the nations was about $5.7 billion in 1988. India held
a trading surplus of about $700 million dollars.

<HEAD>Head of Italy's Dominant Merchant Bank Indicted</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MILAN, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Italian magistrate has charged the head of
Italy's dominant merchant bank, Mediobanca, with deceitful
bookkeeping, newspapers reported Sunday.
   Milan Investigating Magistrate Gherardo Colombo charged Enrico
Cuccia with registering the equivalent of $17 million under a false
heading in Mediobanca's balance sheets during the years 1976-1980.
   Cuccia and other bank officials have said they are innocent of
the charges.
   Investigators did not reveal the alleged destination of the
funds. Newspapers said investigators believed the money was likely
paid under the table to accountants, construction workers or others
performing services for the bank.
   Additionally, the newspapers reported, the money probably was
used to give bank employees bonuses and to improve ailing balances
of some of the bank's client companies.
   Cuccia, an 81-year-old financial wizard, has headed the bank,
which is part state-owned and part private, since it was founded in
1946. He formally retired in 1982 but has stayed on as honorary
president.
   Investigations into the alledged diversion of funds began about
ten years ago and seemed to have reached a halt in 1984, when
prosecutors recommended the case be dismissed.
   Milan magistrates instead continued examining the case and have
issued a summons for the elderly banker and four other people who
were top officials of the bank during the second half of the 1970s.

<HEAD>Kemp Upset By Allegations That Millions Embezzled From HUD</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: New throughout to UPDATE with Kemp reported upset by allegations,

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Jack
Kemp is ``very upset'' by allegations that millions of dollars were
embezzled from the department by private escrow agents, including
claims by a Maryland woman that she siphoned off $5.5 million to
give to the poor, a HUD official said Sunday.
   Kemp ordered HUD Inspector General Paul Adams to conduct an
immediate investigation of alleged embezzlement in HUD's Washington
field office and on Friday Kemp placed four employees on leave
without pay, Frank Keating, HUD's general counsel-designee, said.
   The Washington Post reported the embezzlement losses could reach
$10 million in the Washington office, while The New York Times said
investigations also were under way in HUD offices in Denver,
Houston, New Orleans and Los Angeles about million-dollar diversions.
   In Texas, Reba Louise Lovell has been indicted on charges she
embezzled $2.5 million from the sale of 55 homes in the Dallas area.
   A two-year investigation in the Washington office led to an
inspector general's audit.
   Marilyn Harrell, an escrow agent in Maryland whom federal
investigators have dubbed ``Robin HUD,'' claimed that
extraordinarily lax management allowed her to divert as much as $5.5
million during a four-year period to help feed, clothe and house the
poor in Washington.
   ``I figured that as long as I was going to go to jail anyway, I
would help a few people with the time I had left,'' the 46-year-old
Temple Hills, Md., resident told the Times.
   In a telephone interview with The Associated Press on Sunday,
Keating said that based upon what he has read in the newspapers,
``I'm outraged, and I know the secretary is extremely upset that
acts like this could take place, although as noted all of them
allegedly took place prior to him taking office.''
   Keating would not comment directly on Harrell's allegations.
Attempts to contact Harrell were not successful.
   Keating said Kemp ordered a full investigation by the inspector
general's office and an accounting firm ``to determine the extent of
the problem, suggest remedies and construct a system which will make
this kind of conduct infrequent if not impossible in the future.''
   ``The fact that in Dallas a closing agent could allegedly
embezzle $2 million and not be noticed, the fact that in Maryland a
closing agent could allegedly give $5 million to the poor and not be
noticed shows serious mangement deficiencies, and the secretary
intends to see that that conduct does not recur,'' Keating said.
   The investigation is separate from a congressional inquiry into
allegations that influence-peddling at HUD allowed more than a dozen
former Reagan administration officials to benefit from housing
programs meant for the poor.
   As an escrow agent, Harrell collected money from the sales of
property that had been foreclosed by the Federal Housing
Administration. The properties originally had been purchased with
HUD-guaranteed loans.
   Agents such as Harrell handle the closing on the foreclosures and
turn over the sales proceeds to the government while keeping a small
commission.
   But in 1985, she used some of the HUD money to cover a $37,000
shortfall in her business, Harrell told the Times. When several
months passed without an inquiry from HUD, it became clear to her
the department was so poorly run that it was unable to track the
millions in dollars in payments due from escrow agents, she said.
   She took more money _ as much as $5.5 million, by her estimate _
before anyone noticed. Investigators believe she bought 20 homes and
nearly 40 automobiles for the needy.
   She told the Post in an interview published Sunday that some of
the money may have become ``mingled'' into improvements on her home
that included a swimming pool, a $2,500 wide-screen television and
renovations to her basement.
   But she said she used her home as a homeless shelter and
therefore she could justify the expenses. She said she now has
transferred the home to HUD in an attempt to offset her financial
problems.
   Her scheme began to unravel last year, she said, when a HUD
official in the Washington field office, Everett Rothschild,
detected the diversion.
   Rothschild would not comment when contacted Sunday, but his
attorney, Joseph Scott, was quoted by the Post as saying
Rothschild's suspension was ``an outrage.''
   ``Rothshcild is the person who came in and tried to do something
about this,'' Scott said.
   Rothschild is chief of the property disposition division of the
Washington field office. Keating said Rothschild was placed on leave
without pay along with Margaret White, who heads the office; Robert
Warner, director of housing management; and Charle Womble, a
supervisory loan specialist.
   Harrell faces questioning by a grand jury in Baltimore and says
she is cooperating with investigators trying to track the diverted
funds.
   She told the Times she was relieved her activities finally were
out in the open.
   ``Christians aren't perfect,'' she was quoted as saying.
``They're just forgiven.''

<HEAD>Memo Criticizes Bank's Auto Insurance Charges</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Mellon Bank Corp. attorney warned in a
confidential memo six months ago the bank could be subject to
penalties as a result of some insurance charges imposed on thousands
of auto loan customers in 1987 and 1988.
   Attorney Charles F. Miller said the insurance charges may have
been excessive and even illegal, The Pittsburgh Press, which
recently reviewed a copy of the memo, reported in its Sunday
editions. Miller said penalties could include heavy fines,
forfeiture of interest collected and court-imposed damages.
   The Press said the Dec. 20 memo cautioned that attempts to
correct the problem by refunding money to consumers might result in
class-action lawsuits ``by calling attention to the situation.''
   The insurance charges in question were imposed on an estimated
22,000 Pennsylvania auto loan customers, according to the newspaper.
   The memo was addressed to Paul Mangelsdorf, then an assistant
vice president in charge of indirect lending. He now works for a
bank in Buffalo, N.Y.
   Neither Miller nor Mangelsdorf would comment on the memo, The
Press said. Mellon said in a written response that after
``thoroughly'' exploring the issues raised in the memo, it had
concluded its insurance program is in compliance with all laws and
regulations.
   The Pittsburgh-based bank said it removed two of the charges
cited by Miller from customers' statements earlier this year. The
bank said that action reduced the customers' annual insurance
premium.
   Mellon told The Press it did so because the charges ``did not
offer sufficiently substantial benefits to either our customers or
the bank.''
   The Pennsylvania Insurance Commission has ruled that the type of
insurance referred to by Miller _ collateral protection insurance _
must provide benefits to both consumers and the bank.
   The insurance plan is called ``force-placed'' insurance. Mellon,
like many lenders, requires new car owners to agree to buy physical
damage insurance to protect the bank's collateral, which is the
vehicle. Some banks self-insure on such losses, while others write
off the losses.
   If a consumer allows his private insurance to expire, Mellon
obtains force-placed coverage and adds the insurance premium to the
customer's car loan balance. The interest charged on the premium is
the same as that charged on the auto loan, Mellon said.
   Under this program, a customer's monthly car payment does not
change, so the result is ``a balloon payment'' due when the loan
matures, Miller said. The interest on the premiums also accumulates
until the loan matures.
   John Sinclair, former president of the Mellon Insurance Agency,
said Mellon's program began as a means of cutting high loan losses
but quickly became a money-maker for the bank.
   Mellon lost $884 million in 1987 and $65 million in 1988, but
reported first-quarter profits this year of $77 million.
   Sinclair said he recommended Feb. 7 that Mellon rescind some of
its premium charges and return money to customers. He said he was
fired for insubordination two days later.
   Mellon disputed Sinclair's account of his firing, calling him ``a
disgruntled ex-employee.'' The bank told The Press he was dismissed
for ``appropriate business reasons'' unrelated to ``the product in
question.''
   ``That's nonsense,'' Sinclair replied. ``It was related directly
to the product in question. My position was that if they (the legal
department) deemed the product illegal _ which they did _ it should
have been discontinued.''
