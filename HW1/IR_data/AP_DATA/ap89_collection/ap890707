   At least one jet engine designed
to power the F-16 fighter has apparently been stolen, an Air Force
spokesman said Thursday.
   At least one Pratt &amp; Whitney engine was discovered missing
Wednesday morning by maintenance crews returning to work after the
Independence Day holiday, said Staff Sgt. Louis Arana-Barradas, a
base spokesman.
   KSL-TV in Salt Lake City, quoting unidentified sources, reported
that three of the 20-foot-long engines were taken out through two or
three unmanned security gates over the weekend. The locks on the
gates were cut, the station said.
   Investigators from the FBI and the Air Force Office of Special
Investigations were trying to determine how many of the $2 million
engines were taken from the base nearly 30 miles north of Salt Lake
City, Arana-Barradas said.
   The Air Force's 388th Tactical Fighter Wing and the Utah Air
National Guard's 419th Tactical Fighter Wing, both based at Hill,
fly the F-16.
   The engines also are shipped to Hill from other bases for
maintenance at the nearby Ogden Air Logistics Center. Arana-Barradas
said it had not been determined whether the engine known to be
missing belonged to one of the Hill wings or had been sent from
another base for maintenance.
   Arana-Barradas declined to provide other details of the theft.

<HEAD>Nixon Planning China Trip: Report</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former President Richard Nixon, who reopened
ties with China in the 1970s, is planning to visit China in
September, according to a published report.
   U.S. officials and diplomatic sources were quoted in Saturday's
editions of The Washington Post as saying that Nixon and former
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger were likely to be among the first
prominent Americans to visit China since the bloody crackdown on
pro-democracy demonstrators last month.
   Nixon did not respond to inquiries about his China plans, the
newspaper said.
   Kissinger, who served under Nixon and helped forge relations with
China, was quoted as saying he was considering a ``long-standing
invitation'' to visit China in October to take part in a
government-sponsored investment conference.
   ``I won't conduct foreign policy on my own,'' Kissinger said. ``I
wouldn't do anything without consulting the administration.''
   President Bush has barred high-level official trips to China as a
sign of U.S. displeasure with the massacre in Tiananmen Square. The
order extends only to executive branch officials.
   Nixon's trip to China in February 1972 re-established
Sino-American relations for the first time since the 1949 communist
revolution. He has made three other trips to China.
   Nixon has expressed disapproval of U.S. sanctions, saying that
messages should be sent through private channels asking the Chinese
to show restraint.

   The Bush administration appealed to a powerless
government in exile for permission to board a Panamanian freighter
off Key West and was readily accommodated, leading to the seizure of
3,359 pounds of cocaine, the State Department explained Friday.
   ``Can you tell us which government gave the Coast Guard
permission, Noriega's or the Panamanian government we recognize in
exile?'' a reporter asked during the daily State Department briefing.
   ``The Department of State requested permission from the Delvalle
government through the Panamanian Embassy and Ambassador Juan Sosa
in Washington, and permission was granted,'' spokesman Richard
Boucher responded.
   The United States recognizes Eric Arturo Delvalle as the
legitimate president of Panama. Delvalle was ousted from the office
in February 1988 at the urging of Panama's de facto ruler, Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Noriega, indicted by a grand jury in Miami on drug trafficking
charges, also overturned the results of the May 7 election, which
showed an opposition candidate as the winner. Delvalle was not a
candidate.
   The United States responded to the election fraud by sending in
American troops to bolster the 10,000 or so soldiers already there,
withdrawing the U.S. ambassador and cutting the U.S. Embassy staff.
   The U.S. Coast Guard boarded the Panamanian freighter Thursday
night and found the hidden sacks of cocaine. Transportation
Secretary Samuel Skinner put the street value of the drugs at $129.5
million.
   Adm. Paul Yost boarded the 162-foot captured freighter at Key
West on Friday and praised the interception, saying: ``What this
means is that we have begun to coerce the smuggler back out on the
sea, and out of the air.''
   The Customs Service said the ship's position, off the direct
route to the Dominican Republic, aroused suspicion. But an initial
search of ship failed to turn up anything, officials said.
   ``The U.S. State Department went to the Panamanian Embassy in
Washington, and we were given approval to go ahead and board the
ship,'' Coast Guard Lt. Jeff Karonis said in Florida.
   In Panama, government authorities said Friday they were satisfied
that the U.S. Coast Guard had captured a drug-running vessel but
were upset that Washington had gotten permission from the Delvalle
government.
   ``We are very happy that the Americans have made this capture,''
said David Carrera of the prosecutor's office. He added, ``We are
annoyed about the manner'' that they sought permission.
   The United States and Panama have had an anti-drug agreement
since 1976 which mandates cooperation from both sides.
   In Washington, a reporter at the State Department briefing
pressed the issue: ``Is the United States' view that the Delvalle
government in exile has the authority to grant permission for
interception of a ship? Is the United States' view that the Delvalle
government in exile has the authority to grant permission for any
sort of military or paramilitary activity such as the use of Coast
Guard forces to stop shipping to and from Panama?''
   Boucher said: ``If we decide we're going to try to board the
vessel, we go to the government and get permission. We certainly do
recognize the Delvalle government as the government of Panama, and
we recognize, therefore, that they have the authority to give us
permission, and then we board the vessel.''

   It's not exactly all work and no play,
but many who live in the Soviet bloc nations of Eastern Europe say
they rarely have either the time or money for recreation.
   ``It is hard to have free time in Poland,'' said a woman who held
a child in each hand as she left a market hall in central Warsaw.
``We have to stand on line and there is nothing in the stores.''
   Romanians often spend up to five hours a day waiting in line for
food because much of the food produced there is exported.
   ``Practically, I have no leisure time _ with work, the home, the
kids,'' a Warsaw businessman said.
   Some Eastern Europeans work as many as three jobs. An air traffic
controller in Poland might also work as a nightclub bouncer, or a
university teacher might moonlight as an exterminator.
   While stores and markets in Hungary are well-stocked with fresh
produce and meat, other consumer items and appliances are in short
supply. Hungarians have grown accustomed to working as long as 16
hours a day to provide needed services.
   Ibolya Kuzsel, a Hungarian woman with a 12-year-old daughter, has
run her husband's workshop since he died last year. Kuzsel rises at
5:30 each morning to do her chores before work; her evenings are
spent on the accounting. Saturdays, she goes to the cemetery.
   ``I have little time for my daughter,'' she said.
   President Bush will spend four days in Poland and Hungary, the
first visit to the Warsaw Pact nations by an American president
since 1977.
   Many Eastern Europeans find inexpensive recreation in television
or weekend trips to the country. And statistics show that alcohol is
a popular escape, despite attempts throughout the bloc to curb its
use.
   Hungarians spend an average of one month's salary on alcohol each
year. That nation has the highest alcohol-related cirrhosis
mortality rate in Europe. Romania is second.
   Western television, especially popular detective series, provides
diversion.
   Those in Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland who can afford it can
buy satellite dishes to pick up Western stations. Soviet television
provides variety for some residents of Romania and Bulgaria.
   Weekend houses or bungalows are popular for residents of
Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland. But even weekends mean work.
   ``We just harvested 100 kilos (220 pounds) of cherries and 400
kilos (880 pounds) of green beans,'' said a young Hungarian
entrepreneur who spends her work week in her tiny toy shop in
Budapest.
   She will can the garden produce for the winter.
   Real vacations are often too costly for most Eastern Europeans to
even consider. A week's vacation in a modest setting for a Polish
family of four could cost three times the average monthly salary.
   Liberalized travel laws are allowing Hungarians more access to
the West, with reasonably priced bus tours to Turkey or Greece
costing about $210. The state travel agency also offers more
exclusive trips, such as a three-week vacation to Australia for
$4,840.

   Abortion advocates have staked out New Jersey for the first true
test of their punch at the polls, saying they'll hit the hustings
and slug it out on the airwaves in an all-out effort to elect a
pro-choice Democrat as governor.
   ``Abortion is going to be smack dab in the middle of this
election,'' said Linda Bowker, state chief of the National
Organization for Women. With so few political races this year, ``we
are going to be the target state,'' she said.
   This week's upheaval in abortion law has jarred other 1989
campaigns, particularly the Virginia gubernatorial and New York
mayoral elections. But it is in New Jersey that the issue has risen
quickly to the political fore.
   New Jersey's race, like Virginia's, pits an anti-abortion
Republican against a pro-choice Democrat. In New York, pro-choice
Democratic Mayor Edward I. Koch is attacking the neutral stand of
Republican Rudolph W. Giuliani.
   ``People who believe in a woman's right to abortion ... ought to
be fearful of Rudy Giuliani,'' Koch has said. A Giuliani aide on
Wednesday accused the mayor of fearmongering.
   Koch began his attacks on the issue months ago, but abortion
gained new prominence as a political issue Monday, when the U.S.
Supreme Court approved of greater abortion restrictions by the
states.
   Pro-choice groups promptly pledged to fight new anti-abortion
laws and to work for the election of candidates who favor legal
abortion. ``In every race, we will attempt to make the right to
abortion the major issue,'' declared NOW President Molly Yard.
   The outcome is uncertain. National polls have indicated that few
voters cast their ballots solely on the issue of abortion, and those
who do split about evenly on both sides of the debate.
   However, given the court's ruling, ``We're dealing with a whole
different environment,'' said Janice Ballou, polling director for
the Eagleton Institute of Rutgers University in New Brunswick, N.J.
``All those people in the middle are the ones that this change might
impact.''
   In New Jersey, Eagleton polling before the ruling found 23
percent support for more restrictions on abortion _ and 68 percent
opposing restrictions. Moreover, many more abortion supporters held
their views strongly.
   That is promising for Democratic gubernatorial nominee James
Florio, who has pledged to veto any abortion restrictions. And it
may trouble Republican James Courter, who has favored outlawing
abortion except in most cases.
   ``If we can have a big win for Florio, that makes a big
statement,'' said Ms. Bowker. ``And if we can do well in the
Assembly races, that makes an even bigger statement.''
   Her plan of attack: A hit list of abortion opponents in the state
Assembly, a series of pro-choice rallies across the state, radio
advertising criticizing Courter on the issue _ and two new telephone
lines at NOW state headquarters in Trenton.
   Courter, for his part, is playing down abortion's significance,
with an aide saying Wednesday he does not see it as a central issue
in the November election.
   In Virginia, pro-choice advocates say Democratic gubernatorial
nominee L. Douglas Wilder's support for legal abortion has been
equivocal; for example, he opposes public funding for abortion in
most cases. Wilder faces Republican J. Marshall Coleman, who opposes
legalized abortion.
   ``It seems to me that if Doug Wilder's going to win he has got to
be much stronger on the issue of women's reproductive rights,'' said
Ms. Yard, in Washington. ``I think he's been scared by it. Nobody
wins by being scared.''
   In New York, the issue has been raised mainly by Koch against
Giuliani, the front-runner in the polls. Koch has had the city pay
for abortions for poor women who have no other source of funds. He
says Giuliani, who opposes abortion personally, cannot be trusted to
continue the program.
   But Charles Perkins, Giuliani's spokesman, said Giuliani would
continue the abortion funding despite his personal beliefs. Said
Perkins: ``The mayor is spreading disniformation to try to heighten
the fears of women.''
   Abortion, he said, ``is not a mayoral issue.''

<DATELINE>YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Howling wolves haven't
been heard in Yellowstone National Park for decades, but even talk
about them is enough to rile the ranchers and others surrounding the
park.
   The National Park Service's program to educate students across
the country about the role of the wolf in the wild has raised fears
by some that it could lead to the predator's return to Yellowstone's
2.2 million acres.
   ``Wolves are fascinating animals and when you talk to people
about them, you never get a ho-hum reaction. They always have a
strong reaction one way or another,'' said Joe Zarki, a ranger in
Yellowstone's Naturalist Division.
   ``They come with quite a bit of emotional baggage. We are trying
to put some information in the hands of teachers and students: what
(wolves) do, what their behavior is and what sort of role they have
in the ecology,'' he said. ``It is not designed to sell a particular
point of view, it is supposed to give them information so they can
make up their minds on their own.''
   Sen. Alan Simpson, R-Wyo., is among those who see the wolf
awareness program as a way to drum up support for the wolf's return
to Yellowstone.
   ``There is no other purpose for it but to promote
reintroduction,'' Simpson said. ``There are guys in there who are so
(heated) up and so obsessed they can't even see.''
   Turn-of-the-century eradication efforts by ranchers drove wolves
from Yellowstone, and in recent years there has been a drive to
return the animals to the park. Simpson and the rest of the Wyoming
congressional delegation long have opposed the plan, which has the
support of Yellowstone officials.
   Those who want to return the wolves say they would prevent
big-game herds from growing too large and overgrazing. Simpson and
other foes fear the wolves would stray from Yellowstone and prey on
livestock on surrounding ranches.
   Rep. Wayne Owens, D-Utah, has sponsored legislation that would
force the Park Service to study how returning the wolves to the park
would affect the environment. The Wyoming delegation is trying to
derail that effort, too.
   Owens brought a 13-month-old female wolf to the lawn outside the
Capitol in Washington last month to dramatize his campaign.
   The wolf awareness program is being financed by donations from
the Natural History Association, several large corporations and one
unidentified donor. It is meant to mesh with the park's ``Expedition
Yellowstone'' program that prepares students for visits to the park.
   The financing bothers Simpson.
   ``Forget the wolf aspect,'' he said. ``The issue is it is a bad
precedent for interest groups to round up the money to do anything
(through the Park Service).''
   Simpson said the arrangement amounts to federal government
endorsement of a program that he says unfairly stresses the benefits
of having wolves in the park without examining the impact of their
presence as predators.
   The program, launched at the urging of former National Park
Service Director William Penn Mott, is designed to teach students
about the wolf and its habits, not to promote their return to
Yellowstone, park officials say.
   The program teaches elementary and high school students about
wolves and urges them to mimic the animals through classroom
activities such as howling, which wolves use to communicate.
   Students also can join in the debate over the plan to return
wolves to Yellowstone by staging a mock public meeting. ``They
assume the positions of various special interest groups with parts
in the debate,'' Zarki said.
   Not overlooked by the program is that wolves no longer lope
through Yellowstone.
   ``It's not like we hide from the kids the fact the wolves are not
here,'' he said. ``We try to deal with that and why. Most kids know
animals are not as widespread as they used to be and people are in
many cases responsible for that.''
   Zarki conceded that the program may result in letters in favor of
wolf reintroduction, but stressed it is not designed to do so.
   ``I'm not suggesting in the activities that they do that,'' he
said. ``But if you look in the past ... there are many incidents
where students focus on wildlife issues and write to legislators and
action is taken. All we are trying to do is help kids learn a little
bit more about wolves.''

   President Bush has selected Portland, Ore.,
lawyer John E. Frohnmayer to head the National Endowment for the
Arts, The New York Times reported.
   The arts agency dispenses $170 million a year in grants.
   Frohnmayer, 47, is being checked by the FBI and would have to be
confirmed by the Senate, the Times reported in its Friday editions.
   He would succeed Frank Hodsoll, who left in February to take a
post at the Office of Management and Budget.
   Bush passed over several candidates, including Schuyler G.
Chapin, former dean of the school of the arts at Columbia
University; Milton Rhodes, president of the American Council of the
Arts, and Barnabas McHenry, chairman of the Empire State Plaza Art
Commission, the Times said.
   The NEA recently has faced criticism from members of Congress for
some of its projects.
   Most recently, an NEA-supported photographic retrospective,
``Robert Mapplethorpe: The Perfect Moment,'' an exhibition that some
lawmakers said was pornographic, was cancelled before it was to have
opened at the Corcoran Gallery in Washington.
   Other lawmakers have criticized the NEA for supporting the work
of artist Andres Serrano, who depicted in a photograph Jesus Christ
on a crucifix submerged in the artist's urine.
   Frohnmayer is married and has two teen-age sons. He is a lawyer
with a Portland law firm and has spent years working in arts
organizations in Oregon.
   A native of Medford, Ore., he attended Stanford University and
the University of Oregon Law School.

   The business of Hong Kong has been business, not
politics, so when Britain agreed to return the crown colony to
China, the residents did not object as long as capitalism was
protected. After China cracked down on the student pro-democracy
movement, much of that changed. Here is a report from a
correspondent who was in Beijing when the army arrived.

<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The crackdown on dissent in Beijing has
multiplied fears that this vibrant capitalist enclave may wither
under the Communist Chinese rule scheduled to begin in 1997.
   Hong Kong residents watched in horror as Chinese soldiers stamped
out the pro-democracy movement in June, and many responded by
applying for passports and demanding that Britain offer them refuge.
   ``It's a tragedy we have here,'' said Joseph Y.S. Cheng, a
political scientist. ``To most of my friends, there are only two
ways out. One is to emigrate; the other is to keep quiet, keep your
fingers crossed and hope for the best.''
   Britain agreed five years ago to return Hong Kong to China in
1997, when the lease on much of the crown colony expires.
   In return, the Chinese said Hong Kong could keep its capitalist
system and enjoy a ``high degree of autonomy'' for 50 years under a
policy of ``one country, two systems.''
   Since then, the people of Hong Kong have busied themselves with
what they have always done best: making money. The economy achieved
impressive growth that reached 13.5 percent in 1987 and brought
great prosperity to many of the 5.7 million people.
   Economic links with China strengthened dramatically. Legions of
Hong Kong entrepreneurs started factories in adjacent Guangdong
province and hundreds of Chinese companies set up shop in the
territory.
   Such bonds increased the importance of Hong Kong in China's
policy of modernizing and opening itself to the world, a process
widely seen as the best guarantee of the ``one country, two
systems'' policy.
   Then came the night of June 3-4 in Beijing, when the army
attacked and the government acknowledged that hundreds of people
were killed. The assault, and mass arrests that followed, caused
hundreds of thousands in Hong Kong to shed their political apathy
and take to the streets in protest.
   ``It has shown very clearly that there's no guarantee from China.
They are capable of doing anything,'' said Thomas Chan, a researcher
at the Center of Asian Studies at the University of Hong Kong.
   Many people are leaving the colony and companies are evaluating
their future, said Robert Broadfoot, managing director of a
business-risk consulting group.
   A surge in the emigration of skilled workers would cause a loss
of the local investment and personnel needed for the city to grow.
The government estimates 45,000 people emigrated in 1988, up from an
average of 20,000 in each of the previous five years.
   Sharp increases in immigration inquiries and applications were
reported last month by consulates of such popular destinations as
Canada and Australia. Even smaller countries like Jamaica and Belize
found interest growing.
   Diane Harrison, personnel manager of a Hong Kong shipping
company, said three of its 170 employees had resigned to move
abroad, four were planning to leave and 17 had started the
emigration process.
   ``Everybody is worried about the future,'' she said.
   People without the money, skills or connections to go where they
choose are asking Britain to provide refuge as an ``insurance
policy.''
   Officials in the colony say granting the right to live in Britain
is essential to restoring confidence among residents, many of whose
families fled Communist China. Britain has refused.
   ``There is simply no way that the British government could grant
to several million people the right to come and live in Britain,''
Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe said on a recent visit to Hong
Kong.
   He said Britain would take all measures possible to safeguard the
colony, and urged the people not to ``underestimate your ability to
build that future.''
   ``Hong Kong has seen hard times before,'' Howe said. ``You've
always shown the resilience and the resourcefulness to live through
such times and emerge from them stronger than ever before.''
   A recent poll indicated only 6 percent of residents would move to
Britain if given the right, and that most people had no intention of
leaving Hong Kong. Chan said the pro-democracy movement had caused
many to rediscover their Chinese identity.
   The political awakening in Hong Kong touched all levels of
society. In addition to huge street demonstrations, a television
personality organized seminars on democracy and activists collected
volumes of signatures for various protests.
   Revulsion about the Beijing crackdown was widespread, from
newspapers long supported by Beijing to taxi drivers who attached
tiny black flags to their antennas.
   Britain, which some residents say has not done enough for the
colony, appeared likely to speed democratic reform so the people
would have a greater voice in their future. The legislature is
dominated by government officials and appointed members.
   Cheng, the political scientist, has fought a long battle for more
democracy but now says: ``What guarantee will it offer? If Beijing
is ready to crush the students with tanks and machine guns, what's
the point of having a democratic system in Hong Kong?''
   Others believe continued support in Hong Kong for China's
dissidents might be dangerous.
   ``Beijing leaders could perceive a political threat in Hong Kong
that outweighs economic benefits,'' Broadfoot said. ``If Hong Kong
refuses to keep out of China's political affairs, it could be
extremely damaging.''
   Observers say the fall of the hard-line leadership in Beijing, or
enacting a bill of rights and redrafting the post-1997 constitution
for Hong Kong could help the territory's success extend well into
the 21st century.
   But for now, Cheng said, ``almost everyone is very depressed.''

   Tan Kwang Long left a pharmaceutical plant, a
five-story home and the good life behind in Vietnam when the
communists won the war 14 years ago and he fled to this British
colony.
   He thought he had found a home. Then Chinese soldiers crushed
pro-democracy demonstrations in Beijing and he started searching for
a new haven.
   Nansun Shi, a TV producer, was ``just too busy for politics''
before the crackdown. Now she heads a group teaching Hong Kong
residents about democracy and human rights.
   China is to assume control of Hong Kong in 1997 under an
agreement with Britain, but the heavy-handed suppression of dissent
has shocked this colony of 5.7 million and is changing the attitudes
of its people.
   Since the Chinese army assaulted Tiananmen Square the night of
June 3-4, hundreds of thousands of Hong Kong residents have put
aside political apathy and taken to the streets in protest.
   More than 650,000 signed a petition for democratic reforms and a
bill of rights, and demanding that Hong Kong residents be given the
right to live in Britain.
   Callers to radio talk shows have proposed independence for Hong
Kong, while others say it should buy some islands to accommodate its
people. Some residents have started an ``underground railroad'' to
get dissidents out of China.
   Zhang Xuexin, a waiter at the Good Taste Restaurant in the Happy
Valley district, expressed the feelings of many:
   ``I'm terrified of what will happen when the Communists come. My
whole family is; neighbors, too.
   ``I fled China during the Cultural Revolution. I swam here and
risked my neck. After 1978 and Deng Xiaoping, I had a little hope.
Then there was the massacre on Tiananmen. Now I know Communists will
never change.''
   Fear is not confined to Chinese residents. Many of the 100,000
Westerners in Hong Kong also worry.
   ``This is home,'' said Diane Harrison, 44. ``I've spent half my
married life here. I had one of my sons here. This is where I want
to be, but if we don't leave now and it collapses around us after
1997, we might just be too old.''
   Under the 1984 agreement between Britain and China, Beijing
promises to keep Hong Kong's capitalist system intact for 50 years
after 1997. It also agreed to an unspecified degree of political
``autonomy,'' currently being negotiated.
   After the bloodshed in Beijing and ensuing mass arrests, many
people in Hong Kong lost faith that China would keep its word.
Thousands want to emigrate, but some like Ms. Shi say they are
willing to stay and fight.
   Educated in Britain as a member of a well-off Hong Kong family,
she spent her teens ``wearing bobby socks and reading Seventeen
magazine.''
   She returned to Hong Kong in her 20s, got a public relations job
and soon began reporting on high society for television. Later, she
moved to producing movies and TV shows.
   ``I never was political at all,'' she said. ``I had a sense of
what was right, but that covered all spheres. I just didn't think
about politics. That's not what we were taught to do.''
   When China's army attacked the students, she said, ``I was ...
shocked so I couldn't speak, possibly because it was such a simple
issue, which is so rare these days. It's so black and white. It's so
clear who was right and who was wrong.''
   After taking part in demonstrations, organizing a concert and
working on a song for the pro-democracy movement, Ms. Shi said, it
seemed to her that people knew well enough what they were protesting
but not what they were fighting for.
   ``We were shouting `democracy,' `freedom,' `human rights,' but
nobody knew what that meant,'' she said. ``I figured I had to find
out.''
   The result was a series of seminars on the topic by leading Hong
Kong academics.
   Nancy Lau, a nurse who attended a recent Sunday of lectures at
the Hong Kong Teachers' Association, said the program opened her
mind.
   ``It made me want to educate myself,'' she said, holding a filled
notebook. ``Our system teaches us how to be good workers, but not
good thinkers.''
   Wang Qiao, a 65-year-old taxi driver who fled Shanghai in 1954,
said the crackdown in Beijing ``woke people up. It taught the young
people about the Communists.''
   ``They said the same thing in Shanghai in the 1950s: `You can
stay capitalist; we need your help,' all that stuff,'' he said.
``Then they came in and took the factories away and locked up the
capitalists. It's going to be the same story here.''
   Tan, the pharmacist, said his South Vietnamese passport will make
moving more difficult.
   ``It gets so maddening,'' he said. ``I struggled here for 10
years and finally am making a little money in real estate. Then this
happens, the market goes soft and my wife starts telling me it's
time to find a new country.''

<HEAD>Former Candidate for Haitian Presidency Arrested in Bank Scam</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A Haitian exile who ran for president of his
island nation in 1987 was arrested Thursday on charges he operated a
bogus bank that may have bilked customers out of tens of millions of
dollars, a federal prosecutor said.
   Clemard Joseph Charles, who was granted asylum in the United
States nine years ago, and three others purported to run the Banque
Commerciale D'Haiti from a home in Queens and a mortgage company
from a luxury apartment overlooking Central Park in Manhattan,
authorities said. Neither concern was authorized to operate in the
state.
   U.S. Attorney Andrew J. Maloney said the victims of the scheme,
which ran for about two years, ranged from drug dealers to
international financiers.
   ``What makes this operation so unusual was the brazenness, the
chutzpah,'' Maloney said. ``They never moved out of a location, they
never left town. That makes it a little extraordinary.''
   Investigators will not know how many people and financial
institutions were cheated and how much money the scams earned until
records seized by FBI agents during raids Thursday are examined,
Maloney said.
   The bank apparently cheated its customers out of tens of millions
of dollars, said Assistant U.S. Attorney Charles W. Gerber, adding
``we don't really have a handle on it.''
   In one complex transaction, the bank recently issued bogus
multimillion-dollar letters of credit payable to the Palestine
Liberation Organization and the economic ministries of Iraq and
Libya, Maloney said.
   The letters of credit for $2 million each from the PLO and the
two countries were used to finance the campaign of a politician from
the Dominican Republic, Haiti's neighbor on the Caribbean island of
Hispaniola, according to Maloney.
   According to court papers, the scheme began to unravel last
October when National Westminster Bank USA attempted to regain
losses on a $5 million letter of credit issued by Banque Commercial
D'Haiti.
   Maloney said he could not yet explain how the phony bankers had
managed to continue to operate without detection or retaliation.
   Authorities said Charles, 66, came to this country in 1980 after
he was freed from a Haitian jail where he spent 10 years for
opposing former President Francois ``Papa Doc'' Duvalier. Charles
was one of 35 presidential candidates in the violently aborted Nov.
29, 1987 general elections.
   If convicted of bank fraud and other charges, Charles and the
others would face at least 10 years in jail, heavy fines and
forfeiture of property purchased with their earnings, Maloney said.
   He identified the other suspects, all listed as officials of the
bank, as Arthur Aye, 74; Charles' son, Victor, 43, and Peter Hall,
50. All are from New York.
   Aye was freed on a $100,000 secured bond, but U.S. Magistrate
Carol Bagley Amon ordered the others held pending a hearing on
Tuesday.

<TEXT>
   A weather-related photo session for an
Anniston newspaper nearly turned into tragedy when rushing waters
swept a woman through a flooded 50-foot culvert and her would-be
rescuer was trapped by the current.
   Neither Angie Shockley, a 24-year-old employee of the Golden
Springs Community Center in Anniston, nor Paul Kennedy, 32, of
Anniston was seriously injured Wednesday. Kennedy was treated at
Regional Medical Center and released.
   Miss Shockley was posing for a rain-related feature for Anniston
Star photographer Eddie Motes when she stepped into a flooded ditch.
She was swept under the water when she attempted to reach higher
ground.
   ``You couldn't tell how deep the water was,'' Motes said. ``She
fell in up to her shoulders and was smiling, then she disappeared.''
   Kennedy, who was watching the photo session, jumped in after Miss
Shockley.
   ``When he jumped in, I noticed she'd washed up on the other side
(of the culvert),'' Motes said. ``It just happened so quickly.''
   By then, Kennedy had been slammed against the culvert and was
pinned by the current. A group of basketball players left the
community center's gymnasium to help free Kennedy.
   But it took the Anniston Rescue Squad, a chain and bystanders'
help to save him. At one point, Anniston Fire Department personnel
attached a breathing apparatus to Kennedy so he could be lowered
temporarily under water during the rescue operation.

   NBC extended its winning streak in the Nielsen
television ratings to 54 weeks as the network's ``Cheers'' tied
ABC's ``Roseanne'' for first place.
   Altogether, NBC captured seven slots in the Top 10. ABC had three
shows at the top. CBS was squeezed out.
   In the week that ended July 2, the two top-rated shows were
closely followed by another NBC comedy, ``Dear John,'' which placed
third.
   NBC won the A.C. Nielsen Co. ratings with an average of 11.9, ABC
had 8.5 and CBS had 8.3. For the season to date, since Sept. 19, the
ratings are NBC 15.2, ABC 12.2 and CBS 12.1.
   The rating is a percentage of the estimated 90.4 million homes in
the United States with television. The share is a percentage of sets
in use.
   The Top 10: NBC's ``Cheers'' and ABC's ``Roseanne,'' tied for
first; NBC's ``Dear John,'' third; NBC's ``Different World'' and
``L.A. Law,'' tied for fourth; NBC's ``Night Court,'' sixth; NBC's
``The Cosby Show,'' seventh; NBC's ``Empty Nest,'' eighth; ABC's
``Wonder Years'' and ``Coach,'' tied for ninth.
   CBS did have two shows in the next 10, ``Murder, She Wrote'' in
16th place and ``60 Minutes'' tied for 19th place with NBC's
``Hunter.''
   ``Doctor, Doctor,'' a CBS summer series was 37th in the ranking.
   ABC and CBS tied for first among the nightly news shows. Each had
a rating of 8.7. NBC was third with 8.2.
   Fox's ``Married ... With Children'' was in a three-way tie for
46th place and its ``America's Most Wanted'' series was in a two-way
tie for 52nd.
   The lowest-rated network show was ABC's ``Have Faith,'' which
collected a lower rating than five shows on Fox Broadcasting Co. The
bottom network shows were CBS' ``Paradise'' and ABC's Thursday Night
Baseball, tied, CBS' ``B-Men,'' CBS' ``Tour of Duty,'' ABC's ``Great
Circuses of the World'' and ABC's ``Have Faith.''

   Attorneys for photographer Ansel Adams' estate
argued in federal court Thursday that publishers of a book of Adams'
pictures taken for the federal government during World War II
engaged in false advertising.
   They sought to ban the sale of a calendar and desk reference book
based on the same material, which is entitled, ``The Mural Project''
and said the book publishers wrongly used Adams' name to sell their
book.
   Attorney Thomas Mustin, representing the trustees of the Adams
estate, said the trustees did not publish the pictures in question
because they felt the quality was not representative of Adams' work.
   The publishers ``are in it for the money,'' Mustin argued. ``The
trustees are in it for the reputation of Ansel Adams. My clients
want to preserve the integrity and quality of the work. ''
   But attorney Richard A. Wallen, representing Day Dream Publishing
Inc. of Santa Barbara, said the only reason the quality of the
pictures is not good is because the negatives are unavailable. The
authors of ``The Mural Project'' John Armor and Peter Wright, claim
the negatives are being hidden by the trustees.
   The pictures themselves are in the public domain and can be
purchased from the government for about $10 apiece. They were shot
in 1941 and 1942 when Adams was working for the National Park
Service, photographing park scenes to be blown up for murals in
public buildings. The murals were never made.
   Interior Secretary Harold Ickes had hired Adams for $22.22 a day
plus expenses, and the photos became government property.
   U.S. District Judge William Keller said there is no dispute that
the photos are in the public domain and Mustin said the trustees are
not challenging publication of the book itself.
   ``We are not challenging the book in these proceedings because we
understand it is already in the stream of commerce,'' he said. ``The
toothpaste is out of the tube.''
   But they seek to stop distribution of the calendar and datebook
and further use of Adams' name in advertising.
   The ad in question described the photos as ``The finding of an
unknown body of work by Ansel Adams'' and compared it to the
discovery of ``an unknown play by William Shakespeare, an unknown
symphony by Beethoven.''
   The trustees claimed this was misleading. But the judge disagreed.
   ``The fact is that this was and is a commissioned body of work
and it was not available until the ferreting out by Armor and
Wright,'' he said. ``I'm not inclined to believe from a practical
standpoint that this is misleading advertising.''
   The legal arguments on further points of dispute were continued
until Friday afternoon. The judge said he would take the matter
under submission before issuing a ruling.

   A man who asked to be excused to use
the restroom and disappeared before the start of his murder trial
has been convicted in absentia.
   Prosecutor Claudia Koenig said sentencing will be put off until
the defendant, Daniel Howell, is found.
   Defense lawyer Victor Houlon said he will base an appeal on
Circuit Judge William H. McCullough's insistence on proceeding with
a jury trial.
   ``I told the judge I didn't have a prayer of getting a not-guilty
verdict because the jury wouldn't look kindly on his absence,'' said
Houlon.
   McCullough ruled that only the defendant could waive his right to
a trial by his peers.
   In Maryland, trials in absentia are ``extremely rare,'' said
Robert Harvey, chief of criminal trials in the state attorney's
office. ``There have been a few minor cases, but I'm not aware of
any murder cases.''
   Howell, a Jamacian citizen who lived in Glenarden, was convicted
of killing Collin Phelmin Branford, 31, in a dispute over drugs.
   Howell's trial on murder and handgun charges began June 28, one
day after he fled. He was convicted last week after five hours of
deliberations and is sought by the Prince George's County Sheriff's
Department.
   ``He said, `I have to go to the bathroom,' and he kept on
going,'' Houlon said.

   Actor Dan Aykroyd went from ghostbuster to
speedbuster when he was stopped for driving 83 mph, but his demeanor
would have made Sgt. Joe Friday proud.
   Aykroyd knew the routine from his role in the movie ``Dragnet.''
Just the facts, please.
   ``He said he'd become hypnotized by the road after driving so
long,'' said state Trooper L.J. Pitula, who stopped Aykroyd about
6:40 a.m. Thursday, for exceeding the 65 mph speed limit on
Interstate 85 in Gaston County.
   Aykroyd, one of the stars of ``Ghostbusters II,'' was one his way
from Atlanta, where he was filming a movie, to his home in
Massachusetts in his gray 1984 Mercedes. He told the trooper he had
been driving for most of the night.
   Pitula said when he realized the driver was Aykroyd, he got a
small case of stage fright himself.
   ``He was absolutely 100 percent a gentleman,'' Pitula said. ``He
used no influence whatsoever.''
   After Aykroyd autographed the ticket, the actor followed the
trooper on the 10 minute drive to the Gaston County Courthouse where
he posted a $56 bond, promising to appear when his case comes up.

   The Readers' Guide to Periodical Literature has
more listings for Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis than any other living
American woman, but many of her friends say most of what's written
about her is inaccurate.
   Mrs. Onassis, who turns 60 on July 28, is most often portrayed as
``snooty, spiteful, greedy ... the original material girl,'' wrote
Edward Klein, who interviewed more than 60 of her friends for a
profile in the August issue of Vanity Fair magazine.
   ``The Jackie they know has managed to preserve her dignity
through an ordeal by the press such as no other woman in this
century has had to undergo, and she has also _ whatever her faults _
triumphed as a mother and as a professional person.''
   Klein, who has known Mrs. Onassis for 12 years, wrote that she is
still concerned about her appearance: She exercises, has her own
private yoga instructor, and had a face lift last April.
   He also said she has amassed a fortune estimated at close to $200
million.

   The Jordanaires, whose harmonic voices
backed Elvis Presley, Ricky Nelson and others on thousands of
recordings, are among 10 finalists for induction into the Country
Music Hall of Fame.
   The Country Music Association announced Thursday that the
four-man quartet will be joined in the open category by Tennessee
Ernie Ford, the Louvin Brothers, George Morgan and Hank Thompson.
   Nominated in the non-performing category are Don Law, Ken Nelson,
Jack Stapp, Cliffie Stone and Irving Waugh.
   One from each category will be inducted Oct. 9 during the
nationally televised Country Music Association awards show.
   The Jordanaires were formed in Springfield, Mo., in 1948.
Initially a barbershop quartet performing mainly gospel material,
the group began a long and extremely successful association with
Presley in 1956.
   Ford, ``The Ol' Peapicker,'' is known for his hit record
``Sixteen Tons'' and his long-running TV program.
   The Louvin Brothers were country music's top brother act from
1951 to 1963, when they broke up.
   Morgan, who died in 1975, was a Grand Ole Opry star known for his
hit ``Candy Kisses.''
   Thompson sold more than 30 million records, including his top
hit, ``The Wild Side of Life.''
   Inductees will be chosen by a panel of about 350 people who have
at least 10 years of experience in the country music industry.

followers he carries no religious authority.
   A group of Buddhist monks and others celebrated his birthday on
Thursday with birthday cake, a tree planting ceremony, luncheon and
traditional Tibetan dancing in Malibu.
   ``We even sang `Happy Birthday' to the Dalai Lama, although they
don't do that in Tibet,'' said Betty Rogers, spokeswoman for the
religious leader's trip to Los Angeles.

   For Britain's queen mother, it was deja vu.
   She rededicated the same highway, made a royal departure in the
identical Lincoln LeBaron convertible, and was presented again
Thursday to the youngest reporter to cover the royal tour across
Canada in 1939.
   Reliving a part of the first tumultuous visit by a reigning
monarch and his consort on a five-day trip that began in Ottawa on
Wednesday, the 88-year-old Queen Mother Elizabeth expressed
disbelief that half a century had passed.
   ``When I arrived at the International Airport yesterday evening,
I could hardly believe that it is some 50 years since the royal
train pulled into north station, and the king and I had our first
sight of this exciting city,'' a beaming queen mother told hundreds
gathered on the lawn at the Ontario Legislature.

   Prosecutors are considering possible
criminal action in the loss of $2 million of federal housing funds
in Alabama that apparently were used to buy luxury items such as a
Mercedes, a speedboat, jewelry and furs.
   Department of Housing and Urban Development documents obtained by
The Associated Press allege that Montgomery real estate broker Cy
Walker spent the money over a three-year period by using a stack of
blank wire transfer authorization forms.
   HUD's Birmingham office, without a system to double-check on the
receipt of funds from HUD closings, thought the $2 million from 63
sales closings went to its central office account, according to
agency records. In fact, the money was in a First Alabama Bank
account controlled solely by Walker, according to a HUD audit.
   Housing officials in Alabama tightened controls over HUD money on
Nov. 9, 1987, after they discovered the money was missing. That same
day Walker closed out the First Alabama account, withdrawing the
last $136.54.
   The FBI has turned its investigative file over to the U.S.
attorney for possible prosecution. U.S. Attorney Jim Wilson said he
plans to meet with HUD officials this month to discuss possible
criminal cases.
   Officials with HUD and First Alabama Bank in Montgomery declined
comment on specific allegations in the case. However, bank official
Dave Gordon said it appeared that First Alabama ``has done nothing
wrong, nothing out of the ordinary.''
   AP interviews and HUD records, including canceled checks, show
some of the money was spent by Walker for the following purchases:
   _A $50,000 Mercedes. Laurens Pierce III, spokesman for Jack
Ingram Motors in Montgomery, said salesmen recall that Walker bought
a Mercedes 560 SL convertible. The HUD audit listed nearly $180,000
in checks written by Walker to car dealers.
   _An $18,870 speedboat from Kowaliga Marina. The office manager at
the marina said Walker bought a Stingray _ ``the Cadillac of
speedboats,'' she said.
   _$21,000 was paid to High School Video Memories, a business
enterprise in which Walker hoped to sell video yearbooks to high
school pupils across Alabama. The venture apparently folded.
   Also, he is accused of spending $5,246 on jewelry, $8,255 on
furs, $9,571 on travel and $2,200 for a saltwater aquarium and
accessories.
   HUD is trying to recover the money through administrative
procedures.
   A HUD audit covering August 1984 to November 1987 indicated some
of the money in Walker's account also was spent on HUD-related
expenses such as grass-cutting and maintenance on foreclosed homes,
as well as attorney's closing fees.
   The wire transfer forms were provided by an apparently unwitting
bank employee, according to documents.
   A memo written by Robert E. Lunsford, acting manager of the
Birmingham HUD office in November 1987, said the forms led the
office to believe the bank had wired the money properly to the
agency's central office.
   At the time, the agency had no procedure in place to check
whether it had received the money or not.
   Walker handled sales of HUD's foreclosed homes in the Montgomery
area while he was an associate broker for Rick's Lind-Davis Real
Estate Inc. The firm was sold in 1986 to Johnny M. Portis, who
closed business operations last year. His attorney said Portis was
not aware of what Walker was doing with the HUD money.
   Walker did not return a phone call made to the recording device
on his beeper telephone. The number listed for his residence phone
has been disconnected and Walker has moved from the apartment listed
in the current phone book.
   Montgomery Real Estate Commission records show that he still has
a valid real estate license, but it is listed as ``inactive status''
because he has not been associated with a real estate firm since
Nov. 14, 1988.

<HEAD>Bush Won't be Drawn Into More Nuclear Talks by Gorbachev</HEAD>

   President Bush is rejecting Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's latest proposal for reducing nuclear arsenals
in Europe, saying he doesn't ``want to get off track'' and challenge
hard-won NATO unity.
   Bush says he will stand by a NATO plan, which he orchestrated,
that calls for conventional troop reductions first. Talks with the
Soviets on cutting short-range nuclear warheads would come later,
under the formula endorsed by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
in May.
   As he prepared for next week's trip to Europe, the president told
reporters on Thursday he was not concerned with the Soviet leader's
popularity in Europe, declaring: ``We're not going to get into the
international poll business.''
   Meanwhile, The Washington Post reported today that Bush has
decided to propose a 25 percent pay increases for top career
government employees, with as much as a tripling for a small number
of key specialists. He has endorsed a similar raise for federal
judges.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Thursday night the
White House expected to announce the president's decisions today,
although he could not confirm the figures.
   Bush on Thursday issued a fresh challenge to Gorbachev to remove
Red Army troops from Poland. Bush's initial call, made last week in
an interview with Polish reporters, was dismissed by Gorbachev as
political propaganda.
   ``It's not political; it's a visceral feeling I have on the
question,'' Bush said.
   He conceded Gorbachev had voiced ``a lack of enthusiasm'' toward
his troop withdrawal proposal.
   But he added, ``He's just taken troops out of Hungary. And who
would have said two years ago that would happen? We salute that ...
I think it would be nice to aspire to that kind of situation where
he wouldn't feel troops were necessary.''
   In his meeting with reporters, Bush also:
   _Said he was ``happy'' that former White House aide Oliver North
was not sentenced to prison, but declined to comment further on
North's sentence Wednesday to a $150,000 fine, a three-year
suspended sentence, two years' probation and 1,200 hours of
community service for his role in the Iran-Contra affair.
   _Challenged East Germany and other Soviet bloc countries to
follow the lead of Poland and Hungary in moving toward more
democracy, saying: ``come along with the flow.''
   _Said he would press for a ``broad tactics'' international effort
to clean up the environment at next week's economic summit in Paris,
saying efforts should be focused on ``preventing pollution at the
outset, rather than cleaning it up afterwards.''
   Bush will travel to Poland on Sunday as he begins a four-nation
visit to Europe that also will include stops in Hungary, in Paris
for the seven-nation summit of industrial democracies, and in the
Netherlands.
   Gorbachev, in a speech Thursday in Strasbourg, France, said the
Kremlin would make unilateral cuts in its nuclear missiles pointed
toward western Europe if the United States would agree to speedy
talks on reducing short-range nuclear weapons on both sides in
Europe.
   Bush administration officials suggested the Gorbachev offer was
designed to test NATO unity.
   In May, Bush won allied support for a proposal for reducing both
NATO and Warsaw Pact conventional forces to 275,000 per side. West
Germany went along after initially resisting U.S. efforts to deal
with troop reductions before grappling with the nuclear issue.
   ``I don't want to get off track by reopening the SNF (short-range
nuclear forces) issue when we have a good package that has wide
support,'' Bush said.
   The president said he has no plans to ``go one up'' with
Gorbachev when he visits eastern Europe or to ``try to establish a
popularity level in Poland or Hungary. That's not what sound foreign
policy is about.''
   ``I am delighted that he enjoys popularity in Europe. I am
delighted when he goes to Germany. I am pleased when he goes to
France. It is good for world peace when he takes those trips. And I
expect he will be delighted when I go to Poland and when I go to
Hungary, for we will be well received in those countries.''
   Later Thursday, Bush told a White House symposium on Eastern
Europe he will urge U.S. allies to join in an aid package for the
Polish and Hungarian economies. However, he indicated U.S. resources
are limited, and that the two nations must primarily help themselves
by reforming their own economies.

   As Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev was
heralding improved East-West relations in Bonn recently, East
Germany was exhorting its young people to defend socialism ``with
weapons'' if necessary.
   East Germany's aging leadership is growing increasingly uneasy
over the momentum of reforms in other Warsaw Pact countries, and
over the warming of relations between the Soviet Union and West
Germany.
   ``East Germany's leaders aren't having a very good time right
now,'' said Heinz Timmermann, a foreign affairs expert at Cologne's
Institute for Eastern European and International Studies.
   ``Everywhere they look there are changes going on that threaten
them,'' Timmermann said, referring to political and economic reforms
in the Soviet Union, Poland and Hungary.
   East Germany's state media gave scant attention to Gorbachev's
June visit to West Germany, where he was enthusiastically received
by citizens.
   Better relations between Bonn and Moscow mean more headaches for
East Berlin, which has suffered for years from an identity crisis in
the shadow of its prosperous western neighbor.
   Gorbachev's popularity in East Germany also has posed increasing
problems as public dissatisfaction mounts over the lack of reforms
in the nation.
   Many East Germans look to Gorbachev in the hope that he can help
bring change to their rigidly controlled society.
   But East Berlin, once the Kremlin's staunchest ideological ally,
has begun a campaign to reinforce its orthodox communist views and
has vehemently attacked advocates of change at home and abroad.
   While Gorbachev was being feted in Bonn and Beijing, Margot
Honecker, East Germany's education minister and the wife of the
party Erich Honecker, urged the nation's youth to be prepared to
fight for socialism.
   ``This is a time of struggle,'' Mrs. Honecker told delegates
attending an education congress in East Berlin. ``The times need a
generation of young people who are willing to struggle to defend
socialism ... with weapons in their hands if necessary.''
   East German leaders promptly defended China's June 3-4 crackdown
on the pro-democracy movement, saying violence was necessary to stop
a ``counterrevolutionary overthrow of people's power in China.''
   Security forces beat and detained demonstrators who tried to
deliver petitions to the Chinese Embassy in East Berlin to protest
the crackdown.
   In a rare public attack against a fellow Warsaw Pact nation, East
German officials denounced political and economic reforms in Hungary.
   Joachim Herrmann, a member of the Communist Party's policy-making
Central Committee, said, ``The developments in Hungary fill us with
great concern.''
   ``Under the flag of `renewing socialism,' forces are at work that
strive for the removal of socialism,'' Herrmann said.
   Hungary's Communist Party and opposition groups have agreed to
hold multiparty elections by next summer, and the country has
embarked on bold economic reforms, including more cooperation with
the West.
   East Berlin is equally troubled by political developments in
Poland. State media have largely ignored Solidarity's stunning
victories last month over Communist candidates.
   The ruling Politburo also has stepped up its campaign against
would-be reformers in the East German party's ranks.
   In one of the sharpest official rebukes in a decade, the
Politburo denounced Dresden's party leadership as ``ineffective in
controlling hostile bourgeois activities.''
   Dresden's party chief, Hans Modrow, is considered sympathetic to
Gorbachev's program of economic reforms and glasnost.
   There also are signs the East German government fears that public
dissatisfaction over the lack of changes in its society could lead
to violent street protests.
   West Berlin's Morgenpost newspaper reported on June 30 that East
Germany had nearly doubled the strength of its elite riot control
force.
   Travel restrictions, long in force for visits to the West, also
are being imposed for trips to Poland and Hungary.
   West German news reports have said Hungary is increasingly
reluctant to extradite East Germans if they flee to Austria. The
Hungarians have begun dismantling some border barriers with Austria,
making it easier for East Germans to flee to the West than over the
heavily fortified border between East Germany and West Germany.

   Italy entered its eighth week without a government
today after Premier-designate Ciriaco De Mita, a Christian Democrat,
gave up efforts to form Italy's 49th government since World War II.
   De Mita, whose government collapsed in May, told President
Francesco Cossiga on Thursday that ``political conditions were not
present'' to form a new coalition.
   His efforts apparently were blocked by Bettino Craxi, whose
Socialists were the second-largest party in the former coalition
after the Christian Democrats.
   Cossiga's office said the president ``intends to press for a
solution to the government crisis and solve it as soon as possible.''
   Cossiga was scheduled to start negotiations with party leaders
Saturday. The state-owned RAI television quoted unidentified sources
as saying he would choose another Christian Democrat to try to form
a coalition.

   The State Department is fanning the embers,
trying to keep Israel's peace plan alive as the only feasible way of
encouraging negotiations with Palestinian Arabs.
   But even before Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir bowed to pressure
on his right and set tough conditions for elections on the West Bank
and in Gaza, the outlook for success was not bright.
   The Palestine Liberation Organization, whose implicit support is
essential, had denounced the plan as a ploy to block a Palestinian
state.
   Other Arabs were less than enthusiastic as well. And while the
Bush administration supports Shamir's approach, it does so only on
practical grounds.
   After decades of frustration, the idea is to get Israelis and
Arabs to talk about the future of the territories on the theory that
negotiations develop their own momentum, leading sometimes to
startling results.
   Under President Jimmy Carter's persistent mediation, for
instance, Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin agreed at Camp David
in 1978 to give up all of Sinai, its airfields and his country's
only oil resources in exchange for peace with Egypt.
   Begin, like Shamir, had the reputation of being a hard-liner. But
for the sake of peace with the largest Arab country Begin gave up
all the land and forced Israeli settlers to abandon their homes and
towns in the desert.
   The State Department may have had this history in mind when it
tried Thursday to smooth over the conditions Shamir agreed to a day
earlier in Tel Aviv at the nudging of Ariel Sharon and other Likud
hard-liners.
   Seeking to draw a distinction between a political party's
declaration and a government position, spokesman Richard Boucher
emphasized that the election plan was approved in May by the Israeli
Cabinet.
   He said the United States was dealing with the Israeli
government, and not with a political party whose partisan
declarations do not advance the peace process, ``particularly if
they appear to be more restrictive or impose conditions.''
   The U.S. spokesman urged Palestinians to participate in the
election after fleshing out the details with the Israelis.
   But in Tunis, where the PLO has its headquarters, a spokesman
said Shamir's terms slammed the door on the peace process. ``These
efforts now face total failure,'' Ahmed Abdul-Rahman said.
   The elections would produce Palestinian leaders to negotiate five
years of local self-rule for the 1.4 million Arabs who live on the
West Bank and in Gaza. At the conclusion of this trial period,
Israel, Egypt, Jordan and the Palestinians would work out an overall
settlement.
   Theoretically, all options would be open.
   But Shamir has again ruled out a Palestinian state _ a position,
not incidentally, the United States also takes.
   He also ruled out yielding territory or stopping Jews from
settling in the areas. Moreover, the elections would be held only
after violence ceased.
   The PLO response was to threaten an escalation of the attacks on
Israeli forces that have claimed 546 Arab lives since December.
   ``This is the only answer to intransigence,'' Abdul-Rahman said.
   Even so, the State Department is banking on Palestinians
accepting the election plan partly out of a desire to gain
international acclaim _ a move that would be especially dramatic in
light of Shamir's hard-line conditions.
   That would require a turnabout by the PLO.
   Six months of semi-recognition by the United States have not
produced such concessions from Yasser Arafat's organization. Having
declared his acceptance of Israel's right to exist and repudiating
terrorism, the chairman evidently concluded that was as far as he
was prepared to go.
   Where does this leave the Bush administration?
   Apparently in the same tough spot its predecessors occupied,
trying to find a formula for negotiations in the face of stiff
resistance in the Middle East.
   And yet, Carter's experience at Camp David and the
Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty are evidence that long odds can be
overcome.

   Thanks to entrepreneur Robert Egger, residents
of two women's shelters in a shabby Washington neighborhood will sit
down tonight to feast on salmon, tenderloin of beef, leeks, Japanese
mushrooms and new potatoes, with New York cheesecake for dessert.
   ``Nothing is too rich or exotic for the homeless,'' says Egger,
who runs a non-profit food service for Washington's street people.
``Salmon is a big hit. People love smoked fish and roast beef. Fresh
strawberries are a big-ticket item. Their eyes really light up when
they get strawberries.''
   Egger is founder and executive director of D.C. Central Kitchen,
a two-man operation that collects unwanted leftover food from
hotels, restaurants and catering firms every day and delivers it
within 24 hours to homeless shelters, soup kitchens and churches
around the city.
   ``We're the Federal Express of Washington food,'' says Egger.
   Since his refrigerator-equipped van began plying the streets last
January, Egger estimates he and his partner, Alex Tait, have picked
up 15 tons of unwanted food worth about $60,000, and provided
roughly 10,000 free meals to the poor, elderly and the homeless of
the capital.
   The salmon and roast beef leftovers that Egger picked up from a
catered dinner party Wednesday night for 400 guests at the National
Building Museum are standard gourmet fare on the Washington party
circuit. But they are rarely found in the garbage cans that many
street people rummage through in search of a meal.
   Egger has gotten calls to pick up bags of coconut, pots of
scallop creole, pans of Mexican beans and rice, bowls of pasta and
octopus salad. He gets 20 to 40 leftover pizzas three times a week
from one restaurant chain. When an ice cream store closed its doors
near Dupont Circle, it gave him 48 five-gallon tubs of its frozen
confections.
   Nobody knows how many of the homeless are wandering the streets
of Washington, but estimates range from 5,000 to 15,000 people.
Egger says his operation serves about 30 feeding programs around the
city, with generous support from churches, foundations, corporations
and charities.
   His lengthy list of food donors also includes corporate employee
cafeterias, congressional offices on Capitol Hill, various
Smithsonian museums and galleries, the National Academy of Sciences,
a French bakery (where he gets day-old croissants) and scores of
trade associations and lobbying groups that frequently wine and dine
their clients.
   Every gift of giveaway food is rewarded with a tax-deduction
receipt.
   Egger, 31, has been working in Washington restaurants, nightclubs
and bars since he was graduated from high school.
   He and his wife, Claudia, volunteered _ reluctantly at first _
for a church parish project, in collaboration with other Georgetown
churches, to cook and deliver meals to people sleeping on steam
grates in downtown Washington.
   ``Most people think their actions don't matter,'' Egger said,
``but I realized that with a little bit of effort, you can make a
difference in people's lives. It didn't hurt. In fact, I really
enjoyed it.''
   After a while, Egger concluded it was a waste of money to feed
the homeless ``when so much food is being thrown away.'' He began
soliciting local food establishments for their leftovers.
   ``Then it dawned on me,'' he said. ``Why bother just to pick up
and deliver food when there's this golden opportunity to train
people? While we're feeding people who are waiting in line, we could
train them so they can step out of the line.''
   Egger is busy renovating an abandoned neighborhood cafe in a row
house shared with a women's shelter. It will be the permanent home
for D.C. Central Kitchen.
   Egger plans by August to open the kitchen, where homeless
trainees can learn professional food preparation and use their
experience to land jobs in local hotels and restaurants.
   Egger dreams of owning a nightclub someday. Until then, he finds
nothing quite as rewarding as feeding the homeless.
   ``It's like being Santa Claus every day you take free food to the
people,'' he said.

<HEAD>Harold Prince Directs Mozart's `Don Giovanni'</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Harold Prince, director of Broadway's ``The
Phantom of the Opera,'' directed the new production of ``Don
Giovanni'' which opened the New York City Opera's season.
   After the spectacle of ``Phantom,'' the ``Don Giovanni'' is
surprisingly conventional.
   The problem is devising a set for 13 scenes changing from yard to
meadow to street to ballroom to cemetery.
   Prince did it with pedestals that moved in and out, a footbridge
added in one scene, and a balcony in a couple of them.
   Vocally, Thursday evening at the New York State Theater showed
the company at its best. Conductor Sergiu Comissiona and the
orchestra made the music sound fresh.
   At the beginning of the opera, before Giovanni stabs the
Commendatore, the Commendatore's statue is already on one of the
pedestals. After Giovanni's seduction of Donna Anna, he climbs down
a ladder from an upper story while she runs out from the wings.
Those two points were disconcerting.
   But from then on, except for Giovanni being unusually passive
during his champagne aria, Prince didn't direct with any weird
conceptions.
   This should be a ``Don Giovanni'' that will please enough people
to last a long time at the New York City Opera.
   Nova Thomas made her company debut as Donna Anna, replacing
Elizabeth Holleque, who was ill.
   Miss Thomas made an astounding impression, her voice individual
and interesting at the same time it is clear and pure. Her singing
was lovely throughout, conveying the pure soul of this young woman,
who sometimes comes across as banal or matronly.
   Erie Mills made Zerlina even younger, an adolescent bride-to-be
who isn't a flirt as much as so unexposed to the world that she's
just dumb. Miss Mills' singing, however, was poised and limpid.
   Frances Ginsberg also conquered as Donna Elvira, probably the
hardest of the three soprano parts to make work. Elvira wants
vengeance against Giovanni for leaving her. And she wants him back.
   John Cheek was impressive in the title role. In acting, he made
Giovanni a man who has chosen to be a womanizer and pursues the
ladies with enthusiasm but no unnecessary fuss.
   His voice is commanding though sometimes he mushed the words
together.
   Cheek has been singing at the Metropolitan Opera, mostly in
supporting parts, a status which surely will be upgraded at once.
   Jan Opalach sang Leporello with effortless vocalism. He made
Giovanni's servant much younger than his master, able to jump over
walls and vault to the top of pedestals.
   Dean Peterson made Masetto a more intelligent bridegroom than
often is done. Nikita Storojev, who has been a principal singer with
the Bolshoi Opera, made his New York City Opera debut. He really
sang the Commendatore, not just boom out a hollow sound.
   Jon Garrison presented an uptight, even precious, Don Ottavio,
but sang the part well, with reined-in warmth.
   Rolf Langenfass, who created costumes for the Met's current Ring
Cycle, designed the sets and costumes. Next season he'll work with
Prince on a new production of ``Faust'' at the Met.

<TEXT>
   The Rev. George A. Stallings hates the sight of
empty pews, and that's one reason he wants the Roman Catholic Church
to allow a special rite for black Americans.
   But a black bishop contends that Stallings, suspended as a priest
for creating an unauthorized parish in Washington, could wind up
with a church that is no different from any other evangelical
congregation competing for members and dollars.
   Stallings, who is black, said in an interview Thursday that the
Catholic church is missing the boat in attracting blacks and other
minorities because its hierarchy and traditions are too bound by
European culture and dominated by white males.
   It fails to evangelize _ make converts _ among blacks because it
doesn't train anyone to do so, he said, adding that other religions
are filling the gap.
   ``I have been to cities where the church was closed,'' Stallings
said. ``Black Protestants came in there and took over and now they
are packed to the gills.''
   Stallings said he wants to create a separate African-American
Catholic Rite, along the lines of the ethnic Eastern Rite churches.
Those churches accept the authority of the pope, but have
considerable autonomy in ritual and discipline.
   The unauthorized service conducted Sunday at Stallings' Imani
Temple showed at least one side of what the new rite would entail:
The service combined the traditional Catholic Mass with African
ritual and the foot-stomping, hand-clapping style of the traditional
black Protestant church.
   Baptists and Muslims also attended the service, held at Howard
University Law School.
   Stallings was suspended the next day by Washington Cardinal James
A. Hickey and barred from performing the Catholic sacraments.
   At stake in Stallings' battle are 2 million black American
Catholics, a minority of both blacks _ some 30 million in America _
and American Catholics as a whole _ 54 million.
   According to church figures, there are 300 black priests and 13
black bishops. Of the 17,000 Catholic parishes, 1,200 are
predominantly black.
   Stallings said the Catholic church must develop ``an
African-American Catholic liberation theology'' to address social
and political needs.
   ``It is difficult, if not almost impossible, for one ethnic or
cultural group to define or to decide what is good for another
ethnic group,'' he said. ``It is always necessary for those ethnic
groups to get a seal of approval from the white male power group.''
   But Catholic officials, black and white, criticize Stallings for
his methods and what they say are his unfair attacks on the church.
   ``The father's argument that there is racism in the church has
been acknowledged,'' said Auxiliary Bishop John H. Ricard of
Baltimore, who is black. ``Certainly we have a long way to go.''
   Rather than defying Hickey's authority, Stallings should work
with the cardinal to form a new rite, Ricard said, adding that the
danger is leading a church that is no different from any other.
   ``What Father Stallings is going to find is that, frankly, the
ministers who can perform the preaching styles and rituals in his
church are a dime a dozen,'' Ricard said, referring to the host of
evangelicals crowding the airwaves. ``The Catholic priest gets his
authority from a Roman collar.''
   The Rev. William Lori, Hickey's secretary, also indicated
Stallings needed to work through the Catholic hierarchy.
   ``The difficulty is not that he tried those channels and is
blocked,'' Lori said. ``The difficulty is that he has spurned those
channels.''
   Lori said the church must reject the idea ``that only blacks can
preach to blacks'' and whites to whites.
   However, John H. Cartwright, an expert in black religion at
Boston University, said that's part of the problem.
   ``The church has been colorblind to a fault,'' he said. ``It's
blind to itself. ... You almost need to hold a mirror up to it.''

<HEAD>East Drenched in Best Tropical Storm Tradition</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The intense rain flooding the East Coast from
Washington to New York this week is part of an unyielding weather
pattern aided by remnants of tropical storm Allison, meteorologists
report.
   The weather pattern is unusual, the meteorologists said, but
resembles patterns that flooded parts of Virginia and West Virginia
four years ago and drenched the East Coast in 1972 _ both in the
wake of damaging storms.
   This week's rain disrupted train service between New York and
Washington, swept away a camper in North Carolina and created
generally miserable conditions in the region.
   ``Something like this is somewhat unique because it's a slow
moving pattern ... just kind of stagnating here,'' said David Miskus
of the federal Climate Analysis Center.
   Intense rain drenched a relatively narrow strip from suburban
Washington to suburban New York on Wednesday, meteorologists said
Thursday. From 2 to 6 inches of rain fell in most areas but 10
inches or more fell in some spots, especially in northern Delaware.
   ``It's not a frequent occurrence, but it happens,'' said storm
specialist Bob Case of the National Hurricane Center in Coral
Gables, Fla., pointing to a similar situation that caused West
Virginia's floods in 1985.
   Case said tropical storm Allison isn't directly to blame for the
stagnant pattern, but it has helped keep the East Coast under its
wet blanket.
   Allison came ashore in Texas more than a week ago, worked
northward to western Kentucky and drifted to Alabama, where Case
said it is identified as a low pressure area. The air circulates in
a counter-clockwise direction around lows.
   At the same time and to the north, a high pressure center is
circulating in the opposite direction over the Atlantic Ocean,
leaving the high and the low systems grinding against each other
like two gears, said Case.
   The air flows have pulled warm, moist air northward from the Gulf
of Mexico, said Case.
   ``The real culprit is this inundation of tropical, unstable
air,'' he said.
   Case said Hurricane Juan in 1985 and tropical storm Agnes in 1972
left similar patterns as mementos after they had gone.
   Frank Richards and Scott Kroczyksni of the National Weather
Service's Office of Hydrology explained that on Tuesday night and
Wednesday cold air moved in above the warm tropical air between
Washington and New York.
   The cold air, which was heavier and more dense, sank down,
leading to a sudden overturning of the cold and warm air. ``Once it
started it was almost like a chain reaction,'' said Richards,
explaining the deluge.
   But Miskus said even some of the dramatic rainfall totals
reported in Delaware fail to compare to tropical storm records.
   The most rain from one storm in a single day occurred in Alvin,
Texas, in 1979 when 43 inches fell in 24 hours, he said.
   The latest rain is falling on a region already softened up by
stagnant weather patterns that persisted in May, leading that month
to be the wettest since 1895 in the southeast and the second wettest
in the south, said Miskus.

<HEAD>Sugar Production on the Rise</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. sugar production is rising after a slump
because of last year's drought, according to Agriculture Department
forecasters.
   Total production in the 1989-90 crop year that begins Sept. 1 is
expected to be about 7.3 million tons, up 5.6 percent from 1988-89
output estimated at 6.91 million tons.
   Prompted by prices guaranteed under the government's system of
supports and protective quotas that limit the entry of cheaper
foreign sugar, domestic output climbed to a record 7.33 million tons
in 1987-88.
   In 1985-86, by comparison, total U.S. sugar production was barely
6 million tons.
   With improved growing conditions, sugar production in the coming
year could match or exceed the record level of two years ago.
   Beet sugar production, forecast at 3.9 million tons, would be up
11 percent from the drought-reduced level of 3.51 million tons this
season, the department's Economic Research Service said Thursday.
   Cane sugar, which rose to a record of just under 3.4 million tons
in 1988-89, is forecast at about the same in 1989-90.
   ``According to field information through mid-June, beet planting
and early development have generally gone well throughout the beet
areas,'' the report said. ``This is in sharp contrast to last year
when a series of spring weather problems was followed by drought in
key eastern growing areas.''
   The report added: ``Drought, particularly in the non-irrigated
Red River Valley of western Minnesota and eastern North Dakota, and
disease and weather problems in California, lowered yields.''
   These three states accounted for 55 percent of total sugar beet
harvested acreage in 1988-89 and 51 percent of the total beet
tonnage. That compared with 56 percent and 54 percent, respectively,
during the three previous seasons.
   Yields would have been even lower had it not been for good
growing conditions late in the season, excellent harvesting weather
and higher rates of sugar recovered from the beets, the report said.
   Farmers are expected to have about 1.3 million acres of beets for
harvest in 1989-90, about the same as this season.
   The area for sugar cane harvest is expected to be about 807,000
acres, up 10 percent from 1988-89, reflecting small increases in
Florida, Louisiana and Texas. Mainland production is forecast at
about 2.45 million tons, and Hawaii's output, 940,000 tons.
   ``Hawaii's sugar cane acreage continues to contract, with only
77,000 acres likely to be harvested this season, compared with
almost 100,000 in the early 1980s,'' the report said. ``Alternative
land use continues to encroach on traditional sugar acreage.''

   Hong Kong has turned into a growing market for
U.S. duck feet and tongues, says the Agriculture Department.
   Deep-fried duck feet in oyster sauce, and duck tongues soaked in
fish sauce or stir-fried with seasonal vegetables are some of the
dishes offered by Chinese restaurants in Hong Kong, the department's
Foreign Agricultural Service said.
   The demand for whole ducklings, feet, tongues and gizzards is so
brisk that the local supply can't keep up.
   As a result, the agency said in the July issue of AgExporter
magazine, a number of U.S. poultry plants have built a thriving
export business on supplying the Hong Kong duck market.
   Jim Hoben, an executive with one processing plant, Concord Farms
of Concord, N.C., said U.S. duck processors sold more than 4 million
pounds of duck feet to Hong Kong alone last year.
   ``All of our duck feet and tongues are exported to Hong Kong,''
Hoben said ``That market represents 4 percent of our total business,
and it is a very important market for Concord Farms.''
   Aggressive market promotion in Hong Kong has been part of the
reason for U.S. success in the duck market. The USDA's Targeted
Export Assistance Program, which helps finance approved overseas
promotional efforts, has been particularly effective.
   For example, the program financed a booklet featuring recipes for
duck feet, tongue and duckling recipes for the Hong Kong market,
available there in both Chinese and English, the report said.

   Ice cream production jumped sharply in May,
just in time for the summer rush, according to an Agriculture
Department report.
   With production at 79.8 million gallons, that was up 16 percent
from April and 3 percent from May of last year, the department's
National Agricultural Statistics Service reported Thursday.
   And that was only ``hard'' ice cream. There were no estimates for
soft versions produced by machines across the country.
   But the report did show that ice milk production, at 37.4 million
gallons in May, was up 20 percent from April and 9 percent from a
year earlier. Sherbet production was 5.4 million gallons, up 26
percent and 20 percent, respectively.
   Frozen yogurt output was estimated at 6.74 million gallons in
May, virtually the same as in April. No year-earlier figures were
available.

   Marines guarding the U.S. embassies
abroad are often limited in off-duty activities, but now there's
something for their minds _ college by mail.
   The Marine Security Guard Battalion reached an agreement recently
with Penn State University to offer an associate-degree program to
the 1,450 Marines guarding 141 embassies and consulates around the
world.
   Taking classes by mail will help relieve boredom in such hardship
posts as the embassy in Ouagadougou, the capital of the west African
nation of Burkina Faso, Marine Capt. David Vindich said.
   ``There's absolutely nothing there,'' said Vindich, the
battalion's education officer.
   Also, Marines stationed at embassies and consulates in the Soviet
Union are restricted by a non-fraternization policy, while those in
Beirut can't leave the compound because of the country's civil war.
   ``A lot of these places are really isolated,'' Vindich said.
``We're providing an educational opportunity and we're also giving
them something to do.''
   Vindich said Marines in the elite, all-volunteer battalion
generally spend 15 months in a hardship post and then 15 months at a
less rigorous embassy or consulate.
   More than 400 Marines serving in embassies and consulates already
take courses, but their efforts toward degrees have been largely
unstructured, he said.
   ``They were out there spinning their wheels. You talk college
credits and semester hours and that kind of thing, it boggles the
mind of a 19-year-old kid just out of high school, 10,000 miles from
home,'' Vindich said in a telephone interview from Quantico, Va.
   Under an agreement reached in May, Penn State will offer liberal
arts degrees in letters, arts and sciences. The university has
planned course concentrations for the Marines including business,
security and justice, political analysis and foreign policy, and
language and culture.
   Vindich said he expects 400 would sign up this year.
   An associate degree would cost about $4,800 or $5,000, said Peter
Forster, coordinator of special programs at Penn State's Department
of Independent Learning. Vindich said the Marine Corps pays 75
percent of tuition costs.
   Penn State has the largest university-based correspondence course
program in the United States, offering 225 courses to 22,000
students.

<HEAD>Safety Board Eyes U.S.-Owned Ships Carrying Americans Under Foreign
Flags</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal safety officials want the Coast Guard
to be allowed to regulate luxury cruise ships that are owned by
Americans, carry Americans and use American ports but fly under
foreign flags.
   ``We're not in a position to protect the lives of an American
citizen in these types of vessels, and something's got to be done
about it,'' said Jim Burnett, a member of the National
Transportation Safety Board.
   The NTSB on Thursday issued several recommendations that would
affect more than 80 cruise ships that dock at U.S. ports.
   Only two or three such cruise ships are registered in the United
States, board investigators said.
   The board, which is preparing a more extensive report on the
cruise ship industry in a few months, recently concluded an
investigation into a fire that caused a near-catastrophe aboard a
Bahamian-flagged vessel off the Florida coast 16 months ago.
   The board concluded that a lack of maintenance, lack of
fire-fighting procedures and poor crew training caused the fire
aboard the Scandinavian Star, which was carrying 700 people back to
St. Petersburg, Fla., from a two-day Gulf of Mexico cruise.
   The board said failure of a fire-fighting system and the
inability of crew members, who spoke a variety of languages, to
communicate with each other and with passengers contributed to the
emergency.
   ``It was only sheer luck'' that no injuries or deaths occurred
aboard the 10,000-ton vessel owned by Sea Escape of Miami, said NTSB
Chairman James L. Kolstad.
   ``This is an invitation to disaster,'' said Kolstad. He said
U.S.-owned cruise ships are registered in several different
countries because of the high expenses involved in meeting
requirements as U.S. flag carriers.
   Jill DeChello, spokeswoman for Sea Escape, said the company had
no immediate comment on the board decision. She said the company
operates four 10,000-ton ships, each carrying 950 to 1,100
passengers on cruises out of Miami.
   In the last decade, the board has investigated five major fires
aboard cruise vessels, three of them on Sea Escape ships. One in
1984 killed one passenger and one crew member. Scores of people have
been injured, mostly from smoke inhalation.
   No other deaths have been reported in accidents aboard
American-operated cruise ships, but a Cuban ship captain and two
sailors were killed when the U.S.-owned Celebration cut their
freighter in half Feb. 10.
   The board is seeking court orders to force witnesses to give
testimony in its investigation of the Celebration accident. The
ship's owner, Carnival Cruise Ship Lines, has refused to cooperate
in the safety investigation, saying it is responding only to
authorities in Liberia, where the vessel is registered.
   In Thursday's action, the board asked the Coast Guard, which
regulates civilian shipping, to seek legislation that would give it
authority over the safety of cruise ships.
   The board also called for smoke detectors that automatically shut
down ventilation systems so smoke won't spread through passenger
cabins; improved testing of fire extinguishing systems; back-up
generators for fire alarms, public address systems and smoke
detectors, and several other safety improvements for all cruise
ships. The safety board has no authority to impose its
recommendations.
   The board said the Scandinavian Star fire on March 15, 1988,
started with an oil leak. It said fuel pipe packing seals and
deflector sleeves that would have prevented the oil from being
ignited were deteriorated and had not been replaced.
   ``I'm afraid this ship was being managed more like a night club
than a vessel,'' said board member Burnett, who led the
investigation into the fire.
   The ship, which was towed to Miami after the fire was put out,
has since been repaired and is back in operation.

<HEAD>Auto Industry Unsure Whether Asbestos Ban Will Boost Prices</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Auto industry officials say the jury is out on
whether a government ban on most remaining uses of cancer-causing
asbestos will translate into higher prices for consumers.
   ``The substitute material and system are relatively more
expensive. I can't quote you a figure,'' Toni Simonetti, a
spokeswoman for General Motors Corp., said Thursday shortly after
the government announcement.
   But many companies, including General Motors, have been
substituting other materials for asbestos in products such as brake
pads and linings for several years. Consumers, therefore, have
already paid the price for the change.
   ``We have known that we should be eliminating asbestos from
various parts of our products,'' said Fred Bowditch, vice president
for technical affairs at the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association
of the United States.
   The industry official also said he did not believe the switch to
substitute material would be considerably more expensive.
   In the face of widespread criticism, the Environmental Protection
Agency ordered a ban on asbestos used in a range of items from
automobile brake parts to roof shingles. The prohibition is to be
phased in over the next seven years.
   The ban will reduce the number of asbestos-related cancer deaths
by at least 200, the EPA said.
   The ban, however, does not affect existing asbestos-containing
products. EPA officials expressed concerns that replacing the
hazardous material might be more dangerous than a phase-out.
   The agency first listed asbestos, a natural product that has a
strength 10 times of steel but can be woven like cotton, as a
hazardous air pollutant in 1972 and urged it to be banned in 1979.
   ``The first question I had was why has this thing been around so
long,'' said EPA administrator William Reilly in announcing the ban.
Critics have charged that the Reagan administration prevented
earlier EPA action on asbestos.
   Nevertheless, use of the material has declined significantly. In
1987, 85,000 metric tons of asbestos was used for a wide array of
products, down from the 240,000 metric tons used in 1984.
   Asbestos has been linked with various forms of cancer, including
lung cancer.
   Auto makers have been phasing out asbestos for use in brake pads
and linings, and many said Thursday that the EPA decision came as no
surprise.
   ``A company-wide program to remove asbestos from our disc brake
pads, drum brake linings and other components began in the early
1980s. Since that time, considerable progress has been made,'' said
Victor H. Sussman, an official at the Ford Motor Co.
   Ford is aiming for a total phase-out of asbestos in its North
American passenger cars by 1993 for 1994 models.
   General Motors, meanwhile, produces front disc brakes that are
almost all asbestos-free. However, 75 percent of the company's cars
and half of its small trucks have rear drum brakes with asbestos
pads and liners.
   Under the ban, the use of asbestos in some products, including
roofing material, pipe wrap and sheet products will be prohibited
next year. Use in brake pads and linings will be banned in 1993, and
its use in auto replacement parts, cement water distribution pipes,
roof shingles and a variety of other products will end in 1996.
   The agency estimates that the cost to consumers for the phase-out
will be about $460 million over the next 13 years.
   Among the substitute products are kevlar, a synthetic fabric used
with resin, and some types of metallic fiber, industry officials
said. One manufacturer, who requested anonymity, said he prefers the
substitute.
   ``Most of us would rather sell metallic pads, anyway. They cost
more,'' he said.
   The ban does not cover guided missile liners, acetylene cylinders
and some sealing tapes. The EPA said it was difficult to find
adequate substitutes and the hazards involved were minimal.

<HEAD>Conservative Opposition Forces Withdrawal of Thornburgh Choice</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Robert B. Fiske Jr. says he withdrew from
consideration for the No. 2 job at the Justice Department to avoid a
lengthy confirmation battle threatened by conservative Republican
senators.
   The withdrawal marked a setback for Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh, who had lobbied conservatives on behalf of his choice
for deputy attorney general.
   Fiske's letter to Thornburgh taking his name out of consideration
was released Thursday by the Justice Department.
   Last month, 14 mostly conservative Republican senators, objecting
to Fiske's role as chairman of the American Bar Association's
Standing Committee on Federal Judiciary from 1984 to 1987, urged
President Bush not to nominate him for the Justice Department post.
   In his letter, Fiske wrote: ``While I have no doubt that my
nomination would have won the overwhelming support of the members of
the United States Senate, there could have been a long delay in
final action.
   ``Knowing of your need to fill this important position as quickly
as possible, I reluctantly concluded that it would be best for me to
step aside at this time.''
   Fiske, reached by telephone, declined to comment, saying only
that he would continue his private legal practice in New York.
   A pillar of the New York legal establishment, Fiske served as
U.S. attorney in Manhattan during the Ford administration.
   But conservatives criticized him for his role in screening
President Ronald Reagan's judicial nominees for the American Bar
Association.
   Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., the ranking GOP member on the Senate
Judiciary Committee, had urged Fiske to withdraw to avoid a lengthy,
divisive confirmation fight in the Senate. Thurmond warned Fiske
that some opponents might wage filibusters to stall his confirmation.
   Opponents accused him of torpedoing Reagan's nominations by
forwarding the names of prospective nominees to liberal
organizations, giving the groups an advance opportunity to organize
opposition.
   Fiske acknowledged that names were sent to these organizations as
part of a longstanding ABA practice of determining if potential
nominees had shown a history of bias against minorities and women.
   The conservatives also accused Fiske of using ideological
criteria to rate the professional qualifications of Reagan's
nominees.
   In his reply to Fiske, Thornburgh expressed ``great regret'' at
the decision and said conservatives had ``misstated and
misunderstood'' his record as chairman of the ABA screening panel.
   ``I am glad to have been part of the effort to set the record
straight, which now has been done,'' Thornburgh said.

   Greg Gardner is getting used to his
roommates' comings and goings, now that they've settled in behind
the cereal boxes.
   About six weeks ago, two Carolina wrens flew in through his
unscreened kitchen window. Gardner then noticed some sticks and
twigs near the cereal boxes, the beginnings of a nest, and he
decided to let them stay.
   Gardner tried to help the birds by leaving a torn cotton ball.
But they preferred their own materials, and wouldn't use it, he said.
   As the nest neared completion, the mother wren, a small brown
bird about three inches long, became more familiar with Gardner. She
did not easily frighten when he went into the kitchen, he said.
   ``After a while, she got used to me,'' he said.
   Once the nest was completed, the brown bird laid a set of
blue-speckled eggs. Within two weeks, five eggs hatched and the baby
birds began begging for food.
   Gardner said he's awaiting the day when the mother bird begins
teaching her chicks to fly. He's ready for his kitchen to become a
training ground.

   At the University of Connecticut, the
political climate has improved for a dog.
   Twenty years ago, the student Senate voted to sell Jonathan, the
school's Siberian husky mascot, because he represented the
establishment.
   But later this month, Jonathan VIII, the latest in a line of
huskies that have represented the college, may win back his
ancestors' status as symbol of school spirit.
   Alpha Phi Omega, a coeducational service fraternity, has asked
the board of trustees to restore Jonathan's status. The board is
expected to take up the issue July 14.
   The huskies were named after an early Connecticut governor,
Jonathan Trumbull. Many of the dogs figure prominently in the lore,
especially Jonathan IV which survived a dog-nabbing by University of
Massachusetts students.
   In 1969, the Student Senate's decision to sell the mascot was
protested by about 2,500 students. Alpha Phi Omega took
responsibility for the dog; Jonathan VIII lives with a family off
campus.
   Fraternity members say if the trustees name the newest Jonathan
as school mascot, they will trot him out for events.
   They plan to show him off at sporting and social events, and will
lobby for him as grand marshal of the Homecoming Day parade.

weight over a 90-day period, the loser to fly the winner's flag over

   Sac County, completing its third year of a communitywide

its starting weight of 78,851 pounds.
   Bradley County lost 971.25 pounds, or 4.2 percent, from its

participants and Bradley County with 203, but not all completed the
contest.
   ``They beat us, but we're still pleased,'' said Sue Little,
publications director of the Cleveland-Bradley County Chamber of
Commerce. She said Thursday that one Bradley County woman, Joyce
Renner, lost 73 pounds and her husband, Rick Renner, lost 50.

<HEAD>Bush Promises to Cancel African Debt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States will cancel debt _
potentially billions of dollars _ owed the U.S. by sub-Saharan
African countries.
   The announcement Thursday by President Bush marks a reversal for
the United States, which has preferred only to stretch out repayment
terms for debtor nations.
   ``Beginning Oct. 1 the U.S. government will forgive official
development loans in the sub-Saharan countries,'' the president told
a news conference.
   In 1987, the most recent year in which figures were immediately
available, the State Department put the total of U.S. loans to
sub-Saharan Africa at $4.3 billion, including $743 million in
development loans, $1.5 billion from the U.S. government's
Export-Import Bank and $1.2 billion in U.S. government loans to buy
surplus American farm products.
   Bush did not say which of these categories would be included.
   Africa south of the Sahara Desert is usually taken to mean all of
Africa except South Africa and the North African countries on the
Mediterranean _ Egypt, Libya, Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco.
   Bush said his action would be in accordance with a decision made
last year in Toronto at an economic summit of industrialized
democracies to offer different options to creditor governments.
   Other governments, notably West Germany, France, the Netherlands
and the Nordic countries, have converted many loans into grants.
Loans have become the preferred form of U.S. aid, but as Third World
debt has mounted and the burden of interest payments on debtor
countries increased, the pendulum has swung back to grants.
   In 1987, sub-Saharan Africa owed $137.8 billion in medium- and
long-term debt. It was estimated that payments due from these
countries had risen from $5.6 billion in 1979 to $21 billion a year
for the period 1986 to 1989.
   Total Third World debt is put at about $1.3 trillion.

<HEAD>Ershad Presidency to be Limited to 10 Years</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Hussain Mohammad Ershad, who
took power in a bloodless coup in 1982, has proposed a
constitutional amendment limiting the presidency to 10 years.
   The proposed amendment was presented to parliament Thursday,
where it is assured of passage because Ershad's Jatiya Party holds
251 of the 300 seats.
   ``I am certain that they (the legislators) are going to pass it,
so it is good from my side and I am certain it is good for our
country,'' the 59-year-old former army general said.
   Ershad resigned from the army in 1985 and a year later was
elected to a five-year presidential term in national balloting that
political opponents and foreign observers said was tainted by
widespread vote fraud.
   Under the proposed amendment, Ershad can seek re-election in 1991
to another 5-year term but he would be banned from seeking a third
term.
   Bangladesh has had nine presidents since it won independence from
Pakistan in 1971. Each took office through military intervention,
either through coup and assassination or through installation of
civilians who heeded the army's dictates.
   Ershad, who has governed Bangladesh longer than any other leader,
said the decision to limit the term of the president was part of his
effort to modernize the nation.
   ``We have to prove to the world that Bangladesh is something more
than a poor country,'' Ershad said.
   Bangladesh, whose 110 million people have an average annual
income of only $160, is perennially buffeted by floods, cyclones,
tornadoes and drought.

<HEAD>Surgeon Says Brown Doing Fine After Bypass Surgery</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A surgeon said former Gov. John Y. Brown
Jr. was doing fine after an unexpectedly difficult 5{-hour
quadruple-bypass operation, his second open-heart operation in six
years.
   ``He's doing very well,'' said Dr. Allan Lansing, who performed
the surgery Thursday. ``He's had no problems or complications so
far.''
   Brown, 55, was listed in critical condition in the intensive care
unit of Humana Hospital-Audubon late Thursday night. Hospital
officials said it was routine for patients to be listed in critical
condition after that kind of operation.
   Dr. David Dageforde, a cardiologist also caring for Brown, said
the former governor had suffered a minor heart attack late last
Friday. Dageforde said subsequent tests showed damage to his heart
was ``minimal.''
   After initially checking into a Fort Lauderdale, Fla., hospital
complaining of chest pains, Brown was flown to Humana-Audubon, where
tests were conducted Wednesday.
   The evaluation detected some coronary blockage requiring
treatment, and Lansing scheduled the surgery after consulting with
Brown and family members.
   Despite what the doctors described as ``prolonged and difficult''
surgery, Lansing said Brown should be released from the hospital
within a week to 10 days.
   Lansing said he expected no recurrence of complications that
occurred after Brown underwent a triple-bypass operation in June
1983, when he was nearing the end of his four-year term as governor.
   Following his gubernatorial term, Brown ran for the U.S. Senate
in 1984 against Walter ``Dee'' Huddleston. But he later withdrew
from the race saying he was following doctors' orders.
   In 1987, he finished second in the Democratic gubernatorial
primary to Wallace Wilkinson.

<HEAD>Kissinger Calls for Major Cuts in Third World Debt, Cautions on China</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Industrial nations should join banks in
writing off up to 50 percent of the Third World debt, former
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger said.
   ``Realistically, banks alone cannot bear the burden of what
creditors have to do,'' he said Thursday.
   Kissinger, who came to this country on Wednesday for a three-day
visit at the invitation of President Carlos Andres Perez, denied
reports he would be paid by Venezuela to help it renegotiate the
terms of its $33 billion foreign debt.
   Perez's efforts to impose austerity measures in this country,
backed by international creditors, prompted riots in February that
killed about 300 people.
   Similar problems in May in Argentina, which has the third-largest
foreign debt in the developing world, caused food riots and led to
the deaths of 14 people.
   Kissinger called for reducing Third World debt by up to 50
percent, ``depending on the performance of the debtor country.''
Latin America, led by Brazil, Mexico and Argentina, owes foreign
creditors $401 billion.
   Kissinger singled out Mexico and Venezuela as examples of debtor
countries that have carried out economic reform policies on their
own ``and are therefore deserving of our support.''
   Asked about the crackdown in China last month against the
student-led reform movement, Kissinger said the harsh suppression
occurred because ``economic reforms moved more rapidly than
political reforms.''
   However, he appealed for caution in Western policy toward China.
   ``A billion Chinese are the single most important factor in Asia.
... The Western world should be very careful not to drive them back
into isolation or hostility on an emotional basis,'' he said.

   The Army says its fleet of AH-64 attack
helicopters can begin flying again after an investigation showed a
fatal accident last week was caused by a piece of improperly stored
sheet metal striking the tail rotor.
   The Army has 486 Apaches, its newest and most sophisticated
helicopter gunship.
   The fleet was grounded Monday for the investigation into the June
29 crash in northern Florida of a National Guard Apache. The copilot
was killed and the pilot seriously injured when the tail rotor came
off the helicopter.
   In a Pentagon statement Thursday, the Army said the investigation
into the Florida crash revealed that the tail rotor damage was
caused by ``a foreign object striking a rotor blade.''
   Physical and chemical evidence found that a piece of sheet metal
used to help secure a door had been improperly stored and that the
piece of metal ``became dislodged and flew into the AH-64's tail
rotor system,'' the statement said.

<NOTE>Withdrawals Slow, Total Deposits Actually Climb</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Net deposit withdrawals from savings and loan
institutions slowed by more than 50 percent in May to $2.4 billion,
according to the Federal Home Loan Bank Board.
   Two West Coast thrifts that lost a total of $1.4 billion in
deposits during the month accounted for more than half of the net
withdrawals, the S&amp;L industry's chief regulator said Thursday.
   Total deposits in the nation's 2,934 S&amp;Ls, after counting
interest credited to depositors' accounts, grew by $587 million
during May to $955.2 billion.
   It was the first increase since last December.
   James Barth, the bank board's chief economist, attributed the
slightly improved deposit balances in thrift institutions to a
normal seasonal resumption of savings after April withdrawals to pay
taxes.
   The spread between interest rates offered by money market mutual
funds and S&amp;Ls also narrowed modestly in May, Barth said.
   The May decrease in net deposits _ the 13th in a row _ was the
smallest since savers began pulling their money out of S&amp;Ls more
than a year ago as concern about the health of the industry
heightened.

   Lucille Ball has been posthumously awarded the
Presidential Medal of Freedom.
   President Bush on Thursday described her and the four other
recipients as American heroes during a ceremony in the White House
East Room.
   Former Sen. Margaret Chase Smith, aviator and war hero James H.
Doolittle and statesmen Douglas Dillon and George Kennan also
received the nation's highest civilian award.
   ``You have left an indelible mark as you have enriched this
nation, and America is grateful,'' Bush told the recipients, adding
that they ``embody the achievement, vision and dedication that is
the greatness of this country.''
   Gary Morton, Miss Ball's husband, accepted the medal for the
carrot-topped comedienne who died April 26 at age 77.
   ``Lucille Ball was a national treasure who brought laughter to us
all,'' Bush said. ``She was like everyone's next-door neighbor, only
funnier.''
   Miss Ball was known to generations of television viewers as the
wacky housewife on ``I Love Lucy.''
   Doolittle, 92, was a war hero, aviation pioneer and retired
military general who has received the Silver Star and Congressional
Medal of Honor.
   Smith, 91, a Maine Republican, served in Congress for 32 years,
both in the House and the Senate. She served under six presidents,
beginning with Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1940.
   The president described the 85-year-old Kennan, a diplomat for 27
years, as ``truly a visionary'' on U.S.-Soviet relations.

   The U.S. dollar closed firm against the Japanese yen
Friday, while the market's key index continued to rise.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which rose
113.77 points Thursday, gained another 280.49 points, or 0.83
percent, to close the week at 33,703.97.
   The dollar finished trading at 139.65 yen. After opening at
139.33 yen, up 0.43 yen from Thursday's close of 138.90 yen, the
currency ranged between 139.00 yen and 139.83 yen.
   Currency dealers said market players were cautious in morning
trading in anticipation of the release of U.S. unemployment figures
for June, due out later Friday in Washington.
   ``It's hard to move around with that announcement coming up,''
said a trader of a major commercial bank in Tokyo, who spoke
anonymously.
   The jobless data is considered an important indicator to judge
the state of the U.S. economy.
   On the stock market, the market's main barometer gained steadily
from the start with domestic-demand issues attracting investors'
attention because of the upward trend of the yen this week.
   But traders said said the morning trading was not very active,
with some market participants retreating to the sidelines with a
wait-and-see position.

<TEXT>
   Communist officials dealt a parting blow
to longtime Hungarian leader Janos Kadar hours after his death by
saying political changes had passed him by.
   Kadar, who died Thursday at age 77, came to power as Soviet
troops crushed the 1956 anti-Stalinist uprising. He oversaw early
stirrings of economic and political reform but lost power last year
to enthusiasts of quicker change.
   In remembering his life, the party leadership, in a statement
carried Thursday by state media, said Kadar had led the way to
national consensus and always aimed at a ``humanist socialism.''
   However, it said that ``time and the (communist) Hungarian
Socialist Workers Party have surpassed the life work of Kadar, the
politician. In the spirit of his heritage demanding justice, we must
declare this painful fact.''
   In the 1960's, Kadar gained a degree of popularity at home and
abroad with cautious economic reform and relative political
tolerance.
   However, in the late 1970's, he backed away from reforms, and the
country's economy went into a slow tailspin.
   Plans for his funeral were not announced. The four members of the
party's ruling presidium were named to a special committee to
organize the funeral. The committee was to be headed by party
chairman Rezso Nyers.
   However, Nyers and other government figures left for Bucharest,
Romania, on Thursday for a Warsaw Pact summit that is to include
Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev. There was speculation Kadar's
funeral would be delayed until after next week's visit to Hungary by
President Bush.

<HEAD>Homosexual Lovers Can Be Considered a Family, Court Rules</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   About a month after Bernard Braverman's lover of
20 years died of AIDS, he found an eviction notice on the door of
the rent-controlled Greenwich Village apartment they had shared for
15 years.
   On Thursday, after the state's highest court ruled that a partner
in a long-term homosexual relationship can take over their apartment
when the leaseholder dies, Braverman said:
   ``It means I won. A major burden is off my shoulders now.''
   The case considered by the Court of Appeals involved another man
in the same situation, and the ruling may affect thousands of
homosexual men and women and their lovers _ their ``life partners''
or ``spousal equivalents,'' in the legal lingo that has developed.
   ``I think it's an historic event,'' said Arthur S. Leonard, a
professor at New York Law School and chairman of the city bar
association's committee on law and sex. ``It's the first time I'm
aware of that the New York Court of Appeals has recognized that a
gay male couple may constitute a family, and obviously a lesbian
couple as well.
   ``That's pretty exciting, pretty revolutionary.''
   Lawyers are uncertain, but the ruling may also affect unmarried
heterosexual partners, older people who live together to save money,
and poor families who can't afford legal fees to adopt children or
obtain a divorce.
   The most immediate effect of the ruling was on New York City's
homosexual community, which is being ravaged by AIDS.
   ``It's courageous, I think,'' said Everett Quinton, 37, who
shared an apartment with playwright Charles Ludlam for 12 years
before Ludlam's death in 1986. ``There was a bit of sympathy, of
humanity. But then it was, `Sorry to hear about it, but you've gotta
get out now.'
   ``It's been happening all over. I'm glad this ruling came down.
People can bury their dead and not immediately have to worry about
where they'll stay.''
   Quinton's apartment, however, was rent-stabilized, not
rent-controlled, and Monday's ruling, while encouraging, doesn't
extend to his situation.
   Rent-control and rent-stabilization laws limit the rent increases
landlords can charge for some apartments. The rent-control laws
apply to longterm tenants in apartments built before 1947.
   The court expanded the definition of a family as it applies to
New York's rent-control laws, which say only ``family members'' may
take over rent-controlled apartments when the tenant of record dies.
   The court said a long-term emotional and financial commitment
makes a couple ``married'' in the law's eyes.
   Protection against eviction doesn't rest on legal documents or
blood relation, Judge Vito Titone wrote, ``but instead should find
its foundation in the reality of family life.''
   ``It is the totality of the relationship as evidenced by the
dedication, caring and self-sacrifice of the parties which should,
in the final analysis, control,'' Titone said.
   In a dissenting opinion, Judge Richard Simons said the court was
too broadly interpreting the state Legislature's intent in drafting
New York's rent control law. The court's 4-2 decision, he said,
``produces an unworkable test that is subject to abuse.''
   For 54-year-old Braverman, who has AIDS, the ruling appears to
remove the specter of eviction. More court hearings will decide that.
   ``I thought dealing with AIDS was enough of a battle for anyone,
but this extra thing _ taking away my home, my support system, my
roots in the community _ that was an awful thing hanging over my
head,'' said Braverman.
   ``Now that this has come down, the lower courts will move, I
hope, more aggressively to protect people in these circumstances,''
said David Hansell, director of legal services for the Gay Men's
Health Crisis.
   Also on Thursday a law was scheduled to take effect in San
Francisco permitting unmarried couples to register as ``domestic
partners,'' giving them certain rights such as the right to
bereavement leave from a city job if the partner dies.
   But its implementation was suspended pending certification of
signatures on a petition seeking to put the measure on the November
ballot and repeal it.

<HEAD>Study: Cholesterol Level of 60 Million Americans Too High</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserGraphic NY16</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 60 million Americans 20 and older _ more
than one-third of the nation's adults _ face the risk of coronary
disease because they have high blood cholesterol levels, a study has
found.
   ``What's especially disconcerting is that high cholesterol levels
are often seen in association with other risk factors _
hypertension, smoking, or being overweight,'' says Christopher
Sempos, one of eight authors of the study published in today's
Journal of the American Medical Association.
   ``And for many people, most of the desired changes could be
achieved through a change in routines like diet and exercise,''
Sempos, a nutritionist and epidemiologist with the National Center
for Health Statistics in Hyattsville, Md., said in a telephone
interview Thursday.
   ``Even though we've made great strides in alerting the public to
the dangers of cholesterol and heart disease, there's still too
large a segment that is putting itself unnecessarily at risk.''
   The federal center lists coronary disease as the nation's leading
killer, claiming 521,000 lives in 1986, the last full year for which
statistics are available.
   In the study, researchers examined data from 11,864 adults 20 to
74 years old who participated in the Second National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey from 1976 to 1980.
   The average blood cholesterol level for an American adult woman
was 215 milligrams per deciliter. For men, it was 211.
   Cholesterol is a steroidlike compound that is produced both by
the body and contained in fats that make up part of the diet. It is
circulated in the blood and is important for normal functioning of
the cells.
   But too much cholesterol can cause deposits to build up on the
arterial walls, restricting the flow of blood to the heart muscle
and contributing substantially to heart disease.
   Fruits, vegetables, whole grains and beans are known to lower
cholesterol, and nutritionists say lean meat, fish and poultry in
small portions are acceptable for a healthy diet.
   Foods cited as high in cholesterol include fatty meats such as
spare ribs and highly marbled steak, ice cream and most other dairy
products, egg yolks, pies, cakes and cookies.
   For the study's purposes, participants with a blood cholesterol
level of 240 or higher were considered to be in need of medical
advice and intervention to lower it.
   The same was true for any participant whose cholesterol level was
200 or higher if they had at least two other risk factors for
coronary heart disease: high blood pressure, diabetes, previous
heart disease or stroke, excess weight or smoking 10 cigarettes or
more daily.
   Those two groups constituted 36 percent of the participants in
the survey _ a percentage researchers used to arrive at the
estimated 60 million American adults.
   Researchers found a substantial increase with age in the
proportion of people who are candidates for medical advice and
intervention: For those 20 to 39, the rate was 20 percent; for those
40 to 59, almost 50 percent; and for those 60 to 74, almost 60
percent.
   One doctor found some reason for optimism in the study's findings
because the average cholesterol levels have been on the decline.
   ``We've gone from a cholesterol level of 240 for a middle-aged
man during the 1950s to around 215 today,'' said Dr. Jeremiah
Stamler, a professor of cardiology at Northwestern University
Medical School. ``We can do even better.
   ``The American people have listened, and maybe now they'll listen
a little more closely.''
   The National Heart Association estimates that the direct and
indirect costs to the public related to coronary heart disease _
including physician and hospital fees, and loss of productivity
because of worker absences _ will total $38.8 billion in 1989.

<HEAD>Forgotten Medieval Plaque Sells for Nearly $1 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A New York dealer today paid nearly $1 million for
a medieval enamel plaque that lay forgotten in a drawer for decades,
Sotheby's auction house said.
   In another transaction, Christie's house said an 18th century
mahogany chest of drawers sold Thursday for $1.8 million _ the
highest price ever paid for a piece of English furniture.
   Sotheby's said New York dealer Edward Lubin paid $926,000 for the
plaque, which illustrates the biblical story of Cain and Abel. Lubin
said he was buying the plaque for an institution, which he did not
identify.
   The name of seller, who lives in Carshalton near London, was not
given.
   The seller told auctioneers that the 4-inch square plaque, made
of copper and enameled in several colors, was left to her by her
parents. She said she forgot about it for 30 years until she
recently found it in a sideboard drawer. Art historians have
identified 11 similar plaques in museums in London, Paris and New
York, but they dispute their origin.
   Some think they came from an altar made for Henry of Blois,
bishop of Winchester and brother of King Stephen of England. He
reigned from 1135 to 1154.
   However, at least one expert thinks the plaques came from a cross
made for Abbot Suger at St. Denis in France.
   Lubin also paid $516,000 for three English enamel panels from a
12th century casket that depict biblical scenes.
   The seller was not identified.
   Neither the seller nor buyer of the mahogany chest were
identified by William Hanham, a spokesman for Christie's.
   The George III dressing and writing commode was built about 1760
for William Beckford, a lord mayor of London, the spokesman said.
   The chest was one of a pair built by John Channon, a Devonshire
cabinetmaker. The other piece is on display in London's Victoria and
Albert Museum.
   Hanham said he believed the price was influenced by the auction
sale of an American desk by Nicholas Brown in New York last month.
At $12.1 million, the sale set the record for a piece of furniture.

<HEAD>Dollar Firms Against Yen, Tokyo Stocks Up</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar firmed today against the Japanese
yen after four-consecutive days of decline, while the key index on
the Tokyo Stock Exchange rose.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 280.49 points, or 0.83
percent, closing at 33,703.97. The index posted a 113.77-point gain
the previous day.
   The dollar closed at 139.65 yen, up 0.75 yen from Thursday's
close of 138.90 yen. It opened at 139.33 yen and ranged between
139.00 yen and 139.83 yen.
   Today's turnaround in the dollar's direction came after a fall of
5.05 yen over the past four trading days.
   A dealer with Mitsubishi Bank said the dollar firmed on buying
for ``short-cover positions.''
   ``Otherwise there was relative quiet'' as market players were
waiting for U.S. unemployment figures for June to be released later
today in Washington, said the dealer.
   The jobless data is considered an important indicator of the
state of the economy.
   On the stock exchange, the Nikkei index rose steadily throughout
the day, as investors were encouraged by declining long-term
interest rates in Japan, traders said.
   ``The attention is now whether the U.S. monetary authorities will
ease their credit further in an already slowed-down economy,'' said
Masahiro Umemori, an equity researcher with Nomura Securities,
Japan's largest brokerage.
   Lower U.S. interest rates tend to make dollar-denominated
investments less attractive.

   A woman waiting for a heart transplant has
become the first person treated through a telephone connection for a
heart attack she suffered at home, hospital officials said.
   It was the first use of a device called the MDphone
transtelephonic defibrillator, which was introduced last year at
Jewish Hospital and two other medical centers since then.
   Ada Evans, 54, was one of two of patients equipped with the
portable electronic cardiac treatment systems in mid-May, said Dr.
Rodolphe Ruffy of Jewish Hospital.
   The device fits into a briefcase-sized case and can be plugged
into a standard phone jack.
   On June 25, Mrs. Evans began experiencing an extremely rapid
heartbeat. Her husband, Roscoe Evans, immediately activated the
MDphone, which automatically dialed the hospital's cardiac care unit.
   After he attached two electrode pads to his wife's chest,
hospital personnel activated the defibrillator, which restores the
heart's normal rhythm through electric shock.
   Ruffy said the device saved her life.
   ``The system worked absolutely according to expectations,'' Ruffy
said. ``The crew and the staff went through extensive training, so
we were certain they were well-prepared.''
   Both the Evanses, who appeared at a news conference Thursday,
said they had been confident the system would work.
   ``With all the training, I knew my husband knew what to do. I had
no doubts about it,'' Mrs. Evans said.
   Evans, a retired bread salesman, said he didn't have time to
worry.
   ``Something had to be done and I knew I had to do it, so I wasn't
scared,'' he said. ``I had confidence in the machine and in the
training and in what the doctors and nurses had told us it would do.
I thank God for the machine.''
   Ruffy said Mrs. Evans and other patients waiting for heart
transplants were prime candidates for the device because it frees
them from lengthy hospital stays.
   S. Eric Wachtel, the president of MEDphone Corp. of Paramus,
N.J., which developed the machine, said his company is negotiating
for the use of the MDphone with about 25 other medical centers.
   Besides Jewish Hospital, the MDphone is being used at the Medical
Center of Delaware and Sacred Heart Hospital in Pensacola, Fla.

<HEAD>More Protests and Political Battles Over Flag Burning</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JACK KEEVER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A Texas lawmaker wearing flag stickers and soft-soled shoes ended
a 12-hour filibuster against a flag-burning resolution early today
as around the nation the issue sparked protests and political
battles.
   New York Gov. Mario Cuomo introduced legislation that he said
would outlaw flag burning without a constitutional amendment, while
two people in Florida were arrested in separate flag destructions
and an Arkansas judge was asked to block a flag burning.
   The unfurling of flag issues comes two weeks after the U.S.
Supreme Court overturned a man's conviction in Texas, ruling that
burning the flag as a protest was protected by the Constitution's
freedom of speech guarantee.
   In Austin, Texas, state Sen. Craig Washington sought to block a
resolution that asks members of Congress to support a constitutional
amendment making flag burning not a protected right of the First
Amendment.
   He began his stalling tactics at 1:25 p.m. Thursday and ended it
at 1:40 a.m. CDT today.
   ``I was prepared to go the rest of the night,'' Washington said.
``I don't think I could have gone much longer than noon.''
   It was unclear whether Senate leaders would bring up the
resolution later today.
   Washington, who opposes flag burning, said the issue is
protection of the First Amendment and nothing else.
   ``The Constitution has earned the right to be saluted,'' he said.
   Washington also said the resolution had no purpose.
   ``It is utterly without substance, it is nothing more than a
symbolic occasion for us to tell our constituencies and the world
how we feel about this issue,'' he said.
   The effects of the hours of talking seemed to get to Washington.
   At one point, he rubbed his head and said, ``I'm starting to get
a little stir crazy.''
   Later, Rep. Senfronia Thompson got on her knees and massaged his
legs.
   Railroad Commissioner Kent Hance, a likely Republican candidate
for Texas governor in 1990, said Washington was out of line.
   ``The people of this state don't want the U.S. flag burned, and
Craig Washington should be able to understand that,'' Hance said.
   The resolution passed the Texas House last week, when members
stood and recited the pledge of allegiance, and an early test vote
in the Senate was 23-2 in support.
   Elsewhere, Cuomo's legislative proposal would make the simple act
of burning a flag other than for legal disposal purposes illegal and
punishable by up to one year in jail and a fine of up to $1,000.
   Cuomo said his bill would not violate the First Amendment's
freedom of speech guarantees because it deletes ``any reference to
conduct that has a communicative or expressive impact on others.''
   The New York Democrat said the proposal was preferable to
President Bush's call for a constitutional amendment because
protection for the flag could be provided much faster. The governor
also said ``tampering'' with the First Amendment would establish a
dangerous precedent.
   In Florida, 19-year-old Robert Rase of Jacksonville was charged
with grand theft for allegedly stealing a 20-foot-by-38-foot flag
outside a complex that houses the FBI and Secret Service. Detective
Robert Bogers said Rase cut up the flag, attached the blue field
with stars to his bedroom ceiling, and covered a sofa with the
stripes.
   In Gainsville, Fla., art student Terry Towery, 25, was released
from jail Wednesday after his arrest for burning a U.S. flag along
with paintings and other art objects in a Tuesday night theatrical
performance he said was in honor of free speech.
   Police said they arrested Towery because he violated the city's
burning ordinance. He faces a misdemeanor charge of making a bonfire
without a permit and within 150 feet of a building.
   In another case, Arkansas Secretary of State Bill McCuen asked
Pulaski County Chancellor Judge Lee Munson to block a flag burning
scheduled for Sunday by Robert ``Say'' McIntosh at the state
Capitol. McCuen's petition contended that earlier attempts by
McIntosh to burn a U.S. flag resulted in damage and endangered
people.
   On Monday, Munson declined to block the burning.

   Authorities have charged a man with drunken
driving in a car crash that killed his wife as the couple left their
wedding reception.
   Raymond Pelchat, 24, was driving his wife's car May 14 when it
veered into the oncoming lane and struck another car broadside,
police said. His wife, Bonnie Lynn Dumas Pelchat, 24, was killed and
Pelchat suffered minor injuries.
   ``It's a sad situation...,'' said Mrs. Pelchat's mother, Esther
Dumas. ``He's going to suffer enough as it is. We weren't looking
for any charges against him.''
   Pelchat's father, Benjamin, said his son was unavailable for
comment.
   If convicted, Pelchat could face a maximum penalty of six months
to 10 years in prison, a $1,000 fine and suspension of his driver's
license for three years.
   Pelchat, a dry wall installer, had been convicted of driving
while intoxicated in late 1988 and had his license suspended.

<HEAD>Rains Lighten in East; Heat Wave Continues to Bake West</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Rains lightened in the soaked Tennessee Valley and mid-Atlantic
states today while a heat wave continued to grip much of the West.
   Afternoon highs were generally above 90 degrees Thursday in the
western two-thirds of the nation, and at least 11 cities in five
states set or tied record highs for the date.
   Record-breaking hot spots included Sacramento, Calif., where the
high of 105 degrees exceeded by one degree a mark set in 1921; Las
Vegas, where a high of 115 broke a 37-year-old record by one degree;
and Corpus Christi, Texas, which broke a 1965 mark by two degrees
with a high of 99.
   Tucson, Ariz., set its seventh record high in the last eight days
with a reading of 109, and Grand Junction, Colo., set its third
straight record high with 104.
   Temperatures were still close to 100 degrees in some parts of the
Desert Southwest early today.
   Scattered showers and thunderstorms extended from the Tennessee
Valley to the Middle Atlantic Coast early this morning, and a few
showers and thunderstorms doused the Southeast. Millville, N.J.,
recorded just over an inch of rain in the six hours ended at 2 a.m.
EDT, and Fort Polk, La., received just over three quarters of an
inch.
   That rainfall was nothing like the torrents that have caused
floods and damage in the region in recent days.
   The bodies of two 15-year-old boys were found in East Brunswick,
N.J., on Thursday, one day after they apparently were sucked into a
sewer by rainwaters. More than 5 inches of rain were recorded in the
area on Wednesday.
   Waters receded in Cobb County, northwest of Atlanta, where as
much as 8.85 inches of rain fell Wednesday night and Thursday
morning. The storm demolished an unoccupied house, flooded several
residences and flooded more than a dozen roads, and at least six
roads were expected to remain closed through the weekend.
   Strong thunderstorms developed along a cold front during the
night over southern South Dakota and northern Nebraska, and one-inch
hail fell at Kadoka, S.D.
   Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms in the
lower Mississippi Valley, northwest Pennsylvania, western North
Carolina and northern through central Florida. Scattered rain was
forecast for northern New England and northeast New York state.
   Highs were expected to be in the 70s in Upper Michigan and
northeast Minnesota, and scattered along the Pacific Coast; the
mid-90s and hotter over southeast Texas, the central Plains, from
southern Montana across New Mexico and Arizona, and from Idaho
across eastern California; near 100 degrees from southwest Idaho
across Utah and Nevada; and near 115 degrees over inland California
and the Desert Southwest. Highs in the rest of the nation were
expected to reach the 80s and low 90s.
   Temperatures at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 51 degrees at Quillayute,
Wash., and Yellowstone Park, Wyo., to 100 degrees at Phoenix.

<TEXT>
   Mikhail S. Gorbachev and his squabbling
East bloc allies today opened a Warsaw Pact summit that is expected
to bring more arms control initiatives.
   The publicity-conscious Soviet president was tight-lipped about
his expectations for the two-day meeting in the Romanian capital.
Asked by reporters what he expected, Gorbachev said only: ``I'll
tell you after we finish.''
   Gorbachev is attending the meeting with Soviet Premier Nikolai
Ryzhkov and Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze. Romanian
officials said reporters would be allowed no access to them and the
other Soviet bloc leaders during the closed-door meetings.
   Gorbachev arrived in Bucharest late Thursday from Strasbourg,
France, where he announced that Moscow and its allies could agree on
unilateral cuts in Soviet short-range nuclear missiles in Eastern
Europe if NATO is prepared to negotiate reductions on those weapons.
   This meeting may produce numbers for those cuts.
   The Western Alliance patched up a divisive row between West
Germany and the United States over such negotiations six weeks ago.
President Bush on May 29 proposed drastic reductions in conventional
forces of both military blocs in Europe.
   Speaking Thursday at a news conference in Washington, Bush
spurned Gorbachev's call for swift negotiations on short-range
nuclear missiles.
   Bush noted that NATO leaders, at the summit in Brussels six weeks
ago, agreed to begin negotiations on such weapons only after an
East-West agreement had been reached to reduce conventional forces
and reductions were actually under way.
   ``I don't want to get off the track by re-opening the short-range
nuclear forces package,'' he said.
   West Germany was pushing for quick talks on short-range nuclear
weapons but agreed to delay them until after preliminary agreements
are reached on conventional arms reductions at East-West talks in
Vienna.
   Bonn signaled, however, it hopes agreement will come within the
year deadline proposed by Bush. Other Western nations call that
optimistic.
   Gorbachev said in Bonn last month that the Warsaw Pact summit
could deliver a detailed response to Bush's proposals to reduce the
armed forces of East and West in Europe to 275,000 on each side and
agree on further cuts in weaponry and combat aircraft.
   Romanian officials said the Pact will not announce a decision
until after the summit ends Saturday.
   Romania's tightly controlled state media announced no firm agenda
for the meeting.
   The state news agency Agerpres announced only that Eastern
European delegations arrived to a welcome from President Nicolae
Ceausescu, the East bloc's most resolute foe of Gorbachev's moves
toward more democracy and market-oriented economies.
   Just last week, in a speech pointedly distributed to foreign
journalists covering the summit, Ceausescu rejected any return to
private ownership and insisted, ``We must take a firm attitude
against any attempts to denigrate socialism.''
   ``We think that the concern with a better development of
socialism in various countries should not bring a negation or
underrating of the might of socialism,'' he added, in a clear swipe
at recent developments in Hungary, Poland and the Soviet Union.
   Political reforms in those countries have divided the once
monolithic East bloc, with Romania most staunchly opposed to change
and East Germany, Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia also still dominated
by orthodox communists.
   A Western diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said a
meeting was expected to be held on ideology Saturday after the Pact
summit formally ends.
   ``Very little is expected to come out of it,'' he said, alluding
to the deep divisions within the Soviet bloc.
   Ideological quarrels have exacerbated traditional nationalism and
centuries-old rivalries between the diverse ethnic groups of Eastern
Europe.
   Neighboring Hungary and Romania are engaged in the fiercest feud,
a war of words resulting from Romania's alleged mistreatment of its
1.7 million-member ethnic Hungarian minority.
   Hungary has also antagonized neighboring Czechoslovakia with
political reforms and a decision to halt work on a joint Danube
River dam project.
   Bulgaria is isolated from its Pact allies over its treatment of
its Turkish minority, who are leaving the country by the tens of
thousands following the death of at least eight Turks in violent
protests against a Bulgarian assimilation campaign.

<HEAD>Former Governor Files Petition Challenging Impeachment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY LOPEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Gov. Evan Mecham is challenging his
impeachment last yeer by the Arizona Senate in a petition with the
state Supreme Court.
   In the petition, which was filed Thursday, he asks for more than
$570,000 in expenses and demands the impeachment be quashed or that
he be given a new trial by the Senate.
   ``We can't let it stand because _ not so much the effect on me
but _ if that's the case, then no governor in America is sitting
safe,'' said Mecham, who is campaigning for governor in 1990.
   Companion petitions filed by supporters claimed that they were
deprived of a constitutional right to lobby lawmakers to keep Mecham
in office when Chief Justice Frank Gordon Jr., sitting as head of
the Senate Court of Impeachment, said it would be illegal to try to
influence the impeachment vote.
   Mecham, a Republican, was ousted by the GOP-controlled Senate on
April 4, 1988, on charges he obstructed justice and misused a state
protocol fund.
   Speaking with reporters after Thursday's court filings, Mecham
and his lawyer, Donald MacPherson, said they would rather have
Mecham reinstated outright but would settle for a new trial and for
proceedings on whether some senators were biased.
   MacPherson said the impeachment was flawed because senators never
took a separate vote on each element of the potential offenses and
because of confusion over the state of the law.
   The lawyer said the House bill of impeachment described Mecham as
doing some things in the course of his official duties when he
actually had done them before his election.
   MacPherson also accused Mecham's impeachment trial lawyers, Fred
Craft and Jerris Leonard, of ineffective representation, saying they
had not raised key issues such as the separate votes.
   Mecham, who had praised Craft and Leonard in the past, declined
to comment on that portion of the petition.
   Craft and Leonard said they understood why Mecham's new lawyer
would raise the issue but recalled that Mecham also had criticized
all the other lawyers involved in the impeachment. Craft said Mecham
had called him for legal advice as recently as June 29.
   The Senate earlier this year rejected Mecham's call for a new
trial, and legislative leaders said Thursday they would turn over
the new challenge to their lawyers.
   Mecham's lawyers had to wait until now to file the petition
because the Arizona Constitution does not allow lawmakers to be sued
while they are in session. The Legislature's 1989 regular session
ended last month.
   Mecham's ouster elevated elected Secretary of State Rose Mofford,
a Democrat, to the governorship. Mrs. Mofford's press secretary,
Vada Manager, declined to comment on the petitions.
   ``We're not going to speculate that far in the future,'' he said.

   The state seized a 1989 Mercedes Benz sedan worth
$74,000 from a Mercedes executive's driveway, saying the automaker
owes Massachusetts about $7 million in corporate taxes.
   ``If Mercedes does not pay the state what it owes, we will go to
auction with the car to pay off a small portion of their bill,''
state Revenue Department spokeswoman Betsy Houghteling said Thursday
night.
   Mercedes executives could not be reached at their New Jersey
office after business hours and did not return a message left on
their answering machine.
   Authorities took possession of the Mercedes 560 SEL with garnet
paint and beige leather upholstery at the executive's home.
Houghteling declined to name the executive, because he personally
has done nothing wrong.
   ``It was a company car. That's why we took it,'' she said.
   On May 5, state Attorney General James Shannon won a default
judgment against Mercedes in Suffolk Superior Court for $6.9 million
in back taxes dating from 1982 to 1985, but Mercedes has refused to
pay.
   The manufacturer contends it isn't liable for the state taxes.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. and Japanese leaders are urged in a new
report to stress to their people that both sides have more to gain
through cooperation than ruthless rivalry.
   ``But unless the United States can come to terms with its fear of
`being taken' by the Japanese'' and the Japanese abandon ``their
mercantilist view of the world, such cooperation remains beyond
reach,'' says the report published by the Johns Hopkins University
School of Advanced International Studies.
   Leaders of ``both Japan and the United States need to foster
greater public understanding of the real issues,'' especially on
defense, said the 68-page study issued this week, entitled ``The
United States and Japan in 1989.''
   Three previous reports in the annual series dealt in detail with
individual economic disputes between the two countries. The latest
study focused more on managing the relationship to prevent conflicts
from overshadowing basic advantages.
   ``Political leaders in Washington and Tokyo should take the lead
in working to eliminate misconceptions and reaffirm the basic
premises of U.S.-Japan cooperation, lest misunderstanding lead to
bad legislation,'' the report said.
   ``Although fundamentals supporting the U.S.-Japan relationship
are almost universally positive, these can be quickly forgotten in
bouts of name-calling,'' it cautioned.
   The report voiced concern over ``the rapid growth of a cottage
industry of Japan-bashers in Washington who warn us that Japan
represents a greater threat than the Soviet Union to our economic
and security interests. ... Their various allegations, if left
unanswered, can erode the relationship ... leading to the
self-fulfilling prophecy syndrome.''
   Tracing what it called ``real issues,'' the study said,
``Japanese political leaders will have to make unprecedented efforts
to present Japan's defense responsibilities in a straightforward
manner and stress the importance of the U.S. (military) bases to
Japan.
   ``U.S. government officials must ... educate the American public
on Japanese contributions to U.S. defense ... (and) make clear that
the United States is in Japan for its own national security, not
simply to defend Japan.''
   The study said both countries should correct domestic problems
creating U.S.-Japanese friction.

<HEAD>Blood Plasma With AIDS Virus Slipped Through Detection Tests</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By IRIS CHANG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists have found the AIDS virus in blood
plasma supplies that had slipped through standard blood screening
procedures, according to a study released today.
   The discovery means that plasma tainted with the human
immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, could infect recipients of
transfusions, said Dr. Jean Pierre Allain, an author of a study
published today in the Journal of the American Medical Association.
   Allain, of Abbott Laboratories in North Chicago, and fellow
researchers have developed an HIV-antigen test that they say can cut
the detection time in half, which can help minimize the number of
HIV-infected blood plasma from leaking into commercial supplies.
   The scientists studied 35,000 blood plasma samples collected over
two years at two plasma collection centers and found seven to be
HIV-infected. Allain called the number ``fairly high.''
   But experts with the American Red Cross said that although the
threat of a transfusion recipient being infected by HIV-contaminated
blood plasma is real, the risk is small.
   ``Of the 2,236 transfusion-associated cases of AIDS reported by
the Centers for Disease Control in April 1989, only two cases
resulted from transfusions given since the implementation of HIV-1
antibody screening in early 1985,'' Roger Y. Dodd, and Lewellys F.
Barker of the American Red Cross said in an accompanying editorial.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by a virus that
damages the body's immune system, leaving victims susceptible to
infections and cancer. It is spread most often through sexual
contact, needles or syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood
or blood products and from pregnant women to their offspring.
   The current, licensed test cannot detect the AIDS virus until the
body's immune system has produced antibodies to fight the virus,
usually at four weeks after infection, Allain said.
   The new test, developed by Abbott Laboratories, searches for
viral particles known as antigens, which appear about two weeks
after infection.
   ``At this stage, the HIV is highly infectious, higher than at any
other stage,'' Allain said.
   Beyond that point, the immune system produces antibodies that
repress reproduction of the HIV virus, Allain said.
   The test currently is awaiting approval by the Food and Drug
Administration.
   The researchers said they knew of no deaths caused by
HIV-contaminated blood plasma that had slipped through the screening
process.

   A blind bicyclist who hoped to ride from
San Francisco to the nation's capital to demonstrate the ableness of
the disabled is finishing her trip in a van because of a foot
infection.
   Deeanne Eggleston lost her sight 10 years ago from complications
of diabetes that also left her with little feeling in her feet and a
locked ankle joint.
   ``We may have different limbs, eyes or minds, but underneath we
still have the same heart,'' she said Wednesday during a stop in
Bristol.
   Eggleston, 38, left her hometown of San Francisco on April 1. An
ulcer on one of her feet became infected and she had to have surgery
in Memphis. She was there for two weeks before continuing northeast
through Nashville and Bristol in the van.

<HEAD>First Running of Bulls in Pamplona Slightly Injures 30</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PAMPLONA, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The bulls once again thundered through
Pamplona's cobblestone streets today, and police said 30 of the
1,000 daredevils who ran ahead of the animals suffered minor
injuries in the race made famous by Ernest Hemingway.
   This year's running of the bulls came a day after two bombs
exploded in the city, wrecking two cars but injuring no one.
   During the run 29 people suffered bruises and scrapes after
falling or being trampled by the bulls and the steers guiding them
through a half-mile of narrow streets in Pamplona's old quarter.
Police said one young woman fainted and hurt herself when she fell
to the ground.
   The weeklong festival is held annually from July 6-14 in honor of
San Fermin, Pamplona's patron saint.
   Hemingway's 1926 novel, ``The Sun Also Rises,'' describes in
detail the rowdy, round-the-clock festival that starts daily with
the morning runs of the bulls. Each evening, matadors kill the six
bulls that ran that morning.
   In the first running today, the bulls covered the half-mile from
their pens to the bull ring in three minutes, 10 seconds.
   Thursday's bombs wrecked the cars of two politicians who belong
to the Popular Union party, police said. The group is widely
believed to be the political arm of the Basque separatist group ETA.
   No group claimed responsibility for the attacks.
   ETA, whose initials stand for Basque Homeland and Liberty, has
killed more than 600 people since it began a violent campaign for
independence for the northern, three-province Basque region in 1968.
   Pamplona is the capital of the autonomous region of Navarre,
which borders the Basque region. ETA also seeks the annexation of
Navarre.
   During the festival, the city's population of 200,000 balloons to
double its size because of the influx of tourists from around the
world.
   The event, first held in 1394, has been held each year since
1591. Since then, bulls have gored 52 people to death, including 13
since 1924, according to city records.

   Secretary of State James A.
Baker III today criticized Israel's Likud party for imposing new
restrictions on the holding of Palestinian elections in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Baker said the Likud action was ``not helpful,'' but he noted the
step was taken by a political party and was not a government action.
   Speaking to reporters at the conclusion of a meeting of key
Southeast Asian nations, Baker said the United States will continue
to support the Israeli government's proposals for Palestinian
elections in the occupied territories.
   Among other restrictions, the Likud resolution said there can be
no such elections so long as the 19-month Palestinian ``intefadah,''
or uprising, persists.
   The elections would be for Palestinians to choose leaders for the
purpose of opening settlement talks with Israeli authorities.
   Baker spoke to reporters after attending a meeting of the
six-nation Southeast Asian Nations and other interested parties. He
is to fly later today to the Arabian peninsula nation of Oman.
   Additionally, Baker said he and his ASEAN colleagues agreed on
the importance of maintaining open lines with China. While
denouncing the ``horrible'' actions of the Chinese in cracking down
on pro-democracy demonstrators a month ago, Baker said there was
agreement that outsiders ``must encourage China's full return to the
international community.''
   The principal topic of discussion was how next to deal with the
situation in Cambodia once Vietnam completes its scheduled troop
withdrawal by the end of September.
   Baker said that he had received assurances from Soviet officials
of their willingness to establish an international peacekeeping
force to guard against the outbreak of war in that country once the
Vietnamese are gone.
   Baker said it would be his preference that the Khmer Rouge, who
ruled with a heavy hand from 1975-1978, not be represented in any
provisional government that may form after Hanoi's forces withdraw.
   He acknowledged too that he is in disagreeement with former
Cambodia head of state, Price Norodom Sihanouk, on this issue.
   Sihanouk has said that it is better to have moderate elements of
the Khmer Rouge in government than to have the rebel movement to
continue its armed struggle in the field.
   In earlier remarks to his ASEAN colleagues, Baker said there is a
critical need for ASEAN and western unity to insure the emergence
and survival of a new independent Cambodia.
   ``This new Cambodia must be free to determine its own future and
it must not be dominated by the murderous Khmer Rouge,'' he said.
   He called for a comprehensive solution encompassing a cease-fire,
measures to control the Khmer Rouge effectively, transitional
power-sharing arrangements and free elections.

   Officials of Amnesty International said today they
are worried about the fate of Sudanese leaders who were toppled in a
military coup last week.
   The London-based human rights group said it was seeking
assurances ``that all those detained are not being ill-treated and
that they are being allowed prompt access to legal counsel,
relatives and independent medical examiners.''
   It also said in its statement that if the detainees were not
being charged with a crime, they should be released without delay.
   The Sudanese army said late Thursday that soldiers surrounded the
hideout of ousted Prime Minister Sadek el-Mahdi and captured him
when he tried to escape.
   El-Mahdi, who led a civilian government, went into hiding after
the coup. Soon afterward, the junta arrested about 45 senior
politicians and members of the ousted regime.
   Amnesty International also recalled that before the coup, it had
expressed concern about killings and torture committed by government
forces and civilian militias in the southern Sudan.
   Rebels in that region have been fighting the government for more
autonomy.

detained her, police said.
   West Berlin police said they spotted the woman, whom they
described as ``apparently intoxicated,'' climbing up a ladder braced
against the wall at about 4 a.m. in the southern part of the city.
   East Berlin border guards immediately took the woman into custody
and escorted her away, police said.
   At about the same time, a 64-year-old West Berlin woman called a
local police station to report her 28-year-old daughter had

   Police said the description of the daughter matched that of the

   A police chief says his plea for people to
turn in weapons and ammunition brought an immediate response, and he
hopes other police agencies will follow his lead.
   ``If by getting these weapons off the streets we save even one
life, it would be worth it,'' said Paul Reque, chief of police for
the Town of Grand Chute, a rural community of about 11,200 people.
   Reque announced late last month he would accept any and all guns
and ammunition, legal or illegal, no questions asked, from anyone
who brought them to the police station during business hours from
July 1-15.
   The goal, he said, was to get dangerous weapons out of homes
where they can pose a lethal risk to children. Wisconsin has had
several cases in recent weeks of shootings involving children in
their homes.

<HEAD>Exxon Agrees to Permit State to Interview its Records Employees</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Exxon Co. USA said it will make employees
available for questioning in the state investigation of how some
copies of company records on the Exxon Valdez oil spill were
destroyed.
   Company officials said Thursday that the destroyed records were
backup computer files and that ``all primary records and documents''
on the spill remained on other computer tapes in company possession.
   ``I can assure you of Exxon's continued cooperation in assisting
your office to fully understand the circumstances and insignificance
of the computer backup-tape matter,'' Exxon lawyer E.D. Ackerman
wrote Alaska Attorney General Douglas Baily.
   Baily demanded Wednesday that Exxon allow the state to take
depositions from employees involved in the records destruction,
which Exxon says was an accident. He termed it ``potentially a loss
of devastating proportions.''
   David Ramseur, a spokesman for Gov. Steve Cowper, said Exxon had
agreed to supply affidavits next week from employees who handled the
records. Baily said he hoped to get the depositions under way within
two weeks.
   Les Rogers, an Exxon spokesman in Houston, said the affidavits
are part of an internal company report on the tape incident, which
will be provided to the state.
   The oil company is under state and federal court orders to
preserve its records of the March 24 tanker spill in which nearly 11
million gallons of Alaska crude oil fouled Prince William Sound.
   While the state has not yet filed any spill-related lawsuits
against Exxon, it plans to by the end of summer, Baily said.
   Baily said he became aware of the records destruction when he was
contacted by a New York Times reporter who had interviewed the main
Exxon employee involved, Kenneth A. Davis.
   Davis told the newspaper that he had inadvertently destroyed the
files and feared he was being made a scapegoat to cover his
superiors' negligence in protecting company records. Davis was fired
June 8, the day after the damage was discovered, the Times reported.
   The destroyed material included internal memos and
word-processing documents from Exxon Shipping Co., which owns the
Exxon Valdez, and Exxon USA, the newspaper said.
   Exxon's Ackerman said the records were lost when the computer
tapes were inadvertently ``written over'' with other information.
The tapes normally are kept for a time to restore the computer
system should its primary tapes be damaged.
   ``These backup tapes normally would be recycled every few weeks
and are not intended to serve as a permanent archive of Exxon
documents,'' he said.
   In San Diego, meanwhile, the Coast Guard said it will provide the
Exxon Valdez with a protective escort Tuesday when the damaged
tanker arrives at the the National Steel and Shipbuilding Co.
shipyard for repairs.
   Seven Coast Guard and Harbor Police boats will maintain a 300-to
500-yard safety zone around the tanker as it travels through the San
Diego bay to keep boat-borne gawkers and protesters from impeding
the vessel, Coast Guard Cmdr. Jack Scarborough said Thursday.

<HEAD>`Outer Limits' Narrator Vic Perrin Dies At Age 73</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Actor and announcer Vic Perrin, who provided
the spooky voice that told viewers of ``The Outer Limits'' TV show
that their sets had just been taken over by mysterious forces, has
died of cancer. He was 73.
   Perrin, who died Tuesday at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, was
known to millions in the 1960s for saying at the beginning of each
``Outer Limits'' show: ``There is nothing wrong with your television
set. ... Do not attempt to adjust the picture. ... We are
controlling transmission.''
   He would come on again at the show's conclusion to ``return
control'' of the set to the viewer and leave the audience with a
moral for that week's episode of the science fiction anthology
series.
   Perrin, born in Menomonee Falls, Wis., graduated from the
University of Wisconsin before moving West in 1940. In Hollywood, he
embarked on a career in radio that was to make his voice, if not his
face or name, known to millions.
   His worked as a radio announcer for both ABC and NBC and was a
regular on such shows as the radio version of ``Gunsmoke,'' ``One
Man's Family,'' ``Fort Laramie'' and ``Yours Truly Johnny Dollar.''
   In 1956, Perrin joined ``The CBS Radio Workshop'' a short-lived
but critically praised series that broadcast experimental dramas and
classics, including a narration by Aldous Huxley of his ``Brave New
World.''
   Later, Perrin appeared regularly on such TV shows as ``Dragnet,''
``Mission Impossible,'' ``Gunsmoke,'' ``Star Trek,'' ``Big Valley''
and ``Maverick.''
   He also was the announcer on several commercials, but refused to
go before the cameras to sell products, saying that ``if they see me
in a commercial, they can't believe me as an actor.''
   Perrin's voice can still be heard on reruns of ``The Outer
Limits,'' which originally aired form 1963 to 1965, and at Disney
World's The Spaceship Earth and Exxon Energy Pavilion attractions.
   He is survived by his wife, Rita; a son; and a stepson. A
memorial service was scheduled for Wednesday in Studio City.

   The Security Council passed a resolution
saying it ``deeply regrets'' Israel's continued expulsions of
Palestinians from the occupied lands.
   With the United States abstaining, the 15-nation council on
Thursday voted 14-0 for the resolution that cites the deportations
last month of eight Palestinians.
   ``This proves once again the irrelevance of the whole
institution,'' Ambassador Johanan Bein of Israel said after the
meeting. ``On the day of a major terrorist attack, in which 14
people are dead and 27 wounded, the Security Council finds fit to
deal with expulsions.''
   He was referring to an attack in which a Palestinian shouting
``God is great!'' seized the steering wheel of an Israeli bus on the
highway outside Jerusalem and caused it to veer into a ravine where
it exploded in flames.
   U.S. Ambassador Thomas R. Pickering said the United States
opposes expulsions but abstained from voting on the resolution
because it did not take into account the violence and security
problems facing Israel.
   Israel has expelled about 55 Palestinians since the Palestinian
uprising against Israeli rule of the Gaza Strip and West Bank began
19 months ago.
   The United States, Israel's staunch ally, frequently votes in
favor of Israel. By not exercising its veto power as one of five
permanent members of the Security Council, the United States
delivered a rare, but mild, chastizing of Israel.
   The resolution was adopted after days of negotiations in which
the United States succeeded in changing its language from
``deplores'' to ``deeply regrets.''
   ``In the absence of incitement and violence, expulsions would not
be necessary,'' Bein said. ``Should quiet be restored, the
possibility of allowing the return of the expelled persons will be
considered.''
   Since the uprising began, 550 Palestinians and 23 Israelis have
been killed.
   Bein said the expelled were involved in activities ranging from
throwing fire bombs and hand grenades to planting bombs, possessing
arms, blocking roads and imposing a reign of terror on the local
population.
   ``Expulsions, therefore, were the only means left to curtail
these activities,'' he said.
   The resolution, sponsored by Syria and the Arab League, demands
that Israel ensure the immediate return to the territories of
deported Palestinians and stop deportations.
   It cites the Geneva Convention of 1949, which covers treatment of
civilians in time of war and prohibits expulsions. Israel says the
convention permits limited deportations under special conditions,
and that its expulsions qualify.
   Current members of the council are Algeria, Brazil, Canada,
Colombia, Ethiopia, Finland, Nepal, Malaysia, Senegal, Yugoslavia
and the five permanent members: the United States, Soviet Union,
Britain, China and France.

<TEXT>
   President Bush was nearing a final decision on
a proposal that would give most senior federal officials pay
increases of 25 percent, matching a salary hike he has already
advocated for federal judges, White House officials said today.
   But while the announcement was expected by day's end, Bush still
had not signed off on details of the proposals, said one official,
who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
   ``It's still on his desk,'' the official said.
   Both The Washington Post and The Washington Times reported that
Bush would formally ask Congress today for the pay raise for top
officials and would couple it with a proposed ban on congressional
honoraria.
   Sources said the proposal now on Bush's desk does not contain a
specific pay raise proopsal for Congress to go along with the
proposed limit on outside income.
   Bush has advocated pay raises in general for Congress, but has
decided to steer clear of becoming ensnared in what is always a
poltically treacherous issue on Capitol Hill, deciding instead to
let Congress resolve the matter itself, the sources said.
   An announcement on the pay issue seemed likely today as the
president sought to clear away unfinished business before embarking
Sunday on a nine-day trip to Europe that will include the
seven-nation economic summit in Paris.
   The Washington Post said Bush's pay package would include
increases of as much as 200 percent for a small number of
``critically skilled'' federal workers.
   However, sources said the increase for most other senior federal
officials would be an across-the-board 25 percent.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater on Thursday night said the
White House expects to announce the president's decisions today.
   G. Jerry Shaw, counsel to the Senior Executives Association, said
he had heard the president's proposal would be for 25 percent but
had not received definitive word on that point.
   ``We strongly support the raise,'' Shaw said.
   The association, however, has opposed larger increases for key
specialists such as physicians the government is having trouble
recruiting and training.
   The 7,200 members of the government's Senior Executive Service
and 800 top presidentially appointed executives currently make
$68,700 to $80,700. Their pay is tied to the $89,500 that members of
Congress get, and the rejection of the congressional pay increase in
February meant no raise for them or for judges.
   A private commission headed by former Federal Reserve Board
Chairman Paul Volker recommended a 25 percent increase immediately
followed by a similar amount in 1991, applying to judges, executive
branch officials, members of Congress and others such as top
military officers.
   The newspaper said Bush had decided not to change his previously
announced proposals for Congress to decide its own pay increase and
for a ban on honoraria, the fees members of Congress get for making
speeches.

<HEAD>Louisiana Wants To Test 1973 Court Ruling On Abortion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY COATES</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Louisiana House has asked district
attorneys to enforce a criminal law that was on the books before the
landmark 1973 U.S. Supreme Court decision giving women the right to
have abortions.
   The resolution, which does not have the force of law, was
approved 81-13 Thursday night. It now goes to the Senate, which will
give speedy passage, said Rep. Woody Jenkins.
   ``This will allow the court to face squarely the issue of whether
to uphold or overturn the 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision,'' said
Jenkins, who serves as floor leader for issues pressed by
fundamentalist churches.
   Jenkins said Monday's Supreme Court ruling, in which it upheld
Missouri's right to regulate abortion, invited states to test the
Roe vs. Wade ruling. Missouri, like Louisiana, prohibits the use of
public funds, employees or facilities for abortions.
   A check with the Louisiana State University Law Center showed
that Louisiana's pre-Roe statutes were never ruled unconstitutional,
said Jenkins.
   The chief law, said Jenkins, prohibits anyone from performing an
abortion and carries a penalty of up to 10 years in prison.
   ``We were enjoined by the federal courts from enforcing it
because of Roe vs. Wade,'' he said. ``Our resolution will have the
effect of sending the district attorneys to federal district court,
asking that the injunction be lifted.''
   Opponents said Jenkins wanted Louisiana to flout the Supreme
Court.
   ``We are saying with this resolution that we are going to go
above the court,'' said Rep. Kip Holden. ``This is not just to
provoke a ruling from the court. This is asking district attorneys
to throw doctors in jail.''
   Rep. Alphonse Jackson said the Monday ruling did not disturb a
woman's right to have an abortion in the first trimester. ``Women
have that right,'' he said.
   The Louisiana legislature is in special session to ratify the
extension of a state sales tax. Jackson noted that Gov. Buddy Roemer
did not include abortion legislation in his official call for the
six-day session. Legislators cannot draft laws on topics not covered
in the official call.
   However, House Speaker Jimmy Dimos said the resolution was not a
law. ``This urges district attorneys to act. We can offer urge and
request resolutions in this session.''
   Jenkins said he believes the district attorneys will cooperate in
a state that has such strong anti-abortion sentiment.

   Riot troops stormed two university
campuses today to break up rallies supporting a South Korean student
who defied a ban on travel to communist North Korea.
   Also today, 20,000 anti-communist protesters scuffled with police
who blocked their path to the National Assembly.
   About 1,500 riot police moved on Konkuk University in eastern
Seoul after student leaders issued a joint communique with North
Korean counterparts. Riot police searched school buildings and took
away about 200 students.
   The protest was held to support Im Su-kyong, a Seoul student who
went to North Korea for the 13th World Festival of Youth and
Students. The festival ends Saturday, and the government has said
she will be arrested and charged with national security violations
when she returns home.
   Student leaders said their communique, announced simultaneously
in North Korea, urged South and North Korean students to work
together for national unification and removal of U.S. troops from
the Korean peninsula.
   At nearby Korea University, 1,000 riot police firing tear gas
charged the campus and battled several hundred students who rallied
in support of Ms. Im. Protesters armed with firebombs, rocks and
clubs drove police back after about 20 minutes of fierce fighting.
   About 20,000 riot police sealed off all major universities in
Seoul and guarded downtown streets to prevent other rallies. Police
stopped pedestrians and cars around campuses for identification
checks and took away some students.
   The Seoul government has accused North Korea of using the
festival to dramatize calls for the withdrawal of 43,000 U.S. troops
based in South Korea under a mutual defense treaty.
   North Korea and dissidents in South Korea contend the U.S. forces
hinder unification of the peninsula, which was divided at the end of
World War II.
   The anti-communist protesters initially pushed their way through
police lines to the National Assembly, denouncing an opposition
lawmaker who visited the North. The protesters demanded punishment
of leftists and pro-North Korean dissidents. They also urged the
Party for Peace and Democracy, South Korea's largest opposition
group, to purge what they called ``pro-communist elements.''
   Shouting ``Down with the PPD!'' and ``Destroy communists!'' the
protesters scuffled with riot police who blocked the march in front
of the assembly hall. Many were elderly people who escaped North
Korea before and during the 1950-53 Korean War.
   PPD lawmaker Suh Kyung-won is under arrest after turning himself
in June 25 for traveling to see North Korean leader Kim Il Sung in
August 1988. Suh was charged with violating national security laws,
which carries a maximum penalty of death.
   South Korean authorities have arrested eight party members and
friends of Suh who were questioned in the case. South Korea says all
contacts with North Korea must be made only through official
channels.

<HEAD>Pilot Who Was Detained in India Says He's Back In U.S. To Stay</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ADDISON, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A pilot who spent 11 days in detention in
India after being intercepted on an around-the-world flight, accused
of spying for flying in a restricted area, says he'll stay at home
from now on.
   Frank Haile Jr., 58, a pilot for 20 years, has flown around the
world in a single-engine plane three times. He returned to Dallas on
Thursday to receive a warm welcome from about 15 family members and
friends.
   He promptly vowed to ``never leave the U.S. again.''
   ``When you leave the United States, you're very vulnerable,''
said Haile, owner and president of a Dallas-based engineering firm.
``If you break a rule, you have no rights. They just lock you up.''
   Haile's Beechcraft Bonanza V-35B was intercepted June 16 by
Indian Air Force planes and forced to land after the planes believed
he had strayed into restricted air space near the India-Pakistan
border.
   He and seven associates were flying in four planes from New
Dehli, India, to Bahrain.
   Dr. Howard Wisner, another of the pilots, said that because of
bad weather, the group had to adjust its course, which took the
planes ``skirting down the edge of the restricted area'' about 350
miles northwest of Bombay.
   Wisner, 62, said he heard Haile's co-pilot, Carson Gilmer of
Rocksprings, say, ``A MiG fighter just passed so close it almost
took the paint off my plane.''
   Wisner said he then heard the Indian pilot radio Gilmer and two
West Germans in a second plane to land or ``you'll have the
consequences.''
   Wisner's plane and another managed to escape while the MiG pilots
concentrated on the two other aircraft.
   Haile said the planes were forced down at an Indian air force
base, where the base commander accused them of spying.
   ``We were kept in what was like a hotel room'' in the desert town
of Bhuj, which Haile said was a poor but nice hamlet that improved
after sundown when the ``flies would all go away.''
   He said after countless interrogations, authorities were finally
convinced they were not spies and allowed them to leave June 27.
   ``When this is all over, I just want to be normal,'' said Haile's
wife, Joan. ``I just want to relax.''

   China intensified its assault on Washington today,
saying the United States has repeatedly violated the human rights of
its own people and therefore has no right to criticize China's
handling of demonstrators.
   ``During the process of quelling the recent counterrevolutionary
rebellion the American government and Congress under the pretext of
`protecting human rights' meddled with China's domestic affairs,''
said the People's Daily, the official publication of the Communist
Party.
   ``When the Chinese government on June 4 used firm methods to
quell the counterrevolutionary rebellion, the U.S. government became
furious and was the first to impose `sanctions' on China to exert
pressure on us,'' the newspaper said in a commentary.
   ``But everybody can still remember (U.S. Sen. Joe) McCarthy's
notorious anti-communist, anti-China legislation,'' the paper said.
``And 100 years after the declaration of the emancipation of
America's slaves, the discrimination faced by blacks and people of
other colors is still serious.''
   Washington suspended military sales and high-level governmental
exchanges after the Chinese army's bloody suppression of protesters
seeking democratic reforms. China says 200 to 300 people died;
Western sources and Chinese witnesses say up to 3,000 people were
killed.
   In addition to the sanctions, the Chinese government has been
angered by U.S. protection of dissident Fang Lizhi, who with his
wife, Li Shuxian, took shelter at the American Embassy shortly after
the crackdown.
   Noting U.S. criticism of South Africa and its involvement in
Korea, Vietnam and Grenada, the paper said Washington ``has never
stopped its interference with other countries' internal affairs.
This is the reality of the American `guardians of human rights'.''
   In a separate piece titled ``How America Tramples On Human
Rights,'' the Communist Party mouthpiece printed a chronology of
civil rights and antiwar protests in the United States, complete
with numbers of arrests and deaths of demonstrators.
   In another story, the People's Daily said student leaders passed
on state secrets to foreign journalists and received foreign
passports so they could escape from China.
   ``The autonomous student union, through the help of foreign
powers, even obtained passports for some 40 of their members, so
they could flee the country in the event things turned for the
worse,'' newspaper said.
   It did not name any countries that provided passports but said
considerable financial support came from the United States and
France and said people from Hong Kong operated from rooms at the
Beijing Hotel near the square to distribute money to students.
   ``The student leaders maintained illicit relations with
traitorous organizations overseas, and themselves were traitors and
collaborators,'' it said.
   The People's Daily also repeated charges that students received
money from overseas, saying: ``When the student leader `masterminds'
finally went underground, each had tens of thousands of yuan
(thousands of dollars).''
   Major Chinese papers also gave prominent play to a lengthy speech
by Beijing's conservative mayor, Chen Xitong, attacking a wide range
of intellectuals for contributing to the political environment that
fostered the democracy movement.
   Chen's speech, to the National People's Congress a week ago but
only released Thursday, took up three full newspaper pages and
lashed out at a number of writers, editors and dissidents whose
airing of political positions ``prepared for the turmoil that
ensued.''
   The spreading purge of intellectuals included news reports of the
ousting of a deputy editor-in-chief of the Huayue publishing house
in rural Shaanxi province and the burning of a book the firm
published, ``The Story of a Chinese Who Never Lies,'' because it
allegedly embraces bourgeois liberalism, or Western liberal ideas.
   He also leveled further charges at former Communist Party chief
Zhao Ziyang, who was sacked last month for his pro-student views. He
was replaced by Shanghai party chief and political hard-liner Jiang
Zemin.
   The evening news showed writers and artists saying Zhao neglected
political education and blamed him for what they said was a
proliferation of low-quality artistic works, including pornography.
   ``For many years, there was no serious and complete
implementation of the policies of the Central Committee. Before, we
didn't know what happened. Now, it's clear. The reason was Comrade
Zhao Ziyang,'' said Zhang Jiong, a researcher at the Chinese Academy
of Social Sciences.

<HEAD>Showroom Stars Voice Support of Vegas Musicians in Tape Dispute</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM DAHLBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A battle by musicians to block taped music in
resort showrooms got a boost when several stars led by Sammy Davis
Jr. rallied for live entertainment.
   ``We can't have this town, which was built on live entertainment,
live music, go the other way,'' said Davis. ``Don't let them do this
thing to us.''
   The entertainers show of support came Thursday for members of the
Musicians Union Local 369 who are locked in a dispute with five
major resorts.
   Davis, Jerry Lewis, Robert Goulet, Tony Orlando and Shecky Greene
turned out at a press conference called by the musicians to
publicize a fight musicians say will cost them dozens of their jobs.
   ``I don't want to see my friends _ the musicians _ go the way of
dinosaurs,'' Goulet said. ``For all of our sakes, let's bend a
little and come to a mutual understanding.''
   Some of the entertainers, however, professed little knowledge of
the details of the dispute, and some contradicted the union's
staunch position against eliminating jobs in production shows _
shows that feature an ensemble rather than a visiting headliner.
   ``I think that might be a concession the musicians can make,''
Lewis said, referring to the idea of using taped music at the
production shows. ``But don't bring it into the celebrity rooms,
where the Sinatras and the others perform.''
   The union is fighting a July 26 deadline three resorts have set
to eliminate musicians in production shows. The resorts, and two
others, have also proposed hiring musicians playing for showroom
singers only for the time they actually work instead of guaranteeing
them a certain number of paid weeks a year.
   ``How do you throw 45 lives away?'' Union President Mark Tully
Massagli said of those employed full-time in production shows.
``We've learned to live with some taping in town, but for an entire
production show to be put to a recording is not fair to the
musicians or the public.''
   Musicians went on strike last month against the Tropicana Hotel
when talks stalled on the resort's plan to use tape in its ``Folies
Bergere'' show and have warned of strikes against the Flamingo
Hilton, Caesars Palace, Bally's and the Las Vegas Hilton.

   A Palestinian who grabbed the steering wheel of
a bus and forced the vehicle into a ravine, killing 14 people, rode
the route several times to choose the moment for the attack,
newspapers said today.
   The bearded attacker, identified only as a Palestinian refugee
camp resident, told investigators he was avenging beatings of family
members by soldiers, Israeli newspapers said.
   National Police Commissioner David Krauss announced a second
injured suspect was detained in connection with the bus crash
Thursday, the bloodiest assault since the Palestinian uprising began
19 months ago. Army radio identified him as the attacker's father,
but a police source denied that.
   Anger in Israel brought calls for imposing the death penalty on
terrorists.
   Arab newspapers hailed the attack.
   At the funeral of one Israeli victim in Jerusalem, security
forces rescued Finance Minister Shimon Peres from hundreds of people
shouting and pounding on his car. Peres heads the center-left Labor
Party, which calls for giving up occupied land for peace.
   Police on horseback dispersed supporters of the anti-Arab Kach
movement at a Jerusalem rally after 200 attacked officers arresting
six unruly protesters.
   ``Kill those who come to kill you!'' American-born Kach leader
Rabbi Meir Kahane told 1,000 supporters who screamed back, ``Death
to Arabs!''
   At another victim's funeral, Cabinet Minister Avner Shaki of the
National Religious Party demanded harsh measures.
   ``We must make supreme efforts at the next Cabinet meeting to ...
look for new, stubborn, non-routine and harsh ways so this filthy
Arab terrorism will end,'' said Shaki, who has no portfolio.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said the attack was ``the fruit of
a disgusting mind, wracked with hatred.''
   Jerusalem's daily Haaretz said the attacker ``planned in
detail,'' riding buses several times along route No. 405 from Tel
Aviv to Jerusalem, studying the road and drivers' behavior.
   The daily Hadashot said the suspect ``caused the bus to swerve at
a point in the road where the security barrier is the lowest and the
drop is dozens of meters.''
   Pro-government newspapers in the Persian Gulf praise the attack.
   Bahrain's Akhbar al-Khaleej said it was a ``unique and bold
operation ... affirming that the Palestinian people will not be
broken.''
   Qatar's al-Raya said, ``The bold guerrilla operation by a young
Palestinian man affirmed to the Zionist enemy that ... the Israelis
cannot continue with their repressive practices and brutal
oppression without a Palestinian response.''
   A senior Palestine Liberation Organization official in Tunisia,
Bassam Abu Sharif, said the attack was ``a human reaction by someone
who has had his children killed, seen families deported, houses
demolished.''
   The crash Thursday was the worst attack in Israel since a PLO
assault on a bus on March 11, 1978, that killed 33 people and
wounded 82.
   The crowded state-owned bus plunged Thursday into a 200-foot
ravine and exploded in flames after the attacker, shouting ``God is
Great!'' grabbed the steering wheel. The phrase is a rallying cry
for the uprising.
   The attacker was slightly hurt in the crash and arrested at the
scene, seven miles west of Jerusalem.
   Police said two of the dead were Canadians, the first foreigners
killed since the uprising began. They were identified as Shelley
Halpenny, a dentist in her mid-30s from Vancouver, British Columbia,
and Fern Rykiss, 17, of Winnipeg, Manitoba. Ten other fatalities
were identified as Israelis. The nationalities of the remaining two
were not known Thursday, but the U.S. Embassy said they were not
believed to be American.
   Twenty-seven passengers were injured and 25 remained hospitalized
today, five in serious condition, officials said. U.S. diplomats
said eight Amnerican passport holders were among them but refused to
identify the victims.
   Hospital officials identified four as Rita Levine, 39, in serious
condition; Eliezra Ben-Yehuda Cassuto, 53, in moderate condition;
and Paul Fingersh, 25, and Victor Assal, 24, with minor injuries.
Hometowns were not available. Mrs. Cassuto of New York is the
granddaughter of Eliezer Ben-Yahuda, a famous Jewish scholar who
helped revive Hebrew as a spoken language.
   Reuven Hazak, former head of the Shin Bet security service, told
Israel army radio the attack probably is linked to the Palestinian
uprising against Israeli rule in the occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip.
   Arab reports said the assailant is believed to belong to either
Hamas or Islamic Jihad, which are fundamentalist Moslem groups.
Security officials told Israel radio they suspect
``nationalistic-religious motives.''
   Thursday's victims bring the toll in the uprising to 33 Israelis
and two Canadians killed. At least 546 Palsetinian have been killed.

<TEXT>
   The last of five cloistered Roman
Catholic nuns has left her monastery after spending nine months
barricaded in the infirmary to protest liberal changes.
   Sister Teresita, who with four others locked herself in the room
on Oct. 4, left the Carmelite monastery Thursday, leaving no word on
her destination, said Tim Manning, a spokesman for the diocese of
Paterson.
   ``She indicated to another sister that she was going to a safe
place and would be in touch with Mother Theresa Hewitt,'' the
monastery's prioress, Manning said.
   Last Friday, three other nuns ended their self-imposed exile,
leaving only Sister Teresita in the infirmary. The three left with
an Akron, N.Y., priest, according to laywoman Betty Sutton, a
spokeswoman for the rebellious nuns.
   Neither Ms. Sutton nor Manning knew if Sister Teresita was to
join the other three nuns or how to reach them, they said.
   The five nuns began their protest quietly last October at the
monastery about 25 miles from New York City but soon found
themselves in a bitter struggle with Paterson Bishop Frank Rodimer
and their prioress.
   Reached by The Associated Press in March, Sister John of the
Cross, one of the five, said the group objected to reforms
instituted by the newly appointed prioress. They included such
things as candy, television and popular music that she said
detracted from the prayerful atmosphere intended by the founders of
the Carmelite order.
   The five held out through threatened evictions by Rodimer, hoping
their appeal to the Vatican would overrule the bishop's order to
leave the monastery. But in February, the Vatican affirmed Rodimer's
authority and the bishop ordered the nuns to leave.
   The first of the five protesting nuns left the monastery in
March, because of health problems.

<HEAD>FDA Banning Sale of Non-Prescription Creams Sold to Grow Hair</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration said today it
is banning the sale of non-prescription creams and lotions whose
manufacturers claim they grow hair or prevent baldness, because none
has proven effective.
   The FDA said in today's Federal Register that no manufacturer has
been able to show that such a product works.
   The ban applies to products available without a prescription that
are used externally. These products are usually sold by mail or
through barbers or beauticians.
   The ban will become effective in six months, the FDA said.
   The FDA also said there is no evidence that vitamins, food
supplements or other products taken orally retard baldness or grow
hair. The agency said it will remove these products from the market
on a case-by-case basis if their distributors continue to make such
claims.
   The only product approved by the FDA for stimulating hair growth
on the crown of the head is a prescription drug that is a 2 percent
solution of minoxidil, which is applied externally. The drug is
manufactured by The Upjohn Co. and sold under the name Rogaine.
   The FDA's ban is based on a recommendation of an advisory panel
that evaluated a number of ingredients, including lanolin, olive
oil, wheat germ oil and vitamins. The panel found none of these
prevented baldness or promoted hair growth.
   The FDA said that once the ban is in effect, manufacturers of any
non-prescription drug claiming to prevent baldness or grow hair will
have to provide proof to the agency that it is safe and effective
before it can be put on the market.

<DATELINE>FRIARS POINT, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   White residents are complaining about
their lack of representation on the board of aldermen, so town
leaders have asked their lawyer to study creation of a
white-majority district.
   ``I'm in favor of this,'' Mayor James Washington, who is black,
said after hearing a petition read from white residents. They
comprise about 15 percent of the 1,400 residents of the Mississippi
River town.
   The petition asked aldermen to create four wards, including one
with a 65 percent white voting-age population, and a fifth at-large
slot on the council.
   Over the past 10 years, federal lawsuits have forced more than 30
Mississippi cities to change the way they elect city government
officials to allow for greater black representation. However, Friars
Point is the first municipality to consider greater white
representation.
   ``We don't deserve to have three places, or even two on the
board,'' said John Yount, who presented the petition Wednesday. ``We
just want to be involved in what's going on and have a voice to
represent our interests.''
   Friars Point had at least one white member on the board until new
municipal officials took office Monday and the council became all
black.
   Currently, all members of Friars Point's board of aldermen are
elected at-large, meaning all voters cast ballots for each member.
   The petition claimed that at-large system discriminated against
white residents and violated the one-person, one-vote principle.
   Board members voted unanimously to have the town attorney study
the feasibility of drawing up districts and report the findings at
an aldermen meeting July 13.
   ``The majority of the board were in favor of going to the ward
system. An expert should be employed to study population
demographics and ward lines,'' said the attorney, Hunter Twiford.
   If the council does vote to change, it would require federal
court and Justice Department approval under the Voting Rights Act of
1965.
   Yount said he was pleased with the petition's reception. He said
the aldermen's cooperation would save the taxpayers money.
   ``We don't want a lawsuit,'' he said. ``If we went to court and
won, the town would have to pay attorney's fees. We don't want that.
We just want someone to represent us.''

<HEAD>Ex-Employee Testifies Mrs. Helmsley Approved Business Money For Mansion</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Hotel maven Leona Helmsley personally approved
the reimbursement of cash from business accounts to pay for some
expenses at the Helmsleys' country estate in Connecticut, a former
employee testified.
   William Piacitelli, the first witness at Mrs. Helmsley's federal
tax evasion trial, also said Thursday that the cost of renovations
and other expenses, even groceries, were spread over several
Helmsley companies.
   Piacitelli, fired as controller of the Helmsley-controlled
Hospitality Services Co., said Mrs. Helmsley would obtain cash for
the estate by having employees fill out business expense sheets.
   ``Who approved petty cash reimbursements?'' asked Assistant U.S.
Attorney James DeVita.
   ``Mrs. Helmsley,'' Piacitelli responded.
   ``Personally?'' DeVita asked.
   ``Personally,'' he said.
   Mrs. Helmsley, 69, is on trial in Manhattan federal court charged
with evading taxes by disguising $4 million in renovations and
operating costs at her Connecticut mansion as business expenses. She
also faces other fraud and extortion charges.
   Harry Helmsley, 80, who was indicted in April 1988 with his wife,
was removed from the trial after U.S. District Judge John Walker Jr.
found him mentally incompetent.
   The Helmsleys head a $5 billion real estate and hotel empire.
They purchased Dunnellen Hall, in Greenwich, Conn., in the summer of
1983 for $11 million.
   The Harley Hotel chain paid for tens of thousands of dollars of
landscaping work at the estate because the company had a hotel in
Enfield, Conn., Piacitelli said.
   In other testimony, Piacitelli said his company used the initials
``D.H.'' in business records to indicate money paid out to Dunnellen
Hall.
   He said when he was asked in 1983 by an outside accountant to
explain what ``D.H.'' stood for, he responded, ``Don't hask.''
   Soon after, Piacitelli said Frank Turco, his boss and a
co-defendant at the trial, wrote a memo saying the money had
``inadvertently'' been paid out as a business expense and that the
company should be reimbursed.
   ``Were any of these payments inadvertent?'' asked DeVita.
   ``No,'' Piacitelli said.
   ``They were done deliberately,'' DeVita said.
   ``Yes, they were,'' the witness said.
   Piacitelli said he was fired from his job as controller in
February 1986 despite a personal plea to Mrs. Helmsley.
   The defense said in its opening arguments that it will show that
the expenses were lawful because the estate was used for business
purposes.

<HEAD>Police Report Incidents Of Tainted Wine; No One Injured</HEAD>

   Several bottles of cheap wine
tainted with a soapy solution or broken glass have been found
recently in areas frequented by transients, but no one has been
injured, police said.
   The tamperings might have been attempts to harm the homeless, but
if so, they were clumsy ones, police said. Officers noted that the
bottle seals had obviously been broken and the caps simply screwed
back on. The bottles were full.
   ``No one, under any circumstances, would want to have anything to
do with bottles like that,'' Sgt. Richard Glaus said. ``We made an
assumption, and we think it's a big assumption, that there might be
an intent to do harm.''
   The first three bottles were reported by a woman on May 27 at
Vera Cruz Park, an area often frequented by homeless people in this
seaside community 90 miles northwest of Los Angeles.
   The three bottles of Boones Farm Strawberry Hill contained a
soapy liquid, Glaus said. The liquid has not been tested.
   Last Saturday, three more tainted bottles, containing small bits
of broken glass, were found near railroad tracks and near a pathway
to a beach often used by homeless people, Glaus said.
   Police also had a report from a man who said he found some wine
that looked tainted June 27 but had thrown the bottles away.

<HEAD>NATO Commander Doesn't Want Talks on Short-Range Weapons</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NATO's supreme commander in Europe, Gen. John
Galvin, said today the Warsaw Pact's superiority in conventional
weapons is much more of a threat than its superiority in short-range
nuclear arms.
   Galvin also said that jumping into negotiations on reducing
short-range nuclear forces could make it tougher to bring the Warsaw
Pact to the bargaining table to discuss conventional weapons.
   ``If we get into the shorter-range nuclear forces too early,
we're giving away the major motivating idea, because the Soviets do
want to see us get rid of nuclear weapons,'' said Galvin. ``They are
not so anxious to get rid of conventional weapons.''
   He was commenting on Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev's
statement Thursday that the Warsaw Pact could agree on unilateral
cuts in Soviet short-range nuclear missiles in Eastern Europe if
NATO would negotiate reductions on those weapons. Galvin said the
Soviets have 1,400 short-range missiles launchers compared with
NATO's 88.
   Galvin also said that despite the appeal of glasnost, or
openness, he questioned whether Europe was safer because of the risk
of Soviet instability.
   ``I applaud the way the Soviet Union is moving,'' said Galvin.
``But it's a rocky road they're heading down. They're saying they
can't turn back, but they don't know precisely where they're going.''
   He also discussed the crash Tuesday of a Soviet MiG-23, which
zoomed across Western Europe, apparently missed by Soviet radar,
after its pilot ejected over Poland. The plane eventually crashed in
Belgium, killing a man in his house.
   Galvin said NATO troops' ability to spot the jet on radar and
follow it proved the Allied system works.
   ``Mathias Rust is one thing _ a little tiny plane flying at low
altitudes.'' said Galvin. ``But this plane took off from their own
airfield and was flying at high altitude.''
   He was referring to West German teen-ager Mathias Rust's ability
to evade Soviet air defenses two years ago and fly a small plane
into Red Square.
   Two U.S. F-15 fighters scrambled from a NATO base in the
Netherlands ``as a policing action'' as the Mig-23 crossed into
Western Europe on Tuesday, said Galvin. They shadowed it, hoping it
would crash into the North Sea.
   Galvin said he accepted Moscow's explanation that the incident
was an accident. The pilot ejected after reporting the plane was
smoking. The Soviets say their radar missed the MiG-23 as it flew on
for 500 miles.
   Galvin said the U.S. pilots did not shoot down the Mig-23 or move
alongside and tip it over because it was flying over populated areas.

   Thousands of people today defied martial
law and rallied in memory of citizens killed during military
crackdowns, waving flags and shouting slogans, witnesses and
diplomats said.
   Western diplomats said groups of up to several hundred students
gathered in the center of Rangoon. Official Rangoon Radio said six
students were arrested.
   Up to 1,000 students gathered outside the gates of Rangoon
University in an attempt to lay a wreath, but armed troops forced
them to leave, said one diplomat who asked not to be identified by
name.
   Diplomats reported that soldiers blocked off some streets in an
effort to control the sporadic protests.
   Leading opposition figure Aung San Suu Kyi, speaking to a crowd
of several thousand in Rangoon, repeated her denunciations of the
ruling military for its refusal to hold talks with opposition
groups, a witness said.
   She spoke during a ceremony to remember a massacre of students
after the 1962 military coup and those killed during army crackdowns
on pro-democracy protests last year.
   Dozens of students were killed when the military put down a
demonstration at Rangoon University 26 years ago and blew up the
student union building.
   Several thousand were killed last year when troops crushed months
of pro-democracy demonstrations.
   Burma's former leader, Ne Win, is held responsible for ordering
both the 1962 and 1988 massacres. He officially relinquished control
in July 1988, but Suu Kyi has repeatedly charged that he is the
power behind the nominal head of state, Saw Maung.
   Suu Kyi, general secretary of the largest oppostion group, the
National League for Democracy, has drawn big crowds that have defied
martial law to hear her speak in Rangoon. Under existing military
law, gatherings of more than five people are forbidden.
   ``General Saw Maung and U Ne Win have identical views in their
disregard for dialogue and civil authority,'' Suu Kyi said.
   Residents said many people stayed indoors to avoid anticipated
clashes and some shops in the city closed during the afternoon.
   But witnesses said the military appeared to be keeping a low
profile and did not attempt to prevent political leaders from
speaking.
   On Wednesday, more than 10,000 Burmese rallied to hear Suu Kyi
speak in what Rangoon-based diplomats said was the largest political
gathering since last September.

   Police today shot and killed three
escaped convicts and captured three others after the group tried to
rob a bank, then hijacked a bus and took a 12-year-old boy hostage,
officials said.
   The shootout ended a chase that began Thursday when the six men
tried to rob a branch of the Bahia State Bank in Uaua, in
northeastern Brazil, said the head of the Bahia State Security
Bureau, Carlos Anselmo.
   The men, armed with revolvers and a shotgun, had escaped from the
medium-security Lemos de Brito penitentiary, Anselmo said by
telephone from the state capital, Salvador.
   The men stopped a bus carrying about 40 passengers and ordered
the driver to head for Conceicao do Coite, a city of 60,000 people
200 miles away, Anselmo said.
   In Conceicao do Coite, scores of police surrounded the bus and
exchanged gunfire with the hijackers. Three passengers were slightly
injured, said a city official, Jackson Ferreira.
   Before dawn today, the hijackers took several hostages from the
bus and fled in a car provided by local authorities. Outside of
town, they released all the hostages except a 12-year-old boy, then
abandoned the car and fled on foot through the brush, Ferreira said.
   Police tracked the group to a remote cottage, surrounded it and
opened fire, killing three of the escapees and capturing the others,
Ferreira said. He said the hostage was released unharmed.
   ``This was a little paradise. There's never been anything like
this here before,'' said Ferreira. ``Today's a holiday for the
town's anniversary, but now the celebration is ruined.''

   Community leaders today broke ground
for a memorial to 14 people who were killed in the collapse of a
three-story department store during a torrential rain a year ago
today.
   ``For a brief moment in our day-to-day lives, everybody in this
community stopped ... to climb upon a rock pile and rub elbows with
some of the people that they pass on a day-to-day basis without ever
stopping,'' said Rusty Faulk, who was local disaster chairman for
the American Red Cross.
   Residents gathered this morning to remember the 14 people who
died July 7, 1988, when the Amigo Store collapsed in this border
town. At least 47 other people were injured.
   The memorial, which includes a palm tree planted near the former
store for each of the victims, was donated by the Rotary Club of
Brownsville-Sunrise. The memorial also honors the survivors and
hundreds of people who joined the rescue effort.
   Mayor Ygnacio Garza, who in the past year has also led the city
through a hurricane and a series of drug cult murders at nearby
Matamoros, Mexico, said people from out of town most often ask about
the Amigo Store disaster.
   ``They remember how the community responded, how we worked
together to save lives,'' Garza said.
   Store owner Bernard Levin, who was in the building when it
collapsed, escaped unscathed but said the thought of death and
suffering remain.
   ``Naturally, I feel a little beat,'' Levin said Wednesday. ``It's
very hard for me to keep going. Like today, it poured down raining
and I thought back to the Amigo Store.''
   Dr. Carmen Rocco, who treated survivors and consoled families
while rescuers clawed through the rubble, said she recalls events
just before the disaster and after the site was cleared.
   ``In between, there was so much pain and so much tragedy that I
really blocked it out,'' she said. ``All I really remember is an
incredible thunderstorm, and today we had one of those.''
   All that remains at the site a year later is vinyl flooring, the
tiles at the entrance and a gaping hole in the downtown business
district.
   Levin faces personal injury lawsuits seeking millions of dollars
in damages. The city, Public Utilities Board and various
construction firms and suppliers have been named as defendants, too.
   Among the survivors was 32-year-old Mexican Jose Luis Gaytan who
suffered brain damage while trapped in the rubble and no longer is
able to teach school, said Ernesto Gamez, his attorney.
   No official report has been released to explain what caused the
three-story structure to collapse in a storm that dumped two inches
of rain on the city in 30 minutes. The store was built in 1969 and
the third floor added in 1975.
   Dr. Lorenzo Pelly, who hitchhiked to the scene from Brownsville
Medical Center, said: ``The first thing I saw there was a guy who
had his face crushed between a parking meter and a car parked there
on the street.''
   Pelly said the outpouring of volunteers from throughout the lower
Rio Grande Valley united the region, but he regrets the bickering
among rescuers and the decision to dig instead of looking first for
survivors.
   Survivors were not located until hours later.

<HEAD>Coast Guard Uncovers Huge Cocaine Stash in Key West</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: ADDS 1 graf with other large cocaine seizures.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KEY WEST, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Coast Guard uncovered more than a
1{ tons of cocaine in a hidden compartment of a Panamanian freighter
in one of its biggest drug busts ever, a spokesman said today.
   ``This is a tremendous seizure for us. We're ecstatic,'' said
Coast Guard Lt. Jeff Karonis.
   The freighter Barlovento left Tampico, Mexico, earlier this week
headed for the Dominican Republic and following a major drug
trafficking route. It was intercepted about 350 miles southwest of
Miami after Coast Guard and Customs aircraft tracked it with the
help of a ship-mounted radar balloon.
   ``The U.S. State Department went to the Panamanian Embassy in
Washington and we were given approval to go ahead and board the
ship,'' Karonis said.
   The Coast Guard cutters Shearwater and Citkinak failed to find
contraband in their initial search so they brought the 162-foot
vessel to Key West, he said.
   The cocaine was found Thursday night hidden between fuel and
water tanks in a sealed compartment, Karonis said.
   ``They searched and searched and searched and finally found 3,359
pounds of cocaine,'' he said. ``That is a tremendous amount, one of
the biggest the Coast Guard has ever made, if not the biggest. We're
still trying to determine that.''
   The Colombian master of the Panama City-registered ship was
arrested, along with another Colombian, one Panamanian and seven
crew members from the Dominican Republic, Karonis said.
   Other large seizures of cocaine in recent years include about
7,300 pounds that were found in hollowed-out lumber at a Tampa Bay
area warehouse in the spring of 1988; 6,237 pounds seized on a
Venzuelan freighter and in a container that had been removed from
the vessel that docked in Port Everglades in October 1986; and more
than 5,000 pounds seized from banana crates at a Chicago produce
market in July 1987.

<HEAD>Moslems Asking Syria for Missiles, Tanks, to Counter Christian Armory</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MOHAMMED SALAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Moslem leaders said today they will ask
Syria for surface-to-surface missiles and tanks to counter new
missiles reportedly acquired from Iraq by their Christian foes.
   Syrian artillery shells continued to besiege the coast of the
Christian enclave north of Beirut today. Police said two people were
killed and seven wounded.
   The deaths raise the toll to 404 people killed and 1,558 wounded
since fighting erupted March 8 between the mainly Christian troops
of Gen. Michel Aoun's Lebanese army and Syrian-backed militiamen.
   Tension also heightened amid reports that 42 Christians were
kidnapped in Moslem sectors after Syrian-backed Moslem forces lifted
a land blockade of the Christian heartland two days ago.
   The An-Nahar newspaper reported the kidnappings, and Aoun's
command said the report was true. But police said they knew about no
abductions.
   Syria's barrage of Christian ports is to prevent Aoun from
receiving armaments, but Shiite Moslem leader Nabih Berri declared
today that the Christians on Thursday received a shipload of
Soviet-designed Frog-7 missiles and T-54 and T-55 tanks from Iraq.
Berri, leader of the mainstream Amal militia and Syria's closest
ally in Lebanon, was speaking in Damascus, after meeting with
Lebanese Druse warlord Walid Jumblatt.
   Aoun's command refused to comment on the report he has acquired
the missiles, which have a range of 43 miles and can carry warheads
containing 1,210 pounds of explosive.
   Berri charged the Christians will deploy the new armaments
against Moslem forces.
   ``They're not to threaten Syria or any other country,'' he said.
``They're to be used against the Lebanese and the parties of the
national coalition,'' an alliance of six Moslem parties.
   Syria this week charged Christian forces received six Frog-7
missiles in April and demanded they be removed because they could
hit Damascus if fired from Christian-held positions in mountains
northeast of Beirut. The mountains are 40 miles from Damascus.
   Berri claimed Christian missiles are ``aimed at my house, the
house of Walid Jumblatt and at the Syrian headquarters'' in Beirut.
   He said he has not officially asked Syria for the missiles and is
waiting for President Hafez Assad to return from his summer
residence ``in order to put this request to him.''
   ``The Syrians must help us. We are their allies. If they cannot,
or will not, then it is our right to seek to purchase such advanced
weapons from any source,'' Berri told reporters.
   A statement from his Amal militia published by Beirut newspapers
said acquisition of the missiles would ``lead to a destructive
catastrophe that will not spare areas in east or west Beirut.''

<HEAD>Warsaw Pact Asks NATO to Present Bush Arms Proposal Soon</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Warsaw Pact nations today asked NATO to
present President Bush's arms reduction initiatives at the East-West
disarmament talks.
   Officials said they hope details of the proposal will be
submitted before next week, when the current round of talks is to
end.
   ``We're pressing strongly that they present the framework of the
proposals by the end of this round on July 13,'' said Wlodzimierz
Konarski, Polish delegation chief at the talks on conventional armed
forces in Europe.
   In May, Bush won NATO support for a proposal to reduce U.S. and
Soviet troops in Europe to 275,000 on each side. That would require
the Soviets to withdraw and demobilize 325,000 Red Army soldiers.
   Bush also proposed limits on tanks, armored troop carriers and
artillery pieces. And he said the West is willing to expand its
proposal to include, for the first time, land-based combat aircraft
and helicopters from the Atlantic to the Soviet Ural mountains.
   Western experts at the Western alliance headquarters in Brussels
said last month they would formally present Bush's proposals to the
Warsaw Pact when talks open for their third round on Sept. 5.
   Konarski, speaking for the East bloc, was optimistic about
progress but mentioned some differences.
   ``We all now agree that a future agreement should cover six
categories of conventional armed forces even though a formal
proposal of our Western partners to this effect has not yet been
submitted,'' Konarski told reporters.
   He said if the main obstacles were overcome during the next round
``then the agreement could indeed be concluded within 12 months,''
the timetable suggested by Bush.
   NATO opened the Vienna talks on conventional arms reductions
March 9 proposing each military bloc reduce three kinds of weapons _
tanks, artillery and armored personnel carriers.
   The Soviet military bloc countered with a far broader, less
specific proposal to reduce six kinds of weapons 10 percent to 15
percent below present levels by 1994, then add a further 25 percent
reduction by 1997 before moving to only defensive forces in 2000.
   Reductions in aircraft are among points of disagreement. Western
delegates say aircraft are difficult to count and can be redeployed
in any disarmed zone within hours. Konarski made clear the issue is
of vital importance for the future of the talks. ``The issue of
aircraft remains to be solved as a matter of priority,'' he said.

   Gunmen believed to be communist rebels
killed a provincial police chief and a sergeant today, authorities
said.
   The Philippine Constabulary said Capt. Nick Enterina and Sgt.
Rogato Garido were shot to death as they were chatting in the street
near the police station in Iligan city, 500 miles southeast of
Manila.
   The assailants, believed to be members of the rebel New People's
Army, fled on foot, the report said.
   Ten policemen, soldiers and low-ranking officials have been slain
in Manila in the past two weeks in a series of attacks blamed on the
rebels.
   Also today, a general said he has ordered a closer guard on 31
soldiers held in the slaying of President Corazon Aquino's husband,
following reports that three had been seen at the airport.
   On June 24, a Manila tabloid newspaper, People's Tonight, said
the defendants went to the airport to smuggle textiles, automotive
parts and guns.
   Airport manager Eduardo Carrascoso and customs collector Zafiro
Respicio told a special anti-corruption court today their
subordinates reported the three soldiers had often been seen at the
airport.
   The soldiers are supposed to be kept under guard at Villamor Air
Base in Pasay City just outside Manila.
   The defendants are charged with killing Benigno Aquino on Aug.
21, 1983. He was shot while under military escort as he left a jet
that brought him back from three years of self-imposed exile in the
United States.
   The defendants' first trial ended in December 1985 with
acquittals. However, after Mrs. Aquino took power in February 1986,
the Supreme Court overturned the original verdict and ordered a new
trial.
   Brig. Gen. Rogelio Estacio, the Villamor commander, denied the
prisoners were allowed to leave their quarters, but he said controls
had been tightened.
   ``Before, we checked the roll at 7 o'clock in the evening,'' he
told reporters. ``Now, we do it every three hours.''
   The retrial began in April 1987. A total of 37 people are accused
of the murder, but six are free on bail or under house arrest.

   The European Court of Human Rights
ruled today that a West German accused of killing two people in
Virginia should not be extradited to the United States because he
could receive the death penalty.
   The court said the threat of the death penalty is a violation of
Jens Soering's human rights. Soering is being held in Britain.
   Rulings by the court do not technically bind the members of the
Council of Europe, but they are rarely ignored. Britain said it
would study the ruling.
   Court officials called the judgment a landmark ruling because the
court normally issues such decisions only after a human rights abuse
has occurred.
   Jim Updike, the Bedford County, Va., prosecutor heading the case
against Soering, said the decision was ``illogical.'' ``He is guilty
of the extremely brutal murder of two human beings,'' Updike told
The Associated Press.
   The court said if Soering is found guilty in Virginia, he faces
years on death row and capital punishment. Such punishment would
breach his rights under the European Human Rights Convention, it
said.
   Article 3 of the charter says: ``No one shall be subjected to
torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.''
   Sending 22-year-old Soering to Virginia ``would expose him to a
real risk of treatment going beyond the threshold set by Article
3,'' the court ruled.
   It said a promise by Virginia justice officials to ask the courts
to spare his life if he is found guilty was insufficient because it
``did not eliminate the risk of a death sentence.''
   Soering, who moved to the United States in 1977, was charged in
the March 30, 1985, killings of William and Nancy Haysom in their
Bedford County home. They were the parents of Elizabeth Haysom, his
girlfriend at the time.
   She is serving a 90-year sentence for her part in the killings.
   The parents of Soering's girlfried were stabbed to death in an
argument over Soering's relationship with their daughter, which the
parents opposed.
   Soering evaded arrest in Virginia but was arrested in Britain in
April 1986 on a check fraud charge. In 1988, Britain agreed to
extradite him, but Soering took his case to the human rights court,
an arm of the 23-nation Council of Europe.
   Britain is likely now to send Soering back to West Germany, which
requested his extradition in 1987 to let him stand trial there for
the Virginia murders.
   In London, a spokesman for the Home Office, which handles law
enforcement and immigration, said only that the ruling will be
studied.
   ``We will need to consider the judgment fully and carefully,'' he
said.
   One consideration for Britain is its interest in preserving the
1986 extradition treaty with the United States. Britain is currently
seeking extradition of an Irish Republican Army member convicted of
murder in Britain who later escaped from prison and was arrested in
the United States.
   The European Court of Human Rights did not say what Britain
should do with Soering. But Judge Rolf Ryssdal of Norway, the court
president who read the ruling, said trying Soering in West Germany
``would not involve suffering of such exceptional intensity or
duration.''
   West Germany abolished the death sentence in 1949. Under its
laws, nationals can be tried for crimes in another country. If
convicted in West Germany, Soering faces a maximum prison sentence
of 10 to 15 years.

   He spoke before ministers of the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations, ASEAN, who are meeting in this island capital southwest of
the Philippines. Talks began Thursday and end Saturday.
   The leaders are seeking a joint response to Vietnam's plans to
withdraw its 60,000 to 70,000 troops from Cambodia by Sept. 30. The
Khmer Rouge and two smaller non-communist groups are still fighting
the Vietnamese-backed government there.
   ``We are of one mind on what must happen after Vietnam's
withdrawal,'' Baker said in his speech. ``There is a critical need
for ASEAN and Western unity to ensure the emergence and survival of
a new, independent Cambodia. This new Cambodia must be free to
determine its own future, and it must not be dominated by the
murderous Khmer Rouge.''
   Baker said if such efforts failed, ``this lapse could well lead
to a new period of civil war.''
   The Khmer Rouge ruled Cambodia from 1975 to 1979, when it was
ousted by a Vietnamese invasion. During that time, it killed
hundreds of thousands of people.
   Baker, Western allies, and the regional association have been
forging a common stand before an international conference on
Cambodia to be held in Paris tentatively starting July 30. They are
urging a cease-fire, power-sharing, and an international body
supervised by the United Nations to oversee elections and the
transition to peace.
   Vietnam has opposed such a U.N. role.
   China has confirmed it will send its foreign minister to the
conference, France's Deputy Foreign Minister Edwige Avice announced.
China's role is crucial because it is the main source of arms for
the guerilla coalition.
   The ASEAN foreign ministers welcomed the news. ``This presence is
one of the conditions of the success of the conference,'' said Mrs.
Avice.
   Baker also said Vietnamese refugees are pouring into Asian
nations because of conditions in their homeland. ``We should keep up
pressure on it to reform its political and economic system,'' he
said.
   The secretary of state also tried today to reassure the Southeast
Asian leaders who fear the major powers will dominate a proposed
economic alliance for the region, officials said.
   Baker gave the assurances in separate talks with Foreign Minister
Siddhi Savetsila of Thailand and Foreign Minister Abu Hassan Omar of
Malaysia.
   The association comprises the non-communist, rapidly developing
nations of Brunei, Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, the Philippines
and Indonesia. The dialogue partners are the United States, Japan,
Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the 12-nation European Community.
   In the talks, the United States, Japan and Australia have been
seeking reactions to their separate proposals for a new forum on
economic cooperation for the Asia-Pacific region.
   Baker told Siddhi the United States does not intend to dominate
the economies of the smaller countries because the purpose of any
new group would be to stimulate the free flow of goods and
commodities, according to Foreign Ministry Spokesman Jetn
Sucharitkul of Thailand.
   Some group members, including Malaysia and Singapore, also say
they want to avoid sensitive political questions, such as whether
China or rival Taiwan should be invited to join.

<HEAD>White House Official Removed From HUD Role</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Top 6 grafs new to CORRECT Hale not removed from all HUD matters,
insert OMB spokeswoman comment; picks up at pvs 5th graf, Congressional
investigators</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A White House official has been told to stop
dealing with certain aspects of the Department of Housing and Urban
Development's budget because she is under congressional scrutiny for
projects she handled while working at the scandal-scarred agency.
   Janet Hale was informed of the move late Thursday by budget
director Richard Darman, not long after she was notified that she
would be asked to appear before a congressional subcommittee
investigating allegations of mismangement at HUD during the Reagan
administration.
   Ms. Hale works in the Office of Management and Budget and her
duties, until Thursday, included oversight of the entire HUD budget.
Before moving to the White House she worked for several years at
HUD, rising to deputy assistant secretary of housing.
   Darman's action came a day after HUD Secretary Jack Kemp
announced the suspension of a third agency program, providing
housing for low and moderate-income elderly people, as part of the
probe of corruption and mismanagement at the department.
   Barbara Clay, an OMB spokeswoman, said today that Ms. Hale was
told not to handle any HUD matters that relate to the investigation
but can continue to work on other agency activities.
   Congressional investigators are looking into at least two
projects Ms. Hale handled while at HUD, including approval of a
North Carolina project involving a longtime friend of former HUD
Secretary Samuel Pierce.
   ``For the time being, any matters specifically involving the HUD
investigation or the HUD actions under investigation should be
handled
   ... without your involvement,'' Darman said in a note to Ms. Hale.
   He noted that Ms. Hale herself had suggested the reassignment
after being summoned by the subcommittee. ``I have concluded that
this is the the best interest of OMB _ and I'm inclined to think
that for the periodf of the investigation it is also in your own
best interest,'' the OMB director said.
   The memo was first reported in today's editions of The Boston
Globe.
   Kemp's decision Thursday on the elderly-housing program follows a
highly critical audit of the program by HUD's inspector general that
said many of the projects were approved despite warnings by agency
analysts that they were unnecessary or too large.
   The program already has cost the government $119 million in
direct payments to cover defaults on HUD-insured mortgages, Kemp
said. The cost is likely to grow, he said, because defaults now
total $250 million and are expected to continue.
   Kemp also said the program was not serving those it was created
to help, citing a HUD-backed project in Palm Harbor, Fla., that he
said charged $2,100 a month rent for a two-bedroom apartment.
   He promised to revive the Retirement Service Center Program after
rewriting its guidelines to target resources to low-income elderly.
   ``Insured housing programs administered by HUD must by their
nature take risks,'' Kemp said. ``With this program costing $120
million to date, I would rather take these risks by targeting
resources ... to lower-income people.''
   Kemp is reviewing HUD programs as Congress and law enforcement
officials investigate allegations of widespread mismanagement during
the Reagan administration.
   Testimony and other evidence shows influential Republican
consultants were hired by developers to win favor for HUD projects.
   Also Thursday, an aide to the House subcommittee investigating
HUD and calling Ms. Hale to testify said several prior witnesses
will be recalled, including former HUD Secretary Pierce.
   Pierce earlier told the subcommittee he had no direct role in
funding decisions. But a former agency official, Shirley McVay
Wiseman, since has said Pierce ordered her to approve funding for a
North Carolina project involving a longtime Pierce associate.
   Also among those to be recalled are Thomas T. Demery, former
assistant secretary for housing; Lance Wilson, Pierce's former top
aide; and Republican political consultant Paul Manafort, who has
admitted ``influence-peddling'' to secure HUD funding for a New
Jersey project.
   The congressional investigation has focused largely on three
programs: HUD's acquisition and sale of single-family property, its
funding for rehabilitation of rental properties and its co-insuring
of mortgages for certain housing developments.
   A dozen private closing agents contracted for the single-family
program are under investigation for allegedly bilking the agency of
$20 million or more.
   Kemp has suspended the rehabilitation program and canceled
another program in which HUD backed loans for such projects as a
golf course-residential complex. Both involved lobbying by prominent
Republicans.
   The five-year-old elderly housing venture involved 150
developments. Kemp said he suspended it because 30 percent of the
projects whose mortgages were fully backed by HUD and another 12
percent of those in which HUD guaranteed 80 percent of the loan were
in default. The second default rate is expected to climb, officials
say.
   The program was designed to provide housing to people over age 70
who can live on their own and afford market rents. The centers offer
such services as central dining and recreation.
   An audit of 24 retirement centers in the Midwest found six were
in default or had their mortgages assigned to HUD, and six were
considered financially troubled.
   In most of those cases, HUD field offices approved the number of
apartments sought by developers although agency economists warned
the local housing market could not support the full project.
   In one case, HUD assumed mortgage payments for a Minnesota
facility that HUD economists had recommended be rejected. Only 76 of
the complex's 208 units were rented as of May 1988, 19 months after
it opened.
   The economist who recommended rejection had noted the development
would be in an isolated area overlooking a gravel pit, ``clearly
remote from major population centers.''
   The audit did not identify the project by name and HUD officials
at the field office that handled the case did not return telephone
calls Thursday.
   In another case, auditors said the Cincinnati HUD office agreed
to insure a 254-unit development despite an agency economist's
findings that the market would support just 125 units. In May 1988,
nearly three years after New England Village opened, only 67 of the
254 units were occupied and the mortgage was in default.
   The report listed four projects in Cincinnati with mortgages
totaling $35.2 million and two others in the Minneapolis-St. Paul
area totaling $17.9 million that were ``in default or considered
financially troubled.''

   The Secret Service searched the home of one of
its White House guards after he acknowledged he escorted a
Washington businessman and his associates on late-night tours of the
executive mansion.
   Secret Service spokesman Rich Adams today confirmed that the
service, which protects President Bush and other high-ranking
officials, searched the home of Reginald A. deGueldre Thursday
night. Adams declined to provide details of the search. DeGueldre is
a uniformed agent at the White House.
   ``There's been no arrest, so we can't release any information
involving our investigation until that time,'' Adams said.
   The Washington Times has reported that deGueldre led businessman
Craig J. Spence and his friends on at least one late-night White
House tour. The newspaper also has linked Spence to a police
investigation of a male prostitution ring operating in the city.
   The Washington Post, in today's editions, said five agents
searched deGueldre's Oakton, Va., home and took dozens of
photographs.
   In an interview with the newspaper, deGueldre said he had been
asked by his superiors and the U.S. attorney's office whether he had
received gifts from or did private security work for Spence.
   He said he told officials that he received no gratuities from
Spence and performed no favors other than arranging and conducting
late-night tours of the White House during the Reagan administration.
   ``Spence was just a friend of mine,'' he told the Post. ``I took
him and his friends on the tours. He never gave me anything. I never
worked for him.''
   The officer also confirmed that he was asked if he had any
knowledge of the prostitution ring. He declined to elaborate.
   An unidentified White House spokesman has said that private
late-night tours of the executive mansion are not unususal and do
not pose security risks.

<TEXT>
   The father of two former PTL aides
testified in their tax-evasion trial that they gave him and his wife
a Cadillac, jewelry and furs, and trips to Paris, New York and
Northern Ireland.
   David and James Taggart, friends of PTL founder Jim Bakker, are
charged with failing to pay $487,000 in income taxes from 1984 to
1987.
   Federal prosecutors say they diverted $1.1 million of ministry
funds to their personal use by taking cash advances on PTL credit
cards and using blank ministry checks to pay the credit card bills.
   Henry Taggart's testimony established that the claims of family
wealth recalled by his sons' co-workers at PTL were false.
   ``Let me put this to rest once and for all,'' Henry Taggart said.
``I do not and never did own seven Cadillac dealerships.
   ``I did not and never did own one Cadillac dealership. I worked
for a Cadillac dealer. That's it.''
   Today, an attorney hired by PTL to fight an effort by the
Internal Revenue Service to revoke the ministry's tax-exempt status
testified that he was unable to obtain documents on credit card cash
advances and American Express charges that dealt specifically with
David Taggart.
   Michael Wigton, a former IRS specialist in exempt organizations
who is now in private practice, was retained by PTL in late 1985 to
fight the IRS's proposed revocation of PTL's tax-exempt status. The
IRS action stemmed from an audit of PTL of the years 1981-1983.
   In other testimony Thursday, PTL tax attorney Robert Gunst
testified that David Taggart bought $100,000 worth of jewelry and
$400,000 in other purchases the same year he told the IRS his
taxable income was $107,000.
   ``Did the defendant ever tell you how he could purchase items
worth $500,000 when his income was $100,000?'' prosecutor David
Brown asked.
   ``It looks like a mistake was made,'' said Gunst, who prepared
Taggart's 1984 tax return.
   Other purchases questioned Thursday included a one-bedroom
apartment on the 57th floor of New York's Trump Tower, which Gunst
said the two brothers bought in 1986 for $640,000.
   Gunst also said that Bakker approved using ministry funds to pay
$52,000 in back taxes and penalties levied against David Taggart
following an audit of his 1981 and 1982 tax returns.
   Gunst said he found 25 to 30 boxes of credit card receipts during
an IRS audit of the ministry, and was worried that spending by the
Taggart brothers could threaten PTL's tax-exempt status.
   ``The receipts were there,'' Gunst said. ``The issue was whether
there was substantiation.''
   ``I told him the importance of keeping good records,'' Gunst
said. ``I don't know if he was the main problem. It looked to me
that he had provided the documents to support his travel.''
   Both Taggarts joined the ministry in the late 1970s as pianists.
Within a few years, David Taggart, 32, had become Bakker's top aide
and James Taggart, 35, was the ministry's interior designer. Both
were fired after Bakker resigned in 1987 amid a sex and money
scandal.
   If convicted, they each could face 25 years in prison and fines
of more than $1 million.
   In his testimony today, Wigton described one incident in which he
was unable to get his hands on American Express receipts. A set of
copies he requested from the credit card company was lost at PTL. A
second set of copies also was reported lost by PTL officials, he
said.
   ``They just disappeared,'' said Wigton.
   Most of the missing records had to do with travel expenses and
other charges incurred by David Taggart, he said. Without the
records, Wigton said, his effort to fight the proposed IRS action
was ``hampered significantly.''
   Under cross-examination by defense attorney Ben Cotten, Wigton
acknowledged that other records were also missing.

   Gene Gotti, brother of reputed Gambino mob boss
John Gotti, was sentenced today to 50 years in prison for running a
multimillion-dollar drug ring.
   U.S. District Judge John R. Bartels ignored defense lawyers'
appeals for mercy in handing down the maximum sentence.
   ``I have my obligations,'' he said.
   Codefendant John Carneglia was also given 50 years, and both
defendants were fined $75,000.
   Gotti, 42, and Carneglia, 44, were found guilty May 23 of being
at the center of a major heroin trafficking ring. Authorities
describe Gotti as a capo or captain in the Gambino crime family
reputedly headed by his brother and Carneglia as a soldier in the
organization.
   Defense lawyers said they were shocked at the severity of the
sentences, but said they were confident the convictions would be
overturned on appeal.
   Gotti and Carneglia stood silent and showed no emotion when
Bartels pronounced his sentence.
   Both have been in jail since June 29, a day after Bartels revoked
their bail, saying they continued to deal drugs after their
conviction.

   A steel mill is melting down old Soviet

Friday.
   ``It is good scrap metal, heavy and compact,'' said Verner
Riisager, an executive of Ovako Steel in Hofors, 120 miles north of
Stockholm.
   Ovako bought 2,000 tons of scrap metal from a company in
Leningrad, filling his junkyard with tank turrets, cannon barrels
and caterpillar treads, Riisager said.
   ``They had about 10,000 tons of scrapped tanks over there. I
guess the company and the fact that they could export was a result
of their perestroika,'' he said.
   Riisager was unable to say what model tank the company bought.

<HEAD>Baltic Republic Steps Beyond Kremlin in Decollectivizing Land</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The parliament of Soviet Lithuania passed a law
this week that goes a step beyond national legislation in giving
land back to farmers after decades of collectization, newspapers
reported Friday.
   The law stops short of total decollectivization, but would _
without charge _ give farmers the land they farm now with the right
to pass it on to heirs, according to Sovietskaya Litva, the
Lithuanian Communist Party daily.
   The law does not allow farmers to sell land, a step the Kremlin
might view as a violation of the communist ban on ownership of major
private property.
   Soviet farms have been owned by the state or by state-controlled
collectives since 1929-30.
   The bill could strengthen efforts by the Baltic republics of
Lithuania, Estonia and Lativa to become more autonomous. They were
occupied and annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940.
   It was not clear whether the national legislature, the Supreme
Soviet, would try to override the new Lithuanian law in the same way
it vetoed a law passed by the legislature of Estonia last fall
proclaiming autonomy in the republic.
   The Lithuanian law, which has not yet been published in full,
went beyond national legislation passed in April allowing farmers to
rent land on 50-year leases with a right to pass it on to
descendants.
   Farmers have been slow to take out leases, fearing the reforms
could be overturned, according to poll results published in April by
the Communist Party daily newspaper Pravda.
   The Lithuanian law, according to the newspaper Izvestia, said
``land, granted to the peasant for use with no fixed term, with
rights of inheritance and without payment, does not include the
right to sale.''
   Activists in the Lithuanian grassroots political group Sajudis
had been pushing for more radical legislation that would have
granted farmers the right to buy and sell land, but a compromise was
reached in the republic's legislature, said Zhilvenas Glebus,
reached by telephone in the Lithuanian capital of Vilnius.
   The Lithuanian law will go into effect Aug. 1, according to
Sajudis workers, quoting the Sovietskaya Litva article.

<TEXT>
   When the British middle classes want
to know how they're talking, dressing, loving and hating, they need
only head for the latest Alan Ayckbourn play.
   In three decades of playwriting, he has moved beyond his early
acclaim as a clever farceur to become the voice of an age and a
people.
   In the 1950s, British theater had its Angry Young Men, writing
electrifying portrayals of blue-collar British society.
   The 1980s have Ayckbourn, dissecting the underside of the
entrepreneurial society championed by Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher with his savagely witty depictions of the suburban nouveaux
riches and his ear for the way middle-class Britons speak.
   His work has been performed in over 35 countries, and he was most
recently seen in New York with the off-Broadway hit ``Woman in
Mind'' last year.
   He also writes children's plays, mini-musicals and revues. He was
Andrew Lloyd Webber's collaborator on the composer's one flop to
date, ``Jeeves,'' and has directed as well, notably Arthur Miller's
``A View From the Bridge.''
   With the June 13 opening of ``The Revengers' Comedies,'' the
50-year-old playwright has arrived _ presenting a two-part, 5{-hour
morality tale that is winning rave reviews.
   It's his 37th play, the same number William Shakespeare wrote.
But it is quality, not quantity, for which Britain's busiest
dramatist hopes to be remembered.
   ``I hope my plays hold up in 400 years. That's the real test,''
he said in an interview.
   The Independent in London found it ``killingly funny ...
masterly.'' The New York Times said ``Ayckbourn has outdone
himself'' and paid tribute to ``the most extraordinary career in
contemporary English playwriting.''
   The play, which won't reach London's West End until 1991, was
launched at the Stephen Joseph Theater in the Round in the north
Yorkshire seaside town of Scarborough, where it will run through
Sept. 23.
   Scarborough is entirely in character with a man whose plays are
rooted in a sense of place and who himself has little time for the
pretensions of London's social circuit.
   Ayckbourn became the theater's artistic director in 1971. ``I'm a
chronicler of small communities,'' he said. ``One sees events and
people and the rise and fall of individuals in a town such as this.''
   ``The Revengers' Comedies'' begins with a chance encounter by two
people intent on suicide and examines the consequences of a revenge
pact that leaves careers, houses, and people in ruins. As the plot
thickens, the tone darkens, subverting any notion of Ayckbourn as a
British Neil Simon.
   A similar mix of comedy and tragedy characterizes ``Henceforward
...,'' his current West End hit, about a composer writing a symphony
of love as the world around him slides into hatred, and ``A Small
Family Business,'' which takes comic aim at the English bourgeoisie.
   Both plays have U.S. productions on tap. ``Henceforward ...,''
which had a 1987 run at Houston's Alley Theater, will be staged in
Los Angeles next spring. ``A Small Family Business'' is headed for
New York in 1990.
   These works have led to a reassessment by critics who have tended
to see Ayckbourn as little more than a laugh machine.
   The reappraisal became noticeable after ``Woman in Mind,'' his
rending study of a housewife driven mad by her banal suburban
surroundings.
   But the hand of a social anatomist can be seen as far back as
1972 in ``Absurd Person Singular,'' in which the vanities and class
wars of three couples are traced over three Christmases.
   ``The Norman Conquests'' in 1973 showed his technical virtuosity,
presenting the same story in three intricately linked plays, each
time from the viewpoint of a different participant at a family
gathering. His 1982 ``Intimate Exchanges'' had several different
endings depending on the toss of a coin.
   Ayckbourn is celebrated for his craftsmanship _ ``I am interested
in technique; I just don't want it to show too much'' _ but says
content is paramount.
   ``I think I'm a moral dramatist,'' he said. ``Absurd Person
Singular'' was ``the first time I noticed it in myself ... the story
of the triumph of Mammon, a theme that's cropped up a lot since.''
   Although his characters never mention Mrs. Thatcher by name, they
are almost without exception steeped in her capitalist ethos.
   ``I'm alarmed and worried by some of the attitudes that have come
out of that philosophy, but I think it's wider than her; she bears
the title,'' he said.
   Less preachy than leftist colleagues David Hare, Howard Brenton
and Doug Lucie, Ayckbourn calls himself ``a woolly liberal in the
middle.''
   ``It's a little like doing anti-Tory plays at miners' galas:
There's no point,'' he said. ``I should be doing plays for
Conservative clubs, but in order to do so, you've got to get in
there with a slow-burning fuse.''
   ``I hope in the end one says the right thing, if you like: that

   This autumn will see the movie version of his 1984 play ``A
Chorus of Disapproval,'' directed by Michael Winner and starring
Jeremy Irons and Anthony Hopkins. It's Ayckbourn's debut as a
screenwriter, but he remains committed to the stage.
   ``In the end, film doesn't seem to add much to my work. It
replaces my narrative with a narrative of its own,'' he said.
``Things inevitably disappear.''
   ``The theater is where I get my buzz from. I just get excited

<TEXT>
   As President Bush looked on, former Navy vice
admiral Richard Truly was sworn in Friday as administrator of the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the first former
astronaut to hold the job.
   Vice President Dan Quayle administered the oath.
   It was the second oath Truly has taken for the job. He was sworn
in quietly a week earlier by Howard Robins Jr., another NASA
official, so that the agency would no longer be without an
administrator.
   Truly, recently upgraded from rear admiral, had to resign from
the Navy to comply with the requirement that NASA have a civilian
administrator. The resignation was effective June 30.
   Truly flew as pilot on the second space shuttle mission and as
commander on the eighth. He had been a naval aviator since 1960 and
had made more than 300 carrier landings. He had served as acting
administrator since James C. Fletcher resigned in March.

   The Communist Party newspaper reacted
angrily to remarks by West Germany's finance minister that Germany
should be reunified within its 1937 borders, which include about a
third of Poland.
   Finance Minister Theo Waigel said in Hanover on Sunday that the
German Reich in its borders of 1937 did not cease to exist with the
German army's 1945 capitulation to the Allies.
   Waigel said his party, the Christian Social Union, would never
allow the demand for reunification of the two Germanies to be
stricken from the West German Constitution.
   If the old German borders were recognized, Poland would lose some
of its largest cities, such as Wroclaw and Szczecin, and its biggest
industrial region in southeastern Silesia.
   ``Questioning at a revisionist rally the map of postwar Europe
and the irreversible character of the border on the Odra and Nysa
rivers, Minister Waigel, as a government representative, strikes at
our fundamental national and state rationale,'' said the editorial
in the Polish Communist Party's Trybuna Ludu on Thursday.
   ``Such a line .... is unacceptable for the Polish nation and for
all Poles regardless of their political orientation.''
   Although West Germany has been the most active Western country in
promoting relations with the communist countries of Central and East
Europe, Polish-West German relations have been strained by a host of
bilateral issues.
   West Germany wants better treatment for the German minority that
remained in the former German territories after World War II, and
there is resentment toward the flood of Polish emigrants or illegal
workers who have taken advantage of liberalized passport laws to
travel to West Germany.
   Poland has accused West Germany of insensitivity to its
sovereignty because of the calls by rightist politicians for old
German territories and because of West Germany's refusal to grant
economic assistance unless Poland makes concessions on the
minorities issue.
   In Bonn today, a leading Solidarity official urged Polish
reconciliation with West Germany but said his country should not
give up any land.
   ``Those who question existing borders damage perspectives for
stability in Europe,'' said Bronislaw Geremek, leader of
Solidarity's deputies in the Polish parliament.
   Geremek also said he sees ``new chances for (closer) relations
between Germans and Poles,'' and that problems holding up an
agreement in ongoing bilateral talks ``are only of the second
order.''

<TEXT>
   North Carolina's attorney general called
today for a federal investigation of price-fixing by major oil
companies, saying a state probe showed either greed or collusion is
behind recent price increases.
   ``Greed isn't illegal, but price fixing is, and that has been the
focus of our investigation here in North Carolina,'' Attorney
General Lacy Thornburg said.
   Thornburg said the oil companies have blamed the wreck of the
Exxon Valdez in Alaska and normal market forces such as increased
summer demand and higher crude oil prices for the rapid increase in
gasoline prices over the past four months.
   But Thornburg said Valdez spill ``was simply a small drop in a
very large bucket.'' He said crude oil prices have not affected
prices for other petroleum products, such as heating oil and diesel
fuel.
   ``The oil companies have put forward other excuses for the
simultaneous gas price increases, but their arguments have more
holes than the hull of the Exxon Valdez,'' Thornburg said.
   He said investigators tracked prices for three months from
retailers back through wholesale terminals and the major
out-of-state suppliers, finding that price increases took place at
the refinery level, while profits of wholesalers and retailers
remained stable.
   Thornburg said he had forwarded the state's investigation and a
formal request for a federal investigation to U.S. Attorney General
Richard Thornburgh in Washington.
   The North Carolina official said he also will ask his
counterparts in other states at a meeting this weekend to form a
task force to examine the price fixing allegations.
   ``I anticipate we will get a good response from the federal
government,'' Thornburg said. ``We can demonstrate with other states
a general outcry around the country, and when you have a widespread
public outcry, you usually can get a positive response.
   ``It is awfully difficult to prove price-fixing. It always has
been,'' Thornburg said. ``But we're certainly going to give it our
best shot.''

   An international customs organization wants
customs procedures around the globe automated through the use of
electronic data systems, U.S. Customs Service Commissioner William
von Raab said Friday.
   Von Raab said the 104-nation Customs Cooperation Council, at
meetings here this week, also adopted resolutions urging strict
enforcement of drug laws and encouraging member countries to sign a
U.N. convention on illicit drug trafficking.
   He told a news conference that ``the council has approved a
strategy through which customs administrations around the world can
work toward electronic data interchange.''
   ``When it comes, goods and services will move across
international borders mostly without paperwork, and with the
absolute minimum of human involvement. National laws and regulations
that interfere with free movement of goods and services will give
way to laws designed for modern trade and information concepts,''
von Raab said.
   He said that ``the bottom line will be less expensive
international trade. Trade will be less expensive for the business
community, which means lower prices for us all. Managing that trade
will be less expensive for customs administrations, which means
lower taxes for us all.''
   Tom Hayes, secretary-general of the Customs Cooperation Council,
which has its headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, told reporters the
group is concerned about a growing gap between industrialized and
developing countries with regard to their capabilities to automate
customs procedures. Technology, training and other assistance are
badly needed by Third World nations, Hayes said.
   On drugs, the international organization adopted a resolution
urging member nations to ``focus attention on the smugglers of small
quantities of illicit drugs as well as on the smugglers of large
quantities.''
   The customs council also approved a resolution calling for all
member countries to sign the U.N. Convention Against Illicit Traffic
in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances.

   The U.S. Embassy will send a
representative to Kabul to secure the release of an American
photojournalist arrested by the Afghan government, an official said
Friday.
   Arrangements were being made to obtain the release of Tony
O'Brien, a free-lance photographer on assignment for Time-Life Inc.,
said an embassy official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   ``Things are still on track,'' the official said. He said he
could not estimate how long it would take for arrangements to be
completed.
   The Kabul government said July 1 that O'Brien, of Santa Fe, N.M.,
would be released without trial if the State Department sent an
official to take him home. It said the decision was made in response
to an appeal from Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser
Arafat.
   O'Brien, 42, was arrested June 8 for entering Afghanistan without
legal documents and in the company of Moslem rebels fighting the
Soviet-backed government.
   He had been covering the Afghan civil war from Peshawar,
Pakistan, the base for many Moslem guerrilla groups.
   O'Brien has made several trips into Afghanistan with the
guerrillas. Under emergency laws in Afghanistan, he could have been
jailed for entering the country without legal documents, for which
there is no maximum sentence.
   The U.S. Embassy in Kabul was closed in January, before the
Soviet Union completed its troop withdrawal from Afghanistan.

   Vietnam announced its population has
grown to 64.4 million, and it called on all families to have no more
than two children.
   The official Vietnam News Agency said the population had grown by
11.7 million since the last census in 1979, representing a high
annual growth rate of 2.13 percent.
   An editorial in the Communist Party's newspaper, Nhan Dan, urged
all people to observe the national target of one or two children per
family, the agency said.
   Vietnam's already high and rapidly growing population has emerged
as a major problem for the country, which faces large-scale
unemployment, a poor social and economic infrastructure and
difficulties in feeding its current population.
   The most populous city in Vietnam is Ho Chi Minh City with 3.9
million people, according to the census, conducted April 1. Hanoi,
the capital, has 3.1 million.
   The census also showed there were 2,432 people _ 1,728 women and
704 men _ over the age of 100.

   A Cuban military court today condemned a
former army general and three other former officers to death by
firing squad for drug trafficking, the official Cuban news agency
Prensa Latina said.
   The tribunal handed out sentences ranging from 10 years to 30
years in prison to 10 other defendants, Prensa Latina said in
dispatches monitored in Mexico City.
   The news agency said all were convicted of collaborating with
Colombia's Medellin cartel, the world's biggest cocaine trafficking
outfit, in a scandal that reached into the highest ranks of the
military and the Interior Ministry.
   They were found guilty early Thursday by the special three-man
military tribunal, Prensa Latina said.
   All the defendants are former military officers who were stripped
of their ranks and thrown out of the Cuban Communist Party in June.
   The tribunal gave the death penalty to former Division Gen.
Arnaldo Ochoa, the alleged ringleader of the smuggling ring, and to
ex-Col. Antonio de la Guardia, ex-Capt. Jorge Martinez and ex-Maj.
Armado Padron.
   Ochoa, 57, fought alongside President Fidel Castro in the Sierra
Maestra in the 1950s and earned the prestigious Hero of the Republic
of Cuba medal for his command of troops in Ethiopia in 1978 and in
Angola in 1987-1988.
   He was head of a group of Cuban military advisers to Nicaragua's
leftist Sandinista government in 1985-1986.
   Martinez has been identified as Ochoa's right-hand man. De la
Guardia and Padron have been described as his chief collaborators.
   The tribunal sentenced Eduardo Diaz, Antonio Sanchez and Alexis
Lago to 30 years in prison. The prosecutor had asked for the death
penalty for them.
   Patricio de la Guardia, Rosa Maria Abierno and Miguel Ruiz also
were sentenced to 30 years in prison, five more than the prosecution
had requested.
   Maria Abierno was a captain and de la Guardia was a brigadier
general. The ranks of the other defendants were not known.
   Antonio Rodriguez was sentenced to 10 years in prison, the agency
said. The prosecution had requested a 15-year sentence for Rodriguez.
   Prensa Latina said three other defendants were given 25-year
sentences. In earlier dispatches, it had identified them as Leonel
Estevez, Jose Luis Pineda and Gabriel Prendes.
   During the court-martial, which began one week ago, the
defendants described a wide-ranging smuggling operation in which
Cuba was used as a transit point for tons of Colombian cocaine
headed for the United States and for shiploads of marijuana from
Jamaica.
   The defendants described money laundering in Panama, dealings in
contraband ivory, diamonds, sugar and rare wood, and black market
sales of supplies sent to Angola.
   Ochoa ``profited from the hunger of the Angolan people,'' the
prosecutor, Brig. Gen. Juan Escalona, said at one point in the
court-martial.
   The case received unusually wide publicity in the official Cuban
media. Cuban television broadcast excepts of the proceedings.
   The government has made it clear it intends to make an example of
Ochoa and his collaborators, who have been called traitors to Cuba
and to the moral standards of its revolution.

   Postal inspectors used wheelbarrows to
remove two tons of mail and a half-ton of postal equipment from the
yard of a letter carrier, officials said.
   The seizure occurred Thursday, after neighbors complained about
bags of paper and reams of bulk mail in the yard.
   Postal Service officials would not release the carrier's name,
but said he had worked for the Postal Service for 15 years.
Inspectors said they had no idea why the carrier had been stashing
the mail, but said he may face federal charges.
   Investigators worked for hours Thursday to remove the mail and
equipment from the yard. They took the mail to the bulk mail center
to determine what can still be delivered.

<TEXT>
   Buoyed by the promise of billions in
foreign aid, President Corazon Aquino leaves Saturday on a
three-nation West European tour in search of financial and political
support for her troubled country.
   Philippine officials say Mrs. Aquino will try to exploit her
image as savior of Filipino democracy to encourage greater trade and
investment to help cope with problems of poverty, communist
insurgency and a $28 billion foreign debt.
   She also hopes to dispel European fears that her government has
been laggard in fulfilling the pledge to protect human rights made
when she was swept to power in the 1986 uprising that toppled
Ferdinand Marcos' authoritarian administration.
   ``I would like to deliver to the people and countries of Europe
the message that the Philippines is committed to democracy, which
our people restored in a very unique way, by peaceful means,'' she
said in a radio broadcast this week.
   Mrs. Aquino will travel to West Germany, then to France to join
bicentennial celebration of the French Revolution, and finally to
Belgium.
   Mrs. Aquino's trip, her second to Europe as president, follows a
commitment Wednesday by industrial countries and international
financial institutions to provide $3.5 billion in 1989 in aid for
the Philippines. As part of the program, the European Economic
Community promised to triple its aid to about $350 million a year.
   The visit represents another step in Manila's efforts to expand
trade and contacts with Western Europe and broaden its foreign
policy, which traditionally focused on its former colonial power,
the United States.
   In February, the European Parliament expressed support for Mrs.
Aquino but added it was concerned about mounting human rights
violations.
   Human rights groups, including Amnesty International, accuse the
military and government-backed vigilante groups of widespread
torture, assassinations and illegal abductions of suspected rebels
on flimsy evidence.
   Officials say Mrs. Aquino will argue her government is committed
to human rights but faces a serious threat from the 23,000-member
communist New People's Army, which has been waging a 20-year war to
establish a Marxist state.
   Ten policemen and soldiers have been slain in the Manila area in
the last two weeks in attacks which the military blames on communist
rebels.
   Opposition Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile said Friday that Mrs. Aquino's
trip will reinforce the country's image as a borrower and a beggar.
He said Mrs. Aquino was leaving behind a nation in turmoil.
   On the eve of her departure, the government announced the arrest
of a soldier in the 1988 murder of a left-wing activist and the
attempted slaying of a companion in one of the country's best-known
human rights cases.
   The National Bureau of Investigation said Constable 2nd Class
Dioscoro Ambagay Jr., was arrested and warrants have been issued for
two more soldiers in the slaying of leftist Reynaldo Francisco and
an attempt on the life of Hilario Bustamante in March 1988.

   A man was arrested on charges of stealing

   The mineral deposits are prized in Asia as aphrodisiacs,

to sell them through an exporter.
   Paul A. Mueller, 42, was arrested Wednesday by state police and
charged with theft, receiving stolen property and criminal
conspiracy to receive stolen property. He was released on $10,000
bail, pending a July 14 court hearing.
   Police said the gallstones were stolen sometime from June 26 to
28. They weighed 2.2 pounds and are worth $600 per ounce, said
Kenneth H. Taylor Jr., president and secretary of Taylor Packing.
   ``The amount stolen was several months worth of stones,'' Taylor
said. ``They are in very few of the cattle. It takes thousands (of
cows) to make up the amount stolen.''

<TEXT>
   Killer whales have been sighted in the
Gulf of Mexico for the first time in 40 years, according to a marine
biologist who reviewed videotape shot by fishermen.
   ``We don't know how they got here, but they are a migratory
species,'' said Bob Shipp, a marine science professor at the
University of South Alabama in Mobile. ``It's possible they migrated
to the warm water in the winter and got trapped here when they
turned back to head north.''
   Shipp said Thursday that he had been skeptical about the sighting
of the whales, which have distinctive black and white coloring and
are commonly found in colder waters.
   But he changed his mind after watching the 10-minute tape that
included three minutes of what he called good footage of the whales
ranging in size from about 6 feet to 20 feet long. The film was shot
during a fishing tournament last weekend.
   Fifteen to 20 species of whale inhabit the gulf, with pilot and
beach whales the most common, Shipp said. There was an unconfirmed
sighting of killer whales last year near the Chandeleur Islands off
the Louisiana coast.
   ``It appears that they have taken up residency and are actually
surviving in the gulf,'' said Skip Grizzle, who was on the charter
boat when the video was made.

<DATELINE>WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United Nations has halted refugee
flights to the capital of Namibia because resettlement camps are
overflowing, a U.N. spokesman said Friday.
   The refugees, most of them supporters of the guerrilla movement
that fought for 23 years against South African rule, have stayed in
the camps around Windhoek longer than the seven days the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees had planned on.
   U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said the refugees are reluctant to
leave and go to their home villages in the north, where the
South-West African People's Organization has most of its support,
because they fear Namibian police will harass them.
   Refugees who have been flown into northern cities have moved out
of the temporary settlement camps and those flights will continue,
Eckhard said. The United Nations has arranged for representatives in
the camps near Windhoek to travel to the north, see the situation
and report back, with the hope that the refugees in the camps will
be persuaded to leave.
   The U.N. spokesman said 16,244 of the 41,000 Namibians registered
with the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees have returned so far,
mostly from SWAPO camps in Angola and Zambia.
   All refugees are to return by Sept. 15, the end of the
registration period for voting in elections planned for November.
   He said two planeloads of Namibians from Cuba were due to arrive
on July 18 and July 24, and that small groups have returned from
Britain and the United States.
   SWAPO said before the independence process began that it was
caring for some 80,000 refugees with U.N. aid, but there has been no
explanation for the change in numbers.
   About 150 refugees who returned this week had been held prisoner
by SWAPO in Angolan camps. In response to their tales of torture and
allegations that SWAPO is holding hundreds more prisoners, Martti
Ahtisaari, the U.N. special representative in Namibia, appealed
Friday for all prisoners on both sides to be freed under terms of
U.N. Resolution 435.
   South Africa has withdrawn all but 1,500 of its troops from the
territory it has ruled since 1915 and has agreed to grant Namibia
independence.
   But Louis Pienaar, the South African administrator of the
territory until it becomes independent, said Wednesday he will not
free about 30 SWAPO prisoners held by the police until a full
accounting is made of all prisoners who may still be in the hands of
the guerrilla movement.

   Drunken-driving roadblocks violate the
Rhode Island constitution even if they are operated under guidelines
the U.S. Supreme Court has implied are acceptable, the state Supreme
Court ruled Friday.
   The roadblocks are an invasion of privacy under the state
constitution's declaration of rights, which is stricter than the
federal Bill of Rights, the high court said in a 3-2 decision.
   Police officials said the ruling would have little practical
effect because few Rhode Island police departments use roadblocks.
But one police chief who favors them said the ruling could lead to
more injuries and deaths from drunken drivers.
   ``How about the innocent people's rights?'' said Central Falls
Police Chief Robert Choquette, who used the roadblocks until doubts
about their constitutionality arose last summer. ``I don't think
it's giving a fair shake to the innocent person walking down the
street.''
   Narragansett Police Capt. John O'Donnell said his department
abandoned the practice a couple of years ago because roadblocks were
not cost-effective, and Providence Police Capt. Frank Devine agreed
that his officers could catch more drunken drivers by patrolling
than by setting up a fixed roadblock.
   South Kingstown Police Chief Vincent Vespia Jr., president of the
Rhode Island Police Chiefs Association, said he does not use
roadblocks because he agrees with the court's reasoning.
   ``The concept of reasonable grounds to stop someone isn't there
when you set up roadblocks to stop everybody,'' he said.
   The ruling voided the conviction of Joao Pimental, who was found
guilty of refusing to submit to a chemical test after he was stopped
by Warren police during a roadblock Oct. 10, 1986.
   Although the U.S. Supreme Court has not ruled on drunken-driving
roadblocks, it did imply in a 1979 ruling that they would be
acceptable under certain limited conditions.
   The justices agreed that the Warren roadblock would probably pass
federal muster because police gave adequate notice, conducted it
with minimal interference to the public and had limited discretion
in deciding which cars to stop.
   However, Chief Justice Thomas F. Fay and two other justices said
the state constitution bars roadblocks no matter how carefully they
are operated.
   ``It is well beyond dispute that drunk drivers are a grave menace
to the public and that stronger measures are needed to cope with
this problem,'' Fay wrote. ``However, it would shock and offend the
framers of the Rhode Island constitution if we were to hold that the
guarantees against unreasonable and warrantless searches and
seizures should be subordinated to the interest of efficient law
enforcement.''
   Justice Donald F. Shea, in dissent, said the majority did not
have the ``justifiable and principled rationale'' it needed to
depart from previous U.S. Supreme Court rulings.
   ``The minimal intrusion on the driver's privacy rights is
reasonable and fully within the safeguards provided by ... the Rhode
Island constitution,'' Shea wrote.

<TEXT>
   Three F-16 fighter jet engines
worth about $2 million apiece have disappeared from Hill Air Force
Base, a spokeswoman said today.
   The missing engines are 17 feet long and weigh 3,500 pounds
apiece. They apparently were taken off the base sometime between
noon Saturday and noon Monday, said Maj. Portia McCracken.
   ``Nothing like this has ever happened in my memory. I would say
that it is very unusual,'' McCracken said.
   McCracken was unable to say whether the Air Force had any
suspects, and said investigators would have little to say about the
disappearances until they finish their probe.
   Utah FBI spokesman Tim Screen said he could not comment on the
investigation.
   The Air Force had said Thursday that at least one engine was
missing, and then confirmed this morning that three were missing.
   The missing engines are rebuilt Pratt &amp; Whitney F-100 TW200
series. McCracken said she was unsure whether the engines belonged
to Hill or if they had been sent from another base to be serviced.
   The Air Force's 388th Tactical Fighter Wing and the Utah Air
National Guard's 419th Tactical Fighter Wing, both based at Hill,
fly the F-16.
   Some of the engines housed at Hill are used for the fighters, and
others are shipped in from other bases for maintenance at the Ogden
Air Logistics Center.

   Zoo officials are hoping a blind date between
two mateless gorillas will blossom into romance _ and a baby gorilla.
   Hercules, 23, is on loan indefinitely from the National Zoo in
Washington to the Pittsburgh Zoo as part of the national Species
Survival Plan in the hopes that Zakula, 22, will find him attractive.
   Hercules never mated with any of the gorillas he lived with at
the Baltimore Zoo and National Zoo.
   Zakula lived for 19 years with Sultan, who died of a heart attack
in October. She had three miscarriages but no live births.
   Zakula didn't show signs of love at first sight when Hercules
arrived in Pittsburgh Thursday, but she wasn't acting angry either,
said Janice Frazier, one of the gorilla's keepers.
   ``Right now, she's mostly curious,'' she said. ``I'm sure she can
smell him. I'm sure she knows a gorilla is here.''
   Hercules will be quarantined for 30 days to give him time to
adjust to his new home and let zoo officials monitor his health.
   The two are lowland gorillas, an endangered species. Only five
lowland gorillas have been born in zoos, bringing the North American
population to 293.
   Melanie Bond, Hercules' keeper in Washington since 1981, said the
low birthrate in captivity reflects the animals' mating habits.
   ``They do not like everyone they date. They have to find the
right one,'' she said.

   Conservative fundraiser Carl R. `Spitz''
Channell was placed on two years' probation today for illegally
using a tax-exempt foundation to raise donations to help arm the
Nicaraguan Contras.
   Channell was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Stanley S. Harris
on his guilty plea to conspiracy to defraud the Treasury.
   Channell had admitted raising $2 million to help arm the Contras
from private donors who were told they could deduct from their
income taxes money given to the tax-exempt National Endowment for
the Preservation of Liberty. Weapons purchases are not a deductible
purpose of a tax-exempt foundation.
   Harris said it was ``very difficult'' to impose a sentence ``when
crimes have been committed by someone so firmly dedicated to
furthering the interests of the country.''
   The judge said that because of Channell's early cooperation with
Iran-Contra prosecutors he was placing him on probation.
   Michael Bromwich, an associate independent counsel, told Harris
that Channell ``has fully lived up to the terms of his cooperation
agreement.''
   ``Malice never entered my decisions, my heart or my mind because
I love this country,'' Channell told Harris.
   ``I suffer more because I have committed a crime against the
country which I love so much,'' said Channell.
   Channell's sentencing came a day after his former associate,
Richard R. Miller, was placed on two years' probation and ordered to
perform 120 hours of community service for his inolvement in the
fundraising effort.
   Harris did not explain why he did not order Channell to perform
any community service.
   Channell and Miller both cooperated with independent counsel
Lawrence E. Walsh's investigation of the Iran-Contra affair and
testified as prosecution witnesses at the trial of former White
House aide Oliver L. North.
   They both entered guilty pleas early in the investigation to
charges of conspiring to defraud the Treasury by using a tax-exempt
foundation to raise money for the non-deductible purpose of buying
weapons for the Contras.
   Miller admitted helping raise $3.2 million to help the rebels.
Both Miller and Channell could have been sentenced up to five years
in prison and fined up to $250,000.
   Channell and Miller said North was part of their conspiracy to
use the National Endowment for the Preservation of Liberty to raise
money for the Contras from such private donors as Texas billionaire
Nelson Bunker Hunt.
   At the time, U.S. military aid to the rebels was banned by
Congress.
   North was acquitted of the tax conspiracy charge by a jury that
convicted him of trying to cover up the Iran-Contra affair and of
illegally accepting a home security system from arms dealer Richard
V. Secord.
   On Wednesday, North was fined $150,000, placed on two years'
probation and ordered to perform 1,200 hours of community service.
   During Thursday's proceeding, Harris said Miller had suffered a
number of adversities as a result of his guilty plea. ``I need not
impose more for justice to be served,'' the judge said.
   Miller told Harris: ``I let my guard down. It may have been blind
patriotism, but that's no excuse.'' He said helping the Contras
``was a cause that meant everything to me and in that fervor I
turned a blind eye to the excesses of others and I crossed the line
myself.''
   Outside the courthouse, associate independent counsel David
Zornow said Miller ``came forward at a very early stage of the
investigation to admit his wrongdoing, pleaded guilty to a very
serious charge and agreed to cooperate with the government.''
   ``He lived up to his agreement with the government,'' Zornow
said. ``This closes the chapter on Mr. Miller.''

<HEAD>Thousands Commemorate Army Killings; Students Defy Troops</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RANGOON, Burma (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of students shouting slogans and
waving banners on Friday defied troops in the center of the capital
for the first time since the military crackdown in September 1988.
   Leading opposition figure Aung San Suu Kyi, addressing a crowd of
several thousand in the western part of the city, repeated her
denunciations of the ruling military for its refusal to negotiate, a
witness said.
   Rallies for Ms. Suu Kyi this week, including the largest since
September, were held despite martial law, which forbids gatherings
of more than five people.
   Diplomats have said the price of rice, which has doubled in the
past year, and shortages have prompted more calls for democratic
reform in the country the government has renamed Myanmar.
   Western diplomats said groups of up to several hundred students
chanted slogans from last year's national uprising and, bearing red
``fighting peacock'' flags, dodged armed troops.
   Up to a thousand students gathered outside the gates of Rangoon
University to try to lay a wreath but were forced to turn back by
armed troops, said one diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Authorities arrested six student demonstrators, said
government-run Radio Rangoon.
   Residents said many stayed indoors Friday for fear of violence,
and some shops in the city closed during the afternoon. But
witnesses said the military appeared to be keeping a low profile and
did not attempt to prevent political leaders from speaking.
   Ms. Suu Kyi, head of National League for Democracy, spoke during
a ceremony to remember the killings of students after the 1962
military coup and those who died during army crackdowns on
pro-democracy protests last year.
   Dozens of students were killed when the military put down a
demonstration at Rangoon University 26 years ago and blew up the
student union building.
   In September, several thousand were killed in a series of
crackdowns by troops.
   Socialist strongman Ne Win is held responsible for ordering the
killings in 1962 and 1988. He officially relinquished control a year
ago, but Ms. Suu Kyi repeatedly has said he is the power behind
nominal head of state Saw Maung.
   ``Gen. Saw Maung and U Ne Win have identical views in their
disregard for dialogue and civil authority,'' Ms. Suu Kyi told the
crowd Friday.
   On Wednesday, Saw Maung insisted Ne Win retired but added: ``We
are all here today because of him, he taught us like a parent.''
   Ms. Suu Kyi, has drawn big crowds which have defied martial law
to hear her speak in Rangoon in the past week.
   On Wednesday, more than 10,000 Burmese rallied to hear Ms. Suu
Kyi speak in what Rangoon-based diplomats said was the largest
political gathering since September. Diplomats said she addressed
more large crowds Thursday.
   ``We want dialogue, not confrontation,'' she told The Associated
Press Thursday. ``There is room for dialogue. It is a great pity
that he (Saw Maung) appears to have rejected the idea.''
   Outside the capital Friday, a bomb exploded at an oil refinery,
killing two people, Rangoon Radio reported. There was no immediate
claim of responsibility.

<HEAD>Bulgaria Decrees Conscription for Emergencies as Ethnic Turks Leave</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has issued a decree
empowering authorities to conscript civilians to work in
``emergencies'' threatening the economy, apparently to counter a
massive exodus of ethnic Turks.
   Authorities can send civilians to work anywhere in the country
under the decree.
   Western diplomats and journalists who have visited areas where
ethnic Turks lived say many towns and villages are nearly empty and
fields remain unharvested.
   Austrian TV showed footage this week from Bulgaria of fields
strewn with unharvested fruit and rotting vegetables.
   About 100,000 ethnic Turks have fled to Turkey in recent months,
claiming they have been victimized by an assimilation campaign begun
in 1984 which bans them from using their Turkish names, speaking
Turkish or practicing Islamic rites.
   Bulgaria's State Council issued the decree on June 30, but it was
not published until this week, Western diplomats said. Excerpts were
made available to The Associated Press on Friday.
   According to the decree, men aged 18 to 60 and women 18 to 55 can
be mobilized nationwide or on a regional basis. It did not say for
how long.
   People can be called up ``to ensure the necessary manpower and
equipment in emergencies or natural calamities presenting
considerable difficulties to the national economy and to the
country.''
   Invalids, pregnant women and mothers of children under 7 are
exempt.
   ``Those who evade civilian mobilization or without a plausible
reason fail to fulfill their assignments will be fined'' up to
$3,000, the decree said.
   Mobilized civilians will be paid according to undisclosed norms
established by the Council of Ministers, it said.
   Diplomats in Sofia said they have no information that any
mobilization has begun, and the decree does not say when it takes
effect.
   Ethnic Turks make up the main workforce in parts of eastern and
southern Bulgaria, especially in agricultural, tobacco and food
production.
   Turkish Premier Turgut Ozal said earlier this week that Bulgaria
is suffering labor shortages and economic hardships as a result of
the exodus.
   Mesut Yilmaz, Turkey's Foreign Minister, said last week the flow
would increase immensely if Bulgaria signs an immigration agreement
with Turkey.
   Turkish officials say as many as 300,000 ethnic Turks could
arrive from Bulgaria. About 1 million of Bulgaria's 9 million people
are ethnic Turks.

<HEAD>Iran Demands Compensation For Airbus Downed By U.S. Warship</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The director of Iran Air demanded the
United States pay compensation for a jet shot down a year ago by the
U.S. Navy, the official Islamic Republic News Agency reported Friday.
   Mohammad Reza Majidi also demanded that Washington compensate the
families of the 290 people who were killed when the A300 Airbus
plunged into the Persian Gulf on July 3, 1988, according to the news
agency, monitored in Cyprus.
   Majidi said Washington recently announced it was willing to pay
compensation directly to relatives of the victims, IRNA said.
   But ``this is not acceptable to us, and the U.S. must pay for the
downed plane in addition to the compensation,'' he said. He did not
cite a dollar amount.
   Iran has been seeking a World Court verdict against the United
States, and relatives of many victims are suing the designers and
manufacturers of the radar system of the USS Vincennes, the ship
that shot down the plane.
   One of those named in the suit is General Electric Corp.
   The U.S. Navy said the crew of the Vincennes mistook the jetliner
for a fighter jet coming in for an attack. The cruiser had been in
action against Iranian gunboats in the southern gulf earlier that
day.
   Shortly before it was hit by missiles from the Vincennes, the
jetliner had taken off from Bandar Abbas in Iran for a flight to
Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates. All 290 people on board were
killed.
   Also Friday, Tehran's mass-circulation Kayhan daily quoted Majidi
as saying Iran was making efforts through the foreign ministry, the
International Civil Aviation Organization and the International Air
Transport Association to make Iraq return an Iran Air plane hijacked
to Baghdad in 1984.
   Three Iranians, opposed to the Islamic government in Tehran,
commandeered the Boeing 707 and forced the crew to fly it to a
military base in southern Iraq, where they were offered political
asylum.
   The 71 hostages aboard the aircraft were released, but the
aircraft remained in Iraq.

   Security forces armed with emergency
laws arrested at least 49 suspected Sinhalese radicals as continuing
civil unrest claimed 25 lives, the government said Friday.
   Military and police, operating under new shoot-on-sight orders,
killed eight radicals in skirmishes when they made the arrests, the
information department said. Ten radicals were injured, it said.
   Extremists of the left-wing People's Liberation Front killed 12
civilians, three soldiers and a police officer since Wednesday, the
statement said.
   No further details were given to the press, working under strict
censorship laws clamped Thursday to coincide with a government
crackdown on the anti-government extremists. A nationwide emergency
was imposed June 20.
   The country's two main newspapers Friday warned that censoring
the news fuels rumors.
   Critical editorials in The Island and The Sun newspapers were
submitted to government censors. Sources at the dailies said the
editorials were approved without changes.
   ``Tongues wag in Sri Lanka ... censorship will be of no avail,''
said The Island. ``The danger of censorship is that all fantastic
rumors tend to gain more credibility.''
   The Sun said: ``What must necessarily be stressed is the futility
of the exercise, as censorship often in the past turned out to be
counterproductive. With the technical stoppage of news and views,
the flow of rumor, gossip and electronic tele-talk takes over with
no holds barred.''
   Police in Colombo, meanwhile, said leading human rights activist
and criminal lawyer Charita Lankapura was shot and killed Friday by
two unidentified men. No details were released.
   Sinhalese radicals launched a campaign to topple the government
two years ago to protest peace overtures being made to Tamil rebels
demanding an independent nation in the northeast.
   The Sinhalese front says too many concessions are being made to
the minority Tamils, who make up 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16
million people. Sinhalese make up 75 percent of the population.
   The front has been blamed for killing 3,500 people in two years,
mostly government officials, governing party members and security
force personnel.
   The government says the radicals instigated an ongoing strike by
public transport workers that has been crippling the economy for
four weeks.

   President Bush today asked Congress to give
some 7,200 federal executives pay increases of 8 percent to 25
percent, with even higher raises going to a selected 200 with
special skills.
   However, the president coupled his pay-raise plan with a proposal
that the officials justify their right to the higher salaries every
three years to be able to keep receiving them.
   Bush's proposal would give full 25 percent hikes to just the most
senior officials, matching a salary hike he has already advocated
for federal judges.
   More junior officials would get smaller increases, at least
initially, under the plan.
   The president also called for a phaseout of congressional
peechmaking honoraria over a two-year period and said it should be
linked to a pay raise for lawmakers. But he stopped short of
recommending a specific level.
   Presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush wanted
Congress to take the initiative on that politically touchy subject
itself, but that he was ready to work with congressional leaders on
a complete package.
   The plan would raise the pay of top federal officials, including
Cabinet members, to $124,400 from the present $99,500.
   It would also raise the salary of Vice President Dan Quayle from
$115,000 to $143,000. But it would not affect Bush's $200,000 salary.
   The total pay package would cost taxpayers $101 million in the
fiscal year that begins next Oct. 1; and $147 million in the
following fiscal year, Fitzwater said.
   He said the increases would be in addition to a 3.6 percent
cost-of-living increase the president is seeking for 2.2 million
federal workers.
   The package would, for the first time, set up a special super
category for federal employes with special talents, enabling them to
get salaries up to the $124,400 top level. Fitzwater said 200
individuals would qualify for these special salaries, to be
determined at a later time.
   He suggested that nuclear scientists, physicians or others with
special talents would be the type of individual considered for the
special salaries.
   The most controversial part of the new package, however, may be
the requirement that all members of the Senior Executive Service
undergo a re-certification process every three years to keep their
higher salaries.
   The procedure is designed to ``assure that these people perform
at a level that justifies the higher salary. We do not believe it
would weaken their rights,'' Fitzwater said.
   He said the certification would not apply to the government's 700
high-level political appointees _ like Cabinet members and others
appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate _ because
they ``can be removed at any time without appeal'' by the president.
   The 7,200 members of the Senior Executive Service and 700 appoint
executives currently make $68,700 to $80,700. Their pay is tied to
the $89,500 that members of Congress get, and lawmakers' rejection
of a proposed 51 percent congressional pay increase in February
meant no raise for them or for judges.
   A private commission headed by former Federal Reserve Board
Chairman Paul Volker has recommended a 25 percent increase
immediately followed by a similar amount in 1991, applying to
judges, executive branch officials, members of Congress and others
such as top military officers.

<HEAD>US to Forgive Debt to 16 African Countries</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush's decision to forgive some
African debt includes 16 nations and totals about $1 billion,
officials said Friday.
   Bush's announcement Thursday will ease the debt burden starting
Oct. 1 for Benin, Cameroon, Ghana, Guinea, Ivory Coast, Kenya,
Madagascar, Malawi, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Somalia,
Tanzania, Uganda and Zaire.
   One official estimated the face value of the loans at $590
million to $600 million. The rest would be interest already due or
expected to become due over the life of the loans.
   An additional $400 million will be forgiven to seven other
countries if they adopt new economic policies to put themselves into
better financial shape, in cooperation with the World Bank and the
International Monetary fund, the officials added. But they said some
of the seven, such as Ethiopia, are not likely to adopt such
programs.
   The others are: Zimbabwe, Sudan, Liberia, Botswana, Zambia and
Swaziland.
   The officials from the State Department and the Agency for
International Development spoke on condition that their names not be
used.
   Though Latin America has much heavier debt than Africa, the
burden on many African countries is considered heavier because their
populations are much poorer and smaller.
   The forgiveness was announced Thursday by President Bush at a
news conference for non-American reporters and stems from last
year's economic summit. The leaders of the seven major non-Communist
governments, including Bush, will meet in Paris next week for a
meeting.
   One State Department official said the other nations already have
forgiven most of such debt owed to them, and so have some other
creditors including the Nordic countries and the Netherlands.
   One AID official explained that many of the debts to the United
States go back as much as 30 years. More recently aid to the poorest
countries has been given in the form of grants, as it was when major
U.S. aid programs began in the 1940s.
   ``Some of the grants have been going to pay interest on the old
loans,'' the official added.
   Some debtor governments have not been paying for years, so that
forgiving their debts will not have much practical effect for them.
   The loans to be forgiven were made for development projects and
as economic aid to countries considered strategically important to
the United States. The officials said there would be no effect on
loans given by the government's Export-Import Bank to encourage the

   Tomatoes soon may become deadly enemies of
the caterpillars that love to gnaw on them.
   A gene from bacteria researchers say can't hurt other living
things will be inserted in tomato seeds, letting plants and fruit
that germinate from those seeds ward off caterpillar-type insects
without use of artificial pesticides.
   ``When the insect eats the plant, it ingests that bacterium and
dies,'' said David C. Hulst, director of Hulst Research Farm
Services, where a field trial on caterpillar-resistant tomatoes is
being conducted this summer.
   The bacterium, Bacillus thuringiensis, is fatal only to organisms
with a specific alkaline level in their systems, making it dangerous
only to the caterpillar family, Hulst said.
   Hulst said the bacterium is nature's way of controlling the
number of caterpillar-type insects.
   ``It's one of those antagonisms put in nature to reduce
populations of certain insects,'' Hulst said during a tour of the
test field. ``It is possible that without (this bacteria) in the
environment, the insects might eat everything around.''
   The U.S. Department of Agriculture agreed to the field test at
Monsanto Co. last month, but approval for general use is several
years away, said Roy Fuchs, a Monsanto researcher who directed the
lab work that prepared the way for field tests.
   Researchers predict widespread use of this biological control
because of growing concern about environmental effects from
pesticides that don't always keep insects at or below acceptable
levels, Fuchs said in a telephone interview from his office in St.
Louis. He cited Department of Agriculture statistics that farmers
spend $150 million annually on chemical insecticides, yet
caterpillar-type insects alone cause $450 million damage a year.
   ``There's a real need for alternatives,'' Fuchs added. ``That's
what will make or break the technology for farmers _ to see a real
benefit, and we're confident they will when they have a chance to
look at ... insect-tolerant plants.''
   A big advantage of the bacteria approach is ``that it has a very
long history of safe and effective use in agriculture,'' said Trevor
Suslow, spokesman for DNA Plant Technologies, a pesticide laboratory
that is not directly involved in the tomato research.
   However, he said one major concern is that widespread use of
bacterial pesticides will cause insects to develop resistance more
quickly.
   Field tests are being conducted at four locations by independent
contractors to give Monsanto and Environmental Protection Agency
researchers a broad geographic spectrum of the types of caterpillars
the new tomatoes will kill.
   Tests began in Illinois two years ago and have spread to Florida
and Mexico to see if they will halt tomato pinworms and to Hughson
100 miles southeast of San Francisco to determine the effect on
tomato fruit worms and beet armyworms. The protein also has been
tested on tobacco plants.
   Fuchs said taste tests will be conducted later, but he doesn't
think the protein will alter the flavor of the tomato.
   Monsanto, which hopes to begin licensing the results of its gene
research to seed companies by the mid-1990s, also is studying its
use to control cotton bollworms and is looking into its
possibilities with other vegetables.
   ``Any vegetables that have caterpillar insect problems could
benefit from this technology,'' Fuchs said.

<HEAD>Kadar's Burial Set For Day After Bush Ends Visit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former leader Janos Kadar will be buried
July 14, a day after President Bush ends his visit to Hungary, state
radio reported Friday.
   The funeral for Kadar, who died Thursday, comes less than one
month after an elaborate reburial ceremony for Imre Nagy, the leader
of the failed 1956 uprising who was executed on charges of high
treason under Kadar's leadership in 1958.
   Kadar will be interred at the Imre Mezoe cemetery in Budapest,
where senior communist leaders traditionally are buried. The radio
gave no other details.
   According to a medical report issued by MTI state news agency
Friday, Kadar died of respiratory and circulatory failure after
suffering increasing respiratory difficulties for 15 years.
   Only a few hours after Kadar died, the Hungarian Supreme Court
declared Nagy innocent of all the charges against him.
   Hundreds of thousands of Hungarians turned out for Nagy's funeral
June 16 _the 31st anniversary of his execution.
   It was seen as the end of Kadar's era _ a period marked by
relative prosperity in the 1970s, fostered by cautions economic
reforms Kadar endorsed, and ensuing stagnation as the reforms were
stalled and foreign debt mounted.
   Many people stopped on Budapest streets seemed relieved at his
passing.
   The Communist Party daily Nepszabadsag carried interviews Friday
with the four members of the ruling Communist Party presidium who in
a leadership reshuffle in May 1988 removed Kadar from the post he
had held for 32 years and embarked on wide-ranging political and
economic reforms.
   Karoly Grosz described Kadar as ``a man of extraordinary
decency,'' and said he continued to consult the former leader daily
for months after he took over from him as party general secretary
last year.
   Imre Pozsgay, the party's leading reformer, told the newspaper
that Kadar had done what he could under the circumstances, a clear
reference to the orthodox Kremlin leadership of Leonid Brezhnev.
   ``It was the constraint of the given circumstances that
unavoidably led to Kadar's weakness showing as he continued to serve
the cause of the nation,'' Pozsgay said.

   When it comes to aerobic exercise, most Americans
apparently say no sweat. Also no running, walking, swimming or other
strenuous activity, federal health officials have found.
   The Centers for Disease Control reported Friday that at least
five of 11 physical fitness goals for 1990, which it outlined at the
beginning of the decade, probably won't be met.
   ``Evidence indicates that regular physical activity reduces the
incidence of ... many medical conditions,'' the CDC said in its
weekly report, citing the benefits of exercise in fighting heart
disease, colon cancer, diabetes and obesity.
   Nonetheless, the agency concluded, ``objectives for participation
in regular physical activity will not be fully met.''
   Here are some of the the government's 1990 ``Objectives for the
Nation,'' published in 1980, and the progress _ or lack thereof _
that's been made:
   _The proportion of adults ages 18-65 participating three times a
week in vigorous, 20-minute exercise should exceed 60 percent.
Unlikely to be met; a 1984-87 survey shows that only about 8 percent
of adults exercise regularly at such a level.
   _Half of Americans 65 and older should walk, swim or engage in
other ``appropriate'' aerobic exercise at least three times a week.
Not likely; a 1985 survey showed that while 46 percent of older
Americans said they walked for exercise, only 8 percent met the
three-times-a-week, 20-minute level.
   _More than 90 percent of kids ages 10-17 should participate three
times a week in 20-minute sessions of vigorous exercise. Not likely;
a 1984 survey found only 66 percent of children exercised at that
level.
   _More than 60 percent of children 10-17 should participate in
daily school physical education programs. Not likely; a 1984 survey
placed the figure at 36 percent, only up by 3 percent from a 1974
survey.
   _More than 70 percent of U.S. adults ought to know that
cardiovascular health is best promoted by exercising at least three
times a week, for 20 minutes or more, and at a level that makes
heart rate and breathing ``a lot faster,'' but not so much that
talking is impossible. Not likely; a 1985 survey found that fewer
than 40 percent got those questions right.
   The only goal deemed likely to be met: having more than 25
percent of large companies offer some kind of fitness program. A
1985 survey found that 32 percent of work sites with 250-749
employees, and 54 percent of those with 750 or more, offered fitness
programs.
   One other goal may be achieved: having more than half of doctors
include exercise history in their initial examinations of new
patients. A 1981 check in two states, Massachusetts and Maryland,
found that 47 percent of doctors routinely asked about exercise.
   Other goals involved more technical matters of health services
and fitness evaluation techniques.
   ``There are a number of avenues of research attempting to get at
the answers ... why exercisers exercise and why non-exercisers
don't,'' said Dr. Gregory W. Heath, a CDC researcher. Among the
reasons being studied, he said, are ignorance of exercise's
benefits, poor access to exercise opportunities and attitudes
against exercise.
   Heath noted that exercise at lower levels of intensity, while not
matching the official fitness goals, can still bring fitness and
health benefits. The goals for the year 2000, now in the works, may
allow for people who prefer less vigorous exercise, he said.

<HEAD>German Wins Rights Court Ruling Against Extradition to USA</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTINA MACKENZIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   STRASBOURG, France _ In a landmark ruling Friday, the European
Court of Human Rights said a West German must not be extradited to
the United States because he could face execution if he is convicted
of a double murder.
   Jens Soering, 22, who is jailed in Britain, is wanted for the
stabbing deaths of a girlfriend's parents in Virginia in 1985. The
British government agreed last year to his extradition.
   But the court in Strasbourg said if Soering is sent to Virginia,
the prospect of execution violates his rights under the European
Human Rights Convention, whose charter bans ``inhuman or degrading
treatment or punishment.''
   ``The applicant's extradition to the United States would expose
him to a real risk'' of treatment banned under the European human
rights charter, the court ruled.
   The court said if Soering were sent instead to West Germany,
which also has asked for his extradition, he would not face the
death penalty and would not serve years on death row, which the
court said also violates the charter.
   Court officials said the ruling broke new ground because it
involved human rights abuses that had not yet occurred.
   ``Normally the court has the power to rule only on ... violations
of human rights,'' said Paul Mahoney, a lawyer at the court.
   Rulings by the rights court, a branch of the 23-nation Council of
Europe, are not binding on the 23 council nations but are rarely
ignored.
   Soering was arrested in Britain on a check fraud charge in April
1986 after evading arrest in the United States, where he is charged
in the March 30, 1985, slayings of William and Nancy Haysom in their
home in Bedford County, Va.
   Elizabeth Haysom, his girlfriend at the time, is serving a
90-year sentence for her part in the killings.
   The court did not address Soering's guilt in the deaths of the
parents, opposed Soering's relationship with their daughter.
   Mahoney said Soering has admitted to participating in the
killings but has given differing accounts of the circumstances.
   Sending Soering to West Germany ``would not involve suffering of
such exceptional intensity or duration,'' said Rolv Ryssdal of
Norway, the court's president.
   The ruling noted inmates spend between six and eight years on
Virginia's death row as their cases go through a lengthy review
process.
   West Germany abolished the death penalty in 1949. If convicted in
West Germany, Soering faces a maximum prison sentence of 10 to 15
years.
   Ryssdal said the court's ruling against extradition also took
into account Soering's state of mind and that he was 18 at the time
of the killings.
   Psychiatrists have said he ``had lost his personal identity in a
symbiotic relationship with his girlfriend _ a powerful, persuasive
and disturbed young woman.''
   The court ordered the British government to pay Soering's legal
costs of about $42,720. It dismissed minor claims by Soering,
including the allegation he did not get a fair hearing in British
courts that considered the U.S. extradition request.
   Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., who was in Strasbourg for Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's speech to the Council of Europe,
denounced the ruling as ``indefensible.''
   Jim Updike, the Bedford County, Va., prosecutor heading the case
against Soering, said the decision was ``illogical.'' ``He is guilty
of the extremely brutal murder of two human beings,'' Updike told
The Associated Press.
   The European Court of Human Rights is a body of Council of
Europe, the oldest organization striving for European unity. It was
founded in 1949 and is separate from the 12-nation European Economic
Community.

are coming home to Indiana for what a relative called a personal
trip.
   The Quayles plan to stay with Marilyn Quayle's stepmother, Elaine
Tucker of Trafalgar, and take their 10-year-old daughter Corinne to
camp, Tucker said.
   Indiana's former junior senator will arrive Sunday at Columbus
Municipal Airport and will travel by motorcade, said Bartholomew
County Sheriff Rick Hill.
   Tucker said she doesn't think the vice president has any speaking
engagements planned but said the family will probably visit Quayle's
grandmother, who lives in Franklin. Tucker said she has not seen the
family since the inauguration in January.

   Aviator Lisandro Garay-Mejia, once feted as the
``Honduran Lindbergh'' for his effort to fly from New York to his
native Honduras, has won U.S. citizenship for a second time.
   Garay wore his old Navy uniform and held a U.S. flag during
citizenship ceremonies Thursday in federal court.
   ``This is a wonderful present,'' said Garay, who turned 90 on
Wednesday.
   An early aviator in his country, Garay originally got his U.S.
citizenship in the 1920s to fly for the U.S. Navy. Through a ruse by
a politically hostile Honduran government in 1931, the United States
was misinformed that Garay was serving in the Honduran military at
the time, and his U.S. citizenship was withdrawn.
   He returned to the United States in 1985 after decades as a
banker and then a retiree in Honduras.
   Garay attempted more than 50 years ago to make the first flight
from New York to Honduras. He fell short, thanks to a hurricane, but
was feted as the ``Honduran Lindbergh'' anyway. He was honored on
his country's first air mail stamp.

   Rob Lowe, who is being sued in Atlanta by a
woman who claims the actor used her 16-year-old daughter in a sex
video, is now under fire from a street preacher who doesn't want
Lowe setting foot in his apartment co-op to film a new movie.
   John Medford, the preacher and church maintenance chief who lives
at the Glen Donald co-op just west of downtown, said his goal was to
make sure Lowe didn't corrupt the morals of the building's residents.
   Medford, 47, is trying to get the building's 70 residents to sign
a petition declaring they don't want Lowe on the property. So far,
he said he has collected 25 signatures.
   Lowe is accused in a lawsuit in federal court of videotaping a
sexual encounter between two women in his hotel suite while he
visited Atlanta last summer for the Democratic National Convention.
   In the new movie, ``Bad Influence,'' Lowe plays a character who
videotapes a couple in bed and a murder.
   Medford, who works at the Southern Baptist Church in Hollywood,
said he was offended by Lowe's alleged behavior, but he also objects
to the scenario of ``Bad Influence.''
   ``Lowe is influencing and ruining the youth,'' said Akos Szalas,
a 60-year-old retiree who signed Medford's petition.
   Not all residents agree.
   ``We've had Clint Eastwood here filming. His films weren't
biblical,'' said Elizabeth Wolder, 82.
   Erbun Flinchum, chairman of the committee that governs the
building, said a contract has been signed with Steve Tisch, the
movie's producer.
   ``The building needs the money,'' said Flinchum. ``We can't get
off into Rob Lowe's personal life. If he did something wrong, let
the courts decide.''
   Tisch isn't worried. ``The contract is binding,'' he said.
Besides, he added, Lowe has only one brief scene scheduled at the
apartment complex.

   Former Gen. Arnaldo Ochoa, who fought
alongside Fidel Castro and became one of Cuba's best-known war
heroes, was sentenced to death by firing squad Friday for helping
smuggle tons of cocaine into the United States, the official Cuban
news agency said.
   Three other former officers also were condemned by a
court-martial, which handed out prison sentences ranging from 10
years to 30 years to 10 other defendants, Prensa Latina said in
dispatches monitored in Mexico.
   Castro's regime launched an unprecedented and highly publicized
investigation into Ochoa aimed at erasing a stain on the nation and
the Communist Party.
   Ochoa's actions constituted an attack on ``the credibility of
President Fidel Castro and weakened the prestige and defense of the
Cuban revolution,'' prosecutor Brig. Gen. Juan Escalona said in his
summation Wednesday.
   For years, the United States had been accusing Cuba of allowing
drug traffickers to operate, an accusation Castro indignantly
dismissed as a U.S. plot to discredit Cuba.
   But, embarrassingly, the accusations turned out to be true. A
military hearing and the separate court-martial revealed details of
an operation that used Cuba as a way station for smuggling cocaine
from Colomba's Medellin cartel into southern Florida.
   The court-martial, made up of three senior generals, sentenced
Ochoa, ex-Col. Antonio de la Guardia Font, ex-Maj. Armado Padron and
ex-Capt. Jorge Martinez to death. All were stripped of their rank
and expelled from the party last week after the hearing before a
47-officer court of honor.
   The prosecutor had asked for the death penalty for three other
officers, Eduardo Diaz, Antonio Sanchez and Alexis Lago, but the
tribunal sentenced them to 30 years in prison.
   Prensa Latina, hailing the verdicts as a ``reflection of the
exercise of democracy and legality in Cuba,'' said appeals to Cuba's
supreme military court and the council of state were being
expedited. It said the defendants had admitted guilt but were asking
for mercy based on their records and contrition.
   The fall of Ochoa was most impressive because of his background
and standing. He fought alongside Castro in the Sierra Maestra in
the 1950s, battling and eventually defeating the forces of dictator
Fulgencio Batista.
   Ochoa earned the prestigious Hero of the Republic of Cuba medal
for his command of troops in Ethiopia in 1978 and in Angola in
1987-1988. He also headed Cuba's military advisory mission to
Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government in 1985-86.
   Prosecutor Escalona told the court that Ochoa robbed the
Nicaraguans ``of big sums of money,'' betrayed the Angolans with
black market deals, and planned ``to build a mansion with fine woods
from the Angolan jungles.''
   ``He profited from the hunger of the Angolan people with the
flour, salt and fish that hungry Angolan stomachs clamored for and
thousands of children died, simply because they lacked these
items,'' Escalona said in his summation.
   The smuggling ring apparently was centered in an Interior
Ministry unit headed by de la Guardia and dedicated to circumventing
the 1963 U.S. trade embargo on Cuba.
   In addition to drugs, the officers were convicted of smuggling
diamonds, ivory, sugar, manufactured goods and U.S. dollars.
   Confessions and testimony showed the ring worked with the
Medellin cartel for at least 2{ years and allowed tons of cocaine
from Colombia and shiploads of Jamaican marijuana to pass through
Cuban waters and airspace into the United States.
   Prensa Latina said $1.2 million and 423,000 pesos in cash were
seized along with 39 expensive automobiles, a motorcycle and 186
firearms. Ochoa also had a secret bank account in Panama, it said.
   Defense Minister Raul Castro, Fidel's brother, told the court
Ochoa had been ``spreading around gifts and handing out objects of
value, mainly to officers, ... in a delirious excercise of
self-indulgence, of the creation of an image and links of gratitude
to his person.''
   That seemed to imply that Ochoa was building his own power base,
perhaps to challenge or gain a measure of independence from the
Castro brothers.
   Rosa Maria Abierno, Miguel Ruiz and Patricio de la Guardia,
Antonio's twin brother, also were sentenced to 30 years in prison,
five more than the prosecution had requested, Prensa Latina said.
   Maria Abierno was a captain and de la Guardia was a brigadier
general. The ranks of the other defendants were not known.
   The prosecution had requested a 15-year sentence for Antonio
Rodriguez, but the tribunal reduced that to 10 years because there
was no evidence he took part in the drug smuggling, the agency said.
   Prensa Latina said three other defendants were given 25-year
sentences. In earlier dispatches, it had identified them as Leonel
Estevez, Jose Luis Pineda and Gabriel Prendes.
   Gen. Jose Abrantes Fernandez was sacked as Interior Minister for
failing to detect the smuggling ring in his department.
   The court-martial and military hearing included publicity about
the participants' own guilty feelings for betraying the revolution.
   Defendants were shown on Cuban TV with heads bowed as they were
denounced as traitors. Ochoa was shown saying he deserved to die.

   Syrian troops shelled the Christian coast
Friday, and the head of a Moslem militia said he wants missiles to
counter those reportedly acquired by Christian forces and ``aimed at
my house.''
   Also Friday, scattered clashes between rival Moslem militias left
two people dead and four wounded, police said.
   The shelling _ a daily effort to keep ships from supplying the
Christian enclave _ killed three people and wounded seven, police
said.
   The casualties from the shelling raised the overall toll to 405
people killed and 1,558 wounded since March 8, when the fighting
started between the Christian forces loyal to the government led by
Gen. Michel Aoun and Syrian troops backing a rival Moslem Cabinet.
   Nabih Berri, head of the Shiite Moslem Amal militia, said in the
Syrian capital, Damascus, that he wants to match a shipload of
Soviet-designed Frog-7 missiles as well as T-54 and T-55 tanks he
said the Christians received Thursday from Iraq.
   ``They're not to threaten Syria or any other country,'' he said.
``They're to be used against the Lebanese and the parties of the
national coalition,'' an alliance of six Moslem parties.
   His vow threatened to escalate the conflict that the Arab League
has been trying to halt. Amal had stayed out of the fighting over
the past 16 weeks.
   Christian sources reported in April that Iraq _ Syria's main Arab
foe _ delivered six Frog-7s to the Lebanese Forces, the Christians'
main militia.
   Syria, which maintains 40,000 troops in Lebanon, demanded that
the missiles shipped in April be removed because they can hit
Damascus, 40 miles from Christian positions in mountains northeast
of Beirut. Syria has linked the issue to lifting the naval blockade.
   Aoun has not confirmed that his 20,000 mainly Christian troops
possess Frog-7s and his aides have been vague in answering questions
about the missiles.
   Berri made his comments after meeting with Druse Moslem chieftain
Walid Jumblatt, who heads the Progressive Socialist party militia.
   Berri said he had told Syrian officials that the Christians'
missiles were ``aimed at my house, the house of Walid Jumblatt and
at the Syrian headquarters'' in Moslem west Beirut.
   ``The Syrians must help us. We are their allies. If they cannot,
or will not, then it is our right to seek to purchase such advanced
weapons from any source,'' Berri said.
   He said no official request has been made to the Syrians, but
that he was waiting for President Hafez Assad to return from his
summer residence in the coastal city of Latakia to make the request.
   Pro-Iranian militiamen of Hezbollah, or Party of God, and
fighters of the Syrian-backed Amal, the mainstream Shiite Moslem
militia, fought scattered gunbattles in south Beirut's seaside Ouzai
district Friday. Police reported two people killed and four wounded.
   Police said the fighting broke out after Amal militiamen tried to
sell their weekly magazine in Ouzai, a Hezbollah stronghold.
   Syrian soldiers ``are trying to separate the combatants,'' said a
police spokesman, who cannot be named in line with standing rules.
   The two groups, vying for dominance of the 1.2 million Shiites
who make up Lebanon's largest single sect, battled for two days in
Moslem west Beirut early this week. Three people were killed and 11
wounded, by police count.
   In another development, a source at Aoun's headquarters said
Syrian intelligence agents captured 32 Christian civilians and 10 of
Aoun's soldiers in Moslem sectors of Lebanon on Thursday. The
source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the soldiers were
released Friday.
   ``Efforts are under way to obtain the release of the civilians,''
he said.

   The Bush administration today slapped a
permanent import ban on 43 types of assault-style firearms whose
shipment into the country has been suspended since spring.
   Stephen E. Higgins, director of the Treasury Department's Bureau
of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, said the government had studied 50
styles of semiautomatic weapons imported in the country and had
decided to ban all but seven of them permanently.
   The bureau has been studying the use of the suspended weapons to
determine if they fit the requirement that they be used for sporting
purposes.
   The Gun Control Act of 1968 bans the importation of weapons that
are not used for legitimate sporting purposes.
   ``The study was undertaken because of the dramatic increase in
the number of these weapons being imported and police reports of
their use in violent crime,'' Higgins said.
   As a result of the study, 43 of the weapons were classified
officially as semiautomatic assault rifles and as such were barred
from further importation.
   Higgins said in April that the weapons under study were
``basically paramilitary in appearance, they are large-capacity
magazines.''
   Of the seven models exempted from the import ban, six are .22
rimfire caliber rifles and the other a gun called the Valmet Hunter,
which had been considered an AK-47 type of weapon during the
suspension. The seven models may be imported again, Higgins said.
   The ban will affect about 750,000 weapons that importers wanted
to bring into the country, he said. The suspension had covered new
import permits as well as those weapons for which permits already
had been granted and which were en route to this country.
   Higgins estimated that the Customs Service has seized about
20,000 of the weapons and that those will not be allowed into the
country unless purchased by law enforcement agencies. Asked at a
news conference whether the government will pay damages to
importers, he said, ``That's something the court would decide.''
   Three importers already have brought suit against the government
over the suspension. Although a federal court has upheld the
government in one of the cases, Higgins said ATF would accept
comments on the permanent ban from any importers for 30 days. The
final regulations would be issued ``very quickly'' after that, he
said.
   The bureau, which has the power to control imports, does not
regulate domestic manufacture of weapons, so similar weapons made in
the United States would not be affected by the action. Several bills
pending in Congress would control or eliminate many of the U.S.-made
assault-style weapons.
   ATF has estimated that domestic makes account for three-quarters
of the 3 million semiautomatic rifles now owned by Americans. Colt
Industries Inc suspended sales of its AR-15, the most popular of the
domestic assault-style semiautomatic rifles, in March.
   President Bush, a hunter and a lifetime member of the National
Rifle Association which opposes limits on weapons, came into office
opposing any bans on the assault-style weapons.
   A public outcry over the availability of the weapons was
triggered in January, when a man opened fire with an AK-47 and other
weapons on a schoolyard in Stockton, Calif., killing five children.
The man, Patrick Purdy, later killed himself.
   Semiautomatic versions of assault weapons such as the AK-47 and
the Uzi carbine have become popular with drug gangs, and their use
in illegal activities has skyrocketed in the past year, according to
law enforcement officials. The Uzi carbine has been imported since
the late 1970s.
   A study by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution found that an
assault-style gun is 20 times more likely to be used in crime than a
conventional firearm.
   Sarah Brady, chairwoman of Handgun Control Inc., today praised
the ATF's action, saying it ``confirms what was long known: that
these imported assault weapons do not serve a legitimate sporting
purpose.
   ``I commend President Bush for his leadership in working toward
reducing assault weapon violence by stopping the import of these
weapons of war,'' said Mrs. Brady, whose husband, former White House
press secretary Jim Brady, was severely wounded in the 1981
assassination attempt on President Reagan. ``... It is no more
acceptable to have citizens being gunned down by killing machines
wearing a ``Made in the USA'' label than by those made abroad.''
   The NRA declined to comment on the action until it was formally
announced, but John M. Snyder, spokesman for the Citizens Committee
for the Right to Keep and Bear Arms, denounced it in advance.
   ``I think that it shows that the undependability of government,
because originally, the ATF had certified that these rifles could be
imported because they are suitable for sporting purposes,'' Snyder
said. ``I think it also tends to further undermine whatever
credibility President Bush has left with the firearms-owning
community in the United States.''
   The NRA has opposed limits on the rights of law-abiding citizens
to own the weapons, saying the solution to any problem is to lock up
criminals. NRA members noted that Purdy had been convicted of
numerous offenses but spent relatively little time in custody and
was able to evade regulations in order to buy the guns he used in
his murderous attack on the school yard.
   The NRA has argued that the inner workings of the weapons in
question are identical to those of weapons that have been around for
decades, and that limits on them could adversely affect those who
own semiautomatic hunting rifles.
   The study to determine how the imported weapons were being used
began in March when Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, who oversees
the ATF, imposed a suspension on imports of five categories of the
weapons, including the semiautomatic version of the AK-47 and Uzi
carbines.
   Brady took the action at the urging of William J. Bennett, the
director of national drug control policy, who had been told by Bush
to determine what should be done about the weapons.
   Bush widened the suspension on imports a month later to include
two dozen additional styles of guns.
   At the same time, he called for a limit on magazine size to 15
shots. Legislation introduced by Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio,
called for a magazine limit of 20 shots.
   The weapons on the original suspension list come primarily from
China, Israel, West Germany and Belgium. Others are made in Austria,
Australia, Italy and Switzerland, among other countries.

<TEXT>
   A senior U.S. official joined Soviet
colleagues Friday to monitor the progress of U.S.-brokered peace
accords on Southern Africa, as doubts clouded the future of talks to
end Angola's civil war.
   Herman Cohen, assistant secretary of state for African affairs,
is expected to meet separately with Angolan officials to discuss
bilateral relations and a cease-fire agreed to June 22 by President
Jose Eduardo dos Santos and Angolan rebel leader Jonas Savimbi.
   Both dos Santos and Savimbi have denounced violations of the
truce that was to silence guns in this southern African nation on
June 24. Both indicate they want peace talks to go forward, but dos
Santos is believed to be having trouble selling the pact to Marxist
hard-liners in his government.
   A sign of U.S. support would strengthen dos Santos' position,
diplomats say.
   Cohen's deputy, Warren Clark, would only say on arrival Friday:
``It's inevitable we'll discuss bilateral relations with the
Angolans.''
   Dos Santos has donned the cloak of pragmatism, tempering Marxism
in return for Western aid to rebuild a war-shattered economy
bolstered by earnings of an Angolan-U.S. oil consortium and Soviet
aid.
   Washington and Pretoria have backed Savimbi's National Union for
the Total Independence of Angola since Portuguese colonizers
abandoned the country to the warring factions in 1975. Washington
has no diplomatic relations with Angola and currently gives the
guerrillas $15 million a year in military aid.
   In accords signed in New York on Dec. 22, Angola, Cuba and South
Africa agreed to the withdrawal of 50,000 Cuban troops from Angola
in return for South Africa's granting independence to Namibia and
halting aid to Savimbi.
   Washington and Moscow, which has backed Angola since 1975, are
observing a meeting of the commission monitoring the accords.
   Opening the commission's fourth two-day session Friday, Angolan
Foreign Minister Pedro Castro van Dunem said members can
``congratulate ourselves, particularly because of the political will
demonstrated by all parties who have really backed the possibility
of peace in our region.''
   Col. Arvid Geirulv, deputy commander of the U.N. Angolan
Verifying Mission, said 13,360 Cuban troops left Angola between Jan.
10 and Wednesday, keeping the withdrawal on schedule.
   Cuban troops remaining in Angola are to withdraw north of the
15th parallel by Aug. 1 and be out of the country by mid-1991.
   ``I believe the meeting will be calm and productive and that
we'll be able to find solutions to pending problems,'' said Neil van
Heerden, secretary-general of South Africa's Foreign Ministry.
   Cuban Deputy Foreign Minister Ricardo Alarcon de Quesada is
heading his country's delegation and Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister
Anatoli Adamishin was expected in Luanda later Friday.
   Observers say the commission's problems are manageable,
concerning isolated cross-border incidents and the return of
Namibian refugees from Angola and Zambia.
   Not so clearcut is the future of peace talks dos Santos broke off
last week in Zaire, saying they could not continue ``in a climate of
war.''
   Angola's official news agency reported Friday that Savimbi's
guerrillas killed six people in attacks on civilian vehicles in
southwestern Benguela province. It said this brought the toll to 20
people killed by the guerrillas since the cease-fire took effect.
   Dos Santos has described the June 22 summit of African leaders in
Gbadolite, Zaire, as ``hurried,'' and it now appears several people,
including Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda, jumped the gun in
reporting Savimbi had agreed to go into temporary exile _ an Angolan
government pre-condition for negotiations.
   Savimbi, who operates from bush headquarters in southeastern
Angola, says he has no intention of going into exile.

   Convicted heroin trafficker and reputed mobster
Gene Gotti was sentenced Friday to the maximum 50 years in prison by
a judge who condemned his long involvement in ``gangland-type
activities and lawlessness.''
   Gotti, younger brother of John Gotti, the man law enforcers call
the head of the Gambino crime family and one of the nation's most
powerful criminals, showed no reaction as U.S. District Judge John
R. Bartels sentenced him.
   Co-defendant John Carneglia also was sentenced to 50 years, and
both men were fined $75,000.
   They were convicted May 23 of running a multimillion-dollar
heroin ring.
   ``These are very serious crimes,'' said Bartels. ``The government
has proved these defendants are members of the Gambino crime family
and that their allegiance is placed above the laws of this country.''
   Defense lawyers said they were shocked by the severity of the
sentence, but confident the conviction would be overturned on appeal.
   Gotti and Carneglia will remain at the Metropolitan Correctional
Center at least until fall, pending the outcome of their appeals.
   Gotti, 42, of Valley Stream, and Carneglia, 44, of New York,
would likely spend 25 years in jail before becoming eligible for
parole, said U.S. Attorney Andrew J. Maloney.
   Authorities describe Gotti as a Gambino capo, or captain, and
Carneglia as a soldier in the family reputedly involved in
loansharking, extortion, labor rackets, gambling and drug dealing.
   Defense attorneys Gerald Shargel and Ronald Fischetti argued for
lighter sentences, saying their clients have wives and children and
have been convicted of no crimes since their arrest on the drug
charges in August 1983.
   Gotti and Carneglia have been jailed since June 29, the day after
Bartels revoked bail because he found they had continued to deal
drugs and associate with other mobsters after their conviction.
   At the bail hearing, an FBI agent testified that Gotti helped his
brother John plan the assassination of the former Gambino boss, Paul
Castellano, to escape a possible mob death sentence for dealing
heroin.
   John Gotti took command of the Gambino family after Castellano
and his bodyguard were shot Dec. 16, 1985, outside a restaurant,
law-enforcement officials say.
   Under Castellano's rules for his crime family, trafficking in
heroin was punishable by death, the agent testified.
   Gene Gotti and Carneglia had remained free on $1 million bail
each while the case made its way through the courts. The case
resulted in two mistrials and became one of the oldest cases on the
federal docket.

<TEXT>
   New York's program to inoculate prison
inmates against German measles involves a choice: be vaccinated or
isolated.
   Prison system spokesman James Flateau, who has characterized the
program as ``voluntary'' for the past several days, said Friday that
12 inmates at Downstate prison have refused vaccinations and have
been kept in isolation ``for about a week.'' He said the dozen
inmates would probably remain isolated several more days until
doctors are sure they aren't going to get measles.
   Flateau continued to describe the rubella inoculation program,
stemming from a German measles outbreak in New York City's Rikers
Island jail complex, as voluntary.
   ``It is voluntary,'' he said. ``There's a medical problem out
there and you've got to address the medical problem. One way of
addressing the medical problem is to receive the inoculation; the
other way of addressing it is for us to be sure, if you're not
inoculated, that you haven't been exposed.''
   Flateau said the resulting quarantines were ``for medical
purposes, not punitive.''
   The prison system spokesman said that about 20 guards have also
refused to be vaccinated. He said they are being ``counseled'' and
that if they continue to refuse vaccinations they will be required
to sign a waiver indicating they have been informed of the risk they
face. Having signed the waiver, they will be allowed to continue to
work ``because they really only present a danger to each other,''
said Flateau. The rest of the staff and all the inmates, except
those who accepted isolation, will have been vaccinated.
   Medical isolation, according to Flateau, means prisoners are
confined to quarters and can't participate in group activities.
Meals are brought to the prisoner.
   Flateau said that about 5,000 inmates and prison staff have thus
far been inoculated at five prisons that health officials think
might be at risk because they had accepted prisoners recently from
the Rikers Island complex. In all, about 7,000 doses of vaccine,
costing the state $16 per dose, have been sent to the prisons, said
Flateau.
   The state has refused to accept inmates from the two affected
sections of Rikers since June 29. He said the state will begin
taking prisoners again from those sections over the next few weeks.

   Frank Martin brushed aside the sight of
fancy cars and expensive shops and savored what he found most
precious in this affluent city.
   The retired coal miner took a deep breath. ``The air is so
clean.''
   ``If you stood in my town, after a while you'd look like you were
working in a coal mine,'' said Martin, from Lebanon, Va.
   ``The coal dust really flies,'' agreed his wife, Mavis.
   Martin, 54, has a keen appreciation for clean air. He suffers
from black lung disease, a debilitating ailment that forced him to
retire from the mines nine years ago.
   He was in Greenwich on Friday with his wife, his wife's sister
and his brother-in-law to picket one last day outside the corporate
headquarters of the strike-bound Pittston Co. before heading home.
   Martin's benefits have been wiped out and his brother-in-law is
out of work as a result of the strike by about 1,700 coal miners in
West Virginia and Virginia that began in April.
   As part of the United Mine Workers' strike strategy, the union
has been bringing up groups of a dozen or so miners and their
families to picket outside Pittson headquarters.
   Although violence has erupted elsewhere, the Greenwich picket
lines have been peaceful.
   Martin and his family were part of a group of 13 visiting
Connecticut. On the way north, they participated in rallies held by
labor unions in Baltimore and Newark, N.J.
   The group was divided in three teams upon arrival in Greenwich.
Martin and his family formed one team, and they worked three-hour
shifts on the picket line daily this past week.
   ``I would like to live here, if I could afford it. It's a clean
town, a nice town,'' said Martin's brother-in-law, Lloyd Blakenship,
from Rowe, Va. ``But I like my job. We like the family ties we have
down there.''
   ``We know everybody by name,'' added his wife, Marie.
   They said Lebanon and Rowe have about 10,000 residents each.
Greenwich, with 60,000 residents, is one of the nation's wealthiest
communities and home to many celebrities and top business executives
who commute to New York City.
   Mrs. Martin and Mrs. Blakenship said they were impressed by the
beautiful homes and the variety of shops, although the prices were
dismaying.
   The average sale price of a home in Greenwich last year was
$800,000, while Mrs. Martin said her home _ ``one of the nicest
homes in Lebanon'' _ is on the market for $135,000.
   Mrs. Blakenship said everyone in Greenwich drives a nice car,
while back home pickups and huge coal-hauling trucks predominate.
   Despite the differences, the four said they found Greenwich
residents to be friendly. They said motorists blew their horns and
gestured support.
   The foursome's only hostile words were for Pittston officials,
who've declined to meet with strikers. No new contract talks are
being held and replacement workers hve been trying to mine the coal.
   ``They think we're a bunch of dumb hillbillies, but we're not,''
said Mrs. Blakenship.

   Angry Israeli mourners demanded vengeance and a
harsh crackdown on the Palestinian uprising at funerals Friday for
those killed when a bus was forced into a ravine by an Arab
assailant.
   Police used tear gas to break up a crowd of stone-throwing
Israelis in Jerusalem protesting the attack that killed 14 people
Thursday. At another rally in the capital, officers on horseback
dispersed about 200 people chanting ``Kill the Arabs!'' A policeman
was slightly injured in one clash.
   A Palestinian from the Gaza Strip was seriously injured in an
apparent revenge attack when his car was stoned as he passed a
Jewish settlement in southern Israel. Hospital officials said he was
unconscious and suffering brain damage.
   Israel radio reported at least three other stoning attacks on
Arab cars across the country. Arab sources said three Palestinians
were hurt in the attacks.
   In Jerusalem, militants chased Finance Minister Shimon Peres from
a funeral by shaking their fists, banging on his car and screaming,
``Go home, maniac!'' Peres heads the left-leaning Labor Party, which
calls for giving up occupied land in exchange for peace.
   At another funeral, Cabinet Minister Avner Shaki of the National
Religious Party, vowed to seek ``new stubborn, non-routine and harsh
ways to end this filthy Arab terrorism.''
   An Israeli judge, meanwhile, ordered an Arab man from the
occupied Gaza Strip held an additional 15 days on suspicion of
staging the attack on a bus on the Tel Aviv-Jerusalem highway. He
was injured in the crash and arrested immediately afterward.
   Two of those killed were Canadian tourists _ the first foreign
victims of the uprising _ and at least 10 were Israelis. Eight of
the 27 injured were Americans.
   It was the worst attack on Israelis during the 18-month uprising,
which has claimed the lives of 546 Arabs and 33 Israelis.
   The Moslem fundamentalist group Islamic Jihad claimed
responsibility for the attack in a communique issued in Amman,
Jordan.
   ``One of our mujaheddin (freedom fighters) carried out an
operation and there will be other operations .... All aggressive
Jews should quickly leave the holy land or they will confront their
fate,'' it said.
   Police would not release the suspect's name or give details of
the investigation.
   A senior police official identified the suspect as a 28-year-old
man from a refugee camp in Gaza and referred to the incident as a
``terrorist suicide attack for nationalist reasons.''
   Police were investigating whether the suspect acted on his own or
on orders from a guerrilla group, officials said, adding that a
second suspect also had been questioned in the case.
   Jerusalem police spokesman Uzi Sandori said both the driver and
passengers told police the suspect grabbed the steering wheel of the
bus, shouting in Arabic: ``God is great.''
   Israeli newspapers said the Palestinian told investigators he
acted in revenge against beatings of relatives by Israeli soldiers.
   The reports also said the suspect carefully planned the attack,
riding on the bus route several times to choose the deadliest
location.
   Three of the bus victims were buried Friday. Shaki, a minister
without portfolio, spoke at the burial of lawyer Mordechai
Rosenberg, 50, in Holon, near Tel Aviv.
   He said outside the cemetery that he would press for a crackdown
on the uprising and added: ``It is not possible that they will kill
us and spill our blood almost every week.''
   The most tumultuous funeral was that of Miriam Tzarafi, a
40-year-old secretary and mother of three. Several dozen mourners
descended on Peres, who was swiftly ushered by secret service guards
back to his car before the funeral began.
   Many of the 200 mourners at the Mount Shaul cemetery wept loudly.
Relatives poured cold water on her 17-year-old daughter, Orit, to
keep her from fainting, Two men propped up her husband, Aziz, as a
rabbi recited the Jewish burial prayer, or Kaddish, which is Hebrew
for sanctification.
   ``Mommy, you loved me. I want to see my mommy,'' screamed Mrs.
Tzarafi's 5-year-old son, Orit, who was kept away from the funeral.
   ``It's hard to part from you Miriam. I wish they had taken me
instead,'' said her elderly father-in-law, Zion Tzarafi, a retired
postal worker.
   Several mourners said after the funeral they hoped the government
would take harsher measures against Arabs.
   ``We have to make sure that no Arab is allowed to travel freely
in our country without special passes,'' said a cousin, Shmuel
Turkiya, 55.

   Leftist guerrillas who kidnapped a
Norwegian anthropologist last year said Friday they will kill him
because he exploited Indians.
   The rebel communique, released to newspapers and radio stations
in the capital, said the decision to kill Bruce Olson was taken
after rebels talked with settlers, peasants and others living in the
Catatumbo area near the Venezuelan border.
   It did not say when he would be killed.
   Olsen, who has lived in Colombia for 29 years, had been working
with Indians in the Catatumbo area. He was kidnapped in October 1988
by the National Liberation Army, a group that has attacked foreign
companies, especially oil interests.
   The president of the National Organization of Indian Leaders,
Anatolio Quira, urged that Olson be released.
   Others appealing for Olson to be spared have been President
Virgilio Barco's adviser on Indian Affairs, Barco's chief adviser on
human rights and a priest who works with the Indians.
   Olson's mother gave a statement to the Bogota daily El Tiempo in
which she appealed to the guerrillas to release her son. El Tiempo
published the statement Friday. The letter indicated Mrs. Olson
lives somewhere in California.
   Olson carries a Norwegian passport. He also had U.S. citizenship,
but Olson renounced it last year, said a source with the Colombian
Foreign Ministry who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The National Liberation Army, headed by a former Catholic priest,
has bombed Colombia's biggest oil pipeline every month for more than
a year. The pipeline runs 500 miles thorough northeast Colombia.
   Anthropologists, linguists and missionaries working with
Colombian Indians have long encountered opposition to their work in
Colombia. In 1982, a guerrilla group known as M-19, kidnapped and
killed a missionary, Chester Bitterman III, of Lancaster, Pa.
   Bitterman, a linguist with the Institute of Summer Linguistics,
of Dallas, was accused by the guerrillas of being a CIA spy.
   Earlier this year a bomb went off in the institute's offices in
downtown Bogota.

   Carlos Menem becomes president
Saturday and plans to announce his economic program the next day, so
Argentines soon will know whether his image of action translates
into a bold assault.
   In addition to laying out his policies on hyperinflation,
recession and the soaring deficit, he has promised quick resolution
of a problem that plagued President Raul Alfonsin: army opposition
to trying officers accused of violating human rights during the
1976-83 military dictatorship.
   ``Menem is a chess player and he plays to win,'' said Manuel Mora
y Araujo, a sociologist and pollster. ``He prepares the ground and
then he advances.''
   Menem surprised many by choosing three Cabinet ministers from
outside his Peronist Party and pledging to sell state companies that
were nationalized or created in the 1940s and 1950s by the party's
founder, dictator Juan Peron.
   Adolfo Perez Esquivel, a human rights activist who won the 1980
Nobel Peace Prize, said he was impressed by Menem's attempt last
month to oust Saul Ubaldini as general-secretary of the General
Labor Confederation.
   The labor organization has been the backbone of the Peronist
Party for four decades and held 13 general strikes during the
five-year term of President Alfonsin, whom Menem replaces.
   Menem said publicly that Ubaldini wanted to leave the labor
federation and had been offered a diplomatic post abroad. Ubaldini
denied it and refused the job.
   ``He tried to get rid of Ubaldini; that's very interesting,''
Perez Esquivel said. ``He is trying to increase his room to maneuver
and part of that means getting rid of people who might be political
opponents.''
   The new president, elected May 14, faces economic problems that
are immediate and enormous.
   Inflation in June alone exceeded 100 percent, unemployment is
about 10 percent, the currency has lost 97 percent of its value
since February and the deficit has grown to an estimated 12 percent
of the $80 billion gross national product.
   Arrears of $4.5 billion in payments on the $60 billion foreign
debt make it impossible to obtain new loans. The central bank holds
about $1 billion worth of gold, but virtually no foreign currency.
   Real wages have shrunk by at least 40 percent since January.
   Shantytowns and malnutrition are spreading. Supermarkets in
Cordoba, Mendoza and Rosario cities were looted this week in a minor
replay of the food riots six weeks ago.
   ``We're starting from nothing,'' Menem said in an interview
published Sunday in El Cronista Comercial, a financial daily.
   ``We're going to do major surgery,'' he declared in reference to
the telephone, railway, oil and other state companies that lose
money and siphon off funds from the budget.
   Leaders of Brazil, Peru, Paraguay, Panama and Yugoslavia arrived
Friday for the ceremony. Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua and Julio M.
Sanguinetti of Uruguay were expected later.
   Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger arrived as a special
guest of Menem. The leader of the U.S. delegation, Commerce
Secretary Robert Mosbacher, arrived Thursday.
   Menem's economic plan centers on making state companies private
to attract foreign capital, voluntary price controls to curb
inflation, low-interest business loans to maintain production and
jobs, incentives for farm production and exports, and wage raises to
increase consumer demand.
   To reduce the deficit, Menem plans to cut subsidies, enforce tax
laws and raise utility rates. Unions oppose the sale of state
companies for fear of mass layoffs, businessmen oppose price
controls and wage increases, and workers are against higher utility
rates.
   With his conservative appointments and policies, Menem is turning
away from the Peronist Party rank and file who elected him.
   Mora y Araujo said: ``He wants to do something that hasn't been
done in Argentina since the 1930s: govern to the political right,
but with popular support.''
   Alfonsin, whose Radical Civic Union party lost the May 14
election, tried many of the same measures and was blocked.
   He also faced three rebellions by soldiers pressing the view that
trials of officers for human rights abuses during the dictatorship
must end. Menem is said to favor an amnesty, which would anger human
rights groups.
   A commission appointed by Alfonsin documented the cases of nearly
9,000 people who disappeared in 1976-83 and were presumed killed.
Estimates by human rights organizations range up to 30,000.

   A violent storm that swept through
southwestern France caused extensive damage to grapevines that
produce some of the world's finest wines, vintners said Friday.
   The storm, which hit Thursday night, also was blamed for two
deaths. Two men in a small plane were killed when they crashed while
trying to land in Pau, 480 miles southwest of Paris.
   The storm knocked down power lines, flooding factories, and
shredding corn and tomato crops as well as the precious grapes of
the Sauternes region.
   Many Sauternes were damaged, and some devastated. At Chateau
d'Yquem, which produces a prized sweet white desert wine, proprietor
Alexandre Lur Saluces said half his 1989 production was wiped out.
   Normally, Chateau d'Yquem produces about 75,000 bottles of wine
from its 250 acres of vines in production. A bottle of 1983 Chateau
d'Yquem, considered a top vintage by connoisseurs, sells for $150 to
$225 in Paris.
   ``More than 50 percent of the 1989 harvest has been wiped out,
and I have to say a part of the 1990 harvest seems to be in
question,'' said Lur Saluces, whose family has owned Chateau d'Yquem
since 1786.
   Some other vineyards in the area lost up to 100 percent of their
grapes for this year.

   Caribbean leaders wound up a week of
talks Friday on how to integrate their economies and prepare the
region for 1992, when trade barriers go down in Europe.
   Members of the 13-nation Caribbean Community and Common Market,
or Caricom, said they took the first steps toward creating a
Caribbean Stock Exchange, a Caribbean Court of Appeals and an
emergency fund for disaster relief.
   They also plan to ask the United Nations for an international
conference on drugs and emphasize the need for a U.N. task force to
combat drug trafficking in the Caribbean, a key transit route to
U.S. and European markets.
   A statement on Caricom's position on drugs was expected after the
five-day conference was scheduled to end Friday night.
   Jamaica Prime Minister Michael Manley has urged the group to take
action before 1992, when Western Europe is to form a single trading
market that could affect trade protection the region currently
enjoys on many of its exports.
   Among the key exports that could be adversely affected are sugar,
bananas, rice and rum.
   Jamaica, along with Trinidad and Tobago, have the largest
economies of the Caricom states and their leadership is seen as
crucial to the success of the group.
   The meeting also included heads of government from
Antigua-Barbuda, the Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Dominica, Grenada,
Guyana, Montserrat, St. Kitts-Nevis, St. Lucia and St. Vincent.
   Also on the agenda were economic and social problems confronting
the English-speaking region, including foreign debt, the environment
and regional politics.
   The group announced foreign ministers from the Bahamas, Jamaica,
St. Lucia and Trinidad and Tobago were to visit Haiti sometime this
year to pressure for elections.
   A statement said Caricom hoped the Haitian government led by Lt.
Gen. Prosper Avril would pursue democratic reform, including the
holding of national elections.

<HEAD>Brady Says Summit Unlikely to Change Economic Direction</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALLY JACOBSEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady said
Friday leaders of the major industrialized nations are unlikely to
shift economic direction at next week's summit in Paris.
   ``We should bear in mind the economies of the world are doing
very, very well,'' he told reporters in a satellite broadcast from
Washington.
   ``I don't think anybody's talking about changing the throttle
settings at this particular point in time,'' he said.
   President Bush and the leaders of Britain, Canada, France, Italy,
Japan and West Germany will make their annual examination of their
economies' health.
   Brady said officials probably will reiterate the statement issued
last spring by finance ministers saying an excessive rise or fall in
the value of the dollar would be counterproductive.
   He turned aside criticism that industrialized nations' spring
efforts to stem the sharp rise in the dollar against other major
currencies had been futile.
   ``I don't subscribe to the line of thought that says that either
policy coordination or intervention is a thing of the past,'' he
said.
   ``I would only point out that markets do have from time to time
volatile periods,'' he said. ``We had one this spring.''
   He noted the dollar's value had come down in recent weeks and
currency markets were quiet. ``I think the process is working very
well,'' he said.
   Central banks of leading industrialized nations mounted an
expensive campaign last spring to drive down the value of the
dollar. They intervened heavily in the currency markets by selling
dollars to try to change its value.
   Finance officials of the seven major industrial powers have
pledged to work together to keep the dollar stable.
   Brady said there was no need to make the nations' cooperation on
exchange rates more formal, as some European officials suggest.
   ``We don't see any reason to change things in any material way
and that would include a more rigid approach to exchange rates,'' he
said. ``We think the market is doing its job, and we would feel very
uneasy about tinkering with success.''
   He also said the Bush administration does not expect the U.S.
economy to slip into a recession but rather have a ``soft landing.''
   ``Our economy has been going forward on an upward plane for the
last seven years, so if that plane changes its slope a little bit
... then that is what we think is a soft landing _ growth at slower
rate,'' he said.
   There have been growing fears of recession in the United States.
   Analysts predicted the Federal Reserve likely will loosen its
credit policy further in an effort to drive down consumer and
business interest rates.
   The Federal Reserve in March 1988 began a credit-tightening drive
that lifted interest rates, a move designed to dampen inflationary
pressures by reducing demands for borrowing.
   But the central bank, in a major policy shift, last month lowered
a key interest rate, and analysts believe it shortly will reduce
that rate again.

<HEAD>Tass Reports New Ethnic Clashes in Nagorno-Karabakh</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Members of two ethnic groups fought gunbattles
Friday and tried to set buildings on fire in Nagorno-Karabakh, one
of the country's most volatile ethnic regions, the official Tass
news agency said.
   The news agency said Armenians and Azerbaijanis, who have been
feuding for 1{ years, shot at each other with hunting rifles in
Kirkijan, a suburb of Nagorno-Karabakh's principal city, Stepanakert.
   ``A real likelihood of massive clashes between the Armenian and
Azerbaijani populations was created,'' Tass said.
   The shooting lasted several hours and was accompanied by attempts
to set private and public buildings ablaze with signal rockets, Tass
said. The report said some people had fled the village and hid in a
forest.
   An Armenian and Azerbaijani were slightly wounded before police
and Interior Ministry forces ended the clash, Tass said.
   The dispatch also said hooligans were disrupting food supplies
and telephone and telegraph service and staging demonstrations and
sit-ins. Rumors are sweeping through Nagorno-Karabakh that attacks
on innocent residents are imminent, according to Tass.
   Since 1923, Nagorno-Karabakh has been part of the republic of
Azerbaijan, but Armenians, who make up three-quarters of the
region's 162,000 inhabitants, claim that Azerbaijanis discriminate
against them. They want the region to be annexed to the neighboring
republic of Armenia.
   The Kremlin has refused, and in January, authorities in Moscow
placed Nagorno-Karabakh under Kremlin management.
   Strikes and demonstrations flared in the region and in Armenia in
February 1988 and continued sporadically throughout the year. More
than 90 people were killed in the unrest.
   A general strike has been under way in the region since May 3,
and Tass reported Tuesday it has cost Nagorno-Karabakh $53.5 million
in wages.
   Tass said the latest disturbances appeared designed to disrupt a
visit to Nagorno-Karabakh by a commission of the national
parliament, the Congress of People's Deputies.
   The commission was formed last month to try to work out a
compromise between Armenians and Azerbaijanis. Armenians have
accused Soviet authorities of trying to increase the number of
Azerbaijans in the district.

<HEAD>Afghan Rebels Say Government Troops Halted After Garrison Loss</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Moslem guerrillas said they stalled a
government offensive Friday after losing a strategic garrison on the
outskirts of the eastern city of Jalalabad.
   The guerrillas blamed the loss of the Samarkhiel garrison
Thursday on a shortage of weapons and manpower.
   Abdul Kabir, a rebel spokesman, said Afghan government troops
plowed through guerrilla-held positions before being halted about
seven miles east of Jalalabad, in eastern Afghanistan.
   ``We couldn't hold on,'' said Azim Nasser-Zia, whose guerrillas
had held Samarkhiel. ``The mujahedeen didn't even have enough
weapons for their own defence.''
   Kabir agreed.
   ``We have a problem with this. We have only small weapons or ones
that are not in good working condition.''
   Nasser-Zia said the loss of Samarkhiel, which had been captured
by the U.S.-backed guerrillas early in March, was a crushing blow.
   ``The only victory since the Russian withdrawal, and we lose
it,'' he said.
   The Soviet army pulled the last of its troops from Afghanistan in
February, ending a nine-year military involvement in the civil war.
The guerrillas have been fighting 11 years to oust Afghanistan's
Marxist government.
   The insurgents, who call themselves mujahedeen, or Islamic holy
warriors, launched an attack on Jalalabad in early March. After a
month of some of the bloodiest fighting in 10 years of war, the
offensive ended in a stalemate.
   The battle for Jalalabad destroyed predictions that the Kabul
government would collapse soon after the Soviet troop withdrawal.
   Nasser-Zia also blamed the defeat on the interim guerrilla
government, saying it has drained many of the will to fight.
   The government was formed with the idea it would replace the
Afghanistan government, but it only has representatives from the
guerrilla parties based in Pakistan.
   It does not include representation for guerrillas based in Iran.

<HEAD>Pilgrimage Leader Says Iranians Can Skip Hajj for 10 Years</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The head of the Iranian organization that
arranges pilgrimages to Mecca and Medina said Friday that Iranians
can skip the ritual for 10 years to protest Saudi control of the
shrines, Iranian media reported.
   ``We aren't afraid if they don't let us into Mecca to make the
pilgrimage to the house of God for another 10 years,'' Mahdi Emam
Jamarani, head of the Hajj organization, the official Islamic
Republic News Agency reported.
   Jamarani, in a sermon in Zahedan, capital of southeastern
Sistan-Baluchestan, said Iranians had been refused entry into Saudi
Arabia for two years already for the annual pilgrimage or hajj.
   Traveling once to the holy shrines at Mecca and Medina is one of
the five basic duties of all Moslems.
   The Saudi Interior Ministry said Iranians were welcome as long as
they did not try to politicize the proceedings. Saudi Arabia severed
ties with Tehran last year, citing its support for subversion.
   More than 400 pilgrims, most Iranians, died in 1987 when Saudi
troops quelled a riot in Mecca.
   Last year, Saudi Arabia imposed a quota of 1,000 pilgrims per 1
million population for all countries. The usual Iranian contingent
of 150,000 would have been cut to a third that, and the Iranians
stayed away in protest.

   Two Canadian women were among 14 people killed
when a Palestinian grabbed the wheel and forced a bus to plunge down
a 200-foot ravine, police said Friday.
   They identified the victims as Shelley Halpenny, a dentist in her
mid-30s from Vancouver, British Columbia, and Fern Rykiss, 17, of
Winnipeg, Manitoba.
   Dr. Halpenny's sister, Eve Silberman, 36, also of Vancouver, was
being treated at Jerusalem's Sharai Zedek Hospital for minor
injuries and a concussion suffered in the crash.
   The sisters were accompanying their father, Manley Wolocho, 60,
who is competing on the Canadian shooting team in the 13th Maccabiah
Games beginning this week, game officials said.
   Ms. Rykiss' trip was her first opportunity to see at firsthand
the Jewish homeland she had learned about during 12 years of Hebrew
schooling in Canada.
   The two women are the first foreigners to die since Palestinians
began their uprising against Israeli rule in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip 19 months ago.
   Police also released the names of 10 Israelis killed in the
crash. They said they have not identified two bodies.
   One of the Israeli victims was Fadian Reznick, 25, who recently
emigrated from Argentina to Givat Haim kibbutz in northern Israel.
   U.S. Consulate officials said eight American passport holders
were among the injured but refused to release their names, citing
the Privacy Act. They said no Americans were believed killed in the
crash.
   Hospital officials gave names of some American patients but did
not have details. They are:
   _Rita Levine, 39, in serious condition.
   _Eliezra Ben-Yehuda Cassuto, 53, of New York, in moderate
condition.
   _Paul Fingersh, 25, with minor injuries.
   _Victor Assal, 24, an Israeli soldier who came to Israel last
year from Bethesda, Maryland.
   Fingersh's mother, Pella, was treated for light injuries and
released.

   George Bush, former baseball coach, took time
out Friday from preparing for his trip to communist Europe to talk
baseball with 4,000 Little Leaguers.
   ``In Little League all that matters is the size of your heart and
of your dreams,'' he said to the kids.
   They were gathered on the South Lawn, decked out in uniforms
identifying them as Indians, Mets, Springfield, Rocco's Rockettes,
and Parkland Blue Jays.
   The purpose was to mark the founding of Little League 50 years
ago in Williamsport, Pa. Adding luster to the ceremony were such
baseball greats as Stan Musial, Mike Schmidt, Brooks Robinson, Gary
Carter, Ted Sizemore, Joe Morgan and Jim Palmer.
   The president confessed his baseball hero was Lou Gehrig. And he
recalled that when Babe Ruth presented his papers to Yale, the Yalie
who accepted them was none other than George Bush.
   To the young players, Bush repeated a line that Babe Ruth
delivered to a crowd in Yankee Stadium when he was dying of cancer:
   ``You know, the only real game in the world, I think, is
baseball. You've got to start from way down when you are 6 or 7
years old and if you try hard enough you're bound to come out on
top.''
   With those words, said the president, Ruth ``defined why Little
League baseball has become an American, indeed, an international
institution.
   ``My four boys played it, I coached it, and Barbara _ not many
non baseball players could properly score a baseball games, but
Barbara did that, inning after inning,'' Bush said.
   ``Like you, I know what makes Little League so special. It's a
feeling of sportsmanship, generosity, teamwork, a feeling of family,
fathers and daughters, mothers and sons.''
   He said in the 50 years, 20 million youngsters had played Little
League _ more than 2.5 million in 33 nations this year alone.
   Bush told the crowd that when he is in Poland next week, he will
have the pleasure of helping import Little League. And he said he
will tell about Musial and Carl Yastrzemski, both baseball greats of
Polish extraction.
   ``In Little League all that matters is the size of your heart and
of your dreams and ask these kids about it,'' Bush said. ``Dreams
are the essence of America and of baseball and Little League can
propel those dreams.
   ``In the end what matters is how we conduct ourselves on as well
as off the field. That's where Little league really connects, by
building courage and character. It belts a grandslam home run by
doing those two things.''

<TEXT>
   A Solidarity official on Friday opposed
any suggestions Poland should give up land that was in German hands
before World War II.
   ``Those who question existing borders damage perspectives for
stability in Europe,'' said Bronislaw Geremek, leader of
Solidarity's deputies in the Polish parliament.
   He was responding to a suggestion by West German Finance Minister
Theodor Waigel that Germany should be reunified within its 1937
borders. That would include about a third of what is now Poland.
   Geremek spoke to reporters after talks with West German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher.
   The West German and Polish governments are trying to reach
agreement on a new financial aid package for Poland and on improved
conditions for Poland's ethnic German minority.
   The talks are stalled over conditions for financial assistance.
The impasse forced Kohl to call off a visit to Poland he had
tentatively planned this month.
   Geremek said he sees ``new chances for (closer) relations between
Germans and Poles,'' and that problems holding up the agreement
``are only of the second order.''
   Relations were cooled further by Waigel's comment on Sunday that
Germans still have a legal right to parts of Eastern Europe _
including large sections of Poland _ that once belonged to Germany.
   ``The German Empire did not cease with the capitulation of the
German army on May 8, 1945,'' Waigel said in Hanover.
   Poland's Communist Party reacted angrily to Waigel's remarks, and
his comments drew negative responses from Kohl and Genscher.
   Genscher said in a radio interview Friday that current frontier
agreements ``are accepted by everybody'' and ``leave no room for
discussion.''
   Kohl said on West German television Thursday night: ``No one in
Poland must fear that we Germans are revisionists.''
   In his talks with Geremek and other Solidarity leaders, Kohl said
he considers closer ties with Poland ``a special matter, in view of
the burden and tragedy of our common history,'' said the
chancellor's spokesman, Hans Klein.
   ``The chancellor said he considers the situation is ripe now for
a major step in creating friendly relations'' between the two
countries, Klein told reporters.
   Geremek said Solidarity agrees with the West German position that
any new financial credit for Poland must be linked to definite
projects, which was not the case with aid to Poland in the 1970s.
   He also said any new credit to Poland should be based on
successful economic reforms in his homeland.
   ``Poland does not want to be Europe's beggar,'' he said.
   ``We want to underscore that only a reformed economy is worthy of
asking for support. That would ensure not only that the credit would
be paid back'' but also that countries that invest in Poland can
make a profit, he said.

<HEAD>Oil-Eating Microorganisms May Munch on Alaskan Oil Spill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Officials of the Environmental Protection
Agency said Friday they are optimistic that oil-eating
microorganisms may soon become valuable tools in cleaning up the
Exxon oil spill in Alaska.
   EPA Administrator William Reilly said preliminary findings from
an experiment in which nutrients were used to enhance the growth of
such organisms on small sections of Alaska's contaminated beaches
appear to show success.
   In some cases, the number of organisms multiplied 100-fold only a
week into the experiment and even in the early stages some beaches
treated with nutrients showed ``a striking disappearance of the oil
from rock surfaces,'' the EPA said.
   Reilly said that the results were ``potentially good news'' and
that if the preliminary findings hold up Exxon Corp. may begin later
this summer to treat large sections of beach with nutrients to
enhance oil-eating microorganism growth.
   Eric Brathauer, assistant administrator for research and
development, said it will be several weeks before some remaining
questions about the experiment will be resolved.
   The EPA began using nutrients to enhance microrganism growth on
six test plots along Alaska's contaminated King Island beaches June
8 in hopes the growth would spur oil degredation. Some degredation
has been observed in untreated areas, but in many cases there are
too few microorganisms to make a significant impact.
   But Brathauer said the nutrients acted as a fertilizer and
brought about significant increases in levels of oil-eating
organisms in the test areas. He said so far there have been no signs
of any side effects detrimental to the environment.
   In addition to the rapid growth of the microorganisms in the test
areas, there has been a noticeable cleaning of rock surfaces that
had not been anticipated so early, said Richard Valentinetti, an EPA
official involved in the project.
   Rock surfaces on which the nutrients were applied became much
cleaner shortly after contact similar to soap releasing dirt from an
object. But the officials warned that the cleaning may have been a
physical reaction and not biological.
   Valentinetti said in an interview that the agency hopes to learn
more about the cleansing action within the next few weeks and
determine whether it was a biological reaction. He said it remains
uncertain whether the oil that came off the rocks actually degraded
or was simply transported.
   The EPA estimates that anywhere from 700 miles to 1,200 miles of
Alaskan coastline _ much of it shear rock and boulders _ have been
contaminated by the March 24 Exxon Valdez spill in Prince William
Sound.
   Valentinetti said use of the oil-eating microorganisms is
expected to be most productive along about 100 miles of shoreline

   He said Exxon has estimated it would cost about $5 million to
treat 50 miles of beach with the nutrient fertilizer to enhance
microorganism growth. Most areas likely would require more than one
treatment, officials suggested.
   That cost would be only a small portion of the overall cleanup
costs facing Exxon.

<HEAD>NATO Boss Says Tracking of Pilotless Mig-23 Shows System Works</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NATO's supreme commander in Europe, Gen. John
Galvin, said Friday that Western tracking of the pilotless MiG-23
that zoomed across West Europe undetected by Soviet radar proved the
allied alert system works.
   On another issue, Galvin reacted coolly to Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's offer in Strasbourg, France, Thursday to make
another unilateral cut in short-range nuclear missiles.
   ``The main thing threatening us is overwhelming (Soviet)
conventional forces,'' Galvin told a meeting of American reporters.
   ``I question whether or not we are in a safer world in Europe
today than we were, say, 10 years ago.''
   On the runaway plane, Galvin said two U.S. F-15 fighters
scrambled from a NATO base in The Netherlands ``as a policing
action'' as it crossed into West Europe Tuesday. They shadowed it,
hoping it would reach the North Sea, but it crashed in Belgium,
killing a man.
   Galvin said he accepted Moscow's explanation that it was an
accident.
   The pilot ejected over Poland after reporting the plane was
smoking. The Soviets say their radar missed the MiG-23 as it flew on
for 500 miles.
   The incident recalled the failure of Soviet air defenses to
detect a small plane flown by German amateur pilot Mathias Rust, who
landed in Red Square.
   ``Mathias Rust is one thing _ a little tiny plane flying at low
altitudes.'' said Galvin. ``But this plane took off from their own
airfield and was flying at high altitude.''
   A Soviet officer, Lt. Col. Anatoly S. Balikin, said in Moscow it
was not practical or economical to monitor every plane.
   Galvin said U.S. pilots did not shoot down the MiG-23 or move
alongside and tip it over because it was over populated areas.
   Regarding Gorbachev's offer, he said that although the Soviets
had 1,400 short-range missiles launchers compared with North
Atlantic Treaty Organization's 88, Moscow's conventional superiority
was a bigger threat.
   ``If we get into the shorter-range nuclear forces too early we're
giving away the major motivating idea because the Soviets do want to
see us get rid of nuclear weapons,'' said Galvin. ``They are not so
anxious to get rid of conventional weapons.''
   Last month Gorbachev told U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker
III he will withdraw 500 short-range missiles unilaterally. They
have a range of up to 310 miles.
   Galvin said that despite the appeal of glasnost, or openness, he
questioned whether Europe was safer because of the risk of Soviet
instability.
   ``I applaud the way the Soviet Union is moving,'' said Galvin.
``But it's a rocky road they're heading down. They're saying they
can't turn back but they don't know precisely where they're going.''

<HEAD>Vatican Doctrine Guardian Praises U.S. Court Decision</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Vatican's chief guardian of doctrine
Friday praised last week's U.S. Supreme Court ruling that allows
states to restrict abortion.
   ``The decision is a sign of the birth of a new moral
consciousness on abortion,'' Roman Catholic Cardinal Joseph
Ratzinger said at a news conference at Madrid University.
   ``It is a kind of move away from earlier attitudes, where I see a
reflection that weighs more on the side of the value of human
life,'' said the prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the
Faith, which makes sure that church officials adhere to Catholic
doctrine.
   Ratzinger made the comments after delivering a lecture titled
``Jesus Christ Today'' at a university seminar.
   In its decision issued on July 3, the U.S. Supreme Court voted
5-4 to give the states broad powers to restrict the availability of
abortions. The ruling narrowed the court's 1973 decision legalizing
abortion.
   On another topic, Ratzinger denied a recent Brazilian newspaper
report that the church had decided to order new sanctions against
the Rev. Leonard Boff of Brazil, a leading proponent of liberation
theology.
   In 1985, the Vatican sentenced Boff to nearly a year of
``obedient silence'' because of books he wrote that criticized the
Roman Catholic Church for not doing enough to aid the poor in the
Third World.
   Liberation theology stresses social activism by Catholics on
behalf of the oppressed. Pope John Paul II has objected to forms of
liberation theology that embrace Marxist theory.
   Ratzinger said the pope believes the theology to be ``useful and
necessary at times.'' ``But other aspects that present deviations
motivated by politics are not very correct,'' he said.
   Ratzinger also denied that the Vatican had been more severe with
liberal theologians than with ultra-conservative church figures such
as French Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre, who was excommunicated for
challenging the pope's authority.

   Reporters covering President Bush's trip to
Europe next week won't have to master strange telephone systems when
they call home.
   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. will set up 120 telephone
lines to allow reporters to speak directly with an AT&amp;T operator in
the United States.
   There will be 50 lines in the media filing center set up by the
White House at each stop on Bush's trip, with the remainder in

   Company spokesman Herb Linnen said reporters will need AT&amp;T
credit cards.
   The system, AT&amp;T said, will relieve the host countries of
augmenting their telephone systems to accommodate the 240 reporters
expected to accompany Bush on the July 9-18 trip to Poland, Hungary,
France and the Netherlands.
   AT&amp;T will utilize a temporary satellite link for the
direct-access service in Poland and Hungary. In France and the
Netherlands, AT&amp;T will plug into its existing system that gives
callers access to U.S. operators on a regular basis.

<HEAD>FAA Toughens Policy On Security Bulletins</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government announced a stricter policy
Friday to deal with threats against aviation, including a system
that requires airlines to take countermeasures and imposes fines for
disclosing security alerts.
   A Federal Aviation Administration order, which will go into
effect Monday, replaces the system of issuing security bulletins,
which was criticized after the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over
Scotland last December that killed 270 people. Notices of threats
against U.S. airlines on the flight's route were posted in at least
one foreign embassy but not distributed to the general public.
   Under the new order, individuals or airlines that disclose
information from government security alerts without FAA authorizaton
will be fined _ up to $1,000 for individuals and $10,000 for
airlines.
   FAA spokesman John Leyden said the system for alerting airlines
will now include two types of adivsories: information circulars and
security directives.
   The information circulars will deal with general threats of
hijackings, bombings or other terrorist actions, Leyden said. ``They
are basically a heads-up warning and would require no particular
action,'' he said.
   The security directives, however, would require countermeasures
by an airline, such as additional baggage inspections, Leyden said.
These would be in response to specific threats against an airline,
an airport or an individual flight and might include such
information as the threatened time and method of attack, he said.
   Previously, airlines were not required to take any specific
actions in response to security bulletins.
   The FAA, in a news release on the new order, said airlines have
been responsive to actions suggested in security bulletins but
making compliance mandatory will strengthen security.
   Since 1986, the FAA has issued 93 security bulletings, about
one-third of them warning of specific threats.
   In the case of Flight 103, an FAA advisory had been issued about
the threat of a bomb aboard a U.S. airline flight from Frankfurt,
Germany, to the United States. The Pan Am flight originated in
Frankfurt with a different plane, but U.S. and European authorities
said they concluded that the threat was not related to the bombing
of Flight 103.
   Other warnings were issued about the possibility of plastic
explosives concealed in a radio-cassette player. Investigators said
that such a bomb caused the Pan Am explosion, although they have not
found who planted the device.
   Relatives of Americans killed in the Pan Am bombing have called
for public advisories whenever there is a threat against aviation,
saying passengers have a right to know when they are boarding an
aircraft that has been threatened.
   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner has rejected the
suggestion, saying it would disrupt aviation and compromise
intelligence gathering.
   On Thursday, the FAA announced new rules requiring airlines to
install units that can detect plastic explosives in checked luggage
at 40 U.S. and foreign airports. It did not list the airports,
except for John F. Kennedy in New York and Gatwick in London, and
said it would take two or three years before all the units are
installed.

<DATELINE>SANTA CRUZ, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman will spend 45 days in jail for
serving food to the city's street people.
   Sandra Loranger, 49, of Santa Cruz who was charged with not
having a permit to provide the food, was given the jail term
Thursday by Municipal Court Judge Robert Atack.
   Loranger, standing outside the courtroom, promised to keep
feeding hungry people in Santa Cruz, a popular coastal city about 70
miles south of San Francisco.
   ``I fully intend to keep on doing it,'' said Loranger, who does
not have to begin her jail term until next week. She added she would
stop her activities ``only if unconditional food is made available
(to the poor) on a daily basis ... but not until.''
   She was sent to jail because she refused to accept probation,
under which she would be required to ``obey all laws.''
   Loranger, a partner in an antique store, is the first of the
activists working for the city's homeless population to receive a
jail term for handing out food.
   She was cited Feb. 21 during one of the meals the activists
served at the Town Clock in downtown Santa Cruz.
   The city began requiring the permits earlier this year because
too many homeless persons were gathering in a busy section of town
where the activists were serving them meals.

<TEXT>
   Guerrillas ambushed a police patrol and started
a gun battle in which seven rebels, six policemen and a civilian
were killed, the government said Friday.
   In Lima, guerrillas planted eight bombs at banks and private
companies, four of which exploded, police reported.
   An Interior Ministry statement said members of Shining Path, a
Maoist guerrilla group, ambushed the patrol Thursday in the Puno
region, 600 miles southeast of the capital near Lake Titicaca.
   The report said one policeman was wounded in the half-hour
battle, which ended when police reinforcements arrived. The civilian
killed had been hitching a ride on the police vehicle when it was
attacked, police said.
   Guerrillas of the pro-Cuban Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement
were responsible for the bombs in Lima, the police said.
   Four of bombs went off simultaneously at about 10:30 p.m.
Thursday at offices of the Peru Construction Council and the Grana y
Montero construction company, a tile factory and an auto parts
store. Bomb squads defused the others, which were planted near
downtown banks.
   Construction workers went on strike Monday for higher wages, and
their union held violent demostrations Wednesday and Thursday in
downtown Lima.
   Four members of the construction union were wounded and one was
killed Thursday in a confrontation with police after a march. A
policeman was wounded when a stick of dynamite was thrown from a
crowd of workers.
   Police did not comment on whether the explosions were related to
the strike.
   Shining Path began fighting nine years ago in the Andes and its
insurgency has spread to other areas. The Tupac Amaru group made its
appearance in 1984, and generally carries out bombings in cities.
   More than 15,000 people have been killed since the guerrilla war
began, according to government figures.

<HEAD>Wiesenthal Center Protests Map That Omits Israel</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Paris branch of the Simon Wiesenthal Center has
complained to Michelin about its map of northeast Africa that gives
Egypt and Jordan a common border and omits Israel.
   ``What we have here, at best, is discrimination in order to
satisfy the Arab market and at worst a position taken that would
seem to endorse the most extreme demands of those who would like to
eliminate Israel,'' said Shimon Samuels, European director of the
Wiesenthal Center.
   The Los Angeles-based center is an international organization
whose goal is combating prejudice..
   On June 14, Samuels sent a letter to Michelin President Francois
Michelin asking that the map be withdrawn and reprinted.
   ``At the very best we think this map is a blight on the
reputation for geograhical accuracy of Michelin guides and maps,''
he said in a telephone interview from London.
   The front cover of the map of ``Africa North East Arabia''
displays a small section of the full map. The cutout omits Israel
and shows instead a dotted line frontier running between Egypt and
Jordan, which occupied the West Bank from 1948 to 1967.
   The full map avoids the issue by placing in the area where Israel
would be located a small inserted map of the entire African
continent with the phone number for the Michelin company.
   A spokesman at Michelin's office here said the letter was
received two days ago by the department responsible for cartography,
which intended to respond.
   The spokesman, who spoke anonymously in keeping with company
policy, said the response ``will be private and not given in the
press.''
   He said the map of Arabia had been drafted and in print since
1967.
   Earlier this year, the Weisenthal Center's Paris office
complained to Air France after the national airline published a
Middle East tourist brochure with a map that omitted Israel. The
brochure listed hotels in the Middle East, but contained no listings
in Israeli cities.
   Samuels said his office was talking to the airline about
withdrawing or re-editing the brochure.

   The Bush administration is looking again for
someone to head the Health and Human Services Department agency that
handles the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
   Drew Altman, human services commissioner in New Jersey and the
second candidate who has been under serious consideration for
nomination to head the Health Care Financing Administration,
withdrew his name Friday.
   Altman, who is taking a job in the private sector, said his chief
reason for pulling out was the length of time it takes to move
through the personnel pipeline in Washington.
   However, sources in Washington and New Jersey who spoke on the
condition of anonymity said Altman's candidacy had run into trouble
at the White House over questions about his politics and an
unbudgeted $21 million spending spree by one of his New Jersey
division heads.
   Altman, 38, is a registered independent and did not participate
in the Republican president's New Jersey campaign last fall.
   In April, Sheila Burke, chief of staff to Senate Minority Leader
Bob Dole, R-Kan., withdrew from contention for the HHS job because
her husband is a vice president of the Aetna insurance group. Aetna
is one of several insurance companies under contract to the HHS
agency to handle Medicare claims. At the time, sources said an
arrangement could not be worked out to avoid potential conflicts of
interest.
   Altman's withdrawal appeared to mark the second time one of HHS
Secretary Louis Sullivan's candidates for a top job at the
department has withdrawn after running into opposition at the White
House.
   Earlier, Robert Fulton, Oklahoma social services secretary,
withdrew from consideration for nomination to head the department's
welfare agency in the face of criticism from right-to-life activists.

<HEAD>Citizen Panel Calling for New Police Hiring Policies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A community panel reviewing police activities
following January's riots has called for an overhaul of police
hiring practices and a permanent board to investigate citizen
complaints against officers.
   The Overtown Independent Review Panel also recommended Thursday
increasing the number of black officers in Miami from 18 percent to
21 percent and expanding the hours of a police substation in the
city's Overtown section, the center of the three-day riot that left
one dead.
   Blacks comprise about 21 percent of Dade County's 1.85 million
residents, the bulk of whom live in Miami. Hispanics make up 46
percent of the county's population and whites, 33 percent.
   City Manager Cesar Odio said he ``agreed with the general tone of
the report'' to be discussed by city commissioners next week. But
Police Chief Perry Anderson criticized most of the panel's
suggestions as unnecessary.
   He said internal police investigators do an adequate job
following up citizens' complaints and the 24-hour operation of the
substation is not needed even though the police shooting that
triggered the riots occurred across the street from the station when
it was closed.
   Three nights of looting and arson in Miami's black neighborhoods
were triggered by the fatal shooting of a black motorcyclist by a
Hispanic police officer Jan. 16.
   ``The whole incident was spontaneous,'' said Anderson. ``The
results would have been exactly the same if the mini-station was
open.''
   Anderson also defended the equality of the department's hiring
practices.
   ``What we need to do is generate enough black recruits to go
through the system,'' he said.
   The panel found that between 1974 and March 1989, 46 percent of
the black candidates failed to complete the five-month program at
the Southeast Florida Institute of Criminal Justice in Miami.
   The panel claims 37 percent of Hispanic candidates and 17 percent
of Anglos dropped from the program during the same period.
   Jim Stinchcomb, director of the institute, says the current
attrition rate is only 3 percent to 4 percent for all applicants and
the panel's figures may reflect some problems during the 1970s.
   Stinchcomb said dropout rates declined after the institute
revamped its firing range test and some academic exams in 1981.
   ``The numbers the panel is throwing out is no reflection on the
current situation,'' he said.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ A prominent politician said Friday
that gunmen fired on his home in an attack that came one day after
gunmen burglarized the home of another politician and killed his
brother.
   Jean-Claude Roy, head of the small centrist Union of Haitian
Constitutionalists party, said that at midnight Thursday three or
four gunmen began shooting at his house from his driveway in
suburban Freres, east of Port-au-Prince. He said he and his three
private security guards shot in the air and scared them away.
   On Thursday, Dr. Turneb Delpe, a critic of Haiti's military
government, said two gunmen burst into his Port-au-Prince home and
shot to death his younger brother Gregory.
   Delpe, head of the small leftist National Progressive Democratic
Party, said the gunmen stole $4,000.
   Haiti's ruler, Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril, has linked a foiled coup
attempt in April and a crime wave since then to die-hard supporters
of former dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier, who has been in exile in
France since 1986.
   Avril has said that Duvalier's supporters are trying to
destabilize his policy of ``irreversible transition to democracy.''
   ``Avril has claimed that he has things under control. His
enemies' clear message is that it just isn't so,'' Roy said.
   Serge Gilles, leader of the socialist National Progressive
Revolutionary Party, said: ``First Delpe, now Roy. These crimes are
not being committed for money. They are politically inspired.
   ``There is a group of people here who just does not want things
to change,'' Gilles said.

<HEAD>Pentagon Announces B-2 Flight Test For Next Week</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pentagon announced on Friday that the
long-awaited first flight tests for the B-2 stealth bomber will be
held during a 15-day period beginning Sunday.
   The controversial plane, which is the most radical and expensive
bomber ever built, has become the target of budget cutters on
Capitol Hill.
   Critics in Congress have expressed opposition to footing the bill
for planes that could cost anyhwere between $500 million and $750
million a copy before the first plane has ever gotten off the ground.
   The plane, described as resembling a ``flying wing'' without
conventional fuselage, is designed to penetrate Soviet borders
without being detected by radar.
   The plane has no sharp angles and relies on the use of
radar-absorbing coatings on its surface.
   In total, the program is expected to cost taxpayers some $70
billion. To date, the Air Force has invested $22 billion into the
program.
   In a statement issued late Friday afternoon, the Pentagon said
that the plane is scheduled for ``outdoor tests and the first
flight'' during a 15-day period beginning July 9.
   The plane has been undergoing a final check at an Air Force plant
in Palmdale, Calif. The plane has been built and manufactured by
Northrop Corp.
   During the 15-day period, the plane is expected to be rolled out
of its hangar and undergo a series of dress rehearsal tests that
include turning on its engines, slow and high-speed taxi tests on
the runway and then, a full flight test.
   For its initial flight, the Air Force plans to take the plane
from Palmdale for an approximately 2{ hour test flight, landing at
Edwards Air Force Base, about 40 miles away, said Capt. Tess Taft,
an Air Force spokeswoman at Palmdale.
   The tests may take several days, but there can be no exact date
given for the test flight, Capt. Taft said.
   ``Only after it looks perfect, and everything looks right, will
they take it up. And you never know what day that will be,'' she
said.
   While the news media will be allowed to observe the outdoor
tests, the public ``is not invited,'' the statement issue at the
Pentagon said.
   The specific date and time of the tests will not be announced in
advance, but the media will be informed by midmorning if no tests
are scheduled for a particular day, the statement said.
   The Air Force will hold a news conference following the first
flight, the statement said.
   While the B-2 has not been operationally tested in the field yet,
individual systems were tried out along the way. The Air Force says
the B-2 will not be deployed before 1991.

   The Democrats' national chairman on Friday
accused the Republicans of merely paying lip service to Hispanics
and pledged grass-roots efforts to give Spanish-speaking Americans
more political clout.
   ``We Democrats know that empowerment begins not with political
tokenism at the top, but with a commitment at the local level,''
Ronald H. Brown told the annual convention of the National League of
United Latin American Citizens.
   Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole spoke to the group later,
emphasizing a pending jobs bill rather than politics.
   Mrs. Dole said her No. 1 priority is to reduce minority youth
unemployment and she asked the group's support for a Bush
administration bill that would refocus the government's job-training
program.
   She said minority youth unemployment is a staggering 32.4
percent, while the jobless rate for young Hispanics averages 22
percent. The nation's overall unemployment rate is 5.3 percent.
   Mrs. Dole said Hispanic employment at the Transportation
Department rose by 25 percent while she was secretary during the
Reagan administration, and ``I intend to get the same results at the
Department of Labor.''
   Brown told the group earlier, ``You'll hear about President Bush
appointing Lauro Cavazos secretary of education,'' he said. ``You
won't hear about the cuts in Secretary Cavazos' budget or about
Republican support for `English only' education.''
   He said the Democrats are ``committed, absolutely committed to
bilingual education and committed to defeating `English only'
amendments no matter what state they appear in.''
   Brown also said Bush ``just said no'' when the
Democratic-controlled House requested $81 million in additional
funding this year for combating drugs. Brown took particular aim at
Bush's budget proposal for Head Start, saying ``more than three out
of four needy kids still won't get help.''
   ``Thousands of children in East L.A. are on the slow track before
they get to Mr. Escalante's classroom,'' he said, referring to Jaime
Escalante, the dynamic teacher who inspired the movie ``Stand and
Deliver'' and has become a hero of the administration.
   Brown addressed the scandal in the Department of Housing and
Urban Development as well, saying, ``When people in `colonias'
(shanty towns) go without running water and plumbing while (former
Interior Secretary) James Watt makes $300,000 for a few hours work
as a housing consultant, something is out of kilter.''
   In his speech and in remarks afterward, Brown repeatedly
criticized the Republicans as masters of a Madison Avenue approach
to politics, while he said the Democrats are still close to the
people.
   But he also acknowledged the GOP has made inroads with Hispanic
voters, especially in Florida and California.
   Addressing the fundamentals of building party strength, Brown
said after the speech, ``there is nothing more crucial than the 1990
census'' for the Democratic Party and its efforts to reach
minorities. Census data are used to draw congressional districts.
   Census officials say they could have missed as many as 3.5
million blacks and Hispanics in the 1980 census, while ``we think
it's about twice that amount,'' he said. He said the party will
``make sure the Census Bureau knows they are watched.''
   Brown also said the party needs to do more to register Hispanic
voters, and he acknowledged that Republicans have done a better job
of winning the allegiance of resident aliens in California by
courting them in the years before they become citizens.
   About 60 percent of eligible Hispanics have not registered to
vote, he said. The Census Bureau estimated the Hispanic population
at 17.5 million in 1985.
   Mrs. Dole, talking about jobs for minorities, said she and Bush
crafted legislation that redirects the Job Training Partnership Act
from merely a ``training for a job'' program to one that will
provide skills training, literacy and remedial education and
counseling.
   ``Each individual in the program will be assessed for his or her
particular needs, and goals will be set to meet those needs _ in
short, a total support system will be available. Funding will depend
not on how many kids are trained and pushed into jobs slots _ but on
achievement and longer term evaluation. There will be follow-up
after six months on the job, and a year later, to determine
progress.''
   Mrs. Dole urged members of the group, billed as the largest and
oldest Hispanic organization in the United States, to attend a
Senate subcommittee markup of the bill next Wednesday.

   Veterans officials were unable to prove they
had checked the licenses of more than half the doctors they hired
from 1986 to 1988, according to a published report Friday.
   According to a draft of a General Accounting Office study
obtained by The Washington Post, officials in the Department of
Veterans Affairs have failed to verify credentials for doctors and
medical residents at the nation's 172 VA hospitals.
   ``By not following applicable procedures, VA medical centers
could unknowingly hire `problem' physicians and-or be allowing
physicians with sanctions against their licenses to treat
veterans,'' the Post quoted the report as saying.
   The VA, declining direct comment on the report, issued a
statement Friday saying:
   ``Secretary (Edward J.) Derwinski views GAO studies as an
effective, independent management guide aiming for better quality
care for veterans. GAO is concurrently conducting major management
studies at VA at Derwinski's request. VA and Congress are partners
in seeking and delivering quality care for vets.''
   The Vietnam Veterans of America said the GAO report and an
earlier report on mortality rates at VA hospitals show that veterans
with service-connected disabilities should be allowed to seek health
care from the provider of their choice.
   ``If the government is unable to provide acceptable health care
through the veterans hospital system, then these veterans should
have the right to seek medical treatment elsewhere,'' said Mary R.
Stout, president of the 35,000-member group.
   VA spokeswoman Donna St. John said the group is making a false
comparison.
   ``Any attempt to connect the mortality review or the GAO report
with the quality of care is totally inappropriate,'' she said,
explaining that mortality rates fail to reflect the condition of the
patients who enter a particular hospital. Hospices, for example,
have reported 100 percent rates.
   She noted that the GAO report, according to the Post, said: ``The
conditions cited do not mean that the medical services provided by
the VA are substandard or that VA physicians are incompetent.''
   The GAO study was requested two years ago by Sen. Frank
Murkowski, R-Alaska, ranking minority member of the Senate Veterans'
Affairs Committee. His staff said it could not release a copy of the
report because it was in draft form. The VA said it could not
release the draft report, either.
   The full report, with VA comment, is due for release in August.
   Murkowski wrote a 1985 law telling the VA to act on those
problems after the American Medical Association found 87 doctors
were working for the agency even though their licenses had been
revoked, suspended or restricted.
   VA officials said they could prove they had checked the licenses
of only 105 of the 207 physicians hired from 1986 to 1988, the
report said. The report also said the VA had not fulfilled promises
to ensure that its doctors are qualified to practice their
particular specialties.
   A further problem was detected with medical residents who work at
VA hospitals, according to the draft report.
   The government watchdog agency said a records check with the FBI
found that 165 of the 16,756 residents had been charged with
criminal offenses between the early 1970s and May 1987, the Post
reported.
   Among the more serious offenses were 68 charged with drunken
driving and 67 charged with drug violations, five with vandalism and
five with burglary. The records did not indicate how many charges
led to convictions.

   A millionaire who handed out $10,000 checks
on the Senate floor while legislation that interested him was
pending said the checks were political contributions, not an attempt
to bribe lawmakers.
   ``It would be difficult to make it into a bribery case,'' said
Travis County District Attorney Ronnie Earle, who believes it's time
to change Texas' loose campaign finance laws. ``In Texas, it's
almost impossible to bribe a public official as long as you report
it.''
   The $10,000 personal checks, with the payee's name left blank,
were offered by Lonnie ``Bo'' Pilgrim, an East Texas chicken
processor, to nine of the 31 senators two days before Friday's vote
on a House workers' compensation bill.
   Business interests have favored the House plan, but senators
rejected it.
   Pilgrim said he was concerned about the high cost of workers'
compensation in Texas and that he would like a law that would be a
``win-win situation for all of us.''
   ``The common practice of mine is to give large contributions to
people _ preachers, educational institutions and politicians _ and
$10,000 or $100,000 is a common practice with me,'' Pilgrim said.
   ``It's primarily just for the name identification with the
politicians ... They will answer your calls and give you an
appointment and listen to you describe an issue. It does not infer a
bribe,'' Pilgrim said.
   Most lawmakers said they returned the checks _ or planned to. But
Sen. O.H. ``Ike'' Harris said he saw nothing wrong with accepting
the money.
   Blank payee lines like those on Pilgrim's checks are common _
because many people don't know the formal name of a politician's
campaign committee, Harris said.
   ``I've received campaign contributions that size before. If the
principle's wrong, it don't matter if it's a dollar or a million,
right? Everybody's got a different style,'' Harris said.
   Texas law does not limit campaign contributions, although
officeholders are barred from raising money during regular
legislative sessions. There is no such prohibition on special
sessions, and the Texas Senate has been in special session for three
weeks.
   ``I think it's outrageous. It offends the integrity of the whole
process,'' said Earle.
   ``It looks horrible,'' said Sen. Kent Caperton.
   ``When I first heard it, I thought they were joking. It's just so
outrageous. The law needs to be changed,'' said Caperton. ``We need
more limits about when we can take money and how much.''
   Rep. David Hudson said he was introducing a bill to prohibit
campaign contributions on the Capitol grounds.
   ``Such overt attempts to influence the way laws are made should
be stopped,'' Hudson said.

   A storm lashed the East with powerful wind and occassionally
heavy rain on Friday, toppling trees and power lines and unleashing
thunderstorms from New York to Maine.
   Much of the desert Southwest had readings between 100 and 109
degrees. Denver hit a record 100 degrees in the fourth consecutive
day of temperatures above 100 degrees.
   Strong wind pushed a utility pole onto a car with four people
inside at East Rodman, N.Y., and knocked over trees and utility
lines in Port Byron, Otisco and Onondaga, N.Y. One-inch diameter
hail fell at North Tonawanda.
   Flooding was reported near Roanoke, Va., Mount Savage, Md., and
in parts of Delaware.
   Other strong thunderstorms developed over western portions of the
Carolinas, central Texas, Tennessee and the lower Mississippi Valley
into Florida. Strong wind near Conway, Ark., destroyed several
mobile homes, including one that was blown onto a nearby highway.
   Thunderstorms were also scattered over southwestern North Dakota,
where small hail was reported.
   Heavier rainfall during the six hours ending at 2 p.m. EDT
included .57 inches at Lake Charles, La.; .53 inches at Waco, Texas;
.46 inches at McComb, Miss., and .13 inches at Sioux City, Iowa.
   Temperatures began warming up across much of the nation. A large,
stagnant upper level high-pressure system was centered over Colorado
and contributed to the hot weather.
   Afternoon readings were in the 90s from the lower Ohio Valley
across the middle Mississippi Valley, the central and southern
Plains, the central and southern Rockies to interior California.
Temperatures in the 90s also were common from Florida to along
portions of the Atlantic Coast.
   It was the seventh day of 100-plus temperatures at Scottsbluff,
Neb., breaking the record of six days set in July 1936.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 56
degrees at Arcata, Calif., to 109 degrees at Needles, Calif.
   The low in the nation Friday morning was 38 degrees at Truckee,
Calif.
   Saturday's forecast called for scattered showers and
thunderstorms from eastern Texas across the Gulf Coast region to the
southern Atlantic Coast and Florida; scattered thunderstorms across
the upper Great Lakes and the southern Plateau; showers along the
coast of Washington state; and sunny skies over much of the
remainder of the nation.
   Highs were expected to be in the 60s or 70s along much of the
Pacific Coast; 70s from eastern portions of the upper Great Lakes to
northern New England; above 90 degrees from the southern Atlantic
Coast and Florida across the Gulf Coast region, Mississippi Valley,
the Plains and Rockies into interior California and Oregon; above
100 degrees from the central high Plains across the central Rockies,
central and southern Plateau to interior valleys of California; and
in the 80s for the remainder of the nation.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev told the other
Soviet bloc leaders Friday they are free to pursue their own views
of communism, but suggested his own program of economic and social
reform as a guide.
   ``Each country and each party has its own specifics and can
continue its own individual road to socialist democracy and
progress,'' he said in a dinner toast after the first day of a
Warsaw Pact summit.
   His host at the banquet was President Nicolae Ceausescu of
Romania, the most vocal critic of Gorbachev's reforms.
   The alliance's seven members are divided over the new policies,
with the Soviet Union, Hungary and Poland on the liberal side and
Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, East Germany and Romania sticking to the
orthodox course.
   Their purposes at this summit are to discuss Western
arms-reduction proposals and the Warsaw Pact's role in a new world
where Gorbachev speaks of a ``common European home'' with no threat
or fear of war.
   In his dinner toast, the Soviet president said: ``We took new
steps today toward European security, rapprochement and East-West
dialogue.'' He also condemned unspecified ``forces'' that want
military confrontation.
   Ceausescu renewed what he described as the Soviet bloc's ``appeal
to NATO to give up its policy of nuclear deterrence.''
   Neither he nor Gorbachev mentioned what was decided Friday.
   Reporters were barred from the conference itself, but were
admitted to the banquet hall in the former royal palace long enough
to hear the brief dinner toasts.
   Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady Gerasimov told an
earlier news briefing Gorbachev and his colleagues discussed NATO
proposals for reducing conventional forces, and how the Soviet bloc
``should change, adapt ... become contemporary.''
   ``Everybody would agree there are vast changes, in our country,
in the world,'' Gerasimov said. ``They are talking about the role of
the Warsaw Pact in these changing conditions.''
   Gerasimov was evasive about whether the topics at the two-day
summit would include political divisions within the bloc.
   Ion Diaconu of the Romanian Foreign Ministry refused comment on a
report by the Soviet news agency Novosti that the leaders were
discussing creation of a Warsaw Pact ``political commission'' to
arbitrate disputes between members.
   Diaconu denied reports that Romania had requested a discussion at
the summit of its feud with Hungary over Romania's alleged
mistreatment of its 1.7 million ethnic Hungarians.
   Gerasimov said disputes within the bloc were not on the agenda,
but ``each delegation can say a few words about its own problems.''
   He said Gorbachev and other leaders addressed the meeting Friday,
but gave no details of the deliberations.
   Reporters were admitted to the palace for a few minutes while
Ceausescu greeted his guests.
   Gorbachev said in West Germany last month that the Bucharest
summit would respond to President Bush's proposal May 29 for a joint
reduction in U.S. and Soviet troops stationed in Europe to 275,000
for each side by 1993, accompanied by cuts in combat aircraft and
other conventional weapons.
   The Soviet leader said the Bush proposal, which will not be on
the table until September, had increased chances for quick agreement
at Vienna negotiations on conventional forces.
   He also is pushing for talks with NATO on reducing tactical, or
short-range, nuclear weapons in Europe, but the United States wants
the issue tied to cuts in conventional forces.
   West Germany, where most of NATO's battlefield nuclear weapons
are stationed, favors talks. The disagreement between the two allies
subsided after Bush made his conventional disarmament offer and said
it could be agreed within a year.
   On Thursday, during a visit to France, Gorbachev again tried to
push the Western alliance into talks on the short-range weapons,
offering the possibility of more unilateral cuts in the Kremlin's
nuclear arsenal if NATO agreed.
   His last offer to scrap nuclear weapons _ about 500 warheads _
came in May during a visit to Moscow by Secretary of State James A.
Baker III, while NATO was arguing about short-range missiles.
   There was unconfirmed speculation in Bucharest that documents
released after the summit ends Saturday might include numbers for
the Strasbourg offer.
   Presidents, Communist Party chiefs, premiers, defense and foreign
ministers and other ranking offiials from the seven Warsaw Pact
nations are attending the summit.
   Romanian television broadcast scenes of delegations arriving on
Thursday. Rezsoe Nyers, the Hungarian party chairman, appeared to be
the only delegation head Ceausescu did not greet with a comradely
kiss on the cheek.
   After Gorbachev arrived, reporters asked him what he expected of
the summit.
   ``I'll tell you when we've finished,'' he said.

<UNK>Court Allows Material Which Got Harper's Banned In Britain</UNK>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has lost a legal battle to stop
publication of a retired intelligence agent's book after banning an
American magazine that published excerpts.
   The House of Lords, Britain's top court, ruled on Thursday that
``Inside Intelligence'' by Anthony Cavendish could be published
because the government had acknowledged the book was not a threat to
national security.
   The government barred distribution in Britain of last December's
issue of the American magazine Harper's, which carried excerpts.
   It was the second major defeat for Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher's attempts to gag former intelligence agents.
   Last October, the five-judge court rejected a long and costly
attempt through British and foreign courts to ban publication of
``Spy Catcher,'' the memoirs of another ex-agent, Peter Wright.
   Two Scottish newspapers and Scottish Television, which fought the
Cavendish case, hailed the judgment as a victory over what critics
call excessive secretiveness by the Thatcher government.
   ``It was an overweening use of government authority,'' said
Arnold Kemp, editor of the Glasgow Herald.
   ``The government resorted to the tactics of the bully to try to
intimidate the press,'' he said.
   The Thatcher government says it is seeking to hold ex-agents to a
vow of lifelong silence.
   Harper's publisher, John MacArthur, had threatened to fight the
magazine case in the European Court of Human Rights. But Cavendish,
a 62-year-old merchant banker, said he had not given Harper's
permission to publish the excerpts.
   Cavendish, an agent from 1948-53 in Britain's foreign
intelligence operation, described spying in East bloc countries.
   He also claimed that Harold Wilson resigned abruptly as British
Labor Party prime minister in 1976 because the Soviet KGB had
embarrassing information about him.
   In December 1987 Cavendish, defying government instructions not
to publish the book, had 500 copies printed at this own expense and
sent them to friends as Christmas cards. A Scottish legislator
passed the book on to a newspaper, The Scotsman.

   The vast majority of assault weapons barred
from importation since spring will be banned permanently from this
country, the government announced Friday.
   The ban imposed on 43 styles of semiautomatic weapons _ including
the popular Chinese-made AK-47 and Israeli-made Uzi carbine _
followed a four-month study by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms on whether the weapons met the standards imposed by the Gun
Control Act of 1968, which barred importation of weapons that are
not used for legitimate sporting purposes.
   ``The study was undertaken because of the dramatic increase in
the number of these weapons being imported and police reports of
their use in violent crime,'' said Stephen E. Higgins, director of
the ATF bureau.
   While the 43 were banned permanently, another seven whose imports
had been suspended since early spring will be available for import
again as a result of the study. Those include six .22 rimfire
caliber rifles and a gun called the Valmet Hunter, which had been
considered an AK-47 type of weapon during the suspension.
   Higgins said the ATF, which studied the marketing and use of the
weapons, said the models banned were ``not being used for sporting
uses.'' Such weapons were identified officially Friday as
``semiautomatic assault rifles.''
   The ATF annually traces 35,000 to 40,000 guns used in crime, and
about 10 percent of them are semiautomatic assault weapons, Higgins
said, estimating that slightly more than half of them were domestic
makes that are not subject to ATF control.
   ``We're not saying that it will solve the basic problem'' of
crime, Higgins said, adding, ``Their use in crime is probably
disproportionately high compared with the number that are here.''
   Holding aloft one of the banned weapons _ an Israeli-made Galil
rifle _ Higgins pointed out some of the accoutrements that led to
its prohibition: a folding stock, a night sight, a flash suppressor
on the end that could serve as a grenade launcher, its ability to
accept a bayonet lug, a pistol grip and a large magazine.
   In the future, he said, weapons with several of these features
probably also would be subject to an import ban.
   Higgins estimated that the Customs Service has seized about
20,000 of the weapons and that those will not be allowed into the
country unless purchased by law enforcement agencies. Asked whether
the government will pay damages to importers, Higgins said, ``That's
something the court would decide.''
   Three importers already have brought suit against the government
over the suspension, and although a district court has upheld the
government in one of the cases, Higgins said the ATF would accept
comments on the permanent ban from any importers for 30 days. The
final regulations would be issued ``very quickly'' after that, he
said.
   Asked why the ATF previously had allowed imports of the
now-banned weapons, Higgins said the committee set up after the 1968
law was passed to determine whether guns qualified for import had
``concentrated primarily, almost exclusive, on handguns.'' It wasn't
until the number of assault-style weapons being imported increased
dramatically that the ATF focused on them, he said.
   The action Friday was lauded by gun control advocates, but Wayne
LaPierre, executive director of the NRA Institute for Legislative
Action, said it was ``inconsistent with the rights guaranteed
law-abiding American gun owners under the Second Amendment to the
Constitution. The National Rifle Association will fight this
decision in the courts, on Capitol Hill and at the ballot box.''
   John M. Snyder, spokesman for the Citizens Committee for the
Right to Keep and Bear Arms, said the ban ``shows the
undependability of government, because originally, the ATF had
certified that these rifles could be imported because they are
suitable for sporting purposes.
   ``I think it also tends to further undermine whatever credibility
President Bush has left with the firearms-owning community in the
United States,'' he added.
   Bush, a hunter and a lifetime member of the National Rifle
Association, came into office opposing any bans on the assault-style
weapons, despite an outcry over their increasing popularity among
drug gangs and a heightened public concern triggered by the January
schoolyard slayings of five children in Stockton, Calif., by a man
wielding an AK-47.
   However, Bush asked William J. Bennett, the director of the
Office of National Drug Control Policy, to advise him on what to do
about the weapons. In March, at Bennett's urging, Treasury Secretary
Nicholas Brady suspended the imports of many of the weapons, and
Bush expanded the list the following month.
   The ATF, which has the power to control imports, does not
regulate domestic manufacture of weapons, so similar weapons made in
the United States would not be affected by the action. Several bills
pending in Congress would control or eliminate many of the U.S.-made
assault-style weapons.
   The ATF has estimated that domestic makes account for
three-quarters of the 3 million semiautomatic rifles now owned by
Americans. Colt Industries Inc. suspended sales of its AR-15, the
most popular of the domestic assault semiautomatic rifles, in March.
   Sarah Brady, chairwoman of Handgun Control Inc., praised the
ATF's action as Bush's ``leadership in working toward reducing
assault weapon violence by stopping the import of these weapons of
war.
   ``I urge the president and the Congress to continue in the
direction of public safety by passing legislation to stop the
domestic production of assault weapons,'' said Mrs. Brady, whose
husband, former White House press secretary Jim Brady, was severely
wounded in the 1981 assassination attempt on President Reagan. ``It
is no more acceptable to have citizens being gunned down by killing
machines wearing a `Made in the USA' label than by those made
abroad.''
   Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, and Rep. Pete Stark, D-Calif.,
who have authored bills that would severely limit or end future
sales of domestically produced semiautomatic assault-style weapons
as well as imports, echoed Mrs. Brady's views.
   ``The president's ban on imported assault weapons cannot make our
streets safer unless we also ban American-made assault weapons,''
said Metzenbaum. The senator said some domestic makes also ``are
favored by drug dealers and street gangs and are used against police
officers and innocent citizens.''
   Said Stark: ``The president's decision to ban imported assault
weapons while ignoring domestic ones is a glaring loophole.''
   The NRA has argued vociferously against limits on the rights of
law-abiding citizens to own the weapons and has urged a crackdown on
criminals rather than imposition of new gun-control laws.
   The weapons banned come primarily from China, Israel, West
Germany and Belgium. Others are made in Austria, Australia, Italy
and Switzerland, among other countries.

   The government said Friday one soldier
has been arrested and two are being sought in a widely publicized
human rights case involving the killing of leftist Reynaldo
Francisco.
   The announcement by J. Antonio Carpio, director of the National
Bureau of Investigation, was seen as an apparent bid to defuse
criticism of President Corazon Aquino's civil liberties record
during her visit to Europe.
   She leaves on Saturday for West Germany, France and Belgium.
   Carpio said Constable 2nd Class Dioscoro Ambagay Jr. was arrested
and warrants were issued for Sgt. Arnel Jocson and Constable 1st
Class Ramon Clavo in the March 1988, slaying of Francisco and an
attempt on the life of his companion, Hilario Bustamente.
   Bustamante was found near death on March 21, 1988, with deep stab
wounds and cuts across his body.
   He told authorities he and Francisco were abducted on a Manila
street three days earlier while putting up posters protesting U.S.
bases in the Philippines. He said they were taken to the
headquarters of Mrs. Aquino's security force, tortured and then
driven to a remote area where Francisco was slain.
   Bustamente left for the Netherlands last April to address a human
rights conference and has remained there.
   Carpio now wants him to return here to identify the suspects so
they can be charged in court.
   In a memorandum, Carpio noted that the case ``is one of the human
rights cases exploited abroad by the CPP-NDF propaganda,'' referring
to the Communist Party of the Philippines and its ally, the National
Democratic Front.
   In Iligan city, 500 miles southeast of Manila, assailants on
Friday shot to death Capt. Nick Enterina, a provincial police chief,
and Police Sgt. Rogato Garido as they chatted on the street near the
police station, the Philippine Constabulary reported.
   It said the gunmen, believed to be members of the communist New
People's Army, fled on foot.

<HEAD>District Attorneys Eager To Bring Back Old Anti-Abortion Law</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Several Louisiana prosecutors are eager to
resurrect the state's old law banning abortions, in light of the
U.S. Supreme Court's upholding Missouri's restrictions on the
operation.
   ``I firmly believe that abortion is homicide and killing of an
unborn fetus. If a crime has been committed, we will enforce the law
as written here in Rapides Parish,'' District Attorney Charles F.
Wagner said Friday.
   ``The statute's still on our books ... We intend to use that as a
vehicle to get back in court,'' said Harry Connick, district
attorney in Orleans Parish.
   The state House, in a resolution approved 81-13, asked
prosecutors Thursday to enforce whatever pre-1973 abortion laws they
consider constitutional.
   The Senate rewrote the resolution Friday to call for enforcement
of a more recent law similar to the Missouri law that forbids use of
state money, workers or facilities for abortions.
   Federal courts ordered Louisiana in 1976 not to enforce its
abortion law, which carried a penalty of up to 10 years in prison.
However, it never was ruled unconstitutional, said John S. Baker
Jr., a professor at Louisiana State University Law Center.
   Wagner and other prosecutors said they would have to review
Monday's decision before deciding whether to use Louisiana laws
suspended after the 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision that gave women a
right to abortions.
   Some prosecutors were flatly dubious.
   ``I don't think the U.S. Supreme Court has abrogated Wade,'' said
Nathan Stansbury of Lafayette. ``I don't think our general statute
that says all abortions are prohibited is renewed by the Missouri
decision.''
   Baker, who argued the case as an assistant district attorney for
Orleans Parish, said he and Connick have talked about bringing it
back into federal district court but have not made a final decision.
   ``I told Mr. Connick that ... there seemed to be an invitation in
(Monday's ruling) to raise the issue, and that this case might be a
vehicle for doing so,'' Baker said.
   Baker said they probably will decide soon whether to ask the
federal court to reconsider the case that prohibited abortion in
Louisiana.
   Jefferson Parish District Attorney John Mamoulides said his staff
was drawing up a memo for the sheriff's office, outlining which
parts of the old law might legally be enforced.

   A federal grand jury has indicted a space
equipment supply company for allegedly billing the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration for fraudulent labor costs on a
space shuttle contract.
   ILC Space Systems of Houston was indicted Thursday with 11 counts
of filing false billing vouchers in 1985. If convicted on all the
counts, the company faces a $5.5 million fine.
   The amount of the alleged fraudulent billing was not included in
the indictment and Assistant U.S. Attorney John Smith declined to
provide the specifics of the allegation.
   Although none of the company's employees was named in the
indictment, Smith said additional indictments are possible.
   Frank Mossman, a spokesman for ILC Dover Inc., ILC Space Systems'
Delaware-based parent company that builds the space suits used by
NASA astronauts, said he could not comment because he had not seen
the indictment.
   ILC Space Systems is under contract to manufacture a heat-shield
system used on the space shuttle's solid-fuel rocket boosters.
   The federal indictment and investigation stem from allegations
that ILC Space Systems illegally passed through labor costs to the
space agency for work actually performed under a fixed-cost
contract, in which the contractor is supposed to pick up the tab for
any unexpected costs.

<HEAD>Base Finds Three F-16 Engines Reported Stolen</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HILL AIR FORCE BASE, Utah (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three F-16 jet engines that
mysteriously disappeared from Hill Air Force Base earlier this week
were found Friday, but their return was as murky as their
leave-taking.
   The 3,200-pound engines, valued at about $2 million apiece, were
recovered by the FBI, but the bureau isn't talking. The engines
``are in the possession of the government,'' said Hill spokesman Len
Barry.
   ``We cannot discuss any details of the theft or recovery of those
engines because the matter is still under investigation by the FBI
and the Air Force Office of Special Investigation,'' Barry said.
   FBI Special Agent Tim Screen confirmed the engines had been
located, but refused to provide further details.
   Retired Rear Adm. Gene R. La Rocque, director of the Center for
Defense Information, a military think tank in Washington, said he
knew of engine parts being stolen in the past.
   ``But ... whole jet engines, that just boggles my mind,'' he said
Friday. ``I'd think it would be easier to steal a whole plane.''
   La Rocque said millions of dollars have been lost through
military employees stealing parts to sell, including many for a
lucrative black market in spares for the F-14 fighter.
   The engines are rebuilt Pratt &amp; Whitney F-100 TW200 series, about
17 feet long, 34 inches in diameter and weighing 3,200 pounds each.
   Earlier, Hill spokeswoman Maj. Portia McCracken said
investigators had determined the engines were apparently taken off
the base sometime between noon Saturday and noon Monday.
   She did not know if the engines belonged to Hill or if they had
been sent from another base to be serviced. ``Nothing like this has
ever happened in my memory. I would say that it is very unusual,''
McCracken said.
   The engines were discovered missing by maintenance crews
returning to work Wednesday after the Independence Day holiday.
   Hill officials said the engines would have had to exit one of
three gates on the base that are manned 24 hours a day with security
guards.
   The F-16 is flown by pilots of the Air Force's 388th Tactical
Fighter Wing and the Utah Air National Guard's 419th Tactical
Fighter Wing, both based at Hill.

   The Pentagon announced Friday that the first
free-flight test of a so-called SLAM missile resulted in a direct
hit last month at a California test site.
   The weapon, also known as a Standoff Land Attack Missile, is a
derivative of the Harpoon missile system.
   It is designed to be fired from aircraft carrier-based planes and
hit targets on land or ships at sea. A ``standoff'' weapon can be
fired from some distance away from the target so that the plane
carrying the weapon is not exposed to enemy fire.
   The SLAM missile makes use of an infrared system that sends a
video image to the plane's pilot, who can select a specific area of
the target.
   In a statement, the Pentagon said the June 24 test was conducted
at the Pacific Missile Center Range in California.
   The missile was fired from a A-6E attack bomber and scored a
``direct hit'' on a simulated missile communication site, the
statement said.
   Nine additional flights are schedule for the test program, the
statement said.
   The missile, built by McDonnell Douglas Missile Systems Co., is
manufactured in St. Charles, Mo., the statement said.

<DATELINE>KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sudan's new military ruler said Friday
that ousted Prime Minister Sadek el-Mahdi and 40 other arrested
politicians will face military tribunals on charges of corruption.
   Lt. Gen. Omar Hassan Ahmed el-Bashir said special military courts
will be formed soon for the trials.
   ``I will only be gentle to an honest man,'' el-Bashir said in an
interview with the British Broadcasting Corp. and the U.S.
government-funded Voice Of America. The Associated Press was given
access to the tape.
   ``Those politicians will wish they were being tried under Sharia
(Islamic) laws,'' he said, indicating they will face tough trials.
   El-Mahdi escaped immediately after el-Bashir's coup on June 30
but was arrested in a Khartoum suburb on Thursday.
   Sudan's Islamic laws, passed in 1983, caused an outrcry in the
West because of punishments that include cutting off limbs for
theft, death by stoning for women who commit adultery and lashing
for drinking alconol.
   The laws, currently suspended, are one of the main complaints of
the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army, which has been fighting
for six years for greater autonomy and political, economic and
administrative reforms.
   El-Bashir has pledged to hold a national referendum on the laws
if planned peace talks with the rebels in the Ethiopian capital
Addis Ababa fail.
   El-Bashir, at the request of the Ethiopian government, postponed
plans for sending a delegation to Addis Ababa, the official Sudan
News Agency reported Friday. It did not elaborate.
   Disbanding Sudan's 36 political parties was among el-Bashir's
first decrees after the coup, and he said Friday the decision was
final.
   He accused political parties of being the cause of Sudan's
problems and said he would find another way for the nation's people
to participate in government.
   ``I don't think Sudan is ready for democracy with multiple
parties,'' el-Bashir said.
   He said the United States could play a role in Sudan by providing
economic aid and helping his administration reach a settlement with
the rebels.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An estimated 1,600 people are attacked annually at
automated teller machines nationwide, and the near-fatal shooting of
a woman forced to withdraw $400 proves ATM customers need more
protection, an alderman said.
   Alderman Edward Burke introduced a plan Thursday that would shut
down ATMs between midnight and 6 a.m. It also would require a
yearly, $200 city license and safety inspections of ATM locations by
police.
   ``We can no longer wait to take action to make these areas safer
for the residents of Chicago,'' Burke said.
   Burke said his restrictions might have prevented the assault on
Dana Feitler, 24, who was accosted near her apartment on June 18,
forced to withdraw $400 from a cash machine and then was shot in the
head.
   She remains hospitalized in a coma.
   ``I see these machines that hand out cash to people standing on
the street at any time of day or night and I know that they are
inviting crime,'' said Police Superintendent LeRoy Martin, who is
backing Burke's plan.
   Clinton Krislov, a lawyer who filed a class-action lawsuit on
behalf of bank customers following the Feitler shooting, has called
for ATM safeguards, including more drive-through terminals to let
customers stay in their cars, and secret ``panic'' numbers to alert
police to a problem.
   ``Banks have security to protect machines from the customers,''
he said, but they don't have adequate security for those customers.
   In Ms. Feitler's case, a camera at the ATM where she was robbed
took a picture only of her, but not her assailants, police have said.
   David Taylor, an executive with the Bank Administration
Institute, a professional organization, said Friday the machines are
safe but people must use common sense.
   ``It takes an extra measure of thoughtfulness and care on the
part of people using the machines at night and in remote areas,'' he
said.
   Bank customers interviewed Friday said they'd feel shortchanged
if ATM use was restricted.
   ``The fact that you can come and get your money anytime day or
night, that's the whole point of having these automatic tellers,''
said Chris Wells.
   ``They are a security problem,'' said Steve Petran, an office
worker. ``I can see where you're asking for trouble. But you have to
be aware that that's life in the city.''
   Hearings on the proposed ordinance are scheduled July 18 before
the council's Finance Committee, which Burke chairs.

   Police killed three escaped
convicts Friday, captured three others and rescued unharmed a
12-year-old hostage after a bus hijacking and chase through remote
northeastern Brazil, officials reported.
   The six men, armed with revolvers and a shotgun, escaped from the
Lemos de Brito penitentiary, Carlos Anselmo, head of the Bahia State
Security Bureau, said by telephone from the state capital of
Salvador.
   Anselmo said the six first tried unsuccessfully on Thursday to
rob a branch of the Bahia State Bank in Uaua, about 200 miles from
Conceicao do Coite.
   He said they then stopped a bus carrying about 40 passengers and
ordered the driver to head for Conceicao do Coite, a city of about
60,000 lying about 1,180 miles northeast of Rio.
   There, scores of police surrounded the bus and exchanged gunfire
with the hijackers. Three passengers were slightly injured, Jackson
Ferreira of the mayor's office at Conceicao do Coite said by
telephone.
   Before dawn Friday, the hijackers took several hostages from the
bus and fled in a car provided by local authorities. Outside of town
they released all hostages except a 12-year-old boy, then abandoned
the car and fled on foot through the brush, Ferreira said.
   Early Friday, police surrounded a peasant's cottage where the
fugitives had holed up with their hostage and killed three of the
escapers and seized the other three, mayoral aide Ferreira said.
   ``They wanted to hide in the outback, but a lot of peasants live
in the region and it was easy for the police to find them,'' he
added.

<TEXT>
   China's industrial production grew much more
slowly in the first half of 1989 than in 1988, according to figures
released Friday, but the government seemed unsure whether that was
good or not.
   From an economic standpoint, the news was good: China has been
trying since last fall to slow what it called overheated industrial
growth that was fueling inflation and shortages.
   But since quelling nationwide pro-democracy protests last month,
the government has sought for political reasons to show that
factories are operating normally and production is climbing. News
media have been filled with reports of improved production
nationwide.
   Total industrial output from January through June was $172.9
billion, up 10.8 percent over the same period last year, the
official Xinhua News Agency said, quoting the State Statistics
Bureau.
   By comparison, industrial output in the first half of 1988 grew
17.2 percent over the same period one year earlier. This year, the
government set target of gradually declining growth rates, beginning
with below 16 percent in the first quarter and below 13 percent in
the second. The goal for the year is a 10 increase in production
over 1988.
   Xinhua might well have reported that the nation overfulfilled its
target for controlling too-rapid growth.
   Instead, it focused on industrial production's having grown
``steadily.'' Another Xinhua dispatch said Shanghai, China's leading
industrial city, topped its production quota for the first half of
the year.
   The news agency said Shanghai's industrial output was $13.9
billion up 9 percent from last year.
   It said the growth ``was achieved in the face of shortages of
energy, funds and raw materials during the turmoil which lasted
nearly two months in the city.''

   Adm. William J. Crowe, retiring head of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Friday that his historic 11-day visit to
the Soviet Union revealed the superpowers are entering a period of
``uneasy transition'' that ``does not ... make me feel comfortable.''
   Crowe, in a speech before the National Press Club, said he hopes
the two military giants are moving toward a new era in the
superpower relationship, but ``to conclude that we are already there
would be a serious mistake.''
   The 64-year-old admiral, speaking a day after President Bush
rejected a new call from Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev for
talks to eliminate short-range nuclear missiles in Europe, said he
believes United States should avoid ``dramatic counter-responses''
to Kremlin initiatives ``at this point.''
   Crowe met for more than an hour with Gorbachev two weeks ago in
Moscow during his precedent-setting tour of once-secret Soviet
military installations and visits with Soviet military officers.
   It was the first formal visit of a Joint Chiefs chairman to the
Soviet Union and was the latest in a series of high-level visits
designed to dispel distrust between the superpowers. Last July,
Crowe hosted Marshal Sergei F. Akhromeyev, then the Soviet chief of
staff, on a U.S. visit.
   ``There is little question in my mind that real change is afoot
in the Soviet Union,'' Crowe said, adding that he believed that
Gorbachev and his supporters were committed to ``fundamental
reform.''
   Crowe said that while there are encouraging signs that
Gorbachev's reforms and promised military cutbacks may help move
away from the confrontational legacy of the postwar era, the Soviet
changes ``have yet to be translated into reality.''
   ``Our systems remain fundamentally competitive,'' he said.
   The Soviets still retain the world's largest military force and
have made no major changes in their space, air defense or strategic
weapons, he said.
   The admiral lauded the Soviet military officers he met as
``disciplined, well-trained and motivated'' and found their
equipment to be ``impressive and capable in the field.''
   He termed political and social changes the Soviets have initiated
as ``immense and risky.''
   Crowe said he believed the Soviets don't always understand the
United States and ``don't appreciate why we don't respond
move-for-move'' and ``sometimes interpret this phenomenon as
threatening to them.''
   ``All of this does not give me a warm, fuzzy feeling, nor make me
comfortable,'' Crowe said. ``What can be said is that we are
entering a period of uneasy transition and hopefully we are moving
toward a new era in the superpower relationship.''
   The admiral said the Soviets are attempting to ``shed their
past'' and ``don't appreciate why our historical realtionship still
weighs heavily in our decisions.''
   Therefore, Crowe argued, the two superpowers ``may be in this
unsettled state for a long period of time.''
   ``My deepest concern is that our own impatience doesn't force us
to move too far before we understand where the world is headed,''
Crowe said. The United States must ``move gradually and deliberately
in reasonable steps as the horizon becomes clearer _ not before,''
he added.
   The military chief announced on Sunday that he will retire on
Sept. 30 at the end of his second two-year term as chairman.

<TEXT>
   Americans took out $3.6 billion more in
consumer debt than they retired in May as the pace of borrowing
turned upward again, the government reported Friday.
   The Federal Reserve Board said consumer credit in May rose at a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.2 percent, up from the 4.3
percent pace of the previous month. Still, it was a smaller rise
than increases of 6.6 percent in March and 9.5 percent in February.
   Consumer credit had increased 8.5 percent over all of 1988.
   Consumer spending is closely watched as a barometer of the
economy's health since it represents two-thirds of overall economic
activity.
   Cynthia Latta, an economist with Data Resources Inc., in
Lexington, Mass., said the report suggests consumer confidence.
   ``Consumers are still adding to their debt,'' she said. ``When
they really get worried, they retrench and start paying down.''
   Interest rates, she said, do not have as much influence on
consumer credit as with other types of loans.
   ``Revolving credit rates hardly move at all, and auto rates only
a percent or so,'' she said. This type of consumer ``is more
concerned with the amount of the monthly payments, not the amount of
interest.''
   Until the spring, interest rates had been rising as the Fed
tightened its grip on credit in its attempt to stem inflation. Since
early last month however, the central bank has loosened its grip and
interest rates have declined somewhat.
   Leading the overall consumer credit increase in May was the
category of debt that includes credit cards. It rose $1.94 billion,
a 12.6 percent annual rate of growth, after a 10.9 percent increase
in April.
   Auto loans were up $1.02 billion May, a 4.2 percent increase on
an annual basis compared to a 2.8 percent rise in April, the Fed
reported. Auto loans had gone up only 0.3 percent in March.
   Bank and credit union loans not secured by real estate increased
by $659 million in May, a 4 percent annual rate of advance, up from
2 percent in April.
   Borrowing for mobile homes fell for the fourth consecutive month,
declining by $15 million at an annual rate of 0.7 percent. That
followed drops of 8.7 percent in April and 84.2 percent in March.
The steep March drop occurred largely becasue of a shift in debt
from the mobile home category into that of bank loans.
   The various changes left total consumer debt in May at a
seasonally adjusted $697.26 billion.

   President Daniel arap Moi said Friday that
police have raided 27,500 illegal breweries in the month since he
banned the brewing and drinking of traditional alcoholic beverages.
   Moi announced the figure while addressing an agricultural show in
western Kenya.
   Moi, a teetotaler, banned Kenya's traditional drink, chang'aa, on
June 10 and said at the time that he was ``not prepared to lead a
drunken nation.''
   Various kinds of chang'aa are home-brewed mainly from fermented
honey, sugar cane, coconut, and grains such as corn, millet and
sorghum.
   Chang'aa is a popular drink, particularly in the countryside,
during social occasions and at traditional ceremonies.
   Moi said the largest number of illegal brewers discovered were in
Kenya's southwestern Nyanza province on Lake Victoria, where police
raided an estimated 11,000 distilleries.

<HEAD>Lawmakers Says Government Will Buy $15 Million Worth Of Apples</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LES BLUMENTHAL</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The Department of Agriculture will purchase $15
million worth of apples in an effort to help reduce a huge surplus
created when consumers stopped buying amid fears over use of the
chemical Alar, the department said Friday.
   The industry has estimated that 5 million to 7 million boxes of
apples from last year's crop, valued at between $40 million and $56
million, remain unsold.
   The department said apple stocks were 53 percent greater on May
31 than the average for that date for the previous three years, and
prices to growers had fallen by $3 to $4 per carton from what they
were a year ago.
   The top grade of red apples produced in Washington state were
recently selling for between $7.50 and $8 per box, about $2 below
the cost of production. The nation's 20,000 apple growers have
estimated losses at well over $100 million in sales.
   Alar is used to enchance red color, to ease harvesting by
delaying ripening so that most apples ripen together and to lengthen
shelf and storage life. The chemical penetrates throughout the fruit
tissue and cannot be washed off like many pesticides.
   The Alar controversy began in late February when a private
environmental advocacy group, the Natural Resources Defense Council,
said apples treated with the chemical substantially increase the
risk of cancer in children.
   In cooperation with the department, the industry will release
apples to schools, prisons, food aid programs and others.
   ``By removing these apples from normal channels of trade, the
apple market will be helped immediately and stocks should be cleared
out before the beginning of the 1989 season,'' said a department
statement attributed to Kenneth J. Clayton, acting administrator of
the department's Agricultureal Marketing Service.
   ``This is a major purchase,'' said Republican Rep. Sid Morrison,
whose central Washington district produces roughly half of the
nation's apples.
   Morrison said the ``Alar scare has been a form of nutritional
terrorism that has unfairly dropped an economic bombshell on apple
growers.''
   Though the Environmental Protection Agency and the Food and Drug
Administration disputed the environmental group's report as a major
exaggeration of the risk, sales fell immediately. Supermarkets began
frequent posting of signs proclaiming their apples as Alar-free, and
reducing prices on the red delicious variety on which Alar
frequently had been used.
   Even though EPA criticized the Natural Resources Defense Council
report, the agency plans to ban use of Alar and the manufacturer has
withdrawn it from the U.S. market.

<TEXT>
   The nation's unemployment rate climbed slightly
to 5.3 percent last month as continued declines in manufacturing and
construction slowed overall job growth, the government said Friday
in providing fresh evidence of a slowing economy.
   Analysts were split on whether the jobless data provided by the
Labor Department suggested a recession was nearing, but they were
unanimous in saying there was nothing in the report to change the
Federal Reserve's apparent decision to ease monetary policy.
   ``The Fed has apparently shifted gears now and it views the risk
of a recession as more pronounced than the risk of inflation,''
Merrill Lynch analyst Bruce Steinberg said.
   Wall Street's initial reaction was indifferent but a broad
advance came later as analysts interpreted the report as an
encouragement for the Fed to relax credit and thus as a possible
harbinger of lower interest rates. The Dow Jones average of 30
industrials climbed 25.42 points to 2,487.86, its fourth consecutive
gain.
   The increase in the civilian jobless rate from 5.2 percent in May
to 5.3 percent last month was not unexpected; most economists had
predicted the rate would hold steady or edge up a notch.
   More attention was focused on the department's report that
non-farm businesses added just 180,000 jobs last month after a
revised payroll expansion of 207,000 jobs in May. For the past four
months businesses added an average of just below 200,000 jobs a
month, well below the nearly 300,000 average monthly gains posted in
1988.
   Virtually all of the June growth came in the service sector, with
the goods-producing sectors of manufacturing and construction
posting declines of 31,000 and 8,000 jobs, respectively.
   ``This is certainly consistent with the picture that the economy
is growing at a slower rate than it has been, with a real weakness
in the goods-producing industries _ where you would expect the
impact of high interest rates to be most severe,'' said Pierre
Ellis, a senior economist with Boston Co. Economic Advisers Inc.
   Those higher interest rates are attributed to the Fed's more than
yearlong campaign to slow growth by holding tight on credit, an
effort which appears to have given way in recent weeks to an easing
of monetary policy.
   The campaign has produced the slower rate of economic growth the
central bank desired. But Ellis and other analysts said it was
troubling that the burden for the slowdown to date has been borne
almost solely in the goods-producing industries, because declines in
those areas generally occur prior to a recession.
   Ellis predicted a recession in early 1990; Merrill Lynch has said
one is likely in the second half of this year.
   Michael Evans, head of a Washington forecasting firm, disputed
those estimates and said continued monthly job growth in the 200,000
range would allow the economy to slow without toppling into
recession.
   In another sure indicator of slowing economic growth, the Labor
Department said the average factory workweek slipped slipped 0.1 of
an hour to 40.9 hours last month, the first time this indicator has
fallen below 41 hours since September 1987.
   There was a bit of encouraging news regarding inflation _ the
department reported average hourly earnings of production and
supervisory workers were essentially unchanged. For the first five
months of the year, hourly wages had grown on average by 0.3
percent. But analysts cautioned against reading too much into the
month-to-month figures because the number often vary over a period
of just a few months.
   The payroll numbers are taken from the department's monthly
survey of business establishments.
   Data from a separate household survey, used to set the
unemployment rate, found that the civilian labor force grew by
492,000 people from May to June, to a total of 124.1 million. That
increase came after a reported decline in the labor force in May and
likely was influenced by summer entrants into the job market.
   Of the civilian labor force, 117.5 million held jobs and 6.5
million were looking for work but could not find it, the government
said.
   Among most demographic groups the unemployment rate was unchanged
or up just slightly. But increases in joblessness were reported for
teen-agers in general and black female teen-agers in particular. The
rate for the latter group shot up from 28 percent in May to more
than 40 percent last month.
   Among all teen-agers the unemployment rate rose from 15.2 percent
to 15.6 percent. That came as the labor force for that age group
grew by more than 100,000, apparently due to an influx of students
into the labor market.
   The government said blacks made up the bulk of the new teen-agers
in the labor force. In contrast to young black women, male black
teen-agers had some success in finding jobs as their unemployment
rate fell more than 3 percentage points to a still-high 33.5 percent.
   The civilian jobless rate has been hovering in the 5 percent
range for more than a year. It was 5.4 percent in June 1988 and fell
to a more than 15-year low of 5.0 percent in March before heading
upward. Most analysts believe it will climb to 5.5 percent or higher
by year's end.

<HEAD>Boeing Jets Cleared for Delivery to China</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal trade sanctions that stalled the delivery
of three Boeing jetliners to China last month have been lifted, a
Boeing spokesman said Friday.
   Three 757-200s valued at $150 million will be delivered as soon
as possible, said Boeing Commercial Airplanes spokesman Randy
Harrison.
   The planes were to be delivered in June but were held up when the
State Department's Office of Munitions Control suspended the export
licenses for crucial navigational components in the aircraft,
department spokesman Ken Bailes has said.
   President Bush halted all sales of military equipment to China
following the killing of hundreds of pro-democracy demonstrators in
Beijing on June 4.
   The State Department on Friday lifted the suspensions on the
three planes and on one other plane that is scheduled for delivery
later this month, Harrison said.
   ``As far as I know, the State Department has reviewed the
suspensions and decided that these items are not part of the
original intent of the presidential trade sanctions,'' Harrison said.
   State Department spokesman Dennis Harter said the suspension
order was lifted for Honeywell Corp. navigational systems used in
the Boeing planes. The navigational systems are on the controlled
U.S. munitions list.
   ``Our decision is in keeping with the president's intent not to
disrupt non-military commercial trade with the Peoples Republic of
China and was based on the fact that these navigational systems are
designed for inclusion in civilian products and are critical to the
safe operation of commercial aircraft,'' Harter said.
   ``To have denied these exports would have jeopardized the safety
of civilian airline passengers traveling in China.''
   Harter said the order also authorizes Honeywell to repair and
replace defective navational systems in civilian Chinese aircraft.
   Original dates of delivery of two aircraft to Guangzhou Airlines
were June 12 and June 22. The due date for one airplane for Shanghai
Airlines was June 17, Harrison said.
   The planes have a two-class seating configuration for between 176
and 180 passengers, Harrison said. He did not know when actual
delivery would take place.
   The Chinese Aviation Administration Corporation system already
operates five 757-200s, Harrison said. The Chinese government has
purchased 61 Boeing airplanes of all models since 1971, with a total
value of $2.35 billion.
   The Chinese government is still awaiting delivery of another
seven aircraft. The 11-plane deal is valued at $650 million,
Harrison said.

   President Bush will nominate Oregon lawyer John
E. Frohnmayer as chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts,
the independent federal agency that awards nearly $170 million in
grants each year.
   Frohnmayer, whose nomination requires Senate confirmation, would
succeed Frank Hodsoll.
   A graduate of Stanford University, the University of Chicago and
the University of Oregon Law School, Frohnmayer is an accomplished
singer, avid art collector and longtime supporter of Oregon arts
organizations. He practices law in Portland.
   Frohnmayer was a member of the Oregon Arts Commission for eight
years, serving as chairman from 1980 to 1984. He worked for Bush's
presidential campaign in Oregon.
   Anne Murphy, executive director of the American Arts Alliance, a
Washington arts advocacy group, called Frohnmayer ``a very bright,
caring guy'' who ``has a real commitment to the arts.''
   Interviewed by telephone in Oregon, Frohnmayer himself said: ``I
think it would be premature for me to suggest what I might do before
I'm nominated and confirmed. I certainly would say my enthusiasm for
this job is unbounded.''
   If confirmed for a four-year term, Frohnmayer would take charge
of an agency whose grant-making procedures have been harshly
criticized by several conservative members of Congress who have
accused it of supporting pornographic or blasphemous art.
   The controversy focuses on the endowment's financial support of a
national tour of an exhibition of photographs by Robert
Mapplethorpe, who died of AIDS in March, and a grant made to an
artist through the Southeastern Center for Contemporary Art.
   The Mapplethorpe show, which includes explicit homoerotic
pictures, was scheduled to open July 1 at the Corcoran Gallery of
Art here but was canceled.
   Corcoran director Christina Orr-Cahall said the gallery wanted to
avoid getting embroiled in a political battle over the endowment's
congressional appropriation.
   The works of the other grant recipient, artist Andres Serrano,
include a depiction of Jesus on a crucifix submerged in the artist's
urine.
   Bush was reported to have chosen Frohnmayer over several other
candidates, including Schuyler G. Chapin, former dean of the
Columbia University arts school, and Milton Rhodes, president of the
American Council of the Arts.
   Hodsoll, appointed by President Reagan, left the post in February
after eight years to work in the White House Office of Management
and Budget.
   Bush also announcedhis intention to nominate:
   _Arthur W. Fort, assistant secretary of state for administration.
Fort is former commander of the Pacific Division of Naval Facilities
Engineering Command and commander of the Pacific Fleet Seabees.
   _Milton James Wilkinson, deputy representative of the United
States in the U.N. Security Council with the rank of ambassador. He
would succeed Patricia Mary Byrne.

<TEXT>
   The Association of Southeast
Asian Nations is in town for it 22nd meeting and the streets are
bedecked with bunting, so why do the decorations feature the number
43 instead of 22?
   Because the bunting isn't for the delegates; it's for the sultan,
who turns 43 on July 15.
   The sultan, who has 37 words in his name and title, is worth $30
billion and takes very good care of the 241,000 people over whom he
has absolute sway.
   He is Duli Yang Maha Mulia Paduka Seri Baginda Sultan and Yang
Di-Pertuan Negeri Brunei Awang Muda Hassanal Bolkiah Mu'issaddin
Waddaulah Ibni Duli Yang Teramat Mulia Paduka Seri Begawan Sultan
Awang Muda Omar Ali Aifuddin Saifuddin Sa'adul Khairi Waddin.
   Most people just call him Sir Hassanal Bolkiah.
   His sultanate, 2,226 square miles on the north coast of Borneo,
sits on a huge pool of oil and natural gas.
   The Guinness Book of World Records says Sir Hassanal is the
world's richest individual becauwe oil income and foreign currency
reserves totaling almost $30 billion are ``effectively at his
disposal.''
   Fortune magazine confirmed his enormous wealth and said King Fahd
of Saudi Arabia was second with $18 billion.
   Secular, religious and military power rest with the sultan, a
hereditary ruler who is head of state, prime minister, defense
minister and commander of the armed forces.
   One of his brothers is in charge of foreign affairs and another
heads the Finance Ministry of this former British protectorate,
which became fully independent five years ago.
   As well as being the richest person in the world, Sir Hassanal
lives with his relatives in the world's biggest palace _ a complex
of buildings built with 38 types of marble on a 300-acre hill near
the Brunei River.
   In case friends decide to stay over, it has 1,778 rooms and 257
toilets. There are 564 chandeliers, 18 elevators, 44 staircases and
a banquet hall that seats 4,000.
   His majesty's polo ponies have air-conditioned quarters.
   More than 2,000 workers completed the Istana (palace) Nurul Imam
for independence in 1984 and the sultan never said how much it cost.
Guesses at the time started at $250 million, but suppliers who know
what went into it _ including 22-carat gold tiles on interior arches
_ say at least $600 million.
   The sultan has two wives. He was married first to Her Majesty the
Raja Isteri Pengiran Anak Saleha and then to Her Royal Highness
Pengiran Isteri Hajjah Mariam. He has three sons and six daughters.
Saleha, the sultan's first cousin, resides in the Nurul Imam.
   Mariam (born Mariam Bell) keeps house in a smaller and newer
palace, Nurulizza, 14 miles from the capital. Their marriage caused
a rift between the sultan and his father, Sir Omar, because she was
a commoner and part Japanese. Japan occupied Brunei during World War
II. The sultan met Mariam when she was a hostess on the Royal Brunei
Airlines.
   The royal family, in power for 29 generations, ensures continued
support for autocracy by providing subsidized food, fuel, housing
and free education and medical care. There is no personal income tax.
   Shortly after independence, Sir Hassanal was quoted as saying his
subjects enjoyed ``a good life. Why should they want more?''
   Bruneians seem content. The happiest probably are the civil
servants, who make up 46 percent of the work force of 85,000. Along
with standard benefits, they get free pensions and interest-free
loans to buy cars and houses.
   Traffic jams are common in Brunei, which has one car for every
2.3 people.
   Prince Mohamed Bolkiah, the foreign minister, told reporters
covering the conference: ``The people seem to be very happy with the
way we are running things. The people accept it.''
   They certainly are spared worries that trouble the foreigners
here assembled. There is no national debt, no trade deficit, no
balance of payments problem and the budget always shows a surplus.
Oil and natural gas account for 99 percent of exports.
   Sir Hassanal was attending Sandhurst Military College in Britain
when his father abdicated in 1967 and he was summoned home at age 21
to take the throne.
   Sultan Omar continued to run things from behind the scenes for
another 15 years, however, and the polo-playing young potentate took
the opportunity to build an international reputation as a playboy.
   Brunei's last flirtation with an elected parliament was in 1962,
when it was still a British protectorate.
   The Parti Rakyat Brunei, since outlawed, won all 16 seats on the
Legislative Council. Sultan Omar refused to convene the council and
an uprising ensued.
   Britain crushed the rebellion and a state of emergency declared
at the time remains in force.

<HEAD>1804 Silver Dollar Auctioned for Record Price of Nearly $1 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An 1804 silver dollar, one of the most prized
coins known to collectors, was sold at auction Friday for $990,000,
the highest amount ever bid for a coin.
   Hugh Sconyers, of the American Rare Coin Fund in Los Angeles,
purchased the 1804 silver dollar for $900,000 and the 10 percent
auction fee at the Auction '89 sale at the Hyatt Regency Chicago.
   He called the purchase a ``cut and dried business decision.''
   ``It's perhaps one of the most famous coins in all of numismatics
and our fund feels that it reprsents a good long-term value,''
Sconyers said after the record purchase.
   The most ever paid for any coin at auction was $725,000 for a
1793 colonial Brasher doubloon in 1979. The current auction record
for a U.S. coin is $625,000, paid in 1982 for an 1870s $5 gold piece.
   The 1804 dollar is one of only 15 U.S. silver dollars bearing
that date, although none actually was minted in 1804.
   During the 1830s, U.S. leaders needed gifts to be given to
foreign governments by ambassadors, so mint workers retrieved an
unused 1803 dollar die and changed the date to 1804. Only 15 such
coins were struck during the next 30 years.
   Seven of the 1804 dollars are in museums and individual
collectors hold the remaining eight.
   The coin sold at auction Friday belonged to Leon Hendrickson,
co-owner of SilverTowne, a rare coin and precious metals dealer in
Winchester, Ind.
   Hendrickson said he bought the coin for $500,000 four years ago
from George Vogt of Houston. ``I bugged him for a few years to sell
it, and he finally did,'' he said.
   ``It's the king of the coins,'' said the 62-year-old Hendrickson,
who began collecting coins during the 1940s. Hendrickson said he
decided to sell the silver dollar after having open-heart surgery
last year.
   ``I'm really going to be sad in lots of ways, glad in other
ways,'' he said. ``I think it's kind of like maybe when you have a
daughter get married, something like that. You're glad and happy and
sad, too, to see them leave home.''

   A suspicious fire broke out briefly Friday night
in the mid-rise office building where a blaze last week killed five
people, but authorities said no serious injuries were reported in
the second fire.
   ``We suspect arson at this time,'' said acting Fire Chief Larry
Mahle, after firefighters extinguished the fire that broke out
shortly before 9 p.m. in a fourth-floor women's rest room. It was
extinguished within five minutes.
   Two maintenance workers who suffered smoke inhalation were taken
to Piedmont Hospital, where they were reported in good condition.
   After Friday night's blaze, Mahle said, an arson investigator
took samples of a couch where the second fire apparently started.
   The building had been reopened to the public only hours earlier,
at 2:30 p.m., Mahle said, and only six maintenance workers were
inside when the fire began.
   On June 30, more than 30 people were injured after a fire broke
out on the fourth floor. Four people died of smoke inhalation in
that blaze, apparently triggered by an explosion that killed an
electrician changing a fuse.

   Communist officials dealt a parting blow
to longtime Hungarian leader Janos Kadar hours after his death by
saying political changes had passed him by.
   Kadar, who died Thursday at age 77, came to power as Soviet
troops crushed the 1956 anti-Stalinist uprising. He oversaw early
stirrings of economic and political reform but lost power last year
to enthusiasts of quicker change.
   In remembering his life, the party leadership, in a statement
carried Thursday by state media, said Kadar had led the way to
national consensus and always aimed at a ``humanist socialism.''
   However, it said that ``time and the (communist) Hungarian
Socialist Workers Party have surpassed the life work of Kadar, the
politician. In the spirit of his heritage demanding justice, we must
declare this painful fact.''

   President Bush is rejecting Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's latest proposal for reducing nuclear arsenals
in Europe, saying he doesn't ``want to get off track'' and challenge
hard-won NATO unity.
   Bush says he will stand by a NATO plan, which he orchestrated,
that calls for conventional troop reductions first. Talks with the
Soviets on cutting short-range nuclear warheads would come later,
under the formula endorsed by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
in May.
   As he prepared for next week's trip to Europe, the president told
reporters on Thursday he was not concerned with the Soviet leader's
popularity in Europe, declaring: ``We're not going to get into the
international poll business.''
   Meanwhile, The Washington Post reported today that Bush has
decided to propose a 25 percent pay increases for top career
government employees, with as much as a tripling for a small number
of key specialists. He has endorsed a similar raise for federal
judges.

   Housing Secretary Jack Kemp is suspending a
program designed to provide apartments for low- and moderate-income
elderly people, the third program canceled or frozen at the
Department of Housing and Urban Development.
   Kemp's decision Thursday follows a highly critical audit of the
program by HUD's inspector general that said many of the projects
were approved despite warnings by agency analysts that they were
unnecessary or too large.
   The program already has cost the government $119 million in
direct payments to cover defaults on HUD-insured mortgages, Kemp
said. The cost is likely to grow, he said, because defaults now
total $250 million and are expected to continue.
   Kemp also said the program was not serving those it was created
to help, citing a HUD-backed project in Palm Harbor, Fla., that he
said charged $2,100 a month rent for a two-bedroom apartment.

   Prosecutors are considering possible
criminal action in the loss of $2 million of federal housing funds
in Alabama that apparently were used to buy luxury items such as a
Mercedes, a speedboat, jewelry and furs.
   Department of Housing and Urban Development documents obtained by
The Associated Press allege that Montgomery real estate broker Cy
Walker spent the money over a three-year period by using a stack of
blank wire transfer authorization forms.
   HUD's Birmingham office, without a system to double-check on the
receipt of funds from HUD closings, thought the $2 million from 63
sales closings went to its central office account, according to
agency records. In fact, the money was in a First Alabama Bank
account controlled solely by Walker, according to a HUD audit.
   Housing officials in Alabama tightened controls over HUD money on
Nov. 9, 1987, after they discovered the money was missing. That same
day Walker closed out the First Alabama account, withdrawing the
last $136.54.

   About 60 million Americans 20 and older _ more
than one-third of the nation's adults _ face the risk of coronary
disease because they have high blood cholesterol levels, a study has
found.
   ``What's especially disconcerting is that high cholesterol levels
are often seen in association with other risk factors _
hypertension, smoking, or being overweight,'' says Christopher
Sempos, one of eight authors of the study published in today's
Journal of the American Medical Association.
   ``And for many people, most of the desired changes could be
achieved through a change in routines like diet and exercise,''
Sempos, a nutritionist and epidemiologist with the National Center
for Health Statistics in Hyattsville, Md., said in a telephone
interview Thursday.
   ``Even though we've made great strides in alerting the public to
the dangers of cholesterol and heart disease, there's still too
large a segment that is putting itself unnecessarily at risk.''

   The Rev. George A. Stallings hates the sight of
empty pews, and that's one reason he wants the Roman Catholic Church
to allow a special rite for black Americans.
   But a black bishop contends that Stallings, suspended as a priest
for creating an unauthorized parish in Washington, could wind up
with a church that is no different from any other evangelical
congregation competing for members and dollars.
   Stallings, who is black, said in an interview Thursday that the
Catholic church is missing the boat in attracting blacks and other
minorities because its hierarchy and traditions are too bound by
European culture and dominated by white males.
   It fails to evangelize _ make converts _ among blacks because it
doesn't train anyone to do so, he said, adding that other religions
are filling the gap.

   The Security Council passed a resolution
that said it ``deeply regrets'' Israel's continued expulsions of
Palestinians from the occupied lands, but the United States in a
mild rebuke abstained from the vote.
   By a 14-0 vote on Thursday, the 15-nation council adopted the
resolution, which cited the deportations last month of eight
Palestinians.
   ``This proves once again the irrelevance of the whole
institution,'' Ambassador Johanan Bein of Israel said after the
meeting. ``On the day of a major terrorist attack, in which 14
people are dead and 27 wounded, the Security Council finds fit to
deal with expulsions.''
   He was referring to an attack in which a Palestinian shouting
``God is great!'' seized the steering wheel of an Israeli bus on the
highway outside Jerusalem and caused it to veer into a ravine where
it exploded in flames.

   The vast majority of assault weapons barred
from importation since spring will be banned permanently from this
country, the government announced Friday.
   The ban imposed on 43 styles of semiautomatic weapons _ including
the popular Chinese-made AK-47 and Israeli-made Uzi carbine _
followed a four-month study by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms on whether the weapons met the standards imposed by the Gun
Control Act of 1968, which barred importation of weapons that are
not used for legitimate sporting purposes.
   ``The study was undertaken because of the dramatic increase in
the number of these weapons being imported and police reports of
their use in violent crime,'' said Stephen E. Higgins, director of
the ATF bureau.
   While the 43 were banned permanently, another seven whose imports
had been suspended since early spring will be available for import
again as a result of the study. Those include six .22 rimfire
caliber rifles and a gun called the Valmet Hunter, which had been
considered an AK-47 type of weapon during the suspension.

   HUD Secretary Jack Kemp on Friday blamed his
Reagan administration predecessor, Samuel Pierce, for a burgeoning
agency scandal and hinted he might suspend additional programs as
part of a cleansing effort.
   Kemp made his comments as the White House said a budget aide
under congressional scrutiny has been ordered to avoid any HUD
matters under investigation. Janet Hale, a specialist at the Office
of Management and Budget, spent five years at the Department of
Housing and Urban Development and approved agency financing of a
project involving a longtime friend of Pierce.
   Kemp's comments were his most direct to date in appraising the
difficulties he inherited when he became housing secretary earlier
this year.
   ``I'm making a lot of changes, so that, by definition, is
suggesting that Secretary Pierce unfortunately _ a very decent and
honest man _ did not in my view manage HUD as carefully or closely
as it should have been managed,'' he told reporters after speaking
to a Republican group.
   ``That reflects on Mr. Pierce and, I say this with sadness not
anger, it reflects on the Reagan administration,'' Kemp said. He and
President Bush will be to blame, Kemp said, if they are unsuccessful
in reforming the agency, a huge task that now involves major
internal reviews of virtually all of the agency's major programs.

   President Bush asked Congress Friday to give
7,900 federal executives pay raises of 8 percent to 25 percent, but
said the officials should prove their worth every three years or
forfeit the increase.
   Bush also proposed a ban on congressional honoraria, such as
outside speaking fees, after 18 months to open the way for a pay
hike for members of Congress. He stopped short of actually proposing
a salary increase for them but promised in a letter to House and
Senate leaders to ``work with Congress toward this end.''
   ``He told the Congress early on that he would be supportive of a
congressional pay raise, but that's a matter he would like to work
out with them. They are of the same attitude,'' said presidential
press secretary Marlin Fitzwater.
   Bush earlier this year gave his support to a proposed 51 percent
pay raise for members of Congress endorsed by the Reagan
administration, but the plan was rejected in Congress after a public
outcry arose.

<HEAD>Lameduck Pinochet Trying to Build Power Base in Chile</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEVIN NOBLET</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gen. Augusto Pinochet is using his
lame-duck presidency to make influential political and judicial
appointments expected to endure long after a civilian successor is
elected in December.
   Opposition politicians and jurists expect Pinochet's apparent
efforts to build a lasting base of power for the future will largely
fail, but they concede that, with the 60,000-man army behind him,
the right-wing general could yet pose a formidible obstacle to the
transition to civilian government.
   Pinochet has said he won't be a candidate in the election but
plans to remain army commander after he gives up the presidency he
seized in the 1973 coup that overthrew Salvador Allende, a Marxist.
Under a constitution his adminstration crafted, Pinochet and the
chiefs of the other armed forces are legally entitled to their
commands until 1998.
   Pinochet recently said he does not plan to be subordinate to the
new civilian president and speaks of ``a kind of co-habitation''
with him.
   In an evident bid to preserve enough influence for such a
relationship, however, his administration has begun renewing its
appointments of loyal followers at the local and national level,
from town halls to the Supreme Court. Once designated, they cannot
easily be replaced even after the change of government.
   The renewal began within weeks of Pinochet's resounding
referendum defeat in October, when voters rejected a military
proposal that he remain president until 1997. The loss obliged
Pinochet to schedule presidential and congressional elections for
Dec. 14. The new government begins a four-year term on March 11.
   One of Pinochet's most powerful aides, Gen. Patricio Serre, the
subsecretary for regional development, has been overseeing the
sytematic replacement of 319 apppointed mayors nationwide. Their
terms are for four years, and they will wield extensive powers of
patronage and local spending.
   Many of those being replaced, including some retired military
officers, have announced plans to run for Congress as a kind of
pro-Pinochet bloc.
   In an effort to revamp the 17-man Supreme Court, the government
recently made a unique 90-day offer to 10 justices more than 75
years old of special pension benefits the equivalent of $53,000 in a
windfall payout each, to be added to regular monthly pension of
about $900. It is an extraordinary sum by Chilean standards.
   The 10 justices face automatic retirement when the new government
comes in. To get the pension they have to step down by
mid-September, which would give Pinochet's adminstration time to
appoint successors.
   Justices serve five-year terms and have authority that extends
far beyond simple questions of law. The court, for example,
designates three members of a seven-member Constitutional Tribunal
that has final word on constitutional questions and four of the
national election board's five members. The Supreme Court president
is one of the influential National Security Council's eight members.
   The government also has accelerated its program for privatizing
many of the industries that remain in state hands and plans a law
that will make the Central Bank largely autonomous, with the new
president unable to replace its director and other key officers.
Critics have denounced the measure as a bid to deprive the new
government of control over economic policy.
   Nonetheless, the opposition contends that Pinochet's efforts will
sink in a sea of political change after the election. They point to
opinion polls indicating that presidential candidate Patricio
Aylwin, a Christian Democrat backed by a united center-left
opposition, has a nearly insurmountable lead.
   Jorge Schaulsohn, a leader of the left-of-center Party for
Democracy, said in an interview, he expected the last-minute
appointees to shift sympathies, or at least show themselves to be
flexible, when the new government takes over.
   ``In a democratic environment, it doesn't matter who appointed
you,'' he said. ``I'm sure you'll be smart enough to understand that
you have to adapt to what the country wants. This happens
everywhere.''
   In addition, Aylwin has said his priority will be a plan to
``democratize'' the country's municipal system and hold elections to
replace appointed mayors.
   Schaulsohn acknowledged, however, that Pinochet's grip on the
army commander's post ``poses a danger.'' He said the opposition
planned a campaign to persuade the armed forces that it was not in
their or the country's interests to have Pinochet remain army chief.
   Schaulsohn said he suspected Pinochet ``is trying to negotiate
some kind of immunity'' for himself and his troops, some of whom are
accused of human rights violations including illegal arrest, torture
and execution.
   Francisco Cumplido, a constitutional expert and member of the
Christian Democratic Party, said human rights would be one of the
thorniest issues in the transition.
   More than 700 people disappeared and thousands were arrested,
tortured or sent into exile in a wave of anti-leftist repression
after the 1973 coup. In recent years, atrocities have declined
significantly but some repression of dissidents continues, human
rights groups say.
   Pinochet recently said he was considering a general amnesty for
security forces members who might face prosecution in ``little
cases'' of human rights abuse.

   $85 Toll Too Much for Users of Japan's New Inland Sea Bridge
</TEXT>

<TEXT>
   Japan built a high-technology wonder of a
bridge to bring a small island into the modern era, but local
residents and industries say they can't afford its $85 round-trip
toll.
   The six-mile Seto Inland Sea Bridge, which opened a year ago to
connect Japan's Honshu Island with Shikoku Island, was the final
ground link in a long-held dream to connect Japan's four main
islands.
   But the $85 toll, set to offset the $7.79 billion cost of the
bridge, doesn't entice many motorists or truckers.
   Excitement and local pride built to a fever pitch at the opening
of the bridge in April 1988, because it meant Shikoku's 4.2 million
people would have a link to Honshu, Japan's largest island.
   During 10 years of construction, they viewed the double-tiered
network of six bridges and connecting viaducts as a rite of passage
into Japan's modern era.
   Residents on both sides of the Seto Inland Sea believe, however,
the bridge has given the region a psychological boost.
   ``Before the bridge, the Seto Inland Sea divided the cultures of
the islands, and isolated Shikoku,'' said Teruo Hamaie, a newscaster
on the TV network RSK in Okayama, a city of 600,000 people on
Honshu. ``But now the two peoples feel integrated.''
   While the bridge has increased tourism _ it has become a
curiosity _ it has brought little concrete benefit to Shikoku's
industrial quarter.
   Local fisheries and produce growers looked forward to the bridge
because it would mean they no longer would have to rely on ferry
boats, often subject to the area's unpredictable weather, for
deliveries.
   But they say their delivery trucks continue to use the ferries.
   Although ferry tolls are also high _ about $95 one way for the
90-mile trip from Shikoku to the port of Kobe _ regular users get up
to 40 percent discounts, and save on the bridge toll, gasoline, and
tolls for new highways on the Honshu side of the bridge.
   The companies say they save money by transporting their goods by
sea as far as possible, and their drivers get a chance to rest.
   Katsushige Matsuda, manager of the Kagawa Fishery Cooperatives,
said that on bad days, his trucks will wait for hours for fog to
lift rather than use the bridge. When Shikoku's new Takamatsu
airport is completed this year, the cooperative will invest in air
delivery service rather than use the bridge.
   ``We can't say that the bridge has had any merit for the fishing
industry,'' Matsuda said.
   The high bridge toll also has kept regular motorists off the
bridge as well.
   Less than half the expected daily traffic was recorded in the
first year of the bridge's operation. An average of 10,800 vehicles
crossed every day, and projected revenues fell short by $137 million.
   But railway traffic during the period was higher than expected.
For about $2.70 a ticket, about 30,000 passengers rode the Japan
Railways trains that speed across the bridge's lower deck 144 times
a day in both directions.
   The area's tourist industry has benefited from the bridge,
however. More than twice as many tourists as in 1987 flocked to
Shikoku's Kagawa Prefecture last year, most of them drawn by the
bridge itself. In the process, they booked 5,000 more hotel rooms
than the year before and consumed thousands of tons of udon noodles,
a local specialty.
   In the town of Sakaide on Shikoku, a 520-foot tower for viewing
the Seto Inland Sea and the bridge was built for the new flow of
tourists.
   Across the island-studded sea in Okayama Prefecture, a major
tourism makeover is taking shape. The city of Uno, a
down-at-the-heel port since the decline of Japan's shipbuilding
industry, is the site of a $137 million ``Spanish Village,'' a vast
amusement and marine park to open in 1992.
   ``Century Park Tivoli,'' a $343.5 million amusement center based
on one in Copenhagen, Denmark, is expected to open in 1994.
   ``These projects wouldn't have come to this region without the
interest generated by the bridge,'' said Douglas Smith, an American
who is the coordinator of international relations in Okayama's
commerce and industry department.
   ``There is a sense that 1988 wasn't the big year in Okayama, that
there is more to come.''

   Young descendants of immigrants
who crossed the Atlantic in years past to work in the fields and
factories of Argentina are taking the journey in reverse nowadays as
the nation sinks deep into recession.
   ``This is my home and I hope to return to it and live and die
here, but not if it means starving to death because I don't have any
work,'' Aldo Bignone, a 23-year-old auto mechanic, said as he stood
outside the Spanish Consulate to apply for a visa.
   Rodrigo Imas, a 30-year-old print shop employee, said his
grandfather told him many times about the four-week trip he made
from Italy in the hold of a freighter to start a new life in
Argentina.
   ``Now I'm hoping to find enough money to buy a one-way ticket on
Aerolineas Argentinas,'' Imas said. ``The transportation has changed
and the direction is reversed, but the idea is the same.''
   As inflation and interest rates have soared out of control and
the austral currency falls to a tiny fraction of its worth just five
months ago, businesses have closed by the score and thousands of
workers have been laid off.
   Argentines who consider themselves lucky just to have jobs have
watched in dismay as food, gasoline, cigarettes, movie tickets and
virtually everything else have shot up in price, while wages in real
terms have shrunk.
   Argentines have left for years for a variety of reasons. A decade
ago, it was to escape the violence of left-wing subversion followed
by a brutal crackdown that began with a military coup in March 1976.
   For the past several years, Argentines have left in search of
economic opportunity, however, and visa applications have
accelerated as the economy has deteriorated in recent months.
   With the austral trading at about 590 to the dollar, a teacher
who earned $100 a month at the end of 1988 now might be earning a
little as $40; a newspaper reporter who earned $300 now earns $90; a
bilingual marketing administrator could well have seen his pay fall
from $300 to $135 and a bank economist from $700 to $300.
   ``A lot of people are thinking that their children have limited
futures,'' said the Canadian consul, Andree Bazinet. ``They get all
these skills at the university and can't use them in Argentina. We
get some of our highest quality acceptances from Argentina.''
   In 1986, the Canadian Embassy received 188 applications for
immigrant visas and in the first five months of this year,
applications stood at 1,292. Only 275 were issued.
   The Argentine government issues no figures on the number or job
skills of emigrants, but officials at variousd consulates said visa
applications are way up, and usually it's the best educated and best
trained who are taken.
   The longest lines are outside the consulates of Spain and Italy,
the countries to which a majority of Argentines trace their roots.
Italy generally offers visas to grandchildren of its emigrants and
Spain to children of people born in those countries who never
renounced their citizenship.
   Those visas are coveted because they will allow Argentines to
work thoughout Western Europe beginning in 1992, when the European
Economic Community is unified into a single market.
   Australia granted about 480 immigrant visas in 1986 and 1987, the
consulate said, and inquiries for the nine-month period that ended
in March skyrocketed to 16,330. It gave no figures on the number of
visas to be granted.
   Daniel Fainstein, dean of the Latin American Rabbinic Seminary,
estimated that 2,000 Jews left Argentina last year for Israel.
``There has been an increase ... because of the permanent
instability and insecurity here,'' he said.
   The United States issued 1,450 to 1,500 immigrant visas to
Argentines in the past few years, a consular officer said. The
number of applications is not kept, but it clearly exceeds the
number of acceptances and probably has increased in recent months,
the official added.
   Standing in line at the U.S. Consulate, Jose Ponti said he hopes
to move to Baltimore, Md., to work in his uncle's clothing store.
   ``My family split in two after World War II,'' said Ponti, 27,
who works on the Buenos Aires subway. ``One part went to the U.S.,
another part came here to Argentina. The American side of the family
is doing very well.''

<HEAD>A Million Memories for Parents of Chappaquiddick Victim</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE ESPER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Time has neither diminished the pain nor dimmed the memories of
Gwen and Joe Kopechne after two decades of mourning their only child.
   ``Oh, God, there are a million of them,'' said Mrs. Kopechne of
her daughter, Mary Jo, who died 20 years ago when a car driven by
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy plunged off a narrow bridge on Chappaquiddick
Island next to Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts.
   ``There's so darn many things,'' she said. ``We was three people
together all the time. And even her being away from home, we were
closely in touch. Our whole life is wrapped around our kid.''
   Their memories of Mary Jo are never more vivid than on the
anniversary of the accident each July 18. All these many years
later, they are still reeling through uncertainty and anxiety amidst
renewed charges of a cover-up to save Kennedy's political career.
   Mary Jo's portrait, a gift to her from a boyfriend of long ago,
stares down at them from a wall in the living room, a haunting
reminder that she died a week before her 29th birthday.
   Autographed photos of Kennedy's brothers, President John F.
Kennedy and Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, stand side by side
in the sitting room, another journey back to a time when Mary Jo
worked in their presidential campaigns. Indeed, that is what had
taken her to Chappaquiddick that July weekend, a cookout and reunion
for a dozen men and women who had worked in Robert's 1968 campaign.
   ``Everything we look at reminds us of our daughter,'' Mrs.
Kopechne said in a telephone interview from her home in the Pocono
Mountains of Pennsylvania. ``There are a lot of knickknacks around
of hers. We never put anything of hers away.''
   There are no photos of Edward Kennedy. ``Absolutely not,'' said
Mary Jo's father. Asked if he was bitter toward Kennedy, he
answered, ``Yes and no,'' then paused. ``No, I don't want to answer
anything like that.''
   ``I wouldn't go out of my way to be friendly,'' said Mrs.
Kopechne. ``He doesn't mean anything to me.''
   She said she could not remember the last time she talked to
Kennedy. ``Maybe it was when he was running for the (1980
presidential) nomination.''
   The years have taken a physical toll on the Kopechnes, and the
20th anniversary of the tragedy promises to be emotional. Just the
other day, Mrs. Kopechne, 71, had to go to the doctor.
   ``The stress is getting too much for me,'' she said. ``I'm
falling apart. I don't want to talk. I get too upset just having to
talk about it constantly. We've been bothered with people on the
property. They've been knocking on our bedroom door. We don't answer
the door. We didn't answer the phone for a couple of weeks, but
that's ridiculous that we can't even answer our own phone.''
   Mrs. Kopechne had surgery for suspected cancer last January.
``They found no cancer,'' she said. ``I came out clean, but this is
what they watch with me now.''
   Kopechne, 76, underwent cancer surgery 12 years ago, about the
same time he retired as an insurance salesman. ``I lost half my
stomach, my spleen, my gallbladder, part of my pancreas, but hell,
it didn't make any difference to me. I'm still going better than I
ever did.''
   He plays tennis three or four times a week and occasionally he
volunteers his help to Meals on Wheels, delivering food to the
elderly. He is an avid reader with particular interest in nutrition.
   ``I follow my nutritional value,'' he said. ``That's what's
keeping me going. There are proper foods and the proper way of
looking at things. Your outlook on life. That means a hell of a
lot.''
   The Kopechnes declined to talk much about Kennedy, but Mrs.
Kopechne said she was glad the foreman in the grand jury
investigation of Mary Jo's death recently renewed allegations that
officials tried to cover up information to protect Kennedy.
   Several members of the same grand jury also asserted a district
attorney prevented the jury from calling several key witnesses,
including Kennedy and his cousin, Joseph Gargan Jr., because they
had testified previously at an inquest.
   ``I'm glad to see somebody else coming along,'' she said.
``There's where the answers are, partly up there. We don't know
anything. We wait to hear from somebody else. We're glad to hear
somebody else has come out and said something.''
   Kennedy, who waited 10 hours before notifying authorities of the
accident, has taken full responsibility and expressed remorse for
the tragedy over the years, most recently in a prepared statement
issued shortly before the anniversary.
   ``There was a full and complete investigation by authorities, and
there have been extensive additional investigations by the press,''
he said. ``I have expressed my remorse and reponsibility to my own
family, to the Kopechne family, and to the people of Massachusetts,
and I express those sentiments again. I have told everything I know
about the accident.''
   ``He hasn't said anything he hasn't said before,'' said Mrs.
Kopechne. ``I think there's a lot can be said that wasn't said.''
   Thirteen years ago, the Kopechnes moved from Berkeley Heights,
N.J., back to Joe's native Pennsylvania, buying a brick ranch home
in Swiftwater, Pa., 120 miles from Philadelphia. They paid for it
with a $140,904 settlement they received from Kennedy and his
insurance company.
   ``We wanted to be in between our friends in New Jersey and
Pennsylvania,'' Kopechne said.
   They are closer to Mary Jo now, only 50 miles away, an hour and
20 minute drive. She is buried halfway up a mountain near a church
they once attended a few miles from Forty Fort, a town of 5,500
people where Kopechne grew up. They visit Mary Jo's grave about once
a month, never letting her memory fade.
   ``You wouldn't either if you had a daughter like her,'' said
Kopechne.

   Samuel F. Pickering Jr. is not above telling
a lie to make a good story better, and he encourages the students in
his writing course to do the same.
   ``You've got to lie to give the illusion of truth,'' the English
professor tells his students at the University of Connecticut.
   Given that philosophy, it's not surprising that Pickering finds
himself caught up in the excitement over a bit of fiction written by
a former student. The teacher John Keating, played by Robin Williams
in the movie ``Dead Poets Society,'' is modeled after Pickering.
   Like Keating, Pickering has been known to do the unusual in his
classroom. He's lectured from a desktop, from outside a window or
while wearing wastepaper baskets on his feet. He also returned to
his prep school as a young teacher after studying in England. But
unlike the movie, there was never any conflict between Pickering and
school administrators, and he left the school on good terms.
   ``Whatever of me is in that character has got to be small,'' the
47-year-old Pickering said during recent interview at his home. ``I
was a kid and he was a child. Twenty-three years ago. How much of me
could there be in the movie? Not very much.''
   The screenplay was written by Tom Schulman, who was a 15-year-old
student at Montgomery Bell Academy in Nashville, Tenn., when he took
a course from Pickering. Pickering, who had returned to the United
States after a year of study at Cambridge University, taught at the
private school for just one year, 1965-66.
   Schulman has acknowledged Pickering's influence on his life and
the screenplay, and has said much of his love for language and
literature originated in that course.
   Pickering hasn't seen the movie _ his three children were sick
and now he's in Canada for the summer. But many of his friends in
Nashville have seen the film, and they immediately recognized
Pickering as the inspiration for the movie's teacher. The friends
began talking and soon the news media picked up on the subject.
   ``I don't mind being the center of attention if I can control it,
but I can't control this,'' he said of the numerous inquiries he's
received from reporters and acquaintances.
   Pickering, who was born and raised in Nashville, is puzzled as to
why he had so much influence on a former student and how it was that
his friends so readily saw him in the movie. He's also flattered.
   ``I'm the most ordinary guy in the world,'' he said as he draped
his leg over the arm of a chair and picked at a hole in the knee of
his jeans. ``Sometimes people remember me, and I don't know why. I
don't know if I did anything special then as a teacher. I was young
and lively.''
   What he does in class is unplanned, he said. He does many unusual
things to get his students to think for themselves, but a bad back
has forced him to abandon such acrobatics as desktop lectures. His
classroom is also on the second floor now, making the leaps from
windows unwise.
   ``Sometimes you get bored in the classroom,'' he said. ``This
semester when my class was over, the last class, two girls in my
class jumped up and gave an imitation of me right in front of the
class. They got A's. You'd think they might get F's, but I've
learned since.''
   Pickering bursts into laughter after telling the story. He laughs
often and easily as he recalls the past. He finds many things
humorous in life and often downplays his own accomplishments.
   Since leaving Montgomery Bell Academy, he has completed a
doctorate and taught in Syria and Jordon and at Dartmouth College.
He's been at the University of Connecticut since 1978, where in
addition to teaching, he's become well-known as an essayist.
   He writes about his three children, his wife, his mother and
father and ordinary things in life. His writing, as might be
expected, is humorous and self-critical, but also bawdy and
philosophical. He has published three books of his essays and is
working on a fourth. He plans to write an essay on the celebrity
that has come to him in the wake of ``Dead Poets Society.''
   His most recent book, ``May Days'' (University of Iowa, 1988),
includes an essay on Montgomery Bell Academy. It pokes fun at the
idea of a ``Southern gentleman'' and Pickering's exploits as a
student, athlete and practical joker.
   From these experiences, Pickering has shaped a teaching
philosophy that has in turn influenced many others.
   ``There are very few givens that I accept. I don't reject any
either. But I think that kids ought to start looking,'' Pickering
said. ``When somebody says it's green, then you should turn around
and say maybe it's not green. What's the truth? That's all I do.''

   With their first album of new material in nine
years zooming up the charts, the original members of the Doobie
Brothers band are taking it to the streets. But they're taking it
easier between shows.
   ``I think everybody's just wanting to take care of themselves a
little better than they used to,'' lead singer Tom Johnston said in
a recent interview during a two-day stop in the Detroit area.
   ``Consequently, everybody's a little quieter when they go back to
their room than they used to be. They don't stay out all night
boogying.''
   Added drummer John Hartman, 70 pounds lighter than the last time
he did any intense touring, ``The road treats us the same, we just
don't treat it the same.''
   These Doobies made up the earliest version of the band, the
guitar-based act with a hard rock style that recorded such hits as
``China Grove,'' ``Listen to the Music,'' ``Jesus Is Just Alright''
and ``Black Water.''
   The new album, ``Cycles,'' already has gone gold _ more than
500,000 copies sold within two weeks of release. It means there will
be at least one more Doobies album. Johnston says he has six or
seven songs waiting at home, including one yanked from ``Cycles'' at
the last minute.
   The first single from the album, ``The Doctor,'' was at No. 11 on
the Billboard charts as of June 30. Its sound, most often compared
with ``China Grove,'' should be no surprise, Hartman said.
   ``You come out with a new album. You're supposed to sound like,
what, Montovanni?'' Hartman asked sarcastically. ``You've got the
same guys who wrote the same hits back in the early days. What's
(Johnston) supposed to sound like? Elvis?''
   Johnston, Hartman, guitarist Patrick Simmons, bassist Tiran
Porter, drummer Michael Hossack and percussionist Bobby LaKind make
up this version of the band, whose evolution requires a scorecard.
   There were 14 Doobies _ none of them related _ from 1972 to 1982.
The Johnston-led band gave way to the slicker, rhythm and blues
version fronted by Michael McDonald in the late '70s that scored the
hits ``Takin' It to the Streets,'' ``What a Fool Believes,'' which
was named record of the year at the Grammy Awards in 1979, and the
Grammy winning-album ``Minute by Minute.''
   A 1987 reunion concert for Vietnam veterans brought a dozen
Doobies together. It led to a mini-tour and a Fourth of July concert
in Moscow. After that, the musicians went their separate ways.
   Producer Ted Templeman, who was with the band through all its
changes, talked to Johnston and the original Doobies about getting
back together for a new album.
   ``We were all playing in bands around the bay area and recording
and doing stuff; it just wasn't on a very big scale,'' Johnston
said. ``Basically, it was like starting all over again. We all knew
each other. The music, it's all new tunes. That's why the album was
called `Cycles,' because we've been through a lot of cycles, mostly
the spin cycle.''
   The success of ``Cycles'' never was guaranteed, but air play of
``The Doctor,'' coupled with classic rock radio play of oldies, has
created a new generation of Doobie fans.
   ``Kids from 17 on up have been showing up at the concerts as well
as people who knew us from before,'' Johnston said. ``I think they
find it interesting to go back and listen to the '70s-type stuff as
well as what we've doing on the new album.''
   Success still is welcome to a band _ even after it has sold 80
million albums.
   ``I knew a lot of people wanted to hear rock 'n' roll Doobie
Brothers and stuff,'' said Johnston. ``We didn't try to make this
album sound like 1974. We tried to make it sound like the songs we
had written.''
   This time out, the Doobies are playing 12 to 14 concerts, then
laying off for 10 days before beginning another round. There are 65
concerts planned on the ``Cycles'' tour.
   ``We used to do 200-plus gigs a year, and when we weren't
gigging, we were in the studio, so you never saw home and you never
really got rested up,'' Johnston said. ``I don't want to go out for
that many dates a year anymore anyway. It's crazy. And I don't think
you need to. I don't think we needed to back then either.''
   These days, family members travel occasionally with the band
members. Hartman, whose family prefers to stay behind, gets out to
museums, parks and shopping malls. Johnston and others read novels.
   ``We're not trashing hotel rooms anymore and we're not having
door wars with rent-a-cars, burning up stages and things of that
nature.'' Johnston said. ``Everybody's become a little bit more
selective, especially being married, they don't mess around.''

<HEAD>Recession Coming _ Or Already Here?</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Also on financial wires.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Forget for a moment, if you will, the months-old
debate on Wall Street over whether the economy is headed for a
recession.
   Consider instead the possibility that such a slump might already
have begun.
   This is by no means a majority view, or even suspicion, among the
economists of the financial world. Many economists still argue that
the recent slowing of the economy will bottom out with nothing worse
than a spell of sluggish growth.
   Once that happy news is established, they contend, the rallying
cry will be ``Onward and upward!'' for both the stock market and the
producing and consuming economy.
   Nevertheless, some observers say, if a recession is destined to
occur, it would be very much in keeping with past patterns if it
were to sneak in unnoticed and take a firm hold several months
before its presence is officially detected.
   Such a sneak-attack effect can be enhanced by the
much-publicized, but still easily overlooked, lag time between
economic events and the reporting of data used to measure them.
   The statistics that lately have heightened recession worries have
covered May and June, the latter stages of the second quarter of
1989. But even as investors react to them, the third quarter is well
under way.
   The formal definition of recession, as established by the
National Bureau of Economic Research, is at least two consecutive
quarters of declines in the gross national product, after adjustment
for inflation.
   If that kind of an event were to occur in the third and fourth
quarters of this year, it wouldn't be certified as such until early
1990.
   Of course, the government and private economists employ other
tools to try to get a more up-to-date reading of where things are
headed.
   One of these, the Commerce Department's index of leading economic
indicators, dropped 1.2 percent in May for its third decline in four
months _ bordering on the traditional standard that recognizes three
down months in a row as a recession warning.
   ``We've never been much of a fan of this index as a gauge to
future economic growth,'' said David Resler, economist at Nomura
Securities International in New York. ``But this latest report had
an ominous quality to it.''
   Given the leading indicators' spotty record in the past, many
private analysts have their own favorite statistical barometers.
   Subscribers to the doctrine known as monetarism, for instance,
argue that slow or no growth in the money supply has already sounded
a clear signal of trouble ahead.
   Others cite the ``inverted yield curve'' _ with short-term
interest rates higher than long-term interest rates _ that has
prevailed for much of this year as a likely portent of stormy
weather.
   No matter how many forecasting aids are available, though, it
seems evident that the ``soft landing'' vs. recession argument on
Wall Street won't be settled until some months after the fact.
   All the reports since early this year showing a slowing of
economic growth ``are also the way that recessions come about,''
observed Raymond F. DeVoe Jr., an analyst at Legg Mason Wood Walker
Inc.
   ``If continued as they're now tracking,'' DeVoe added, ``they
would indicate the growing likelihood of a recession _ if the
economy is not already in one.''

<HEAD>Compulsive Gambling Ruins Millions of Lives, May Increase, Experts
Say</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Also on sports wires.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   While Pete Rose's betting makes headlines,
millions of less prominent lives are afflicted by an addiction to
gambling that some experts fear may become more widespread.
   ``We are viewing compulsive gambling as the mental health
epidemic of the 1990s,'' declares Valerie Lorenz, executive director
of the National Center for Pathological Gambling in Baltimore.
   Adds Sirgay Sanger, president of the National Council on
Compulsive Gambling in New York, ``I think we're possibly headed
into a decade in which gambling will be the addiction of choice''
among young people.
   It may be seen as a readily available and attractive alternative
if alcohol and drugs become less popular, he says.
   Almost $253 billion was bet in the United States last year,
legally and illegally, according to the magazine Gaming and Wagering
Business. Tables games such as roulette and baccarat drew $126
billion, and slot machines about $37 billion. Lotteries and
parimutuel events such as horse racing each took in more than $17
billion, the magazine says.
   The vast majority of gamblers are not addicted to betting. But
perhaps 3 percent of American adults, which comes to about 5 million
people, are hooked. So are a significant percentage of high school
students, some studies suggest.
   Fifteen years ago, the compulsive gambler was typically a
middle-age white businessman, Lorenz said, but now treatment
programs see people in their teens and early 20s, deeply in debt,
suicidal and threatened by bookies.
   She said she expects compulsive gambling to grow as more states
adopt lotteries and other games of chance to raise revenue,
promoting the idea of gambling and making it easier for susceptible
people to become hooked.
   Already, ``we are seeing an increase in all forms of gambling,''
said Lorenz. Some 15 percent of calls to her organization's hotline
are from people who say they are hooked on lotteries, she said,
while ``six years ago I never heard of a lottery addict.''
   But J. Blaine Lewis Jr., president of the North American
Association of State and Provincial Lotteries, said experts have
told him that lotteries do not interest most compulsive gamblers.
The addicts want faster action, such as casino games, and games of
perceived skill rather than pure chance, Lewis said.
   While lotteries may promote the idea of gambling, ``it's a long
step to say then that that gets people to be compulsive gamblers,''
Lewis said.
   Rose's situation does not directly involve the question of
whether he is a compulsive gambler, and Lorenz and Sanger said they
could not make a diagnosis from news stories.
   But Lorenz said Rose shows some traits consistently found in
compulsive gamblers: competitiveness, intelligence, ability with
numbers, athletic ability and a high energy level. And his denials
of improper betting ``in the face of overwhelming evidence'' suggest
the reaction of a compulsive gambler, she said.
   People who buy a lottery ticket every day or bet substantial sums
are not necessarily compulsive gamblers. The addiction involves a
collection of other specific behaviors.
   For example, compulsive gamblers may continue betting despite
mounting debts, the disintegration of life at home and on the job,
and their own efforts to stop.
   They may have to bet more and more in order to feel the
excitement they crave. They may frequently gamble more money or for
a longer time than planned, and may repeatedly try to win back
losses.
   The goal is not to gain money, but to gamble. They may bet on a
sure loser, or on both sides of a contest, just to stay in the
action.
   For these people, gambling is a way to feel alive, to feel
powerful in a generally powerless life, to feel accepted, to feel
special.
   But when compulsive gamblers hit bottom, they often are in debt
for one or two times their annual salaries, Lorenz said. Many will
have turned to writing bad checks, forgery or embezzlement to fuel
their habit.
   About one in five who enter Gamblers Anonymous or treatment
programs has tried suicide, studies suggest.
   What kinds of people become compulsive gamblers?
   ``Young and old, rich and poor, black and white, all
socio-economic levels, all educational levels,'' Lorenz said.
   Many excelled in athletics in high school and college, she said,
and her organization's hotline gets an occasional call from
professional athletes who fear that if they seek help, they will be
identified and fired.
   Compulsive gamblers also frequently grew up in a family with an
unusual emphasis on money, whether it was a very poor family or a
rich one that set a high economic standard for the child, she said.
   With treatment, gamblers can be freed of a disorder that hands
them a greater loss than any of their bets.
   Lorenz said she recently testified on behalf of a bank officer, a
basically honest man with two children, who had embezzled $1 million
to pay off his bookies.
   ``He had nothing to show for it,'' Lorenz said, ``other than the
action of gambling.''

<HEAD>Brooke Theiss Works Hard To Overcome Learning Disability</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY BUCK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Actress Brooke Theiss works hard because she
still remembers the time she nearly failed kindergarten.
   She stars in the NBC comedy series ``Just the Ten of Us'' as one
of the daughters, and she's the spokeswoman for Hasbro's Maxie doll
in commercials and personal appearances.
   She also recently boarded a cruise ship for an NBC movie
tentatively called ``Semester at Sea,'' and in ``Nightmare on Elm
Street IV: The Dreammaster'' last year, she turned into a giant
cockroach.
   Theiss tries hard because she has to. She suffers from a learning
disability called dyslexia.
   ``I make personal appearances before girls' groups and talk about
my dyslexia and being held back,'' she said.
   ``I almost flunked kindergarten. I couldn't read. It wasn't until
the third grade that I was tested and diagnosed as having dyslexia.
I didn't know my left from my right. I have trouble dialing the
telephone. Everyone has some problem. I've learned some other
artists have dyslexia _ Tom Cruise, Cher, writer Stephen Cannell.''
   She took special classes in school and learned to read with
relative ease. But she also admits that ``we were a little too
pampered in some classes. I'd even use dyslexia as an excuse until
college. I wasn't really motivated until then.''
   After high school, she attended New York University, which she
said has a special program for dyslexics. All of her books were
available on audio tape.
   She grew up in Los Angeles, the daughter of an advertising
executive and a real estate saleswoman. But acting was in her genes.
Her mother, Kathy Mitchell, had been a model and actress who
appeared in many live television productions in the 1950s. Her
father, Dick Thies, had played the villain in Western movies before
going into advertising. Brooke changed the spelling of her last name
to make it easier to pronounce.
   Her first break was the contract to represent the Maxie doll.
   ``They were looking for someone who looked like the doll,'' said
Theiss, a petite blonde who looks younger than her 19 years. ``I
have a big wig and clothes that look like all her costumes. Parents
bring their kids to my personal appearances and talk to me like I'm
12 years old.
   ``The Maxie doll is a fashion doll for children too young for
Barbie. When you're 12 you don't think about a career. You dream
about going to the prom and getting your driver's license.''
   She had just returned to New York from filming some doll
commercials when she got a call to appear on ABC's ``Growing
Pains.'' The comedy ``Just the Ten of Us'' began as a spinoff of
``Growing Pains'' in January 1988.
   Flying to Los Angeles on Sunday, she auditioned on Monday, got
the role later that day and began work on Wednesday.
   She plays Wendy Lubbock, one of eight children of the football
coach at an all-boys school. Jamie Luner is her twin sister, Cindy,
and Bill Kirchenbauer and Deborah Harmon are the parents.
   ``We play them as 16,'' she said. ``Wendy is very rambunctious
and rowdy. She's fun-loving and has no regrets. She takes risks,
she's the instigator. Cindy's more sensible and subtle. All the kids
are different and have well-developed personalities.''
   Prior to the spinoff she'd made a guest appearance on ``Growing
Pains'' as another character.
   She was first cast in a small role in the movie ``Little
Nikita,'' which starred Sidney Poitier and River Phoenix.
   ``When they screened the movie I went with my mother and
grandmother,'' she said. ``I told my mother when my part was coming
up. They cut my part out of the movie. My grandmother, who doesn't
hear well, said very loudly, `Did they cut it?'''
   Her new movie is about a shipboard rivalry between the students
from two schools on a cruise-and-study tour. NBC will telecast the
movie next season. It's being filmed on a five-day cruise to
Catalina and Ensenada, Mexico.
   She remembers ``Nightmare on Elm Street'' as one of her most
enjoyable roles.
   ``I was in makeup two hours every day to play the cockroach,''
said Theiss. ``I ran into a cockroach trap and have this slimy stuff
all over me. It's the gooey stuff they use for filled donuts. I had
to stick my face in it. I thought it was so funny.
   ``My costume was made of rubber foam. I had extra legs and
antennae sticking out. I remember once at three o'clock in the
morning, I had cables all over me to control the legs and antennae
and all these people manipulating the cables. At the end, they did
me in. I got squashed.''

<DATELINE>CHAPPAQUIDDICK ISLAND, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's not even the same bridge
anymore. New posts and guardrails have been added, but that was some
time ago, and now Dike Bridge is rotting. Gulls fly over and drop
shellfish on it to break open their supper.
   Not much to it. No signs, no reminders.
   But Dike Bridge is on Chappaquiddick.
   It lives oversized in American political history because Sen.
Edward M. Kennedy drove his Oldsmobile off the bridge into Poucha
Pond around midnight 20 years ago.
   Mary Jo Kopechne, a 28-year-old Washington secretary, was found
dead in the back seat about 10 hours later. Kennedy, then 37, did
not notify police until 9:30 a.m., long after he returned to his
hotel, across the water on Martha's Vineyard.
   He said he and a friend repeatedly dove to the car in
unsuccessful rescue attempts, and that he was then ``exhausted and
in a state of shock.''
   Since the accident the night of July 18, 1969, Massachusetts
voters have re-elected Kennedy four times to the Senate by healthy
margins. But most people think the string of events that occurred
after he left a cottage party that night probably cost him the White
House.
   The incident has been an albatross around the island's neck as
well.
   Like Kennedy, most longtime Chappaquiddick residents don't like
to discuss the accident. It is a bitter memory, the day their
pastoral existence became the focus of the worst sort of publicity _
the heir to the Kennedy family dynasty had sullied not just his
reputation but theirs, too.
   When asked about the accident and the impact it's had on their
lives, Vineyarders who have lived in Edgartown or on Chappaquiddick
Island for more than 20 years often become silent.
   One Edgartown real estate agent, usually smiling and friendly,
momentarily choked up when asked about the accident and then refused
to discuss it.
   Jane Tomassian, the head of the Martha's Vineyard Historical
Preservation Society, has lived in Edgartown eight years. She has
sensed some of her neighbors' resentment about the incident.
   ``Martha's Vineyard, pre-Chappaquiddick, was sort of a quiet
vacation spot. The international attention that centered here
immediately after the incident and during the trial, and the focus
that has been put on the Vineyard since then, has really
unfortunately put the Vineyard on the map,'' Tomassian said.
   Kennedy eventually pleaded guilty to leaving the scene of an
accident and received a two-month suspended prison sentence. He was
placed on probation for one year.
   Judge James A. Boyle, who oversaw the nine-month inquest,
expressed doubt about key portions of Kennedy's testimony. When
Boyle's final report was released in April 1970, the case was
officially closed. But public debate over its ramifications
continues.
   The Dike Bridge connects a beautiful strip of beach with the rest
of Chappaquiddick Island, at the eastern side of Martha's Vineyard.
In May, tall fences were erected on either side of the bridge _ long
since closed to vehicular traffic _ and the only way to reach the
beach now is to drive an all-terrain vehicle south for about five
miles before doubling back north.
   Town officials are concerned about safety at the bridge, but
sporadic arguments over the years reveal another factor in the move
to tear it down _ embarrassment over the dubious tourist attraction.
   Most tourists don't journey to Martha's Vineyard soley to see the
scene of what has been called ``the most famous traffic fatality in
the history of American politics.'' But, as long as they're down
there, it's right across the ferry ...
   ``Yeah, people ask about it every day,'' said a teen-age girl
running the four-car ferry from Edgartown to Chappaquiddick Island.
``We get a car asking on every trip across.''
   Once tourists get out to Dike Bridge, there's not a lot to see _
just a simple wooden bridge across a decidedly uninteresting pond.
Beyond the bridge are the dunes, and still farther the vast blue of
Nantucket Sound.
   ``They find themselves very disappointed,'' said Patric Jamo, a
waiter at a restaurant on the edge of Edgartown Harbor. ``There's
really nothing there.''
   Linda Malcouronne, the president of the Edgartown Board of Trade
and manager of the Colonial Inn, contends the bridge isn't that much
of a tourist draw. She says most of the summertime tourists choose
the Vineyard for other reasons and visitors might not even be aware
of the significance of the bridge.
   ``It's a whole other time, a time warp,'' Malcouronne said.
   Whether the islanders like it or not, though, the accident is
fixed in their psyche. A headline that appeared in the Vineyard
Gazette referred to the debate over tearing down the ``Kennedy
Bridge.''
   Just up the block from the Colonial Inn is the Shiretown Inn, the
hotel where Kennedy stayed on his visit two decades ago. Kennedy had
walked through the hotel's lobby the morning of the accident and
stood on a balcony talking about yachts with other vacationers
before he filed an accident report with the Edgartown police.
   The new owners of the Shiretown have taken down a sign that hung
behind the front desk telling people not to bother asking about
Chappaquiddick, or what room Kennedy was staying in. But they still
shun inquiries.
   ``We have no comment,'' said a hotel worker who wouldn't give her
name. ``People don't ask about it. It's not a big thing anymore. We
weren't even around then.''
   Kennedy, who has over the years expressed sadness about the
accident, responded with a prepared statement when asked about the
incident recently.
   ``I took full responsibility for the tragedy at the time, and I
still do,'' Kennedy said. ``There was a full and complete
investigation by authorities, and there have been extensive
additional investigations by the press. I have expressed my remorse
and responsibility to my own family, to the Kopechne family, and to
the people of Massachusetts, and I express those sentiments again.
   ``I have told everything I know about the accident. I only wish
that it were in my power to do something more to ease the continuing
pain that I feel and that Mr. and Mrs. Kopechne feel for Mary Jo's
loss.''
   In a recent Associated Press interview, Mary Jo Kopechne's
parents spoke mostly about how they still grieve over the loss of
their daughter.
   Mrs. Kopechne did say she was pleased the foreman in the grand
jury investigation of her daughter's death had recently renewed his
assertion that officials tried to cover up information to protect
Kennedy.
   She had little to say about Kennedy, but in another interview
with a magazine she and her husband had harsh words for the senator.
   ``He was worried about himself, not Mary Jo,'' Joseph Kopechne
said.
   He said his daughter did not die in vain because it kept Kennedy
from becoming president.
   Kopechne and his wife, Gwen, said they had had two brief meetings
with the senator since the accident.
   ``Those were really ridiculous meetings,'' Mrs. Kopechne said.
``Nobody told me anything, and I didn't even know what to ask. I
want him to tell me what happened. Can't he relieve us of this?''

   A Turkish peasant claims one of his kidneys was
stolen. Philippines prison inmates trade organs for reduced
sentences. Brokers in human body parts take their cut of a shadowy
market.
   The forces of supply and demand in the desperate world of organ
transplants have created a commercial trade in human organs that
worries health officials and ethicists worldwide.
   The need for organs to replace faltering body parts is growing as
research advances and surgery is more successful. But the number of
donated organs has failed to keep pace. Doctors say too few people
die in circumstances that provide transplantable organs. When they
do, relatives are often too grieved to donate a loved one's organ or
object for religious or cultural reasons.
   What to do about the organ trade varies. The United States, Japan
and West Germany ban it. In India, such trade thrives legally.
Lawmakers in Britain and the Philippines have just begun grappling
with the matter.
   ``There simply doesn't seem to be any country that has a public
policy to generate enough organs to meet the demand,'' said Arthur
Caplan, director of the Center for Biomedical Ethics at the
University of Minnesota.
   The World Health Organization in May called for a global ban on
commercial trafficking in human organs. Dr. Ursula Lehr, the West
German health minister, spoke for the ban.
   ``The idea of business-minded brokers taking advantage of the
financial distress of people in the Third World, buying their organs
for a pittance and reselling them to wealthy patients in developed
countries, is awful for me,'' she said.
   But some ask what's wrong if people, fully informed of the risks,
decide to sell one of their organs, for example, a kidney? The
question, however, becomes complicated when the potential donor is
desperately poor. People can live with one kidney, and offers for
transplantable kidneys have ranged in individual instances from
$3,000 to $20,000.
   ``Is it really for us, who are not faced with those difficulties
and that heart-rending decision, to deny people that choice?'' Neil
Hamilton, a British lawmaker, asked in recent parliamentary debate.
   ``It really isn't a choice if you're coerced by poverty,'' said
Caplan, the Minnesota ethicist.
   Others worry that selling organs would decrease the supply of
donated organs and make transplants more expensive in general.
   ``We believe ... organs would go to the highest bidder rather
than to the patient who needs them most,'' said Bernadette Haze, a
spokeswoman for the Netherlands-based Eurotransplant, which matches
organ donors and recipients in the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg,
West Germany and Austria.
   Britain, which has no law controlling the sale of organs, took up
the issue this year after a Turk was arrested in Istanbul for
arranging commercial transplants at a private London hospital. One
of the ``donors'' contended he was duped and robbed of his kidney.
   The alleged organ broker, Tunc Ay Kunter, was convicted May 18
and sentenced to two years in prison for brokering the sale of a
Turkish peasant's kidney to a Libyan doctor. Police said Kunter
confessed to arranging four such sales when he was arrested.
   Turkish law allows organ donation but outlaws selling, brokering
or buying human organs.
   The peasant, Ahmet Koc, who got a two-year suspended sentence,
contended he went to the hospital for a physical connected to a job
offer and thought he was being anesthetized for the checkup. After
the kidney was removed, he said he was paid the equivalent of $4,267.
   British lawmakers have introduced legislation making it a crime
to pay or receive payment for a human organ. Parliament is expected
to pass it this month.
   Organ sales are not illegal in the Philippines, but in late May,
the vice president of the Philippines Senate filed a bill to ban
sales of human organs and tissues, calling practitioners
``modern-day Draculas.''
   Filipino death row prisoners began donating organs in 1976 as
part of a program to reduce overcrowding without resorting to
widespread executions, explained Pablo Rosales, assistant director
of the National Penitentiary. Rosales said most donor inmates
avoided execution and some were freed after spending a few more
years in prison.
   When capital punishment was banned in 1987, prisoners started
asking for money, he said. One prisoner who donated a kidney even
complained to Rosales that he received only $95, without the
mini-cassette recorder he was promised.
   Media attention greatly reduced the number of people seeking
prisoners' organs, Rosales said, and no prisoner has donated a
kidney since last year.
   But Rosales believes organ sales continue with private donors,
most likely poor slum dwellers.
   Dr. Kazuo Ota, chairman of the Japan Society for Transplantation,
said he knew of several patients who had organ transplants in the
Philippines and that some Japanese were acting as organ brokers.
Organ sales are banned in Japan.
   Dr. Jorge Neumann of the Sao Paulo Heart Institute and a member
of the Brazilian Association of Organ Transplants said that
``certainly there exists a black market of organs in Brazil.'' But
he said no statistics on organ sales were available.
   Last fall, reports in foreign newspapers that adoption rings were
routinely buying babies in Third World countries and selling them to
American and Israeli families whose children needed organ
transplants prompted outrage from American officials.
   The State Department in October blamed the Soviet Union for the
reports and said a European Parliament resolution criticizing the
purported activity was based on ``false and misleading statements
and a discredited report by a Soviet front organization.''
   In the United States, selling organs has been illegal since 1984
and sentiment against the practice is high. But allegations of
influence peddling in arranging precious transplants surface from
time to time.
   In April, Justice Department investigators said they had dropped
an investigation into accusations that pioneering surgeon Thomas
Starzl, head of transplants at Presbyterian-University and
Children's hospitals in Pittsburgh, had given high-paying foreigners
preferential treatment.
   The investigation followed newspaper articles that said about 28
percent of transplants performed by Starzl's team in 1984-5 were on
foreigners who often weren't as sick as other patients or had waited
a shorter time, but who had paid surgeon's fees four times higher
than Americans who had the same operations.
   Caplan argues for regulations to ensure that medical need, rather
than money or influence, determines who gets available organs.
   Some in the field say the risk of exploitation would be reduced
if a neutral party, such as government, replaced organ brokers. And
donations might increase with incentives such as compensation to
donors or their families for all medical costs, time lost from work
or burial expenses. There could also be a break on inheritance or
other taxes.
   Recently, transplant researchers began looking at animal-to-human
transplants.
   At a May meeting of the American Society of Transplant
Physicians, researchers predicted pigs would become the main source
of donor organs once cross-species transplantation becomes practical.
   ``There's always been a shortage of organs and there probably
always will be unless we learn to take them out of animals,'' said
Caplan. ``I don't know if it's going to be biologically feasible,
but I think that's the direction we have to try.''

<HEAD>Court's Term Showed a Dramatic Swing to the Right</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court, a legacy of Ronald Reagan's
presidency, veered dramatically to the right in its 1988-89 term as
decisions on abortion, civil rights and the death penalty
highlighted an invigorated political conservatism.
   The coalescence of a dependable conservative majority led and
nurtured by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist was so pronounced
that legal scholars predict it will influence the course of American
society for decades.
   ``This is the year the Rehnquist court came of age,'' said A.E.
Dick Howard, a University of Virginia law professor. ``We have now
seen the emergence of a bloc of justices on the court who in at
least most of the court's agenda can be predictably conservative.''
   In his first full term, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy tipped the
balance of power _ leading some to compare his role to that of
Arthur Goldberg on the liberal-dominated court of the 1960s.
   Kennedy, the last of three high court appointments made by former
President Reagan, replaced Lewis F. Powell, a generally conservative
justice who most often joined the court's liberal wing on abortion
and civil rights.
   Powell served as a fulcrum, often the pivotal vote on the most
divisive issues before the court. That role has been inherited by
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, a Reagan appointee more conservative
than Powell.
   The court's conservatives also include Reagan appointee Antonin
Scalia and Byron R. White, who was appointed by John F. Kennedy in
1962.
   Most often left in dissent in the term's major cases were
liberals William J. Brennan, Thurgood Marshall, Harry A. Blackmun
and John Paul Stevens.
   Of 132 signed decisions, 32 were reached by 5-4 votes. Rehnquist
was in the majority in 81 percent of those; Brennan in 22 percent.
The two were on opposite sides in 30 of the 32.
   The court, in 5-4 votes, gave states greater power to regulate
abortions, allowed capital punishment for mentally retarded
murderers and killers who committed their crimes when as young as
16, and dismayed civil rights activists in a series of rulings.
   The court strayed from its conservative course in several
free-speech decisions, most notably ruling that burning the American
flag is a constitutionally protected form of political protest.
   Here are summaries of the major Supreme Court rulings of the
1988-89 term:
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>CIVIL RIGHTS</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   _The court made it more difficult for minorities and women to
prove on-the-job bias by using statistics showing that women and
minorities are under-represented in an employer's higher-paying jobs.
   _The court gave white men more power to challenge as unlawful
``reverse discrimination'' court-approved affirmative action
programs helping women and minorities.
   _States and state officials are not among the ``persons'' who can
be sued under a much-used 1871 law authorizing monetary damages for
those whose rights are violated.
   _Local governments may not be sued under the same 1871 law when
their employees violate someone's rights unless it can be proved the
violation was part of an official government policy.
   _Another key civil rights law, enacted in 1866, cannot be used to
fight on-the-job racial or sexual harassment.
   _The court made it more difficult for employers to defend
themselves against bias charges by contending their adverse actions
were based on ``mixed motives'' _ some legal and some illegal.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>CRIMINAL LAW</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   _The government may seize criminal suspects' assets even if such
confiscations leave the suspects unable to hire the lawyers of their
choice.
   _The court made it significantly easier for police to stop,
question and search airline passengers suspected of drug
trafficking. The justices upheld the arrest and conviction of a man
stopped because he matched the ``profile'' characteristics of a drug
courier.
   _The court upheld sentencing rules that reduce the discretion
individual judges have in meting out the punishment for various
federal crimes.
   _Police may stray from the precise wording of the famous Miranda
warnings given to criminal suspects, even if the result arguably
confuses suspects about their right to free legal help.

<BYLINE>ABORTION</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   _The court upheld a Missouri ban on public employees performing
or assisting in abortions and on abortions in public hospitals. Also
upheld was a requirement that doctors test for fetal viability if
asked to abort a pregnancy at least 20 weeks old. The state bans
most abortions of viable fetuses, those able to survive outside the
womb. Although stopping short of reversing its 1973 decision
legalizing abortion, the court moved away from a series of abortion
rulings in which similar state regulations were invalidated.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>FREE SPEECH</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   _Burning the American flag is a constitutionally protected
expression, although not absolutely free from criminal liability.
   _Government restrictions on commercial speech and on the time,
place and manner of expressive activities such as controlling the
noise level at rock concerts do not have to meet the ``least
restrictive means'' test applied when content-based restrictions are
aimed at non-commercial speech.
   _Congress cannot put the ``dial-a-porn'' industry out of
business. Obscene telephone dial-up messages may be outlawed, but
merely indecent messages are constitutionally protected.
   _States may not bar political parties from endorsing primary
election candidates.
   _Limited states' power to punish the reporting of lawfully
obtained truthful information, even when it interferes with
someone's privacy.
   _States may use anti-racketeering laws to prosecute the owners of
adult bookstores charged with selling obscene materials, but may not
close down those bookstores before trials are conducted.

<BYLINE>RELIGION</BYLINE>

   _Religious symbols such as a Christmas nativity scene may not be
governmentally sponsored or displayed at government buildings if it
conveys an enitrely religious message.
   _States may not tax non-religious publications while exempting
religious ones.
   _States may not deny unemployment benefits to people who refuse
to work on their sabbath even if the refusal is not based on a
religious sect's doctrine.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>DEATH PENALTY</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   _The death penalty can be a constitutional punishment for
convicted murderers who were as young as 16 when they committed
their crime. The court said no national consensus exists against the
execution of juvenile killers and thus the punishment is not ``cruel
and unusual.''
   _Capital punishment may be imposed for mentally retarded killers.
   _States are under no constitutional obligation to provide free
lawyers for death row inmates who lose their initial round of
appeals.
   _Judges and juries who must choose death or life in prison for
convicted murderers are allowed to consider the victim's traits.

   _The court condoned mandatory drug tests for railroad employees
involved in accidents and for U.S. Customs Service employees seeking
drug-enforcement jobs.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>FAMILIES AND CHILDREN</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   _Public officials may not be sued in federal court when their
alleged gross negligence permits a child to be abused by a parent.
The justices said a state does not have a constitutional duty to
protect people, including abused children, who are not in the
state's custody.
   _States may deny any man who says he fathered a woman's child
while she was married to someone else the chance to file a ``reverse
paternity'' lawsuit to prove fatherhood. But the court said such men
must be given a fair chance to seek visitation rights.

   _Enormous punitive-damages awards in personal injury and other

   _States have sweeping powers to protect consumers by barring
utilities from charging customers for the costs of abandoned nuclear
power plants.
   _The court broadly interpreted a key federal anti-racketeering
law, making it easier to use in civil lawsuits against businesses
accused of fraud. The court also said the law may be invoked if a

figures were immediately available, the State Department put the
total of U.S. loans to sub-Saharan Africa at $4.3 billion, including
$743 million in development loans, $1.5 billion from the U.S.
government's Export-Import Bank and $1.2 billion in U.S. government
loans to buy surplus American farm products.
   Bush did not say which of these categories would be included.

<HEAD>Retailers Post Slightly Better Sales Gains in June</HEAD>
<HEAD>With BC-Retail Sales-Table</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARYBETH NIBLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Sales picked up slightly at the country's big chain stores last
month from May's weak pace, but growth was kept in check by a
general slowdown in economic activity.
   ``The gains were stronger than we had seen in the prior month,
but across the board they were certainly not outstanding,'' said
Joseph Ronning, a retail industry analyst with the investment firm
Brown Brothers Harriman &amp; Co.
   Economists monitor retail sales for clues about consumer
expenditures, which account for about two-thirds of the country's
economic activity.
   The reports from U.S. retailers Thursday suggested that spending
on big-ticket goods, like home appliances, has slowed while outlays
for less expensive merchandise haven't been crimped as much by
rising credit charges, reflecting interest rate hikes earlier this
year.
   Several department stores and specialty retailers said they
benefited again last month from the gradual comeback in women's
clothing sales following a deep slump during the past two years.
   Limited Inc., one of the nation's biggest apparel retailers,
posted an 11 percent increase in sales in the five weeks ended July
1. Besides its flagship women's clothing shops, Limited owns
specialty stores such as Victoria's Secret and Abercrombie &amp; Fitch.
   The take at Limited's stores open at least a year, called
same-store or comparable store sales, rose 12 percent in June.
   Retailers and analysts consider the same-store sales a more
accurate reflection of a company's performance than totals that
include sales at newly opened stores. Not every retailer reports
sales on this basis.
   Other beneficiaries of the recovery in women's apparel included
Dayton Hudson Corp., which said total June sales rose 14.2 percent.
The department store operator, which also runs Target and Mervyn's
stores, reported same-store sales were up 6.1 percent.
   J.C. Penney Co. Inc. attributed its sales pickup to demand for
summer fashions and increased purchases of soft home furnishings
like bedding and bath goods. Its June sales rose 7.6 percent and
same-store sales increased 5.6 percent.
   Fred Wintzer, who follows specialty clothing merchants for the
investment firm Alex. Brown &amp; Sons Inc. in Baltimore, said: ``The
apparel retailers are making progress but they are a little bit
disappointing given how bad last year's results were.''
   Recent monthly sales by apparel sellers may look much better than
they actually were because they are being compared with last year,
which was an exceptionally bleak time for fashion merchandising.
   Among the leading general merchandisers, K mart Corp., the
country's second-largest retailer after Sears, Roebuck and Co., said
its June sales represented an improvement after a string of
disappointing months. The discounter said sales at all of its stores
went up 5.7 percent in June after a 2.5 percent increase in May.
   Sales at K marts open at least a year picked up 2.3 percent in
June after falling 0.6 percent in May.
   Rival discounter Wal-Mart Stores Inc., third among U.S.
retailers, turned in another robust performance, reporting a 25
percent increase in total June sales and a 10 percent gain in
same-store sales.
   Jeffrey Edelman, an analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.,
said industrywide sales were uneven during June, with the weaker
figures from the non-clothing categories.
   A series of indexes Edelman prepared indicated most types of
retailers fared better in June than in May. The weighted average of
37 merchants' sales, on a same-store basis, rose 5.3 percent in June
after a 4.2 percent May gain.
   The Drexel index of sales at 14 department stores and discounters

<HEAD>Duracell Recalls Specialty Lithium Camera Batteries</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BETHEL, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Duracell Inc. is recalling two models of
lithium camera batteries because of an assembly defect that can
cause severe overheating and in some cases damage cameras, company
officials said.
   The batteries affected by the recall include all Duracell XL
Lithium camera batteries with the model number DL123A or DL223A and
labeled ``Made in USA.''
   The DL123A is a three-volt specialty battery, while the DL223A is
a six-volt specialty battery. Both are used almost exclusively in
35mm automatic cameras.
   Jim Donahue, a Duracell spokesman, said Thursday that the
overheating only occurred in eight out of an estimated 8 million
batteries, but that the company decided to ``take the conservative
step and alert customers.''
   While no injuries have resulted from the defect, in some cases a
camera's battery compartment was melted, Donahue said.
   The defect, now corrected, occurred during assembly when the
anotab _ the metal strip that conducts the charge from the positive
terminal to the negative terminal _ became bent, Donahue said. Once
inside the camera, the defect could cause an internal short in the
battery, leading it to overheat, he said.
   Donahue said the defect had nothing to do with the company's
other business. The two models in question make up about 1 percent
of Duracell's current sales volume, and costs associated with the
recall are to have no significant effect on Duracell, he said.
   Donahue said the batteries are used in 35mm cameras that have
automatic rewind and auto-advance. He said they tend to be newer
models and are rarely used in cameras more than three or four years
old.
   Duracell is asking consumers who are using the DL123A and DL223A
batteries with the ``Made in USA'' label to throw away their
batteries in an outdoor trash receptacle. They should then contact
the company, giving their name and address, and they will receive
free replacement batteries.

   Eds: Duracell says consumers may call the following toll-free
number to replace their batteries: 1-800-832-5333.

   CNW Corp. says it will cut about a fourth of its
managers to help reduce costs and pay for a pending $1.6 billion
buyout of the company.
   James Foote, a CNW spokesman, said the company was offering
voluntary buyouts to each of its 1,000 managers to reduce the top

   He said managers have until Monday to decide whether to accept
the buyout packages, which include severance payments based on the
length of employment with CNW.
   ``If we don't get the 25 percent voluntarily, then we'll make
involuntary cuts,'' Foote said Wednesday. ``It's part of our overall

of the sale of the company.'' CNW, parent company of the Chicago &amp;
North Western railroad, last month agreed to a $50-a-share offer by
an investment group formed by Blackstone Capital Partners L.P. and
CNW's senior management.
   CNW accepted the managment-led bid following a hostile tender
offer from Japonica Partners, a New York investment partnership.
   CNW has cut its total work force to 8,500 from 10,200 in 1985.

<HEAD>Two Big Eight Firms Agree To Merge, Two More Discuss Combining</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARIANN CAPRINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The accounting firms Deloitte Haskins &amp; Sells and Touche Ross &amp;
Co. have agreed in principle to join forces while two larger Big
Eight firms confirmed that they had entered into merger negotiations.
   Subject to the approval of partners at Deloitte and Touche Ross,
the combined company would have worldwide revenue exceeding $4
billion and employ over 65,000 people in 101 countries. It will be
known as Deloitte &amp; Touche in the United States, the firms said in a
statement Thursday.
   Separately, Arthur Andersen &amp; Co. and Price Waterhouse confirmed
reports that they had begun talks about a possible merger of their
worldwide operations. A confidentiality agreement will be in effect
for the next 60 days while the proposition is being explored.
   An Andersen-Waterhouse merger would create the world's largest
accounting firm, reaping $5 billion a year in worldwide revenue and
$2.7 billion in U.S. revenue.
   The merger wave among the Big Eight firms began weeks ago with
the announcement that Ernst &amp; Whinney and Arthur Young &amp; Co. agreed
to combine their operations to create an accounting firm with
worldwide revenue of $4.2 billion and domestic revenue of $2 billion.
   Although Deloitte and Touche Ross are the smallest of the
so-called Big Eight firms, they have posted the most rapid growth in
recent years. Between 1985 and 1988, their individual worldwide
revenue jumped more than 88 percent, according to Bowman's
Accounting Report, an industry publication.
   Last year their worldwide growth averaged 26 percent, compared
with an average of 22 percent for the other Big Eight firms.
   Deloitte and Touche Ross noted their desire to ``serve
multinational companies in today's global economy'' as a primary
reason for the merger.
   Edward A. Kangas, managing partner and chief executive of Touche
Ross, issued a statement saying ``a strong European capability is
vital to serving our clients' needs as the economic unification of
Europe in 1992 approaches.''
   Deloitte Chairman and Chief Executive Officer J. Michael Cook
also pointed to the economic growth of the Pacific Rim as a need for
a strengthened presence in Asia. The combined firm will draw on the
expertise of the Japanese audit firm Tohmatsu Awoki &amp; Sanwa, a
member of the Touche Ross International organization.
   Worldwide, the firm will be known as Deloitte Ross Tohmatsu
International.
   Kangas and Cook will serve as chief executives of the
international organization and the U.S. firm, respectively. Kangas
also will serve as a managing partner of the U.S. firm.
   Experts generally agreed that the merger makes sense,
particularly because the accounting industry has become increasingly
specialized.
   Among Deloitte's audit clients are General Motors,
Kimberly-Clark, Monsanto and Procter &amp; Gamble, said Arthur Bowman,
publisher of the Atlanta-based Bowman's Accounting Report.
   Touche Ross's audit clients include American Motors, Chrysler,
Litton Industries and Pillsbury, he said.
   Deloitte also displays its strength in the mergers and
acquisitions arena. Bowman said the firm is a favorite of Kohlberg
Kravis Roberts &amp; Co., the powerful New York investment firm.
   KKR tapped Deloitte to perform a number of accounting-related
services for its record $25 billion buyout of RJR Nabisco as well as
other targets, including Safeway and Beatrice.
   In a joint statement, Price Waterhouse Chairman Joseph E. Connor
and Arthur Andersen Chief Executive Lawrence E. Weinbach said the
the firms are seeking to benefit from the globalization of world
economies, accelerating technological changes and demand for new
services and investments.
   ``These developments are creating a demand for increased
worldwide professional and financial resources which to serve
clients' needs,'' their statement read.
   Arthur Andersen is the second-largest U.S. accounting firm, while
Price Waterhouse ranks fifth.
   Together the two firms would audit almost 40 percent of the
Fortune 500, which could lead to Federal Trade Commission concerns
about a competitive imbalance, Bowman said.
   The firms did not comment on whether any employees would be let
go, but observers suspect support staff will be cut.
   ``They will definitely have to let people go at the support
level, the non-professional staffs,'' Bowman said. ``And there will
be some fallout at the partner level. You don't need two partners in
charge of the same little area.''
   But fees are unlikely to head lower despite savings from
consolidation.
   ``They can't lower the hourly rates that they're charging, so the
only thing they can save on is administrative and certain overhead
costs to help the bottom line,'' said one accountant at a
second-tier firm who asked not to be named.

<HEAD>Utility Mutual Funds Fare Best, Gold Funds Worst in 2nd Qtr</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mutual funds that invested in utilities posted
the biggest returns as a group in the second quarter, while
gold-oriented funds fared the poorest, according to a new survey of
mutual fund performance.
   The survey by Lipper Analytical Services, distributed for release
today, said utility funds had an average rate of return of 11.25
percent in the three months ended June 30, while gold-oriented funds
lost 2.97 percent.
   That placed those two groups at the top and bottom of the list,
respectively, of 20 fund groups that Lipper tracks. Its tallies
assume that all dividends and capital gains distributions are
reinvested. Lipper has been publishing its fund performance analysis
for 16 years.
   ``Utility funds benefitted from both lower interest rates and
particular interest in telephone company securities,'' said A.
Michael Lipper, president of the research concern that bears his
name.
   He said funds invested in gold companies or bullion, on the other
hand, ``have not had a period of good performance for so long that
they are bound to have one some day.''
   The only other group posting a negative rate of return for the
quarter were international funds, which lost an average of 0.27
percent.
   Overall, Lipper said general equity funds outperformed fixed
income funds, with a rate of return of 7.28 percent compared with
5.66 percent.
   That compares with a 7.61 percent rate of return in the Dow Jones
industrial average of 30 blue chip stocks and 8.82 percent in the
S&amp;P 500 index, assuming dividend reinvestment, Lipper said.
   Despite the slower overall performance of fixed-income funds, a
pair of fixed-income funds invested mainly in zero-coupon Treasury
securities had the highest rate of return of more than 1,730
individual funds tracked.
   The Benham Target 2015 fund had a rate of return of 27.42 percent
for the period while Benham Target 2010 fund gained 23.61 percent,
the Lipper survey said.
   Eagle Growth Shares, a growth fund with large holdings in media
companies, had the third-highest rate of return at 23.57 percent, it
said.
   The worst-performing individual funds were Strategic
Gold-Minerals, a gold-oriented fund that lost 9.01 percent, and
Prudent Speculator: Large Cap, a capital appreciation fund that lost
8.30 percent.
   The growth fund group was the best performer among the general
equity funds, with an average rate or return of 7.79 percent.
Capital appreciation funds gained an average of 7.33 percent, while
growth and income funds and equity income funds each had average
returns of 6.92 percent.
   The slowest-growing general equity fund was the group of small
company growth funds at an average of 6.77 percent.
   Among funds invested in specific areas, the science and
technology funds group had an average rate of return of 7.07
percent, the health and biotechnology fund group gained 5.25 percent
and the natural resources funds gained 3.31 percent.

<HEAD>Electrolux To Close Rahway Plant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Electrolux Corp., days after completing its
purchase of troubled Regina Co., announced it is closing Regina's
production facility in Rahway and eliminating the positions of the
plant's 250 employees.
   Steve Cooper, Electrolux senior counsel, said Thursday the new
parent of the vacuum cleaner maker expects to phase out operations
in Rahway by Sept. 30.
   ``At that time, those employees will be out of a job,'' he said.
   The Marietta, Ga.-based company is negotiating severance packages
with local 411 of the International Union Of Electrical, Radio and
Machine Employees, which he said represents about 85 percent of the
Rahway employees, Cooper said.
   The Rahway closing leaves Regina with a lone plant in Long Beach,
Miss., employing about 1,000 employees. Cooper said the Rahway
workers are now on a two-week paid vacation and the Mississippi
plant is on an annual shutdown.
   Cooper said Regina will continue to make upright vacuum cleaners,
rug shampooers, its ``electric broom'' and a personal whirlpool bath
under the Regina name.

<HEAD>State Farm Announces Lawsuit Against Nevada Insurance Rollback</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE McDONALD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CARSON CITY, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance
Co. says it will file a lawsuit challenging a Nevada law that
requires auto insurers to cut their rates.
   ``We'll probably file the complaint by the end of next week or
early in the week after that,'' said Dave Hill, a spokesman at the
insurer's headquarters in Bloomington, Ill.
   Hill said Thursday the company plans to challenge the law under
the Nevada and U.S. constitutions on the grounds that the forced
rollback violates the prohibition against taking property without
due process.
   The law requires insurers to cut their rates to 15 percent below
the levels of July 1, 1988, on new or renewed policies, starting in
October.
   Gov. Bob Miller, who signed the rollback into law Thursday, has
said he's uncertain about the measure's constitutionality. But he
said Nevadans who support a rate rollback deserve a chance to have
the state defend their position in court.
   The law allows insurance companies to raise rates only if they
prove to the state insurance commissioner that they would go
bankrupt without an increase.
   Nevada has the fifth-highest auto insurance rates in the nation,
with drivers paying average annual premiums of $880, according to
the state Insurance Division.
   The American Insurance Association has said it also planned to
challenge the rollback in court.
   Jeff Beyer, a spokesman for Farmers Insurance Group Inc., one of
Nevada's largest auto insurers, said the company hasn't decided
whether to challenge the rollback.
   He said a similar bankruptcy test in California's Proposition 103
insurance rollback was ruled unconstitutional by that state's
Supreme Court on the grounds it denied insurers a fair return on
their investment.
   ``Farmers is as concerned as anybody about containing the cost of
auto insurance in Nevada, but this is simply not a workable way to
solve the problem,'' Beyer said in a telephone interview from
Farmers' Los Angeles headquarters.
   ``You can't roll back prices by fiat without doing something
about the underlying costs.''

<HEAD>Experts: No Jail Term For Ex-Broker May Send Wrong Message</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sparing former stockbroker Boyd L. Jefferies a
prison sentence could send the wrong message to future Wall Street
felons: break the law and you won't do time, some legal experts say.
   But others maintain that Jefferies, who admitted to two felony
violations of federal securities laws, has more than paid his price
by cooperating with government investigators and quitting the Los
Angeles brokerage that bears his name.
   Jefferies, 58, who gave the government crucial information
leading to three indictments and one conviction, was sentenced
Thursday by a federal judge to five years of probation and fined
$250,000.
   The sentence was only the second in the Wall Street corruption
scandal triggered by infamous stock speculator Ivan F. Boesky, who
was sentenced by the same judge to three years in prison.
   ``I think the public will view this as a slap on the wrist,''
said Alan Bromberg, a securities law professor at Southern Methodist
University. ``I think the dividing line in the mind of the public is
hard time or no hard time.
   ``The $250,000 would be a lot of money for most people, but I
suspect it's not going to put Jefferies into bankruptcy court,'' he
added. ``So the bottom line is nothing very serious happened to
him.''
   But several securities defense lawyers, including former
prosecutors, said the term was appropriate, for many of the same
reasons cited by U.S. District Judge Morris Lasker in his sentencing.
   Lasker told a packed courtroom that he suspended imposition of
any jail term _ which could change if Jefferies violates probation _
in large part because of Jefferies' cooperation with prosecutors.
   He also said that the violations to which Jefferies admitted were
not as serious as Boesky's insider trading admissions and had never
been prosecuted criminally at the time of Jefferies' transgressions,
in 1985 and 1986.
   ``The violations he pleaded to, while I wouldn't said they were
technical, they certainly had not previously been the subject of
criminal investigation,'' said securities lawyer John F. Olson, who
has reviewed insider trading legislation for the American Bar
Association.
   In addition, Jefferies did not profit personally from the schemes
in which admitted a role: helping Boesky conceal ownership of $56
million in stock and filing a phony $3 million invoice to cover
losses, and helping speculator Salim B. Lewis manipulate the stock
price of Fireman's Fund Corp.
   ``Basically, he was accommodating customers and that's a
mitigating factor,'' said Sam Scott Miller, a New York securities
lawyer. ``It doesn't make it OK but it puts you in a different
category than some of the culprits.
   ``Boyd Jefferies was not Ivan Boesky,'' added Miller, who
represented a company that owned the Jefferies &amp; Co. brokerage in
the early 1970s. ``Boyd may have crowded the line and wandered over
it when he shouldn't have, but I'd call Ivan a hardcore offender.''
   Boesky's three-year sentence should serve as the benchmark for
other cases in which defendants reach plea agreements, lawyers said,
because the degree of his crimes was so severe. ``Boesky is the
crook of the century,'' said one defense lawyer involved in a
prominent fraud case, speaking anonymously.
   Boesky paid $100 million to the Securities and Exchange
Commission and pleaded guilty to one felony count of filing false
information with the SEC to settle wideranging charges that he used
illegally obtained inside information to trade on the stocks of
potential takeover targets.
   Jefferies, who was implicated by Boesky, already has taken the
stand at two mistrials in the GAF Corp. stock manipulation case and
the stock fraud trial of corporate raider and former Singer Co.
Chairman Paul A. Bilzerian, who was convicted last month. He is to
testify at the third GAF trial and the Lewis trail in the fall.
   While praising Jefferies as a model of cooperation, Lasker chided
``absurd and probably obscene'' Wall Street greed and said his
sentence shouldn't be interpreted as weak.
   ``It would be a great mistake ... if those of you in the audience
assumed that what Mr. Jefferies has been through is easy and
therefore not much of a penalty,'' the judge said.

<HEAD>EC Angry Over U.S. Decision in Soybean Dispute, Wants GATT Talks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALLY JACOBSEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The European Community expressed anger
after the United States ruled that the trading bloc's subsidy
program for oilseed farmers hurt American exporters.
   ``We are very much concerned about this,'' said Nico Wegter, a
spokesman for the 12-nation trade alliance.
   Wegter said Thursday that the community intended to ask the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade for consultations over the
latest in a series of agricultural clashes between the giant trading
partners. The 96-nation GATT is a forum for removing barriers to
world trade.
   Carla Hills, the U.S. trade representative, on Wednesday issued a
ruling that the community's production and processing subsidies on
oilseeds and animal feed proteins were ``unjustifiable and
unreasonable and (they) burden or restrict U.S. commerce.''
   She delayed until the end of January taking any punitive actions
in the case.
   The dispute stems from a complaint filed in December 1987 by the
American Soybean Association, which alleged the community subsidies
had sharply cut into American exports to Europe.
   The association argued that the Common Market payments encouraged
farmers to grow oilseeds which then reduced the demand for American
imports. The group contended U.S. soybean exports fell to $2 billion
in 1986 from $3.6 billion in 1981.
   The Common Market has argued that the erosion of the European
market was largely due to increases in cheaper imports from Brazil
and Argentina.
   In May, GATT set up an impartial panel to determine whether the
subsidies amounted to unfair trade practices under international
rules. The panel held its first meeting on June 27 and was expected
to issue its findings in early January.
   Mrs. Hills' decision to rule in the case while the GATT panel was
conducting its investigating was criticized by the Common Market.
   ``It is in our view contradictory,'' said Wegter.
   He reiterated the Common Market's contention that the subsidy
program did not constitute an unfair trade practice.
   ``Our production is kept under strict control,'' he said. ``The
prices have gone down, and it is in no way affecting imports by the
Americans.''
   The community provides costly subsidies to its farmers through
guaranteed prices for many of their crops. It also gives exporters
help so more expensive European farm products can compete with lower
prices on the world market.
   The United States complains the export subsidies have helped the
community increase its share of the world market.

<HEAD>Judge Approves Ticket Refund Plan Between Eastern, Travel Agents</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Airline Discounts, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A plan worked out by strike-hobbled Eastern
Airlines and travel agents for refunding unused tickets has won the
approval of a federal bankruptcy judge.
   The plan ties the refunds to future ticket sales by the agents.
   At a court hearing Thursday, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R.
Lifland approved the plan agreed to by Eastern, its major creditors
and the American Society of Travel Agents.
   The travel agent group earlier had petitioned the bankruptcy
court to require Eastern to pay refunds on unused tickets to travel
agents, who would pass the refunds on to their customers.
   Miami-based Eastern sought bankruptcy protection from creditors
on March 9, five days after the start of a crippling strike by the
Machinists union that was joined by pilots and flights attendants.
At that time, the airline said its debts included about $165 million
in unused tickets issued before the bankruptcy filing.
   That amount has since been reduced to about $80 million, Eastern
spokesman Robin Matell said Thursday.
   Eastern estimates it sells 75 percent of its tickets through
travel agents.
   Under Eastern's existing policy, travelers who paid cash for
unused tickets must apply directly to Eastern or to bankruptcy court
as creditors. Those who bought tickets by credit card can apply for
refunds from the card issuer.
   Alternatively, customers can use their tickets to fly Eastern,
where available, or sister carrier Continental Airlines. Although
airlines generally honor each other's tickets, competitors stopped
honoring Eastern tickets after it filed for bankruptcy protection.
   Under the new plan, effective today, travel agents will be
reimbursed for ticket refunds they gave their customers. The total
amount of refund money available will be based on the volume of new
Eastern tickets sold by the agents.
   Eastern will put $5 million into the reimbursement fund up front.
In addition, for the rest of July, Eastern will pay into the fund
each week the total amount of agents' sales of Eastern tickets that
exceeds $3.6 million, up to a maximum of $1.25 million a week.
   In August, the cap on the amount that could go into the fund each
week will increase to $2 million. A maximum of $20 million could be
put into the fund from ticket sales during the life of the program.
   The pilots union at Eastern blasted the agreement, calling it
``nothing short of the blackmail of travel agents who are creditors
in the Eastern bankruptcy.''
   In a statement, the union said the agents are, in effect,
required to sell Eastern tickets in order to make sure they can
collect the money Eastern owes them.
   In addition, the pilots said, the plan makes no provision for
customers who purchased their Eastern tickets directly, rather than
through a travel agent.

<HEAD>Holiday Discount Fares Light Up Reservation Switchboards</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY JORDEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Airline reservation switchboards are lighting up
like fireworks this week as thousands of travelers take advantage of
bargain air fares that were sparked by the midweek July 4 holiday,
airline officials say.
   Continental Airlines ignited the Independence Day fare war with
its ``Spirit of '76'' ticket prices _ $76 one way almost anywhere
the airline flies in the continental United States.
   Rivals that matched the fare, and those that upped the ante,
reported the price-slashing lit a fire under air travelers looking
for bargains.
   The special fares are designed to drum up business during the
slack midweek holiday travel period, airline officials said.
   ``Traditionally, when you see a holiday falling in midweek,
business travelers decide not to travel that week. That is the case
this week. But this is win-win situation,'' said Ned Walker, a
Continental spokesman at the airline's Houston headquarters.
   After Continental announced its low fares Sunday, Braniff Airways
matched the offer the next day. Bookings at Braniff on Monday broke
the airline's one-day record by about 40 percent, said spokesman Don
McGuire.
   ``The holiday weekend was extremely strong. The public response
has been beautiful,'' he said in a telephone interview from Braniff
headquarters in Orlando, Fla.
   United Airlines and American Airlines also matched the cut-rate
fares.
   Tickets for most of the special fares must be purchased by
Saturday and travel must start by that day. The fares require a
round-trip purchase and carry other restrictions.
   Most industry observers said the holiday discounts are nothing
new and amounted to an excuse to advertise. But one analyst said
Braniff's program has a different intent.
   ``It is a typical action by an airline that is perhaps a little
tight on cash,'' said Robert J. Joedicke, an analyst at Shearson
Lehman Hutton Inc. ``It is an attempt to sell fares now in order to
get working capital.''
   The discounts are not part of a long-term trend toward lower
airline fares, he said.
   ``The truth is, discounted fares are harder and harder to find,''
said Joedicke.
   Joedicke said Continental's $76 fare, offered for such a short
period, wouldn't make much of a difference in the airline's revenue
figures.
   But Walker said response to Continental's holiday fares was so
great that the airline added several thousand additional seats for
the program.
   ``We are selling seat inventory that might otherwise go unsold,
and the American consumers get a bargain they haven't seen in
years,'' he said.
   Following Continental's lead, American Airlines adopted a $152
round-trip fare, which applies to any of the 111 markets it serves
in the 48 contiguous states.
   The Dallas-based airline also reported its best one-day traffic
period ever last Friday, when it flew 276.84 million revenue
passenger miles with an 83.5 percent load factor, officials said.
   ``We had extremely full flights anyway'' before the fare was
announced, said American spokesman Jim Brown.
   United's similar fares extend to all cities it serves in the 48
states, said spokeswoman Sara Dornacker at the airline's Chicago
headquarters.
   ``They are selling extremely well. We are having an extremely
higher period of bookings than we had last year,'' she said.
   As a result of existing higher demand, Atlanta-based Delta Air
Lines decided not to match the other fares.
   ``We looked at our loads for those days and they were high,''
said Delta spokesman Jim Lundy. ``So we were looking at diluting
revenue we already had on the books.''

<HEAD>Time Accuses Paramount of Trying to Deceive FCC</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOYCE M. ROSENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Time Inc. lawyers have charged Paramount
Communications Inc. with trying to deceive the Federal
Communications Commission about how long it would take Paramount to
complete its $12.2 billion hostile bid for Time.
   The media giant's attorneys, in a letter to FCC mass media bureau
chief Alex D. Felker released to the media Thursday, accused
Paramount of making false statements in applications for approval of
former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld as a voting trustee to hold
Time stock.
   Time is fighting Paramount's $200-a-share bid while trying to
preserve a planned merger with Warner Communications Inc.
   Time's lawyers charged that although Paramount told the FCC it
expected its original $10.7 billion bid to expire July 5, Paramount
executives knew before their offer was announced that it could not
close for several months because it is conditioned upon obtaining
regulatory approval to operate about 800 cable television systems
that Time owns. The offer is now scheduled to expire July 28.
   Paramount called the charges a delaying tactic.
   ``Time continues frantically to try to block our $200-a-share
tender offer _ the only real issue in this whole matter _ by raising
questions on timing,'' Paramount said in a statement.
   ``Of course it might take a few months to get the approvals,''
the statement continued. ``Our process is well under way.''
   Paramount released a letter from its own attorneys responding to
queries from the FCC. The letter, also addressed to Felker, said
Paramount expects it will take ``a few months'' to obtain the cable
approvals.
   At issue is Paramount's request for special temporary approval
for Rumsfeld, who would hold Time stock after the conclusion of
Paramount's tender offer and while Paramount awaits approval for the
transfer of licenses for microwave relay systems operated by Time's
cable TV subsidiary, American Television &amp; Communications Corp.
   The FCC has jurisdiction over the transfer of the relay
facilities.
   Time's attorneys claimed in their letter that because of
misrepresentations by Paramount, it would be against the public
interest for the FCC to grant Paramount's requests.
   Along with the letter, Time released parts of depositions given
by Paramount executives. In one deposition, Paramount's chief
financial officer, Michael Hope, said he did not believe company
officials gave Paramount's board ``any reason to believe that that
(July 5) would be a realistic date to expect to close this
transaction.''
   Paramount criticized Time for releasing only parts of the
depositions. ``The whole record should be available in this case
with a few minor exceptions,'' the company said. ``Time only wants
to open up for public inspection those carefully selected areas of
the record they think are useful to them.''
   While Time and Paramount quarreled over the trustee, the primary
issue in the struggle is before Delaware Chancery Court, which will
decide whether Time, in agreeing to merge with Warner earlier this
year, in effect put itself up for sale.
   If the court rules that Time did in fact put itself on the block,
the media giant's board must give serious consideration to the
Parmount offer, which Time directors rejected as financially
inadequate and too conditional.
   A hearing is set for Tuesday.
   In another courtroom, this one in Stamford, Conn., arguments were
heard Thursday in a suit brought by Time's ATC subsidiary that seeks
an injunction to stall the Paramount bid.
   Paramount attorney John L. Warden charged ATC sought the
injunction merely to keep in place Time's management, ``which has
negotiated extremely lucrative contracts for the next decade.''
   But ATC attorney James Stapleton denied the charge, saying,
``We're not trying to stop the tender offer.'' He said Paramount
officials were interested only in Time and ``they don't care about
ATC.''
   ATC, the nation's second-largest cable company with more than 4
million customers, wants Paramount to obtain approval as a cable
television franchise owner before proceeding with a takeover.
   The Time subsidiary said contracts for 200 of its franchises
require regulatory approval of a new parent company before the new
parent company assumes control.
   ATC contends it could be stripped of the 200 franchises if
Paramount fails to gain prior approval of its takeover bid.
   On Wall Street Thursday, Time stock rose 37{ cents a share to
close at $155.62{. Paramount fell $1.50 to $57.87{ a share, and
Warner picked up 50 cents to close at $61.75 a share.

   The chairman of the House Foreign Affairs
Committee says Venezuela's investigation of a foreign-exchange
scandal is causing some U.S. corporations to re-examine their
investments in the country and to withdraw top executives.
   Chairman Dante Fascell, D-Fla., in a letter to Venezuela's
ambassador in Washington, said: ``At a time when economic growth is
a priority, it would be a shame to see foreign corporations
discouraged from investing in Venezuela or decide to curtail their
operations.''
   ``I do not wish to interfere in any way in domestic affairs or in
the judicial system in Venezuela; nor can I comment on the merits of
the case,'' Fascell said in his June 13 letter to Ambassador Simon
Consalvi.
   ``As a friend of Venezuela, however, I do wish to bring to your
attention the problems this case is causing for foreign business,''
he said. ``Some American corporations have removed their top
executives and are re-examining their investments in your country.''
   Fascell said that he has been told by executives of major
American corporations that a Venezuelan judge has issued arrest
warrants for several people, including American executives, ``on
charges of fraud in obtaining preferential foreign exchange.''
   ``I understand the charges involved do not permit those accused
to be granted bail,'' Fascell said. ``The executives involved claim
they and their corporations are innocent.''
   Replying, Ambassador Consalvi said his government ``does not
welcome any discouragement to the presence of foreign businesses and
investment,'' and in fact welcomes them.
   But he said the government, operating under a system of
separation of powers, respects ``the independence of the judicial
system.''
   He also noted that Venezuela acted in March to abolish the
multiple exchange rate system.
   Investigators in Venezuela have been examining allegations that
billions of dollars in illegal profits were skimmed from a now
disbanded office set up to distribute U.S. dollars at favorable
exchange rates for essential imports.
   The investigators have been quoted in published reports as saying
that some $2.4 billion of the $30 billion involved may have been
touched by fraud.

<HEAD>Larger Incentives, Lower Financing Could Be On Its Way</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   DETROIT _ Car buyers who resisted the incentives of this spring
and summer may have their patience rewarded during the next few
weeks. The scenario they've been waiting for _ high rebates and low
interest rates _ may be on its way.
   The prime rate has dropped recently and there have been
indications that other interest rates, including those for cars,
will fall.
   ``I think there's no question that the direction of interest
rates is downward,'' Donald Ratajczak of the Economic Forecasting
Center at Georgia State University in Atlanta said Thursday.
   The incentives, which have been around since April, are likely to
stay through the end of the model year this fall because they
apparently haven't done the trick.
   Earlier this week, the eight major vehicle manufacturers with
domestic plants reported their car and light truck sales for the
first half of 1989 were 4.8 percent behind the sales pace during the
same time last year.
   That could prompt automakers to add more incentives or beef up
existing ones to move out 1989 models and clear dealer lots for the
1990s, which officially debut Oct. 1, analysts say.
   ``It's an incredibly good buying time,'' said auto analyst John
Kirnan of Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. Inc.
   However, he added: ``The industry is going to be very hard
pressed to turn the spigot on for the third quarter. You've got the
greatest levels of incentives out there and they don't seem to be
generating the interest.''
   Bill Meier, general manager of Ray Green Chevrolet in
Jacksonville, Ill., agreed.
   ``It's been slow and it's beginning to taper off,'' he said
Thursday.
   Manufacturers and dealers are wrestling with high inventory
levels, estimated by some to be as much as 80 days' worth of stock
at the current selling rate.
   ``My guess is that the industry had 76 days (worth of cars) at
the end of June, with the Big Three at 78 to 80 days,'' said analyst
David Healy of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in New York. ``It's not a
disaster, but it's uncomfortably high. A year ago, you were looking
at 60, 61 or 62 days.''
   One way to deflate inventory is to close production, drying up
the supply of cars coming into the retail sales pipeline. That, in
turn, forces layoffs.
   A United Auto Workers spokesman, declining to be identified, said
the union was monitoring the sales and production figures closely to
be sure that any layoffs are allowed under contracts with the Big
Three.
   Selective plant production cuts began several months ago. This
week and the next kick off the traditional summer vacation and
model-changeover time, as factories are prepared for the next model
year. Ford Motor Co. has no production scheduled during that time.
   On Thursday, Ward's Automotive Reports said domestic automakers'
production levels were sharply lower this week compared with the
same week a year ago. The trade journal said automakers scheduled
the production of 71,167 cars and trucks in the United States this
week, 42.6 percent fewer than the 124,029 vehicles they produced
during the same week last year.

<HEAD>Acne Drug Maker Loses First Jury Verdict over Side Effects</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Whether or not the first jury verdict against
Hoffmann-La Roche Inc.'s Accutane acne medicine leads to more
lawsuits will probably be irrelevant to the billion-dollar drug
company, analysts say.
   ``There is nothing that can happen to Hoffmann-La Roche as a
result of this situation,'' said Calvert Crary, a litigation analyst
at Labe Simpson &amp; Co. Inc. in New York.
   Last week, a federal jury in Mississippi agreed with the claim by
Mary Kathryn Thomas that the acne medicine sent her to the hospital
with bouts of disorientation, seizures and eventually comas that
lasted several days.
   The jury awarded Ms. Thomas, 59, $1 million.
   Even if hundreds of people began filing such lawsuits, ``It would
be a matter of utterly no consequence'' to the Nutley, N.J.-based
drug maker, said Crary.
   ``In a way, I suppose you could say that's what's so sick about
the whole system, but that's the system,'' he said.
   The powerful drug, a highly effective medicine for a severe and
scarring form of acne, has been linked to 73 cases of birth defects.
Its potential side effects include skin dryness, vomiting, nausea,
headaches and visual disturbances.
   A jury in Aberdeen, Miss., found that the company failed to warn
Ms. Thomas's doctor adequately about Accutane's potential side
effects when it was prescribed in 1984. Ms. Thomas at the time lived
in Columbus, Miss., and now lives outside Orlando, Fla.
   ``They're not emphasizing just how toxic this drug is,'' said Ms.
Thomas's attorney, John Owens of Tuscaloosa, Ala.
   ``We feel the verdict is wrong, that it's inappropriate,'' said
company spokeswoman Carolyn Glynn. Hoffmann-La Roche, the U.S.
subsidiary of Swiss pharmaceutical giant F. Hoffmann-La Roche &amp; Co.,
is considering an appeal, among other options, she said. Ms. Glynn
would not comment on what those might be.
   Accutane is not a proven cause of the seizures, but the company
in 1985 included warnings indicating that such seizures have been
reported in Accutane users, she said.
   Analysts discounted the lawsuit avalanche common to the asbestos
industry, the Dalkon Shield or even, to a lesser degree, cigarette
makers, who despite last year's first jury loss face fewer product
liability suits.
   There just aren't enough potential plaintiffs, said Karl
Habermas, a pharmaceutical analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein Inc. of
New York.
   ``I'm sure this will induce others to file suit and encourage
those who have, but I don't think there are that many people who
have been injured by the product,'' he said.
   Hoffmann-La Roche has yearly U.S. sales of $1.9 billion; Accutane
accounts for only about $45 million to $50 million, said Ms. Glynn.
Since the prescription drug's introduction in 1982, 1.4 million to
1.5 million people are estimated to have used it, she said.
   Insurance covers jury awards, and even without it, future cases
would be ``financially insignificant,'' Crary said.
   Ms. Glynn said 30 to 35 Accutane cases are pending, and a
somewhat greater number have been settled, thrown out of court or
won by the company.

   The government has opened Mexico's stock
exchange to foreign investment in a move that paves the way toward
eventual foreign-owned brokerages, newspapers reports said.
   Oscar Espinoza Villareal, president of the National Stock
Commission, labeled as ``historical'' the introduction of new
investment mechanisms since the government liberalized the rules on
foreign investment in May. Many sectors of the Mexican economy had
been reserved exclusively for the government and Mexican investors
for years.
   The official said that effective Thursday, foreign companies
could serve as advisers and intermediaries to Mexican brokerages
from overseas offices. They would also be able to invest using
foreign currency, the reports said.
   Enpinoza was quoted as saying that opening up the stock market
would allow it to operate in a more sophisticated manner.
   Foreigners previously have been able to invest in the Mexican
stock market, but only through local brokers and only in pesos.

<HEAD>Boeing Looking For Cause of Crack in Older 727</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE TIBBITS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Additional inspections of older Boeing 727s may be
ordered now that airlines have found cracks on four of the planes,
according to a Federal Aviation Administration spokesman.
   The FAA ordered inspections and any necessary repairs of the 47
oldest 727s after United Airlines reported it found a 20-inch crack
in one of its airplanes during a routine maintenance check June 26.
A United spokesman said Thursday that ``tiny'' cracks have also been
found on two other planes.
   American Airlines found a small crack on one plane, the Seattle
Post-Intelligencer reported today.
   The FAA deadline for completing the inspections is July 15. It
was not known how many planes had been checked so far, FAA spokesman
Dave Duff said.
   He said that checks might be required on 405 other older 727
aircraft built during the early 1960s because of manufacturing
processes used at the time, the Post-Intelligencer reported.
   ``We anticipate that we will do further airworthiness
directives,'' he said.
   United spokesman Rob Doughty said two of the three United planes
found with cracks have been repaired and are back in service and the
third will be flying shortly.
   The FAA's airworthiness directive, sent by telegram last Friday
to 727 operators, said ``preliminary indications are that the
cracking was caused by fatigue.''
   Boeing Co. engineers are trying to discover why the 25-year-old
United jet developed the 20-inch crack in a part of its fuselage
that hasn't been associated with high stress.
   The crack was in the same general area as the rupture in an Aloha
Airlines 737 that lost part of its top over Hawaii last year, but
both Boeing and the FAA said the cracking appeared entirely
different from that in the Aloha plane.
   ``This is a unique situation,'' said FAA spokesman Duff in
Seattle. ``This is the first time a report of cracking has been made
in this area.''
   Duff added the cracking was not typical of the type often found
in older aircraft.
   If not corrected, the cracks in the fuselage skin could result in
rapid decompression of the plane in flight, the FAA said.
   Duff said Thursday that FAA officials suspect ``hoop tension''
fatigue, caused by outward forces against the hull in pressurized
flight. The different thicknesses of aircraft skin at the overlap
also could be a factor, he said.
   The cracked segment was brought to Boeing laboratories in Seattle
where engineers were trying to find why it occurred, said Boeing
Commercial Airplanes spokesman Tom Cole. That analysis probably will
take several days, he said.
   The three-engine 727, which Boeing built from 1962 to 1984, was
the best-selling commercial jet before being surpassed by the Boeing
737. Cole said 1,765 727s are still in service, including 41 of the
47 planes covered by the FAA order.
   The April 28, 1988, Aloha accident, in which a stewardess fell to
her death before the flight crew could land the badly damaged plane,
focused worldwide attention on aging aircraft. The 19-year-old plane
was one of the most heavily used 737s, with nearly 90,000 landings.
   The National Transportation Safety Board said the probable cause
of the accident was the failure of Aloha's maintenance workers to
detect significant disbonding and fatigue damage along the skin of
the twin-engine jet.
   The crack in the United 727 was found where sections of skin
overlap on the left-hand side of the plane, ahead of the wings and
below the windows, Duff said.
   The FAA order required the removal of some seats, sidewall
linings and insulation to gain access to the inside of the fuselage
skin, Cole said. The inspection normally could be accomplished by
several maintenance workers in an overnight check, he said.
   Inspections were ordered only for the 47 oldest 727s because the
inner layer of aluminum skin was made thicker on later models, Cole
said.
   He said Boeing's decision to use the heavier-gauge skin was for
cost-control, not because the skin was too thin.

   Shares prices were stronger on the London Stock
Exchange Friday morning as the market was buoyed by steady buying in
selected issues and a belief that U.S. employment data will be
better than anticipated.
   Volume was robust, but dealers noted that most of the turnover
resulted from vigorous buying in Gateway, the food retailer which is
the object of two takeover bids.
   Dealers said brokers acting on behalf of Newgateway, the
consortium that includes the U.S. investment firm Wasserstein
Perrella &amp; Co. and the Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Co., picked up
just under 300 million shares.
   A spokesman for Newgateway confirmed the share purchases, which
came mostly from institutions.
   At late morning in London, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange
100-share index was 16.5 points firmer, up 0.75 percent, at 2177.7.
The index opened at its low of 2161.6 and continued its climb
throughout the morning.
   The narrower Financial Times 30-share index was up 12.2 points,
or 0.7 percent, at 1806.9.
   Volume was 565.2 million shares.

   Ford Motor Co. will build a $120 million
plant in Portugal to make automobile radios, compact disc players
and other audio components, the company said today.
   An agreement to build the 230,000-square-foot plant was signed by
Oscar B. Marx III, executive director of Ford's Automotive
Components Group, and Joaquim Ferreira do Amaral, Portugal's
minister of commerce and tourism.
   The plant, about 40 miles from Lisbon on the Setubal peninsula,
will begin operations in 1992 and employ about 1,700 people.
   Its products will be used mostly in Ford assembly plants in
Europe, said spokeswoman Maureen Mazzatenta.

   The government is ordering airlines to install
expensive bomb detectors at 40 American and foreign airports, but
officials say it will take two to three years to put them all in
place.
   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner on Thursday announced
draft Federal Aviation Administration rules requiring the devices
capable of detecting plastic explosives in checked luggage.
   The order is one of several steps taken in response to the Dec.
21 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Scotland that killed 270
people. Investigators concluded the bomb was a plastic device hidden
in luggage, although they have not determined who planted it.
   Screening devices currently used at airports cannot detect such
plastic explosives.
   The FAA said installation would be as fast as manufacturers can
produce the detectors. Some airports will need more than one device,
and installation at the first 40 airports is expected to take two to
three years, said FAA spokesman John Leyden.
   The agency did not list all of the facilities but said
international airports in New York and London would be the firast to
get the devices.
   Congress has been considering legislation that would have the
government pay for the units, which cost from $750,000 to $1 million
each.
   Airlines say the government should pay for such extraordinary
security, since the terrorist threat is aimed against the United
States, not the airlines.
   The FAA, in making the rule that will become final at the end of
August, also called for comment on whether the order should be
extended to all domestic airports.
   The busiest U.S. international airports and some major facilities
used by U.S. carriers abroad are the first to be covered.
   The FAA said the first device will be installed at New York's
John F. Kennedy International Airport by the end of the month. A
second is to be placed at London's Gatwick Airport, the FAA said.
Those and four others at unannounced airports are being paid for by
the FAA to test how the devices will be used, Leyden said.
   The rule does not mandate a specific device, but only one has so
far been approved by the FAA: the Thermal Neutron Analysis unit
manufactured by Science Applications International Corp. of San
Diego, Calif.
   Skinner said the TNA device has been ``shown to have the highest
degree of explosive detection currently possible for detecting known
civilian and military explosives manufactured here and abroad.''
   Any system that qualifies, the FAA said, would have to be
automated, be capable of detecting defined quantities and
configurations of particular explosives and be safe for operators
and baggage.
   The TNA units are not designed for use on passengers or
hand-carried bags. They bombard luggage with low-energy neutrons
that interact with chemical elements in explosives, triggering an
alarm when a bomb is present.
   Human monitoring is not required, but Leyden said details have to
be worked out on what procedures will be followed after an alarm is
triggered.

   The stock market was mixed today, registering no
strong reaction to the latest government statistics on employment.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 2.28 to 2,460.16
in the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 4 to 3 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 249 up, 176 down and
254 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 22.69 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Analysts said the Labor Department's employment data for June
didn't do much to resolve the debate on Wall Street over whether the
economy might be headed for a recession or a more benign ``soft
landing.''
   The report showed an increase of 180,000 in nonfarm payroll
employment, below most advance estimates.
   But figures for May were revised to show a gain of 207,000, more
than double the estimate of 101,000 reported a month ago.
   The equivocal numbers left traders watching the credit markets
for signs of how the Federal Reserve might have interpreted them.
   Among actively traded blue chips, International Business Machines
rose ] to 112; McDonald's gained ] to 28~; Philip Morris added \ to

   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
slipped .13 to 179.69. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was up .26 at 361.37.
   On Thursday the Dow Jones industrial average rose 5.88 to
2,462.44.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 9 to 5 on the
NYSE, with 950 up, 522 down and 500 unchanged.

<TEXT>
   Adolph Coors Co. said it will offer a
lower-priced beer starting Sept. 11, for the first time in its
116-year history.
   The brewer, the nation's fourth-largest, plans a large
advertising campaign to introduce Keystone and Keystone Light, Mike
Willey, brand development manager for Keystone, said Thursday.
   Coors will brew Keystone at its Golden plant with existing
employees, Willey said. Production on other labels will not be cut.
   Beer pricing is divided into categories: import; super premiums
such as George Killian's; premiums such as Miller High Life, Coors
and Budweiser; popular brands such as Old Milwaukee, Old Style,
Rainier, and economy brands such as Meisterbrau.
   Popular and economy beers account for a fourth of the $40 billion
retail beer market in the United States every year.
   ``There's considerable demand for a high-quality beer at a
popular price. It's a category we haven't been in,'' Willey said.
   ``Old Milwaukee and Heileman are losing their market share. We
think they're vulnerable,'' he added.
   Emanuel Goldman, an analyst with Paine-Webber in San Francisco,
said Coors' strategy makes sense in the highly competitive industry.
   ``It's a good-sized business. Stroh and Heileman are having a
difficult time of it. Coors has to be in it,'' he said.
   Old Milwaukee sells for less than $5 for a 12-pack in the Denver
area. Premium beers sell for more than $6 a 12-pack, with imports
going for more than $7.

   The nation's unemployment rate edged up a notch
to 5.3 percent in June as businesses created a modest 180,000 new
jobs, the government said today in yet another sign that the economy
is slowing.
   The civilian jobless rate was up from May's 5.2 percent, the
Labor Department said.
   The report said the bulk of the 180,000 new non-farm jobs added
last month came in the service sector, and the government revised
its May job-growth total to 207,000, more than double the total
given in a preliminary report last month.
   There were clear signs in the report of a slowing economy and an
indication as well of an easing of wage inflation that has troubled
some analysts.
   The Labor Department said the average factory work week slipped
0.1 of an hour to 40.9 hours last month, the first time this
indicator has fallen below 41 hours since September 1987.
   Average hourly earnings of production and supervisory workers
were essentially unchanged. For the first five months of the year,
hourly wages had grown on average by 0.3 percent.
   Many economists had expected an upward revision of the May
payroll expansion totals, but the 180,000 figure for June was below
most predictions. Still, it was likely not low enough to raise fears
that the economy has slowed to the verge of recession.
   ``On balance I'd say it's another sign of a weakening economy,''
Merrill Lynch analyst Bruce Steinberg said of the unemployment
report. ``The slowdown in the industrial sector is becoming more
pronounced.''
   For the past four months business added an average of just below
200,000 jobs a month, well below the average monthly gain of the
past year.
   The June unemployment report _ the first comprehensive look at
economic activity last month _ showed that the service sector
continues as the source of the overwhelming number of new jobs while
manufacturing continues to struggle.
   Service-producing industries added 231,000 new jobs last month,
with business and health services and wholesale and retail trade all
posting modest gains.
   Some of that growth was offset, however, by a decline of 31,000
manufacturing jobs and 8,000 construction jobs despite the summer
weather.
   Those figures are gleaned from the Labor Department's monthly
survey of businesses.
   The department's separate household survey, used to set the
unemployment rate, found that the civilian labor force grew by
492,000 people from May to June, to a total of 124.1 million.
   Of that group, 117.5 million held jobs and 6.5 million were
looking for work but could not find it.
   Steinberg of Merrill Lynch attributed the service-sector growth
mainly to summer jobs for students.
   He said it appeared that Federal Reserve policymakers had eased
monetary policy again Thursday for the second time in recent weeks.
And he said there was nothing in today's report to change the
central bank's new stance, which comes after months of keeping a
tight hold on credit in hopes of curbing growth and taming inflation.
   ``The Fed has apparently shifted gears now and it views the risk
of a recession as more pronounced than the risk of inflation,''
Steinberg said.
   Among most demographic groups, the unemployment rate was
unchanged or up just slightly, although increases in joblessness
were reported for teen-agers in general and black female teen-agers
in particular. The rate for the latter group shot up from 28 percent
in May to more than 40 percent last month.
   Among all teen-agers the unemployment rate rose from 15.2 percent
to 15.6 percent. That came as the labor force for that age group
grew by more than 100,000, apparently due to an influx of students
into the summer labor market.
   The government said blacks made up the bulk of the new teen-agers
in the labor force. In contrast to young black women, male black
teen-agers had some success in finding jobs as their unemployment
rate fell more than three percentage points to a still-high 33.5
percent.
   In a separate calculation of unemployment that includes military
personnel based in the United States, the jobless rate climbed to
5.2 percent in June from 5.1 percent in May.
   The civilian jobless rate has been hovering in the 5 percent
range for more than a year. It was 5.4 percent in June 1988 and fell
to a more than 15-year low of 5.0 percent in March before heading
upward.
   In its analysis of the report, the Bureau of Labor Statistics
made no mention of a number of factors economists said could skew
the June data, primarily a quarterly blip in the period between the
survey's used to compile the report.
   The Labor Department conducts the surveys in the week of the
month that includes the 12th. Those weeks usually fall four weeks
apart, but four times a year _ including last month _ they come five
weeks apart.

   RJR Nabisco Inc. announced Friday it has sold its
biscuit and food businesses in India and Pakistan, the latest move
in a continuing effort to reduce the debt from its record $24.53
billion leveraged buyout.
   The sale of Associated Biscuits International Limited to
Britannia Industries Pte. Ltd. of Singapore is valued at about $44
million. ABIL, based in England, owns about 38 percent of Britannia
Industries in India and 40 percent of English Biscuit Manufacturers
Ltd. in Pakistan.
   ``The sale of RJR Nabisco's biscuit and related food business
interests in India and Pakistan marks a further step in our planned
divestiture program to lower overall corporate debt,'' said company
Chairman Louis V. Gerstner Jr.
   ``Under (Britannia Chairman J.M. Rajan) Pillai's ongoing
management, these operations should continue their excellent
performance and build on their market-leading positions in India and
Pakistan.''
   Britannia, India's largest biscuit and baking company, had 1988
pre-tax earnings of $10 million. The company also operates soybean
and export divisions.
   English Biscuit, a private company, is the leading biscuit
producer in Pakistan.
   RJR Nabisco has annual interest payments of about $3 billion as a
result of the debt-financed buyout completed earlier this year by
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. The company has said it would sell
various assets to reduce that debt, and last month announced the
sale of five of its European units for $2.5 billion.
   The announcement of the ABIL sale was made in New York, where the
top executives of the food and tobacco company have set up offices
as part of the move of its headquarters from Atlanta.

<HEAD>Experts Say Bond Rally Will Lose Steam During Second Half</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BART ZIEGLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bond prices rallied to a two-year high during the
second quarter of the year. But economists and analysts say they
aren't optimistic about the streak continuing through the rest of
the year.
   ``Our feeling is that the bond market has overreacted,'' said
Kathleen Cooper, chief economist for Security Pacific National Bank
in Los Angeles. ``It tends to get carried away at times. I think
this was one of those times.''
   The market rally began in late March and continued through most
of the April-June quarter, pulling the yield on the bellwether
30-year Treasury bond from about 9.30 percent in late March to 8.03
percent on June 30. Bond prices move in the opposite direction from
yields.
   Ms. Cooper believes there will be a correction, in which bond
prices will fall more in line with actual economic conditions.
   She says bond traders expected the economic slowdown to be
greater than she predicts it actually will be. A slower economy is
good for bonds because it usually eases inflation, which erodes the
value of fixed-return investments such as bonds.
   Ms. Cooper also believes bond traders expect the Federal Reserve
Board will ease monetary policy more than she thinks it actually
will. The Fed encourages an increase in the supply of money to
stimulate the economy when it senses a downturn. More money usually
translates into lower interest rates, which boost bond prices.
   Elliott Platt, chief economist for Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette
Securities Corp., believes the bond rally has a few more months of
steam left, ``but the bulk of the rally is behind us.''
   He predicts the bond market would remain bullish through the
current quarter because of continuing signs that the economy is
slowing, which eases inflation.
   ``I think the long bond (the 30-year Treasury) is going to
challenge and for a brief period break through the 8 percent mark,''
he said last week.
   But by year end, he predicts, the 30-year Treasury will be
yielding 8.50 percent. Ms. Cooper was slightly more bullish,
predicting the long bond would yield 8.25 percent by the end of the
year.
   Working in favor of bond prices in the next six months, experts
predict, will be an easing of monetary policy by the Fed, slower
economic growth and slower growth in the rate of inflation.
   Working against the market could be a depreciation in the dollar,
which could blunt the fall in inflation and limit incentives for
foreign investors to buy U.S. bonds, which in turn would lower
demand for the securities and soften their prices.
   James Kochan, chief fixed-income strategist for Merrill Lynch &amp;
Co. Inc., credits ``technical factors'' in part for this spring's
rally.
   Those factors, he said, were the popularity of zero-coupon
Treasury bonds and long-maturity municipal bonds. As the supply of
these bonds was depleted due to the demand, their prices rose, said
Kochan.
   Zero-coupon bonds lack the interest-bearing portion of regular
bonds. Demand for the zeros increased in the March-April period as
reports indicated the economy was slowing, Kochan said. A similar
increase in demand for long-maturity municipal bonds also pushed up
their price, he said.
   Since then, demand for Treasury zeros and long municipals has
weakened, Kochan said, while the supply of these securities has
increased, eliminating this as a factor in the bond market.
   But Kochan is more optimistic about the market's performance
during the second half than Platt and Ms. Cooper. He predicts the
30-year Treasury bond will yield 7.75 percent by the end of the year.
   As to where individual investors should put their money, Kochan
recommends municipal bonds with maturities of 10 years or more, as
well as municipal zero-coupon bonds in this maturity range. He also
suggests mortgage-backed securities.
   Platt cautions investors who missed the bond rally ``to be
disciplined and resigned to the fact that they missed.''
   He believes investors should avoid jumping into the long-maturity
bond market with expectations of continued price gains. Instead, he
said, they should buy shorter-duration issues, which would benefit
more if the Fed eases monetary policy.

   Grain and soybean futures prices were mostly lower
in early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade in response to
forecasts for cooler, wetter weather in the Midwest next week.
   Some selling may also have reflected pre-weekend
position-adjusting by traders reluctant to go home holding ``buy''
positions amid uncertainty about the weather.
   ``This is a very nervous market,'' said Dale Gustafson, an
analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in Chicago.
   Prices rallied strongly earlier in the week on predictions of an
extended heat wave in the Corn Belt but some forecasters have since
offered more moderate outlooks.
   A change to cooler, wetter weather would be particularly good for
the corn crop, analysts said.
   Wheat futures retreated in early trading on weather forecasts
favorable for winter-wheat harvesting.
   In early trading, wheat was 1 cent to 1{ cents lower with the
contract for delivery in July at $4.04 a bushel; corn was 3\ cents
lower to 1 cent higher with July at $2.75{ a bushel; oats were
unchanged to { cent lower with July at $1.60 a bushel; soybeans were
7 cents lower to 3{ cents higher with July at $7.68{ a bushel.
   Cattle futures were mostly lower while pork futures were mixed in
early trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were unchanged to .48 cent lower with August at 69.92
cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged to .25 cent lower with
August at 81 cents a pound; live hogs were .30 cent lower to .30
cent higher with July at 47.07 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies
were .85 cent lower to .33 cent higher with July at 30.80 cents a

   Cattle futures settled mixed on Thursday while pork futures

   A coal company whose contract with the
United Mine Workers includes a no-strike clause has fired 28 wildcat
strikers who refused to return to work, the first firings of the
four-week wildcat walkout, officials said today.
   The company couldn't hold a formal hearing on the firings late
this morning in Beckley, because 2,000 UMW members blocked a meeting
hall. Representatives of Toney's Branch Coal Co. and the UMW refused
to cross a picket line that surrounded the Raleigh County Armory.
   Dismissal forms given the workers said they were fired for
refusing to cross pickets at Toney's Branch's mine in Racine. The
delay in the formal hearing does not mean the firings are postponed.
   ``This should tell them that all it's going to do is incite the
workers,'' UMW international executive board member Howard Green
said in a telephone interview from Beckley.
   Earlier, officials at Toney's Branch headquarters in Beckley
refused to comment on the dismissals beyond saying the company was a
member of the Bituminous Coal Operators Association, which in
February 1988 signed a UMW contract that included a no-strike
clause. A coal industry manual says there are 56 employees at the
Toney Branch's Racine mine, but does not specify how many are UMW
members.
   The dismissals are the first during a four-week wildcat sympathy
strike by UMW members backing colleagues at the Pittston Co. who
have been on strike since April. Pittston, unlike most other coal
companies, has no contract with the UMW, and the union has
sanctioned that strike but not the wildcat walkout at other
companies.
   As many as 46,000 miners in 10 states have stayed off the job at
one time or another since the unauthorized walkouts began June 12.
Today, about 37,000 miners in eight states were off their jobs.
   A two-week vacation period for many miners ends at midnight
Sunday and several locals have discussed or plan to consider
returning to work, fearing what happened to the Toney's Branch
miners.
   ``Some of them think if this goes down the drain, miners might be
in bad shape _ they (coal companies) might bust the union,'' said
Charlie Greer, the president of a UMW local that represents
Zanesville, Ohio-area miners.
   U.S. Sen. Robert Byrd said Thursday he wanted Labor Secretary
Elizabeth Dole to step in and help end the strikes.
   Byrd, D-W.Va., said Dole should ask UMW President Richard Trumka
and Pittston Chairman Paul Douglas to settle their organizations'
differences so that 1,900 striking Pittston miners can return to
work.
   The union and the company haven't been at the bargaining table
for several weeks now.

<HEAD>High Voltage Raises Offer for Universal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   High Voltage Engineering Corp., which has been
pursuing Milwaukee-based Universal Foods Corp. since last year,
announced today it was willing to raise its offer to $42 a share.
   Laurence Levy, chairman of High Voltage, based in Burlington,
Mass., said his company delivered a letter to Universal's board of
directors, offering to buy the company in a negotiated transaction.
   ``We are attempting to negotiate with them because we think that
is a better route,'' said Evan Zeppos, a spokesman for High Voltage
in Milwaukee.
   High Voltage currently has a $38 per share cash tender offer for
Universal, but only about 30 percent of the stockholders have
tendered their shares, according to a statement last week from
Universal.
   ``We remain committed to the acquisition of Universal,'' the
letter from High Voltage said. ``We would like to meet with you at
your earliest convenience to complete the negotiation of the merger
agreement.''
   A Universal spokeswoman said the company had no immediate
response to the offer.
   High Voltage began its quest for Universal last December with an
offer of $30.50 per share. The proposal, however, has been rejected
by Universal's board of directors.
   High Voltage challenged an anti-takeover law in Wisconsin that
essentially blocks bidders from making direct contact with
shareholders unless the company's management approves.
   The law was upheld this year by the 7th Circuit U.S. Court of
Appeals in Chicago, although the decision stated: ``Wisconsin's law
may well be folly; we are confident that it is constitutional.''
   In its letter to Universal, High Voltage said, ``the court noted
that bidders could seek to require that directors fulfill their
fiduciary obligations as they relate to the (anti-takeover)
statute.''
   ``I think they will find this offer very generous and it will
force them to take a look at it,'' Zeppos said.
   Investment analysts said $42 per share, which would amount to
about $640 million, would be a strong offer, but they said the
outcome was hard to predict.
   ``I would hope the Universal Foods board would now initiate some
sort of discussions,'' said Richard Elam, a food industry analyst
with Blunt Ellis &amp; Loewi Inc. in Chicago.
   Clinton Mayer, an analyst with Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. in New York,
said he did not foresee any quick resolution.
   He noted that the smaller, individual stockholders have been more
reluctant to part with their shares than the larger, institutional
investors.
   ``The stock seems to be held by conservative investors who don't
seem concerned with short-term prices,'' Mayer said.

<TEXT>
   Share prices rose sharply Friday on the London
Stock Exchange, boosted by evidence of a slowing U.S. economy as
well as a stronger British pound.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index ended 27.9
points, or 1.29 percent, higher at 2,189.1, its best level of the
day.
   For the week, the key index gained 38.1 points, or 1.8 percent.
   The narrower Financial Times 30-share index was up 20.3 points at
1,815.0. The Financial Times 500 closed 13.87 points higher at
1,246.12.
   Volume was heavy as 774.8 million shares changed hands, up
sharply from 563.5 million on Thursday. However, more than a third
of Friday's volume resulted from aggressive buying of shares in
Gateway Corp. PLC by Newgateway PLC, which is bidding 2.2 billion
pounds for the food retailer.
   Share prices rose at the start of trading, helped by the activity
in Gateway shares and by speculation that other companies in the
food sector also could be targeted for takeover.
   Analysts said the advance was extended after the release of U.S.
employment data for June, which showed growth slowing more than had
been expected. Countering this, however, was an upward revision in
May's pace of job growth.
   ``There was conflicting evidence in today's (employment) figures.
But overall it's pointing to the economy slowing down,'' said one
London dealer. Wall Street also rose briskly after a hesitant
opening, further underpinning the London market's performance, he
said.
   The dollar ended lower against the pound following the U.S.
employment report, giving the British currency a chance to extend
its recent gains. That eased market concerns about the outlook for
British interest rates, analysts said.
   The pound was quoted late in the day at $1.6245, up from $1.6220
late Thursday in London.

   The government rested its case Friday in the
first securities racketeering trial after playing a tape of a former
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. trader telling a Princeton-Newport
Partners LP executive after an alleged illegal deal: ``Welcome to
the world of being a sleaze.''
   Also, defense lawyers declined Friday to cross-examine Drexel
Chief Executive Frederick H. Joseph for fear of introducing into
evidence potentially damaging information about Drexel's $650
million plea deal with the government.
   The ``sleaze'' tape was one of 14 conversations played by federal
prosecutors at the closely watched Wall Street fraud trial of five
partners in Princeton-Newport, a defunct brokerage, and ex-Drexel
trader Bruce Lee Newberg.
   The tape involves charges that Newberg told Princeton-Newport to
sell blocks of stock in C.O.M.B. Co. to try to drive its share price
below $16 in 1985 before a $25 million Drexel bond offering to the
Minneapolis-based merchandiser.
   ``I want you to, you know, get rid of it,'' Newberg told
Princeton-Newport partner Charles M. Zarzecki on April 11, 1985. ``I
want you to get it down to at least 15} at least, and hopefully
lower.''
   Zarzecki later that day told Newberg he sold 40,000 shares of the
stock through another party in an attempt to drive the price down.
   Newberg: ``Agreed, uh, that was good. ... You're a sleaze bag.''
   Zarzecki: ``You taught me man. ... Hey, listen turkey.''
   Newberg: ``Welcome to the world of being a sleaze.''
   After playing the tape to the jury of nine women and three men,
prosecutors rested their case.
   Zarzecki's lawyer, Paul Grand, told U.S. District Judge Robert L.
Carter that certain charges against his client should be dismissed
because C.O.M.B.'s stock never fell below $16.
   Grand said disclosure of the transaction was unnecessary because
the stock was traded in the over-the-counter market, which is
governed by different rules than major exchanges.
   Other defense lawyers asked Carter to throw out a bevy of mail
fraud, wire fraud and racketeering charges. The judge did not
immediately rule on the requests, but indicated he was uncertain
about some of the government's charges.
   The C.O.M.B. deal also played a major role in defense lawyers'
decision not to cross-examine Joseph, who took the stand Thursday
for the first time in a Wall Street corruption case.
   Under questioning from Assistant U.S. Attorney Mark Hansen,
Joseph described Drexel compliance systems and practices for
underwriting securities such as convertible bonds, the kind used in
the C.O.M.B. transaction.
   Defense lawyers said Friday that cross-examining Joseph in an
attempt to show that the C.O.M.B. transactions were harmless could
have opened the door for the government to introduce Drexel's $650
settlement of securities law charges reached last December.
   The government is barred from introducing the Drexel deal as
evidence because it is unrelated. Defense lawyers did not want to
risk mentioning the deal because for fear it would have prejudiced
the jury against Princeton-Newport.
   One of six felony counts to which Drexel has agreed to plead
guilty involved the C.O.M.B. transaction.
   In addition to Newberg and Zarzecki, on trial are
Princeton-Newport partners James Sutton Regan, Jack Z. Rabinowitz
and Paul A. Berkman, and the firm's controller, Steven B. Smotrich.
   The case overlaps the government's 98-count fraud and
racketeering indictment of former Drexel financier Michael Milken.
Much of the same evidence is expected to be introduced at Milken's
trial, scheduled to begin in March 1990.
   Princeton-Newport, a small securities firm with offices in
Princeton, N.J., and Newport Beach, Calif., went out of business
after the indictment was brought last August. Neither
Princeton-Newport nor Drexel is charged in the case.

   The stock market jumped ahead today, posting its

   Grain and soybean futures prices closed mostly
lower Friday on the Chicago Board of Trade, reflecting an increased
likelihood of rain in the Midwest this weekend and late next week.
   Prices had opened higher on forecasts Thursday for mostly hot and
dry weather in the Corn Belt through next week. But attitudes
changed after some private meteorologists reported a weakening of
the high-pressure ``ridge'' that has prevented showers and cool
temperatures from reaching the Midwest this week.
   ``I think people came in this morning feeling comfortable about
buying the market and expecting higher prices next week, but when
the weathermen started adding precipitation, they all lost their
courage,'' said Steve Freed, a grain-market analyst in Chicago with
Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   Weather concerns continue to dominate the grain and soybean
markets, as is the rule for the growing season.
   ``This is a very nervous market,'' said Dale Gustafson, an
analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in Chicago.
   At the close of trading, wheat was { cent to 4{ cents lower with

<TEXT>
   The Federal Reserve, faced with further signs
of a weakening economy, launched a second round of credit easing
this week even before the end of a crucial midyear review of
monetary policy, private economists said Friday.
   The analysts predicted that the move would send a variety of
consumer and business interest rates lower, with one saying that a
cut in commercial bank's prime lending rate could come as early as
Monday.
   ``The Fed is easing and there is clear evidence that we have
passed the peak on interest rates,'' said David Wyss, an economist
with DRI-McGraw Hill, an economic consulting firm in Lexington, Mass.
   The development was not unexpected, although some economists were
surprised that the move came even before the end of two days of
meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee, composed of members
of the Federal Reserve Board in Washington and five of the 12
regional Fed bank presidents.
   The committee meets eight times a year to map monetary strategy
and many had expected that the central bank would begin another
round of easing moves in the period following this week's meeting.
   At the previous meeting, held on May 16, Fed policy-makers
decided to leave credit conditions unchanged. They noted a variety
of economic statistics pointing to slower growth, according to
minutes of that meeting released Friday.
   The ``no-change'' decision was adopted on an 11-1 vote with
Thomas Melzer, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis,
dissenting. Melzer argued that unless the central bank eased
immediately it ran the danger of increasing the possibility of a
recession.
   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan will reveal details of
this week's discussions when he delivers the Fed's midyear
assessment of the economy in congressional testimony on July 20.
   David Jones, an economist with Aubrey G. Lanston &amp; Co., a
government securities dealer, said the Fed is acting because a
growing number of business barometers confirm that economic growth
is slowing.
   The Labor Department reported Friday that the nation's
unemployment rate climbed to 5.3 percent in June, reflecting
continued declines in manufacturing and construction. The uptick in
the jobless rate follows other statistics showing weak auto sales, a
plunge in orders for manufactured goods and lackluster retail sales.
   Jones said he expected the looser credit environment would mean
that banks will cut their prime lending rate, perhaps as early as
Monday. Banks dropped the prime to its current 11 percent in early
June. The prime rate, traditinally considered a benchmark for
business loans, now influences a variety of consumer loans,
including home equity loans.
   Economists based their belief that the Fed is easing credit on a
slight decline in the federal funds rate, which edged down 0.25
percent to 9.25 percent in the past two days.
   The federal funds rate, the interest that banks charge each other
to make overnight loans, is influenced by daily decisions the
central bank makes on how much money to make available to the
banking system. It is considered the best early-warning signal of
Fed intentions to loosen or tighten credit conditions.
   The funds rate first dropped on Thursday to the 9.25 percent
level and it held at that lower level on Friday, convincing many
economists that the central bank had eased. It would mark the second
move toward lower interest rates in recent weeks.
   The funds rate had dropped from 9.75 percent to 9.5 percent in
early June.
   Greenspan and the other members of the Fed have been under
pressure from Congress and the administration to let interest rates
fall as a way of keeping the economy out of a recession.
   The Fed has been struggling to engineer a soft-landing where
growth slows enough to dampen inflationary pressures but without a
recession.
   Wyss said he believed the odds were still 2-1 that the central
bank would be successful in avoiding a recession this year.
   ``The Fed seems to be on track for a soft-landing,'' Wyss said.
He said Friday's unemployment report was particularly encouraging
because it showed that average hourly earnings, a good barometer of
wage pressures, showed only a moderate increase last month.

   Visions of renewed declines in interest rates
provided the inspiration for a broad advance in the stock market
Friday.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 25.42 points to
2,487.86, stretching its advance for a holiday-shortened week of
four consecutive gains to 47.80 points.
   Issues rising in price outnumbered losers by more than 2 to 1 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
1,064 up, 472 down and 458 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 166.43 million
shares, up from 140.45 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those
stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market,
totaled 195.24 million shares.
   The market opened on a hesitant note, but then picked up steam at
midsession as traders concluded that the Labor Department's
employment report for June had apparently encouraged the Federal
Reserve to relax its credit policy.
   The report showed an increase of 180,000 in nonfarm payroll
employment, below most advance estimates.
   The figures for May were revised to show a gain of 207,000, more
than double the 101,000 originally reported a month ago. Still,
brokers said, Wall Streeters came increasingly to believe that the
Fed interpreted the data as reason enough to ease up on its credit
restraints.
   Interest rates fell in the credit markets. Prices of long-term
Treasury bonds rose more than $5 for each $1,000 in face value,
reducing their yields to the 8.03 percent-8.06 percent range.
   That helped fuel speculation that major banks might soon announce
new reductions in their prime lending rates.
   Gainers among the blue chips included American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph, up { at 35~; Coca-Cola, up 1{ at 58]; Philip Morris, up |
at 141[; General Electric, up 1 at 53|, and International Business
Machines, up { at 112[.
   An exception was General Motors, down } at 40[ on word of new
cutbacks in the company's production plans for the third quarter.
   Honeywell climbed 4| to 77} on takeover speculation fueled by a
column in Business Week magazine.
   UAL, also buffeted by continuing takeover rumors, jumped 13{ to
166. Among other leading airline issues, Delta Air Lines gained 1~
to 72 and AMR was up \ at 64\.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $30.43 billion, or 0.96
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks gained
1.74 to 181.56.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 3.68 to 370.87, and S&amp;P's
500-stock composite index was up 3.36 at 324.91.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market added
2.85 to 442.42. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 363.75, up 2.64.

<HEAD>Tsutsumi Tops Forbes Billionaires List Third Straight Year</HEAD>
<HEAD>Embargoed By Source For Release After 6:30 p.m. EDT Sunday, July

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Six of the 10 richest people in the world are
Japanese but the United States still leads the world in the total
number of billionaires, according to estimates compiled by Forbes
magazine.
   For the third year running, Yoshiaki Tsutsumi led Forbes' list of
private billionaires even though his wealth wasn't quite as much as
it had been 12 months earlier.
   Tsutsumi, head of Japan's Seibu Railway Group, has a personal net
worth of at least $15 billion, over $3 billion less than estimated
last summer due mainly to a rise in the dollar against other major
currencies, Forbes said Sunday.
   The estimate was far greater than that made by Fortune magazine
in its September 1988 ranking of those it considered the world's
richest people _ which valued Tsutsumi's holdings at a mere $2.8
billion.
   In last year's list, Forbes estimated Tsutsumi's net worth was
$18.9 billion.
   The magazine reports in its July 24 issue that Tsutsumi edged out
second-ranked Taikichiro Mori by less than $1 billion.
   Mori, a former economics professor who owns 72 office buildings
in Tokyo, has an estimated net worth of $14.2 billion. In last
year's survey, Forbes placed Mori's worth at about $18 billion.
   The third-richest on the list was American Sam Moore Walton,
founder of the third largest retailer in the United States, Wal-Mart
Stores Inc. Walton and his family are worth an estimated $8.7
billion, up from Forbes' 1988 estimate of $6.5 billion.
   After the Waltons came Canada's Reichmann brothers, owners of the
Olympia &amp; York real estate empire, with a combined net worth of
about $8 billion.
   The rest of the 10 richest people in the world, their country and
industries, according to Forbes, were: Shin Kyuk-ho, South Korea,
candy, real estate; Hirotomo Takei and family, Japan, publishing,
real estate; Kitaro Watanabe, Japan, real estate, hotels; Haruhiko
Yoshimoto and family, Japan, real estate; Hans and Gad Rausing,
Sweden, liquids packaging; and Eitaro Itoyama, Japan, land.
   Forbes said it identified 226 individuals or families around the
world with personal assets worth over $1 billion.
   The United States was the country with the most billionaires,
with 55 individuals qualifying for that title. Japan ranked second,
with 41, and West Germany was third with 20.
   American also accounted for the most billionaires in the 1988
survey, with 47 individuals, followed by Japan's 32 and West
Germany's 16.
   Among the richest of the world's rich were people who didn't
necessarily come by their money in an honest way.
   Colombia's cocaine barons, for instance, are still putting away
piles of money from selling the illegal drug even though profit
margins in the cocaine trade have been shrinking during recent years.
   Three of them made Forbes ``World Billionaires'' list including
Pablo Escobar Gaviria, leader of the notorious Medellin cocaine
cartel, with an estimated personal net worth of $3 billion. The
other cocaine kingpins on the list were the Ochoa family, worth more
than $2 billion, and Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, with more than $1
billion.
   In compiling its list, Forbes does not consider royal families
and heads of state in compiling its list of wealthy people and
individuals ``because their wealth derives more from political
heritage than from economic effort _ theirs are feudal fortunes, not
capitalistic ones.''
   The magazine also excludes dictators, such as Cuba's Fidel Castro
or North Korea's Kim Il Sung.

<HEAD>Wilkinson Sword Barred From Showing Ultra Glide Ads</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge Friday temporarily barred
Wilkinson Sword Inc. from airing television commercials for its new
Ultra Glide razor.
   The preliminary injunction was sought by the Gillette Co., which
sued Wilkinson for false advertising in May.
   U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood in Manhattan said Gillette was
``likely to succeed on the merits'' of its allegations that the
commercials misled the public by implying Ultra Glide's shavers were
six times smoother than Gillette's product, Atra Plus.
   In the ads, Atlanta-based Wilkinson says Ultra Glide's special
lubricating strip provided a smoother shave than a similar strip on
Atra Plus.
   Wood's ruling reversed a written opinion she made Thursday
rejecting Gillette's request for the preliminary injunction that
would bar Wilkinson from showing the television commercials.
   She said she reconsidered after reviewing a market study that
found no substantial differences in the smoothness of the two
shaving systems.
   A Wilkinson attorney, Steven E. Levitsky, asked for a stay of the
order because he said its effect would be ``devastating'' to the
company. The commercials are the only television advertising
Wilkinson is currently showing, he said.
   Wilkinson is a small player in the $750 million wet-shave razor
market with about a 4 percent share, compared with more than 60
percent for Gillette.
   Wood declined to stop the injunction, which will be in effect
until the case is resolved. A trial date could be set for later this
summer.
   Boston-based Gillette is seeking undetermined monetary damages.

<HEAD>Dollar Falls Amid Fears of Interest Rate Cuts</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS 8th graf pvs, Rumors circulated... to CORRECT to ``reduce''

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar finished lower against all major
currencies except the Japanese yen Friday after a steady selloff
sparked by fears that interest rates would decline.
   Gold prices also lost ground. On the New York Commodity Exchange,
gold bullion for current delivery slipped to $383.60 a troy ounce
from $386.40 on Thursday. Republic National Bank of New York quoted
a late bid for gold of $382.00 an ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, down from
Thursday's late bid of $384.25.
   Domestic currency trading began with a jolt as the Labor
Department issued a report showing the nation's unemployment rate
climbed 0.1 percent to 5.3 percent last month.
   Traders initially were confused by the specifics of the report,
which showed lower-than-expected non-farm payroll growth coupled
with a sharply higher revision for May.Non-farm businesses added
just 180,000 jobs last month, but May's payroll expansion was
revised upward to 207,000 jobs.
   ``The first reaction was the dollar went up,'' said Kevin Lawrie,
vice president and manager at Bank of Boston's New York office.
   ``But that only lasted five minutes before the dollar came
barreling off,'' he said. The report ultimately depressed the dollar
by serving as yet another example of the economy's slowdown.
   Traders said the dollar remained under pressure from the
fundamental threat it has faced throughout the week: the prospect of
lower interest rates. Dollar-denominated securities like bonds are
more expensive when interest rates edge lower, which depresses the
need for dollars to purchase them.
   Rumors circulated through the market that the Federal Reserve may
be preparing to reduce its discount rate before the weekend.
   ``We got a lot of (dollar) selling this afternoon,'' said Stephen
Flanagan, a vice president at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co.
   Flanagan did not attribute the selloff solely to the unemployment
report, however. He stressed instead that the report ``set the stage
for upcoming statistics due out next week'' by suggesting that
further weakness in the economy is likely.
   The government is scheduled to report on industrial production,
factory use and retail sales next week. Each bearish report gives
the Federal Reserve a greater incentive to trim interest rates.
   Earlier in Tokyo, the dollar closed at 139.65 Japanese yen, up
from 138.90 yen. Later in London, the dollar inched up to 139.75
yen. In New York the dollar rose to finish at 139.20 yen, up from
138.88 yen late Thursday.
   In London, one British pound cost $1.6245 late Friday, more
expensive for buyers than late Thursday's $1.6220. In New York it
cost $1.6313 to buy one pound, more expensive than $1.6265 late
Thursday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Thursday,
included: 1.8705 West German marks, down from 1.8850; 1.6095 Swiss
francs, down from 1.6175; 6.3505 French francs, down from 6.3935;
1,355.00 Italian lire, down from 1,365.50, and 1.1908 Canadian
dollars, down from 1.1917.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Thursday,
included: 1.8840 West German marks, down from 1.8885; 1.6200 Swiss
francs, down from 1.6210; 6.3915 French francs, down from 6.4070;
2.1272 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1310; 1,368.00 Italian lire, down
from 1,370.50, and 1.1907 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1919.
   Traders noted that European currency markets appeared to shut
down earlier than usual.
   Gold closed in London at a bid of $385.25 a troy ounce, down from
$386.25 on Thursday, in light trading. The late bid price in Zurich,
Switzerland, was $384.60, down from $385.00. Earlier in Hong Kong,
gold closed at $383.75 bid, down from $384.45.
   Silver prices were mixed. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for
current delivery fell to $5.209 a troy ounce from $5.377 on
Thursday. Earlier in London, silver traded at a late bid price of
$5.37 a troy ounce, up from $5.36.

<HEAD>Bond Prices Climb</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bond prices climbed Friday, pushed up by June
employment data that provided more evidence of a slowing economy.
   The Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond rose about 21-32
point, or $6.50 for every $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which
moves in the opposite direction from price, declined to 8.03 from
8.09 percent late Thursday.
   The Labor Department reported that the nation's unemployment rate
edged up to 5.3 percent in June from 5.2 percent in May as
businesses created a modest 180,000 new jobs. There were signs in
the report that economic growth is cooling and an indication as well
of an easing of the wage inflation that has troubled some analysts.
   Nancy Vanden Houten, money-market economist for Merrill Lynch
Capital Markets in New York, said the increases in non-farm payroll
and hourly earnings were below market expectations.
   ``The consensus was about 225,000 and there was only a one-cent
increase in hourly earnings,'' she said. ``The market for a long
time has been focusing on signs of inflation. That definitely was
positive news in terms of inflation.''
   Average hourly earnings of production and supervisory workers
were essentially unchanged, after rising an average 0.3 percent in
the first five months of the year, the government said.
   The report was one of many in recent weeks that suggested the
economy is easing off its brisk pace of the last several years and
underscored a widely-held belief that the Federal Reserve might now
allow short-term interest rates to decline.
   Jay Goldinger, a principal at the investment firm Capital Insight
in Beverly Hills, Calif., said despite the gains market activity was
volatile in thin dealings as traders anticipated the Fed's next move.
   ``Some investors didn't know what to do with the (employment)
numbers,'' Goldinger said. ``The market was confused over whether
the Fed would ease. That caused the bond market to be more volatile
than usual.''
   The Fed has kept a tight grip on credit by encouraging higher
interest rates in recent months in hopes of curbing growth and
taming inflation. Inflation erodes the value of fixed-income
securities such as bonds and notes. Higher interest rates also
depress bond prices.
   Market observers noted on Thursday that the Fed had eased policy
as indicated by a declining federal funds rate and the fact that the
central bank had not drained reserves from the banking system.
   In the secondary market for Treasury securities, prices of
short-term government issues rose between 3-16 point and 7-32 point,
intermediate maturities gained between 7-32 point and \ point and
20-year issues advanced between 11-32 point and 19-32 point,
according to Telerate Inc., a financial information service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Hutton Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, rose 3.31 to 1,190.16.
   In corporate trading, industrials rose. Moody's Investment Grade
Corporate Bond Index, which measures total return on a portfolio of
80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer, gained
0.97 to 328.76.
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds closed at 94 11-16, up 3-16 from Thursday.
The average yield to maturity slipped to 7.19 percent from 7.20
percent late Thursday.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills fell to 7.96 percent as the
discount dropped 8 points to 7.71 percent. Yields on six-month bills
declined to 7.86 percent as the discount tumbled 7 basis points to

   Prices for crude oil and gasoline rose while
heating oil declined Friday as a skittish energy futures market
continued to respond to reports of labor strife in Europe.
   The August contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
grade of U.S. crude, rose 45 cents to close at $20.75 a barrel on
the New York Mercantile Exchange after falling 46 cents on Thursday.
   Wholesale unleaded gasoline for August delivery picked up 0.32
cent to settle at 56.59 cents a gallon after falling 1.15 cents
Thursday.
   And the August contract for home heating oil fell 0.12 cent to
close at 49.77 cents a gallon after slipping 1.17 cents in
Thursday's session.
   Andrew Lebow, an analyst with E.D.&amp;F. Man International Futures
Inc., said the market seemed to be gyrating within a broad trading
range amid light volume.
   News that British dockworkers were calling a strike for Monday
set off fears in the market that oil exports from the North Sea
might be curtailed, Lebow said.
   Energy futures prices have bounced up and down this week in
response to other labor problems affecting North Sea oil operations,
but Lebow said it was unlikely the dockworkers' action could have a
major impact on exports.
   ``I think the market is at this point confused about its
direction,'' Lebow said.

   A Canadian partnership making a hostile bid for
control of U.S.-based Dunkin' Donuts Inc. said Friday it has
arranged $275 million in financing to back its offer to shareholders.
   Cara Operations Ltd. and The Kingsbridge Capital Group said the
financing, in addition to the equity each of them is putting up,
will be enough to fund its cash bid of $43 for each outstanding
Dunkin' Donuts share.
   The offer is worth $305.3 million.
   This latest bid for Dunkin' Donuts, which has 1,700 doughnut
franchises in the United States, was made June 15 and rejected last
week by the company's board. An earlier friendly bid in May was also
turned down.
   The partnership, under the name DD Acquisition Corp., has said
the offer is conditional on acquiring 50.1 per cent of the
outstanding 7.1 million common shares of Dunkin' Donuts. The offer
expires July 13.
   Financing was arranged through Toronto-based Trilon Financial
Corp. and its merchant bank affiliate, Great Lakes Group. Inc., the
partners said in a statement on Friday.
   Cara is a Canadian food-service company that owns chains of
fast-food and family restaurants, such as Swiss Chalet and Harvey's.
Kingsbridge is a Canadian-based merchant bank that already owns
about 12 per cent of Dunkin' Donuts shares.
   Dunkin' Donuts is based in Randolph, Mass.

<HEAD>Appeals Court Rebuffs FCC on State Oversight of Telephone Wiring</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY ARNOLD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court Friday rebuffed an
attempt by the Federal Communications Commission to revoke state
oversight of on-premise telephone wiring and maintenance.
   The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit,
ruling on a complaint by the National Association of Regulatory
Utility Commissioners, said the FCC could step into matters of state
telephone regulation only when state rules interfere with the FCC's
regulation of interstate phone service.
   The court found that the FCC in 1987 exceeded its authority when
it pre-empted state regulation of the ``inside wiring'' business _
the on-premise wiring that connects residential and single-line
business customers to the telephone network.
   The court said the FCC may pre-empt state authority only ``to the
degree necessary to keep such regulation from negating the
commission's exercise of its lawful authority over interstate
communication service.''
   The court ordered the FCC to reconsider the inside wiring matter.
   The opinion was written by Circuit Judge James L. Buckley, and
was joined by Judges Spottswood W. Robinson III and Abner J. Mikva.
   However, the court agreed with the FCC that the commission may
proscribe state regulations that would result in the subsidization
of the installation and maintenance of inside wiring by the general
ratepayers because it would allow the phone companies to undercut
competition.
   The court said the FCC may, for example, force states to separate
the costs of installation and maintenance from basic telephone
service rates.
   The FCC had ordered that inside wiring installation and
maintenance be deregulated and that phone companies be relieved of
the requirement to install and maintain such wiring. The FCC said
individual customers should pay for their own installation and
maintenance and that such costs should not be absorbed into basic
telephone service charges.
   The commission reasoned that deregulation would stimulate new
competition and create a market for ``do-it-yourself'' kits, and
thus lead to savings for customers.
   Under the 1934 Communications Act, the FCC regulates interstate
telephone service and states have authority over intrastate phone
service. But in its deregulation order, the FCC said it must
pre-empt state authority over inside wiring.
   The commission argued that a federal program of competitive,
deregulated inside wiring could not coexist with a regulated state
system unless consumers were required to purchase two sets of inside
wiring _ one for interstate and the other for intrastate use.
   The FCC also said inside wiring was not a ``common carrier''
telephone company service and therefore was not subject to state
regulation.
   NARUC and a host of state utility commissions challenged the FCC
order, saying states should have the right to require phone
companies to be inside wiring installers of last resort and that
do-it-yourself kits are not an acceptable substitute for a trained
installer.

<TEXT>
   Boeing Co. engineers on Thursday were trying to
determine why an aging United Airlines 727 developed a 20-inch crack
in a part of its fuselage.
   The split was in the same general area as the rupture in an Aloha
Airlines 737 that lost part of its roof over Hawaii last year.
However, both Boeing and the Federal Aviation Administration, said
the cracking appeared entirely different from that in the Aloha
plane.
   ``This is a unique situation,'' said FAA spokesman David Duff in
Seattle. ``This is the first time a report of cracking has been made
in this area.''
   Duff added the cracking was not typical of the type often found
in older aircraft, in which tiny cracks tend to form along lines of
rivet holes where sections of the plane's skin overlap.
   The FAA ordered inspections and any necessary repairs of the 47
oldest 727s after the crack was discovered by United inspectors
during a routine maintenance check June 26 at Denver's Stapleton
International Airport.
   United immediately notified the FAA and the 25-year-old plane was
repaired and placed back in service, said United spokesman Rob
Doughty, at the airline's headquarters in Chicago.
   The plane, delivered in February 1964 to United, was the 23rd 727
built, said Boeing Commercial Airplanes spokesman Tom Cole. It had
46,587 landings, a number he characterized as ``not overly high.''
   Airlines have reported three more planes with similar cracks
since the inspections began, bringing the total to four, FAA
spokesman Dave Duff told KIRO Television in Seattle.
   Doughty said the new cracks were ``minor'' compared with the
20-inch crack that led to the FAA order but were in the same general
area. ``They are similar but much smaller cracks,'' he said.
   Operators of the 727s have until July 15 to complete the
inspections. Duff said it was not known how many planes have been
checked so far.
   Preliminary indications are that the cracking in the United 727
was caused by metal fatigue, according to an airworthiness directive
the FAA telegraphed to 727 operators last week.
   Without corrective measures, cracks in the fuselage skin could
result in rapid decompression of the plane in flight, the FAA said.
   The cracked segment was brought to Boeing laboratories in
Seattle, where engineers were trying to understand why it occurred,
Cole said. Analysis probably will take several days, he said.
   The three-engine 727, which Boeing built from 1962 to 1984, was
the best-selling commercial jet before being surpassed by the Boeing
737. Cole said 1,765 727s are still in service, including 41 of the
47 planes covered by the FAA order.
   Operators of the 41 planes were to make the inspections and
report back to the FAA within 15 days, Duff said.
   The April 28, 1988, Aloha accident, in which a flight attendant
fell to her death before the crew could land the badly damaged
plane, focused worldwide attention on aging aircraft. The
19-year-old 737 flown by Aloha was one of the most heavily used 737s
in existence, with nearly 90,000 landings.
   The National Transportation Safety Board said the probable cause
of the accident was the failure of Aloha's maintenance workers to
detect significant disbonding and fatigue damage along the skin of
the twin-engine jet.

   Silver futures prices fell sharply Friday on New York's Commodity
Exchange, partly reflecting the movement of investment dollars out
of precious metals and into the stock market.
   Gold futures also settled lower while copper made strong gains.
   On other markets, coffee futures sank; oil futures rose; grains
and soybeans were lower; and livestock and meat mostly fell.
   Silver settled 16.8 cents to 19.1 cents lower with the contract
for delivery in July at at $5.209 a troy ounce; gold was $2.80 to
$3.90 lower with August at $385.70 a troy ounce.
   Analysts cited a variety of reasons for silver's decline,
including the dollar's recent volatility and disappointment over the
metal's failure to rally as strongly as gold in the past two weeks.
   Tim Evans, a metals trader for Deak International Inc. in New
York, pointed to the stock market's strong advance Friday as a key
to silver's decline.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 25.42 points to
2,487.86, stretching its gain for the week to 47.80 points.
   ``I think the big rally in stocks today indicated there was a
return to be made over there, so you saw money flowing out of the
precious metals and into stocks,'' Evans said.
   Gold's losses were less severe. Evans said silver has been a more
volatile market than gold during the last two years and that ample
supplies of silver make its price more prone to retreats than
rallies.
   Copper futures rose on the Commodity Exchange following an
exchange report that its tally of warehouse stocks of copper had
fallen Thursday by 843 tons, to 21,532 tons.
   A threatened strike by workers at the Highland Valley copper mine
in Canada's British Columbia also supported the market.
   Copper settled 3.1 cents to 3.7 cents higher with July at $1.033
a pound.
   Coffee futures dropped to new 8-year lows on New York's Coffee,
Sugar &amp; Cocoa Exchange on continuing fears that producers will flood
the market with coffee following the suspension of export quotas
Tuesday by the International Coffee Organization, a price-support
group.
   The fears were fanned by reports that officials in Brazil, the
world's largest coffee producer, had removed volume restrictions on
registrations for coffee exports and slashed the coffee export tax
in half, to 6 percent.
   ``They basically are saying to exporters: `Let's push the coffee
out, let's move it, let's sell it,''' said Kim Badenhop, a
coffee-market analyst with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc. in New
York.
   Coffee settled 1.75 cents to 4.88 cents lower with July at 88.50
cents a pound.
   Oil futures rallied on the New York Mercantile Exchange on news
that dockworkers in Britain had voted to strike at 40 ports
beginning Tuesday.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 4 cents to 45 cents
higher with August at 20.75 cents a pound; heating oil was .08 cent
to .12 cent lower with August at 49.77 cents a pound; unleaded
gasoline was .18 cent to .32 cent higher with August at 56.59 cents
a pound.
   Grain and soybean futures ended mostly lower on the Chicago Board
of Trade, reflecting an increased likelihood of rain in the Midwest
this weekend and late next week.
   Wheat settled \ cent to 5 cents lower with July at $4.04} a
bushel; corn was 3\ cents to 4} cents lower with July at $2.74 a
bushel; oats were 1} cents to 4 cents lower with July at $1.57} a
bushel; soybeans were 15{ cents lower to 1{ cents higher with July
at $7.66{ a bushel.
   Most pork futures retreated, although prices for near-month
deliveries advanced, in a continued reaction to a recent quarterly
Agriculture Department report showing a larger U.S. hog herd than
traders had expected.
   Cattle futures fell in a late flurry of selling amid expectations
for lower spot-market prices next week.
   Live cattle were .20 cent to .65 cent lower with August at 69.75
cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent to .35 cent lower with
August at 80.82 cents a pound; live hogs were .48 cent lower to .38
cent higher with July at 47.15 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies
were 1.72 cent lower to .38 cent higher with July at 30.85 cents a
pound.

<HEAD>Forty Banks Agree to Financing for Warner Bid, Time Says</HEAD>

   Time Inc. said Friday it had received financing
commitments from 40 banks for its $14 billion tender offer for
Warner Communications Inc.
   Time, which is pursuing a merger with Warner and trying to fend
off an unwanted $12.2 billion bid from Paramount Communications
Inc., said the banks offered to provide a total of $27.5 billion in
financing. The media giant has said it needs $8.35 billion to
complete the cash portion of its offer for Warner.
   Time is offering $70 a share in cash for half of Warner's 200
million outstanding shares, and will exchange cash and securities
worth $70 a share for the remaining 100 million shares.
   The announcement came as lawyers prepared for a hearing in
Delaware Chancery Court on Tuesday that could determine the outcome
of the three-way struggle for Time.
   Chancery Court Judge William Allen will hear arguments on
Paramount's contention that Time, in agreeing to a friendly
stock-swap merger with Warner earlier this year, put itself up for
sale and therefore must seriously consider the $200 a share
Paramount offer.
   The Time board rejected the Paramount offer as financially
inadequate and too dependent on conditions to be viable.
   Time stock fell $4.12{ a share to $151.50 in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading Friday. Peter Appert, an analyst with
C.J. Lawrence, Morgan Grenfell Inc., said traders were growing
increasingly nervous about Paramount's chances of success as
Tuesday's hearing drew closer.
   Time stock has traded as high has $182.75 in the month since
Paramount announced its offer, but has fallen back as some
investors, fearing the hostile bid will fail, have taken profits.
   Warner stock was unchanged Friday, closing at $61.75 a share,
while Paramount stock slipped 87{ cents to $57 a share.
   Time said it had designated Bankers Trust Co., Manufacturers
Hanover Trust Co., Bank of Boston, Bank of New York Co., Chemical
Banking Corp. and Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. as co-agents to
coordinate the financing for the Warner bid.
   Other banks agreeing to provide financing include Bank of
America, Chase Manhattan Bank, First National Bank of Chicago,
Mellon Bank, Wells Fargo Bank as well as foreign institutions
including Mitsubishi Bank Ltd., Bank of Tokyo Ltd., Sanwa Bank Ltd.,
Swiss Bank Corp. and Barclays Bank PLC.
   Last week, Paramount announced it had lined up seven banks to
serve as co-agents for its offer for Time. Paramount said each of
the banks would contribute $1 billion, or a total of $7 billion,
toward the $15.6 billion estimated financing costs for the bid,
although Paramount did not yet have commitments for the rest of the
money.

<TEXT>
   The Federal Aviation Administration may order
inspections of more older Boeing 727 jetliners as a precaution after
cracks were found in the fuselages of three 727s flown by United
Airlines, an FAA spokesman said Friday.
   Spokesman David Duff said FAA officials were considering
requiring inspections on approximately 400 of the three-engine jets
built by The Boeing Co. in the late 1960s. No cracks have been
reported among those jets, and any inspection would be ``purely a
precautionary and prudent measure by the FAA,'' Duff said.
   If not corrected, the FAA said, the cracks could lead to sudden
decompression of the aircraft cabin.
   The FAA ordered inspections and any necessary repairs of the 47
oldest 727s after United found a 20-inch crack in a 25-year-old jet
during a June 26 maintenance check. United spokesman Rob Doughty
said tiny cracks were found on the two other 727s after the FAA
issued its airworthiness directive June 30.
   All three planes have been repaired, Doughty said. United has 16
jets that required inspection, and the checks were being completed
Friday night, he said.
   Boeing said 41 of the 47 planes are still in service. Among other
carriers flying them are Continental Airlines, with two planes, TWA,
with three, American Airlines, with seven, and Trump Shuttle, with
one. Spokesmen for those companies said most of the planes had been
inspected, with no cracks found.
   The FAA deadline for completing the inspections is July 15. Duff
said he had not received an official report of how many planes had
been checked.
   The 20-inch crack was in the same general area as the break in an
Aloha Airlines 737 that lost part of its top over Hawaii last year,
but Boeing and the FAA said the cracking appeared to be entirely
different.
   ``This is the first time a report of cracking has been made in
this area,'' Duff said, adding that the cracking was not typical of
the type often found in older aircraft.
   Duff said Thursday FAA officials suspect ``hoop tension''
fatigue, caused by outward forces in pressurized flight against the
different thicknesses of aircraft skin where skin sections overlap.
   The cracked segment was brought earlier this week to Boeing
laboratories in Seattle where engineers are trying to find out why
it occurred. Boeing Commercial Airplanes spokesman Jack Gamble said
Friday it probably would take about a week for the analysis to be
completed.
   The three-engine 727, built from 1962 to 1984, was the
best-selling commercial jet before being surpassed by the Boeing
737. Boeing said 1,765 of the 727s are still in service.

   The strike vote was 6,067 in favor and 2,111 against for an
indefinite strike to protest the employers' refusal to allow
national talks after the end of the National Dock Labor Scheme this
week.
   ``Dockers must understand that if they walk out not all of them
will be coming back. That's not a threat, it's economic reality,''
said Nicholas Finney, chairman of the National Association of Port
Employers.
   ``If any registered dock worker is sacked during the course of
the dispute, there can be no return to work until he is
reinstated,'' countered Ron Todd, the union's general secretary.
   The employers, backed by the government, want a shift to local
bargaining with the abolition July 3 of the dock labor plan at 60
ports that handle 70 percent of Britain's trade by volume and 50
percent by value.
   There are 102 ports handling the remainder, some employing fewer
than 25 people.
   The dock labor plan guarantees registered dockworkers a paid job
regardless of whether they have cargoes to handle. It was introduced
during World War II to maintain a steady work force and was made
permanent in 1947.
   The employers say the plan protected restrictive practices,
forced the employment of 12 percent more workers than needed and was
outdated by modern cargo handling, mainly gantry-swung containers
replacing the docker's hook.
   Modern methods have cut the registered dock workforce from 65,000
in 1967 to 9,400. About 1,000 more workers are employed in the 102
non-plan ports, which handle the remainder of the country's trade.
   Large ports affected by the strike will include London, Tees and
Hartlepool, Immingham and Grimsby, Forth, Southampton and Liverpool.
   Most English Channel ferries should escape the strike because the
ports of Dover and Felixstowe are outside the plan.
   The major impact of the strike is expected on movement of cars,
containerized manufactured goods, newsprint, timber, grain,
perishable fruit, animal feed, iron ore and other minerals and
chemicals.
   North Sea oil operators plan to switch their supply vessels from
Aberdeen and Dundee in Scotland to Norwegian ports.
   Finney said more than 1,000 dockworkers had quit before the
strike, accepting up to 35,000 pounds, or about $56,700, in
severance pay.
   ``Extensive plans have already been made by shippers and port
customers to minimize the effect of a strike and safeguard the
nation's trade,'' Finney said.
   The end of the dock labor plan means that dockworkers can be
fired and non-union labor can be used on waterfronts; both actions
formerly were illegal. The employers have been encouraging
dockworkers to sign individual contracts.

   The United Mine Workers on Friday called
a three-day holiday for its members east of the Mississippi River,
saying the contractually allowed memorial period would restore calm
in the coal fields.
   As many as 46,000 miners in 10 states have been involved in
unauthorized strikes against coal operators who signed a no-strike
contract with the union. They walked out over The Pittston Co.'s
refusal to sign a UMW contract.
   UMW President Richard Trumka called the memorial period.
   ``Although the union has requested that they return to work, the
conditions which led to the protest _ excessive fines by federal and
state courts, the arrest of thousands of union members and
supporters by the Virginia State Police, the threat of indefinite
jailings of union leaders and supporters and Pittston's refusal to
negotiate in good faith _ remain unchanged,'' Trumka said.
   It is the first official sanction of the wildcat strikes that
have stricken the coal fields since June 12. The union had been
under orders to lead the miners back to work.
   ``The union is calling this memorial period in an attempt to calm
the volatile situation in the coal fields, in the hope that this
period will help put an end to a situation where the actions of one
renegade coal company and its allies have disrupted the entire coal
industry,'' Trumka said.
   Morris Feibusch of the Bituminous Coal Operators Association,
which negotiated the national contract with the union, said he had
no comment.
   The last two weeks of the wildcat walkouts have coincided with a
national vacation period for most miners covered by the UMW
contract, prompting speculation that its end would also mark the end
of the unauthorized picketing.
   ``Right now, I see absolutely no movement to go back to work,''
said Howard Green, a UMW international executive board member from
Charleston-based District 17.
   It wasn't clear what Trumka plans at the end of the memorial
holiday, which will begin Monday. But UMW spokesman John Duray said
union leaders would try to change the members' minds by the end of
the break.
   ``These people were out to protest something and they want to see
a change in the situation,'' Duray said. ``We will be out in the
next three days to make sure they see a change in the situation.''
   Union members will not have to picket other mines during the
meorial period, Duray said. Keeping them off the streets should help
restore order, he said.
   ``The purpose is to provide less of a sense of chaos out there,''
he said. ``We won't have pickets going around. Some locals will have
meetings during the three days. Positive results will have a greater
chance.''
   Chaos reigned at a Beckley meeting hall Friday as about 2,000
striking coal miners protested the firing of 28 colleagues and
prevented a hearing between union officials and the company that
dismissed the miners.
   Toney's Branch Coal Co. Inc. fired the men on Thursday, making
them the first dismissed since the wildcat strikes began. Dismissal
forms circulated among the picketers said the men were fired for
refusing to cross picket lines at the Racine mine.
   Company officals and represenatives from UMW District 17 refused
to cross the pickets and enter the Raleigh County Armory, where the
sides were scheduled to meet to discuss the firings. The pickets
dispersed after the meeting was postponed.
   ``This should tell them that all it's going to do is incite the
workers,'' Green said from a telephone booth near the armory.
   Both sides agreed to waive time restrictions on the hearing and
said they would meet at a later date. The firings apparently stand,
however.
   About 37,000 workers in eight states were idled Friday as UMW
members showed support for 1,900 coal miners striking The Pittston
Co., which wants a separate contract with the union.
   Pittston workers mined coal for more than 14 months without a
contract before walking out April 5, refusing a company request that
miners work mandatory overtime and on Sundays and refusing proposed
cuts in medical benefits for pensioners.
   The BCOA said Friday that the wildcat strikes have kept $6
million from entering the trust fund set up to pay medical benefits
to 118,000 pensioners who retired before 1976. BCOA President Joseph
Brennan also blamed $14 million in other losses since February 1988
on the union's granting some companies lower contribution rates and
some coal companies' withholding contributions.
   ``What we need is for the UMWA miners ... to return to work, for
the companies and the UMWA to honor existing contractural
commitments and for the UMWA and the industry to work cooperatively
to find additional sources of revenue for the funds,'' Brennan said.
   Pittston has not paid into the fund since January 1988, Feibusch
said, despite a continuing obligation to it because it has former
employees covered by it.

<HEAD>Swine Semen Regulations Announced</HEAD>

   New regulations for importing swine semen from
China were announced Friday, but Agriculture Department officials
say it is unlikely that shipments will be allowed until U.S.-China
relations improve.
   The rules, proposed in March, went into effect Wednesday, said
James W. Glosser, administrator of the department's Animal and Plant
Health Inspection Service.
   But spokesman Wayne Baggett said the actual shipment of semen
``is very unlikely because of the political situation.''
   U.S. officials have criticized China for its recent crackdown on
pro-democracy demonstrators.
   China, the world's largest swine producer, may have valuable
breeding stock that could be used by U.S. producers. The semen
program, designed with that in mind, includes rules to guard against
the introduction of certain diseases.
   For example, donor boars must originate in areas of China
certified as free of hog cholera, rinderpest, foot-and-mouth
disease, brucellosis, tuberculosis and other afflictions. The semen
samples also must be tested for disease.
