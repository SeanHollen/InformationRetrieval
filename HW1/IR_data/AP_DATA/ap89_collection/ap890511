<HEAD>Premadasa Meets With Tamil Rebels</HEAD>

<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Ranasinghe Premadasa and
four members of his Cabinet met for the first time Thursday with
Tamil rebels fighting for an independent nation and discussed ways
to end the insurgency, officials said.
   Also Thursday, officials said Premadasa will help the top
Sinhalese militant leader go abroad for medical treatment, a move
which may pave the way for peace negotiations with the extremists.
   The Tamil rebellion and the resulting Sinhalese backlash have
claimed more than 12,500 lives since 1983 and unleashed a wave of
terror, bombings and assassinations on this once-peaceful island
nation.
   Officials refused to reveal details of the meeting with the
Tamils, which concluded for the day after a few hours.
   Foreign Minister Ranjan Wijeratne said Premadasa had received
and approved a request from Rohana Wijeweera, leader of the
underground People's Liberation Front, to allow him to go abroad
for medical treatment.
   Wijeweera, 46, is believed to have suffered a heart attack
recently.
   The front is an ultra-nationalist Sinhalese group which has been
at the forefront of the anti-government campaign launched in 1987
to protest peace overtures made to Tamil rebels.
   The request from Wijeweera was made through Chris Nuttal, the
British Broadcasting Corp. correspondent in Colombo.
   Nuttal said he received two telephone calls from a front member
on Thursday, who said the group would be willing to hold talks with
the government if Wijeweera was allowed to receive medical
treatment in London. The request was conveyed to the government, he
said.
   A government statement said Premadasa had not directly been in
touch with the front.
   The front last month rejected Premadasa's offer of amnesty and
seats in Parliament if they gave up their campaign of
assassinations and calling crippling industrial strikes. An
estimated 3,500 people have been killed in the campaign. The peace
offer was accepted by Tamil rebels, and a five-member team is
currently holding talks with the government.
   Tamil insurgents launched a bloody rebellion in 1983 for an
independent nation in the northern and eastern regions of the
country, where most Tamils live.
   An attempt by Premadasa's predecessor, Junius R. Jayewardene, to
end the rebellion by granting limited autonomy to the Tamils ended
in failure after the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, the largest
rebel militia, rejected the plan after a brief acceptance.
   The peace plan, signed in July 1987, also sparked a backlash
among nationalist Sinhalese, who said it gave too many concessions
to the Tamil minority.
   The plan was sponsored by India, and Indian peacekeeping troops
were later despatched to Sri Lanka to enforce an arms surrender by
the Tamils. At least 800 Indian soldiers have been killed in
hit-and-run attacks by the rebels since then.
   The Hindu Tamils, who comprise 18 percent of the country's 16
million people, say they are discriminated against by the Sinhalese
majority in jobs and education.
   Sinhalese Buddhists make up 75 percent of the population and
control the government and the military.

<TEXT>
   Hundreds of American diplomatic and
military families headed Thursday to temporary haven on U.S.
military bases to avoid possible harassment by Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega's government.
   ``The problem is regime-directed gangs,'' such as the group that
assaulted opposition presidential candidate Guillermo Endara and
his two running mates on Wednesday, said Terry Kneebone, a
spokesman for the U.S. Embassy.
   Kneebone said there had been no direct threats against U.S.
personnel, but that in the past the Panamanian government has
publicized the neighborhoods where Americans live.
   Kneebone said he did not know if that was just propaganda, ``but
the people around Wednesday were out of control.''
   U.S. Ambassador Arthur Davis announced that U.S. diplomatic
dependents would be moved to bases after the assault on Endara and
his two vice presidential candidates Wednesday.
   President Bush anounced Thursday that Davis is being recalled,
that U.S. personnel would be reduced and that both military and
diplomatic dependents would be moved either to safe housing or out
of the country.
   The United States maintains 10 military installations in Panama,
which is U.S. military headquarters for Latin America. About 10,000
U.S. soldiers are stationed in Panama, and Bush said Thursday he
was sending 2,000 more ``to protect the lives of American
citizens.''
   Kneebone said 105 U.S. citizens work for the embassy, and the
moving order affected 57 spouses and 85 children.
   The order does not affect 21,300 American civilians not
connected with the U.S. government, many of them retired.
   Leo LeBlanc, from Seattle, said his daughters are away at
college. He was planning to put up three families in his three
spare bedrooms at Fort Clayton, 10 miles from Panama City.
   ``I've been in the service, or with the service, 25 years,''
said LeBlanc, a civilian Army employee. ``We take care of our own.''
   The Kirberg family was one of the three LeBlanc was expecting.
They arrived at sunset, unloaded their suitcases in a few minutes
and looked at their new surroundings.
   They said they'd had no trouble but they'd rather be safe.
   ``The Panamanians have always been friendly,'' said Emil
Kirberg, who works for LeBlanc.
   His wife, Judy Boyle, said she had been surprised by the call.
``It was worse last year and we never had a problem,'' she said.
   The Kirbergs said they put as much as they could into a few
suitcases and left their dog with friends.
   ``I tried to take things that meant something to me,'' said
Boyle. That included some pillows and a small chandelier.
   Once inside the gate, LeBlanc said his wife had sped out to rent
some videos.
   ``I hope she gets some good ones,'' he said. ``I don't know how
long this is going to go on.''
   The plan under which diplomatic dependents were moving Thursday
was designed for temporary security, and embassy spokeswoman
Cynthia Farrell said it was not known how Bush's decisions would
affect the immediate situation.
   Kneebone said: ``Everybody lives in a high-rise apartment
building for security reasons. People can't see that you've moved,
as they could if you lived in a house.
   ``It's not like the Joads moving from Oklahoma to California.
You just pack a suitcase for four or five days, get in your car and
drive across town.''
   All was calm Wednesday in one of the exclusive high-rise
neighborhoods where many diplomatic families live. Almost the only
vehicle moving in the hot afternoon sun was a beer truck making a
restaurant delivery.
   Some people with pets were boarding them out, Kneebone said, but
others planned to return home during the day ``to feed pets or pick
up clean underwear.''
   Panamanian employees of the embassy were concerned both about
harassment and whether they would have jobs if the size of the
staff was reduced.
   ``We can do with very few Americans here and that will probably
create more work, rather than less, for the Panamanians,'' the
spokesman said.
   He said the military officials were in a more difficult
situation because they had more dependents to deal with.
   A spokesman for the U.S. Southern Command said there are 10,600
military dependents in Panama, 972 of whom live off base.
   Southern Command was operating under condition ``Charlie,''
meaning U.S. personnel can go into public areas of Panama only on
official business and in civilian clothes.
   Kneebone said his family was in the United States because the
current government had sent him a letter ordering him to leave the
country.
   ``Since we don't recognize that government, we opened the
envelope, photocopied it, resealed it and stamped `Returned
Unopened' on it,'' he said.
   He said he sent his family home because he thought the expulsion
order, and his refusal to obey it, made him a target
   Bush said U.S. companies doing business in Panama also should
withdraw dependents. Among the larger companies with operations
here are Texaco and Colgate.
   A person who answered the telephone at the American Chamber of
Commerce said the chamber could not express an opinion or give
information because ``this is a political matter now.''

<HEAD>Speaker's Lawyers Seek to Dismiss Most Serious Charges</HEAD>

   Lawyers for House Speaker Jim Wright sought
Wednesday to dismiss the most serious charges against him as the
ethics committee moved to dig deeper into a Texas gas investment
that yielded huge profits for Wright last year.
   The ethics panel also denied a motion by the speaker's lawyers
to bar the special outside counsel in the case, Chicago lawyer
Richard Phelan, from holding private discussions with the
committee, but granted other motions seeking access to witnesses
and documents, said Stephen D. Susman, a lawyer for Wright.
   Committee chairman Julian Dixon, D-Calif., strongly defended
Phelan against allegations from Wright's camp that he has used
faulty and weak reasoning in bringing charges against the speaker.
   ``That is totally inaccurate, totally wrong and an exercise in
bad judgment by the respondent's attorneys,'' Dixon told reporters.
   At the same time, the Justice Department said it would undertake
an independent review of Wright's business and political dealings
if the House exonerates the speaker.
   ``I expect the department will take an independent look,'' David
Runkel, chief spokesman for Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, said
in response to a question at a press briefing.
   He said such a review would cover matters brought up by the
House ethics committee and ``other matters that have been raised,''
such as Wright's involvement in a 1985 political fund-raising
effort in Texas.
   ``We are going to keep an eye on allegations made about the
conduct of the speaker,'' Runkel said. But the spokesman added that
``it's premature to say we are going to have any investigation.''
   Asked if the department would investigate Wright if the House
disciplined the speaker, Runkel said: ``The Justice Department has
a different function than the House has and we are keeping tabs on
that. It would be premature to say what that's going to lead to.''
   In seeking to dismiss the most serious allegations against the
speaker _ that he used bulk sales of his book to evade limits on
outside earned income and improperly accepted $145,000 in gifts
from a person with a direct interest in legislation _ the lawyers
charged the ethics committee is trying to hold Wright to a new,
tougher standard.
   The charges amount to ``a house of cards delicately balanced on
a series of unprecedented reinterpretations of House rules,'' they
argued.
   The eight-lawyer defense team did not immediately challenge
other charges that the speaker failed to report as gifts benefits
he received from Fort Worth, Texas, developer George Mallick, but
signaled that that issue would be contested later.
   On the matter of Wright's gas investment, Dixon said the
committee, after a briefing on a series of interviews conducted
last week, decided that ``there were other witnesses who would have
to be interviewed'' and directed Phelan to continue investigating.
   The investment involves a gas well in Sabine Lake, near the
Texas-Louisiana line, which Wright and Mallick bought into for
$9,120 last January. They sold their interest less than five months
later for a $340,000 profit, even though the well's production had
dwindled.
   The ethics panel also generally discussed a series of other
allegations against Wright raised in recent news stories, but made
no decisions on whether to formally expand the investigation to
include those, Dixon said.
   The New York Times, in its Thursday editions, reported that
among the transactions that have come under scrutiny is Wright's
$100,000 investment in a Texas nursing home company that later went
bankrupt.
   Published reports have said Wright was one of the few investors
in Jewell Enterprises to receive payments from the company before
it failed.
   The company's president, T.R. Jewell, is quoted in Thursday's
editions of The Times as saying his company provided Wright the
money to pay interest on the $100,000 bank loan Wright used to buy
his stock in 1983. Jewell said he considered the money a ``loan''
and that similar loans were available to a few other stockholders.
   Jewell told the Fort Worth, Texas, Star-Telegram, that Wright's
investment had no connection with any legislation before Congress
and that the company gained nothing by having the powerful
congressman as one of its 28 investors.
   ``We were regulated by the state; there isn't anything he could
have done to help us,'' Jewell told the Star-Telegram.
   Among the areas the panel is looking into is a 1985 fund-raising
effort for a special congressional election in Texas in which
Wright took an intense personal interest. In testimony last week at
a federal fraud trial in Dallas, Wright was linked to a political
action committee which collected allegedly illegal contributions
from officials of Commodore Savings and Loan, an insolvent Texas
thrift.
   On Wednesday, three former Commodore employees testified they
gave money to the East Texas First PAC and later were reimbursed by
their company, either through pay increases or checks for fictional
travel.
   Former Commodore President E. Morten Hopkins, his brother Robert
and John W. Harrell, former Commodore CEO and vice chairman of the
board, are being tried on charges they misused Commodore funds to
make illegal PAC contributions.
   East Texas First raised and spent about $100,000 to help Rep.
Jim Chapman, D-Texas, win a special election in 1985. A former
Commodore chief financial officer testified Friday that his boss
told him Wright had agreed to halt legislation opposed by the
savings and loan industry if the industry raised $250,000 for the
PAC, but Wright denied making any such statement.

   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher will have as
close or closer a political relationship with President Bush than
with his predecessor Ronald Reagan, Henry Kissinger predicted.
   The former U.S. secretary of state made the remarks Wednesday
night in an interview with Britain's Sky Television.
   Mrs. Thatcher, one of Reagan's closest allies during his
two-term presidency, is due to hold talks with Bush when he visits
Britain for two days starting May 31 during a European tour.
   Kissinger said: ``The relationship, good as it was between
President Reagan and Mrs. Thatcher, will be at least as good, if
not better, between President Bush and Prime Minister Thatcher.''
   ``Mr. Reagan based his relationships very much on personal
intuition. President Bush is a man who is more reflective about the
conceptual matters,'' Kissinger added.

<TEXT>
   The last Brezhnev man on the Politburo bends
enough under the pressure of reform to stay in power, but Vladimir
V. Shcherbitsky has not budged from his deepest convictions.
   He was named Ukranian Communist Party leader 17 years ago to
crack down on nationalism in the industrial and agricultural
heartland of the Soviet Union. And he indicates nationalism is
still one of his primary concerns.
   ``Nationalist ideas exist everywhere, but we cannot allow people
who stick to such absurdities to join perestroika,'' he told The
Associated Press.
   At 71, Shcherbitsky is the oldest of the 12 men on the ruling
Politburo and considered one of the most conservative. Except for
reformist President Mikhail S. Gorbachev himself, he is the only
one left dating back to the late Soviet President Leonid I.
Brezhnev.
   Shcherbitsky, a Ukranian, also is the only party leader of a
republic Gorbachev has not replaced since becoming general
secretary in 1985. Reformers complain that Shcherbitsky is
preventing Gorbachev's changes from taking root in the Ukraine, a
republic with a population of 50 million.
   But Shcherbitsky made clear in written responses to questions
submitted by The Associated Press that he feels the earth moving
under his feet.
   ``One can see signs of renewal with the naked eye,'' he wrote.
   His aides said they could not recall Shcherbitsky ever
responding to a foreign journalist's request for an interview. The
Ukrainian leader refused, however, to take any follow-up questions,
either in writing or in person.
   Shcherbitsky is blamed by some for covering up the radiation
damage done by the Chernobyl nuclear power plant explosion, for
restraining the local press and for arrests and harassment of
dissidents whose political activities would be considered routine
in the other European republics of the Soviet Union.
   He denied the charges.
   ``Some groups attempt to use glasnost and the public rostrum for
alien propaganda, national egoism and even anti-Sovietism,'' he
said.
   Schcherbitsky concedes the Ukraine is suffering from accumulated
problems such as severe pollution. He said he responds to public
opinion these days and, as evidence, he pointed to the scrapping of
several nuclear power projects and a dam.
   In recent months, Shcherbitsky has come under new pressures for
change: Gorbachev has begun public criticism of the Ukrainian
leadership, and several new reform groups have drawn thousands of
people to public meetings. Six of his aides were defeated in their
bids for additional positions of power in the recent election, the
first in which citizens voted in large numbers against the
establishment.
   ``I have to admit I have never run such an active and intensive
election campaign,'' Shcherbitsky wrote of his successful bid for a
seat in the new Soviet parliament. He got 74 percent of the vote in
the Dnepropetrovsk area, his old power base.
   The other 26 percent crossed his name off the ballot since there
was no alternative candidate.
   Nine years ago, Shcherbitsky smashed the Helsinki Watch human
rights group in the Ukraine by arresting everyone who joined. Today
those activists are out of prison, and some campaigned for his
defeat in the election. Some spent a few weeks in jail for their
efforts.
   The grassroots organizations have drawn thousands of people to
meetings on ecology, expanded use of the Ukrainian language,
legalization of the Ukrainian Catholic Church and exposing the
crimes of Stalin.
   Many of them, Shcherbitsky said, don't understand that ``we need
time, technology and money to make changes.''
   He opposes the most general reform group, the People's Movement
of the Ukraine, accusing its leaders of ambition and nationalism
that ``leads the way to permissiveness and national antagonism,
contradicting the interests of perestroika.''
   Though none of the major reform groups in the Ukraine is openly
calling for independence, that is a growing source of conflict in
several smaller areas of the Soviet Union. Most recently, 20 Soviet
Georgians died in unrest after troops broke up a pro-independence
demonstration April 9.
   Ukrainian activist Oles Shevchenko says Shcherbitsky remains in
power because Gorbachev needs him to clamp down on nationalism in
the second most populous republic and because Shcherbitsky voted
for Gorbachev to become the Soviet leader in 1985.
   Shcherbitsky confirmed that, ``I supported the election of
Mikhail Sergeevich Gorbachev as general secretary.''
   Shcherbitsky said he has no ``principal disagreements'' with
Gorbachev, despite ``creative discussions'' in Kremlin meetings.
   ``A lively, friendly atmosphere has replaced artificial
unanimity, and that is a clear and eloquent sign of the times,'' he
wrote.
   Shcherbitsky sprinkled his comments with references to
perestroika, Gorbachev's reform program. He insisted the Ukraine is
pressing ahead with farm leasing, glasnost and competitive
elections, all keystones of Gorbachev's plan.
   Gorbachev is more blunt in his criticism of the Ukrainian
leadership's performance.
   In a March party meeting, Gorbachev complained that billions of
rubles poured into agriculture have been wasted. A 320 percent
increase in investment in the Ukraine has bought only a 39 percent
rise in output in two decades, he said.
   But Shcherbitsky denied Soviet news reports that Gorbachev
ordered Ukrainian party leaders to pay more attention to
democratization and to work with progressive Ukrainian writers
pressing for reform.
   ``Gorbachev never raised this question,'' Shcherbitsky said.
   He did acknowledge, however, that the Communist Party chief
``expressed some critical remarks and offered advice, which we are
considering.''
   Shcherbitsky refused to comment on his reputation as a
conservative opponent of domestic reforms, but emphasized that
changes must be carefully monitored.
   ``After all, perestroika is harmed by sluggishness and stomping
in one place, as well as by impulsive jumps and overreactions,'' he
wrote.

   For two months, residents of Beirut have spent
much of their lives in bunkers and basements because of fierce
artillery battles between Christians and Moslems. Here is a report
on 10 hours in the life of one Moslem family.

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Munaymneh family and their neighbors
tumbled into the underground shelter in their apartment block when
a 155mm howitzer shell exploded in the street, signaling another
round of fierce artillery battles in Beirut.
   ``This is only the beginning,'' moaned Soumayya Munaymneh, 35,
as she shepherded her two sons, Amer, 12, and Samer, 14, down the
stairs on Tuesday. ``Will it ever stop?''
   Most of the six families have spent most of the last two months
cooped up in the makeshift 33-foot-by-19-foot shelter in the
basement of the six-story block in the Bourj Abu-Haidar district of
Moslem west Beirut.
   The fierce artillery, rocket and tank battles that have raged
between army commander Gen. Michel Aoun's mainly Christian forces
and an alliance of Syrian soldiers and Moslem Druse militiamen have
reached an intensity unprecedented in Lebanon's 14-year-old civil
war.
   Some days, as many as 25,000 shells and rockets are fired by
both sides.
   Mrs. Munaymneh clutched two bottles of drinking water. Her
husband, Rafik, and the boys carried chairs, blankets and
mattresses.
   ``Don't forget anything, because we won't be able to come up and
get it,'' Mrs. Munaymneh told the boys.
   Life for Christians and Moslems alike has become an endless
cycle of waiting out the bombardments huddled in stuffy shelters or
basement parking lots, then foraging for food and water or patching
up their damaged homes and businesses during the lulls, nervously
listening for the first thud of shellfire that heralds another
barrage.
   There were 18 people in the shelter. They slipped into the
routine of life underground while exploding shells and artillery
guns thundered above them.
   The men lighted kerosene lanterns and huddled to talk politics.
The women spread out mattresses in the ``sleeping corner'' and food
supplies in the part of the shelter Mrs. Munaymneh called ``the
dining room'' _ the area around a small cooker used to fix tea or
coffee or to heat canned food.
   The children played cards. But everyone was tense as the
explosions shook the shelter.
   The Munaymnehs, who are Sunni Moslems, have missed much of the
recent shelling because, like thousands of other Beirutis, they
fled the city.
   Rafik Munaymneh, a 52-year-old shipping agent, took his family
to Damascus, Syria. He brought them back to Beirut on April 30, one
day after Arab foreign ministers called for a cease-fire in Lebanon.
   ``We thought it was over after the Arabs announced the
cease-fire, and we came back because the kids' school said it was
resuming classes,'' Munaymneh said.
   ``Obviously, it was the wrong decision,'' he said.
   As the shells exploded, the children argued about the caliber
and direction of the rounds.
   ``That's an outgoing tank shell,'' Samer said when a
particularly loud blast thundered above. ``I bet it's that tank on
the corner.''
   Munaymneh grumbled: ``That tank's inviting trouble. The
Christians will start shooting at it.''
   A few minutes later five arillery rounds hit the neighborhood,
one near the entrance to the apartment building.
   ``Oh Allah, have mercy on us!'' one of the 10 women yelled. The
children screamed.
   ``Silence! Silence!'' Munaymneh shouted.
   ``We're all OK. Thank God, the shell didn't damage the
shelter,'' he said.
   His wife and some of the other women recited verses from the
Koran, Islam's holy book.
   The whispered prayers were drowned out by a flurry of news
flashes on the half-dozen transistor radios, all tuned to different
Christian and Moslem stations, reporting on which districts were
getting pounded by Aoun's U.S.-made howitzers.
   The radios, the families' only link to the outside world, are
kept on all the time.
   ``Is anyone talking about a new cease-fire?'' one of the women
asked, her voice trembling.
   No one bothered to answer her. There have been dozens of
cease-fires in the last two months. None lasted very long.
   The intensity of the barrage eased around midnight and Najwa
Quoraitem ran up to her family's third-floor apartment to bring
down some manakeesh _ Lebanese pizza made with thyme.
   ``You have to eat to survive _ that is, if the shells don't get
us,'' she murmured as she passed out the manakeesh. Another woman
served tea.
   The barrage eased near dawn and the children fell asleep. The
men took turns to go upstairs to check their apartments.
   ``The building next door took several direct hits,'' Munaymneh
said when he came back. ``Some people were wounded. We'll find out
exactly what happened later.''
   At daybreak, the families left the shelter to return to their
apartments.
   No one knew when the shelling would resume, only that it would.
   The Munaymnehs packed and headed back to Damascus. Their
neighbors prepared to spend another night underground.

<HEAD>Radar Balloon Damaged, Deflated by Swirling `Dust Devil'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An $18 million Aerostat radar balloon
operated by the U.S. Customs Service was damaged and deflated by
swirling winds Wednesday while it was moored close to the ground,
officials said.
   The helium-filled balloon, equipped with sophisticated look-down
radar as an airborne deterrent to drug-smuggling, was struck by a
dust devil, a mini-cyclone or miniature tornado, around 1:30 p.m.,
said Charles Conroy, a Customs spokesman in Houston.
   Conroy said there were no injuries and there was no damage to
other property at Fort Huachuca, the Army base in southeastern
Arizona where the balloon is tethered. Damages to the Aerostat have
not been assessed yet.
   The Aerostat is 245 feet long, 72 feet in diameter and its hull
is made of high-tech materials including Mylar and Tedlar. It
weighs about 12,750 pounds, including the radar package of about
3,500 pounds, Customs officials have said.
   The Aerostat at Fort Huachuca was the first of a series being
deployed along the U.S.-Mexico border.
   Conroy said one other Aerostat is in operation at Deming, N.M.,
with another scheduled to go into operation at Yuma, ``hopefully
next month.''
   Conroy said the Aerostat at Deming has an overlapping range over
the area covered by the damaged device. That, combined with
military radar, Customs airborne and ground radar and air traffic
control radar will make up for that on the downed balloon.
   Customs officials have said the balloon has been instrumental in
successful tracking of several small aircraft carrying narcotics
being smuggled into the United States from Mexico. But critics have
labeled the balloon a white elephant.

Jalalabad for their first visit to the city since a guerrilla siege
began March 7. Here is a report.

<TEXT>
   The army says it has driven
guerrillas away from Jalalabad, ending a nine-week siege, and on
Wednesday the shelling had stopped in the 16th century city of
gardens built by the Moguls.
   Children played in open spaces bright with lilacs.
   Afghan soldiers advanced up to 25 miles along two fronts in an
offensive begun Sunday against Moslem insurgents surrounding the
city, their commanders said.
   ``As you can see, Jalalabad is alive,'' said Lt. Gen. Manok
Mangall, chairman of the defense council and governor of Nangarhar
province.
   Leaders of the mujahedeen, the ``holy warriors'' who have fought
for more than a decade, denied army claims of ending the siege,
retaking the Samarkhel garrison and controlling half the road to
the Pakistan border town of Torkham.
   Mohammad Nabi Mohammadi, defense minister of the guerrillas'
exile government, told reporters in Pakistan: ``It's a total lie .
.. baseless propaganda. The siege of Jalalabad continues. Samarkhel
continues to be in the hands of mujahedeen, who also control the
Jalalabad-Torkham road.''
   President Najib's government flew 13 Western journalists to
Jalalabad to prove it controls the strategic provincial capital 75
miles east of Kabul.
   Jalalabad, once known for magnificent gardens, orchards and
palaces, has been under guerrilla siege since March 7. Military
officials said the city, 45 miles from Pakistan, had been pounded
by 131,000 rockets and artillery and mortar shells.
   It lies near the Khyber Pass astride the trade routes to India
and Pakistan, dominating the entrances to the Laghman and Kunar
valleys. The modern city was built in the 16th century by Akbar,
grandson of Babur, who founded the Mogul empire of India.
   Army officials said at least 523 civilians had been killed and
3,000 wounded during the siege. They said most of the casualties
occurred in the first weeks of the first major guerrilla offensive
since Soviet military forces completed their withdrawal from
Afghanistan on Feb. 15.
   Doctors at Nangarhar Hospital said nearly all the casualties
were caused by rockets or shells.
   ``We don't even have one patient with a bullet injury,'' said
Dr. Hafizullah, director of the 260-bed hospital.
   Commanders of the guerrillas, who began fighting after a
communist coup in April 1978, had predicted at the onset of their
offensive that Jalalabad would fall within days.
   They had hoped to set up their interim government in the city as
a basis for international recognition as an alternative to Najib's
regime in Kabul. The rebels are based in Pakistan and receive much
of their support from the United States.
   Reports from both sides have said Jalalabad was in ruins, with
nearly all the mud-and-brick buildings damaged or destroyed and the
remaining residents hiding in ditches or basements.
   The scene in the dusty, rutted streets Wednesday suggested
otherwise.
   Most buildings had been damaged by shellfire, but remained
standing. Although shops generally were boarded shut, the city had
electricity, running water and working telephones.
   Farmers worked in fields on the outskirts, harvesting their
wheat and planting rice. Lilacs and wild flowers were in bloom and
the city had an abundance of palm trees and small orchards.
   Children played in the sun and their elders moved about the city
on bicycles and in horse-drawn carts, sharing the road with tanks,
military jeeps and armored personnel carriers.
   Some neighborhoods were like ghost towns, however. More than
64,000 people lived in Jalalabad when the civil war began, but many
fled to Kabul or to refugee camps in Pakistan.
   No count of how many remain is available, but some said they
will never leave, despite hardship and war.
   ``What would we do? Where would we go? asked Bhargar Singh, a
70-year-old doctor living in a Sikh temple. He said rockets had hit
it five times, killing 24 people and wounding at least 100.
   Early in the battle for Jalalabad, the army surrendered key
garrisons around the city and the guerrillas came within about six
miles of the airport, which was hit by thousands of rockets. The
runway was damaged, a cargo building leveled and the windows of the
control tower knocked out.
   ``If it's necessary, planes can land, but I don't remember when
the last one landed,'' said Lt. Col. Jehangi, 42, the airport
commander.
   Military officials have not said how many soldiers have been
deployed in and around Jalalabad, but estimates run as high as
30,000. Nearly double that number of guerrillas were believed to
surround the city at one time.
   When Soviet troops left Afghanistan after nine years of
involvement in the war, there were predictions that Afghanistan's
conscript army would collapse.
   Col. Gen. Mohammad Delawar, army commander for the area, said of
guerrilla claims of quick victory in Jalalabad and the long siege
that followed: ``There's an old Afghan proverb. When a man digs a
well, he usually falls in.''

<TEXT>
   U.N. security guards have been ordered to
quit slouching, get those hands out of those pockets and spit out
the gum as part of a campaign to brighten their image.
   A memorandum from Anthony O'Connell, chief of the U.N. Security
and Safety Service, reminds his officers they work under the eyes
of diplomats and countless tourists and must observe proper
military decorum.
   Among admonitions in his memorandum, obtained Wednesday:
   _Smoking and chewing gum are forbidden while in uniform.
   _Carrying of bags, packages or other items while in uniform does
not create a good image and is not permitted.
   _Leaning against walls or door jambs _ also out.
   _Guards with hands in pockets or thumbs hooked in belts look
either lackadaisical or aggressive _ or both. All members of the
service must refrain from so doing.
   Regarding saluting, O'Connell wrote: ``There is an unacceptable
lack of uniformity in this area. ... Members of the service at the
rank of inspector and above will be saluted.''
   Guards routinely salute Secretary-General Javier Perez de
Cuellar as their commander, but correspondents observed an outbreak
of saluting since O'Connell's memo began circulating on Friday.

   Hungarian television will broadcast
live the reburial of Imre Nagy, who was executed and interred in an
unmarked grave after leading the country's 1956 anti-Soviet
uprising, a newspaper reported.
   The remains of Nagy and his revolutionary associates were
exhumed last month from the unmarked graves where they were buried
in 1958.
   They are to be reburied on June 16.
   The plan underscores the current Communist leadership's
willingness to acknowledge repressions that followed the popular
uprising, which was crushed by Soviet forces.
   The party has also shown readiness to appease public demands for
broader democracy and economic reform.
   The independent daily Mai Nap quoted the television network's
president, Gyula Bereczky, as announcing the plan for live coverage
of the reburial.
   He was also quoted as saying the network would broadcast a
three-part documentary soon on events immediately after the Soviets
moved to put down the uprising.

<HEAD>Ford Foundation Urges Changes In Social Programs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Ford Foundation, saying the U.S. social
welfare system is out of date, has recommended comprehensive
changes that include treatment on demand for drug and alcohol
problems.
   The Ford report, entitled ``The Common Good: Social Welfare and
the American Future,'' concedes that many of its recommendations
face uphill political and monetary battles.
   The report was scheduled for release Thursday in Washington, D.C.
   Details were reported in Thursday editions of The New York Times
and The Washington Post.
   The Times said the Ford proposals would cost $29 billion beyond
the $500 billion the federal government spends on social programs.
   The report recommended a tremendous expansion of the Head Start
program to reach 900,000 more 3- and 4-year-olds, and that the
government pay for long-term care for the elderly.
   The proposals would also cost the private sector an estimated
$10 billion for employers to extend health insurance coverage for
workers.
   The panel recommended paying for the additional programs by
taxing Social Security benefits. Such a tax would raise more than
half of the $29 billion annual cost of the recommended programs,
the report said.
   The $3 million study was prepared by an 11-member panel of
business, civic, labor and civil rights leaders and educators.
   ``We are on the right track calling attention to the country's
social deficit,'' said Irving S. Shapiro, chairman of the panel and
former chief executive of the Du Pont Company. ``We know we have a
hell of a fight ahead arousing people to do what needs to be done.''
   One of the most ambitious proposals advocated by the panel is to
provide drug and alcohol treatment ``on demand'' at an estimated $1
billion per year.
   It also called for expanding a food program, Women, Infants and
Children, which now reaches half of the 6.5 million to 7.5 million
people who are eligible.

<HEAD>Expert Panel Says All Suntans Are ``Potentially Hazardous''</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Those summer days spent soaking up the rays to
create a glorious tan may come back to haunt sun worshippers with
cancer and aged, wrinkled skin, a panel of experts said.
   A National Institutes of Health consensus committee on Wednesday
said current health studies show that suntans can lead to skin
cancer, a weakened immune system and skin that wrinkles and ages
before its time.
   Instead of uncovering to bathe in the noontime sun, the panel
recommended Americans avoid the midday hours of sunlight, wear
shading clothes and apply generous amounts of sunscreen lotions.
   Children in particular should be protected from overexposure to
sunlight because skin damaged early in life is more likely to
develop cancer later, the panel said in a report.
   ``All forms of tanning are potentially hazardous to the skin,''
said David Bickers, head of the panel and chairman of the
dermatology department at Case Western Reserve University in
Cleveland. ``Tanning is visible evidence of injury to the skin.''
   Larry A. Schachner of the University of Miami paraphrased Noel
Coward to note: ``Only mad dogs and Englishmen go out in midday
sun. There are no healthy tans.''
   Bickers said the panel recommended that:
   _Everyone avoid direct exposure to sunlight, particularly during
the hours of 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. when the ultraviolet rays coming
from the sun are the strongest.
   _People exposed to sunlight should wear sunscreen lotion with a
rating of 15 based on protection from ultraviolet B solar
radiation. The panel said ultraviolet A radiation also is
hazardous, though much less so, and lotions that protect against
both types of UV are best. Bickers said the panel found that
lotions with a protection rating of 15 ``will assure that virtually
everyone would get sufficient protection from the sun'' and that
there is no evidence lotions with higher ratings provide additional
protection.
   _Tanning parlors should be avoided. ``The panel consensus is to
recommend against the use of tanning parlors for cosmetic
purposes,'' said Bickers. People who do use tanning parlors should
wear goggles to protect their eyes and should be aware that tanning
lamps can damage the skin and cause adverse reactions in people
taking antibiotics, hypertensive or anti-inflammatory drugs, the
panel said.
   _Though some people react adversely to chemicals contained in
lotion sunscreens, the panel said the ``risk-benefit ratio'' favors
the use of such lotions for people who must be exposed to the sun.
Said Bickers: ``Individuals in the Sunbelt should use sunscreens on
a daily basis.''
   _Special precautions should be taken to protect children from
damaging exposures to sunlight. Schachner, an expert on children's
skin, said that schools and day care centers should schedule
outdoor recesses to avoid midday exposure to the sun. He also said
that outdoor play or lunch areas should be shaded.
   _Damaging exposure to sunlight, particularly early in life, can
lead directly to development of two types of common skin cancer,
and there is a suggestion that sunlight may play a role in
development of maglignant melanoma, an unusually vicious type of
skin cancer.
   _Though Retin-A and other vitamin A-based compounds are widely
used to treat the wrinkles in sun-damaged skin, Bickers said the
panel found there was insufficient scientific evidence about ``the
long-term safety'' of such products.
   A 1978 study showed that about half a million people annually
develop the common forms of skin cancer, said Bickers, but reports
from skin doctors indicate ``it is highly likely that there is an
increasing number of cases of non-melanoma cancers.''
   He said chemicals are thought to be eroding the ozone layer of
the stratosphere, thus allowing more ultraviolet radiation to reach
the Earth's surface. And Bickers said the panel's research showed
there are about 20,000 tanning salons in the United States which
are visited by an estimated one million customers. Both of these
factors, he said, may be leading to increasing cases of skin
cancers.
   The panel released the recommendations after reviewing studies
and hearing testimony over a three-day period. The panel included
14 skin and cancer experts from nine states.

<HEAD>Coalition Calls for Presidential Task Force on Math and Science Education</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A coalition aimed at improving the quality of
science, math and technology education today recommended President
Bush form a White House task force on those subjects to develop a
national policy.
   The non-profit Triangle Coalition for Science and Technology
Education also said the federal government should spend an extra
$304 million in fiscal 1990, rising to $465 million in 1993, to
promote elementary science, math and technology education
improvements.
   The proposed presidential task force would develop a national
policy, coordinate federal programs and plan a White House
conference on ``Science, Mathematics and Technology Education for
the year 2000.''
   ``We have made a special effort to emphasize programs that do
not require significant new funds,'' said the report released by
the coalition of 80 business, labor, science and education groups.
``However, the very magnitude of the challenge the nation faces
will call for some new programs and new resources.''
   The action plan, designed to help Congress and the president
develop a national policy on science education, states that
``increased investments in elementary education must be the
nation's number one priority.''
   Specifically, it suggests that the government start a $50
million grant program to help elementary schools pay for new
science equipment and earmark another $50 million to encourage
innovative approaches to science teaching.
   The group would also give the National Science Foundation an
extra $50 million to expand its in-service and pre-service training
programs for elementary teachers.
   Other recommendations would require less money or none at all.
Among them:
   _Revamp the science curriculum to tailor it to students of
different ages, interests and backgrounds, a project that should be
led by the National Science Foundation.
   _Increase federal support for graduate training in the sciences
and engineering, with special support to women and minorities.
   _Give clear instructions to schools receiving money under
federal school improvement programs, totaling more than $1 billion
a year, that their first priority must be science, math and
technology education activities.
   _Reserve 5 percent of the nearly $9 billion the federal
government spends on student loans, grants and scholarships for
special programs aimed at attracting and retaining math, science
and technology teachers at all academic levels.
   _Establish new federal incentives to encourage better teacher
training.
   _Implement more stringent state requirements for science
teachers.
   _Offer salary incentives for excellence in science and math
teaching and strengthened continuing education requirements in the
science area for elementary and secondary teachers.
   The Triangle proposals are a follow-up to an earlier report that
called for a sharply focused science education strategy.
   The group is affiliated with the National Science Teachers
Association. Organizations represented by its officers include the
National Education Association, the American Federation of
Teachers, E.I. Du Pont, Amoco Corp., the United Auto Workers Union,
the Acoustical Society of America, General Electric Co., the Edison
Electric Institute, the American Chemical Society and various
universities and state education groups.

   Comedian Eddie Murphy is being sued for $75
million by an actress who contends he fired her from a film because
she spurned his advances.
   Michael Michele Williams, a 22-year-old New York City actress
who performs under the name Michael Michele, also sued Paramount
Pictures over her dismissal from the soon-to-be released Murphy
picture ``Harlem Nights.''
   Ms. Williams claimed that she was removed from the proposed
television version of Murphy's hit film ``Coming to America,'' so
she could appear opposite him in ``Harlem Nights,'' a film that he
is also producing and directing.
   On the set of ``Harlem Nights,'' Murphy ``made consistent,
personal overtures'' that Ms. Williams ``did not desire,'' the
lawsuit said.
   Murphy tried ``to fondle and otherwise caress'' Ms. Williams and
had her fired ``when it became clear'' that she ``would not accede
to his sexual demands,'' the lawsuit said.
   ``There's absolutely no basis'' to the allegations, said
Murphy's manager, Bob Wachs. ``She was let go because of artistic
differences.''

   ``If the amusement park called Great Adventure had been created

one married couple trying to sustain the glow of their love,''
Cosby wrote in his new book, ``Love and Marriage,'' excerpted in
June's Good Housekeeping.
   Cosby says philosophers have long debated whether a husband and
wife should go to bed angry at each other, but he has found two
good reasons for making up at bedtime:
   ``It feels like the right moment for reconciliation and a fight
is harder to sustain when one of the fighters falls asleep.''

   Director Barry Levinson says Dustin
Hoffman ``was terrific to work with,'' despite warnings he had
received to the contrary.
   Levinson, who won a best director Oscar for ``Rain Man,'' said
Hoffman and his wife went to the hospital with Levinson and his
wife when Mrs. Levinson gave birth during filming in Cincinnati.
   ``It caused a lot of commotion in the hospital,'' he said.
   ``A lot of friends of mine said it would be tough'' working with
Hoffman, but that wasn't the case, Levinson said. ``He was terrific
to work with.''
   Levinson also said it was fun going out on the town in Baltimore
with Danny DeVito during the filming of ``Tin Men'' because DeVito
``is not afraid to get out among the people.''
   Even though ``Rain Man'' won him an Oscar, Levinson said
``Diner'' is probably his personal favorite ``because it was the
first one'' and because he was able to write it, direct it and then
film it in Baltimore, where he grew up.
   The director said he hopes to begin filming his newest movie in
Baltimore this summer.

linebacker Lawrence Taylor of drunken driving charges that were
filed after police found him slumped behind the wheel of his car.
   ``The justice system works and I'm happy for myself,'' the
eight-time All-Pro said.

   Authorities alleged Taylor was found sleeping at 3:30 a.m. March
24 behind the wheel of his Jeep, which was parked on the shoulder
of the Garden State Parkway. He was charged with drunken driving
despite two blood alcohol level readings of 0.09 percent. Under New

   Best-selling author Robert L. Moore
Jr., who wrote ``The Green Berets'' and ``The French Connection,''
was sentenced to five years probation Wednesday for his role in
defrauding the federal government of $5 million through the sale of
illegal literary tax shelters.
   U.S. District Court Judge T.F. Gilroy Daly gave Moore a
five-year suspended sentence and ordered him to pay a $500 fine and
complete 500 hours of community service.
   Moore, 63, who used the pen name Robin Moore, pleaded guilty in
April 1986 to one count of conspiracy to defraud the Internal
Revenue Service and agreed to cooperate with the government.
   Federal prosecutors have said Moore conspired with William E.
Chipman, former owner of the Hartford Hellions indoor soccer team,
to defraud the government of tax revenues through a scheme
involving the sale of royalty rights to grossly over-valued books.
   Chipman, who is serving an 18-month sentence in connection with
the scheme, was accused of marketing five tax-sheltered investments
involving six books Moore co-authored, published or loaned his name
to.
   Moore did not return a telephone call to his Concord, Mass.,
home seeking comment Wednesday night. The telephone at the White
Plains, N.Y., office of Moore's attorney, Albert Gaynor, went

missing,'' Mrs. Horne said. ``The next morning my daughter said,
`Mom, there's somebody missing.'''
   Bashful, Doc, Sneezy, Happy, Sleepy, Dopey and the 400-pound
Snow White were safe and sound but Grumpy was gone.
   On April 26, a freshly scrubbed Grumpy returned, with a sign
dangling from his shoulders that said ``I'm home.'' Along with the
sign was an envelope with 35 photographs from his journey, many of
them with captions on the back.
   Among the photos were snapshots of Grumpy ogling bikini-clad
women from a Florida sand dune, standing in front of the Lincoln
Memorial in Washington, D.C., and dining at McDonald's.
   ``My husband and I, we were laughing so hard at these pictures.
My husband was late for work,'' Mrs. Horne said.
   Grumpy's travels also included visits to Yankee Stadium,
Colorado, North and South Carolina, St. Louis and Texas.
   Mrs. Horne said Grumpy has vanished before, turning up once in
front of an ice cream store and in the back seat of a restaurant
manager's car.
   ``She saw somebody looking over her shoulder and started
screaming. He was just standing there with his arms folded and that
snarl on his face,'' Mrs. Horne said.
   She said neither she nor the police had any idea who took
Grumpy. She theorizes that ``it's someone with an engineering
background. The printing on the back of the pictures is very
similar to the type you see on blueprints.''
   This year's vacation could be Grumpy's last. Mrs. Horne said she
planned on having all the dwarfs cemented in place. Nevertheless,
she admits to envying Grumpy's wandering ways.
   ``He gets to go everywhere. I never get to go anywhere.''

   State police are going to use Mustangs to
corral speeders this summer.
   Ford Mustangs, that is. The high-powered variety that can reach
140 mph.
   The customized cars can travel about 20 mph faster than standard
patrol cars and have concealed flashing lights and antennas so they
can travel incognito.
   ``We have people who tell us they're driving the speed limit and
they're getting blown off the road,'' said State Patrol Chief Roger
Ledding. ``We're hoping these cars slow things down.''
   The $13,000 cars feature 5-liter, V-8 engines and special tires
and wheels for stability at high speeds. They will have a State
Patrol emblem only on the driver's door, but motorists won't be
able to recognize them as police cars unless they are alongside
them.

   Boris Feldman and his bride, Jean, believe
love is timeless and ageless.
   Timeless because their courtship lasted only two weeks. Ageless
because they're both octogenarians.
   Feldman, 80, and his 81-year-old wife were living separate lives
at Victory Village, one of two retirement communities operated by
the Jewish Homes for the Aging of Greater Los Angeles.
   They met in the dining room in March.
   ``We just started talking to each other. I did like her. I
figured she was just about the size I wanted _ not too tall and not
too fat,'' said Feldman.
   ``He was just a nice person to talk to,'' his wife said.
``That's all I was looking for.''
   On their first and second dates, they attended Victory Village
dances, just ``old-fashioned waltzes,'' Feldman explained, because
``my legs are not as fit as they used to be.''
   Their courtship lasted two weeks and they were married March 26.
   Mrs. Feldman said she was ``surprised when he proposed and I
accepted. He caught me at the right moment.'' He noted it ``was a
little hard to propose but she made it easy for me.''
   They still haven't had an argument. ``We don't have any money to
fight for,'' Feldman quipped.

<HEAD>Exercise Keeps President in ``Excellent Health''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush has been declared in sound
health and advised to keep up the exercise regimen his physician
says helps keep him fit.
   Although Bush emerged from Bethesda Naval Medical Center on
Wednesday with an adhesive bandage on a finger, he was pronounced
in ``excellent health'' by his personal physician, Dr. Burton Lee,
after his first full-scale medical checkup as chief executive.
   The bandage covered a cyst that was treated, and which Lee said
is not a medical problem.
   ``President Bush is in extremely sound physical condition,'' Lee
said in a statement issued by the White House. ``He keeps fit
through a number of physical activities, which we recommend he
continue on a regular basis.''
   Lee led a team of physicians _ including an ophthalmologist, a
urologist, a dermatologist and two allergists _ that conducted the
three-hour examination.
   The statement said a ``sebaceous cyst'' on Bush's middle right
finger was drained. ``The president is wearing a Band-Aid on the
finger, which he can remove within the next few hours,'' Lee said.
``This cyst has been present for many years and does not present a
medical problem.''
   A sebaceous cyst is a benign growth on the skin that is often
removed surgically.
   Bush is an avid jogger, plays tennis, pitches horseshoes,
occasionally swims and uses a stationary bicycle and indoor
treadmill.
   The White House statement said a chest X-ray, an
electrocardiogram, blood samples and a urinalysis all showed normal
results.
   Other X-rays showed mild degenerative arthritis of the hip. That
condition ``has been present for several years,'' the statement
said.
   Bush has said the arthritis has forced him in recent years to
cut down on his jogging.
   Bush takes medication because of a severe allergy to bee stings
and to control hay fever. Wednesday's medical statement said
``allergy tests showed excellent protective antibody levels.''
   The White House did not make immediately available statistics
from the examination, such as Bush's cholesterol count and blood
pressure. However, deputy press secretary Stephen Hart said some
additional data might be released later.
   Hart said Wednesday's examination showed no major changes from
the results of last year's tests, which showed Bush's cholesterol
count at 192, considered in the desirable range by the American
Heart Association. His blood pressure then was a normal 108@84.
   More complete information was released from the May 1988 test,
when Bush was a presidential candidate.
   Bush himself displayed his pleasure with the results of the
physical by grinning and flashing giving a double thumbs-up sign
when asked how he felt as he arrived at the White House from the
hospital.

<HEAD>Agency Study Enlivens Debate Over Steel Import Quotas</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BARKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S. International Trade Commission study
helps document the claim by a manufacturers' group that steel
import quotas have harmed the U.S. economy, the group says.
   The ITC said in a report Wednesday that steel import restraints
have reduced American export sales by raising steel prices.
   The 96-page report by the independent government agency was
certain to enliven the debate over whether the U.S. should continue
steel quota agreements with 19 nations and the European Community.
   The Reagan administration negotiated five-year,
product-by-product voluntary restraint agreements, or ``VRAs,'' in
1984 with Japan, South Korea, Brazil, South Africa and other
nations to limit the flow of foreign steel into the United States.
   President Bush has pledged to continue the restraints in some
form beyond their Sept. 30 expiration date. But with the steel
industry newly profitable, opponents of the curbs believe they can
make a case for ending the program, or at least narrowing its scope.
   The ITC said in the report that the curbs caused steel prices in
the United States to rise by as much as 0.6 percent in 1985, 1.6
percent in 1986, 1.4 percent in 1987 and 0.2 percent in 1988. It
said the weakening of the dollar overseas and other factors also
contributed significantly to further price hikes.
   As a result of the VRA-induced price increases, the commission
estimated American exports in steel-consuming industries decreased
by $258 million in 1985, $673 million in 1986, $699 million in 1987
and $95 million in 1988.
   ``It makes no sense to renew a program that causes such harm to
American competitiveness,'' particularly when the steel industry is
healthy, said Jon Jenson, spokesman for a coalition of more than
300 manufacturers opposed to the import curbs' extension.
   Applauding the report's conclusions, Jenson said American
manufacturers have been ``hamstrung'' by higher steel prices.
   The report said recent steel price hikes ``have been distributed
unevenly among categories of customers.''
   Price increases were not as great for large steel purchasers as
for small ones, apparently because the larger purchasers buy a
great deal of their steel through long-term contracts with prices
set in advance, the ITC said.
   The question of whether the restraints have caused steel price
increases has divided American manufacturers.
   Last month, a coalition of 374 manufacturers led by Chrysler
Corp., Maytag Corp. and others was formed to lobby for continuing
the quota agreements on grounds that the curbs have helped make the
steel industry healthier.
   That coalition contends steel price increases have been caused
by strong worldwide demand and shifting exchange rates.
   The ITC cautioned the figures reflected an ``upward bias''
because of the procedures it used. That means the effect of the
import restraints on prices might have been overstated.
   The study was conducted at the request of the House Ways and
Means subcommittee on trade.

   U.S. armed forces are quietly forging ahead
with plans to phase out their bases along the Panama Canal, despite
threats in Washington of American military intervention following
this week's allegedly fraudulent election.
   ``In all this hubbub we are doing our job,'' Maj. Kathy Wood, a
Pentagon spokeswoman, said Wednesday. The 10,000 or so troops and
the 14,000 dependents, however, were put on a heightened alert,
urging them to ``stay close to home'' following violent
demonstrations in downtown Panama City.
   Col. Robert Donnelly, deputy public affairs director for the
U.S. Southern Command in Panama, described the measure as a
``precaution,'' adding: ``It's business as usual as far as the
units go.''
   The American personnel are based at 10 military installations
along the 50-mile long Panama Canal, which cuts a swath through the
isthmus to join the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Their mission
mandated by the 1977 Panama Canal Treaties is twofold: to protect
the waterway but to prepare to turn that job over to the
Panamanians on Dec. 31, 1999. A so-called neutrality treaty,
however, provides an open-ended American military presence to
guarantee the ``permanent neutrality and operation'' of the canal.
   Alleged election fraud by Panama's de facto ruler, Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega, sparked new waves of internal discontent and
renewed speculation at home the United States would send in
military reinforcements. Some in Congress have suggested outright
intervention to topple Noriega's regime, although Bush
administration sources have described that as unlikely.
   Wood, asked about possible plans to send added American troops,
said: ``I can't speak with regard to future military activities.''
But a military source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity,
said: ``As I understand it, that is not being given serious
consideration.''
   The United States has not recognized Noriega's government since
last year, shortly after he was indicted on federal drug
trafficking charges.
   American military personnel in Panama for the past year have
been the targets of harassment, reportedly by Noriega's Defense
Forces troops. On Wednesday, for example, five U.S. military
personnel were detained.
   Noriega frequently accuses the United States of attempting to
renege on turning over the canal and on getting the troops out.
   The Pentagon, however, is making plans to move the U.S. Southern
Command, which manages American military operations south of Mexico
to the tip of South America. The tropical, white-washed buildings
will be transferred to the Panamanians no later than the end of the
century.
   ``There's nothing to preclude a move before then,'' Wood said.
   Seven sites for the Southern Command have been announced and a
decision could come by the end of July, the spokeswoman said. Under
consideration are MacDill Air Force Base near Tampa, Fla.; Patrick
Air Force Base near Cocoa Beach, Fla,; Fort Polk near Leesville,
La,; England Air Force Base near Baton Rouge, La,; the Naval Air
Station in New Orleans; Brooks Air Force Base and Fort Sam Houston,
both in San Antonio, Texas.
   American troops have been based in Panama since shortly after
the nation's independence from Colombia in 1903, peaking during
World War II when some 67,000 military personnel were there.
Despite its stated mission to protect the canal, the U.S. military
has used Panama to garner intelligence on the Sandinista government
in Nicaragua and the leftist guerrillas fighting in El Salvador.
   When the Panama Canal treaties went into effect on Oct. 1, 1979,
the American military began turning over its territory and property.
   Bases turned over the Panamanian Defense Forces so far include
Fort Amador and Albrook Army Air Field, both near Panama City, more
than 125 military homes in the former Canal Zone, and Fort Gulick,
home of the Army's School of the Americas for 35 years, which
became a training school for the Panamanians. Under U.S. control,
the school trained some 44,000 Latin American military personnel
and was widely called ``the school of the dictators.''
   The School of the Americas today operates at Fort Benning near
Columbus, Ga.
   The remaining U.S. presence in Panama includes the Jungle
Operations Training Center at Fort Sherman along the Atlantic
Coast, a Special Forces battalion, a military intelligence
battalion, an infantry brigade, Howard Air Base and Naval
operations.

<HEAD>Witnesses Say Thousands Exploited, Forced Into Underground Existence</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Immigration reforms have created a
``vulnerable underclass living in the shadows of our communities,''
immigration rights activists told a House panel.
   Thousands of undocumented aliens who do not qualify for amnesty
are ``being forced into a fearful underground and impoverished
existence,'' said Muriel Heiberger, executive director of the
Massachusetts Immigrant and Refugee Advocacy Coalition.
   The Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 act allowed
undocumented aliens who could show they entered the United States
before 1982 to apply for amnesty and prohibited employers from
hiring undocumented aliens.
   But witnesses told the House Judiciary subcommittee on
immigration, refugees and international law the law has left many
harshly exploited and with nowhere to turn.
   ``As the undocumented are forced further underground, the
immigration law is creating everything it was supposed to eliminate
_ a vulnerable underclass, living in the shadows of our
communities, facing increased poverty and exploitation,'' Ms.
Heiberger testified.
   Unscrupulous employers ``often exploit undocumented workers
fearful of reporting subminimum wages, sexual harassment and unsafe
working conditions,'' she said.
   Muzaffar A. Chishti, director of the Immigration Project for the
International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union, said the law has had
a deep impact on the so-called ``sweatshop sector.'' Employers are
``finding it easier to exploit these workers and further depress
wages and working conditions,'' she said.
   INS spokesman Verne Jervis countered that those who don't
qualify for amnesty do not have to remain in the United States.
   Jervis said the law was not intended ``to benefit the most
recent arrivals. ... The law is doing what it intended to do'' by
keeping undocumented aliens out of the work force.
   Cecilia Munoz of the National Council of La Raza testified that
spouses and children of legalized family members have had
deportation proceedings initiated against them in Chicago, Dallas,
Oklahoma City, Albuquerque, San Antonio and elsewhere.
   Jervis called that charge ``ridiculous.''

   The Electoral Tribunal nullified the
election late Wednesday after paramilitary forces beat the
opposition presidential and vice presidential candidates with pipes
and baseball bats as soldiers stood by.
   Both sides had claimed victory in Sunday's balloting, which
international observers and the opposition claimed were rigged by
forces loyal to strongman Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, who heads
the 15,000-strong Defense Forces.
   ``The elections of May 7, 1989, are declared annulled in their
entirety,'' Yolanda Pulice de Rodriguez, head of the Electoral
Tribunal, said in a nationwide broadcast. ``Constant vote stealing
at the polls, vote buying, and missing tally sheets made
proclamation (of a new president) impossible.''
   She said the outcome of the elections was ``altered by the
obstructionist action by the many foreigners called in by foreign
or domestic political forces without invitation.''
   The United States has been trying to oust Noriega for more than
a year and President Bush, charging that Noriega's forces planned
to fix the elections, had sent an uninvited U.S. delegation.
   U.S. Ambassador Arthur Davis condemned the attack on the
candidates and said dependents of the 12,000 military and
diplomatic personnel in Panama who live off-base would be moving to
military bases Thursday.
   ``By this action Noriega has demonstrated his contempt for the
Panamanian people,'' he said.
   After the election was declared null, the city went quiet as
truckloads of soldiers moved into the streets. The soldiers
searched any vehicle that moved as the trucks dropped squads off
throughout the city.
   Calls to opposition leaders found none at home.
   The government meanwhile said nothing about rescheduling the
election.
   While the White House and State Department had no immediate
comment, Terry Kneebone, a U.S. Embassy spokesman in Panama City
said, ``It makes it worse.''
   ``Noriega has closed out his options,'' he added.
   Earlier Wednesday, supporters of Noriega, Panama's de facto
leader since 1983, beat opposition presidential candidate Guillermo
Endara and his two running mates with iron bars and bats as he led
protesters alleging electoral fraud.
   Soldiers made no attempt to intervene during the attack, in
which Endara suffered a gash in the head that required eight
stitches.
   Officials said one of Endara's bodyguards was killed and four
soldiers were wounded in a gunfight. Witnesses said some of the
candidates' bodyguards leaped out of cars and fired at the
attackers.
   Later Wednesday, Endara was taken from his campaign headquarters
on a stretcher after a second attack. The New York Times reported
Endara ``had difficulty walking and his speech was slurred. His
doctor said the left side of his body was partly paralyzed.''
   Paitilla Hospital early Thursday denied Endara was being treated
there.
   Endara's two vice-presidential candidates, Guillermo Ford and
Ricardo Arias Calderon, were bloodied but not injured as seriously.
News reports said scores of others were injured.
   The three candidates were leading a motorcade through the
capital when they were attacked by civilians wearing red ``Dignity
Battalion'' T-shirts and wielding an assortment of sticks, bats,
pipes and rubber whips.
   Armed civilian Noriega supporters, often members of paramilitary
``Dignity Battalions,'' have frequently taken part in breaking up
opposition demonstrations.
   ``They beat me in the head with an iron bar,'' said Endara in a
brief hospital interview. ``I saw Arias on the ground with me,'' he
said, referring to his first vice presidential candidate.
   Arias Calderon told The Associated Press that Ford had been
arrested and taken to an undetermined location.
   The incident took place at a Defense Forces blockade, and
opposition bodyguards shot four soldiers, said Defense Forces
spokesman Capt. Eduardo Lim Yueng. He said a second lieutenant was
critically injured.
   Davis said one of Endara's bodyguards was killed.
   It was the first time soldiers suffered gunshot wounds since
Noriega came to power in this nation of 2.2 million.
   Endara, sitting in a wheelchair, displayed the stitches doctors
put in the top of his head.
   ``I blame Noriega for everything bad that has happened in the
Republic of Panama. I hope he leaves soon,'' he said.
   Angry crowds broke windows and burned at least six cars in the
downtown area. Police broke up scattered groups of demonstrators
with tear gas and gunshots fired in the air.
   The motorcade was part of an opposition campaign to gain
international support and prevent an official victory proclamation
in favor of Noriega's hand-picked candidate, Carlos Duque.
   Duque was ahead by a 2-1 ratio in the secretive official count
of the estimated 800,000 votes cast Sunday.
   More than 300 observers, including Europeans, the U.S.
delegation as well as former President Jimmy Carter, called the
election fraudulent and said Endara actually won by a 3-to-1 margin.
   The TV announcer repeated government accusations that the
opposition is trying to help the United States abrogate the Panama
Canal treaties, under which Panama gains control of the canal on
Dec. 31, 1999.
   The U.S. Southern Command had told its personnel to stay out of
public places unless on official business, and then to appear only
in civilian clothes.
   Davis said five members of the U.S. armed forces were detained,
three of them reservists who were quickly released. He said he
expected the other two to be released shortly and that they were
being treated well.
   U.S.-Panama relations have been poor since Noriega orchestrated
President Eric Delvalle's ouster in February 1988, and the CIA
reportedly contributed $10 million to the opposition campaign.
Delvalle was replaced by the acting president, Manuel Solis Palma.
   Delvalle tried to fire the general after he was indicted in
Florida on drug-smuggling and money-laundering charges, but the
Noriega-dominated National Assembly removed him from office.
Noriega claims the U.S. charges are a smokescreen to keep the canal.

<HEAD>Study Links Common Painkiller with Kidney Damage</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some doctors are warning that long-term, daily use
of a common aspirin substitute may triple the usual risk of kidney
damage, but the maker of Tylenol disputed the finding.
   ``I don't want people to panic and say, `My kids shouldn't have
Tylenol,''' said Dr. Saulo Klahr, president of the National Kidney
Foundation. ``But at the same time, it's important for people not
to take this drug daily.''
   Klahr said acetaminophen, the main ingredient in Tylenol,
Anacin-3, Datril and other brands, may accumulate in the kidneys
and cause chemical damage. A related painkiller, called phenacetin,
was taken off the market six years ago because of concern about
kidney damage and bladder cancer.
   Some experts also have worried that prolonged daily use of
ibuprofen, another common painkiller, may harm the kidneys. The
drug was released for non-prescription sales in 1985 and was not
included in the study of acetaminophen.
   The study, published in today's New England Journal of Medicine,
found no sign that aspirin is bad for the kidneys. However, it can
cause stomach irritation and bleeding and perhaps a rare childhood
disorder called Reye's syndrome.
   The new research found that acetaminophen is safe when used
occasionally. And while it raises the possibility that overuse
harms the kidneys, it does not prove this.
   ``Acetaminophen is not necessarily risk free,'' said Dr. Dale P.
Sandler, who directed the National Institute of Environmental
Health Science study.
   ``This study does not demonstrate any effect for acetaminophen
when taken as directed, which is when needed for symptoms, but when
symptoms persist, you should seek medical advice.''
   In a Journal editorial, Drs. William M. Bennett of Oregon Health
Sciences University and Marc E. DeBroe of the University of Antwerp
in Belgium cautioned that ``this finding should be considered
tentative until it is confirmed by other studies.''
   Dr. Vardamen M. Buckalew Jr. of Bowman Gray School of Medicine,
a co-author of the study, commented: ``I would be swayed toward
believing there is a cause and effect relationship between heavy
acetaminophen ingestion and renal (kidney) disease. But I would
agree with anyone who says we need to do more work.''
   The study compared 554 people in North Carolina who had newly
diagnosed kidney disease with 516 randomly chosen adults. It found
the people who took the medicine daily for an extended period had
three times the risk of kidney disease than occasional users.
   Acetaminophen accounts for 37 percent of the nation's $2.5
billion annual over-the-counter sales of pain pills, according to
the consulting firm Kline &amp; Co. Aspirin represents about 43 percent
and ibuprofen 20 percent.
   According to Kline, 71 percent of the acetaminophen sold in the
United States is Tylenol, which is made by Johnson &amp; Johnson.
   A spokesman for the company said the study was flawed, in part
because it often relied on relatives of kidney patients to
determine their use of acetaminophen and other painkillers.
   ``The study in question provides no basis to suggest that the
use of acetaminophen is associated with kidney disease,'' spokesman
Edwin C. Watson said in a statement.
   At Whitehall Laboratories, which makes Anacin-3, spokeswoman
Carol Emerling said, ``The article says it deserves further
scrutiny from the scientific community, and we will be interested
in following the results of that further scrutiny.''
   High blood pressure and diabetes are major underlying causes of
kidney disease. Sandler said that even if acetaminophen does prove
harmful, it is probably less significant than those causes.
   ``How much kidney disease is explained by this?'' Sandler said.
``A small but not inconsequential amount. The importance is knowing
that there is a risk that is preventable, whereas there is not much
we can do about kidney disease associated with diabetes.''

   A man who rented a house to an unmarried
couple and then changed his mind because he believed they were not
showing respect for Christian values is getting support from across
the country.
   ``I just couldn't allow that type of activity to go on in our
house,'' said carpenter Layle French, 33, who reneged on an
agreement that would have allowed Sue Jenson and her fiance to move
into a house he was trying to sell.
   A Minnesota administrative law judge ruled in March that French
violated a law that prohibits discrimination based on marital
status. He said the only unsettled issue is how much French should
pay in damages.
   French, a member of the Marshall Evangelical Free Church,
contends the law should take a back seat to his Christian values.
Aside from that, he maintains that couples who live together
violate the state's fornication law.
   ``We go back to a very scary time if we say landlords get to
pick the religion of tenants,'' said state Human Rights
Commissioner Steven Cooper.
   Although there is some support for the 27-year-old Ms. Jenson,
most of this politically conservative town of 10,000 residents seem
to back French.
   ``If people want to live together that's their business, but
then they should rent from someone who doesn't care,'' said Bob
Cool, who owns an office supply store.
   ``I look at the case as a morality case,'' said Lionel Bolden,
another businessman in this town 150 miles west of Minneapolis.
``Layle in essence would be responsible for what goes on in that
place.''
   ``It's really a paradox,'' said attorney James Anderson, who
organized a non-profit corporation that has raised about $1,300 for
French's appeal. ``The state is coming after Layle for upholding a
statute.''
   About 200 people attended a rally for French last month, and
petitions and letters of encouragement have streamed in from around
the country, including one from a group of about 40 Orthodox Jews
in New York City, Anderson said. About 300 people have made $1
contributions to French's legal fund, he said.
   ``As the matter works its way through the courts I think we're
going to prevail,'' Anderson said.
   French agreed on Feb. 22, 1988, to rent to Jenson, who told him
what her living arrangements would be. French changed his mind two
days later and paid a refund.
   ``I didn't feel good about it but I initially took the money
anyway,'' French said. ``My biggest, toughest thing was to go back
on my word.''
   Not knowing that Jenson complained to the state Human Rights
Department, French said he forgot the transaction until the
department wrote him in May 1988, requesting an unspecified amount
of money to pay for Jenson's damages.
   ``To me it was like they were asking for a payoff,'' French said.
   Jenson, who has since married her fiance, said she is proud of
the state and angry that French is publicizing the case as a moral
quandary.
   ``What Mr. French did was against the law,'' she said. ``He
broke a contract. This isn't about religion.''

   The key index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange rose
moderately on Thursday, and the dollar rebounded against the
Japanese yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which lost
39.52 points the previous day, recouped 89.14 points, or 0.26
percent, to finish at 34,081.49.
   The dollar ended trading at 134.55 yen, up 0.11 yen from
Wednesday's close of 134.44 yen. Opening lower at 134.18 yen, the
currency rose while moving between 134.17 yen and 134.60 yen.
   Traders said the dollar's lower opening in Tokyo followed its
similar downtrend on overseas markets.
   Japanese market players were inclined to make technical
adjustments without making major moves, said a trader with a
commercial bank in Tokyo, who declined to be named.
   The scheduled release of the U.S. producer price index Friday
also prompted the market's wait-and-see mood, the trader added.
   Other traders said the yen would not continue to rise further
because of the market's fundamental demand for the dollar.
   On the stock exchange, dealers said the Nikkei average, which
rose moderately after a slight gain in the Dow Jones industrial
average in New York overnight, did not rise further as market
players stepped off to the sidelines later.
   Nikko Securities' Yoshio Shimoyama said trading became thin in
the absence of market-affecting incentives.
   ``Participants' buying interest was still strong after
consecutive gains last week, but they couldn't determine a
direction of trading,'' he said.
   Sellings for profit-taking also resulted in the index's small
gain Thursday, Shimoyama said.

<HEAD>International Writers' Group Accepts Russian, Lithuanian Chapters</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL VERSCHUUR</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MAASTRICHT, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sixty-five years after the Soviet
Union first tried to gain membership, the PEN international
writers' association has accepted a Russian and a Lithuanian
chapter.
   Members of the 10,000-strong PEN, whose charter speaks out
strongly against censorship, voted unanimously Wednesday to admit
the two groups.
   ``We have at last obtained something we have been fighting for
for decades ... the great Russian literature with its great
traditions ... is finally among us,'' said the group's
international secretary, Alexandre Blokh.
   The association also criticized Turkey, Czechoslovakia and seven
other nations for imprisoning literary figures and journalists,
including a founder of the Charter 77 Czechoslovak human rights
group, playwright Vaclav Havel.
   Soviet participation has been an issue ever since PEN _ Poets,
Playwrights, Editors, Essayists and Novelists _ turned down an
application by the Soviet state in 1924, three years after PEN was
founded.
   PEN had kept out the Soviet Union because of its persecution of
writers and other intellectuals, and Moscow had regarded the
authors' group as anti-communist.
   The approval of the two chapters in the Soviet Union clears the
way for the opening of up to four more PEN chapters there,
including Latvian and Estonian chapters operating in exile, said
PEN's outgoing chairman, Francis King.
   In a speech made before the vote, Soviet novelist Anatoly
Rybakov told delegates that ``all worthy writers can become members
of our PEN center, including those living outside the Soviet
Union.''
   ``We want our country to have its literature, regardless of the
writer's place of residence, regardless of his beliefs and ideas,''
Rybakov said.
   ``Thirty years of Stalin's tyranny, 20 years of (Leonid)
Brezhnev's incompetent rule is long enough to ruin any society,
particularly a society that has no democratic traditions,'' Rybakov
said.
   PEN leadership and Soviet authorities agreed the new chapter
would operate independently of the official Soviet Writers' Union.
   Soviet poet Andrei Bitov conceded ``there can't be any
guarantee'' that the Soviet PEN chapters won't be suppressed or
taken over by authorities.
   But Bitov added: ``There's a kind of belief that everything's
been going in a progressive way,'' referring to President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev's policy of glasnost, or increased openness, which has
been credited for more freedom in intellectual pursuits.
   PEN criticized Turkey for jailing at least 24 dissident
intellectuals and banning two novels, including Henry Miller's
``Tropic of Capricorn.''
   PEN also called on Czechoslovakia to release Havel, who in
February was sentenced to nine months in prison. Havel had been
involved in a demonstration to commemorate the 1968 Soviet-led
invasion of his country.

<HEAD>Bomb Plant's Medical Director Was A Veterinarian, Union Complains</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Union leaders representing workers at an Ohio
uranium-processing plant complained to Congress that an animal
doctor, rather than a people doctor, led an important medical
division at the government-owned plant.
   Until recently, a veterinarian was the manager of medical
services at the Feed Materials Production Center near Fernald,
Ohio, the labor leaders told the House Education and Labor
Committee Wednesday.
   ``To me it is an obvious example of the casual attitude the
(Department of Energy) and their contractors took when dealing with
the health and very lives of the men and women who worked at these
facilities,'' said Elmer Chatak of the AFL-CIO's industrial union
department.
   A plant spokesman confirmed that David Howell, who holds a
degree in veterinary medicine, held the job until April 13.
   Howell holds several other degrees, including a bachelor's
degree in health sciences with minors in chemistry and mathematics
and a master's degree in pathology, said William Kelley, a
spokesman for the plant's operator, Westinghouse Materials of Ohio.
   Kelley said Howell did not ``perform medical evaluations,'' was
not considered the supervisor of the three physicians who work at
the plant on a subcontract basis, and ``has not been a practicing
veterinarian at all since his affiliation with Westinghouse.''
   The medical services job involves overseeing medical records and
technologists, Kelley said. A new administrator has not yet been
named, he added.
   Howell was moved to another department as part of major
reorganization in which many department heads were changed, the
spokesman said.
   The Fernald plant, about 18 miles northwest of Cincinnati,
processes uranium for use in nuclear weapons or as fuel for
reactors.
   The plant is the subject of a $300 million lawsuit on behalf of
14,000 people who live or work nearby and believe their health has
been threatened by radioactive discharges into the air and water.
The government has admitted ignoring or undermining efforts to
reduce pollution there.
   The government has estimated that as much as 552,000 pounds of
radioactive uranium dust may have escaped into the air from the
plant.
   Workers have been complaining they weren't adequately protected
from or told about the dangerous substances. Most of those
complaints have been directed against the plant's former operator,
NLO Inc., which ran the plant until 1985.
   ``It seems to me that what we have at Fernald is a work force
that has been excessively exposed to radioactive and other toxic
materials over an extended period of time,'' Chatak testified.
   ``For at least the last few years they relied on a medical
program that was directed by a veterinarian and they were studied
by DOE researchers whom they did not trust and could not believe,''
he said.

<HEAD>Fire That Killed 500,000 Lab Mice Seen as Scientific Setback</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Fire killed about 500,000 research mice
at the Jackson Laboratory, and the loss will set back scientists
around the world who depend on its purebred strains, officials said.
   Four construction workers who were remodeling the building where
the blaze broke out Wednesday afternoon were hospitalized, and at
least two firefighters were treated for smoke inhalation, officials
said.
   ``We managed to save what are called the foundation stocks ...
the original genetically defined strains'' of mice, said
Director-designate Kenneth Paigen. ``It will take us time but we
will be able to reproduce what was there.''
   Earl Green, a former Jackson director, said it would take six to
eight generations of mice, or about two or three years, to replace
the animals.
   It was unclear what effect on research the short-term mouse
shortage could have.
   With an annual budget of $27 million, the lab produces between 2
million and 3 million mice a year and provides them to scientists
throughout the country, Europe, Africa and the Soviet Union.
   Its major customers include mammalian genetics researchers at
the National Institutes of Health, Harvard, and Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, as well as major hospital research
centers, said Barbara Trevett, a Jackson spokeswoman.
   During years of breeding, the lab has produced 1,700 strains of
mice by genetic accident. The mice carry odd physical traits, some
caused by mutant genes. Studying those genes can provide clues to
human disorders, such as heart disease, diabetes, cancer and AIDS.
   Sales of the mice generate $10 million a year, which is put back
into research and other programs at the laboratory, Trevett said.
   The fire would not delay Jackson Laboratory's research because
mice used in its own experiments already had been transferred to a
different building, Paigen said.
   But he said he was concerned about preserving the jobs of 230 of
the more than 500 employees of the laboratory, the major employer
in the town of about 2,400 people.
   ``It's going to be a hard blow to the town's economy,'' said
Fire Chief Royal Higgins.
   The fire destroyed a block-long one-story brick and metal
building; 27 other lab buildings were untouched.
   The cause of the fire was under investigation. A sealant used by
the construction workers apparently helped spread the flames,
Higgins said.
   The four injured construction workers were listed as stable,
said Jeanne Dulong, of Mount Desert Island Hospital. The most
seriously burned worker was transferred to Maine Medical Center's
burn unit in Portland, she said.
   Jackson Lab, which was founded in 1929, was destroyed in a 1947
forest fire that swept across Mount Desert Island. After it was
rebuilt, the lab grew rapidly to become the world's largest center
for the study of mammalian genetics.

<HEAD>Liberal Organization Prepares to Fight Lucas Civil Rights Nomination</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A major liberal organization is gearing up for
a full-dress lobbying campaign to challenge the nomination of
William Lucas as the Justice Department's civil rights chief.
   ``We made a commitment to oppose and we won't go into it
halfheartedly,'' Arthur J. Kropp, president of People for the
American Way, said Wednesday.
   ``It is the most important civil rights position in the
government and we believe Lucas isn't qualified for that top
position,'' he said.
   The group, along with the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights,
an umbrella coalition of 180 organizations, and the NAACP
Educational and Legal Defense Fund Inc. announced this week it
would join the NAACP in opposing Lucas.
   These civil rights organizations contend that Lucas, a black
Republican who ran unsuccessfully for governor of Michigan in 1986,
lacks the necessary experience to be assistant attorney general for
civil rights.
   Kropp said his organization must ``figure out how to get our
case out to the American public'' and members of the Senate who
will ultimately vote on Lucas' nomination.
   No date has been set for Lucas' confirmation hearing before the
Senate Judiciary Committee.
   Kropp would not rule out an advertising campaign similar to one
the group waged in 1987 to help defeat Robert Bork's nomination to
the Supreme Court.
   Despite mounting opposition among civil rights groups, David
Runkel, a top aide to Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, predicted
that Lucas would not encounter serious opposition in the Senate.
   The nomination has split the civil rights movement, with such
prominent figures as Jesse Jackson and the Rev. Joseph Lowery, head
of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, supporting Lucas.
   Lucas, a former Democratic sheriff and chief executive of Wayne
County, Mich., is also backed by Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., and
the Detroit chapter of the Urban League.
   Kropp acknowledged that the split will make the fight more
difficult.
   ``Certainly Jesse Jackson brings a lot of prestige, symbolic
validation, we'll need to deal with it,'' Kropp said. ``It is not
something anyone feels comfortable with.''
   Lucas, a former Democrat, became a Republican the year before
his unsuccessful gubernatorial bid. He opposes racial quotas but
generally supports affirmative action.
   Besides his lack of experience in civil rights, opponents cite
Lucas' record as sheriff of Wayne County, which includes Detroit.
   A panel of state judges once cited Lucas for contempt of a court
order to reduce overcrowding and improve conditions at the Wayne
County Jail. A federal appeals court also criticized Lucas for
failing to investigate allegations of brutality against several
deputies.
   Lucas has said jail conditions were out of his control because
of a fiscal crisis in local government and he only learned of the
brutality charges years later.
   Runkel said Lucas ``has a very impressive record of achievement
in the civil rights area.
   ``When he became sheriff of Wayne County less than 1 percent of
the detective force was black. After 12 years as sheriff that had
increased to 20 percent of the detective force.
   ``Bill Lucas' experience is not significantly less than other
people,'' said Runkel, who noted that other civil rights chiefs
``did not have significant litigating experience in civil rights.''
   He called Lucas a conciliator whose approach to civil rights
issues was well suited to the Bush administration's policies.
   ``Our intention is to try to move forward on contentious civil
rights issues in a constructive way and not get involved in
contentious legal disputes that might only delay the providing of
civil rights,'' Runkel said.

<HEAD>Bush Administration to Urge Protection of African Elephant</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration says it plans to come
to the rescue of the African elephant, whose numbers are being
threatened by ivory hunters.
   Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan said Wednesday he has told U.S.
representatives to an international conference next October to push
for increased protection of the elephant.
   The United States at the meeting will urge that the African
elephant be placed in a more protected classification under the
international endangered species treaty, thereby prohibiting any of
the 101 treaty nations from engaging in the commercial trading of
ivory.
   The U.S. decision met immediate praise from several conservation
and animal protection organizations which have for some time wanted
the United States to take a more direct interest in protecting the
African elephant.
   ``The United States is by far the most influential member to
come out in favor of the proposal. This should carry a lot of
weight,'' said Priscilla Feral, president of Friends of Animals,
which earlier this year petitioned the Interior Department to take
action to protect the elephant.
   Susan Lieberman, associate director of wildlife and environment
for the Humane Society of America, said U.S. leadership in ending
the worldwide ivory trade ``is critical'' to protecting the African
elephant.
   ``No trinket is worth the death of an elephant and the
extinction of a species,'' she said.
   Since 1978, the number of African elephants found in 34
countries has declined from 1.5 million to as few as 400,000,
according to the government and private groups. The number
continues to decline at a rate of 8 percent a year, largely at the
hands of ivory-seeking poachers, they say.
   Last year the United States imported $32 million worth of ivory,
most of which originated with the African elephant.
   ``I am deeply concerned about the future of the African
elephant,'' said Lujan in a statement announcing that the
department also is considering changing the African elephant's
classification from ``threatened'' to ``endangered'' under the U.S.
endangered species law. He told department officials to come up
with a recommendation.
   Conservationists believe the action by the 101 nations that
belong to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered
Species to place the African elephant on a more restrictive list
would severely cut into the international ivory trade.
   Lujan said officials of the Fish and Wildlife Service will urge
action by the 101 nations at the October meeting. A two-thirds vote
is needed for the elephant to be reclassified.

<TEXT>
   Dissident groups charged today that a
radical student was tortured and killed by police interrogators and
they called for peaceful protests to demand the fall of President
Roh Tae-woo's government.
   About 5,000 students rallied today at Chosun University in the
southeastern city of Kwangju to denounce police for the death of
Chol-kyu Lee, according to Yonhap, the South Korean news agency.
   Some cut their fingers and wrote anti-government slogans in
blood.
   Lee, a 24-year-old student at Chosun, had served almost two
years in jail for violating national security laws and was being
sought by police for writing articles praising communist North
Korea.
   His body was found Wednesday in a reservoir near Kwangju, police
said.
   The United National Democratic Movement, the main dissident
alliance, alleged Lee was tortured and killed by police
investigators assigned to suppressing dissident groups.
   Dissidents and Lee's family claimed the body showed signs of
electric torture and beatings.
   Police denied involvement in Lee's death and officials said
leftists may have killed the student as part of an attempt to cover
up anti-government activities. An initial autopsy showed no signs
of torture, but it appeared Lee was slain, they said.
   Dissident groups charged that a special police unit, the Joint
Investigation Team, set up earlier this year to suppress violent
anti-government groups, may have been involved in Lee's death.
   The unit had announced Wednesday it arrested 234 dissidents
since April 3 for anti-government activity.
   The discovery of Lee's body came after six riot troopers were
killed May 3 in a clash with radical students in the southern port
of Pusan. The government ordered a major crackdown on violent
dissidents after the troopers were killed.
   South Korea has been hit by a wave of violent anti-government
protests and labor strikes in recent months. Police have rounded up
dozens of suspects as part of efforts to crush dissident groups.
   The National Student Council, the main alliance of South Korea's
radical students, charged that Lee was tortured and it demanded
that police officers involved be arrested and punished.
   ``We will fight to the end if there is any attempt to cover up
or fabricate the truth,'' said council head Lim Chong-suk.
   Thousands of riot police were on alert for demonstrations Friday
in the central city of Taejon and in Kwangju on Saturday to mark
the anniversary next week of a 1980 anti-government uprising in
Kwangju in which at least 192 people were killed.
   Some dissident and radical student groups have said they will
stop violent protests because of the deaths of the riot troopers in
Pusan. But Lee's death could provoke new unrest, especially if
police attempt to block protests.
   Radical students and the anti-government dissident groups have
little support because of their violent tactics and extreme
political views. The radicals have been calling for the overthrow
of Roh and the creation of a leftist state ruled by workers and
farmers.
   The government has warned that efforts by radicals to build an
alliance with workers threatens stability. Strikes have cost the
economy almost $4 billion in lost production so far this year,
officials say.

<HEAD>FBI Believes Iran Planted Flight 103 Bomb But Can't Indict</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The FBI doesn't have enough evidence to seek
an indictment despite the CIA's conclusion that Iran was
responsible for last year's bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over
Scotland, The Washington Post reported in today's editions.
   A CIA assessment of the Dec. 21, 1988, bombing has concluded
that Iran hired a Syrian-based Palestinian organization to carry
out the operation, sources told The Post.
   The sources also said the FBI is investigating the possibility
that one of two American college students who had Arab boyfriends
may have been the unsuspecting courier who carried the bomb onto
the flight.
   The explosion over Lockerbie, Scotland, killed 270 people. The
flight had originated in Frankfurt, West Germany, and stopped in
London before heading to New York.
   The CIA is confident of its conclusions blaming Iran, but the
FBI doesn't believe sufficient evidence exists to seek indictments
against the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General
Command, the newspaper said.
   The organization is headed by Ahmed Jibril, who with his senior
aides met at least once last fall with Iranian officials in Tehran,
the Post reported.
   Published reports previously have linked Jibril's organization
to the bombing.
   Jibril has denied that his organization planted the bomb but
acknowledged in an ABC News interview broadcast last Friday that
his group routinely used the same kind of explosive device that
investigators say blew up the Pan Am jumbo jet.
   Jibril's first lieutenant, Hafez Dalkamoni, who Jabril said
commonly built and used the bombs, is jailed in Germany after a
police raid last October that netted weapons and three bomb devices
like the one used to blow up Flight 103.
   Jibril has denied that his group receives money from Iran but
has said he shared Iran's outrage at how the United States last
year shot down an Iran civilian passenger plane.
   ``I see now that the incident of the Pan Am is neither worse nor
uglier than the destruction of the Iranian airbus,'' Jibril told
ABC. ``Both of them are crimes against civilians, whether by the
U.S. administration or by terrorist groups who may have blown up
the Pan Am. They are equally barbaric.''
   While denying his group's involvement, Jibril issued a warning
should the United States or Israel strike his camps in Syria. ``We
shall not remain still. Our response shall be equal if not more
violent,'' he said.

<HEAD>Wright Seeks to Have Charges Dropped as Ethics Committee Digs Deeper</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House ethics committee plans to dig deeper
into a lucrative Texas gas investment by House Speaker Jim Wright
as lawyers for the Texas Democrat seek to pare down the list of
charges already filed against him.
   And the panel's chairman, Rep. Julian Dixon, D-Calif., gave a
strong vote of confidence to special outside counsel Richard
Phelan, the Chicago lawyer who conducted the long probe that so far
has produced 69 charges that Wright violated House rules.
   Attacks on Phelan's professionalism by Wright's lawyers are
``totally inaccurate, totally wrong and an exercise in bad
judgment,'' Dixon said, adding that he has ``total confidence in
him.''
   At the same time, the Justice Department expressed renewed
interest in the Wright matter and in particular his connection with
allegedly illegal campaign contributions made in 1985 for a special
Texas House election.
   The ethics panel met for 2{ hours on Wednesday and voted to make
available to Wright's lawyers some witnesses and documents that
have figured in its 11-month investigation of the Texas Democrat.
   But the panel denied Wright's motion to bar Phelan from having
any private contact with the ethics committee, a decision in line
with its belief that he is acting more as a staff member of the
panel than as a prosecutor.
   It also directed Phelan to investigate further the Sabine Lake
gas drilling venture which boosted Wright's worth substantially
last year.
   The investment involves a gas well near the Texas-Louisiana
line, which Wright and Mallick bought into for $9,120 last January.
They sold their interest less than five months later for a $340,000
profit, even though the well's production had dwindled.
   The committee wants to know whether the deal amounted to another
gift to Wright by investors seeking to curry favor with a powerful
legislator. The panel last week interviewed five Texans involved in
the well deal and decided other witnesses still need to be heard
from, Dixon said.
   Wright's defense team, beefed up this week to include eight
lawyers, filed a new motion on Wednesday asking that the two most
serious charges be dismissed because they are based on faulty
interpretation of House rules.
   The attorneys asked that the ethics panel drop charges that
Wright evaded House rules limiting outside earned income through
bulk sales of a book he wrote, and that the speaker improperly
accepted $145,000 in gifts from Fort Worth developer George
Mallick, who was deemed to have had a direct interest in
legislation before Congress.
   The charges amount to ``a house of cards delicately balanced on
a series of unprecedented reinterpretations of House rules,''
according to the motion.
   One member of the defense team, Rep. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J.,
said it is clear that House rules have grown outmoded and need to
be revised. ``They are dated, time has passed, circumstances have
changed and ethical standards have appropriately risen,'' he said.
   But he said the ethics committee is seeking to apply those
higher standards to Wright retroactively, which is unfair to the
speaker.
   Also on Wednesday, chief Justice Department spokesman David
Runkel said the department plans an independent review of Wright's
business and political dealings once the House ethics process runs
its course.
   ``I expect the department will take an independent look'' should
the House exonerate Wright, Runkel said. The department has been
collecting publicly available information on the Wright case for
several months, and plans to have its public integrity section
review the evidence for possible criminal violations.
   Runkel said such a review would cover matters brought up by the
ethics committee and ``other matters that have been raised,'' such
as Wright's involvement in a 1985 political fund-raising effort in
Texas.
   In testimony last week at a federal fraud trial in Dallas,
Wright was linked to a political action committee that collected
allegedly illegal contributions from officials of Commodore Savings
and Loan, an insolvent Texas thrift. A witness said Wright was said
to have promised to block legislation seen as unfavorable by the
S&amp;L industry in return for $250,000 in donations to the PAC, but
Wright has denied the charge.
   On Wednesday, three former Commodore employees testified they
gave money to the PAC, known as East Texas First, and later were
reimbursed by their company, either through pay increases or checks
for fictional travel.
   Former Commodore president E. Morten Hopkins, his brother Robert
and John W. Harrell, former Commodore CEO and vice chairman of the
board, are being tried on charges they misused Commodore funds to
make illegal PAC contributions.
   East Texas First raised and spent about $100,000 to help Rep.
Jim Chapman, D-Texas, win the 1985 special election.

<HEAD>Exxon Envisions Gradual Buildup Of Cleanup Crew</HEAD>

<DATELINE>VALDEZ, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Exxon vowed to put 1,600 more workers on
Alaska's shores, but said it would take up to six weeks to get them
to the front lines of the nation's worst oil spill.
   Exxon's promise came Wednesday after the Coast Guard ordered it
to expand its cleanup. State and federal officials have repeatedly
criticized Exxon for moving too slowly to clean up the March 24
spill.
   An Exxon spokesman said the number of shore-based workers would
reach 5,000 by late June.
   Exxon said the buildup had to be gradual to provide training and
housing.
   ``You've got to house all these people, you've got feed these
people, you've got to train them,'' said spokesman Henry Beathard.
   Coast Guard Adm. Paul A. Yost told a Senate hearing in
Washington that despite the increased manpower he considers it
almost impossible for Exxon to clean all the oil from more than 300
miles of shoreline by its Sept. 15 target date.
   As part of its cleanup plan, Exxon also has requested that some
environmental laws be waived so it can burn off the oily wastes and
process oily water at the Valdez treatment plant normally used by
oil companies to clean bilge water from their tankers.
   Both options were scorned at a hearing Wednesday night. Speakers
expressed concern about air pollution from the burning, and said
the terminal plant was inadequate for Exxon's needs.
   Exxon expects to collect more than 55,000 tons of contaminated
material, from tainted water to soiled clothing worn by cleanup
workers.
   ``I feel the people of Valdez, the people of Cordova and the
people of Prince William Sound have given their fair share of blood
in this situation,'' said James Winchester, a local
environmentalist. ``I think you boys ought to go home and work this
through again.''
   Earlier, the Coast Guard ordered Exxon to beef up its cleanup
operation and provide federal officials with weekly, detailed
operations schedules of cleanup work outside Prince William Sound,
where the Exxon Valdez tanker ran aground and spilled its load.
   The order, announced in Valdez by Vice Adm. Clyde Robbins, was
the Coast Guard's official response to the Exxon cleanup plan
submitted May 1 for Coast Guard approval.
   The oil, spreading steadily, has fouled beaches along Alaska's
coast as far south as Wide Bay, about 450 miles southwest of
Valdez. Authorities said Wednesday they also discovered oil patches
on the west coast of Kodiak Island.
   The crippled tanker is being repaired at Naked Island in Prince
William Sound. According to the Coast Guard, Exxon plans to move
the 987-foot vessel to Portland or the Far East next month.
   The hull was ripped open by the crash and there are huge
boulders inside the cargo hold, scooped up as the craft scraped
against the reef, said Robbins, the Coast Guard's on-site commander
of the spill cleanup.
   He said it appeared doubtful that Exxon could meet its Sept. 15
cleanup deadline. ``I am seriously concerned that the investment of
resources you describe will not be able to clean the 300-plus miles
of shoreline in the time alloted,'' Robbins said in a letter to
Exxon general manager Otto Harrison, the company's ranking
executive in the spill zone.
   Workers, meanwhile, toiled on the four islands hardest hit by
the spill in the sound, hoping to clean the shores a few days
before seals begin their annual birthing cycle about May 20.
   There are about 10,000 seals in the sound, and between 25 and 50
percent may have been in areas affected by the spill, said Mary
Sigman, a biologist with the Alaska Department of Fish and Game.
   No seal deaths have been attributed directly to the spill,
although biologists say they have seen heavily oiled seals.
   As of Tuesday, the U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service said there had
been 613 confirmed sea otter deaths and 9,918 bird kills.

<TEXT>
   This just in: The climate of the Earth changed
dramatically 20 million years ago when high plateaus rose up in
Tibet and western North America.
   With new threats to the climate looming, upwards of 3,000
scientists have gathered here this week for the American
Geophysical Union's semiannual exchange of ideas on weather and
climate, volcanoes, earthquakes, water, the solar system and even
politics.
   Several hundred listeners assembled Wednesday to hear Rep.
Richard A. Gephardt, D-Mo., discuss the need for leadership to
combat the threats of global warming, acid rain and wasteful energy
policies.
   ``You don't have to be an alarmist to recognize that if the
Earth's average temperature rises as much as five degrees ... it
will completely change our way of life,'' observed Gephardt.
   In another hall, William Ruddiman of Columbia University's
Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory explained his calculation
showing that the rise of the mountains in Tibet and western North
America forced the winds to shift direction around them, causing
climate changes that led to the ice ages.
   Scientists have long speculated about the reasons for the ice
ages. Ruddiman, a marine geologist, and John E. Kutzbach, a
climatologist from the University of Wisconsin, say computerized
models of the Earth's climate are convincing them that the rising
mountains and high plateaus were the major factor in cooling off
North America and the northern parts of Europe and Asia.
   In addition, they said, those shifts in the wind helped change
the flow of ocean currents and led to conditions that promote the
summer monsoons in Asia, dry summers in California and the
Mediterranean and increase the cold winter winds in parts of the
western United States.
   A pair of National Aeronautics and Space Administration
scientists, meanwhile, reported their conclusion that the barrage
of charged particles from the sun may be contributing to the damage
to the Earth's protective ozone layer.
   Linwood Callis reported that the flow of high-energy particles
from the sun leads to the formation of oxides of nitrogen in the
upper parts of the stratosphere.
   In turn, those nitrogen compounds can settle into the
stratosphere where ``if you have any kind of significant buildup,
then what you have is the possibility of catalytic destruction of
ozone,'' said Callis.
   Ozone helps protect the earth from potentially damaging
ultraviolet radiation from the sun. Losing some of the ozone could
lead to an increased incidence of skin cancer.
   ``What the model calculations show and that the data confirm is
that from 1979 to 1985 the (nitrogen oxide) levels in the polar
lower stratosphere probably increased between 30 and 80 or 90
percent. In the equatorial region there have been increases, much
smaller, on the order of 10 or 15 percent,'' Callis said.
   Damage to the ozone over the South Pole has been widely
discussed in recent years. Callis said that so-called Antarctic
``ozone hole'' appears to be largely a result of chlorine compounds
trapped over the polar areas, since ice particles in this region
tend to remove many nitrogen compounds from the air.
   ``The interest that we have in this is primarily related to
global ozone ... there are larger than expected ozone changes,''
said Callis.
   In the air about 16 miles above the surface, the area where
ozone is most concentrated, Callis and Dan Baker found the gas
depleted by as much as 14 percent between 1979 and 1985, Callis
said.
   Natural changes in the solar cycle should reduce the amount of
incoming charged particles between now and the mid-1990s, said
Callis, and he and Baker are anxious to see if ozone levels will
recover during that period.
   While modern and ancient climate changes were under discussion,
the massive convention center swarmed with students in jeans,
geologists in string ties, nervous speakers rehearsing their
presentations and political advocates proclaiming the Greenhouse
warming a hoax.
   A steady drizzle dampened arrivals, while an appropriately
placed booth emblazoned ``Hydrology'' greeting them just inside the
main entrance.

   Latin American leaders say allegations
of election fraud in Panama and violence against the opposition
could further isolate that country from the region's democracies.
   Late Wednesday, Panama's electoral commission nullified the
presidential election after Guillermo Endara, the opposition
candidate, and his two vice presidential candidates were beaten by
government supporters. Officials said one of Endara's bodyguards
was killed in an ensuing gunfight.
   In a statement released in Brasilia and Montevideo, Uruguay,
seven Latin American foreign ministers said the turbulence ``could
distance even further the Panamanian government and democratic
community of Latin America, during a historic moment in which free
and popular expression is advancing in a way never before seen in
our region.
   ``We believe the best defense of the interests of nations and
peoples of Latin America can be achieved only through free
expression and the popular will.''
   The statement was signed by the Group of Eight nations, which
actually has seven members _ Peru, Argentina, Uruguay, Brazil,
Venezuela, Colombia and Mexico. Panama was suspended after Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega, the nation's de facto ruler, engineered the
ouster of elected President Eric Delvalle in February 1988.
   The Group was formed in 1986 to analyze methods of reducing
Latin America's $400 billion foreign debt.

<HEAD>House Panel Chairman Says Acid Rain Bill Would Unfairly Burden Nine
States</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A House panel chairman, demonstrating that the
acid rain debate will again pit blocks of states against one other,
says proposed legislation to cut sulfur dioxide emissions would
place an unfair burden on nine states.
   Rep. Philip R. Sharp, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce
Committee's energy and power subcommittee, wrote President Bush on
Wednesday that the nine states account for 52 percent of sulfur
dioxide emissions, considered the leading cause of acid rain.
   But Sharp said three congressional proposals introduced so far
would require the nine to achieve 77 percent of the nation's
required reductions. The affected states are Ohio, Indiana,
Missouri, Pennsylvania, Kentucky, Illinois, Tennessee, West
Virginia and Georgia.
   Sharp, D-Ind., wrote Bush because the administration is
developing its own acid rain proposals, which could be submitted to
Congress this month.
   ``Nine states in the nation should not be cleaning up both their
own and somebody else's portion of the national reduction,'' Sharp
told Bush in the letter.
   Sharp said the proposed legislation would emphasize reduction of
sulfur dioxide emitted from older, coal-fired electric power plants
rather than from industrial facilities. The nine states, because of
their geography, use coal-fired plants largely because they do not
have access to hydro-power and natural gas, Sharp said.
   ``A pound of sulfur dioxide, removed from the air, is of equal
benefit to the environment whether it is removed from a small
industrial facility in Texas or a large power plant in the
Midwest,'' the letter said.
   In the past, the Northeast, the primary victim of acid rain,
sought immediate action while Midwestern states feared controls on
their coal-fired plants would boost electric bills.
   States that produce large amounts of high-sulfur coal _ Indiana,
Illinois, Ohio, West Virginia and Pennsylvania _ worried that
controls would cause massive job losses in the coal industry.
   The West, where low-sulfur coal is mined and acid rain is a less
serious problem, has been reluctant to pay the cost for new
controls.
   Acid rain is formed when sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide are
converted in the atmosphere into acids, which travel far from their
starting points to pollute lakes and forests and, according to
health experts, cause serious respiratory problems for asthmatics,
children and the elderly.
   The leading sources of sulfur dioxide are coal-burning power
plants and industrial facilities. Nitrogen oxides are emitted in
approximately equal amounts for asthmatics, children and the
elderly.

<HEAD>Man Targeted In McCarthy Hunt In '50s Dies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   O. Edmund Clubb, a Foreign Service officer who
was cleared of McCarthyite charges of disloyalty but resigned after
being reassigned to an obscure job, has died. He was 88.
   Clubb, who had residences in New York and in Palenville, died of
Parkinson's disease Tuesday at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center.
   Clubb served more than two decades in the Foreign Service, and
was the last American diplomat stationed in Beijing after the
Communist takeover in 1949.
   After he took down the flag there in April 1950, he returned to
Washington and was named chief of the China desk at the State
Department, but was suspended a year later as a security risk.
   Clubb was condemned by a loyalty board but was cleared on
appeal. He was then assigned to an obscure State Department job and
resigned after deciding his career was ruined.
   In 1932, Clubb reported from China that the Communists were
popular in the regions they controlled and that the U.S.-supported
Chinese Nationalists were corrupt but that they might force the
Communists to flee to the west.
   His prediction foreshadowed the Long March, and was later to be
cited by his critics as evidence of his pro-Communist leanings.
   Clubb was born in South Park, Minn., and enlisted in the Army at
17.
   In 1928, he qualified for the Foreign Service and was sent the
next year to Beijing.
   Later in Indochina, Clubb was captured by occupying Japanese
forces two days before Pearl Harbor and was held for two months in
solitary confinement and six months more with other internees, then
exchanged for Japanese held by the Allies.
   He spent most of the rest of the war and the immediate postwar
period in the Soviet Far East, Manchuria and China.
   After his government career, he became a writer, teacher and
lecturer at several universities, settling at the East Asia
Institute at Columbia University.
   In an article in The New York Times in 1971 favoring a
withdrawal of American armed forces from the Far East, Clubb argued
that ``the United States has no divine call to act as the world's
mentor and policeman.''
   Survivors include his wife, Mariann; son, Oliver E. Jr. of
Syracuse; and daughter, Zoe Gleysteen of Washington.

<HEAD>Jesse Jackson Dances Around Questions About DC Mayoral Aspirations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson isn't ruling out a campaign for
mayor of Washington, D.C., but says he's ``not looking for
something to do'' and has no current plans to run.
   Facing persistent questions about reports he is weighing a race
for mayor of the nation's capital, Jackson repeated his pledge not
to challenge embattled incumbent Marion S. Barry Jr.
   But he declined to say what he would do if Barry steps aside.
   ``I need not deal in the hypothetical,'' Jackson said. ``I take
this process of public service seriously, and I take it one day at
a time.''
   The two-time candidate for the Democratic presidential
nomination responded to questions about the mayoral race at a news
conference following an appearance before a Senate committee where
he called for a federal law making voter registration easier and
more accessible.
   Entering the hearing, Jackson got a taste of the speculation
about his future that has filled political circles.
   ``Should we be saying, `Welcome, Mr. Mayor?''' Sen. Edward
Kennedy, D-Mass., asked jokingly as Jackson took his seat at the
witness table.
   ``I think it's out of order,'' Jackson responded.
   Jackson dismissed a Washington Post poll showing he would be the
runaway leader if he runs for mayor, saying it would not influence
his thinking.
   ``As a matter of fact, if they conducted a poll on who Democrats
would want nationally to be the (presidential) nominee, I'd be No.
1 in that poll as well,'' he said. ``So I must keep all those polls
in focus.''
   The poll said Jackson would win 68 percent of the vote to 17
percent for Barry. The poll of 1,021 registered voters in the city
also found that Barry, facing declining support because of
questionable behavior and mounting city problems, would lose in
one-one-one matchups with four other possible challengers. The poll
had a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points.
   Jackson lives in Chicago and would have to move to Washington by
this November, a year ahead of the mayoral election, if he is to
become a candidate.
   He owns a vacant home in the city and is renovating it. Jackson
said the renovations are ``for practical reasons'' because he is in
Washington several days a week and intends to use it instead of
staying in hotels.
   ``I've said very clearly and often I have no plans to run for
mayor of Washington,'' Jackson said. ``I support the current mayor
as mayor of Washington, D.C., and my position is as clear as it can
be.''
   Jackson said that he is active as president of the Rainbow
Coalition, the political and civil rights group he founded, and is
not ready to give up national political ambitions.
   ``I'm sufficiently busy. I'm not looking for something to do,''
Jackson said.
   ``If there is ever any change in my basic work priorities, I'll
be all too willing to share it with you,'' he said.

<HEAD>Dollar Rebounds Against Yen, Stocks Up</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar rebounded today against the
Japanese yen while the Tokyo Stock Exchange's main index gained
moderately.
   The dollar closed at 134.55 yen, up 0.11 yen from Wednesday's
134.44 yen finish. It opened at 134.18 yen and ranged from 134.17
yen to 134.60 yen.
   The U.S. currency had declined 0.56 yen on Wednesday after
closing Tuesday at 135.00 yen, its highest closing in eight months.
   Today, speculative investors bought the dollar near the day's
lowest levels, said Minori Takeuchi of Chemical Bank in Tokyo.
   ``It's not much of a rise considering it hit a high of 134.70
yen in New York overnight, but still, Japanese investors'
fundamental demand for the dollar remains the same,'' she said.
   Ms. Takeuchi said reports of two economic indicators today and
Friday also are likely to boost demand for the dollar because
market players expect no slowdown in the U.S. economy in April.
   The United States is to announce April figures for retail prices
this monring and for producer prices on Friday.
   On the stock market, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, a
39.52-point loser Wednesday, climbed 89.14 points, or 0.26 percent,
closing at 34,081.49.
   ``The Nikkei rose moderately, but trading was thin because a
majority of market players remained on the sidelines due to
uncertainties over foreign exchange rates and Japan's discount rate
hike,'' said Yoshiro Inouye, an analyst at Nomura Securities.
   Media and market players have speculated that the Bank of Japan
will raise its official discount rate by at least 0.5 percentage
point to 3.0 percent late in May, but the central bank has not made
any official announcement.
   ``Scheduled releases of two major U.S. economic figures later
today and Friday also made participants feel reluctant to make
major moves,'' Inouye said.
   Volume traded on the first section was estimated at 750 million
shares, down from Wednesday's 900 million. Among gainers were
steel, shipbuilding and construction issues.

<HEAD>Second-Generation Philanthropist C.S. Harding Mott Dead at 82</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FLINT, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   C.S. Harding Mott, who teamed with his
father to develop and sustain what is now the nation's 12th largest
charitable foundation, has died. He was 82.
   Harding Mott, chairman emeritus of the Flint-based Charles
Stewart Mott Foundation, died in his sleep Wednesday at a nursing
home in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. He had maintained a permanent
residence in Delray Beach, Fla., and maintained a summer home in
Flint.
   Harding Mott played a low-key but crucial role with the
foundation begun in 1926 by his father, who served 60 years on the
General Motors Corp. board of directors and once was the
automaker's largest individual shareholder.
   ``They shared an office for close to 30 years and he (Harding
Mott) adored his father,'' said Harding Mott's son-in-law, William
S. White, who was named foundation chairman when Mott became
chairman emeritus last year.
   ``He, for many years, stayed out of the limelight,'' White said.
``He was a quiet, humble leader.''
   Charles Mott supported the foundation decades after its
formation. But it burgeoned when Harding Mott, an original
foundation trustee, persuaded his father in 1963 to donate 1.8
million GM shares worth $129 million at the time.
   When Charles Mott died in 1973 at age 97, the foundation
received all but $1.3 million of his $43.3 million estate.
   Last year, the foundation awarded grants amounting to $34
million to projects focused mainly on community and individual
improvement, spokeswoman Judy Samuelson said.
   Harding Mott graduated in 1931 from Yale University and served
as a Mott Foundation vice president from 1944 to 1965, when he was
named its president. Mott held that post until 1976, when he was
named chairman.
   After being named chairman emeritus, Mott remained a board
member and held ad-hoc positions on each board committee.
   Survivors include Mott's wife Isabel; son, C.S. Harding Mott II;
and daughter, Clair M. White.
   There will be no funeral service.

   The space agency announced Wednesday that President Bush had
selected the name ``Endeavour`` after it was the most popular name
in a national name-the-shuttle competition among America's school
children.
   The Endeavor was the flagship used by 18th century English
explorer James Cook.
   Thirty-one of the 111 state-level winners in the competition
chose the name Endeavour, although many of the entries used the
American spelling of Endeavor. Second most popular among the state
winners, with 12 selections, was Resolution.
   The competition was in two divisions, kindergarten through grade
6, and grades 7 through 12. NASA selected a winning entry in each
category.
   The winning entry for kindergarten through grade 6 was from the
fifth graders of Senatobia Middle School in Senatobia, Miss.
   Winning in the other division was Tallulah Falls School,
Tallulah Falls, Ga.
   For their winning project, the Mississippi fifth graders created
a space camp where younger children were taught about space.
   The Tallulah Falls entry had two parts _ a magazine called
``Math Exploration with James Cook,'' and a play called ``Where on
Earth?'' which compared Cook's explorations with the voyages of a
space shuttle called Endeavour.
   More than 6,100 teams, formed by 71,650 students, submitted
research projects supporting the names selected. Panels from each
of the state education agencies then sorted through the entries and
picked state winners in the two divisions. From these state
winners, Bush made his selection.
   Endeavour was the name James Cook chose for the 98-foot vessel
he used to explore the South Pacific from 1768 to 1772. He sailed
southwest from Plymouth, England, around South America, then
explored the coasts of New Zealand, Australia and New Guinea before
returning to England by way of Africa's Cape of Good Hope,
completing a circumnavigation of the Earth.
   Cook chose the name Resolution for a ship he used in his second
and third voyages exploring the Pacific Ocean. During those trips,
Cook went as far north as the Arctic Ocean and as far south as the
Antarctic Circle. He located and named the Sandwich Islands, later
called Hawaii, and was killed there in 1779.
   The second vessel in Cook's company during his final voyage was
named Discovery, the same as that given to one of the current space
shuttles.
   Challenger was destroyed Jan. 28, 1986 in an explosion that
killed seven astronauts. When Congress authorized money for a
replacement shuttle, it directed that America's school children
would name the new craft.
   The new shuttle craft is now being built by Rockwell
International in Downey, Calif. It is scheduled for completion in
1991 and will make its first space voyage in March 1992.

   A nuclear aircraft carrier will be christened
the USS United States, the first time a ship has borne that name
since the War of 1812.
   The name was one of 14 announced Wednesday by Navy Secretary
William L. Ball for ships that have been approved for construction.
   Ball, a Reagan administration appointee who is about to step
down from office, said a nuclear-powered carrier that Congress
authorized for construction last year would carry the designation
CVN-75 and be named the USS United States ``in honor of our
nation.''
   Only one previous ship has borne the name _ a sailing frigate
that fought during the War of 1812. The Navy does have another
carrier on active duty named America, however.
   Ball said he had selected 13 other names for four
Ticonderoga-class cruisers; four Arleigh Burke-class destroyers;
four fleet oilers, and one fast combat support ship.
   The names selected for the cruisers _ all commemorating various
battles _ include Port Royal; Lake Erie; Cape St. George, and Vella
Gulf.
   The names selected for the Burke-class guided-missile destroyers
_ all honoring various individuals _ include the Stout; McCain;
Mitscher, and Laboon.
   The names selected for the new oilers are Big Horn; Guadalupe;
Yukon, and Rappahannock. And the fast combat support ship will be
named the Paul Hamilton after a former secretary of the Navy.

   Chanel suits, conversations in French and
exclamations of ``Darling, how are you!'' are as much a part of the
annual spring art auction blitz as multi-million dollar price tags
and Japanese investors.
   Hundreds of paintings by Picasso, Monet, Warhol, Pollack and
others make the sales at Christie's and Sotheby's auction houses an
art-lover's dream. More than a half-billion dollars' worth of art
will be sold during the 12 days of blockbuster sales that began May
2.
   On Wednesday, record prices were paid for Impressionist and
modern paintings as bidders set marks for eight artists at a
Christie's auction. A Claude Monet painting sold for $14.2 million.
   A day earlier, Picasso's 1901 self-portrait ``Yo Picasso'' sold
for $47.85 million at Sotheby's, second only the $53.9 million for
Vincent Van Gogh's ``Irises'' in 1987.
   As the rich rub elbows over Degas and Dali, they're not just
ferreting out their personal favorites and the best investments.
They're also offering people-watchers a firsthand look at how the
other half lives.
   At a recent Sotheby's auction, comments like ``How are things in
Berlin?'' and ``I just got back from London'' were almost as common
as pearls and Chanel handbags with leather-and-gold chains.
   A cocktail party at Christie's, where clients previewed art over
asparagus-and-salmon hors d'oeuvres, featured lots of ladies in
black off-the-shoulder dresses pecking each other on the cheek. A
crimson velvet tunic here and a red satin fringed shawl there lit
up the sea of black.
   ``If I fall in love with something, I might buy it,'' said Eva
Kollsman, a silver-haired woman in a gold-and-black spangled tunic.
``But I think a lot of people come here to get free food, free
drink and that's about it. They haven't the vaguest intention of
bidding on anything.''
   Among the non-buyers was Sarah Schulte, who got on the party
guest list through a relative.
   ``I was listening to one man who thought a Renoir was a steal at
$3 million, and I thought, I'm in the same room with this person,''
she said. ``It's very New York, and I love to do things that are
very New York.''
   Berenice Berke Hetkin, wearing a dashing black hat and a
red-and-black polka-dotted top, attended the party as a possible
buyer, but added: ``If you run into somebody you know, it's a
plus.''
   Art collector John Dallas disagreed: ``Sometimes you see people
you know and you don't want to talk to them because they might
influence your bidding.''
   Seats at blockbuster auctions are reserved for collectors, but
anyone can get a free ticket to stand by calling in advance.
Michelle Porcella, a painter from New Jersey, braved the crowded
public section at Sotheby's on Tuesday because, she said: ``It
gives me inspiration to keep going. I know I'm going to be
successful and it's inspiring to know that people will pay so much
for art.''
   Her friend, Gail Miller, said the auction's art and fashions
give her ideas for her work as a jewelry designer. ``I watch what
people wear from the ladies' room on.''

<HEAD>NBC Vows to Run `Roe Vs. Wade' Without Ads, If Necessary</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHRYN BAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Armed with reviews from TV critics praising the
made-for-TV movie ``Roe Vs. Wade,'' NBC is asking advertisers to
stand up to pressure groups seeking to block the film about the
case that legalized abortion.
   In a May 8 letter to advertisers, NBC President Robert C. Wright
vowed to air the movie as scheduled Monday without advertising if
advertisers pull out.
   ``I'm not writing this letter to simply sell commercial time,''
Wright wrote. ``We will underwrite this project without support, if
necessary. We're very proud of `Roe Vs. Wade.'''
   NBC said the status of advertising time sold during the two-hour
film was still unsettled and probably would be until the broadcast
date.
   The fact-based movie stars Holly Hunter as a character based on
Norma McCorvey, the then-anonymous ``Jane Roe'' plaintiff who sued
Dallas District Attorney Henry Wade in the case that went to the
Supreme Court. Amy Madigan plays attorney Sarah Weddington.
   The abortion battle heightened when the high court heard
arguments April 26 in a Missouri case that could affect the 1973
decision.
   The movie is about the pro-choice advocates who prevailed in
1973, but also portrays sympathetically the prosecutors who argued
the other side, though they get much less attention.
   ``This is discriminatory programming against an entire class of
people in the United States,'' said John C. Willke, president of
the National Right to Life Committee.
   ``It is clearly strong pro-abortion propaganda. There is
absolutely no claim that can be made that this is balanced, not
remotely.''
   He said his group was calling on NBC affiliates to refuse to
show the movie, or provide anti-abortion groups with at least 30
minutes of time to refute the views they believe the movie
represents.
   In an unusual move, NBC allowed advertisers to screen the film
before deciding whether to sponsor it.
   ``A few have withdrawn. Others have been added,'' said NBC
spokesman Curt Block. ``We haven't identified any of the names of
advertisers in or out and expect it will be fully sponsored. The
next couple of days are going to be crucial.''
   Wright's letter quoted favorable reviews of the movie and said
advertisers should be concerned about threats of boycotts as a way
for pressure groups to control program content.
   ``NBC firmly believes the decision about where your messages
appear rests with you and your marketing people _ not with those
who have a predisposition to judge a program's merits based on
their own agenda and no information,'' said Wright's letter.
   NBC News' Tom Brokaw will anchor a 30-minute special later in
the evening to discuss abortion, but Willke wasn't impressed.
   ``Baloney,'' he said. ``They are controlling the discussion.''
   In his letter, Wright referred to recent cases of advertisers
pulling out of TV programs because of pressure from groups and
individuals who find them offensive. He mentioned no specifics, but
shows that have been targeted recently include Fox's raunchy sitcom
``Married ... With Children'' and NBC's cuttingly satirical
``Saturday Night Live.''
   ABC recently canceled two ``reality-based'' specials, ``Crimes
of Passion II'' and ``Scandals II'' due to lack of advertiser
support because of their expected lurid content. Both were sequels
to previous specials that garnered good ratings.

<TEXT>
   The nullification of elections in Panama was
necessary because the opposition, instigated by the United States,
violated election laws and attempted to rig the results, the
official Tass news agency claimed today.
   The Electoral Tribunal in Panama City late Wednesday invalidated
Sunday's election, saying the stealing of ballots, vote-buying and
missing tally sheets made proclamation of a new president
impossible.
   Both sides had claimed victory in the balloting, which
international observers and the opposition claimed were rigged by
forces loyal to strongman Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Tass, in a dispatch from Panama City, claimed supporters of
opposition presidential candidate Guillermo Endara had violated
election procedures.
   ``They blockaded polling stations, preventing ballot boxes from
being taken to the commission's headquarters in good time,'' Tass
said. ``A considerable number of ballot papers were stolen or
destroyed and several ballot boxes were burned.''
   Witnesses and international observers said soldiers loyal to
Noriega had stolen ballots from polling stations where voting
heavily favored the opposition.
   Tass said that as results were coming in, ``The opposition,
directly instigated by the United States, started heightening the
atmosphere by resorting to obviously provocative and subversive
actions.''
   Tass said allowing the election results to remain valid posed
``unpredictable consequences for the country's future.''
   The decision to nullify the election ``appears to be
extraordinary, but the only correct one,'' the news agency said.

<HEAD>Ability to Freeze Human Embryos Raises Questions for Couples</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The recently acquired ability to freeze
human embryos has produced more than 150 babies for previously
infertile couples, but it is posing difficult questions for
prospective parents, a psychiatrist says.
   Before having embryos frozen, couples should legally document
their wishes on such questions as what to do with the embryos if
the parents divorce or die during the process, said Dr. Michael
Vergare.
   Other issues include what should happen to stored embryos if the
woman enters menopause and can no longer be implanted with them,
said Vergare, associate chairman of the psychiatry department at
the Albert Einstein Medical Center in Philadelphia.
   Vergare spoke at a news conference and in an interview Wednesday
at the annual meeting of the American Psychiatric Association.
   Such ethical questions are beginning to appear in the nation's
courtrooms.
   A Los Angeles-area couple on Wednesday sued a Norfolk, Va.,
in-vitro fertilization center for refusing to release an embryo
that was frozen 23 months ago.
   The couple want to remove their embryo from the Jones Institute
for Reproductive Medicine so that a California doctor can attempt
to implant it in the woman.
   In another case, the divorce of a Tennessee couple has turned
into a battle over custody of seven of the woman's eggs that are
fertilized with her husband's sperm and kept in frozen storage. A
Knoxville court has scheduled a hearing in July to determine if the
embryos are ``joint property'' of Mary Sue Davis and Junior Lewis
Davis, or subjects for a custody decision.
   Good embryo-freezing programs provide legal documents that deal
with such issues, as well as others such as what to do with embryos
if the organization that is storing them goes out of business,
Vergare said.
   At his institution, couples are required to ponder the issues
before proceeding with the freezing, he said.
   Embryo-freezing has become part of in-vitro fertilization
programs, with which normally infertile couples can have children
with the help of egg-fertilizing in the laboratory.
   Virtually every major city now offers programs with
embryo-freezing, said Vergare, who is psychiatric consultant to the
Einstein center's in-vitro program.
   Babies born so far from frozen embryos have appeared generally
healthy and normal, Vergare said. The technique has been used
sucessfully in animal husbandry for years, but whether it will
prove to have long-term effects in people is unknown, he said.
   ``Cows aren't expected to study algebra,'' he said.
   In the case filed in federal court in Norfolk, Steven and Risa
York asked for $200,000 for alleged emotional damages and the
immediate release of their embryo.
   Between August 1986 and July 1987, when the couple lived in New
Jersey, Ms. York went to the institute four times to attempt
in-vitro fertilization. Doctors managed to fertilize 12 of her
eggs, and 11 of those were implanted without success, according to
court papers.
   The 12th embryo was frozen for future implantation, but the
Yorks moved to California and later notified Dr. Suheil J. Muasher,
director of the Jones Institute, that they wanted to take the
frozen embryo to Los Angeles, where local doctors would implant it.
   Dr. Howard W. Jones Jr., co-founder and president of the
institute, said agreeing to the Yorks' request could set a
precedent by forcing the release of fertilized eggs to doctors who
might be unqualified to perform the procedure.

   Opposition vice presidential
candidate Ricardo Arias Calderon said he froze when he saw the iron
bar coming.
   ``But at the same time my assistant pulled me away and the bar
missed my head by a few inches.''
   Arias Calderon was describing how he was attacked Wednesday by a
gang of thugs loyal to Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   His presidential running mate Guillermo Endara and second vice
presidential candidate Guillermo Ford suffered head injuries during
the clash.
   The violence put an end to a peaceful demonstration that
escalated into a confrontation and an exchange of gunfire.
   Four security men were wounded and one of the candidates'
civilian bodyguards killed, officials said.
   The demonstrators were protesting government attempts to
``steal'' an election they say Endara won. Both sides claimed
victory.
   The opposition cavalcade had wound through the streets of Panama
City until it stopped in front of a group of riot troops.
   ``We were talking with an officer in charge about withdrawing,''
Arias Calderon said. ``We were told to wait. At that moment the
paramilitary broke through the ranks of the riot police and started
shooting.''
   Witnesses said the candidates' bodyguards leaped out of cars and
started returning fire, although Arias Calderon denied his men had
weapons.
   Witnesses also said the demonstrators had thrown rocks and
bottles at the paramilitary ``Dignity Battalions,'' who were
standing behind the riot police.
   ``I ran into an alley with other people,'' Arias Calderon said.
   ``People were falling into each other. I fell and then about
five people fell on top of me. I could not breathe. Then I heard
someone say `my vice president', and he and others picked me up and
took me inside a store.''
   The man who picked him up, Gilberto Cardenas, said he and others
also picked up Endara and put him in a truck to take him to a
hospital.
   The Dignity Battalion is made up of civilians recruited into
armed groups with the expressed purpose of defending Panama in case
of a U.S. invasion, which Noriega has been saying could happen.
   Noriega, head of the Defense Forces, has been de facto leader of
Panama since 1983.
   ``The world knows ... that what's at stake here is not Panama
Canal (as the government claims) but the desire of a people to be
free,'' said Arias Calderon.

   Troops took to the streets today
after the government nullified the elections and opposition
candidates, beaten by supporters of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega,
apparently went in hiding.
   Opposition presidential candidate Guillermo Endara and his two
running mates had been beaten by bat- and pipe-wielding civilian
thugs. U.S. officials said one of their bodyguards was killed.
   Soldiers, who did not interfere as the candidates were beaten
Wednesday afternoon, had halted an opposition motorcade protesting
what international observers have called the government's theft of
Sunday's elections.
   The demonstration had sought to rally international opinion
against Noriega and prevent the proclamation of his candidate,
Carlos Duque, as president.
   U.S. Ambassador Arthur Davis condemned the attack and called the
nullification, announced late in the day, as a ``cowardly act'' of
contempt for the choice made by the Panamanian people.
   Davis said dependents of the 12,000 military and diplomatic
personnel in Panama who live off-base would be moved today to
military bases to ensure their safety. U.S. personnel were told to
stay out of public places unless on official business, and then to
appear only in civilian clothes.
   Washington has been trying for more than a year to oust Noriega,
the country's de facto leader since 1983 and Defense Forces chief.
   The opposition said Wednesday's attack showed Noriega, who has
not been seen in public since the weekend, is getting desperate.
   ``They now know they cannot carry out the electoral fraud they
planned. It is already a scandal throughout the world,'' said first
vice presidential candidate Ricardo Arias Calderon, who also was
beaten.
   Second vice presidential candidate Guillermo Ford was beaten
bloody and, like Endara, suffered a head wound. Arias Calderon said
Ford and several other opposition officials including press
spokesman Luis Martins were apparently under arrest.
   Davis and other officials said one of the candidates' bodyguards
was killed and about 20 demonstrators injured. The military said
four soldiers were wounded in an exchange of gunfire that followed
the attack on the candidates.
   Also Wednesday, the government expelled nine foreign
journalists, accusing them of spreading misinformation. The
expelled included an Cable News Network correspondent and two
reporters working for the Voice of America.
   Vote counting had yet to be finalized in this country of 2.2
million when the electoral commission announced the balloting had
been voided.
   In a proclamation, it cited vote-stealing, vote-buying, missing
tally sheets and international interference as behind the move. The
commission said nothing about rescheduling the vote.
   More than 300 observers, including Europeans, the U.S.
delegation as well as former President Jimmy Carter, backed
opposition claims that Endara won by a 3-to-1 margin.
   ``This does not change anything. It makes it worse,'' Terry
Kneebone, a U.S. Embassy spokesman, told The Associated Press.
``Noriega has closed out his options.''
   Yolanda Pulice de Rodriguez, head of the Electoral Tribunal,
charged in a nationwide broadcast that the outcome of the vote was
``altered by the obstructionist action by the many foreigners
called in by foreign or domestic political forces without
invitation.''
   President Bush, charging that Noriega's forces planned to fix
the elections, had sent an uninvited U.S. delegation. In addition,
the CIA reportedly contributed $10 million to the opposition
campaign.
   Opposition supporters throughout the city began beating on pots
and pans after the nullification announcement, chanting ``Endara is
my president.''
   But the streets quieted as truckloads of soldiers appeared,
dropping squads off around the city. The soldiers searched buses,
trucks and cars for weapons.
   Members of Panama's 15,000-strong Defense Forces also were
reported on the move in other cities.
   Dozens of telephone calls to opposition leaders at homes,
offices and hotels after the election announcement found not even
one.
   Endara, who suffered a scalp wound that took eight stitches to
close, was spending the night in Paidilla Hospital, according to
his wife, but the hospital said he was not there.
   ``I blame Noriega for everything bad that has happened,'' Endara
said in a brief hospital interview during the afternoon.
   Angry crowds broke windows and burned at least six cars in the
downtown area. Police broke up scattered groups of demonstrators
with tear gas and gunshots fired in the air.
   The attack on the candidates occurred as they were touring the
city from the bed of a pickup truck. When the pickup was halted by
a police blockade it was surrounded by a group of men wearing
``Dignity Battalion'' T-shirts and waving iron bars, baseball bats
and rubber hoses.
   ``By this action Noriega has demonstrated his contempt for the
Panamanian people,'' said Davis at a news conference.
   The government, in television broadcasts, accused the opposition
of trying to set the stage for U.S. intervention.
   Government television showed footage of U.S. intervention in the
Dominican Republic, of a CIA-inspired coup in Guatemala, and of the
coup that toppled President Salvador Allende of Chile.
   The opposition rejects Noriega's accusations that it is trying
to help the United States violate the Panama Canal treaties, which
cede the canal to Panama by the year 2000.
   Washington began its campaign to oust Noriega after he
orchestrated President Eric Delvalle's ouster. Delvalle had tried
to fire Noriega after the general was indicted in Florida on
drug-trafficking charges in February 1988. Noriega denies the drug
charges.

   A man charged with killing his ex-wife with an
assault rifle then going on a three-hour aerial rampage _ buzzing
buildings and firing at cars _ had been placed on probation just
hours before the shooting.
   Alfred J. Hunter, 42, had been convicted Tuesday of assault and
battery and of violating a protective order stemming from a New
Year's Eve fight with his wife over which television station to
watch.
   She had first asked for a restraining order in January 1988. The
couple's six-year marriage ended in divorce four months later.
   Salem District Court Judge John T. Doyle placed Hunter on one
year's probation.
   The trouble began later that evening when police in Danvers,
about 20 miles north of Boston, responded to a domestic dispute
call. They found the body of Elvira Hunter, 30, in her apartment,
shot several times with an AK-47 assault rifle, state Trooper Mark
Lynch said.
   Lynch said the couple's 5-year-old son saw his father kill his
mother.
   Hunter fled, stole a car from a restaurant in nearby Peabody and
then commandeered a Cessna airplane, which he flew helter-skelter
over a 60-mile area of Greater Boston, dive-bombing buildings and
firing the automatic rifle, police said.
   He was captured when he landed at Logan International Airport
early Wednesday, was charged with murder and armed robbery and
ordered held without bail for 20 days' psychiatric observation.
   Before the assault and battery conviction, Hunter had pleaded
guilty in 1979 to assaulting a group of people with a machete and
was sentenced to one year's probation. Hunter told police the group
had tried to rob him.
   The machete incident did not show up in the probation papers
given to the judge before Tuesday's sentencing, Essex County
District Attorney Kevin Burke said.
   ``I'm not sure that the outcome would have been any different,''
Burke said.
   A court-appointed pychiatrist, Dr. David Swenson, said Hunter
told him during an examination Wednesday that he had been treated
for psychiatric problems at a Veteran's Administration Hospital and
was taking a minor tranquilizer, Lorazepam, for anxiety. Hunter
served in Vietnam.
   Police today were piecing together Hunter's flight from hundreds
of witnesses' reports.
   Stockbroker Andrew Smith was walking to a tavern when he heard
popping noises from the sky and spotted a low-flying plane.
   ``About two seconds later, several shell casings landed all
around. At that point I realized that the guy was shooting out of
his plane,'' Smith said.
   During the flight, Hunter dipped under a bridge, veered within
50 feet of motorists and buildings and fired at targets including
parked cars and the Prudential tower's 50th floor skywalk.
   Police in Boston received more than 200 calls about shots being
fired. In suburban Lynn, police said two cars were hit in a shower
of gunfire believed to have come from the plane.
   Logan air traffic controllers twice evacuated the tower. They
said Hunter buzzed them repeatedly, forcing officials to close the
airport for an hour and reroute late-night flights.
   ``We have a very thick handbook on the rules of air traffic
control, but there's nothing in there about what to do if a maniac
comes shooting an AK-47 at you in the control tower,'' said John
Leyden, a spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration in
Washington.

   A Titan rocket packing a secret
Pentagon payload streaked off on an apparently routine flight into
orbit, but the fiery blastoff ignited brush fires that closed the
launch area for more than an hour.
   The $65 million Titan 34D lifted off at 3:47 p.m. Wednesday and
appeared to be flying normally through a partly cloudy sky.
   As with other military space flights, the Air Force did not
announce the launch in advance. But with more than 20,000 employees
working at Cape Canaveral and adjacent Kennedy Space Center, it
couldn't hide the fact that the 16-story-tall rocket was going to
be launched.
   Minutes before liftoff, hundreds of workers poured out of
buildings to watch.
   The Air Force issued a brief post-launch statement saying only
that a Titan 34D had been launched successfully. It provided no
information on the nature of the payload.
   There was no damage to launch pad from brush fires triggered by
the rocket's exhaust, officials said.
   Lt. Gen. Aloysius Casey, retiring commander of the Air Force
Space Division, told a conference last year that the first Titan
34D launched in 1989 would carry up two communications satellites
named DSCS _ for Defense Satellite Communications System.
   The satellites are built to provide secure voice and high data
rate transmission for American military and diplomatic
communications.
   Sources close to the project who spoke on condition of anonynity
said Wednesday the satellites were aboard the Titan 34D.
   A Chalet satellite designed to monitor Soviet communications
networks was aboard a Titan 34D launched last Sept. 2. An upper
stage failure left that payload in the wrong orbit.
   On Nov. 6, a Titan 34D successfully launched a payload believed
to be a pair of satellites intended to monitor Soviet missile tests
and electronic communciations.
   One Titan 34D remains in the Air Force inventory. It is
scheduled for launch from Cape Canaveral later this year and will
be replaced by the more powerful Titan 4.
   The first Titan 4 is scheduled for launch here within a few
weeks, carrying a satellite designed to provide instant warning of
a hostile missile attack on the United States.

<HEAD>Miners Return to Work after Agreement Reached; Bug Found In Solidarity
Office</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Miners at four southwestern copper mines
ended a six-day strike today and returned to work after winning 30
percent pay increases plus higher bonuses, a Solidarity spokesman
said.
   In another development, Solidarity called on the Interior
Ministry to investigate the planting of an eavesdropping device in
one of its campaign offices after local officials refused to look
into the matter.
   Preparatory work to reopen the mines began with the first shift,
following the acceptance of the agreement by workers on Wednesday
night, said Jan Sugalski of Solidarity, a member of the strike
committee.
   Normal work at the mines was to start in the afternoon, he said.
   The strike which began May 5 and involved up to 20,000 miners
had been the first major instance of labor unrest since the April 5
signing of a broad agreement between Communist authorities and the
Solidarity-led opposition.
   The agreement led to the reinstatement of Solidarity after a
seven-year ban and a government promise to allow the opposition to
run for one-third of the seats in Parliament's lower house and all
the seats in its new Senate.
   The June elections are to be the first open balloting in the
East bloc.
   The free trade union movement said the strike was inspired by
the official OPZZ unions but joined by Solidarity members
frustrated by high inflation, which has reached an 80 percent
annual rate this year.
   Sugalski said the miners won a 30 percent increase in basic
wages plus a 30 percent bonus if production goals are met. They
originally demanded a 50 percent increase in basic pay.
   The increase in basic wages averages about $1.40 a day, he said.
The miners now earn $112 to $169 a month.
   ``Solidarity helped miners win pay for the period of the strike,
and we are very happy about it,'' said Sugalski.
   The agreement also calls for ``urgent changes'' in the pay
system, he said. Miners have long complained that the pay structure
undervalues labor performed during the normal five-day work week,
forcing miners to work weekends to make ends meet.
   The strikes were at four mines near the city of Lubin, about 200
miles southwest of Warsaw. The official PAP news agency said the
strike reduced output by 100,000 tons of ore daily.
   Poland is the world's eighth-largest producer of refined copper.
In 1987, it exported to the West more than 161,000 tons, worth
about $233 million.
   Solidarity workers found the electronic eavesdropping device in
campaign offices in the northern provincial capital of Slupsk,
union spokesman said Jacek Moskwa said Wednesday.
   Hew told a Warsaw news conference that the device was found
Tuesday in a wall in the Solidarity Citizens Committee office the
city about 50 miles east of the port of Gdansk.
   Government spokesman Pawel Byra said he knew nothing about it.
   ``The Slupsk case sheds a clear and worrying light on methods
applied by the coalition-government side in the election campaign.
It was proved again that the Polish state is still an instrument of
a political monopoly,'' said a statement released by Solidarity's
national citizens committee.
   The committee is coordinating the free trade union movement's
campaign for June's partially democratic elections.
   Moskwa said the Slupsk committee asked the local prosecutor's
office to investigate, but it refused. The national committee then
complained in Warsaw at the Interior Ministry, which oversees the
police.

<TEXT>
   The government's announcement that
the presidential election had been nullified was accompanied by a
level of gringo-bashing seldom seen in Latin America.
   Stern voices on government radio told of alleged U.S. attempts
to undermine the elections, and television viewers were shown clips
from bad movies, documentary footage of the 1965 Dominican Republic
uprising and the 1962 Bay of Pigs fiasco.
   Film showing unspeakable torture scenes was broken up by
flash-frames of the CIA emblem and headquarters, U.S. troops
training and former President Lyndon Johnson, who sent American
soldiers to quell the uprising in the Dominican Republic.
   Then it was back to movie clips in which sinister American plots
were discussed to topple governments.
   A Cuban documentary said foreign intervention, especially
American, had brought poverty and misery to Panama. ``Now,
together, we will conjugate the verb `to decolonialize,''' it said.
   A government program showed American firepower and pictures of
the Panama Canal and said the United States intends to keep the
canal after the turn of the century in violation of 1977 treaties.
   On national radio, a speaker went down a list of countries
friendly to the United States.
   ``Guatemala? They can't even take care of or clean up their own
situation.
   ``Costa Rica? What can we say about Costa Rica?'' the speaker
asked, alleged that it was well known that the Nobel Prize won by
President Oscar Arias in 1987 was bought and paid for.
   News programs of Wednesday's parade that ended in the beatings
of opposition candidates for president and vice president said the
violence was provoked by ``Attacks by paramilitary troops of the
opposition to create for the United States a justification to
invade Panama just as they did in the Dominican Republic in 1965.''
   There was no mention of the beatings or of the death of one
candidate's bodyguard.
   The government statement nullifying the vote partly blamed the
United States:
   ``The normal development of the elections was altered by
obstructionist acts of many foreigners called here by political
forces within or outside the country who did not have an invitation
from the Electoral Tribunal and whose obvious aim was to circulate
the idea of electoral fraud proclaimed to the world by American
authorities well before the elections.''
   President Bush had sent an uninvited delegation that virtually
crashed the election and was highly critical of the process.
   Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, head of Panama's Defense Forces and
the nation's de facto leader, started promoting the theme of the
United States as a threat more than a year ago when he was indicted
in Florida on drug charges and the United States mounted a campaign
to force him from power.
   But Panama has had closed ties with the United States over the
years and Panamanians have mixed feelings about their neighbor to
the North.
   ``I have a son in the United States Marine Corps. I'm not
against the United States, I suppose we're friends,'' said Eric
Arce, who works in an electronic supply house. ``But they have no
right to intervene in our affairs.''
   Romulo Aguilar, a restaurant worker, said: ``I thought President
Bush had more common sense. Who are we, his children?''

<HEAD>Four Professors Leaving English Faculty; Alleged Sexual Incident

<DATELINE>PRINCETON, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of Princeton University's
English department says his recent resignation was prompted in part
by lenient treatment of a professor accused of making sexual
advances on a student.
   Emory Elliott is one of four members of the English faculty to
resign since a controversy erupted over the September incident,
which involved a male English professor and a male graduate student.
   The professor, Thomas McFarland, 62, was suspended that month
for one year. Faculty members had hoped he would be eased out
altogether, Elliott said.
   The student who allegedly was the target of the advance reported
it to police last week, but it was unclear if charges would be
filed.
   Kim Otis, a lawyer representing the student, said his client
told police it was a ``criminal assault of a sexual nature'' but
denied the student was alleging rape or sexual assault.
   Otis said there was a ``definite reason'' the student did not go
to police sooner, but the attorney refused to elaborate.
   Robert Wills, McFarland's lawyer, said the student's delay cast
doubt on his allegations.
   University officials have refused to comment on McFarland's
suspension or on the alleged incident. The Princetonian, the
student newspaper, reported that the episode occurred after an
English department party.
   Elliott, who is leaving for the University of California,
Riverside, said his disillusionment with the Ivy League school's
administration mounted after it notified the faculty in January it
would allow McFarland to return in the fall.
   ``We had been given hope early on in the fall there would be a
resolution, that the professor would accept some kind of other
position or early retirement, that we would not be looking forward
to his return to the classroom,'' Elliott said.
   Several English students said in interviews that the dispute
over McFarland was part of a deeper morale problem in the
department that stemmed partly from insufficient financial support.
   Another of the departing professors, Margaret Doody, said the
university's handling of the matter was ``a very serious factor''
in her decision.
   The other English faculty members reportedly leaving Princeton
are Sandra Gilbert and Valerie Smith, both feminist literary
critics. Neither returned messages left Wednesday on their home
answering machines.

<HEAD>Report Urges Routine AIDS Testing for All Adults</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   All Americans under age 60 should be encouraged by
their doctors to be tested for the AIDS virus, regardless of their
risk of being infected, two physicians recommend today.
   Currently, most experts recommend limiting routine AIDS testing
to people who are at obvious increased risk of the disease.
   In their report in the New England Journal of Medicine, Drs.
Frank S. Rhame of the University of Minnesota and Dennis G. Maki of
the University of Wisconsin said doctors should take a more active
role in promoting AIDS testing for their patients.
   ``Our greatest concern is to reach the great number of persons
infected with HIV who are not availing themselves of any current
options in testing and who are not confronting their risk for HIV
infection,'' they wrote.
   Testing reveals infection with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.
People may carry this virus for many years before becoming sick.
   They said that doctors might raise the subject with patients by
saying: ``I recommend an HIV test to all my patients because some
people who have risked exposure to HIV don't realize it, and many
persons whose activities put them at risk find it difficult to
disclose them.''
   Among the benefits of widespread testing that they cited:
   _People who know they are infected will benefit from earlier
treatment with the AIDS drug AZT as well as therapy for infections
associated with AIDS. Such medicines can prolong people's lives but
not cure the disease.
   _People who know they are infected may be more careful not to
pass the virus on to others.
   _Taking the test would remind people that AIDS is potentially a
problem for anyone.
   _Candidates for research studies of new AIDS drugs would be
identified.
   ``We are recommending HIV testing vigorously to all U.S. adults
under the age of 60 regardless of their reported risk history,''
the doctors wrote.
   The doctors said they doubted that aggressive testing programs
would drive people away from the medical care system, as some have
argued. They said that falsely positive results _ another argument
against widespread testing _ would be rare.
   They said the suggestion that infected people should be
protected from the bad news is ``somewhat paternalistic'' and
counter to the trend toward a patient's right to know.
   ``In essence, we are arguing that HIV infection should be
treated as much as possible like another infectious disease,'' they
wrote.

   The dollar rose in active European trading this
morning. Gold firmed in stagnant trading.
   Traders said demand for the dollar resumed after a pause
Wednesday. ``Demand for the dollar is quite sustained,'' said a
trader in Milan, Italy.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar rose 0.11 yen to a closing 134.55. Later, in
London, it was quoted at 134.80 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Wednesday:
   _ 1.9105 West German marks, up from 1.9047
   _ 1.7030 Swiss francs, up from 1.6925
   _ 6.4578 French francs, down from 6.4645

   _ 1.1843 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1849
   In London, one British pound cost $1.6660, compared to $1.6717

   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $377.25 a troy ounce,
unchanged from late Wednesday. At midmorning, the city's five major
bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $377.70.
   In Zurich at noon, the bid price was $377.80, from $376.75 bid
late Wednesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold dropped 98 cents to close at a bid

<HEAD>Bradley Admits `Error in Judgment' in City Hall Address</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor Tom Bradley gave a brief admission of
guilt before a hastily gathered City Council session, saying he had
erred in judgment by taking money from companies doing business
with the city.
   But council members said Wednesday's admission would not lower
the heat for Bradley, facing the crisis of his political career for
accepting fees from Far East National Bank and Valley Federal
Savings &amp; Loan.
   ``I've been very proud of the high level of unquestioned
integrity and character, which have been a part of my 47 years of
public service in this city,'' Bradley said.
   ``So let me state, frankly, that I made an error in judgment by
engaging in outside employment, which, although not legally wrong,
has created the perception that I fell short of my own high
standards in government.''
   Bradley made the remarks in a two-minute address to the council,
then left without taking questions from either council members or
reporters.
   Not all of the council's members were satisfied.
   ``I don't think it was clear enough; I don't think it was
convincing enough,'' said Councilwoman Gloria Molina.
   Bradley ``didn't address the issue of lying, the inconsistencies
in his statements,'' said Councilman Michael Woo, who heads a
council panel overseeing the city attorney's investigation of
Bradley.
   Council members Robert Farrell, Joel Wachs and Ernani Bernardi,
however, stood to applaud the mayor.
   City Attorney James Hahn is investigating whether there was a
conflict of interest in Bradley receiving payment to serve on the
boards of the two financial institutions while they did business
with the city.
   In addition, the Securities and Exchange Commission is looking
into stock investments handled for Bradley by Drexel Burnham
Lambert.
   ``I was insensitive not to realize that accepting outside
employment could create the perceptions we see today,'' Bradley
said. ``I will always regret it.''
   The issue of Bradley's finances arose shortly after the former
city councilman and police lieutenant was elected in April to an
unprecedented fifth term as mayor of the nation's second-largest
city.
   Bradley has returned $18,000 paid him by Far East National Bank
to serve as an adviser. He has announced he will resign from Valley
Federal's board of directors, a position that paid him at least
$71,800 over the last 11 years.
   The city's investigation will continue, council members said.
   ``Maybe he asked for forgiveness, but the process has to move
forward,'' Councilwoman Joy Picus said. ``I suspect that he thought
maybe it would end it, but it couldn't possibly, in reality.''

<TEXT>
   A judge who dismissed a charge against
Grand Ole Opry star Bill Monroe for allegedly hitting a woman in
the face with a Bible also ordered the woman to stay away from the
bluegrass pioneer.
   Sumner County Judge Jane Wheatcraft dismissed the assault and
battery charge on Wednesday and expressed her sympathy for Monroe.
   ``I know this warrant has been an embarrassment to you,'' the
judge told Monroe.
   ``I'm so happy,'' he said outside the courtroom. ``It's been
difficult with people bothering me. I'm glad it's over.''
   When Wanda Huff arrived Wednesday for the hearing, Sheriff
Richard Sutton confiscated a loaded .25-caliber pistol from her
pickup truck.
   Monroe's lawyer Bob Ingrum said he requested the search because
Mrs. Huff said several times she had received word someone wanted
to kill Monroe.
   Prosecutors told the judge they had witnesses who said Mrs. Huff
called Monroe's office and home, sometimes up to 15 times a day and
often using aliases.
   A tearful Mrs. Huff denied making the harassing phone calls.
   ``You can pay people to tell all kind of lies,'' she said as she
left the parking lot.
   ``I've been deceived. I've been betrayed. I got beat up,'' she
said. ``I did not threaten to kill him. If I wanted to, I could
have when we were alone.''
   The Bible incident allegedly took place after Mrs. Huff, 51,
asked Monroe, 77, to swear on it that he hadn't been seeing other
women. Mrs. Huff has been described only as a fan of the musician.
   Before the May 1 Bible incident, she had called the farm to warn
workers she was coming to see Monroe to retrieve some gifts she
gave him, Assistant District Attorney Dee Gay said.
   Ingrum said Mrs. Huff wanted to take back some blue jeans, a tie
tack, a hatband and $27 for garden seeds she had given Monroe.
   ``She threw the britches in the yard, the hatband in the mule
yard and the $27 in Mr. Monroe's face,'' Ingrum said. ``We never
did find the tie tack, and she threw her glasses on top of the
roof.''
   Monroe called Goodlettsville police to throw Mrs. Huff off his
farm, Gay said. She asked them to arrest Monroe, but they refused
to file charges against him.
   Mrs. Huff went to a magistrate, who issued the assault warrant.
Monroe was arrested May 2, and released on $500 bond.
   Ingrum obtained a temporary restraining order Wednesday
instructing Mrs. Huff to stay away from Monroe. Mrs. Huff agreed to
comply, Gay said.
   Monroe, known for the song ``Blue Moon of Kentucky'' and many
bluegrass hits, said he didn't like publicity about the incident,
``but my good friends and fans know it was wrong.''

<HEAD>Gherman Gets Stiff Sentence in Scam</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A financial planner who bilked clients of millions
of dollars was sentenced to 30 years in prison and ordered to pay
$12.9 million in restitution.
   U.S. District Judge Stanley Marcus sentenced Henry Gherman on
Wednesday on seven embezzlement and mail fraud convictions.
   Marcus said the reason for the stiff sentence was because there
were many victims, ``real people, not large institutions,'' who
lost money as a result of Gherman's fraud.
   ``As the fraud unveiled, he took almost $5 million of these
people's money,'' Marcus said. ``To this day, vast amounts of money
remained unaccounted for.''
   Many of the dozens of clients bilked were doctors and nurses who
entrusted Gherman with their pension plans. They believe he
swindled some $20 million since starting his ``one-stop shopping''
investment and financial planning firm in 1970.
   Gherman, charged with misusing $10 million of his clients'
money, claimed that most of it was wiped out by the 1987 stock
market crash.
   ``I never schemed, I never planned it,'' Gherman told the judge.
``I never set out to do this. I never converted other people's
money to my own benefit or that of my family.''
   He showed no reaction as the sentence was read. Gherman's
relatives, including his wife of 33 years and their two daughters,
were in tears.
   Gherman was arrested last October in Tokyo and was returned to
Miami by federal marshals Dec. 28.

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Rain drenched the Northeast early today, with as much as an inch
reported in the past 24 hours, and the mercury dipped into the 20s
in the northern Great Lakes.
   A low pressure system off the mid-Atlantic Coast was pumping
moist air into the region and triggering rain from New England into
the upper Ohio Valley.
   Some of the rain was heavy. Islip, N.Y., received more than 1}
inches of rain in the six hours that ended at 2 a.m. EDT.
   By early today, rainfall over the past 24 hours had totalled
nearly 1} inches at New York's John F. Kennedy Airport and over 1\
inches at Pittsburgh.
   Flood watches were in effect throughout the day for southeast
New York state and much of southern New England.
   Behind the rain, overnight temperatures dropped into the 20s and
30s over the northern Great Lakes.
   Further west, showers and thunderstorms were widely scattered
across the Rockies.
   A low pressure area off the California coast scattered rain
across portions of the state, with the heaviest rainfall in the San
Joaquin and Sacramento valleys.
   Winds were strong and gusty across the desert regions of
Southern California.
   Today's forecast called for rain and thunderstorms from the
northern and middle Atlantic Coast states across the lower Great
Lakes and upper Ohio Valley; afternoon and evening thunderstorms
across the northern and central Rockies, parts of Utah and Nevada
and western Texas; scattered showers over the northern Pacific
Coast; and strong, gusty winds from the northern Plains to the
central and southern Rockies.
   Highs were expected to be in the 50s from the northern and
middle Atlantic Coast across much of the Ohio Valley and Great
Lakes, the northern Rockies, Idaho, and parts of Nevada and Utah;
the 80s from much of the Florida Peninsula across southern
Louisiana, southern Texas, the southern Rockies and southern New
Mexico and Arizona; and the 60s and 70s in much of the rest of the
nation.
   Temperatures at 2 a.m. EDT ranged from 26 degrees at Marquette,
Mich., to 78 degrees at Key West, Fla.

<HEAD>`Godmother,' Others Charged In Cult Leaders' Killings</HEAD>

   The woman called the ``godmother'' of a
drug-smuggling cult that killed 15 people along the U.S. border has
confessed to taking part in ritual slayings, U.S. and Mexican
authorities say.
   Sara Aldrete Villarreal, 24, and two other alleged cult members
were charged Wednesday in the weekend deaths of their leader and
his right-hand man, authorities said. Police say the two had
ordered their own deaths.
   A source in the Mexico City attorney general's office said Ms.
Aldrete has a split personality, and U.S. Customs Agent Oran Neck
told a news conference that she ``confessed to conspiracy and
involvement'' in ritual killings.
   The three were not charged in those killings.
   Neck returned to Brownsville, Texas, on Wednesday from a 72-hour
trip to Mexico City after assisting Mexican authorities in the case.
   Ms. Aldrete, a Mexican who attended college in Texas, was wanted
on both sides of the border after police, acting on a tip, dug up
15 mutilated bodies at a desolate ranch near the border town of
Matamoros on April 11.
   Cult members boiled brains and other human organs as part of
their belief that human sacrifice would give them occult protection
when they smuggled marijuana into the United States, authorities
have said.
   One body was identified as that of Mark Kilroy, 21, of Santa Fe,
Texas, a student at the University of Texas.
   Ms. Aldrete told reporters at two news conferences earlier this
week that she knew nothing about the killings.
   ``She's giving a lot of data with great detail to investigators
working this case right now,'' Neck said in Brownsville, across the
border from Matamoros.
   Marco Antonio Diaz de Leon, director of judicial proceedings for
the Mexico City attorney general's office, would only say that Ms.
Aldrete ``most certainly is immersed in these crimes.''
   The source in the attorney general's office, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said that when Ms. Aldrete talks to police
about cult rituals she loses that ``charming aspect'' she exhibits
when she faces television cameras.
   ``I would say she has three personalities,'' he said.
   One personality comes out when she faces the cameras and denies
any involvement in the human slayings, another emerges when she
talks to police and ``the third one comes out when she talks to
herself,'' the source said.
   Neck told reporters, ``Sara has kind of lost touch with reality.
No question about it. Her dual personality is coming up pretty
strong right now. When you talk to her without the TV cameras
there, she's pretty truthful.''
   Cult leader Adolfo de Jesus Constanzo, 26, and his right-hand
man, Martin Quintana Rodriguez, were killed on Saturday in a Mexico
City apartment during a shootout with police.
   Ms. Aldrete, Omar Francisco Orea, 23, and Alvaro de Leon Valdez,
22, were charged on Wednesday with homicide in the shootings. They
also were charged with criminal association, resisting arrest,
shooting a firearm at authorities and for injuries suffered in the
gunbattle with police.
   An arraignment date was not announced.
   Constanzo, a Cuban-born American from Florida, reportedly
instructed de Leon Valdez to kill him and Quintana as police moved
in.
   Ms. Aldrete and Orea were charged ``because they had agreed and
made a pact before the deaths in case they were going to be
arrested,'' Diaz de Leon said. ``This death pact was carried out.''

<HEAD>Opposition Groups Reject Party Offer For Round-Table Talks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The country's leading opposition groups
have rejected the ruling Communist Party's offer to negotiate the
details of a transition to a multiparty system, opposition
spokesmen said today.
   The party's governing Central Committee proposed earlier this
week that procedures for next year's promised multiparty elections
and other reforms take place in a round-table setting.
   But the opposition spokesmen said the leaders of eight groups
met Wednesday night and decided they wanted to present their views
as a single entity.
   The Communists have demonstrated increasing willingness to share
power with other political groups following a severe economic
crisis and demand for greater democracy.
   The Central Committee said the negotiations could be conducted
in a setting similar to the series of meetings held recently in
Poland, where the government agreed April 5 to reinstate the
outlawed trade union Solidarity and allow opposition participation
in parliamentary elections.
   Balint Magyar of the League of Free Democrats said the
opposition groups want a two-sided negotiating table and a broader
agenda.
   ``We do not want to negotiate on concrete issues but on the
political rules of the game,'' he said.
   Magyar said the talks would have to include a new law on
political parties and a new constitution as well as the reforms
needed before the June 1990 vote, which is to give voters a choice
of parties for the first time in 40 years.
   According to the daily newspaper Magyar Nemzet and a communique
distributed by the state-run news agency MTI, the opposition groups
called on the Communist leadership to make a new proposal within 48
hours.
   Central Committee secretary Gyoergy Fejti told Hungarian
television he was surprised by the opposition's swift negative
reply.

   Two former TV news managers have been charged
with illegally tapping into phone lines and computers at another
station to gain a news edge over their competitors.
   Former news director Terry Cole and assistant news director
Michael Shapiro at WTSP-TV were charged Wednesday with 17 counts of
computer hacking and conspiracy in the theft of information through
computer phone lines, authorities said. If convicted, each could
face a maximum prison sentence of 85 years.
   Circuit Judge Edward Ward scheduled their arraignments for May
19.
   The two were accused of tapping the phone lines and computers of
WTVT-TV.
   The break-ins began in November but were not noticed until Jan.
12, when WTVT's morning news producer noticed that files were
missing, authorities said. Computer experts determined that an
intruder had rifled the files.
   ``It's no different than digging a tunnel under their office and
coming up and rummaging through their desks,'' said assistant
prosecutor Chris Hoyer. ``It's high-tech burglary.''
   Shapiro knew WTVT's security system thoroughly, including
passwords and identification numbers, because he had helped set it
up while working there as an assignment manager, authorities said.
He was hired away from WTVT in October.
   Vincent Barresi, WTSP's general manager, said Shapiro and Cole
were fired when the station learned of the alleged thefts.
   Shapiro, 33, was arrested Feb. 7. After an investigation
implicated the 32-year-old Cole, he surrendered April 11.
   Hoyer said he was considering a civil lawsuit to seize WTSP's
assets under the state's racketeering laws. He said his decision
would depend on whether WTVT sued its competitor.
   ``They're the victims in this case and we're waiting to see what
they do,'' Hoyer said.
   WTVT's news director, Bob Franklin, said corporate executives
and the station's lawyers were weighing the decision.

<HEAD>Eds: New throughout with Khamenei saying call for Rushdie's death

<BYLINE>By JIM ABRAMS</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Iranian President Ali Khamenei said today Iran
still demands the execution of British author Salman Rushdie for
his novel ``The Satanic Verses,'' which some say insults Islam.
   Khamenei, speaking at a news conference, also denied that Iran's
parliament speaker, Hashemi Rafsanjani, had called for the murder
of Westerners. He said Rafanjani's words were distorted by the
Western media.
   Rafsanjani, previously regarded as a moderate who supported
better ties with the West, is expected to succeed Khamenei when he
finishes his term in office later this year.
   ``The decision made about Salman Rushdie is still valid,''
Khamenei said. ``As I have already said, this is a bullet for which
there is a target. It has been shot. It will one day sooner or
later hit the target.''
   Iran's spiritual leader, the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomenei, in
February said Rushdie must be killed for writing ``The Satanic
Verses,'' which contains passages many Moslems say are insulting to
the Prophet Mohammed.
   Rushdie has been in hiding since the death threat was issued.
   Khamenei, on a six-day visit to China, also said Rafsanjani
``has not recommended anybody kill anybody.''
   The Iranian speaker, he said, was offering an analysis that U.S.
policies toward ``the oppressed people of Palestine would only lead
to such a situation.''
   In a speech Friday, Rafsanjani reportedly called on Palestinians
to kill five American, French or British citizens in retaliation
for each Arab slain in the uprising in the Israeli-occupied
territories.
   He later denied that he supported the killing of Western
civilians.
   Earlier today, Khamenei met with China's senior leader, Deng
Xiaoping, who expressed hope that Iran and Iraq, which have agreed
to a cease-fire after their eight-year war, will live in peace.
   ``All the Third World countries should unite and refrain from
wasting their strength on disputes,'' Deng was quoted by the
official Xinhua News Agency as saying. ``We also hope to see a
stable Middle East.''
   Deng, 84, looking frail and meeting Khamenei for only 20
minutes, noted that China is also working for international
stability.
   Khamenei also has met Communist Party General Secretary Zhao
Ziyang and Premier Li Peng for talks that have included China's
participation in reconstruction of Iran's war-torn economy.
   Khamenei leaves Friday for Xinjiang, China's far-western
province which has a large Moslem minority.

   The Coast Guard seized a Soviet fishing
vessel caught with its nets in the water inside the U.S. 200-mile
fishery limit, authorities say.
   A Coast Guard cutter patrolling near an international fishing
zone in the Bering Sea known as the ``Doughnut Hole'' stopped the
trawler Novoelnya on Tuesday.
   A boarding party found 940 metric tons of pollock on the ship,
Chief Petty Officer Ed Moreth, a Coast Guard spokesman, said
Wednesday.
   The vessel was cited for fishing inside the U.S. zone without a
permit, Moreth said. The Coast Guard said the Novoelnya was four
miles inside the zone.
   The ship was accompanied by two other Soviet trawlers, which
retreated into international waters, Moreth said.
   The vessel was to be taken to Kodiak and turned over to the U.S.
Marshal's office for court proceedings.

<TEXT>
   A judge has dismissed criminal mischief
charges against a man who claims he painted over swastikas scrawled
in his apartment building, but city officials maintain his story is
a lie.
   The city housing authority asked Municipal Judge Joseph N. Falbo
to drop the charges against Jack Stahl on Wednesday. If convicted,
Stahl, 59, could have faced six months in jail and a $1,000 fine.
   Stahl said in March that he painted over swastikas in an
elevator and a hallway in his housing project because the authority
had ignored his seven months of complaints.
   A three-member mayoral commission concluded earlier this week
that it would be hard to prove Stahl intentionally damaged the
building. But the panel said a paint expert and a commission member
found no evidence of swastikas.
   ``The truth in this case is that Mr. Stahl fabricated a story in
order to play upon the people's fears of ethnic hatred to justify
his own actions,'' Mayor Robert Menendez said Wednesday.
   ``Furthermore, Mr. Stahl took advantage of the media's
sensitivity to such divisive issues by using the swastika _ one of
humanity's most horrible symbols of vicious hate and violent crimes
_ as a shield to protect himself from further prosecution.''
   Stahl does not have a telephone and could not be reached for
comment.

   O. Edmund Clubb, a Foreign Service officer whose
prescient analysis of Communist strength in pre-revolutionary China
led to charges of disloyalty during the McCarthy era, died Tuesday
of Parkinson's disease. He was 88.
   Clubb served more than two decades in the Foreign Service and
was the last American diplomat stationed in Beijing after the
Communist takeover in 1949.
   In 1950, he returned to Washington and was named chief of the
China desk at the State Department but was suspended a year later
as a security risk.
   Clubb was condemned by a loyalty board but was cleared on
appeal. He was then assigned to an obscure State Department job and
later resigned.
   In 1932, Clubb reported from China that the Communists were
popular in the regions they controlled and that the U.S.-supported
Chinese Nationalists were corrupt but that they might force the
Communists to flee to the west.
   His prediction foreshadowed the Long March and was later cited
as evidence he had pro-Communist leanings.
   After his government career, he became a writer and lecturer at
several universities, settling at Columbia University.

   Former President Jimmy Carter has videotaped a
program in Spanish to give Latins in the United States and in nine
Latin American countries his view that the election in Panama was
rigged.
   In the program taped Wednesday, Carter, who observed the
elections as part of a team that included former President Ford,
urged Panamamian leader Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega to acknowledge
the fraud.
   ``I have personally witnessed these criminal acts,'' Carter said
on Cable News Network's Noticiero Telemundo news program.
   ``It is very important that the world and particularly the
leaders of Western democracies denounce these results and condemn
General Noriega.''
   Carter in 1978 signed the agreement with the late Gen. Omar
Torrijos under which Panama will take control of the Panama Canal
in 1999.
   The Electoral Tribunal in Panama annulled Sunday's presidential
election after paramilitary forces beat the opposition candidates
and attacked protesters who said the government had rigged the
balloting.
   Noticiero Telemundo is shown on 20 Spanish-language stations in
the United States and is distributed to nine Latin American
countries, said CNN spokesman Steve Haworth.
   Those countries in the past included Panama, but Haworth said
that country is not allowing CNN reports to be aired.

<HEAD>Teachers Vote To End Strike, Return To Classroom</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN WRIGHT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Striking teachers voted by a wide margin to
return to the classroom and end a walkout that has kept 10 million
students out of school, a union official said.
   The vote ended a 3-week-old strike by a dissident faction of the
pro-government teachers union to demand higher wages and protest
alleged union corruption.
   An agreement between the union and the striking faction ``was
approved overwhelmingly'' by the dissident teachers Wednesday
night, said the union official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity. He did not give the vote.
   The National Education Workers' Union and the dissident
Democratic Coordinate agreed to accept a government offer of a 25
percent increase in wages and benefits and to adopt anti-corruption
measures.
   The federal Education Department also said it would replace the
superintendents in all 14 of the nation's districts. It said the
move was designed to increase efficiency, but it gave no details.
   The Democratic Coordinate claims the loyalty of about half the
union's 1.1 million members, and the strike closed roughly half of
the nation's grammar and high schools and vocational institutes.
   The government had threatened unspecified punitive measures
against the striking teachers, but the union official said that all
teachers who return to work will suffer no consequences.
   The Excelsior news service reported that schools would reopen
nationwide by next Tuesday. Schools in some parts of Mexico
reported that they were ready to open today.
   The Democratic Coordinate struck April 17 to demand union
democracy and a 100 percent increase in pay.
   The teachers, whose take-home pay averages $147 a month,
rejected the government's initial offer of a 15 percent increase.
   The strike also led to the ouster of the union's chief, Carlos
Jonguitud Barrios, an old-style machine politician close to the
governing Institutional Revolutionary Party. Jonguitud and a group
of associates had controlled the union for 17 years.
   Union dissidents accused Jonguitud of mismanaging union funds
and keeping his group in power by rigging union elections.
   Jonguitud's replacement, Elba Esther Gordillo, removed a major
obstacle to reviving negotiations. Coordinate leader Teodoro
Palomino refused to talk with Jonguitud but said he was willing to
deal with Ms. Gordillo.

<TEXT>
   Arab League envoys today declared a new
truce in a 2-month-old bloodbath in Lebanon after rocket and
artillery duels between Christian and Syrian gunners killed 20
people and wounded 62.
   Gen. Michel Aoun, who commands 20,000 Christian soldiers
fighting an alliance of Syrian and Druse Moslem forces, ordered his
gunners to abide by the cease-fire, a spokesman said.
   There was no immediate public reaction from his foes, but the
Voice of Lebanon radio station, in Christian east Beirut, and the
Moslem Voice of the Nation, the most popular broadcast in west
Beirut, quoted ``reliable sources'' as saying the Arab mediators
conveyed the cease-fire order to both sides.
   It was the fifth cease-fire called by the Arab League in the
current round of fighting, the most desructive of Lebanon's
14-year-old civil war. All others have collapsed.
   Thursday's casualties raised the overall toll to 357 people
killed and 1,385 wounded since the fighting broke out March 8, by
police count.
   The Arab emissaries, led by Lakhdar Ibrahimi, an Algerian
diplomat, braved shellfire and drove across the dividing Green Line
to east Beirut for a meeting with Aoun at the bomb-scarred
presidential palace in the Christian suburb of Baabda.
   Aoun's spokesman, who refused to be further identified, said:
``All roads to the palace were under Syrian shelling. A howitzer
shell exploded very close to the palace as the Arab delegates were
at the entrance. No one was hurt.''
   The mediators met earlier in west Beirut with acting Prime
Minister Salim Hoss, who heads the Moslem Cabinet in Lebanon's dual
government.
   Ibrahimi told reporters after meeting with Hoss that they were
seeking to ``normalize the situation in Lebanon to allow the
committee to pursue its efforts,'' a reference to a six-member Arab
League panel entrusted with finding a settlement of the civil war.
   Aoun's spokesman said Syrian gunners fired ``126 shells, most of
them 240mm mortars, into the palace before the Arab envoys'
arrival.''
   Aoun, 53, a Maronite Catholic, had been staying in the bomb
shelter of the palace with his wife and three daughters.
   The Arab envoys arrived in Beirut on Wednesday after meetings in
Damascus with Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk Sharaa and in the east
Lebanon city of Baalbek with Lebanese Parliament Speaker Hussein
Husseini, a Shiite Moslem.
   Ibrahimi said the meetings Wednesday were ``the first step'' of
the new mission.
   Hoss and Aoun, who heads a Christian military Cabinet, agreed to
a three-point plan declared by the Arab League on April 28.
   It called for a cease-fire, lifting blockades of sea and air
ports and the deployment of 321-man observer team drawn from six
Arab countries.
   But Syrian and Druse gunners kept on shelling the
310-square-mile Christian enclave, claiming they wanted to prevent
three ships from unloading Iraqi weapons for Aoun. The truce
collapsed over the weekend when Christian forces began returning
fire.
   Syria and Iraq have long been enemies and now are competing for
influence in Lebanon.
   Iraq backs Aoun, who has pledged to fight until Syria's 40,000
soldiers, based in Moslem regions of the country under a 1976 Arab
League peacekeeping mandate, are withdrawn.
   The latest confrontation broke out two days after Aoun ordered a
blockade of illegal ports run by the Moslem militias. The militias
deprive the state treasury of about $100 million annually in lost
customs dues.

<HEAD>Sailor Recalls Accidental Loss Of H-bomb</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When a Navy jet carrying a hydrogen bomb rolled
off an aircraft carrier into the Pacific Ocean, William Lane feared
he and others aboard the Ticonderoga were moments away from death.
   ``They were very nervous minutes,'' Lane said, recalling the
long-suppressed accident, which happened in 1965 about 80 miles off
a Japanese island and 200 miles from Okinawa. The bomb mounted
under the A-4 Skyhawk jet was lost in 16,000 feet of water.
   ``At the time, my feelings were that if that atomic bomb goes
off, this is all going to be vapor _ we're just going to disappear
off the face of the Earth,'' he said in an interview in Wednesday's
The (San Diego) Tribune.
   The pilot and plane also were lost despite the desperate efforts
of sailors who clawed at the single-seat attack jet to try to keep
it from rolling off the deck.
   ``The word was passed that they would appreciate it _ they
didn't say don't or anything else _ if you didn't mention it in
your letters home and just kind of kept it quiet,'' Lane said. ``In
those days, you more or less did everything you were told. There
was a great deal of patriotism on that ship.''
   The Pentagon confirmed the accident earlier this week, and
government officials have told Japan they don't know of any danger
posed by the one-megaton H-bomb, which they said had not been armed.
   Lane, a resident of Santee in San Diego County, was a
20-year-old bomb handler on the Ticonderoga at the time.
   The carrier was on a break from war duty and holding a
nuclear-weapons loading exercise, he said. Lane said the pilot had
climbed into the cockpit when the carrier listed, sending the jet
rolling backward.
   ``We saw (the pilot) look at the handlers as if to say, `There
are no brakes,' or, `I can't reach them,' or something like that,''
Lane said.
   When the plane hit the water, the bomb separated from the
fuselage, Lane said. ``(It) was bobbing around with smoke coming
out of it _ probably from the batteries,'' before it sank, he said.
   The Ticonderoga on which Lane served was decommissioned in 1973.
Another ship now carries the name.

   Burmese guerrillas killed at least 40
government troops while defending a rebel camp along the Thai
border, rebel sources said today.
   The Karen rebel sources and students fighting alongside them
said at least 45 other soldiers were wounded in Wednesday's
fighting at Wan Kha. Two guerrillas were killed and 12 wounded,
they claimed.
   Wan Kha is in Burma across the border from the northern Thai
province of Tak.
   The Karens are among a dozen ethnic-based rebel groups fighting
for more autonomy from Burma's government. The government has
intensified its offensive in recent months and seized several major
Karen bases along the Thai border.
   Thai border police today also reported fighting at Yahjaw and
Chikaya in Burma's Mae Ramat district, near the border.
   The police said about 750 Karens have fled the fighting into the
Mae Ramat district of Tak province.
   On Tuesday, police said, Burmese troops crossed into Thailand
and looted shops of rice, cooking oil and clothes.
   In a statement dated May 9 and received in Bangkok today, Sen.
Patrick Moynihan, a Democrat from New York, condemned the Burmese
government and called for international mediation to end the
fighting.
   ``We have been heartened by the news that the Cambodian civil
war might soon be resolved, but not 300 miles from the battlefields
of Cambodia an equally bloody civil war is being fought in tragic
obscurity,'' the statement said.
   ``In Burma, a brutal military government which has been
condemned by the international community is escalating its war with
the armed Burmese opposition,'' it said.
   ``The war needs mediation. The opposition desires it. Someone,
the United States, the United Nations, or ASEAN (the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations) should be able to provide it,'' the
statement said.
   Moynihan accused the Burmese army of attacking rebel positions
where thousands of students fled after last year's military coup.
   Students were at the forefront of last year's nationwide
campaign for democracy. The army crushed the campaign after the
Sept. 18 coup.

   The leader of Mississippi's Christian
Knights of the Ku Klux Klan has been deposed because he was born a
Jew, KKK officials said.
   ``I just felt it was best to get a new grand dragon for
Mississippi,'' said Virgil Griffin of Mount Holly, N.C., national
head of the Christian Knights of the KKK.
   The removal of Jordan Gollub ``mostly concerned his Jewish
background,'' Griffin said. Griffin would not discuss his views on
Jews, but Klan organizations have historically despised Jews,
blacks and Catholics.
   Gollub, born in Philadelphia, Pa., to Jewish parents and reared
in a suburb there, said Wednesday he now considers himself a
Christian. He lives in Poplarville.
   He said Griffin dislikes his background ``and the fact that I'm
against Catholics joining the Klan.''
   Gollub said he will form his own Klan organization.
   ``I find it ironic that the leader of the Klan was a Jew,
obviously a self-hating Jew,'' said Eric Gurvis, rabbi at Beth
Israel Congregation in Jackson.
   Gollub's removal as grand dragon ``points out the senseless
hatred that seems to be a part of the Klan. I can't say it's
unexpected.''

<TEXT>
   Authorities arrested a Communist
rebel in connection with the killing last month of an American
colonel, the military said today.
   Col. Ramsey Ocampo, provincial commander on the Bataan
peninsula, said Ricardo Prestosa, 29, was arrested Wednesday at his
home in Dinalupihan, about 40 miles west of Manila.
   No charges have been filed, Ocampo said.
   Manila newspapers quoted military sources as saying Prestosa was
one of two rebels sought in the April 21 slaying of Col. James
``Nick'' Rowe.
   Communist rebels claimed responsibility for the slaying, citing
U.S. ``interference'' in the government's counterinsurgency
campaign.
   Rowe, 51, of McAllen, Texas, was a Vietnam War hero whose book,
``Five Years to Freedom,'' detailed his five years of imprisonment
by the Viet Cong and his escape.
   Rowe was gunned down on his way to work in Quezon City at the
Joint U.S. Military Assistance Group, which provides training and
logistical support to the Philippine military.
   Ocampo said Prestosa denied involvement in the killing and
claimed he was working elsewhere at the time.
   Ocampo said intelligence officers do not believe Prestosa was
directly involved in the attack on Rowe but is ``in the know''
about details of the killing.
   He added that Prestosa is a political officer of the banned
Communist Party of the Philippines. Communist rebels have been
fighting to overthrow the government since 1969.
   Prestosa was arrested in 1983, but subversion charges against
him were dropped. He was arrested again last December but was
released without charge.

<TEXT>
   Only three of the 16 flight attendants aboard
United Flight 811, whose side ripped open Feb. 24 and pulled nine
passengers to their deaths, have regained their composure enough to
return to work.
   Most of the attendants who worked to protect the remaining 327
passengers in the howling horror of the plane's darkened cabin have
not been able to return to work either because of physically or
psychologically problems, according to their supervisor.
   The Boeing 747 landed safely in Honolulu after aborting a flight
to New Zealand.
   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner gave the plane's pilots
and other crew members the Secretary's Heroism Award in ceremonies
Wednesday, saying the flight attendants overcame ``the deafening,
hurricane-like winds that swept through the cabin'' as they helped
passengers deal with the crisis over the Pacific.
   Skinner said that despite increased concern, air travel remains
one of the safest forms of transportation. He blamed news headlines
for sometimes creating the impression that aviation is unsafe.
   But several flight attendants interviewed after the ceremonies
were critical of the state of aviation safety and accused United
Airlines of cutting back in training and safety equipment.
   The company denied the criticism, saying it meets or exceeds all
Federal Aviation Administration regulations and industry standards.
   The National Transportation Safety Board is continuing its
investigation into the incident following a hearing in Seattle last
month. Investigators have focused on a possible malfunction in the
locking mechanism of the cargo door that blew off with a large
section of the fuselage.
   Skinner handed out awards to Capt. David Cronin of Incline
Village, Nev.; 1st Officer Gregory Slader of Langley, Wash.; 2nd
Officer Randal Thomas of Albany, Ind.; and 13 flight attendants.
   In a separate meeting, the Airline Pilots Association gave
Superior Airmanship Awards to the pilot and copilots.
   Three other flight attendants did not attend the program but
were to receive their awards later. Joani Zumbrunnen, manager of
United flight attendants in Honolulu, said they were still
recovering from the effects of the incident.
   She said at least one has refused to fly at all and ``may never
fly again'' because of the experience.
   Edward Lythgoe of Kailua-Kona, Hawaii, who suffered two broken
ribs in the incident, said he returned to work only last week and
still reacts with newfound anxiety whenever a plane gets into
turbulence and during landing and takeoff.
   Flight Attendant Darrell Blankenship of Seattle, who accepted
the award with his arm still in a cast, said a flying liquor cart
jammed into him during the flight.
   Blankenship and Lythgoe both said passengers and some flight
attendants had difficulty putting on life vests, which Lythgoe said
he thought were badly designed.
   Sharol Perkins of Honolulu said not enough oxygen bottles or
enough megaphones, needed to communicate with passengers above the
roar caused by the hole, were readily available to flight
attendants.
   Sarah Shanahan of Kailua, Hawaii, said she does not want to
return to work until United improves its training for emergencies.
   She said the airline has ``watered down'' safety procedures and
training over the years.
   Ms. Shanahan, who has been flying for 22 years, said attendants
used to have to undergo three days of retraining each year,
including an open-book test, but now have only an eight-hour
session.
   ``It makes it more difficult because you have to fly by the seat
of your pants,'' she said. ``The corporation doesn't seem to think
safety is cost-effective.''
   United spokeswoman Sara Dornacker in Chicago said the airline's
No. 1 priority is safety.
   ``Safety is good business,'' she said, noting that although the
747 is required to carry only nine flight attendants, Flight 811
had 15, in addition to one who was flying as a passenger but joined
in helping with the emergency and also received an award.
   She said the airline's training for flight attendants exceeds
industry standards, including eight hours of classroom work, four
hours of home study and added security training each year.
   ``The quality of our training has never deteriorated and, in
fact, we have enhanced it to improve proficiency over the years,''
she said.
   Ms. Dornacker said safety equipment aboard United planes either
meets or exceeds FAA specifications, providing more supplies of
emergency oxygen than required.
   She acknowledged, however, that some passengers have complained
of difficulty in putting on life vests. She said there has been no
report that any passenger on Flight 811 was unable to don a vest.
   Other flight attendants from Hawaii receiving the secretary's
award included Laura Brentlinger, Tina Blundy, Jean Nakayama, Ilona
Benoit and Ricky Umehira, all of Honolulu, and Robyn Nakamoto of
Aiea.
   Skinner also gave awards to Linda Shirley and Curtis Christensen
of San Francisco and Leonard Jenkins of Denver, who was flying as a
passenger but joined the crew after the door blew off. Awards were
to be sent to those not attending from Hawaii _ John Horita of
Hilo, Mae Sapolu of Honolulu and Richard Lam of Haleiwa.

   County judges have enacted a policy
requiring drug offenders to name their suppliers or face additional
time in jail for contempt.
   Some defense attorneys say the measure is unconstitutional.
   ``Forced and coerced information is suspect, unreliable and
potentially dangerous. It raises serious constitutional
questions,'' said Herb Moncier.
   The policy violates the Fifth Amendment right against
self-incrimination ``because it could indirectly be used to produce
additional charges against the defendant,'' said Bob Ritchie,
another defense attorney.
   Knox County's three Criminal Court judges adopted the measure
Friday at the suggestion of Scott Dean, chairman of the area's
Metropolitan Drug Commission.
   At least one judge said he would use the policy immediately. In
addition, a Juvenile Court judge agreed to use the policy, Dean
said.
   The policy is modeled after one in Columbus, Neb., which is used
with juvenile offenders, he said.
   Under the program, people convicted of drug offenses can be
jailed for contempt of court for not naming their suppliers.
   Anyone who wants to plead guilty in exchange for a lesser
sentence will be told of the policy. If the defendant refuses to
name the supplier, the judge may reject the plea agreement, said
Criminal Court Judge Randy Nichols.

   A former judge from Colombia who fled
her homeland because of death threats has left Michigan after her
identity was revealed, her lawyer says.
   Cyril Weiner said Wednesday that Consuelo Sanchez-Duran and her
husband left after a Detroit newspaper reported she had been
relocated to the area by the U.S. government because a drug lord
had put a $1 million bounty on her.
   ``The individuals in charge of security felt her life was in
jeopardy in this area,'' Weiner said. The lawyer said the bounty
was an unconfirmed rumor but that criminals in the Detroit area may
be tempted by it.
   Sanchez signed an arrest warrant in Colombia for Pablo Escobar
Gaviria, alleged leader of the Medellin cocaine cartel. She and her
husband fled the South American country after receiving death
threats.
   The Detroit News reported in February that Sanchez was living
and working in the area. The News has said the couple's neighbors
had the right to know.
   Later, the Detroit Free Press gave the name of her apartment
complex and said she was working under her own name as Colombia's
consul general in this Detroit suburb.
   The judge sued the News last month, accusing the paper of
endangering her life.

   Israeli troops killed a 17-year-old Palestinian
and wounded three others today, Arab reports said. The army
confined 700,000 Palestinians to their homes in the Gaza Strip for
a fourth day.
   The teen-ager was reported killed in a stone-throwing clash that
erupted as Palestinians staged a general strike in the occupied
West Bank and Gaza Strip in memory of their brethren killed in the
17-month-old rebellion against Israeli rule. At least 470
Palestinians and 21 Israelis have died in the uprising.
   Yediot Ahronot, a daily newspaper, reported that Transport
Minister Moshe Katsav of the right-wing Likud bloc plans to urge
that troops seal off the occupied territories for three months and
quash the uprising.
   A more conciliatory approach came from former Israeli President
Efraim Katzir, who today suggested not ruling out peace talks with
the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   ``I wouldn't hasten to do it,'' Katzir told Israel radio in
discussing President Yitzhak Shamir's proposals to hold elections
in the occupied territories and negotiate a peace settlement with
victors. ``Only if it (the election plan) fails, other paths shourvision
of the
balloting.
   Israeli leaders reportedly have been unable to come up with a
complete formula for the balloting.
   Among other problems, Shamir opposes participation of the
140,000 Palestinians of east Jerusalem in elections, said his
spokesman, Yossi Ahimeir.
   Finance Minister Shimon Peres and Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin
of Labor want east Jerusalemites to join the balloting to make the
election plan more appealing to Palestinians, said a government
official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Shamir presided over state affairs today from Jerusalem's
Hadassah Medical Center, where he underwent a battery of tests,
doctors said.
   Presidential spokesman Avi Pazner said the 73-year-old Likud
leader had complained of ``weariness and weakness,'' but he refused
to be precise about his condition. Doctors said Shamir would be
released Friday.
   In the Gaza Strip, violence persisted despite a 4-day-old
curfew. Sixty-year-old Farhana Hassan Kawarea was struck in the
head by a bullet in a clash with soldiers in Khan Yunis, Arab
hospital officials said. She was reported in moderate condition.
   In the West Bank town of Hebron, soldiers fired at rock-throwing
youths, fatally shooting Salmi Ibrahim Abu Kaff, 17, in the chest,
hospital officials said.
   Two Palestinians were reported wounded in the Gaza Strip refugee
camp of Nuseirat and the West Bank village of Beita.
   The army said it was checking casualty reports.
   A spokesman also announced that troops captured a group of
Palestinians suspected of making homemade guns to shoot at
soldiers. They were arrested at the West Bank refugee camp of
Dheishe.
   The military said they were alerted when a group member suffered
a fatal gunshot wound April 15 when a makeshift pistol went off.
The spokesman said that at the time, Palestinians claimed soldiers
shot the man.
   In southern Israel today, several dozen angry Israelis staged a
protest on a main highway north of the Gaza Strip over the alleged
kidnapping and killing of soldiers by Palestinians.
   Earlier this week, soldiers discovered the body of one soldier
in the area and a search continued for another soldier missing for
eight days. Authorities alleged the soldiers were kidnapped by
Palestinians.

   Swirling wind deflated and damaged a
mammoth, $18 million radar balloon used to detect drug smuggling
across the Mexican border, but the Customs Service says radar
coverage continues.
   The Aerostat was damaged Wednesday while moored at the Fort
Huachuca Army base, said Customs spokesman Charles Conroy. A dust
devil, or mini tornado, struck the helium balloon, which has
sophisticated look-down radar, he said.
   The 6{-ton balloon crashed to the ground. No one was injured and
there was no damage to other property.
   The extent of damage to the balloon was not immediately known,
but Conroy said, ``Certainly it can function again. I'm pretty sure
of that.''
   A second Aerostat is at Deming, N.M., with another scheduled to
go into operation at Yuma in Arizona next month. The Customs
Service plans six over the Southwest and four over the Caribbean.
   Partial overlapping coverage provided by the Aerostat in Deming
plus radar at military installations, air traffic control sites and
Customs ground and airborne stations will help make up for the
downed balloon, Conroy said.
   The Aerostat, deployed in June, is 245 feet long and 72 feet in
diameter with a hull of high-tech, highly resistant, thin materials.
   The Aerostat was moored close to the ground because of strong
wind before the accident, Conroy said, and there was speculation
debris in the dust devil damaged the balloon.

<TEXT>
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev is coming
to make history. The Chinese, ever wary of their northern neighbor,
are determined that history will not be repeated.
   Expectations differ as Gorbachev and China's senior leader, Deng
Xiaoping, meet for the first Chinese-Soviet summit since Mao gave
Nikita Khrushchev the cold shoulder in Beijing in 1959.
   Both sides agree that the May 15-18 summit will normalize
political and party relations strained three decades ago when
Beijing challenged Moscow's right to dominate the world Communist
movement.
   Both desire an easing of tensions so they can concentrate on
their sputtering efforts to reform plodding, state-controlled
economies. ``Abnormal relations'' along their 4,300- mile border
``are not in the interest of the people of the two countries,''
Chinese Premier Li Peng recently said.
   The summit will give impetus to growing trade relations,
particularly across border outposts, and to joint efforts in the
development of Siberia and northeast China.
   It will mean more official contacts. The Soviet Union will be
able to better study China's pioneer efforts in market-oriented
reforms. China, now challenged by a pro-democracy student movement,
will get a better look at the bold political reforms Gorbachev has
initiated.
   There will be more consultations on Korea, where both support
the Communist north, and on Cambodia, where Soviet-backed Vietnam
is battling Chinese-backed guerrillas.
   Students who have demonstrated for democratic reforms also plan
to take advantage of Gorbachev's visit. Leaders of the movement
today announced they would have a separate ``welcoming ceremony''
for Gorbachev and invite him to speak on political reform in his
country.
   ``We have not ruled out a demonstration to express our support
for political reform,'' said one activist, who has helped lead
seven marches since mid-April for democracy and a free press.
   The Chinese have been decidedly cool to the idea that the summit
is another triumph for Gorbachev's policies of international
detente.
   It remains to be seen, one Chinese scholar wrote in the official
Beijing Review, ``whether the Soviet Union can thoroughly correct
its deep-rooted big-nation chauvinism and hegemonism under the
guidance of Gorbachev's new thinking.''
   The Chinese say normalization of relations is important, but so
is winning concessions from the Soviets, especially on Cambodia.
   Chinese leaders insist that improved relations will not mean a
return to the alliance of the 1950s, when Mao Tse-tung's fledgling
Communist government was forced to bow to Moscow's ideological
dictums.
   Mao's disputes with Josef Stalin, and then with Khrushchev, led
to an irrevocable split in 1960 when the Kremlin withdrew all its
technicians from Chinese factories built with Soviet aid.
   Soviet ``revisionism'' was reviled by the ultra-leftists of
China's 1966-76 Cultural Revolution. After border clashes broke out
in 1969, Mao asked the nation to prepare for all-out war.
   War was averted, but prospects for better relations after the
Cultural Revolution were quashed by Vietnam's invasion of Cambodia
in late 1978 and by Soviet military intervention in Afghanistan at
the end of 1979.
   Political normalization talks were started in 1982, but went
nowhere because of what China calls the ``three obstacles'' _
Afghanistan, Cambodia and Soviet troops on the Chinese border.
   Gorbachev has pushed hard for the summit. He finally started
getting a positive response from the Chinese last year after
announcing the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan, reducing Soviet
troops on the border and agreeing to help get Vietnam out of
Cambodia.
   But as Foreign Minister Qian Qichen recently stressed, there is
still ``some way to go and some efforts to be made'' before the
obstacles are eliminated.
   Deng, 84 and semi-retired, apparently agreed to the summit
because he wanted to cap his career with a diplomatic tour de force
equal to his restoring diplomatic ties with the United States in
1979 and the 1984 agreement with Britain on returning Hong Kong to
China.
   The Chinese insist, however, that hard bargaining on Cambodia
will take place at the summit. Already clashes reportedly have
occurred over the joint communique to be issued at the end of the
visit.
   The Soviets want to lay down general principles on future
relations. The Chinese are demanding Soviet commitments on Cambodia.
   Gorbachev is expected to meet Deng, Premier Li and Communist
Party General Secretary Zhao Ziyang on Tuesday, and he will meet
representatives of Chinese society and visit Shanghai before
leaving May 18.

   House Speaker Jim Wright's top assistant
resigned today, a week after a newspaper published the story of a
woman whom he had beaten and left for dead 16 years ago.
   ``I wish I could rewrite the past, but unfortunately I can't,''
said John P. Mack, who had the title of executive director of the
Democratic Steering and Policy Committee and served as Wright's
chief legislative strategist.
   Wright, who is in the midst of defending himself against charges
of unethical behavior in his personal finances, accepted Mack's
resignation ``with sadness and regret.'' In a statement, the
speaker said he never regretted giving ``this young man another
chance.''
   In 1973, when he was 19, Mack was the manager of an imported
household furnishings store in a Washington suburb when he attacked
a female customer with a hammer, stabbed and slashed her with a
steak knife, and left her for dead in the back seat of her car.
   Doctors said it was a miracle the woman recovered.
   Mack was convicted of malicious wounding and served 27 months of
a 15 year sentence. Mack was Wright's daughter's brother-in-law at
the time, and the speaker offered him a clerk's job upon his
release.
   Mack rose to become Wright's closest aide, as the Texas
congressman himself climbed the House ranks to become speaker in
1987.
   Although Mack's record was known to many on Capitol Hill, and
several articles had been written in recent years about the case,
the story caused a great stir last week. The story about Mack came
in the midst of Wright's own battle against charges that he has
repeatedly violated House ethics rules.
   The Washington Post printed the victim's story with prominent
display in its Style section. Pamela Small recounted the gruesome
ordeal in great detail and said Mack had never apologized for the
crime.
   In his statement of resignation, released by Wright's office
today, Mack said he was ``and will always be full of remorse.
   ``To Pamela Small, and also to my family, all I can say now is
what I have said many times before and to myself every day since
this happened. And that is I am sorry. Truly sorry.''
   Mack said he had considered leaving the speaker's office and his
$89,500-a-year job since last December. ``But now it's time to
leave,'' he said.
   Wright, in his statement, said he had hired Mack as a mail clerk
on the recommendation of law enforcement officials and of his
daughter, who had known Mack in high school. ``I was told he had
served some 27 months upon conviction of a crime, but was not told
the details of the crime,'' Wright said.
   ``My heart goes out to the young woman who was the victim of
that crime so many years ago, and I wish there were something I
might do to be of benefit to her,'' he said.
   Mark Johnson, Wright's press secretary, said Mack told Wright of
his decision late Wednesday.
   ``John just decided that he did not want to become an issue,''
said Johnson.

<HEAD>Presidency Member Criticizes Detentions of 200 Ethnic Albanians</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Yugoslav official denounced the
detentions of more than 200 ethnic Albanians who he says were
jailed without charge in the troubled province of Kosovo, a
Belgrade newspaper reported today.
   The daily Borba quoted Josip Vrhovec, Croatia's representative
on the collective nine-man state presidency, as cautioning that
holding citizens without charge is legal only ``in certain
difficult situations.''
   Kosovo is a province in Serbia that has been plagued by violence
involving the ethnic Albanian majority and the Slav minority. The
province has been under a state of emergency since March riots that
killed at least 25 people.
   Vrhovec's statement, to parliamentary deputies in Croatia,
criticized the police action. However, as a member of the
presidency, he has played a role in the crackdown.
   ``The isolation in Kosovo represents the most flagrant, the most
radical form of limiting human rights,'' Vrhovec said, according to
Borba. The newspaper is considered among the most liberal of
Yugoslavia's state-controlled media.
   Police reports say 60,000 ethnic Albanians rioted to protest
constitutional changes giving Serbia more control to police Kosovo,
where 85 percent of the 1.8 million inhabitants are ethnic
Albanians. Previously, the province enjoyed virtual self-rule
within the federation.
   Serbian authorities claim the amendments were needed to prevent
alleged harassment of Slavs by ethnic Albanians.
   Opponents of Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic accuse him of
distorting the ethnic situation to exert control over Kosovo and
elevate himself among Serbs, Yugoslavia's largest ethnic group.
   About 800 protesters have been jailed following the March
violence, most receiving 60-day prison sentences.
   Among those awaiting trial are Albanian politicians, businessmen
and other community leaders accused of instigating the troubles.
   A commentary in the current issue of Danas, the country's
largest-selling news magazine, said detainees are not allowed to
receive visits by lawyers or family members and are denied books
and newspapers.
   Meanwhile, Kosovo authorities have demanded an unspecified
number of ethnic Albanian regional deputies be ousted for opposing
the constitutional changes and voting against official
Serbian-backed candidates for the regional presidency.
   ``It is unacceptable to have in Kosovo's assembly a certain
number of deputies whose behavior and statements are contrary to
the policies of the Communist Party,'' the magazine quoting Daut
Jasanica, a high-ranking provincial official, as saying.
   In the liberal northern republic of Slovenia, meanwhile,
thousands of students boycotted classes today to protest the
jailing of a journalist accused of revealing military secrets.
   About half of Ljubljana University's 17,000 students protested,
student union member Sereja Sorli said in a telephone interview.
   Janez Jansa, editor of the liberal Mladina youth weekly, two
other journalists and an army soldier were sentenced by a Ljubljana
military court to prison terms of 10 months to four years for theft
and possession of a classified army document.

   Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita met senior
statesman Masayoshi Ito today but failed to persuade the
reform-minded politician to succeed him when he steps down over an
influence-peddling scandal, sources said.
   Local news reports said Takeshita and Ito, a former foreign
minister, are at odds over Ito's call for an end to party factions.
Ito, in naming his terms for leading the scandal-tainted party and
becoming Japan's next prime minister, also has demanded the
resignations of all party officials connected to corruption cases.
   After meeting more than three hours today, the two Liberal
Democratic Party leaders said their discussions focused on reform
of the party, whose popular support has been deeply eroded by the
so-called Recruit scandal.
   ``My feeling has not changed,'' Ito said. ``I believe Mr.
Takeshita hasn't got a good impression'' of the conditions under
which he would accept the country's top post.
   Though Takeshita was expected to ask Ito to accept the party
presidency, he told reporters after the meeting: ``We entered
today's talks after confirming between each other that I'm not in a
position to make any request today.''
   Takeshita leads the largest of six major factions that make up
the Liberal Democratic Party. Balancing factional strength is an
important factor in determining appointments to the Cabinet and has
become a widely accepted feature of the ruling party organization.
Political fundraising _ a key issue in the current scandal _ is a
major part of factional competition.
   The discredited prime minister has admitted receiving more than
$1 million in donations from the information conglomerate Recruit
Co. and announced April 25 he will resign to take responsibility
for the loss of public trust.
   ``Revolutionary changes in the party's way of thinking are
needed,'' Itotold reporters Tuesday.
   Ito, 75 and diabetic, has rejected a series of informal offers
to replace Takeshita, citing his age and poor health. But party
leaders appear ready to negotiate with him because he is one of a
handful of senior politicians untainted by the scandal, which also
involved insider trading.
   Three of Takeshita's Cabinet ministers have resigned and 14
businessmen and ex-bureaucrats have been arrested for bribery or
other charges related to the affair.

   A scientist claims to produce nuclear
fusion in a jar at room temperature. But few believe him, and his
application for a patent is rejected.
   The story may sound familiar, but it happened in Sweden in 1927,
more than a half-century before two researchers stunned the
scientific world with a similar experiment in the United States.
   John Tandberg's experiments ``seemingly were very similiar to
the ones performed in Utah,'' said Bertil Wilner of the fusion
research department at the Royal Institute of Technology.
   ``It's amazing that his findings have been completely forgotten
for 60 years,'' said Wilner, whose father worked on the project and
kept notes.
   Tandberg began looking into cold fusion in 1927 when the
33-year-old chief scientist for the Electrolux Co. became intrigued
with fusion experiments being conducted in Germany, Wilner said.
   Two Berlin researchers who were trying to produce helium for
airships said they fused hydrogen into helium using a palladium
catalyst. But later they discovered errors that forced them to
retract their claim of fusion.
   ``The German scientists weren't interested in producing energy,
since the world's energy sources seemed inexhaustable at the
time,'' Wilner said.
   ``But Tandberg immediately realized the energy aspect of the
experiment and its potential importance,'' Wilner said in an
interview.
   The National Patent and Registration Office refused to accept
Tandberg's application to record his experiment. ``Their experts
claimed it was impossible to release nuclear energy through cold
fusion,'' Wilner said.
   Soon afterward, Tandberg ended his fusion research and dedicated
himself to other fields. He later left Electrolux, still one of the
world's largest makers of home appliances, and became a professor
at Stockholm University.
   In March, B. Stanley Pons, chairman of the University of Utah's
chemistry department, and Martin Fleischmann of the University of
Southampton, England, announced they achieved cold fusion that
produced up to 50 times the amount of energy they put into their
experiment.
   Their findings were met with incredulity.
   The latest scientist seeking to explain away their claims, Nobel
laureate Dr. Linus Pauling, suggested chemical reactions, not
fusion, could have produced the heat.
   Pauling, 88, of the Linus Pauling Institute of Science and
Medicine at Palo Alto, Calif., said in a letter published today in
the British science magazine Nature that the palladium would have
combined with deuterium heavy water to form palladium deuteride,
which is unstable.
   ``After the beginning of electrolysis, this unstable deuteride
may begin to decompose either slowly, resulting in an increased
liberation of heat, or explosively, as Fleischmann and Pons
observed,'' wrote Pauling, who won the Nobel prize for chemistry in
1954.
   But, if they are right, it could open the way to a cheap,
inexhaustible way to create energy in the same way that the sun and
stars produce heat and light. Fusion derives its energy from
forcing atoms of deuterium or hydrogen together. The reaction
produces an atom of helium, a burst of energy and a neutron.
   The work of Pons and Fleischmann ``bears a strong resemblance to
the way Tandberg carried out his experiments, according to my
father's notes,'' Wilner said. Wilner's father wrote a book on
Tandberg describing the experiment.
   ``The book was never translated and was forgotten a long time
ago,'' he said, which helped explain why the work stirred so little
interest among contemporary scientists. Tandberg, who died in 1968,
apparently never withdrew his claim of having produced cold fusion.
   Like Pons and Fleishmann, Tandberg used palladium electrodes
placed in deuterium-rich heavy water, Wilner said.
   According to the notes, the experiment produced helium and
energy. ``But in those days it wasn't possible to record whether
the reaction produced more energy than was used to initiate it,''
Wilner said.
   There is no evidence that U.S. researchers knew of the
experiments in Germany and Sweden.
   Johan Rafelski, working on a fusion research team at Brigham
Young University in Provo, Utah, was in Sweden last month to report
on the U.S. experiments. ``He seemed amazed to find that cold
fusion attempts were performed all those years ago,'' Wilner said.

   Police smashed into a barricaded campus
building today and arrested 35 people protesting military research
at the University of Massachusetts. Five others were arrested
outside, a school spokeswoman said.
   In East Lansing, Mich., black students demanding more minority
students and faculty continued a sit-in at Michigan State
University, and 25 people were arrested in a student-government
dispute at Fresno State University.
   The UMass protest, which began Tuesday, was the fifth such
takeover at the 25,000-student school in three weeks.
   Those in the building were charged with trespassing, and five
others were arrested for trying block a bus carrying away the
protesters, said spokeswoman Jeanne Hopkins.
   The Faculty Senate scheduled a special meeting for this
afternoon to discuss military research.
   ``There is a strong feeling among some people that it is an
issue of academic freedom,'' said Harlan Sturm, chairman of the
Faculty Senate rules committee. ``But others point out that we have
already imposed some limits on what research may be done on campus.
We have prohibitions against using human subjects and doing
classified or any other research that can not be made public.''
   The wave of occupations began April 19 with a sit-in at a
laboratory and resulted in 111 arrests.
   ``This is the first time they've barricaded the doors,'' said
school spokeswoman Stacey Chase. ``Before, even the police were
allowed in as observers.''
   In East Lansing, Mich., 200-300 blacks held Michigan State
University's administration building in a protest that began
Tuesday.
   ``We are here as long as it takes. We are here to stay until
this is over,'' a leader, Darius Peyton, told the students. Peyton
said the students want more black hiring and recruitment and
appointment of a minority adviser to the provost.
   In Fresno, Calif., university police Wednesday ended a two-day
sit-in in the student government office at Fresno State University
by members of a liberal campus party. The protest disrupted a
meeting on bylaws changes.
   The liberals accused the conservative student administration of
sexism and racism for seeking changes they said would dilute power
of the top two elective positions, which will be held next year by
women, one of them Hispanic.

   A member of the U.S. observer team that
visited Panama said today there are ``disturbing parallels''
between Panama before last weekend's election and the voting
scheduled for next February in Nicaragua.
   ``Having just returned from Panama our reflections are fresh,
and the lessons we have drawn have important applicability to
develoments in Nicaragua,'' Keith E. Schuette told the privately
financed Commission on Free and Fair Elections in Nicaragua.
   Schuette is president of the National Republican Institute for
International Affairs, which, with its Democratic counterpart,
sponsored the Panama observer team headed by former Presidents
Carter and Ford. The balloting was branded as fraudulent by
observers and the Bush administration.
   ``Our experience in observing a variety of elections around the
world is that the quality and intention of an electoral law is but
one element of the critical determinants of whether an election
will be free and fair,'' Schuette said. ``The other two points of
analysis are the caliber and organization of the opposition and the
over-all organization of government.''
   ``There are disturbing parallels, too frequent to be considered
accidental, between these three elements in the cases of Nicaragua
and Panama,'' he said.
   ``My own analysis of the current environment _ and I should note
that the Republican institute has just concluded a seminar in
Managua with opposition parties on the electoral process _ is that
sufficient freedom of organization, expression and activity does
not currently exist to ensure a free and fair election,'' he said.
   On Wednesday, an official of the National Security Council said
the Bush administration reserves the right to seek renewed military
aid to the Contra rebels if the Sandinista regime holds power by
fraudulent means in next year's election.
   ``If it is perceived that they have stolen the election, then
our policy subsequently will reflect that,'' NSC Counselor Peter
Rodman told the conservative-backed Commission on Free and Fair
Elections in Nicaragua.
   ``The wider this perception, then the stronger consensus there
will be for an appropriate policy afterward,'' Rodman said.
   The official was asked his reaction to the testimony of Senate
Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas, who told the privately funded
group on Tuesday he would favor ``significant military aid'' to the
Contras if Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega fails to hold free
elections as promised.
   ``I have nothing to add to what was part of the bipartisan
accord a couple of months ago, that the administration does reserve
the right to ask for such aid in the future if circumstances
change,'' Rodman said. ``That's not part of our present policy, but
the administration has not given away its future right to ask for
such things if it seems appropriate.''
   The bipartisan agreement, reached in the face of congressional
resistance to administration requests for immediate military aid to
the Contras, calls for continued non-lethal aid only.
   Asked by former Sen. Gaylord Nelson, D-Wis., commission
co-chairman, what U.S. policy would be if a fair election resulted
in an Ortega victory, Rodman replied: ``I hesitate to prejudge
everything we would do. I think there is a presumption that if
there is a fair election and we accept it as a fair election, that
makes a big difference in our attitude toward Nicaragua and
certainly our policy.''
   Carl Gershman, president of the National Endowment for
Democracy, a private grant-making organization that receives an
appropriation from Congress, testified that the Nicaraguan election
process ``will not work, and indeed will be a farce, if there is
not concerted effort by the Central American presidents and by
others who are concerned about the situation to insist upon fair
rules.''
   ``So far, the fear is that there have been certain cosmetic
steps that have been taken, perhaps to improve the standing of the
government in Europe and elsewhere, but that there has not been any
real effort to sit down and establish an agreement,'' Gershman
said. ``Unless there is agreement on rules, it will undermine the
legitimacy of the whole process.''
   Elections are to be held in Nicaragua next February under an
agreement Managua made with the governments of Costa Rica, El
Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras.

   A lawyer for an Indian tribe that gets 94
percent of its income from oil royalties complained today that the
three federal agencies in charge of protecting Indian wells from
theft are ineffective.
   Tom Shipps, attorney for the Southern Ute tribe, said putting a
request for action to the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the Minerals
Management Service or the Bureau of Land Management is like
throwing it into the Atlantic Ocean's Bermuda Triangle, where
legend says boats mysteriously disappear.
   He singled out the Minerals Management Service as making so many
compromises with industry over the years that it no longer
effectively protects the Indian owners of oil wells.
   Shipps testimony came during an investigative hearing by a
special panel of the Senate Select Committee on Indian Affairs that
has been probing theft of Indian oil and underpayment of their
royalties.
   Shipps said the Southern Utes have been supervising their own
oil wells for the last 10 years. He and others urged the committee
to grant more management power to the tribes.
   The panel's chairman, Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., on
Wednesday blasted the Bureau of Land Management for what he called
``benign neglect.''
   It's ``unbelievable,'' said DeConcini. ``An `I don't care'
attitude. An `I don't give a damn' attitude. I hope someone loses
their job.''
   DeConcini's comments came after a day of testimony by BLM
officials about their work in Oklahoma.
   He became particularly angry during the hearing when Bob
Goodman, supervisor for inspection and enforcement technicians of
the BLM in Tulsa, said he didn't call the FBI about theft in the
oil fields because he couldn't find the phone number.
   DeConcini waved a telephone book over his head.
   ``You couldn't find the phone number?'' he bellowed. ``I'll show
you where the phone number is. It's right in the front of the
book.''
   DeConcini turned to George Brown, deputy assistant director of
energy and mineral resources with the BLM in Washington.
   ``Do you think Mr. Goodman, who can't find the FBI phone number,
is meeting his responsibility?'' the senator asked.
   When Brown said he thought the agency's inspection force was
fulfilling its charge to the Indians, DeConcini raised his voice
even further.
   ``That's no more meeting the responsibility than I'm an
astronaut, and I'm not an astronaut,'' he shouted.
   Goodman tried again.
   ``I talked to the FBI in 1984 and got no response,'' he said,
saying he left his name and number with the FBI but didn't get a
call back and then never tried to reach the agency again.
   Brown said he thought Goodman had made a satisfactory attempt.
   The testimony Wednesday concentrated on Oklahoma, although the
committee's probe extends to all states where Indians have wells.
   Earlier, Jim Sims, district manager of the BLM in Tulsa, told
investigators for the committee that anyone who wanted to steal oil
could do it because of the remoteness of wells on Indian lands.
   Dale Tunnell, special agent with the BLM in Santa Fe, N.M., said
the problem was further complicated by confusion over who could
make arrests when stealing is discovered.
   He said no one in the BLM has the authority to do so on Indian
land.
   Nine inspectors in Oklahoma are responsible for about 5,000
wells, of which about 3,000 are Indian, said Brown.
   He presented documents showing that in eight years the BLM had
discovered theft of $20,490 worth of oil.
   This also drew strong criticism from the committee, which has
discovered millions of dollars worth of theft in the six months
it's been investigating stealing in the oil fields.
   FBI agent Richard James Elroy, who has been assigned to the
special committee, said, ``Give me a staff the size of the BLM and
two years and I'd come back with a truckload of indictments.''

   A woman whose daughters died three years
apart under mysterious circumstances arrived at court today to
appear before a grand jury, one day after burying the second infant
next to the firstborn's unmarked grave.
   Paula and Robert Sims are the primary suspects in the
suffocation of Heather Sims, whom they reported abducted on April
29, investigators said. Their firstborn, Loralei, died under nearly
identical circumstances.
   Mrs. Sims, 29, and four relatives arrived at the Madison County
courthouse in Edwardsville today to face a grand jury. Her husband,
37, was not subpoenaed.
   Police say Sims told them that he believed his wife accidentally
killed Heather and Loralei.
   The Simses, accompanied by more than a dozen family members,
attended a private half-hour funeral service for Heather on
Wednesday at the First Baptist Church in Bethalto.
   The infant, whose body was found in a trash can on the Missouri
side of the Mississippi River on May 3, was buried in nearby
Woodland Hills Cemetery.
   Two police detectives stood about 150 feet from the cemetery
where they shot photographs and scribbled notes.
   At the church, the Rev. Charles West urged reporters and
photographers to stay far away from the building ``out of respect
for the baby.''
   Heather's body was in a tiny white coffin, and an employee of
the Gray Funeral Home in Wood River served as the lone pallbearer.
The Simses held hands as they walked into the church.
   Cemetery manager Bill Helvie said the Simses requested that
Heather be buried next to the unmarked grave of their firstborn
daughter, Loralei, who was 13 days old when they reported her
abducted on June 17, 1986.
   The Simses seem ``just like normal parents to me,'' Helvie said
as he dug Heather's grave Wednesday morning. ``That's why it's hard
to believe all that's going on.''
   Helvie recalled that the Simses visited the other child's grave
several times and put flowers there.
   Remains believed to be Loralei's were found near the Simses'
home in nearby Brighton _ where the couple was living at the time _
about a week after the couple reported her abducted.
   The case was never solved, though the couple are suspects in her
death also, Jersey County authorities said.
   The Simses' attorney, Donald E. Groshong of Alton, had no
comment Wednesday. He said earlier that the Simses denied any
wrongdoing.

   A Bahrain navy boat disposed Thursday of
a floating mine off the coast near the gulf island's international
airport, the official Gulf News Agency reported.
   The mine was found in territorial waters east of Al-Muharraq,
where the airport is located, and detonated, the news agency said.
   Mines left over from the Iran-Iraq war continue to turn up along
the Arabian coast, nearly nine months after a cease-fire took hold
Aug. 20.
   The contact-type mines break loose from underwater moorings off
Iraq and drift southward, threatening commercial shipping and
fishing craft.
   Two weeks ago, authorities said an oil tanker moored off the
United Arab Emirates was damaged by a derelict mine.

<HEAD>Generic-Drug Co. Chief Accuses FDA of Retaliating for Bribery Probe</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The head of a generic-drug company told
Congress today that the Food and Drug Administration is retaliating
against his company for having started an investigation into
alleged bribery at the agency.
   Roy McKnight, chairman of Mylan Laboratories in Pittsburgh,
testified to a a House investigations subcommitttee that the FDA is
holding up approvals of the company's products because ``this was
one way to retaliate.''
   ``Discriminatory treatment or wholly unjustified inaction
continues to be the rule rather than the exception'' at the FDA's
generic drug division, McKnight said.
   Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., the subcommittee chairman, said he
will inform FDA Commissioner Frank Young personally ``that any
retaliation by any FDA employee against the firms or individuals
who testify before us will not be tolerated.''
   Dingell also said he will ask Young to explain the steps he will
take to assure that Mylan and other companies testifying before the
subcommittee will not be discriminated against by the FDA.
   FDA spokesman Jeff Nesbit said of the retaliation charge, ``No
one has had a chance to look into that.'' He also said the agency
has asked the inspector general for the Department of Health and
Human Services to audit the management and supervisory practices of
the generic drug division.
   Nearly a year ago, McKnight took his complaints about arbitrary
and discriminatory treatment by FDA generic-drug officials and his
allegation that bribes and payoffs were being accepted by FDA
employees to the House Energy and Commerce investigations
subcommittee.
   The panel began an inquiry and turned over its evidence to the
U.S. attorney's office in Baltimore for a criminal investigation.
   So far, two FDA employees and a drug company executive have been
charged in a wide-ranging investigation. More charges are expected.
   ``You would think that news like this and the increased scrutiny
the division has faced as a result of this subcommittee's
investigation would produce a new atmosphere at the generic-drug
division,'' McKnight said. ``On the contrary, the agency's response
has been business as usual.''
   McKnight said his company has been trying for more than 18
months to get FDA approval to make several drug products at its new
plant in Puerto Rico. The company already has approval to make the
drugs at its Morgantown, W.Va., plant, he said.
   He said the company was told by an FDA employee ``that we would
never get approvals for Puerto Rico.'' The employee, Walter Kletch,
appeared before the subcommittee under subpoena last week but
exercised his Fifth Amendment right and declined to answer any
questions.
   Investigators have said that while the investigation has turned
up serious problems with the FDA's process for approving generic
drugs, they have found no evidence that unsafe or ineffective drugs
have been put on the market.
   Generic drug sales amount to $8.9 billion annually.
   On Wednesday, Charles Y. Chang, a former generic-drug division
supervisor who has been charged with taking bribes, said in an
affidavit submitted to the subcommittee that favoritism was common
in the division.
   Special handling of applications resulted partly from pressure
by the larger, more sophisticated companies, said Chang, a key
figure in the investigation.
   Favoritism that helped speed the processing of applications, he
said, ``was not necessarily the result of illegal behavior, but
reflected, in part, highly personal, arbitrary and often arrogant
management.''
   He also referred in the document to examples of special
treatment and said they ``were the result of continuous pressure
put on the division, at all levels, by the industry through
lobbying, conducted by executives, lawyers, consultants, and
occasionally through political channels inside and outside the
FDA.''
   Chang was charged earlier this week in U.S. District Court in
Baltimore with two counts of interstate travel in aid of
racketeering. He was accused of accepting a free trip to Hong Kong
and furniture as bribes from American Therapeutics Inc., a Bohemia,
N.Y., generic drug manufacturer.
   He has agreed to plead guilty and has been cooperating with
investigators, said his attorney, Barry Leibowitz.

<HEAD>$100 Million Settlement Reached in San Juan Hotel Blaze, Lawyers
Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The DuPont Plaza Hotel in San Juan, Puerto Rico, has agreed to
pay about $100 million to settle lawsuits stemming from the New
Year's Eve 1986 fire that killed 97 people, newspapers reported
today.
   The Telegram of Bridgeport, Conn., and The Hartford (Conn.)
Courant attributed the figure to unidentified sources today.
   The Star Tribune of Minneapolis quoted James Fetterly, a
Minneapolis lawyer for the hotel, as saying the settlement would be
substantially less than the $200 million in settlements from the
1980 MGM Hotel fire in Las Vegas.
   A former hotel maintenance worker pleaded guilty to setting the
DuPont Plaza fire during a labor dispute at the 22-story hotel,
which was packed with almost 1,000 tourists. More than 140 people
were injured.
   About 2,300 plaintiffs sued for a total of $1.8 billion. The
hotel was cited for 25 violations by the Occupational Safety and
Health Administration, including lack of emergency exits from the
casino, where 84 victims died.
   Richard Bieder, whose Bridgeport law firm represents the
families of the nine Connecticut people killed in the blaze,
confirmed Wednesday that a settlement had been reached, but he
refused to discuss the amount.
   The agreement, reached Tuesday, is subject to approval by two
federal judges, the newspapers said.
   Fettery said if the agreement is approved, about 170 defendants,
including those who provided furnishings and services in the hotel,
still would have claims against them.

<TEXT>
   Texas Agriculture Commissioner Jim
Hightower, under fire for his enforcement of farm chemical rules,
would lose much of his power to regulate pesticide use under
legislation passed by the House today.
   The legislation sets up a pesticide regulatory board headed by
the commissioner, meaning he will be only one of six votes.
   The board, consisting of experts in chemistry, agriculture,
public health and the environment, would take ``emotionalism and
politicism'' out of pesticide regulation, said Rep. Rick Perry, a
Democrat.
   The measure was an amendment to a bill extending the life of the
Agriculture Department. State departments and agencies must undergo
a review every 12 years and are abolished unless the Legislature
decides to keep them.
   The amendment was approved 88-54 on Wednesday after a bitter
debate. The overall bill goes back to the Senate for consideration
of the amendment.
   ``This is an amendment that hurts farmers. It helps chemical
companies. It weakens the pesticide protections of the people of
the state of Texas,'' Hightower said.
   Hightower, a Democrat, has been criticized by some farm and
chemical groups for enforcement of pesticide regulations and for
advocating the sale of hormone-free beef to European countries that
want it.
   The Texas Farm Bureau, the state's biggest agriculture group,
has even urged abolition of the elected commissioner post in favor
of an appointed panel.
   The pesticide board would give the commissioner ``the
intellectual expertise, the scientific expertise'' to make
pesticide decisions, Perry said.

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III today
rejected Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's proposa to
negotiate _ and unilaterally reduce _ short-range nuclear missiles
in Europe.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze said the U.S.
rejection ``seriously concerns us.''
   Baker rebuffed Gorbachev's offer in an unexpectedly long,
3{-hour Kremlin meeting the secretary later described as a ``rather
extensive and in-depth discussion.'' He told reporters and he and
the Soviets had ``agreed that we would continue to disagree
agreeably on this.''
   The secretary said the United States would not negotiate
cutbacks in NATO's Lance missiles because Washington believes the
weapons have served as an effective deterrent to the Soviet bloc.
   Shevardnadze, meeting separately with reporters, said Gorbachev,
in a ``crucially important conversation,'' had made ``a most
important proposal ... concerning reductions in Soviet tactical
nuclear weapons in Europe and a comprehensive resolution of this
question.''
   In rejecting the offer, Shevardnadze said the Bush
administration had taken a ``very negative position'' and added,
``This seriously concerns us.''
   ``The proposals made by Comrade Gorbachev contain some
unilateral measures covering the reduction of tactical nuclear
arsenals in Europe,'' he said.
   The official news agency Tass said Shevardnadze had complained
that the missiles could be used to deliver a first strike and that
modernizing the NATO stocks _ which the United States has proposed
_ would destabilize Europe.
   Gorbachev's offer of reductions appeared aimed at pressuring
NATO into dropping plans to modernize its 88 Lance missiles, most
of which are based in West Germany.
   The Bush administration says the Soviet Union and its Warsaw
Pact allies must unilaterally reduce what it says is an advantage
of 12-1 in tactical missiles before NATO can consider beginning
negotiations.
   Shevardnadze said both sides had agreed not to discuss the
contents of Gorbachev's proposal, but it would be published in the
Soviet press Friday.
   The Soviet Union did not propose discussions on short-range
missiles, which have a range up to 300 miles, as part of
negotiations on reducing conventional arms in Europe, Shevardnadze
said, adding that Gorbachev had, however, made unspecified offers
to discuss conventional force reductions at talks in Vienna.
   On a more upbeat note, Baker said the two superpowers would
resume talks next month on long-range nuclear weapons and a nuclear
test ban. He announced that negotiations on longer-range, strategic
nuclear weapons, recessed last year, would resume between June 12
and 19.
   He also said talks with the Soviets on a nuclear test ban would
start June 26.
   Baker met with reporters before flying to Brussels, Belgium, to
tell the North Atlantic Treaty Organization about his two days of
talks, his first visit to the Soviet Union.
   NATO itself is embroiled in a dispute over the missiles. Despite
strong resistance from the United States and Britain, West Germany
is insisting on East-West talks that would reduce the weapons. Most
of NATO's 88 Lance misiles are based in West Germany.
   Baker appeared to rule out the possibility that Gorbachev and
President Bush would hold their first summit meeting soon.
   ``We agreed that we would further discuss that issue at the next
ministerial (meeting) minister Shevardnadze and I have, probably in
September,'' Baker said.
   American secretaries of state and Soviet foreign ministers
traditionally meet in New York each fall at the start of U.N.
General Assembly sessions.
   Baker met with Gorbachev in the Kremlin for about 3{ hours, 90
minutes longer than scheduled, U.S. officials said.
   Baker said that in the meeting with Gorbachev, which ran 90
minutes longer than planned, he gave the Soviet president a letter
from Bush expressing ``the Bush administration's broad view on how
they want Soviet-U.S. relations to develop.'' The letter also
referred to the Kremlin chief's wide-ranging overhaul of Soviet
society domestic policy. According to Baker, it ``emphasized in the
strongest terms our wish to see perestroika succeed.''
   On other issues, Baker said the Soviets gave U.S. officials a
list of people who will be allowed to emigrate. The secretary had
met Wednesday with a group of dissidents and Jewish refuseniks,
people not allowed to emigrate, telling them Washington would
``keep up the pressure to resolve individual cases.''
   The Middle East also figured prominently in Baker's two day of
talks.
   ``We think there may be a fair amount of common ground to our
approaches to the Middle East,'' Baker told reporters. ``We talked
about the idea of giving elections a chance.''
   That was a reference to Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's
proposal for elections in the Israeli-occupied territories. The
Soviet Union has called the plan an attempt by Shamir to gain time
to crush the 18-month-old Palestinian uprising in the
Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   During a picture-taking session in the Kremlin's St. Catherine
Hall of the Grand Kremlin Palace before beginning his talks with
Baker, Gorbachev said: ``Everything will be on the right road.''
   Baker then returned to the Foreign Ministry guest house to sign
an agreement with Shevardnadze on cooperation in combating
pollution in the Bering and Chukchi seas in emergencies.

   Hitching 40 Belgian horses to one wagon
is like killing a mosquito with a bazooka, but Paul Sparrow says
that's beside the point.
   ``It's the spectacle of the thing,'' he said.
   The original 40-horse hitches were developed at the turn of the
century to advertise the circus and at the time, he said, ``It was
the most spectacular thing they could do.''
   Sparrow is putting together a modern version of the big hitch,
and the Zearing farmer says it's still spectacular. ``Sometimes I
almost get mind boggled by it,'' he said. ``I wonder, am I in over
my head?''
   After months of training the animals, Sparrow gave them a
practice spin today on a 300-acre plot on the Sparrow farm.
   ``It went off real well,'' said his wife, Sandy Sparrow.
   Sparrow said the last time family attempted a 40-horse hitch was
in 1977, when his father, Dick, did it.
   Since then, sponsoring money ran out, the Sparrows sold the
animals and went back to farming.
   ``We went all over the country, Rose Bowl, coast to coast,''
said the son.
   Now, thanks to a $120,000 grant from General Foods Corp., the
Sparrows assembled a new team. The grant covers expenses of
training and transportation to the only planned public appearance,
the Great Circus Parade in Milwaukee in July.
   Sparrow, 34, said it takes patience and practice to arrange the
animals correctly.
   ``It's like assembling a football team,'' he said. ``Some
animals are interchangeable and some aren't.''
   Hauling the wagon takes just a fraction of the horsepower
available, meaning there's more than enough energy to cause
trouble, Sparrow said, especially in a crowd.
   ``There's no way you can make them crowd proof, but you do the
best you can.''
   Sparrow said the animals are trained to think nothing of it when
a balloon pops nearby or a band blares or a car horn sounds.
   ``When you stop, you have to stand there and not get spooked,''
he said. ``We drive right up to them in cars with the horn
blaring.''
   Sparrow said he can shout loud enough for the lead animals, 115
feet away, to hear the commands, but the hitch requires two pairs
of mounted outriders as well. One pair flanks the lead animals and
the other is midway.
   ``We had a 4-year-old one time who darted right toward the hitch
and would have gone under if it hadn't been for one of the
outriders cutting him off,'' Sparrow said.
   What if an animal midway in the pack wants to bolt right and the
command is to hang a gradual left? Not to fear, he said, the other
horses will provide the correct influence.
   ``If one horse doesn't want to turn, the others will push him
and he won't have any choice.''

   A spring frost in eastern France will mean fewer

Thursday.
   The group said it could not yet put a precise figure on how much
production would be affected by the late chilling of the Champagne
region, although about one-fourth of the vines were hit by the cold.
   In some areas, practically all the vines were affected and it
seemed likely that some vineyards would produce very few grapes,
the growers said.
   Vineyards in the Champagne region are hit by damaging spring
frosts about one out of every three years, they said.

   A national Klan organization has replaced
its Mississippi leader because he was born a Jew.
   Jordan Gollub of Poplarville, deposed as leader of the
Mississippi Christian Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, said Wednesday
he will form his own Klan organization, either under the name of
Southern Knights of the Great Forest or Gulf KKK Inc.
   Gollub, born and reared in Philadelphia, Pa., by Jewish parents,
said he considers himself a Christian. He said national Klan leader
Virgil Griffin of Mount Holly, N.C., dislikes his ``background and
the fact that I'm against Catholics joining the Klan.''
   Griffin said Gollub's removal was ``mostly concerned (with) his
Jewish background.''
   The Klan historically has directed hate campaigns against Jews,
blacks and Catholics, but Gollub said Griffin's faction allows
Catholic members.
   ``I find it ironic that the leader of the Klan was a Jew,
obviously a self-hating Jew,'' said Eric Gurvis, rabbi at Beth
Israel Congregation in Jackson. Gurvis said Gollub's removal as
grand dragon ``points out the senseless hatred that seems to be a
part of the Klan. I can't say it's unexpected.''
   As head of the Christian Knights, Gollub has marched in several
towns, usually with no more than a couple dozen Klansmen. Griffin
would not reveal the name of his new grand dragon.

<HEAD>Retail Sales Show Lackluster Increase, Evidence of Slowdown in Growth</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Retail sales rose by a lackluster 0.4 percent
in April, the government said Thursday in a report cited by
analysts as evidence that higher interest rates are taking a toll
on economic growth.
   The Commerce Department said sales climbed to a seasonally
adjusted $139.9 billion last month after remaining flat in March
and falling 0.4 percent in February.
   ``The last three months' sales were up 5 percent over the same
period last year, barely keeping pace with inflation,'' said
economist Lawrence A. Hunter of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
``Today's report is another clear sign that the economy has slowed
far more than most analysts realize.''
   Economists had expected a much stronger rebound in April,
anticipating a surge of between 1 percent and 2 percent on the
strength of higher auto sales.
   Car-buying did increase for the first time since November _ it
was up 1.1 percent following declines of 0.5 percent and 1.8
percent _ but the gain amounted to only about half of what was
predicted.
   Auto sales have been hit particularly hard by the Federal
Reserve's strategy of pushing up interest rates to fight inflation,
as have housing-related items such as hardware, building supplies
and furniture.
   ``What the Fed was hoping was to cool off consumer spending
while we still had an expansion led by (business investment)
spending and exports, and it looks like it's going the Fed way,''
said economist David Jones of Aubrey G. Lanston &amp; Co., a government
securities dealer.
   Bond prices, which move up as interest rates move down, rose
slightly in trading after the release of the sales report.
   Still, Jones and other analysts said retail spending is not so
weak as to push the economy into a recession. Retail spending
accounts for about one-third of overall economic activity and is
closely watched as a measure of overall growth.
   Excluding the automotive category, sales rose a sluggish 0.2
percent last month after inching up 0.1 percent in March and
falling 0.1 percent in February.
   ``I don't see a recession in these numbers,'' said economist
Rosalind Wells of the National Retail Merchants Association. ``I
think the economy is slowing, but only in selected areas.''
   The bright spots in the report were sales at department stores
and specialty clothing shops, buoyed by a long-awaited rebound in
sales of women's clothing.
   Purchases at general merchandise and department store were up
1.0 percent following a 0.1 percent gain in March. Clothing stores
reported a large 3.6 percent gain last month, compared with a 0.5
percent drop a month earlier. It was the biggest jump since
February 1987.
   ``They must be jumping up and down and breaking out champagne
bottles,'' said economist Sandra Shaber of the Futures Group, a
Washington consulting firm. ``That industry has been depressed for
so long.''
   Shaber said women's clothing appears to be recovering from a
two-year slump caused by rising import prices and the failure of
merchandisers to offer styles appropriate for women to wear to work.
   Sales of durable goods, ``big ticket'' items expected to last
three or more years, rose only 0.1 percent in April after falling
0.9 percent in March. Sales of non-durable goods, meanwhile, rose
0.6 percent following a 0.5 percent rise.
   Other categories reporting sales increases in April were
gasoline stations, 2.2 percent; and food and grocery stores, 0.7
percent. Michael K. Evans, an economic consultant in Washington,
said the rise in gasoline sales is attributable to price increases.
   Categories posting declines included: building supply and
hardware stores, 0.5 percent; furniture stores, 1.2 percent; bars
and restaurants, 0.9 percent, and drug stores, 1.6 percent.

<HEAD>Bush Aide Seeking Ambassadorship to Be Questioned on Contra Connection</HEAD>

   During his trial, Oliver North contradicted
the sworn testimony of a longtime George Bush aide who says he
didn't find out until August 1986 that North was assisting the
Contras.
   The Bush aide, Donald Gregg, the president's nominee to be
ambassador to South Korea, will face questions about the
Iran-Contra affair at a confirmation hearing Friday before the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
   North, who was convicted of three of 12 charges last week,
testified during his trial that he spoke to Gregg in 1985 about the
efforts of a retired CIA agent named Felix Rodriguez working in El
Salvador to assist an air re-supply operation to the Contras.
   Did National Security Adviser Robert McFarlane ``know about Mr.
Rodriguez's mission?'' prosecutor John Keker asked North.
   ``Yes, I believe he did,'' North testified. ``In fact, I believe
that once I had talked to Mr. Gregg about it, I talked to Mr.
McFarlane about it, about the fact that he would be able to assist
in that country.''
   Gregg testified in a sworn deposition to the congressional
Iran-Contra committees in 1987 that he did not know until an August
1986 meeting with Rodriguez that North was helping facilitate the
movement of weapons and other lethal aid to the Contras.
   In his courtroom testimony, North did not say precisely when he
told Gregg about Rodriguez's mission, but North was responding to
prosecutors' questions about a Sept. 20, 1985, letter he wrote to
Rodriguez.
   The ``Dear Felix'' letter says Rodriguez should approach two
high Salvadoran military officers asking for space at Ilopango air
base to service planes being used to supply the Contra rebels.
   At the time, McFarlane and North were preparing false responses
to congressional inquiries by denying that the National Security
Council staff was assisting the Contras. One of the responses said
that North did not use his influence to facilitate movement of
supplies to the Contas.
   Keker asked North whether he showed McFarlane a copy of the
letter to Rodriguez at the time.
   ``I don't recall ... but as I indicated a moment ago I was put
in touch with Mr. Rodriguez by Mr. Gregg of the vice president's
staff. I mean, he is the person who introduced me to the man,''
North said from the witness stand.
   Gregg, a former CIA official, was then-Vice President Bush's
national security adviser during the Reagan administration.
   He and Rodriguez had been friends since working together in
Vietnam.
   Gregg said Rodriguez never mentioned his work with the Contra
resupply operation until Aug. 8, 1986. Even then, Gregg said he
didn't pass along to Bush Rodriguez's complaints about the way the
operation was being run.
   When North's Contra-supply network began to unravel after a
plane was shot down over Nicaragua on Oct. 5, 1986, Gregg told
reporters he had never talked with Rodriguez about the rebels. He
later corrected his statement, saying he had forgotten about the
August meeting.
   Gregg also can expect questioning from the Senate panel about a
secret plan approved by President Reagan to slip more than $110
million in extra aid to Honduras in exchange for supporting the
Contras.
   Bush said last week that his 1985 trip to Honduras was not part
of any such ``quid pro quo'' scheme. Documents released at the
North trial state that Bush discussed extra aid to Honduras, but do
not allege that Bush tied the aid to Contra support.
   The president said the U.S. government had no quid pro quo
arrangement with Honduras ``as far as I know.''
   However, a 42-page government-approved admission introduced at
the trial says that in mid-January 1986, the State Department
prepared a memo for Gregg in advance of a meeting between Bush and
the Honduran president.
   ``One purpose of the meeting was to encourage continued Honduran
support for the resistance (the Contras),'' said the document.
``The memorandum alerted Gregg that (Honduran President Jose)
Azcona would insist on receiving clear economic and social benefits
from its cooperation with the United States.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former Justice Department official, once the
target of Environmental Protection Agency protests that he
undermined cleanup of federal facilities, pledged on Thursday to
take strong steps against U.S. government polluters if he is
confirmed for EPA's No. 2 position.
   F. Henry Habicht II, the deputy administrator-designate, told
the Senate Environment Committee that he would be an ``aggressive
advocate'' to see that federal facilities ``meet or exceed''
anti-pollution measures in the private sector.
   As chief of the Justice Department's Land and Natural Resources
division, Habicht in 1986 and 1987 admittedly helped write the
Reagan administration policy that forced EPA to negotiate with U.S.
government polluters, instead of handing them orders to clean up
their pollution.
   Internal EPA memos at the time called the plan ``unlawful''
because it was more lenient toward government than private
polluters, and warned the double standard could ``severely damage''
EPA's credibility.
   In more recent interviews, EPA officials said the policy has
allowed the Defense and Energy departments to stall negotiations
involving their facilities, thereby delaying agreements to clean up
some of the nation's worst pollution sites.
   Asked at his confirmation hearing how he would enforce federal
cleanup, Habicht said, ``We in the federal government have to do
what is necessary to bring the federal agencies in compliance. If
that involves ... the administrative enforcement process, I would
support that kind of action.''
   He said in disputes among federal agencies, EPA must be able to
``call the shots.''
   Under questioning from Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., Habicht
acknowledged he could not speak for the White House on federal
facilities cleanup, testifying, ``This is my personal position. I
can't say whether that's the administration's position.''
   But Habicht said federal agencies are more willing than before
to clean up their facilities, and singled out Energy Secretary
James D. Watkins as one who is interested in a strong environmental
program.
   He promised the Bush administration will ``formulate and
communicate to Congress'' a program to bring federal facilities
into compliance with anti-pollution laws.
   Habicht went to work after 1987 for a private consulting firm
headed by former EPA Administrator William D. Ruckelshaus. He is
now at EPA, with the title of consultant to EPA Administrator
William K. Reilly.

<HEAD>Pyongyang Preparing its Biggest International Gathering</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   North Korea is preparing to stage the largest
international gathering ever in that isolated country: a youth
festival with an anti-imperialist theme.
   About 30,000 people from more than 170 countries are expected
for the 13th World Festival of Youth and Students on July 1-8 in
Pyongyang, said So Man Sul, chairman of a preparatory committee for
the pro-North Korean General Association of Korean Residents in
Japan.
   About 20,000 people from 157 countries attended the last
festival in Moscow in 1985, So said.
   North Korea has not held a major international event since the
35th World Table Tennis Championships in 1979, which brought 900
players from 85 countries to Pyongyang.
   North Korea had demanded to be a co-host with Seoul of the 1988
Summer Olympics. The International Olympic Committee offered to let
it stage several of the Olympic events, but the offer fell short of
North Korea's demands, and it boycotted the Games.
   So said the youth festival would be the largest international
gathering ever held in the North Korean capital since Korea was
divided at the end of World War II.
   The festival's theme is ``Anti-imperialist Solidarity and
Peace,'' and will include representatives from the United States,
Japan and Western Europe.
   The festival, first held in Prague in 1947, is a major
political, cultural and sports event involving mostly communist and
Third World nations. Previous hosts have included Budapest, East
Berlin, Bucharest, Warsaw, Vienna, Helsinki, Sofia and Havana.
   Asked about prospects for South Korea's participation, So said:
``We aren't so optimistic.''
   North Korea has invited South Korean radical students to attend
in letters sent through the South Korean government. Since April,
however, South Korea has refused to accept further North Korean
letters meant for radical student groups and dissidents.
   The policy change followed an unauthorized trip to North Korea
by a South Korean dissident, the Rev. Moon Ik-hwan, for talks on
national unification.
   Moon was arrested on his return to South Korea on April 13 on
charges of violating a law requiring all South Koreans to obtain
government permission to visit North Korea. The communist nation
suspended all dialogue with South Korea to protest Moon's arrest.
   So said sports events at the festival would include the
marathon, soccer, basketball, volleyball, table tennis, gymnastics,
swimming and diving.
   All facilities for the festival have been completed in and
around the capital of Pyongyang, he added, including hotels,
stadiums and theaters.
   North Korean officials have been quoted by foreign media as
saying about $4 billion was spent on the festival so far.

   A tractor-trailer hauling heavy
machinery lost its brakes on a mountain road and barreled into this
village today, smashing into cars and an apartment house and
killing at least five people, authorities said.
   The 18-wheeler roared into town with its lights flashing and
horns blaring, witnesses said.
   Authorities said the truck apparently lost its brakes about two
miles outside this village of 750 people 40 miles from Pittsburgh.
   Witnesses said it slammed into several parked vehicles before
colliding with a car on the two-lane highway. The truck then hit a
three-story apartment house whose lone tenant lived on top floor,
setting it on fire, witnesses said.
   Two people in the truck and three in the car were killed, said
Westmoreland County Deputy Coroner Gerald Fritz.
   Witnesses said a huge trench digger fell off the trailer and
skidded to a stop in front of an inn.

   The Cabinet minister in charge
of largely unsuccessful efforts to draw black leaders into
negotiations announced his resignation Thursday.
   Constitutional Development Minister Chris Heunis gave no reason
for his decision, announced a week after he made a ground-breaking
speech in Parliament proposing that blacks be given a role in
Parliament, in the Cabinet and in the selection of a president.
   On Wednesday, another senior Cabinet member and National Party
leader, Home Affairs Minister Stoffel Botha, announced his
resignation, saying he wanted to return to private life. Botha has
overseen the enforcement of press censorship during the 3-year-old
state of emergency.
   Heunis, the leader of the governing National Party in Cape
Province, will resign from the Cabinet on July 1. Botha, the party
leader in Natal Province, will resign Sept. 6, when a general
election is scheduled.
   There will be at least six vacancies on the 17-member Cabinet
when it meets after the election, providing an opportunity for a
major overhaul by F.W. de Klerk, the favorite to succeed P.W. Botha
as president. Heunis unsuccessfully competed against de Klerk in
February for the position of National Party leader.
   Two ministers of agriculture and economic affairs previously
announced they would not seek re-election, and the minister of
manpower quit after being linked to allegations of financial
impropriety. De Klerk's portfolio as national education minister
also probably will be vacant.
   Heunis, 62, joined Parliament in 1970 and has been a close
associate of P.W. Botha during the president's 11 years in power.
Heunis often was mentioned as a possible successor to Botha, but
political commentators said his chances were hurt by his lack of
progress in persuading prominent blacks leader to enter
negotiations about power-sharing.
   Some blacks were deterred by the government's insistence the
white minority retain veto power over major decisions made in any
new form of government. Other blacks say they will enter
negotiations only if jailed African National Congress leader Nelson
Mandela is freed and bans on militant black groups are lifted.
   Heunis announced this week that a group of black mayors and town
councilors had agreed to begin negotiations on power-sharing. But
the 1988 local election that put these officials in office was
widely boycotted by blacks, and black leaders of national
prominence have shown little interest in the so-called National
Forum.
   Under South Africa's system of apartheid, the 5 million whites
control the government, while the 28 million blacks have no role in
Parliament and no voice in national affairs.

<HEAD>New Secrets Act Gets Royal Approval Amid Criticism</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LESLIE SHEPHERD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain's new Official Secrets Act got the royal
seal of approval Thursday, even though it has been denounced by
critics as a government assault on the public's right to know.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's government called it an
improvement on the original 1911 act, which contained 2,000
different ways of charging someone with revealing official
information, however trivial, without authorization.
   Critics said the new law's major flaw is that it denies
officials who leak information about improper or questionable
government conduct the defense that they acted in the public
interest or that the information has already been published
elsewhere.
   The law received the Royal Assent, a final formality before
taking effect later this year. The Home Office said no date has
been announced.
   The 1911 law, hastily passed during a German spy scare, has
given Britain the reputation of being one of the most secretive
Western democracies.
   Technically it covered everything from the civil service's tea
intake to the fertilizer applied to Buckingham Palace's flowerbeds.
   Home Secretary Douglas Hurd said the new legislation ``removes
from criminal sanction the unauthorized disclosure of large
quantities of official information, substantial as well as trivial,
including disclosures which might merely embarrass or inconvenience
the government of the day.''
   Introduced after months of controversy and debate, the new law
codifies the government's right to secrecy in six specified areas
covering defense, the security services, crime prevention and
detection, and international relations.
   The only automatic offenses will be leaking or publicizing
security service bugging, telephone tapping and mail interception.
   In other cases of unauthorized disclosures by journalists or the
800,000 civil servants, diplomats and defense industry workers who
have taken an Official Secrets Act oath, prosecutors will have to
prove a ``damaging disclosure'' has been made about a branch of
government.
   The government says that by shifting the burden of proof to the
prosecution, it has enhanced civil liberties. It also says the new
law is an improvement because the receiver of unauthorized
information is no longer liable to prosecution.
   But critics say that by specifically excluding the ``public
interest'' defense, the government has set freedom back. Newspapers
say the government will have little difficulty finding expert
witnesses such as retired military officers to testify that
publication was damaging.
   ``What of the man who breaks down the door of a stranger's house
to save a child from fire?'' asked John Birt, deputy director of
the BBC, writing in the newspaper, The Independent. ``There may
well be damage, but what counts are the good consequences of his
actions.''
   The new law retains the lifetime gag on members of the MI5 and
MI6 intelligence agencies, and continues to shield the intelligence
services from any parliamentary scrutiny.
   ``The government has drawn the cloak of secrecy even more
tightly around the operations of the security and intelligence
services,'' says Article 19, an anti-censorship organization.
   Since coming to power in 1979, Mrs. Thatcher's government has
mounted at least 24 prosecutions under the Official Secrets Act,
compared with 34 in the previous 68 years.
   In 1985, a jury acquitted civil servant Clive Ponting, saying he
acted in the public interest in exposing a government cover-up
surrounding the sinking of an Argentine cruiser in the Falkland
Islands War. Under the new law, Ponting likely would have been
convicted.
   Civil libertarians claim freedom of expression has shrunk during
the Thatcher era. They cite the government's increasing use of
court injunctions to suppress news; its futile three-year battle to
ban ``Spycatcher,'' a retired intelligence agent's memoirs; a
police raid on BBC studios to seize tapes; an attempt to suppress a
TV documentary questioning the government's version of the killing
of three Irish terrorist suspects; a ban on broadcast interviews
with Irish militants.
   At a news conference Thursday, Lord Stockton, chairman of
Macmillan publishers, said he was ``very frightened that every day
takes a step closer to tyranny ... the mechanisms of tyranny seem
to be inbuilt in our society.''
   Labor lawmaker Norman Buchan said he was concerned ``that
secrecy is now becoming a kind of a habit of governments and as
soon as you have secrecy in government actions, tyranny is an
almost inevitable consequence.''

   President Bush's nominee to be ambassador to
the Organization of American States said Thursday that Nicaragua's
Sandinista government has ``not met what we would consider
standards of legitimacy'' in the first phase of preparations for
elections next year.
   ``There were in fact no direct negotiations between the
Sandinistas and the internal opposition groups over the content of
the reforms that were to be made,'' Luigi Einaudi, director of
policy planning for the State Department's Bureau of Inter-American
Affairs, testified at a hearing.
   ``Rather, these were in effect imposed by the Sandinistas,''
Einaudi said.
   Einaudi was among final witnesses in three days of hearings by
the Commission on a Free and Fair Election in Nicaragua, a
bipartisan panel supported by private donations that will come up
with suggested guidelines for the February balloting. The
commission was established by the conservative World Freedom
Foundation.
   The commission also heard from Keith E. Schuette, president of
the National Republican Institute for International Affairs, which,
with its Democratic counterpart, sponsored the Panamanian election
observation team headed by former Presidents Carter and Ford.
   After observing the elections in that country, Schuette said,
``the lessons we have drawn have important applicability to
developments in Nicaragua.''
   ``Our experience ... is that the quality and intention of an
electoral law is but one element of the critical determinants of
whether an election will be free and fair,'' he testified. ``The
other two points of analysis are the caliber and organization of
the opposition and the overall organization of government.''
   ``There are disturbing parallels, too frequent to be considered
accidental, between these three elements in the cases of Nicaragua
and Panama,'' he said.
   He said he had concluded that ``sufficient freedom of
organization, expression and activity does not currently exist to
ensure a free and fair election'' in Nicaragua.
   That view was echoed by Einaudi, who said the United States was
``very concerned'' that the first stage of preparations for the
election ``has in fact not met what we would consider standards of
legitimacy.''
   He said the Sandinistas appeared to have shown ``a complete
unwillingness to open the system further'' when they empowered
President Daniel Ortega to name all five members of an electoral
commission made up of two Sandinista members, two opposition
members and a neutral member.
   Ortega's naming of a neutral member in reality will make the
commission ``an automatic Sandinista rubber stamp,'' Einaudi said.
   He added, however, that he is ``cautiously optimistic'' that the
Sandinistas may make changes to make the electoral system more
palatable.
   Curtin Winsor, former Reagan administration ambassador to Costa
Rica and co-chairman of the commission, said that although Einaudi
is the ambassador-designate to the OAS he was testifying in his
current State Department capacity.
   The Nicaraguan elections are to be held under an agreement
Managua made with the governments of Costa Rica, El Salvador,
Guatemala and Honduras.

   A group of homeless men, led by a monk
who runs a soup kitchen, has formed a softball team named ``The
Soupers'' and is taking on all comers with a price: Losing
challengers must donate to the soup kitchen.
   ``A lot of people have asked where is our home field. As
homeless people, I tell them it's appropriate we don't have one,''
said Brother Denys Cormier, a monk of the Emmaus Monastic Community
who runs the Downtown Evening Soup Kitchen and is the team's
manager.
   Brother Denys hopes his team will help break stereotypes of the
homeless as people either on drugs or alcohol, and help put faces
on the working poor. He said there are about 6,000 homeless people
in this city of 125,000.
   Teams that play The Soupers will have to make a donation, of any
amount they choose, if they lose. But Brother Denys is hopeful even
victorious opponents will pitch in and help the homeless.
   The challenge has gone out to established teams in New Haven's
softball leagues, and at least two teams have expressed interest.
But Brother Denys said his ballclub will play anybody.
   ``We'll go to Florida if they'll pay for our tickets,'' he said
Thursday.
   The Soupers plan to hold their first practice Sunday, after
attending a weekly church service for the homeless run by their
manager, who will wear his traditional gray robes during games.
   Twenty homeless men have signed up for the team, ranging in age
from their early 20s to mid-30s. Most live at the city's three
homeless shelters, and a number have temporary jobs. Several
members of the fledgling team were top athletes while in high
school.
   Some have had run-ins with the law and are trying to get their
lives back together. Gordon, 22, the team's captain, is one of
them. After graduating from high school in Waterbury, where he
played basketball and baseball, Gordon said he got into trouble
because ``I didn't use my mind.''
   Gordon, who declined to give his last name, has lived at a city
shelter for four months, and has lived at other times with an aunt.
He said playing softball should lift the spirits of the homeless
men and show the community they are no different from anyone else.
   ``Some of these guys are really feeling bad because of the
situation they are in. They have not chosen to be in this position.
I think if you give them a little motivation, they will have a
better attitude toward things,'' Gordon said.
   ``We don't want people to be afraid of the homeless,'' added
Gordon, a muscular and articulate man who is now earning about $40
a day as a temporary laborer. ``If they see us out there playing
ball, maybe they will think they aren't that bad.''
   Gordon said he expects his team to be very competitive.
   A restaurant has already agreed to donate shirts to the team,
and other contributions of equipment or money are being sought.
   Some soup-kitchen volunteers will be inserted in the lineup at
times, a reflection of Brother Denys' belief that the homeless
should not be singled out as somehow different.
   While committed to fighting stereotypes of the homeless, Brother
Denys still chuckles at the thought of all the jokes that may
spring from his fielding a team of homeless men.
   ``When someone yells `Bums' at the umpires,'' he said, ``our
whole team will stand up.''

that he had tested positive for the AIDS virus.
   Sgt. John J. Roantes, 29, pleaded guilty on Tuesday. He could
have received up to 10 years in prison, a dishonorable discharge
and forfeiture of all pay at sentencing Wednesday.
   Roantes was accused of exposing a dental hygienist to the AIDS
virus last year. Several witnesses said they feared for their lives
when blood-tainted saliva sprayed around the room as the hygienist
cleaned his teeth at a base facility.
   Prosecutors said Roantes' failure to tell the hygienist put her
in danger of contracting the virus because she did not take the
additional precautions called for when treating a patient who may
have AIDS.
   But Dr. Jack Stuart Rosenburg, head of the Lambda Dental Center
in New York, testified for the defense that he had treated about
2,000 AIDS or AIDS virus-related patients.
   ``Based on what she said, and the precautions she took, she was
in absolutely no danger,'' Rosenburg said.

   It took two correspondents to fill the shoes one
Diane Sawyer left at CBS' ``60 Minutes.''
   The network on Thursday announced that Meredith Vieira and Steve
Kroft are the new ``co-editors'' of the top 10-rated, 22-year-old
newsmagazine.
   Both come from the network's newer newsmagazine, ``West 57th.''
They join the veteran ranks of Mike Wallace, Morley Safer, Harry
Reasoner and Ed Bradley.
   In February, Sawyer left CBS for ABC, where she will co-anchor
with Sam Donaldson a new prime-time news program scheduled to debut
later this year. In March, CBS hired Connie Chung from NBC, and NBC
hired Mary Alice Williams from CNN.
   In announcing the appointments if Vieira and Kroft, CBS News
President David Burke noted, ``it is especially gratifying that
these outstanding individuals come from within the ranks of CBS
News journalists.''
   Vieira, who has been on ``West 57th'' since its premiere in
August 1985, came from the CBS Chicago bureau.
   Kroft joined ``West 57th'' in November 1986. Before that, he was
in the CBS London bureau.

   Foul-smelling gases from two rancid grain
piles near a grain elevator caused the death of a 24-year-old
pregnant woman who lived nearby, according to a lawsuit filed by
her family.
   Renee Oland, who was seven months pregnant, died in September
1987 from an accumulation of fluid in her lungs, according to the
lawsuit filed in federal court in Fargo.
   Mrs. Oland lived in Lidgerwood less than 200 yards from two huge
grain piles maintained by Harvest States Cooperative of St. Paul,
Minn., the lawsuit said. The piles were begun in 1986 after the
company's elevator ran out of space.
   David Karpinski, a spokesman for Harvest States in St. Paul,
declined comment on the lawsuit Thursday.
   The grain piles were drenched by rain before they were covered
and began to spoil, according to the lawsuit. Residents of
Lidgerwood, in North Dakota's southeastern corner 60 miles south of
Fargo, began to complain of the odor in the summer of 1987.
   Harvest States removed most of the grain later that year.
   The lawsuit maintains the odor from the spoiling grain caused
medical complications that led to the death of Mrs. Oland and her
fetus, according to Galen Vaa, a Moorhead, Minn., attorney
representing the family.
   Storing grain outdoors and using chemicals to cut spoilage is
``an abnormally dangerous business activity,'' said the lawsuit,
filed by Mrs. Oland's father, husband and surviving son.

<HEAD>42nd Cannes Festival Opens as Salute to Entertainment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELAINE GANLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CANNES, France (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Film buffs and movie stars paid homage to
Charlie Chaplin on Thursday as the International Film Festival got
under way for the 42nd year at this sparkling French Riviera resort.
   On Wednesday night, at a special pre-opening, T.E. Lawrence rode
across the desert to the delight of the movie audience in the
European premiere of the restored version of ``Lawrence of Arabia.''
   French Culture Minister Jack Lang opened the 13-day festival,
paying homage to Chaplain. Present for the opening were Chaplin's
granddaughter, Geraldine, as well as Rosanna Arquette, Barbara
Hendricks, Yves Montand, Sophia Loren, Grace Jones and Princess
Caroline of Monaco.
   On Wednesday night, Omar Sharif and Anthony Quinn swept grandly
into the Palais des Festivals for the black-tie showing of the
uncut, original 216-minute version of Sir David Lean's ``Lawrence
of Arabia.'' They ascended a staircase lined with young men in
Bedouin dress.
   At a news conference Thursday, Quinn spoke of his love for the
film.
   ``Last night sitting next to Omar Sharif, we both said to each
other if we made no other picture and had to rest on this picture,
I would be extremely happy,'' he said.
   On Thursday, there was a showing of ``New York Stories,'' the
film with segments directed by Woody Allen, Martin Scorsese and
Francis Ford Coppola.
   ``Lawrence of Arabia'' and ``New York Stories'' are outside the
official competition, but 22 other films from 14 countries are
competing for the prestigious festival award, the Golden Palm, to
be presented at the close of the festival May 23.
   The winner will be decided by a 10-member jury, headed by West
German director Wim Wenders.
   ``I don't think there is a recipe for a good film,'' Wenders
said. ``For me, a good film is a film that has found a moment of
truth.''
   ``We are simply looking for films that achieve a vision ... and
certainly an idea and a feeling,'' said actress Sally Field,
another member of the jury.
   This year's official selection emphasizes film as entertainment,
departing from last year's festival which featured a great many
long, somber ``cinema d'auteur'' films.
   Some say this year's festival has its eye on the stars.
   Film stars are everywhere on Cannes' main street, La Croisette.
Among those showing up Thursday was Nick Nolte, who plays a famous
artist about to be deserted by his lover-assistant in the Scorsese
portion of ``New York Stories.''
   Much awaited is Meryl Streep, whose face stares from magazine
covers and newspaper kiosks all over France. She stars in Fred
Schepisi's ``A Cry in the Dark,'' about an Australian woman accused
of infanticide after her baby is snatched by a dingo in the outback.
   Four American films are competing for the Golden Palm: Spike
Lee's ``Do the Right Thing,'' High Hundson's ``Lost Angels,'' Jim
Jarmusch's ``Mystery Train'' and Steven Soderbergh's ``Sex, Lies
and Video Tapes,'' the director's first full-length film.
   Three French movies are in the competition, including the much
awaited ``Trop Belle Pour Toi'' (``Too Beautiful for You''),
directed by Bertrand Blier and starring France's favorite leading
man, Gerard Depardieu. He plays a garage mechanic who falls out of
love with his beautiful wife in favor of a less- attractive woman.
   Among other films receiving special attention is ``Splendor'' by
Italy's Ettore Scola, a veteran of Cannes.
   While the tone of the festival has been set in the opening days
with films by established directors, four directors competing for
the coveted prize are showing their first full-length films here.
   Beside the official competitors, more than 1,500 movies will be
screened.
   Wenders said he hoped the festival and the jury vote would
``advance the art of cinema.''
   ``Everybody knows how much harm has been done by the fact that
everthing is on television, so much, so fast,'' he said. ``Young
people, especially ... have lost the feeling of going to the
movies.''

<HEAD>Eds: Combines urgent series, edits and updates with military units,

   President Bush today decided to order up to
3,000 U.S. military troops to Panama and evacuate some American
dependents from that volatile country, informed sources said. He
urged allied nations to condemn Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega for
election fraud.
   Adminstration sources said the Pentagon was preparing to sending
the troops from two bases, Fort Ord, Calif., and Fort Polk, La. The
sources said one group of about 1,000 would be dispatched
immediately from the 7th Light Infantry Division from Fort Ord. The
other, he said, would be drawn from the 5th Infantry Divsion at
Fork Polk and would not arrive in Panama ``for days'' because that
is a mechanized infantry division and the men and their equipment
will be transported by ship.
   The actions would beef up the 10,000-strong U.S. troop strength
in Panama with additional forces as one of a series of actions in
response to the nullification of the Panamanian election results by
Noriega and the post-election violent attacks against opposition
politicians, said the sources who had knowledge of Bush's decision.
   In addition, some of the dependents of U.S. personnel in Panama
were to be returned to the United States while others were being
relocated for safety reasons from Panama City and other locations
to the U.S. bases in Panama, a source said.
   Further, Bush was continuing talks with leaders of Latin
countries to support various intiatives they were undertaking in
the aftermath of what many condemned as an election blatantly
rigged by Noriega, officials said.
   For example, the president backed the call by Venezuela for an
urgent meeting of the Organization of American States, the sources
said.
   ``The president is going to take a whole series of actions,''
said one administration official who spoke on condition of
anonymity. The official characterized the moves as ``prudent
measures to asure the safety of Americans and assuare the United
States can fulfill its commitment to the Panama Canal treaties.''
   Earlier today, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Bush
had ordered U.S. military forces to prepare for possible
deployment, as he weighed a series of options against Panama, where
rioters attacked opposition leaders.
   ``Our miltary forces that are involved are being readied for any
possible changes in their status,'' White House Press Secretary
Marlin Fitzwater said in describing the administration stance a day
after Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega nullified elections that U.S.
officials condemned as fraudulent.
   ``We have an obligation to the safety and security of the U.S.
citizens in Panama and we have substantial military commitments in
that country. We intend to meet our obligations.''
   ``There are also steps to be taken on the diplomatic front,'' he
sid.
   The spokesman would not elaborate on U.S. plans. Bush scheduled
an announcement later in the day to announce his plans.
   ``Panama's electoral tribunal last night perpetrated the
ultimate electoral theft in nullifying the elections,'' Fitzwater
said.
   He said Bush and the State Department today were ``conferring
with leaders of Latin American countries'' on the actions he plans
to take. ``We know they share our concern and that shared interest
moves us to define the course of actions that will protect American
citizens in Panama and register our intention to stand up for
democracy in the wake of Sunday's fraudulent election,'' Fitzwater
said.
   The spokesman said U.S. objectives in Panama were to protect the
51,000 American citizens living there, to maintain the terms of the
Panama Canal treaties, maintain U.S. interest in its defense
establishments in that country and promote democracy and the rights
of the Panamanian people.
   Fitzwater also decried the Soviet position stated in the news
agency Tass that Panama was justified in nullifying the election.
The spokesman said that ``tends to throw cold water'' on the Soviet
talk of a new openness.
   Congressional leaders who attended a strategy session with the
president predicted there would be near unanimous support on
Capitol Hill for Bush's decisions.
   ``The president is proposing constructive steps in concert with
other countries,'' said Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif. ``The
president and his people are still consulting with leaders of other
countries that are concerned.''
   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., described Bush's
measures as ``preliminary,'' adding: ``Who knows what may happen
tomorrow, or the next day, or next week. That will depend on the
conduct of Noriega.''
   House Minority Leader Robert Michel, R-Ill., said the American
response ``has got to be something more than just something
symbolic. You either mean business or you don't.''
   House Speaker Jim Wright told reporters after the White House
session, that Bush, ``expressed the absolute determination to
protect American lives. In that we certainly do support him.''
   Ambassador Arthur Davis, concerned for the safety of the
Americans, asked the 152 dependents of diplomats to move to
military bases, and embassy spokeswoman Cynthia Farrell said from
Panama that the move was underway.
   Cranston said it would be ``leaping to a conclusion'' to assume
the U.S. actions would involve military response, although Pentagon
officials said earlier that Bush was ``leaning toward'' beefing up
the U.S. forces in Panama.
   ABC News reported that Bush planned to send 3,000 U.S. troops to
Panama and was working toward a joint measure with Latin allies.
   Pentagon officials who asked not to be identified told The
Associated Press the Defense Department has been told Bush ``is
leaning toward'' deployment of 2,000 to 2,500 combat troops to
Panama to reinforce the American military presence there. But the
sources stressed today that no final decision had been made and
that no ``execute order'' had been received.
   ``It looks like its going to go that way; sending down some more
troops,'' the source said. ``But there is nothing definite and
we're not saddling up the ntire 82nd Airborne.''
   Administration sources said the 5th Infantry Division units will
probably be dispatched with armored personnel carriers and only a
small number of tanks. One official said a mechanized force would
be sent as a precaution in case the situation deterioriates and
additional protection is needed to help dependents evacuate.
   The sources also disclosed that a ``very small'' unit from the
Marine Corps at Camp Lejeune, N.C., might be dispatched via ship
transport, but declined to elaborate.
   And the officials further noted that Bush had the option of
ordering an aircraft carrier battle group to the region. By sheer
coincidence, the carrier America and six escorts departed Norfolk,
Va., and two other ports Thursday, bound for a routine deployment
in the Mediterranean Sea.
   ``The group was told to stay loose, they might have to hang a
right turn,'' said one official.
   The America battle group's deployment was planned months ago and
its departure announced publicly last Monday.
   One military official called the plan ``a show of force that is
being orchestrated at the White House. We're not sure about the
goals from a military standpoint besides our continuing concern
about American dependents.''
   Rioting broke out in Panama following Sunday's presidential
elections, branded as fraudulent by observers and the Bush
administration. The opposition claimed victory and Noriega tossed
out the election results late Wednesday, hours after armed
civilians mobbed and beat several demonstrators in the streets,
including presidential candidate Guillermo Endara..
   U.S. military forces in Panama are on heightened alert. There
are 10,000 troops based at installations along the 50-mile long
Panama Canal.
   In Panama, tribunal head Yolanda Pulice de Rodriguez blamed the
nullification on ``the obstructionist action by many foreigners,''
alluding to the team of observers Bush sent to monitor the
elections.

   The chairman of the Southern Ute Indian tribe

his tribe of about 1,100 members in Colorado depends on oil
royalties for 94 percent of its income.

   Entertainer Liza Minnelli has been
charged with smuggling for illegally bringing her dog Lilly into
Sweden, a court clerk said Thursday.
   The cairn terrier had been threatened with arrest and
imprisonment in a kennel last month, but was freed on bail and
deported to France after negotiations with Ms. Minnelli.
   Criminal charges were filed Wednesday in the district court of
Helsingborg, the port where Ms. Minnelli brought in Lilly on a bus
during her world tour with Frank Sinatra and Sammy Davis Jr.
   Ms. Minnelli faces a stiff fine because it normally is pegged to
income, court clerk Ingalill Falkman said. She refused to speculate
on how high it could go.
   ``We regard smuggling of animals very seriously because of the
risk of spreading rabies,'' Ms. Falkman said.
   Ms. Minnelli has denied intentionally violating Sweden's strict
quarantine laws and said she was misinformed.
   No date was set for the trial, which will be held in
Helsingborg, 420 miles south of Stockholm. Ms. Minnelli, who put a
$2,000 deposit with the court before leaving Sweden, was not
expected to attend.
   Customs agents were alerted by an anonymous caller who saw Lilly
sniffing among the gilded chairs at Stockholm's Grand Hotel.

   Ben Johnson, world record-holder in the 100-meter
dash, suffered minor injuries in a scuffle with five men early
Thursday, chased one of his alleged assailants and held him until
police arrived.
   Johnson, 27, was treated for a broken tooth and swollen lip.
   Johnson had just left a nightclub and was driving his mother's
car when he slowed to allow some pedestrians to cross the street in
the city's swank Yorkville district. One of the men banged on
Johnson's car, police said.
   When Johnson got out of the car to challenge the men, he was
punched in the face, police said. Another man then jumped on the
hood of the car and kicked in the windshield, causing $700 in
damage.
   The man captured by Johnson, John Cesar, 24, was charged with
mischief over $1,000, said police Sgt. David Donald. Police were
seeking the man who assaulted Johnson.
   Johnson's lawyer said the suspects knew it was Johnson in the
car.
   ``I think what most members of the public don't realize is what
this young man goes through on a daily basis _ the verbal abuse and
the physical harassment,'' Ed Futerman said.
   Johnson was stripped of the gold medal in the 100-meter dash at
the 1988 Olympics after testing positive for a banned anabolic
steroid. He set the 100-meter record of 9.83 seconds in 1987.

   The awards show, which was scheduled to be broadcast June 4 from
the Gershwin Theater, will now be done from the Lunt-Fontanne
Theater, a spokesman for the Tonys said Thursday. Manilow's concert
engagement at the Gershwin was to have ended May 14 but its
producers extended the show through June 3 because of a strong
demand for tickets.
   The move also means a more pressing demand for tickets to the

   When Judy Davis was growing up in Australia,
she thought it would be fun to be an actress, although hard to make
a living at it.
   After receiving Oscar and Emmy nominations and winning two
British Academy Awards, the star of such films as ``A Passage to
India'' and ``My Brilliant Career'' has found the opposite to be
true.
   ``I thought it was easy, that you got a part and did it,'' said
Miss Davis, currently making her U.S. stage debut in Tom Stoppard's
intellectual thriller ``Hapgood'' in Hollywood. ``I didn't realize
there would be all this agony.
   ``I think the emotional commitment's pretty hard, to take on
someone else's emotional journey or turmoil, to take it inside you
and put yourself through it,'' she said. Perhaps, she said, that's
why actors sometimes seem temperamental to outsiders.
   ``Actors are very vulnerable creatures,'' she said. ``You have

Miss Rafko, 25, said Tuesday while visiting north Georgia on a

   Miss Rafko, who was Miss America 1988, said she entered her

her nursing-school loans. But after failing to capture the Miss
Michigan crown, she quit trying.
   A cancer patient named Janie, who had become a good friend,
later persuaded her to try again, she said, and she went on to win
the Miss America crown.
   ``Within four hours after I received the title, Janie died,''
she said, adding that ``she made me promise to enjoy life to its
fullest, but to never forget nursing.''

<TEXT>
   Panama's bloodied opposition leaders
today rejected nullification of presidential elections and clung to
the claim they won the vote. Dependents of U.S. diplomats began
moving onto military bases to ensure their safety, an embassy
spokeswoman said.
   President Bush decided to order additional U.S. military forces
to Panama and evacuate some American dependents from the country,
informed sources in Washington said.
   Panamanian soldiers patrolled the capital, and U.S. personnel
were advised to stay off the streets if possible and to wear only
civilian clothes in public.
   International condemnation of Noriega intensified following
attacks on opposition candidate Guillermo Endara and his two
running mates by bat- and pipe-wielding thugs Wednesday.
   ``We won and we will continue to fight,'' said Guillermo Ford,
the second vice presidential candidate who suffered a beating. He
said Endara ``is still president.''
   Ford said he was taken to Modelo Prison where a judge sentenced
him to a year in jail for inciting riot and attacking soldiers. But
he was freed a few hours later. He had stitches over his left eye
and cheek.
   Ford said the opposition wants to talk with the military but
that would require getting rid of Noriega ``because Panama cannot
have two presidents.''
   Noriega is head of the 15,000-member Defense Forces and the
country's de facto ruler.
   Endara suffered a scalp wound Wednesday requiring eight
stitches. His doctors issued a statement today saying his condition
was stable and there were no neurological complications.
   Soldiers did not interfere during the beatings, which broke out
after troops halted an opposition demonstration to protest what
international observers have called the government's theft of
Sunday's vote.
   Davis and other officials said one of Endara's bodyguards was
killed and about 20 demonstrators injured. The military said four
soldiers were wounded.
   Opponents had hoped to rally international opinion against
Noriega and prevent the proclamation of his hand-picked candidate,
Carlos Duque, as president.
   U.S. Ambassador Arthur Davis asked the 152 dependents of
diplomats to move to military bases, and embassy spokeswoman
Cynthia Farrell said the move was under way.
   ``You have these dignity battallions moving around town and
targeting people. We're not sure who they're next targets are going
to be. So rather than leave people exposed to possible attacks by
these roving mobs, they're moving people onto the bases just as a
precaution,'' she said.
   At the Pentagon, officials said the U.S. Southern Command and
Defense Department had not issued similar orders affecting
dependents of servicemen. There are about 14,000 military
dependents in Panama, of whom about 3,100 live away from U.S. bases.
   Sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said Bush planned to
announce he was sending additional U.S. troops to back up the
10,000 American soldiers already in Panama.
   In Moscow, Secretary of State James A. Baker III said Noriega
``has done everything he could to steal that election. And when it
became extraordinarily difficult to accomplish,'' he declared it
null.
   ``Either way you look at it, it is a perversion and a subversion
of the will, the freely expressed will, of the Panamanian people,''
Baker said.
   Spain, Peru, and Argentina today condemned the annulling of the
elections, and Britain demanded that Noriega resign.
   Venezuelan President Carlos Andres Perez for an emergency
meeting of the Organization of American States to consider actions
against Noriega.
   In announcing the nullification, Panama's official electoral
commission cited vote-stealing, vote-buying, missing tally sheets
and international interference in voiding the election. The
commission said nothing about rescheduling the vote.
   More than 300 international observers, including former
President Jimmy Carter, backed opposition claims that Endara won by
a 3-to-1 margin. Official results, however, had shown Duque leading
by about 2-to-1.
   Yolanda Pulice de Rodriguez, head of the Electoral Tribunal,
charged in a nationwide broadcast that the outcome of the vote was
``altered by the obstructionist action by the many foreigners.''
   Bush sent an uninvited U.S. delegation to monitor the elections,
and the CIA reportedly contributed $10 million to the opposition
campaign.
   Washington began its campaign to remove Noriega after he
orchestrated President Eric Delvalle's ouster. Delvalle had tried
to fire Noriega after the general was indicted in Florida on
drug-trafficking charges in February 1988. Noriega denies the drug
charges.
   Noriega claims the United States wants to get rid of him so it
can renege on the Panama Canal treaties, which cede the canal to
Panama by the year 2000.

<HEAD>Attorneys Agree To Make Public Formal Allegations Against Dallas
Judge</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorneys for a judge and the state Commission on
Judicial Conduct agreed Thursday to make public the contents of
formal proceedings against the judge stemming from remarks he made
against homosexuals.
   The allegations cite comments state District Judge Jack Hampton
made in December to the Dallas Times Herald and The Associated
Press as well as remarks a court official in Hampton's office
allegedly made to callers protesting his statements.
   The commission charges allege that Hampton's remarks violated
the Code of Judicial Conduct, which prohibits a judge from publicly
commenting on a pending case. Hampton also is charged with
violating the code that requires a judge to conduct himself in a
manner that promotes public confidence in the impartiality of the
judiciary.
   The agreement came during a brief hearing before special master
Robert Murray, a retired judge from San Antonio appointed to handle
the case. Hampton was not present.
   In an interview published in the Dallas Times Herald in
December, Hampton said he gave a lighter sentence to convicted
killer Richard Bednarski, 18, in part because his two victims were
``queers.''
   Bednarski was sentenced to 30 years in prison. He could have
received a maximum life sentence.
   ``I don't care much for queers cruising the streets picking up
teen-age boys,'' Hampton told the newspaper. ``I've got a teen-age
boy.''
   On the same day Hampton's comments were published in the Times
Herald, he told the AP, ``The victims were homosexuals. They were
out in the homosexual area picking up teen-age boys. Had they not
been out there trying to spread AIDS around, they'd still be alive
today.''
   The charges against Hampton also state that when people who had
read the Times Herald report and heard an AP radio network
broadcast called Hampton's office to complain, they were referred
to an attorney's office and told to ``have a gay Christmas.''
   The commission alleges the court officials' response was
``cavalier, disdainful and undignified.''
   The commission announced in February its decision to initiate
formal proceedings against Hampton.
   Murray will report to the 11-member commission, then the panel
could dismiss the complaint, issue a public censure or recommend
the judge's removal.

<TEXT>
   The tuberculosis rate in U.S. prisons may be more
than three times higher than on the outside, federal health
officials said Thursday, urging testing, isolation and other
measures to curb TB behind bars.
   Researchers with the Centers for Disease Control cited a survey
in 29 states, where prisons reported 31 tuberculosis cases per
100,000 inmates in 1984-85, compared with eight cases per 100,000
reported among non-incarcerated adults in those states during the
same period.
   ``In some large correctional systems, the incidence of TB has
increased dramatically,'' the CDC said, noting that in New York
state there were 106 TB cases per 100,000 inmates in 1986 _ seven
times more than the average of 15 cases reported in 1976-78.
   In New Jersey, inmates had a TB rate of 110 per 100,000 in 1987,
11 times higher than the general New Jersey population. In
California, the rate was nearly six times higher _ 80 per 100,000.
   Tuberculosis, a contagious, bacterial lung disease, occurs in
about 22,000 new cases each year in the United States; most can be
cured with drug treatment. As many as 7 percent of Americans have
latent TB infections, and about 10 percent of them will someday
develop a case of tuberculosis itself.
   ``Persons at highest risk ... are close contacts,'' the CDC
said, noting that TB can pose particular problems in prisons, where
there is often overcrowding and ``where the environment is often
conducive to airborne transmission of infection among inmates,
staff and visitors.''
   The CDC's Advisory Committee for the Elimination of Tuberculosis
is recommending TB testing for most new prison inmates and staff
members _ with the possible exception of inmates just transferring
through for less than a week.
   The CDC committee also recommends new tests at least once a
year, rapid chest X-rays for TB-infected people showing symptoms,
and isolation _ off the prison property, if necessary _ for those
with suspected or confirmed symptomatic TB cases.
   The spread of AIDS-virus infections may play a part in the
spread of TB in prisons, the CDC said. AIDS weakens the immune
system, making patients susceptible to infections other people
might ward off, including tuberculosis.
   AIDS tests should be offered to all inmates with known TB
infections, the CDC report said.

   Rep. Morris Udall, D-Ariz., has been
hospitalized in Bethesda, Md., so doctors can adjust medication he
takes to control symptoms of Parkinson's disease, an aide said
Thursday.
   Matt James, Udall's administrative assistant, said he took the
66-year-old congressman to the National Institutes of Health on
Tuesday.
   ``I've talked to him every day,'' said James. ``He's doing fine.
He's anxious to get out of there.''
   Udall, in his 15th term in Congress, is a known as a strong
protector of public lands and the environment. His illness has made
speaking difficult for him at times, but he continues to lead the
House Interior Committee.
   James said the congressman would be in the hospital about a week.
   Udall has had Parkinson's disease for more than 10 years.
   The disorder stems from deterioration of brain nerve centers
that control movement. The disease's effects can be controlled with
drugs that help restore chemical balance. Udall has undergone
treatment at NIH in the past.

   Elderly people suffer less depression and
anxiety by the time seven months pass after a spouse's death than
do younger people, a study suggests.
   Their reactions may be eased by a feeling that death is expected
in old people, and the experience of having lost friends and
relatives before, suggested researcher Sidney Zisook of the
University of California at San Diego.
   They may also escape a stigma that can affect younger widows and
widowers, who suddenly find themselves single in a peer group of
couples and perhaps perceived as a sexual rival by others of the
same gender, he said.
   Zisook presented the study of more than 300 widows and widowers
Wednesday at the annual meeting of the American Psychiatric
Association.
   He said the sample overrepresented white and middle-class
people. Ages ranged from 26 to 85 years with an average of 61
years. Seventy-one percent were female.
   The subjects had been married an average of 32 years, and 64
percent had lost the spouse to an illness lasting more than three
months.
   Eighty-eight percent of the survivors reported grieving two
months after the death, and those people tended to show more
depression and anxiety than non-grievers one year after the loss,
Zisook said.
   That finding does not support the idea that active grieving in
the short run helps longer-term adjustment, he said.
   To study age-related differences, Zisook and co-authors split
the group into 94 people of ages 26 to 55, 175 people of ages 56 to
69, and 77 people of ages 70 and older.
   The oldest group showed the least amount of depression seven
months after the loss, as measured by three independent standards.
   By one yardstick, 11 percent of the oldest group had moderate to
severe depression at seven months, in contrast to 29 percent of the
youngest group and 23 percent of the middle group.
   The oldest group also showed less anxiety than the younger
groups at two months and seven months after the loss.

<HEAD>Study Says Navy Will Have 110 Fewer F-14s Than It Says It Needs By
1996</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Navy will have 110 fewer F-14 fighter
planes than it says it needs by 1996, according to a study released
Thursday by a congressman seeking to save the Grumman-built jet.
   ``No matter how you slice the Bush-Cheney budget, it comes up
dangerously short in Navy aircraft,'' said Rep. George
Hochbrueckner, D-N.Y., who requested the study by the Congressional
Research Service of the Library of Congress.
   The report, described in its introduction as ``a quick, rough
analysis,'' concludes that the Navy will have 417 F-14 Tomcats at
the end of fiscal 1996, 110 fewer than it has said it will need.
   The study assumes there will be an increased demand for F-14s as
two aircraft carriers are converted from airwings which carry no
F-14s to airwings which carry 20 each, and projects a loss of 70
F-14s during the period due to peacetime accidents.
   Battle lines were drawn last month when Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney submitted his fiscal 1990 budget to Congress, which saved
$360 million by cutting orders for 12 new F-14Ds.
   The F-14D is the largest airplane program of the Grumman Corp.
of Bethpage, N.Y., and company officials say if funding is not
restored, it will be forced to lay off 5,600 employees.

   Arms dealer Richard V. Secord, in an
indictment unsealed today, was charged with lying during the 1987
congressional Iran-Contra hearings by denying he profited from the
U.S.-Iran arms sales.
   The nine-count indictment accused Secord of giving false
testimony to the special House and Senate committees that
investigated the U.S.-Iran arms deals and the diversion of profits
from them to the Nicaraguan rebels.
   The indictment charged that Secord lied when he told the joint
hearings that he ``foreswore'' any profits from the dummy
corporations he operated with his former business partner, Albert
Hakim.
   ``I foreswore them and left to Mr. Hakim to do with it as he
wished,'' Secord said in a statement Iran-Contra prosecutors
charged was false.
   The indictment charged that Secord lied when he said he gave a
Swiss-based attorney only $400,000 of his money to manage. In fact,
it said
   when, in fact, he used the lawyer ``on a continuous basis to
manage over a million dollars of profits allocated'' to Secord.
   A retired Air Force major general, Secord is already charged,
along with Hakim and former national security adviser John
Poindexter, with participating in the Iran-Contra conspiracy.
   He was the lead witness in the televised hearings conducted in
the spring and summer of 1987 by the House and Senate committees.
Secord testified without limited immunity from prosecution before
the congressional panels.
   The latest indictment was returned by a federal grand jury on
April 7 but was kept under seal until the end of the trial of
former White House aide Oliver North.
   North was convicted last week of three felony counts but
acquitted of nine others stemming from his role in the Iran-Contra
affair.
   In a statement, Secord's lawyers called the indictment ``a clear
example of complete abdication of prosecutorial discretion.''
   The second indictment makes it ``painfully obvious that the
prosecutor's office is fearful that what little is left of its
original case against General Secord can no longer withstand attack
in the courtroom.''
   The new charges show that the independent counsel ``intends to
go to extraordinary lengths to find some charge, however
immaterial, for which General Secord can be prosecuted,'' said
defense lawyers Thomas C. Green, James E. Sharp and V. Thomas
Lankford Jr.
   As the indictment was unsealed today, Secord was convicted in a
suburban Virginia court of driving while intoxicated.
   Fairfax County District Judge Barbara Kimble gave Secord a
suspended 30-day jail sentence and ordered him to pay a $500 fine,
of which $300 was suspended, said deputy prosecutor Ray Morrow.
   Secord's driver's license was suspended for six months, but he
was allowed to drive between his home, work and an alcoholism
rehabilitation center, Morrow said.
   The federal indictment charged that Secord ``endeavored to
impede the select committees from learning the true facts about the
finances of the enterprise and his relationship to those finances
by providing false, evasive and misleading evidence'' while under
oath.
   The indictment, ordered unsealed by U.S. District Judge Aubrey
E. Robinson Jr., charged that Secord ``willfully and knowingly''
obstructed the investigation by the congressional committees into
his role as a middleman in the U.S.-Iran arms deals.
   It said, among other things, that Secord lied when he testified
at the hearings that he had no interest in a company called Korel
Assets Inc. even though he was a principal shareholder.
   Secord, 56, is also accused of lying by stating that he did not
share in the profits of the Iran-Contra ``enterprise,'' even though
he earned profits from the operation.
   Each charge upon conviction carries a maximum sentence of five
years' imprisonment and $250,000 in fines.
   Secord is lso charged with lying the committees' staff by
denying that any of the proceeds went to North.
   Independent counsel Lawrence Walsh told reporters that the
charge relates to alleged lies about ``the $200,000 fund'' for
North's family in the event he failed to return from a trip to Iran
and about North's acceptance of a $13,800 home security system.
   The count accused Secord of denying to lawyers for the
congressional Iran-Contra panels that he was aware of any money
from the enterprise that went to benefit North.
   North was convicted last week of accepting an illegal gratuity
when he allowed Secord to install the security system outside his
home in Great Falls, Va.
   Secord and Hakim are already charged with conspiring to pay an
illegal gratuity to North.

<TEXT>
   A 15-year-old girl who says she was
stood up on prom night now wants to get even: She's suing her date
for $49.53 for her shoes, flowers and hairdo he never got to see.
   Palm Beach Lakes High School junior Marlon Shadd says he called
off the date a week before the dance. And besides, he says, he had
a good excuse.
   ``She didn't believe me when I told her I fractured my ankle,''
Shadd said.
   ``This is so stupid. I'm so sick of all this. I've never heard
anything so disgraceful in my whole life,'' his mother, Joan
Bryant, said Thursday. ``I offered her the money. You know what she
tells me? She tells me the boy has to be punished.''
   The teen-agers appeared Wednesday in Palm Beach County Court
after Tomontra Mangrum's mother filed a claim for the cost of the
shoes, flowers and hairdo. A $280 dress with black and white
ruffles was returned unworn.
   There is some dispute over the facts of the case.
   Ms. Bryant said her 17-year-old son, a high school basketball
player, told Miss Mangrum a week before his school's April 7 formal
that he would be unable to attend because he was on crutches with a
fractured ankle. On prom night, he was out of town seeing a college
recruiter.
   But Miss Mangrum says she was stood up without notice.
   ``I talked to him on April 2 and he said he already had his tux
and the tickets,'' said Miss Mangrum, a Berean Christian School
student. ``I was very upset when he didn't show up.''
   Valerie Mangrum of Royal Palm Beach tried to track down her
daughter's date on prom night.
   ``I called and called and called until I got his mother,'' she
said. ``She was very upset about this.''
   Ms. Bryant can't understand why the broken date has wound up in
court.
   ``The problem is everybody looks to her like she's a poor little
innocent girl,'' she said. ``He's a kid, too. He shouldn't be put
to this shame.''
   The Mangrums are demanding $26 for shoes that couldn't be
returned, $23 for a hairdo and 53 cents for flowers in the
teen-ager's hair. Filing the claim cost $31.75, but if they win the
July trial, Shadd may have to pay that, too.
   ``I don't have any money. I'm poor. Why is she doing this?'' his
mother asked.
   County Judge Howard Berman is taking the case seriously.
   ``The issue is, was there a valid contract? We had an offer and
we had an acceptance,'' Berman said. ``Could she have gotten
another date to the prom?''

<TEXT>
   A senior military official accused
neighboring Pakistan on Thursday of planning to invade Afghanistan,
capture two major cities and turn them over to Moslem guerrillas.
   Lt. Gen. Abdul Haq Olumy told a news conference the plan was to
attack the eastern city of Jalalabad and Kandahar in the south on
Sunday.
   The general is secretary of the National Defense Council and a
ranking member of the Communist Party Central Committee.
   President Najib, who uses only one name, has repeatedly accused
Pakistan of armed intervention, which the Pakistanis deny.
   Pakistan serves as a base for the guerrillas, who began fighting
after a communist coup in April 1978, and the insurgents get most
of their support from the United States, China and Saudi Arabia.
   Olumy said 7,000 Pakistani soldiers and militiamen disguised as
guerrillas had been moved to the border or inside Afghanistan for
the new assault on Jalalabad and a smaller force was being
mobilized near Quetter to attack Kandahar.
   Jalalabad, the Nangarhar provincial capital 75 miles east of
Kabul, has been under siege since March 7. The insurgents made it
their first major target after the Soviet military withdrawal was
completed Feb. 15, and they initially predicted it would fall
within days.
   Military officials say the city has been hit by more than
131,000 shells and rockets, more than 500 civilians have been
killed and at least 3,000 wounded.
   Earlier this week, the army launched a counterattack and claimed
the guerrillas had been pushed back as much as 25 miles on two
fronts.
   Kandahar, capital of Kandahar province, has been under sporadic
attack for a year.

   Marcus Dimagio was determined to
become a U.S. citizen, even though he had to take a whole day off
from work at the last minute and travel more than 6,000 miles by
plane, bus and taxi.
   And he was late.
   The native of Chile arrived in a courtroom panting and trembling
Wednesday just as a judge finished swearing in a group of citizens.
   ``He came in shivering, almost in tears and looking very
exhausted,'' Sonoma County Clerk Eeve Lewis said. ``He was about a
half-hour late and the others had already been sworn in.''
   But Superior Court Judge William Bettinelli rewarded Dimagio's
determination by administering the oath of citizenship to him
individually.
   Lewis said Dimagio applied for citizenship in Sonoma County but
moved to Massachusetts before the Immigration and Naturalization
Service set a date for his naturalization.
   Notice of the ceremony's date was mailed two weeks ago, but
since it was forwarded from Dimagio's old Santa Rosa address to
Boston, he didn't get it until Tuesday.
   Dimagio said he didn't know how to change the location, so he
took the day off from work and headed for Santa Rosa on Wednesday
morning. That meant a plane from Boston to San Francisco, a bus to
Santa Rosa and a taxi to court.
   ``He said his first flight this morning was canceled and the
second flight was two hours late,'' Bettinelli said. ``He said he
had to catch a 6 o'clock flight back home because he had to be at
work Thursday.''

<HEAD>Researchers Stymied on Pig Deaths, Could It Be Drought Related?</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Researchers have been struggling for
more than a year trying to find what malady is killing baby pigs,
and one veterinarian says he believes the deaths may be
drought-related.
   Pathologist George Daniels at the Iowa State University
veterinary diagnostic laboratory said the failure of laboratory
tissue studies to indicate a culprit is a strong point in favor of
his theory the deaths are related to bad feed.
   It is possible the deaths come from poor quality grain
containing toxins being fed to the pigs' mothers, he said.
   ``The dollar cost goes into the millions. It's a tremendous
cost,'' said Daniels.
   He said the number of deaths has increased with the drought and
with the related decline in quality and rise in contamination of
grain. The outbreak in Iowa has been in isolated pockets, not
widespread, and no figures for the number of pig deaths was
available.
   Others believe a virus or a new strain of disease is to blame.
   Gene Erickson of the National Animal Disease Center at Ames said
that while researchers have been unable to pinpoint the cause of
the deaths for more than a year, ``This is not something to panic
about.''
   Purdue University has been studying a mysterious outbreak of
baby pigs in Wabash County, Ind., where hundreds of pigs are
reported to have died on a dozen farms.
   Neal Wollen, a veterinarian-pathologist at Kansas State
University, said a new strain of disease may be involved.
   ``You find a group of hog farmers locally having a problem, but
it is not spreading across the state,'' said Iowa State University
extension veterinarian James McKean.
   McKean said scientists, including those at the University of
Minnesota, think the deaths are caused by a virus.

   Mail carriers are supposed to get the job
done come rain, sleet, snow or really mean dogs.
   In this case, the mail carrier could use a good hard rain.
   For the second year in a row, the level of Skaneateles Lake is
so low Mid-Lakes Navigation Co. can't use its regular mail boat to
make summer deliveries to lakeside residents.
   So the company is using a smaller boat _ a Boston Whaler with an
outboard motor _ to serve the 20 to 30 stops along the route. Each
stop has one to four customers.
   ``We just can't get to the docks because of the low water,''
said Peter Wiles, manager of Mid-Lakes.
   Mid-Lakes contracts with the U.S. Postal Service to deliver mail
to summer residents on the lake's southern end from July 1 to the
day after Labor Day.
   ``They can't use rough weather as an excuse, they can't use low
water as an excuse,'' said William Pavlus, the Skaneateles
postmaster.
   Mail service has been available on the water since before World
War II. At one point, there was a steam boat with a post office
aboard, Wiles said.

   Fifty years ago, long before
satellites, space shuttles and planetary probes, work began on a
national research center that would help make all those things
possible.
   NASA's Ames Research Center is celebrating its first
half-century, beginning with an aerial photograph Friday of 2,000
employees arranged into a giant ``50.''
   Over the years, thousands of top scientists and engineers have
worked at Ames, developing swept-wing planes and supersonic flight,
contributing to the Mercury, Gemini and Apollo programs and
tracking Pioneer's voyages through the solar system.
   They have searched for the chemical building blocks of life,
experimented with plants, insects and eggs in space, studied the
effects of weightlessness and looked for holes in the atmosphere's
ozone layer.
   ``The two prominent features of Ames have been outstanding
people and the development of major, unique, national aerospace
facilities,'' said William F. Ballhaus Jr., director of the $500
million-a-year center.
   Space exploration was hardly a hot topic in 1939, when the
National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, predecessor of the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration, founded Ames
Research Center, named for NACA chairmen Joseph P. Ames.
   When tensions mounted before World War II, the government's
Langley Field lab in Virginia was seen as vulnerable to attack by
Germany, and a second facility was proposed 3,000 miles away at the
Army's Moffett Field base, 45 miles south of San Francisco.
   The threat from Japan was considered, but the site also had
low-density air traffic, good flying weather, adequate electricity
and access to the growing western aircraft industry, Stanford and
the University of California.
   Today, Ames is in the heart of high-tech Silicon Valley, and has
grown into a maze of dozens of laboratories, wind tunnels and
offices.
   ``When I first started working here (in 1971), during lunchtime
I'd wander around in the various wind tunnels and laboratories and
ask people what they were doing,'' Ballhaus said. ``It's
fascinating, like a technical Disneyland.''
   The Flight Research Building was put into operation in August
1940. By the fall, three wind tunnels were under construction to
work on problems of theoretical aerodynamics.
   When the United States entered World War II, the basic research
NACA emphasized was phased out while labs concentrated on immediate
problems.
   Research on deicing airplane wings had started at Langley as
early as 1927. But the problem was licked at Ames in 1944, proving
the effectiveness of the new laboratory.
   In 1952, Harvey Allen, a specialist in high-speed theoretical
aerodynamics, was working on missile research when he developed the
``blunt-body theory,'' which would later solve the problem of
heating during a spacecraft's reentry into the atmosphere.
   That theory would shape Project Mercury's reentry capsule and
play a key role in the design of the Gemini and Apollo crafts and
their heat shields.
   Ames work on high-speed flight helped lead to Capt. Charles
Yeager's first supersonic flight in the Bell X-1 on October 14,
1947. Eight years later Ames researcher R.T. Jones came up with the
``supersonic area rule,'' which minimized drag on supersonic craft
and allowed still faster planes.
   In 1958, Ames invented the lifting body, wingless craft able to
fly back into the atmosphere from space, survive entry heating and
land. That idea eventually led to the space shuttle.
   Ames was given responsibility for basic research in life
sciences in 1961 and began studying the chemical evolution of life.
   In the 1970s, Ames broke new scientific ground with its Pioneer
series of space probe. Pioneer 10, launched in 1972, became the
first craft to go through the asteroid belt and returned the first
close-up pictures of Jupiter.
   Four years later, the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence
began at Ames, a program that listens for radio signals from other
civilizations.
   ``Ames has had a big impact on the space program and on other
sciences and it still is very important,'' said Ballhaus. ``The
work here is helping us understand the universe and our
environment.''

<HEAD>Voters Asked to Reset Property Tax Bases to Ensure School Survival</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHARLES E. BEGGS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SALEM, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Neil Goldschmidt and legislative leaders
are asking voters statewide to approve a property tax formula that
opponents say would take control of school financing out of local
hands.
   Supporters say the measure will aid about 100 public school
districts with inadequate property tax bases, some dating to the
early 1900s. A property tax base is an amount a school district can
levy each year without seeking voter approval.
   Measure 1, on the ballot Tuesday, would reset all districts' tax
bases to include whatever extra levies local voters have approved
to make ends meet in 1988-89.
   Under the state constitution, the tax base can automatically
increase by up to 6 percent a year. So broadening the base will
make for bigger automatic increases each year.
   Supporters say this change is the next step in getting Oregon
out of a crisis that had schools closing for lack of money a few
years ago.
   The first step, a ``safety net'' law passed in 1987, allowed
schools in danger of shutting down to fall back on the previous
year's tax levies without additional voter approval. However,
school officials trying to make budgets on 2-year-old tax levies
say they don't have enough money to cope with inflation, enrollment
increases and other needs.
   Goldschmidt, a Democrat, and legislators from both parties argue
that Measure 1 will bring some stability to school financing until
a new source of funds can be developed.
   ``This is just a step, as was the safety net, toward equity,''
said Senate President John Kitzhaber. ``There are no losers in
this, only degrees of winners.''
   Only about a third of the state's 303 school districts are
potentially affected by the Legislature's ballot proposal. They are
mostly rural and relatively small, meaning voters from the large,
urban districts are likely to determine the fate of their tax bases.
   ``It tests whether people view schools as a statewide or local
responsibility,'' said John Danielson, lobbyist for the Oregon
Education Association, the state's largest teachers union.
   Clyde Brummell of Portland, a long-time tax critic and president
of the Oregon State Homeowners Association, said the issue is
whether taxpayers want ``remote voters'' to determine their taxes.
   ``The main thing we object to in the property tax is it's simply
no longer fair,'' he said. ``Until the system is changed, there's
no need to go through with this mediocre approach.''
   Passage of Measure 1 automatically would enact a companion bill
with $112 million in special school aid and property tax relief. It
includes $35 million for educating handicapped students, $35
million for districts with high property tax rates and $22 million
to ensure no districts get less basic aid under the Legislature's
actions this year than they now receive.
   The bill also provides $20 million with the aim of limiting
homeowner property tax bills for schools to no more than 5 percent
of income.

   NBC's inability to attract advertisers for
a made-for-TV movie on abortion demonstrates that big business
listens when consumers take a stand, a crusader said Thursday.
   ``I alerted advertisers about the pro-choice stance of NBC's
`Roe vs. Wade' movie and asked them not to sponsor it,'' said the
Rev. Donald Wildmon.
   The United Methodist minister heads the Tupelo-based American
Family Association, an organization that has successfully
challenged what it sees as profane and morally objectionable
material in magazines, television and movies.
   Wildmon's comments follow a statement by NBC President Robert C.
Wright in New York urging advertisers not to bow to pressure groups
seeking to block the film that is based on the 1973 U.S. Supreme
Court case that legalized abortion.
   In a May 8 letter to advertisers, Wright said he would broadcast
the movie as scheduled Monday without advertising, if advertisers
pull out.
   Wildmon, whose association was credited with ABC's decision May
2 to drop ``Crimes of Passion II'' from its prime-time schedule,
said the latest action by corporate sponsors marked a trend to rid
television of excessive sex and violence.
   He said the association, which has chapters scattered around the
country, was voicing similar opposition to other television
programs, and ``one coming up on NBC Friday night, `Amityville: The
Evil Escapes,' is in trouble.''
   The fact-based ``Roe vs. Wade'' stars Holly Hunter as a
character based on Norma McCorvey, the then-anonymous ``Jane Roe''
plaintiff who sued Dallas District Attorney Henry Wade. Amy Madigan
plays attorney Sarah Weddington.
   The abortion battle heightened when the high court heard
arguments April 26 in a Missouri case that could affect the 1973
decision.
   The movie is about the pro-choice advocates who prevailed, but
it also portrays sympathetically the prosecutors who argued the
other side, though they get much less attention.
   Wildmon said Wright's letter to advertisers asked ``them not to
be bullied. I am in agreement with that _ I don't think these
advertisers ought to let NBC or any other network bully them into
any program.''
   ``NBC has every right to air that movie and the advertisers have
every right to help sponsor it. And more and more consumers are
learning they have every right to spend their money where they want
to and that, I think, has Mr. Wright very upset,'' he said.

<HEAD>White House Criticizes Tass for Blaming US for Panama's Election
Disruptions</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush's chief spokesman on Thursday
criticized the official Soviet news agency Tass for a dispatch
blaming the United States for election disruptions in Panama. The
spokesman said it raised new questions about Soviet intentions on
improving relations with the West.
   Marlin Fitzwater, Bush's press secretary, called the Tass
account ``very disappointing.''
   ``It certainly tends to throw cold water on many of the claims
of a new thinking, a new openness in foreign relations,'' Fitzwater
said.
   Tass, in a dispatch from Panama City reporting on Sunday's
nullification of elections in Panama, said the action was necessary
because the opposition, ``directly instigated by the United
States,'' violated election laws and tried to rig the results
through ``subversive actions.''
   Fitzwater said, ``these statements reflect a lack of changes
that we all would do well to keep in mind.''
   ``While we welcome and encourage glasnost and perestroika'' the
Bush administration intended ``to keep in the back of our minds a
very healthy skepticism about these kinds of things.''
   Fitzwater said the Soviets have yet to match words with deeds.
   Panama's election tribunal invalidated the election results,
saying the stealing of ballots, vote-buying and missing tally
sheets made proclamation of a new president impossible.
   The Tass report asserted that supporters of opposition
presidential candidate Guillermo Endara had violated election
procedures.
   ``They blockaded polling stations, preventing ballot boxes from
being taken to the commission's headquarters in good time,'' Tass
said. ``A considerable number of ballot papers were stolen or
destroyed and several ballot boxes were burned.''
   Tass said the decision to nullify the election ``appears to be
extraordinary, but the only correct one.''
   The Tass story, and Fitzwater's comments, came as Secretary of
State James A. Baker III was in Moscow meeting with his Soviet
counterpart to discuss arms talks, and on the eve of a commencement
speech by President Bush at Texas A&amp;M expected to focus on the
results of his administration's review of East-West relations.

   The Communist Party chief of Moldavia on Thursday
backed a proposed language reform in the republic and lambasted
local party leaders for lagging behind the Soviet Union's fast pace
of change, Tass reported.
   Semyon Grossu ``spoke about the need to grant the status of
official language to the Moldavian language,'' Tass said, but
cautioned that the reform should not infringe on the rights of
other nationalities in the republic.
   Speaking at a plenary meeting of the Moldavian Communist Party,
Grossu said change in Moldavia is not coming fast enough and ``the
causes for this lag are shortcomings in the work of the party
organization,'' the official news agency said.
   He also criticized leaders of some grass-roots political
organizations for stirring up emotions, Tass said.
   Thousands of Moldavians demonstrated this spring in the
republic's capital of Kishinev, demanding changes in official
policy on language, the economy and the environment as well as a
crackdown on widespread crime and corruption.
   In March, the Communist Party newspaper Pravda criticized the
Moldavian party leadership for adjusting too slowly to the
republic's changing political life and letting the protests get out
of hand.
   Grossu in February condemned nationalist activitists for going
too far but endorsed some of their demands to make their native
language closer to Romanian.
   Moldavian and Romanian are the same spoken language, but
dictator Josef Stalin imposed the Cyrillic alphabet after Soviet
troops occupied the region during World War II.
   Grossu said work is under way to gradually reinstate the Latin
script still used in neighboring Romania.
   A draft law on the reintroduction of the Latin script will soon
be put out for public discussion, Tass said.

<TEXT>
   The West German government has advised two
of its nationals to leave Lebanon after their colleague was
kidnapped last week, a Palestinian official said Thursday.
   Lt. Col Wajih Abu Ali, commander of the Palestine Liberation
Organization military police in Sidon, also said the PLO has
decided to stop protecting relief workers Heinrich Sruebig, 48, and
Petra Schnitzler, 26.
   ``But I do not believe Struebig and Schnitzler will leave before
their colleague Markus Quint is freed,'' Abu Ali said.
   It could not be confirmed independently that the two were told
to leave. No one was available to comment at the West German
Embassy in Beirut.
   The three work for ASME-Humanitas, a private organization that
provides medical aid, mainly to Palestinian refugees in Ein
El-Hilweh and Mieh Mieh camps on the outskirts of Sidon.
   Stuebig, an administrator, and Schnitzler, a nurse, said five
gunmen kidnapped them with Quint on May 4. The two said they were
released 10 hours later to transmit the demands of the kidnappers
holding Quint to West German authorities.
   The two disappeared and reappeared under similar circumstances
last year, and an official in Bonn termed the latest incident
``strange.'' Ms. Schnitzler has denied insinuations ``that we have
sort of stage-managed or engineered the affair.''
   She and Struebig refused to spell out the kidnappers' demands,
but ASME-Humanitas spokeswoman Dagmar Nackunstz said Monday they
include a sentence not longer than five years for confessed TWA
hijacker Mohammed Ali Hamadi.
   Hamadi, a Lebanese Shiite Moslem, is on trial in Frankfurt for
air piracy and murder in the June 1985 hijack of a TWA flight
during which U.S. Navy diver Robert Stethem was killed and 39
Americans were held hostage for 17 days.
   Prosecutors are demanding life imprisonment for Hamadi, who will
be convicted May 17.
   Abu Ali said the PLO in Sidon has relayed to PLO chairman Yasser
Arafat its decision to suspend protection of the West German
workers. He refused to say why the command made the decision.
   The PLO military police is in charge of protecting
ASME-Humanitas personnel in the Sidon region which is the guerrilla
movement's stronghold in Lebanon.
   In addition to Quint, 15 foreigners are held hostage in Lebanon.
They include nine Americans, three Britons, an Irishman, an Italian
and a Belgian.

<TEXT>
   A man accused of killing a bald eagle has
been acquitted by a jury after a federal trial that was conducted
much like a murder case.
   Jurors decided Wednesday there was insufficient evidence linking
Steven Lindell to the death of the bird, whose carcass was found
last fall in a ditch about a mile from Lindell's home.
   Lindell was prosecuted under the 50-year-old Bald Eagle
Protection Act, which protects the species as a national symbol and
provides for a sentence of up to a year in prison and a $250,000
fine.
   Two acquaintances testified Lindell had bragged about shooting
the eagle out of an oak tree. Defense attorney Douglas Thomson
charged that the men were making up the story for revenge.
   As in many murder cases, experts testified about the cause and
circumstances of the death. The bird allegedly was shot in
September, but the carcass was not examined by authorities until
several months later.
   Kent Oakes, a chemist with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service,
testified that he found evidence of lead on one of the eagle's
ribs, suggesting it had been shot with a small-caliber weapon. But
Oakes said he did not know enough to say how the bird died.
   Lindell, who did not testify, said he could not have brought
himself to kill a bald eagle. ``I have feeders all over my
property. I spend $40 a time buying feed,'' the 32-year-old truck
driver said.

   The city's health director had a grave

   Cholesterol levels have dropped only slightly since last year
when a citywide cholesterol screening program began, Dr. Brobson
Lutz told reporters gathered among the above-ground tombs at
historic Lafayette Cemetery No. 1.
   ``Similar cemeteries are filling up because people in the city

   Lutz said cardio-vascular disease, a danger of a
high-cholesterol diet, plays a part in about 60 percent of the
deaths recorded in New Orleans each year. He said a recent study
showed the percentage of New Orleans residents with dangerously
high cholesterol levels dropped in the last year from 68 percent to
66 percent.
   ``It may not be a significant amount, but it is a wee bit,''
said Lutz.
   Lutz said he believes people in the area are changing to
healthier cooking methods and cutting down on fried foods.
   ``Basic nutritional changes are taking the place of the
Creole-Cajun cuisine for which we're so famous,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   A former secretary in the
chancellor's office whose love for a Soviet agent led her to spy
for the KGB was sentenced Thursday to 6{ years in prison.
   Elke Falk, 44, was found guilty of passing more than 200
confidential documents to Soviet intelligence agents between 1975
and 1985.
   The documents included West German intelligence reports,
government and Cabinet minutes and information on NATO maneuvers.
   Ms. Falk, who pleaded guilty, said she started spying after
falling in love with a KGB agent who recruited her to work for the
Soviets.
   In passing sentence, Chief Judge Klaus Wagner said Ms. Falk was
a ``willing spy.''
   ``Knowingly and with open eyes, she slipped deeper and deeper
into espionage and caused great damage to'' West Germany, the judge
said.
   But Wagner also praised Ms. Falk's cooperation with
investigators after her arrest in March 1988, saying she gave ``new
and important information about the KGB methods.''
   According to the evidence introduced during the trial, Ms. Falk
fell in love with a Soviet agent who used the cover name of Gerhard
Thieme. The agent was never caught.
   Ms. Falk told the court she met Thieme in 1973 through a
``lonely hearts'' newspaper advertisement and considered him ``the
man of my life.''
   The KGB agent gave her a miniature camera concealed in a lighter
and a hair spray can designed to hide films.
   Ms. Falk worked in several government offices, including the
chancellery and the ministries of transport and economic
cooperation.
   Judge Wagner said the most valuable intelligence material given
to the Soviets came after Ms. Falk moved to the ministry of
economic cooperation in 1979.
   ``They were not state secrets, but they contained the
government's assessment of the international situation,'' he said.
   Wagner said the KGB paid for 23 vacations abroad for Ms. Falk,
during which she met with her lover, who left West Germany in 1974.
   For her 40th birthday, the KGB gave her a gold ring as a
present, the judge said.
   The Duesseldorf court also ordered Ms. Falk to turn over to the
state the $5,200 she received from the KGB.
   West Germany's counterespionage agency for years has warned
government secretaries about the so-called ``Romeos'' _ communist
agents who start relationships with single women working for the
government.
   In the last major spy scandal to rock the West German
government, 15 communist agents were arrested or disappeared
between August and December 1985. Among them was Hans-Joachim
Tiedge, West Germany's counterespionage officer in charge of
catching East German spies. Tiedge fled to East Germany.

<HEAD>West German Says Short-Range Nuclear Arms Could be Eliminated</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Short-range nuclear arms could be
eliminated from Europe if the United States and Soviet Union agree
on reducing conventional forces, a leading politician in the
governing coalition said Thursday.
   West Germany seeks East-West negotiations on reductions in the
battlefield nuclear weapons, most of which probably would be used
on its territory in case of war, but the United States and Britain
are opposed.
   Officials in Bonn said West German leaders, who have pressed
NATO for a more favorable attitude toward reforms in the Soviet
bloc, would discuss superpower relations with Eduard A.
Shevardnadze, the Soviet foreign minister.
   Shevardnadze met with Secretary of State James A. Baker III in
Moscow on Thursday and is to visit Bonn on Friday.
   About eliminating short-range weapons, Otto Lambsdorff said in a
radio interview: ``This is not possible today, but it could be if
conventional forces in Europe were reduced to levels each side
requires for defense.''
   Lambsdorff is chairman of the liberal Free Democratic Party,
junior partner in Chancellor Helmut Kohl's coalition.
   Kohl and Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher, also a Free
Democrat, have called for speedy East-West negotiations to reduce
short-range weapons. The United States and Britain say the weapons
are an essential part of the Western alliance's efense strategy.
   Genscher flew to London on Thursday for more talks on the matter
with British counterpart, Sir Geoffrey Howe.
   In a meeting two weeks ago, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was
unable to convince Kohl to drop his demand for negotiations, which
has split the alliance just before a NATO summit scheduled for
Brussels later in May.
   In Moscow, Baker rejected a proposal by President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev that the superpowers negotiate reductions in the
short-range weapons.
   NATO has 88 Lance missile launchers, most of them based in West
Germany. The missiles now have a range of 75 miles, but
modernization would increase that to about 250.
   Shevardnadze is expected to address many topics during his visit
to Bonn, including disarmament and relations between the two
countries. He will meet with both Kohl and Genscher.
   Before meeting with Shevardnadze, Genscher will see Baker at a
meeting of NATO officials Friday in Brussels.
   A federal government source said: ``We expect Shevardnadze will
be reporting on the current state of Soviet-American relations.
This area is very important and interesting for us.''
   In remarks to Parliament on April 27, Kohl said the West
``should support reform processes in all Warsaw Pact countries. I
urge our European and American friends to help carry out this
policy and agree on a common approach.''

<HEAD>Sting Raising Money to Stop Depletion of Amazon Rain Forest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER ALAN HARPER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rock star Sting and Amazon tribal leaders made a
pitch Thursday for money to stop the depletion of the Brazilian
rain forest.
   ``It's our air conditioning. We produce carbon dioxide with our
industry. The rain forest cleans it up. That's a singular service
that country is giving us,'' Sting said at a news conference. ``We
owe Brazil something.''
   Depending on the estimates, the Amazon rain forest has been
depleted 5 percent to 12 percent, with an area the size of a
football field going every five minutes. Much of it is being burned.
   Ecologists say the vast jungle, as part of the worldwide system
dubbed the ``lungs of the Earth,'' converts carbon dioxide into
needed oxygen. Some ecologists warn that the loss of the Amazon
rain forest contributes to the ``greenhouse effect,'' or global
warming.
   Resources from the Amazon also are used in production of a
significant amount of the world's prescription drugs.
   Sting, seated with Indian tribal leaders from Brazil and South
Dakota, said he was glad attention was now focused on the Amazon.
   ``What doesn't please me is the emphasis of that attention'' _
the search for a culprit, Sting said. ``If I was a poor Brazilian,
had no money, no land, I too would burn the forest. So too would
everyone in this room.''
   Sting blamed the multinational corporations and the banks in the
United States for bleeding Brazil with fixed, inflexible interest
rates on the South American nation's debt.
   ``The reason is America is in debt, also,'' said Sting.
   ``Why? I'd have to say it's because we've wasted our money on
nuclear arms, our so-called defense budget. It's the poor people of
the world who are paying that.''
   The Brazil-based Rainforest Foundation hopes to raise $4 million
to $5 million to protect 100,000 square miles that already belong
to the Indians with a buffer of trees, observation towers and
ranger stations, to buy one or two airplanes, maintain the area and
develop cash crops.
   Norway has donated $200,000 and other governments have indicated
an interest. Members Only, a clothing manufacturer, announced at
the news conference that it is devoting its fall advertising
program to the campaign to preserve the rain forest.
   The campaign began last month in France with an audience with
President Francois Mitterrand. The group also has met with the
pope. Next stops are Canada, Japan and Australia.
   In Brazil, which has rejected outside interference in the
matter, President Jose Sarney has listened to the group, Sting said.
   ``We have a dialogue,'' Sting said. ``We hope to finesse that
dialogue into a successful mission.''

   Never mind that the sky was filled with
gray clouds. Martin Z. Mollusk saw his shadow on Thursday, which
means summer will arrive a week early.
   The hermit crab performs an annual ritual similar in spirit to
that of Pennsylvania's Punxsutawney Phil, who is said to herald six
more weeks of winter whenever he sees his shadow on Groundhog Day.
   Tracy French, Miss Ocean City, carried the crustacean mascot to
the beach on a tiny decorated throne. To symbolize Ocean City's
commitment to clean beaches, the throne was set upon a container of
recyclable materials such as aluminum cans and glass bottles.
   With toddlers performing a hula around him and some devoted fans
and curious onlookers standing nearby, Martin crept out of his
shell and saw his shadow _ or so says Mark Soifer, the city's
imaginative public relations director.
   ``It was overcast, so no one thought he would see his shadow,''
Soifer said. ``But trust me _ there was an itsy-bitsy, teeny-weeny
area of sun that came through.''
   Soifer said the omen that summer will arrive a week ahead of its
normal June 21 date was authenticated by Gus the Amazing Weather
Dog, another Ocean City mascot. The dachshund also performs an
annual ritual. He buries Martin immediately after the event.
   Martin, however, was again rescued and returned to his ``heated
solarium,'' an aquarium tank in Soifer's office, until next year.

   Elementary school pupils set free
7,000 ladybugs in what their principal called an ecological
alternative to an annual balloon launch.
   Balloons, with notes attached, are often released by school and
community groups eager to see how far their messages will travel.
Many wind up in fields and wetlands, where the balloons can be
fatal to foraging wildlife.
   The idea to launch ladybugs came from Agnes Clift, a school
volunteer who works at a gardening shop that sells ladybugs as an
alternative to pesticides. Clift said she bought seven 1,000-bug
bags and donated them to the school.
   Chamberlin School pupils prepared for the launch by reading
about ladybugs and discussing them in class. On Wednesday morning,
they took small plastic cupfuls of the bugs into the schoolyard,
where the insects flew away or were set on tree trunks or blades of
grass.
   ``I think they're neat because they crawl all over and they're
good for everything,'' said Jason Lockwood, 7.
   ``It's gross. They feel funny,'' said 6-year-old Lucas Dusablon.
   ``It's a new tradition that we're starting,'' principal Rick
Marcotte said. ``It went great. We'll do it again next year.''

   John P. Mack, who resigned Thursday as a
legislative aide in the face of widespread public criticism over
his brutal 1973 attack on a woman, was a powerful figure in the
tightknit world on Capitol Hill.
   As a key assistant to House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, Mack
was a visible staffer, often seen buttonholing legislators on the
House floor. Taking orders from his boss, Mack sometimes ran
closed-door meetings for Democrats, guided policy and sat behind a
large desk near his mentor's office.
   ``When people looked at John Mack on the floor, they saw and
heard the speaker,'' said Rep. Joe Moakley, D-Mass. ``He really ran
the procedural part of meetings,'' added Rep. Beryl Anthony, D-Ark.
   Mack was ``not only a professional but a good friend. And I
think that expresses the views of many of my colleagues,'' said
Rep. Tony Coelho, D-Calif., the majority whip, in a guide to
congressional staffers, ``The Almanac of the Unelected.''
   Coelho and Mack were even investors together in Dairy Management
Associates, a business in Merced, Calif., Coelho's hometown,
according to David Dreyer, Coelho's spokesman. The company is
developing a system for managing dairy herds.
   Mack's desk was empty Thursday, he'd cleared it out overnight,
but the 35-year-old former aide's presence seemed to dominate the
House where he'd worked since his release on parole in 1975 from
the Fairfax County jail in Virginia.
   ``Everybody is very depressed around here,'' said Rep. Barbara
Boxer, D-Calif.
   Though Mack was sentenced to 15 years in the Virginia State
Penitentiary for the malicious wounding of Pamela Small, he served
less than 27 months in jail before going to work in Wright's office
as a mail clerk for $9,000 a year. Mack's brother was married to
Wright's daughter.
   By the time The Washington Post printed a long story last week
detailing Mack's attack on Small with a hammer and knife, he was
one of the highest-paid staffers on Capitol Hill, earning nearly
$87,000 a year as the executive director of the Congressional
Democratic Steering and Policy Committee, the majority party's
policy-making group.
   ``He was a super-staffer,'' said Andrea Camp, a spokeswoman for
Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo.
   Mack, who frequently worked 12-hour days, is married to an aide
to Rep. Nicholas Mavroules, D-Mass. They have two children.
   Rep. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, co-chairman of the Congressional
Caucus for Women's Issues, said she thought it wrong that Mack
should hold such an influential job when he ``clearly violated the
law, didn't finish his sentence and didn't pay restitution'' to
Small.
   Snowe drew a distinction between employment on Capitol Hill and
elsewhere.
   ``We make public law; that makes a big difference,'' she said.
Snowe drafted a letter asking Wright to reconsider Mack's job, but
the aide resigned before she sent it.
   ``I believe in rehabilitation, but not when it leads to such a
high position,'' said Schroeder, the other co-chair of the women's
caucus.
   Rep. Charles Wilson, D-Texas, said there is ``obviously
resistance to someone being a success.''
   ``We all believe in rehabilitation, that's everyone'e goal,'' he
said. But society wants rehabilitated convicts to be ``carpenters
and plumbers,'' not high-ranking congressional aides, he said.
   ``Apparently there was outrage among women members'' of
Congress, said Rep. Dan Glickman, D-Kan.
   ``There was an immediate reaction that went nationwide,'' said
Anthony, chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign
Committee. ``I can understand the emotional outcry ... I heard it
from my staff ... we heard it in congressional committees.''
   But the former prosecutor said that under the country's criminal
justice system, Mack had paid his debt.
   Even so, Anthony said, ``society is not quite willing to forgive
at a certain level.''
   In a statement on his resignation, Mack said he had planned as
early as last December ``to seek opportunities in private life.''
   Anthony doubted Mack would have any trouble in the outside
world. ``He will land a comparable job someplace,'' the Arkansas
Democrat said. ``He's a bright lad that's gained invaluable work
experience.''

<HEAD>U.N. to Airlift 33,000 Namibian Exiles; SWAPO Guerrilla Killed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HEIDI VON EGIDY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly 33,000 Namibian exiles have
signed up to return home in a massive airlift that is part of a
United Nations plan to bring independence to this mineral-rich
territory, a U.N. official said Thursday.
   Also on Thursday, the territorial government announced security
forces killed a black nationalist guerrilla, raising to 313 the
number of insurgents the South African-led forces say they have
killed since an unexpected April 1 incursion from Angola.
   Nicolas Bwakira, chief representative in Namibia for the U.N.
High Commissioner for Refugees, said a five-week repatriation will
start May 22, provided the South African-appointed territorial
authorities implement an amnesty and repeal racist laws.
   Both steps are called for in the U.N. plan to end 74 years of
South African rule. South Africa has agreed to grant independence
as part of a regional agreement calling for the withdrawal of
50,000 Cuban troops from Angola.
   Most exiles have lived in Angola or Zambia since fleeing Namibia
during a 23-year guerrilla war waged by the South-West Africa
People's Organization.
   Bwakira said some exiles will return from Angola on foot, but
most will be flown back.
   They will be given food rations and cooking utensils and
encouraged to leave U.N.-supervised reception centers within a week
of arrival, said Bwakira, of Burundi, Central Africa.
   Namibian churches are to provide long-term care for 1,500
orphans, elderly and disabled returnees.
   At a separate news conference, a government spokesman announced
the killing of a SWAPO guerrilla but gave no details.
   He said the fighter was among 1,600 guerrillas who infiltrated
from Angola after April 1. Pretoria says the incursion violates the
U.N. plan. SWAPO was not a signatory to the accord signed by
Angola, Cuba and South Africa.
   Saturday marks the end of a two-week period in which U.N. and
security force officials were to verify whether the guerrillas have
withdrawn. South Africa says its troops will be confined to base
only if a total SWAPO pullout is confirmed. This will be discussed
at a meeting Monday with Angolan and Cuban officials.
   The guerrillas are to return home, unarmed, with the refugees.
   It is estimated there are perhaps 58,000 Namibian exiles.
Bwakira said 32,950 have registered to be repatriated. Others may
register later or decide after independence, scheduled early next
year.
   Most exiles support SWAPO and Bwakira said the U.N. monitoring
force in Namibia will seek to ensure their return takes place
``without fear of intimidation, harassment or prosecution.''
   The repatriation will cost $38 million, of which $31 million
already has been pledged by Western governments, Bwakira said. It
includes $10 million from Nordic countries, $5 million from the
United States and $1 million from Canada.

<TEXT>
   An unarmed Midgetman
missile went off course and was destroyed today during the first
test flight of the controversial weapon system, the program
director said.
   The missile began to tumble about 70 seconds into the flight
while its second stage was firing and the range safety officer
issued a destruct command, Maj. Gen. Ed Barry told reporters.
   But he called the launch a ``qualified success'' because the
flight test met about 50 percent of its objectives.
   The intercontinental ballistic missile, designed to be fired
from a truck launcher, blasted off from a concrete pad at 11 a.m.
PDT.
   The missile was supposed to deliver a dummy warhead to a test
range about 4,600 miles away in the Kwajalein Atoll.
   The Midgetman, formally the Small Intercontinental Ballistic
Missile, is designed to carry a single nuclear warhead to a target
up to 6,900 miles away.
   The three-stage missile weighs 37,000 pounds, stands about 52
feet tall and is 46 inches in diameter.
   The weapon is at the center of a controversy over whether the
United States should develop one or two mobile nuclear missiles to
deter the Soviet Union from attempting a first strike against
missiles inside silos.
   The Soviet Union has deployed two such ``land-mobile'' missiles,
the United States none.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney would prefer to develop only one _
a version of the huge, 10-warhead MX that could be carried and
launched from a rail car. Democratic leaders on Capitol Hill prefer
the smaller, more mobile Midgetman.
   President Bush recently decided, however, to pursue development
of both the MX and Midgetman.
   The major contractors on the Midgetman include Morton Thiokol
Inc. and Martin Marietta Corp.

   The bombings of two Minnesota state judges'
homes 15 miles apart were connected, authorities say, and the U.S.
Marshals Service says threats against federal court officials are
on the rise.
   Criminals ``think threatening the judge will solve the
problem,'' said Bill Dempsey, a spokesman for the Marshals Service.
   ``It kind of goes with the turf, unfortunately,'' said Olmsted
County District Judge Gerard Ring, who received several death
threats last year after a controversial ruling in the case of a
youthful ax murder suspect.
   ``I don't think there's been a judge who's been on the bench
more than a couple years who hasn't had some threats or harassment
of some kind,'' said Anoka County District Judge Lynn Olson.
   ``Most of us don't take it very seriously, and perhaps we ought
to,'' said Olson, who is president of the Minnesota District Judges
Association.
   Authorities announced Monday that an April 26 blast that
severely damaged the Blooming Prairie home of Freeborn County
District Judge James Mork was caused by a bomb. The judge, his
wife, and an 18-year-old son were home but escaped injury. Police
Chief Terry Bredeck estimated damage at more than $80,000.
   Fifteen miles away, On May 29, 1988, an explosion and fire
destroyed Mower County District Court Judge William Nierengarten's
home in Austin. No one was home at the time.
   Both judges serve in southeastern Minnesota's Third Judicial
District.
   ``We can certainly link the two. There's no question of it,''
said Pete Mastin, special agent in charge of the St. Paul office of
the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.
   Steele County Sheriff Bill Hildebrandt said both explosions
caused the same ``crater effect,'' or concussion pattern, and both
blew inward into the houses. Blooming Prairie is in Steele County.
   There have been no arrests, and police say they know of no
motive for the two bombings.
   Nierengarten does not speak about the incident, his law clerk
said. Mork would not comment, except to express confidence in the
investigation.
   ``By the grace of God we survived the explosion and we are
thankful for that. We intend to stand firm and move forward with
our lives,'' Mork said.
   Meanwhile, threats against federal court officials are
increasing, said Dempsey of the Marshals Service, which has
protected federal judges for nearly 200 years.
   ``At any one time through the United States we have at least one
federal judge under 24-hour protection,'' Dempsey said.
   In 1983, 119 threats were received against federal judges,
attorneys, jurors and witnesses, Dempsey said. By 1988, the number
had risen to 213, and 152 threats were reported in the first six
months of fiscal 1989, he said.
   Dempsey attributes the increase to aggressive law enforcement
and increased crime, particularly in drug trafficking.
   ``There's a substantial effort throughout the nation of getting
the criminal off the street and to win the war against drugs and
put the drug pushers away,'' he said.
   As for threats against state court judges, the National Center
for State Courts in Williamsburg, Va., does not have statistics.
But Phillip Lattimore, a center staff associate, said, ``I think
there is a general trend across the country for state courts to be
more security conscious, especially judges.''
   In several recent cases:
   _ U.S. Attorney Leon Kellner in Miami was temporarily moved from
his home and placed under tightened security in 1987 after U.S.
officials in Colombia reported a threat against his life. Kellner
was prosecuting Carlos Lehder Rivas, one of the leaders of
Colombia's cocaine-smuggling Medellin Cartel.
   _ U.S. District Judge Richard Daronco was slain May 21, 1988, at
his home in Pelham, N.Y., just north of New York City by a former
New York City policeman embittered by Daronco's dismissal of his
daughter's lawsuit.
   _ In another Minnesota case, Albert Bolstad was accused in 1987
of kidnapping and raping a girl out of revenge against Winona
County Attorney Julius Gernes, one of her relatives. Gernes had
twice helped prosecute Bolstad and his brother.
   ``We're in an adversarial system,'' Gernes said. ``If you're
going to be a forceful advocate, you're going to, in some
individuals, create hostility which manifests itself in assaults or
threats or worse.''

   Strong swirling winds called a dust devil
tore a giant $18 million anti-drug radar balloon from its moorings,
causing extensive but repairable damage, a Customs Service official
said Thursday.
   Jerry Young, chief of the Customs aviation branch office in
Tucson, said an investigative panel will try this weekend to
reconstruct what happened Wednesday to the 6{-ton Aerostat.
   The blimplike helium balloon is made of lightweight and highly
resistant thin materials and is 245 feet long and 72 feet in
diameter.
   ``I think it ripped itself apart by being moored on a pad with a
tremendous amount of wind force associated with one of these dust
devils,'' said Young.
   A dust devil, a whirlwind or miniature tornado, struck the
balloon, which carries a sophisticated, 3,500-pound look-down radar
package underneath, and tore it from its mooring pad and caused it
to deflate rapidly, he said.
   Officials said the balloon, which can be tethered up to 10,000
feet in the air, was down because of high winds.
   The Aerostat, deployed last June and tethered at the Army's Fort
Huachuca in Sierra Vista, is ``definitely repairable; we've already
determined that,'' Young said.
   No one was injured and there was no damage to other property.
   The service says radar coverage is continuing.

<HEAD>Baker Rejects Call for Missile Talks; Soviets Offer Conventional
Cuts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Diplomatic Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev challenged
the United States and its NATO allies Thursday with two bold
weapons-reductions proposals as Secretary of State James A. Baker
rejected negotiations over nuclear missiles in Europe.
   Gorbachev offered to cut Soviet stockpiles of battlefield
nuclear weapons, but Baker called the offer ``a good step, ... a
small step, ... a modest move.''
   ``There has to be a little less of an imbalance,'' Baker said,
reiterating the U.S. assessment that the Soviets have a 12-1
advantage in European short-range nuclear missiles.
   Tass, the official Soviet news agency, said that the Soviets
would withdraw 500 tactical nuclear warheads from Eastern Europe
this year and that the Kremlin is prepared to pull out all nuclear
munitions from Eastern Europe by 1991 if the United States
engineers equivalent steps in Western Europe.
   A senior U.S. official flying with Baker to Brussels and a
briefing for NATO ministers said the Soviets announced they would
take out of service this year 284 short-range missiles, 166 nuclear
bombs carried aboard airplanes and 50 nuclear artillery shells.
   Along with the request to discuss joint reductions in missile
stocks, Gorbachev moved boldly on conventional arms cuts.
   He told Baker during their 3{-hour meeting at the Kremlin _
Baker's first since becoming secretary _ that the Soviets would
offer in exchange for NATO reductions to cut Warsaw Pact tanks by
40,000, combat aircraft by 42,000 and artillery pieces by 47,000.
   The U.S. official, who demanded anonymity, said Gorbachev also
proposed a reduction of 1 million troops in both alliances and a 55
percent cutback in NATO's combat aircraft.
   By 1997, the official said, Gorbachev aims for equal levels of
1.35 million troops in the two alliances, 1,500 strike aircraft,
20,000 tanks, 1,700 helicopters, 24,000 artillery pieces and 28,000
combat vehicles.
   The Soviet conventional arms proposal will be presented formally
Friday at NATO-Warsaw Pact negotiations in Vienna.
   Baker declined to evaluate the conventional arms proposal. The
U.S. official said Baker told Gorbachev it would be up to the NATO
alliance to reply.
   Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze summoned foreign
ministers from the six Warsaw Pact nations to Moscow for a late
Thursday meeting on the conventional arms offer, the U.S. official
said.
   Gorbachev's announced reductions in Soviet tactical nuclear
weapons appeared aimed at pressuring the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization to drop plans to modernize its arsenal of 700 Lance
missiles and 88 launchers, most in West Germany.
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, backed by several NATO
allies, has demanded the negotiations Baker rejected. Foreign
Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher is expected to renew the plea when
he meets with Baker on Friday at NATO headquarters.
   Baker, who will return to Washington Friday night, is striving
to resolve the dispute with West Germany before, or at least
during, the NATO summit meeting May 29-30 in Brussels. President
Bush will attend with the leaders of the 15 other NATO countries.
   As for the Soviet missile cutbacks, Baker noted that NATO had on
its own eliminated 2,400 nuclear weapons since 1979. Only now is
the Soviet Union announcing cuts of its own, amounting to 5 percent
of its 10,000-weapon arsenal.
   Shevardnadze, who met separately with reporters in Moscow,
called Gorbachev's request for talks on further nuclear weapons
cutbacks ``a most important initiative'' designed to produce ``a
comprehensive resolution of this question.''
   He said that the Bush administration position on such talks was
``very negative'' and added, ``This seriously concerns us.''
   The Soviets contend that the Lance missiles could be used to
deliver a first-strike attack and that their modernization would
destabilize Europe.
   Baker called his discussions with Gorbachev ``rather extensive
and in-depth.'' He said he and the Soviets had agreed to ``continue
to disagree agreeably.''
   The disagreement on tactical nuclear arms discussions contrasted
with an apparent improvement in U.S.-Soviet relations resulting
from Baker's trip.
   On two regional fronts there was apparent progress. Baker
reported that the Soviets would cooperate in peace efforts in
Central America and that the talks with Gorbachev made him
optimistic that Soviet military aid to the Marxist government of
Nicaragua would be reduced from the current level of about 500
million dollars a year.
   In the Middle East, Baker said, ''we think there may be a fair
amount of common ground'' on an Israeli proposal to hold elections
among the 1.4 million Palestinians who live on the West Bank and
Gaza Strip.
   He said the Soviets would help try to persuade Arabs and
Israelis to convert the election process into a broader peace
effort.
   On human rights, Baker left Moscow with a list of Jewish
refuseniks who are being allowed to emigrate after years of wating.
   Baker did not say how many would be allowed to emigrate as a
result of the talks with Gorbachev and Shevardnadze, but
indications were about 100 families would be allowed to go.
   Baker pledged to keep working on behalf of 400 to 500 other
families who are still waiting. State Department officials said
they had a list of about 600 refusenik families.
   The secretary also noted that the two sides had agreed to resume
negotiations in Geneva next month to reduce long-range nuclear
weapons and on their space defense programs.
   Baker said the talks would be reopened between June 12-19 with
the date to be set later.
   The two sides also agreed to resume talks on a nuclear test ban
on June 26.

high-paying private sector jobs, according to a group of federal
employees in Massachusetts.
   The U.S. Office of Personnel Management says it is considering
pay scales that are more ``market sensitive.''
   Private sector salaries rose 22.8 percent from 1984 to 1987
while federal pay rates increased only 10.5 percent, according to a
report from the Boston Federal Executive Board, which represents
27,000 federal employees who earned an average $21,724 in 1987.
   ``The significant pay disparity severely reduces the
government's ability to attract and retain good and bright
employees who can provide quality, timely, and reliable public
goods and services,'' the report said.
   The Boston report follows similar studies by boards in New York
and New Jersey last year that found the inability to hire a quality
workforce has hindered federal agencies.
   Boston is one of the nation's most expensive cities to live in.
It has had one of the highest rates of inflation throughout the
1980s, and home prices and auto insurance rates are among the
highest in the country.
   Boston also has one of the tightest labor markets. Costs
associated with employee turnover and recruitment in the Boston
area amounted to $60 million or nearly 10 percent of the area's
federal payroll, the report said.
   Carl Brauer, a past head of the Public-Private Careers Project
at Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government, said
low pay is one of many factors contributing to low morale among
federal employees.
   ``The system now has such serious problems. It's worrisome,'' he
said.
   But it would be difficult to raise the salaries of the rank and
file bureaucrats without first raising legislative and judicial
salaries. ``Those salaries put a ceiling on everything else,''
Brauer said.
   A proposed 50 percent salary increase for members of Congress,
federal judges and high-ranking federal executives got a poor
public reaction and was defeated last winter.
   The report urges broad-based legislation to grant the Office of
Personnel Management the authority to regulate federal salaries and
keep them in line with shifting labor market and recruitment
conditions. Market-based pay, cost of living differentials and
recruitment bonuses are among other board recommendations.
   Barry Shapiro, the OPM's deputy director for pay programs,
acknowledged that salaries are partly to blame for difficulties
filling positions with qualified candidates. He said the OPM
already is considering restructuring the federal pay system to
consider regional cost-of-living factors.
   ``What we're looking into is coming into some alternative
approaches for redesigning the system so it would be more market
sensitive,'' he said. ``The pay should be more consistent (with)
the demand for that occupation in a given area.''

<HEAD>Study Calls for Welfare Overhaul</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Ford Foundation said Thursday the nation's
welfare system needs a $29 billion overhaul to expand the social
safety net with services like treatment on demand for drug and
alcohol problems and long-term care for the elderly.
   Other recommendations include expanding the Head Start program
for 3 and 4 year olds, assuring all pregnant women access to
prenatal and well-baby care, raising the minimum wage and requiring
welfare recipients to work after receiving benefits for a certain
period of time.
   The foundation's report, ``The Common Good: Social Welfare and
the American Future,'' is the result of a three-year, $3 million
study by a panel of business, civic, labor and civil rights leaders
and educators.
   ``The current social welfare system is out of date and severe
gaps in protection and opportunity for millions of Americans
remain,'' said Irving S. Shapiro, panel chairman. The current
system ``leaves too many people dependent and vulnerable at
critical stages in their lives,'' he said.
   The panel recommends financing the broad array of additional
welfare, education and health care benefits by taxing Social
Security benefits that exceed recipients' lifetime contributions.
Such a tax would raise more than half the $29 billion annual cost
of the recommended programs.
   The federal government now spends $500 billion a year on social
programs.
   The report proposes spending $6.2 billion in federal support to
expand programs such as Women, Infants and Children, Head Start and
Medicaid. All pregnant women would have access to prenatal and
well-baby clinics and 900,000 more 3- and 4-year-olds would
participate in the Head Start program.
   States and local governments would be encouraged to begin and
strengthen programs to combat teen pregnancies, to reduce the high
school drop-out rate and coordinate training and youth guidance
programs.
   About $1 billion would be spent to provide drug and alcohol
treatment on demand.
   Also, the estimated 37 million uninsured would be covered by
health insurance through a blending of employer-based insurance and
an expansion of Medicaid. Employers who did not offer a basic
package of health insurance to its workers would be required to
contribute to a public fund that would finance coverage for those
not working and uninsured.
   The panel's plan would permit unemployed people to receive
lump-sum payments so they can relocate to areas of greater
employment opportunities, and the minimum wage would be raised to
restore the purchasing power of the 1981 level.

<HEAD>Mayor Calls Police Alcohol Training Session an Embarrassment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LAWRENCE, Ind. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An improperly supervised police training
session on the effects of alcohol took a wrong turn when a reserve
officer had to be hospitalized for drunkenness, the mayor says.
   Mayor Thomas D. Schneider said one officer was suspended and
further disciplinary action is expected because of the May 2
session, which ended with dispatcher Linda D. Offenbacker passing
out and being taken by ambulance to Community North Hospital.
   ``Obviously, something went wrong with the way it was done,''
Schneider said, The Indianapolis News reported Thursday. ``That
drinking is supposed to be a controlled (situation), not getting
sloppy fall-down drunk.''
   Police Chief Robert A. Jones said Officer Mike Lair was
suspended for one day because he drove his police car to a
part-time security job immediately after taking part in the
drinking session.
   The evening training program in this Indianapolis suburb was
designed to educate 15 volunteer reserve officers about the effects
of alcohol.
   Jones said three dispatchers and two police officers drank
alcohol for the session. Reserve officers then observed their
behavior, gave sobriety tests and used the Breathalizer machine to
measure blood alcohol content.
   Officer Steve York, who is certified to teach the training
sessions, was in charge. However, Jones said the session was run
improperly, without superior officers at the scene.
   ``There was a lack of supervision,'' Jones said. ``Obviously
through some unknown means (Offenbacker) got beyond the .10 mark,
and it was not our intention she get that much.''
   A person who has a .10 percent blood-alcohol level is considered
legally intoxicated in Indiana.
   A hospital spokeswoman said Offenbacker was treated in the
emergency room and released. She returned to work the next day.
   Jones said he believes Capt. Lana Robinson, in charge of
training for the police department, should have supervised the
program.
   ``It was an oversight on her part,'' he said.
   Robinson bought two cases of beer and two bottles of wine for
the five drinking participants at a cost of about $23, her expense
voucher showed.
   ``I threw in a bottle of Seagram's whiskey that I had at home
because I don't drink myself,'' Robinson said.
   Offenbacker had been drinking the whiskey before she fainted,
Jones said.
   ``This was the first time we had a training session of this
nature and we made some mistakes. I'm not sure we'll have a similar
training session again,'' Jones said.

<TEXT>
   U.S. delegates to a forum on press freedom accused
four East bloc nations Thursday of doing little to further the
cause, and Canada urged the nations to drop what it called their
``same tired old excuses.''
   The 35-nation forum brought together Canada, the United States
and every European country except Albania to monitor compliance of
an accord on improving the information flow between East and West.
   The U.S. and Canadian delegations concluded that Czechoslovakia,
Romania, East Germany and Bulgaria had shown little progress in
fulfilling their commitments to the accord, signed in Vienna in
January.
   Czechoslovakia responded to the charges in its concluding
statement at the month-long Information Forum, saying the West was
not looking at the full picture.
   Chief U.S. delegate Leonard H. Marks told The Associated Press
that ``very little progress'' had been made with the four East bloc
countries.
   ``We didn't expect to solve all problems, but I don't feel we
accomplished as much as I'd like to have,'' said the former head of
the U.S. Information Agency.
   Canadian Ambassador William Bauer said in a speech that some
nations remain in a dark age, where the only ``correct facts'' were
the government's, contacts with foreigners are taboo, and free
communication does not exist.
   ``The London meeting has, unfortunately, only reinforced our
view that such backward practices remain the norm in some
Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe countries,'' he
said, referring to the four nations.
   ``When these countries were justly criticized,'' Bauer said,
``we were treated to the same tired old arguments'' that criticism
was internal interference or deliberately confrontational.
   The security conference ended in January in Vienna with
agreements committing the 35 signatories to improve the flow of
information and improve working conditions for journalists.
   Czechoslovakian chief delegate Dusan Spacil, the only one of the
four to speak Thursday, said in his concluding statement that
``confrontation or bias or disinformation ... is
counterproductive.''
   He said his country was undergoing a ``transitory period'' of
instituting reform and a ``new system in all spheres'' would come
into effect Jan. 1 next year.
   Bauer said the Czechoslovaks had lied about the circumstances of
an arrest of a British Broadcasting Corp. reporter May 1 during
coverage of a dissident protest, saying he had no identity papers
despite the fact that they were holding his passport at the time.
   He and other delegates said reluctance by some East bloc
countries to repeat a Vienna promise that all the forum's
undertakings were binding had kept a final communique from being
composed.
   Instead, as called for under the accord, all proposals made at
the forum were to be passed to the security conference for
consideration.
   Soviet chief delegate Boris Pyadyshev, a magazine editor,
expressed overall satisfaction with the forum, saying it had
brought the participants to a ``new level of understanding.'' He
refused to comment on criticism of his East bloc neighbors.
   Bauer and Marks said they saw encouraging signs of change in
Hungary, Poland, and the Soviet Union, but emphasized this did not
mean those countries had completely lived up to their commitments.

<HEAD>Administration Seeks Retargeting of Training Money to Teens And Poor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration on Thursday proposed
rewriting the nation's premier job-training program to target most
spending on the unskilled poor and teen-agers and to hinge some
federal money on improvements in state training and education
efforts.
   The program was co-authored by Vice President Dan Quayle when he
was a member of the Senate.
   The suggested amendments to the Job Training Partnership Act
answer most criticisms of the program and are substantially in line
with changes proposed by several congressional Democrats, leading
Republicans and Democrats alike to predict passage of a revised
JTPA this year.
   ``There is an urgent need for more than job training,'' Labor
Secretary Elizabeth Dole said in outlining the administration
proposal to the Senate subcommittee on employment and productivity.
``Many desperately need basic skills training, literacy and
remedial education.''
   Although the proposed amendments would significantly redirect
the program, Mrs. Dole said they are needed because of the changing
demographics of the American workforce and not because of major
flaws in the initial legislation.
   ``Its record on advancing the employability of disadvantaged
youth and adults, and returning dislocated workers to the economic
mainstream has been unprecedented,'' Mrs. Dole said. ``But JTPA can
be made even better.''
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, called JTPA ``the singularly important
work of this committee during the Reagan years.'' But he agreed
with Mrs. Dole that the recession-spawned program needs to be
reworked to address current labor shortages, particularly in
high-skills fields.
   The chairman of the subcommittee, Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., has
introduced a package of similar amendments and expressed confidence
minor differences in the approaches would be resolved.
   ``I think we're going to get a good bill out of this committee
that we're all going to be able to agree on,'' Simon said.
   JTPA is by far the nation's largest training program, receiving
$2.4 billion this year to serve an estimated 1.9 million people.
Bush has requested stable spending for next year.
   Labor Department officials have said the proposed amendments
would increase per-person training costs and therefore cause some
modest reduction in service levels. Mrs. Dole, however, said those
reductions likely could be offset if states did a better job of
coordinating federal, state and other education, training and
counseling programs.
   Current JTPA spending formulas send two-thirds of the money to
areas based on their unemployment rates. The amendments would make
the concentration of economically disadvantaged the overriding
factor in spending decisions.
   Also, youth training programs now scattered throughout sections
of JTPA that also deal with adult training would be collected into
a separate entity, which Mrs. Dole said would allow dramatic
improvements in efforts to curb high youth unemployment,
particularly in inner cities.
   During her testimony, Mrs. Dole was flanked by three
participants in JTPA-funded programs. They sparked applause from
subcommittee members when they discussed their troubled childhoods
and achievements made possible by the training and education they
were receiving. They also met briefly later with President Bush at
the White House.
   Also among the changes proposed by the administration:
   _Rewriting eligibility requirements so that in addition to being
economically disadvantaged, all youths and half the adults seeking
enrollment in JTPA programs would need to have additional barriers
to employment such as literacy or basic skills deficiences. Teen
parents and the homeless also would be given preference.
   _Rewriting program guidelines to encourage more thorough
training, including deletion of provisions that weigh a program's
success by the number of placements it makes. Such provisions have
been criticized for encouraging programs to select applicants who
already have marketable skills so that they can be placed in jobs
quickly.
   _Requiring, for the first time, that JTPA funding for summer
jobs programs go only to youths who are enrolled in an approved
education or training program during the school year.
   _Requiring individual assessments of all prospective trainees
and for those accepted into programs, an individually tailored
program to meet the distinct education, training and placement
needs of each trainee.
   _Establishing grants for states that set clear goals for their
training programs and submit to the Labor Department plans that
demonstrate improved coordination between training and related
programs.

<HEAD>USDA: Soviet Grain Harvest Could Increase</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union could produce a bumper grain
crop this year of 210 million metric tons, up 8 percent from last
year's production, the Agriculture Department said Thursday.
   In its first forecast of 1989 Soviet grain production, the
department said prospects stem from ``a relatively good growing
season to date.'' But Moscow's push for greater output of livestock
products for Soviet consumers will mean record grain use and
``continued large grain imports'' to cover shortfalls, the report
said.
   The forecast included 91.5 million tons of wheat, 105.5 million
tons of coarse grains such as corn and barley, and 13 million tons
of ``miscellaneous'' grains and pulses.
   Last year, when production was 195.1 million tons, the harvest
included about 84.4 million tons of wheat, 97.5 million tons of
coarse grains, and more than 13.1 million tons of miscellenous
crops.
   If realized, the forecast of 210 million tons would mean that
Soviet grain production has exceeded 200 million tons in three of
the last four years, an unprecedented production record by that
country. The all-time high grain output was 237.4 million tons in
1978.
   Imports of grain by the Soviet Union in the 1989-90 trade year
which will begin on July 1 were forecast at 33 million tons, down
from 38.5 million tons estimated for the current year but still
``on a par with the average of the past decade,'' the report said.
   ``The push to increase livestock product output has increased
the demand for imported corn and grains for feed,'' the report
said. ``In addition, another year of strong wheat prices is likely
to discourage (Soviet) imports of feed wheat. Total wheat imports
are projected to decline to 12 million tons, the lowest level since
1979-80.''
   Department analysts said the good outlook for the Soviet grain
crop and high world prices for wheat are likely to limit Moscow's
wheat imports ``to not much more than the levels required'' under
various long-term agreements with supplying countries.

<HEAD>Former North Helper Secord Charged With Perjury to Congress</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Richard Secord, the retired general enlisted
by Oliver North to run arms to Nicaraguan rebels, was accused in an
indictment unsealed Thursday of lying to Congress to cover up his
profits from the Iran-Contra affair.
   The indictment alleges that more than $1 million was involved.
   Secord, 56, a retired Air Force major general who already faced
one set of charges in the affair, was accused of seven counts of
perjury to Congress and one count of obstructing the congressional
Iran-Contra investigation in 1987.
   A ninth charge accused him of making a false statement to staff
members for the congressional panels by saying he wasn't aware that
any money generated by his Iran-Contra transactions had benefited
North.
   Each charge carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison
and a $250,000 fine on conviction.
   Secord was the leadoff witness in the televised hearings
conducted in the spring and summer of 1987 by the House and Senate
committees.
   The lastest charges by a federal grand jury were handed up April
7, but weren't unsealed until Thursday in order to avoid bringing
them out during the trial of North, who was convicted on three of
12 Iran-Contra counts last Thursday.
   Secord's lawyers said in a statement, ``The decision to indict
again is vindictive and contrary to any notion of fair play and
professionalism.'' They asked for financial assistance to help pay
for his defense.
   Meanwhile Thursday, Secord was convicted of driving while
intoxicated in late February in nearby Fairfax County, Va.
   District Court Judge Barbara Kimble found Secord guilty,
suspending $200 of a $500 fine and suspending a 30-day jail term.
She ordered that he be given a restricted license permitting him to
drive between his home, work and an alcohol safety program. The
penalties were stayed because Secord appealed to Fairfax County
Circuit Court, where his case is to be heard Aug. 24.
   The new Iran-Contra indictment was issued by a federal grand
jury that last fall began investigating possible perjury by various
figures in the affair.
   Asked whether ``other key players'' would face charges,
independent counsel Lawrence Walsh declined to comment.
   Eight of the new charges relate ``to Secord's financial interest
in the enterprise which ... delivered weapons to the Contras'' and
shipped arms to Iran in 1985 and 1986, Walsh told reporters in
front of the U.S. Courthouse.
   ``The enterprise'' was the maze of companies set up around the
world by Secord and business partner Albert Hakim to carry out the
Contra arms shipments and the Reagan administration's arms sales to
Iran. More than $47 million ``was received, managed and
disbursed,'' said the indictment.
   Walsh said the ninth count relates to alleged lying about a
$200,000 fund set up through Hakim, Secord and Swiss-based lawyer
Willard Zucker for North's family in the event he failed to return
from a trip to Iran in 1986, and about North's acceptance of a
$13,800 home security system. The charge accuses Secord of denying
to lawyers for the congressional Iran-Contra panels that he was
aware of any money from the enterprise that went to benefit North.
   The convictions against North included illegally accepting the
security system.
   North testified at his trial that he hadn't known about the
$200,000 death benefit set aside for his wife and children, though
he had sent his wife, Betsy, to Philadelphia to discuss the matter
with Zucker.
   The indictment said Secord lied when he told Congress:
   _He had no interest in Korel Assets Inc., a corporation that
held his share of the profits from covertly running arms to the
Contras and secretly shipping arms to Iran. ``The Korel account,
unlike the other enterprise accounts, was set aside for the
personal use of Richard V. Secord,'' said the indictment.
   _He had waived his interest in profits of the enterprise and
Zucker had managed ``several hundred thousand dollars, maybe
$400,000'' for him through the years. The indictment said Secord
retained a personal interest in the profits of the enterprise and
didn't advise Zucker he was waiving any interest. It alleged Zucker
was used ``to manage over a million dollars of profits allocated to
the defendant, Richard V. Secord.''
   _He received only his $6,000 a month salary from the arms sales
to Iran and to the Contras.
   _$400,000 to $500,000 paid to his and Hakim's Virginia company
was money lent from a Swiss investment services firm operated by
Zucker's firm, Compagnie de Services Fiduciaries.
   _Funds invested in a company called Tri-American Arms came from
Hakim and not from profits of the enterprise. He also was accused
of lying by denying that one purpose of the Tri-American venture
was to sell arms to the Contras.
   _Defex S.A., a shell corporation was used by the enterprise to
disguise the source and location of enterprise money from arms
dealers. Instead, says the indictment, Secord and others used Defex
S.A. ``to hide and disguise from Contra leaders and American
officials the true prices the enterprise was paying for weapons for
the Contras, and the profits they were taking for themselves.''
   _He had no beneficial interest in any foreign accounts.
   Previously, Secord was indicted on March 16, 1988, along with
North, Hakim and North's boss, former National Security Adviser
John Poindexter.
   All four men were accused of conspiracy and theft of government
property in illegally diverting more than $14 million in U.S. Iran
arms sale proceeds to the Nicaraguan rebels. The conspiracy and
theft counts against North were dropped due to national security
concerns.
   Other charges against Secord from March 1988 were wire fraud,
conspiracy to pay an illegal gratuity, offer of an illegal gratuity
and payment of an illegal gratuity.

<HEAD>Sky Sniper's Bizarre Flight Reminds Airport Operators Of Vulnerability</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LESLIE DREYFOUS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The bizarre flight of an enraged ex-husband who
commandeered a Cessna and flew among city buildings while firing
randomly at the ground below reminded operators of small airports
of their vulnerablility.
   ``What can you do to prevent someone from going in and
terrorizing people?'' asked John Leyden, a Federal Aviation
Administration spokesman.
   ``You just have to play the odds,'' said Greg Chapman, manager
of the Beverly municipal airport where the gunman hijacked the
small plane. ``You go along for years and years and nothing
happens. Then all of a sudden everything goes haywire.''
   Alfred J. Hunter, who also is accused of murdering his ex-wife,
was arraigned Wednesday in Salem District Court on charges of
murder and armed robbery. Judge John Doyle ordered Hunter held
without bail for 20 days of psychiatric observation at Bridgwater
State Hospital.
   The sniper flight early Wednesday struck a chord among airport
officials struggling with security.
   The rampage began with the hijacking of the single-engine plane
at Beverly, about 20 miles north of Boston. The episode ended three
hours later at Logan International Airport, one of the nation's
largest facilities.
   At both facilities, the hijacker had officials backed into a
corner.
   In Beverly, flight instructor Robert Golder was alone and had
little choice but to comply with Hunter's demand for a plane.
   ``When you have an AK-47 (assault rifle) stuck up your nose and
someone ask you to provide an airplane, you just ask them what
color airplane they'd like,'' Amero said. ``It's wise to back off.''
   And during the flight, Hunter buzzed Logan and sent air traffic
controllers scrambling from the tower, closing the airport.
   ``Something like this was impossible to anticipate in terms of
security,'' said Phil Orlandella, a spokesman for Logan. ``And I'm
not sure there's a defense for it anyway. The whole city was
helpless.''
   Hunter's flight ended about 1:15 a.m. Wednesday when he landed
at Logan with about five minutes' worth of fuel left in his tank.
He had no comment, and authorities found no weapon in the plane
although several rounds and spent shell casings were recovered.
   Leyden said that ideally, stringent security measures would be
mandated at all of the nation's 15,000 small airports and landing
strips.
   ``But it would be impossible,'' he said. ``You really can't
prepare for events like these. I don't know what you could do in
the way of security without imposing a tremendous economic burden
on small airport operators.''
   Ralph Amero, who manages the Beverly Flight Center, whose plane
Hunter commandeered, agreed.
   ``At airports such as Beverly there really is no security,'' he
said. ``Generally speaking all we can do is band together as a
group of fixed base operators and try to hire security, but the
cost is prohibitive.''
   Bill Thomas, a senior claims representative at AVEMCO Insurance
Corp. said the Frederick, Md.-based small aircraft insurer, one of
the nation's largest, receives eight to 10 theft reports annually.
   Because a single-engine plane like a Cessna 210 is valued at
about $196,000, costs can quickly soar for insurers like AVEMCO,
which spends about $1 million annually in compensation for stolen
and damaged aircraft.
   ``The Boston incident was certainly an exception,'' he said.
``Naturally, we like to see solid security using the best
surveillance technology.''

   Farmers soon will be harvesting a skimpy
winter wheat crop estimated at 1.43 billion bushels, the smallest
in 11 years, the Agriculture Department said Thursday.
   Although farmers boosted plantings, this year's harvest is
expected to be down 8 percent from last year's 1.56 billion bushels
because of lingering drought in Kansas and some of the other major
production areas.
   Officials said the average yield, based on indications as of May
1, was estimated at 34.9 bushels per harvested acre, compared with
last year's 39.2 bushels per acre.
   Farmers are expected to have about 41.0 million acres for
harvest this year, up 3 percent from 39.8 million in 1988, said the
department's Agricultural Statistics Board.
   Reggie Wyckoff, president of the National Association of Wheat
Growers, said drought in the central Great Plains and freeze damage
in the Pacific Northwest have hurt farmers deeply.
   ``As a result, farmers in these areas deserve to receive federal
assistance similar to that offered last year'' when drought
devastated the northern plains and the Corn Belt, he said.
   Last year, Congress approved a $3.9 billion emergency aid
package to help relieve some of the drought damage. Many have urged
USDA to administratively extend the major benefits to 1989 wheat
producers who have had similar losses, but the administration says
it is up to Congress.
   The new estimates provide ``solid evidence of this season's
losses, and conditions will probably get worse rather than
better,'' Wyckoff said in a statement issued here.
   The Kansas wheat crop was estimated at 202.4 million bushels,
less than two-thirds of the state's 1988 production. Washington's
harvest showed a comparable decline, with output estimated at 68.9
million bushels against 108.5 million last year.
   Despite the sharp losses in the winter wheat areas, USDA
economist Ralph Parlett said the effect will be mild on shoppers.
   ``It's going to be small, but it will have an effect,'' he said
in a telephone interview.
   Parlett said a $1 loaf of bread has about seven cents worth of
wheat in it. Theoretically, he said, if the cost of wheat doubled
the loaf would still cost only $1.07. But he emphasized again that
was a theoretical example.
   Winter wheat is planted in the fall and harvested the following
summer. It makes up about three-fourths of total U.S. wheat
production. The remainder is planted in the spring.
   No 1989 production estimates for spring wheat, corn and other
major spring-planted crops were included. Those will be issued by
USDA later in the growing season.
   However, in a related supply-and-demand report, USDA projected _
based on assumptions of normal weather and ``trend'' yields _ that
total wheat production in the United States this year could be
about 2.05 billion bushels, up from last year's 1.81 billion
bushels.
   The report showed wheat prices could rise to a range of $3.80 to
$4.20 per bushel, on the average, in 1989-90 from $3.74 estimated
for the current marketing year that will end on May 31.
   At the higher prices, wheat exports would drop significantly to
1.15 billion bushels from 1.46 billion bushels currently, the
report showed. The U.S. wheat stockpile on June 1, 1990, would be
drawn down to around 500 million bushels from 594 million bushels
estimated this June 1.
   The report also projected the 1989 corn crop at 7.85 billion
bushels, up from the drought-riddled harvest of 4.92 billion last
year. Soybeans were indicated at 1.95 billion bushels, up from 1.54
billion in 1988.
   But the projections were described as ``highly tentative''
subject to change as the season progresses.

<TEXT>
   Jazz trumpeter Woody Shaw died at Bellevue
Hospital, where he had been in a coma since he was hit by a subway
train in February. He was 44.
   Shaw, who lost his sight to degenerative eye disease several
years ago, fell from a subway platform into a train's path on Feb.
27. Surgeons were unable to reattach his left arm, which was nearly
severed at the elbow. He died of complications Wednesday.
   Herman Shaw II, who was born in Laurinburg, N.C., and grew up in
Newark, N.J., was influenced by trumpeter Freddie Hubbard.
   He took up trumpet in sixth grade and later worked for Willie
Bobo and Eric Dolphy, who invited him to join him in Paris. After
Dolphy died, Shaw worked abroad for several years. He was in Art
Blakey's Jazz Messengers in 1971 and '72 then settled in San
Francisco where he led a group with Bobby Hutcherson.
   By 1977, Shaw was in New York leading small groups playing bebop
with infusions of ``free jazz.'' Despite playing rapid melodies,
Shaw maintained a sweet tone.
   A number of musicians, including Wynton Marsalis, George Benson,
Freddie Hubbard and others who had worked with Shaw, held an
all-night benefit for him after the subway accident.
   Shaw is survived by his parents, Herman and Rosalie Shaw of
Newark; and a son, Louis Armstrong Shaw.

<HEAD>Armenians Mass to Demand Freedom for Activists, Parliament Session</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 300,000 Armenians, chanting and carrying
Armenian flags, massed Thursday in Yerevan to demand action on the
disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh and freedom for imprisoned
nationalists, activists said.
   The situation in Nagorno-Karabakh, where unrest broke out again
recently after four months of calm, was called ``tense and even
explosive,'' activist Martin Martirosian said in a telephone
interview after the protest in the Armenian capital.
   He said speakers at the demonstration, which was officially
condoned, called for a session of the Armenian parliament to
address the status of the disputed region. If no session is held by
May 18, they recommended a general strike, he said.
   The crowd also demanded the ``liberation, immediately and
without too much talk,'' of 13 Armenian activists under arrest,
said Rafael Popoyan, another activist contacted by telephone. Most
of the 13 are members of the Karabakh Committee, which organized
repeated protests about the region.
   People at the demonstration chanted ``Committee, committee,''
and ``Session, session,'' Popoyan said.
   The recent unrest in Nagorno-Karabakh involved strikes and
clashes between Armenians and Azerbaijanis, including a village
brawl fought by 200 people.
   Nagorno-Karabakh became the flashpoint for tensions between the
two peoples last year, when the Armenians, who are generally
Christian and make up three-quarters of the region's 162,000
inhabitants, began demanding that their homeland be transferred
from the rule of largely Moslem Azerbaijan and annexed by Armenia.
   After more than 90 people died in unrest there, the region was
placed under special administrative control by Moscow, but
Armenians consider the ``current government has not justified
itself, everything it does goes against the will of Armenian
Karabakh residents,'' said Popoyan.
   Speakers at the meeting described how more and more Azerbaijanis
were being settled in Nagorno-Karabakh, threatening the Armenian
majority and its claim to the region, Popoyan said.
   He said beginning Friday, meetings will be held at Armenian
workplaces to pass resolutions demanding the parliamentary session
and threatening a strike if it is not held.
   Meanwhile, in the neighboring Caucasus republic of Georgia,
small groups circulated through the capital of Tbilisi carrying
signs demanding the release of Georgian political prisoners, an
activist said.
   Manana Gamsakhurdia, wife of jailed political dissident Zviad
Gamsakhurdia, said three of the protesters were detained and one
remained in jail Thursday night.
   They were calling for the release of six activists arrested in
connection with ethnic unrest April 9 that left 20 dead.
   Zviad Gamsakhurdia, who was among those arrested after the clash
between Soviet troops and pro-independence protesters, is in poor
health, but officials have not let him move from his cell to the
prison infirmary, Manana Gamsakhurdia said in a telephone interview.
   She also said strikes were spreading in the Georgian region of
Abkhazia, where Abkhazians, although a minority in their own
region, have begun demanding secession from Georgia.
   Many Georgian residents of Abkhazia have gone on strike to
protest the Abkhazian demkands, she said.

<HEAD>Study Says Renewable Energy Supplies To Double By 2000</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Renewable energy sources, such as hydro and
solar power, could provide as much as 80 percent of the nation's
energy needs by the year 2010 if federal aid were accelerated, an
environmental group said in a study published Thursday.
   ``Renewable energy technologies offer one of the most promising
components of any strategy to mitigate the trend toward climate
change ...,'' the study said.
   Public Citizen, the study's sponsor, said the potential for
renewable energy can only be reached if the Energy Department
spends substantially more on research and development.
   The group, which strongly advocates reduced reliance on nuclear
power and fossil fuels that are linked to the trend toward global
climate warming, said the Energy Department budget for renewables
should be restored to the 1985 level of $263 million. The current
budget provides $115.6 million, and the Bush administration has
proposed cutting that to $86.5 million in the next fiscal year.
   Renewable energy sources currently supply about 8 percent of
total U.S. energy needs, including imports of electricity generated
from Canadian hydro plants, the study said. The figure could rise
to 19 percent by the year 2000, and to as high as 80 percent by
2010 if prices for conventional energy sources go up, it said.

<TEXT>
   U.S. health officials Thursday advised American
travelers to Quebec to make sure their measles shots are up to date
following a measles outbreak in there.
   More than 1,600 cases of measles have been reported in Quebec
since late December, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control said.
Five hundred cases have occurred in the metropolitan Montreal area.
   Two-thirds of the Montreal cases occurred in school-age
children; Quebec, unlike most locations in the United States, does
not require measles vaccinations for pupils.
   The CDC recommends that all people 15 months and older who were
born after 1956 should receive measles vaccinations. In addition,
travelers abroad in that age group should receive a booster shot
unless there is a medical reason why they shouldn't.
   ``All persons planning to travel to Quebec or to other areas
with ongoing measles activity, including those (measles-prone)
areas within the United States, should ensure that their measles
vaccination status is adequate,'' the Atlanta-based CDC said in its
weekly report.

   Sales of U.S. Savings Bonds fell 11.1 percent

   The Treasury Department said sales in April were off $79 million

was only the second in the first seven months of the government's
fiscal year, which began Oct. 1.
   On May 1, the government increased the rate on the bonds to 7.81

months. The new rate will be effective through Oct. 31.
   As of April 30, the total value of savings bonds held by
Americans was $112.69 billion, a record high and up 7 percent from

   Syrian gunners lobbed shells at two
Christian harbors Thursday, killing at least two people hours after
Arab League envoys called a new cease-fire to halt two months of
fierce artillery battles.
   Police said at least three rockets hit two adjacent apartments
in Bkirki, a mile southeast of the port of Jounieh, killing two
people, including a 10-year-old girl.
   A police spokesman said on condition of anonymity that eight
people were wounded, all relatives of Maronite Catholic Patriarch
Nasrallah Sfeir.
   The casualties raised the toll to 359 people killed and 1,393
wounded in the two-month battle, the latest round of fighting in
Lebanon's 14-year-old civil war. Nearly all the casualties have
been civilians.
   Police reported 20 people killed and 62 wounded by rockets,
howitzer shells and mortar fire before the truce deadline Thursday
afternoon.
   Also Thursday, rockets fired from multi-barreled launchers in
Syrian-policed west Beirut fell on Jounieh and Byblos, another port
in the Christian enclave north of the capital. No casualties were
reported.
   In another development, a statement purportedly signed by an
Iranian-backed extremist group believed to hold two American
hostages warned against the deployment of Arab observers to monitor
the latest cease-fire.
   The typewritten Arabic-language statement, signed by the Islamic
Jihad, was delivered to a western news agency in Moslem west
Beirut. There was no authenticating picture of Terry Anderson or
Thomas Sutherland, who are held by the group.
   Islamic Jihad repeatedly has said that statements attributed to
it are not genuine unless accompanied by a hostage picture or
videotape.
   Anderson, 41, the chief Middle East correspondent for The
Associated Press, was abducted March 16, 1985. He is the longest
held of the 16 foreigners missing and believed held hostage in
Lebanon.
   Sutherland, 57, acting dean of agriculture at the American
University of Beirut, was abducted June 9, 1985.
   The statement warned against the deployment of Arab observers
but did not mention any demands.
   Earlier, Lakhdar Ibrahimi, the Arab League assistant
secretary-general, told reporters the warring Christian and Moslem
factions had agreed on a truce set for 2:30 p.m.
   The league's four previous calls for a halt to the shelling had
little effect on the battle between Gen. Michel Aoun's Christian
army units and a Moslem alliance of Syrian troops and Druse
militiamen.
   Ibrahimi, an Algerian, and Abdel-Aziz Al-Jassem, a Kuwaiti
diplomat, have been trying to revive an April 28 cease-fire that
collapsed after only a few days.
   After meeting with acting Premier Salim Hoss, Ibrahimi said the
first objective is ``normalizing the situation in Lebanon'' so the
Arab League committee can try to end the civil war.
   Hoss has led a Moslem cabinet and Aoun a competing Christian
government since a political crisis in September. The army also
split, with Aoun leading the 20,000 Christians and Maj. Gen. Sami
Khatib taking command of the 22,000 Moslems.
   The Arab League team met with Aoun at the shell-scarred
presidential place in suburban Baabda, east of Beirut.
   A military spokesman at Aoun's headquarters said Syrian gunners
fired ``126 shells, most of them 240mm mortars, into the palace
before the Arab envoys' arrival.''
   Aoun, 53, lives in the palace bunker with his wife, Nadia, and
three daughters.
   On Wednesday, the delegation met in Damascus with Foreign
Minister Farouk Sharaa of Syria, which has 40,000 soldiers in
Lebanon under a 1976 peacekeeping mandate from the Arab League and
is the country's main power broker.
   Aoun imposed a naval blockade March 6 on three illegal ports
operated by Moslem militias south of Beirut, and Walid Jumblatt's
Druse militia responded with artillery fire two days later.
   Syrian forces soon joined Jumblatt. Khatib's army troopers
helped seal off the 310-square mile Christian enclave and Aoun
declared a ``war of liberation'' to force Syria out of Lebanon.
   The government crisis began when the six-year term of President
Amin Gemayel expired in September and Parliament could not agree on
a successor. Gemayel appointed Aoun, the army commander, and
Moslems swore allegiance to Hoss, the incumbent premier.
   By unwritten agreement since independence from France in 1943,
the president is Christian, the premier Sunni Moslem and the
parliament speaker Shiite Moslem.

<HEAD>Import Assault Rifle Ban May Become Permanent</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush is considering stiffer
gun-control measures including a permanent ban on some
semi-automatic assault weapons for an anti-crime package to be
announced soon, administration sources said Thursday.
   The options being considered include making permanent the
temporary import ban on a variety of semi-automatic assault rifles
that was imposed in March and increasing criminal penalties for
illegal use of firearms, according to one of two sources, who both
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The administration is also studying increased penalties for the
illegal possession of semi-automatic weapons and their use in the
commission of crimes, according to another source.
   The proposals are in the final stages of review by White House
domestic policy chief Roger Porter. The anti-crime legislative
package is expected to be unveiled Monday by the president.
   Under consideration is a proposal that would bar people
sentenced to at least six months in jail for misdeanors from
purchasing guns, said the second source. Federal law currently bans
convicted felons from owning guns.
   Another measure under consideration is a proposal to link gun
dealers to a federal registry to determine if weapons purchasers
are convicted criminals, the second source said.
   Public concern about the use of military-style assault weapons,
such as the AK-47 used by a gunman to kill five children in a
Stockton, Calif. schoolyard last January, has prompted the
administration review of gun-control policies.
   In March, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms imposed a
temporary import ban on a variety of foreign-made semi-automatic
assault weapons while the agency determines if any of them are
being used for legitimate sporting purposes.
   Federal law prevents the importation of such weapons unless they
are used for target shooting or hunting.
   One of the options under consideration is a plan to permanently
ban 15 foreign and domestic-made military-style assault weapons,
the source said.

<TEXT>
   U.S. drug agents investigating Panamanian leader
Manuel Antonio Noriega will be allowed to examine records of his
bank accounts, two high court judges ruled Thursday.
   Customs and Excise Department officials unexpectedly discovered
the accounts and private documents in October during a raid on the
offices of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International.
   A lower court judge had barred the Customs and Excise agency
from releasing information on Noriega's accounts to U.S.
authorities.
   The documents will not be turned over for at least two weeks,
allowing the judges to prepare a written opinion and giving the
bank an opportunity to appeal.
   The ruling involved ``statements, ledgers, returned checks,
credit slips, withdrawal slips, application forms'' and other
documents involving accounts held by Noriega, his wife, two
daughters and a son-in-law.
   Andrews Collins, an attorney for Customs and Excise, had argued
the ban on turning over copies to U.S. agencies interfered with the
international fight against drug trafficking.
   Noriega was indicted in Florida on charges he took at least $4.6
million in payoffs from Colombia's Medellin drug cartel to protect
cocaine shipments, launder money, supply drug laboratories and
shelter the gang's leaders from law enforcement.
   A separate indictment in February 1988 accused Noriega of
conspiracy to import, distribute and attempt to import more than 1
million pounds of marijuana.
   Noriega, chief of the Defense Forces and Panama's de facto
ruler, denies the drug charges.

<DATELINE>ROCKFORD, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman facing a manslaughter charge in
her baby's cocaine-related death says the case worsened the pain of
the ``worst time of my life.''
   Melanie Green's 2-day-old baby, Bianca, died Feb. 4. Authorities
blamed the death on prenatal brain damage caused by cocaine use
during pregnancy and charged the mother with involuntary
manslaughter and delivering a controlled substance to a minor.
   ``I loved her, I did,'' Ms. Green told the Chicago Tribune.
   Ms. Green, who had been without legal counsel, accepted an offer
of free representation from the American Civil Liberties Union,
ACLU spokeswoman Gwen Osborne said Thursday in Chicago.
   Winnebago County State's Attorney Paul Logli says he filed the
charges in an effort to protect children. But some legal,
public-health and medical officials say fear of prosecution could
prevent drug-abusing mothers-to-be from seeking help for themselves
and their fetuses.
   Ms. Green, 24, refused to discuss the allegations that her drug
abuse was responsible for her daughter's death. But her position on
what government officials should do in such cases was clear in the
interview Wednesday.
   ``They should help people,'' Ms. Green said. ``I tried to get
help, but I didn't get any.''
   She does not have a telephone and could not be reached to
elaborate, but her ACLU attorney, Colleen Connell, said most
drug-abuse treatment programs will not accept pregnant women.
   ``This prosecution represents an unprecedented intrusion on a
woman's constitutionally protected rights of privacy,'' Ms. Connell
said.
   Ms. Green was arrested Monday, more than three months after
Bianca's death, as she waited for her 6-year-old son, Damen, to
come home from school. She was freed on $3,500 bail Tuesday and
faces a May 31 court hearing.
   Ms. Green said she was with Bianca at Rockford Memorial Hospital
when the child died.
   ``It was the worst time of my life,'' she said, ``and this is
even worse.''
   A conviction on the involuntary manslaughter charge is
punishable by two to five years in prison. Ms. Green could face a
maximum 14-year sentence on the drug charge, Logli said.

   President Bush on Thursday announced his
selection of Janet Dempsey Steiger, a longtime personal friend, to
be chairman of the Federal Trade Commission.
   He said he would nominate her to succeed Daniel Oliver, the
current chairman.
   Since 1987, Ms. Steiger has been chairman of the national
Commission on Veterans Educational Policy. She is also a past
chairman of the Postal Rate Commission.
   Ms. Steiger, 50, is the widow of the late Rep. Bill Steiger,
R-Wis., who died in 1978. The couple were close friends of the
Bushes when Bush served in the House in the late 1960s, and Bush is
the godfather of their son, Bill, Jr.
   Bush said he would nominate her to a seven-year term. If
confirmed by the Senate, she will immediately be designated
chairman of the regulatory agency, according to a White House
statement.
   Bush also said he would nominate Deborah Kaye Owen, a Washington
attorney and former legal aide to then-President Reagan, to fill
another trade commission vacancy. She would succeed Margot E.
Machol.
   At the same time, Bush announced he will nominate James Franklin
Hill as assistant attorney general in charge of the Justice
Department's antitrust division.Hill, 56, is a Washington lawyer
who specializes in anti-trust advice.
   If confirmed by the Senate, he would succeed Charles F. Rule.
   The White House, in announcing Hill's selection, gave a list of
some of his major clients in his private practice. They include RJR
Tobacco, Safeway Stores, Inc.; Cyclops Corp., and the Detroit Auto
Dealers.
   Hill was chairman of the American Bar Association in 1987-88.

   Faced with his first crisis as president,

economic sanctions against the government of Panamanian leader
Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Bush warned of the consequences of failing to send a ``clear
signal'' to the ``enemies of constitutional rule'' in Panama and
elsewhere.
   But the seven points Bush outlined indicated that if Noriega is
to be overthrown, it will have to be primarily the work of
Panamanians and not Americans.
   The president obviously is hoping that other democratic nations
will close ranks against Noriega and that the Panamanian's
resulting isolation will encourage him to move on to other pursuits.
   Since Sunday's national election, a number of countries have
expressed varying degrees of indignation about the irregularities
reported by hundreds of international observers.
   These countries include Argentina, Guatemala, El Salvador, Peru,
Costa Rica, Spain, Great Britain, West Germany and Venezuela.
   And Venezuela is leading a campaign to have the Organization of
American States take a strong stand for democracy in Panama.
   If this fails to impress Noriega, he might still take note of
the most controversial step Bush announced _ the dispatch of 2,000
or more U.S. combat troops.
   Noriega may be concerned that the troops have a more aggressive
purpose in mind than the stated one of protecting American lives.
It is not unusual for a strong nation to try to achieve political
goals by projecting military power without actually using it.
   Bush backed away from a more pugnacious military response out of
concern that it could provoke anti-American uprisings in the
hemisphere. That approach might have succeeded in ousting Noriega
but the diplomatic costs would have been exorbitant.
   Slapping a trade embargo on Panama would have made the economy
there scream, but the impact would have been felt for years to come
_ long after Noriega's departure.
   So Bush is relying on rhetoric and diplomacy to weaken Noriega.
The State Department, after declaring that the opposition candidate
in Sunday's election, Guillermo Endara, won the election, is now
calling him ``president-elect.''
   It is a tactic aimed at robbing Noriega even further of any
claim to legitimacy.
   As for the diplomatic approach, the administration will be
lobbying hard over the next few days for a strong resolution at the
OAS foreign ministers meeting expected to start next Tuesday.
   Based on the regular OAS permanent council meeting on Wednesday,
the prospects are not bright.
   The U.S. representative, William Pryce, delivered a strong
attack on Noriega's perceived attempts to steal Sunday's election
but only three of the 30 other hemispheric countries joined in the
criticism _ Venezuela, Peru and El Salvador.
   But Bush indicated that his bag of anti-Noriega reprisals was
not exhausted in Thursday's speech. ``We do not rule out,'' he
said, ``further steps in the future.''

   Army troops fatally shot two Palestinian
teen-agers Thursday, Arab reports said, and hundreds of Israelis
screaming ``Death to the Arabs!'' stoned Arab-owned cars in a
protest over the slaying of a soldier.
   Palestinians staged a general strike in the occupied territories
to mourn the 471 Arabs killed in the 17-month uprising against
Israeli rule. Twenty-one Israelis also have been killed.
   In Bethlehem, activists blocked roads with rocks, hung outlawed
Palestinian flags from electricity poles, and covered walls with
graffiti saying ``No to Shamir's Elections!''
   Government officials said Israel's coalition government remains
split on party lines about how to conduct elections in the occupied
West Bank and Gaza Strip, despite U.S. pressure for a detailed
proposal.
   In southern Israel, hundreds of people waving anti-Arab banners
and Israeli flags marched near the port city of Ashkelon to protest
the slaying of an army sergeant and the disappearance of a second
soldier.
   Demonstrators stoned several Arab-owned cars, and at one point
menaced two terrified Arab pedestrians who were rescued by police.
   ``We're going to liberate Ashdod and Ashkelon. No Arab will work
here!'' one woman in the crowd yelled, referring to the coastal
cities just north of the Gaza Strip.
   Both soldiers disappeared in the area, and authorities blame
Arabs. The slain soldier's body was found last week after he was
missing almost three months, and the other soldier dissapeared last
week.
   The incidents have sparked anti-Arab outbursts and demands for
tougher measures to crush the Palestinian rebellion.
   In Ashdod, police detained three Israelis for attacking a store
owner who employed Palestinians, Israel radio said.
   Ashdod Mayor Zvi Zilker said the municipality barred 21 Gaza
merchants from working at an outdoor market Thursday for fear that
their presence would spark anti-Arab riots.
   He said the town council will meet Sunday to discuss measures to
reduce the number of Arabs working in Ashdod. Gazans make up 5
percent of the work force in Ashdod and are primarily employed in
low-paying industries and as gardners and street cleaners.
   On Thursday, Transport Minister Moshe Katsav of the right-wing
Likud bloc demanded that troops seal off the West Bank and Gaza
Strip for three months, barring Arabs from entering Israel and
journalists from covering the uprising.
   The free movement of Palestinians ``has become dangerous. They
have kidnapped soldiers and murdered soldiers,'' Katsav said on
Israel army radio.
   A Defense Ministry spokesman refused to comment on the proposal.
   In the Gaza Strip town of Sheikh Radwan, troops shot and killed
an Arab teen-ager in a clash with stone-throwers, Arab reporters
said.
   Arab hospital officials identified the youth as Khalid Jadallah
Jadallah, 17.
   In the West Bank town of Hebron, troops fired at stone-throwers,
fatally shooting 17-year-old Salmi Ibrahim Abu Kaff in the chest,
the army said.
   Arab hospital sources reported 16 Palestinians wounded by army
gunfire, including 12 in the Gaza Strip where troops enforced a
curfew confining 700,000 Palestinians to their homes for a fourth
day.
   The army said it was checking the casualty reports.
   In Jerusalem, police arrested a squad of PLO activists for
planting bombs in Jewish Sabbath bread last October. The bombs
wounded three girls.
   Maariv newspaper quoted senior government officials as saying
that once the Cabinet approves an election plan, Israel will
prepare to hold the balloting even if Palestinians don't agree.
   ``Preparations for elections and the decision on who will be
entitled to vote and run will be assigned to the office of the
coordinator of activities in the territories,'' Maariv said.
   ``The military government will constitute the source of
authority for autonomy, and will issue a special order for this
purpose,'' it said.
   Israel and the United States back elections, and government
officials Thursday said U.S. Secretary of State James Baker III
wrote to Shamir and other Cabinet ministers asking for detailed
plans on the proposed vote.
   Among points he raised were international supervision of
balloting and the participation of 140,000 Palestinians from
Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem. Shamir's Likud bloc is opposed to
the east Jerusalemites voting, while its left-leaning coalition
partner, the Labor Party, is in favor.
   The Palestine Liberation Organization and leading Palestinians
in the occupied lands say they will accept elections only as part
of a comprehensive peace plan, including an Israeli commitment to
exchange land for peace.

   Saturday marks the fourth anniversary of the
confrontation between the MOVE group and city officials that ended
with an airborne police bomb that incinerated an entire block and
killed 11 people.
   Officialdom has spent four years trying to sort out what went
wrong. About two dozen lawsuits have been filed against the city
and its four top officials at the time of the disaster.
   The city already has paid about $2 million in claims to
neighborhood residents for damages to their property. Mayor W.
Wilson Goode appointed a blue-ribbon investigating commission to
report on the man-made disaster.
   It accused the mayor of gross negligence in his handling of
MOVE, a radical group, and called for grand jury indictments in the
deaths of the five children. Two grand juries investigated but no
one was indicted.
   On Friday, attorney Charles Bowser will publish ``Let The Bunker
Burn: The Final Battle With MOVE,'' a 150-page book which contends
the people in the house were executed by their local government and
it could happen again.
   ``I had to write this book,'' said Bowser, who served on a
special city commission investigating the disaster. He believes
someone should have been indicted for what happened.
   ``We think there is a deliberate effort to sweep it under the
rug,'' said William Meek of the MOVE Committee, a group sponsoring
a memorial service and seminars this weekend on the May, 13, 1985,
disaster.
   ``Many people in the city would like to forget that it happened
_ they'd like to pretend that it didn't happen,'' Meek said. ``But
it did happen, and it was our government that did it, not some
government far away.''
   Last December, Meek said, his committee mailed questionnaires to
70 local, state and federal legislators from the Philadelphia area,
asking pointed questions about MOVE and its aftermath.
   They got three responses.
   ``I was surprised not to hear from a lot of people,'' he said.
``A veil of silence has been put over this.''
   The 1985 confrontation began when police evacuated the block in
West Philadelphia, seeking to arrest some members of the radical
group at their rowhouse fortress and to evict the others.
   Police had clashed with MOVE in August 1978, when one police
officer died and three police officers and five firefighters were
wounded.
   When police ordered the 1985 eviction, the adult MOVE members
refused to come out and kept their children with them, cursing the
police through bullhorns and promising to fight them.
   A state police helicopter finally dropped a satchel on the roof
that contained a crudely rigged plastic explosive device. It
started the fire that went out of control, destroying the MOVE
house and 60 other homes on the block.

<HEAD>Senate Names Panel for Judge Nixon Impeachment Trial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senate leaders named 12 lawmakers Thursday to
a panel that will hear evidence in the impeachment trial of U.S.
District Judge Walter L. Nixon of Mississippi, currently serving a
five-year perjury term.
   The committee was named after House Judiciary Committee Chairman
Jack Brooks, D-Texas, came to the Senate and formally notified
lawmakers the House impeached Nixon on Wednesday on grounds he lied
to a federal grand jury.
   Standing before the Senate, Brooks read the three articles of
impeachment approved 417-0 and declared the House ``demands his
conviction and appropriate judgment thereon.'' The lawmakers then
voted to summon Nixon, now imprisoned at Eglin Air Force Base in
Florida, to answer the charges.
   He faces a trial in the Senate that will decide whether he
should be ousted from the bench and deprived of the $89,500 annual
salary that he still collects as a federal judge. He becomes
eligible for parole in November and has indicated a desire to
return to his courtroom and resume hearing trials.
   Appointed to the evidence-hearing committee were Sens. Wyche
Fowler, D-Ga.; Howell Heflin, D-Ala.; Timothy E. Wirth, D-Colo.;
Harry Reid, D-Nev.; Charles Robb, D-Va.; Herbert H. Kohl, D-Wis.;
Orrin Hatch, R-Utah; John C. Danforth, R-Mo.; John H. Chafee,
R-R.I.; Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska; James M. Jeffords, R-Vt.; and
Connie Mack, R-Fla.
   The panel plans to meet Tuesday to get organized.
   The evidence committee is similar to one preparing to hear
evidence against federal District Judge Alcee L. Hastings of
Florida, who stands accused of conspiring to get a $150,000 bribe
from two defendants.
   He was acquitted in 1983, but the House impeached him last year.
Lawmakers said there was ample evidence he took part in the plot,
lied at his trial and, in an unrelated matter, improperly disclosed
wiretap information.
   U.S. District Judge Harry Claiborne of Nevada was impeached by
the House in 1986 while serving a tax evasion sentence. The Senate
removed him from the bench.
   A jury convicted Nixon of perjury for denying in 1984 before
both a federal grand jury and Justice Department investigators that
he intervened in a narcotics case involving the son of Hattiesburg,
Miss., business executive Wiley Fairchild.
   Fairchild helped Nixon obtain a lucrative oil and gas investment
and investigators say the judge talked with a prosecutor about the
drug case.

<HEAD>Gumbel Reads Top-10 List: This Must Be for Real</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   ``Today'' co-host Bryant Gumbel, showing a bit
of trepidation, made his first appearance Thursday on the turf of
late-night talk-show host David Letterman since the two began
feuding four years ago.
   Gumbel's unannounced visit to NBC's ``Late Night with David
Letterman'' came at the top of the show as Letterman was reading
the night's customary top-10 list _ this one of questions asked
prospective NBC employees.
   Number 7 in the countdown list was, ``Any problem car-pooling
with Bryant?'' Number 4 was, ``Want to join squad doing inventory
of Bryant Gumbel's suits?'' whereupon bandleader Paul Shaffer
complained that Letterman should lay off Gumbel, because ``he might
get mad.''
   Letterman said he would prove Gumbel could take a joke, went to
a studio door and brought Gumbel into the studio _ after Gumbel
hesitated and pointed at the floor: ``This studio?'' he said. ``Is
this the line of doubt?''
   Gumbel read the rest of the list, including No. 2, ``You
wouldn't leak a guy's memo, would you?'' a reference to the
now-infamous memo Gumbel wrote to the ``Today'' producer
complaining about most of his colleagues on the show.
   Letterman noted how long it had been since Gumbel had been on
the show. ``What, did you change your phone?'' he asked.
   ``I get lost,'' said Gumbel.
   The two shook hands and Gumbel left. ``I told you he wasn't
upset,'' Letterman told Shaffer.
   ``You two are the Jagger-Richards of television,'' observed
Shaffer, referring to the rocky relationship of ex-Rolling Stones
Mick Jagger and Keith Richards.
   The Gumbel-Letterman patchup apparently is genuine. A spokesman
for the show said during an afternoon run-through, the two tossed a
football and were ``very amiable.''
   Their feud began when Letterman interrupted a live, prime-time
``Today'' special by shouting from a window. Gumbel said the stunt
was unprofessional.
   Letterman said Gumbel had no sense of humor, and besides, he had
the ``Today'' producer's permission for the practical joke.

   A government report issued Thursday said that
despite 69 hospital closings in 1987, most of those facilities were
small and few communities were affected because other medical care
was available nearby.
   The report by the inspector general at the Department of Health
and Human Services, its first on hospital closings, paints a less
alarming picture of the situation than is seen by many on Capitol
Hill and in the industry.
   They say the health care of many Americans, particularly those
in rural areas, will be threatened as more hospitals close their
doors due to financial pressures, including proposed cuts in
Medicare reimbursements.
   The report, however, said the ``hospitals that closed in 1987
were small and had low occupancy rates. When the hospitals closed,
few patients were affected. Most could get medical care nearby.''
   According to the inspector general, 69 general, acute care
hospitals closed in 27 states in 1987, while 13 new hospitals
opened that year. Eight of the 69 that closed in 1987 reopened the
next year, the report said.
   The American Hospital Association, by contrast, said 79
community hospitals closed in 1987 and more than 400 have closed
since 1980. Industry experts project that several hundred more will
close in the next few years unless financial pressures are eased.
   The report made no projections and looked only at 1987.
   No single factor was responsible for the closings, the report
said. But the common elements include declining revenues due to
fewer admissions, cuts in insurance reimbursements and more
treatment of uninsured patients who cannot pay their bill. Other
factors include rising costs resulting from pressures to add new
medical technology and skilled personnel, the report said.
   The 1987 closings accounted for 1.3 percent of all hospitals
nationally, and one half of 1 percent of the general acute care
inpatient bed supply.
   About 54 percent, or 37, of the hospitals that closed were in
rural areas and 46 percent, or 32, of them were urban hospitals.
Also, the hospitals that closed had about the same Medicare and
Medicaid utilization rates as other hospitals.
   The report said that despite the closings, most of the affected
communities still had adequate emergency and inpatient medical
services available nearby.
   In 19 of the 37 communities where hospitals closed, residents
have to travel less than 10 miles for emergency care, and 29 less
than 20 miles. In seven communities the ride is up to 30 miles, and
it's 75 miles _ an hour by ambulance _ to the nearest emergency
services for residents in Mullen, Neb., but in all those areas,
ground or air ambulance services are available, the report said.
   All but one of the 32 urban areas where hospitals closed have
emergency care available within 10 miles. The exception is Wasco,
Calif., where residents have to travel 19 miles to Delano, the
report said.

<TEXT>
   Reye syndrome, a potentially fatal disease
associated with aspirin in childhood flu and chicken pox cases, has
reached the lowest reported level since its discovery _ just 20
U.S. cases last year, officials said Thursday.
   At its peak in 1980, Reye syndrome struck 555 people. The
disease struck 101 Americans in 1986 _ the year in which aspirin
containers were first required to carry warnings about it.
   Since then, Reye syndrome reporting dropped to 36 cases in 1987
and 20 in 1988, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control reported.
   Reye syndrome, first observed in the 1950s, causes symptoms
including severe vomiting and lethargy, and can result in coma and
even death. It usually occurs in children and is usually preceded
by a bout with a viral illness such as influenza or chicken pox.
   Researchers have documented a link between the use of aspirin by
young patients during chicken pox or flu and the subsequent
development of Reye syndrome.
   ``The decline in the number of RS cases since late 1980
coincides with the increased publicity about this association,''
the Atlanta-based CDC said.
   ``That is the reason,'' concluded Dr. Larry Schonberger, a CDC
researcher. ``Study after study shows aspirin is the primary cause
of Reye syndrome. ... CDC's been pushing this since 1980.''
   The 1988 count is the lowest since national surveillance of Reye
cases began in 1976, the CDC said.
   Nine of the 20 reported Reye syndrome patients in 1988 had
suffered respiratory illness such as flu before the onset of Reye;
four had chicken pox. The previous year, 18 of the 36 patients had
respiratory illnesses, and seven had chicken pox.
   In 1988, as in 1987, most cases occurred in January, February or
March, the peak months for flu or chicken pox cases.

   Rhunetta Crumel is one person who thinks Avon
Products Inc. should not be fighting so hard against Amway Corp.'s
offer to buy it for more than $2 billion.
   Opportunity is knocking for Avon, says Mrs. Crumel, who has
reason to know: She is both an Avon representative and an Amway
distributor.
   The takeover battle between the two giants of direct sales will
directly affect nearly 3 million people worldwide, roughly 1.5
million representing Avon and more than 1 million from Amway.
   Avon's stock fell 37{ cents a share to $39.50, still slightly
above Amway's $39-a-share offering price, on the New York Stock
Exchange on Thursday. The spread indicated speculators were betting
a higher bid would emerge from Amway or another suitor.
   Avon is attempting to portray Amway as a maverick company that
has had numerous brushes with the law and sweeps up recruits to its
sales force through exploitative business evangelism.
   In a federal lawsuit this week, Avon said Amway has paid fines
of more than $20 million in connection with charges involving
customs duties and recruiting of distributors.
   Amway ``touts with religious fervor the development of a
multi-layered distribution scheme in which the people at the top of
the pyramid become wealthy through sales by those below them of any
and every product known to man,'' the lawsuit says.
   Not true, said Mrs. Crumel, of Berkeley Heights, N.J., who quit
her job at Exxon Corp. five years ago to devote more time to her
Amway distributorship. People who dislike Amway simply don't
understand it, she said.
   ``There are two things you can't penetrate. The first is
ignorance and the second is laziness,'' she said.
   Avon said its board would evaluate Amway's offer but noted that
the board has said previously that the company is not for sale.
   In the latest development, Amway said Thursday that if it
acquired Avon it would sell off Avon's higher-priced retail-store
fragrance lines, stripping the company down to the manufacture and
direct sales of perfumes, cosmetics, toiletries and household items.
   Avon had no response to the statement, made in a Securities and
Exchange Commission filing.
   ``They would be beautiful together,'' Mrs. Crumel said in a
phone interview from her northern New Jersey home after Amway made
its takeover offer Wednesday.
   Mrs. Crumel thinks Amway distributors would benefit by adding
Avon to their product line, while Avon could learn from Amway's
rah-rah approach to recruiting and caring for its distributors.
   Amway is no pyramid as Avon charges, Mrs. Crumel said.
   Although recruiters get a percentage of their recruits' sales,
the recruits can easily end up making more money than the
recruiters, she said.
   Mrs. Crumel said big-ticket items and the bonus structure make
it easier to make money as an Amway distributor. And she said Amway
takes care of its people better.
   Avon treated its representatives as ``stepchildren'' while it
went on an ill-fated diversification drive, William Nicholson,
Amway's chief operating officer, said in an interview.
   In fact, Avon lost more than $400 million last year from the
expense of retrenching by selling most of its health care
businesses to focus on its core businesses of beauty and direct
sales.
   Kathryn Gaume, a Berkeley Heights resident who sells only Avon,
said she knows little about Amway and is not sure she likes what
she has heard.
   No problem, said Mrs. Crumel.
   ``For the people who are willing to hang around and learn what
Amway is all about, I think they'd be very happy.''

<HEAD>Bush To Announce Negotiations For Waiving Trade Limits On Soviets</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President George Bush is poised to announce he
will negotiate with Congress for lifting restrictions on trade with
the Soviet Union if the Kremlin reforms its emigration policies,
administration sources said Thursday.
   Bush will make his announcement at a speech Friday at Texas A&amp;M
University, said the sources, who spoke only on condition they not
be identified.
   Bush is expected to announce he is asking Congress to waive a
1974 law which links trade concessions for Communist countries with
emigration performance, the sources said. The waiver will be
granted if the Soviets fulfill their promise to codify new
emigration laws and ``faithfully implement'' them, the sources said.
   His planned announcement follows the first round of talks
between the administration and Moscow, conducted this week by
Secretary of State James A. Baker III.
   Baker left Moscow with a list of Jewish refuseniks who are being
allowed to emigrate after years of waiting, part of a surge of Jews
and other minorities being let out under the liberalized policies
of Mikhail Gorbachev.
   Last month, 4,557 Jews left, the highest monthly figure since
October of 1979, the year emigration reached an annual high of
51,320. As many as 70,000 Soviets are expected to be allowed out
this year.
   The 1974 law withholds credit guarantees and import duty
reductions from Communist countries which prevent emigration.
   Only China and Hungary have been granted a waiver and been
accorded ``most favored nation'' status, which gives them lower
import duties when they sell goods to the United States.
   The Soviets have promised that under new laws, strict definition
would be given to eligibility for emigration. Specifically, the new
laws would limit the number of years that have to elapse before a
person with knowledge of state secrets is allowed to leave. Soviet
authorities have used the provision of their existing law to ban
some Jews from leaving for life.
   Former Democratic Rep. Charles Vanik, who co-authored the 1974
law, recently called on Bush and Congress to waive the restriction
for one year to encourage further improvements in human rights
under Gorbachev.
   Vanik's plea has been endorsed by several American Jewish groups
who used to be at the forefront of restricting trade with the
Soviets. Formal approval of the waiver by Jewish groups would
ensure support for such a move in Congress.

<TEXT>
   Grumpy the lawn dwarf is home safe after
a five-week whirlwind tour of the country, but his owners have no
idea who treated the snarling statue to a vacation.
   Grumpy, a 20-inch, 80-pound concrete statue of the character in
the Walt Disney movie classic, ``Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,''
disappeared from Carol and Gene Horne's porch March 16 while the
couple was out.
   ``When we came back, I couldn't set my finger on it, but I felt
something was missing,'' Carol Horne said. ``The next morning my
daughter said, `Mom, there's somebody missing.'''
   Bashful, Doc, Sneezy, Happy, Sleepy, Dopey and the 400-pound
Snow White were untouched. Grumpy was gone.
   On April 26, a freshly-scrubbed Grumpy returned. The sign
dangling from his shoulders said, ``I'm home.''
   An accompanying envelope contained 35 photographs from his
journey, many of them with captions on the back.
   Grumpy's travels included visits to Yankee Stadium, Colorado,
North and South Carolina, St. Louis and Texas.
   There were snapshots of Grumpy ogling bikini-clad women from a
Florida sand dune, Grumpy standing in front of the Lincoln Memorial
in Washington, D.C., Grumpy dining at a McDonald's restaurant.
   ``My husband and I, we were laughing so hard at these pictures,
my husband was late for work,'' Horne said.
   She said neither she nor the police know who took Grumpy. She
theorizes that ``it's someone with an engineering background. The
printing on the back of the pictures is very similar to the type
you see on blueprints.''
   Horne said Grumpy had vanished before, turning up once in front
of a local Dairy Queen and in the back seat of a restaurant
manager's car.
   ``She saw somebody looking over her shoulder and started
screaming. He was just standing there with his arms folded and that
snarl on his face,'' Horne said.
   But alas, all good things must end. Horne said she plans to have
all the dwarfs cemented in place.
   Nevertheless, she admits to envying Grumpy's wandering ways.
   ``He gets to go everywhere. I never get to go anywhere.''

<HEAD>Iowa Going To Sea Without Repairs</HEAD>

   The battleship Iowa, on which 47 sailors died
last month in a gun turret explosion, will proceed with its next
regular deployment this summer without undergoing repairs, the Navy
said Thursday.
   But a decision has been made to fix the damage after it returns,
a spokesman added.
   The service, in a brief statement, said the battleship will be
departing in June on a scheduled deployment to the Mediterranean
Sea along with a number of other warships.
   ``The ship is fully operational except for the No. 2 gun turret,
and had already been scheduled to go to the Norfolk, Va., Naval
Shipyard for post-deployment repairs'' after returning from the
Mediterranean, the Navy said.
   Since it will take several months to obtain all the necessary
repair parts, ``turret No. 2 will not be repaired prior to
deployment.''
   ``But it is now the Navy's intention to repair the turret,''
said Lt. Cmdr. Jim Kudla, a spokesman.
   ``The engineering survey team indicates the damage to the ship
was contained in turret No. 2, and all other systems on the ship _
including the engineering plant _ are in excellent condition and
fully capable of supporting the upcoming deployment,'' the Navy
concluded. ``The Iowa remains one of the most powerful and durable
ships afloat.''
   The Navy and Pentagon announced last week the damage to the huge
battleship could be repaired for an estimated $15 million to $20
million. At the time, however, officials declined to say with
certainty the turret would be fixed and if so, when.
   There had been some doubt about repairs because of the vessel's
age. The Iowa was commissioned in 1943 during World War II and no
vessel of its type has been built since that war.
   Forty-seven sailors died on April 19 inside the No. 2 gun turret
while loading a 16-inch gun with powder.
   The huge battleship still has two other turrets, each with three
16-inch guns.

<HEAD>Superpowers Agree to Cooperate to Fight Oil Spills</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Baker-Soviets, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States and Soviet Union agreed Thursday
to cooperate in pollution emergencies in northern waters, like the
oil spill that has fouled Alaska's coastline.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze signed the accord on the last day
of Baker's two-day visit to Moscow. It pledges superpower
cooperation in combating spills of oil and other pollutants in the
Bering and Chukchi seas between Alaska and Siberia.
   The news agency Tass said the agreement provides for the
development of a ``joint plan of drastic measures'' by the
superpowers in the event of a spill. Each country is required to
notify the other immediately of a pollution emergency, and U.S. and
Soviet officials will hold joint exercises on how to fight ocean
pollution, Tass said.
   ``The signing of the agreement is a major step toward developing
Soviet-American cooperation in dealing with the consequences of
ecological disaster at sea,'' Oleg Khalimonov, an official in the
Soviet Merchant Marine Ministry, told Tass.
   Khalimonov was quoted as saying the cooperation ``will allow
specialists to define within hours the scope of an accident, map
out joint measures to overcome its consequences and get down
immediately to their implementation. Earlier, such procedures took
days and sometimes whole weeks.''
   Tass said the cooperation envisaged by the agreement began to
function even before Baker and Shevardnadze signed the formal
document. A Soviet ship designed to skim the surface of the sea was
hired to help clean up the oil spilled by the Exxon Valdez tanker,
which ran aground in Prince William Sound on March 24.
   But Exxon officials, who were paying the Soviets $15,000 a day
for the aid furnished by the Vaidagubsky, said Tuesday the ship was
being sent home because it was not designed to handle the hardened,
taffy-like mass the spilled oil has created.

<HEAD>Northeast, Plains, Texas Receive Rain</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Rain fell in the Plains and especially in Maine on Thursday, and
Florida had both a record high temperature and a record low for the
date.
   Thunderstorms developed ahead of a cold front crossing New
Mexico, producing showers and thunderstorms in west-central Texas
and the possibility of tornadoes in parts of New Mexico, Texas and
Colorado.
   Rain showers fell across the Northeast from the upper Ohio
Valley to New England. Flood watches continued for parts of western
New York state, and were issued for New Hampshire and western Maine.
   Wet snow fell over some of the higher elevations of western New
York state. Franklinville, N.Y., reported an inch of snow on the
ground early Thursday morning.
   Much of the northern and central Plains had cloudy skies, and
scattered showers soaked parts of northern Oklahoma, central Kansas
and southeastern Nebraska.
   Rainfall totals for the six hours up to 2 p.m. EDT included
nearly an inch at Portland and New Brunswick, Maine, two-thirds of
an inch at Bangor, Maine, and six-tenths of an inch at Brownsville,
Texas.
   Clouds and rain kept temperatures in the 40s and 50s in much of
the Northeast, while 80s and lower 90s heated up southern Florida
and southern Texas. Miami had a record high of 93 degrees.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 37
degrees at Jamestown, N.Y., to 92 degrees at Miami. The nation's
low Thursday morning was a record 25 degrees at Marquette, Mich.
   Other record low temperatures for the date included 51 at
Apalachicola, Fla., 42 at Birmingham, Ala., 44 at Huntsville, Ala.,
and 47 at Montgomery, Ala.
   Friday's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms scattered
across the northern Rockies, the high country to the west and much
of the Great Plains. Numerous showers also were predicted from the
Ohio Valley and the lower Great Lakes region across the middle and
northern Atlantic Coast states.
   Temperatures were forecast to remain below 70 degrees in much of
the West and from the Great Lakes region and northern Atlantic
Coast states to North Carolina and eastern Tennessee, with highs in
the 50s from Lower Michigan and the upper Ohio Valley into western
New England, and from northern Arizona to the northern Rockies.
Temperatures should warm into the 80s from southern New Mexico
through much of Texas and Louisiana to southern Florida.

<HEAD>UN Plans to Double Police Supervisory Force in Namibia</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar
plans to double the U.N. police force supervising Namibia's
transition to independence, the British ambassador said Thursday.
   At a briefing for the Security Council, Perez de Cuellar
``proposed to increase the number of (U.N.) police in Namibia'' to
1,000, Sir Crispin Tickell told reporters after the session.
Tickell is council president for May.
   The current authorized size of the police contingent of the U.N.
Transition Assistance Group in Namibia is 500.
   Tickell also said Perez de Cuellar plans to increase the
authority of Martti Ahtissari, his special representative in
Namibia, by giving the Finnish envoy an executive assistant.
   Namibia's local police force, trained by South Africa, is
responsible for law and order while the territory goes through a
one-year transition to independence under U.N. sponsorship.
   Perez de Cuellar originally recommended 500 U.N. supervisors,
but in early April the local police clashed with about 1,900
guerrillas who crossed the border from bases in Angola.
   The U.N. police and military observers in northern Namibia did
not have enough personnel to monitor the Namibian police and South
Africa soldiers, who left their bases to confront the guerrillas.
   South African troops are to return to their bases Saturday.
   In early November, Namibians will to vote for a assembly to
write a constitution for the territory, also called South-West
Africa.
   U.N. personnel in Namibia also include 4,650 peacekeeping
troops, more than 760 civilian administrators and more than 800
people hired locally. At least 600 monitors from several nations
are to be on hand for the elections.
   South Africa captured South-West Africa from Germany in World
War I and governed it under a League of Nations mandate abrogated
by the United Nations in 1966.
   In December, South Africa finally signed accords with Angola and
Cuba agreeing independence for Namibia if 50,000 Cuban troops
stationed in Angola were sent home by mid-1991.

<HEAD>Court: Republication Of No-Longer-True Story Wasn't Libelous</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FLIPPEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state Supreme Court, overturning a
$2 million jury verdict, ruled Thursday that the reprinting of a
newspaper article was not libelous even though the article was no
longer true when it was republished.
   The 1972 article by syndicated columnist Jack Anderson, which
reported that the president of a labor union was under federal
investigation, was distributed by a rival union during a 1975-1976
battle over which union would represent state workers in Cranston
and Newport.
   Although Kenneth T. Lyons, president of the National Association
of Government Employees, was under investigation for alleged mob
ties when Anderson's story originally was published, the
investigation ended a few months later with no charges brought
against Lyons.
   The jury concluded that Council 94 of the American Federation of
State, County and Municipal Employees had libeled Lyons and NAGE by
reprinting Anderson's article without showing that Lyons since had
been cleared.
   The jury assessed $2 million in compensatory and punitive
damages against the council and the parent union.
   Chief Justice Thomas F. Fay, who wrote the high court's
unanimous opinion, noted that both reprints included the date of
the original article in type ``larger than the text print.''
   ``Aside from the fact that the original article was dated and
accurate, the text referred to Richard Nixon as president of the
United States,'' Fay wrote. ``The majority of the original column
was devoted to a discussion of the upcoming 1972 presidential
election between Nixon and McGovern.
   ``These historical references indicate that the reprints
referred to prior events and not to matters occurring in 1975 and
1976,'' Fay wrote.
   The fact that the reprints were published during a ``heated
labor-election campaign (when) the important constitutional
concerns regarding free speech are greatest'' also weighed in the
court's finding that they were not libelous, Fay wrote.
   It was the second time the case had been before the state
Supreme Court. In 1986, after the original jury had rejected Lyons'
lawsuit, the justices overturned that verdict and ordered a new
trial.
   John R. Mahoney, Lyons' lawyer, said he was puzzled by the
apparently contradictory opinions. He said he had not decided
whether to seek review in the U.S. Supreme Court.
   Milton Stanzler, the attorney representing the AFSCME union,
said he believed the court overturned the first jury verdict
because the trial judge died in middle of the case.
   ``Frankly, the case should never have gone to the jury because
it was determined those articles were true as circulated,'' he said.

<HEAD>Ex-Officer Convicted in Courtroom Shooting Death of Wife</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A jury convicted an ex-police officer
of voluntary manslaughter Thursday in the shooting death of his
estranged wife, a district judge, in her judicial chambers.
   Clarence Ratliff also was convicted of two counts of assault
with intent to murder and one count of felonious assault, resulting
from a shootout with fellow officers as Judge Carol Irons stumbled
from her office on Oct. 19, 1988.
   The 12-member District Court jury, which began deliberations
Wednesday afternoon, also found him guilty of felony use of a
firearm. Judge Dennis Kolenda said sentencing would be in three to
four weeks.
   Ratliff's attorney, Grant Gruel, argued that his 53-year-old
client was very drunk and under such severe stress from his
impending divorce he did not have the mental capacity to
premeditate the killing.
   ``The only real choices in this case'' are a manslaughter
conviction or acquittal, Gruel had said.
   ``We're obviously pleased with the verdict,'' Gruel said
afterward. ``It was obvious the jury felt stronger about shooting
the police officers than shooting his wife.''
   Ratliff, a 21-year veteran of the Grand Rapids Police Department
who originally was charged with murder in Irons' death, showed
little emotion when the verdict was read.
   The manslaughter conviction carries a maximum penalty of 15
years in prison; the assault with intent charges, up to life
imprisonment; felonious assault, four years, and the firearms
charge, a mandatory two-year term.
   Prosecutor Mark Blumer said he was both gratified and surprised
by the verdicts.
   ``We're gratified that they (the jury) realized how serious the
attack on the police officers was _ it was an understandable
verdict,'' he said. ``The jury did the job they were called on to
do.''
   Blumer characterized Ratliff in closing arguments Wednesday as a
``predatory animal'' who stalked his wife before killing her.
   Gruel had contended Ratliff was upset because he had just found
out that Irons would not abide by the divorce settlement he
believed they had agreed upon. He also was upset by her alleged
affair with an old boyfriend, Gruel said.
   Gruel had testified that something snapped in Ratliff's mind
when Irons picked up her telephone and told a police dispatcher
across the lobby that Ratliff was holding a gun to her head.
   After she was shot, Irons ran out into the hallway, clutching
her bleeding throat and Ratliff followed her, firing another shot,
police said.
   Toxicologists have testified Ratliff's blood-alcohol level at
the time of the shooting was about 0.25 percent, more than twice
the legal limit for intoxication in Michigan.

<TEXT>
   Mob boss Nicodemo ``Little Nicky'' Scarfo
was sentenced Thursday to a maximum 55 years in federal prison and
fined $500,000 in a racketeering conspiracy that included 13
murders and attempted killings.
   He was described by the government as ``a remorseless and
profoundly evil man.''
   Scarfo, 59, and 16 other members of his Philadelphia-southern
New Jersey Mafia gang were convicted last November.
   The government said Scarfo ran the mob from his home in Atlantic
City, N.J., and was ``the leader of one of the most important and
powerful'' of 24 La Costra Nostra families in the country. As a
member of the Mafia's national commission, he ``became one of the
most powerful criminals in the United States,'' Prosecutor David
Fritchey said in court.
   ``The end of this mob family hasn't happened yet, but it is
severely crippled,'' he said.
   Scarfo stood impassively, declining to address the court, and
merely shrugged his shoulders when the sentence was handed down.
   Afterward, his lawyer, Robert Simone, told a reporter: ``Nicky
doesn't blame, or have ill will, toward the judge or the proscution
because what else were they to do with the false information they
got. His beef is against those who lied about him in the
courtroom,'' referring to mobsters who turned government informants.
   Earlier in the day, U.S. District Judge Franklin Van Antwerpen
sentenced Scarfo's nephew, Philip Leonetti of Margate, N.J., who
was identified as mob underboss, to the maximum 45 years. The judge
rejected a plea for probation after noting Leonetti was involved in
four murders, an attempted murder and 15 extortions.
   For the other defendants, sentences ranged from 3{ years to 45
years.
   Scarfo was found guilty of participating in eight murders, four
attempted murders, 17 extortions and two drug deals plus bookmaking
and loansharking. He was not accused in a ninth murder.
   The judge directed that Scarfo serve his racketeering sentence
after he completes a 14-year federal term he's now serving in a $1
million extortion attempt and a life sentence imposed by a
Pennsylvania judge last month in a murder case.
   ``He should never again be free to prey upon society,'' Fritchey
urged the judge before sentencing.

   More than 150 lawmakers urged President Bush
on Thursday to begin negotiations with the Soviet Union on the
phase-out of nuclear weapons tests as part of a treaty banning the
process by 1995.
   ``A test ban would prevent the Soviet Union from developing new
types of nuclear warheads or bombs that might threaten our future
security, such as so-called `third generation' nuclear weapons,''
the 142 House members and 23 senators said in a letter to Bush.
   The Bush administration has not yet indicated where it stands on
nuclear testing, although it is expected to continue the policy of
the Reagan administration, which opposed additional testing limits.
   The lawmakers said the Bush administration has an opportunity to
act and a ban ``would significantly advance our nation's
longstanding interest in preventing the proliferation of nuclear
weapons to other countries.''
   They noted that the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty comes up
for renewal in 1995.
   Among the recommendations included in the three-page letter was
allowing the United States and the Soviet Union a limited period of
time to conduct an agreed number of tests to check their arsenals,
progressively lower both the permitted size and number of nuclear
tests to limit testing of new types of nuclear warheads or bombs
and install a network of seismic monitoring stations in the United
States and Soviet Union to verify compliance with the limits.
   The final recommendation is a call for negotiating a formal
U.S.-Soviet comprehensive test ban treaty that could be signed by
all nations and will take effect from 1995 to 2000.

<HEAD>Environmentalists Stay Texas House Knuckled Under to Chemical Lobby</HEAD>

<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   State House members who voted to water down
the agriculture commissioner's power to regulate pesticides
knuckled under to chemical industry lobbyists, environmentalists
and others charged Thursday.
   Agriculture Commissioner Jim Hightower's aggressive enforcement
of pesticide rules has angered some chemical and farm interests,
environmentalists said. The commissioner is elected in Texas, not
appointed.
   ``This ... is a slap in the face to all those ordinary people
who can't afford high-priced lobbyists,'' said Brigid Shea of Texas
Clean Water Action.
   ``When you look at this ... ask yourself this question: Would
the chemical lobby hire a cadre of people, spend hundreds of
thousands of dollars and almost two years' time to pass a bill to
better protect the public, or to better protect their profits?''
she said.
   A spokesman for the Texas Agricultural Chemicals Association,
Jon Fisher, disputed the charge and said environmentalists had
rejected offers to compromise on pesticide regulation.
   ``We have, since last fall, offered to negotiate a way to
regulate pesticides that would be in the interests of the people of
this state and the future. Because they refused to negotiate,
because they indicated to me they had commitments that would not
allow them to negotiate, we did not get involved. We were not
involved in what happened in the House,'' he said.
   The House gave final approval Thursday to ``sunset'' legislation
that would continue the Agriculture Department for 12 more years.
   But the House also added an amendment Wednesday to take
pesticide regulation away from Hightower and give it to a
six-member board that would include the commissioner and five
others.
   The bill was sent back to the Senate for consideration of House
amendments. If rejected there, the issue would go to a conference
committee with members from both chambers.
   DeDe Armentrout, regional director of the National Audubon
Society, said controversy over Democrat Hightower _ whose
department Republican Gov. Bill Clements could abolish by vetoing
the sunset review bill _ was hurting the public.
   ``Eighty-eight legislators placed higher importance on placating
a big-monied chemical lobby and an uncaring governor at the end of
his career than in protecting citizens against exposure to
dangerous pesticides,'' Ms. Armentrout said.
   The proposed pesticide board would also include the state
chemist, the Texas Tech University agriculture school dean, the
dean of the University of Texas School of Public Health, a state
Health Department epidemiology official and a Texas Water
Commission official.

   Former WTSP-Channel 10 news director Terry Cole and Michael
Shapiro, assistant news director at the ABC affiliate, were charged
Wednesday with 17 counts of computer hacking and conspiracy in the
theft of information through computer phone lines. They were
scheduled for a May 19 court appearance.
   ``It's no different than digging a tunnel under their office and
coming up and rummaging through their desks,'' Chief Assistant
State Attorney Chris Hoyer said. ``It's high-tech burglary.''
   If convicted, each could get up to 85 years in prison.
   They are accused of raiding the files of WTVT-Channel 13, a CBS
affiliate between November 1988 and January.
   Before joining WTSP, Shapiro was an assignment manager at WTVT
and helped set up security for that station's newsroom computer,
including passwords and identification codes intended to keep files
confidential.
   Shapiro, 33, was arrested in February. Cole, 32, his boss, was
arrested in April.
   Vincent Barresi, general manager of WTSP, said his station has
never condoned hacking and that Shapiro and Cole were fired.
   Hoyer nevertheless said he is considering a civil lawsuit to
seize the station's assets under Florida's racketeering laws, which
let an organization be penalized for profiting from criminal
activity.
   ``Hopefully that would not be the case,'' WTSP attorney C.
Philip Campbell Jr. said. ``The station continues to cooperate.
It's in Mr. Hoyer's hands.''
   Hoyer said his decision on a racketeering lawsuit will be
affected by whether WTVT sues WTSP.
   ``They're the victims in this case and we're waiting to see what
they do,'' Hoyer said.
   WTVT news director Bob Franklin said corporate executives were
still discussing that decision with attorneys.

  The investigation by HUD Inspector General Paul
A. Adams into a federal low-income housing renovation program came
under fire Thursday on Capitol Hill from legislators who questioned
the conclusions that there was no evidence of criminal wrongdoing.
   Adams was also criticized for waiting until a day before former
Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Samuel Pierce was
scheduled to leave the department to interview him and for singling
out for culpability Thomas T. Demery, the former assistant
secretary for housing who was responsible for administration of the
program.
   Adams and Demery told the House Banking housing about their
roles in the HUD Section 8 Moderate Rehablitation Program and the
subsequent investigation of its selection and allocation process.
   Two weeks ago, Jack Kemp, the current HUD secretary, suspended
more than $100 million in fiscal 1989 spending for project under
the program.
   Kemp said Adams' investigation had uncovered a system that ``was
undocumented, ignored existing standards and regulations, and was
based on the perception and reality of favoritism and abuse of
non-public information'' through which former HUD appointees and
other former government officials won lucrative consultanting
contracts.
   ``Why would you have waited ... until Jan 19 of this year to
interview the HUD secretary Samuel Pierce who was going out of
office the next day?'' queried Rep. Henry Gonzalez, D-Texas, the
subcommittee's chairman, noting that Adams' probe had begun almost
a year earlir.
   Adams said his investigation did not immediately turn up any
evidence of Pierce's possible involvement and he said ``it was just
a matter of scheduling interviews.''
   But Demery insisted, as he had another hearing earlier this
week, that problems existed in the program before he gained his
post in October 1986 and spending decisions were ``discretionary''
for Pierce
   In January 1987, Demery said a selection committee was set up
that included himself; Deborah Gore Dean, former executive
assistant to Pierce; and an undersecretary for policy.
   But Demery conceded Pierce had final approval over any
recommendations made by the group.
   The HUD inspector general's investigation cover activities in
the program from January 1984 through November 1988.
   Gonzalez also asked why Adams made no ``specific recommendations
regarding possible violations of law'' by former HUD officials.
   Adams answered that his office had consulted with the Justice
Department throughout the investigation and found no evidence laws
had been violated.
   ``I find a disturbing indication in the documents that because
these allocation formulas and the laws that pertain to HUD are not
criminal statutes, that the conspiracies that go on here of
individuals working together in order to go around established
procedures are treated as if they are not criminal matters,'' said
Rep. Bruce Morrison, D-Conn.
   But the Justice Department is reviewing the report, Adams added.
   Rep. Joseph Kennedy, D-Mass described Demery as ``one of the few
people that we could ever talk to at HUD'' during the previous
administration.
   But Kennedy later took Demery to task because of his hesitancy
to name Pierce as the HUD official directly responsible for the
alleged abuse and mismanagement in the program and he said the
inspector general's conclusions might ``compromise'' any future
investigation.
   Rep. Marci Kaptur, D-Ohio, indicated she might request a special
prosecutor to investigate the program.

<TEXT>
   The Republican and Democratic leadership of
Congress gave president Bush a solid vote of approval Thursday for
``a measured, careful and deliberate''' response to election fraud
in Panama and the brutality of its military ruler, Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega.
   But some legislators said there is strong pressure on the
president _ which he has so far rejected _ to either invade Panama
or scrap the treaties turning the Panama Canal over to Panama by
the end of the century.
   They rallied behind the course Bush did choose, reinforcing U.S.
forces in Panama with an additional 2,000 combat troops and moving
to protect the 51,000 American civilians in the country.
   Senate Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas acknowleged that
many members of Congress believe Bush did not go far enough and
tougher action is needed to drive Noriega from power.
   But he hinted that tougher military steps may be needed
depending on the flow of events in Panama and said Bush's future
options are quite limited.
   ``It gets a little tighter from here on if nothing happens'' and
Noriega refuses to go, Dole said.
   Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., said the people of Panama may be on
the verge of settling the dispute on their own.
   But he also declared the United States has the right to ``to
keep all further military options opening for response to potential
crises.''
   ``We're drawing a much tighter noose around Noriega's neck with
every one of these unified actions,'' Lugar said.
   In a joint statement, the bipartisan leadership of Congress
expressed strong support ``for the president's action today in
taking measured and deliberate steps to assist the Panamanian
people in restoring democracy to Panama.''
   The congressional leaders also urged the democratic governments
of the hemisphere to condemn Noriega's actions in ``the strongest
possible terms.''
   ``It is the responsibility of freedom loving men and women
throughout the world to speak out in support of the expressed
democratic aspirations of the beseiged people of Panama,'' the
statement said.
   It was signed by House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas; Senate
Majority leader George Mitchell, D-Maine; House Majority Leader Tom
Foley, D-Wash.; House Minority Leader Robert H. Michel, R-Ill., and
Dole.
   At a news conference, Mitchell said the president had taken a
``prudent defensive measure.''
   But he said he had told Bush there will be those ``who think
this does not go far enough.''
   Dole said the measures have a dual purpose: protect American
lives and ``put the heat on Noriega.''
   ``We would hope that the Panamanian people and international
concern and outrage would have an impact on Gen. Noriega,'' Dole
said.
   Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., the Senate's deputy Democratic
leader, said there is ``general support in Congress for the steps
the president has taken.''
   He said that at a meeting with members of Congress, Bush had
``rejected advice to invade Panama or to break the treaty with
Panama.''
   Although Cranston did not say who gave that advice, those
courses of action have been urged by several lawmakers.
   Cranston said that although there is no guarantee Bush's moves
will force Noriega's departure quickly, especially in light of the
staying power he has shown to date, ``they should reduce the
prospects that he will stay there a long, long time.''
   Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., chairman of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, questioned Bush's decision to withdraw U.S.
Ambassador Arthur Davis.
   ``It is precisely when relations are at their worst that we need
an ambassador in country,'' Pell said. ``In this situation, the
continued presence of a U.S. ambassador could provide important
encouragement to the Panamanian opposition.''
   Pell said he supported the decision to withdraw dependents,
maintain sanctions and ``assert our treaty rights regarding the
Panama Canal.'' He warned, ``There is a risk, of course, that
increasing our troop strength could provide a convenient pretext
for Noriega to renew his accusations that the United States is
planning military intervention and to use that charge to take
further repressive actions.''
   Noriega is under indictment in the United States for narcotics
trafficking and Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said the prospect the
indictment might be withdrawn should figure in any negotiations to
persuade Noriega to leave.
   ``I think that in order to get this guy out of Panama ... that
should be a part of the negotiations,'' McCain said.
   He said the situation is made tougher by the fact that Noriega
has made clear ``that his goon squads are perfectly willing to
beat, maim and kill people.''
   Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., the Senate's president pro tem,
saying he found the conduct of the Panamanian presidential
elections ``saddening and maddening,'' said the United States
should now embark on a diplomatic offensive throughout Latin
America ``to isolate Noriega from the fruits of international
economic, political and diplomatic intercourse in this hemisphere.''
   Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, said the United States ``has every
right to protect its people and protect its property.'' Gramm said
Bush's action has ``got to give'' Noriega more pause.
   ``He will sleep less well tonight,'' Gramm said.
   But Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., said ``I'm not sure Gen. Noriega
will sleep at all tonight.'' Kerry said that in the past the United
States has underestimated Noriega, but the Panamanian leader
``senses the tide turning.''
   Kerry said that for the ``first time an entire, united,
bipartisan consensus policy has emerged.''
   ``The most important thing is that President Bush is reaching
out to Latin American allies. That's never happened before.''
   Kerry said he currently opposes dropping the drug charges
against Noriega, but said he wouldn't rule that out.
   ``If assets are given up, other things are achieved which
balance against it, I wouldn't negate any plea-bargaining,'' he
said. ``I have a problem with it, but I hope we don't get to that.
Let's see what the ingredients are at that time.''
   Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., said he commended the president
for his action because he believes there was a ``tremendous degree
of pressure on the president to take actions that were more
strident.''

   Nearly 1,000 infantry troops began
leaving Fort Ord Friday evening to join another 1,000 U.S. combat
soldiers ordered into Panama by President Bush, military officials
said.
   The Army's 7th Light Infantry Division at Fort Ord dispatched
880 combat troops and 100 cooks, medics and other support soldiers
to Travis Air Force Base, where they were to leave for Panama, Maj.
L.D. Walker, chief of public affairs for Fort Ord, said Thursday
afternoon.
   About 25 Army vehicles packed with troops began leaving the base
beginning at about 5:30 p.m. Travis is 160 miles northeast of Fort
Ord and 35 miles northeast of San Francisco.
   In addition, three companies consisting of 726 soldiers from
Fort Polk, La., and 165 Marines from Camp Lejeune, N.C., will be
among the 2,000 infantrymen sent to Panama, Department of Defense
officials said. Their departure time was not known.
   ``We are prepared to do our job,'' Maj. Terrance Hall, the
public affairs officer at Fort Polk, said at a news conference at
the base.
   Walker, said at a news conference there that the infantry troops
were being driven to Travis Air Force Base,
   The 7th, known as the Bayonet Division, is part of a highly
mobile outfit that carries most of its equipment on its back and is
designed for quick deployment anywhere in the world, base officials
said.
   Lt. Santos De La Rosa of Fort Ord said the base was placed on
alert Wednesday evening. The base is capable of dispatching
soldiers within 18 hours of such an alert, officials said.
   The 726 Fort Polk soldiers, comprising three 5th Army companies,
will be accompanied by 59 personnel carriers, six mortar carriers
and 106 support vehicles, said Lt. Cmdr. Jim Kudla at the Defense
Department in Washington
   The soldiers will convoy to Beaumont, Texas, where they will be
picked up by the USS Bellatrix, said Tony Garrett, press secretary
for U.S. Sen. Bennett Johnston, D-La.
   The Bellatrix was reportedly anchored in the New Orleans area on
Thursday afternoon.
   In North Carolina, Marine Lt. Col. Keith Schneider said the 2nd
Marine Expeditionary Force leaving for Panama consists of 165
Marines and 18 light armored vehicles. The Marines will be flown
directly from Camp Lejeune to Panama.
   Bush ordered the additional troops into Panama ``to protect the
lives of American citizens'' following Wednesday's bloody attacks
by supporters and troops of military ruler Manuel Noriega against
the opposition's presidential candidate and his running mates. The
United States regards the opposition to be winners of Panama's
election.
   The 2,000 troops will augment the 10,000 U.S. forces already in
the country.

<HEAD>Kenya Urges Ban on Ivory Trade To Save Elephants From Poachers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIDRIKKE SCHANCHE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kenya on Thursday urged an international
ban on the trade of ivory in an attempt to curb the illegal
slaughter of elephants, which has halved Africa's elephant
population since the early 1970s.
   Experts say a dramatic increase in elephant poaching has been
spurred by record world prices for ivory. Ivory sells for about $91
a pound, and an average tusk weighs 11 pounds.
   ``The policing of the elephants' survival is not easy, but it
will be more practical if any ivory trade is banned,'' N. Katana
Ngala, minister of tourism and wildlife, said at a news conference.
   Conservationists believe there are about 750,000 elephants left
on the continent. They say poachers are killing about 75,000 of the
mammals a year. If the slaughter continues at that rate, the
population could be wiped out by the year 2000.
   An aerial survey last year found an estimated 20,000 elephants
in Kenya, which 15 years ago had an elephant population of 121,000.
Ngala said the government will conduct another count in June and
July.
   He said Kenya submitted its recommendation on a trade ban
Thursday to the Lausanne, Switzerland-based Convention In Trade Of
Endangered Species.
   If two-thirds of the convention's approximately 100 members vote
to list elephants on the convention's Appendix One at the group's
next meeting in October, international trade in elephant products
would be banned.
   Tanzania and Somalia, Kenya's neighbors to the south and east
respectively, have submitted similar proposals to the convention,
said Richard Leakey, Kenya's director of wildlife.
   However, countries such as Japan, a major ivory consumer, are
likely to oppose the proposal.
   Zimbabwe, one of the few African nations with a growing elephant
population, has annual elephant kills and a thriving legal trade in
elephant products. In the last 12 months it has earned about
$600,000 in legal ivory sales.
   Ngala said that while Kenya realizes some African countries
would suffer from an ivory trade ban, such action is crucial if the
elephant is to survive.
   Kenya also plans to fence parts of its wildlife parks to better
protect elephants, Leakey said.
   Since the beginning of the year, he said, as many as 300
elephants have been killed in Kenya's parks.

   A fire that gutted a breeding center
housing about 500,000 laboratory mice will cause a worldwide
disruption of laboratories researching AIDS, cancer and other
diseases, officials said Thursday.
   Kenneth Paigen, the incoming director of Jackson Laboratory,
pledged ``to get back up as fast as we possibly can'' as salvage
teams searched for living mice within the research center's
still-smoldering animal production facility.
   The laboratory, which distributes about 2 million mice annually
to researchers, is the world's leading non-profit supplier and
developer of mutant mice bred in hundreds of genetically identical
strains.
   About a half-million mice would be in the facility on any given
day, officials said, but there was no estimate of how many or what
types might have survived.
   Paigen said the center had saved its ``foundation stocks'' of
specially bred mice but warned that supply disruptions would hamper
researchers who need the mice to investigate cancer, AIDS and other
human diseases.
   ``Thousands of labs, literally all over the world, depend on us
for supplies of mice, genetically defined animals,'' Paigen said.
   ``I think it's safe to say we have some of everything, but how
much we have of anything is not clear right now,'' said Philip
Standel, director of animal production. The laboratory, located two
miles outside the picturesque resort village of Bar Harbor, housed
about 1,000 strains of mice, many of them rare.
   ``The impact is going to be terrific, really detrimental,'' said
Salome Waelsch, a professor of molecular genetics at the Albert
Einstein College of Medicine in New York.
   ``There is no way of restoring this facility by just importing
mice from elsewhere,'' said Waelsch, a member of the National
Academy of Science.
   Dr. Richard Sidman, a professor of neuropathology at the Harvard
Medical School and a senior research scientist at Children's
Hospital in Boston, predicted the fire would ``modify the pace of
research'' for up to a year.
   Philip Leder, chairman of the Genetics Department at the Harvard
Medical School, described Wednesday's fire at the Bar Harbor
complex as ``a tragedy.''
   While the lost mice can be replenished eventually, Leder said,
``it's just going to take a tremendous amount of energy, investment
and time.''
   State Fire Marshal Donald M. Bisset said the fire was accidental
and was apparently linked to ``a product that gave off flammable
vapors'' that was being used by renovation workers in the building.
   One worker suffered extensive burns in the fire and was listed
in satisfactory condition Thursday at Maine Medical Center in
Portland, said hospital spokeswoman Sharon Sturgeon.
   Two other construction workers injured in the fire remained in
the Mount Desert Island Hospital in Bar Harbor, where they were
listed in stable condition.
   Inside the laboratory's research center, which was not involved
in the fire, supervisory staff handled a steady stream of phone
calls from Jackson Laboratory customers, explaining that damage
assessments had only just begun.
   ``It's universities, it's hospitals, it's government agencies,
pharmaceuticals,'' said John Pomroy, an assistant manager.
   Paigen, who assumes the director's post full-time this summer,
vowed that the center would recover fully from the fire.
   ``The major decision we made, in fact we never considered an
alternative, is that we're rebuilding,'' he said.

<HEAD>Timothy Bottoms Arrested for Investigation of Brandishing Gun</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VENTURA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A motorist accused actor Timothy Bottoms
of waving a Western-style pistol at him during a freeway clash, and
Bottoms was booked on two criminal charges, the California Highway
Patrol said Thursday.
   Frank Harwood, 38, of Meiners Oaks, called the CHP on his
cellular phone at about 4:30 p.m. Wednesday to report he had been
threatened as he drove his pickup truck on U.S. Highway 101 in
Ventura, CHP spokesman Jim Utter said.
   Traffic officers pulled over the station wagon belonging to
``The Last Picture Show'' actor about 12 miles farther north on the
highway, near the Ventura-Santa Barbara county line.
   Bottoms, 37, of Santa Barbara was booked for investigation of
brandishing a gun on a roadway, a felony, and carrying a loaded
weapon, a misdemeanor. He posted bail and was scheduled for
arraignment Monday in Municipal Court.
   Utter said he had only limited details of the freeway
confrontation. ``It would appear he (Bottoms) became involved in
the freeway incident either due to discourteous or possibly unsafe
driving,'' he said.
   Bottoms' arrest was routine and the gun was confiscated. ``It
was apparently a long-barreled, .22-caliber pistol,'' Utter said.
   Sandy Bresler, Bottoms' spokesman, said he would not even call
the actor to ask him to comment on the arrest. ``I have trouble
believing that's true,'' he said. ``It doesn't sound like the
Timothy Bottoms I know.''
   Bottoms made his film debut in 1971 in the movie ``Johnny Got
His Gun,'' the same year he appeared in ``The Last Picture Show.''
His other films include ``The Paper Chase'' (1973), ``The Other
Side of the Mountain Part II'' (1978) and ``Invaders From Mars''
(1986).
   Bottoms has also appeared in several television productions
including the mini-series ``East of Eden'' in 1981.

   Latin American nations denounced Panama for voiding its
election, but several said Thursday they opposed foreign
interference. Cuba backed Panama's government and said U.S.
intervention would provoke an ``explosive reaction.''
   President Bush said he was adding 2,000 soldiers to the 10,000
stationed in Panama to ``protect the lives of American citizens.''
   Mexico recalled its ambassador to Panama for consultations, the
Foreign Ministry said.
   President Carlos Andres Perez of Venezuela urged Latin American
nations to act together to protest vote fraud, and he called the
decision to nullify the count ``even worse than the fraud itself.''
   Costa Rica said: ``The election in which an entire people voted
with such hope, seeking their freedom without violence, has been
betrayed.''
   Britain joined the United States in demanding the resignation of
Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, commander of Panama's 15,000 soldiers
and police, who has been the country's de facto ruler since 1983.
   A statement by the European Economic Community condemned ``the
repeated use of force and numerous acts of violence during the
electoral process, particularly the brutal physical aggression
against opposition leaders by bat-wielding thugs trained by the
country's defense forces.''
   It hinted at sanctions with the declaration: ``The EEC, whose
relations with the Latin American countries are based on consistent
and permanent respect for the principles and institutions of
democracy, cannot ignore the seriousness of these developments.''
   Perez said he was in ``constant consultations'' with Bush and
other leaders. He said he had called for an extraordinary meeting
of the permanent council of the Organization of American States to
consider action against Noriega.
   In Brazil, the Foreign Ministry said Thursday it would support
an emergency meeting of the OAS to find solutions to the Panamanian
crisis.
   Salvadoran President Jose Napoleon Duarte also said he would
petition OAS President Joao Baena Soares to convene an emergency
meeting.
   ``All the democratic presidents of Latin America see that there
was obvious fraud in Panama, and we must now raise our voices,'' he
said.
   International election observers, including former President
Jimmy Carter, said Endara had been leading Noriega's candidate,
Carlos Duque, by a 3-1 count when balloting was voided.
   In Buenos Aires, Argentine Foreign Minister Dante Caputo said
``what happened in Panama seems to us incredible and unacceptable.''
   The government of Peruvian President Alan Garcia said it
``denounces and rejects'' the nullification, which it called a
``maneuver against the will of the Panamanian people.''
   Peru also said, however, that it supported the fulfillment of
the Panama Canal Treaty, under which the United States will turn
over the canal to Panama by the year 2000.
   In Chile, the Foreign Ministry said President Augusto Pinochet's
government ``views with concern'' the violence and the voiding of
the balloting.
   ``We also view with concern a rise in interference by some
countries in Panama's internal affairs,'' the ministry added.
   Cuba's Foreign Ministry also said it opposed foreign
interference.
   The statement ``warns about the grave consequences for all of
the Latin American region and for the interests of relations
between Latin America and the United States (because) of the
unavoidable and explosive reaction that would take place among the
peoples of our America if there is a U.S. military action,''
reported Radio Rebelde, monitored in Miami.
   It did not offer details on what the consequences or reaction
would be. On Oct. 25, 1983, Cuban construction workers and a
handful of soldiers battled U.S. invaders on the Caribbean island
of Grenada but were overwhelmed as the United States ousted a
radical Grenadian army junta.
   On Wednesday, seven Latin American foreign ministers said the
turbulence following the Sunday election could further isolate the
country from the region's democracies.
   The statement was signed by the Group of Eight nations, which
actually has seven members _ Peru, Argentina, Uruguay, Brazil,
Venezuela, Colombia and Mexico. Panama was suspended after Noriega,
the nation's de facto ruler, engineered the ouster of elected
President Eric Delvalle in February 1988.
   Spain also condemned the voiding of the elections, and Britain
demanded Noriega resign.
   In Moscow, the official Tass news agency contended the
nullification was necessary because the opposition, ``directly
instigated by the United States,'' had attempted to rig the results.
   The decision to nullify the election ``appears to be
extraordinary, but the only correct one,'' it said.
   In Washington, presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater
called the Tass account ``very disappointing.''
   ``It certainly tends to throw cold water on many of the claims
of a new thinking, a new openness in foreign relations,'' Fitzwater
said.

<HEAD>Amherst Board Upholds Controversial Anthrax Research</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AMHERST, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The town Board of Health refused Thursday
to ban controversial military-funded research at the University of
Massachusetts, research that local Quakers fear could be used in
germ warfare.
   The university has been wracked by three weeks of protests by
students and Amherst residents over Department of Defense-funded
research on campus, particularly microbiologist Curtis Thorne's
work with the anthrax bacteria.
   Campus police have arrested 151 people since the protests began.
Early Thursday morning, they removed and arrested a group of
students who had barricaded themselves in a campus building for 30
hours.
   Both the town health board and the UMass Faculty Senate held
special meetings Thursday to discuss the issue. The faculty agreed
to review university policy on campus research, which holds that
only non-classified research whose results can be made public may
be conducted.
   The health board, by a 3-0 vote, rejected a call by the American
Friends Service Committee's western Massachusetts chapter to halt
Thorne's research on anthrax, a disease of cattle and sheep that
can also be transmitted to humans.
   The Friends' spokesman, Ira Helfand, said the likelihood of a
laboratory accident that could spread the disease to the town is
slight but possible.
   Helfand also charged that Thorne's work on improving the vaccine
against the disease could be used offensively. He said the Pentagon
could inoculate U.S. forces against the disease while infecting
enemy soldiers.
   He also charged Thorne with working with new and dangerous
strains of the bacteria in what could be a violation of the 1972
international treaty banning biological weapons.
   Thorne, in a telephone interview Thursday, said he deliberately
chose to work with non-virulent strains of the bacteria and has no
reason to develop highly toxic strains of the bacteria, since the
military could already purchase them from a commercial laboratory.
   But, he said, an improved vaccine might protect in peacetime
U.S. soldiers who go to parts of the world such as Australia and
South America, where anthrax is endemic.
   Thorne said he has never had a safety problem and believes his
work does not have offensive military applications. ``If I didn't
feel confident about that, I wouldn't be doing it,'' he added.
   While recognizing that military-funded research on campus might
be undesirable, the health board sided with Thorne.
   ``I don't think there is any question that the opponents object
to the research because of the source of its funding and are using
this issue as a means to accomplish their ends,'' said chairman
Diana Stein, a biology professor at Mount Holyoke College. She said
the last anthrax death in a laboratory was 35 years ago.
   Initially Thorne's work, begun in 1966, was funded by the
National Institute of Health. For the past nine years it has been
financed by $1 million in grants from the Pentagon.
   About $11.6 million of the $57 million the 25,000-student
university received in grants during 1988 came from the Defense
Department.
   The Quakers said they will appeal the board's decision to the
state Department of Quality Environmental Engineering. They have
also placed an article before town meeting that would ban all
military-funded research at Amherst. The town will vote on that
question in late May or early June.

<TEXT>
   Opposition leaders Thursday rejected
the government's move to void the election and said the world
should unite to oust Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, whose thugs beat
them the day before.
   President Bush ordered U.S. military bases in Panama reinforced.
Dependents of military and U.S. Embassy staff members were moved to
the safety of Fort Clayton.
   Panamanian soldiers patrolled the city. U.S. military personnel
were advised to stay off the streets if possible and to wear only
civilian clothes in public.
   Bush said in Washington that about 2,000 soldiers would be added
to to the 10,000 stationed in Panama to ``protect the lives of
American citizens.'' About 21,300 U.S. civilians live in Panama,
many of them retired.
   There was no immediate reaction from the Panamanian military.
   Noriega, head of the 15,000-man Defense Forces, has been
Panama's de facto ruler since 1983. The United States has tried to
get him out through a variety of means, including economic
sanctions.
   Bush also recalled U.S. Ambassador Arthur Davis and said U.S.
companies doing business in Panama will be asked to bring home
dependents. He said Americans in Panama would be asked to leave or
to move into one of the 10 U.S. military compounds.
   Ricardo Arias Calderon, the opposition's candidate for first
vice president, issued an ``urgent call to Latin American and North
American and European governments to start a concerted, decisive
diplomatic and political action to help make the will of our people
prevail and to keep us from sinking deeper into savagery and
disaster.''
   He said this should be done by the Organization of American
States.
   Arias Calderon told a news conference he would not let the
government use fraud as an excuse for nullifying the elections when
the fraud was committed by the Panamanian military.
   On the deployment of additional U.S. troops, Arias Calderon
said: ``It is U.S. policy provoked by Noriega and not requested by
us.''
   A government statement Thursday denounced what it said was an
attempt to organize a coup in Panama organized in part by
Venezeuelan President Carlos Andres Perez.
   The release said those contacted about taking part included Col
Guillermo Wong, the chief of intelligence of Panama's military.
   There was no immediate response from Venezuela.
   U.S. reporters were barred from an Elections Tribunal press
conference Thursday. On a tape recording of the conference Yolanda
Pulice, head of the tribunal, said she did not know when new
elections might be called.
   ``For now what is more important is peace among Panamanians,''
she said. ``There will be decisisons later.''
   Many nations condemned the government's nullification of
Sunday's presidential election, which the government said Noriega's
candidate won and foreign observers said was a landslide for the
opposition.
   Noriega supporters with bats and metal pipes beat Guillermo
Endara, the opposition presidential candidates, and his running
mates for the two vice presidencies during a demonstration
Wednesday. Soldiers watched but did not interfere.
   The beatings occurred after soldiers intervened in the protest
of what the opposition calls the theft of Sunday's election.
   Endara remained hospitalized Thursday with a scalp wound that
required eight stitches. Doctors said his condition was stable with
no neurological complications.
   ``We won and we will continue to fight,'' said Guillermo Ford, a
vice presidential candidate who was beaten and thrown in jail.
   Ford, who had stitches over his eye and cheek, said he was
sentenced Wednesday night to a year in jail for inciting riot and
attacking soldiers, then freed a few hours later.
   He said the opposition wants to talk with the military, but that
would require getting rid of Noriega ``because Panama cannot have
two presidents.''
   The government said it was voiding the election because
irregularities and U.S. interference made it impossible to declare
a victor. It also cited stealing and buying of votes and missing
tally sheets.
   U.S. Embassy spokeswoman Cynthia Farrell said embassy dependents
were moved to Fort Clayton on Thursday. There are 152 embassy
dependents in Panama and 10,560 military dependents, 972 living off
base.
   ``You have these `Dignity Battallions' moving around town and
targeting people,'' Ms. Farrell said.
   Members of the ``Dignity Battallions,'' armed groups of Noriega
supporters, were involved in the melee Wednesday.
   Ambassador Davis and other officials said one of Endara's
bodyguards was killed and about 20 demonstrators were injured
Wednesday. The military said four soldiers were wounded.
   More than 300 international observers, including former
President Jimmy Carter, supported opposition claims that Endara won
by a 3-1 margin.
   When the election was voided, official results had shown
Noriega's handpicked candidate, Carlos Duque, leading by about 2-1.
   Washington began its campaign to remove Noriega after he
arranged the dismissal of President Eric Delvalle, who tried to
fire Noriega after the general was indicted in Florida on
drug-trafficking charges in February 1988. Noriega denies the
charges.
   Noriega claims the United States wants to get rid of him so it
can renege on the Panama Canal treaties, which turn the canal over
to Panama on Dec. 31, 1999.

   Washington has asked Thailand to
evacuate 300 Thai workers from a Libyan plant the United States
alleges can produce poison gas, it was reported Thursday.
   ``The United States has threatened to bomb the area but has
promised it will inform Thailand before launching an attack,'' said
The Nation, a Thai newspaper.
   In Washington, the State Department said in a statement that the
United States has discussed with a number of governments, including
the Thailand, ``the dangers posed by Libya's chemical weapons
program, and have asked them not to contribute to its development.''
   ``We have information that there are a number of Thai workers
employed at the Rabta site,'' the statement said.
   A State Department source, speaking on condition of anonymity,
refused to confirm that the United States has asked Thailand to
evacuate its workers but said, ``The presence of the workers has
been a subject of discussion.''
   The Nation quoted an unidentified senior Thai government
official as saying Libya told the Thai ambassador in Rome that it
would expel all 75,000 Thai laborers from Libya if the 300 workers
were evacuated.
   Tripoli says the plant at Rabta, Libya, is a pharmaceutical
complex.

   A prosecutor said Thursday that four
Ecclesia Athletic Association members acted in concert to beat to
death the 8-year-old daughter of the disciplinary group's founder.
   ``They all committed the crime of beating Dayna Broussard to
death,'' Clackamas County Deputy District Attorney Alfred J. French
III said in his closing statement.
   The jury began deliberations Thursday afternoon on the
first-degree manslaughter charges against Willie K. Chambers, 35,
of San Diego; Brian K. Brinson, 31; Constance Z. Jackson, 38; and
Frederick P. Doolittle, 28, all of Los Angeles.
   Prosecutors have said the girl was struck hundreds of times Oct.
13 as punishment for stealing food, and as an example to other
children who were staying in a farmhouse near Sandy, about 30 miles
southeast of Portland in the foothills of Mount Hood.
   Witnesses testified she was beaten with an electrical cord,
rubber hose, piece of plastic pipe, bamboo pole and weightlifting
belt.
   Most of the 53 other children were forced to watch the beating,
prosecutors said. Several testified that Dayna was slammed against
a wall, kicked, tripped, slapped, dropped on the floor, shoved,
bitten, spit upon and hung out a window.
   After Dayna's body was delivered to a fire station, the other
children, ranging in age from 1{ months to 16 years, were taken
into state custody. The children now are living in foster homes or
with relatives.
   The girl's father, Eldridge Broussard Jr., was in Los Angeles at
the time of her death. He did not attend the trial.
   Broussard, 35, has blamed negative news coverage for his
daughter's death. He denied that the children were beaten or
abused, saying they were only ``spanked.''
   Broussard formed Ecclesia at the Watts Christian Center in Los
Angeles to steer children away from drugs and crime and to motivate
them through tough discipline and athletic training.
   The children were brought to Oregon last summer while the Los
Angeles center was being renovated.
   French said the defendants' effort to discipline Dayna turned
into a ``contest of wills.''
   ``The wills of the four defendants prevailed that night, and
Dayna Broussard is dead,'' French said.
   Jack Bernstein, the attorney for Doolittle, responded that
French's selection of witnesses and evidence, including graphic
photographs of the dead girl's body, had been a calculated attempt
to misdirect jurors.
   ``The little children who were paraded before you were done to
inflame you and enrage you,'' Bernstein said.
   Bernstein said French called only a few of the children as
witnesses because others would have presented conflicting accounts
of what happened to Dayna.
   Both Bernstein and Ron Thom, the attorney for Brinson, argued
that French failed to prove their clients were guilty of
manslaughter.
   ``You won't like it,'' told jurors. ``I don't ask you to like
it. But you've got to follow the law.''

<TEXT>
   The woman reputed to be the priestess of a
cult blamed for 15 ritual slayings was moved Thursday with six
others arrested in the case to a prison on the edge of the city.
   Officials said the seven, who had been held at the city attorney
general's office for questioning, could be arraigned as early as
Friday.
   Although they were sought in connection with the cult killings,
Sara Aldrete Villarreal and the other two main figures in the group
have been charged only in three Mexico City murders.
   One of those killed was the ``godfather'' of the cult, Adolfo de
Jesus Constanzo, who cult members said ordered his own execution
when police closed in on them at a Mexico City apartment on
Saturday.
   Two other women, Maria del Rocio Cuevas Guerra and Maria de
Lourdes Guero, a physician, were charged with covering up a crime
in connection with the 15 killings on the Santa Elena ranch outside
Matamoros. Their case was to be transferred to a federal court.
   In announcing the charges late Wednesday, Marco Antonio Diaz de
Leon, an official of the city attorney general's office, said Ms.
Aldrete, Constanzo and three others who were with them in the
apartment had made a pact to kill each other if they were going to
be arrested.
   ``This death pact was carried out,'' he said.
   Authorities said Ms. Aldrete, a former honor student at Texas
Southmost College in Brownsville, Texas, directed the human
sacrifices and other rituals, including mutilations and boiling of
brains and organs. They said the rituals were meant to bring occult
protection to the drug ring, which allegedly trafficked in
marijuana to the United States. Alvaro de Leon Valdez, one of those
arrested, said that when Costanzo saw police on the street below
the fourth-floor apartment where they were staying, he panicked and
demanded to be killed.
   He told a news conference earlier this week that he used a
machine gun to kill Constanzo and Martin Quintana, his right-hand
man.
   Ms. Aldrete and Omar Francisco Orea were charged with homicide,
firing a weapon at authorities, resisting arrest, criminal
association and causing injuries. De Leon Valdez was charged with
the first four crimes.
   The death pact was the basis for the homicide charges against
Ms. Aldrete and Orea, Diaz de Leon said. He said another
consideration was that when Constanzo ordered De Leon Valdez to
kill him, Ms. Aldrete urged him on.
   At a news conference on Sunday Ms. Aldrete said she told De Leon
Valdez, ``Do it, do it. If you don't do it, you're going to pay
with circumstances (you encounter) in hell.''
   Constanzo, a Cuban-born American from Florida, Ms. Aldrete and
other associates had been sought on both sides of the border since
April 11, when police dug up the first of 15 bodies found on the
ranch.
   Most of them were mutilated, including that of Mark Kilroy, a
pre-medical student from Santa Fe, Texas.
   In two news conferences, Ms. Aldrete calmly told reporters she
knew nothing of the murders until she saw television reports on the
discovery of the bodies and asked Constanzo about them.
   However, U.S. Customs Agent Oran Neck, speaking in Brownsville,
told a news conference Wednesday that during questioning she had
``confessed to conspiracy and involvement'' in the killings.

<HEAD>Baby Of Brain-Dead Teen Delivered By C-Section</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN BERNARDINO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A brain-dead teen-ager whose
plight became the focus of a right-to-life debate delivered a
premature baby by Caesarean section Thursday while on life-support
machinery.
   The baby girl, who weighed about five pounds and was seven weeks
premature, was listed in very critical condition Thursday
afternoon, said Charles Jervis, director of the San Bernardino
County Medical Center.
   The baby is suffering breathing difficulty because her lungs are
insufficiently developed.
   The mother, Tanya Marie Rivera, 15, was pronounced brain dead
after she was shot in the head two months ago.
   In March, her divorced parents requested that their pregnant
daughter be disconnected from life-support equipment, leading to
protests by the Right to Life League of Southern California. The
parents later reversed their position.
   Jervis said the mother began having contractions Wednesday
afternoon. The doctors tried desperately to halt them with
medication, but the fetus' life became threatened.
   ``On the morning of May 11, the fetus began to demonstrate signs
of fetal distress in response to the uterine contractions and the
decision was made to perform an emergency Caesarean,'' Jervis said.
   Doctors said the baby girl was suffering from hyaline membrane
disease, caused by a deficiency of a bodily chemical that normally
coats tiny sacs within the lung, where blood in the membrane
absorbs oxygen. Without the chemical, called surficant, the sacs
collapse with each breath the baby takes.
   ``Tanya has continued to remain on life-support system pending
parents' notification of their wishes,'' Jervis said.
   Miss Rivera was declared brain dead March 15 after she was shot
in the head, allegedly by her 16-year-old boyfriend, who police
said is believed to be the father of the child.
   The boyfriend, known by the gang street name ``Stymie,'' is in
jail in Los Angeles in connection with an unrelated murder charge.
The juvenile's name has not been released by authorities.

   Those summer days spent soaking up the rays to
create a glorious tan may come back to haunt sun worshippers with
cancer and aged, wrinkled skin, a panel of experts said.
   A National Institutes of Health consensus committee on Wednesday
said current health studies show that suntans can lead to skin
cancer, a weakened immune system and skin that wrinkles and ages
before its time.
   Instead of uncovering to bathe in the noontime sun, the panel
recommended Americans avoid the midday hours of sunlight, wear
shading clothes and apply generous amounts of sunscreen lotions.
   Children in particular should be protected from overexposure to
sunlight because skin damaged early in life is more likely to
develop cancer later, the panel said in a report.

   Some doctors are warning that long-term, daily use
of a common aspirin substitute may triple the usual risk of kidney
damage, but the maker of Tylenol disputed the finding.
   ``I don't want people to panic and say, `My kids shouldn't have
Tylenol,''' said Dr. Saulo Klahr, president of the National Kidney
Foundation. ``But at the same time, it's important for people not
to take this drug daily.''
   Klahr said acetaminophen, the main ingredient in Tylenol,
Anacin-3, Datril and other brands, may accumulate in the kidneys
and cause chemical damage. A related painkiller, called phenacetin,
was taken off the market six years ago because of concern about
kidney damage and bladder cancer.
   Some experts also have worried that prolonged daily use of
ibuprofen, another common painkiller, may harm the kidneys. The
drug was released for non-prescription sales in 1985 and was not
included in the study of acetaminophen.

   Spiegel, Land's End and L.L. Bean addicts
beware _ the nation's governors want you to begin paying sales
taxes on your mail-order shopping sprees.
   Governors, joined by state legislators and mayors, are urging
Congress to overturn a 22-year-old Supreme Court decision and
require large mail-order companies to collect sales taxes n sales
to out-of-state customers.
   As a result of that ruling, North Dakota Gov. George Sinner told
a news conference Wednesday, hometown merchants are at a decided
disadvantage and states, cities and counties are losing more than
$1.5 billion a year in tax revenue.
   ``Because state sales taxes run from 5 percent to 8 percent of
the cost of the goods sold, the unfair tax advantage by
out-of-state firms in sales taxes is greater than the average
profit margin of Main Street merchants,'' Sinner said. In fact, he
added, the average hometown merchant's profit margin is less than 3
percent.

   Fire killed about 500,000 research mice
at the Jackson Laboratory, and the loss will set back scientists

   Four construction workers who were remodeling the building where

least two firefighters were treated for smoke inhalation, officials
said.
   ``We managed to save what are called the foundation stocks ...
the original genetically defined strains'' of mice, said
Director-designate Kenneth Paigen. ``It will take us time but we

   Earl Green, a former Jackson director, said it would take six to
eight generations of mice, or about two or three years, to replace
the animals.

   A man who rented a house to an unmarried
couple and then changed his mind because he believed they were not
showing respect for Christian values is getting support from across
the country.
   ``I just couldn't allow that type of activity to go on in our
house,'' said carpenter Layle French, 33, who reneged on an
agreement that would have allowed Sue Jenson and her fiance to move
into a house he was trying to sell.
   A Minnesota administrative law judge ruled in March that French
violated a law that prohibits discrimination based on marital
status. He said the only unsettled issue is how much French should
pay in damages.
   French, a member of the Marshall Evangelical Free Church,
contends the law should take a back seat to his Christian values.
Aside from that, he maintains that couples who live together
violate the state's fornication law.

   Faced with his first crisis as president,
George Bush has decided on a measured response to the tumultuous
situation in Panama, concerned that more decisive action could
imperil longer-term U.S. interests in the area.
   He said he was sending troops ``to protect the lives of American
citizens.'' But he ordered no direct military action and no new
economic sanctions against the government of Panamanian leader
Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Bush warned of the consequences of failing to send a ``clear
signal'' to the ``enemies of constitutional rule'' in Panama and
elsewhere.
   But the seven points Bush outlined indicated that if Noriega is
to be overthrown, it will have to be primarily the work of
Panamanians and not Americans.

beat a woman and left her for dead 16 years ago, resigned Thursday
as renewed publicity about his case burdened the speaker's fight
against charges of financial misconduct.
   ``When I was 19 years old, I made a terrible and tragic
mistake,'' said John P. Mack, now 35. ``I wish I could rewrite the
past, but unfortunately I can't,'' he said in a statement released
by the speaker's office.
   Wright, D-Texas, hired Mack as a mail clerk after Mack got out
of jail in 1975 and eventually promoted him to the top House staff
position. He accepted the resignation ``with sadness and regret,''
Wright said.
   ``I was willing to give this young man another chance, and in
the intervening years I have never had occasion to regret it,''
Wright said in a statement. Later, talking briefly with reporters,
Wright said Mack resigned without being asked.

   The Bush administration on Thursday proposed a
$500 million oil spill cleanup fund to be financed by the oil
industry, even as Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner suggested
the cost of the Alaska spill could exceed that amount.
   Congress has been debating creation of such a fund for 15 years,
but supporters said the effort received little attention until the
tanker Exxon Valdez ran aground in March, dumping 11 million
gallons of oil into the pristine waters off Alaska.
   Skinner outlined the administration's proposal at a
congressional hearing during which he noted that the federal
government at the time of the Alaska spill had only a few million
dollars available specifically for cleanup efforts.
   Had that spill been caused by a company less well-to-do than the
Exxon Corp., the government would have had to scramble for funds
and ask Congress for tens of millions of dollars to get the cleanup
effort going, Skinner told the House Subcommittee on Coast Guard
and Navigation.

   In what seems the unlikeliest of foreign
exchanges, a Chinese delegation is touring the trading floors of
several U.S. futures exchanges, looking to create
``socialist-style'' commodity markets back home.
   Although high-rolling professional speculators and high-risk
futures contracts probably won't be part of the first Chinese grain
exchange, there's no telling how far things could go once the
bidding begins.
   ``We will focus mainly on the spot market, then we will try to
introduce some futures mechanism,'' said Lu Jian Guang, the only
English-speaking member of the four-man group. ``If everything is
successful, maybe it will be enlarged.''
   ``It all depends on the outside environment _ political reforms
as well as economic reforms,'' Lu said Thursday as the group
prepared to visit the Minneapolis Grain Exchange after stops at the
Chicago Board of Trade and the Kansas City Board of Trade.

   The bombings of two Minnesota state judges'
homes 15 miles apart were connected, authorities say, and the U.S.
Marshals Service says threats against federal court officials are
on the rise.
   Criminals ``think threatening the judge will solve the
problem,'' said Bill Dempsey, a spokesman for the Marshals Service.
   ``It kind of goes with the turf, unfortunately,'' said Olmsted
County District Judge Gerard Ring, who received several death
threats last year after a controversial ruling in the case of a
youthful ax murder suspect.
   ``I don't think there's been a judge who's been on the bench
more than a couple years who hasn't had some threats or harassment
of some kind,'' said Anoka County District Judge Lynn Olson.

   Rhunetta Crumel is one person who thinks Avon
Products Inc. should not be fighting so hard against Amway Corp.'s
offer to buy it for more than $2 billion.
   Opportunity is knocking for Avon, says Mrs. Crumel, who has
reason to know: She is both an Avon representative and an Amway
distributor.
   The takeover battle between the two giants of direct sales will
directly affect nearly 3 million people worldwide, roughly 1.5
million representing Avon and more than 1 million from Amway.
   Avon's stock was off 62{ cents a share to $39.25, still slightly
above Amway's $39-a-share offering price, in late trading Thursday
on the New York Stock Exchange. The spread indicated speculators
were betting a higher bid would emerge from Amway or another suitor.

   The Cabildo, the building where the Louisiana
Purchase was signed, stands echoing and vacant, only the 20-foot
ceilings and other architectural details hinting at more than 200
years of history.
   Large chunks of the ceilings and floors are ripped out of one of
New Orleans' most famous landmarks. Where maps and pictures once
hung, stenciled instructions order, ``Repair cracks entire wall''
and ``Remove plaster.''
   But there are no workers to follow those instructions, or to
replace the third story, destroyed by a fire May 11, 1988, because
the state hasn't come up with $1.2 million to get things ready for
renovation.
   Firefighters rescued most of the Cabildo's treasures, including
the death mask of Napoleon. A temporary roof was installed after
the fire, but without a third floor to hold the building together
the mortar between the massive gray stones of the front wall lost
its grip. The wall had been leaning since at least 1850, but
daylight now showed through the corners.
   Crews installing inch-thick rods to tie the front wall to the
back discovered a new problem: asbestos, used in renovations years
ago. That prompted the state fire marshal to check not only the
Cabildo but other nearby museum buildings and order $1.2 million in
repairs.
   Insurance covers $4 million in fire damage but not the ordered
renovations, so State Museum Director James Sefcik is looking to
the state _ at a time when Gov. Buddy Roemer is trying to cut $700
million from the state budget.
   But Sefcik is confident he can get the $1.2 million. It's not
new money, he said, but funds left over from other State Museum
capital projects.
   ``It doesn't add to the burden that the Legislature is facing at
all. It's money that is there from the past,'' he said. He is
worried, though, about cuts proposed by Roemer, who has said all
agencies not protected by the state constitution must slash their
budgets by one-quarter.
   ``Those budget cuts are devastating,'' Sefcik said. ``They'll
effectively destroy the State Museum system if they go through the
way they've been proposed. I don't want to be the guy who has to
lay off 25 people.
   ``The amount of money involved isn't that big. We're talking
about the cultural heritage of this state. It's got to be worth a
couple million dollars.
   ``If it's not, I'm in the wrong business.''
   Meanwhile, Sefcik is asking for $2 million in donations to
refurbish and improve exhibits in the State Museum buildings near
Jackson Square.
   New exhibits, in Sefcik's plans, include getting someone to
develop a video game based on the 1815 Battle of New Orleans, which
actually occurred after the War of 1812 was officially over. ``The
visitors will represent the British and have to attack Andrew
Jackson's position as it was at the time of the battle. They will
discover what the British were up against and will understand why
Jackson chose that spot and why the British lost.''
   Other planned exhibits include plantations, Louisiana's early
and colonial history and the Cabildo itself, he said. ``One of the
problems we have is that so much history took place in the Cabildo
that is germane to New Orleans and to Louisiana and to the United
States that I wish we had twice as much space, because it all
deserves telling.''
   New Orleans was under Spanish rule when the Casa Cabildo, or
town hall, was built in the 1790s on the site of a police station.
Fire had destroyed the roof and woodwork of the Corps de Garde in
1788 and 1794, but its heavy brick walls and floor remained and
were incorporated into the much larger Cabildo.
   After 1803, when the Louisiana Purchase doubled the size of the
United States, the Cabildo housed the Government of the Territory
of New Orleans. The Louisiana Supreme Court and municipal police
station moved in 50 years later.
   Plessy vs. Ferguson, the case that established the ``separate
but equal'' racial doctrine that stood until 1954, was among the
many cases heard there.
   Sefcik figures it will take about 18 months to develop the
exhibits, but the work can't start until the money is in hand. He
hopes to reopen the Cabildo in the first half of 1991.
   The combination of publicity about the Cabildo because of the
fire and the new exhibits should boost the number of visitors from
about 150,000 a year to about 250,000, he said. When all of the
Jackson Square complex is open, he figures the number could be a
million.
   ``As tragic as the Cabildo fire was _ and I don't ever want to
go through anything like that again _ I think in many ways it will
be looked upon as one of the best things that happened in the
history of the State Museum,'' he said.
   ``It has forced people to take a second look at something they
took for granted, to understand that all of these resources are
precious, are special, deserve better care than perhaps they had
been given.''

   Dan Rather has gotten out his traveling shoes
again. CBS, apparently well-pleased with its February road trip to
Japan, is going to China next week for the summit meeting between
Mikhail Gorbachev and Deng Xiaoping.
   ``If this isn't a big story, what is?'' said Rather, who
anchored an ambitious week of coverage in Japan that cost an
estimated $2 million and involved almost all the news division's
broadcasts.
   ABC, NBC and CNN also sent their anchors and contingents of
correspondents to Japan for the state funeral of Emperor Hirohito.
This time, CNN is sending its Washington anchor, Bernard Shaw, to
China, but NBC's Tom Brokaw and ABC's Peter Jennings will stay in
New York. ABC has announced Jennings will go to Europe later this
month when President Bush meets with NATO leaders.
   For China, CBS is sending Rather to anchor the ``CBS Evening
News'' from Beijing. Sunday's ``CBS Sunday Morning'' also will
originate from China. Rather and Charles Kuralt will anchor the
coverage. ``CBS This Morning'' and ``48 Hours'' went to Japan, but
will stay put this time.
   Rather said in a telephone interview that even though fewer
programs are going along, the China sojourn rivals the Japan road
trip in budget and scale because of the added logistical
complications of covering sprawling China.
   Since the Japan trip, CBS has suffered a blow to its prestige,
losing ``60 Minutes'' star Diane Sawyer to ABC, and there's
certainly a prestige boost in anchoring from an exotic locale when
your competitors are back home in midtown Manhattan.
   Rather sees the trip, however, in a larger context.
   ``This kind of thing is a real important part of our future,''
he said. ``I think if you ask yourself the question, which it seems
to me gets asked about every hour these days, is there any future
for network news? I think the answer is yes. And the next question
is, if so, what is it? And I think the answer, or part of it, is
keeping a real presence in the worldwide news-gathering business,
not just news packaging, but news gathering.''
   CBS will try to improve on the Japan trip with more emphasis on
``man-in-the-street'' coverage. That won't be as easy in China as
in Japan.
   ``The Chinese have given us extraordinary access, and they've
been as good as their word,'' said Rather. ``This was not always
true in the past with previous communist regimes there, but I will
say that when they've made agreements, up to now they've kept their
word, and they have given us what is for them extraordinary access.
And it hasn't been particularly easy these last weeks with what's
been going on there.''
   There have been major student protests in recent weeks calling
for more democracy in China.
   Rather pulled out a metaphor from the works of Texas novelist
Dan Jenkins to describe the China trip, likening CBS to the
character ``Astronaut'' Jones who would go to a local basketball
court, shout, ``Trying one!'' then shoot from 40 feet out. ``We're
trying one,'' Rather said.

   Elsewhere in television:
   SPENCER: NOT FOR HIRE _ CBS medical correspondent Susan Spencer
has re-upped with the network. Her new contract includes a
promotion to national correspondent. With the recent moves of
big-name correspondents Diane Sawyer and Connie Chung, the
respected Spencer was no doubt in demand. In announcing her new
contract, CBS News President David Burke praised Spencer's ``class
and professionalism'' and said she is ``at the center of our plans
for the future.'' ...
   CALL HIM DR. HUGHES _ Actor Barnard Hughes will receive an
honorary doctorate from his alma mater Manhattan College in
Riverdale, N.Y., on May 24. Hughes, a stage and film actor, starred
in the CBS sitcom ``The Cavanaughs'' and this season in the
made-for-TV films ``Day One'' and ``Guts &amp; Glory: The Rise and Fall
of Oliver North.'' ...
   CATCH UP ON EXXON JOKES _ The Center for Media and Public
Affairs, a media watchdog group that also keeps us up-to-date on
monologues we might have missed, found the Exxon oil spill to be
the most popular joke fodder of late-night quipsters Johnny Carson,
Jay Leno and David Letterman last month. Some samples: Carson said
Exxon's new slogan was ``We're not as bad as Union Carbide.''
Letterman's Top 10 list of new Exxon slogans included, ``If it
weren't for us, American seagulls would be covered with foreign
oil!'' and ``Anybody got a tissue?'' Leno noted that, ``Now you can
get fish sticks in leaded and unleaded.'' The joke samples were
part of a rather more serious analysis of news media coverage of
the oil spill.

<HEAD>National Trust Goal Urban Renewal, not Urban Removal</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It sounds like a place of musty closets _
quiet, passive and probably pretty dull. That is not at all what J.
Jackson Walter has in mind or on his agenda at the National Trust
for Historic Preservation.
   Walter figures that preserving the past doesn't require living
in it.
   So as president of the National Trust, he is lobbyist,
cheerleader and traveling salesman for what he sees as an effort to
build America's past into its future. By his reckoning, the
preservation movement is the most active and effective force in
rebuilding and reviving American cities in 1989.
   Urban renewal tore down what was there and tried to replace it
with something new. ``The movement,'' as Walter calls it, seeks to
revive what is there and put it back to use. He maintains that
works better because people prefer to live, shop and work in
neighborhoods and places they know, in buildings with a flavor of
history about them.
   Rebuilding, with the emphasis on creating housing and facilities
for moderate- and low-income Americans, is only part of ``the
movement.''
   It sometimes blocks bulldozers, and Walter boasts of a leading
role in opposing development of a suburban shopping mall on part of
the Civil War battlefield at Manassas, Va., adjacent to the
national park that already protects the main site of the battle.
Congress voted late last year to buy the land involved.
   That and such measures as a 1988 law to protect historic
shipwrecks, and scores of traditional projects to guard and
maintain historic sites fit one image of the preservationists, as a
movement pursuing worthy projects that really don't have much to do
with everyday life.
   But the same people who fought off the Manassas mall are taking
lessons from the people who build and run malls, and applying them
to the rescue and revival of shopping districts, many of them
shuttered for loss of customers to suburban shopping centers and
discount houses.
   The Main Street project provides advice and in some cases
support for projects in 30 states, from rural downtowns to old but
reviving business districts in cities like Boston and Pittsburgh.
Part of the advice is that neighborhood merchants change their old
ways and adopt the techniques of the malls such as opening and
closing the shops at the same hours, and cooperating on advertising
and promotions.
   The National Trust's programs provide loans and grants that
emphasize restoration for more than its own sake, with refurbished
buildings providing housing, community centers and commercial
space. They don't add up to a lot of units, but as Walter notes,
any dent in the problem helps, especially in the era of the budget
crisis.
   A sampling of buildings that Trust programs have helped preserve:
   _A hotel in San Francisco's Chinatown, which now provides
housing and a community center for elderly tenants living on low
fixed incomes.
   _An 1874 municipal building in the Dorchester section of Boston,
to be converted into apartments, offices and shops.
   _A Brooklyn convent, built in 1889, now to become 11 low and
moderate income apartments.
   _A former YMCA in Newport, R.I., which is to be rebuilt as
low-income housing and a shelter for the homeless.
   The National Trust has a $26 million budget this year, a speck
in federal budget terms. Just under a fifth of the money comes from
the government, the rest from contributions and the dues of about
220,000 members.
   Walter, 48, has headed the national trust for five years,
lengthy tenure on the resume of a man who has been a Boston lawyer,
a Florida state official, director of the Office of Government
Ethics under two presidents, Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan, and
head of the National Academy of Public Administration.
   He'll need all of his insider's skills as he lobbies to undo
limits on the credits a taxpayer can claim for investing in
historic rehabilitation or low-income housing. Without the tax
incentive, investment in the restoration of historic buildings has
plunged by about 60 percent.
   Putting it back would cost about $200 million a year, and that's
not likely to be a popular prospect in the current budget crunch.

   House tax-writers rejected President Bush's
savings and loan bailout plan, approving an alternative that
threatens to swell the federal deficit over the next three years by
$43 billion to $50 billion and possibly force a veto showdown with
the White House.
   The House Ways and Means Committee, with 2 of 13 Republicans
joining its 23 Democrats, voted 25-11 Wednesday to include the
government's full $50 billion share of the most massive corporate
bailout in history in the fiscal 1989, 1990 and 1991 budgets.

   One of the most influential players in Wall
Street's commodity markets has been subpoenaed in the government
probe of possible trading abuses, but he said investigators
indicated he isn't a target.
   Paul Tudor Jones II, whose trading firm manages more than $500
million in commodity funds, said Wednesday he was cooperating with
the Commodity Futures Trading Commission in its civil investigation
of trading practices on four New York futures exchanges.
   Another trader, Craig W. Effron, has been subpoenaed by a
federal grand jury in a criminal investigation headed by Manhattan
U.S. attorney's office into possibly illegal trading practices on
the markets, his lawyer said Wednesday.
   Effron is the first trader to be publicly named as receiving a
grand jury subpoena. He reportedly is not a target of the criminal
probe.
   The inquiries are separate from a criminal investigation by the
Justice Department into allegedly widespread fraudulent trading
practices on the Chicago Board of Trade and Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, the nation's largest commodity markets.
   Jones, 34, is chairman of Tudor Investment Corp., which he
founded in 1984 and is considered the most prominent among more
than 50 traders from whom federal investigators have requested
information. The firm also was subpoenaed.
   The subpoenas, which reportedly were delivered last week, do not
imply any wrongdoing.
   Tudor president Mark Dalton issued a statement that Jones and
the firm ``were among the many traders and firms that received
civil subpoenas to provide information in connection with a CFTC
investigation of others.''
   ``Mr. Jones and Tudor understand that they are not the subject
of the investigation,'' he said. Dalton would not say whether the
government told the firm and Jones they were not targets.
   Market sources, who asked not to be named, also said Jones was
not a target.
   The CFTC reportedly is seeking information on Jones' dealings
with Mark B. Fisher and Effron, two futures traders who have been
mentioned as possible targets.
   U.S. Postal Service inspectors one week ago raided Fisher's
offices at the commodity exchanges as part of a federal grand jury
criminal investigation. His attorneys have denied any wrongdoing.
   Effron, 29, has been subpoenaed by the federal grand jury and
the CFTC, said his lawyer, Howard Schneider.
   ``In the grand jury probe they've indicated he is not a
target,'' Schneider said, ``and the CFTC hasn't indicated
anything.''
   Another reported target is Preston H. Semel, who runs a
brokerage in gold, silver and other commodities and was fined by
the New York Mercantile Exchange for an alleged trading scheme with
Fisher in 1985. Semel has refused to comment or provide the name of
his attorney.
   Jones, whose firm manages money for 15,000 customers, is a
director of the Futures Industry Association and board member of
the Cotton Exchange, where he reportedly made most of his money. He
also conducts ethics training classes with a former CFTC chairman
and is highly regarded in the industry.
   He runs a highly successful publicly offered futures fund, one
of what are known as commodity pools, in which a group of futures
investors pool funds run by money managers.
   A person familiar with the CFTC's order of investigation said
Wednesday it includes review of possible violations of rules
governing commodity pools. Under CFTC guidelines, those could
include use of customer funds for personal accounts or failing to
provide customers with necessary disclosure documents.
   The CFTC probe also reportedly examines violations that include
pre-arranged trading, use of advanced knowledge of customer trades
to trade for personal accounts and conducting of trades in order to
skirt tax obligations.
   The government has subpoenaed the Cotton Exchange, the New York
Mercantile Exchange, the Commodity Exchange and the Coffee, Sugar
and Cocoa Exchange seeking information on brokers. It also has
directly subpoenaed at least 26 traders.

<HEAD>District's Problems Described as `Quite Insignificant'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN P. ROSENFELD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The problems remaining at savings and
loans in Iowa and four nearby states are insignificant when
compared with the troubles besetting the industry nationwide, a
federal regulator reports.
   ``Our members have a stronger position to work from than some
other regions,'' Thurman Connell, president of the Federal Home
Loan Bank of Des Moines, said in the bank's annual report. The Des
Moines office oversees thrift institutions in Iowa, Minnesota,
Missouri and North and South Dakota.
   The report also said that while overall operations were
unprofitable last year for the 176 savings and loans in the
district, combined outflows of deposits from those institutions
fell more than 25 percent from a year earlier and assets climbed to
record heights for a third straight year. It said that with most of
the district's previously insolvent thrifts in new, more secure
hands this year, there was an improved earnings outlook for 1989.
   The report was distributed as Congress wrestled with how to
finance the $50 billion cash infusion for savings and loan rescues
proposed by President Bush.
   ``Unfortunately for our five-state area, the president's plan
for resolving the troubles of the nation's thrift industry came
after the majority of District Eight insolvencies had been
resolved,'' Connell said. ``The remaining problems in the Eighth
District look quite insignificant when taken in a national
context.''
   The Des Moines district found new owners for 17 insolvent
thrifts last year, leaving just eight troubled institutions in the
region. Seven of those insolvent thrifts already have been placed
under federal conservatorship awaiting completion of congressional
action, and the eighth is scheduled for the same attention, said
Hassan Honarmand, a district spokesman.
   There are four Missouri problem thrifts, two in Iowa and one in
Minnesota now under the supervision of the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp.
   They are Midwest Federal Savings and Loan in Minneapolis; Sioux
Valley Savings and Loan of Cherokee and First Federal Savings and
Loan of Estherville in Iowa; and Blue Valley Savings and Loan in
Kansas City, Cass Federal Savings and Loan of St. Louis, Financial
Federal Savings and Loan of Joplin and First Federal Savings and
Loan of Southeast Missouri in Cape Girardeau all in Missouri.
   Honarmand said a state-chartered S&amp;L in Missouri, which he would
not further identify, would be placed under federal conservatorship
later this year.
   Nationwide, about 350 thrifts are listed as insolvent by the
Federal Home Loan Bank Board, while another 250 are described as
solvent but in need of government help. In 1988, 223 thrifts were
closed or rescued across the country.
   The Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines said 80 percent of its
member institutions were profitable last year and improved from
their performance of a year earlier. But widening losses at the
remaining institutions far offset those gains.
   Overall, thrifts in the Des Moines district posted a loss of 92
cents for each $100 in assets in 1988, close to the national
performance of a loss of 94 cents per $100.
   This widely recognized measure of profitability is called return
on average assets.
   For example, 43 thrifts in the district, representing the top 25
percent, posted what the agency called an ``exceptional'' return on
average assets of $1.10 for each $100. That compared with $1 in
profit for each $100 in assets a year earlier. But the bottom
quarter had combined losses of $4.06 for each $100 in assets in
1988, sharply higher than the overall losses of $1.40 for each $100
in assets for the same group in 1987.
   The district regulates 82 thrifts in Missouri, 45 in Iowa, 32 in
Minnesota, 12 in South Dakota and 6 in North Dakota.
   Connell said it appeared that consumer confidence has remained
fairly stable in the district.
   Despite the widespread coverage of the crisis in the thrift
industry, deposit outflows from member thrifts in the district fell
last year.
   Withdrawals exceeded deposits by $1.7 billion overall last year
in the district, but that was down from $2.3 billion in 1987. And
Honarmand said that when accumulated interest earnings were added
to the deposits remaining at district thrifts, there was a net
increase in deposits of $840 million last year.
   ``Most depositors are loyal to their local institutions and want
to continue doing business with them,'' Connell said. ``The bottom
line in the thrift industry is public confidence.''

<HEAD>Bidder Gets Extension for Eastern Offer; America West Ups Shuttle
Offer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal bankruptcy court extended its bidding
deadline for Eastern Airlines for at least one potential suitor,
while a bidder for Eastern's lucrative Northeast shuttle raised its
offer and another airline offered to buy other assets.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland extended Wednesday's 5
p.m. EDT bidding deadline for an investor group led by Joseph
Ritchie, a prominent Chicago commodities trader, to give it more
time to receive financial information from strikebound Eastern.
   Separately, America West Airlines Inc. said it would pay a total
of $751 million for the Boston-New York-Washington shuttle and 10
Boeing 757 airliners, raising by $25 million the cash portion of
its initial $726 million bid.
   That price also would top a rival $365 million offer that
Eastern has accepted from developer Donald Trump for the shuttle.
   In another development, Eastern rival USAir Inc. offered $525
million for certain Eastern assets, including 15 Boeing 757s and
related equipment, ground facilities, airport landing slots and
three U.S.-Canadian routes.
   In a statement, USAir said its offer was for spare engines,
flight training simulators and other hardware related to the Boeing
757s; Eastern's maintenance hangars in Boston and Miami; airport
gates in 10 cities already served by USAir and its Piedmont
Airlines unit; and U.S.-Canadian routes between Pittsburgh and
Toronto, Baltimore-Washington and Ottawa, and Baltimore-Washington
and Montreal.
   Miami-based Eastern has been under Chapter 11 protection from
creditors since March 9, five days after the start of a Machinists
union strike supported by pilots and flight attendants that
virtually grounded the airline.
   The bankruptcy court must approve any sale of Eastern or any of
its businesses, such as the Northeast shuttle.
   Lifland has pushed for a sale as a means for returning the
carrier to full operations as soon as possible. Eastern insists the
airline is not for sale and is proceeding with a plan to rebuild as
a smaller carrier and raise $1.8 billion by selling aircraft and
other assets.
   The deal to sell the shuttle and its 21 Boeing 727 jetliners to
Trump still awaits the court's approval. Lifland scheduled a Monday
hearing on that deal.
   America West, a regional carrier based in Phoenix, Ariz., last
week submitted a $726 million offer for the shuttle and 10 Boeing
757 jetliners. Under its revised offer, America West stated it
would pay $415 million cash for the shuttle assets with the balance
paid in cash and assumption of obligations on the 10 airliners.
   Eastern spokesman Robin Matell said in a phone interview from
Miami that although the airline had a deal with Trump, ``...we also
have a responsibility to evaluate other proposals'' and would
review the America West offer.
   Bruce Nobles, president of the Trump Shuttle, said the latest
America West offer did not affect Trump's position.
   ``We have a deal with Eastern,'' said Nobles. ``We have a blank
check sitting here waiting to be filled in.''
   Billionaire hotel executive Jay Pritzker already has proposed
buying all of Eastern for around $500 million, although he had not
previously submitted a formal offer, according to sources close to
the situation. An investor group led by William Howard, the former
chairman of Piedmont Airlines, also has expressed interest in
making a buyout proposal.
   The chairman of the committee representing Eastern's major
creditors confirmed Wednesday that bids were expected from the
Ritchie and Howard groups. Alan Boyd, chairman of Airbus Industrie
of North America, said neither consortium has detailed its
financing plans to the creditors.
   Neither Pritzker nor the Howard group would confirm whether they
had made firm proposals to the bankruptcy court by Wednesday.
   Another potential buyer who previously expressed interest,
takeover strategist Carl C. Icahn, had backed off a bit on Tuesday.
Trans World Airlines Inc., which is owned by Icahn, stated it
needed more time to discuss with its unions the feasibility of
integrating the TWA and Eastern workforces and was not prepared to
submit a formal bid for Eastern at this time.
   Icahn has held discussions with officials of Eastern's unions.
Last Friday, he informed the court of his interest in buying
Eastern's Philadelphia airport hub.
   Former baseball commissioner Peter V. Ueberroth, whose $464
million deal to buy Eastern collapsed in mid-April, was still
interested in acquiring the airline, sources close to Ueberroth
said Wednesday. However, it was unclear whether he would come forth
with a firm new buyout plan, the sources said.
   Following a recommendation by bankruptcy examiner David I.
Shapiro, Lifland decided that any bids submitted after Wednesday's
deadline would be disqualified except ``for good cause shown.''
   Lifland granted the two-day extension to Ritchie's group because
confidential Eastern financial data sought by the group was
accidentally sent to the wrong person, according to Harvey Miller,
Eastern's lead bankruptcy attorney. Ritchie is chairman of CRT
Group, a futures and options trading company based in Chicago.
   It was not immediately clear under what conditions Lifland would
accept late bids by others. Lifland, Shapiro and the principals of
the bidding groups did not return phone calls Wednesday seeking
comment.

   The second attempt to turn America's
best-known house of ill repute into the country's first
publicly-owned bordello has stalled after the stock offering fell
$5 million short of its goal.
   Eric Walloga, whose American Wallstreet Securities Inc. is
underwriting the sale, said Wednesday his company had negotiated an
extension of the sale of stock in the Mustang Ranch until Oct. 31
to allow time to restructure the offer.
   In the meantime, the sale of common stock in Mustang Ranch, Inc.
has been halted and all the money received for the shares so far
will be returned to investors, Walloga said in a statement released
by his office in Tampa, Fla.
   ``The rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission ...
require that we make this move,'' he said. Walloga, the president
of American Wallstreet, was out of the office Wednesday and
unavailable for comment.
   Wednesday was the deadline for the three-month-old bid to take
the Mustang Ranch public through a $23.3 million stock offering at
$20 a share. Walloga said last week about 75 percent of the 1.165
million shares had been sold, leaving the company with a $5 million
shortfall.
   Walloga's statement said an amendment would be filed with the
SEC and the states that have approved sale of the stock to reflect
the terms of the new deal, which Walloga said would change the
types of securities Mustang Ranch Inc. would offer.
   ``No details of the newly structured offering could be released
at this time pending a response from the SEC to a request for an
interpretive ruling concerning a technical issue which arose in
developing the amendment to the offering,'' the statement said.
   Peter Perry, a Reno attorney and vice president of Mustang Ranch
Inc., said in the statement he expected the amendment to the
registration to be filed with the SEC by June 15.
   Perry would not comment specifically on the offer, citing SEC
rules which forbid parties in a stock offering to discuss them.
   Mustang Ranch Inc. is an investors' group composed primarily of
Reno businessmen and attorneys who are making a second attempt to
turn the brothel public.
   A 1985 bid by Strong Point, Inc., led by John Davis of Irvine,
Calif., fell through after failing to generate enough interest in
the $18 million proposal.
   The money raised in the current sale was to have provided $13
million to buy the 102-room brothel and its 440 acres of land from
Joe and Sally Conforte, $5 million in exchange for the Confortes'
promise not to set up a competing brothel and $5.3 million for
expansion, improvements and working capital.
   Conforte has been trying to sell the brothel 10 miles east of
Reno since 1985 when he was released from prison after serving 18
months on a tax conviction.
   He has said he expects most of the money from the sale to go to
the federal government in payment of his long-standing tax debt
plus the hefty interest and penalties it has run up.

<HEAD>Entrepreneur's Idea For Gym Gear Odor-Cutter Brings Quick Success</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE WHEELAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The stinky inspiration for Sneaker Balls came to
entrepreneur Dennis Green two years ago after his wife complained
about an aroma in his car.
   ``She said she borrowed my car and it sure smelled bad. She said
it was the gym bag in the back seat,'' said Green, an athletic
45-year-old who plays basketball regularly.
   ``It just hit me all of a sudden _ there's a product there. Not
something to freshen the car, but to freshen the bag so it wouldn't
smell the car up,'' he said.
   That brainstorm spawned Sneaker Balls _ fragrance discs encased
in colorful pingpong-size balls made of recycled plastic soft drink
bottles. Green's invention is designed to cut the odor of moldy gym
bags, rancid tennis shoes and sweaty lockers for up to three months.
   Each Sneaker Ball exudes a fragrance and an odor-blocker, which
floods the olfactory receptors of the brain so they cannot smell
sweat, Green says. The chemicals are released by twisting the balls
to open slots cut into the sides.
   According to their motto, Sneaker Balls have ``The Courage To Go
Where The Ugly Stuff Grows.''
   It sounds like a funny idea, but since Sneaker Balls hit the
market in July 1988, Green's company, Dennis Green Design Group
Ltd, has sold 1.5 million at $2.50 to $4 apiece. A new Sneaker Ball
design will debut later this year, and the back orders already
total 5 million.
   Green's business comes from most of the big U.S. discount store
chains and athletic footwear retailers and from stores in Canada,
Mexico, Europe and Asia.
   But Green isn't in the factory all day, supervising production _
he's at home, writing fiction.
   ``I have one philosophy in business, and that is that I want to
write books, and if I have employees I can't very well do that,''
he said.
   For that reason, Green has subcontracted the entire Sneaker
Balls manufacturing and distribution operation to a Loveland, Colo.
company called New Systems Molding.
   About 50 employees at the New Systems plant work
around-the-clock, molding Sneaker Balls and assembling them. Green
expects the work force to double within six months.
   Green is a trained architect who grew bored with his profession
and began designing and selling his own line of greeting cards.
Within five years, Green and his wife were designing and selling
greeting cards across the United States and in 24 other countries.
   In 1981, they sold the business so Green could write, but the
new owners went bankrupt three years later, Green's income stopped
and he went back to designing and selling cards _ until his wife's
complaint gave him the idea for Sneaker Balls.
   Green said it took a year to make a prototype of Sneaker Balls
that he could display to potential investors.
   ``I began doing research. I didn't know anything about
fragrances or plastics either,'' he said. ``I made the prototype by
stuffing fragrance in cotton balls because I didn't know anything
about fragrance discs. I put them in my bag when I worked out. I
put them in my shoes when I wasn't working out.''
   In a locker room one day, someone noticed Green's Sneaker Balls
and asked him about them. The man, who was a broker, signed an
option agreement with Green that led to a contract with an investor
group.
   But that was a false start _ the investors made the first
payment, but not the next two. Green took Sneaker Balls to a trade
show and immediately found a distributor who got him a contract
with K mart Corp.
   Four months later, in July 1988, he began shipping Sneaker Balls
to customers.
   Now Green spends his mornings writing fiction, and his
afternoons attending to business and playing basketball, a
carryover from his days at Boise State College in Idaho, where he
was a starting forward.
   And, as business booms, he's also finished his first novel:
``Double Bind,'' a psychological thriller about a Washington
journalist.

   Employees of Continental Can Co. are
entitled to pension benefits they were systematically cheated out
of by top company brass, a federal judge has ruled.
   U.S. District Judge H. Lee Sarokin said Wednesday Continental
Can developed a secret and sophisticated computer program used
nationwide to keep longtime employees from becoming vested in
pension programs.
   An attorney for the workers said the judge's remarks proved the
company's actions have been deplorable and said it could lead to
individual awards that exceed $100,000 each to some workers and
total more than $500 million.
   In a sharply-worded opinion against the company, Sarokin
directed Continental Can to begin negotiating settlements with
about 2,500 Continental workers.
   ``The plan was shrouded in secrecy and executed company-wide at
the specific direction of the highest levels of corporate
management,'' Sarokin said in a written opinion.
   ``It was intended to save hundreds of millions of dollars in
unfunded pension liabilities,'' he continued. ``The evidence of the
plan, its secrecy and its execution comes from the files of the
defendants themselves. The documents are more than a smoking gun;
they are a fusillade.''
   The case Sarokin heard specifically covered 315 layoffs at a St.
Louis plant, and 43 of the company's other 45 plants conceivably
could have had their cases heard individually.
   A suit on behalf of a Los Angeles plant was won by the
employees; a suit filed on behalf of Pittsburgh employees is still
in litigation.
   But Sarokin said in his ruling that there was no need to hear
the other cases against Continental, based in Norwalk, Conn.
   ``What the judge has said is that this should end all the cases
everywhere,'' said Robert Plotkin, an attorney for the workers.
   ``This is not a case of a class-action suit where plaintiffs
each have a claim to $10,'' he continued. ``What we're talking here
is, you have many former employees who have individual claims worth
in excess of $100,000.''
   Attorney Douglas G. Eakeley of Chicago, who represented
Continental Can, did not immediately return phone messages. A
secretary in his office said she would leave a message for Eakeley
and two associates working on the case.
   The benefits in question were special ``magic number'' pensions
negotiated in 1977 by the United Steelworkers for employees subject
to periodic layoffs. They were designed to protect employees with
long years of service who had not yet reached normal retirement age.
   But attorneys for the workers have maintained, and the judge
agreed, that Continental management adopted a secret computerized
plan to prevent employees from vesting in the costly pensions by
laying them off before they became eligible.
   The federal pension law, the Employee Retirement Income Security
Act, prohibits employers from taking any action against workers for
the purpose of interfering with their pensions.
   ``For a corporation of this magnitude to engage in a complex,
secret and deliberate scheme to deny its workers bargained-for
pension benefits raises questions of corporate morality, ethics and
decency which far transcend the factual and legal issues posed by
this matter,'' the judge said.
   Plotkin said Sarokin's ruling should persuade the company not to
drag the suit on, but that he wasn't counting on it.
   ``Continental's continued efforts to avoid its obligations to
those employees any way it can are deplorable,'' he said.
   Company attorneys had argued there was no secret plan in place,
and that even if there were, the employees would have been laid off
anyway.
   Sarokin rejected that argument. He appointed George L. Priest, a
professor at Yale Law School, to assist the two sides in settling
individual claims, and he ordered the money to be paid promptly.
   ``The class members are entitled to compensation while they are
still in a position to enjoy it,'' the judge said. ``They are
entitled to the benefits for which they bargained for and for which
they worked.''

   Occidental Petroleum Corp. Chairman Armand
Hammer _ whose art collection includes works by Leonardo da Vinci
and Impressionists _ is wasting millions of dollars in company
funds on ``self-aggrandizing'' plans for a Hammer Museum of Art,
shareholders charged in two lawsuits.
   The suits, which became public Wednesday in Delaware Chancery
Court, seek court orders blocking further Occidental spending on
the planned museum, requiring return of money already committed and
canceling Hammer's employment contract with Occidental.
   ``Defendant Dr. Hammer has breached his duty of loyalty to
Occidental and its stockholders by instigating and forcing
Occidental to participate in his personal plan of
self-aggrandizement in creating his own personal museum,'' one suit
says.
   The 91-year-old Hammer, who carefully cultivates a media image
of international philanthropist and unofficial business envoy to
the Soviet Union, will fight the allegations as ``totally without
merit,'' a company spokesman said.
   The lawsuits, filed in the state where the oil-and-chemical
giant is incorporated, name both Occidental and its directors,
including Hammer, as defendants.
   The actions center on a first-quarter expense of $36 million to
purchase an annuity to fund the planned museum, on rent-free use of
company office space for museum purposes and on a corporate
commitment to fund construction of a building for the museum at a
cost estimated at $30 million to $50 million.
   Requests for a Hammer response were referred to Philadelphia
attorney Bruce Kauffman, who represents a special committee of the
Occidental board that approved the museum support.
   Kauffman said Occidental directors acted well within the law and
in keeping with their duty to the corporation in approving
charitable spending that would enhance the company's standing in
the community.
   ``All kinds of companies choose to spread their good will in
different ways,'' Kauffman said. ``We choose to spread our good
will in a way that will benefit hundreds of thousands of people. To
say for one minute that this is not going to benefit Occidental is,
in my opinion, just ridiculous.''
   One suit was filed by Alan R. Kahn, trustee for the estate of
Samuel Adason Jaffe, which holds 700 Occidental shares; the other
by Joseph Sullivan and Alan I. Brody, who describe themselves as
Occidental shareholders without detailing their holdings.
   They seek injunctions that, among other things, would bar
further Occidental support of the museum, including rent-free use
of company buildings; cancel compensation to Hammer; and require an
accounting of any losses the company incurred in connection with
the museum.
   They also allege that proxy material mailed to shareholders for
the company's upcoming annual meeting was misleading about the $36
million expenditure for the museum, including it as unallocated
corporate expenses.
   The Sullivan-Brody suit paints a particularly unflattering
portrait of Occidental's chairman and chief executive officer in
detailing a dispute with the Los Angeles County Museum of Art over
the future of his personal collection, said to be worth $250
million to $400 million.
   The collection includes works by Dutch, Flemish, German and
Italian masters; Impressionist works and a codex, or book of notes
and drawings by da Vinci.
   Last year, Hammer canceled what the museum portrayed as a
promise to donate his art to the county when museum officials
rejected conditions including posting a full-length portrait of the
industrialist at the entrance to the exhibit.
   Other conditions unacceptable to the museum, according the suit:
That the collection be kept intact forever and displayed under
Hammer's name; that names of other museum benefactors be removed
from galleries displaying Hammer's art; that the collection get a
special curator answerable to a Hammer foundation rather than to
the museum.
   The dispute led to Hammer's plan to build his own museum, the
suit says, adding: ``Unlike other wealthy collectors, Dr. Hammer
does not plan to build `his own museum' with his own ample funds.
Rather, Dr. Hammer is requiring Occidental to provide substantially
all the financial support.''
   Company attorney Kauffman disputed at least part of that, noting
the considerable value of the collection Hammer intended to
contribute to the project.
   Hammer, whose 1987 pay was $1.9 million, has held sway over
Occidental since 1957.
   Based on contacts he made during a post-World War II medical
mercy mission in the Soviet Union, he served as unofficial envoy
for the United States government during the Cold War. As relations
have thawed in recent years, he has led a parade of American
businesses into the Soviet Union, setting up joint ventures for
chemical plants and the like.
   Hammer, who holds a medical degree, has used his connections and
company jet to get American doctors to the scene of various
disasters, including the Chernobyl nuclear accident and the
Armenian earthquake.

<TEXT>
   Convicted stock brokerage founder Boyd L.
Jefferies has taken the witness stand for the third time in a
federal criminal securities law trial, this time saying he engaged
in four unlawful stock deals with Paul A. Bilzerian.
   Testifying Wednesday at Bilzerian's securities fraud trial at
federal court in Manhattan, Jefferies, who said he spoke on the
phone often but only met once with the Singer Co. chairman,
detailed their dealings in four stock transactions in 1985 and 1986.
   Jefferies testified that on four occasions either Bilzerian or
Jefferies' account executive Michael Landy asked him to purchase
large blocks of stock either for or from Bilzerian to hide the
stock's ownership.
   Then the prosecutor, Assistant U.S. Attorney David Brodsky,
asked Jefferies if he considered each deal ``lawful or unlawful.''
   ``Unlawful,'' Jefferies said four times.
   The indictment alleges that Jefferies, who founded the Los
Angeles-based brokerage house, Jefferies &amp; Co., secretly held stock
for Bilzerian in four unsuccessful takeover transactions involving
Cluett, Peabody &amp; Co., Hammerhill Paper Co., H.H. Robertson Co.,
and Armco Inc.
   The ruse allegedly was used to help Bilzerian secretly
accumulate large stock positions in companies he later would
attempt to take over.
   But on cross examination, defense attorney Arthur Mathews asked
Jefferies if he intended ``to commit any crimes in any transactions
with Mr. Bilzerian?''
   ``No,'' replied Jefferies, who earlier said he pleaded guilty to
two felony counts in a plea bargain with prosecutors.
   Bilzerian, 38, of Tampa, Fla., is accused of conspiracy,
violating securities and tax laws and making false statements in
connection with four failed takeover attempts in 1985 and 1986.
   If convicted, Bilzerian faces a maximum pealty of five years in
jail and a $250,000 fine on each count.
   Jefferies, 58, turned government informant in 1987 after he was
turned in by convicted stock speculator Ivan F. Boesky, and has
pleaded guilty to two securities-related felonies.
   He said he faces a maximum 10 years in prison and $500,000 in
fines although prosecutors are supposed to detail his cooperation
to the sentencing judge. Jefferies and his lawyer have said they
don't expect him to serve any prison time.
   It was the third time Jefferies has testified for the government
in a securities fraud case. He twice took the witness stand in the
stock manipulation trial of GAF Corp. and its vice chairman, James
T. Sherwin. Twice that case ended in a mistrial.

   Gary G. Lynch, credited with uncovering Wall
Street's insider trading scandal, says his resignation from the
Securities and Exchange Commission will not detract from the
agency's fraud-fighting effort.
   ``The enforcement program is a very strong program. ... It's
staffed with super professionals. ... I don't think my departure is
going to have much of an effect,'' said Lynch, who announced
Wednesday that he will leave the SEC staff in mid-July.
   A lanky, soft-spoken 38-year-old attorney, Lynch joined the SEC
in 1976, a year after graduating from Duke University Law School.
He became the agency's youngest-ever enforcement director in early
1985.
   He steps down four years later amid a chorus of praise for
playing the central role in breaking open a series of insider
trading cases, beginning with the exposure of stockbroker Dennis
Levine, continuing through a $100 million settlement with
speculator Ivan Boesky and culminating four weeks ago with the
settlement of a massive civil fraud case with junk bond-giant
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., the nation's fifth-largest securities
firm.
   ``He's done extremely well, but the point is the agency will
survive,'' said Stanley Sporkin, a former SEC enforcement chief,
now a federal judge in Washington.
   ``It's a resilient agency and there are no indispensable persons
in life,'' said Sporkin, the man who hired Lynch.
   Lynch took over the enforcement division at a time of turmoil
for the SEC and is credited with restoring morale damaged when his
predecessor, John Fedders, departed amid charges he had beaten his
wife.
   Harvey Pitt, Boesky's attorney and a former SEC general counsel,
said Lynch leaves behind four strong deputies, including Associate
Director John H. Sturc, and all are capable of succeeding him.
   ``I think the SEC's enforcement division is incredibly deep in
talent,'' he said.
   Although some securities lawyers say privately that Lynch
happened to be in the right place at the right time to lead the
crusade against Wall Street greed, Pitt and others say he was
crucial to the effort.
   ``I think his contribution really cannot be overstated,'' Pitt
said. ``He has given direction and leadership to a program that ...
really had not produced anywhere near the results he has now
produced.''
   Lynch is credited with personally piercing the veil of secrecy
surrounding the Bahamas branch of a Swiss bank, where Dennis Levine
maintained an account.
   It was three years ago this Friday that the SEC filed its
charges against Levine, whose cooperation led to Boesky, who in
turn implicated Drexel Burnham in the largest securities fraud case
ever brought by the government.
   Drexel's agreement on the civil case brought by the SEC is
paving the way for it to pay a record $650 million in fines and
restitution to settle criminal charges.
   Other prominent cases credited to Lynch include Martin A.
Siegel, managing director of Drexel, who paid $9 million to settle
civil charges, and Boyd L. Jefferies, who was forced to resign as
head of the Los Angeles firm he founded.
   The scandals uncovered during Lynch's tenure forced Wall
Street's big brokerage houses to re-evaluate their compliance and
ethics codes and led Congress to increase the penalties for insider
trading.
   As a government employee, Lynch worked 11-hour days and
weekends, earning an annual salary of about $72,000, far less than
he could earn in private practice. But neither the salary nor the
long hours played a major role in his decision to leave, he said.
Lynch said he has made no specific plans for his future.
   On Capitol Hill, Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of the
House Energy and Commerce Committee which oversees the SEC, and a
frequent critic of the agency, said, ``He'll be missed. He's been a
good public servant whose done a superb job of marshaling limited
resources.''
   The SEC ``is losing a strikingly successful public servant,''
said Rep. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., chairman of the Energy and
Commerce subcommittee on finance.

   The Drought of '88 is now the Drought of
'89 in parts of the Central Plains, and farmers and stockmen are
worried as dry conditions worsen and Congress fails to provide help
this year.
   ``I guess they haven't decided yet we have a disaster,'' said
central Kansas wheat farmer Darwin McCall.
   Drought conditions have led experts to predict the Kansas winter
wheat crop will only make around 200 million bushels, 123 million
bushels fewer than last year, despite a 22 percent increase in
acres seeded. The projected harvest is about half what the crop
should have yielded based on the 12.4 million acres planted in the
fall.
   Analysts say that translates into a $500 million to $800 million
loss to the Kansas economy. Reduced harvests also are expected in
Nebraska, eastern Colorado, Oklahoma and Texas.
   The first official Agriculture Department estimate of the 1989
winter wheat crop was to be released this afternoon.
   The Kansas Livestock Association, the Kansas Association of
Wheat Growers, the Kansas Farm Bureau and the Kansas Farmers Union
have written repeatedly to Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter
seeking help.
   The groups are asking for several breaks for cattlemen.
   ``It would be hard to overstate the severity of the current
situation and the need for an extremely rapid decision on these
requests,'' said Warren Weibert, president of the livestock
association.
   Because there isn't enough pasture or hay, Kansas cattlemen are
selling off cows they use to produce calves for beef slaughter.
Many stockmen have spent years building the genetics in their herds.
   Many producers and Kansas farm groups favor extending the
provisions of the $3.9 billion 1988 drought relief bill to cover
1989 losses.
   Yeutter was asked to take that step by administrative action. He
refused, saying it was up to Congress to act. Several House
measures have been introduced, and a subcommittee of the House
Agriculture Committee has scheduled hearings in Texas and Kansas
May 19 and 20.
   ``The '89 drought is simply an extension of the '88 drought. We
feel farmers in the Midwest should receive the same consideration
for disaster payments in 1989 that corn farmers in the western Corn
Belt received in 1988,'' said Ivan Wyatt, president of the Kansas
Farmers Union.
   Doyle Rahjes, president of the Kansas Farm Bureau, the state's
largest farm group, said the $250 million to $350 million that
drought assistance might cost could be covered by the anticipated
decrease in federal wheat subsidy payments because of the poor crop.
   ``It could be done without affecting the budget hardly at all
because of the deficiency payment reduction,'' Rahjes said. ``We
feel it isn't something that would be a burden to taxpayers.''
   Farmers enrolled in federal grain programs get deficiency
payments to make up the difference between market prices and target
prices set by the Agriculture Department. Since the wheat crop is
poor and market prices are up, the subsidy payments are expected to
cost far less than expected.
   To make the federal bailout pill less bitter, the cattlemen have
proposed cost-sharing projects instead of outright, direct, federal
payments.
   The livestock association wants a retroactive water project
cost-share program and federal help with the costs of transporting
cattle to pasture in nearby states.
   Howard Tice, spokesman for the Kansas Association of Wheat
Growers, said farmers are seeking only enough assistance to cover
their planting costs so they can keep going another year. He said
for many farmers who have struggled back to their financial feet
the past two years the drought could be a knockout punch.
   ``When it comes to keeping farmers in farming and keeping wheat
production going in the largest wheat producing state in the
nation, I really believe there is no doubt Washington is going to
come around and come up with a disaster program to help us out,''
Tice said.

   A new requirement by the Securities and
Exchange Commission making brokerage houses point out contract
language that prevents customers from suing offers too little
protection, a House subcommittee chairman says.
   The commission, by a 5-0 vote Wednesday, approved several rule
changes, including one spurred by complaints from unhappy investors
who discovered after the October 1987 stock crash that they had
signed away their right to sue their brokers.
   Many firms, in the fine print in paperwork to open an account,
require customers to agree in advance to settle any disputes
through industry-administered arbitration proceedings, rather than
through the courts.
   The SEC, under the new rule effective in 120 days, will require
firms to highlight and fully explain arbitration clauses so
investors know what they're signing.
   The commission decided against an outright ban of the clauses.
Some members were reluctant to dictate the terms of contracts
entered into by private parties.
   Also, brokerage firm executives had argued that banning the
clauses could destroy the arbitration system and push more cases
onto the nation's already crowded court dockets.
   ``I regret the SEC ducked the central issues of choice and
voluntariness,'' Rep. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., chairman of the
House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on finance. ``Individual
investors will still be denied the option in many instances of
choosing to go to court instead of arbitration.''
   Arbitration, because it is cheaper and faster than suing in
court, is a good deal for many investors, particularly those with
small claims. But there is only a limited right of appeal and some
investors may be better off in court.
   But SEC Chairman David S. Ruder said enough firms offer cash
accounts without arbitration clauses that investors still have
access to the market even if they want to keep their right to go to
court. However, he warned that the SEC will be checking to see if
more firms start using arbitration clauses.
   The rules governing arbitration have become increasingly
critical following a Supreme Court decision in 1987 that upheld the
validity of arbitration clauses. Also, the number of arbitration
cases has mushroomed from 830 in 1980 to 6,101 last year.
   The SEC, in adopting the changes, acted on proposals from the
New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange and the
National Association of Securities Dealers.
   ``I think they will make the arbitration process better ... and
clear up some of the perception problems that have nagged the
system,'' said commission member Charles Cox.
   Another important change requires the exchanges to keep track of
the amounts of arbitration awards, the amounts originally sought,
the issues in dispute and the brokers and firms involved.
   ``We now for the first time really will be in a position to
effectively monitor the arbitration process,'' said commissioner
Mary Schapiro.
   Other changes are aimed at ensuring that the ``public'' members
of arbitration panels do not have ties to the securities industry,
that arbitrators disclose any ties that may affect their decisions
and that arbitrators get more power to compel brokers and
plaintiffs to turn over relevant documents in a timely manner.

   Spiegel, Land's End and L.L. Bean addicts
beware _ the nation's governors want you to begin paying sales
taxes on your mail-order shopping sprees.
   Governors, joined by state legislators and mayors, are urging
Congress to overturn a 22-year-old Supreme Court decision and
require large mail-order companies to collect sales taxes n sales
to out-of-state customers.
   As a result of that ruling, North Dakota Gov. George Sinner told
a news conference Wednesday, hometown merchants are at a decided
disadvantage and states, cities and counties are losing more than
$1.5 billion a year in tax revenue.
   ``Because state sales taxes run from 5 percent to 8 percent of
the cost of the goods sold, the unfair tax advantage by
out-of-state firms in sales taxes is greater than the average
profit margin of Main Street merchants,'' Sinner said. In fact, he
added, the average hometown merchant's profit margin is less than 3
percent.
   Opponents of the proposal held their own news conference to warn
that consumers won't put up with it.
   ``This will have the maximum irritation effect on tens of
millions of consumers who would have to do the tax calculations
every time they order,'' said Robert Levering, vice president of
the Direct Marketing Association.
   Sen. Robert W. Kasten Jr., R-Wis., whose state is home to Land's
End, added that the bill ``unfairly targets the elderly, the
handicapped, farm families and the millions of consumers who rely
on mail-order purchases for many of their basic needs.''
   Not so, said the National Governors' Association, which chose to
emphasize the bill's effect on well-heeled yuppies:
   ``Many of the goods sold by mail-order firms are expensive,
high-quality, designer-type goods that appeal to young urban
professionals: pastel sweaters, $24 cotton T-shirts, fancy
briefcases, electronic gizmos and exercise or recreational
equipment,'' the association said in a written statement.
   The Supreme Court held in 1967 that a company could not be
required to collect sales taxes on purchases from an out-of-state
company unless that company had a retail outlet in the state.
   Sears and J.C. Penney, for example, collect sales taxes on
catalog orders because they have retail stores in every state. But
Land's End, the giant mail-order clothing company in Wisconsin,
collects no tax on out-of-state shipments because it has no other
outlets.
   The National Governors' Association, the National League of
Cities and other government organizations are supporting a bill to
require large companies to collect tax on shipments to any state in
which they regularly solicit business. Thus, if Land's End shipped
a catalog to Tennessee, that would be interpreted as soliciting and
the company would have to collect the state's sales tax on
Tennessee orders.
   The bill is sponsored by Rep. Jack Brooks, D-Texas, chairman of
the House Judiciary Committee. It would apply only to the estimated
5 percent of mail-order outlets whose sales exceed $12.5 million a
year. But those 5 percent account for 70 percent of mail-order
sales.
   Similar legislation stalled last year, and opponents, led by the
Direct Marketing Association, are geared up for the renewed battle.
   ``If this legislation were to pass, direct marketers would be
saddled with tax collection duties for over 7,000 municipal and
state tax jurisdictions,'' said Levering. ``That means we can be
audited by every one of those jurisdictions, even where our
companies don't have physical presence (in a state) and don't
receive benefits.''
   Across the Capitol, at the session sponsored by backers of the
bill, James Goldberg, counsel for the National Association of
Retail Dealers of America, said most mail-order customers charge
purchases to their credit cards and so would not have to calculate
the sales tax.

   The Environmental Protection Agency is failing
to notify other countries about dangerous pesticides shipped to
them, even though the substances may be used on fruits and
vegetables eaten by Americans, the General Accounting Office said.
   The EPA received repeated warning about such notification more
than a decade ago.
   Western Europe is the biggest market for pesticides, taking 25
percent of world sales, followed by the Far East, which accounts
for 23 percent, according to the report. The fastest growing
markets are India, Brazil, China and Spain.
   The report quoted the EPA's Office of Pesticide Programs as
saying about half the pesticides that Latin American countries
import are bought from the United States. Latin America furnishes a
substantial amount of the fruits and vegetables Americans eat in
the winter.
   ``Not having notices issued could result in continued use in
foreign countries of a pesticide that may damage the health of its
citizens or damage its environment,'' the report said.
   ``Additionally, the crops treated with the pesticide could be
imported into the United States to the detriment of the health of
U.S. citizens and the environment.''
   The report, dated April 25, was sent to Rep. Mike Synar, D-Okla,
chairman of the environment subcommittee in the House Committee on
Government Operations. The General Accounting Office looks into
activities of the administration on behalf of Congress.
   Copies were made available to reporters this week.
   The GAO said U.S. manufacturers had canceled the registration of
four pesticides after the agency started or threatened to start
special reviews because of dangerous effects on humans or
laboratory animals. It found that notices were sent to foreign
governments on only one of these pesticides, called cyhexatin,
saying it could cause birth defects if pregnant women worked in
fields where it was used.
   No notices were sent on the three others _ EPN, captafol and and
carbon tetrachloride, according to the office, which quoted EPA
officials as saying that they only send notices when they feel
there is a health concern.
   According to the report, EPN damages the nerves of laboratory
animals, and captafol gives them tumors and is highly toxic to
fish. It said carbon tetrachloride may cause damage to people's
livers, lungs, kidneys and nervous systems and is regarded by
cancer researchers as a probable cause of cancer.
   In April 1978 the GAO reported that the agency was not making
notifications and therefore not complying with the law. It
recommended the agency work out a system with the State Department
for telling other countries about dangerous pesticides. GAO made
another report the following year.
   ``In the decade since we issued these reports, these problems
have not been resolved, though EPA has told us that it has made
attempts to address them,'' the report said.
   ``Although publicly acknowledging the need for improvements, the
pull of conflicting priorities has generally made it difficult for
EPA to effect these needed changes, according to officials
responsible for the notification program.''

   A federal budget that critics say does not do
enough to tackle inflation and deficit spending has aggravated
fears of economic bust after years of sometimes booming growth.
   Finance Minister Michael Wilson is sticking to his view that
inflationary pressures can be reduced and that new budget gives the
central bank ``the scope to reduce interest rates more quickly than
would otherwise be the case.''
   However, the Conference Board of Canada, an Ottawa-based think
tank, says in its budget analysis that the risk of recession has
grown as a result of the fiscal decisions announced last month.
   ``We think the economy is going to be very, very soft for the
next six months,'' James Frank, the board's chief economist, told
the Globe and Mail newspaper.
   Since a second straight majority government of the Progressive
Conservative Party was elected in November, Prime Minister Brian
Mulroney, Wilson and other senior officials have led a steady
drumbeat calling for a reduction of government debt.
   Although the 1989-90 budget raises taxes and cuts federal
spending in areas from the military to rail service and child care,
it still leaves a deficit of $25.6 billion _ up slightly from the
previous year's $25.2 billion deficit.
   Wilson says the new budget is the first step in bringing the
annual deficit down to $12.6 billion in four years.
   However, achieving that goal may depend on a drop in interest
rates, continued economic growth, and tough tax policies.
   George Vasic of the Data Resources forecasting firm says
Mulroney missed the chance to make more progress on the budget
deficit at the outset of his second term, when election worries are
at their lowest.
   ``It's a major opportunity that was squandered,'' he said. ``We
feel that there's about a 40 percent chance of a recession between
now and the end of 1990.''
   He said, however, that slower growth is more likely.
   Warren Jestin, chief economist of Scotiabank, is more
optimistic. He predicts growth of 3 percent this year slowing to 2
percent or less in 1990.
   The Canadian economy has grown, at times dramatically, since the
end of the 1982 recession. The gross national product rose beyond
inflation by 4 percent in 1987 and 4.5 percent in 1988.
   Inflation has been running about 4 percent each year, but
concern that the economy was overheating prompted Bank of Canada
governor John Crow to increase interest rates over the past year to
their current 12 percent levels.
   Forecasts of recession or slowdown have surfaced persistently in
Canada since the stock market crash of 1987, in large part because
of the long expansion.

<HEAD>Lawmakers Want to Use Drexel Burnham Fine for Drug Programs</HEAD>

   Wall Street corruption may provide the
windfall the government needs to finance its efforts against
illegal drug traffickers, some members of Congress say.
   Leaders of the House Appropriations Committee said Wednesday
that they are weighing a plan that would channel $150 million to be
collected in fines from Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. this year into
federal anti-drug initiatives.
   Under the proposal, the money would be used to pay for prison
improvements, additional law officers, grants to state and local
governments and other programs during the last months of fiscal
1989, which ends Sept. 30.
   The appropriations panel would claim the extra spending is not
adding to the federal deficit because it would be financed with the
unanticipated fines.
   ``Thus, in my way of thinking, it's an offset for that
spending,'' said Rep. Neal Smith, D-Iowa, chairman of the
Appropriations justice subcommittee, who proposed the idea.
   Drexel Burnham agreed last December to pay $650 million in fines
and restitution and plead guilty to six felonies to settle
securities fraud charges brought by the U.S. attorney's office in
Manhattan.
   The plan is expected to meet opposition from some Democrats and
Republicans who likely will argue that with an potential deficit of
more than $160 billion this year, the Drexel fine can hardly be
considered unaccounted-for money.
   In addition, some lawmakers have argued that fines collected by
the Securities and Exchange Commission should be used to strengthen
that agency's law enforcement efforts.
   The proposal is part of an effort by the Appropriations
Committee to revamp a $4.7 billion domestic spending bill for this
year, a measure rejected by the House last month because ot its
high cost.
   The bill contained money for veterans, college students,
anti-drug efforts and other programs.
   Included in the package was $726 million in new spending
authority from Smith's subcommittee for anti-drug programs, about
$300 million of which would have actually been spent this year.
   To make the overall bill more appealing, the Appropriations
Committee would offset most new spending with cuts in other
programs, thus reducing the package's impact on the federal deficit.
   The Appropriations Committee hopes to bring the new version of
the spending bill to the House floor next week, and Smith said he
expects the use of the Drexel Burnham money to be included.
   ``There is a general approval by the members of the committee of
this approach, but there is no concrete agreement,'' he said.
   The chairmen of the 13 Appropriations subcommittees have agreed
to drop from the bill $250 million for reparations to
Japanese-Americans who were held in internment camps during World
War II, and most of $153 million that would have been used for the
homeless.
   The final package will be less than $4.7 billion, but the total
will not be determined until the subcommittee chairmen meet again
next Tuesday.

<HEAD>Era of US Irrigation Expansion May Not be Over, Study Says</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: also on general news wires.</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A preliminary study by the Agriculture
Department says the era of irrigation expansion in the United
States may not be over.
   After irrigated farmland peaked at 50.3 million acres in 1978,
there was a gradual downtrend, evidenced by the government's 1982
farm census and by a 1984 USDA survey. Many experts believed
irrigation expansion had run its course.
   The report by the department's Economic Research Service showed
that crop irrigation dropped to 49 million acres in 1982 and then
plummeted to 42.3 million acres in 1983 as federal acreage programs
and low prices prompted farmers to make sharp cutbacks.
   Some recovery was reported in several years following 1983, but
irrigation still lagged behind the old peak of the late 1970s.
   Last year, when drought parched crops across much of the nation,
irrigation edged up slightly to 45.9 million acres from 44.5
million acres in 1987.
   ``Irrigated area in 1989 could be the highest since 1982,
reflecting strong crop prices, moderate energy prices and low
annual acreage set-asides (reduction programs),'' the report said.
``In the East, last year's drought is expected to stimulate some
investment in irrigation as a form of insurance.''
   In the West, where most of the nation's irrigation is located,
the water supply has improved from a year ago.
   The report, in the May issue of Agricultural Outlook magazine,
was written by economists Bill Quinby and John Hostetler.
   ``Crop prices and acreage diversion programs have more influence
on irrigated area than do weather conditions or energy prices,''
the report said. ``After expanding about 30 percent per decade
(from 1900 to 1930), irrigation development slow to 4 percent in
the 1930s, a period marked by low crop prices.''
   When crop prices rose in the 1940s and 1950s, irrigation growth
was encouraged once again.
   The expansion of crop irrigation in the mid-1970s was a
``substantial deviation'' from the pattern, the report said. That
was due to favorable crop prices and expanding exports, which
helped push irrigation growth to about 2.3 million acres per year.
   Slower growth in the early 1980s reflected ``adjustments to crop
surpluses and low prices,'' the report said.
   Hostetler added Wednesday in a telephone interview that last
year's severe drought will ``encourage people to at least think
about irrigation,'' and that some will invest in new systems or
expand operations as a result.
   He said it's too early to conclude whether irrigation is back on
an expansion track because all the figures aren't in yet.
   The report said the national figures mask regional trends. For
example, the Pacific and Mountain regions account for more than
half the U.S. irrigated area. In 1987, the two regions had 24.1
million acres under irrigation, down about 2 million acres from
1982 but almost 700,000 acres more than in 1983.
   Last year, the West had poor soil moisture prior to planting and
there was reduced streamflow during the crop growing season. The
irrigated area was cut back to 23.9 million acres. In 1982, the
area was 26 million acres.
   In the plains states, which straddle the nation between the arid
West and the humid East, irrigation grew to 13.7 million acres last
year from 12.6 million in 1987. But that was well behind the 15.3
million acres in 1982. In 1983, however, the irrigated area
plummeted to 11.5 million acres.
   ``Because much of the irrigation water in the southern plains is
pumped from deep wells that have declining water tables, energy
costs represent a substantial share of production costs,'' the
report said. ``Irrigated area declined in 1974 and 1982, following
steep rises in natural gas prices.''
   The East had a record 8.2 million acres under irrigation last
year, up from 7.7 million in 1987 and 7.6 million in 1982, the
report said.
   ``Irrigation has more than quadrupled since 1969 in the Corn
Belt and Lake states,'' the report said. ``In these regions,
irrigation is supplemental, and there is strong evidence that
weather affects irrigated acreage.''
   The East's irrigation is also supplemental, used when and if
needed. Last year's drought helped push irrigation to a record
level, the report said.

   The government's Export-Import Bank is $4
billion to $6 billion in the red and the figure could reach $10
billion by 1992, the chairman of the House Banking Committee says.
   ``With the billions it will cost to fix the Federal Savings and
Loan Insurance Corp. fresh on our minds we must surely face the
Eximbank's insolvency, which was heedlessly disregarded by the
Reagan administration,'' the chairman, Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas,
said Wednesday.
   Gonzalez was referring to the savings and loan crisis. The
Eximbank lends mostly to Third World countries to encourage sales
of American goods.
   ``The Export-Import clearly fulfills a very useful, even
essential purpose,'' Gonzalez said. ``It creates jobs domestically
and helps our export industry lower our massive trade deficit.
   ``But the Eximbank is insolvent. This means the budget deficit
and cost of subsidizing our export industry are both understated by
$4 to $6 billion.
   ``We have seen with the tragic FSLIC crisis that masking the
true insolvency of a government agency has disastrous results and
the taxpayer ultimately bears the burden of this irresponsibility.''
   William Ryan, the bank's acting president, replied that normal
accounting practices do not apply because the bank is backed by the
full faith and credit of the federal government.
   Gonzalez complained that it still carries as assets loans made
to Cuba before President Fidel Castro took over and to China before
the victory of the Communists on the mainland.
   ``Eximbank has not received a cent on these loans in over 40
years,'' he said.
   Ryan said these were debts of sovereign countries and there is
some hope of collecting them.
   Gonzalez spoke at a hearing of his panel's subcommittee on
international development. Ryan was appearing before it to say that
demand for the bank's loans last year exceeded its $693 million
ceiling by $150 million, and it expected the same thing to happen
again in the year that ends Sept. 30.
   ``As a result, we may again have to defer $150 million to $250
million in authorizations into 1990,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   The makers of Rolling Rock beer believe they
have steered around a bottleneck and are nearing a solution on how
to comply with a new law requiring warning labels on beer bottles.
   The law requires that alcoholic beverage containers carry labels
warning of possible adverse health effects from drinking wine,
liquor or beer by Nov. 18.
   But Pennsylvania's Latrobe Brewing Co.'s distinctive green
Rolling Rock bottles carry painted, rather than paper, labels.
   Therefore, the law would make as many as 1 million cases of
Rolling Rock _ each containing 24 bottles of beer _ obsolete
because the cost to alter them is prohibitive.
   The answer may be a grace period during which Latrobe would be
permitted to print the warning on bottle caps instead of on the
containers.
   ``We're a small player and we don't want to send out a message
that something special is being done for Latrobe,'' Albert
Spinelli, vice president of operations, said Wednesday.
   ``All we're looking for is a time period to phase out the
existing bottles as we bring new bottles in,'' he said. ``In the
meantime, we've had samples made up with the (warning) message on
the cap, and it's legible.''
   Writing the 41-word warning on the cap would be only a temporary
solution. Congress specified that the warning must appear on
containers and that the print on bottles 12 ounces and larger must
be at least two millimeters tall.
   The law also would affect Rolling Rock's seven-ounce bottles.
   Rolling Rock has refused to change to a paper label because it
feels the painted label gives it its distinctive identity.
   Rep. John Murtha, D-Pa., has received permission from the House
Appropriations Committee to insert language in a spending bill that
would grant Rolling Rock a grace period, Murtha spokesman Bill
Allen said Wednesday. The bill is likely to be considered by the
House within a week.
   It is uncertain how long Latrobe might have to fully comply with
the law. Latrobe has said it could take 10 years before the 24
million bottles wear out, or get broken or lost, although the
brewery does not expect to win a grace period nearly that long.
   On the Senate side, Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., the author of the
law, has indicated he wants to accommodate Latrobe officials if he
can, according to aides to Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa.
   ``Everybody seems to agree this is a unique situation,'' Allen
said. ``Everybody seems agreeable.''

<HEAD>Union Preparing For Strike To Protest Mobil's Pullout Tactics</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The union representing most
black Mobil Corp. employees in South Africa said Thursday it is
preparing for a strike to protest the U.S. company's refusal to
negotiate terms of its planned pullout.
   Pat Horne, a spokeswoman for the Chemical Workers Industrial
Union, said a strike ballot was planned for next week.
   If approved, she said, a strike would be launched against Mobil
and other multinational companies that have not complied with a
union demand to negotiate terms favorable to workers in the event
of disinvestment from South Africa.
   Mobil, the largest U.S. company operating in South Africa,
announced April 28 that it was selling its holdings in the country
to the General Union Mining Corp., a conglomerate known as Gencor,
which owns a petroleum company.
   The sale price was not disclosed, and the ownership change will
not take effect until various financial arrangements are completed.
   Mobil said Gencor had pledged to continue the company's
employment policies and honor all existing agreements with the
union. But union officials nonetheless were angered, saying Mobil
had rebuffed past attempts to open negotiations by insisting there
were no plans for disinvestment.
   Of Mobil's 2,800 employees in South Africa, about 1,500 are
black, including about 1,200 represented by the chemical workers
union.
   The union had approached several foreign companies, including
Mobil, with a request for certain arrangements in the event of
disinvestment. Among the demands were 12-month advance notice,
guarentees of job security and full disclosure of the terms of sale.
   The union has applied to the Industrial Court for an order
halting the planned Mobil sale. A hearing on the application began
Tuesday, but the case was postponed until May 24 and Mobil
representatives said they would try to provide the union with full
information about the pullout.
   In a related development this week, a syndicate of black and
Indian businessmen from Natal Province, site of the main Mobil
refinery, said they would try to outbid Gencor for Mobil's assets.
   A spokesman for the group, Mangalpersaid Hariram, said the
businessmen had access to about $120 million.
   Scores of U.S. companies have withdrawn from South Africa in
recent years, citing economic considerations and pressure from the
anti-apartheid movement. Mobil Chairman Allen Murray said the
disinvestment dceision was motivated by ``business
considerations,'' including U.S. legislation which has made it more
difficult for American companies to make profits in South Africa.

   West Point Pepperell Inc., as
anticipated, has announced it is cutting roughly 10 percent of its
high-level employees at the textile giant's headquarters.
   The company said Wednesday 150 employees would be dismissed in
an effort to speed decision-making and improve the company's
competitiveness following its $3 billion acquisition earlier this
year by Farley Industries Inc.
   No plant workers will be affected by the restructuring,
Pepperrell said.
   William Farley, chairman of Chicago-based Farley Industries,
said recently that cost-cutting measures at the corporate
headquarters would be coming as soon as possible.
   Dismissed workers will receive a minimum three months' severance
pay and company-paid medical, insurance and other workers' benefits
for a year.
   The restructuring will ``control overhead and remove layers of
bureaucracy between decisions and decision-makers, and allow us to
move faster in a fast-moving world,'' the company's statement said.
   ``WestPoint Pepperell will be stronger, leaner and more able to
deal with international competition,'' the statement said.

<TEXT>
   Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing Co.
said it plans to create an Employee Stock Ownership Plan to help
pay for employee retirement accounts, not fend off unwanted
takeovers.
   The company said Wednesday it plans to establish the ESOP and
buy back up to 10 million shares in the next year.
   Such plans have been used to thwart takeover attempts by putting
more stock in friendly hands, but the 3M plan will put less than 4
percent of the company's outstanding common stock into the ESOP,
said Jon Greer, 3M's program manager for investor relations.
   ``It is not being adopted as a takeover defense,'' Greer said.
``It's being done because it's a more cost-effective way to finance
contributions to retirement accounts.''
   3M will borrow $550 million to fund the ESOP with 7.5 million
new shares of common stock. The shares will be allocated to
employees over a 15-year period.
   Even though 3M for years has been giving stock to its employees
as part of retirement plans, it had never officially established an
ESOP, Greer said. Under the ESOP, 3M will be able to deduct for tax
purposes both the principal and interest on the borrowings, Greer
said.
   In addition, certain tax benefits to the lenders will allow 3M
to borrow the money at lower rates. Greer declined to say how much
money 3M will save under the strategy.
   In a related action, 3M's board authorized the company to
repurchase up to 10 million shares between May 31, 1989, and June
1, 1990. The purchases, expected to be made on the open market,
will be used to replace the previously authorized shares sold to
the ESOP, for existing employee stock plans, and for other
corporate needs, 3M said.

   Georgia Marble Co., which provided marble for the
Lincoln Memorial and part of the U.S. Capitol in Washington, has
agreed to be acquired by First Chicago Corp.'s venture capital unit
for about $325 million in cash.
   The acquisition is to be completed by the end of the month, the
companies said Wednesday.
   Georgia Marble was a unit of the Jim Walter Corp. until last
year, when Walter was acquired by the New York investment firm
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. for $2.44 billion.
   The First Chicago venture unit, owned by the First National Bank
of Chicago, participated in the deal for Walter, which is now known
as Hillsborough Holdings Corp. and is based in Tampa, Fla.
   Proceeds from the Georgia Marble sale are expected to be used to
help repay debt from the earlier deal.
   Sam Mencoff, vice president of the venture capital unit, said
discussions concerning the acquisition began in February. He said
no changes are planned for the 105-year-old Atlanta-based company.
   Georgia Marble had sales last year of $126 million. The company
does not release its earnings figures, but President A.L. Gay Jr.,
who will remain as top executive, said the company has ``been
profitable for many years.''
   Georgia Marble has about 1,100 employees, runs eight quarries in
the state and makes industrial fillers, landscaping and swimming
pool materials and other building materials.
   Georgia Marble's stone also was used in the construction of
Chicago's Field Museum and the New York Stock Exchange, Gay said.

   Campbell can say its soup is ``Mm! Mm!
Good'' but can longer tout it as promoting good health _ unless it
can prove it.
   The nation's No. 1 soup company settled a year-old dispute
Wednesday with nine states over advertised claims that it soups
provide health benefits and may help prevent some types of cancer.
   ``Where we make a specific claim, it has to be true,'' said
James H. Moran, a Campbell Soup Co. spokesman. ``If we say
something is promoting good health, we've got to be able to
document that.''
   The agreement does not affect a complaint filed against Campbell
in January by the Federal Trade Commission, which accused the
company of overstating the health benefits of its chicken noodle
soup.
   Campbell advertisements misled consumers by failing to alert
them of the soup's sodium content, the agency charged.
   Campbell halted the ads challenged by the nine states a year
ago, but Moran said the company plans to fight the FTC complaint.
   ``We're standing by the ad and we're going to court and prove
our case,'' said Moran.
   Camden-based Campbell sells about 5 billion cans of soup a year,
garnering about 65 percent of the $2.2 billion retail soup market
in the United States. It's advertising claims have come under heavy
criticism from the Center for Science in the Public Interest.
   Since 1983, the Washington-based consumer group has twice asked
the FTC to review Campbell's advertising and sodium content claims.
   ``The amount of sodium and salt in the soups is a serious
concern,'' said Charles Mitchell, a staff attorney for the group.
``Most of their soups are so high in sodium that the increased risk
of high blood pressure from the soups might outweigh any other
positive benefits that are or are not in the soups.''
   The agreement announced Wednesday ended an 11-month-old dispute.
   The states contended that Campbell's ads ``generally
mischaracterized the health effects of Campbell's soup products,''
said Wisconsin Attorney General Don Hanaway.
   Among them, he said, were high fiber claims about products that
were not high in fiber, calcium source claims about soupsthat are
not a good source of calcium and claims that its bean and pea soups
can prevent ``some kinds of cancer.''
   Under the settlement, Campbell agreed to pay the states $35,000
each and to change certain advertising practices. The money will be
used by each state for consumer education and aid.
   ``This settlement helps send the message to food marketers that
they cannot claim falsely that a product is high in desirable
nutrients,'' said Minnesota Attorney General Hubert Humphrey III.
   Wisconsin also worked with attorneys general of California,
Illinois, Iowa, Massachusetts, Missouri, New York and Texas in
reaching the settlement.
   ``This type of action by this many states is unprecedented,''
said Mitchell. ``It reinforces our belief that state governments
will continue to be the most reliable watchdog for consumers.''
   In early 1988, Campbell voluntarily halted the advertising
campaign that focused on the theme ``Soup is Good Food,'' Moran
said. The company resumed using the theme: ``Mm! Mm! Good,'' which
had not been used since the 60s, he said.
   In 1986, Campbell spent more than $200 million on advertising,
Moran said. Current figures were not available, he said.
   The company, which produces 6 million cans of soup daily, said
that it chose not to fight the matter in court because of the
``peripheral nature'' of the dispute and of the drain on Campbell
resources that would result from pursuing the matter in each of the
nine states.
   ``We're not accepting any guilt and they're not giving any,''
said Moran. ``This was a settlement that we could live with.''

<HEAD>Superpowers to Cooperate to Fight Oil Spills</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States and Soviet Union formally
pledged Thursday to help each other fight pollution emergencies in
northern waters like the oil tanker spill that fouled sections of
Alaska's coastline this spring.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze and U.S.
Secretary of State James A. Baker III signed the agreement on the
last day of Baker's two-day visit to Moscow. It pledges superpower
cooperation in combating spills of oil and other pollutants in the
Bering and Chukchi seas between Alaska and Siberia.
   The Soviet news agency Tass said the agreement provides for the
development of a ``joint plan of drastic measures'' in the event of
a spill. Each country is required to notify the other immediately
of a pollution emergency, and U.S. and Soviet officials will hold
joint exercises on fighting ocean pollution, Tass said.
   ``The signing of the agreement is a major step toward developing
Soviet-American cooperation in dealing with the consequences of
ecological disaster at sea,'' Oleg Khalimonov, an official in the
Soviet Merchant Marine Ministry, told Tass.
   ``The developed mechanism of interaction will allow specialists
to define within hours the scope of an accident, map out joint
measures to overcome its consequences and get down immediately to
their implementation,'' Khalimonov said. ``Earlier such procedures
took days and sometimes whole weeks.''
   Tass said the cooperation envisaged by the agreement began to
function even before Baker and Shevardnadze signed the formal
document. A Soviet ship designed to skim the surface of the sea was
hired to help clean up the oil spilled by an Exxon tanker off
Alaska in late March.
   However, Exxon officials, who were paying the Soviets $15,000 a
day for the aid, said Tuesday the ship was being sent home because
it was not designed to handle the hardened, taffylike mass the oil
spilled by the tanker has turned into.

<HEAD>Suspend 11 In Trading Scandal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Stock Market Commission has
suspended 11 traders, three permanently, following a probe into a
multimillion dollar illegal trading scandal, news reports said.
   The Excelsior news service reported late Wednesday that the
suspensions followed an investigation into the October 1987 crash.
   Excelsior said commission head Oscar Espinosa Villarreal
disclosed the suspensions late Wednesday and quoted him as saying
that the act was unprecedented.
   Exclesior and the government news service Notimex identified
those suspended permanently from trading as: Jose Luis Villar
Arguero, operations manager for Bursamex; Miguel Angel Hernandez
Campos, a promotions director for the Casa de Bolsa de Mexico; and
Jose Luis Moreno Rodriguez of the Casa de Bolsa Fimsa.
   The other eight, primarily directors and high-ranking officials
of Mexico's trading houses, were suspended from stock market
operations for periods ranging from three to 12 months, Notimex
said.
   Notimex reported that the commission issued official warnings to
an additional 31 traders and doled out administrative sanctions
against another 42. Notimex did not specify the type of sanctions.
   The investigation followed complaints filed by at least 200
investors against all but one of Mexico's 24 registered brokerage
firms after stockholders lost millions of dollars' worth of
holdings in the 1987 crash.
   The alleged violations ranged from insider trading in both
stocks and foreign currencies to the sale of nonexistent Treasury
certificates and trading in securities without client consent.
   Following the investigation, officials in February arrested
Eduardo Legorreta, board chairman and one of the founders of
Operadora de Bolsa, one of Mexico's two leading trading firms, and
Jaime Ceballos Cervantes, the company's director of investment
promotions.
   Also arrested were Juan Carlos Fernandez Cuevo and Jose
Francisco Rodriguez Dupont of Mexicana de Valores e Inversiones,
Mexico's other major brokerage firm.
   At the time of the arrests, Gustavo Diaz, president of an
association formed by the affected investors, estimated the
brokerage firms netted $43.5 million in profits from the alleged
illegal trading.

   The stock market opened higher today after the
government reported a modest rise in April retail sales.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 5.50 points to
2,379.95 after a half-hour of trading at 10 a.m. EDT.

   Analysts said the market got a lift from bond prices, which
firmed in response to a smaller-than-expected rise in retail sales.
   The Commerce Department reported that retail sales rose a modest
0.4 percent last month.
   However, analysts cautioned that the jitters plaguing the market
the last few days could return later in the session if the final
day of the Treasury's borrowing produces unfavorable results. The
government is set to auction $9.50 billion in 30-year bonds later
today.
   Brokers said the market also remains nervous in advance of
Friday's report on wholesale prices, which could provide a better

<TEXT>
   Viacom Inc. Thursday reported earnings of nearly
$200 million for the first quarter, reflecting the sale of two
cable systems and an improvement from the previous year's
first-quarter loss.
   The communications and entertainment company said the earnings
of $199.1 million, or $3.73 a share, in the three months ended
March 31 compared with a loss of $61.1 million a year earlier.
   A pretax gain of $304.8 million on the sale of the Long Island
and Cleveland cable systems boosted earnings in the first quarter,
Viacom said. Some of the $545 million of proceeds from the sales
were used to repay a portion of Viacom's bank debt.
   First-quarter revenue amounted to $341.1 million, 16.4 percent
above the $293.1 million of revenue in the first three 1988 months.
   Viacom, which owns the Showtime movie channel and other cable
operations, said MTV networks were strong in advertising sales and
affiliate fees.
   Revenue and profit in the entertainment division benefited
significantly from the domestic syndication of the popular
television program, The Cosby Show, the company said.
   Viacom earlier this week filed suit against Time Inc. and Time's
Home Box Office and its other cable TV holdings. Viacom is seeking
$2.4 billion in damages because it says Time is engaging in unfair
practices that are undermining competition in the pay-TV business.

<HEAD>Royal Dutch-Shell and BP Earnings Up Sharply</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Royal Dutch-Shell Group of Companies reported a 55
percent surge in first-quarter earnings Thursday, partly because of
gains from property sales.
   British Petroleum Co. PLC reported first-quarter earnings more
than doubled because of higher oil prices and a one-time gain.
   Royal Dutch-Shell said earnings for the first three months of
the year totaled 1.28 billion pounds or $2.1 billion, up from 825
million pounds a year earlier.
   Both companies' financial statements are based on British
accounting methods and cannot be directly compared with those of
most American companies. Inventories are valued on the basis of the
first-in, first-out or FIFO system, versus the the typical American
system of last-in, first out, or LIFO.
   On a current cost, or LIFO basis, which values the company's oil
inventories at current market prices, Royal-Dutch Shell's earnings
rose a more modest 22 percent to 1.1 billion pounds or $1.8
billion, from 903 million pounds a year earlier.
   Earnings per share for Royal Dutch Petroleum Co., the Dutch arm
which controls 60 percent of the company, rose to 5.54 Dutch
guilders or $2.64, vs. 3.31 guilders a year ealrlier.
   Earnings per share for Shell Transport and Trading Co. PLC, the
British arm which controls the remaining 40 percent, rose to 14.1
pence or 24 cents, from 9.1 pence a year earlier.
   First-quarter sales rose 5 percent 14.3 billion pounds or $23.9
billion, up from 13.63 billion pounds a year earlier.
   The company had a 244 million-pound or $407 million gain from
the sale of real estate, compared with a gain of 106 million pounds
from property sales a year earlier.
   Royal Dutch-Shell, based in The Hague, the Netherlands, and in
London, said exploration and production earnings fell, due to lower
production volumes and natural gas prices and higher exploration
expenses.
   London-based BP, which owns Cleveland-based Standard Oil Co.,
said first-quarter earnings totaled 608 million pounds or $1.02
billion from 263 million pounds a year earlier.
   The improvement came from higher oil prices and a one-time gain
of 136 million pounds or $227 million form the sale of a 15 percent
interest in a North Sea field, the company said.
   On the current cost basis, earnings fell 6.6 percent to 381
million pounds or $636 million, from 408 million pounds a year
earlier.
   Earnings per share came to 10.3 pence or 17 cents, from 4.4
pence a year earlier.
   Sales rose 2 percent to 6.62 billion pounds or $11.1 billion,
from 6.47 billion pounds a year earlier.

<HEAD>Avon Repeats It Is Not For Sale After $2 Billion Amway Offer</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Leads with 4 grafs on Amway plan to sell retail fragrance business;

<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Amway Corp. said today it would sell Avon
Products Inc.'s prestige fragrance business if its attempt to buy
Avon for more than $2 billion succeeds.
   The business includes higher-priced perfumes like Giorgio
Beverly Hills, Oscar de la Renta, Cher, Valentino, Perry Ellis and
Deneuve, which are sold in stores instead of by Avon's
person-to-person sales force.
   Avon said the business is expected to run up sales of more than
$300 million this year. Spokesman John Cox said the company had no
comment on Amway's stated plan, which was in a filing with the
Securities and Exchange Commission.
   Amway made its offer for Avon on Wednesday and urged its larger
rival to stop its ``knee-jerk, defensive activities.'' Avon said it
was not for sale, although its board of directors would evaluate
the offer.
   Analysts predicted a long battle, complicated by the culture
clash between Amway's patriotic, pep-rally style and its larger
rival's image as the home of the refined Avon Lady.
   Amway, in partnership with Minneapolis investor Irwin Jacobs,
owns 10.3 percent of Avon's outstanding common shares, but Jacobs
is not participating in the purchase offer, Amway said.
   Avon rose $3.87{ a share at $39.87{ in New York Stock Exchange
consolidated trading, above Amway's $39-a-share offer. The spread
between the stock price and Amway's offer indicated speculators
were betting a higher bid would emerge from Amway or another suitor.
   However, there also was speculation that Avon management would
succeed in blocking the takeover, or that Amway would not be able
to arrange financing for its offer.
   Analysts disagreed over whether a much higher bid for Avon was
justifiable. While some valued the stock at up to $50 a share,
Andrew Shore of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. valued Avon at no more
than about $41 a share based on its cash flow.
   Amway's bid places a value of $2.1 billion on Avon, based on
nearly 54 million outstanding Avon common shares. Amway would also
have to acquire 18 million preferred shares which could be
converted into common in the event of a takeover, adding about $700
million to the price.
   ``After careful consideration, we have concluded that our
respective businesses are complementary ...,'' Amway's letter said.
   Amway reserved the right to lower its offering price if Avon
took further defensive actions. It asked for a response to its
offer from the board of directors by 5 p.m. EDT on May 24.
   Amway assured Avon sufficient financing would be available in
the form of bank loans.
   In a letter responding to Amway released late Wednesday, Avon
repeated that it was not for sale but said the board ``will review
your proposal in due course, consistent with its fiduciary
responsibilities.''
   Avon spokesman John Cox also said Amway's proposal was
``conditional and unfinanced.''
   Avon sells cosmetics, toiletries and household products and
recorded worldwide sales of $3.06 billion last year. Most of its
1.5 million sales representatives are women who sell part-time,
either door-to-door or to friends and co-workers.
   Amway is a private consumer products sales company in Ada,
Mich., closely held by co-founders Jay Van Andel and Richard DeVos.
It has more than 1 million distributors and recorded retail sales
of $1.8 billion in its last fiscal year. In an effort to block a
possible bid, Avon this week filed a federal suit against the
partnership in U.S. District Court in Manhattan on the grounds that
Amway and Jacobs had not complied with federal securities laws
ownership disclosure requirements.
   Avon also has asked a New York state court to rule on the legal
validity of the company's shareholder rights stock plan, known as a
poison pill, aimed at making a hostile takeover prohibitively
expensive.
   William Nicholson, Amway's chief operating officer, said Amway
informed Jacobs as a courtesy that it was making a bid.
   Jacobs was traveling Wednesday and not reachable for comment, a
person in his office said.

<HEAD>Crop Futures Open Lower On Rain Forecasts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices were modestly
lower in early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade, partly
in response to forecasts for rain in key crop-growing areas.
   The National Weather Service's new six-to-10 day outlook, issued
late Wednesday, calls for rain next week in the central Plains and
the western Corn Belt, two areas that have not shared in the
general recovery from last summer's drought.
   The soybean and corn markets also were pressured by expectations
for showers this weekend in the Midwest, analysts said.
   Additional selling of soybean futures stemmed from Agriculture
Secretary Clayton Yeutter's statement this morning that the
Agriculture Department has not decided whether to subsidize the
sale of U.S. soybean oil to the Soviet Union. The market had
expected a subsidized sale to be announced.
   Cautious trading was expected today ahead of this afternoon's
USDA revised estimates of the U.S. winter wheat crop, and of world
supply and demand for corn and soybeans.
   In early trading, wheat was 1{ cents to 2{ cents lower with the
contract for delivery in May at $4.24 a bushel; corn was 1} cents
to 3{ cents lower with May at $2.77} a bushel; oats were 1 cent to
3 cents lower with May at $1.85 a bushel; soybeans were 4 cents to
6\ cents lower with May at $7.52 a bushel.
   Cattle futures were mixed while pork futures were lower in early
trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .10 cent lower to .25 cent higher with June at
72.07 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .15 cent lower to .20 cent
higher wiith May at 77.10 cents a pound; live hogs were .10 cent to
.32 cent lower with June at 48 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies
were .80 cent to .90 cent lower with May at 35 cents a pound.
   Cattle futures settled mostly lower on Wednesday while pork
futures advanced.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The tangled takeover battle between the two of
the largest gold producers took another twist today as a federal
judge declined to hold Minorco S.A. in contempt of court _ for now.
   South African-controlled Minorco, largest gold producer in the
noncommunist world, has been trying to acquire rival British-based
Consolidated Gold Fields PLC since last fall.
   Gold Fields and its U.S. subsidiary, Newmont Mining Corp., sued
in New York to block the takeover and U.S. District Judge Michael
Mukasey issued an injunction _ blocking Minorco from acquiring more
Gold Fields shares on antitrust grounds.
   Minorco, incorporated in Luxembourg, already held almost 30
percent of Gold Fields' shares and has tenders for about 25 percent
more although Mukasey's injunction bars Minorco from buying those
shares.
   Gold Fields owns 49 percent of Newmont, the largest U.S. gold
producer.
   On Tuesday, Britain's Panel on Takeovers and Mergers ordered
Gold Fields to drop out of the American lawsuit, leaving Newmont as
the only obstacle to the $5.9 billion takeover. Minorco said it
would try to find a third-party bidder for Newmont.
   But Newmont asked Mukasey to hold Minorco in contempt, claiming
Minorco's maneuvering to try and find a buyer for Newmont, as a way
of forcing the American concern out of the litigation, violated
Mukasey's injunction.
   Mukasey, however, declined to find Minorco in contempt for the
time being.
   In a two-page order issued early today, Mukasey said he would
entertain another request to hold Minorco in contempt of court if
it attempted to alter Gold Fields' interest in Newmont so that it
couldn't vote its shares, which total 49.3 percent.
   Newmont expressed concerns at a hearing Wednesday that if
Minorco could get a third party to acquire a large stake in the
U.S. concern they could effectively force it to drop the law suit
blocking the takeover.

<HEAD>Eds: Top 5 grafs new to raise time element, demand for state improvements,
add meeting with Bush planned; pickup pvs 5th graf, ``But JTPA''</HEAD>

   The Bush administration today proposed
rewriting the nation's major jobs training program, which was
co-authored by Vice President Dan Quayle, to direct most spending
to the poor and teen-agers.
   It also warned states that their programs will have to be
improved to receive federal support.
   ``For years, the government has been distributing money to youth
programs in a fragmented and piecemeal fashion, and sometimes
without clear expectations of what these youths should achieve,''
Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole told the Senate subcommittee on
employment and productivity.
   Mrs. Dole and three JTPA participants who attended the hearing
were meeting with President Bush this afternoon in a session
designed to demonstrate the president's support for the changes.
   The amendments would significantly change the Job Training
Partnership Act created by Quayle, then a Republican senator from
Indiana, and Sen. Edward M. Kennedy. Mrs. Dole said the revisions
were necessary because of the changing American workforce, not
because of any major flaws in the program.
   ``But JTPA can be made even better,'' she told the subcommittee,
which has jurisdiction over the act. ``Funds do not always reach
the individuals and areas who need help the most. In some
communities it is felt that the program does not always result in
good jobs and a higher standard of living.''
   The changes aim at ending a practice that has prompted criticism
of JTPA and other training programs, the ``creaming'' of applicants
with some marketable skills in order to place them quickly in jobs
with little future.
   They also would also separate youth-training efforts from the
various adult programs in which they are now found. And both the
state and federal governments would be required to do a far better
job coordinating training programs with education, counseling and
other services provided by federal, state and local governments.
   Most of the changes were recommended by an advisory panel named
by former Labor Secretary Ann McLaughlin. Some also have been
suggested by subcommittee members, including the panel's chairman,
Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill.
   Simon told Mrs. Dole he was sure that Democrats and Republicans
could work out minor differences in their approaches to amending
JTPA.
   ``I think we're going to get a good bill out of this committee
that we're all going to be able to agree on,'' he said.
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, called JTPA ``the singularly important
work of this committee during the Reagan years,'' but said changing
work-force demographics made revisions necessary.
   Mrs. Dole dedicated most of her testimony to how the changes
would improve training for teen-agers, something she has said would
be among her highest priorities as secretary.
   She said all youths and half the adults seeking enrollment in
JTPA programs would need to overcome illiteracy, other basic skills
deficiencies or a poor school record. Teen parents and the homeless
also would be given preference.
   And, for the first time, employers who accepted JTPA money to
help pay for summer jobs for youths would be required to provide
some form of approved education or training.
   The changes, Mrs. Dole said, are designed to address projected
shortages in the labor force and the related ``skills gap''
exacerbating shortages for jobs in high-tech and other industries.
   Department officials have said the amendments, if approved,
likely would require a modest reduction in the number of people
served by JTPA. Mrs. Dole made no reference to that in her prepared
testimony.
   The federal government allocated $2.4 billion for JTPA this year
and Bush has requested stable funding for next year. JTPA programs
are expected to serve 1.9 million people this year.
   Because most of the money is spent to support programs
administered by state and local agencies, the proposed changes
include a number of guidelines those agencies would have to meet
before being deemed eligible for JTPA funding.
   At the state and local level, the proposed changes would for the
first time require individual assessments of prospective trainees
and, for those accepted into the programs, an individually tailored
program to meet the distinct education, training and placement
needs of each trainee.
   Removed would be guidelines that encouraged rapid job placement,
something JTPA critics have said leads to ``creaming'' and
placement of trainees in low-skill jobs with few career
possibilities.
   Instead, program administrators would be encouraged to offer
more thorough training, with their efforts monitored through a
follow-up survey to determine a trainee's progress in the job
market.

<HEAD>Ways and Means Committee Rejects Bush Bailout Plan</HEAD>

   House Democrats are rejecting as ``blue smoke
and mirrors'' President Bush's proposed solution to the savings and
loan crisis, a move the administration contends may thwart an
agreement not to raise taxes next year.
   In the biggest challenge yet to Bush's campaign promise to
reduce the federal deficit without new taxes, the House Ways and
Means Committee voted 25-11 Wednesday to dump the $50 billion S&amp;L
bailout costs on the government's budgets for fiscal 1989, 1990 and
1991.
   The amounts would not count against the Gramm-Rudman law's
deficit limits, according to the plan, which Democrats contend
would cost taxpayers $4.5 billion less than Bush's proposal over
the next 30 years.
   An angry Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady called the vote a
``mistake'' and said it could lead to ``months of stalemate.''
   ``If adopted, this action could force us to go back to square
one on both the budget and the savings and loan plan,'' he said.
``This is not the way either to lower interest rates or solve the
savings and loan crisis.''
   Two Republicans _ Reps. Willis Gradison of Ohio and Raymond
McGrath of New York _ joined all 26 Democrats in rejecting Bush's
off-budget financing scheme.
   The Ways and Means alternative would swell this year's budget
deficit by $9 billion or $10 billion and next year's by between $22
billion and $25 billion.
   All the money would go toward closing or merging some 350
insolvent thrift institutions that have lost an estimated $100
billion in federally insured deposits through poor and often
fraudulent lending practices.
   ``This is the first step in ending the period of Ronald Reagan's
blue smoke and mirrors,'' said the committee's chairman, Rep. Dan
Rostenkowski, D-Ill.
   Prior to Wednesday's vote, Brady met for an hour with committee
members behind closed doors, repeating a threat to recommend that
Bush veto any S&amp;L plan that _ without a tax increase or spending
cuts elsewhere _ would raise the deficit.
   Senate Democrats bowed to a similar threat last month, rejecting
an alternative proposed by its banking committee chairman, Sen.
Donald Riegle, D-Mich., to put the entire bailout's cost on this
year's budget.
   The Ways and Means Committee meets again on May 18 to affirm its
vote formally before the bill goes to the full House on the
following week. But Rostenkowski said he hopes his panel will not
reopen the issue.
   Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., an early proponent of including
the S&amp;L bailout's costs in the budget, said the committee's action
Wednesday has breathed new life into a once-abandoned effort to
force Bush's hand.
   ``The Democratic caucus is pretty much on board now that Ways
and Means has said it wants this on the budget,'' Schumer said. ``I
think the odds are 70 percent to 80 percent that we'll win on the
House floor.''
   Both the administration's plan and the alternative separate the
cost of cleaning up the S&amp;L mess from the Gramm-Rudman law, which
requires a reduction in the federal deficit to less than $100
billion for the next fiscal year beginning in October.
   Bush's proposal gets around the requirement by borrowing the $50
billion through a new off-budget government corporation and
including only the $3.5 billion in interest costs as part of
federal budget for the next three years.
   The Ways and Means measure allows the budget deficit to swell a
total of $50 billion over that time, but exempts it from the
official Gramm-Rudman target deficits of $136 billion this year,
$100 billion in 1990 and $64 billion in 1991.
   ``Everybody knows that it's already breached,'' said Rep. Ed
Jenkins, D-Ga., referring to the $163 billion deficit anticipated
this year and assumptions that interest rates will fall to 5.5
percent so that the 1990 target can be met.
   While Bush's plan prevented the cost of solving the S&amp;L crisis
from showing up on the budget, it also swelled the overall costs to
taxpayers because higher interest rates would have to be paid on
the borrowed $50 billion.
   The Congressional Budget Office estimates the savings in lower
interest rates from what the Ways and Means Committee did at $671
million over the first five years, $1.5 billion by the year 2000
and $4.5 billion over 30 years.

   Health authorities said Thursday 30,000
pigs have been destroyed because of a swine fever epidemic in
Modena province, renowned for its salami and hams.
   It has caused losses estimated at $12 million, said the health
office of this northern province where farmers breed nearly 1.3
million pigs a year.
   Bodies of the dead pigs were burned and officials ordered a
massive vaccination program, the office said.
   Swine fever is caused by a highly contagious virus that spreads
rapidly in crowded pig pens. If humans have contact with diseased
animals or eat infected pork they can contract gastroenteritis,
jaundice or skin diseases.
   The first case in the outbreak was reported April 23.

   Grand Metropolitan PLC, the British food and
liquor group that acquired U.S. food giant Pillsbury Co., on
Thursday reported a 27 percent gain in earnings for the first half
of the year.
   The improvement came on strong gains in all of the company's
major areas of activity, particularly in foods.
   Grant Met said earnings for the six months to March 31 came to
205 million pounds or $342 million, compared with 161 million
pounds in the comparable 1988 period.
   Earnings per share came to 22.9 pence or 38 cents, vs. 18.4
pence a year earlier, the company said.
   Sales jumped 40 percent to $4.04 billion pounds or $6.7 billion,
with Pillsbury accounting for $1.3 billion of that figure. The year
earlier sales totaled 2.88 billion pounds.
   Pillsbury, acquired for $5.7 billion in a takeover completed
Jan. 4, has ``firmly established Grand Metropolitan as a major
international operator in food and in retailing,'' said Grand Met
Chairman Allen Sheppard.
   Grand Met described Pillsbury's contribution as expectedly good,
helping to triple earnings in the foods division to 106 million
pounds or $177 million. Sales in the food units more than doubled
to 1.24 billion pounds.
   Earnings were strong in the company's other major areas of
business as well.
   Grand Met does not report quarterly results, which aren't
required under British law.

<TEXT>
   Savings and loan customers withdrew $8.5
billion from their accounts in March, the government said today in
a report that showed only slight improvement from the record pace
set in the first two months of the year.
   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board said net withdrawals for the
first three months of 1989 totaled $28.5 billion _ more than triple
the $8.4 billion in withdrawals for all of last year. Withdrawals
totaled $9.2 billion in February and a record $10.8 billion in
January.
   James Barth, chief economist of the bank board, attributed the
bulk of the outflow to the failure of S&amp;Ls to keep pace with rising
interest rates offered by competitors such as mutual funds.
   ``Apart from a few isolated instances, there is no evidence that
the outflows reflect a loss of depositor confidence,'' he said.
   March marks the 11th consecutive month of net withdrawals and
the fifth straight month of withdrawals in excess of $7 billion.
Earlier, from October 1987 through May 1988, money flowed into S&amp;Ls
as stock market investors sought the safety of federally insured
accounts.
   Administration officials have been citing the withdrawals as
evidence that Congress should move swiftly to enact President
Bush's bailout plan to close and merge failed S&amp;Ls.
   However, the plan is in danger of becoming bogged down in a
dispute between the administration and congressional Democrats over
whether the bailout spending should be counted as part of the
budget deficit.

<TEXT>
   The Bush administration sent legislation to
Congress today calling for a $500 million federal oil cleanup fund
to be financed by a fee on domestic and imported oil.
   Officials said the government now has little money earmarked for
such an emergency.
   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner outlined the
administration's proposal for a comprehensive oil spill liability
and compensation law, saying that in light of the Alaska spill it
is ``imperative to move quickly'' to establish a federal response
fund.
   Rep. Bill Tauzin, D-La., chairman of the House Subcommittee on
Coast Guard and Navigation, promised that a bill for such a fund
would be scheduled for a vote by the panel later this month.
   Skinner's proposal prompted some subcommittee members to note
that Congress has debated, but failed to enact, such a contingency
fund for the past 15 years.
   ``It took a tragedy like the Exxon Valdez to cause the entire
Congress to focus on the issue,'' said Rep. Walter Jones, D-Okla.,
who is the sponsor of a bill already under consideration to
establish a fund similar to the one proposed by the administration.
   Skinner said that while the cost of the oil spill in Alaska's
Prince William Sound on March 24 has yet to be determined, it could
exceed the maximum of $500 million envisoned for the proposed
cleanup fund.
   Under the legislation proposed by the administration, an oil
company or shipper would be liable to up to $78 million in cleanup,
damage and recovery costs. Costs in excess of that would be covered
by the federal fund, which would be collected over the next five
years from a 1.3 cent-a-barrel fee on domestic and imported
petroleum.
   When the Exxon tanker spilled 11 million gallons of oil in
Alaska _ the worst spill in U.S. history _ a federal oil spill
contingency fund had only $4 million in it. Skinner told the
congressmen that had the spill been caused by someone with less
resources than the Exxon Corp., the government would have been left
scrambling for money and asking Congress for special appropriations.
   Whatever the price, officials said a day earlier, they doubt
Exxon can clean the oil from hundreds of miles of rocky Alaska
coastline by next September as the oil company has said it hopes to
do.
   Exxon announced Wednesday that it plans to sharply increase the
number of workers assigned to coastal cleanup duties and deploy
more barges and boats to the effort. The decision to increase
manpower came after Bush administration officials said Exxon's
earlier summer cleanup plans were inadequate.
   But Adm. Paul A. Yost, the U.S. Coast Guard commandant, told a
Senate hearing that despite the increased manpower, he considers it
``almost impossible'' for Exxon to clean all the oil from more than
300 miles of shoreline by the Sept. 15 target date.
   Skinner told reporters Wednesday that while Exxon plans to
complete the cleanup this summer, he considers it ``a massive,
massive effort ... (and) a big challenge'' that might not be
possible.
   Skinner said the Bush administration will closely monitor the
effort and direct Exxon back to work next spring if the cleanup
does not meet expectations.
   Nevertheless, William D. Stevens, president of Exxon USA, told
openly skeptical senators the company ``fully expects to clean up''
the beaches by September, after which poor weather would likely
make efforts impossible.
   Confronted by figures showing that only 1.7 miles of the 300
miles of shoreline have been cleaned so far, Stevens said work
started slowly because the company tackled the worst beaches first.
He promised that even if the September deadline is met, Exxon will
return in the spring to ensure the work is done.
   The company announced plans to increase the number of cleanup
workers from 3,400 to 5,000 this summer after being told by Skinner
and presidential chief of staff John Sununu at a White House
meeting Monday that earlier cleanup plans were inadequate.
   Exxon also said it would increase the number of barges and boats
used in the cleanup, bringing the total to 70 vessels.
   The Coast Guard's Yost, however, expressed doubt in testimony
before the Senate Commerce Committee that the cleanup will be
anything short of a long, arduous task. He described how his hands
dripped with oil after he reached underneath the gravel on a beach
that 200 workers had been cleaning for 10 consecutive days.
   Increasing the number of cleanup workers will not keep the oil
from washing back onto the beaches, Yost told the senators.

   May Department Stores Co. on Thursday reported
a slight increase in earnings for the first quarter, in which the
company opened 17 new stores.
   For the three months ended April 29 May reported earnings of $63
million, or 45 cents a share, on revenues of $2.6 billion, compared
with $62 million, or 41 cents a share, on revenues of $2.2 billion
for the first period last year.
   ``We are very pleased with our sales and earnings increases for
the first quarter and are encouraged by the good start for 1989,''
said David C. Farrell, chairman and chief executive of the St.
Louis-based retailer. ``We have a lot of important programs in
process and expect another successful year for May.''
   During the first quarter, the company opened two department
stores, one discount store and 14 Payless ShoeSource stores. The
company said that by the end of the year, it will have opened 11
department stores, four discount stores and 140 Payless stores,
part of a $3.7 billion five-year capital spending plan.
   May is one of the largest retailers in the United States, with
3,092 stores.

   The House today approved raising the hourly
minimum wage from $3.35 to $4.55 by 1991, bringing Congress just
one step from its first domestic policy showdown with President
Bush, who has promised to veto the measure.
   The 247-172 vote followed brief debate. Democrats accused Bush
of turning his back on the working poor while Republicans said
Democrats were passing up an opportunity to raise the minimum wage
by accepting the president's offer of a more modest increase.
   ``What we consider today is a matter of elemental fairness,''
House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, said in a floor speech
supporting the $4.55 target contained in the legislation drafted by
a House-Senate conference committee. ``It goes to the heart of what
our country is all about.''
   But Rep. Fred Grandy, R-Iowa, said Democrats did not have the
two-thirds majority vote to override Bush's expected veto and were
surrendering their chance for some increase in the minimum wage to
fight a political battle with the White House.
   ``The people who are hurt are the people who could be making
$4.25 an hour,'' said Grandy, referring to the final minimum-wage
target in Bush's proposal.
   A Senate vote could come as early as next week. Both sides in
the debate, so sure Bush will veto the legislation, already are
hard at work drafting post-veto battle plans.
   ``If he vetoes it, then he has declared the end of the
honeymoon,'' said Rep. Austin Murphy, D-Pa.. ``I regret to say
that, but if that is the case I think there will be no holding it
back.''
   The ``it'' to which Murphy referred is a flood of
Democratic-sponsored bills dealing with such issues as parental
leave, child care, mandatory health insurance and others.
   ``A veto would tell other members there is no reason to say the
president is trying to get along,'' said Murphy. ``That would
undoubtably cause the sponsors of those bills to demand that they
advance.''
   After Senate passage, the Democratic congressional leadership
plans a mock signing session at which it will try to bring pressure
on the president.
   Nevertheless, Bush repeatedly has promised that the legislation
awaits the first veto of his presidency.
   Those urging the president to hold fast to that promise also are
quick to bring up the lengthy Democratic domestic agenda.
   ``The labor agenda,'' is the term used by Chamber of Commerce
lobbyist Frederick J. Krebs.
   ``This has taken on such symbolism,'' Krebs said in a telephone
interview. ``On legislative issues, things work much like they do
in an athletic contest _ you want momentum. The implications of the
minimum wage carry over to the entire labor agenda and also in a
broader context for the Bush administration because they think they
can win this one, and they need a few wins.''
   Both sides view the House and Senate votes as perfunctory, only
gaining importance if Democrats can substantially cut into the
strength Bush now has to sustain a veto. That however, appears
unlikely, leading to the intensified post-veto planning.
   Bush is being urged to take the initiative in that fight by
venturing out of Washington for a veto ceremony in the South or
West _ in a community where the administration can make its case
that too large an increase in the minimum wage will result in major
job losses.
   Business and labor are planning media campaigns through letters
and columns submitted to newspapers and appearances on local
television news programs in communities represented by lawmakers
considered to be potential swing votes in an attempted veto
override.
   The AFL-CIO, which conducted a nationwide conference call
Tuesday to plot strategy, also is working on a radio advertising
campaign in hopes of bringing pressure on lawmakers who now side
with Bush on the expected override vote.
   Proponents of the bill also are trying to draft another minimum
wage bill for quick consideration should they lose the veto fight,
which appears likely.
   Murphy said such a measure could take a number of forms, ranging
from a one-year increase, during which Congress and the White House
could seek a long-term compromise, to a three- or four-year
incremental plan not unlike the current bill.
   That decision would depend largely on the language in any Bush
veto message.
   ``If he tells us in that message that he wants to work it out
and makes a suggestion, I'm sure we will try to work from that,''
Murphy said. ``If not, then it becomes a partisan battle and we'll
go it alone.''
   Without the votes to override a veto, sponsors of the current
bill are asked increasingly whether they would eventually accept
Bush's proposal if he alternative was a ninth consecutive year with
the hourly minimum wage frozen at $3.35.
   Murphy said the choice would be the latter if Bush refused to
soften his demand for a provision allowing newly hired employees to
be paid a subminimum wage for six months.
   ``If that's the case there's no point in having a bill,'' Murphy
said. ``The proponents will stick to their guns.''

trains to replace short-haul aircraft could save the airlines money
and reduce airport congestion, some researchers say.
   Standing in the way of development of the ``maglev'' system is
money and a lack of enthusiasm.
   ``The market for (maglev trains) is not well defined,'' said
Larry R. Johnson, an economist and director of the Argonne National
Laboratory's Center for Transportation Research, who conducted a
yearlong study with five colleagues. ``There is not a constituency
that would push the idea.''
   In a report soon to be made public, researchers at the Argonne
Laboratory outside Chicago say the costs of building a 2,000-mile
network of 300 mph magnetic-levitation trains would be largely
offset by multibillion-dollar savings from reducing airline delays,
energy costs and airplane acquisition.
   A maglev network could open gate slots at major U.S. airports to
longer domestic and international flights, eliminating the need to
build many new airports, the researchers said.
   Magnetic levitation uses powerful magnets to lift a train above
a guideway and propel it at high speeds on a cushion of air.
   Although the technology exists, there are no maglev trains
operating anywhere in the world. Skeptics suggest that a working,
short-line demonstration model be built first to prove the
feasibility of maglevs.
   Another obstacle is the high-speed conventional electric train,
now in use in France and Japan and under development in Germany.
   Sudhir Kumar, a professor of engineering and ground
transportation at the Illinois Institute of Technology, said
Johnson is right about the need to reduce air traffic congestion.
   But he said a maglev system would be too expensive.
   ``It would be cheaper than building another airport,'' he said.
``But even less expensive would be high-speed trains,'' which
travel at speeds up to 200 mph.
   Johnson said at speeds of 300 mph and distances up to 600 miles,
maglevs could compete economically with aircraft.
   He said a maglev system linking Chicago's O'Hare International
Airport with cities such as Detroit, St. Louis, Indianapolis,
Milwaukee and Minneapolis could significantly reduce congestion at
the world's busiest airport.
   ``If you want to expand longer-range domestic and international
service at O'Hare, maglev certainly is a way of doing it,'' he said
this week.
   Johnson said more than half the flights arriving or departing
daily at O'Hare _ or about 1,100 of a total of 2,000 flights _
cover distances of less than 500 miles.
   The Argonne report estimates that delays and overcrowding at
airports cost airlines $5 billion a year and that it would cost $2
billion to $3 billion to build each of the 15 to 20 U.S. airports
that experts say are needed to expand the air-transport system into
the next century.
   The maglev system could be built at a cost of $15 million a
mile, and the cost of the individual vehicles is estimated at $2.5
million to $5 million each, Johnson said.
   Maglevs could be operated on elevated structures built along
existing interstate highways to link airports to cities in the
region, Johnson said. For example, connecting Burlington, Vt., to
New York City, or Phoenix to Los Angeles.
   But Kumar said trains that don't use magnetic levitation such as
France's TGV or Germany's ICE offer advantages of cost,
compatibility with existing track and the capability of hauling
freight.
   ``High-speed trains are a proven technology, maglevs are not,''
he said, adding that a short line should be constructed to probe
maglevs' feasibility.
   A Japanese firm has proposed constructing a 20-mile maglev line
between the airport at Orlando, Fla., and Disney World. The idea is
being considered by Florida officials.

   Share prices closed mostly lower on London's Stock
Exchange Thursday, in an atmosphere of continued unease about
possible labor actions.
   Despite a strong start, the market was unable to regain its
composure after several early selling waves, and prices spent most
of the day drifting in a narrow range.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index finished 6.4
points, or 0.3 percent, lower at 2,110.6. The index opened with a
gain of 1.3 points, but then quickly dropped to its lowest level,
showing a loss of 9.9 points.
   The market has been plagued in recent weeks by threatened
strikes in public transportation, power plants, broadcasting and
docks, raising fears of further upward pressure on inflation.
   Volume fell to 430.5 million shares from 466.6 million on
Wednesday.
   The Financial Times 30-share index was 4.7 points lower at
1,758.7 at the close. The Financial Times 500-share index fell 2.84
points to close at 1,196.92.

afternoon trading, influenced by higher bond prices and a firming
dollar.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 8.43 to 2,382.88
at 3 p.m. EDT. The blue-chip indicator was up 5.32 points an hour

   Advancers outnumbered decliners by about 6 to 5 on the New York
Stock Exchange, with 740 issues up, 606 down and 570 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 124.25 million shares.
   Analysts said stocks had firmed in response to a strengthening
bond market following the end of the Treasury's three-day
borrowing. However, activity was restrained with many participants
on the sidelines.
   The market got an early lift from bond prices, which firmed in
response to a smaller-than-expected rise in retail sales. The
Commerce Department reported that retail sales rose a modest 0.4
percent in April
   Later, the market drifted lower on concern about Friday's
wholesale prices report, which investors hope will provide a better
clue about inflation and the economy's growth.

   LaVonne Raney took a chance in a fledgling electronics firm
she'd read about and bought a few shares at $15 each.
   The time was the early '60s. The company was Teledyne Inc. Since
then, its stock has shattered the stratosphere, trading lately at
around $350 a share even after several splits.
   ``That was my biggest winner. It took three of us around the
world twice,'' recalled Mrs. Raney, of Columbus, Ohio, an amateur
stock dabbler who has long since cashed her Teledyne treasure.
   There may not be any Teledynes left in the twilight of the 20th
century. But that hasn't stopped investors from pouring billions of
dollars into what they see as potential gold mines _ startup
businesses with products and services ranging from robot cashiers
to toxic-waste neutralizers.
   A California company, for example, is working on a system that
would prevent waste through recycling. Another is trying to perfect
chemical-free purified water from industrial sewage.
   Others see riches in warehouse-like stores of the future that
eliminate the middleman or take customer orders via sophisticated
computers.
   ``Hitting it right usually requires a combination of foresight
and luck,'' said Dennis Sughrue, a researcher at Needham,
Mass.-based Venture Economics Inc., which tracks trends in
speculative investments.
   The foresight-luck mix was electronics in the '60s and computers
in the 70s. People who foresaw that a company hatched in someone's
garage would grow into today's Apple Computer Inc., for example,
would have multiplied their investment many times over.
   But investing in high-risk businesses is not for the timid. Like
the professional poker plays say, don't bet what you can't afford
to lose.
   ``For every Apple ... there are probably 30 to 40 other
companies you could lose money on,'' said Barry R. Feirstein,
managing director of Equitable Capital Management Corp. ``It's very
difficult for an individual investor ... to get in the ground floor
of something unless it's an industry he knows.''
   Even Mrs. Raney, who profited enormously by beating the crowd on
Teledyne, admits she stumbled into it and prefers to invest in more
proven companies.
   Professional venture capitalists aren't flocking to any
particular industry. A report by Venture Economics shows that all
the nearly $4 billion put in young companies in 1987 _ the latest
year for which complete data was available _ was spread out, with
no industry getting more than 15 percent.
   Experts envision growth in specific sectors in communications,
consumer products and services, computer hardware and software and
medicine, the Venture Economics data shows. Other areas receiving
adventurous-investor interest include electronics, industrial
products, biotechnology and energy.
   ``Within each industry there's a narrowly focused niche, and if
you hit it right you can make it big,'' said Sughrue.
   Finding that niche is the hard part. ``We look at probably 500
to 800 business plans a year from people coming to us with ideas,''
said John B. Mumford, managing general partner at Crosspoint
Venture Partners of Los Altos, Calif.
   ``In addition, we go to a lot of trade shows, industry meetings,
read literature in a variety of areas and try to forecast where
opportunites may be,'' he said.
   The maturing population of baby boomers, born between 1946 and
1964, are likely to play an important role in what's valuable in
the future.
   Cheryl Russell, editor-in-chief of American Demographics
magazine and author of ``100 Predictions for the Baby Boom,'' says
middle-aged boomers will transform the United States into a more
conservative, affluent nation, with the home the center of life.
   Here are a few key growth areas as seen by forward-thinking
investment professionals:
</TEXT>
<NOTE>Automation</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Severe labor shortages mean machines could replace humans for
tasks that range from cashiering to burger flipping to gasoline
dispensing. Sughrue says Checkrobot Inc. of Deerfield Beach, Fla.,
has developed an automated supermarket checkout system, and ByVideo
Inc. of Sunnyvale, Calif., is developing a system that can take
retail sales orders.
   Feirstein says automated bank-teller machine makers such as
Diebold Inc. of Canton, Ohio, also could expand in this field.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>Communications</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Integrated Services Digital Networks, which allow voices,
computer data and video signals to be transmitted over the same
phone lines through digital signals, are growing rapidly. The
underlying technology should make video conferences more common,
for example. Giants such as International Business Machines Corp.
and American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. are dominating but smaller
companies like Parigain Technologies of Torrance, Calif., could
emerge as leaders, said Mumford.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>Computers</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Predictions are tough because technology cycles shift quickly.
Timothy P. Bajarin, executive vice president of Creative Strategies
Research International of San Jose, Calif., said the trend today is
toward smaller computers with greater capabilities and bigger
memories. Prairietek Inc. of Boulder, Colo., is an example of a
little-known company working in this area, he said.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>Health Care</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Inflation is growing so rapidly in health care that many
corporate planners are aggressively seeking ways to cut costs. Look
for an emergence in mail order prescriptions from pharmaceutical
giants such as Baxter International Inc. of Deerfield, Ill.,
Feirstein said. Specialized treatment may also become more
prevalent. Mumford said he's backing a Concord, Calif., company
known as NeuroCare Corp., developing non-hospital rehabilitation
for patients who've suffered head injuries.
   Biotechnology treatments for afflictions ranging from cancer to
AIDS should become more common in the middle to late 1990s, many
experts say.
   ``They're taking a lot of the things developed over the past 10
years and now using them both for disease treatment and
diagnostics,'' said Mumford. Poised for possible growth, experts
say, are companies like Biosurface Technology Inc. of Cambridge,
Mass., which is developing synthetic skin.
   This area is especially risky. San Francisco-based Genentech
Inc.'s stock skyrocketed before slumping on slower-than-expected
sales of its blood clot dissolving drug, TPA.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>Retail</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Mumford says tomorrow's consumers will want exceptionally cheap
prices, superior services or both. He and others see an emergence
in warehouse distributors that cut prices by selling directly to
customers. ``Investments in that area nearly doubled from '86 to
'87,'' said Sughrue. Staples, a Newton, Mass., retailer that sells
bargain office supplies warehouse-style, is already becoming
popular.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>Waste Management</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Pollution issues ranging from the global warming trend to
solid-waste disposal are becoming more acute. Experts say companies
such as Clean Harbors Inc. of Braintree, Mass. stand to do well.
But Mumford says waste prevention is a potential gold mine. Athens
Corp. in Oceanside, Calif., for example, is developing a chemical
process that recycles hazardous wastes, and National Water
Management Co. of San Jose, Calif., is devising a system that
purifies industrial wastewater without using chemicals.

<HEAD>Dollar Firm In Europe, Gold Higher</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Strong demand in the absence of central bank
intervention drove the U.S. dollar higher against the major
currencies in European trading on Thursday.
   Gold prices also rose after dipping in Asia.
   Dealers said the news that U.S. retail sales in April rose by a
lower than expected 0.4 percent failed to shake confidence in the
American currency.
   One London dealer said the day's performance confirmed the
underlying demand for dollars and the market's reluctance to sell
them.
   The central banks again made no effort at a concerted
intervention to bring the dollar's exchange rate down by selling
dollars, although dealers said they can be expected to enter the
market if the dollar rises much above 1.92 West German marks.
   The dealers said the absence of intervention suggests that the
central banks tacitly acknowledged their sales of dollars had been
unable to bring the exchange rate down.
   In London, one British pound cost $1.6655 late Thursday, cheaper
for buyers than Wednesday's late $1.6717.
   Other late rates for the dollar in Europe compared with
Wednesday's late rates: 1.9135 West German marks, up from 1.9047;
1.7060 Swiss francs, up from 1.6925; 6.4665 French francs, up from
6.4645; 2.1580 Dutch guilders, up from 2.1500; 1,395.75 Italian
lire, up from 1,390.125; 1.1870 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1849.
   Gold bullion prices improved slightly in Europe. Gold traded
late in London, the major market, at a bid price of $379.00 a troy
ounce, up from $377.25. The late bid price in Zurich was $378.20,
up from $376.75.
   Earlier in Hong Kong gold closed at $377.25, down from $378.25.
   Silver bullion traded late in London at a bid $5.66 a troy
ounce, down from $5.68.

   Assets of the nation's 468 money market mutual
funds rose $2.9 billion in the latest week, the Investment Company
Institute said Thursday.
   The rise, to $307.06 billion in the seven-day period ended
Wednesday, followed a $1.2 billion increase in the funds' assets
the previous week, according to the Washington-based mutual fund
trade group.
   The funds' assets hit a record high $304.17 billion in the week
ended May 3, 1989.
   The Investment Company Institute said that in the latest week,
assets of 232 general purpose funds rose $1.03 billion to $100.80
billion, assets of 95 broker-dealer funds increased $573.5 million
to $129.47 billion, and assets of 141 institutional funds rose
$1.29 billion to $76.80 billion.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds in the
week ended Tuesday was 9.15 percent, unchanged from the previous
week, according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade journal
based in Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield rose to 9.17 percent from 9.16 percent,
Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was
unchanged at 34 days, Donoghue's said.
   Separately, the newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of
100 leading commercial banks, savings and loan assocations and
savings banks in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the
effective annual yield available on money market accounts was to
6.63 percent as of Wednesday, unchanged from a week earlier.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super
NOW accounts, was unchanged from a week earlier at 5.15 percent.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 9.31
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, down from 9.34 the
previous week. Yields were 9.48 percent on 1-year CDs, down from
9.51 percent; 9.27 percent on 2{-year CDs, down from 9.32 percent;
and 9.18 percent on 5-year CDs, down from 9.20 percent.

<HEAD>Sears Chairman Hopes For June Decision On Merchandising Move</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SHERI PRASSO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sears, Roebuck and Co. hopes to announce in June
where its 6,000-employee Merchandising Group will be moved, but is
``nowhere near'' a decision now, Chairman Edward A. Brennan said
Thursday.
   ``All I can say is that we're looking very hard at all of the
alternatives,'' Brennan told reporters following the company's
annual meeting. ``The truth is that we really don't have all of the
costs laid out.''
   Separately, Sears announced that Wayne E. Hedien, 55, had been
named chairman and chief executive of its Allstate Insurance Group.
   The appointment takes effect on July 1 on the retirement of
Richard J. Haayen. Hedien has been president of Allstate since
October 1986. Raymond H. Kiefer, 62, succeeds him in that job.
   Brennan said officials including Illinois Gov. James R. Thompson
and Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley were working to hard to keep the
Sears subsidiary in Illinois.
   He would not discuss what incentives were offered or compare
them to those offered by other states.
   He declined to comment on reports that the company is looking at
sites in Dallas and Charlotte, N.C., but did say Sears will not
move the Merchandise Group to northern Indiana.
   Brennan's news conference followed the company's first annual
meeting since it announced last October that it would sell the
Sears Tower _ the world's tallest building _ offer more brand-name
products and shift to everyday low prices.
   ``In 1988, a year of transition, Sears demonstrated that it is a
very strong company,'' he said. ``For the first time, we exceeded
$50 billion in revenues, an increase of 9.5 percent.
   ``We also recorded the second most profitable year in our
history: $1.45 billion. Yet we should do better, and I have every
confidence that we will,'' Brennan said.
   Brennan said company officials would like to keep most major
operations headquartered in the Chicago area for ``emotional
reasons.'' But he said Sears would need at least 1 million square
feet to house the Merchandise Group, space that would be greater
than most of the parcels it owns in the Chicago area.
   Brennan also reported that Sears expects $1.5 billion in
revenues this year from specialty stores: Western Auto, Eyecare
Centers of America, Tire America, NTW and Pinstripes Petites.
   ``Each of these companies, acquired in the last year, has a
winning formula for success,'' he said.

   Amway Corp. plans to spin off Avon Products
Inc.'s retail operation, comprising the popular Giorgio perfume and
other fragrances, if its $2 billion takeover bid for Avon succeeds,
Amway said Thursday.
   The company disclosed in a document submitted to the Securities
and Exchange Commission that it would retain Avon's worldwide
direct selling division if acquires its much larger rival.
   Put up for sale would be the business responsible for fragrances
Avon owns that are sold by department stores and other retailers,
but not by the independent sales representatives who offer Avon's
makeup, toiletries and jewelry.
   Amway also said it would continue Avon's strategy of selling its
interests in the health care services field.
   The retail operation includes higher-priced, ``prestige''
perfumes such as Giorgio Beverly Hills, Red, and Uninhibited by
Cher. Avon expects to more than $300 million in retail division
sales this year.
   Most of Avon's sales, which totaled $3.06 billion in 1988, are
made through an international sales force of about 1.5 million
representatives.
   William Nicholson, Amway's chief operating officer, said in a
telephone interview that several parties have expressed interest in
buying the Avon retail division. He declined to identify them.
   Several consumer products companies have stated their intentions
to expand and a well-established, successful prestige perfume line
might be a lucrative addition.
   Nicholson said Amway finds Avon an attractive takeover prospect
partly because ownerhip of Avon would open the door to markets
Amway has been trying to enter.
   ``Avon is well established in some international markets that'd
we'd love to get into,'' he said, naming Mexico and Brazil as
examples.
   Latin American countries have sufficient incomes to support
significant growth in their direct sales markets. So far, Amway is
operating only in Guatemala and Panama, he said.
   Amway also was motivated to pursue Avon by the opportunity to
turn Avon's sales representatives into distributors of a wider
array of products.
   Amway, a privately held company based in Ada, Mich., has about 1
million distributors around the world selling Amway household,
personal care and environmental products. Amway distributors also
sell Tandy computer gear, MCI Communications services, office
coffee making equipment and other brand name products.
   Nicholson said Avon has failed so far to capitalize on its
cosmetics business and broaden it into a full health and beauty
aids operation. Amway's cosmetic interests represent only a small
portion of the company's operations so an acquisition of Avon would
cause little duplication.
   Amway's $39-a-share takeover proposal places a value of about
$2.1 billion on the company based on nearly 54 million outstanding
Avon common shares. Amway also would have to acquire 18 million
preferred shares which could be converted into common in the event
of a takeover, adding about $700 million to the price.
   Speculators on Wall Street have indicated they believe that a
higher bid may be forthcoming.
   Avon shares closed at $39.50, off 37{ cents, in consolidated New
York Stock Exchange trading Thursday, after gaining $3.87{ on
Wednesday.
   Avon Chairman James Preston has said repeatedly the company is
not for sale but has said Avon's board would give Amway's offer
consideration.
   To bolster its defense against Amway, Avon has sued Amway and
its investment partner Irwin Jacobs. The partnership has said they
own about 10.3 percent of Avon common stock.
   Jacobs, a Minneapolis investor, is not involved in Amway's
takeover offer. But in its SEC filing, Amway said Jacobs may
``explore the possibility of purchasing'' some of Avon's assets if
the takeover succeeds but ``no agreement, arrangement or

   Avon spokesman John Cox said the company had no comment on

   Nicholson said Amway is awaiting a response from Avon.
   ``We believe that the board will invite us in for discussion and
we're waiting for that invitation,'' Nicholson said.

   The House voted Thursday to raise the minimum
wage to $4.55 an hour by October 1991, leaving only a final Senate
vote before the bill goes to President Bush, who has promised to
veto it.
   In the first major domestic policy dispute of the Bush
administration, neither house of Congress has backed down despite
Bush's insistence that the minimum should be raised only to $4.25
by January 1992 _ and then only if the proposal allows employers to
pay a lower ``training wage'' to new workers for six months.
   The minimum is now $3.35, where it has been since 1981.
   The only congressional action still required is a Senate vote on
the bill drafted by House-Senate negotiators, and that could come
as early as next week.
   There is virtually no doubt that Bush will follow through on his
promise to veto the measure and the 247-172 House vote for passage
suggested the Democrats remain short of the two-thirds majority it
would need to override the president.
   ``The House insisted on sending President Bush a bill that would
cost hundreds of thousands of Americans their opportunity to work _
a bill he most certainly will veto,'' Labor Secretary Elizabeth
Dole said shortly after the House vote.
   Still, Democratic leaders in both chambers have promised to
attempt an override.
   In the meantime, Democrats hope to bring public pressure on the
White House by characterizing Bush's position as unfair to the
working poor and by juxtaposing his veto threat with his plan to
spend billions of dollars to rescue troubled savings and loans and
his proposal to lower capital gains tax rates.
   ``The wealthiest of the wealthy would get tax breaks big enough
to hire two minimum wage workers each to take care of their gardens
or do their laundry,'' said Rep. William D. Ford, D-Mich. ``Is this
the Bush full employment program?''
   Speaker Jim Wright said the ``meager increase'' included in the
legislation still would leave the minimum wage trailing inflation
increases since the wage floor last was raised.
   ``Today we seek to provide fairness for the working poor of this
country,'' Wright said. ``There are at least 4 million of them who
receive no more than the minimum wage.''
   Republicans, however, said Democrats were passing up an
opportunity to increase the minimum wage by accepting Bush's more
modest offer and instead had decided on waging a political battle
with the White House for control of the domestic-policy agenda.
   The Republicans also reiterated their contention that raising
the minimum wage without also establishing a six-month subminimum
for newly hired workers would trigger massive job losses.
   ``The bottom line is it will cost at least 650,000 new jobs in
three years, the very people that we want to bring into the
workforce to help them become productive members of society,'' Rep.
Steve Bartlett, R-Texas, said of the bill passed Thursday. ``There
can be no further compromise that throws people out of work.
President Bush has offered the compromise.''
   Bush had proposed raising the minumum wage to $4.25 an hour by
January 1992 provided employers could pay new hires the ``training
wage'' for six months.
   In rejecting that offer, Democratic leaders said Bush's proposed
increase was too small and also assailed his ``training wage''
because the provision requires no actual training. In their final
bill, Democrats allowed workers with less than 60 days of work
experience to be paid a subminimum.
   In the Senate, much like the House, sponsors have more than
enough votes to gain passage of the measure but seem short of the
two-thirds majority needed to override a veto.
   ``If he vetoes it, then he has declared the end of the
honeymoon,'' said Rep. Austin Murphy, D-Pa..
   The result of a veto, Murphy said, will be action on a lengthy
list of Democrat-sponsored bills dealing with such issues as
parental leave, child care and mandatory health insurance.
   ``A veto would tell other members there is no reason to say the
president is trying to get along,'' said Murphy. ``That would
undoubtedly cause the sponsors of those bills to demand that they
advance.''
   But administration aides have said one of the reasons Bush will
veto the minimum-wage bill is to assert his position on domestic
policy to prevent the Democrats' agenda from gaining momentum.
   Business and labor groups plan media campaigns and other
lobbying efforts to pressure lawmakers considered to be potential
swing votes in an attempted veto override.
   Proponents of the bill also are trying to draft another minimum
wage bill for quick consideration should they lose the veto fight,
which appears likely.

   The dollar gained value against most major
currencies Thursday despite further evidence of a slowdown in U.S.
economic growth.
   Gold prices rose, partly in response to the tension in Panama.
   Foreign-exchange dealers said demand for dollars appeared
unaffected by a Commerce Department report that retail sales rose
by only 0.4 percent in April. Economists said the weak sales figure
showed the extent to which higher interest rates and inflation are
discouraging consumer spending.
   Lee Stalzer, an assistant vice president at Amsterdam Rotterdam
Bank, said there was no indication that central banks intervened in
the currency markets to influence exchange rates.
   ``Until we get some concerted intervention, where they really
mean business, the dollar will continue to go up,'' she said.
   In London, one British pound cost $1.6655 late Thursday, cheaper
for buyers than late Wednesday's $1.6717. Sterling weakened against
the dollar in New York, ending the day at $1.6645 compared with
$1.6740 on Wednesday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York compared with Wednesday's
late rates included: 1.9160 West German marks, up from 1.9020;
135.37 Japanese yen, up from 134.41; 1.7080 Swiss francs, up from
1.6921; 1.1870 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1843; 6.4755 French
francs, up from 6.4220; and 1,395.75 Italian lire, up from 1,385.25.
   Late rates for the dollar in Europe compared with Wednesday's
late rates: 1.9135 West German marks, up from 1.9047; 1.7060 Swiss
francs, up from 1.6925; 6.4665 French francs, up from 6.4645;
2.1580 Dutch guilders, up from 2.1500; 1,395.75 Italian lire, up
from 1,390.125; and 1.1870 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1849.
   Gold prices were bid higher as traders considered the
implications of President Bush's decision to send combat troops to
Panama. Frequently during times of political unrest or other
uncertainty, investors buy gold as a safe haven for their money.
   Bush said he was sending 2,000 combat troops to Panama and
evacuating U.S. dependents to protect Americans from the violence
that started after the country's presidential elections.
   Republic National Bank of New York quoted a bid of $379.40 for a
troy ounce of gold bullion at 4 p.m. EDT, up from late Wednesday's
bid of $376.60. Earlier gold bullion for current delivery rose
$3.30 a troy ounce to $381 on the Commodity Exchange in New York.
   Gold bullion prices improved slightly in Europe. Gold traded
late in London, the major market, at a bid price of $379.00 a troy
ounce, up from $377.25. The late bid price in Zurich, Switzerland,
was $378.20, up from $376.75.
   Earlier in Hong Kong gold closed at $377.25, down from $378.25.
   On New York's Comex, silver bullion for current delivery settled
at $5.65 a troy ounce, up from $5.607 Wednesday. Silver bullion
traded late in London at a bid $5.66 a troy ounce, down from $5.68.

   A federal judge declined to hold Minorco SA in
contempt of court Thursday, giving the South Africa-linked gold
producer a victory in its tangled takeover battle for Consolidated
Gold Fields PLC.
   However, U.S. District Judge Michael B. Mukasey said he might
reconsider his decision if Minorco tries to prevent Gold Fields
from voting its shares in an American mining concern.
   Last fall, Minorco, which is largely controlled by two South
African corporations, Anglo American Corp. of South Africa and De
Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd., launched a hostile takeover bid for
Gold Fields. Minorco, a Luxembourg corporation, already held almost
30 percent of Gold Fields' shares.
   British-based Gold Fields and its U.S. subsidiary, Newmont
Mining Corp., the largest gold producer in the United States, sued
in New York to block the takeover by Minorco.
   Last October, Mukasey issued an injunction barring Minorco from
acquiring more Gold Fields shares on antitrust grounds. He noted
that the combined entities would control nearly a third of the
non-communist world's gold market.
   Minorco now owns or has tenders for about 55 percent of Gold
Fields' shares, but Mukasey's injunction bars Minorco from buying
those shares it doesn't own.
   Gold Fields owns 49.3 percent of Newmont.
   On Tuesday, Britain's Panel on Takeovers and Mergers ordered
Gold Fields to drop out of the American lawsuit, leaving Newmont as
the only obstacle to the $5.9 billion takeover.
   But unless Minorco can get Newmont to withdraw its lawsuit, the
bid for Gold Fields will expire next Wednesday under British
regulations.
   Minorco, which previously promised to divest itself of Newmont
if allowed to complete the takeover, has been trying to find a
bidder for the shares of Newmont not owned by Gold Fields.
   Newmont expressed concerns at a hearing Wednesday that if
Minorco could get an ally to buy 51 percent of Newmont's stock,
Minorco could break the effective control over Newmont that Gold
Fields now has with its 49 percent stake. Then Minorco could
effectively force Newmont to drop the lawsuit blocking the takeover.
   Newmont asked Mukasey to hold Minorco in contempt, claiming
Minorco's maneuvering to try and find a buyer for Newmont violated
Mukasey's injunction.
   Mukasey, however, declined to find Minorco in contempt for now.
   In a two-page order issued early Thursday, Mukasey said he would
entertain another request to hold Minorco in contempt if it took
any steps that altered Gold Fields' effective control over Newmont.
   Mukasey gave Newmont until Monday to reply in writing to
Minorco's latest request to dissolve the injunction. Minorco will
make its counter reply on Tuesday and has until Wednesday to
complete the bid for Gold Fields or let it lapse.

   Stock prices rose slightly Thursday in
restrained trading that reflected uncertainties over news from
Panama, the progress of a Treasury debt auction and an upcoming
report on inflation.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 8.43 to 2,382.88.
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a margin of about 4 to
3 in nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks,
with 785 issues up, 602 down and 568 unchanged.
   After an early selloff, the market moved higher behind
strengthening bond prices, which rose on a Commerce Department
report of lower-than-expected retail sales figures for April. The
government said retail sales rose a modest 0.4 percentage point
last month.
   Analysts said the number pointed to a slower economy, giving the
markets impetus to move out of their recent slump by signaling
lower interest rates.
   But activity remained subdued with investors awaiting the final
day of the Treasury's $28.75 billion three-day round of borrowing.
There was uncertainty over how a new glut of Treasury debt would be
absorbed.
   Many market participants also withdrew in nervous reaction to
President Bush's announcement he was sending more troops to Panama.
   ``That kept some traders on the sidelines wondering what steps
might be taken there,'' said Charles Jensen, technical analyst with
MKI Securities Corp. ``Otherwise, we might have had a better
response.''
   The market has spent most of the week waiting for April producer
price numbers, which it hopes will provide a clearer indication of
inflation in the economy. Observers said last Friday's jobless
report confused investors, because while it showed higher
unemployment and a slowing economy, it also showed that wages rose
substantially in April, suggesting inflation is still a problem.
   The producer price report is scheduled for release Friday
morning.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 151.62 million
shares, up from 146 million in the previous session.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 179.12 million shares.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market rose $9.645, or 0.32 percent, in
value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
0.58 to 171.71.
   Among actively traded issues on the NYSE, Avon fell ] to 39{,
Pan Am lost ] to 4| and IBM dropped { to 109[.
   Hilton Hotels, meanwhile, surged 6{ to 72 on news that the
company would consider takeover offers. Block Enterprises also rose
1[ to 27] and General Electric gained 1[ to 49.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 1.33 to 353.48, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index gained 1.15 to 306.95.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market rose
0.99 to 430.63. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 345.62, up 0.82.

   The energy futures market rebounded sharply
Thursday on technical factors, with gasoline prices showing
particular strength.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the June contract for West
Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude oil, settled
54 cents higher at $20.06 a barrel. The contract had fallen 24
cents on Wednesday.
   Among refined petroleum products traded on the exchange,
wholesale unleaded gasoline for June delivery jumped 2.56 cents to
67.28 cents a gallon after losing 0.80 cent on Wednesday. June
heating oil, which rose 0.49 cent Wednesday, settled at 48.68 cents
a gallon, up another 1.20 cents.
   Longer-term contracts showed smaller gains.
   Richard Redoglia, a vice president at Merrill Lynch Energy
Futures, said the gains resulted from a technical reaction to a
sharp decline in prices in previous sessions as well as from
concern over the political situation in Panama following Sunday's
presidential election.
   ``The market has just found itself in a real nervous position,''
Redoglia said.
   Some of the concern may be unfounded in terms of endangering the
supply of oil. Although Alaskan crude moves through a pipeline in
Panama en route to the Gulf Coast, analysts noted that the volume
of oil carried is not significant.
   Gains in gasoline prices were particularly strong. Traders said
prices that were knocked down in previous sessions presented
investors with an incentive to buy.

<HEAD>Money Supply Falls</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The two broadest measures of the nation's money
supply fell in the week ended May 1, the Federal Reserve Board
reported Thursday.
   The Fed said the measure known as M2 fell to a seasonally
adjusted $3,071.3 billion from $3,082.1 billion the previous week.
   An even broader measure, M3, fell to a seasonally adjusted
$3,953.2 billion from $3,965.5 billion.
   The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, fell to a
seasonally adjusted $781.7 billion from $786.9 billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply
measures.
   The Fed in February reaffirmed a provisional target for 1989 of
3 percent to 7 percent growth in M2 and 3.5 percent to 7.5 percent
growth in M3. The Fed has not set a target for M1 growth since
early 1987.
   For the latest 13 weeks, M2 averaged $3,076.9 billion, a 1.6
percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous
13 weeks. M3 averaged $3,969.4 billion, up 3.7 percent, while M1
fell 1.1 percent to an average of $787.3 billion.
   In other reports:
   _The Federal Reserve said bank borrowings from the Federal
Reserve System at the discount window, excluding extended credit,
averaged $522 million a day in the week ended Wednesday, down from
$687 million the previous week.
   _The Federal Reserve said net free reserves totaled $670 million
in the two weeks ended May 3, up from net borrowed reserves of $377
million in the two weeks ended April 19.
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that the
monetary base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank
reserves held at Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and
in circulation, was $290.2 billion in the two-week period ended May
3, up from $288.3 billion two weeks earlier.

   Crude oil futures prices climbed back above $20 a barrel
Thursday and petroleum-product prices soared in a rally bolstered
by President Bush's decision to send combat troops to Panama.
   On other markets, grain and soybean futures fell; precious
metals advanced; cattle prices rose and pork futures were mixed.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, West Texas Intermediate
crude settled unchanged to 54 cents higher with the contract for
delivery in June at $20.06 a barrel; heating oil was .07 cent to
1.20 cents higher with June at 48.68 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .80 cent to 2.56 cents higher with June at 67.28 cents
a gallon.
   June crude, which reached a recent high of $21.60 a barrel on
April 26, dropped below $20 on Monday.
   Technical factors played a large role in Thursday's surge but
the Panamanian situation ``seemed to take on more importance as the
day wore on,'' said Jerry Samuels, an analyst with Shearson Lehman
Hutton Inc. in New York.
   Traders fear a military conflict in Panama could affect the
daily movement of 400,000 barrels of crude through the Panama Canal.
   Unconfirmed reports that Bush planned to send troops to Panama
circulated during the trading session. After the close Bush said he
was sending about 2,000 troops and evacuating dependents to protect
Americans in the turmoil arising from a presidential election that
the White House condemned as ``electoral theft'' by Gen. Manuel
Noriega.
   Soybean futures ended sharply lower on the Chicago Board of
Trade amid forecasts of rain and disappointment over the
government's reluctance to subsidize a sale of U.S. soybean oil to
the Soviet Union.
   Wheat and corn futures also retreated.
   The National Weather Service's new six-to-10-day outlook, issued
late Wednesday, calls for rain next week in the central Plains and
the western Corn Belt, two areas that have not shared in the
general recovery from last summer's drought.
   Soybean and corn futures also were pressured by expectations for
showers this weekend in the Midwest, analysts said.
   Additional selling of soybean futures stemmed from Agriculture
Secretary Clayton Yeutter's statement Thursday morning that the
USDA had not decided whether to subsidize the sale of U.S. soybean
oil to the Soviet Union. The market had expected a subsidized sale
to be announced.
   After the markets closed, the Agriculture Department issued a
report estimating 1989 U.S. winter wheat production at a decade low
of 1.43 billion bushels.
   The USDA's winter wheat estimate represented an 8 percent drop
from last year's harvest of 1.56 billion bushels. The report was
expected to prompt new buying of wheat futures on the Board of
Trade on Friday.
   Wheat settled 1} cents lower to 1{ cents higher with the
contract for delivery in May at $4.28 a bushel; corn was 1{ cents
to 3\ cents lower with May at $2.76\ a bushel; oats were 1{ cents
lower to { cent higher with May at $1.84{ a bushel; soybeans were
6} cents to 10\ cents lower with May at $7.51{ a bushel.
   The rise in oil prices spurred a moderate advance in
precious-metal prices, which tend to increase with signs of higher
inflation.
   Gold settled $2.30 to $3.30 higher with June at $382.10 a troy
ounce; silver was 3.8 cents to 4.8 cents higher with July at $5.735
a troy ounce.
   Most cattle futures ended slightly higher in light trading after
weakening earlier in the session. Pork futures settled mostly lower
amid profit-taking after two days of steep gains.
   Live cattle were .05 cent lower to .30 cent higher with June at
72.10 cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged to .28 cent
higher with May at 77.15 cents a pound; live hogs were .30 cent
lower to .07 cent higher with June at 48 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .75 cent lower to .45 cent higher with May at 35.05
cents a pound.

<HEAD>Government Says Former Top Executives Involved in Scheme to Pay Bribes</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government said in federal court Thursday
several former top executives of Goodyear International Corp. were
involved in a scheme to pay bribes to Iraqi officials to get tire
business.
   The Akron, Ohio, company paid a $250,000 fine after pleading
guilty to a single count of violating the anti-bribery provision of
the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977. The firm is a subsidiary
of Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co.
   From the fall of 1979 to the fall of 1983, Goodyear
International obtained $19 million in Iraqi government orders for
truck tires based on an agreement to pay nearly $1 million in
bribes, according to documents released in court.
   The activities were carried out by David J. Janasik, then the
company's regional export manager for the Middle East. Also
involved were senior Goodyear officials including the ex-director
of export operations and the former executive vice president, the
documents said.
   Janasik and Mohammed Jassem, an official of the Iraqi
state-owned trading organization, discussed Goodyear's interest in
getting a share of the tire business during a meeting in the
storage room of a Baghdad company, the papers said.
   Jassem told Janasik that Goodyear's competitors in France, Korea
and Japan had been willing to pay cash ``commissions'' to ensure a
good relationship with the purchasing organization, Iraqi Trading
Co.
   Jassem also said that absent such payments, Goodyear could hope
for only limited business, according to a government statement of
facts released in court.
   Janasik told Jassem that such payments were against Goodyear
corporate policy. Janasik related the meeting in a telephone call
to his superior, then GIC's assistant director for export
operations, at his office in Akron, Ohio, the statement of facts
continued.
   Janasik's superior discussed the conversation with his superior,
Goodyear International's regional director for Europe, and with a
company vice president.
   ``Regarding Janasik's contact in Iraq, the vice president told
the assistant export director to `get the business, I don't want to
know (how),''' according to the statement of facts. ``The assistant
export director telephoned Janasik and urged him to increase his
sales, by using his `contacts' to get business with Iraq.
   ``When Janasik reminded his superior of the conditions for
obtaining such business, the supervisor repeated his instruction
that Janasik was to obtain new business with the government of
Iraq,'' the statement said.
   A Goodyear spokesman in Akron, Ohio, Walter McClenny, declined
to comment when asked whether the other officials referred to in
the government's statement had left the firm or were transferred to
other positions.
   ``We don't want to name the people named in those allegations,''
McClenny said in an interview. He said the company is ``not in a
position to comment on the government's statement.''
   Goodyear generated the bribe money by arranging with a Greek
marketing company to perform superficial marketing studies not
worth the $430,000 that Goodyear paid. Goodyear generated an
additional $551,124 to pay the Iraqi officials through fictitious
invoices purporting to reflect Arab language advertisements of
Goodyear products in Baghdad newspapers.
   The payments went to Ayub Al Shakiri, an Iraqi who said he was
acting on behalf of several officials of the Iraqi Trading Co. The
Iraqi government purchased almost all of its tires for sale through
ITC.
   Janasik pleaded guilty to filing a false tax return in which he
failed to declare a $75,000 kickback he received from the Iraqi
intermediary for his services. He was fired by Goodyear, sentenced
to two years' probation and fined $10,000.
   Goodyear said in a statement it uncovered the wrongdoing after
initiating its own investigation into the case and that it alerted
the Justice Department and turned company findings over to the
government in 1985.

   USAir Group Inc. said Thursday it has sold its
entire fleet of 20 BAC 1-11 jetliners to McDonnell Douglas Corp. as
part of a deal in which the airline will buy $1.3 billion in new
aircraft from the manufacturer.
   The purchase price was undisclosed.
   Ten of the twin-engine, 74-seat planes will be leased back to
USAir by McDonnell Douglas until early August, when the aircraft
type will be phased out of USAir's fleet after 24 years of service.
   USAir recently bought 20 MD-82 jets from McDonnell Douglas, with
an option to buy 20 more.
   A subsidiary will continue to stock BAC 1-11 spare parts and
offer training on its BAC 1-11 simulator _ the only one in North
and South America, the company said.
   USAir acquired most of its BAC 1-11s in 1972 when its
predecessor company, Allegheny Airlines, merged with the former
Mohawk Airlines.

<TEXT>
   OPEC Secretary General Subroto on Thursday
repeated the cartel's call for stability in world energy markets,
while acknowledging that those markets were inherently unstable.
   Subroto told a luncheon audience of about 1,600 that the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries was determined that
recent oil market turmoil never be repeated.
   ``One need only look back three years to witness the collapse of
prices in the international oil market, which brought in its wake
chaos in the energy industry,'' Subroto said.
   The 13-nation cartel agreed last November to limit its
production to levels that would support a benchmark price of $18 a
barrel, about 18.5 million barrels a day. The action has helped
crude prices recover from their October 1988 lows of near $12 a
barrel.
   OPEC plans to review its production at a meeting scheduled to
begin June 5 in Vienna, Austria. There has been speculation the
cartel would increase its self-imposed production limits if demand
was strong enough to support higher output without depressing
prices.
   Subroto pointed to several inherent oil market factors that
cause instability, including the different levels of oil reserves
in OPEC member countries and the varying views leaders of those
countries have on long-term pricing.
   He also pointed to regionalization of the world oil market.
``Because of the dispersal of these regional markets, our member
countries' crudes are either long-haul or short-haul, which implies
certain market disadvantages based on the relative costs of moving
them to the market.''
   Subroto also said situations where member nations are
dissatisfied with their assigned quotas and unilaterally increased
production were destabilizing.
   Declaring there was no need for concern by U.S. consumers about
the security of OPEC-supplied oil, Subroto also said he expected
security of demand.
   ``In return for OPEC's commitment to security of supply,
therefore, our organization is entitled to expect from consumers,
policies which promote an orderly transition from finite oil
reserves to other energy resources _ policies which do not seek, at
any cost, to throttle oil demand,'' he said.
   ``The real need is for total cooperation in defense of market
stability and not in defiance of market forces,'' he said.
   Later at a news conference, Subroto said the cartel's history of
instability was behind it.
   ``OPEC now is a different OPEC,'' Subroto said. ``The
composition of oil ministers is different...more technocratic, more
businesslike.''

   The Bush administration on Thursday proposed a
$500 million oil spill cleanup fund to be financed by the oil
industry, even as Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner suggested
the cost of the Alaska spill could exceed that amount.
   Congress has been debating creation of such a fund for 15 years,
but supporters said the effort received little attention until the
tanker Exxon Valdez ran aground in March, dumping 11 million
gallons of oil into the pristine waters off Alaska.
   Skinner outlined the administration's proposal at a
congressional hearing during which he noted that the federal
government at the time of the Alaska spill had only a few million
dollars available specifically for cleanup efforts.
   Had that spill been caused by a company less well-to-do than the
Exxon Corp., the government would have had to scramble for funds
and ask Congress for tens of millions of dollars to get the cleanup
effort going, Skinner told the House Subcommittee on Coast Guard
and Navigation.
   Estimates of the cost of the Exxon spill, the worst in U.S.
history, have ranged widely, from about $100 million to many times
that amount.
   Skinner said it was too early to predict the total cost, but
said the amount would be substantial. He said Exxon expects to pay
as much as $75,000 an hour to workers cleaning the oil-fouled
Alaska shore in the coming months.
   ``The number are very big,'' he continued, indicating at one
point that even the proposed $500 million cleanup fund would have
been inadequate. He suggested that something in the range of ``$500
million to $1 billion should cover it.''
   The administration proposal, which is expected to be combined
with a similar bill already introduced in the House, calls for the
petroleum industry to finance the cleanup fund through a
1.3-cent-a-barrel fee on each barrel of domestic or imported oil
over the next five years.
   A maximum of $500 million could be spent in cleaning up any
single spill, but the president would have the authority to exceed
that amount in some cases, said Skinner. The government would then
seek additional fees from the industry, he said.
   At the same time, the administration proposed making the oil
company or shipper involved in a spill liable for up to $78 million
in recovery and cleanup costs before the federal fund would be
tapped. The maximum civil fines also would be increased to $10
million.
   Skinner said in light of the Exxon accident there is a need for
quick congressional action on establishing a comprehensive federal
liability and compensation system for oil pollution damage.
   Members of the House subcommittee noted that legislation calling
for such a cleanup fund has been introduced repeatedly in Congress
since 1975.
   ``It took a tragedy like the Exxon Valdez to cause the entire
Congress to focus on the issue,'' said Rep. Walter Jones, D-N.C.,
chairman of the Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee.
   Rep. Bill Tauzin, D-La., chairman of the Coast Guard and
Navigation Subcommittee, said he plans to schedule a vote on the
cleanup fund legislation before the end of the month.
   The fund could be used to pay for cleanup costs, damage to
natural resources, damage to private property and economic losses
directly related to a spill.
   But several members of the panel suggested that some of the
money in the fund should also be earmarked for Coast Guard efforts.
   The Coast Guard's emergency response teams have been largely
dismantled from 14 strike teams envisioned in the late 1970s to
only two in operation today, said Rep. Gerry Studds, D-Mass.
   Adm. Paul Yost, the Coast Guard commandant, said that in recent
years budget cuts have forced the Coast Guard to eliminate most of
its emergency response strike teams and cut back on research and
development programs involving oil spill damage control.

<TEXT>
   Legislation giving the secretary of
transportation the power to block buyouts of airlines if a
transaction would imperil flying safety was introduced Thursday by
Rep. Bob Carr of Michigan.
   Carr's bill would bar any acquisition that would give the
airline an even ratio of debt to equity unless the Transportation
Department, after a full review, found the airline could function
properly after the takeover and that the transaction wouldn't harm
the public interest.
   The East Lansing, Mich., Democrat said his bill was prompted by
the recent offer for Northwest Airlines by billionaire oilman
Marvin Davis.
   ``This is not an effort to shield inept management from market
forces,'' Carr said. The legislation was intended rather to shield
the public from ``high-stakes billionaires who would play
monopoly'' with the nation's air transportation system, he said.
   The Transportation Department, in ruling whether a takeover
could proceed, would under Carr's bill be required to consider the
financial fitness of the new owner, the likelihood that the
purchaser would comply with federal aviation laws and the
``managerial competence'' of the purchaser.
   If passed, the legislation would be retroactive to the beginning
of this year. Carr said he knew of no transactions so far concluded
that would be affected by the bill.
   The U.S. airline industry has been largely free from federal
regulation since 1978, although a takeover must comply with federal
antitrust laws.
   Carr argued that safety considerations mean corporate takeovers
of airlines deserve special treatment.
   Davis has offered $2.7 billion, or $90 a share, to buy
Northwest's parent, NWA Inc. Northwest, based in Eagan, Minn., is
the nation's fourth-largest airline.
   Corporate takeovers are often financed by the issuance of
high-yield ``junk'' bonds paid off through the sale of corporate
assets or stringent cost-cutting. Carr argued that reduced
maintenance was one area where a debt-ridden airline could cut
expenditures, thereby imperiling the safety of the flying public.

   A generic-drug company executive Thursday
accused the Food and Drug Administration of holding up approvals of
its products to retaliate against the firm for having sparked an
investigation into alleged bribery at the agency.
   Roy McKnight, chairman of Mylan Laboratories in Pittsburgh, told
a House subcommittee the company has met all the regulatory
requirements for approval to make a number of drugs at its new
Puerto Rico plant, drugs for which Mylan has approval to make at
other plants.
   ``We believe that the generic drug division is holding up
approvals because they believe Mylan started this investigation and
that this was one way to retaliate,'' McKnight told the panel.
   Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of the House Energy and
Commerce investigations subcommittee, said he will inform FDA
Commissioner Frank Young personally ``that any retaliation by any
FDA employee against the firms or individuals who testify before us
will not be tolerated.''
   Dingell also said he will ask Young to explain the steps he will
take to assure that Mylan and other companies testifying before the
subcommittee will not be discriminated against by the FDA.
   In response to Dingell's comments, acting FDA Deputy
Commissioner Jim Benson sent a letter to the congressman assuring
him there would be no retribution toward any of the companies that
testify, FDA spokesman Jeff Nesbit said. In addition, a memo was
sent to the generic drug division warning against any retaliation,
he said.
   Mylan's complaints about arbitrary and discriminatory treatment
by the FDA's generic drug division sparked the investigation that
so far has resulted in criminal charges against two FDA employees
and a drug company executive.
   McKnight, chairman and chief executive officer of Mylan, said
his company began having trouble with the generic drug division in
1985.
   He said the FDA, with no uniform standards for drug approvals,
applied the few policies governing the process inconsistently.
Also, chemist reviewers slowed down the process by making
unreasonable and repetitive requests for information and Mylan's
applications were inexplicably transferred from one chemist to
another during the process, he said.
   Cheryl Blume, Mylan vice president for scientific affairs, said
the company also has trouble getting information from the agency.
   ``Often it's walking through the halls of FDA and if you see a
reviewer, he'll share his information with you,'' she testified.
   McKnight and Edwin Cohen, president of Barr Laboratories, one of
the nation's largest generic drug makers, recounted a number of
instances in which they claimed their approval requests were
mishandled by the agency. Both alleged that the generic drug
division favored some companies over others.
   McKnight said he brought his complaints to supervisors in the
division, but when they did nothing his company launched its own
investigation, hiring its own investigators.
   Mylan turned its information over to the House investigations
subcommittee, which began an inquiry a year ago. The subcommittee
later turned over its evidence to the U.S. attorney in Baltimore
for criminal prosecution. In April, charges were filed against two
people in the case and earlier this week Charles Y. Chang, a former
generic drug division supervisor, was charged with taking bribes.
   The House panel is continuing its investigation, as is the U.S.
attorney.
   FDA spokesman Nesbit noted that the FDA asked the Health and
Human Services Department's inspector general two weeks ago to
audit the management and practices of the division.
   McKnight said little at the agency has changed.
   He said Mylan has been trying for more than 18 months to get FDA
approval to make several drug products at its new plant in Puerto
Rico. The company already has approval to make the drugs at its
Morgantown, W.Va., plant, he said.
   He said the company was told by an FDA employee ``that we would
never get approvals for Puerto Rico.'' He said the employee was
Walter Kletch, who appeared before the subcommittee under subpoena
last week but exercised his Fifth Amendment right and declined to
answer any questions.
   ``It's business as usual,'' McKnight told the panel.

<TEXT>
   Grand Metropolitan PLC is selling five food
processing units in Latin America as it continues to streamline
Pillsbury Co., which Grand Met bought earlier this year for $5.7
billion.
   On the sale block are a flour mill and pasta plant near Caracas,
Venezuela; two consumer foods plants in Guatemala City, Guatemala;
and a minority holding in a flour mill in San Salvador, El Salvador.
   Together they accounted for about $40 million in sales last year
in Pillsbury's $500 million International Foods division, the
company said.
   Pillsbury Chairman Ian A. Martin said the Latin American
interests are not strongly linked to the company's branded foods
businesses, ``and thus do not fit our long-term strategy.''
   Since January, Grand Met has fired 550 workers at Pillsbury
headquarters in Minneapolis and an equal number of non-restaurant
workers throughout the Burger King system, said Larry Haeg, a
Pillsbury spokesman.
   London-based Grand Met also sold Pillsbury's Azteca Mexican
Foods business and its S&amp;A Restaurant Corp., which included the
chains of Steak &amp; Ale and Bennigan's.
   In addition, Grand Met has shut down a pizza plant in Joplin,
Mo., a frozen fish plant in Santa Fe Springs, Calif., a sweet
potato plant in Turkey, N.C., and a potato side dish plant in Grand
Forks, N.D., Haeg said.
   The production from those plants has been shifted to other
Pillsbury plants, he said.
   Haeg declined to say what the asking price is for the Latin
American units.
   ``We'll consider all serious offers,'' he said.

   The Securities and Exchange Commission, in a
rare action, censured the Chicago Board Options Exchange on
Thursday, accusing the board of failing to enforce its own rules on
trading manipulation.
   The CBOE, the largest options exchange in the world, accepted
the censure without admitting or denying the government's
allegations. It is only the third time in 10 years that the federal
commission has censured one of the exchanges it regulates.
   The commission said that in 1986 the exchange's Business Conduct
Committee ignored compelling circumstantial evidence in failing to
initiate disciplinary action against 12 market makers, including a
former CBOE vice chairman, and seven affiliated firms.
   The agency and the exchange refused to identify the individuals
or their firms. However, an exchange source who spoke only on
condition of anonymity identified one of the 12 as Gary Lahey, who
was CBOE vice chairman at the time of the alleged misconduct in
1985.
   The 12 individuals and their firms were accused of a practice
known as ``chumming'' _ that is, they arranged to trade options
among themselves primarily for the purpose of creating an
artificial appearance of activity.
   As part of the settlement with the exchange, the SEC agreed not
to pursue action against the individuals and firms involved,
according to Mary H. Weiss, an attorney in the SEC's Chicago office.
   The government is also requiring the exchange to increase its
surveillance of trading and to periodically inform its members
about its rules prohibiting trading done to artificially influence
price or volume.
   The options involved included a number of over-the-counter
stocks and options on the Standard and Poor's 250, which tracks 250
over-the-counter industrial stocks. The options were listed on
several exchanges, so, falsely pumping up activity on the Chicago
exchange could attract more business to it and away from the others.
   Warren Moulds, a spokesman for the exchange, declined to answer
questions, but he read a statement, which said, in part: ``In the
interest of closing out an old matter, the CBOE voluntarily agreed
to the entry of the SEC order. ... The exchange had already
completed all undertakings called for in the order prior to the
order being entered.''

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar hit an eight-month high against the
Japanese yen Friday morning, while share prices on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange were sharply lower.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, a 89.14-point
gainer Thursday, ended the morning session at 33,839.36 points,
down 242.13 points, or 0.7 percent.
   After opening at 135.40 yen, up 0.85 yen from Thursday's close
of 134.55 yen, the dollar moved in a range of 135.40-.65 yen. The
currency was being traded at 135.48 yen at midday.
   It was the first time that the dollar traded at the 135.65 level
since Sept. 6.
   Traders said the dollar's surge followed overnight gains against
most major currencies, including the Japanese yen, on overseas
markets.
   The dollar's rise was triggered by a decision Thursday by U.S.
President George Bush to send more U.S. troops to Panama to help
protect the 51,000 American civilians living in that country, said
a trader at the Bank of Tokyo, who spoke anonymously. There are
10,000 troops already based at U.S. installations along the Panama
Canal.
   The U.S. currency is regarded as a safe haven in times of
international tension.
   In a press confernce Friday morning, Finance Minister Tatsuo
Maruyama said he was not alarmed by the dollar's surge. ``The
dollar was bought due partly to its (potential) strength at the
time of an emergency such as confusion,'' over the Panamanian
presidential election, Maruyama said.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, share prices declined on a broad
front due to concerns over the yen's fall and the possibility of a
discount rate hike.
   Some Japanese economists have said the nation's monetary
authorities are waiting to assess price data due later this month
before deciding on the timing for cutting the discount rate, which
now stands at a post-World War II low of 2.5 percent.
