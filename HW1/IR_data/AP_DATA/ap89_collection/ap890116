   A new NCAA rule requiring freshmen receiving
athletic scholarships to achieve a minimum score on college entrance
exams has revived an old debate: Are such tests unfair to minority
students?
   The argument centers on the alleged bias of the Scholastic
Aptitude Test and the ACT Assessment, each taken annually by about a
million college-bound high school seniors.
   Georgetown University basketball coach John Thompson walked off
the court Saturday night at the start of a game against Boston
College to protest Proposal 42, an NCAA rule barring colleges from
granting athletic scholarships to freshmen who fail to achieve a
minimum 2.0 grade-point average in high school and score less than
700 on the SAT or 15 on the ACT.
   That's a tightening of the controversial NCAA Proposition 48
instituted three years ago which allowed such scholarships to
athletes if they met either standard.
   Other coaches have joined in the outcry. Temple University
basketball coach John Chaney said Proposal 42, which is to go into
effect next year, will ``punish these kids who come from a poor
background and have a poor educational opportunity.''
   An Associated Press survey in 1986 found that nearly one out of
10 college athletic recruits failed to meet the standards under
Proposition 48. The results were not broken down by race.
   Critics for years have charged that the SAT, sponsored by the
College Board in New York, and the ACT Assessment, sponsored by the
American College Testing Program in Iowa City, are culturally biased
against women and minorities.
   Such critics as FairTest, a Cambridge, Mass., group, have charged
that the only thing the SAT and ACT reliably measure by requiring
knowledge of such words as ``regatta'' or ``aria'' is the family
income of the test-taker.
   Bob Schaeffer, public education director of FairTest, said Monday
that his organization is sending a letter to the National Collegiate
Athletic Association protesting the new rule as a ``blatantly
improper use of test scores which must be immediately abandoned.''
   ``We are convinced that the SAT cannot escape cultural bias,''
said Union College president John S. Morris nearly two years ago
when his school became one of about half a dozen Northeastern
liberal arts colleges that have dropped their SAT requirement in
recent years.
   The College Board and other defenders counter that their studies
show the SAT reliably predicts college success.
   Officials of The College Board were unavailable for comment
Monday because of the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday. But the board
has argued the test is fair; poor curricula and home factors are to
blame for the comparatively weak test results by minority youngsters.
   And NCAA officials have justified their standards by citing the
many well-publicized instances of barely literate athletes who find
few career opportunities after they have played their last college
game.
   Is the NCAA standard unreasonable?
   The SAT is a two-part, multiple-choice examination of mathematics
and verbal aptitude, each consisting of roughly 80 questions. The
highest score on each part is 800. To meet the NCAA standard of 700,
a student must average 350 on the math and verbal sections, or
answer roughly 13 out of 80 questions correctly on the math section
and 24 correct on the verbal.
   In other words, even with penalties for wrong answers, students
have a chance of meeting the NCAA standard through sheer guesswork.
   Whites as a group have outperformed minority students. In 1988,
white students averaged a combined 935 on the SAT, nearly 200 points
higher than blacks.
   But the NCAA standard is well within the grasp of the average
black student, according to College Board statistics. In 1988, black
students averaged 384 on the math portion and 353 on the verbal _ 37
points above the NCAA guideline.
   The NCAA standard, incidentally, is 204 points below the average
SAT for all students in 1988: 904.

<HEAD>Continued Reliance on Government Payments Casts Cloud Over US Agriculture</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Agriculture Department has been upbeat
about the prospects for farmers in 1989, but analysts also point out
there are some troublesome clouds along the horizon.
   For example, USDA economists Greg Hanson and Duane Hacklander say
this year's farm financial outlook is favorable, in large part
because of continued strength in crop and livestock sales.
   In all, gross sales values of commodities are expected to be in
the range of $148 billion to $152 billion, compared with $149
billion predicted for 1988.
   ``The fundamentals that undergird long-term trends in farm income
are strengthening,'' the two economists said in the current issue of
Agricultural Outlook magazine. ``Land markets improved in 1988 and
the farm balance sheet stabilized. Excess commodity stockpiles were
alleviated by the drought.''
   In 1989, they said, costs of farm production items, or inputs,
and commodity market prices will be in better balance.
   But Hanson and Hacklander added in their report that ``three
negative factors cloud the outlook'' for U.S. agriculture:
   _The farm sector will continue to rely heavily on government
payments in 1989, indicating that it has not fully regained a
competitive edge.
   _According to USDA estimates, about 15,000 commercial farms will
be ``financially on the ropes'' because of last year's drought.
About 15 percent to 20 percent of the highly specialized corn and
soybean farms in drought counties are probably under financial
stress.
   _Excess production, which lowers farm commodity prices, can occur
rapidly. The 1988 drought slashed crop production drastically, but
history shows that output often jumps sharply the following year.
   ``The livestock sector made a remarkable rebound in the
mid-1980s,'' the report said. ``Livestock receipts in 1989 are
forecast $10 billion higher than in 1985. But high crop prices
translate into high feed costs that could dampen livestock net
earnings.''
   Government payments to farmers are expected to decline sharply to
a range of $10 billion to $12 billion from about $14 billion in 1988
and $17 billion in 1987. Much of the slide can be linked to the
decline of surplus grain and other products held by the department's
Commodity Credit Corp., or CCC.
   More than a fifth of the direct government payments in 1989 will
be for the Conservation Reserve Program, the long-term plan that
enables farmers to take highly erodible cropland from production for
10 years.
   ``The 1988-89 trend to lower commodity program payments is not
necessarily representative of permanent gains in farm income and
financial health,'' the report said. ``But livestock receipts and
earnings have surged as legislation has reduced CCC (price support)
loan rates for feed grains.''
   Further, the report said, ``the drop in farm debt and land prices
in the mid-1980s and the rapid growth of exports in 1987-88 suggest
that agriculture can now better compete in world markets.''
   As used by the USDA economists, net farm income includes changes
in the value of inventories held by producers and their depreciation
expenses. For 1989, net farm income is forecast at $44 billion to
$48 billion, up by more than 20 percent from last year.
   ``This range assumes a return to near-trend (crop) yields, plus
additional production from 25 million to 30 million more planted
acres,'' the report said.
   In contrast, net cash income is forecast between $48 billion and
$52 billion, down 10 percent to 15 percent from 1988. Net cash
income is the difference between cash expenses and gross cash income
during the year.
   Last year, despite the drought, net cash income held up well
because many farmers had crops in storage from previous years and
were able to sell those at rising prices to offset 1988 production
losses from the drought.
   ``The critical period for many drought-stressed farmers will be
next spring,'' the report said. ``They will have less corn, soybeans
and spring wheat to sell from storage and will face the prospect of
larger planting expenses because of higher input costs and an
increase in planted acreage.''
   Despite government drought aid, cash flow and loan repayment will
be problems for many crop producers in the first half of this year.
   ``In terms of cash flow generated by production, farmers in 1989
will be less well off than in 1988,'' the report said. ``But, in
terms of wealth generated by production (income plus inventory
growth), farmers will be better off.''

   After eight years of unknown adventures,
Clem the cat returned to its original owners.
   ``I heard some meowing out on the front porch last Friday,'' Kurt
Helminiak said. ``When I opened the door, there stood a big,
long-haired, gray male cat.
   ``He walked into the house, checked it out for a few minutes,
then he purred and jumped up onto his favorite chair like he had
never been gone.''
   Helminiak said his family were incredulous at first, but he and
his wife, Julie, compared the cat to pictures they had taken eight
years earlier and confirmed Clem had come home.
   ``I let him out one cold night, when it was about 20 below zero,
and snowing and blowing, and he never came back,'' he said.
   The family searched for Clem throughout the neighborhood and
listed him as a missing cat with the Humane Society. They also put
up posters in stores, but the cat was never found.
   Clem is healthy, though a bit mangier. Another difference is that
Clem is now declawed, an indication that someone had taken care of
it at least part of the time, Helminiak said.
   ``He's so glad to be home,'' he said, ``that he won't even go
outside now.''

   For the dog who has everything, how about buying
an outdoor toilet bowl?
   ``This flushes doggie doo down the sewer,'' said Russ Xepoleas,
vice president for sales at Blue Magic Products Inc., of Stockton,
Calif. ``The hardest part is getting your dog to sit on it.'' The
football-sized bowl is designed to be attached to an outside drain
also hooked up to a water supply.
   That's just one of the items at the International Housewares
Exposition, which also includes electronics, bakeware, cleaning
items, furniture and home office products. The exhibit is held by
the National Housewares Manufacturers Association to help
manufacturers sell their products. It has been held 89 times since
1939.
   Among other new specialty pet items was a cardboard cat playhouse.
   ``Our customer is the Bloomingdale's and Neiman Marcus
customer,'' said designer Linda Coffey of Minneapolis.
   She said the cat house is painted with ``a combination of
classical columns and modern cat imagery.''
   Also available: a vanilla-flavored edible flying disk for dogs;
the Cat-A-Comb brush that attracts cats with its catnip scent and
removes hair as the cat brushes against it; and the vacuum cleaner
with a heat chamber inside that kills bugs after it sucks them out
of carpets and furniture.

   Prescott, a stocky Morgan gelding who spent 20
years with the Boston Police Department, ``paid his dues over and
over,'' according to Patrolman Emilio ``Moe'' Ciriello, the city's
top police horseman.
   So now the easy-going horse with plenty of street smarts is
headed to pasture, and he won't end up in a glue factory.
   A plot has been reserved for the 30-year-old Prescott at the
Angel View Pet Cemetery in Middleboro, said Ciriello.
   ``He's done it all,'' the policeman said of the horse, adding:
   ``Riots, strikes, parades, the marathon, busing, the Beatles,
Elvis Presley, Fenway Park. He's even made the Patriot's Day ride to
Lexington from the Old North Church with Paul Revere.
   ``But that's only half of it. Prescott made a horseman out of
dozens of rookie riders. He's a clever, streetwise, all-class horse.
We want him as long as we can have him, but you never know at his
age.''

   George Bush is dampening expectations of
dramatic moves during his first 100 days in the White House, tacitly
acknowledging that he will be busy wrestling with Congress over the
huge budget deficit.
   With the House and Senate both controlled by Democrats, Bush will
face ``a nine-month siege, not a 100-day breakthrough,'' predicted
Mitchell Daniels, a former political adviser for President Reagan
who also worked in the Bush-Quayle campaign.
   Indeed, the incoming president himself said in a recent interview
that he would ``feel like a spring colt'' if it were not for the
fiscal challenges accompanying his elevation on Friday to what he
called ``the ultimate'' job.
   Even as he struggles with the deficit, Bush also will give
priority to refining his strategy for dealing with the Soviet Union
in the rapidly changing climate under Mikhail Gorbachev, officials
said.
   Moscow has put new pressure on Bush by recently promising major
troop cutbacks and destruction of some chemical weapons.
   Bush's first major trip will be to Japan for the Feb. 24 funeral
of the late Emperor Hirohito.
   He has said he would like to see a NATO summit as the alliance
marks its 40th anniversary in April and will gather in Paris in July
with the leaders of six other Western powers for the annual economic
summit of major industrialized nations.
   During the campaign, Bush said he wanted an early meeting with
Gorbachev. But after he and Reagan and Gorbachev got together in New
York last month, Bush said there was no pressure for him to see the
Kremlin leader again soon.
   Bush has promised several other summits: a global conference on
the environment, a hemispheric meeting on illegal drugs and a
meeting of the nation's governors about educational problems. Bush
may be ready to announce the dates for the educational summit when
the governors hold their annual meeting in Washington in late
February.
   On another front, Bush has made clear he will move quickly to
propose new ethics legislation covering administration officials and
members of Congress. As one of his first steps, Bush will name a
commission to propose ways to strengthen ethics laws, and instruct
the panel to report back within 30 days.
   Another priority will be ``attacking the perception that the
Republican Party is somehow not interested in the problems of the
poor, minorities and disadvantaged,'' said David Beckwith, press
secretary to Vice President-elect Dan Quayle. The deficit sharply
limits funds for this effort, but Beckwith said, ``Making them a
priority makes a statement, and nothing gets done unless it's on the
front-burner.''
   Along those lines, the White House staff will contain a new slot,
filled by Gregg Petersmeyer, to spearhead Bush's ``thousand points
of light'' campaign to encourage people to volunteer their services
to the poor.
   Typically, a new president tries to do something to distinguish
himself from his predecessor and set a tone for his administration.
Yet, analysts caution against anything dramatic in the Bush White
House.
   ``I would be surprised if it would start off with a bang,'' said
Stephen Hess, a Brookings Institution senior fellow. ``I think it
will build. The pacing seems to be more deliberate.''
   Most of the people in Bush's Cabinet are government professionals
who are regarded as pragmatists rather than ideologues. ``We do not
expect them to make careless mistakes,'' Hess said.
   Daniels, the former adviser to Reagan who was a top adviser to
Quayle's campaign, said: ``Fast starts are always useful but it is a
lesser concern in this administration because ... their
opportunities are limited. The Hill is stacked against them.''
   Moreover, Daniels said, ``They're also constrained by the budget
and by the shortage of flagship issues coming out of the campaign.''
   Bush says the change of command also is different now because
it's the first time in 152 years that a vice president was elected
to succeed his boss.
   ``I've been part of this administration and it isn't like there
is the need for radical change,'' Bush said in an interview. ``It's
the concept of building on what has been done.''
   Bush said he would make his mark by ``style, message, people _ be
yourself. ... I'm not vice president. I'm president. I'm the one
who's calling the shots. I'm the one who's going to set the agenda.
I'm the one who's going to have to do that which President Reagan
did very gracefully _ take the heat if something went wrong.
   ``So, automatically that happens. That happens at the time when I
put my hand on that Bible and hold my right hand in the air and say
that oath,'' he said. ``It happens.''
   Calling his new job ``the ultimate,'' Bush said, ``The presidency
is still the place from which to lead and from which to affect
change, hopefully change for the better.''
   Yet, his opportunities are limited by the budget deficit, pegged
at $92.5 billion in Reagan's last proposal.
   ``If it weren't for this deficit looming over everything else,
leave all the rest of the problems in there, I'd feel like a spring
colt,'' Bush said.
   One of his first steps after the inaugural fanfare will be to
name a team of administration negotiators for budget talks with
Congress. Richard Darman, Bush's budget director, already has spent
many hours on Capitol Hill exploring possibilities for a two-year
plan to cut the deficit.
   Around Feb. 9, the new president will send a budget message to
Congress, disclosing a formula to ``add here and take off there''
from the $1.15 trillion spending plan submitted by President Reagan.
   On probably the same day, Bush will address a joint session of
Congress to highlight his spending priorities.
   Heralding a ``kinder, gentler America,'' Bush promised in his
campaign to increase spending for education, for the Head Start
program, for expanded Medicaid payments to low-income pregnant woman
and their babies.
   On top of that, Bush faces the problems of a cleanup of the
nation's nuclear weapons complex and the crisis of the nation's
savings and loan industry.
   Discounting the theme of a big 100-day beginning, Jim Pinkerton,
who will be a top Bush aide for planning, keeps a note on his desk
that reads: ``All this will not be finished in the first 100 days.
Nor will it be finished in the first 1,000 days, nor in the life of
this administration nor even perhaps in our lifetime on this planet.
But let us begin.''
   It is a paragraph, Pinkerton notes, from John F. Kennedy's
inaugural address.

   President Reagan, who came to Washington vowing
to cut the federal government down to size, slowed its growth and
trimmed its sails but fell short of many of his more ambitious goals.
   ``He hasn't done any of it,'' Melvin Laird, former secretary of
defense and White House counselor who served for years as a
Republican member of the House Appropriations Committee, said in an
interview.
   ``He hasn't done much to change the size of the bureaucracy,''
said Philip Buchen, White House counsel in the Ford adminstration.
   ``He promised more than he could deliver,'' said Charles W. Dunn,
professor of political science at Clemson University and a former
Republican congressional aide.
   ``He has punched at the marshmallow, and the marshmallow has
absorbed his punches pretty effectively,'' said Dunn. ``He has
changed the shape of the marshmallow a little bit but obviously not
as much as he wanted to.''
   ``I wouldn't call it a revolution; I would call it more of a
retrenchment,'' said Herman Belz, a neo-conservative historian at
the University of Maryland.
   That there has been a change and a retrenchment few deny.
   From 1958 to 1980, according to figures from the Office of
Personnel Management, the federal civilian work force, excluding
postal workers, increased by 420,000, or about 24 percent. Over the
past eight years, it increased by 33,000, or about 1.5 percent,
compared with an average population growth in the United States of
about 1 percent.
   ``So the change has been in the rate of the growth of government,
which essentially has stabilized in this period,'' said William
Norton, director of executive administration for the Office of
Personnel Management.
   ``I think what you can say about Reagan is that the size of the
domestic government is smaller overall than it would have been
otherwise,'' said John E. Chubb, senior fellow in governmental
studies at the liberally oriented Brookings Institute.
   In his 1980 campaign, Reagan pledged to abolish two Cabinet
departments, the Department of Energy and the Department of
Education. Both are still in place and Congress, with Reagan's
support, created a new department by upgrading the Veterans
Administration to Cabinet status.
   Government ownership of Conrail, general revenue sharing and
urban development action grants were eliminated during Reagan's
administration. The Civil Aeronautics Board and Community Services
Agency also fell by the wayside, but both these were due to actions
in the Carter administration that took effect after Reagan became
president.
   The neo-conservative scholar Belz said one thing that ``made a
big difference'' was a Reagan executive order requiring agency
regulations to be reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget.
This, too, however, was a legacy of the Carter administration, an
outgrowth of the Paperwork Reduction Act that Carter signed a few
weeks before leaving office.
   ``Rather than necessarily cutting down the number of agencies, he
has made what exists work better,'' said Barbara Clay, spokeswoman
for the budget office.
   ``Prior to this administration, there were something like over
400 financial accounting systems in the government and they were all
incompatible,'' she said. ``So what Ronald Reagan has done is to
install a governmentwide financial accounting system in order to
make sure that, for instance, Agriculture's numbers are comparable
to Commerce's numbers.'
   ``Overall,'' Ms. Clay said, ``what has happened is that we have
put in management tools and systems that didn't exist prior to this
administration.''
   In addition to such bookkeeping improvements and steps to share
power with state and local governments, Reagan gets credit for
helping, along with the staggering budget deficit, to make the
government establishment more cost-conscious.
   ``Everyone who has any say about the purse strings is conscious
that they have got to curtail the spending,'' said Buchen. ``It is
remarkable, it seems to me, that he has had so many converts among
the Democrats.''
   ``The results are pretty dismal, but the talk is much better than
it used to be,'' the former Ford White House aide said. ``Congress
was never even talking like that. Now at least they pay lip service
to the idea of cutting back.''
   Brookings' Chubb said: ``Since Reagan has been in office, the
agenda has really changed to what I would call an agenda of limited
government. Now we are really talking about what the government can
get out of, what the government can use the private sector to
accomplish, what the government can accomplish through state and
local government and so forth.''
   By Chubb's calculations, discretionary domestic programs such as
education, health and transportation have ``been, in real terms, cut
in half, and all of the slack has been picked up surprisingly by
state governments and to some extent local governments.''
   Vaughn Davis Bornet, a professor emeritus of history at Southern
Oregon State College who has written extensively on the Johnson
administration, said Reagan ``has essentially diminished the power
of the central government and given a lot of that power back to the
states, exactly what Johnson did in reverse.''
   ``Beyond that,'' said Bornet, who classifies himself as a
moderate Republican, ``if you look at the fine print _ expenditures,
war on poverty, education and so on _ it seems to me he has not
reduced the federal expenditures in this area or the bureaucracy
very much either.''
   Clemson political scientist Dunn, however, said Reagan's
``ideology and the symbols of his ideology have helped him shift the
tone of national debate. And that, in tandem with the budget
deficit, has forced liberal Democrats to be leery of proposing new
programs.''
   Chubb at Brookings said that as long as the budget deficit
endures, the pressures to hold down domestic spending will remain _
and he is not sure it is an accident.
   ``The budget deficit is Reagan's insurance policy,'' he said. ``I
don't know whether he took it out intentionally or inadvertently,
but it's the guarantee that we won't move in another direction or
develop another agenda until that's under control.''
   Although Reagan spoke out against a ``Washington colony'' of
entrenched Potomac veterans, old Washington hand Laird said he
believed the president fit comfortably into that scene himself in
contrast to Carter, who remained an outsider through his four years
in the White House.
   ``I think he has gotten along very well with the people who have
been around in government,'' the former secretary of defense said.
``He always acts as though he wants your help and counsel and
advice.''
   As to why Reagan did not move further to dismantle the federal
government he campaigned so hard against, Laird said, ``I think he
has found there was a place for it.''

   The bunting is draped, tuxes are rented, hair
is coiffed, hotels are filling up, strings are tuned, caviar is
spread and the champagne's on ice. Washington is ready to party.
   True to a grand old American tradition, it will take George Bush
less than a minute at noontime Friday to repeat the 35-word oath of
office making him president of the United States. But his
well-wishers will require four days to celebrate.
   When the last drink is spilled and the last dance is over,
they'll leave town with a $25 million hangover after the biggest and
most expensive inauguration in U.S. history.
   The party officially begins Wednesday afternoon with a
candle-lighting ceremony at the Lincoln Memorial, and reaches a
glitzy crescendo Friday night at no fewer than 11 inaugural balls
where upwards of 60,000 invited guests are paying for the privilege
of jostling for brief glimpses of Bush and his vice president, Dan
Quayle.
   In addition to the 16 official inaugural events _ including a
sobering worship service for 2,800 people next Sunday morning at
Washington Cathedral _ there'll be hundreds of cocktail parties,
receptions, teas, dances, dinner parties, breakfasts, buffet
lunches, hootenannies and shindigs from Embassy Row to downtown
corporate suites.
   Ridgewells Caterers is dispatching 60 trucks and 700 waiters to
serve 20,000 gourmet meals from Capitol Hill to Georgetown during
the heaviest crush on Friday, said company president Jim Caulfield.
   ``Every office with a window on Pennsylvania Avenue for the
parade will have a party,'' he said.
   Windows Catering Co. is cutting 1,000 elephant-shaped cookies for
a parade brunch and flying in mussels from New Zealand, freshwater
shrimp from Alabama, crayfish from Louisiana and belon oysters from
Maine for another party at the National Gallery of Art.
   To handle the inaugural demand for its power clientele, the posh
Ritz-Carlton Hotel says it has imported 60 pounds of white truffle
mushrooms from Paris (at $400 a pound), 1,000 pounds of wild boar
sausage, 1,080 quail eggs, more than a ton of Norwegian salmon, 800
quarts of raspberries and nearly 7,000 bottles of wine.
   Dining around town will range from box lunches for inaugural
parade spectators to a lavish black-tie candlelight dinner for Bush,
Quayle and Republican Party stalwarts and fat-cat contributors at
newly refurbished Union Station. The inaugural dinner is so popular,
even at $1,500 a plate, that it will spill over into the Corcoran
Gallery of Art and the sprawling Pension Building.
   A soup kitchen dinner will be served to the homeless outside
Union Station while diners inside feast on Maryland crab loaf,
mushroom-stuffed roast loin of veal, asparagus bundled in carrot
curls, a green salad with Vermont cheddar cheese and _ for dessert _
apple-cranberry brown betty with cinnamon ice cream and bourbon
custard.
   The most expensive show in town is the star-studded inaugural
gala for 12,000 invitation-only guests Thursday night at the
Washington Convention Center, where an eight-seat box is selling for
$25,000.
   The two-hour show, to be broadcast live on CBS television,
features such top Broadway and Hollywood talent as Frank Sinatra,
Anita Baker and Julio Iglesias. There'll also be classical music and
_ in deference to Bush's taste for country and Western music _
down-home singing by such Nashville luminaries as Randy Travis and
Loretta Lynn.
   For inaugural fans with smaller pocketbooks, there's a salute to
Barbara Bush in all three major halls of the Kennedy Center at
midday Thursday. A $50 ticket buys you the choice of such
Hollywood-on-the-Potomac headliners as Arnold Schwarzenegger,
Charlton Heston and Cheryl Ladd.
   Not to be outdone, environmentalists are sponsoring a black-tie
Clean Air Inaugural Ball in the U.S. Botanic Garden _ ``the nation's
greenhouse'' _ Friday night. Across town the same evening, Americans
for Democratic Action is offering ``beer, wine and great munchies''
for their inaugural party. The invitations say it will be an
occasion where ``card-carrying liberals raise `L'.''
   The hottest ticket in town _ they're sold out, folks _ gets you
into the ``Black Tie and Boots Ball,'' given by the Texas State
Society. The 5,500 tickets to the Saturday night blowout were
snapped up within 24 hours and an additional 3,000 checks were
returned with regrets.
   Undaunted, one disappointed Houston socialite called Rep. Charles
Stenholm, D-Texas, the society's president, and informed him she had
bought a $6,000 gown for the occasion and was coming anyway. There
were legions of tales about what people were trying to do to get
hold of a pair of the $50 tickets.
   With Bush, the Lone Star State's adopted son, expected to attend,
the Texas bash offers Tex-Mex food, bouquets of yellow roses and
two-step dance tunes by Jody Nix and the Texas Cowboy Band. The
grand door prize: a brand-new red Ford pickup truck outfitted with a
gun rack.
   In addition to nine black-tie balls ticketed at $175 apiece,
there will be two casual-dress balls for 12,000 youngsters at two
locations Friday night, plus a ``Celebration for Young Americans''
the following night that features Joe Cocker, Bo Diddley and other
rock and rhythm and blues stars.
   Even the Beach Boys, once banned from the annual Fourth of July
celebration on the Mall by former Interior Secretary James Watt, are
back in good favor. They were scheduled to perform before Bush and
Quayle at the opening inaugural ceremony at the Lincoln Memorial on
Wednesday.

<HEAD>Another Inauguration, Another Arrest for Capitol Character</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER DIXON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Another presidential inauguration is likely to
mean another arrest for Stacy Abney, an expatriate Texan who is
routinely carted away by police from a Capitol archway whenever new
presidents and foreign dignitaries appear.
   Abney has been arrested 21 times for refusing to leave the
archway, where he has slept on scraps of carpet for the past 14
years.
   Rain falling on a recent January day sluiced over the edge of the
archway and kept Abney from his usual daytime perch in the middle of
the Capitol's main steps, where he crouches with a placard listing
health problems blamed on his World War II military service.
   Tourists, he says, have told him the Capitol steps ``are too
good'' for someone like him. But as the chilling cold turns each
word into puffs of mist, he declares that he isn't going anywhere
until the government relents and gives him disability payments.
   An arrest at this year's inauguration of a fellow Texan, George
Bush, ``is a given,'' says U.S. Capitol Police spokesman Dan
Nichols. ``As part of his protest he refuses to leave.''
   Abney is cited for unlawful entry when he won't budge for police
securing the building for special occasions. So far, he's been
arrested 21 times, Nichols said.
   He is taken to a District of Columbia jail, but always comes back
to the Capitol upon his release.
   ``Mr. Abney is never disorderly,'' Nichols said. ``He's very
docile as far as police go. He presents no special problems.''
   Nichols, who used to patrol the east side of the Capitol where
the 77-year-old stages his lone and silent protest, says tourists
sometimes complain that Abney ruins their pictures, sitting on the
imposing Capitol steps with his roughly scrawled cardboard sign.
   Nichols says he always explained to the visitors that only in the
United States would a protester be allowed to demonstrate at the
foot of the Capitol. ``They should be happy that's allowed in our
country,'' he said.
   ``We consider him a demonstrator, not a homeless person,''
Nichols said. ``He demonstrates every day on the Capitol steps and
at night, by being on the Capitol grounds.''
   Born a mile from the Louisiana border in northeast Texas, Abney
says he came to the Capitol to fight for disability benefits he
believes he deserves for serving in the military _ 18 months and six
days in the United States and 25 months and two days overseas, in
England, France, Belgium and Germany.
   He said that after his discharge, doctors told him not to work on
account of his weak heart, high blood pressure, gout and arthritis,
and he hasn't held a job since 1948.
   ``I don't get nothing from the VA (Veterans Administration) in
Texas for 29 years,'' he says, so he came to Washington.
   He says some people give him food and money as they bustle past
him on their way to tend to congressional business, but he still
shivers through the winter and swelters in the summer.
   ``When the wind comes through here, it's as cold as ice. I stand
here all day in the cold, freezing weather. I ain't got no sign of
fire, no sign of heat,'' he says, wiping a drop of rain from his
face with a crumpled paper towel.
   In the summer, he says, he finds places where he can rinse the
dirt from himself and his clothes.
   ``Then I sit out in the sun like an animal and get dry,'' he says.
   He refuses to move to a shelter for the homeless, because, he
says, it would be ``h-e-double-l.''
   ``Why sure, I'm lonely,'' he says. ``Who wouldn't be, stuck out
here like this 24 hours a day? But no, I'm not sad. I'm not worried.
   ``I wasn't getting anywhere so I came up here and decided to
fight until I get it. I haven't gotten it but I'm still fighting.''

   Youngsters in some 25,000 schools across the
nation are boning up on the ``where'' of the world, in hopes of
winning the first National Geography Bee, a contest emulating the
popular annual spelling bee.
   Recent studies have shown that young Americans lack geographic
knowledge, and the National Geographic Society chose a contest as
one means of battling that shortcoming.
   ``We hope that the National Geography Bee will encourage more
schools to teach geography _ and reward those students who do well
in it,'' said Robert L. Breeden, a senior vice president of the
geographic society.
   Top prize is a $25,000 college scholarship, with a $15,000
scholarship for second place and $10,000 for third.
   The 50 state winners will receive $100 each, books, a T-shirt and
a trip to Washington for the national contest.
   Here are some examples of questions awaiting the contestants:
   1. The geographic center of North America is located in which
state?
   2. In which two hemispheres is North America located?
   3. Where is the rainiest spot in the contiguous 48 states?
   4. Which countries have more land area than the United States?
   5. Name the four oceans.
   6. The present-day horse was introduced into the Western
Hemisphere by people from which country?
   7. What devastating storm has a funnel-shaped cloud?
   8. What type of fencing ended the open range of the American west?
   9. What is Iceland's most important export?
   10. Name two of the four states with names beginning with ``M''
that do not border Canada.
   School-level competition for fourth through eighth-graders is
already underway in many areas. Some 83,000 public and private
schools across the nation were invited to participate, and 25,000
did so, according to the National Geographic.
   The top 100 geography students in each state will then be chosen
through a written exam given to the school winners.
   State championships will be held April 7, with the top student in
each state coming to Washington for the national championship May
18-19.

   The record cost of the Bush inauguration will
be matched by a record number of free events open to the public, say
inaugural planners intent on proving they are not preoccupied with
``gold and glitter.''
   Officials estimate 70 percent of their events are free _
including a forum for high school students, a children's festival
and a public White House welcome that will constitute George Bush's
first official act as president.
   Those events cost money and don't bring in any, but they're a key
element in an inaugural schedule designed to foster inclusiveness
and family feeling, say top officials of the Presidential Inaugural
Committee.
   The free events _ plus inflation, 11 inaugural balls and the
usual galas and glitz _ are driving Bush inaugural costs to the $25
million range. By comparison, President Reagan's 1981 and 1985
inaugurals cost $15.5 million and $20 million, respectively.
   Most of the money is raised privately and all of it is being
tightly monitored, according to those who hold the purse strings at
Bush inaugural headquarters.
   ``We are extremely cost-conscious,'' said Stephen Studdert,
executive director of the inaugural committee. ``We try and bid
everything that can be bid. We try to get the best bang for the
buck. The dollars are not being spent for gold and glitter. They are
being spent on substantive things.''
   Bush himself said Thursday that he is ``not entirely''
comfortable with the cost of his inauguration. But he added that ``I
have no apologies for the way we're doing it at all'' because the
country deserves a celebration every four years.
   Asked at an inaugural news briefing whether the $25 million
wouldn't be better spent on the homeless, Stephen M. Studdert,
executive director of the inaugural committee, said the inauguration
represented the strength and continuity of American democracy and
the peaceful transfer of power and was ``worthy of celebration.''
   The inaugural committee raised $20 million in interest-free loans
from 200 corporations who advanced $100,000 each. The money will be
repaid from various sources, most of it from the yet-undetermined
take from ticket sales.
   Other anticipated revenues include about $1.5 million from sale
of commemorative items, some $2 million from sale of tickets and
advertising time associated with a televised Kennedy Center gala,
and an estimated $2 million in in-kind contributions and corporate
and individual sponsorships.
   Asked about the appearance of corporations trying to curry favor
with the new administration, Studdert said, ``The transition team
has no idea who has supported the inauguration.''
   The committee does not have to disclose its finances. However, it
has decided to publish a list of corporate lenders, in-kind
contributors, and corporations and individuals underwriting
particular aspects of the inauguration. Reminded of this, Studdert
replied, ``We're not distributing copies of it specifically to
presidential personnel or anything.''
   Even with millions flowing in from sales and contributors,
taxpayers aren't entirely off the hook.
   First, there's the creamy pumpkin-colored building the federal
government's General Services Administration turned over to
inaugural committee for its headquarters. Set in the middle of a
navy yard in an industrial section of Washington, the building had
been used to store machine guns. It has been converted with a
combination of inaugural committee and GSA funds, Studdert said.
   Other parts of the inauguration also are being paid by taxpayers.
For example, Congress appropriated $750,000 to the Joint
Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies to take care of the
actual swearing-in ceremony and a luncheon to follow.
   Congress also earmarked $2.5 million as the operating budget for
the Armed Forces Inaugural Committee, which currently counts 1,294
people at its headquarters and expects to swell to 1,500 at the
inaugural peak.
   The military also expects to contribute 8,500 people during
inaugural week to march in the parade, drive dignitaries to
inaugural-related events and serve in other capacities.
   Congress tried to stem the government cost of such services last
year by directing the Pentagon to seek reimbursement for all
personnel participation in non-public events, but the provision is
not legally binding and is unlikely to have dramatic impact this
time around.

<HEAD>City Schools: What Does It Take To Reform Them?</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By LEE MITGANG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A hint of revolution is in the air in at least
some big-city school systems: an apparent readiness, at long last,
to stop bickering and start reforming.
   The nation's largest system, New York City, continues to generate
shocking headlines about violence, drugs and widespread neighborhood
school board corruption. Within the last month, an elementary school
principal and three teachers were picked up on drug charges. And
last week, a kindergartner was found with a .25-caliber pistol.
   But the picture has begun to brighten elsewhere.
   In Pittsburgh, Dade County, Fla., and Rochester, N.Y., teacher
unions and school administrators have beaten their swords into
reform-minded contracts that boost teacher pay and power while
making them directly accountable for their students' performance.
   In Detroit, where the dropout rate is at least 40 percent, fed up
voters elected a reform school board slate in November. They also
refused to approve new school taxes and bonds aimed at paying off an
estimated $158 million deficit.
   There are even hopeful signs in Chicago's schools, branded 14
months ago as the nation's worst by U.S. Secretary of Education
William J. Bennett. Illinois Gov. James Thompson signed legislation
last month scrapping Chicago's central school board next July, to be
replaced by parent-run councils empowered to set budgets and hire
and fire principals.
   That hardly means such cities have solved their school problems,
officials are quick to admit.
   Chicago's new governing structure may lead to unprecedented
parent power, but the basic problems still fester: a 45 percent
dropout rate and below-average standardized test scores.
   As Rochester teacher union leader Adam Urbanski put it: ``We have
set the table; we have not served the meal yet.''
   Hopeful signs are scarce in the 960,000-student New York City
system.
   It's true that New York's state legislature recently passed
long-sought bills clearing the way for desperately needed school
construction and making new rules to curb school board patronage.
   But Schools Chancellor Richard Green, whose much-heralded arrival
as an outsider from Minneapolis last March raised hopes for new
approaches, has instead found himself tangled in investigations of
local school board corruption.
   To some, New York remains a system adrift.
   ``At this point, there are a lot of people putting out ideas, and
a lot of people wringing their hands. We have to have the
administration put out a specific plan so that people can get behind
it,'' said Robin Willner, deputy executive director of Interface, a
watchdog group that issues frequent reports on city school issues.
   All of which raises the question: What does it take to put the
nation's largest school systems on the road to reform?
   Relative size and the power of the purse are certainly key
factors, says Samuel L. Husk, executive director of the Council of
Great City Schools. Pittsburgh, for example, has only 40,000
students, and its school board has taxing authority.
   New York City has 25 times more students, and its school board
has no authority to tax. Its size and tangled politics foster a
feeling of hopelessness. Some now openly wonder how many
drug-addicted principals and teachers it will take to finally jolt
the system.
   ``I think that you need a catalyst. I hate to say it has to be
horrible. Unfortunately in a school system this size, it may have to
be,'' said Willner.
   New Orleans' 80,000-student public schools have an additional
disadvantage: they must compete with a popular, 35,000-student
parochial school system that siphons off political support.
   But all cities have obstacles to overcome. Whether they succeed
in reform, or even attempt it, usually depends on someone in
authority willing to lead the charge.
   ``You need leadership at the top. Those at the top and those in
the private sector have to see it as an absolute emergency. It's a
political problem,'' said Ernest L. Boyer, a national spokesman for
reform and president of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement
of Teaching, which has produced several reports on urban school
problems.
   In Rochester and Pittsburgh, new superintendents have made a
difference.
   Rochester's Peter McWalters, named in 1986, signaled willingness
to form a working partnership with teachers. Under a contract that
took effect this year, each teacher is directly responsible for 20
students, holding daily meetings and home visits where necessary. In
return, top teacher salaries will rise to $70,000 and school-based
planning teams consisting of teachers, parents, students and
principals will set goals for each school.
   ``When McWalters came in, he shared my sense of urgency, and he
was devoid of the baggage and inhibitions that management often
has,'' said Urbanski. ``His passion proved infectious. After our
collective bargaining agreement, we had left little choice for the
political and business structure but to follow suit to help us make
it work.''
   Pittsburgh's superintendent, Richard C. Wallace, who arrived in
1980 as an outsider to a city enmeshed in a bitter dispute over
school desegregation, helped move the school system beyond that
dispute and establish it as a national model of reform. He promptly
began biweekly meetings with the teacher union, established a center
to enhance teacher skills, and attracted millions in corporate funds
to support innovative programs.
   Likewise in Miami's Dade County, the teacher union and
superintendent have stopped fighting and started cooperating to
devise a reform plan.
   But the key factor was leadership, said Husk. ``The thing to
remember is Florida had an education governor, Bob Graham, and he
made a substantial investment in schools long before other states
were even thinking about reform.''
   Some feel New York is still waiting for such leadership.
   ``We don't have any one elective official who has made education
their primary issue,'' said Willner. ``In terms of using the bully
pulpit, having an education mayor or governor, that hasn't happened
in New York.''
   In New Orleans, meanwhile, the bad times keep rolling for a
school system perennially starved of leadership and tax dollars.
Still, many are encouraged by the election last year of Louisiana's
reform-minded governor, Buddy Roemer, a property tax increase last
April, and a new, expanded school board.
   That may not be enough. A state report showed that 370 of New
Orleans' 4,800-teacher staff were either uncertified or had
temporary certificates, and despite recent increases, salaries still
average just $26,800, about $2,000 below the national average.
   ``The New Orleans public schools remain a factory for the
expansion of the underclass,'' said Lee Gary, a private education
consultant.
   Boyer sees four elements necessary to move big systems toward
reform: clearly stated goals, smaller schools structured so that
students no longer feel anonymous, more school-based authority where
officials are regularly accountable for results, and above all,
partnerships between parents, civic, corporate and educational
officials.
   ``If you pull these reform efforts apart, these cities are making
progress on governance, and partnerships,'' said Boyer. ``What I
don't see is much attention to school climate, student alienation,
and the question of educational goals and outcomes.''

   In seven years investigating crimes against
children, the Idaho detective had never seen anything like the
emaciated, battered boy found whimpering in a freeway rest stop.
   ``Overall, it was the worst case of abuse, and circumstances
surrounding abuse, that I have ever seen,'' said the detective, Rita
Rowe. ``He was, and I want to choose the word carefully, pitiful.''
   Rowe was on duty at the Ada County sheriff's office in Boise on
Jan. 4 when the child, pocked with cigarette burns and clad only in
a T-shirt, was brought in by a deputy.
   For three days, Rowe and others tried to put a history to the
mute boy they called Johnny Doe. Then a Utah mother called Idaho
authorities when her 5-year-old son recognized the abandoned child
on a TV newscast as a former neighbor, Eddy Tuinman, age 7.
   Hours later, Eddy's parents were arrested in central Utah on
charges of felony child abandonment. Suburban Salt Lake City police
had been looking for the couple on a charge that they illegally
tapped into a natural gas line at their rented home.
   Deborah Tuinman, 28, told investigators she awoke from a nap in
the family car to find Eddy gone. Her husband, Edward Donald
Tuinman, a 29-year-old itinerant mechanic, claimed to have left the
boy with social services workers in Boise, she said.
   By week's end, the couple had waived extradition, and they are
expected to be returned to Idaho by Jan. 23. After four days in a
hospital, Eddy was placed in foster care and three other Tuinman
children were in protective custody.
   When Eddy was brought in, Rowe gave him a teddy bear as he
cowered in blankets on the floor, flinching at sudden movements and
so weakened by hunger he could neither sit nor stand unaided.
   ``He touched it and rubbed it and felt the fur,'' she said. ``He
had kind of a surprised look on his face. His reaction was that of a
child who'd never played with a toy before.''
   But when Rowe tried to help the boy to a bathroom, he panicked
and clung to her, making inarticulate sounds of disapproval. Later
investigation showed the child may have been locked alone in
bathrooms for hours with only water from the toilet to drink.
   Equally appalled was Laurie Gillis, a victim-witness coordinator
for the county prosecutor and, for several hours, Eddy's anchor.
   Gillis sang to the boy as she held him ``and he would just close
his eyes and almost go to sleep,'' Rowe said. ``That was the only
thing he asked for was love. Not food, not anything except the good
touches.''
   At St. Luke's Regional Medical Center, Eddy refused to let go of
Gillis and the doctor had to examine him in her lap. He found the
child weighed 44 pounds, showed evidence of healed-over fractures
and was mentally retarded, although further tests were needed to
determine how retarded.
   When he was placed with foster parents Jan. 8, Eddy could laugh
and seemed to comprehend much of what was said to him, said hospital
spokeswoman Rita Ryan. His temporary parents have experience with
handicapped children.
   But as more is learned about Eddy, little is known about his
parents. It is known they lived in the Salt Lake City area for
several years and in Washington state the last three months of 1988.
   Investigators believe Eddy was abandoned as the family traveled
through Idaho on its way to Arizona, where Tuinman, who has a
history of petty offenses, was going for work.
   The family included an 11-year-old girl and two other boys, one 6
years old and the other about 1. While in Washington, they had lived
in a ramshackle cabin in Buena, about 10 miles south of Yakima.
   Cabin owner Ralph Conners said the Tuinmans left Jan. 3, the day
before a motorist found Eddy at the Interstate 84 rest stop
southeast of Boise.
   He said the Tuinmans got by on a monthly welfare check of about
$800, borrowing food and wood from neighbors when the money ran out.
He said he witnessed no abuse of the children.
   But Detective Patti Smalley in Sandy, the Salt Lake City suburb
where the Tuinmans faced the theft charges that were dismissed to
speed their extradition, is convinced Eddy suffered long-term
physical abuse.
   She speculates Eddy took the brunt of punishment in the family,
because the other children were not surprised at his condition.
   ``To them, abuse isn't abuse,'' Smalley said. ``To them, it's
just been normal.''

   The shortest job interview hotel manager
Robert Fredy ever conducted took place at a New York City
intersection as he waited at a light.
   Something in Stephen Pearman's voice moved Fredy one cold day
last February. Pearman had approached Fredy's car to wash his
windshield, and, like many motorists who try to fend off the usually
insistent beggars, Fredy flipped on the wipers to indicate he wasn't
interested.
   Pearman leaned into the window.
   ``Come on, mister, give me a break. I need a job,'' he said.
   In the seconds before traffic started moving again, Fredy,
general manager of the Berkeley-Carteret Hotel here, handed Pearman
a business card and told him to call if he was serious.
   Two days later, the 30-year-old windshield washer appeared in the
lobby of the fancy hotel in this old seaside resort. In the past
year, he has become a valued member of the hotel staff, found an
apartment and got married.
   ``I've gotten a second chance and took advantage of it,'' Pearman
said with a grin as he sat recently in the hotel's restaurant,
eating an omelette on the house.
   ``You know, I could have just come here a while, eaten up and
left,'' he said. ``But there ain't no future in washing windows.''
   Fredy paid for Pearman's bus ticket from New York to Asbury Park
and put him up in a motel. He fed him three meals a day and loaned
him pocket money while training him to be a banquet houseman.
   Pearman now works full time, setting up the hotel's banquet rooms
for conventions and business meetings. Neither man would say how
much Pearman is paid, but he said he is saving up for a car.
   Fredy acknowledged that there is a shortage of labor for such
blue-collar jobs, but said, ``I didn't hire him for that reason.
This was purely impulsive. A lot of people hate to get involved. New
Yorkers tend to look the other way and say, `That's not my problem.'
   ``But being with the public all the time, I have a good sense of
what people are all about,'' he said. ``It gives me good judgment
about people.''
   Fredy was not proved wrong about Pearman, who took his job
seriously and repaid Fredy for his first loans. Pearman often works
12 to 14 hours a day, Fredy said.
   ``He was willing to work hard and listen,'' the manager said. ``I
never had any problem whatsoever.''
   The past year has been a happy one for Pearman, who quickly
gained 60 pounds ``always has a smile on his face,'' Fredy said.
During the summer, Pearman learned to love the beach. In November,
he was named employee of the month. In December, he married Helena
White, an 18-year-old housekeeper at the hotel. Fredy gave them a
champagne reception and the bridal suite.
   Ironically, it was Pearman who had doubts about Fredy's sincerity.
   ``My friends told me he was just pulling my leg when he handed me
the card,'' Pearman said. ``But I said, `No, he's a businessman. I
need to give it a shot. If there's a chance, I should take it.' ''
   Pearman previously drove taxis, limousines and trucks for several
years, and even took some college business courses.
   ``But it got pretty hectic trying to reach a quota all the
time,'' he said of his driving jobs. ``And all the hustle and bustle
of New York _ it was so tiring.
   ``It got to the point where I was out of work for a few months,
and I took up washing windshields'' to pay for food and a room at a
boarding house, he said.
   Fredy acknowledged that ordinarily he is wary of New York's
street people.
   ``I figure they use the money to get drunk,'' he said. ``But
Stephen seemed so honest and open, asking for an opportunity rather
than just money. I don't hand my business card to just anybody.''
   With Fredy's permission, Pearman invited a fellow windshield
washer to try out for a job at the hotel, ``and it didn't work,''
Pearman said. ``He didn't want to be tied down.''
   Pearman has since returned to New York several times to hand out
$5 bills and sweatshirts to his old street buddies. ``They didn't
believe it was me,'' he said.

   Many Japanese sense a new era with the death of
Emperor Hirohito, whose reign spanned depression, militarism,
defeat, hardship and riches, and believe his son Akihito may open up
the imperial system.
   While mourning the 87-year-old emperor, they were relieved to see
an end to the six turbulent decades of Hirohito's Showa era and the
smooth transition to Heisei, or ``achieving peace,'' the name given
Emperor Akihito's reign.
   Some stores turned off advertising signs for two days after
Hirohito died Jan. 7, but Japan had been prepared by his long
illness and it was business as usual for most people, a turning
point rather than a traumatic loss.
   Until Hirohito renounced his divinity after World War II,
emperors were regarded as living gods. Polls in recent years
indicated a small minority of Japanese still considered him one.
   Akihito is seen as an ordinary person, which some welcome and
others regret.
   ``Hirohito represented the darker side of Japanese history,''
said Gregory Clark, professor of Japanese studies at Sophia
University in Tokyo.
   ``With the appearance of a new emperor, there's a fresh start
going on. You can see it particularly in the stock market, and I
think it will spread to other areas.''
   In the first three trading days after the emperor died, the main
index of the Tokyo Stock Exchange gained 933.91 points, or 3.1
percent.
   ``He wasn't a god, but he was somehow different from ordinary
people,'' said Hiroko Gotoh, 22. ``I don't think I've changed inside
because of his death, but I have a feeling an era has changed in
Japan.''
   Fears were expressed that rightists would use Hirohito's death to
increase imperial power. Akihito quickly indicated, however, that he
would be closer to the people and perhaps let more light through the
``chrysanthemum curtain'' surrounding the imperial family, which
uses the flower as its symbol.
   In his first public statement, the new emperor wore a plain
Western morning suit and spoke in straightforward language instead
of the classic Chinese-style ``chokugo'' his father used on the same
occasion in 1926. The speech and some other transition rites,
private in the past, were televised.
   Akihito, 55, said he would try to ``constantly be at one with the
people'' and would join with them ``to preserve the constitution of
Japan.''
   That was widely interpreted as a message to those in the
governing Liberal Democratic Party and elsewhere who have called for
change in the document imposed by the United States after the
Japanese surrender, which renounces war and gives the emperor no
real political power.
   ``It was quite significant that he said he would protect the
constitution,'' Clark said. ``Normally a Japanese monarch would not
take such a political position.''
   As the first emperor who never was considered divine, Akihito
will have an opportunity to shape the imperial institution's future
and define its place in society.
   Cabinet decisions on the transition raised questions about the
government's attitude toward the imperial system, which past
officials used to foster a sense of Japanese racial and cultural
uniqueness and to rally support for the invasion of much of Asia.
   Opposition parties criticized the government decision to sponsor
portions of Hirohito's funeral, scheduled Feb. 24, and two other
transition rites linked to the Shinto religion. They said
sponsorship might violate constitutional separation of religion and
state.
   Several families who protested government-mandated school
memorials to Hirohito by keeping their children home reported
receiving death threats.
   The Shinto origin of the rites illustrates the close ties between
the former state religion, based in nature, and the emperor, who is
declared by myth to be a direct descendant of the sun goddess.
   Polls indicate most Japanese support the current imperial system,
which defines the emperor as the ``symbol of the state and the unity
of the people,'' but not head of state.
   People who want to restore imperial divinity and increase the
monarch's role as spiritual leader find themselves with a new
emperor who ``will never become a living god because he is too
human,'' said Kenichiro Sembon, senior editor of Asahi Journal, a
leading liberal news weekly.
   ``Why should such an ordinary person become an emperor?'' he
said. ``Now is a good time for us to start thinking about that, and
about all aspects of the imperial system, including whether we need
the system at all.''
   Clark commented: ``I wonder whether the ultra-nationalists will
be able to maintain their interest in a pacifist emperor.''
   Groups on both the left and right identify the imperial system
with militarism and nationalism.
   ``What I fear is that an emperor without Hirohito's popularity
might cause the imperial system to become more remote from the
people, and rightists might use force to try to bring the system
back into prominence,'' a senior politician of the governing party
said privately.
   Akihito's conduct before becoming emperor already has inched open
the doors of the secretive Imperial Household Agency, which oversees
royal affairs.
   His father was tutored by war heroes chosen by court
chamberlains. Akihito studied with ordinary students and was tutored
by American pacifist Elizabeth Gray Vining, who is said to have
given him a sense of the equality of all people.
   He is the first Japanese monarch to select his own wife, and
chose a commoner with a Western-style education. Akihito and Empress
Michiko raised their three children themselves, ending the imperial
practice of separating children from parents.
   News accounts said Akihito and Michiko frequently have been at
odds with the Imperial Household Agency.
   ``Reforming the Imperial Household Agency is the most serious
problem facing the new emperor,'' said Takeshi Maezawa, ombudsman of
the conservative Yomiuri, Japan's largest newspaper. ``Japan won't
be able to move fully into the 21st century under the agency's
current situation.''

   Emperor Akihito will get a tax-free annual salary
equivalent to $2 million, the same as his father, and another $20
million for court expenses, a Finance Ministry official said.
   He said the government will make a special payment to the royal
family of $21 million to cover expenses for the funeral of Akihito's
father, Emperor Hirohito, who died Jan. 7 and will be buried Feb. 24.
   The government has decided to spend $74 million on the funeral,
including the payment to the imperial family.
   Akihito's salary must cover the living expenses of a six-member
family, including his mother, the Dowager Empress Nagako, while
Hirohito's was used only for himself and his wife, an Imperial
Household Agency official said.
   Fifteen other members of the royal family receive a total of $1.7
million annually, the agency official said.
   The Imperial Household Agency, which oversees the imperial
family's activities, receives $66 million a year for the salaries of
its 1,130 employees and maintenance of imperial properties.
   More than 9{ square miles of land, one of Japan's scarcest
commodities, are occupied by the royal family _ including the
palace, which covers about half a square mile in Tokyo, and a summer
residence on nearly five square miles of land in northern Japan.
   Until World War II, the imperial family was the nation's
wealthiest, but officials said all its land was transferred to the
government after World War II. They said U.S. occupation forces
allowed the family to retain some assets, including securities.

<TEXT>
   The gathering of 149 nations to condemn chemical
weapons showed, if nothing else, how the world order of a short time
back has been stood on its head.
   The old divisions so familiar to world affairs _ East-West,
North-South, First World-Third World _ have given way to a baffling
new array of converging interests.
   Diplomats seasoned by the Cold War and the anti-colonial winds of
change watched the five-day meeting in amazement.
   The Soviets, clear winners in the charm category, tweaked the
Americans for a lack of openness. The Americans aimed their ire at a
friendly foe, West Germany.
   Western allies fought openly over which of their companies sold
chemicals to Iraq, Libya and Syria, all regarded as past or
potential users of poison gas.
   Romania bolted its bloc, taking a position directly opposed to
the Kremlin's. A Soviet official merely smiled philosophically as he
explained that the Romanians refused to follow orders.
   While chief Soviet delegate Viktor Karpov beamed benignly at the
cameras, U.S. correspondents aimed barbs at his American
counterpart. Retired Gen. William Burns, head of the U.S. arms
control agency, admitted not knowing about new chemical warheads
included in the U.S. budget made public, by coincidence, during the
conference.
   Iran, whose representatives spoke eloquent English, stood firm
with the industrial West against Middle Eastern states one U.S.
delegate described privately as ``the whackos.''
   Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati echoed points made by the
United States, the ``Great Satan,'' demanding in measured terms even
more sanctions and condemnation of past acts than the Americans
wanted.
   Although nations of the so-called non-aligned movement expressed
token solidarity with the Arab League, hard-line Arabs had to back
off linking bans on chemical and nuclear weapons for lack of real
support.
   ``We're not buying that Arab League garbage,'' a Central American
delegate said in private. ``You can't talk about a Third World and
mean anything.''
   Black Africans walked out again on R.F. Botha, the South African
foreign minister, but this time Botha tossed away his speech and
dramatically challenged them to admit in public their secret
friendship with his country.
   Botha spoke of vaccines, health care, research and other aid his
country provided, and asserted: ``My African brothers know this.''
   He noted that agreements finally had been reached on independence
for Namibia and South African withdrawal from Angola. Black Africans
did not walk when those matters were settled, he said.
   ``We say no to hypoprisy,'' commented Foreign Minister Simeon Ake
of Ivory Coast, the only black African to keep his seat. ``At least
it gave Botha a chance to reveal his contacts.''
   Under the ironies were signs of a world turning faster than many
of its statesmen can measure.
   William Waldegrave, junior minister in Britain's Foreign Office,
shrugged off the old distinctions in a chat with reporters: ``I am
always confused over who is supposed to be First World or Third
World when you start talking about rich Middle Eastern states.''
   Most political analysts interviewed said the 109 speeches and
secret negotiations showed old-style international dealings are
poorly suited to a modern world.
   Countries condemned for spraying nerve gas on civilian
populations directed the same rhetoric at chemical weapons as the
those attacked.
   Everyone knew up to 30 nations at the meeting had chemical
weapons but only the United States and the Soviet Union admitted
having them. France, the host and arbiter of the moral tone, denied
it firmly, despite the intelligence of its allies to the contrary.
   ``The problem,'' one Western analyst put it, ``is that you can't
really say what you think: that there are responsible leaders and
maniacs, and no international convention can differentiate among
them.''
   Several American delegates acknowledged that, despite the general
tone and circuitous phrasing, their underlying concerns were
specific:
   _Iraq had used poison gas to turn the tide of war against Iran
and to terrorize its own Kurdish minority. Some other states seemed
impressed by their success.
   _Syria had chemical warheads on Scud missiles directed at Israel,
each capable of delivering deadly gas over a radius of a thousand
yards.
   _Libya, helped by private West German companies among others, was
completing a chemical weapons plant that could deliver toxic
chemical agents to a broad range of terrorists.
   The Americans' concurrent goal, to focus attention on a new
threat from Libyan leader Moammer Gadhafi, backfired by uniting the
Arab League. A night of compromises produced a declaration with no
mention of sanctions, export controls or verification.
   Lessons of the conference extended well beyond the subject at
hand. Mainly, the old cliches and timeworn roles were falling away.
   At one point, a U.S. press officer introduced an American
reporter to an arms negotiator who answered a broad range of
questions, with hardly a pause to consider the implications of his
remarks.
   Unlike most Americans at the meeting, the man was perfectly
willing to be quoted. He was a Russian.
   Later, an American negotiator agreed with a point his Soviet
rival had made, that the conference declaration was a political
document with little specific or technical value.
   ``That's what we would say, if we could,'' he said, but explained
that statements had to be cleared in Washington and some subjects
were extremely sensitive. Then he added:
   ``But don't quote me.''

   Maotai, China's fiery brew with a kick that would
make a moonshiner smile, has become an ``all-purpose grease'' for
bribing bureaucrats and cajoling cadres, a newspaper says.
   The China Youth News also blames profiteering by government
officials for maotai's high price and criticized China's tradition
of ``special privileges'' for creating conditions that allow the
problem to flourish.
   ``In this society even the most righteous of gentlemen's
agreements can be turned into the most vulgar of schemes,'' said the
article Sunday.
   The article was significant in that it showed the extent to which
corruption has entered the life of the average Chinese. It also
tacitly acknowledged that price rises instituted over the summer for
13 name brand liquors had failed to break a black market
stranglehold on the goods.
   Just about every major moment in a person's life in China
requires a bribe of good booze, the story said.
   ``Entering nursery school, starting grade school, changing
schools, beginning a career, changing jobs, getting a license,
helping a loved one to the hospital, even sending a corpse to the
crematorium could all use a few `grenades' of good liquor,'' the
story said.
   A cartoon of a soldier holding two ``grenades'' of maotai as he
prepared an assault on a government building accompanied the article.
   ``If you have liquor, even in a difficult situation, problems are
solved as the bottles are handed over and glasses raised in a
toast,'' it said. ``If you don't, there are many things you will
never accomplish. Good liquor indeed has become society's
all-purpose grease.''
   The best ``grease'' of all, the article said, is maotai, a clear
liquor made from rice with a taste resembling airplane fuel. Youth
News estimated that 90 percent of the maotai purchased in China was
not consumed by the buyer.
   ``The people are using maotai, they are not drinking it,'' it
said.
   In July, China freed the price of maotai and 12 other brand name
liquors in an attempt to break a stranglehold that the black market
had on the products. By making the state price equal to the black
market price, China hoped to put the profiteers out of business.
   A fixth of Maotai shot up from $5.40 to $81, but still the
profiteers haven't disappeared, Sunday's article said.
   ``These prices are enough to frighten the people, but distillers
and liquor sellers aren't afraid,'' it said.
   The reason is that because maotai and other good spirits are
still scarce, only officials with special powers can buy them.
   The article said officials never would use their own money to buy
the goods but would dip into the public till.
   It cited statistics that in some counties, government officials
spend 50 percent of their budget on eating and drinking.
   ``Some officials buy a case of liquor and put it to use,'' the
article said, ``but others buy a case and immediately sell it to
make money ... Money that is created through connections and power.''
   Some officials, the report said, have taken to making bogus brand
name liquor, again in a ploy to capitalize on the expensive spirits.
   In one county in Shanxi, 60 percent of the 118 distilleries
manufacture fake brand name booze. According to incomplete
statistics for 1988, more than 20 million bottles of bogus liquor
have been seized.
   ``Fake brand name liquor is becoming so commonplace that liquor
sellers are getting nervous, liquor buyers are getting nervous, even
brown noses who buy liquor to curry favor are getting nervous,'' it
said.
   The article called on the government to enforce a regulation
issued in October forbidding officials from using public money to
buy liquor.
   But its tone was pessimistic.
   ``This problem is rooted in the ghost of the past,'' it said.
``Special privileges, dependence relations and a stratified society
_ their power in China is still very strong.''

   A boulder tumbled down a hillside during a
mudslide and crushed a car on a coastal mountain road Sunday,
killing a woman and trapping a 6-year-old girl in the wreckage for
nearly seven hours.
   The girl was freed shortly before 8 p.m. and was hospitalized in
stable condition with a broken leg, sheriff's department and
hospital officials said. During her ordeal, she was comforted by her
27-year-old father, who was freed from the wreckage earlier in the
day and was not seriously injured, rescue workers said.
   The slide occurred about 1 p.m. 22 miles east of Coos Bay along
the South Fork of the Coos River on a gravel road owned by
Weyerhaeuser Co., authorities said. The slide occurred 9{ miles east
of the company's Dellwood logging terminal.
   The boulder, about 25 feet in diameter, landed directly on top of
the car, said Coast Guard Lt. Bruce Grinnell, who was part of a
helicopter crew that went to the scene of the slide.
   ``There was a bumper sticking out each end of this rock,''
Grinnell said. ``It's amazing anybody survived it.''
   Other rescuers said the girl was trapped in the front seat of a
1955 Chevrolet, a big, boxy car that was one of Detroit's most
durable models.
   ``The little girl was conscious and she was talking to
(rescuers),'' Grinnell said. ``Her only quote was, `It hurts all
over.'''
   Witnesses said the slide was about 80 feet wide and nearly
completely covered the roadway.
   Weyerhaeser Co. officials said there was a report of a smaller
slide on the road about 11 a.m., and a worker was sent to check. The
second, larger slide apparently occurred moments before the worker
arrived.
   The worker found the car crushed by the boulder, heard people
yelling for help and notified authorities by radio, the company said.

   Interior Secretary Donald P. Hodel is leaving
Washington convinced that leaders of environmental organizations are
much too partisan and out of touch with their members.
   Hodel also said in a farewell interview that he believes the
global warming called the ``greenhouse effect'' has been overblown,
and the cost of cleaning up the nation's nuclear weapons plants has
been overstated.
   Hodel said he was ``delighted and astounded'' that the losing
Democratic campaign of Michael Dukakis argued, in Hodel's words,
that ``you don't have to choose between an improving environment and
an adequate energy and minerals supply; you can do both'' _ his own
position.
   The environmentalists who attacked President Reagan's first
interior secretary, James Watt, whom Hodel served as deputy, were
``the anti-can-do-both'' people, Hodel said.
   Hodel often has been called a smoother version of Watt, following
the same policies but without the rancor. Asked if he were a ``Watt
policy clone,'' he replied, ``I hope so, because we worked for the
same man,'' Ronald Reagan.
   Watt's critics ``were the people who said we had to choose
between improving our environment and the lifestyle of the American
people. They were the ones who had foisted the idea off on the
Carter administration that we were going to have to live with less,
that there was a malaise in the country, that the United States'
glory days were behind us.''
   Hodel said many leaders of environmental organizations ``made a
horrible mistake'' when they endorsed Carter for re-election in a
White House Rose Garden ceremony in 1980.
   ``I think if their membership understood how blatantly partisan
the paid leadership was, the membership would demand that something
be done,'' Hodel said.
   Few environmental leaders made an endorsement in the
just-concluded campaign, though some attacked the record of the
Reagan administration and George Bush.
   The leaders are ``single-issue people,'' Hodel said, but ``the
bulk of the membership really does believe we can do both. They are
responsible, dedicated supporters of wildlife, clean air, clean
water and the environment.''
   Hodel's complaint was scoffed at by two environmental
organizations.
   ``When I joined the Wilderness Society in January 1981, the same
month the Reagan administration took office, we had 40,000 members.
We now have 240,000,'' said former Sen. Gaylord Nelson, D-Wis., the
society's counselor.
   ``Every single environmental organization in the United States
has significantly increased its membership,'' Nelson said.
   Dave Baker, political director of Friends of the Earth, said,
``Our membership votes with their dollars. ... I think our
membership does believe you can do both (enhance the economy and
protect the environment), but I don't think Don Hodel and the
administration have done much to promote that.''
   Hodel, however, insisted that self-styled public interest groups
have been taken over by ``single-issue politicians.''
   He said that in the early 1980s it was clear that the impending
release of much natural gas from price controls would mean falling
prices because demand had fallen below production.
   ``The consumer lobby continued to insist that price controls were
necessary to `protect the consumer.' And I don't think it had
anything to do with `protecting the consumer.' It has to do with a
regulatory frame of mind that these people have, which is: They want
the government, which they as single-interest politicians can
influence, in control of the market because then they can skew it
for their purposes when they need to.''
   Some gas was decontrolled and prices did fall. The Reagan
administration has not succeeded in persuading Congress to free the
remaining 40 percent of gas still under controls.
   Hodel said he believes that nuclear waste cleanup costs faced by
the Energy Department probably have been overstated.
   ``When you hear $360 billion estimates or whatever the number is,
that includes cleanup way beyond what is necessary for health and
safety,'' he said.
   The Energy Department has estimated it needs $81 billion through
2010 for cleanup and modernization.
   Hodel also discounts the worst-case scenarios offered for the
greenhouse effect.
   He said he thinks that ``the global warming is primarily
occurring because of long-range global or universal or
solar-system-wide effects, and we will find that the human input
definitely has an effect, but that is not nearly so great'' as the
initial estimates.
   Many scientists argue that the global warming produced by carbon
dioxide results mainly from the burning of fossil fuels. They say it
has increased average temperatures by nearly one degree Fahrenheit
over the past century and is likely to increase temperatures three
to eight degrees by sometime in the middle of the next century,
raising sea levels, increasing droughts and shifting crop production
zones.

in the biggest effort yet to find remains of fallen airmen and send
them on a final, peaceful journey home.
   Some families, an unspecified but apparently small number, have
been told five teams are investigating and excavating sites where
relatives are believed to have crashed during air strikes between
1964 and 1972. This is the fourth joint operation since October.
   ``Due to privacy considerations of the affected families we
cannot discuss the specifics,'' a statement from the U.S. delegation
said. ``However, those families have been notified of the
investigation and will be fully advised of the results.''
   The two dozen U.S. specialists will be in Vietnam until Jan. 23
and will leave with 25 sets of remains that are being prepared for
repatriation and identification at the U.S. Army laboratory in
Hawaii.
   Previously, Vietnam had allowed only four U.S. teams in at a
time. It has repatriated 63 sets of remains in the past month.
   ``The U.S. government is pleased that Vietnam has agreed to
expand the ongoing effort from four to five teams,'' the American
delegation said. ``The U.S. government appreciates the initiative
taken by Vietnam to repatriate these remains and hopes to continue
the increasing joint cooperation to resolve the long-standing
humanitarian issue.''
   Nguyen Can, acting director of Vietnam's office for MIAs, those
missing in action during the long war that ended in 1975, agreed
that cooperation has been good and the issue is humanitarian rather
than political.
   ``We don't want to use this as any kind of leverage because we
understand the feelings of the American families whose loved ones
did not come home after the war,'' he said. ``We have our own MIAs,
more than the United States.''
   Can put the figure at 300,000.
   ``We want to solve this question and let bygones be bygones'' he
said. ``What's the good of keeping this alive? It would only let the
spiritual wounds of war bleed, and that would not be helpful to any
understanding between the two people.''
   Both governments have sought in public pronouncements to separate
the human side of the war from politics, but the MIA issue figures
into the process of establishing the diplomatic relations Vietnam
seeks.
   Washington has said all Vietnamese troops must be removed from
Cambodia before it will consider an exchange of ambassadors,
economic aid and lifting the U.S. trade embargo.
   Hanoi has said it will meet the requirement by the end of next
year, perhaps sooner. Vietnam invaded Cambodia in December 1978,
overthrowing the murderous Khmer Rouge regime of Pol Pot, and has
occupied the neighboring country since.
   The United States also has sent word to Vietnam that its
cooperation in returning remains would be regarded favorably. In the
past, Vietnam slowed the search when it was angered by critical U.S.
statements.
   Can said some ``bad elements'' in southern Vietnam were
``trafficking in remains'' by hiring people to dig in Vietnamese
graves, steal the remains and try to pass them off as American.
   He said those Vietnamese mistakenly believed American remains
would get them entry visas to the United States or some other reward.
   U.S. policy ``is to accept POW-MIA information from any source,''
the American delegation said, but ``we do not view paying for
remains as helpful to promoting government-to-government cooperation
on accounting.''
   ``Paying for remains would encourage scavenger activities at
crash sites by persons lacking the technical recovery knowledge,
thus enormously complicating the U.S. government's ability to
recover remains,'' the Americans said.
   ``Similarly, the U.S. government does not provide refugee
resettlement as a reward for cooperation.''
   Fewer than 10 percent of the remains of Americans listed as
missing in Indochina have been recovered since U.S. forces were
withdrawn from Vietnam in early 1973.
   Vietnam has returned the remains of 172 Americans identified by
the Army laboratory. Another 2,383 are missing: 1,747 in Vietnam,
547 in Laos, 83 in Cambodia and six in China.
   U.S. officials acknowledge not all cases will be resolved,
because much time has passed and many airmen were lost in jungle
terrain or at sea.
   The United States ``will continue its efforts to account for all
missing Americans,'' the delegation said.
   ``We still have ongoing efforts to account for Americans missing
from World War II and Korea. This solemn commitment to resolve the
fate of missing Americans and to return all recoverable remains to
their native land will not be abandoned.''

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: No Need to Pass the Hat for Reagan in Retirement</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As President Reagan heads ``back to the ranch''
on George Bush's inauguration day, he will carry with him a passel
of perquisites that presidents receive when they become former
presidents.
   For one thing, he will fly to California on Air Force One, but
that's only a one-shot deal. The plane will be flown back to
Washington without him and after that will be earmarked for the new
president.
   There will be no need, however, to pass the tin cup for Reagan.
Unlike such early presidents as Thomas Jefferson, who had to sell
his books to make ends meet, Reagan will, like other recent ones, be
quite comfortably off.
   He gets two pensions, around-the-clock Secret Service protection,
an office allowance and the use of a townhouse in Washington. In
addition, the government will pay to ship his papers to California,
process them and run his presidential library.
   Reagan already receives a pension of $29,188 a year from the
state of California, because of his eight years as governor.
   Now, with eight years as president under his belt, he will
receive a federal pension equal to the annual salary of a member of
the Cabinet. This is currently $99,500 but will jump to $155,000 if
Congress approves a salary increase Reagan has recommended.
   The Secret Service protection applies to both the president and
his wife, Nancy. Should Reagan die, she would receive lifetime
protection unless she remarried. The Reagans' children will receive
no protection, since they are all adults.
   Former Sen. Lawton Chiles, D-Fla., who waged a campaign to scale
back benefits for former presidents during his Senate career,
estimated the cost of the Secret Service protection at $9.3 million
in 1986. This covered former Presidents Ford and Carter, but not
Nixon, who chose to hire private bodyguards.
   ``I wouldn't be surprised to see that double in the first year
that Reagan is out of office,'' said Robert Coakley, who was Chiles'
staff director and is now on the staff of Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio.
   Coakley said the first year out of office is always the most
expensive because of equipment purchases.
   Also, although Reagan spoke in his final presidential radio
address Saturday of going ``back to the ranch,'' he and Mrs. Reagan
actually plan to live in a fashionable Los Angeles neighborhood and
continue to use their 688-acre ranch north of Santa Barbara as a
vacation home. Protecting both places also will increase the cost.
   Each former president receives an office allowance of up to
$300,000. Reagan already has waiting for him a penthouse suite in a
Los Angeles office building, with offices for himself, Mrs. Reagan,
the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation, the Secret Service and
press aide Mark Weinberg.
   The Washington townhouse, on a side street near the White House,
is reserved for the use of former presidents when they come to town,
although they do not always use it. President Carter, for instance,
stayed in the presidential suite of a hotel about a block away when
he came through town on a recent book promotion tour.
   In 1986, the Senate passed a Chiles bill to limit Secret Service
protection and reduce the office allowances, but it failed to win
approval in the House.
   Chiles did secure enactment of a bill requiring the private
backers who put up the funds to build presidential libraries also to
create an endowment to underwrite the cost of running them. There's
a catch, though. At the insistence of the administration, the bill
exempted the Reagan library, now being built in Simi Valley, Calif.
   In addition to the cost of running the library, National Archives
spokeswoman Jill Brett said an estimated $500,000 is ticketed for
moving Reagan's presidential papers to California and $1.3 million
for renovating and equipping storage room for them in the Archives'
facility at Laguna Niguel and in rented space at Culver City.
   James B. McKinney, director of the White House Military Office,
which oversees transportation, medical and other services for the
president, said those services will be available to the ex-president
for six months, but he will have to pay for them. Weinberg said
Reagan expects to use only ``some limited communications support to
facilitate the transition.''
   Reagans' personal finances are hard to measure, since most of his
assets are in a blind trust. His latest government financial
disclosure form, which discloses assets in broad categories, said
only that the trust is worth more than $250,000. The Reagans bought
their ranch for $526,000 in 1974 and made $127,000 in improvements
to it eight years later. The new home in Los Angeles was purchased
for $2.5 million by California friends from whom the Reagans are
leasing it for a reported $15,000 a month.
   Both of the Reagans plan to write books and make speeches, for
which they are expected to command handsome fees.
   All in all, if Reagan's presidential limousine turns into a
pumpkin at the stroke of noon on Friday, it certainly should be a
prize pumpkin.

   President-elect George Bush said so little
about his view of the world during the campaign it is hard to
predict his foreign policy, but since winning the White House he has
dropped some serious hints.
   These indicate he will slow down negotiations with the Soviet
Union to reduce long-range nuclear weapons while taking a softer
approach on Nicaragua. Also, Bush is not a good bet to push the U.S.
Strategic Defense Initiative very hard.
   If the hints turn into facts, Bush will have diverged
significantly from Ronald Reagan on all three points. Even so, the
change would be one of degree and not a radical shift.
   Bush and his Secretary of State, James A. Baker III, evidently
want time to reflect and to feel their way. They are likely to focus
at the start on cultivating the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
allies and improving relations with Japan, an economic powerhouse
that increasingly appears at cross-purposes with the United States
on trade and fiscal issues.
   Bush has indicated he will continue the recent Reagan
administration policy of firing ``rifle shot'' trade sanctions at
economic allies who discriminate against U.S. goods to ``show our
determination to have fair trade and equal access.''
   Reagan started slowly, too, holding off any serious action on
arms control for 10 months while damning Moscow with traditional
right-wing rhetoric.
   However, Reagan wound up holding five summit meetings with Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and signing a treaty to abolish
intermediate-range nuclear missiles _ those that carry from 300 to
3,000 miles.
   Bush clearly isn't planning to reverse the trend.
   `I am impressed with what Mr. Gorbachev says and I really think
he wants better relations,'' Bush said in a recent television
interview. ``I think he's fully committed to perestroika and
glasnost. And I don't think you can put the genie back into the
bottle once you open it and lighten up a little there.''
   But the resumption of U.S.-Soviet negotiations on a strategic
arms reduction treaty may be postponed for several months. Already,
Bush has said a ``detailed point-by-point program'' cannot be ready
by Feb. 15, the tentative date for negotiators to return to the
table in Geneva.
   Circumstances may force Bush and Baker to move quickly in the
Middle East, however.
   The new Israeli government, still smarting from the Reagan
administration's decision to talk to the Palestine Liberation
Organization, is rushing to complete a comprehensive proposal for a
Middle East settlement.
   Bush, who said the traditionally soothing things about Israel
during the campaign, faces decisions on the Israeli initiative, what
to do about the PLO and whether to support a state for the
Palestinian Arabs.
   His aides, meanwhile, have said the new administration will adopt
a new approach to Nicaragua, seeking a diplomatic solution before
asking Congress for more military aid to the Contra rebels.
   Bush has already called on the Soviets to ``lighten up'' and
reduce their heavy military aid to the Sandinista government, which
is estimated at about $500 million a year.
   This suggests Bush is in a mood to compromise in Central America.
   But in a meeting with a group of prominent Hispanic Republicans
before Christmas, he pledged there would be no ``radical shift in
direction'' from the Reagan administration's policies toward Cuba
and Nicaragua.
   Norman Ornstein, a political analysts for the conservative
American Enterprise Institute, commented recently that ``two very
different personalities'' exist within Bush.
   ``One is the tough, hard-nosed, read my lips, make my day George
Bush. That's the George Bush who basically says we've got to take it
easy with the Soviets. We're not going to rush to judgment on a
strategic arms limitation treaty with the Soviets,'' Ornstein said.
   ``The other is the kinder and gentler, thousand points of light,
to reach out to Congress, to Jesse Jackson, to various groups George
Bush, the one who writes little notes to everybody. He's managed to
juggle the two personalities very adroitly. But I'm not sure it's
going to be as easy to do once he's inaugurated.''
   Bush, who joined Reagan in his last meeting with Gorbachev in
December in New York, has never made it entirely clear exactly where
he stands on dealing with the Soviet Union.
   Often he registers the caution of a moderate conservative,
occasionally the optimism of an idealist.
   ``The leadership of the Soviet Union is changing,'' he said in a
campaign speech last autumn in South River, N.J., ``but old
ambitions die hard. Systems die hard. And the leaves may be falling,
but the trees are fundamentally the same.''
   Announcing his selection of Baker a day after the election, Bush
said he sought progress in U.S.-Soviet relations but added: ``I've
never supported meetings just for the sake of having meetings.''
   And yet, the president-elect registered his willingness to meet
with Gorbachev if it would promote human rights in the Soviet Union
or any one of several U.S. goals.

   Jay Leno, Corbin Bernsen and Ed McMahon were
among the 250 celebrities and friends who honored NBC entertainment
president Brandon Tartikoff at a surprise 40th birthday party at
Dodger Stadium.
   Tartikoff was flown by helicopter into the stadium Sunday where
he was met by a marching band and Leno, who was host of a ``This is

   Among the stars cheering in the stands were McMahon, Bernsen and
his wife, actress Amanda Pays; Bernsen's fellow ``L.A. Law'' actor
Harry Hamlin and his wife, Laura Johnson of ABC's ``Heartbeat;''
Justine Bateman and Michael Gross of ``Family Ties;'' George Wendt
and John Ratzenberger of ``Cheers;'' Anthony Dennison, Susan St.
James, Sandy Duncan and Dodgers manager Tommy Lasorda.
   The party was arranged by Tartikoff's wife, Lilly. Guests
received blue baseball caps that said ``Brandon, still a wonder at
40,'' a reference to his former nickname as the boy wonder of
television programming.
   ``This has all been overwhelming,'' Tartikoff told the crowd.
``Not only has my life been so blessed and so wonderful, but I
wondered (when I was flying in here) when will my life be happier
than at this moment?''

   Jane Fonda is promoting a new exercise video that
embraces her new philosophy of moderation, saying she is ``striving
hard to control compulsive tendencies.''
   ``In the old days I was very driven,'' Fonda said in an interview
today in The New York Times. ``Now I want to enjoy things more, to
add more moderation to my life.''
   Fonda's new 65 minute video features exercises that are less
strenuous than her previous tapes, in which she urged followers to
``go for the burn.'' The new tape includes a 30-minute segment in
which half of the on-screen class does high-impact aerobics and half
does low-impact, giving viewers a choice.
   ``I'm not as macho as several years before,'' the 51-year-old
actress said. ``Hard and fast is not as effective as longer workouts
in moderation. ...
   ``Now I'm striving hard to control compulsive tendencies.''
   Fonda said she is already working on her next exercise video and
aims to attract ``the institutionalized couch potatoes.''

   Nearly nine years after former President Jimmy
Carter commuted Patty Hearst's prison sentence, President Reagan is
looking into a possible pardon for the newspaper heiress.
   Reagan was asked Sunday on his return to the White House from
Camp David whether he planned to pardon Ms. Hearst, who received a
seven-year sentence for participating in the armed robbery of a San
Francisco bank.
   ``All of this thing, I have asked everybody to look into this for
me,'' he replied.
   He walked into the White House without elaborating.
   After Carter commuted her sentence, Ms. Hearst was released from
prison Feb. 1, 1979. She had served 23 months.
   Ms. Hearst last August made a quiet bid for a pardon, asking for
forgiveness for her role in the 1974 robbery of a Hibernia Bank
branch.
   She has maintained she was brainwashed by the radical Symbionese
Liberation Army, a group of self-styled revolutionaries who abducted
her in Berkeley, Calif., in February 1974 and orchestrated the bank
heist.

   Eleven-year-old Stormie Jones, the world's

discharged from a hospital after seven days of tests determined her
liver was working properly.
   Stormie, of White Settlement, Texas, returned to Pittsburgh last
week after routine tests in Texas showed elevated blood levels, a
sign of possible liver malfunction.
   Her blood levels returned to normal during a stay in Children's
Hospital of Pittsburgh and tests showed her body was not rejecting

   Christopher Jeffries says he won't forget
his Michigan roots even after his marriage to Princess Yasmin Aga
Khan.
   Jeffries, 38, a Flint native and president of a New York real
estate company, plans to marry the princess Feb. 4 at the Plaza
Hotel in New York. The television show ``Lifestyles of the Rich and
Famous'' recently featured the couple's nuptial plans.
   The 39-year-old princess is the daughter of the late Prince Aly
Khan, spiritual leader of 5 million Ismaili Moslems, and the late
movie star Rita Hayworth. The marriage will be the second for her
and Jeffries.
   ``I still have close connections there. ... My entire family is
still there,'' Jeffries said of the Flint area. ``I still try to eat
at Whitey's (Restaurant) every quarter.''
   Jeffries' mother, Jocelyn, said she was surprised to find that
her future daughter-in-law was fond of the area during a recent
visit.
   ``She thought Flint was quite charming,'' Mrs. Jeffries said.

   Fire officials hope they have doused the
enthusiasm of two volunteers who rush to brush fires in their 1958
fire engine and 3,000-gallon water truck, sometimes ahead of the
regular firefighters.
   William Myers and Mark Siebert agreed to recent Los Angeles Fire
Department orders to stop their efforts. But they say they have
earned the right to form a firefighting team because of their
participation in the Los Angeles Community Fire Patrol, the
neighborhood watch-style arm of the fire department.
   ``You might think we're eccentric,'' Myers said. ``But our
eccentricity probably does a whole lot of good.''
   Authorities disagreed, saying the two have hampered paid
firefighters.
   ``They just don't understand the dangers to themselves and other
people,'' said John Orr, Glendale Fire Department senior arson
investigator. ``If they are found interfering with our activities in
Glendale again, they will be arrested.''
   Orr said Myers and Siebert blocked a road with their vehicles and
hampered firefighters at an Oct. 15 fire.
   But Joe Cohen said the two beat city firefighters to a blaze on
his property. ``It was all over in five minutes, but who knows how
bad it would have gotten?'' Cohen said.
   Myers, a 39-year-old building contractor, said he and Siebert,
who run a fire equipment rental business, are not seeking publicity
and are not trying to form another fire department.
   Siebert, a 30-year-old part-time maintenance man, said he and his
friend take their work seriously and have attended community college

   A woman and three children who fell into
an ice-covered lake Sunday died after at least 30 minutes exposure
to the frigid water, authorities said.
   Carolee Strunk, 28, of Bangor, mother of two of the children,
survived the longest after the accident around 2:30 p.m. at Minsi
Lake, a popular ice fishing spot about 65 miles north of
Philadelphia.
   She was admitted in critical condition to Lehigh Valley Hospital
Center but died late Sunday night, authorities said.
   April Strunk, 9, and Jared Strunk, 5, her son and daughter, died
a few hours after the accident; a family friend, Sarah Bowers, 8, of
East Bangor was pronounced dead at 8:35 p.m., hospital spokesman Rob
Stevens said.
   The four fell through the ice about 150 yards from shore and
eventually were pulled out, along with an unidentified fisherman who
fell in going to their assistance, said Daryl Moser, a Portland
rescue official.
   The fisherman was treated at a hospital and discharged, officials
said.
   April and Jared were taken to Pocono Hospital in East
Stroudsburg, where April was declared dead at 5:30 p.m. and Jared
was declared dead about 45 minutes later, officials said.
   Coroner Bob Allen said that people immersed in icy water for four
minutes usually suffer brain death, but people have been known to
survive more than 30 minutes.
   Upper Mount Bethel Township Police Officer Brett Young said the
Fish and Game Commission had posted warning signs about the ice. He
said police did not know why the four were on the ice. There were no
witnesses.
   Young said the temperature in the area was about 40 degrees
during the day.

   Minority enrollment in U.S. colleges increased
over the past decade, but the number of black males enrolled
declined.
   Black males also earned the fewest degrees and made the least
progress in number of faculty positions held, the American Council
on Education said Sunday in its seventh annual status report on
Minorities in Higher Education.
   Federal statistics reviewed by the council found total college
enrollment grew from 11 million to 12.5 million from 1976 to 1986,
but black male enrollment fell from 470,000 to 436,000. Black women,
by contrast, held a steady share throughout the period, starting at
5.1 percent and ending at 5.2 percent.
   Asian and Hispanic participation jumped 15 percent and 17 percent
respectively from 1984 to 1986, fueling an 8 percent gain for
minorities as a group, said the report.

   Outgoing Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci is
warning that automatic cuts in the Pentagon budget mandated under
the Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction law would be ``devastating.''
   There has been speculation that if the Bush administration and
Congress fail to reach agreement on reducing the federal budget
deficit, the White House might be willing to accept the automatic
spending cuts.
   ``It would certainly be devastating to the Defense Department.
... Based on preliminary estimates we'd have to take something like
$26 billion out of the Defense Department,'' Carlucci said Sunday on
ABC's ``This Week With David Brinkley.''
   ``Our force structure is down to about the minimum you can get
and still maintain our rotation schedules,'' he said. ``So cuts of
those dimensions would really mean laying up ships, getting rid of
people, taking away ammunition.''

   After a march by 5,000 opposition
supporters, President Daniel Ortega said the government plans to
give the opposition greater political opportunity and those who
don't want it can ``look for their democracy in Miami.''
   In his Sunday speech, Ortega also said he would propose severe
budget cuts that would require extensive government layoffs.
   Sunday's opposition demonstration, the largest since a July 10
rally in the town of Nandaime that police broke up with tear gas and
beatings, was called to protest the leftist government's economic
management and political repression.
   The peaceful march through Managua's streets was organized by the
Nicaraguan Democratic Coordinating Committee, a coalition of 14
opposition parties and several unions.
   ``We hope to have more demonstrations like this, more unity.
There's no reason we can't run a single candidate for president next
year,'' said Coordinating Committee president Carlos Huembes.
   He claimed the fragmented opposition parties ``are united against
the Sandinista government.''
   Ortega did not refer directly to the demonstration or next year's
scheduled presidential elections in a speech hours later to about
1,000 representatives of pro-Sandinista organizations. But he said
sectors that oppose the government would be given a ``pluralistic''
opportunity.
   He said that those who have been ``dreaming of Yankee
intervention and the defeat of the revolution'' could ``look for
their democracy in Miami and stop enriching themselves in
Nicaragua.''
   It was a sarcastic reference to the thousands of Nicaraguans who
have fled the country in recent months, many to find themselves
homeless in Miami or other parts of the United States.
   Ortega acknowledged that Nicaragua's economic condition is ``very
critical'' and said the state's budget will have to be cut.
   He gave few specifics except to say the police budget would be
protected but that massive layoffs would be required in most
departments. On Dec. 31, Ortega had said he would cut the defense
budget 40 percent.
   No arrests were reported in the opposition march, whose
participants complained about the economy, saying they were not
earning enough to pay for rice, eggs, beer or milk.
   ``Where is the milk? Children are dying of hunger,'' said one
angry construction worker. Like many, he did not want to give his
name for fear of government retaliation.
   Others said that a quart of milk costs about 45 cents, while a
worker earns just 90 cents a day.
   Ortega blames Nicaragua's economic plight on the war against
U.S.-supported Contra rebels, a U.S. economic boycott and the
battering the nation received in October from Hurricane Joan.
   ``They are killing us with hunger but they don't want to blame
themselves,'' an old man wearing a straw hat said of the government.
   He said he was 81 and the only worse time he could remember was
the early 1930s, when Gen. Augusto Sandino was fighting U.S. Marine
occupiers.
   The 3{-hour march began with a Mass in memory of slain newspaper
editor Pedro Joaquin Chamorro, then wended its way almost two miles
to the cemetery where Chamorro is buried.
   ``Everybody's afraid, but people are beginning to lose their
fear. The hunger does it,'' said Alberto Borge.
   Borge said he was a computer technician, a former Sandinista and
a cousin of the powerful Interior Minister, Tomas Borge.
   The government issued a permit for the march, the largest
anti-Sandinista demonstration since the Nandaime rally.
   More than 40 demonstrators and 10 police were reported injured
and more than 30 people arrested when police broke up that protest.
The Sandinistas claimed Washington instigated the demonstration and
expelled U.S. Ambassador Richard Melton.
   Few police officers were visible Sunday. The Nicaraguan baseball
league's all-star game was given a morning start to coincide with
the march and drew 4,000 spectators.
   Chamorro was publisher of the newspaper La Prensa. His Jan. 10,
1978 assassination galvanized opposition to the dictatorship of the
late Anastasio Somoza, who was toppled a year later by the popular
revolution the Sandinistas rode to power.
   La Prensa, now published by one of Chamorro's sons, is the
country's only opposition newspaper.

   Subtle chaos in heartbeat patterns may be a
sign of health, while monotonous regularity might help doctors
predict if someone faces an increased risk of sudden death from
cardiac arrest, researchers say.
   Scientists hope the theory of chaos, which says orderly patterns
can be disguised as disorder, also will help them learn how the
brain works and plan the best time to give vaccines to prevent
epidemics.
   The extension of the mathematical theory into biology and
medicine was discussed Sunday during the annual meeting of the
American Association for the Advancement of Science.
   The theory, popularized by James Gleick's best-selling 1987 book
``Chaos,'' holds that complex and seemingly random events such as
weather, the flow of water in a stream or stock market fluctuations
really may result from simple equations or rules. As a result,
scientists in many fields have rushed to find examples of this chaos
_ or orderly disorder _ in their fields of study.
   Not everyone accepts the theory. University of Wisconsin
economist William Brock attacked some of its extensions, which he
didn't specify, as ``really wild stuff that tends to make us look
like we're a bunch of quacks.''
   Normal heartbeats are commonly viewed as regular and periodic,
but the pattern really is more erratic than people assume, said Dr.
Ary Goldberger, a Harvard Medical School cardiologist, and Dr.
Arnold Mandell, a psychiatry professor at the University of
California, San Diego.
   Goldberger said his studies found subtly chaotic variations from
beat to beat occur in healthy hearts, but such fluctuations are not
found in people who face an increased risk of death from sudden
cardiac arrest.
   Existing cardiac monitoring devices listen for average heart rate
and extra beats. But devices designed to detect monotonous
regularity _ or the absence of subtle chaos in heart rates _ might
help predict who faces elevated risk for having their heart stop,
Goldberger said.
   Mandell said pituitary cells are another example of
chaos-as-health and order-as-illness. The cells normally secrete
hormones in irregular bursts to help control growth, but Mandell's
research found that when such cells turn cancerous, they emit
hormones steadily.
   Walter Freeman, a physiologist at the University of California,
Berkeley, said that by implanting electrodes in rabbits' brains, he
discovered subtle but orderly brain-wave patterns hidden in the
seemingly random electrical activity. Each time a rabbit sniffed and
recognized a particular odor, the part of the brain responsible for
the sense of smell produced a similar pattern, he said.
   The discovery ``gets to the heart of how brains work'' by
revealing order in the ceaseless and seemingly chaotic electrical
``noise'' emitted by the brain as it processes information, Freeman
said.
   ``His work could lead to a new generation of computers that more
closely duplicate human brain function, and new ways of diagnosing
brain disorders'' by looking for deviations from subtle brain-wave
patterns, a University of California news release speculated.
   Mathematical patterns in the apparently random timing of measles,
rubella or mumps epidemics in New York, Baltimore, Milwaukee,
Detroit, St. Louis, Copenhagen and Aberdeen, Scotland, recently were
found by a team led by William Schaffer, of the University of
Arizona at Tucson's evolutionary biology department.
   Some critics have accused the team of trying to explain too much
with chaos theory. But if epidemics have hidden regularity, it could
help public health officials conduct vaccination campaigns when they
would be most effective, the journal Science reported earlier this
month.

<HEAD>Brazil Announces Economic Measures to Slash 1,000 Percent Inflation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LISA GENASCI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Jose Sarney has laid off
60,000 government employees, frozen wages and prices and revamped
the currency in a program of ``national salvation'' designed to
combat 933 percent inflation.
   ``No democracy can be preserved in a situation of
hyperinflation,'' he said in announcing the austerity program to the
nation late Sunday. ``We need to summon our courage to make sure
that we don't see blood and tears. To avoid that, we must rely on
our sweat and sacrifice.''
   Union leaders immediately threatened to call for a nationwide
general strike to protest the measures, which eliminate a system
that ties wage increases to inflation.
   The new program is the fourth major package of economic measures
imposed by Sarney, who took office in March of 1985, ending 21 years
of repressive, right-wing military rule.
   Sarney, in his nationwide radio and television address, referred
to it as ``a program of national salvation'' and called on Brazil's
154 million people to fight a ``total war against inflation using
the toughest weapons and most profound measures Brazil has ever
taken.''
   He said banks would be closed today and Tuesday to give them time
to adapt to the new measures, which include a 17 percent devaluation
of the Cruzado and creation of the so-called ``new cruzado'' worth
1,000 old ones.
   The program also scraps the automatic monthly indexing of
contracts, savings accounts and most financial transactions to cost
of living increases.
   Among the measures designed to slash the massive public spending
deficit were firing about 60,000 civil servants, the elimination of
five Cabinet ministries and the closing of 42 state companies and
agencies.
   The package also includes a 45-day price freeze on about 200
basic commodities.
   Sarney said it also aims to spur the economy and reduce a budget
deficit that now runs at 6 percent of the gross national product.
Last year, the GNP grew just 0.04 percent, while industrial growth
fell 2.23 percent from 1987, government figures show.
   Union leaders immediately criticized the plan.
   ``We weren't consulted about the measures, which will once more
cut into workers' salaries,'' said Luiz Mederos, leader of the Sao
Paulo metal workers' union. ``I have no doubts angry workers will
react negatively and they will have our support in organizing a
nationwide strike.''
   Union figures show that in the past two years, workers'
purchasing power has dipped by about 40 percent due to inflation.
   Brazil's past measures, though initially successful, have been
unable to contain inflation.
   Brazil's inflation rate hit an all-time-high annual rate of 933
percent in 1988, substantially higher than 366 percent during the
previous year.
   Inflation in December rose to 28.8 percent, well above the
25-percent limit set by business, social and government leaders in a
``social pact'' announced in November.
   Brazil is the Third World's leading debtor nation, owing $115
billion.

<HEAD>Remote Minnesota County Flooded By Homesteading Applicants</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An offer of free 40-acre parcels for people
willing to settle in a remote county on the Canadian border has
brought more than 4,000 inquiries, some from as far afield as West
Germany and Guam.
   ``It's been mind-boggling,'' said Jim Lemieux, a member of the
Bidstead Advisory Council in International Falls, county seat of
Koochiching County.
   Homesteaders will be required to build a home and live there for
at least 10 years. They are expected to be self-sufficient, so as
not to drain the local economy, and are subject to an extensive
credit and criminal-records check.
   The offer received widespread publicity last month, and since
then Lemieux said the county has received inquiries from all 50
states and Canada, Ireland, England, West Germany, Spain, Mexico,
Japan, Puerto Rico and Guam.
   The 4,000 calls and letters add up to more than a quarter of
Koochiching County's population of about 15,700, scattered over
3,120 square miles and eight communities in an area about 300 miles
north of Minneapolis.
   ``The idea of homesteading, it boggles their mind. People want to
get back to their roots,'' Lemieux said last week. ``The heaviest
concentration has been from the Chicago area, New York, Florida and
California. If you've been to any of those areas, you know why.''
   The county's population has dropped by about 2,000 since 1980,
attributed in part to the 1984 closing of a fiberboard plant and a
trend away from rural areas, in favor of metropolitan regions.
   The decline prompted county officials to seek approval last year
for the Bidstead and Economic Development Program. Officials coined
the term `bidstead' from the words bid and homestead.
   The program is believed to be the first large-scale land giveaway
since the federal homestead program of the late 1800s, U.S.
officials say.
   Joy Lewis, 36, of King, N.C., read of the offer a few weeks ago
in the Winston-Salem (N.C.) Journal and could hardly wait until
Koochiching County offices opened that morning so she could get more
information.
   ``I do a lot of crazy things,'' she said in a telephone interview.
   She said she and her husband, Wayne, a machine repairman, have
always wanted land as something to pass along to their four
children, and they find Minnesota's ``Land of 10,000 Lakes''
appealing for camping and fishing.
   But at the top of her list is ``a sense of adventure,'' she said.
   For Judybeth Hagerty, 49, the offer sounds like a chance to put
down roots and escape the quick pace of life in Vacaville, Calif.,
about midway between San Francisco and Sacramento.
   Even the weather, which earned International Falls a reputation
as ``The Nation's Icebox'' _ a reputation it lived up to last week
with temperatures dipping to minus 31 degrees and never surpassing
15 above _ hasn't chilled enthusiasm for the giveaway.
   ``I just like the openness, the kind of pioneering type of
atmosphere,'' said Hagerty, a secretary and Texas native who lived
in Alaska for five years.
   ``I'm just fed up with the cities. I'm looking for something
totally different from this kind of life here,'' she said by
telephone.
   Officials have allocated 50,000 acres, enough for 1,250
homesteaders, from woods and farmland taken over by the county when
owners failed to pay taxes.
   ``We don't want freeloaders,'' Lemieux said. ``We want people who
will contribute to the quality of life and the economy. We're
getting some quality people applying _ but no brain surgeons, yet.''
   Some applicants are retirees, others are computer programmers,
artists and attorneys who could work out of their homes, Lemieux
said.
   International Falls was founded in 1906 with a sawmill operation
and took its name from the falls on Rainy River that were later
dammed. The area's major industries include wood products, tourism
and the cold-weather testing of products including helicopters,
autos and oil.
   Bidstead program director Jerry Andre said officials were
completing contracts for two applicants, who applied before the
recent flood of inquiries. At least four more applications are
nearing the final stage.
   ``My own personal feeling is that if we got 10 percent of the
respondents to actually participate, it would be a godsend for the
county. Ten percent would be a real boon,'' Lemieux said.

<DATELINE>TAMPICO, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When Ronald Reagan launched his presidential
campaign in 1976, he started it with a ceremony in his tiny hometown
and promised to return after he won the office.
   It's 13 years later, and Tampico is still waiting.
   And residents wonder why the title ``birthplace of a president''
never translated into tourism and fame for this dusty farming
community.
   ``The tourists never came because we didn't have Billy Carter
sitting here drinking beer,'' said Stan Headings, 49, owner of The
Dutch Diner.
   Headings opened the diner shortly after Reagan _ whose nickname
is ``Dutch'' _ took office in 1981. He figured to cash in on
Tampico's connection with the president.
   ``I thought property values would go up and maybe I'd buy some
land and sell it later to make a little money,'' Headings said. ``In
fact, property didn't go up and there was no way for me to get my
money out of it.''
   He was luckier than other entrepreneurs, whose ventures such as
gift shops and antique stores failed.
   Headings combined good food with a good gimmick _ free eggs with
every $5 purchase.
   ``Luckily, our business does not depend on ... tourists
interested in Reagan.''
   Headings' restaurant is two doors from the old First National
Bank building where Nellie Reagan gave birth to Ronald Wilson Reagan
in an upstairs apartment on Feb. 6, 1911.
   The bank closed in 1937 and its facade is virtually unchanged
except for a sign proclaiming it the ``Birthplace of President
Ronald Reagan.''
   Inside, visitors can find Paul and Helen Nicely surrounded with
mementos and guarding Tampico's link with Reagan.
   ``President Reagan set up his national campaign headquarters here
in 1976 and he spent the day,'' said Nicely, a 70-year-old retired
teacher who earned a graduate degree for his years of research on
Reagan.
   ``Before he left he said he'd be back. But he's never been back.''
   Mayor Roy Sigel describes Tampico as a proud town, saddened that
its favorite son never comes home.
   The perceived snub is magnified because Reagan has found time
during his eight years as president to drop in at his nearby alma
mater, Eureka College; to his boyhood home of Dixon just 35 miles
away; and most recently to Davenport, Iowa, about 60 miles from
Tampico.
   ``I feel bad he doesn't come by and see us once in a while,''
Sigel said. ``But he has different priorities.
   ``He's the most powerful man in the world. He can't be bothered
with us. There's no resentment. Disappointment is the proper word.''
   Three calls to the White House seeking comment were not returned.
   Although folks here have seen railroads, canals, farm families
and industry come and go, Tampico has changed little since Reagan
cut his teeth here. Main Street is listed on the National Historic
Register.
   Tampico, a town of about 950 people, still throws a birthday
party for Reagan every February. Their invitations to the hometown
boy who made good go unanswered.
   ``President Reagan didn't make it, but we had a great party
anyway,'' said the mayor's wife, Pat.
   ``Of course, when I say that I mean no resentment for the
president. We love him. That's why we have a party for him.''

<HEAD>Heart Disease Death Rate Drops Dramatically; Still Biggest Killer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MONTEREY, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Heart disease remains the nation's
biggest killer, taking a life every 32 seconds, but researchers have
made ``unbelievable'' progress in taming the disease, according to
the American Heart Association.
   Figures released Sunday show that deaths from heart and blood
vessel disease have dropped 24 percent during the past decade.
Researchers attribute the improvement to healthier living habits and
better treatment.
   ``The public ought to appreciate the progress that has been made
in heart disease over the past 20 years,'' said Dr. Myron L.
Weisfeldt, the association's president-elect.
   ``It's almost unbelievable. There is almost no form of heart
disease that we can't approach without meaningful treatment.''
   However, Weisfeldt, a heart specialist at Johns Hopkins
University, cautioned that much work remains in improving care and
encouraging people to take better care of themselves.
   ``I believe we can prevent at least 50 percent of the ischemic
heart disease in the United States by the year 2000 if we stop
smoking, get cholesterol treated if it's above 220 and identify and
treat hypertension,'' he said.
   Ischemic heart disease is the clogging of blood vessels that feed
the heart. It underlies most heart attacks, the single most lethal
heart ailment.
   The association said that in 1986, the most recent year for which
there are statistics, an estimated 978,500 Americans died from heart
attacks, strokes and other diseases of the heart and blood vessels.
Cancer, the No. 2 killer, took 466,000 lives.
   The association's latest figures show that more than one in four
Americans suffers some form of cardiovascular disease, and almost
half eventually die from it.
   However, the figures also bear out the brightening outlook:
Between 1976 and 1986, the death rate from all forms of
cardiovascular disease fell 24 percent, including 28 percent for
heart attacks and 40 percent for strokes.
   ``The good news is that we continue to see an improvement in the
death rate from the biggest killer of our population,'' said Dr.
Bernadine Healy of the Cleveland Clinic Foundation, the
association's current president.
   ``Those trends are dramatic and don't seem to be reversing,'' she
said. ``The bad news is that heart disease is still killing almost 1
million Americans a year, and we've got a long way to go.''
   About 60 percent of the heart-attack deaths occur before the
victim reaches the hospital. Studies show that about half of all
heart attack victims wait more than two hours before getting to an
emergency room.
   Weisfeldt said a major goal is getting people to go to the
hospital within three or four hours of the first sign of heart
attacks. During this period, there is still time to give them drugs
to dissolve the blood clots that are causing their heart attacks.
This treatment can save lives and reduce the disability of heart
attacks.
   Other major goals, he said, including finding ways to improve the
effectiveness of angioplasty, which uses balloons to reopen clogged
heart arteries, and finding surgical and medical techniques to
identify and protect people at risk of cardiac arrest.
   The association estimates that cardiovascular disease will cost
$88.2 billion this year in medical expenses and lost wages. In 1986,
it estimated the cost at $78.6 billion.
   Among other statistics released by the association:
   _The most common cardiovascular disease is high blood pressure,
which affects 60 million Americans.
   _About 200,000 of the deaths from cardiovascular disease each
year occur in people under age 65.
   _There were 1,418 heart transplants in 1987, almost nine times as
many as in 1983.
   _About 2.5 million Americans have angina, the chest pain
resulting from clogged heart arteries. About 300,000 new cases occur
annually.
   _Up to 1.5 million Americans will have heart attacks this year.

<HEAD>Two Koreas Agree To Highest-Level Talks Since Korean War</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Communist North Korea today agreed to
rival South Korea's proposals to hold the highest-level political
and military talks on easing tensions since the Korean War.
   Prime Minister Yon Hyung Mok of North Korea accepted the south's
proposal that he and his South Korean counterpart, Kang Young-hoon,
should head their respective delegations at talks to be held in both
country's capitals.
   ``The north and south should remove the state of tension which is
driving the same people toward disaster,'' Yon said in a letter to
his Kang. He said the two Koreas should ``prepare a firm foundation
for peaceful unification.''
   Yon proposed a meeting at the Panmunjom border truce site on Feb.
8 at which vice ministers would work out terms for full-scale talks.
No date was mentioned for the main talks, and the two sides are
expected to face problems on agreeing on terms.
   Yon repeated the north's demand for separate talks with South
Korea and the United States on reducing tension on the divided
peninsula. He also demanded an end to annual South Korea-U.S.
military exercises.
   ``It is obvious to everyone that the north and south can not
fundamentally resolve the question of peace by setting aside the
United States, which is the party responsible for the aggravation of
tension,'' the letter said.
   South Korea and the United States have rejected the north's
demands for separate three-way talks.
   Seoul agreed last month to the north's call for high-level
political and military talks on reducing tension. It also proposed
that the prime ministers head the delegations to make the talks the
highest since the war.
   While agreeing to upgrade talks to that level, the north has
rejected the south's proposal for separate economic and Red Cross
humanitarian talks. It said economic issues can be resolved after
the political issues and Red Cross talks are outside any official
control.
   The two sides have failed to make progress on improving relations
in scattered talks over the past two decades, and a major diplomatic
breakthrough is seen as unlikely by many observers as long as North
Korean leader Kim Il Sung remains in power.
   Kim ordered the 1950 invasion of the south that started the
Korean War.
   Talks between lawmakers from the two sides ran into trouble last
month after the north suddenly demanded an end to the South
Korea-U.S. military exercises. The demand came as the two Koreas
appeared close to agreeing on terms for inter-parliamentary talks on
a non-aggression agreement.
   The parliamentary delegations are due to meet again in February.
   In his letter, Yon said the proposed prime minister's meeting
should also focus on halting ``large-scale provocative military
exercises.''
   South Korean officials have warned that the north wants to use
talks with the south to secure withdrawal of the 42,000 U.S. troops
based in the south under a mutual defense treaty.
   South Korean leaders say U.S. forces are vital to maintain a
balance against North Korea's larger forces.
   In Seoul today, Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Indiana told reporters that
annual large-scale U.S.-South Korea military exercises will continue
as long as the South Korean government wants them.
   ``If the Republic of (South) Korea wants to change them, we will
discuss it, but they have not,'' said the Indianan, ranking
Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. The joint
exercises have been conducted in various parts of the south since
1976.
   The two Koreas were created after U.S. and Soviet forces ended
Japan's occupation in 1945 and divided the Korean peninsula.
   The two sides have clashed over the years since the Korean War
and keep hundreds of thousands of troops poised along the 150-mile
border. There are no communication links except for a single hot
line.

<TEXT>
   An advertising agency replaced promotional
calendars distributed to 65 McDonald's restaurants because they
mistakenly labeled the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday as ``National
Nothing Day.''
   Officials at John Malmo Advertising blame a clerical error for
the ``National Nothing Day'' notation on Jan. 16 instead of noting
the federal holiday honoring the slain civil rights leader's
birthday, said spokeswoman Cathleen West. King was born on Jan. 15,
1929, but the federal holiday is the third Monday in January.
   ``It certainly was not done intentionally or maliciously. It was
a terrible clerical oversight,'' she said.
   The managers of 65 McDonald's restaurants in Memphis, where King
was assassinated April 4, 1968, received the calendars to help
remind them when sales promotions begin and end.
   ``It was unfortunately a terrible, terrible oversight,'' said Ms.
West, who handles McDonald's account with Malmo. ``It's not
McDonald's fault.''
   The National Nothing Day holiday has been listed on the calendar
in past years as a spoof of special days that salute everything from
pickles to world poetry, she said.
   The error was not noticed until an annoyed McDonald's employee
called to complain. The managers have received corrected calendars,
Ms. West said.
   The day before the mistake was discovered, the company saluted 10
black high school students as ``McDonald's Talented Teens: Black
History Makers of Tomorrow.'' The students received plaques and $200
awards at a banquet featuring black community leaders, said Steve
Lykins, vice president of Century Management, which owns two dozen
McDonald's restaurants in the region.

   As Martin Luther King Jr.'s message of peace and
justice is remembered today, his widow is fighting Boston University
over 83,000 documents left by the slain civil rights leader.
   Coretta Scott King sued her husband's alma mater in December
1987, seeking return of the papers, which include early glimmerings
of his ``I Have a Dream'' speech, a prescribed diet and hate mail.
She insists they belong with the rest of the King archives at the
King Center in Atlanta.
   Boston University, in turn, sued Mrs. King. The private school
claims it is the rightful owner of all King papers, including the
100,000 in Atlanta.
   Efforts at an out-of-court settlement failed, details of which
neither party will disclose. Instead, both sides want a trial to
settle the matter. But they disagree on what issues the trial should
decide. The dispute is now before state Appeals Court Judge
Christopher Armstrong.
   King earned his doctorate in theology at Boston University in
1955. It was there he met his future wife, a music student.
   In 1964, the year he won the Nobel Peace Prize, King wrote to
Boston University that on his death the university would be ``the
repository of my correspondence, manuscripts and other papers.''
   Four years later, he was assassinated in Memphis, Tenn. He would
have been 60 on Sunday.
   The university's collection represents about one-third of King's
documents and correspondence and it was in the school's possession
when he died.
   The collection is mostly sermons that King composed on yellow
legal paper in his thin scrawl and fills 16 file drawers. There are
also letters, many unsigned from strangers, including hate-filled
ones. One of the few scraps of more personal items is an Alabama
doctor's prescription for a strict diet of bread, lean meat,
vegetable, salad and skim milk.
   Mrs. King's lawyers have argued that her late husband's letter to
Boston University isn't binding, being neither a contract nor a
charitable pledge and in violation of laws governing wills. King
left no will.
   Melvin Miller, an attorney representing Boston University, had
little to say about the case, other than that he was talking to
witnesses and taking depositions.
   ``Nothing's happening,'' he said recently.
   In August, Suffolk Superior Court Judge John L. Murphy said Mrs.
King can sue Boston University for the papers but must then explain
why it took her 23 years to seek their return.
   Murphy said the trial must decide whether the two-decade delay is
unfair to Boston University. He also threw out the university's
claim to own all of King's papers.
   In November, Boston University appealed that ruling to Armstrong.
   ``When Judge Armstrong does rule we expect to be moving to have a
trial right away,'' said Mrs. King's attorney, James F. O'Brien.
   Mrs. King's lawsuit also claimed the collection is not properly
displayed or preserved at Boston University. Some of the documents
are on display in the library, but most is stored in a
climate-controlled room.

   Firecracker powder ignited by a
cigarette engulfed a Vietnamese passenger bus in flames, killing at
least 43 people, official Radio Hanoi reported.
   The bus suddenly burst into flames on Saturday while waiting to
cross a bridge in Thanh Hoa province south of the capital of Hanoi,
the radio said. A text of Sunday's broadcast was seen in Bangkok
today.
   ``According to initial reports, 43 people were killed and four
others seriously injured,'' it said. ``The fire was caused by a
large amount of firecracker powder carried on the bus by passengers
which was ignited and set off by a cigarette butt.''
   The brief broadcast said the express bus was travelling from
Hanoi to Nghe Tinh province just south of Thanh Hoa.

<HEAD>Scientist Begin Training And Feeding Broad Bay Dolphin</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A young dolphin that has refused to
leave Broad Bay's chilly waters for six weeks despite two federal
rescue attempts is being trained to survive the winter.
   ``Because he's young, he would normally be in a herd of dolphins
and depend on the experience of older animals for guidance,'' Joseph
R. Geraci, a U.S. Marine Mammal Commission veterinarian, said Sunday.
   ``Without that guidance, his greatest need as I see it is for
social contact. Being in cold water, he also needs a lot of food.''
   Dolphin trainer Richard L. Trout has begun school for the young
animal, nicknamed ``Rascal'' by residents.
   Trout, who has trained the sea mammals for 15 years, raps on the
side of his boat three times to bring Rascal to the surface. When
the dolphin surfaces, Trout tosses him a sea trout or herring.
Rather than gobble the treat, Rascal bounces it on his nose or kicks
it with his tail.
   Trout said that is a natural habit of dolphins who consider dead
fish toys rather than food. He must train Rascal to stop playing
with his food.
   The decision to help Rascal learn to adapt to his new
surroundings ends six weeks of debate over his fate. Residents
became concerned when he stayed in the bay while other dolphins
headed down the Atlantic Coast in the fall.
   Rascal had become a favorite of boaters as he would swim along
side pleasure boats and entertain residents along the shore.
   Federal officials approved two rescue attempts, but both failed.
   Because of the dropping water temperatures _ now in the low 40s _
most of the small fish that dolphins feed on have left the bay, and
Geraci said that Rascal, at about 250 pounds, is lighter than
normally would be expected.
   Federal law prohibits training or feeding of wild dolphins in
open water, but Geraci said Rascal's circumstances made him a
special case.
   ``He's got none of the scars that dolphins get by wrestling and
playing in the herd,'' Geraci said. ``He's in good physical
condition. He's bright-eyed, very alert and responsive.''
   Rascal's apparent health and the fact that the animal has adapted
to cold water in Broad Bay probably means the animal can survive
until warmer weather arrives in six to eight weeks, Geraci said.

<HEAD>Street Drug `Angel Dust' Protects Brain From Injury</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RAEBURN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Editor</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``Angel dust'' protects the brain during
strokes, heart attacks and surgery, and a safer form of the often
abused street drug could be in wide use soon for some stroke and
cardiac victims, researchers say.
   The drug, known technically as PCP or phencyclidine, acts as a
stimulant and a depressant and poduces a psychological state similar
to schizophrenia, Dr. Edward F. Domino of the University of Michigan
in Ann Arbor said Sunday.
   He said at least seven classes of drugs have now been found that
have actions in the brain similar to those of PCP.
   So-called ``designer drugs'' that act like PCP but are chemically
distinct have been synthesized in illicit laboratories, Domino said
at the annual meeting of the American Association for the
Advancement of Science.
   Researchers are also busy synthesizing designer versions of PCP,
hoping to find new drugs that will impart PCP's beneficial effects
without its harmful consequences.
   ``You wouldn't give PCP on a routine basis,'' Domino said, who
expects a safer form of it could be in widespread use in as little
as five to 10 years for stroke and heart attack victims and patients
undergoing surgery.
   Also Sunday, Dr. Stephen Peroutka of Stanford University reported
that the banned drug known as ``ecstasy'' may have long-term
damaging effects on the brain.
   Ecstasy has been described by those who've used it as producing
warm, friendly feelings. Peroutka has found that the drug damages
brain cells in animals, suggesting that it may do the same thing in
humans. Conclusive studies in humans do not yet exist, he said.
   Nevertheless, he said, ``recreational use should definitely be
avoided until scientists figure out'' precisely how the drug works.
Ecstasy is an amphetamine derivative known to scientists as MDMA.
   Domino said the potential protective effects of PCP have been
found in an anesthetic called ketamine, which is used rarely in the
United States but frequently used in developing countries because it
is comparatively safe.
   Ketamine produces the same ill effects as PCP, but they don't
last as long and they can be controlled with certain tranquilizers,
Domino said. Some version of ketamine might prove to be a safe drug
to protect the brain, he said.
   The loss of blood to the brain, even for a short time, leads to
the death of brain cells, Domino said.
   PCP and its relatives, including ketamine, block the chemical
changes associated with that nerve cell destruction, Domino said,
and thus prevent or limit the loss of nerve cells.
   The studies of PCP are also leading to a new understanding of
brain chemistry and may help researchers understand other disorders,
Domino said.

<HEAD>`Frontier' Violence Impeding Aquino's Struggle To Build A Democracy</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT H. REID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Filipinos sat fixated before their
television sets as troops poured automatic fire and rockets into a
military camp. Was the target Communist or Moslem insurgents? No. It
was the police.
   Later, the hottest topic of newspaper and broadcast commentators
was a report that hundreds of Uzi submachine guns and Galil rifles
were being imported into a country already awash with weapons.
   The importer was the House of Representatives.
   The two episodes illustrate the nature of Philippine society,
where a Westernized, democratic veneer covers an often violent land
of ``Dodge City'' social norms.
   They also underscore the challenge facing President Corazon
Aquino in trying to build a modern, progressive nation in a land
still locked into corrupt and violent ways.
   The United States, which maintains six military bases in the
archipelago nation and is committed to helping build democracy in
the Philippines, has a substantial stake in her success.
   President Reagan this month proposed doubling aid to the
Philippines to $649.4 million at a time when assistance to other
nations is being held in check or reduced.
   Continued weaknesses and shortcomings in the 165,000-member armed
forces were highlighted by the three-day takeover of the regional
headquarters of the Philippine Constabulary in Zamboanga City, 560
miles south of Manila.
   On Jan. 5, about 15 Moslem policemen and their supporters, angry
over plans to charge them in a 1984 killing, managed to seize
control of the garrison and killed the commander and his chief of
staff.
   The renegades then held out for two days against a furious
military assault by nearly 1,000 troops after the government refused
further negotiations.
   By the time the garrison was secured, 21 people, all but two of
them renegades, were dead. But the renegades' leader, Rizal Alih,
escaped to the humiliation of Chief of Staff Gen. Renato de Villa,
who ordered the assault.
   Meanwhile, the regional headquarters was destroyed, becoming the
second major garrison destroyed in 18 months of military operations
against dissident soldiers or police.
   The general staff headquarters in Manila was gutted during the
August 1987 coup attempt by former Lt. Col. Gregorio Honasan. No
major headquarters has been destroyed in clashes with Communist or
Moslem rebels since Mrs. Aquino took office in 1986.
   Most Manila television stations, which rarely report events
outside the capital, dispatched crews to Zamboanga. Dramatic footage
of soldiers battling police shocked residents of the capital, many
of whom are largely insulated from violence in the countryide.
   ``The inconclusive result is now viewed by a shocked nation as
using a sledgehammer to swat a fly,'' wrote columnist Jesus Bigornia
in The Manila Bulletin.
   In the aftermath of the Zamboanga incident, de Villa has ordered
commanders to weed out ``scalawags'' from the police and military
ranks. Yet many Filipinos are skeptical this crackdown on
lawlessness in the ranks will be any more effective than those that
came before.
   Last year, Cicero Campos, chairman of the National Police
Commision, said his agency received an average of 1,500 complaints a
year of criminal activity by some of the country's 52,000 policemen.
He admitted the figure was the ``tip of the iceberg,'' and few of
the complaints result in prosecution or dismissal.
   ``What do the authorities do about these criminal elements
dressed in law enforcement uniforms,'' wrote columnist Ninez
Cacho-Olivares in the newspaper BusinessWorld. ``Do they wait until
these criminal elements storm a building or an army camp before
moving in on them?''
   Less dramatic _ but equally ominous _ were reports in Manila
newspapers that the House of Representatives was importing up to 600
Uzi submachine guns and Galil rifles to provide ``security'' for its
some 200 members.
   Rep. Renato Unico, a member of the House defense committee,
confirmed the reports and said the Israeli-made weapons had been
ordered after the chamber's security force ran away during the
August 1987 coup attempt.
   Unico, dubbed ``Uzico'' by radio commentators, said congressmen
needed the weapons for protection during visits to remote districts,
where Communist and Moslem insurgents operate.
   But the idea of congressional security guards wielding
high-powered firearms, paid for by tax money, raised the specter of
a return to the ``private armies,'' which Filipino politicians
traditionally used to intimidate opponents and guarantee their
re-election.
   Mrs. Aquino had promised to disband such ``private armies,''
which were believed to number nearly 300 when she came to power.
   ``Let's face it, political bouts are settled as much by blood and
bullets as by ballots,'' wrote the Philippine Daily Inquirer in an
editorial.
   The newspaper Malaya said the report ominously suggests that
despite promises of a new era in Philippine politics, ``the
political warlordism of Philippine politics, with all its negative
connotations, is here to stay.''

<HEAD>Americans Feel Better Off After Reagan, But Pessimistic About Future</HEAD>

   Americans believe they are better off after
President Reagan's eight years in office by a margin of more than
two to one, but more are pessimistic about the next five years than
optimistic, a survey has found.
   A Time-CNN poll also found that Americans believe reducing the
budget deficit should be President-elect Bush's first priority, ad
they believe Bush will do a better job handling the deficit and
several other major issues than his popular predecessor. Poll
results were released in this week's issue of Time magazine.
   Sixty percent of respondents in the survey said the country is
better off as a result of Reagan's presidency, compared with 27
percent who said it is worse off.
   Respondents were more pessimistic about the future, though, with
43 percent saying they expect conditions to be worse five years from
now and 39 percent expected them to be better. Ten percent predicted
no change.
   The survey had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage
points.
   The budget deficit was cited as the nation's most pressing
problem, with 33 percent saying it should be Bush's priority.
Twenty-two percent said dealing with terrorism should be Bush's
number one job. Twenty percent cited the fight against drugs and 11
percent mentioned the trade deficit.
   Fifty-seven percent said they thought Bush would handle the
budget deficit better than Reagan, while 17 percent said he would do
worse. An even greater 62 percent said Bush would do a better job
than Reagan in maintaining ethical standards in government, while
just 13 percent said he would fare worse.
   The survey found 50 percent had a favorable opinion of Bush,
compared with 21 percent who had an unfavorable opinion and 29
percent who were uncertain. And 29 percent said Bush's actions since
winning the election made them more confident about his becoming
president, while 11 percent said they were less confident.
   Vice President-elect Dan Quayle fared much worse, with 30 percent
expressing an unfavorable opinion and 20 percent regarding him
favorably. Fifty-two percent said they did not consider Quayle
qualified to assume the presidency if Bush were incapacitated.
   In ranking Reagan's two terms in office, 11 percent said he was a
great president, 37 percent scored his performance as good and an
equal percentage rated him as average. Fifteen percent of
respondents said he had been a poor president.
   The survey of 1,012 adults was conducted Jan. 9-10 by Yankelovich
Clancy Shulman.

<HEAD>Embattled Prime Minister Announces National Elections Next Month</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GLASS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Edward Seaga, who badly
trails socialist opposition leader Michael Manley in opinion polls,
has set Feb. 9 for Jamaica's first contested general election since
1980.
   Seaga, the Reagan administration's closest ally in the Caribbean,
will be seeking an unprecedented third consecutive term.
   On Sunday, the 58-year-old prime minister told a nationally
televised rally in Kingston: ``It is time for us to settle our
future.''
   During the 1980 election, more than 700 people were killed in
street skirmishes during a nine-month campaign. Last August, Seaga
and Manley signed a ``peace treaty'' setting out a code of conduct
for orderly campaigning.
   Seaga said Sunday that he was calling the election to allow the
shortest possible campaign under Jamaican law.
   Business leaders had urged a short campaign to minimize the risk
of unrest at the height of the winter tourist season. The industry,
Jamaica's main foreign currency earner, is still recovering from
Hurricane Gilbert, which battered the island on Sept. 12.
   Manley and his leftist People's National Party boycotted the last
election, in 1983, in a dispute over voter registration. That left
Seaga's center-right Jamaican Labor Party with all 60 seats in
Parliament.
   In a stirring one-hour speech Sunday, Seaga berated Manley's
record, and took credit for restoring political stablity, economic
recovery and international relations.
   Holding out his arms, he told cheering supports, ``In these
hands, your future is safe.''
   As prime minister during the 1970s, the 64-year-old Manley forged
close relations with Cuba, alarming the United States and foreign
investors.
   He has repeatedly called for a new election since his party's
1980 defeat, but Seaga has held out to give his free-enterprise,
export-oriented policies more time to strengthen the nation's
debt-ridden economy. Under Jamaica's parliamentary system, a prime
minister may call an election at any time before the end of his or
her five-year term.
   Seaga came to power with a pledge to pull Jamaica out of deep
economic decline. There have been recent signs of economic
improvement, but critics say his economic restructuring and
austerity measures have neglected social services such as health and
education, and his popularity has faded.
   Opinion polls have put Seaga's party roughly 13 points behind the
opposition for the past two years. Seaga narrowed the gap slightly
shortly after Hurricane Gilbert, but has since fallen back.
   The century's fiercest hurricane caused 45 deaths and an
estimated $1 billion in damage. Seaga has raised $600 million in
disaster relief from abroad, but there been bickering over relief
distribution.
   During his tenure, Seaga has courted Western governments and
international assistance agencies and has been a staunch supporter
of President Reagan. He was the first foreign leader invited to the
White House after Reagan took office in 1981.
   Manley also has served eight years as prime minister, from 1972
until 1980, earning a reputation as an ardent anti-imperialist and
socialist. In recent years, he has projected a more moderate image
and has portrayed Seaga as arrogant and lacking in compassion.
   No prime minister has won more than two consecutive terms since
universal suffrage was introduced in 1944. Jamaica, a nation of 2.3
million people 90 miles south of Cuba, gained independence from
Britain in 1962.

<HEAD>Mother, Three Youngsters Die After Falling Through Ice</HEAD>

   Four skaters, including a mother and her two
young children, died after they fell into a frigid lake despite a
fisherman's efforts to save them and signs warning of thin ice,
authorities said.
   ``I ran over there and my first reaction was to get those kids
out,'' said Carmen Gruppo, 37, who went to their aid Sunday
afternoon on Minsi Lake.
   ``I grabbed a piece of rope and tried to work my way out as close
as I could. Upon getting pretty close to them, I ended up falling in
also,'' said Gruppo, who was pulled out on a ladder by firefighters.
The others were pulled out by divers.
   Carolee A. Strunk, 27, her children, April, 8, and Jared, 5, and
the children's playmate, SaraAnn Bowers, 8, all of East Bangor, were
walking across the lake when the ice cracked underneath them,
authorities said.
   The group had planned to go skating at the popular ice-fishing
spot 65 miles north of Philadelphia, said Monroe County Coroner
Robert Allen.
   The four were in the water about 35 minutes before they were
rescued, and clung to life up to nine hours after the accident,
officials said.
   They fell through the ice about 150 yards from shore, said Capt.
Darryl Moser of the Portland Ambulance Corps diving unit.
   Gruppo said he threw a rope toward the victims but it was too
short.
   ``They were trying to reach the rope but couldn't,'' he said from
his Bangor home after treatment for hypothermia. ``I was basically
as helpless as they were.''
   Gruppo said he was terrified when he felt himself going under the
water's surface.
   ``I had to work my boots off, they filled up with water,'' he
said. ``Otherwise, I don't think I could have stayed afloat. Once I
was afloat I kept wondering how they were going to get me out and
the others out.''
   One of the first rescuers to arrive, Detective Sgt. Joseph
Victory of the Upper Mount Bethel Township Police Department, said
he also tried to help but turned back when he realized the ice would
break again.
   He said Gruppo appeared to feel the ice breaking around him, went
under, came to the surface and clung to the sides of a 10-foot hole
that expanded to 40 feet.
   The ice was 1 to 1{ inches thick in the area, said Moser, who
responded with three divers and two other rescuers.
   Signs warning of thin ice were posted near the area and the
victims were only 75 feet from open water, Moser said.
   ``I don't know if they didn't see the signs or just didn't pay
attention to them,'' he said.
   April Strunk was pronounced dead at Pocono Medical Center in East
Stroudsburg three hours after the accident, and her brother about 45
minutes later, officials said.
   SaraAnn was pronounced dead six hours after the accident at
Lehigh Valley Hospital Center in Allentown and Mrs. Strunk died
after nine hours, authorities said.

<TEXT>
   A 6-year-old girl told rescuers, ``It hurts
all over,'' while she was trapped for 7{ hours in a mudslide that
crushed her family's car and killed her mother, authorities said.
   The family was taking a drive to see the snow when ``the whole
mountain seemed to come down'' on their car, Coos County Sheriff's
Deputy Dave Nelson.
   The child's father, Michael Perry Edwards, 24, was freed from the
wreckage a short time after Sunday afternoon's accident by a search
and rescue team that happened to be on a training exercise in the
area, Nelson said. He was treated for minor injuries.
   Tasha Edwards was taken to Bay Area Hospital on Sunday night
after the rescue on a steep, muddy hillside 100 feet above the
rain-swollen south fork of the Coos River. She was listed as stable
today with a broken leg.
   Her 24-year-old mother, Vera Anne Edwards, was pronounced dead at
the scene.
   The slide occurred about 20 miles east of Coos Bay on a gravel
road owned by Weyerhaeuser Co.
   ``They came to a small slide and as he was driving around the
slide, the whole mountain seemed to come down on top of him,''
Nelson said.
   Edwards attempted to speed through the slide, but was trapped,
then the car was hit by a boulder at least 20 feet in diameter.
   Coast Guard Lt. Bruce Grinnell, who flew to the scene in a
helicopter, said the boulder landed directly on the car, a 1955
Chevrolet.
   ``There was a bumper sticking out each end of this rock,''
Grinnell said. ``It's amazing anybody survived it.
   ``The little girl was conscious and she was talking to
(rescuers). Her only quote was, `It hurts all over.'''
   The girl's mother was in the right front side of the car. The
girl was trapped in the front seat, rescuers said.
   Witnesses said the slide was about 80 feet wide and covered most
of the roadway, which winds along the hillside about 100 feet above
the muddy river.
   Rescuers said blankets had been passed to the girl during her
ordeal. Her father had remained at the scene and talked with her to
try to reassure her.
   She was extricated from the wreckage shortly after 8 p.m.,
officers said.
   Weyerhaeser officials said there was a report of the small slide
on the road about 11 a.m. so a worker was sent to check. The second,
larger slide apparently occurred moments before the worker reached
the scene.
   The worker found the car, heard people yelling for help and
notified authorities by radio.

   The fire at the rooming house here was one of five in the nation
during the past two days in which 20 people died. A predawn fire
today destroyed a rooming house in Niles, Mich., killing at least
five residents, police said.
   Three fires in eastern Missouri killed eight, including a family
of five who died trying to escape a blaze that destroyed their
mobile home.
   The badly burned bodies of the two men in Yonkers were found just
behind the front door of the three-story house, said Fire
Commissioner William McLaughlin.
   The bodies tumbled onto the stoop when firefighters forced open
the door, he said.
   Eight other people were injured in Sunday morning's fire, which
burned out of control for 2{ hours, officials said.
   The cause of the fire was not immediately determined. Many of the
bodies were burned beyond recognition, authorities said.
   ``All my friends are gone; they're all gone,'' said Charles
Waller, 43, a resident who escaped unharmed.
   The fire was the worst in Yonkers since 1965, when nine children
and three adults died in a blaze.
   ``It's devastating; it's very, very sad,'' said Elizabeth
Chraetien, a member of the nearby Our Lady of the Rosary Catholic
Church, where prayers for the victims were offered at Sunday Masses.
``This is a terribly poor area, but rich in love and care.''
   The fire also left 10 people homeless, including an 8-year-old
child, said Sam Delapena of the Westchester County Red Cross. One of
them was given shelter in a motel and the others were taken in by
friends or relatives.
   The victims died from smoke inhalation and burns, according to
the Westchester County Medical Examiner's Office.
   In southwestern Michigan, the fire was reported at 12:40 a.m. in
the two-story house. Five people were confirmed killed, said police
dispatcher Russell York. Three other people managed to escape, said
police Lt. Don Lighthart. The cause of the fire wasn't known.
   In Missouri, the bodies of Richard DeVore and his 5-year-old son,
Dustin, were found by firefighters in the front doorway of their
home in Lemay in St Louis County. Sunday was DeVore's 34th birthday.
   DeVore's wife, Charlotte, and the couple's three teen-ager
children escaped.
   A neighbor helped rescue Mrs. DeVore's brother, Charles Grounds,
26, a quadriplegic, authorities said.
   The mobile home blaze occurred just south of Lonedell, a
community of 100 people about 30 miles southwest of St. Louis.
   ``By the time the fire department got to the scene, the trailer
had already burned to the ground,'' said Franklin County sheriff's
Officer Pam Meneffree.
   Authorities said the five bodies were burned too badly for
positive identification, and confirmation of their tentative
identities will require autopsies.
   In north St. Louis, a 37-year-old man was killed in a fire that
caused extensive damage to a three-story house. Battalion Chief
Frank Schaper said the cause was not immediately determined.

   Anne Henderson-Pollard, the imprisoned wife
of convicted Israeli spy Jonathan Jay Pollard, is back in a prison
hospital, an official said.
   John Powers, a duty officer at the Federal Detention Center in
Danbury, confirmed Sunday that Mrs. Henderson-Pollard had been
transferred to the Federal Medical Center in Rochester, Minn., ``for
further evaluation and medical treatment if it's needed.''
   Powers said he did not know what led to the transfer the medical
center, where chronically ill inmates are kept.
   But her sister-in-law, Carol Pollard, said Mrs. Henderson-Pollard
collapsed in a bathroom at the prison Thursday night and was taken
to Danbury Hospital before the transfer.
   Mrs. Henderson-Pollard has been to the Minnesota hospital, which
is affiliated with the Mayo Clinic, twice before when she was
transferred there from the Lexington, Ky., hospital prison. Mrs.
Henderson-Pollard was transferred to Danbury in September.
   ``She has been maltreated for the past 25 months and this is the
third time they have sent her back,'' Ms. Pollard said Saturday.
``She is in severe pain now because they took all her medications
away.''
   Mrs. Henderson-Pollard is suffering from a digestive tract
disease, Ms. Pollard said. She has lost 60 pounds during the past
two years and now weighs 90 pounds, she said.
   Powers referred questions on Mrs. Henderson-Pollard's medical
treatment to the federal prisons' main office in Washington, where
phone calls went unanswered Sunday.
   Mrs. Henderson-Pollard was sentenced in March 1987 to five years
in prison after pleading guilty to conspiracy to receive embezzled
government property and being an accessory after the fact to
possession of state secrets.
   Her husband, a former Navy intelligence analyst, was sentenced to
life in prison after pleading guilty to selling secrets to Israel.
Pollard was arrested in November 1985 outside the Israeli embassy in
Washington and is jailed in Springfield, Mo.
   In a November interview, Mrs. Henderson-Pollard contended
authorities were ignoring her physical problems but an administrator
said she was receiving proper medical treatment.
   Lawyers for Mrs. Henderson-Pollard last year filed a motion with
the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington asking for a reduction of
her sentence because of deteriorating health.

<TEXT>
   Police detained at least 20
prominent Czechoslovaks before using clubs, dogs and water cannon to
break up a banned rally by thousands of people, a human rights
activist said today.
   Among those detained Sunday was former Foreign Minister Jiri
Hajek, said Anna Sabatova of the Charter 77 human rights group.
Hajek, 75, was a leader of the 1968 reform movement that was crushed
that year by a Soviet-led invasion.
   More than 5,000 people protested in Prague streets later Sunday
to commemorate a student who burned himself to death to protest the
invasion.
   Communist authorities said 91 ``of the most active instigators''
were detained. At least one person was badly injured and several
others, including members of a West German television crew, were
beaten by police.
   Sabatova said about 20 prominent activists, including author Eva
Kanturkovs and Charter 77 activists Ladislav Lis and Rudolf Battek,
were arrested before the rally as they prepared to lay flowers in
memory of the 20-year-old student.
   She said they were released after several hours, but it was not
certain whether those arrested during the rally were freed.
   The official news agency CTK denounced Sunday's rally, charging
it was instigated by ``Western subversive centers.''
   In East Germany on Sunday, police broke up a rally by several
hundred human rights activists in downtown Leipzig, witnesses said.
They said police arrested about 80 people.
   The demonstrators in Leipzig were protesting Friday's arrest of
11 opposition activists, the witnesses said on condition of
anonymity. The West German ARD television network said about 500
people took part.
   The police action in Prague came on a day Czechoslovakia joined
34 other countries in signing a landmark accord on human rights at
the Helsinki Review Conference in Vienna, Austria.
   The U.S. ambassador to the talks, Warren Zimmermann, said
Czechoslovakia's Communist authorities had violated the freedom of
assembly granted in the spirit of the 1975 Helsinki accords.
   In Prague, marchers chanted ``Long Live Freedom!'' and called for
the release of political prisoners as they headed toward Wenceslas
Square, jeering at police.
   White-helmeted riot police wielding rubber truncheons, some with
leashed dogs, attacked about 1,000 demonstrators who had gathered at
the square and sang the national anthem.
   Demonstrators were dispersed into side streets, but remained
there whistling and jeering at police.
   Several people were injured in beatings by police, and one man
was so badly injured that an ambulance had to be called. Among the
beaten was an ARD television crew, a correspondent of the West
German news agency DPA said.
   CTK reported 91 arrests.
   The rally was called as a tribute to Jan Palach, who ended his
life by setting himself ablaze in the square on Jan. 16, 1969.
   The suicide was a protest of the Warsaw Pact invasion the
previous year that crushed the ``Prague Spring'' of liberal reforms.
Thousands of shocked Czechoslovaks attended his funeral.
   On Sunday, a second protest of up to 3,000 people in front of the
school Palach had attended was also dispersed, activists said.
   Sunday marked the third time in six months that police used force
to break up rallies in central Prague attending banned rallies. The
other demonstrations took place in August and October.
   State television showed brief footage of the rally and read the
statement issued by CTK. Two armored personnel carriers were seen
driving through the streets.
   Communist authorities on Jan. 6 said the rally, intended by
dissidents to be a simple and brief commemorative act, could not be
held.
   But Charter 77 and four other independent groups said they would
go ahead with it anyway. Charter 77 plans a vigil next weekend at
Vsetaty, 18 miles north of Prague, where Palach is buried.
   The body was secretly exhumed in 1973 from Prague's Olsany
cemetery. However, it remains a site of reverence, and on Sunday
dozens of people visited the site, laying flowers or pressing
candles into the soft earth that marks the spot.

<HEAD>Boston Plan To End Forced Busing Runs Into Opposition</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN COOPERMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   All four blacks on Boston's School Committee are
objecting to a plan to end 15 years of court-ordered busing by
letting parents choose the schools their children attend.
   The four say that unless the city commits more funds to improve
its weakest schools, the plan could send them into a tailspin of
declining enrollments, lower budgets and loss of motivated students
and teachers.
   ``This plan is being rushed through just to try to get out from
under the court order,'' committee member Gerald Anderson said
Sunday. ``Without a commitment of funding, it's not going to produce
any real improvement in educational quality.''
   Imposed in 1974 amid fights and rock throwing, forced busing
caused a flight of middle-class students _ both black and white _ to
the suburbs and private schools.
   Boston spends about $7,300 for each of its 55,000 students, one
of the highest per capita figures in the nation, but its dropout
rate has doubled to about 14 percent and white enrollment has
plunged from 60 percent to less than 25 percent, effectively
resegregating the schools.
   ``The reality is, there is virtually no middle class left in the
Boston schools,'' said Ellen Guiney, education adviser to Mayor
Raymond Flynn. ``The overwhelming majority, over 80 percent, is poor
students.''
   ``We have increased the school budget by $113 million over the
last five years, nearly a 50 percent increase and more than double
the rate of inflation,'' said Flynn, a longtime busing foe and chief
backer of the new plan. ``Clearly money, itself, is not the answer.
Giving parents and teachers power at the local level is the
necessary next step.''
   The plan, devised by two of the state's leading minority
educators, would allow parents to choose which schools their
children attend as long as there is space in the classroom and
racial balance is maintained. It aims to stimulate competition among
schools and lure back some of the 25,000 students who have fled.
   The plan, which may start in elementary schools next fall, calls
for failing schools to make changes and replace administrators if no
improvement is shown in two years.
   ``This plan says no child should be locked into a lousy school.
Period,'' said Michael J. Alves, a Hispanic who formerly headed the
state Board of Education's desegregation office and one of the
plan's authors. He devised the proposal with Charles Willie, a black
professor at Harvard University's School of Education.
   Black committee members say the plan does not provide for
bilingual education or special needs students. They also contend
that a clause allowing all students now in special, limited
enrollment magnet schools to remain there would severely restrict
space available in the most desirable schools.
   ``I can't see what the value is of allowing a parent to choose
the child's school when all the available choices are inadequate,''
Anderson said. ``I think the courts have to continue to be involved
until we can offer parents a real choice.''
   Alves said the complexion of the magnet schools would gradually
change as new students enter kindergarten each year.
   The school committee voted 10-1 last month to endorse the plan's
concept. Anderson cast the lone opposing vote, and two other black
committee members abstained.
   The one black who voted in favor, Juanita Wade, and the two who
abstained said they would oppose the plan when it comes up for a
final vote next month unless the mayor provides more funding.

<HEAD>No Relief In Sight For Georgia Prison Overcrowding</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CURT ANDERSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Every week Georgia sets a record for overcrowding
in its prisons, but officials say little relief is in sight despite
three recent outbreaks of violence in packed cellblocks.
   New prisoner totals are tallied each Friday by the state
Department of Corrections. As of Friday, 18,780 inmates were in the
system _ 43 percent over capacity.
   ``We've set a new record every week since the first quarter of
1988,'' said department spokeswoman Kathy Drake. ``We're not
expecting to appreciably reduce the problem this year.''
   Riots erupted this month at overcrowded Milledgeville prisons,
both of which were originally designed to be wards for mental
patients at Central State Hospital.
   In December, prisoners in Hall County rioted at a jail packed
with twice as many inmates as it was intended to hold, many of them
state offenders assigned there because state prisons are full.
   Corrections Commissioner David Evans in a recent speech said it's
easy to cite reasons for overcrowding but difficult to do anything
about it.
   ``We've just got to address the question: Who do we want in
prison? Because it's going to be an expensive operation,'' he said.
   Gov. Joe Frank Harris last week asked the Legislature for $342
million in 1990 for corrections, rejecting the Department of
Corrections' request for $144 million for six new prisons. The 1990
budget request is an increase of $31 million over 1989.
   ``We're real disappointed,'' said Ms. Drake. ``We believe the
need is there, and the need is critical with the present jail
backlog.''
   Harris pointed out that five new prisons and eight probation
detention centers are scheduled to open in Georgia within 18 months,
with space for 3,000 prisoners. But that would make only a modest
dent in the overcrowding problem.
   State Rep. Carlton Colwell, a member of the House State
Institutions and Property Committee, said he expected the governor's
1990 request to be modified, likely with more money aimed at
creating more space for prisoners.
   ``I think we're going to have to come up with something to get
more bed space,'' Colwell said. ``I think we're going to have to
plan on building again this year, just like we have to every year.''
   For local jails, Colwell said legislation is in the works to
provide money that counties could use to build space for prisoners
they house for the state. Such facilities would be adjacent to
county jails but would separate state inmates from local prisoners,
often an explosive mix.
   ``We're trying to get the ones (counties) that have the severe
problems,'' he said. ``We're trying to identify them and start a
pilot program. This would help them get out from under the
overcrowding.''
   Hall County Sheriff Dick Mecum said such a plan, which he
supports, would be a stopgap measure at best. The roots of prison
overcrowding _ sentencing patterns, work release programs, high
levels of urban crime _ remain to be solved, he said.

   Rain dampened eastern parts of the Carolinas and light rain and
snow brushed the Pacific Northwest, but the rest of the country
stayed dry early today.
   Blizzard conditions forced the closure of a 45-mile stretch of
Interstate 84 between La Grande and Baker Sunday afternoon,
stranding hundreds of motorists in the storm-ravaged northeastern
Oregon. The road wasn't expected to reopen before this morning,
State Trooper Stan Terry said.
   Clouds and some fog stretched from eastern Texas to the Atlantic
Coast. Clouds also extended from the central and northern Pacific
Coast across to the Dakotas and the Great Lakes, while clear skies
predominated from Southern California to New Mexico, Colorado and
the central Mississippi Valley.
   Strong winds buffeted the eastern slopes of the Rockies in
Montana and Wyoming, with gusts up to 70 mph recorded in Casper,
Wyo., Sunday evening.
   Today's forecast called for scattered snowshowers from northern
Vermont and New York state across the upper Great Lakes to northern
parts of Minnesota and North Dakota, and in western Montana. Rain
was expected to be widespread in the Pacific Northwest. Fair skies
were forecast for the rest of the nation.
   Highs were expected to be in the 40s or 50s across much of the
nation. Highs were forecast to be in the teens in northeast Nevada;
in the 20s and 30s in much of the Plateau region, from southwest
Wyoming to western Colorado, and from the northern Plains through
the Great Lakes and upper Ohio Valley into New England; in the 60s
from southern California to the desert Southwest, and from northern
Florida to coastal South Carolina, and in the 70s and 80s in the
rest of Florida.
   At 2 a.m. EST, temperatures ranged from 15 degrees below zero at
Hibbing, Minn., to 72 degrees at Key West, Fla.

<TEXT>
   China and Vietnam have begun talks on the
Cambodian conflict in the first face-to-face meeting of high-level
officials from the two countries in more than nine years.
   China's Foreign Ministry said today that First Deputy Foreign
Minister Dinh Nho Liem of Vietnam was in Beijing for ``private
consultations with Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Liu Shuqing on a
political settlement of the Kampuchean (Cambodian) question.''
   Neither China nor Vietnam would offer further details of the
visit, which both sides apparently tried to keep secret.
   Liem's arrival Saturday was not reported by the Chinese media and
his welcoming venue was changed in an apparent effort to evade
foreign journalists who had learned he was on a commercial flight
from Bangkok.
   Eastern European sources said the talks would last at least
several days and cover the timetable for Vietnam's troop withdrawal
from Cambodia and that country's political future.
   Vietnam, which invaded Cambodia in late 1978 to drive the
pro-Chinese Khmer Rouge from power, claims it now has about 50,000
troops in Cambodia and has set September 1989 as a target date for
pulling out all its forces.
   China says previous Vietnamese ``withdrawals'' were mere troop
rotations, but has called the recent announcement of the September
withdrawal a ``step forward.''
   The East European sources, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said discussions of Cambodia's political future will be more
difficult.
   China has called for a coalition government led by resistance
leader Prince Norodom Sihanouk and including both the Vietnam-backed
faction of Heng Samrin and the Khmer Rouge.
   Hanoi wants Heng Samrin to have a major role in any future
coalition government and demands guarantees that Pol Pot and other
Khmer Rouge leaders held responsible for the deaths of hundreds of
thousands of Cambodians during the Khmer Rouge's brutal four-year
rule be barred from positions of power.
   The sources said China also is not interested in discussing a
visit by Vietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach until the vice
minister-level talks achieve positive results.
   China, a staunch ally of Vietnam during the 1960s and 1970s,
launched a 20-day border war against Vietnam in early 1979 to
``punish'' Hanoi for its invasion of Cambodia.
   There have been no direct senior-level talks since, and China has
insisted Vietnam must first pull its troops out of Cambodia before
normal contacts can be resumed.
   China is the main arms supplier of the Khmer Rouge and other
guerrilla forces fighting the Vietnamese.
   China's has said Cambodia is the major obstacle to improved
relations with Vietnam and that Vietnam must withdraw its troops as
soon as possible.
   In August, China opened direct talks on Cambodia with the Soviet
Union, Vietnam's main financial backer, and now says enough progress
has been made to hold the first Sino-Soviet summit in 30 years.
   Previously, China said Moscow's backing of Vietnam's occupation
of Cambodia was the main obstacle to normalization of Sino-Soviet
relations.
   China has also given assurances that it does not support the
return to power of the Khmer Rouge and said it is willing to reduce
its assistance to the Khmer Rouge and other guerrilla forces as
Vietnam pulls out.
   Sihanouk's son, Prince Ranariddh, said last week that China had
agreed to hold direct talks with Vietnam at the urging of the Soviet
Union, which says it favors a Vietnamese pullout.

   Home Box Office swept the cable industry's
10th Annual ACE Awards on the strength of a trio of dramas that
captured 13 of the cable network's 35 awards.
   HBO won four times more awards than its nearest competitor: Arts
&amp; Entertainment, which won eight. The ACE awards were presented
during ceremonies Sunday sponsored by the National Academy of Cable
programming.
   HBO's winning dramas were ``Vietnam War Story,'' ``Mandela'' and
``Tidy Endings.'' In all, HBO had received 114 nominations in the 76
categories for which prizes were given.
   Winning performers included Danny Glover, Alfre Woodard, Stockard
Channing, Rip Torn, Robin Williams, Billy Crystal and Billy Joel.
Lucy Webb received a fourth consecutive ACE as best actress in a
comedy series for HBO's ``Not Necessarily the News.''
   Other winning networks were: CNN five; Bravo Cable Network,
Discovery Channel, ESPN and Showtime four each; Disney Channel
three; Cinemax, Nickelodeon and USA Network two; and Lifetime, Prime
Ticket and SuperStation TBS one each.
   ``Vietnam War Story,'' a 30-minute anthology series, won five
awards out of its 18 nominations, the most of any show. It was named
best dramatic series and Wesley Snipes won as best actor. Other ACEs
in the dramatic series category were for directing, writing and
direction of photography.
   Glover and Miss Woodard were cited as best actor and actress in a
movie or miniseries for their roles as South African black activists
in ``Mandela,'' which got four ACEs in the movie or miniseries
categories. Glover played Nelson Mandela, imprisoned founder of the
African National Congress, and Miss Woodard was his wife, Winnie
Mandela. The drama also won for directing and film editing.
   ``Tidy Endings,'' adapted from Harvey Fierstein's play about
settling the affairs of an AIDS victim by his ex-wife and homosexual
lover, took four awards. It was named best dramatic special and Miss
Channing won as best actress in a dramatic or theatrical special.
Fierstein, her co-star, won an ACE for writing and another went to
the director.
   ``The Race for the Double Helix'' won best movie or miniseries.
Juliet Stevenson also won as best supporting actress in a movie or
miniseries. ``Blackadder the Third'' on A&amp;E Network was named best
comedy series. HBO's ``On Location: Dennis Miller: Mr. Miller Goes
to Washington'' won as best comedy special.
   Pamela Reed won best actress in a dramatic series for HBO's
``Tanner '88.'' Crystal was cited as best actor in a comedy series
for ``HBO Comedy Hour Live: An All-Star Toast to the Improv.''
Jackie Mason won as best writer of a comedy special for HBO's ``On
Location: Jackie Mason on Broadway,'' but lost the best performance
title to Williams for HBO's ``Comic Relief '87.''
   Joel won as best performer in a music special for ``HBO World
Stage: Billy Joel Live from Leningrad.'' The show was named best
music special.
   Daniel Massey won as best actor in a dramatic special for ``HBO
Showcase: Intimate Contact.'' Torn was the winner as best supporting
actor in a movie or miniseries for HBO's ``Laguna Heat.''
   Peter Ustinov received an ACE as best informational or
documentary host for ``Peter Ustinov in China'' on the Discovery
Channel. Roy Firestone was best sports host for ``Sports Look'' on
ESPN. Bernard Shaw of Cable News Network was named best news anchor.
   HBO won the ``Golden Ace,'' the cable industry's highest honor
for its ``high impact'' programming. Its three winning dramas were
cited, as was ``Dear America: Letters Home from Vietnam,'' winner
for documentary special.
   The Governor's Award went to Charles F. Dolan, chairman of
Cablevision Systems Corp., for his contribution to the development
of cable programming.
   Harry Anderson, star of NBC's ``Night Court'' and of cable comedy
specials, was host of the awards presentation, which was carried
live on 10 cable networks.
   Awards in the crafts and technical awards, and in some acting
categories, were made Saturday night.
   The National Academy is a division of the National Cable
Television Association. It was created in 1985 to promote excellence
in cable programming. In September, cable shows and performers were
included in the Emmy awards for the first time. The cable industry
said, however, that it would continue its own awards program.

<HEAD>Officials Seek Federal Aid, Say Shelter is Jammed With Nicaraguans</HEAD>

   A bad situation got worse for local officials coping
with an already jammed emergency shelter as more Central Americans
poured into the city after a Texas judge lifted a travel ban.
   U.S. District Judge Filemon Vela's ruling effectively allowed
renewed waves of thousands of aliens who cross the U.S.-Mexico
border into Texas to travel elsewhere while their claims for
political asylum are being processed.
   A majority of them were Nicaraguans headed to Miami, where a
large alien population and a reputation for helping immigrants has
resulted in a massive influx, including almost 500 since the judge's
decision a week ago, according to local officials. About 2,000 have
come here during the last two months.
   ``It was a crisis before and the decision by the judge in Texas
was totally unreasonable,'' said Dade County Manager Joaquin Avino.
   The judge blocked enforcement of a government policy intended to
curb the backlog of asylum cases in such cities as Miami and Los
Angeles and reduce aslyum requests from those trying to enter the
country for economic reasons.
   Miami officials were quickly dispatched to Texas to assess the
situation and put out the word: Bobby Maduro Miami Stadium, opened
Dec. 15 as a shelter for homeless immigrants, is full.
   Elba Bustos, 65, arrived in downtown Miami late last week after a
31-hour bus trip from Texas with her granddaughter.
   ``I'm so happy to be here because the situation in Nicaragua is
so bad,'' Ms. Bustos said wearily while waiting for her daughter,
whom she hadn't seen in three years, to pick her up.
   At Miami Stadium, Julio Avendano, who fled Nicaragua more than
two years ago, waited patiently for three cousins to arrive from
Texas. He hailed the Texas judge's decision as humane because
immigrants had been sleeping out in the cold there.
   ``When I came, I had no one,'' he said. ``The first few nights I
slept on the street.''
   Avendano's relatives will be able to stay at his apartment. But a
number of immigrants have no family or jobs here and are counting on
assistance from the city when they're forced to leave the ballpark.
   The stadium was packed with some 280 homeless Nicaraguans at last
count, sleeping in locker rooms and underneath bleachers and eating
donated food in a makeshift dining area set up in a dank corridor.
   ``We're booked to capacity,'' Avino said, ``and unless they have
a private place waiting for them, we can't take care of them.''
   Community leaders, meanwhile, worry that the city is being
overwhelmed at a time when Super Bowl preparations are in full
swing, and some 1,500 reporters were expected for the big game.
   ``I hate to say it, but because of the Super Bowl, people's
energies are focused in another direction now,'' said Tom Ferguson,
president of the Beacon Council, a businessmen's group.
   In Tallahassee, Gov. Bob Martinez has called for help from the
federal government to avert the potential impact of another 1980
Mariel boatlift, which saw some 125,000 Cubans arrive in the United
States.
   Central Americans have historically set their sights on Miami,
with its large Hispanic population and hopes that work permits and
jobs are easier to come by. An estimated 100,000 Nicaraguans have
already settled here and there's potential for another 100,000
immigrants in 1989.
   Still, fewer work authorizations are being issued under a
stricter review process implemented by immigration officials.
   A poster taped inside the stadium read: ``We're honest people who
want work. With permission, we can show you.''

<HEAD>Positive Attitude, Exercise May Slow Immune System Destruction</HEAD>

   Positive thinking, exercise, support from
friends and other ways of reducing stress may help AIDS victims slow
the disease's progression, researchers said.
   But some AIDS researchers at the annual meeting of the American
Association for the Advancement of Science cast doubt on the theory.
   ``The jury is still out,'' said Janice Kiecolt-Glaser, a clinical
psychologist at the Ohio State University College of Medicine.
   ``We encourage people (infected with the AIDS virus) to do things
that may be helpful and certainly can't be harmful,'' such as
exercising, getting adequate sleep and nutrition and avoiding drugs
and alcohol, said Dr. Karl Goodkin, a psychiatrist at the University
of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas.
   But he said Sunday undue optimism that a positive outlook might
slow progression of AIDS could spur people infected by acquired
immune deficiency syndrome to blame themselves wrongly when their
condition worsens.
   Within the last decade, studies have shown stress can affect the
development and course of upper respiratory infections,
mononucleosis, herpes simplex, rheumatoid arthritis and skin, breast
and cervical cancer.
   In that light, Dr. Ronald Glaser, chairman of immunology at the
Ohio State medical college, said it's not surprising to theorize
that psychological factors may play a role in the progression of
symptom-free AIDS infection to AIDS-related complex to fully
developed AIDS.
   Blood and psychological tests on 18 AIDS patients found that
those who exercised, were assertive and had lower levels of tension,
depression, fatigue, stress and anger also tended to have higher
numbers of disease-fighting immune system cells, according to a
study by Lydia Temoshok, a psychologist at the University of
California, San Francisco, and George Solomon, a UCLA psychiatry
professor.
   AIDS cripples the immune system, leaving people susceptible to
fatal infections and cancer.
   University of Miami psychologist Michael Antoni measured various
signs of psychological and immune system functioning among 39
symptom-free homosexual males at various times before and after
tests revealed if they were infected by the AIDS virus. Some of the
men had been participating in a 10-week aerobic exercise program
while others had not.
   Among those who turned out to be AIDS-infected, the exercisers
had higher levels of certain immune system white blood cells. Men
who were better at venting their emotions and seeking social support
also had better signs of immune system performance, Antoni said.
   And compared with non-exercisers, the exercise group suffered
less depression, anxiety, confusion and bewilderment after learning
they were infected.
   Goodkin studied 40 homosexual men _ 13 who were healthy, 10 who
were AIDS-infected but symptom-free, four who had AIDS-related
complex and 13 who suffered fully developed AIDS.
   ``The results showed that those who had the virus but had not
progressed to AIDS had less stress in their lives, more social
support and had a more confident coping style that either the
non-infected group or the group that had progressed to AIDS or
ARC,'' the University of Texas said in a news release.
   Goodkin said his findings suggest AIDS-infected people might
benefit from exercise, relaxation training, participation in support
groups, and psychotherapy that emphasizes positive thinking to
reduce anxiety and depression.
   ``It may even help to get infected patients to deny to some
extent the idea of their eventual disability and death,'' he said.
   Many follow that philosophy. Every week, about 800 Los
Angeles-area people infected with AIDS have crowded into seminars
conducted by controversial AIDS counselor Louise Hay, who preaches
that ``love is the most powerful stimulant to the immune system.''

   Operators using a newly-installed system
may have given the wrong signal to two trains that crashed head-on,
killing at least 110 people and injuring 1,000 in the country's
worst rail accident, officials said.
   About 40 people remained in critical condition today, according
to one hospital official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, and
the government declared a day of mourning.
   The 10-car express train and seven-car mail train slammed into
each other Sunday outside the farming village of Maizdi Khan,
sending cars tumbling and tossing passengers into freshly-harvested
rice paddies.
   The express train was traveling at about 50 mph, the mail train
coming to a halt, authorities said.
   Communications Secretary Mazurul Karim estimated that more than
2,000 people were aboard the trains, many of them Moslem pilgrims.
He said, however, that people routinely ride between the cars and on
the roofs, making a precise count difficult.
   Rescue workers using two large cranes to pull apart the crumbled
wreckage finished the search for victims early today and reopened
the track. Karim said no bodies were found inside.
   Shortly after the accident, senior officials of the state-run
railroad said they suspected operators may not have known how to
properly work a sophisticated digital signaling system installed
five days earlier.
   ``Human failure and wrong signaling may have caused the two
trains to come on the same track, leading to the collision,'' said
one official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Dhaka newspapers on Monday blamed the accident on human error.
   The Sangbad, an independent Bengali-language daily, quoted
unidentified railway officials as saying the express train ignored a
signal to stop and allow the mail train to pass. Another
Bengali-language daily, the Khabar, quoted witnesses as saying
either the wrong signal or no signal failed to keep the two trains
off the same track.
   But Communications Minister Anwar Hossain disputed their
suspicions, saying more than 200 trains had traveled on the track
since the system was installed Tuesday. The track on which the crash
occurred shares north- and southbound traffic, so trains often must
wait on sidings for trains going in the opposite direction to pass.
   The government appointed a commission to investigate the
collision and ordered that the panel's findings be ready within two
weeks.
   Soldiers, fire officials and villagers pulled at least 100 bodies
from the trains on Sunday, and another 10 people died at hospitals,
police and railway officials said.
   At the scene, sobbing relatives tried to look for loved ones
among rows of bodies laid alongside the single track, but were held
back by police.
   ``Oh, God! Bring brother back!'' cried Sunil Daniel, pressing his
arms against his chest.
   Hundreds of injured were taken to hospitals at Tongi, five miles
to the north, and to the capital, Dhaka, 22 miles to the south.
   The government offered $3,125 as compensation to relatives of the
dead and $2,560 to each of the injured.
   The express train was headed north from Dhaka to Tongi, then
southeast to Chittagong. The mail train, bound for Dhaka, had just
stopped in Tongi.
   Officials said many involved in the crash were pilgrims traveling
to Tongi, where hundreds of thousands of Moslems have gathered for
Biswa Ejtema, or World Congregation, Islam's largest gathering after
the Haj in Mecca.
   Many involved in the crash were pilgrims traveling to Tongi,
where hundreds of thousands of Moslems have gathered for Biswa
Ejtema, or world congregation, Islam's second largest pilgrimage
after the Haj in Mecca, Saudi Arabia.
   ``It was a big jolt and minutes later I found myself trapped
inside a tilted coach,'' said Kohinoor Begum, 40, as she waited for
treatment at Dhaka's Pangu Hospital for cuts.
   Prior to Sunday, the worst train crash in Bangladesh occurred on
Jan. 26, 1981, near northern Chuadanga, and killed at least 75
people.
   According to government statistics, at least 2,537 train
accidents have occurred in Bangladesh in the past 15 years, killing
at least 883 people and injuring more than 7,000.

   He was unable to swim, so 15-year-old
Leopoldo Castillo spent his last $50 to rent an inner tube on which
he floated across the Rio Grande to the United States.
   ``I arrived with nothing, with nothing,'' said Castillo, who fled
Nicaragua in December to avoid being drafted into the military.
   He's among the hundreds of Central Americans who arrive seeking
temporary shelter and, eventually, a permanent home in this country.
   Like Castillo, they bring little with them but their clothes.
   And like Castillo, they're often still damp from crossing the Rio
Grande.
   Despite their lack of belongings and uncertain futures, Sister
Juliana Garcia of Casa Oscar Romero _ where many of them, including
Castillo, stay _ said:
   ``They have a lot of hope and where there is hope, there is joy,
too.''
   Brownsville and Casa Romero, a no-frills barracks five miles from
the border, are stops on a swelling migration route through southern
Texas, which the Immigration and Naturalization Service says was
followed last year by more than 30,000 Central Americans seeking
political asylum in the United States.
   However, the INS maintains many simply want jobs and are not
fleeing persecution.
   Like most, Castillo is bound for points beyond Texas. Many are
waiting for relatives in Florida to send money for bus tickets to
Miami _ one of the most common destinations for asylum seekers.
   Most stay about two weeks at the refuge, said Sister Juliana.
   The cinder block buildings have separate quarters for men and
women and, since the refuge's neighbors filed suit in a bid to have
it shut down, are limited by court order to no more than 200
residents.
   Demand for shelter reached a crisis in December, after the INS
adopted a policy to keep immigrants in southern Texas while their
cases were being decided. Homeless Central Americans no longer able
to travel to their U.S. destinations took shelter in primitive
campsites and condemned buildings.
   The largest, most squalid campsite was across the street from
Casa Romero.
   The crisis eased last week when a judge blocked the INS travel
restriction pending a Jan. 31 hearing on the policy, freeing aliens
to leave southern Texas.
   Hundreds, and perhaps thousands, did. For the first time in
weeks, Casa Romero had vacancies.
   But Central Americans continue to flow into Brownsville, creating
concern among city officials.
   City Manager Steve Fitzgibbons on Friday joined Florida officials
in criticizing the federal government for failing to help local
governments handle the burden of a booming alien population.
   ``I have no reason to believe the people of Central America will
stop coming through here,'' Fitzgibbons said.
   While many of Brownsville's estimated 100,000 residents donate
food and clothing to the aliens, others worry about the changes to
their city.
   And opponents of Casa Romero say it only encourages illegal
immigration.
   The Catholic church started Casa Romero in 1982 at San Benito,
about 20 miles north of Brownsville. After people there objected,
church leaders built the new Casa Romero in Brownsville in 1987. The
shelter is named after the Rev. Oscar Romero, Roman Catholic
archbishop of El Salvador who was slain in 1980.

   The wife of slain Egyptian President
Anwar Sadat made an unannounced appearance at a fund-raiser honoring
talk show host Johnny Carson, praising the comedian and calling for
peace.
   Jihan Sadat praised Carson as ``an American who is a household
name throughout the world, a man who has humorously chided us for
our shortcomings and brought laughter into our lives.''
   The star-studded dinner Sunday night also was held to raise money
for scholarships in Carson's name to Hebrew University of Jerusalem,
publicist Lee Solters said.
   ``Our goal must be books and brotherhood. We must pledge that
there will be no more war, widows and no more war orphans and no
more war veterans,'' said Mrs. Sadat, a longtime supporter of the
university. ``We can carry out that pledge through higher education,
for knowledge is a giant step toward understanding, and
understanding leads to peace.''
   Carson, host of NBC-TV's ``The Tonight Show'' for 26 years, was
named recipient of Hebrew University's Scopus Award for his
humanitarian efforts and excellence in his chosen profession.
   He told the audience that a large telescope was being built in
Hawaii and quipped: ``Even with that telescope, I still wouldn't be
able to see why Hebrew University is honoring this gentile.''
   But he added: ``When I heard that more than 1,000 scholarships
would come from this evening, I knew this was something I wanted to
be a part of.''
   Singer Steve Lawrence served as the master of ceremonies at the
Beverly Hilton Hotel. Guests included Carson's longtime sidekick, Ed
McMahon; Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley; actors Gregory Peck, Sidney
Poitier and actress Carol Channing; comedians George Burns, Don
Rickles, Bob Newhart and Danny Thomas; NBC-TV Entertainment
President Brandon Tartikoff and singer Julio Iglesias.

   Witnesses on the ground said they saw
flames spouting from an engine of an American Airlines jet that was
forced to land minutes after takeoff with 91 people aboard.
   Dallas-bound Flight 201 took off from Baltimore-Washington
International Airport at 7:53 a.m. Sunday and returned shortly after
8 a.m., said American Airlines spokeswoman Susie Robbins. The 85
passengers and six crew members were unharmed, she said.
   ``I heard this sound kind of like a cannon going off seven or
eight times, real quick,'' said John Entwistle, who lives two miles
from the runway the plane used. `` ... I saw fire coming from the
left rear engine, with a lot of sparks coming out.''
   ``You saw this big cloud of black smoke coming out,'' said Dennis
Burford. ``When it went by, you saw all that fire coming out of the
left side of the plane.''
   A piece of the left engine apparently came loose and a compressor
stalled in the engine, prompting the pilot to shut down that engine,
Ms. Robbins said.
   ``We believe something, ice, birds, was ingested into the engine
on takeoff,'' she said. ``The tower reported flames coming from the
engine, which happens a lot when something is ingested.''
   But FAA spokesman Fred Farrar said late Sunday afternoon that a
foreign object being sucked into the engine would not have caused
the malfunction known as compressor stall which the pilot reported
as he throttled up the McDonnell Douglas MD-80 jetliner.
   Stalls can result from ``a disruption of air going into the
engine,'' Farrar said, and are often caused by the attitude of the
plane on takeoff, with wing position or abrupt changes in wind speed
or direction altering air flow to the engine intakes.
   Ms. Robbins said American Airlines crews in Baltimore were
replacing the left engine Sunday.
   Passengers transferred to other flights to reach their
destinations, she said.

   Two gunmen killed a former reserve
policeman with Northern Ireland's Royal Ulster Constabulary in front
of his girlfriend, police said today.
   Harry Keyes, 25, was shot Sunday evening as he was backing out of
the driveway of his girlfriend's house in Ballintra in western
Ireland, eight miles from the border with Northern Ireland, police
said.
   Police did not name Keyes' friend, but said she was not hurt.
   There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the shooting.
But suspicion fell on the outlawed Irish Republican Army, which
targets police and army personnel in its fight to oust the British
from Northern Ireland.
   Also Sunday, Irish police uncovered a cache of arms and
ammunition hidden in a 40-gallon plastic drum beside a river near
Kilkenny, 70 miles south of Dublin, the spokesman said. Soviet-made
rifles, magazines and 1,400 rounds of ammunition were seized.
   A man is being held for questioning in connection with the arms,
the spokesman said.

   Rival Moslem factions fought with grenades
and machine guns today in the city's southern slums in another
battle for control of Shiite strongholds, killing two people and
wounding five, police said.
   Syrian troops handling security in Beirut's Moslem sectors
arranged a cease-fire late this morning to stem the fighting, the
third clash in 24 hours, police said.
   The two militias have been locked in a power struggle for
leadership of Lebanon's 1 million Shiites, the country's largest
sect, since April. More than 500 people have been killed and 1,500
wounded in the clashes.
   The Syrian-backed Amal militia and the pro-Iranian Hezbollah
battled with rocket-propelled grenades and machine guns for two
hours before dawn today in the Ghobeiri, Shiyah and Bourj
el-Barajneh districts, police said.
   Today's casualties raised the overall toll since Dec. 31, when
the two factions renewed fighting in Beirut and south Lebanon, to at
least 168 killed and 315 wounded.
   The fundamentalist Hezbollah seeks to create an Iranian-style
Islamic republic in Lebanon. The more secular, nationalist Amal
resents Iran's influence in Lebanon and has been fighting to drive
Hezbollah out of Beirut's southern slums and south Lebanon.

   U.S. Ambassador Edward Perkins
today unveiled a bronze bust of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and
said the slain black American's non-violent civil rights movement
held some lessons for South Africa.
   Perkins told reporters he did not ``tend to equate'' South Africa
and the United States, ``but searching for non-violent solutions is
probably something worth thinking about'' in South Africa.
   Perkins, the first black U.S. ambassador to South Africa, and
Zenos Frudakis, the Philadelphia sculptor who made the bust,
unveiled the work under a tent on a bushy plot where a new U.S.
Embassy is to be built.
   The 125 onlookers at the gathering in Pretoria included black and
white South Africans prominent in campaigns against the apartheid
system of legalized race segregation, and a low-level representative
from the South African Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
   A 30-member choir from the Roman Catholic church of St. Peter
Claver in Mamelodi, a black township near Pretoria, sang several
civil rights hymns. Women in red headscarves and conical hats woven
from grass mingled with dark-suited diplomats.
   One hymn was ``Senatla Martin Luther King.'' Senatla means leader
in the Sotho language.
   Enos Mabuza, chief minister of South Africa's KaNgwane black
homeland, told the gathering there were striking parallels between
the racial separation in South African today and segregation in the
United States during King's lifetime. A major difference, he said,
was that the U.S. Constitution protects individual rights but South
African laws ``protect white privilege and white-minority rule.''
   Mabuza said ``the black people in this country have realized that
the oppressor will never voluntarily give freedom to the oppressed.
The oppressed must demand that freedom.''
   Today was a federal holiday in the United States honoring King,
who was assassinated in 1968. The civil rights leader would have
been 60 years old on Sunday.

   Israeli troops today shot and killed a
17-year-old Palestinian during a clash with youths in the West Bank,
and another teen-ager died of gunshot wounds suffered earlier,
military officials said.
   Troops elsewhere in the occupied lands forced the midnight burial
of two Palestinians slain last week and limited the number of
relatives allowed to attend, an Arab reporter said. The move
apparently was designed to prevent unrest.
   Today's deaths increased to 359 the number of Palestinians who
have died since the uprising in the occupied territories began 13
months ago. Fifteen Israelis have been killed.
   The high rate of casualties _ eight in the past four days _
brought complaints about army policies from Israeli politicians from
the left and right.
   Minister-without-Portfolio Ehud Olmert, a member of the
right-wing Likud bloc who has charge of Arab affairs, said today
every Arab death caused him personal anguish. Both Israel and the
Palestinians are paying a high price for putting down the uprising,
he said on Israel Radio.
   Olmert said he favored tough measures against rioters, but did
not understand the army's policy for opening fire.
   ``I don't think there's a lot of logic or common sense in
shooting after a boy when he's already finished throwing his stone
and is running away,'' he said. ``There must be some judgment and
some restraint.''
   On Sunday, Olmert and Justice Minister Dan Meridor accused
soldiers of having ``too light a finger on the trigger,'' The Nation
and Hadashot newspapers reported.
   Hospital officials identified the Palestinian killed today in
Hebron as Radwan Sbeih. Arab reporters said he was shot in the chest
when youths stoned soldiers and the troops responded with fire.
   A military spokesman, who was not identified according to
regulations, confirmed the death and said another 17-year-old
Palestinian, Ahmed Mustafa of the Khan Yunis camp in the occupied
Gaza Strip, died today after being shot in the head Saturday.
   At least seven youths were wounded today in clashes, including
four from the Hebron area and three in Bureij camp in Gaza, Arab
reporters and hospital officials said. Military sources confirmed
two people were wounded in Hebron, but had no reports of wounded
from Gaza.
   Masked youths ordered Hebron merchants to closed their stores
after the shootings. The youths, activists in the uprising, called
for a three-day strike to mourn those killed.
   Reports of the recent casualties spurred Energy Minister Moshe
Shahal of the Labor Party to demand a report from the army on its
use of plastic bullets. The bullets were introduced to reduce the
fatality rate but critics complain that they are doing the opposite.
   In the Gaza Strip, the army forced families to bury a 12-year-old
girl and a 17-year-old man at midnight and limited the number of
relatives attending to 15, an Arab reporter said. The Arab reporters
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The 12-year-old girl, Hanadi Sultan, died in Tel Hashomer
Hospital near Tel Aviv where she was flown for treatment after being
shot in the head during a Jan. 10 protest. The 17-year-old, Ziad
Ahmed Radwan, was wounded in Rafah Saturday and died Sunday.

<TEXT>
   A professor who was held hostage in
Beirut for 20 months returned home and predicted that other American
hostages would soon follow.
   Mithileshwar Singh, who was released by his Islamic Jihad captors
last Oct. 3, arrived Sunday night at his home here, which was
festooned with yellow ribbons and ``Welcome home'' signs. About 20
neighbors, some in tears, were there to greet Singh and his wife,
Lala Mani.
   Singh, 61, has undergone medical treatment in the New York City
area since his release. His diabetes was aggravated during his
captivity and he suffers from other health problems, according to
John Curtis, a family friend in Grand Junction.
   Sunday night, Singh said he feels ``very good'' but added that he
didn't expect to return to full health for months.
   Singh said he believed that President-elect George Bush and
Secretary of State-designate James Baker would be ``more flexible on
hostage releases'' than their predecessors.
   ``I think they will be more willing to negotiate and discuss the
issues, because some kind of dialogue should be initiated by our
government,'' he said.
   He also predicted that the remaining American hostages in Lebanon
might be released this week to coincide with Bush's inauguration,
much as Americans held hostage in Iran were released the day that
Ronald Reagan was sworn in as president in 1981.
   ``I do feel that something should happen by the date of
inauguration,'' Singh said. ``I do not really know, it is my faith.''
   Singh, a citizen of India who became a resident alien in the
United States in 1965, was chairman of the business department at
the American University of Beirut when he was abducted on Jan. 24,
1987.
   Singh had taught for 10 years at the University of Western
Colorado prior to his move to Beirut, and he and his wife own their
house in Grand Junction.
   ``When I was in captivity, I thought all the time of coming
home,'' Singh said after his arrival at Walker Field. ``Grand
Junction is my hometown, I consider, and Colorado is my home state.''

   Plainclothes police blocked an opposition
news conference today by turning away journalists.
   The police said they came to prevent opposition leader Leszek
Moczulski from ``committing a crime.'' They wrote down names of the
journalists as they arrived at Moszulski's home in Warsaw and asked
them to leave.
   Moczulski, leader of the Confederation for Independent Poland or
KPN, scheduled the news conference to discuss the group's national

   The group claims 1,600 members and represents the nationalist,
conservative wing of the opposition.

   Damaged power lines halted or delayed hundreds of
high-speed trains today and inconvenienced about 330,000 passengers,
railway officials said.
   An official said about 1,625 feet of the overhead cable that
supplies power to the trains was found loosened, probably damaged by
a train that broke seven of its eight trolley arms before coming to
a stop near Kobe in western Japan. As a result, 59 trains were
canceled and another 275 were delayed, some for nearly eight hours,
he said.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said no
passengers were on the damaged train, but that about 330,000
passengers, including many vacationers taking advantage of a
three-day weekend, were delayed.
   Normal train service resumed after about eight hours, the
official said.
   On Sunday, 174 passengers aboard an express train were stuck for
nearly three hours inside the Seikan Tunnel _ the world's longest
undersea tunnel _ after their train developed engine trouble.
   The train was traveling on a slope when it stopped and slowly
rolled back to an undersea station, where it waited until two
engines arrived to pull it out of the tunnel.
   The 33-mile-long tunnel connects the northern Japanese island of
Hokkaido to the main island of Honshu.

<TEXT>
   President-elect Bush, in a glowing tribute to
the late Dr. Martin Luther King, today pledged that as president
that he will work to fulfill King's dreams of racial equality.
   Bush called the late civil rights leader an American hero,
saying, ``He lived a hero's life. He dreamed a hero's dreams. He
left a hero's indelible mark on the mind and imagination of a great
nation.''
   In an address to a breakfast of the American Bicentennial
Presidential Inaugural Afro-American Committee, Bush added, ``We
pledge once more our nation's sacred honor in pursuit of his
dreams.''
   Noting he will be sworn in as president on Friday, Bush signaled
to black Americans that he will be sensitive to their concerns.
   ``What becomes of Martin Luther King's dreams is up to us,'' he
said. ``We must not fail him. We must not fail ourselves. We must
not fail the nation he loved so much and gave his life for.
   ``I understand that five days before coming president of the
United States of America,'' Bush added to applause from the
gathering of some 300 black leaders.
   And Bush also cautioned that Americans must remember not only the
goals of King but ``why these were dreams and not reality.''
   ``Remember the moral stain of segregation, the lies it taught and
the anguish it inflicted on the lives of black Americans and on the
conscience of the entire American people,'' Bush said.
   Bush said that he will work to ensure ``that bigotry and
indifference to the disadvantaged will find no safe home on our
shores,'' and that King's dreams for the children of America will be
fulfilled. ``This must be our mission together. It will, I promise,
be my mission as president of the United States.''
   Bush as vice president was part of the Reagan administration that
has been criticized for its civil rights record and what black
leaders have said is indifference to their cause.
   Bush, however, has made a concerted effort to show minorities
that his will be a much more activist presidency in terms of
minority needs.
   President Reagan, who has questioned the motives of some civil
rights leaders during his eight years in office, had proclaimed the
King holiday on Dec. 23 in a statement that said the civil rights
leader's ``work is not done, but neither is his witness stilled.''
   Reagan, who initially opposed the holiday, signed the legislation
creating into law in 1985 and made videotaped tributes to King in
past years. He had no public appearances on his schedule today.
   Bush returned home Sunday after a three-day fishing trip to the
Florida Keys.
   He caught seven varieties of fish Saturday, but failed to repeat
his feat Friday of pulling in a 13-pound bonefish, just three pounds
off the world record for the hard-fighting specimen.
   One of his fishing partners, Fred Zeder, a former ambassador to
Micronesia, snagged a seagull while casting and had to reel the bird
in like a kite to unhook it and let it fly away.
   Bush made good on his promise to reporters Friday that he would
make no news during his latest visit to the Keys, his fifth as vice
president. It was also his third vacation since the Nov. 8 election.
   He turned aside a question Sunday about Miami's problems in
coping with an influx of Nicaraguan refugees. On Friday he had
blamed the problem on ``tyranny'' in the Sandinista state and said
Texas and Florida communities overburdened with refugees do need
help.
   On Saturday, during nearly 10 hours of fishing from a skiff on
the bay side of the Keys, Bush caught and threw back about 25 fish,
including a two-foot shark, snapper, ladyfish, jack, perch, trout
and catfish.
   Bush stayed in a private condominium in Islamorada overlooking
the bay waters, while his press and Secret Service entourage was
housed at a nearby resort.

<TEXT>
   Conductor Daniel Barenboim, fired as musical and
artistic director of the new Paris opera house in a scandal of
operatic dimensions, said today his dismissal should come from the
president of France.
   ``It is for him to choose between my presence and that of the
international artistic community I have gathered and the program of
the president of a couture house,'' Barenboim said at a news
conference.
   Pierre Berge, chairman of the board of the Opera-Bastille and
president of the Yves Saint-Laurent fashion house, dismissed
Barenboim on Friday, saying he was demanding too much money.
   However, Barenboim said today he was not prepared to abandon his
duties.
   Berge, responding on French television, said he would not bring
the name of President Francois Mitterrand into the dispute because,
``it would become a political affair .... It is an affair of big
bucks.''
   Berge maintains Barenboim's 7-million franc ($1.1-million) annual
salary over four years is too much money for the four months a year
the 46-year-old Israeli conductor would spend in Paris. Berge says
the opera house made a counter-proposal of 4 million francs
($628,570) a year over two years, but that it was rejected.
   Barenboim's firing prompted threats from Patrice Chereau,
director of the Opera-Bastille's first production, to leave, and a
host of world-class performers _ including Pierre Boulez, Jessye
Norman, Herbert von Karajan and Sir Georg Solti _ sent a petition to
Culture Minister Jack Lang saying they might cancel their
performances.
   ``If Daniel Barenboim is not maintained as artistic and musical
director, we regret to inform you that the conditions of our
participation in this project are also subject to question,'' the
petition read.
   Boulez announced Sunday he would resign his post as vice
president of the Association of Theaters of the Opera of Paris,
headed by Berge, which helped to get the Opera-Bastille project off
the ground.
   ``I find (people) have acted in a completely inconsistent manner
and now there is the most total lunacy,'' he told Radio Monte Carlo.
   In an interview published Sunday in the Paris weekly Le Journal
du Dimanche, Berge said he was only 80 percent sure the opera house
could open Jan. 10, 1990 as scheduled.
   He contended the contract dispute is based on a preliminary
agreement signed in haste before the May elections that Chirac's
conservatives lost and claims the agreement gives Barenboim too much
power.
   ``The government of Jacques Chirac, totally opposed to the
Opera-Bastille, wanted to destroy it,'' Berge was quoted as saying,
``but finally decided to keep it and, in haste, put the cart before
the horse.''
   After the Socialist government of Premier Michel Rocard took
office, the opera house made a counterproposal to Barenboim of about
half the salary over two years, but it was rejected, Berge said.
   Barenboim has said the matter would be settled in court.
   Chereau, speaking on French television Sunday, said he would not
participate if Barenboim does not. Chereau is staging the opening
performance, Mozart's ``Don Giovanni,'' and is committed to two
other productions.
   The Opera-Bastille is a multimillion-dollar complex on the Place
de la Bastille, site of the prison whose storming launched the
French Revolution. The new opera house is meant to replace the
ornate Palais Garnier, best known as the Paris Opera, which will be
reserved for dance.
   Berge said the house, in keeping with its mission of bringing
opera to the people, should provide 220 performances a year, instead
of the 150 envisaged by Barenboim.

   The threat came in a telephone call to the airline's reservation
office in Tokyo at 3:15 p.m., about one hour after Flight 8 had
taken off from Tokyo's Narita airport, said a Transport Ministry
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The official quoted the anonymous caller as saying in Japanese,
``A plastic bomb was planted on board the plane. It is set to
explode at 4 p.m.''
   He said the Boeing 747 was over the Sea of Japan when the threat
came. It landed safely at the New Chitose airport on Japan's
northernmost island of Hokkaido at 5:37 p.m., the official said.
   A Chitose airport official said authorities were searching the
plane but had found no explosives.
   Many airlines operating in Asia have stepped up security
precautions following intelligence reports that an identified Far
Eastern carrier has been targeted for a possible hijack or bomb
attack in January. The intelligence reports followed the bombing of
a Pan Am jetliner Dec. 21 that killed 270 people.

<HEAD>Black Officer Claims Police Abuse in Long Beach</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONG BEACH, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A black police sergeant whose head was
shoved through a window by a white officer says he was conducting a
self-styled ``sting'' operation aimed at uncovering police racism.
   The encounter was secretly recorded by a camera and sound
equipment mounted inside Sgt. Don Jackson's rental car and by other
cameras filming from an unmarked KNBC-TV news van and car following
at a distance.
   Portions of the encounter, which occurred late Saturday night,
were broadcast Sunday by KNBC, and additional excerpts were aired
today on NBC's ``The Today Show.''
   Jackson, 30, is on stress disability leave from his job in nearby
Hawthorne. He insisted that he and driver Jeff Hill, an off-duty
state corrections officer, did nothing illegal to provoke police.
   ``You merely have to be black in the wrong neighborhood, or even
... the right neighborhood,'' Jackson said. ``We were there five
minutes. We had just gotten off the freeway.''
   Jackson, who belongs to a group called the Police Misconduct
Lawyer Referral Service, said he arranged the sting after hearing
reports of racism in Long Beach. He added that it was ``fully in
commemoration of the efforts of Martin Luther King,'' whose 60th
birthday would have been Sunday.
   Jackson and Hill were stopped by Officers Mark Dickey and Mark
Ramsey as they drove on Pacific Coast Highway at Martin Luther King
Boulevard. The officers claimed the 1977 Buick was straddling lanes,
Jackson said.
   ``I was wearing mechanics coveralls and had intentionally smeared
grease on my hands and face to look like I had just crawled out from
under a car,'' Jackson said. ``I looked dirty and I wasn't driving a
nice car, so I guess he (the police officer) figured they could do
whatever they wanted.''
   Segments of the tape showed the car never strayed over the center
line. The tape showed an officer using profanity during a verbal
exchange with Jackson, who initially refused an order to raise his
hands above his head. When he finally did, the tape clearly showed
the white officer ramming Jackson's head through a storefront window.
   A Long Beach police spokesman, Lt. Mike Hill, denied that Dickey,
who needed six stitches for a gash to his hand, pushed Jackson's
head through the storefront. However, Hill said police are
investigating the allegations.
   Long Beach Mayor Ernie Kell said the arresting officer should be
fired if an investigation determines he used excessive force.
   ``We do not want police officers running amok in the city of Long
Beach,'' he said.
   Police booked Jackson for investigation of interfering with
police and challenging a police officer. They set his bail at
$12,000, then reduced it to $250 and finally released him on his own
recognizance more than six hours later.
   Hill was issued a traffic citation at the scene and released.
   Jackson was involved in a controversy last February when he went
to Los Angeles' trendy Westwood Village with a group of black
youths. He was arrested after allegedly refusing an officer's
request to move along.

   Guerrillas fired six rockets into Kabul
today, killing four people and injuring nine in a residential area,
officials said. It was the first reported rocket attack on the
Afghan capital in nearly three weeks.
   Western diplomats in embassies near the road leading to the
airport said they heard eight rockets land. It was the first
reported rocket attack since Dec. 27 by Moslem guerrillas who have
advanced in the hills ringing Kabul as Soviet troops pull out ahead
of a Feb. 15 deadline.
   The Interior Ministry of the Soviet-backed Afghan administration
said the rockets landed in the city's Qalyszman district, an area of
mainly mud houses.
   Casualties included women and children, the ministry said without
elaboration.
   The guerrillas apparently suspended rocket attacks on Kabul
during the Soviet withdrawal, but have stepped up attacks on supply
convoys into the capital.
   On Sunday, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze ended a
three-day visit to Afghanistan with a pledge to supply arms to
President Najib after the withdrawal of the remaining 50,000 Soviet
troops in Afghanistan.
   Shevardnadze implied the withdrawal would go ahead as scheduled,
saying the Soviet Union believes Najib's army can cope on its own.
   In Islamabad, the Pakistan- and U.S.-backed guerrillas told a
guerrilla news agency they have overrun two key government military
posts in Afghanistan's border areas but allowed 200 food trucks
through to the embattled capital.
   Combined resistance sources said the military posts were captured
in the past week and put the guerrillas within three miles of the
government-held eastern city of Jalalabad, 42 miles from the
Pakistan border.
   There was no independent confirmation of the guerrilla news
agency's report.
   Insurgents captured six tanks and 3,000 weapons, the agency
claimed. Other guerrilla sources claimed 600 Afghan army and
militiamen surrendered.
   Guerrillas also claimed they have stepped up attacks near
southeastern Kandahar city, the western city of Herat and in
northern provinces bordering the Soviet Union.
   The guerrilla news agency said guerrillas allowed about 200 food
trucks through to Kabul last week to relieve shortages of
commodities and fuel. In Kabul, however, reports say guerrillas
still are attacking food convoys on a strategic highway. Few
supplies are getting through.
   Lines for fuel and foodstuffs start in the early morning in
Kabul, where prices are rising rapidly and power blackouts last
several hours each day.
   The Soviets intervened in Afghanistan nearly in December 1979 to
aid the Soviet-allied government. They later had more than 100,000
troops in Afghanistan. About half the Soviet troops already have
left under a U.N.-brokered Geneva accords.
   Moscow has been insisting members of Kabul's current Marxist
regime have a role in a postwar government, but the guerrillas say
they will not share power with former foes.
   The insurgents say they are confident of a military victory and
on Jan. 6 broke off direct talks with the Soviet Union on
Afghanistan's political future.

   A former prime minister believed to be
kidnapped, possibly by a terrorist group, was threatened before he
disappeared, Prime Minister Wilfried Martens said today.
   A caller claiming to represent a previously unknown group, the
Revolutionary Socialist Brigade, has said the organization abducted
former Prime Minister Paul Vanden Boeynants.
   Officials said they were handling the case of the 69-year-old
Christian Democrat, who disappeared Saturday, as a kidnapping.
   ``Mr. Vanden Boeynants had received threats lately and had
requested to meet with the interior minister,'' presumably to
discuss his safety, Martens said on Belgium's Dutch-langage radio
network, BRT. He did not elaborate.
   Interior Minister Louis Tobback confirmed he had been due to meet
with Vanden Boeynants today. He said Vanden Boeynants' secretary
called his office Thursday to say her boss wanted to discuss ``a
personal matter.''
   However, Deputy Brussels Prosecutor Andre Vandoren told
reporters, ``We have no elements to say a direct link can be
established between the threats to Mr. Vanden Boeynants'' and his
disappearance.
   He said he was treating the disappearance as a kidnapping,
possibly for political reasons.
   However, Johan Vande Lanotte, an aide to Tobback, said in a
statement: ``So far, the case is a strictly judicial matter. There
is nothing to indicate that a truly terrorist act or politically
inspired action is involved.''
   Three anonymous phone calls have been received claiming
responsibility for Vanden Boeynants' disappearance. One was made
Saturday to the daily newspaper Le Soir and the others were received
Sunday by RTBF, Belgium's French-language radio network.
   The calls Sunday to RTBF claimed responsibility for the former
prime minister's kidnapping in the name of the Revolutionary
Socialist Brigade, an unknown group.
   The claim made to Le Soir was unclear. The paper said Monday the
caller spoke to a night watchman on behalf of a group of
``revolutionary socialists.''
   Vanden Boeynants arrived home by car at about 6 p.m. Saturday but
never entered his residence, officials said. They said police found
his hearing aid, pipe and one of his shoes in his garage.
   Vanden Boeynants entered Parliament in 1949 and served as prime
minister between 1966 and 1968, and again for several months in late
1978 and early 1979. He also served several times as defense
minister in the 1970s.
   In 1986, he received a three-year suspended sentence for tax
evasion, forgery and fraud as head of a Brussels meat-packing
company.

   The No. 2 job at the Pentagon will go to Donald
Atwood Jr., vice chairman of General Motors Corp., sources in
President-elect Bush's transition operation said today.
   Atwood, 63, is the top choice of Defense Secretary-designate John
Tower to be deputy secretary of defense.
   Transition officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity,
said Atwood's selection would be announced Tuesday.
   GM spokesman Jim Crellin said today in Detroit that Atwood was
unavailable for comment.
   ``Mr. Atwood is aware he's on a list of candidates for a position
of deputy secretary of defense,'' Crellin said. ``He does not feel
that it would be appropriate to comment on the matter until a final
decision.''
   The likelihood that Atwood would be selected was first reported
by The New York Times.
   The newspaper said Sunday that Atwood was at the top of a list of
contenders that included William Paul, senior vice president for
defense and space systems at United Technologies Corp., and Vincent
Cook, a vice president of International Business Machines Corp
   The deputy has responsibility for the Pentagon's daily operation.
   Atwood has filled management positions at GM for 27 years. As
vice chairman of GM he supervises divisions that manufacture
electronics and airplane systems for the Pentagon.
   An engineer by profession, he has had experience running large
industrial organizations including GM's truck and bus group and the
Hughes Aircraft Co. after GM acquired it in 1985.

   Prime Minister Hussein Musavi of Iran arrived in Rome
today at the start of a five-day European visit that also will take
him to Poland.
   Musavi, on his first foreign trip in several years, is to meet
with Premier Ciriaco De Mita and Foreign Minister Giulio Andreotti.
On Tuesday, he will see Pope John Paul II at the Vatican.
   After Rome, Musavi is to travel to Poland to meet with Premier
Mieczyslaw Rakowksi in Warsaw.
   Iran's official Islamic News agency, monitored in Cyprus, said
Musavi was accompanied by four other government ministers and a
member of parliament.
   Italy is among Iran's major trading partners. The Italians buy
Iranian oil and export machinery, chemical and petrochemical goods.
Italian companies also have major development projects in Iran, and
Italy hopes to win contracts to rebuild Iran's oil refinery and
petrochemical industry.
   Iran has been improving economic ties with Poland and other
eastern European countries since Iran and Iraq agreed to a
cease-fire Aug. 20 in their 8-year war.
   Iran is seeking advanced technology and foreign expertise for a
post-war reconstruction program.
   Poland's Budimex company recently won a $15 million contract to
complete a power station in Iran's Khuzestan province. The Soviets
started construction of the plant but abandoned it because of Iraqi
bombing raids.

<HEAD>Reagan Mulling Whether To Ease Oil Company Sanctions</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration is weighing whether
to ease nearly 3-year-old sanctions barring U.S. oil companies from
doing business in Libya, an administration official said today.
   While emphasizing that President Reagan has made no final
decision, the official said the administration is concerned that
continuing the prohibition actually could end up benefiting Libyan
strongman Moammar Gadhafi.
   The official discussed the administration's thinking on grounds
that he not be named publicly.
   Since mid-1986, several U.S. oil companies have been barred from
doing business directly in Libya, but they have kept their assets,
including equipment, there under an agreement in which Gadhafi
recognized the firms' 49 percent share in the state-owned oil
company. The agreement froze the assets of five American companies _
Amerada Hess, Marathon Oil, W.R. Grace, Occidental Petroleum and
Concoco Petroleum.
   Under that pact, Libya has extracted oil from the American oil
fields, paying the costs of such operations while also reaping the
profits.
   But the agreement with Gadhafi expires on June 30, and some
people in the administration have voiced concern that if the U.S.
government continues its ban on the American firms doing business
there, Gadhafi might seize the assets, thus benefiting from the ban.
   The restrictions on the operations of the U.S. oil firms were
separate from the broad economic sanctions that Reagan placed on
Libya in February 1986. In April of that year, U.S. warplanes bombed
Tripoli in reprisal for Libya's alleged role in a terrorist bombing
incident that took the life of an American soldier at a West Berlin
discotheque.
   There have been new tensions between the United States and Libya
in connection with the construction of a facility that the Americans
maintain is designed to manufacture chemical weapons. Earlier this
month, American F-16 fighter jets shot down two Libyan aircraft over
the Mediterranean Gulf.
   ``It's a `Catch-22' here,'' the administration official said
today in a telephone interview. ``If things remain the same
(concerning the status of U.S. oil firms), they could benefit
Gadhafi.''
   This official said that if the sanctions against operations in
Libya by U.S. oil companies remain, ``it could result in a windfall
for Gadhafi.''
   ``No decisions have been made, but there has been discussion''
about easing the sanctions, he said. ``There are some problems with
these sanctions. ... Any changes that might be made would not be
done to ease (overall) sanctions on Libya. ... I can guarantee you
that.''
   A lifting of the restrictions by Reagan, who will leave office
Friday, could permit the companies to resume doing business in
Libya, perhaps through subsidiaries, or to sell their assets before
the agreement with Gadhafi expires.
   The New York Times reported in today's editions that Reagan was
expected this week to lift some prohibitions on U.S. oil companies
doing business in Libya to prevent them from losing their assets
there.

<TEXT>
   Praising the Soviet Union for its progress
on human rights, Secretary of State George P. Shultz arrived today
to wrap up the most ambitious human rights accord of the 1980s.
   Shultz called for the dismantling of the Soviets' radio jamming
transmitters and renewed the U.S. demand that the Soviets tear down
the Berlin Wall. He called action on the wall ``one of the acid
tests'' of Kremlin intentions.
   The secretary and other foreign ministers are in Vienna to sign
the East-West human rights and security accord, a 35-nation review
of the 1975 Helsinki agreements.
   The 50-page document took more than two years to negotiate and
was formally adopted on Sunday. It contains landmark commitments on
human rights and sets the seal on new NATO-Warsaw Pact talks on
conventional arms control that are due to open in Vienna in March.
   Shultz flew to Vienna from Washington on his final diplomatic
mission after 6{ years as State Department chief. He is to speak
Tuesday to foreign ministers reviewing the Vienna accord.
   Listing human rights improvements as his proudest achievement,
Shultz credited the Soviets and their East European allies with
adopting ``much more open'' societies than they had in 1975, when
the agreement to foster East-West understanding was signed.
   Shultz told reporters as he flew to Vienna that ``real progress
has been made, particularly in the last two or three years.''
   However, he called on the Soviets to dismantle the giant
transmitters that had jammed Western radio broadcasts for years.
Late last year, the Soviets and their East European allies stopped
interfering with Radio Liberty and Radio Free Europe broadcasts.
   ``Jamming has stopped,'' Shultz said, ``and we don't want to see
it reinstituted.''
   Therefore, Shultz said, ``we think that the facilities by which
you jam ought to be dismantled so that you can't start it up again.''
   The Helsinki accords, signed by the United States, the Soviet
Union, Canada and 32 European nations, tacitly accepted the
post-World War II borders of Eastern Europe. In exchange for this
concession, the Soviets pledged to permit more contacts with the
West and freer movement of people and ideas.
   ``In Helsinki,'' Shultz said, ``the diplomacy was way ahead of
the reality. Gradually, the reality has moved toward what we set out
as the objective. It has a long way to go, but now we have a process
of movement.''
   Shultz, who leaves office with the Reagan administration on
Friday, seemed confident the incoming Bush administration would keep
pressure on Moscow.
   He singled out the concrete and barbed-wire wall that surrounds
West Berlin, keeping East Germans from fleeing, as an unfulfilled
goal.
   ``It's more than a symbol. It tells you, by its very presence,
that you still have a long way to go,'' Shultz said.
   He seemed taken aback by published reports that senior officials
in the new administration had questioned President Reagan's decision
to hold a human rights conference in Moscow in 1991.
   The decision, taken on Shultz's recommendation, was based on
several steps taken by the Soviets, including the release of more
than 600 political prisoners, the reunification of more than 100
families and increased Jewish emigration.
   ``I certainly haven't heard a word from anyone in the Bush
administration,'' Shultz said. ``It's obviously a question of some
judgment.''
   He said that by setting conditions for the Soviets to host the
conference, including guaranteed free access by all Soviet citizens,
``we managed to help along the process quite a bit.''
   Shultz said the conference was a chance ``to bring the human
rights message right into the hearts of the Soviet Union'' and had
been endorsed by Andrei Sakharov, the prominent Soviet human rights
activist and physicist.

   Worshippers filling the Rev. Martin Luther King
Jr.'s church were admonished today to remember the slain civil
rights leader's birthday by rededicating themselves to his work.
   ``It is our hope and our desire ... that we will realize it is an
unending quest,'' said the Rev. Joseph Roberts, pastor of Ebenezer
Baptist Church, where King and his father preached.
   Roberts opened the annual ecumenical service that attracted
local, state and federal officials to mark the national holiday
honoring King. Among those gathered on the podium were members of
King's family, the Rev. Jesse Jackson, U.S. Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh, actress Jane Fonda, Georgia Gov. Joe Frank Harris and
the state's senators and congressmen.
   Thornburgh called King ``a martyr slain in his prime while trying
to make America and the world a place where justice, freedom and
peace could flourish.''
   President-elect George Bush sent a letter to be read at the
service, in which he pledged that his administration ``will work
tirelessly for the strict enforcement of civil rights as well as for
absolute equality for all Americans.''
   In Washington, Bush commemorated the holiday with a glowing
tribute to King in a speech to about 300 prominent blacks.
   ``He lived a hero's life. He dreamed a hero's dreams. He left a
hero's indelible mark on the mind and imagination of a great
nation,'' Bush told members of the Inaugural Afro-American Committee.
   Looking ahead to his inauguration on Friday, Bush said: ``What
becomes of Martin Luther King's dreams is up to us. We must not fail
him. We must not fail ourselves.''
   In South Africa, U.S. Ambassador Edward Perkins marked the
holiday by unveiling a bronze bust of King on a bushy plot of land
in Pretoria where the new U.S. embassy is to stand.
   In Boston, Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis invoked King's
memory when he announced an executive order that will bar the state
from buying goods and services from companies that have dealings
with the South African government.
   In Groton, Conn., 51 demonstrators were arrested on charges of
disorderly conduct at the Electric Boat shipyard as they protested
the construction of Trident nuclear submarines. The demonstrators,
many carrying pictures of King and citing his belief in non-violent
protest, said the demonstration was held in observance of his
birthday.
   Elsewhere around the nation, planned observances of the King
holiday included the swearing-in of the first blacks on the Dallas
County (Ala.) Commission in more than a century. The ceremony was
scheduled for Selma, where King began the 1965 Selma-to-Montgomery
march that resulted in passage of the Voting Rights Act.
   The Liberty Bell in Philadelphia was to be symbolically tapped
today and church and school bells were being rung in Michigan.
Golfers were to tee off in a suburban Los Angeles tournament
benefiting King's Southern Christian Leadership Conference.
   The observance at Ebenezer Baptist Church capped a week of
remembrance in King's hometown. At the church Sunday, King's widow
urged Bush to hold true to his call for ``a kinder, gentler nation''
and to impose strict sanctions against South Africa.
   In addition, Coretta Scott King said in her annual ``State of the
Dream'' speech, the United States must do more by ``providing
education and economic assistance directly to black South Africans
who bear the brunt of suffering in that troubled land.''
   ``I think we ought to take the president-elect at his word and
hold him to his call for a kinder, gentler nation where peace and
justice are in fact a reality,'' she said. ``But a kinder, gentler
nation will require kinder, gentler leaders.''
   Mrs. King spoke before an estimated 1,200 people at the church
where King and his father were co-pastors. It may have been her
final ``State of the Dream'' address as president of The King
Center, a memorial and policy center in Atlanta.
   On Saturday, she announced that her 27-year-old son, Dexter Scott
King, would assume the presidency April 4 _ the 21st anniversary of
King's assassination at a Memphis, Tenn., motel in 1968.
   Today is the fourth year for the King national holiday. In 1983,
after considerable debate, Congress named the third Monday in
January as a national holiday honoring King, whose actual birthday
was Sunday.
   Most states also observe Martin Luther King Jr. Day as a state
holiday. Among the few that don't is Arizona, where rallies were
planned in Phoenix and Tucson and where prospects are uncertain for
a measure that lawmakers plan to introduce this year.

   Members of the Ku Klux Klan were shut out
of two Christmas parades, but they finally held their parade in this
central Florida town _ on the birthday of the Rev. Martin Luther
King Jr.
   The one-car procession Sunday featured four Klansmen in a car
draped with Confederate flags and a sign reading, ``Martin Luther
King was a commi.''
   The Klan members, two of whom wore white robes, stopped at City
Hall and read a statement proclaiming white supremacy.
   About 55 police officers and 150 spectators quietly watched the
proceedings.
   The Klan announced last month that it would march in Mount Dora's
annual Christmas parade, but authorities canceled the event. Later,
the Klan was excluded from a rescheduled parade when organizers made
it ``by invitation only.''

   Looking for a tax break? Want to amend the
Constitution? Find it impossible to sing ``The Star-Spangled
Banner''? Tired of those truckers who use a radar detector to roar
unmolested through speed traps?
   Who you gonna call? Try your member of Congress. If the first two
days of the 1989 session are any indication, he or she will
introduce a bill on just about any subject.
   During those two days, House members introduced at least 504
bills and 139 resolutions. Senators won't start introducing
legislation until the Senate reconvenes Jan. 20.
   The most popular subject was taxes _ scores of tax bills of one
variety or another were offered; almost without exception they would
cut taxes. The only increases proposed would hit imported oil
(offered by Rep. Glenn English, D-Okla.), snuff and chewing tobacco
(Rep. Brian Donnelly, D-Mass.), and deductions for corporate
takeovers (Rep. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D.)
   Social Security bills were offered by the dozens, and most would
restore benefits that Congress took away during the Reagan era.
Several would permit recipients to earn unlimited wages without
losing part of their benefits.
   There are proposed constitutional amendments galore. They would
outlaw abortion, allow organized school prayer, spell out equal
rights for women, prohibit busing, repeal the two-term limitation on
presidents, limit a president or senator to one six-year term and a
House member to three two-year terms and prohibit a president from
pardoning a person who had not been convicted.
   What's more, just about every House member seems to have proposed
or signed a bill to block the pay raise recommended by President
Reagan for members of Congress and other top government officials.
   If history is a guide, chances are that fewer than a dozen of the
504 bills will become law. It's a pretty good bet that the bills
blocking the pay raise will not be among them.
   The bills address virtually every problem that a member of
Congress might have heard mentioned during the recent campaign.
Thus, they provide a handy guide to what lawmakers are thinking
about. Here are some samples:

<HEAD>Stolen Explosives Came From Same Mine As Earlier Bombs</HEAD>

   Authorities say 300 pounds of plastic
explosives recovered in a raid here were stolen from the same mine
that was the source of stolen explosives used in a series of
Denver-area bombings.
   Investigators did not cite any links between the two cases.
Authorities are trying to determine whether white supremicists are
behind the latest theft, which led to Friday night's raid at a
Longmont motel.
   Five people were arrested in the raid, including Jon Alexander
Kobert of Fort Collins, Colo. Police said Kobert told agents of the
federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms that some of the
explosives were going to be used to bomb police departments.
   Boulder County Sheriff's Sgt. George Dunphy said the explosives
have been traced to the John Jay Mine, northwest of Boulder.
   Gates Hartley, the son of the mine's owner, is accused of
stealing more than 100 pounds of explosives in 1987 and using them
to bomb a gas station, several cars and a high school.
   Hartley, a Navy seaman, has been jailed since last week in
Norfolk, Va., pending extradition to Colorado. He faces
investigation on charges of arson and possession of explosives in
connection with the 1987 bombings.
   In the latest case, Kobert, 29, and four other suspects, all
wearing military gear and armed with guns and switchblade knives,
were arrested after attempting to deliver 300 pounds of explosives,
plus 2,000 blasting caps and detonation cords, to undercover agents,
authorities said.
   Four of the suspects were held at the Denver City Jail awaiting
federal charges. They were identified as Kobert; Richard Sanford
Baxter, 51, of Fort Collins; Andrew Wallace Ferguson, 29, of Fort
Collins; and Jeffery Bart Rudolph, 29, of Akron, Colo.
   Evelyn Jean Moschetti, 18, of LaPorte, Colo., is in the Boulder
County Jail for investigation of possession of explosives and
conspiracy.

<HEAD>Qualifications of First Woman Bishop Evoke Controversy</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A divorced, former public relations executive with neither a
college nor a seminary degree stands on the verge of giving women
entry into a two-millenium tradition dating to Jesus Christ.
   The Rev. Barbara C. Harris, who held the cross when the first
women were ``illegally'' ordained priests in the Episcopal Church in
1974, is expected this week to gain official approval as the first
woman bishop elected by a church that believes in apostolic
succession, or that the leadership of the church can be traced to
the apostles initially commissioned by Christ.
   ``It's far more than an election. It's really an embracing of the
feminine spiritually. And that is going to be a monumental change,''
said the Rev. Eleanor Lee McGee, an assistant professor of pastoral
counseling at Yale Divinity School.
   But while the other branches of the worldwide Anglican Communion
and major ecumenical partners such as the Catholic Church _ which
also believes in apostolic succession _ weigh the consequences of a
woman bishop, the discussion in the United States has focused on the
qualifications of the particular woman involved.
   ``I know many people in the church who believe in the ordination
of women, but who are appalled by this, and feel it does the
movement no good,'' said the Rev. Andrew Mead, rector of the
Episcopal Church of the Advent in Boston.
   The Episcopal Diocese of Massachusetts elected Harris suffragan,
or assistant, bishop in September. Under church law, the election
requires approval from a majority of Standing Committees and the
bishops leading the 118 dioceses in the United States.
   After the committees gave their approval, ballots were sent
earlier this month to the bishops. A majority are expected to
approve her election as early as Wednesday, paving the way for a
consecration already scheduled Feb. 11 in Boston, said the Rev.
James Solheim, a spokesman for the Massachusetts diocese.
   The Episcopal Church approved the ordination of women in 1976,
two years after the ceremony in which ``the Philadephia 11'' were
``ordained'' in the Church of the Advocate, where Harris was
associate rector prior to her election in Boston. Other women have
been candidates for bishop, but Harris was the first to win election.
   Harris, who has declined interviews until she receives official
approval, said in a sermon last year that her election gives ``new
hope ... and new vision to hundreds of thousands'' who have felt
left out of the denomination.
   But her election also drew unusual opposition. Approving locally
elected bishops normally is ``quite perfunctory,'' but at least 30
of the 118 dioceses have already voted against her approval, Solheim
said.
   While her gender assures Harris a place in religious history,
that is only one of many ``firsts'' for her.
   At least three bishops are said to lack a seminary degree, but
Harris appears to be the only bishop without an undergraduate
college degree in any field.
   And in a church struggling to uphold marriage in a nation with
the world's highest divorce rate, she is thought to be the first
bishop elected after a divorce, though bishops have divorced while
in office.
   In the debate over her election in the United States, gender was
noticeably absent.
   Some moderate voices within the church, such as H. Boone Porter
of The Living Church, an independent national church magazine
headquartered in Milwaukee, objected to Harris' lack of a formal
education and full-time parish experience.
   Harris was ordained a priest in Philadelphia in 1980 after a
career in corporate public relations. In addition to her parish
work, she also recently headed the Episcopal Church Publishing Co.,
which produces the liberal church magazine, The Witness. She studied
theology through correspondence courses and with tutors.
   The issue that has troubled people in the pews, some pastors say,
is her divorce. ``Don't we need encouragement by the chief pastor to
stay faithful?'' Mead said his parishioners have asked.
   Others question the validity of the charges raised against Harris.
   ``To put it bluntly, Barbara was different,'' said the Rev. James
Lewis, director of social ministry for the Diocese of North
Carolina, where the Standing Committee twice voted against approving
her election. ``Basically, they were reflecting what we've had in
this church, a basic white gentleman's club.''
   For women who fought the early battles along with Harris to
remove sexual barriers to the priesthood, the arguments being raised
against the pioneer bishop, who is also black, sound all too
familiar.
   ``With racism and sexism, I always expect there is going to be
difficulty, but I'm always surprised in the way it surfaces,'' said
Ms. McGee. ``There would have been issues raised no matter who it
is.''
   The Rev. Patricia Cadwallader took a traditional route to the
Episcopal priesthood, attending Seabury Western Theological Seminary
at Northwestern University. When she went before the Standing
Committee of the Diocese of Ohio seeking ordination, she recalled
one member saying, ``If you were menstruating on the altar, then the
blood would not be only the blood of Christ, it would be your
blood.''
   Now she sees the same thing happening to Harris.
   ``When you don't like someone or don't like something, you grab
at straws,'' said Ms. Cadwallader, who left the Episcopal Church to
become a Presbyterian minister. ``I think they're grabbing at things
not to like about her. I think she's a giant of a woman.''

   More than 800 candidates were expected to
register for Iraq's third national assembly elections scheduled for
March, a government official said Monday.
   The election for the 255-seat assembly originally was scheduled
for Aug. 30 but delayed until March 3 because of the Aug. 20 United
Nations-sponsored cease-fire in the war with Iran.
   In the last two assembly elections, which are held every four
years, members of the ruling Baath Socialist Party ran along with
indepndent candidates. The last election for the Baath-dominated
assembly was in 1984.
   Many independent candidates were elected to the assembly, which
according to Iraq's constitution, shares legislative powers with the
nine-member Revolution Command Council.
   The council, which has veto powers, must ratify the assembly's
draft legislation before it can become law.
   Iraq has an estimated electorate of 7 million people. Everyone
over 18 can vote.

   Three bodies were found in the desert near
Interstate 10 in the last week, but police say the deaths appear to
be unrelated.
   A transient looking for a place to rest Sunday discovered a human
skeleton in a drainage tunnel under I-10 near the town of Fabens,
police said.
   Last weekend, the skeletal remains of 17-year-old Angela Irsay
were found near I-10 in east El Paso. And on Thursday, a passerby
found the body of a woman about five miles west of Fabens and 25
yards south of I-10. She had been bound and shot in the head, and a
cloth was put over her head and set afire.
   No arrests have been made.
   The last two victims have not been identified, and police do not
yet know the sex or cause of death of the body found Sunday,
Sheriff's Detective Marvin Ryals said.
   Miss Irsay had last been seen Sept. 22, according to police. The
cause of her death could not be determined.

   Two teen-agers were charged with murder today for
their alleged roles in a car chase that led to the deaths of two
young police officers, authorities said.
   One youth, a 16-year-old, was brought to police by his mother
Sunday night. The other, a 17-year-old, was arrested early today
after police questioned the younger boy.
   The two are accused in the deaths of Lisa Sandel, 26, and Mark
Fleming, 24, whose police cruiser went out of control Friday night
and slammed into the rear of a pickup on a rain-slickened street. A
police recruit riding in the back seat of the car was seriously
injured.
   The officers were pursuing a stolen car when the accident
occurred. The vehicle was found abandoned nearby shortly after the
crash.
   A police spokesman, Detective Roy Hodgens, said it was too early
to discuss the specific roles the two youths may have played in the
car theft and chase.
   Detective J.C. Davis said Ray Earvin McLin, 17, was being held at
the Lew Sterrett Justice Center on $100,000 bond. No bond was set
for the 16-year-old, who was being held at the Dallas County
Juvenile Detention Center, Davis said.
   Davis, who works in the department's hit-and-run division, said
other charges in connection with the vehicle theft are pending.
   The first teen-ager surrendered while about 200 police officers,
their families and city officials gathered Sunday evening for a
candlelight vigil honoring the two officers.
   Many in the group sighed when Deputy Chief Terrell Bolton, head
of the Southwest Patrol Division, announced at the start of the
vigil that an arrest had been made in the case.
   Mayor Annette Strauss praised the police department and asked the
crowd to pray for the hospitalized recruit injured in the wreck.
   The recruit, Nathaniel White, 25, was in serious condition today
in the intensive care unit at Baylor University Medical Center,
officials said. White was heavily sedated and was expected to ramain
so for two to three days, police said.
   Willie Earl Henderson, 62, driver of the pickup, was in stable
condition today at Charlton Methodist Hospital in Duncanville, said
Kim Hollin, a hospital administrator.
   Last year, five Dallas police officers _ three on duty and two
working off-duty security jobs _ were killed by gunfiret. A Dallas
County sheriff's deputy was killed in the county jail Jan. 4 by a
homeless man who was released from the facility a few hours earlier.

<TEXT>
   With a $2.5 million Los Angeles mansion
symbolizing the elegance of comfortable retirement, Ronald and Nancy
Reagan will remain active after his presidency, writing memoirs,
making speeches and pushing pet causes.
   The Reagans have set themselves up for a life-after-Washington
that will afford them the luxury of relaxing either at the Bel Air
home or a mountaintop ranch in Santa Barbara County, or enjoying the
attention of friends on the Southern California social scene.
   Reagan will receive an annual pension of $99,500 for his service
as president, and around $29,100 in a California pension for his
time as governor there in 1967-75. Mrs. Reagan receives no
government pension.
   No president since Dwight D. Eisenhower has left Washington with
such a high relative political standing, and this ensures that
Reagan will be inundated with requests to appear on ``the
mashed-potato circuit'' _ as he calls it.
   ``I can assure you, he won't be like Thomas Jefferson, and have
to sell his library to Congress for $25,000 to keep the farm at
Monticello,'' said Milton Jaques, director of the National News
Speakers Bureau here.
   Reagan has said that he's eager to return to California, but has
indicated that his departure from the nation's capital will be
somewhat bittersweet. He's said, for instance, that he will very
much miss those who have worked with him.
   But the Reagans have made no secret of their desire for a quieter
life with more privacy.
   Much of the Reagans' activities, aside from planned travels
around the country and overseas, will be in relatively easy access
of the ranch-style, flagstone mansion in a residential area that is
home to a host of Hollywood celebrities. Both Reagans have offices
in the Fox Century Plaza office complex, which is only about a
15-minute drive.
   Reagan can look forward to completion of the Ronald Reagan
Presidential Library in Simi Valley, between the Los Angeles home
and his ranch in the Santa Ynez Mountains, while Mrs. Reagan plans
to spend time occasionally at the Nancy Reagan Center for drug
abuse, which is to be in the San Fernando Valley closer to the city.
   Reagan recently quipped that ``as soon as I get home to
California, I plan to lean back, kick up my feet and take a long
nap.''
   But those who know him say that Reagan plans to remain very
active _ his jokes about retirement notwithstanding. He has served
notice of several specific plans:
   _``I think I'll be out on the mashed-potato circuit again,
extolling the virtues of line-item veto and balanced budget
amendment,'' he told students at the University of Virginia in
Charlottesville last month.
   _``Somebody's talking to me about doing a book,'' he said one
time. ``And there are some backstage stories that I might enjoy
getting out.''
   Mrs. Reagan, who has bristled over tell-all books such as the one
written by former White House chief of staff Donald T. Regan, has a
contract with Random House to publish her memoirs.
   The Reagans seem sure to be much more visible in retirement than
their predecessors, Jimmy and Rosalyn Carter. Former President
Gerald R. Ford gets many speaking invitations and serves on various
boards of directors, but Reagan could be even a bigger draw on the
lecture circuit.
   Peter Flaherty, who is in the process of folding the tent of
Citizens for Reagan, a private group organized early in Reagan's
presidency to lobby for Reagan programs, said, ``The other living
presidents left office unwillingly. Reagan goes out a winner.''
   ``He'll be out speaking to the public, and there'll be plenty of
people paying big money to see him,'' said Flaherty, whose
organization at its height had some 100,000 members.
   Said Larry Sabato, a political science professor at the
University of Virginia: ``He's going to be inundated with speaking
engagement requests. I suspect he's going to rival (President-elect)
Bush as the principal fund-raiser for the (Republican) party.''
   ``I would say his plate is going to be very full, indeed,''
Sabato said of Reagan.
   Jaques said that big-ticket speakers have drawn as high as
$32,000, although usually the maximum is $25,000, and said that
Reagan will be able to pick and choose.
   ``There is a president who is willing to speak, and you've got a
lot of people with a lot of money who want to impress people,'' he
said. ``I'm sure that he wants to enjoy his retirement and take a
few well-selected engagements.''

<HEAD>Senate Hearings On Bush Cabinet Open Tuesday With Spotlight On Baker</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate opens a spate of confirmation
hearings Tuesday on President-elect Bush's new Cabinet with a tough
task: seeking to pin down Secretary of State-designate James A.
Baker III, a master tactician, on complex issues from US-Soviet
relations to Central America.
   Democrats on the Foreign Relations Committee will be trying to
corral Baker on how the United States will deal with the problems in
Ceremendous experience in dealing with Congress, and is seen as
likely to tiptoe cautiously through his answers without making firm
commitments.
   ``Baker will duck every substantive question,'' predicted one
Democratic aide involved in preparations for the two days of
hearings, who spoke only on condition of anonymity.
   But such reticence is unlikely to cause problems with
confirmation, and Baker's name is expected to be among the first
wave of appointments approved when the full Senate opens for
business on Jan. 25.
   Baker has made the rounds of committee members in recent weeks,
carefully cultivating members of the committee and ``telling them
what they want to hear,'' according to one aide.
   For example, he has told conservatives to expect no sudden
changes from Reagan's policies in Central America, but has told
liberals that the new administration will emphasize diplomacy,
rather than military aid to the Nicaraguan rebels. Both sides will
likely seek to get those pledges on the public record at the
hearings, and to make them more specific.
   They also will be looking for pledges of bipartisanship on
foreign policy. The current secretary of state, George Shultz, is
respected in Congress but criticized for his relative lack of
consultation with key lawmakers. ``It's one thing to not want
Congress to lead in foreign policy, and to insist on your
prerogatives, but it's another thing to ignore Congress entirely,''
said an aide to one committee Democrat.
   Confirmation hearings for other Cabinet nominees will follow in
quick succession, and Bush's choices of experienced, moderate,
pragmatic figures for most posts means the process should offer
debate on substantive issues rather than the ideological arguments
of the Reagan years.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, has said he is
impressed with the appointees as a group and expects the Senate to
work well with them.
   ``They are generally experienced, hopefully pragmatic people, and
we won't have the rigid ideology of the first Reagan term,''
Mitchell said. ``I am trying very hard to establish from our side an
atmosphere of cooperation and bipartisanship.''
   The Democrats who control Congress are likely to use the sessions
to force Bush's nominees to say how they will carry out their boss'
campaign promises to tend to neglected social programs in a time of
extreme fiscal austerity, and to test the strength of Bush's
no-new-taxes pledge.
   ``They will want to build a record for why new revenues are going
to be needed,'' said Charles Cook, a Washington political analyst.
``The Democrats are going to let the nominees build their case for
them.''
   Rejection of a presidential Cabinet nominee is rare. Since the
birth of the republic just eight Cabinet appointees have been voted
down by the Senate, which has the power to do so under the
Constitution. The last instance came in 1959, when President
Eisenhower's choice for commerce secretary, Lewis L. Strauss, was
rejected on a 49-46 vote.
   The Senate Labor Committee will hold a confirmation hearing on
Thursday for Elizabeth Dole as labor secretary, and the Governmental
Operations Committee holds a hearing the same day on Richard G.
Darman as Bush's budget director.
   With Darman, senators will be looking for clues about the new
administration's budget priorities and how it will address the
deficit. Specifically, they will be probing for whether Bush's
promise not to raise taxes might have loopholes that would provide
revenues to finance pet programs.
   In the next few weeks, attention will focus on hearings for
former Sen. John Tower, Bush's choice for secretary of defense;
Robert Mosbacher, to be commerce secretary; former Rep. Jack Kemp,
to head the Department of Housing and Urban Development; Samuel
Skinner, transportation; Louis W. Sullivan, health and human
services; Clayton Yeutter, agriculture; former Rep. Edward J.
Derwinski, veterans affairs; former Rep. Manuel Lujan Jr., interior;
and retired Adm. James D. Watkins, energy.
   Other appointees of Cabinet rank include Carla Hills, who had
been HUD secretary in the Ford administration, as trade

<HEAD>Guerrillas Rocket Kabul, Killing 4</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Guerrillas made their first rocket
attack on Kabul in nearly three weeks Monday, hitting a residential
district with four missiles that killed four people and wounded
nine, officials reported.
   One killed a 15-year-old girl who was walking in a graveyard,
residents of the area said.
   Western diplomats in embassies near the road to the airport said
they heard eight rockets land. It was the first reported attack
since Dec. 27 by Moslem insurgents, who have moved into the hills
around the capital as Soviet soldiers leave Afghanistan to meet a
Feb. 15 deadline.
   An Interior Ministry statement said the rockets hit the Qalyszman
district, a neighborhood where most houses are built of mud. It said
casualties included women and children, but did not elaborate.
   Guerrillas have increased pressure on supply convoys bound for
the capital.
   On Sunday, Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze of the Soviet
Union ended a three-day visit with a pledge of arms supplies to the
government after the remaining 50,000 Soviet soldiers are gone.
   Shevardnadze implied the withdrawal would go ahead as scheduled
and said his government believes the army of President Najib can
cope with the insurgents on its own.
   Moslem guerrillas began fighting after a communist coup in April
1978 and use border towns and refugee camps in Pakistan, to which
millions of Afghans have fled, as bases and supply points. They are
supported by Pakistan and the United States.
   Soviet soldiers entered Afghanistan in December 1979 and were
estimated to number 115,000 when the withdrawal began May 15 under
an agreement mediated by the United Nations.
   Moscow has insisted that communists have a role in a postwar
government, but the guerrillas refuse and broke off talks with
Kremlin representatives Jan. 6.
   An insurgent news agency in Islamabad, Pakistan, said Monday
guerrillas had overrun two military posts in the border area but
allowed 200 food trucks through to Kabul.
   It said the posts were captured in the past week and put the
guerrillas within three miles of Jalalabad, a government-held city
42 miles from Pakistan.
   There was no independent confirmation of the report, which said
insurgents captured six tanks and 3,000 weapons. Guerrilla sources
claimed 600 Afghan soldiers and militiamen surrendered.
   Guerrillas also claimed to have increased attacks near Kandahar
in the southeast, Herat in the west and in northern provinces on the
Soviet burder.
   Their news agency said about 200 supply trucks were allowed into
Kabul last week to relieve food and fuel shortages. Reports in the
capital, however, said insurgents continued to attack highway
convoys and few supplies were reaching the city.
   Lines for food and fuel begin to form in early morning. Prices
are rising rapidly in Kabul and power blackouts last several hours a
day.

<HEAD>Atwater To Bring Tough Style Of Politics To GOP National Committee</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The man who made the Pledge of Allegiance and
Willie Horton front-burner issues in the 1988 campaign will bring
the same tough style of politics to the Republican National
Committee.
   As Lee Atwater describes it, it's just a matter of making the
committee ``more issue-oriented.''
   Democrats take a less-benign view.
   ``Lee Atwater is probably the most evil man in America,'' said
Democratic Rep. Pat Schroeder of Colorado, shortly after the
election.
   ``If we have to sink to their level to protect democracy and to
break them of sucking eggs then I'm perfectly willing to do it,''
said Texas Democratic Party chairman Bob Slagle the day
President-elect Bush designated Atwater as his choice for Republican
Party chairman.
   In a recent interview, Atwater laughed off the opposition jibes.
   ``They're running around now, it looks to me, saying they're
going to be tougher on me than we ever were,'' he said. ``Maybe,
we'll be the ones complaining the next time.''
   ``I think that's their problem,'' he went on. ``They don't
understand that voters are not concerned with campaign personalities
and campaign tactics.''
   Atwater was Bush's 1988 campaign manager. On Election Day, with
no doubt about the outcome of the race between Bush and Democrat
Michael Dukakis, Bush and Atwater went jogging. During their run,
Bush offered Atwater his backing to succeed Frank J. Fahrenkopf Jr.
as party chairman.
   That backing is enough to make the choice unanimous when RNC
members elect their new chairman two days before Bush takes office.
   At 37, Atwater has worked on three presidential campaigns. His
relationship with Bush began in 1973 when Bush was party chairman
and Atwater was national director of College Republicans, a
22-year-old from Newberry College in South Carolina who was wound as
tight as a Mickey Mouse watch.
   The preppy party chairman who grew up in Greenwich, Conn., and
the raspy-voiced country boy from South Carolina hit it off.
   Atwater recalled that back in those days ``I thought to myself
the two things I'd like to do in politics was manage a presidential
campaign one day and be chairman of the party one day.''
   In his temporary office on the 10th floor of the Bush transition
headquarters, Atwater is a study in motion, a leg bouncing up and
down as he outlined his plans to revamp the RNC.
   He said his goals are to sharpen the committee's campaign
capabilities, launch an outreach program to attract more blacks,
Hispanics, Asians and handicapped voters to the GOP, and to promote
the interests of Bush.
   Bush will be the first president who had experience as his
party's chairman. He served under a Republican president _ Richard
M. Nixon _ who regarded the committee as a minor appendage of the
White House.
   That perception is likely to change markedly during the next four
years.
   During the Reagan presidency, it always was clear that the
political direction came from White House aides such as Lyn Nofziger
and Ed Rollins, not the party chairman.
   At one point, when the White House wanted to exercise
extraordinary control over party affairs, Paul Laxalt, the Nevada
senator and a close personal friend of Reagan, was named general
chairman, a post that emphasized the political impotence of
Fahrenkopf.
   No such arrangement seems possible under Atwater whose political
ties to Bush are stronger than those of any White House aide with
the possible exception of chief of staff John Sununu.
   Atwater describes himself as ``a good nuts and bolts
politician,'' and he intends to bring that skill to the RNC.
   ``We've got to target very early and we've got to be somewhat
brutal in our targeting,'' he said, in elections over the next two
years.
   Control of the redrawing of legislative district lines to conform
with the 1990 census is a major goal of both parties and the
Democrats approach that process with a big edge.
   In 28 states, Democrats control both legislative chambers, while
Republicans have total control in only eight. Party control is split
in 13 states, and Nebraska has a unicameral, non-partisan
legislature.
   Of the nation's 50 governors, 28 are Democrats and 22 Republicans.
   Atwater's approach will be to identify congressional and state
legislative districts offering the greatest opportunity for gains
and concentrate RNC resources there.
   ``We have a bigger cadre of people in our party that have
down-to-earth campaign experience,'' he said, and he is recruiting
them to oversee critical areas.
   Outreach to minorities was the other high priority political goal
mentioned by Atwater.
   ``I am convinced affirmative action did work over the last 25
years and we now have a larger black middle class than we've ever
had,'' he said. ``As it continues to grow that's fertile ground for
us, because we are the party of the middle class.''
   But what most politicians in both parties will watch is whether
Atwater brings the same slashing tactics to the RNC that he used so
effectively in the last presidential campaign.
   ``There are clear issues that separate these parties,'' he said
``and I intend to keep those issues in the forefront.''
   Does that mean voters haven't seen the last of Willie Horton, a
convicted murderer who escaped while on furlough and brutalized a
Maryland couple, and the Pledge of Allegiance?
   ``We're not going to go back on furloughs or the pledge,'' he
said, then pausing a moment, ``If we could get away with it, we
would.''

   Gov. Michael S. Dukakis said Monday he will order
an end to excutive branch purchases from companies tied to
white-ruled South Africa.
   ``From this point forward, the message will go out loud and clear
from at least one state government that we are not going to do
business with people who do business with that government and that
country,'' Dukakis told a Martin Luther King Day breakfast audience.
   In a speech to about 2,000 activists and community, business and
government officials, Dukakis recalled King said ``whatever affects
one directly affects all indirectly.''
   ``Apartheid is an affront to humanity everywhere and ...
Massachusetts will raise its strong, proud voice for liberty, for
justice, for democracy whenever and wherever we can.''
   Dukakis said he would sign the executive order Friday. At least
four other states _ Michigan, Maryland, Rhode Island and North
Carolina _ have barred state purchases of goods and services from
companies with ties to racially segregated South Africa.
   In 1983, Massachusetts became the first state to pass legislation
divesting its state pension fund holdings in companies operating in
South Africa.
   Since then, members of the legislative black caucus have promoted
a bill that would also end state purchase of goods and services from
companies that deal with the South African government. The bill
passed the House in 1987 and 1988, but died in the Senate.
   While the caucus continues to push for the bill, it also sought
out Dukakis' support for the executive order, said Rep. Byron
Rushing, the bill's prime sponsor.
   ``I'm sorry that we haven't been able to pass the legislation
yet, but I think this is a good step in the right direction,''
Rushing said.
   The executive order isn't as broad as the legislation, affecting
only executive branch purchases. It will not affect the Legislature,
the courts or quasi-public agencies such as the Massachusetts Port
Authority.
   It also is subject to withdrawal by Dukakis' successor in two
years.
   According to the administration, the order will not result in any
significant cost to the commonwealth. However, it could affect about
200 companies nationwide with a total of $21 million in state
purchasing contracts.
   Companies with South African ties that are sole providers of
goods and services would be exempt.

<HEAD>Shultz Ending Diplomatic Career With Praise For Soviet Union</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Soviet-Reagan, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Diplomatic Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz will
mark the end of his 6{-year diplomatic career with a speech Tuesday
that mixes praise for the Soviet Union with a call for continuing
reforms.
   Shultz is in the Austrian capital to mark the end of a 27-month
review of the Helsinki agreement, a 35-nation accord in 1975 that
proposed to reduce East-West tensions and promote democracy.
   The final document reinforces the human rights message and also
urges all nations to keep their guard up against terrorism.
   Shultz praised the Vienna accord adopted Sunday on his way to
Vienna from Washington. In turn, he earned rare praise from the
Soviet Communist Party newspaper Pravda as one of the architects of
the recent upswing in Soviet-U.S. relations.
   The often stodgy party daily drew an unusually warm and human
picture of Shultz, depicting him as a gourmet father of five who
enjoys tennis, golf and ballroom dancing.
   A congressional delegation, in Vienna to monitor developments,
joined Shultz in praise of what has been accomplished in the Soviet
Union under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   ``We ought to be optimistic,'' said the chairman, Rep. Steny
Hoyer, D-Md., ``The most optimstic of us would not have preicted the
progtress that has cpoccurred.''
   He cited a ``dramatic reduction'' in the number of Soviet
political prisoners, rising emigration and the reunification of
families.
   Still, Hoyer criticized the ``gross intimidation'' of
demonstrators in Prague, Czechoslovakia, on Sunday, and said the
congressional oversight group was aware of about 130 cases of people
held in Soviet mental institutions and jails who may be political
victims of ``trumped-up charges.''
   The State Department credits the Soviets with more than 600
releases but Hoyer said, ``We haven't reached zero.''
   Sen. Mark Hatfield, R-Ore., said the declaration adopted Sunday
``adds another step to the recognition of changing attitudes'' in
eastern Europe.
   Sen. James McClure, R-Idaho, said it would be harder to fend off
Western inquiries into human rights abuses by saying ``this is an
internal affair.''
   The accord sets down for the first time a mechanism allowing
Western governments to raise human rights issues on a bilateral
level with any East bloc nation at any moment.
   Shultz praised the Soviets for gradually implementing the
promises held out by the Helsinki agreement.
   ``Real progress has been made, particularly in the last two or
three years,'' he said.
   But Shultz also called on the Soviets to take at least two
specific steps to maintain the momentum.
   He wants the jamming transmitters silenced by Gorbachev last year
dismantled so that jamming of Western radio stations cannot resume.
   And he described the Berlin Wall, which fences out East German
from fleeing to West Berlin as ``one of the acid tests'' of Soviet
performance.
   ``Until that wall comes down, it's just there,'' Shultz said.
``And it's more than a symbol.''
   Reflecting on his long diplomatic career, Shultz said ``the
things I feel best about had to do with the area of human rights.''
   He said ``the one incident that always sticks with me is the day
I had a phone call from Ida Nudel saying, `I'm home.' I still tingle
a little as I think of it.''
   Mrs. Nudel, a long-term Jewish dissident, emigrated last year
from the Soviet Union to Israel after Shultz pressed her case with
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze.
   ``These things that have a human scale to them, I think, probably
for most people, are the ones that you get the greatest and deepest
good feeling about,'' Shultz said.
   Pravda singled out human feelings in its article on Shultz, who
leaves office this week.
   ``Foreign policy is made by real people,'' it said. ``And it's
fair to say that one of the architects of the turn in
Soviet-American relations was Shultz.''
   ``Here, the realism of Shultz expressed itself, as well as his
sober recognition that in the nuclear age the self-preservation of
our two countries could be guaranteed only by the means of
dialogue.''
   Shultz established ``working, constructive relations'' with
Shevardnadze, Pravda noted. ``He did a lot.''

   Students who cut class at Miriam Waltzer's
school could end up behind bars.
   ``The choice is clear _ learn or go to jail,'' says Waltzer, a
criminal court judge who got tired of seeing young defendants who
couldn't read the legal paperwork in front of them.
   Her solution: turn her courtroom into a classroom.
   ``What I noticed was that the defendants got younger and younger
and less and less educated. I realized that I had the power to put
them on probation and make education part of the terms of that
probation,'' the judge said.
   Since most had been expelled from school, she couldn't send them
back there.
   So Waltzer started what she calls the Probation Education Program
_ PEP _ with classes in her courtroom run by volunteer tutors. The
program, which she supervises, started in May and now has an
enrollment of two dozen students, ages 17 to 27.
   Before the students tackle their first assignment, each is tested
to determine how much he or she knows.
   ``Most of these people dropped out of school in about the ninth
grade, but what we've found is that most of them are on a second or
third grade level academically,'' Waltzer said.
   Once class starts, the rules are simple: Study and don't cut
class.
   One unexcused absence means a weekend in jail, two and the
student is off probation and in prison. For those who stay out of
trouble, the five years' probation ends as soon as the student earns
a high school diploma.
   ``It's tough, that lady doesn't let you slip up,'' said Charles
Carter, 26, who has been a student in the program from the
beginning. ``Sometimes you've been working and you're tired and you
don't want to come, but you have to. I like it, though. I like the
reading, anyway. I don't like the division and English, but I'm
learning it too.''
   Carter, convicted of drug possession, said he hopes to get his
diploma this spring and enter barber school.
   Roosevelt Thomas, 21, convicted of carrying a concealed weapon,
said he would like to go to college and perhaps become a lawyer.
   ``That's what my mama wanted me to be. I got a lot of court
experience already,'' he joked.
   Once he's earned a high school degree, Thomas said, he also has
another goal in mind.
   ``I want to be like these fellows,'' he said, nodding toward the
tutors bent over students around the big courtroom. ``I want to come
back here and teach some other people. I want to help someone else
learn this stuff.''
   Waltzer's program can handle no more than 30 students at a time,
she said, although many more could benefit from it.
   ``I could really put people in the program like crazy. Nobody
knows how to read or write anymore,'' she said.
   The judge said she would like to see the Louisiana Legislature
require _ and fund _ a program such as hers. In the meantime, she
scrounges for the money needed for books and other materials. The
program is funded solely by contributions.
   ``What is so nice is that we can really turn these people around.
We can give them a chance,'' she said. ``It's not much, but for most
of them, it's more than they ever got before.''

<HEAD>Private Claims Stemming From Yellowstone Fires Reach $1.1 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Businesses and residents
have filed $1.1 million in damage claims against the federal
government from fires that raged through Yellowstone National Park
and surrounding forests last summer, forest officials say.
   U.S. Forest Service officials are processing the more than two
dozen claims, which will be passed on to U.S. General Counsel's
Office, said Arlene Bateman, who is handling claims filed through
the Forest Service's Region II office in Missoula, Mont.
   The government attorneys will then review each claim to determine
whether negligence or nature caused the damage, Bateman said last
week. ``Decisions on claims could be months away,'' she said.
   More than 700,000 acres of the 2.2 million-acre park were
blackened last summer and fall when a dozen fires burned throughout
Yellowstone. The forest service's policy to allow fires started by
nature to burn unless they threatened lives, property or historic
sites generated enormous controversy that has still not been
resolved.
   Bateman is processing 16 claims totaling $525,000 stemming from
the Storm Creek fire, which burned south from Custer National Forest
in Montana into Yellowstone. Residents of Cooke City and Silver
Gate, Mont., were forced to evacuate.
   Among the claims are requests for restitution for damage to
cabins and fences, a motel, an outfitting camp, a water system, and
timber and grasslands, said Bateman.
   Similar claims totaling $573,000 from fires in Shoshone National
Forest are being reviewed in the Forest Service's Denver office.
Those stem primarily from the loss of 10 mobile homes in a
subdivision northwest of Cody.
   One outfitter is claiming $18,000 in losses of income and
supplies, said Betty Chisholm, who processes claims for the Forest
Service's Rocky Mountain Region based in Denver.
   No claims have been filed thus far through the agency's
Intermountain Region offices in Ogden, Utah.
   Yellowstone spokesman Joan Anzelmo said there are several small
claims for personal property loss within the park, including claims
from employees of the park's concessionaire, TW Recreational
Services, Inc., and firefighters who lost personal items such as
watches and glasses.

   U.S. Ambassador Edward Perkins
unveiled a bust of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. on Monday and
suggested South Africa could learn from the civil rights leader's
philosophy of non-violence.
   Perkins, the first black U.S. ambassador to South Africa,
acknowledged important differences between the two countries. ``But
searching for non-violent solutions is probably something worth
thinking about'' in South Africa, he said.
   Perkins joined Zenos Frudakis, the Philadelphia sculptor who made
the bronze bust, in unveiling it under a tent at a Pretoria site
where a new U.S. Embassy is to be built.
   The event coincided with a federal holiday in the United States
honoring King, who was assassinated in 1968. He would have been 60
years old Sunday.
   The 125 onlookers at the bust unveiling included black and white
South Africans prominent in campaigns against apartheid, and a
low-level representative from the South African Ministry of Foreign
Affairs.
   A 30-member choir from the Roman Catholic church of St. Peter
Claver in Mamelodi, a black township near Pretoria, sang several
civil rights hymns. Women in red headscarves and conical hats woven
from grass mingled with dark-suited diplomats.
   One hymn was ``Senatla Martin Luther King.'' Senatla means leader
in the Sotho language.
   Enos Mabuza, chief minister of South Africa's KaNgwane black
homeland, told the gathering there were striking parallels between
the racial separation in South African today and segregation in the
United States during King's lifetime. A major difference, he said,
was that the U.S. Constitution protects individual rights but South
African laws ``protect white privilege and white-minority rule.''
   Mabuza said ``the black people in this country have realized that
the oppressor will never voluntarily give freedom to the oppressed.
The oppressed must demand that freedom.''
   Perkins participated later in a ceremony at the U.S. consulate in
Durban, where representatives of two feuding black political
organizations held hands during the singing of ``We Shall Overcome.''
   Archie Gumede, co-president of the banned United Democratic
Front, held hands with Frank Mdlalose, a member of the Inkatha Zulu
political group and a health minister in the KwaZulu black homeland
government. Supporters of Inkatha and the UDF have been fighting
each other in the Natal province townships for more than 18 months,
resulting in more than 1,000 deaths.
   Standing in the consulate garden overlooking the Indian Ocean,
Perkins read most of King's ``Letter from a Birmingham Jail.''
Blacks in the audience of about 200 murmured sympathetically at
King's description of police assaults on blacks.

<HEAD>Official Human Rights Group Says Psychiatric Hospitals Still a Question</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANN IMSE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An official human rights commission that has helped
free 400 religious prisoners last year has been unable to break a
wall of silence around Soviet psychiatric hospitals, its chairman
said Monday.
   Fyodor Burlatsky, a journalist who heads a Soviet commission
reviewing human rights cases, was praised by foreign counterparts on
the East-West Conference on Human Rights for winning freedom for
nearly every religious prisoner held in a Soviet prison or labor
camp.
   But Burlatsky had to admit that ``despite our exhaustive efforts,
we have failed to receive information on what happened in
psychiatric hospitals in the past or currently.''
   Lacking expertise, his committee helped foreign psychiatrists
visit the hospitals, but they have been unable to draw clear-cut
conclusions, he said.
   Psychiatric hospitals once under the control of security
officials have been transferred to the Ministry of Health, and
managers are being replaced, he said. Still, his committee is taking
issue with two entire categories of mental diagnosis: ``social
delusion'' and ``slow-going schizophrenia.''
   ``I think these two can be found in many members of the public,''
he said dryly.
   Just two hours before Burlatsky spoke at the news conference, an
editor of the unofficial publication Express-Khronika called The
Associated Press to report one of its staff members had been
detained by police and taken to a Moscow mental hospital.
   Vladimir Ryabakon said contributor Vyatislav Dikterov was being
held in psychiatric Hospital No. 1. Dikterov won government
attention in August by writing to the defense minister to refuse
being drafted into the Red Army on religious and political grounds,
Ryabakon said. He said he had no idea what prompted the detention
Monday.
   Last week, the head of the Soviet psychiatrists' society told
Tass, ``There are no patients in mental hospitals in the U.S.S.R.
who are there for political reasons.'' Georgy Morozov's statement
came the day after Moscow dissidents said it was a continuing
problem.
   Overall, the Western leaders of the East-West Conference had
strong praise for their Soviet counterparts.
   Virtually all of the 400 people on a list of prisoners presented
to the Soviets when the East-West Conference was created a year ago
have been freed, said Patrick Cormack, a Conservative member of the
British Parliament. Cormack said he expects similar results on the
list of 30 names he brought to this week's meeting.
   ``We live in a magic time'' of progress on both arms control and
human rights, said Rev. Theodore Hesburgh, president of the
University of Notre Dame. Committee members said hundreds of
thousands of Bibles are entering the Soviet Union unimpeded.
   Rosalynn Carter, wife of former President Jimmy Carter and
co-chairman of the conference with Burlatsky, said she wants to see
the Soviet Union create legal guarantees of human rights, and that
does appear to be happening.
   Mrs. Carter said the East-West conference was unique in that it
began with each participant criticizing his own nation's human
rights situation. She said she pointed to U.S. problems with
homelessness, unemployment and racial discrimination.
   As his three priorities for his own nation, Burlatsky named
religious freedom, first in practice and then in law; legal
protection of human rights; and legalization of unofficial citizens'
groups.
   Burlatsky said he hopes the Soviet Union will pass a law
guaranteeing freedom of relgion this year, but he added that the
first draft has ``a major problem.'' He said it is being written by
bureaucrats with no contribution from religious believers, and
predicted ``dozens, hundreds, thousands of amendments'' before it is
finished.

<HEAD>Barenboim Says Mitterrand Must Settle Opera-Bastille Dispute</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARILYN AUGUST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Paris Opera, Act 2: Daniel Barenboim insists that
President Francois Mitterrand decide whether he should be fired as
musical and artistic director by a lord of fashion, who happens to
be the opera's chairman.
   Monday's key scene: The noted conductor tells a news conference,
``It is for him to choose between my presence and that of the
international artistic community I have gathered and the program of
the chief executive of a couture house.
   ``I am unwilling to have a chief executive of a fashion house
tell me who can sing what role, decide if Pierre Boulez is capable
of conducting an orchestra or whether we have the right to invite
Herbert von Karajan.''
   Pierre Berge, chairman of the Opera-Bastille and president of the
Yves Saint-Laurent fashion house, dismissed Barenboim on Friday on
grounds he wanted too much money.
   Barenboim said Monday he had not received official notification
of his dismissal and would continue ``with difficulty'' as musical
and artistic director of the Opera-Bastille, currently under
construction.
   Agence France-Presse, the French news agency, quoted sources
close to Barenboim later as saying a letter from Berges about the
dismissal was hand-delivered to the conductor. It said the letter
was dated Jan. 14, Saturday.
   Berge has said the dispute could delay the first opera production
at the Opera-Bastille, scheduled for Jan. 10, 1990.
   If Barenboim goes, so might Patrice Chereau, director of the
first production, along with musical talent including Boulez, Jessye
Norman, von Karajan and Sir Georg Solti, who have expressed
solidarity with Barenboim and threatened to leave if he does.
   Trouble has been brewing for weeks at the high-tech music
complex. It pits Barenboim, the Argentine-born Israeli conductor and
concert pianist who has led the Orchestre de Paris for 15 years,
against Berge, the financial wizard behind Yves Saint-Laurent's
fashion empire.
   According to Berge, paying Barenboim $1.1 million a year for four
months spent in Paris is unreasonable. He says the opera made a
counteroffer of $628,570 a year for two years, to replace the
original four-year contract, but it was rejected.
   Berge was appointed by the Socialist government, formed last
year. Barenboim received his post from the previous conservative
government.
   The Culture Ministry broke its silence Monday night and issued a
statement supporting Berge. It said his ``mission is to assure that
the objectives set by government authorities since 1982 are
respected: to create a modern, national opera, popular and meeting
the highest artistic demands.''
   It said Berge acted in the context of two guiding principles:
``the independent management of the establishment and respect for
budgetary constraints imposed by public authorities. Berge made
choices that appeared to him to best assure the opening of the
Bastille Opera.''
   Barenboim, 46, told his news conference earlier: ``It is
abhorrent to me to treat a cultural problem as a political problem,
but it has become one.
   ``The contract I signed in July 1987 was under a different
government, but the president is the same, and that's why he's the
only person who can make the choice.
   ``I am unwilling to have a chief executive of a fashion house
tell me who can sing what role, decide if Pierre Boulez is capable
of conducting an orchestra or whether we have the right to invite
Herbert von Karajan.''
   Responding on French television, Berge said he did not want to
involve Mitterrand. ``It would become a political affair,'' he said.
``It is an affair of big bucks.''
   Money, said Barenboim, was not his ``guiding force,'' and he
would willingly take a salary cut of 20 percent. He also said the
contract requires him to be in Paris seven months a year, not four.
   ``These lies and half-truths are unacceptable,'' he declared.
   Another point of contention involves the number of performances
each year.
   An opera house that will cost more than $400 million and is
intended for the widest possible audience should provide 220
performances, says Berge. That's not realistic, says Barenboim.
   ``You cannot possibly expect a new building to start off
functioning like a 50- or 100-year-old institution,'' Barenboim
said, adding that he hoped to get the Opera-Bastille up to
``cruising speed'' in three to five years.
   When it opens, the Opera-Bastille will be the only opera house in
Paris and the ornate old Palais Garnier, the Paris Opera, which will
be reserved for dance.
   Carlos Ott of Canada designed the glassy, boat-shaped structure,
which dominates the Place de la Bastille and is one of several
architectural projects Mitterrand hopes will improve the eastern
part of the city.

<HEAD>Reagan Weighs Limited Operations By American Firms In Libya</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MERRILL HARTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan is considering executive
action to relax a prohibition on American oil companies doing
business in Libya, an administration official said Monday.
   This official, discussing the possibility of such a move before
Reagan's term ends at midday Friday, said administration officials
are concerned that retaining the ban would have the effect of
helping Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi to eventually seize the firms'
assets.
   ``It's a `Catch-22' here,'' said the official, declining to be
named publicly. ``If things remain the same (concerning the status
of U.S. oil firms), they could benefit Gadhafi. It could result in a
windfall for Gadhafi.''
   In a move that was related to broad economic sanctions imposed
against Libya nearly three years ago, but which wasn't a direct part
of those punitive measures, Reagan signed an order which forbade
five American firms from extracting oil in the African nation.
   In the wake of that order, however, the five firms signed an
agreement with Gadhafi in which the Libyan leader in effect froze
the firms' 49 percent interest in the Libyan state oil company,
while continuing to use the U.S. installations, paying the costs of
operations and reaping the profits.
   That agreement with Gadhafi expires on June 30, and U.S. oil
industry officials have said they fear that unless the prohibition
on American operations is eased, the Libyan strongman will declare
the contract violated and seize the U.S. assets.
   ``No decisions have been made, but there has been discussion''
about easing the sanctions, the administration official said.
``There are some problems with these sanctions. ... Any changes that
might be made would not be done to ease (overall) sanctions on
Libya. ... I can guarantee you that.''
   The 1986 agreement froze the assets of the five American
companies _ Amerada Hess, Marathon Oil, W.R. Grace, Occidental
Petroleum and Conoco Petroleum.
   Don Herring, a spokesman for Marathon, said the company had no
information about the administration's plans.
   ``We've had no word on it from any State Department officials,''
he said.
   Herring said company chairman David Roderick had said last month
that Marathon would be interested in returning to its Libyan
operations if the oil restrictions were lifted.
   A lifting of the restrictions by Reagan could permit the
companies to resume doing business in Libya, perhaps through
subsidiaries or third-party connections, or they could sell their
assets before the contract expires, said the The New York Times,
which initially reported the story in Monday editions.
   Reagan recently renewed the overall program of economic sanctions
imposed against Libya in February 1986. In April of that year, he
authorized a U.S. fighter jet attack on Tripoli in reprisal for
Libya's alleged role in a terrorist bombing incident in West
Germany. An American soldier was killed in the discotheque bombing
in West Berlin.
   There have been new tensions between the United States and Libya
in connection with the construction of a facility that the Americans
maintain is designed to manufacture chemical weapons. Earlier this
month, American F-16 fighter jets shot down two Libyan aircraft over
the Mediterranean Gulf.

<HEAD>Exiled Ugandan Dictator Rejected By Saudi Hosts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALY MAHMOUD</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Former Ugandan dictator Idi Amin is
unwelcome at his home-in-exile in Saudi Arabia, Arab diplomatic
sources said Monday.
   ``His nagging desire to recapture power in Kampala has
embarrassed his Saudi hosts and put his African sympathizers on the
spot,'' said a Riyadh-based Arab ambassador, who insisted on
anonymity.
   Amin, 61, slipped out of Saudi Arabia earlier this month and
surfaced Jan. 10 in Zaire on a false passport with one of his sons.
   Uganda's government has demanded his extradition, probably to
appear before a presidential commission investigating atrocities
under previous regimes.
   Amin's wife and 22 of his children still are in the Saudi Red Sea
port of Jidda, but he finally has alienated his hosts by traveling
to Zaire on false documents.
   ``Idi Amin has gone too far this time, stretching the rules of
Saudi hospitality to the limits,'' said the Arab ambassador. ``He
has been quietly looked upon as persona non grata and won't be
allowed to return.''
   Zaire refused to have Amin and sent him to Senegal to catch a
flight to Riyadh. But Saudi officials barred him from boarding the
plane and the Senegalese returned him to Kinshasa, the capital of
Zaire.
   His predicament has drawn no public comment from Saudi officials.
   The master sergeant who became one of Africa's most ruthless
dictators was ousted from his East African nation in April 1979. He
gained political asylum in Saudi Arabia in 1980, after Libyan leader
Col. Moammar Gadhafi refused to harbor him.
   Amin emerged from relative obscurity in 1981 to unveil to The
Associated Press his plans to conquer Uganda. He said he was
grateful to Saudi leaders for accommodating him and his family in a
Jidda villa. The Saudis also gave him a monthly allowance, two cars
and a telephone.
   This was on the understanding he keep a low profile, shun the
press and quit politics. But, according to sources close to Amin,
the dream of retaking power has haunted Amin.
   Amin apparently believed Saudi Arabia would use its oil-generated
clout to reinstate him as president of Uganda.
   Saudi Arabia maintained cordial ties with successive governments
in Uganda, which has known near-constant civil war since its 1962
independence from Britain.
   Amin's frequent outbursts against Ugandan administrations
obviously embarrassed the Saudis.
   ``He abused the telephone, and his monthly bills frequently ran
up to tens of thousands of riyals (dollars), with calls to his
followers in African capitals and press reporters in Arab and
European countries,'' said a Saudi businessman with government
connections. ``When the school in Jidda complained about Amin not
paying his children's school fees, the (Saudi) government hastened
to foot the bills.''
   Two years ago, the Saudis disconnected the telephone.
   Despite Saudi obstruction, Amin would sneak out of his villa for
interviews with Western reporters at downtown hotels.
   He often boasted in interviews of his ``services to Islam'' and
claimed he converted more than 6 million Ugandans to Islam. Only 6
percent of Uganda's 15 million people are Moslems. More than 60
percent are Christians and the rest are animists.
   Some press reports on his eight-year tyranny, during which tens
of thousands of his political opponents and innocent civilians were
killed, alleged the dictator practiced cannibalism. The reports
never were verified.
   ``Do I look like a cannibal?'' he once said in an interview.
``No, I am not. I'm a good Moslem and will live and die a good
Moslem. I'm a poor man without any money.''

<HEAD>Next President An Optimist On The Domestic Front</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   George Bush is an optimist when it comes to
domestic matters.
   He has pledged to do what needs to be done in the battle against
AIDS, provide better care for the unborn children of the pregnant
poor, give the homeless a roof over their heads and lead the
legislative battle against acid raid.
   And, oh yes, he wants to be the education president.
   All without raising taxes.
   ``Read my lips,'' the man who becomes president Friday said in
accepting his party's nomination last August. ``No new taxes.''
   When George Bush finds a problem demanding solution, he often
looks for answers that spring from his ``thousand points of light''
_ the efforts of volunteers plus state and local initiatives _ or at
least for ones that don't involve new federal bureaucracies.
   The next president, who during the campaign named an AIDS
researcher as his personal hero, has said that, if more resources
are needed for the fight against the deadly virus, he will provide
them.
   Poor women are bearing babies with little or no prenatal care?
Make the states cover them under Medicaid, with Washington splitting
the bills, he advises.
   What about the homeless? Fully fund a two-year-old law to give
the homeless emergency shelter grants, health care programs and
educational opportunities.
   The environment? Bush calls himself an environmentalist from way
back, has appointed a conservationist to head the Environmental
Protection Agency and promised to hold a global conference by year's
end on the environment. He has said he will send Congress tough
legislation to curb acid rain.
   Education? Bush has proposed at least $600 million in new
education aid, including $500 million for a program to reward
schools that achieve excellence in educating poor children.
   Beyond that, he plans to bring all the nation's governors
together soon for a summit on education with university presidents
and other educators.
   Bush has also promised an all-out war on illicit drugs, vowed to
name judges with ``a little more compassion for the victim than the
criminal'' and has said the rules governing the admission of
illegally seized evidence into court should be relaxed.
   He also has promised to build more federal prisons, doubling
capacity by the mid-1990s at a cost of hundreds of millions of
dollars.
   He has proposed spending $2.2 billion on tax credits and other
support for child care, primarily targeted at low-income families.
   The next president, as he campaigned for the White House, pledged
to help first-time homebuyers by allowing then to get a Federal
Housing Administration mortgage with as little as $1,000 down.
   For the poor, Bush's choice as secretary of housing and urban
development, Jack Kemp, has promoted the issuance of vouchers,
making private housing more affordable, and tenant takeover of
public housing projects.
   Rather than expanding Medicare to help the elderly meet the
staggering cost of nursing homes, the instincts of George Bush the
optimist will be to tinker with the tax code to provide incentives
for people to arrange their own long-term care insurance, either
through group plans or by converting their Individual Retirement
Accounts.
   While Bush and Ronald Reagan, another optimist, share a
conservative instinct that Washington doesn't always know best, the
next president does not harbor the hostility toward government that
has been a hallmark of Reagan's political career.
   Bush, the son of a financer who gave up Wall Street for the
Senate, had public service instilled in his genes. He walked away
from the oil fields of Texas two decades ago with only a modest
fortune to pursue that goal, first representing Houston in Congress,
then serving as ambassador to the United Nations, envoy to China and
director of the Central Intelligence Agency.

   Rival Shiite Moslems militias vowed
revenge Monday as they buried victims of their battles in south
Lebanon.
   The Syrian-backed Amal militiamen and pro-Iranian Hezbollah
clashed before dawn Monday in Beirut's southern slums for the third
time in 24 hours, police said. Two people were killed and five
wounded in the street battles, they said.
   ``We shall take revenge! It shall be merciless!'' chanted 1,500
zealots of the Hezbollah, or Party of God, during a funeral
procession for four combatants in south Beirut's Bir el-Abed
district.
   Their procession for ``Lovers of Jihad (Holy War)'' was sparsely
attended for fear of car bombs, they said. Last Friday, a powerful
car bomb exploded in the same district minutes after thousands of
Hezbollahis staged a protest. Seven people were killed and 15
wounded.
   Hezbollahis at Monday's funeral also intoned ``Death to the
criminal of south Beirut!'' and ``Berri, Berri you Satan!''
   Nabih Berri heads the rival mainstream Amal which Hezbollah has
been fighting on and off for nine months in a struggle to dominate
Lebanon's 1 million Shiites, the nation's largest sect.
   At the same time Monday, 7,000 mourners staged a funeral in the
southern port of Tyre for three Amal victims. ``Death to Iran! Death
to Khomeini!'' they chanted in reference to the Iranian leader,
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
   The two factions held burial processions elsewhere in south and
east Lebanon for 13 other victims whose corpses were among 20
removed Sunday by the Red Cross from the Apple Province village of
Jbaa. It was the scene of some of the heaviest fighting until the
Lebanese Red Cross arranged a mercy cease-fire to collect corpses
Sunday.
   Hezbollah advocates the establishment of an Iranian-style Islamic
republic in Lebanon.
   The more secular and nationalist Amal believes Moslems can share
power with the Christians who traditionally dominate Lebanese
politics. Amal resents Iran's influence and has been fighting since
April to evict Hezbollah from Beirut's Shiite-populated southern
slums and predominantly Shiite south Lebanon.
   Their latest confrontation started in south Beirut Dec. 31 and
spread to south Lebanon within a day.
   Since then, 168 combatants and civilians have been killed and 315
wounded.

   The high Friday is expected to be in the mid-40s, the National

   Four years ago, outdoor inaugural events had to be canceled in
the face of bitter cold.
   For this Inauguration Day, skies are expected to be partly

   Prime Minister Sadek Mahdi on Monday
announced a 150 percent increase in government-set sugar prices less
than three weeks after similar rises sent thousands to the streets
in protest.
   Mahdi also said he approved recommendations for economic reforms
presented by a committee of trade and professional unions. The panel
was formed after the riots.
   The recommendations include a reduction in government spending,
new taxes on luxury goods, and an increase in the price of
cigarettes. However, Mahdi gave no details.
   The Dec. 29 protests, which left four people dead, forced the
government to roll back the price increases it imposed to pay for
salary increases of up to 500 percent announced two days earlier.
   The price increases as announced then reached 600 percent for
sugar, a basic commodity. The measures also included 60 percent
increases on cigarettes and a 15 percent tax on locally manufactured
goods.
   Mahdi said Monday that sugar would be sold at two prices, a
subsidized price of 11 cents a pound in government stores and an
unregulated price in other markets. The previous sugar price was
just over 4 cents a pound.
   Sudan suffers from chronic food shortages, a $14 billion foreign
debt, and a civil war in the south.

   Former Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos
remained in a hospital Monday, suffering from pneumonia and
bronchial asthma, a nursing supervisor said.
   Marcos, 71, has been hospitalized three times in little more than
a month. He was resting in guarded condition Monday at Saint Francis
Medical Center after being admitted Sunday afternoon, according to a
hospital spokeswoman.
   Marcos spokesman Gemmo Trinidad said Marcos was in the intensive
care unit and not allowed to have visitors, except for his wife,
Imelda, and a few close aides.
   ``He's just resting,'' Trinidad said. ``I don't know how he got
pneumonia, but he's very weak and I guess that makes it more likely
for him to get sick.''
   Marcos' doctors, who have been monitoring his condition since he
was last released from the hospital Jan. 5, decided that he should
return, Trinidad said, adding that Marcos would remain hospitalized
at least until Tuesday.
   Marcos' two previous hospital stays, one for nine days and the
other for seven, were for treatment of congestive heart failure, his
doctors said.
   A federal court hearing was scheduled Thursday in New York to
determine if Marcos is healthy enough to travel there for
arraignment on racketeering charges.
   An indictment returned Oct. 21 accused the Marcoses of plundering
more than $100 million from their homeland and using the money to
buy art and real estate in Manhattan. Mrs. Marcos is free on $5
million bail after pleading innocent to the charges in New York.

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union will start its unilateral
withdrawal of troops from Eastern Europe in April, Moscow's deputy
defense minister said Monday on Austrian television.
   Deputy Defense Minister Vitaly Shabanov told Austrian TV's Moscow
correspondent the partial withdrawal of 50,000 troops from Hungary,
Czechoslovakia and East Germany announced last month by President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev will take place in two phases.
   The first phase will be complete this year, and the second in
1990, Shabanov said.
   ``We assume it will begin in the coming April,'' Shabanov was
quoted as saying.
   Hungarian Communist Party leader Karoly Grosz was quoted as
telling a Japanese newspaper last week that the withdrawal of Soviet
troops from his country would begin within weeks, but fixed no date.
   Hungarian Defense Minister Ferenc Karpati, interviewed by The
Associated Press in Budapest after Grosz's comments, declined to set
a date for the partial withdrawal of the estimated 62,000 Soviet
troops in Hungary.
   Hungary gave an enthusiastic welcome to Gorbachev's announcement
Dec. 7 that 50,000 Soviet troops and 5,000 tanks would be withdrawn
as part of a worldwide reduction of Red Army forces by half a
million men in the next two years.
   In Prague, Czechoslovakia, on Monday, Soviet ambassador Vladimir
Lomakin announced that one Soviet division would be withdrawn soon
from that country.
   According to an account of Lomakin's statement by the state news
agency CTK, Lomakin said that further troop withdrawals depend ``on
the attitude of NATO countries and the development of the
international situation.''
   Czechoslovakia has had an estimated 80,000 Soviet troops
stationed on its territory since the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact invasion
of 1968 to crush reforms.
   On Saturday, the 16 NATO nations and seven Warsaw Pact allies
signed a mandate for new arms talks for reducing conventional troops
and weapons across Europe.
   Gorbachev has presented his unilateral withdrawal of Soviet
troops from Eastern Europe as a gesture intended to give impetus to
those new negotiations, due to start in Vienna in March.
   Lomakin also said that Moscow would like to see all foreign
troops and military bases on the territory of other states
eliminated by 2000.
   Unlike its allies Poland and Hungary, Czechoslovakia has not so
far announced any cuts in its own defense spending.
   Hungary, which has the East bloc's largest per capita foreign
debt of $17 billion, has said it will cut defense spending by 17
percent in real terms this year, compared with 1988.
   Poland has also announced it will trim its military spending.

   North Korea on Monday accepted a
proposal from rival South Korea for their prime ministers to lead
the highest level military and political talks since the Korean War.
   ``The north and south should remove the state of tension which is
driving the same people toward disaster and prepare a firm
foundation for peaceful unification,'' North Korean Prime Minister
Yon Hyung Mok said in a letter agreeing to the proposal from Prime
Minister Kang Young-hoon of South Korea.
   Korea's peninsula still faces the threat of war and tension has
to be defused, said the letter.
   It proposed a Feb. 8 meeting of vice ministers at Panmunjom truce
site to work out terms for the talks. No date was mentioned for the
main talks, and the two sides are expected to have problems agreeing
on terms.
   Observers consider a major diplomatic breakthrough unlikely as
long as North Korean leader Kim Il Sung remains in power. Kim
ordered the 1950 North Korean invasion of the south that started the
war.
   Yon's sometimes caustic letter repeated North Korea's call for
separate three-way talks with South Korea and the United States on
reducing tension. The north also demanded an end to annual South
Korean-U.S. ``Team Spirit'' military exercises and accused
Washington of planning a nuclear war.
   ``It is obvious to everyone that the north and south cannot
fundamentally resolve the question of peace by setting aside the
United States, which is the party responsible for the aggravation of
tension,'' the letter said.
   South Korea and the United States have rejected three-way talks,
saying negotiations should be between the two Koreas. The United
States has 42,000 troops based in the south under a mutual defense
treaty against the north.
   South Korean officials have warned that North Korea wants to use
the talks to secure withdrawal of the U.S. forces.
   In his letter Monday, the North Korean premier said the proposed
talks also should focus on halting ``large-scale provocative
military exercises.''
   Talks between legislators from the two sides ran into trouble
last month after the north suddenly demanded an end to South
Korean-U.S. military exercises. The demand came as the two sides
appeared close to agreeing terms for parliamentary talks on a
non-aggression pact.
   Lawmakers are due to meet again next month.
   U.S. and Soviet forces divided the Korean peninsula in 1945 when
they ended Japan's occupation at the end of World War II.
   The two nations have clashed since then and keep hundreds of
thousands of heavily armed troops along the 150-mile border. The
frontier is sealed and there are no communication links except a
single hot line.
   South Korea agreed last month to North Korea's call for
high-level political and military talks and proposed prime ministers
head the delegations to make the discussion the most important since
the war.

   The first official Jewish culture center will
open in Moscow next month, kicking off a three-week festival in
major Soviet cities that reflects a dramatic change in the Kremlin's
human rights policy, the World Jewish Congress announced Monday.
   ``The center represents a historic softening of Soviet policy
towards its Jewish minority, signifying the first official
recognition by the Soviet government of the right of Jews to
participate in their national cultural heritage,'' said a statement
issued by the New York-based organization, which negotiated the
agreement.
   Elie Wiesel, who won the Nobel Prize for peace, will speak at the
opening ceremony on Feb. 12, followed by a concert of Jewish singers
from the United States, Israel and Australia at Moscow's prestigious
Tchaikovsky Hall, the World Jewish Congress said. The concert will
be the first of a series of nine in Moscow, Leningrad and Tblisi.
   Word of the agreement with the Soviet Ministry of Culture came as
leaders of 35 nations from East and West met in Vienna to sign a
landmark pact on human rights. Arriving at the conference, U.S.
Secretary of State George P. Shultz credited the Soviets and their
East European allies with adopting more open societies.
   ``Real progress has been made, particularly in the last two or
three years,'' he said.
   Some of the most significant progress has affected the estimated
2.5 million Jews living in the Soviet Union, who had been prevented
from practicing their religion and culture and from leaving the
country. Since the liberalization policies of Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev have gone into effect, Jewish emigration has risen from an
estimated 900 people in 1986 to about 19,300 in 1988.
   The new cultural center will be named after Yiddish actor Solomon
Mykhoels who was murdered during the Stalinist purges of 1948. His
daughter and granddaughter will be allowed to come from Israel to
attend the opening, the WJC said. Yiddish theater and culture
flourished in the Soviet Union up to World War II.
   The center will offer books and films, as well as art exhibits
and Hebrew classes. The study of Hebrew was once punishable by
imprisonment.
   As part of the cultural activities, the Los Angeles-based Simon
Wiesenthal Center will provide an exhibit on the Holocaust, and
Israeli artists and poets will exhibit their works.

   Libya has granted political asylum to
former Burundi President Jean Baptiste Bagaza, who was toppled in a
1987 military coup, a newspaper reported Monday.
   Bagaza and his wife left Sunday on a flight to Libya after he
obtained asylum there, according to the government-owned newspaper
New Vision. He had been living in Uganda since shortly after the
bloodless coup that ousted him.
   Military officers, led by Burundi's current president, Maj.
Pierre Buyoya, ousted Bagaza on Sept. 3, 1987, ending his 11-year
rule.
   Bagaza said he should be allowed to return to Burundi because he
has not been found guilty of any wrongdoing, the newspaper reported.
   Burundi, a landlocked East African nation, has been torn by
tribal strife between the ruling Tutsi and the majority Hutu. The
latest major clash came in August, when 5,000 people were killed and
more than 40,000 fled to neighboring Rwanda. Buyoya and Bagaza
belong to the Tutsi tribe.

<HEAD>Proposal Would Shift Some Firefighting Expense to States</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan's budget planners have
suggested that states assume some of the cost of fighting fires on
federal lands, a proposal that could cost states millions of dollars
in forfeited revenue from timber and mineral leases.
   It was not immediately clear whether the Bush administration will
adopt the suggestion, which was outlined in the Interior
Department's proposed fiscal l990 budget releases last week.
   The budget calls for the development of a permanent federal
firefighting fund of $166.5 million so that in the years to come the
department will not have to seek extra money from Congress or pay
the bill in subsequent years.
   The department's fiscal 1990 budget, for example, includes a
request for $145 million to pay for part of the firefighting costs
at Yellowstone National Park last year.
   A similar fund would be established in the Agricutlure Department
which funds the Forest Service firefighting programs, officials said.
   The firefighting would be funded from receipts received by the
government from timber and mining activities on federal land.
According to estimates, the firefighting fund would reduce those
total receipts in fiscal l990 by about 18 percent.
   States and local governments share those receipts with the
Interior Department.
   To states and local governments, the establishment of a
firefighting fund would mean a loss of more than $84 million as a
result of a reduction in their share of the mineral and timber
revenues, according to Interior Department estimates.
   The proposal requires congressional approval and is likely to
meet resistance from some western states, whose officials argue that
the federal government should assume the costs of fighting fires on
federal land.

   Families in some rural areas of China are finding
marriage partners for children as young as seven and eight, a
newspaper said Monday.
   Childhood engagements in the coastal province of Zhejiang have
resulted in illegal marriages and disrupted efforts to hold down
population growth, according to the overseas edition of the People's
Daily.
   Surveys found that in rural areas around Wenzhou, a city noted
for its prosperous private entrepreneurs, 86 percent of children 14
years old or younger were engaged. Engagements at age seven or eight
were common, the newspaper said.
   In the vicinity of Huzhou, another Zhejiang city near Shanghai,
40 percent of teen-agers had mates picked for them, it said.
   The daily said the young people often begin living with each
other before the legal ages for marriages _ 20 for women and 22 for
men _ creating havoc for birth control programs.
   The arranged marriages, often between families with blood ties,
has led to the birth of disabled children and unhappy pairings
resulting in divorce.
   The Chinese government has discouraged arranged marriages, but
the practice remains common in tradition-bound rural areas. The
official press also has reported that bride selling still is
prevalent in rural areas, particularly in poverty belts where
farmers can earn several years' worth of income by selling a
daughter into marriage.
   The People's Daily urged youth leagues, legal organizations and
family planning offices to educate people that it is wrong to
arrange marriages for children. It said parents who agree to
engagements for their children should be punished and fined.

<HEAD>Cambodian Rebels Say Vietnam Sends Soldiers Uniformed As Cambodians</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cambodian rebels have challenged Vietnam's
assertions it is removing its forces from Cambodia and claimed Hanoi
has sent 40,000 more soldiers disguised as local troops, according
to a letter released Monday.
   In the letter to U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar,
resistance representative Thiounn Prasith said Vietnam had tricked
the international community into believing it is pulling out its
soldiers after 10 years of occupation.
   The letter was released the same day China announced it had begun
talks with Vietnamese officials in Beijing on the Cambodian
conflict. They were the first face-to-face meetings of high-level
officials from the two countries in more than nine years.
   Vietnam had said it would withdraw 50,000 of its approximately
140,000 troops from Cambodia, also called Kampuchea, by the end of
1988. It says it will pull out all its forces by late 1989 or early
1990.
   However, Thiounn Prasith wrote that Vietnam instead sent in
14,500 fresh troops in December alone and a total of 40,000 new
soldiers from June-December 1988.
   ``The Hanoi authorities have never stopped sending new
reinforcements, now dressed up as `Khmer soldiers' of the Phnom Penh
puppet regime,'' he said.
   ``The sending of these reinforcements shows clearly that the
Hanoi authorities have not withdrawn their troops from Kampuchea,''
he said. ``Their claim concerning the withdrawal of 50,000 troops
from Kampuchea is actually a propaganda ploy aimed at deceiving
world public opinion,'' he said.
   The United Nations recognizes the three-party resistance
coalition called ``Democratic Kampuchea'' as legitimate
representative of Cambodia rather than the Hanoi-installed
government in Phnom Penh. Thiounn Prasith is the resistance's U.N.
ambassador.
   He said Vietnam actually intends to occupy Cambodia forever.
   Calls to Vietnam's U.N. mission went unanswered. Many foreign
missions closed Monday to observe the birthday of U.S. civil rights
leader Martin Luther King Jr.
   Vietnam invaded Cambodia in late 1978 and the following year
ousted the Khmer Rouge government, which had led a reign of terror
that left at least 1 million people dead.
   The current resistance is a coalition of the Khmer Rouge,
non-communist forces of the Khmer People's National Liberation
Front, and followers of former Cambodian leader Prince Norodom
Sihanouk.
   China has called for a coalition government led by Sihanouk and
including the Khmer Rouge and the Vietnam-backed faction of Heng
Samrin, Cambodia's president.

<TEXT>
   A prosecutor began final arguments
Monday at a trial stemming from a riot at a 1985 soccer match and
said the former leader of a sponsoring group should be condemned for
organizing the event badly.
   On trial are 26 Britons, two Belgian state police, and Albert
Roosens, who was secretary-general of the Belgian soccer federation
at the time of the match.
   On May 29, 1985, British fans at Brussels' Heysel Stadium rushed
stands filled with Italian fans just before a match pitting a
British team against an Italian team in the European Champions' Cup
match. Thirty-nine people died in the panic that followed.
   The riot was one of the worst in European sports history.
   Prosecutor Pierre Erauw concentrated his remarks on Roosens as he
began his closing arguments Monday.
   Erauw said Roosens should be condemned for bad planning. Roosens
is charged with criminal neglect and faces up to two years in jail.
   The prosecutor said ticket sales, which were intended to keep
rival fans in separate parts of the stadium, were badly organized.
He also said the dilapidated stadium was not properly prepared for
the match.
   Erauw said profit, not safety, was the driving force behind the
event.
   ``Too many failures can be blamed on the Belgian soccer
federation and (Albert) Roosens,'' the prosecutor said.
   The British suspects were extradited to Belgium after being
identified from video footage and photographs. They are charged with
involuntary manslaughter.
   The closing remarks by the prosecutor were expected to continue
Tuesday, and the trial is expected to end in March.

   George Bush, who as vice president was part of
an administration criticized for its civil rights record, vowed
Monday to make the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s dream of racial
equality his mission in the White House.
   A day after King's widow, Coretta Scott King, called on Bush to
hold true to his promise of a ``kinder, gentler nation,'' the
president-elect praised the slain civil rights leader as a hero in a
speech to black supporters on the day celebrating King's birth.
   ``He lived a hero's life. He dreamed a hero's dreams. And he left
a hero's indelible mark on the mind and imagination of a great
nation,'' Bush told a breakfast of the American Bicentennial
Presidential Inaugural Afro-American Committee. ``So, today, we
remember the man; we pay tribute to his achievements; and we pledge
once more our nation's sacred honor in continuing pursuit of his
dream.''
   Mrs. King in a Sunday speech at Atlanta's Ebenezer Baptist Church
also urged Bush to impose strict sanctions against South Africa, but
Bush did not mention that subject in his brief remarks.
   Bush retired from public view for the rest of the day,
sequestering himself to work on the inaugural address he will
deliver Friday after he is sworn in as president.
   In statements and meetings with black leaders, Bush has tried to
separate himself from the poor relationship minority groups had with
the Reagan administration, in which he served as vice president for
eight years.
   Lee Atwater, Bush's former campaign manager and the man he chose
to head the Republican National Committee, has a stated goal of
pulling more blacks into the Republican Party. Atwater traveled to
Atlanta to represent the Bush camp at Sunday's King memorial.
   Black leaders have long criticized Reagan as being indifferent to
their cause. Reagan raised the controversy anew in an interview
broadcast Sunday on the CBS television program ``60 Minutes'' by
questioning the motives of some civil rights leaders.
   ``Sometimes I wonder if they really want what they say they want
because some of those leaders are doing very well leading
organizations based on keeping alive the feeling that they're
victims of prejudice,'' Reagan said.
   In 1985, Reagan signed the legislation creating the federal
holiday in honor of King after initially opposing it.
   In his remarks Monday, Bush continued his effort to present his
coming presidency as one that will be sensitive to the concerns of
minorities.
   He called the slain civil rights leader a ``great gift'' from God
to the nation.
   ``What becomes of Martin Luther King's dreams is up to us. We
must not fail him. We must not fail ourselves,'' Bush said. ``And we
must not fail the nation he loved so much and gave his life for. I
understand that _ five days before becoming president of the United
States of America.''
   He recalled the ``moral stain of segregation, the lies it taught,
and the anguish it inflicted on the lives of black Americans and on
the conscience of the entire American people.''
   Bush said King's fight for justice, freedom, peace and equality
will be pursued in years to come, ``that bigotry and indifference to
disadvantage will find no safe home on our shores, in our public
life, in our neighborhoods, or in our home; and that Reverend King's
dream for his children and for ours will be fulfilled.
   ``This must be our mission together. It will, I promise, be my
mission as president of the United States,'' he said.
   Meanwhile, Bush transition team sources said Monday that he has
tapped the vice chairman of General Motors Corp., Donald Atwood Jr.,
for the No. 2 job at the Pentagon. A flurry of other appointment
announcements is expected Tuesday.
   Atwood, 63, is the top choice of John Tower, the defense
secretary-designate, to be deputy secretary. The deputy has
responsibility for the Pentagon's daily operation.
   Atwood has filled management positions at GM for 27 years. As
vice chairman, he supervises divisions that manufacture electronics
and airplane systems for the Pentagon.

   Army gunfire killed two more Palestinian
teen-agers Monday and Israeli politicians expressed concern about
the high rate of casualties in the Arab uprising.
   The deaths brought to 10 the number of Palestinian youths killed
in the past five days and raised to 359 the number killed since the
uprising started more than 13 months ago. Fifteen Israelis also have
died.
   Last month, the number of wounded Palestinians reached a record
monthly high of 492 and 26 died, Israel television said. It said the
high casualty figure resulted in part from the army policy of
pursuing each and every rioter.
   In addition, it said, new regulations allowed soldiers to open
plastic or rubber bullet fire at stone-throwers even when they are
fleeing.
   Cabinet Minister Ehud Olmert, a member of the right-wing Likud
bloc, said on Israel radio that soldiers should protect themselves
against Arab stoning attacks, but that army policies were extracting
a ``terrible price'' from Israel.
   Olmert, who is in charge of Arab affairs for the government, said
he favored tough policies against rioters, but added: ``When I get
up in the morning and hear an Arab boy has been killed, I don't get
up with it well. I don't sleep with it well.''
   He called for troops to use ``judgment and restraint'' in putting
down demonstrations.
   Israeli newspapers reported that other ministers discussed army
policy at a Cabinet meeting Sunday.
   Moshe Shahal of the left-leaning Labor Party reportedly demanded
an account on plastic bullets. Israeli troops began using the
ammunition in August in an effort to reduce fatalities, but the
bullets have caused a number of deaths.
   Inquiries at Palestinian hospitals Monday, meanwhile, showed that
four of the 10 most recent deaths were from a new type of rubber
bullet introduced to halt rioting by stone-throwing Arab youths.
   Clashes were reported Monday between troops and stone-throwers in
six spots in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and officials at Arab
hospitals said 20 people were wounded by army gunfire.
   Hospital officials said one youth was killed and three others
wounded in Hebron on the West Bank. They identified the death youth
as Radwan Abu Sbeih, 17, and said he was shot in the chest.
   Military spokesmen confirmed the death, three injuries in Hebron
and seven other wounds in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank.
   The army said another 17-year-old, Ahmed Abu Mustafa, died Monday
of head wounds he suffered two days earlier in a clash at the Khan
Yunis refugee camp in the Gaza Strip.
   According to Arab reports, rioting broke out in the camp Monday
over Mustafa's death, and eight people were wounded when soldiers
opened fire.
   In Hebron, merchants closed their stores after Monday's shootings
when masked youths, organizers in the Palestinian uprising, ordered
a three-day strike to mourn victims of the violence.
   In the Gaza Strip, families guarded by a military patrol buried a
12-year-old girl and a 17-year-old boy just after midnight, an Arab
reporter said. He said the army ordered the midnight burials to
avoid Palestinian protests.
   Both victims were killed by troops in clashes during the past
week.
   Also Monday, an Israeli bus driver suffered minor injuries when
his but was hit by a firebomb in Arab east Jerusalem, police
reported.
   The bus, which was destroyed by fire, was empty except for the
driver. Police said several Arab suspects were arrested.
   Police lifted a four-day curfew on the Arab village of Silwan,
which also is part of east Jerusalem and was annexed by Israel after
the 1967 Middle East war. Army radio said police used the curfew to
round up about 30 Arabs suspected of throwing stones and
participating in violent protests.

   The bodies of hundreds of Iranian
political prisoners executed in recent weeks have been discovered in
mass graves, the main Iranian opposition group said Monday.
   The Mujahedeen Khalq, or People's Holy Warriors, said more than
94 people alone had been executed in Abhar, west of Tehran, in the
past few weeks.
   The claim came in a statement to The Associated Press in Cyprus
from the group's headquarters in Baghdad, Iraq. There was no
independent confirmation.
   The group has said that more than 12,000 political prisoners have
been executed since August. A United Nations report in November
estimated that 1,100 prisoners had been executed since August.
   The London-based Amnesty International human rights organization
earlier said it believed more than 300 people had been executed
since July and that the total could run into the thousands.
   Iran has denied such reports but has said that scores of
convicted drug smugglers and ``unrepentant'' dissidents have been
executed in Tehran, the nation's capital, and other cities.
   The Mujahedeen quoted witnesses as saying prison guards dug a
large trench near a road in the northern province of Gilan and in
one night buried several truckloads of bodies.
   The statement accused Tehran's Revolutionary Prosecutor's Office
of ``secretly burying a large number of execution victims'' near an
Armenian cemetery on a road north of the city. The graves were ``too
shallow and stray dogs unearthed some of the bodies, which revealed
the site to passers-by,'' the statement said.
   The group also claimed that a large number of victims have been
buried in trenchs in Tehran's sprawling Behshat-e-Zahra cemetery.
   In the central city of Isfahan, prison guards have been taking
the bodies of executed prisoners ``in batches of 100, 60 and 40'' to
a city cemetery for burial in mass graves, the Mujahedeen said.
   To avoid public attention, prison guards dressed as cemetery
employees loaded the bodies on buses whose seats had been removed,
the Mujahedeen's statement said.
   Dissident Iranians claim that the executions are aimed at
eliminating opposition activists amid political uncertainty
following the cease-fire Iran agreed to in August in its war with
Iraq.

<TEXT>
   Research into the link between Type A
behavior and heart disease suggests that the real killer is anger,
not impatience.
   In a study to be published in Psychosomatic Medicine, researchers
described a followup of 118 students who took a personality test
during law school. Twenty-five years later, 20 percent of those who
had scored in the highest quarter on the hostility scale had died,
compared with 5 percent of those who had scored lowest.
   The research showed that being paranoid or neurotic or avoiding
social contact were not associated with heart attacks. Instead,
those at high risk tend to harbor a cynical mistrust of other
people's motives, get angry often and openly express their
displeasure rather than holding it in.

   Thirty-nine percent of a group of
professional baseball players were found to use snuff or chewing
tobacco regularly and nearly half of the users had lesions inside
their mouths, researchers said.
   A 16-person dental team examined ballplayers during spring
training in Arizona last year and found that of those who used
smokeless tobacco at least weekly, 46 percent had oral lesions. Less
than 2 percent of non-tobacco users had such lesions.
   Samples of tissue taken from some of the lesions showed they were
not cancerous, but some are likely to develop into cancer.
   Long-term use of smokeless tobacco, which increases the risk of
cancer of the mouth, also increases the likelihood of high blood
pressure, heart disease, ulcers and cancer of the digestive system.

method by which sophisticated computers ``draw'' pictures, charts
and even text on display screens isn't readily converted into
Braille or a computer's synthesized voice.
   He urged the industry to develop machines to let the blind hear
or feel such information.

   Positive thinking, exercise, support from
friends and other ways of reducing stress may help AIDS victims slow
the disease's progression, researchers said.
   According to a new study, blood and psychological tests on 18
AIDS patients found that those who exercised, were assertive and had
lower levels of tension, depression, fatigue, stress and anger also
tended to have higher numbers of disease-fighting immune system
cells.
   Some AIDS researchers cast doubt on the theory, saying that undue
optimism that a positive outlook might slow progression of AIDS
could spur people infected by acquired immune deficiency syndrome to
blame themselves wrongly when their condition worsens.

   ``Angel dust'' protects the brain during
strokes, heart attacks and surgery, and a safer form of the often
abused street drug could be in wide use soon for some stroke and
cardiac victims, researchers say.
   The drug, known technically as PCP or phencyclidine, acts as a
stimulant and a depressant and produces a psychological state
similar to schizophrenia.
   Dr. Edward F. Domino of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor
says the potential protective effects of PCP have been found in an
anesthetic called ketamine. PCP and its relatives, including
ketamine, block the chemical changes associated with nerve cell
destruction and thus prevent or limit the loss of nerve cells.
   Ketamine produces the same ill effects as PCP, but they don't
last as long and they can be controlled with certain tranquilizers,
so some version of ketamine might prove to be a safe drug to protect
the brain, Domino said.

   Heart disease remains the nation's
biggest killer, taking a life every 32 seconds, but researchers have
made progress in taming the disease, according to the American Heart
Association.
   Figures released Sunday show that deaths from heart and blood
vessel disease have dropped 24 percent during the past decade.
Researchers attribute the improvement to healthier living habits and
better treatment.
   The association said that in 1986, an estimated 978,500 Americans
died from heart attacks, strokes and other diseases of the heart and
blood vessels. Cancer, the No. 2 killer, took 466,000 lives.
   The association's latest figures show that more than one in four
Americans suffers some form of cardiovascular disease, and almost
half eventually die from it.

<HEAD>Cuban Says He May Have To Seek Asylum In Canada</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A Cuban man who inadvertently
deported himself and his family from the United States on a short
sightseeing trip nearly a month ago said Monday the family may be
forced to seek refugee status in Canada.
   U.S. immigration officials refused to allow the family back into
the United States on Dec. 23 after they falsely claimed U.S.
citizenship. Officials say the family has a record of immigration
fraud.
   ``If they (U.S. immigration officials) do not change their minds,
then we have no choice'' but to apply for asylum, said Carlos
Fajardo, whose family has been stranded in a Niagara Falls, Ontario,
motel since Dec. 23. Fajardo said he would apply on behalf of his
family.
   Fajardo, his wife, Bermaida, 33, and her two children, Yoandys,
12, and Yordalys, 9, crossed into Canada to see part of Niagara
Falls and were refused entry back into the United States.
   Canada issued the family a tourist visa that expired Sunday.
Canadian immigration officials now say Fajardo will have to apply
for asylum soon or leave the country.
   ``Up until this point the problem has been between them and the
U.S. government,'' Albert Opatovsky, manager of the Canadian
Immigration Service office in Niagara Falls, said Monday. ``Now they
become our concern.''
   Opatovsky said an immigration inspector was to interview the
family Monday afternoon. A date for an immigration hearing could be
set this week, he said.
   Fajardo, 39, said he still wants to return to his home and boat
building business in Miami. He said he does not want to move to
Canada. He was adamant about not returning to Cuba.
   Benedict Ferro, district director of the Immigration and
Naturalization Service in Buffalo, said Sunday that Fajardo is
believed to have illegally entered the country in 1985 from Panama
and Mrs. Fajardo was ordered deported last summer.
   Ferro said Fajardo's application for asylum in the United States
was pending when he crossed the border. The application was
nullified when he entered Canada, he said. Applicants for asylum
must stay in the United States until their status is determined.
   Ferro said the woman was stopped by immigration inspectors in
1986 when she illegally entered the United States with false
Venezuelan papers.
   ``She might not have been deported yet, but only because this was
a low-profile case for us,'' he said.
   Ferro also raised new questions about the family.
   He said Fajardo may have an 18-year-old daughter and a wife _
apparently his first wife _ living in the United States. Mrs.
Fajardo's first husband also may be living in the United States, he
said.
   ``They both have extended families, apparently all in the United
States, and they may be all illegally here. And maybe that's why
nobody can petition for them,'' Ferro said.
   The couple claims to have gotten married last October or November
but immigration officials can't find a record of it, Ferro said.
   He said that despite the pleas of Hispanic groups and U.S. Sen.
Bob Graham, D-Fla., he would not issue a ``humanitarian parole'' to
allow the family to return to its home.
   ``To do that would be a slap in the face to the hundreds of
thousands of people who are attempting to enter the country
lawfully,'' he said.

   Dexter the robot hand helps deaf-blind
people listen and a ``talking glove'' lets deaf-mutes speak, but
blind people may find their growing independence threatened by
computer graphics, scientists said Monday.
   A gaze-operated computer keyboard that lets paralyzed people use
their eyes and brain waves to write, talk, move their wheelchairs
and turn on appliances also could be commercially available to the
disabled within a few years, the researchers said.
   Details of several new computerized devices to assist the
disabled were outlined during the annual meeting of the American
Association for the Advancement of Science. So were some problems.
   Voice synthesizers and braille word displays gave blind computer
users ``full competitiveness within most educational and employment
settings'' during the 1980s, said Lawrence Scadden, director of the
Electronic Industries Foundation's Rehabilitation Engineering Center
in Washington.
   But ``increased use of graphically displayed information may
threaten newly acquired independence and productivity for these
individuals,'' he added.
   Unlike the code used to transmit letters and numbers, the method
by which sophisticated computers ``draw'' pictures, charts and even
text on display screens isn't readily converted into braille or a
computer's synthesized voice, said Scadden, who is blind.
   He urged the industry to develop machines to let the blind hear
or feel such information.
   Dexter, a five-fingered robot hand to help deaf-blind people
``hear,'' may be commercially available next year for under $5,500,
said co-developer Deborah Gilden, with the Smith-Kettlewell
Rehabilitation Engineer Center in San Francisco.
   The mechanical hand ``is able to translate information
originating from a keyboard, modem, computer or closed-caption TV
decoder to hand and finger motions that correspond to the one-hand
fingerspelling alphabet,'' said David Jaffe of the Palo Alto
Veterans Administration Medical Center, which helped develop Dexter.
   A deaf person ``listens'' to Dexter by placing his or her fingers
against the mechanical fingers. Each of the robot hand's positions
represent a single letter.
   Stanford University engineer James Kramer said he is seeking a
manufacturer for his ``talking glove,'' which will cost about $1,500
and let deaf-mute and deaf-mute-blind people speak by using their
fingers to spell.
   Wires lead from the glove to a microcomputer, which match the
person's finger motions to letters of the alphabet. A speech
synthesizer converts the letters to spoken words that come from a
small speaker hanging from a deaf person's neck, Kramer said.
   Hearing people can respond by typing on a hand-held computer
keyboard, which then can send the words either into a braille
display worn on a blind-deaf-mute person's belt or into a small
display screen a sighted deaf-mute can wear like a wristwatch.
   Smith-Kettlewell's Erich Sutter developed the gaze-controlled
keyboard for people who are so paralyzed or disabled they can move
little more than their eyes.
   With electrodes attached to or implanted in the scalp, the
paralyzed person stares at a screen that is divided into rectangles,
each containing a letter, number or common word. As the paralyzed
person stares at the desired letter or word, a variety of tiny
lights also flash in the rectangle. For every letter or word, the
lights create a unique electrical wave pattern in the person's brain.
   The electrodes feed those brain waves to a computer, which
converts them back into words, which then can be displayed on a
screen, synthesized into a voice, or used to move a wheelchair, dial
a phone or turn on lights, radio, television and heat, Gilden said.
   Jaffe said a new wheelchair lets the paralyzed steer by making
slight head motions that are detected by an ultrasound
distance-measuring machine. The disabled person's head becomes like
the joystick control on a video game, he said, adding the $4,000
wheelchair should be in production soon.
   A new federal law will provide limited money to help some
disabled people acquire such high-tech machines, but they and their
relatives must work for programs to make the devices more widely
available, said Jacquelyn Brand of the National Special Education
Alliance.

<HEAD>Bakker's Attorney Says He'll Plead Innocent At Tuesday's Arraignment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL NOWELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former PTL leader Jim Bakker will plead
innocent Tuesday to all charges in indictments accusing him of
diverting millions of dollars of his followers' money to his own
use, an attorney said Monday.
   ``Mr. Bakker will have a long prepared statement'' following
arraignment, said Harold Bender, one of Bakker's attorneys.
   Bakker did not mention his court date on Monday's ``Jim and Tammy
Show,'' which the couple tapes at their leased home just south of
Charlotte.
   The Bakkers recently returned to television after nearly two
years off the air. During that time, Bakker was forced from his
ministry when it was disclosed that he had had a sexual liaison with
a church secretary and then paid her to remain quiet.
   Bakker and three of his former top aides at the PTL television
ministry in Fort Mill, S.C., were indicted on Dec. 5 after a
16-month federal grand jury investigation into PTL's operation under
Bakker's leadership.
   Bakker, 48, and Richard Dortch, 57, his former top deputy at PTL,
each were charged with 24 counts of mail and wire fraud and
conspiracy. They were accused of conspiring to defraud PTL
contributors and of diverting more than $4 million in PTL money for
their personal use.
   Last week, Dortch waived his right to appear at Tuesday's
arraignment and entered innocent pleas to all counts.
   U.S. Magistrate Paul Taylor is expected to set a trial date at
the hearing. Bender said he's heard speculation that Dortch may seek
a separate trial.
   ``Otherwise, he'll bear the burden of all of the pre-trial
publicity Mr. Bakker is getting in the case,'' Bender said.
   Also indicted last month were David and James Taggart. The
brothers entered innocent pleas to charges of tax evasion and
conspiring to impede the IRS in tax collection at a Dec. 15 hearing
before Taylor, who scheduled their trial for the U.S. District
Court's February term.
   David Taggart, Bakker's former personal aide, and James Taggart,
PTL's former interior decorator, were accused in a separate
indictment Dec. 5 of using more than $1.1 million of PTL funds for
personal expenses.
   Taylor released Bakker and the other three defendants on $50,000
unsecured bond on Dec. 15.

<HEAD>NEA President Urges Equity and Excellence in Minority Education</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE EMBRY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Unless the nation affirms its commitment to
equity and excellence in education for minorities, the ``American
dream will turn into a nightmare,'' the National Education
Association president warned Monday.
   Mary Hatwood Futrell, leader of the 1.9 million-member NEA since
1983, said education reforms should be extended to all students
regardless of race or economic level.
   By 2020 minorities will comprise 35 percent of the students in
public schools, she said.
   ``These are the citizens whose taxes will support us, the
citizens who can make the future tax base of America expand or
contract, the citizens who will determine our place in the global
economy,'' she said in remarks prepared for delivery to about 75
educators at a conference on the Recruitment and Retention of
Minority Students in Teacher Education.
   ``Unless we as nation affirm our twin commitment to equity and
excellence, the American dream will turn into a nightmare that mocks
the ideals of the Constitution, converting the challenge of reform
into the tragedy of reform,'' she said.
   Futrell said an educational system has been created that
``provides one student with an education that can be redeemed at a
university, while another student gets an education that does no
more than indicate four years of attendance in a high school.''
   While the minority student population will increase, the number
of minority teachers in public schools is expected to drop from the
current 8 percent to 3 percent in the mid-1990s, she said.
   Futrell said a lack of minority teachers will threaten the
education system because it deprives minority students of positive
role models and gives whites ``a distorted view of the world.''
   She also said academic standards should not be diluted to attract
minorities into education, calling that belief a ``residue of
racism.''
   Futrell noted a study by District of Columbia anthropologist
Signithia Fordham in which students at a predominately black
Washington high school were found to be limiting their academic
success ``so their peers won't think they are acting white.''
   She said teachers ``have to do something to ensure that our
children don't think this way,'' and said schools should ``develop
courses and programs aimed at helping build self-esteem.''
   During a news conference, she said disparities in funding for
rich and poor school districts are a problem nationwide.
   ``Most states have put reform on the back burner because of lack
of funding,'' she said.
   Futrell said teacher salaries should be increased to prevent the
drain of talent to other professions. She said the NEA is seeking an
average annual starting salary of $25,000, compared to the current
$17,000.

   The body of a U.S. Air Force
officer who was shot down over Libya in 1986 was returned Monday to
the United States and honored with a brief ceremony.
   Maj. Fernando Ribas-Dominicci was killed in the 1986 U.S. air
raid on Tripoli. He was 33 and a captain, and was promoted
posthumously to major.
   The C-141 Starlifter from Torrejon Air Base in Spain was met at
Dover Air Force Base by Ribas-Dominicci's family and an Air Force
honor guard, pallbearers and color guard.
   The family was proud of what ``Paul and Fernando and the rest of
the guys were doing in the defense of democracy, freedom and the
good things that our country stands for,'' said his brother,
Salvador Ribas-Dominicci, 37, of Mayaguez, Puerto Rico.
   He was referring to Capt. Paul Lorence of San Francisco, who was
in the F-111 bomber with Ribas-Dominicci when it was shot down.
   Libya had said the body it released and flew to Rome on Friday
belonged to Lorence. An autopsy, however, showed it was
Ribas-Dominicci.
   Salvador Ribas-Dominicci said he was angry because the body
should have been identified and returned immediately. ``Military
people are supposed to live by codes of honor ... and obviously
(Libyan leader Moammar) Gadhafi was trying to play something with
this,'' he said.
   Also attending the ceremony were the major's wife, Blanca Berain
Ribas-Dominicci, 36, and his 7-year-old son, Fernando Jr., both of
Austin, Texas; another brother, Jose Alfredo Ribas-Dominicci, 52, of
San Juan, Puerto Rico; a nephew, Miguel Carlos Ribas-Dominicci, 23,
and a niece, Nivea Rosario Ribas-Dominicci, 28, both of New York.
   Salvador Ribas-Dominicci said the family would be briefed later
Monday.
   The body will be prepared for burial at Dover Air Force Base,
which handles the bodies of servicemen and their dependents who die
in Europe, the Azores, Greenland and Iceland. Burial will be in
Puerto Rico, the brother said.

<HEAD>Police Defuse Mail Bomb at Israeli Embassy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police defused a mail bomb that arrived Monday at
the Israeli Embassy in London, the embassy said. Officials would not
say who may have sent it.
   Foreign Office minister William Waldegrave returned from a
meeting with Yasser Arafat in Tunis and said the Palestine
Liberation Organization should be given a chance to prove its
peaceful intentions.
   Relations between Britain and Israel are under strain because
Israel rejects British suggestions for a new moderate approach to
the PLO since Arafat, the PLO's chairman, publicly renounced
terrorism last month.
   The embassy press office said: ``The parcel contained explosives
and was addressed to the ambassador, Yoav Biran.''
   Police were called to the mission in Kensington Palace Gardens,
west London, after a ``small device'' was received there in the
mail, Scotland Yard reported, but it did not give further details.
It did not say where the bomb was defused.
   Such attempts on Israeli diplomats in London have been rare in
the 1980s.
   In June 1982, Ambassador Shlomo Argov was shot and wounded as he
left a dinner at a London hotel. Three Arabs of the terrorist group
led by Abu Nidal were convicted sentenced to prison.
   Israel criticized Waldegrave's meeting Friday with Arafat, the
first between Britain and the PLO at such a high level. He is to
visit Israel next month.
   After his return Monday, Waldegrave said the PLO has said it
wants to lay down its arms and form a democratic civilian state,
``and now surely we should give them the chance to prove that what
they say is sincere.''
   He said it was vital to calm the ``totally understandable
anxieties'' of the Israelis and assure them ``nobody is going to
desert or leave them in the lurch.''
   No attacks on Israeli targets by Palestinian groups under
Arafat's control have been reported since the Palestine National
Congress, which acts as the PLO legislature, issued a Palestinian
declaration of independence Nov. 15 that included implicit
recognition of Israel.

   A few blocks from the bridge where a national
voting rights law was born in bloodshed, three black men took an
oath of office Monday ending 112 years of white political domination
of Dallas County government.
   ``We bring home to Dallas County the harvest of the Martin Luther
King Voting Rights Act,'' said U.S. District Judge U.W. Clemon, the
first black federal judge in Alabama, as he administered the oath of
office to the members of the new Dallas County Commission.
   The three black commissioners _ Erskine Minor, D.L. Pope and
Perry Varner _ were sworn in along with two white commissioners,
Deans Barber and Doug Morrow.
   Until Monday, no black had served on the commission since
Reconstruction. But under a redistricting plan approved after 10
years of legal battles, blacks won control of the five-member
commission in a special election last month.
   Some 300 people sang ``The Battle Hymn of the Republic'' during
the ceremony in a packed county courtroom.
   The ceremony coincided with Alabama's state holiday for both
Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee and the slain civil rights leader,
who led the 1965 Selma-to-Montgomery voting rights march. The march
took place with federal protection after a band of would-be marchers
were beaten and routed by mounted state troopers on the Edmund
Pettus Bridge, which crosses the Alabama River at Selma.
   ``Bloody Sunday'' drew national attention to the next march led
by King, which helped inspire passage of the 1965 federal Voting
Rights Act.
   ``That act was conceived on the streets of your town. It became a
national commitment on the Edmund Pettus Bridge,'' said James P.
Turner, who investigated the violence in 1965 and is now acting head
of the Justice Department's civil rights division.
   Barber, a white commissioner, said he expected the racially mixed
commission will ``move Selma and Dallas County forward in a
progressive manner.''
   The county, with a population of 55,000, is about 56 percent
black. But blacks had not been able to muster a voting majority due
to low voter turnout during the old, at-large voting system. The
redistricting plan drawn up by the Justice Department created five
districts, two of which have large majorities of blacks.
   ``I suspect there is no place on this planet that is more
identified with Dr. King and his quest for American justice than
right here in Selma, Alabama,'' said Turner at a reception after the
swearing-in. ``I predict that some day students of modern history
will point to Selma, Alabama, as 20th-century America's cradle of
democracy, where people of all races began to live Dr. King's dream
of brotherhood.''

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One nun wore sequins. Another, in full Carmelite
habit and veil, sat on center stage and played spoons to a bluegrass
tune.
   Life imitated show business Monday as about a dozen real-life
nuns showed up at the Charles Street Playhouse to audition for a
part in the musical ``Nunsense,'' a gentle spoof of convent life.
   Judging their performances was a panel of nun-impersonators, the
show's regular cast. The actresses sing, clown and even tapdance in
the off-beat comedy about nuns who stage a talent show to raise
money to bury four sisters who died of botulism and are being stored
in the convent freezer.
   Ten nuns had auditioned over the weekend, four of whom were
called back Monday. The five nuns judged most talented will each be
given a cameo role in the show for one week in February or March.
   The show's producers advertised for ``real nuns'' in Catholic and
secular newspapers. They have promised to donate $2 from every
ticket sold for the special shows to a charity chosen by the
performing nun.
   ``We're doing it to raise some money for charity and also of
course to get publicity,''said co-producer Ken Biller.
   ``Nunsense,'' written by Dan Goggin, has played in 30 American
cities since its 1985 debut. It is now playing in Philadelphia, New
York and Boston and has gone on a national tour, said Biller. A
similar, smaller-scale audition for real nuns to appear in the play
was held during its run in Chicago, he said.
   Among the show's biggest fans are the clergy, who applaud its
wacky but respectful humor and pack its performances.
   Several nuns who auditioned said they had dreamed of stage
careers before taking the veil.
   ``I always wanted to go to Hollywood,'' said Sister Marie
Fuhrman, 37, who works with the elderly at the LaBoure Center in
South Boston. ``But I just knew I belonged in the convent.
   ``... Even if I don't make the part, at least I can say I
auditioned for an off-Broadway show,'' she said.
   Sister Rena Foley was a professional dancer who owned her own
dance studio before entering the Sisters of St. Joseph convent at
age 28. Now gray-haired, she donned black stretch pants, a sequined
vest and a top hat for a jazz number complete with shoulder rolls,
high-kicks and splits.
   Also auditioning were two nuns who have performed all over the
world, Sisters Rosalie and Rosemonde Deck, who sing in 14 languages.
   Sister Brigid Riley of the Carmelite Sisters for the Aged and
Infirm in South Boston said she decided to perform her wooden spoon
routine in hopes of attracting more young women to her order.
   She said she believes that nuns' participation in a professional
musical will show young women ``we're not just behind the walls
doing our work. There is joy.''

   Three African National Congress
guerrillas, including a senior leader, were sentenced Monday to
prison terms of up to 23 years for land mine explosions that injured
eight people.
   All three could have been sentenced to death. They turned toward
supporters in the gallery at the Pretoria Supreme Court and gave
clenched-fist salutes before they were led away.
   A 20-year sentence for treason was issued to the most prominent
defendant, Ebrahim Ismail Ebrahim, 51, who was abducted from
Swaziland in 1986 by men he said were South African agents.
   Ebrahim, of Indian descent, has been widely described as the
highest-ranking official of the mainly black ANC to go on trial
since Nelson Mandela and several colleagues were given life
sentences in 1964. The ANC is the largest guerrilla group fighting
the white-dominated government.
   One of Ebrahim's black co-defendants, Mandla Maseko, received a
23-year sentence for treason. Simon Dladla, a Swazi citizen,
received 12 years for terrorism. He could not be found guilty of
treason because he did not owe allegiance to South Africa.
   Local newspapers said that after the supporters in the court
gallery finished singing an anti-apartheid anthem, a government
prosecutor was heard saying, ``Long live the AWB'' _ the Afrikaans
initials of the white-supremacist Afrikaner Resistance Movement.
   The three were found guilty in November of laying land mines that
injured eight people in Transvaal Province in 1986. At one stage of
the 16-month trial, three members of the ANC's executive committee _
who faced arrest in South Africa _ gave evidence for the defense at
a court session held last year in London.
   Ebrahim, along with his co-defendants, did not testify during the
trial, but he submitted a 17-page written statement to the court in
which he alleged that all three men were tortured by police.
   ``Finding us guilty is merely a statement that the state
considers the struggle for democracy, equality, justice, peace and a
non-racial society to be morally and politically reprehensible,'' he
said.
   ``We wish to say to our people, we tried to carry out your
behests,'' Ebrahim wrote. ``We did our best to live up to what you
expected of us as members of the African National Congress.''
   In an editorial Monday, the country's largest Afrikaans-language
daily newspaper, Beeld, suggested that the government open talks
with the ANC. Beeld, traditionally supportive of the government,
said South Africa could reap immense benefits by freeing Mandela and
negotiating with his organization.
   President P.W. Botha, who has criticized Beeld's increasingly
liberal editorial stance in recent months, has rejected any talks
with the ANC until it renounces violence.
   The ANC was outlawed by South Africa's white authorities in 1960
and a year later began a bombing and sabotage campaign. The
organization is multiracial but overwhelmingly black.
   Ebrahim, who holds an Indian passport, left South Africa in 1979
after completing a 15-year prison term for sabotage.
   South African authorities say Ebrahim at one time was the
companion of Helene Passtoors, a Dutch-Belgian citizen convicted in
May 1986 of treason against South Africa.
   Ms. Passtoors, who is serving a 10-year sentence, is the ex-wife
of Klaas De Jonge, a Dutchman who holed up in the Dutch Embassy in
Pretoria for two years rather than face charges of smuggling arms
for the ANC. He returned to Holland in 1987 as part of a prisoner
exchange.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.

   President-elect Bush began his inauguration
week by paying tribute Monday to the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and
working on his inaugural address as those organizing the swearing-in
ceremony made lists, juggled seating arrangements and monitored
weather reports.
   While federal workers enjoyed a day off, behind-the-scenes
activity for the inauguration of the nation's 41st president went on
at a furious pace.
   House Democrats arranged a ``Majority Party Party'' at a hotel
ballroom Thursday night, the same time the GOP has scheduled a
televised, star-studded inaugural gala.
   ``We had to give the Democrats something to do,'' said Howard
Schloss, a spokesman for the Democratic Congressional Campaign
Committee, which strengthened its grip on the House in November.
``Hopefully, in four years we'll be having the inaugural gala.''
   The gala was one of the myriad events put together by the
Presidential Inaugural Committee, which is running most of the
week's festivities. They open Wednesday with a salute to teachers
and end Sunday with a prayer service at Washington Cathedral.
   ``Rehearsals are taking place all over town. Decorations are
going up. Thousands of volunteers have descended on this city ...
and thousands of media people from all over the world are picking up
their credentials,'' said PIC spokesman Ed Cassidy. ``The mood is
very upbeat, excited and frenzied.''
   Monday was a generally quiet day in the nation's capital, as
federal offices were closed for the national holiday commemorating
King's birthday. Bush offered a strong tribute to the slain civil
rights leader at a prayer breakfast for black supporters.
   ``We must not fail the nation he loved so much and gave his life
for. I understand that five days before becoming president of the
United States of America,'' Bush told the gathering of some 300
black leaders.
   He then returned home to work on the speech he will give Friday
after taking the oath of office.
   The president-elect and his aides are keeping mum on the tenor of
the speech, but spokeswoman Sheila Tate said Monday that ``he wants
it short.''
   She said speechwriter Peggy Noonan, author of some of Bush's most
memorable campaign comments, ``had to go back to the drawing
boards'' to shorten and edit the address and was expected to deliver
another draft Monday night. Bush plans a dress rehearsal Thursday
before a TelePrompTer.
   Inauguration week started differently at the Capitol Hill office
of the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies, which
is in charge of the swearing-in ceremony and a luncheon to follow.
   ``The very first thing we did this morning was make a checklist
of what could be forgotten _ who's bringing the Bush bibles, who's
bringing the Quayle bibles,'' said executive director Mike Ruehling.
   The bicentennial inaugural ceremony will begin at 11:38 a.m.
Friday, with Bush taking the oath as close to noon as possible, as
the Constitution directs. Ruehling said Sen. Wendell Ford, D-Ky.,
chairman of the committee and the master of ceremonies, will have
both long and short introductions to use, depending on how the
program is going.
   ``One thing you can't take into account is applause,'' Ruehling
said. ``If you build in three minutes of applause and there's only
30 seconds, you're in trouble. And we don't have any public service
announcements to run to fill the time.''
   The congressional panel is monitoring weather reports from two
sources _ the military and NBC, home of the network pool producer.
The latest report for Friday called for clear skies and temperatures
ranging from the high 30s to low 40s.
   ``A little nippy but still considerably better than four years
ago,'' Ruehling said. Then, the temperature was 10 degrees, enough
to force President Reagan's oath-taking into the Capitol Rotunda and
cancel the post-ceremony parade.
   Outside on the West Front of the Capitol, with its sweeping view
of the Smithsonian museums and the Washington monument, workers
prepared Monday to install a podium and the bulletproof glass shield
that will surround it.
   Ruehling's committee was also finalizing a seating chart for the
inner platform _ a select group of 300 who will sit closest to the
podium.
   ``We've managed to get the immediate families of both the Bushes
and the Quayles on the platform, plus congressional leaders and
program participants. It was quite a feat,'' Ruehling said.
   The Bushes have five children and numerous grandchildren,
siblings, cousins, nieces and nephews. The Quayles have three
children and Mrs. Quayle has five brothers and sisters, Ruehling
said.
   ``The Reagans didn't have that large of an immediate family,'' he
said. ``People that have been on the platform at the previous two
inaugurals, some of them didn't make it this time because of the
size of the families.''
   A run-through of the inaugural program at 5 a.m. Sunday went
``about as smoothly as could be expected,'' Ruehling said, but added
he expects there will be ``some wrinkles no matter what'' when Bush
finally takes the oath.
   ``There's a sign in our office that says ``Four More Days,'''
Ruehling said. Four more days and then what? ``And then it's beyond
our control.''

   Zookeepers are blaming a kid boom at
the Forest Park Zoo on the escapades of a billy goat who escaped
from his pen.
   Six nanny goats have given birth to 11 kids in the past week and
five more nannies may be expecting, said zoo manager Barbara Lewis.
``We're taking this day by day,'' she said.
   Lewis said the billy goat escaped and mingled with the nannies
for two weeks late last summer while repairs were being made to a
nearby pond. At the time, Lewis said, she did not know the extent of
the goat's exploits.
   One of the kids, Frankie, has been named for the security guard
who found its mother giving birth last week. Lewis said the guard
had never seen a birth and was thrilled by the experience.

   A former prime minister kidnapped near
his home over the weekend had received threats recently, Prime
Minister Wilfried Martens said Monday.
   Officials disagreed over whether the abduction Saturday of former
Prime Minister Paul Vanden Boeynants was political.
   About 500 police spent Monday afternoon, without success,
searching a 75-acre wood at Baudour, near Mons about 30 miles
southwest of Brussels, after an anonymous caller told a radio
station Vanden Boeynants' body was there.
   ``Mr. Vanden Boeynants had received threats lately and had
requested to meet with the interior minister,'' Martens said on BRT,
Belgium's Dutch-language radio network. He did not elaborate.
   Interior Minister Louis Tobback told BRT that Vanden Boeynants,
69, had an appointment with him Monday ``to discuss a personal
matter.''
   Police reported no new leads in their search for Vanden
Boeynants, who arrived at the nine-story apartment complex where he
lives in a posh Brussels neighborhood shortly before 6 p.m.
Saturday, but never entered.
   Police found Vanden Boeynants' car in his garage, and his hearing
aid, pipe and a shoe nearby.
   Three anonymous telephone callers claimed responsibility for the
kidnapping. The daily newspaper Le Soir received a call Saturday and
RTBF, Belgium's French-language radio network, received two calls
Sunday.
   Sunday's caller spoke on behalf of a group calling itself the
Revolutionary Socialist Brigade. Officials said they had never heard
of the group.
   It was unclear who called Le Soir. The caller spoke to a night
watchman on behalf of a group of ``revolutionary socialists.''
   Officials said they were concerned about Vanden Boeynants' health
because he takes heart medicine.
   Deputy Brussels prosecutor Andre Vandoren played down the
reported threats against Vanden Boeynants.
   ``We have no elements to say a direct link can be established
between the threats'' and his disappearance, Vandoren said. He did
not exclude political motives in the abduction.
   But Johan Vande Lanotte, an aide to Tobback, said, ``So far the
case is a strictly judicial matter. There is nothing to indicate
that a truly terrorist act or politically inspired action is
involved.''
   Carlo Huttisch, an aide to Vanden Boeynants, also ruled out
political motives because a formal communique to that effect had
been received.
   Vanden Boeynants, a Christian Democrat, was prime minister
between 1966 and 1968, and again for several months in late 1978 and
early 1979. He also was defense minister in several governments in
the 1970s.
   In 1986, he received a three-year suspended sentence and was
fined the equivalent of about $16,850 for tax evasion, forgery and
fraud as head of a Brussels meat packing company.
   Vanden Boeynants was a Brussels city councilor for just more than
30 years beginning in 1952, and oversaw a drastic urban renewal
program that made him the bane of urban conservationists.
   He was re-elected city councilor Oct. 9 and then made a bid to
become mayor. He abandoned the plan after Martens told him he could
not assume the post because of his conviction.
   In recent months, Vanden Boeynants has headed a project to
develop the Atomium, a giant structure shaped like an iron molecule,
that towered over the 1958 world exposition.

<TEXT>
   Polish leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski
hinted of a new stance toward the banned Solidarity labor federation
on Monday, telling a Communist Party meeting that ``all constructive
forces'' should join a campaign for reform.
   The meeting of the 230-member Central Committee is shaping up as
a showdown between hardliners and reformers over restoring legal
status to the trade union movement. Solidarity remains active,
although it was suspended and then outlawed after a December 1981
martial-law decree.
   A government source last week told The Associated Press the
two-day meeting would end with the party offering to legalize
Solidarity under certain conditions, opening the way to broader
talks with the opposition under the leadership of Lech Walesa,
Solidarity's chief and winner of the 1983 Nobel Peace Prize.
   Marian Orzechowski, the party's chief ideologist, told the
five-hour meeting the issue of union pluralism was ``ripe to be
solved'' and said a separate draft position on the topic had been
prepared for a decision by the plenum.
   ``It seems they will register Solidarity,'' said Zbigniew Bujak,
the former underground Solidarity leader, when asked about the
meeting. If so, formal talks between authorities and the opposition
could begin soon, he said.
   But signs of divisions in the party were evident during the
discussion. Nine members spoke, and the debate was to resume Tuesday.
   Official unions chief Alfred Miodowicz told the plenum no
decision on trade unions should be taken until a party conference on
ideology scheduled for early next month, the official PAP news
service reported. Other speakers offered similar sentiments.
   Eryka Gorajek, a forewoman at a northern Poland tire factory,
spoke against legalizing Solidarity. ``Everyone says there should be
only one trade union at an enterprise,'' she said.
   Jaruzelski, whose remarks were broadcast live on state radio, did
not mention Solidarity by name but said political and social life
should be open to different segments of society.
   ``Today we will draw directions of democracy which will include
some pluralistic solutions,'' Jaruzelski said.
   ``The priority goal is radical and irrevocable reconstruction of
social life so that ... there is a place in it for all citizens who
recognize the supreme interests of our country and the unchangeable
shape of its essential framework.'
   By ``supreme interests,'' Poland's leaders usually mean its
membership in the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact military alliance and
maintaining a political system in which the communists have the
leading role.
   The general said the party wants pluralism, but that it should
not be ``confrontational, destructive, anarchic'' if there is to be
any chance ``to unite Poles around a constructive, nationwide
program.''
   Jaruzelski, first secretary of the communist Polish United
Workers Party, alluded to public discontent after a decade of
economic decline and stagnation. People have become ``irritated and
unsure about the future,'' creating problems within the party, he
said.
   ``What does the party expect? What does society expect?''
Jaruzelski asked rhetorically. ``Agreement of all constructive
forces of the nation in the task of reforms and renewal.''
   Referring to the opposition and the party, Jaruzelski said: ``We
are all changing. We are going toward new solutions, aware of the
possible dangers, but hopeful that the others have also drawn
appropriate conclusions about the past years _ that they will
confirm by their actions the care for the country that they profess.
   ``Reconciliation ... is a great opportunity for Poland.''
   Orzechowski, also a Politburo member, said the party has been
re-examining its role recently in a wide-ranging internal discussion.
   ``The problem of trade union pluralism is becoming ripe to be
solved,'' he said.
   But he said any lifting of the ban on allowing more than one
legal trade union should be accompanied by guarantees that there
would be no repeat of the Solidarity era of 1981, when factories
became ``arenas of political struggle.''
   Walesa has demanded that authorities agree to recognize his union
before he will begin talks on Poland's future. Meanwhile, he has
warned that the public's patience is thin after years of rising
prices and consumer shortages, threatening a social explosion that
he might be unable to control.
   Significant opposition to legalizing Solidarity remains,
especially from the leadership of the official trade union alliance
OPZZ, factory-based party organizations, and elements of the army
and police, party sources say.

<HEAD>Finance Minister: Libyan Plant Can Produce Poison Gas</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg
says the government now believes a Libyan chemical factory is
capable of producing poison gas, according to a report published
Monday.
   At a news conference, Stoltenberg again revised the official
recollection of when Bonn first learned of possible West German
involvement in the plant. He also said a government company may have
aided the construction unknowingly.
   Belgian prosecutors announced a second arrest involving the
plant. They said Jos Vleminckx of the now-bankrupt Antwerp shipping
firm Sanexomar was charged with falsifying cargo documents, the same
charge brought against Jozef Gedopt, manager of the Antwerp company
Cross Link, who was arrested last week.
   A German magazine said a U.S. company provided a computer for the
Libyan plant.
   The Saudi Arabian daily Al Sharq al Awsat quoted Ihsan Barbouti,
an Arab consultant, as saying he designed the complex and it was
heavily guarded, but he did not believe it was making poison gas.
   West German officials had maintained for three weeks that they
had seen no proof of U.S. assertions that the plant in Rabta, Libya,
is intended for the production of chemical weapons or that West
German firms helped supply it. Libya says the plant is a
pharmaceutical factory.
   Die Welt newspaper published an interview with Stoltenberg in its
early Tuesday edition, which was available in Bonn Monday evening.
   ``We must assume that the factory is a facility in which poison
gas can be produced,'' he was quoted as saying. He said he based the
assumption on ``concrete indications'' and intelligence reports.
   Die Welt also quoted Stoltenberg as saying confiscated documents
opened up a ``possibility, or a suspicion,'' that any West German
firms involved in the plant could be guilty of illegal transactions.
   The documents were seized last week from the now-defunct I.B.I.
Engineering company of Frankfurt.
   At the news conference, Stoltenberg said his ministry had ``vague
information'' on the Libyan plant in early August. On Friday,
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's spokesman corrected official statements to
reflect that intelligence sources linked West German companies to
the Libyan project in mid-October.
   Stern magazine said it would report in Thursday's editions that
the German chemical company Imhausen-Chemie had obtained from the
U.S. electronics company Harris Corp., ``through indirect
channels,'' the central computer for the Libyan chemical plant.
   The nationally circulated weekly sent the report by telex to news
media.
   The magazine did not elaborate, but said Harris, based in
Melbourne, Fla., specializes in aircraft and satellite electronics
and works closely with the U.S. Defense Department.
   Harris officials denied the report.
   ``We have made as thorough a search of our records as possible in
the time available, and to the best of our knowledge we have sold no
computers to Libya either directly or through a third party,'' said
spokesman Peter Carney. ``In particular, we have no record of
selling any computers to the German company Imhausen.''
   Stern also said Salzgitter Industriebau GmbH, a subsidiary of the
West German government-owned Salzgitter AG, made blueprints for the
plant, about 40 miles outside of Tripoli.
   Salzgitter AG denied the report but said in a statement that its
subsidiary was involved with Imhausen-Chemie, identified by U.S.
officials as a key participant in the Libyan plant, in constructing
a pharmaceutical plant in Hong Kong.
   Salzgitter AG manufactures steel products and industrial
equipment, and Salzgitter Industriebau specializes in developing
industrial plants.
   Stoltenberg said Salzgitter Industiebau may have been an
unwitting participant in the Libyan plant.
   The developments cast further doubt on Bonn's handling of the
matter, which has dominated West German news reports for three weeks
and complicated relations with the United States.
   U.S. allegations of a West German hand in the plant were made
public in late December.
   Bonn officials said then that they could find no evidence to
support the accusations. After an initial probe of Imhausen-Chemie,
the government cleared the chemical company of any illegal trade
activity with Libya.
   Last week, however, Kohl acknowledged mounting indications of
West German involvement and said some firms could face criminal
charges.
   His spokesman, Friedhelm Ost, announced on Friday that
intelligence officials had informed Bonn in mid-October of suspected
West German ties to the plant. The government had said a week
earlier that it knew nothing of the case until Kohl's visit to
Washington Nov. 15.
   A regional prosecutor in Offenburg now is investigating the
export activities of Imhausen-Chemie.
   At the news conference, Stoltenberg repeated the government's
position that there are insufficient grounds for a federal criminal
investigation of companies alleged to have been involved.
   ``We are a democracy. We have to take care of legal grounds,'' he
said. ``We cannot act on rumors.''

   New rubber bullets have been blamed for the
deaths of four Arab youths in five days, raising concern the
ammunition may be more lethal than earlier rubber rounds used to
combat the Palestinian uprising.
   The victims, two girls and two teen-age boys, were struck in the
head with the spherical pellets when Israeli soldiers opened fire to
quell demonstrations in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, Arab
doctors said Monday.
   The deaths came during a round of violent clashes between
soldiers and stone-throwing protesters that have left 10
Palestinians dead since Thursday. They ranged in age from 11 to 18.
   Arab doctors said in addition to the four deaths from rubber
bullets, plastic rounds were responsible for two of the recent
deaths. The remaining four were blamed on standard-issue lead
bullets.
   The army has confirmed the deaths, but does not give information
on the type of ammunition involved.
   The rising toll has prompted Israeli ministers to call for a
review of the army's handling of the 13-month uprising against
Israeli rule.
   At least 359 Palestinians have been killed since December 1987,
most of them shot in confrontations with Israeli troops. Fifteen
Israelis also have died.
   Energy Minister Moshe Shahal of the left-leaning Labor Party on
Sunday urged the Cabinet to order an investigation of plastic
bullets, which have been used widely in riot control since August.
   Rubber bullets used during much of the uprising are steel pellets
coated with rubber. A new version introduced late last month is
marble-shaped, has a thinner rubber coating and is heavier. Critics
say they are deadlier.
   Since the rubber bullets do not rotate in flight as do standard
live rounds and do not fragment on impact, they are said to cause
less damage. However, the army refuses to release statistics to
support the conclusion.
   Minister Ehud Olmert, a member of the right-wing Likud bloc who
is in charge of Arab affairs, said Monday on Israel radio that
Israel and the Palestinians are paying a ``high price'' in efforts
to put down the uprising.
   While favoring tough measures against rioters, Olmert said he did
not understand the army's policy for opening fire.
   ``I don't think there's a lot of logic or common sense in
shooting after a boy when he's already finished throwing his stone
and is running away,'' he said. ``There must be some judgment and
some restraint.''
   In addition to the four deaths since Thursday, two earlier ones
were reported from the new rubber bullets.
   Dr. Rustom Namari, director of Mukassed Hospital in Arab east
Jerusalem, described the new rubber bullets as ``heavier and
harder'' than the old rubber rounds.
   ``They are killing people, especially when they hit in the
head,'' Namari said in an interview. ``The bullet penetrates more,
it breaks bones more.''
   Namari said the hospital had a 17-year-old Gaza Strip boy in its
intensive care unit with damage to half of his brain from a rubber
bullet wound.
   Last month, he said, Mukassed doctors removed six of the new
bullets from the head of a Palestinian teen-ager; two were lodged in
the brain, two in the jaw, one in the neck and one under the left
eye.
   ``I know of only one death from the old rubber bullets, and I can
confirm at least five from the new ones,'' Namari said.
   A spokesman for the army, who cannot be identified under military
rules, said the rubber bullets were introduced because ``the chances
of them killing are much less than with lead bullets, which are
lethal per se.''
   He blamed the recent rise in fatalities on ``an increase in the
intensity and number of riots. And the composition of the rioters is
younger. ... These youngsters are much more difficult to
anticipate.''
   The spokesman declined to give specifics on the rules for firing
rubber bullets, which generally are shot in a cluster from a
canister. The army has said in the past that the plastic rounds are
not fatal if fired from a distance of 70 yards.
   On Monday, an officer defended the use of plastic bullets as
``very deterring.''
   ``People are very much afraid of them,'' Col. M., who was not
identified further in keeping with army rules, said on Israel
Television. ``The moment we arrive and point the guns they
disappear.''
   The television also said new regulations allowed troops to fire
plastic or rubber bullets at stone-throwers even when they are
fleeing. It said the army's attempt to confront each rioter was
partly to blame for the rise in casualties.
   The number of wounded, the television reported, reached a record
figure of 492 last month, more than in each of the 13 months of the
uprising.
   The earliest reported victim of the new bullets was a 15-year-old
boy killed in a Nov. 26 stone-throwing clash with troops in a
refugee camp in the Gaza Strip, doctors at Shifa Hospital said.

<HEAD>Students Protest Transfer Of Arabs To Separate Dorms</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four Arab Israeli women stayed in their
dormitory Monday with fellow students who oppose Tel Aviv University
plans to move them away from contact with foreign Jews being
assigned to the dorm.
   The young women and about a dozen supporters refused university
officials' orders to leave, said Yossi Shturm of the Student Union.
He said the union asked a Tel Aviv court Sunday to stop the transfer.
   ``This is a racist decision and it is unacceptable,'' Shturm said.
   Dean of students Gideon Fishelson said the university has moved
nearly 50 students to make room for members of a foreign study
program, and fewer than 10 Arabs were affected.
   But he acknowledged a longstanding university policy of housing
foreign students exclusively with other Jews so they can learn about
Israel and are not influenced by negative Arab ``propaganda.''
   ``We mix them up with Jewish students in order to attain a
Zionist goal, so that after spending one semester here they want to
return to live here afterward,'' Fishelson said by telephone. ``If
one of them asks to live with an Arab student, I won't say no, but
we don't arrange them that way.''
   The women who refused to leave their rooms are citizens from
northern Israel, the dean said.
   In addition to appealing the transfer order, students are
collecting signatures on a petition that says, ``We will not let the
university be dragged into apartheid,'' a reference to South
Africa's policy of racial separation.
   Shturm said the foreign students should be explosed to Israel's
diverse population. ``Students from abroad have to learn to live
with all Israeli students, not just Jews. That's the Israeli
reality.'' he said.
   Arab citizens make up about 17 percent of Israel's 4.2 million
people. They live in Israel proper, not in territories captured in
the 1967 Middle East war.

<HEAD>Prime Minister Condemns Killing of Reserve Policement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Charles Haughey said Monday
the killing of a reserve policeman was ``brutal and senseless'' and
that his government would spare no effort to find the killers.
   Harry Keyes, 25, was shot on Sunday after he and his girlfriend
left a house in Ballintra, western Ireland, eight miles from the
border with Northern Ireland, police reported. He was the first
victim of Northern Ireland's political and sectarian violence this
year.
   No claim of responsibility was made, but suspicion fell on the
outlawed Irish Republican Army, which is fighting a guerrilla war to
drive the British from Northern Ireland.
   The Republican Press Center in Belfast, through which the IRA
issues its statements, said it had no information about the Keyes
killing.
   Irish police said two gunmen stopped Keyes' car Sunday night as
he was backing out of the driveway, dragged his girlfriend out and
shot the former Royal Ulster Constabulary reserve officer. Police
did not identify the woman, who was not hurt.
   Haughey pledged ``every effort'' to find the gunmen and said in a
statement: ``I strongly condemn the brutal and senseless killing and
extend the deepest sympathies, on behalf of my government, to the
families of those concerned.''

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 140 writers, unwilling to join a
union created for them by the government, have met to recreate an
independent group dissolved during the 1981 martial law crackdown.
   During the weekend meeting, the writers formed an organizational
committee led by Jan Jozef Szczepanski, a novelist and screenwriter,
who was president of the dissolved Polish Authors Union.
   The writers said in a statement that their decision not to join a
government-sponsored Polish Authors Union shows they place more
value on ``independence and personal dignity than clear advantages''
and that the official group denies them appropriate representation.
   Recreating the group, under the title of the Polish Writers
Society, will help the literary community take part in efforts to
reverse Poland's economic crisis, the writers' statement said.
   The group will continue signing up members and then apply to
authorities for registration as a legal association, a spokesman
said.
   The group also ``welcomed with satisfaction'' the government's
August decision to lift the ban imposed on the Polish P.E.N. Writers
club imposed during martial law, which formally ended in 1983.

<DATELINE>KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Edward Seaga is taking
credit for Jamaica's recovery from Hurricane Gilbert and its close
relations with the United tates, but he faces an uphill battle for
an unprecented third straight term.
   Opinion polls for two years now indicated the conservative Seaga
trailed his longstanding socialist rival, former Prime Minister
Michael Manley, by 13 points. Seaga aides say the Caribbean island
nation's striking recovery from the century's worst storm has not
yet improved his chances.
   Ending months of speculation, Seaga told a nationally televised
rally Sunday night general elections will be held Feb. 9.
   Seaga railed against the policies of the 1970s Manley government
before thousands of cheering supporters at Kingston's South Parade
traffic quadrangle. Seaga said that during eight years in power, his
center-right Jamaican Labor Party brought political stability,
reversed economic decline and restored relations with the United
States.
   ``In these hands, your future is safe,'' Seaga said.
   It will be Jamaica's first contested national election since
1980, when politically related attacks killed more than 700 people
during a nine-month campaign.
   In August, Seaga and Manley signed a ``peace treaty'' and agreed
on a code of conduct for orderly campaigning.
   Manley's leftist People's National Party boycotted 1983 elections
in a dispute over voter registration, leaving the Jamaican Labor
Party with all 60 seats in Parliament.
   Manley, a charismatic politician with a strong following among
the young, has called for elections ever since.
   Business leaders urged a short campaign to minimize the risk of
disrupting the tourist season. Seaga said the campaign was the
shortest allowed under law.
   The $600 million-a-year tourist industry is the nation's biggest
foreign-exchange earner. It has bounced back from Hurricane Gilbert,
which struck Sept. 12, causing 45 deaths and about $1 billion in
damage.
   Visitor arrivals, down 42.7 percent in September, hit 1 million
by December and now are running only 1.6 percent below last year,
according to government figures.
   Electricity and water were restored, roads cleared and thousands
of houses and buildings rebuilt or repaired. Although work
continues, Jamaica shows little sign of the devastation.
   The Boston-born and Harvard-educated Seaga, 58, claimed credit
Sunday for ``putting Jamaica back on its feet,'' boasting he raised
$600 million in relief funds from the United States, other Western
governments and lending institutions within one month of the
hurricane.
   ``It was possible because the international community trusts the
government of Jamaica,'' he said.
   His standing in the polls improved slightly after the hurricane.
But pollster Carl Stone of the University of the West Indies said
bickering over alleged inequities and delays in relief distribution
offset any gains.
   Seaga is seen as President Reagan's closest ally in the
Caribbean. He was the first foreign leader to visit the White House
after Reagan took office in 1981, and supported the U.S.-led
invasion of Grenada in 1983.
   Manley, 64, educated at the London School of Economics, was prime
minister from 1972-80, a period marked by sharp economic decline.
His government took over several state industries and embraced Cuba,
alarming the United States and foreign investors.
   Manley now says he learned from mistakes and wants good relations
with the United States.
   But Seaga suggested Manley and his supporters have not changed
and that his opponent remains friendly with Cuban leader Fidel
Castro.
   Unemployment has dropped from 28 percent to 20 percent and the
vital bauxite industry has shown signs of recovery from a collapse,
but Jamaica still has a $4.1 billion foreign debt and living
standards remain poor in this nation of 2.3 million people.
   Seaga campaign strategist George Ramocan noted that another
factor in the election would be the traditional desire by Jamaicans
for change. No government has served more than two consecutive terms
since universal suffrage was introduced in 1944.

   A U.S.-bound rhinoceros tried to ram its
way out of it shipping crate Monday, causing a three-hour traffic
jam when the truck carrying it was forced to stop, the United News
of India reported.
   The black African rhino, headed to the airport for shipment to
the Oklahoma City Zoo, panicked and rammed against the walls of the
wooden crate, damaging it and causing the truck to sway to a halt,
the news agency said.
   About 30 police officers directed traffic while 20 Delhi zoo
personnel escorted the 8-year-old black African rhino back to the
zoo after the four-ton animal was tranquilized, the news agency
reported.
   The rhino, born at the zoo, was being sent as part of an animal
exchange program. Cheetahs and a hippopotamus have arrived from the
United States, zoo Director Kamal Naidu told UNI.
   Naidu said the rhino's departure was deferred a week because the
crate was severely damaged.

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Wind gusts over the Rockies on Monday toppled utility poles near
Cheyenne, Wyo., while most of the nation had fair weather.
   The strongest winds were over southeast Wyoming with gusts of up
to 70 mph near Cheyenne and to 60 mph in Cody. Livingston, Mont.,
also reported gusts to 60 mph.
   Winds were strong over the foothills of the Colorado Rockies. The
U.S. Air Force Academy near Colorado Springs measured a wind gust of
46 mph. The winds were causing dirt and sand to blow across roads
over open areas.
   High wind warnings were posted Monday for the upper Yellowstone
Valley in Montana, the east slopes of the Montana Rockies and the
Absaroka Range of northwest Wyoming.
   Rain fell over the coast of Oregon and Washington and rain mixed
with snow over eastern Washington and northern Idaho. In separate
storms, light snow fell in northeast Minnesota, northeast New York
and northern New England.
   Much of the nation had fair weather due to a large high pressure
area that stretched from Nevada across the Plains states to the
middle Atlantic coast.
   The warm temperatures caused an extreme avalanche hazard in the
northern Oregon Cascades, amid deep snow.
   The coldest temperatures were in western Colorado and eastern
Utah, where readings were in the single digits and teens.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 1 degree
at Gunnison, Colo., to 82 degrees at four Florida communities:
Naples, Fort Myers, Miami and Vero Beach. The low temperature in the
nation Monday morning was 31 degrees below zero at Gunnison.
   For Tuesday, the forecast called for snow over western and
northeast New York, much of northern New England, and from western
North Dakota to eastern Upper Michigan. Rain was expected to fall
along the northern Pacific coast, with snow mixing with rain in the
northern intermountain region. Windy conditions were to continue
along the east slopes of the Montana and Wyoming Rockies.
   Much of the rest of the nation was expected to have fair weather.
High temperatures were forecast in the 20s over northeast Minnesota,
extreme northern Wisconsin, Upper Michigan, northern Maine,
northeast Nevada and northwest Utah; in the 30s and 40s from the
northern Pacific coast across much of the intermountain region, the
Rockies, the northern Plains, the upper Mississippi Valley, the
Great Lakes and the Ohio Valley to most of the northern and middle
Atlantic Coast states; in the 50s and 60s from central and southern
California across southern Arizona, the central and southern Plains,
most of the middle and lower Mississippi Valley, the Gulf Coast and
the Tennessee Valley to the southern Atlantic coast; and in the 70s
over the southern half of the Florida Peninsula and southwest
California.

   Canadians observed Martin Luther King's birthday
with a ``Martinsday'' celebration Monday, a time of tensions between
black community activists and the police.
   The third annual festival for the slain U.S. civil rights
leader's birthday at the small Harbourfront Theater Center included
a forum about police racism.
   On Sunday, about 2,000 metropolitan Toronto police officers met
to protest political pressure they blame for the filing of a
manslaughter charge against an officer who shot a black man.
   The unofficial ``Martinsday'' festival for more than 12 hours
Monday included speeches, music and dance, and discussions about
non-violence and human rights.
   Charles Roach, president of the Martin Luther King Commemoration
Committee, said the late civil rights leader's birthday was marked
in Canada because ``the civil rights and human rights movement was
not confined.''
   ``It was a universal movement,'' he said in a brief interview.
   Canadian police forces still are largely white, but what are
known in Canada as ``visible minorities'' have grown significantly
in urban areas.
   Toronto, whose metropolitan population is 3.5 million, is
especially known for ethnic communities that have increased through
immigration from Asia, Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean.
   Manslaughter charges were filed last week against Constable David
Deviney in the Aug. 9 death of Lester Donaldson at a Toronto rooming
house. Donaldson was one of two blacks killed in police incidents
over a four-month period last year.
   Police protests, including some cases of work stoppages or
refusals to carry weapons, started immediately after the charge was
filed.
   The police who gathered Sunday agreed to stop their protests, but
they demanded Attorney General Ian Scott's resignation. Scott told
reporters later that he wouldn't resign and denied a part in
deciding the criminal charge.

<TEXT>
   The government on Monday tightened security
procedures for airport workers after two journalists posing as
cleaners exposed major lapses at London's Heathrow Airport after the
bombing of Pan Am Flight 103.
   Earlier, the Sunday Post newspaper in Scotland quoted a former
high-ranking Israeli intelligence agent as saying he believes Abu
Ibrahim, head of a Palestinian group, planned the Dec. 21 bombing,
which killed 270 people.
   ABC News, citing unidentified U.S. and Western intelligence
sources, reported Monday that several dozen intelligence agents from
the Palestine Liberation Organization are working with Pan Am on the
investigation of the bombing.
   PLO leader Yasser Arafat had pledged his group's help in the
investigation, and ABC quoted its sources as saying the PLO's help
has been exceedingly valuable.
   Transport Secretary Paul Channon said passes will be issued only
to airport employees or to outside companies ``which the airport
manager is satisfied are reliable and reputable.''
   ``Clearly, some of the firms in this field in the past have been
far from reliable,'' he said in a statement.
   Channon said cleaners and other airport workers now will have to
have held security passes for at least six months before being
allowed unsupervised access to aircraft and checked-in baggage.
   He also praised the ``swift action'' of the British Airports
Authority in withdrawing access to airplanes from two privately
owned cleaning companies at Heathrow.
   Graham Dudman of the Daily Express and Stewart Norris of London
Weekend Television, working independently, told Friday how they got
jobs as airplane cleaners at Heathrow using fake applications.
   They said that with passes issued by the two cleaning companies
involved, they were able to wander on and off a dozen jets where
they said they could easily have planted a bomb.
   New York-bound Flight 103 was destroyed by a bomb over the
Scottish village of Lockerbie, killing 259 people on the plane and
11 on the ground.
   The flight originated in Frankfurt, West Germany, and baggage and
passengers were transferred to the Boeing 747 at Heathrow.
   In Glasgow, the Sunday Post newspaper quoted former Mossad
officer Raphael Eitan as saying he had ``no doubt'' the bombers were
Ibrahim's May 15 Palestinian group, based in Baghdad, Iraq, and that
the bomb was made there and probably carried on board the plane by
an unwitting accomplice.
   The May 15 group, named for the date the 1948 Arab-Israel war
started, also has offices in Syria and Libya, the newspaper quoted
Eitan as saying.
   ``They are led by Abu Ibrahim, a qualified engineer. In the early
days Ibrahim received all his financial support from Iraqi
intelligence, who continue to provide him with cash and premises,''
Eitan was quoted as saying.
   ``May 15 has only 20 to 30 operatives who concentrate their
terrorist efforts on passenger airlines.''
   May 15 was the only Palestinian group operating that way and with
the expertise to carry out such attacks, Eitan was quoted as saying.
``Ibrahim spent five years designing and perfecting the device which
exploded over Lockerbie.
   ``Ibrahim's detonator is so small it fits into the lock of the
suitcase. The explosive is made of plastic ... (which) is extremely
thin and looks like computer printout paper so it is easily
concealed.''
   ``In the past four years he has failed several times to carry out
a similar atrocity. In 1984, British and West German intelligence
intercepted five suitcases packed with explosives which May 15
intended to plant on unsuspecting airline passengers. Two were found
in London, two were found in Frankfurt.''
   Nothing in the interview attributed a motive to Ibrahim.

<TEXT>
   A business professor who thought
constantly of returning to his home here while held hostage in
Beirut for 20 months settled into a friend's house Monday while
neighbors prepared his residence for him.
   Mithileshwar Singh, who was freed more than three months ago, and
his wife, Lala Mani, returned Sunday night. He said he has no firm
plans for his future, but may write a book about his experiences.
   ``Grand Junction is a great place to sit down, collect your
thoughts and meet some old friends,'' said Singh, 61. ``It will take
time. I had close to two years in captivity and you take time to
bounce back.''
   Singh, a citizen of India who has been a resident alien in the
United States for more than a decade, said he would like to remain
in western Colorado.
   ``When I was in captivity, I thought all the time of coming
home,'' Singh said after his arrival at Walker Field. ``Grand
Junction is my hometown, I consider, and Colorado is my home state.''
   Singh spent six years teaching at a now-defunct business college
in Grand Junction before taking a job at the American University of
Beirut.
   He was kidnapped on Jan. 24, 1987, and released by the Islamic
Jihad Oct. 3. His return to Grand Junction was delayed because Singh
required extensive medical treatment in New York City for diabetes
and other health problems, which were aggravated during his
captivity, said John Curtis, with whom the Singhs are staying until
their house is ready.
   Singh told reporters at the airport Sunday that he expects
President-elect George Bush ``will be more willing to negotiate''
for the freedom of remaining American hostages.
   ``I believe (Secretary of State-designate James) Baker and Bush
will be more flexible on hostage releases,'' Singh said. ``I think
they will be more willing to negotiate and discuss the issues,
because some kind of dialogue should be initiated by our
government.''
   Singh also predicted developments in the status of remaining
American hostages this week, as Bush is sworn in.
   ``I do feel that something should happen by the date of
inauguration,'' Singh said. ``I do not really know, it is my faith.''
   On President Reagan's Inauguration Day in 1981, the Iranians
released the American Embassy hostages they had held for 444 days,
almost at the same time Reagan took his oath.
   Singh's neighbors have spent hours cleaning the interior and yard
of his small ranch-style house. No set time has been set for Singh
to move in.
   Yellow ribbons hang on neighborhood trees, and local Realtors
donated money for carpet cleaning and painting.
   The Singhs were moved by the turnout of about 20 friends at the
airport, some with ``Welcome Home'' signs and many with tears in
their eyes.
   ``This is a great emotional experience,'' Singh said. ``When it
comes to coming back home, it feels different. This journey to Grand
Junction is like that.''

<HEAD>Union Leader Says Crackdown On Corruption Necessary</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANITA SNOW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mexico's top labor leader said on Monday that
he accepted as necessary actions taken against union corruption by
new President Carlos Salinas de Gotari.
   But 88-year-old Fidel Velazquez, head of the Mexican Labor
Federation, also said last week's crackdown on leaders of the
powerful Oil Workers Union on weapons charges was without precedent
in Mexico's labor history.
   Velazquez told a news conference: ``The effect what has happened
in the oil union could have on public opinion is worrisome. It is
hoped that all will turn out well for the country and the oil
worker's union.''
   He did not elaborate, but the oil workers and others have
expressed concern over the violence used in arresting Joaquin
Hernandez Galicia, the longtime de facto chief of the oil workers,
though he held only a minor office.
   Soldiers fired a bazooka to blast down the door of Hernandez
Galicia's home in the northeastern city of Ciudad Madero on Jan. 10
and with agents of the Attorney General's Office arrested him in a
gunfight.
   One federal agent was killed. Fifty other union leaders and
Hernandez Galicia associates also were arrested.
   Velazquez said efforts to wipe out union corruption ``must be
accomplished where necessary.'' He did not refer specifically to the
Oil Workers Union.
   But in an informal meeting with reporters after his news
conference, Velazquez did indicate some disagreement with the
tactics Salinas used in cracking down on the union.
   He said Salinas ``has tried to implant a new politics, using the
maximum force of the law to reform attitudes. I don't believe there
is going to be a clash over the new way of politics, although we
believe that they must use other tactics and strategies.''
   The Mexican Labor Federation includes the oil workers and claims
5 million members of a total national workforce of about 25 million.
   Velazquez also said the man chosen to replace the jailed
secretary-general of the oil workers, whose appointment the
government opposed, may serve only temporarily.
   ``He will only be in charge for the moment,'' he said of Ricardo
Camero Cardiel, named to replace jailed Salvador Barragan Camacho.
``A special general convention will be held to decide the new
secretary-general.''
   Velazquez said he would do whatever he could to clean up and save
the union.
   ``The future of the oil union is uncertain, but we will fight for
its unity and to save the organization,'' Velazquez said.
   Government officials last week complained that Camero Cardiel's
election violated union bylaws. They also said he had close ties to
Barragan Camacho and Hernandez Galicia, both arrested on weapons
charges during the crackdown on oil union leaders.
   The Attorney General's office said 200 Uzi submachine guns were
found inside Hernandez Galicia's home.
   Barragan Camacho pleaded innocent to weapons charges Friday in a
Mexico City hospital where he is undergoing treatment for heart
trouble.
   Five of the 51 were released for lack of evidence; bail was set
for 28, and the rest remained in a Mexico City on Monday.
   The government news agency Notimex said maximum security measures
were imposed to prevent possible escape attempts by those still in
custody, including stringing wires to prevent helicopters from
landing.
   Notimex also said 120 other people, including other oil union
leaders, have sought injunctions against arrest.
   Velazquez said he would not personally support Barragan Camacho
and Hernandez Galicia, both old acquaintances.
   ``Here there is no friendship,'' Velazquez said. ``We will defend
the union, as is our obligation and will continue defending its
workers.''
   He brushed off suggestions that the federation was bowing to
government pressure by not giving Camero Cardiel his support as the
oil union's permanent replacement.

   The former Beatle will answer questions from Soviets in a live
phone-in radio program to be broadcast to the Soviet Union on Jan.
26, the British Broadcasting Corp. said Monday.
   McCartney's appearance follows the November release of his new
album. ``Back in the U.S.S.R.,'' produced exclusively for
distribution in the Soviet Union. The album does not contain the
song of the same name recorded by The Beatles.
   Bootleg copies of the album have made it into the West, selling
for $100 to $250 a copy in the United States and for as much as $885
in London, The New York Times reported last week. In the Soviet
Union, the first batch of 50,000 copies sold for 4 rubles each,
about $6.60 at the official rate.
   The owner of a record store in New York's Greenwich Village that
specializes in collectable records said Monday that he sold two of
the albums before the holidays for about $100. The owner, who asked
that his name not be used, said he obtained the records from someone
who was traveling in the Soviet Union.
   McCartney, 46, said in a statement that the record ``was my
response to glasnost, and I'm looking forward to having a chat with
my Russian fans, courtesy of the BBC.''
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher chatted long-distance to Soviets
last July during a similar program. She took 15 calls on topics from
glasnost to her household chores.

   A group of ultra-right Jewish settlers announced
Monday they plan to form a new independent Jewish state called Judea
in the West Bank and Gaza Strip if the Israeli government withdraws
from the occupied territories.
   ``We will not allow the heart to be torn from the body of the
land of Israel,'' Michael Ben Horin of the Committee for the
Foundation of the State of Judea told a news conference.
   ``Judea, Samaria and Gaza will always remain Jewish. No Israeli
state will ever be permitted to expel Jews from their homes or their
land,'' the bearded Ben Horin said, referring to the West Bank by
the biblical names Judea and Samaria.
   The West Bank and Gaza Strip were captured by Israel in the 1967
Middle East war, and Palestinians have been rebelling in the
territories for the past 13 months to demand an end to Israeli
occupation.
   Ben Horin and other committee members belong to New York-born
Rabbi Meir Kahane's anti-Arab Kach movement.
   He said the group has some supporters from most settlements in
the territories, but leaders of the mainstream settlement movement
Gush Emunim said they do not back the planned state.
   ``I consider this state to be a joke, so I'm not even going to
waste my time criticizing it,'' said Benny Katzover, a longtime
settler leader who founded the settlement of Elon Moreh near Nablus.
   On Nov. 15, PLO chief Yasser Arafat declared an independent
Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   About 70,000 Jewish settlers live in enclaves among the 1.7
million Palestinians in the two occupied territories.
   Committee member Kutiel Ben Yaakov said Palestinians would be
allowed to remain in the future Judea if they ``agree to sit quietly
there like any other non-Jew.''
   ``But we know they would prefer acts of terrorism against us. My
opinion is there is no room for a hostile population. ... The Arabs
will be allowed to leave peacefully for any other Arab state,'' Ben
Yaakov said.
   Ben Horin said the settler group was putting into place the
infrastructure of the future state in preparation for a possible
Israeli withdrawal from the territories as part of an Arab-Israeli
peace settlement.
   Behind him was displayed a newly designed blue-and-white Judean
flag, which had a star of David embossed with a menorah and a lion's
head and carried the words ``The Lion of Judea Lives.'' The settlers
said the phrase referred to the biblical verse ``You are a lion's
cub, O Judah'' (Gen. 49-9).
   Ben Yaacov said the committee wanted to make its announcement at
the West Bank settlement of Kiryat Arba, but settlement leaders
withdrew permission for such a move under government pressure.
   The announcement was made instead in Jerusalem's Hilton Hotel,
where committee members served cakes and coffee to journalists.

<HEAD>Army Breaks Up Student Demonstration with Tear Gas; Leftists Call
For Strike</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Students set flaming-tire barricades
and shouted anti-government slogans in Cap Haitien on Monday before
soldiers dispersed hundreds of protesters. Left-wing groups called
for a nationwide strike.
   About 1,000 students at Phillipe Guerrier High School began
protesting after soldiers showed up at the school, apparently
because unidentified agitators threw stones at the building,
reported the Catholic radio station Radio-Soleil.
   ``Down with Avril!'' shouted some of the protesters, referring to
Lt. Gen Prosper Avril, who heads the military government.
   There were no reports of injuries or arrests at the demonstration
in Haiti's second-largest town, north of the capital.
   Also Monday, the Autonomous Union of Haitian Workers and other
left-wing political groups urged business and organizations to honor
a nationwide general strike called for Tuesday.
   The union has accused the Avril government of being indifferent
to the needs of the poor, who are Haiti's majority.
   In another development, the government called for a national
forum next month to discuss creating an electoral council to oversee
presidential elections.
   In a communique released Sunday, the government said the forum
would be held Feb. 9, a date it said was purposely chosen to fall
after Feb. 7 _ the third anniversary of the fall of dictator Jean
Claude Duvalier.
   ``It (the date) would signal a new departure,'' read the
government's release.
   In November the government published a ``draft decree'' calling
for the creation of an electoral council and asked readers'
comments. But the decree was widely criticized as an attempt on the
part of the government to control the electoral process.
   Most political parties agree on the importance of establishing a
dialogue with the government on how to form an electoral council.
But they have set conditions, including the exclusion of former
Duvalier supporters from the forum.
   Many parties say having a new electoral council would be
unconstitutional since the Constitution already provides for an
independent electoral council.
   The constitution, ratified by 99 percent of the voters in a March
1987 referendum, was suspended by then-military ruler Lt. Gen. Henri
Namphy after a massacre at the polls aborted the Nov. 29, 1987
elections.
   Namphy was overthrown in September last year after a coup led by
rank-and-file soldiers put Avril in power.

   Natural gas explosions that leveled two
homes and damaged a third in two days were called a coincidence by
utility officials, but some residents remain unconvinced.
   Northern Illinois Gas Co. crews reported finding nothing unusual
Monday while scouring more than 100 homes and a school within a mile
radius of the explosions Thursday and Saturday in this town of
17,000 about 60 miles northwest of Chicago.
   ``It's just a coincidence. No relationship exists between the two
explosions,'' said utility spokesman Bob Edwards.
   There were no serious injuries, but some residents remain uneasy.
   ``I was really, really upset. I couldn't sleep last night,'' said
Angela Carparelli, who lives in the neighborhood.
   One house was leveled following an explosion on Thursday and more
explosions on Saturday destroyed one house and knocked another off
its foundation.
   Fire Chief Richard Nebel said it will probably take investigators
weeks to determine the causes of the blasts.
   ``The leaks we know of have been stopped,'' Nebel said late
Monday. ``We are taking test bores and no leaks or vapors have been
found today.''
   Jerry and Becky Rentschler, whose home was destroyed Saturday,
said they almost left their youngest children _ Shelly, 13, and
Matthew, 11 _ home while they went away for the weekend. They
changed their minds at the last minute.
   ``I saw aluminum siding flying through the air and all of a
sudden there was this big flame,'' said 12-year-old Lisa Bernau, who
saw the Rentschlers' house explode. ``It was so scary.''
   Minutes after another neighbor went outside to see what happened,
the neighbor's house was blasted from its foundation, said Nebel.
   On Thursday, James Steurer, 79, was sitting on his bed tying his
shoes when a gas explosion leveled his house and sent him and the
mattress flying into the driveway. He suffered only cuts and
scratches, noting ``absolutely, I'm lucky.''
   In addition to being two days apart, the explosions were at sites
about six blocks apart and in houses fed by two separate gas lines,
Nebel said.
   Government and utility officials insist there is no need for
residents to worry.
   ``It's one of those rare things of Mother Nature or the man
above,'' said investigator Terry Pitkus of the state fire marshal's
office.

   East German authorities have released most of the
190 people detained after police used clubs and water cannon to
break up a demonstration by human rights activists in Leipzig,
church sources said Monday.
   About 800 human rights activists gathered at a downtown square in
the southern city Sunday to demand more democracy from the communist
government.
   First reports said about 80 people were detained and taken away
in police trucks when police dispersed the crowd.
   But Lutheran Church sources said Monday that 190 activists were
detained. They said it took hours to determine the exact number.
   Christoph Wonneberger, a priest at St. Luke Church in Leipzig,
said Monday most of those arrested were released.
   He told The Associated Press by telephone that about 400 people
gathered at his church late Sunday to show solidarity with the
arrested activists.
   The Leipzig protesters also demanded the release of 11 dissidents
arrested on Friday and Saturday for distributing leaflets calling
for Sunday's demonstration.
   Wonneberger said nine of the 11 remained in police custody Monday.
   Sunday's protest coincided with official observances of the 70th
anniversary of the murders of Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht,
founders of the German Communist Party who were killed by soldiers
during a 1919 uprising.

<TEXT>
   Deadly fumes from a faulty furnace killed a man
last week and then claimed the lives of three relatives who stayed
at his home to plan the funeral but knew nothing of the furnace
problem, authorities said Monday.
   The death last Wednesday of Edward G. Zarnow Sr., 89, at his
suburban Greendale home was originally blamed on a heart attack.
Authorities said they didn't conduct an autopsy last week because
they had no reason to suspect his death was caused by lethal fumes
from the basement furnace.
   Carbon monoxide poisoning caused the deaths Sunday of Zarnow's
son from Australia, his granddaughter and the granddaughter's
husband. A daughter-in-law from Australia was hospitalized in
critical condition.
   Milwaukee County Medical Examiner Jeffrey Jentzen said Monday an
autopsy of the elder Zarnow conducted after his four relatives were
found showed he had a high concentration of the carbon monoxide in
his blood.
   Jentzen identified the relatives as Michael Martin, 38, of
Marshfield, Wis., his wife Karen, 37, and Edward C. Zarnow Jr., 57,
of New South Wales, Australia. Zarnow's wife, Rebecca, 56, also of
Australia, remained in critical condition at St. Luke's Medical
Center in Milwaukee.
   Mrs. Zarnow was being treated in a hyperbaric chamber for carbon
monoxide poisoning, officials said.
   Wisconsin Natural Gas spokesman Paul Markovina said investigators
discovered the gas furnance's regulator was maladjusted, causing too
much gas to go into the furnace.
   The overburning caused incomplete combustion that filled the
house with carbon monoxide, a colorless, odorless and lethal gas,
Markovina said.
   The elder Zarnow suffered from heart and lung disease and
cirrhosis of the liver, causing authorities to assume his death was
by natural causes, Jentzen said.
   ``There was nothing to suggest carbon monoxide death at the
home,'' Jentzen said. ``The sequence of the events, details of the
investigation and examination of the body failed to suggest a carbon
monoxide death.
   ``No medical examiner's office in the country would have done
anything different on this case,'' he added.
   Jentzen said when Zarnow's body was discovered, investigators did
not notice anything suspicious or unusual. He added that none of the
investigators at the scene became ill or complained of the common
symptom of carbon monoxide poisoning.
   Jentzen said if there was any evidence to suggest that the elder
Zarnow had died of carbon monoxide poisoning, an autopsy would have
been conducted immediately.
   Jentzen called the incident ``a very rare and unusual collection
of circumstances.''
   Authorities said the elder Zarnow's relatives were staying at his
home over the weekend while planning his funeral. Sunday morning,
his niece, Audrey Brennan, contacted Greendale police because she
had been unable to reach the four victims on the telephone.
   An officer knocked on the door of the Zarnow house about 10:40
a.m. Sunday but got no response and left the scene.
   At 1:51 p.m., Ms. Brennan again called police, saying she had
gone to the residence and had seen three bodies lying on the floor.

<HEAD>57 Tribesmen Arrested For Blocking Logging Roads</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Fifty-seven Penan tribesmen were
arrested after they set up blockades and prevented logging companies
from felling trees in the jungles on Borneo island, Forestry
Director Leo Chai Liang said Tuesday.
   Leo said the Penans, aged between 20 and 50, were arrested Monday
near Miri on Borneo after they refused to remove trees they used to
block the roads. He said authorities acted following complaints from
two logging companies.
   The arrests brought to 81 the number of the tribesmen taken into
custody this year for blocking logging roads in the rain forests.
All are being held pending trial.
   The Penans, some of whom are nomads, claim logging destroys their
livelihood. There are about 10,000 Penans on the island.
   The government maintains most tribespeople are no longer nomadic
and say logging, plantations and other developments would give them
permanent jobs and fixed incomes.

   A visiting Sudanese Cabinet minister
said Monday his government plans a new peace initiative with the
southern rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army.
   Mubarak Fadil Mahadi said an agreement signed in September by the
rebels and the Democratic Unionist Party, which quit the government
coalition after officials refused to accept the accord, ``had
positive elements but also some points which have to be developed,
clarified and abrogated.''
   Mahadi, minister for energy, mining, economic and foreign trade,
did not elaborate on his government's proposed move.
   Rebel leader John Garang and Osman Mirghani, leader of the
Democratic Unionist Party, signed the agreement calling for a
cease-fire in southern Sudan, the lifting of a state of emergency
and the convening by Dec. 31 of a constitutional conference attended
by all political parties.
   The Islamic Front Party, another partner in Prime Minister Sadek
Mahdi's government, rejected the accord, which was not binding on
the prime minister. Garang has vowed not to lay down arms until
Sudan's civilian government drops enforcement of Islamic law.
   Traditionally, the country's Moslem majority dominates the
central government. Most of the southerners are Christian or animist.
   The rebels claim to control 90 percent of the southern
countryside and small towns. During the six-year war, a third of the
region's civilian population of 6 million has fled to the north or
to refugee camps in neighboring countries.

<TEXT>
   A Roman Catholic nun who pressured an unwed woman
to give up her newborn girl may be sued for social work malpractice,
a state judge ruled.
   State Judge Diane Lebedeff ruled in the state's first such case
that Maureen Dunn could sue Sister Rosalie Gilson of Hicksville and
her Long Island agency, the Catholic Home Bureau for Dependent
Children.
   Ms. Dunn, 30, of Wellesley, Mass., filed a $5 million suit
charging the nun and the agency with ``wrongful deprivation of
custody.''
   The judge, in a ruling issued Friday, denied Ms. Dunn's attempt
to add Cardinal John O'Connor of the New York Archdiocese to the
suit as the effective head of the agency and its employees.
   Ms. Dunn gave birth to a girl on April 6, 1986. Four days later
the child was placed with Mark and Diane Finnican of Hicksville. Ms.
Dunn said she was reassured by Sister Rosalie that she could get the
child back within 30 days if she changed her mind about giving her
up for adoption.
   But Ms. Dunn did not regain custody of the baby until March 1987
when she won a bitter court fight.
   A state appeals court ordered the baby, Kara, returned to Ms.
Dunn after finding that she had signed surrender papers ``under
duress and perhaps even fraud'' in a busy diner on May 1, 1986.
   The court said agency officials did nothing when the Finnicans
refused to return the child after Ms. Dunn said on May 20 that she
wanted her baby back.
   Lebedeff said she found no previous cases of social work
malpractice in New York state.
   But she noted the legislature licenses social workers, and that
under that law, that makes the nun and her agency ``professional.''
The judge said ``practicing one's profession fraudulently,
incompetently or negligently constitutes professional misconduct.''
   In addition, the judge said, there could be a custodial
interference issue because the agency ignored Ms. Dunn's pleas for
return of the baby.
   Custodial interference is a misdemeanor punishable by up to a
year in jail and maximum $1,000 fine.

   David Terrell, spokesman for the U.S. Geological Survey, just
called with word that a strong earthquake struck New Britain in the
South Pacific at 7:35 p.m. EST (10:35 a.m. Tuesday local time).
According to Terrell, USGS monitors in Golden, Colo., give it a
preliminary reading of 6.5 on the Richter scale, which would make it
the region since a 6.8 quake struck lastd July.
   Terrell said the epicenter appears to have been about 270 miles
northeast of Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea.

   France is further reducing its forces sent
to this former colony to defend it from neighboring Libya, including
closing down a northern radar outpost, the French military high
command announced Monday.
   ``Taking into account developments that have occurred since the
deployment of Epervier, some reductions have become possible,'' a
command statement said, referring to Operation Epervier
(Sparrowhawk) in February 1986.
   Paris dispatched up to 3,000 troops for the operation, although
by December the number had been reduced to about 1,700.
   The statement did not specify how many soldiers are to be
withdrawn.
   French President Francois Mitterrand announced in mid-December
that an unspecified number of French troops would be withdrawn. In
talks with Chadian President Hissene Habre, the terms of future
withdrawal were discussed.
   The statement from the military command Monday said the radar
base would be closed at Moussoro, 150 miles north of the capital.
   Chad and Libya agreed on a cease-fire Sept. 11, 1987, and have
exchanged diplomatic envoys since then in ongoing efforts to find a
permanent end to the conflict.

   An earthquake capable of severe damage on Monday
shook an area near the island of New Britain, at the east end of
Papua New Guinea.
   The tremor measuring 6.5 on the Richter scale struck at 2:35 p.m.
HST (7:35 EST) Monday, according to the Pacific Tsunami Warning
Center in Honolulu.
   No Pacific-wide tsunami was generated by the earthquake, the
center reported.
   The temblor was centered near the town of Kandrian on New

   New Britain lies off the northeast coast of mainland Papua New
Guinea.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase

   An earthquake of magnitude 6 can cause severe damage. A magnitude
7 quake is a ``major'' earthquake, capable of widespread heavy

<TEXT>
   A black policeman shoved through a
plate glass window by a white officer during a private sting
operation to expose alleged racism said Monday the officer used
violence as a first resort.
   ``The officer in this situation was not responding to any threat
upon his person,'' said Don Jackson, 30, who set up the sting on a
Long Beach street Saturday night for a KNBC-TV camera crew. ``The
officer simply used violence.''
   Jackson, a sergeant who has been on stress-related disability
leave for more than a year from the suburban Hawthorne police
department, said he targeted the Long Beach Police Department
because of complaints to a group called the Police Misconduct
Lawyer's Referral Service of Los Angeles.
   Long Beach police would not comment on the incident, said Lt.
Mike Hill. The department has asked to view the unedited tapes.
   ``We will pursue it aggressively,'' City Manager James Hankla
said. ``If there is evidence of brutality, we will act accordingly.
We will conduct an internal investigation of the incident, and I
won't have any definite comment till the investigation is complete.''
   Jackson rode as a passenger with Jeffrey Hill, 30, an off-duty
state corrections officer, when they were pulled over by police in a
high-crime area of the city 20 miles south of Los Angeles.
   The men said they were pulled over for straddling lanes, which
they denied. Jackson got out of the car after it stopped and police
approached it.
   During an obscenity-laced curbside argument, Long Beach Officer
Mark Dickey ordered Jackson to face a building and put his hands
behind his head.
   Jackson complied, and moments later went through the plate glass
window. ``I'm all right. OK, no problem,'' Jackson said on the tape.
   Hawthorne Police Chief Kenneth R. Stonebraker, at a news
conference Monday, criticized Jackson for joining forces with the
television station.
   ``I submit, that if Mr. Jackson had stayed in the vehicle, as did
the driver, this incident would not have occurred,'' Stonebraker
said, but added ``as a police chief, I do not for one minute,
condone the unlawful use of force or police brutality.''
   Jackson, who alleges racist slurs and actions forced him from the
Hawthorne department and has a stress disability lawsuit scheduled
for trial on March 7, said Monday that Dickey did not have to use
force.
   ``I already cooperated and told him he could search me. I had
already had my hands up and was turned to the window and he slammed
my face in it,'' Jackson said.
   Jackson, who said Monday that his back was hurt in the incident,
added that he was handcuffed when Dickey allegedly threw him against
the police car.
   Police booked Jackson for investigation of interfering with
police and challenging a police officer. They set his bail at
$12,000, then reduced it to $250 and finally released him on his own
recognizance more than six hours later.
   Hill was issued a traffic citation and released.
   David Lynn of the Police Misconduct Lawyer's Referral Service
said that 50 misconduct complaints have been lodged with his group
against the Long Beach Police Department. Of those, 27 were filed by
minorities, and 24 of those involved confrontations with white
officers.
   Ernest McBride, a member of the Long Beach chapter of the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, said his
organization has been trying to get a Long Beach police review board
established.

   New Hampshire hopes its $10,000 in bonds
bought in 1905 from the Soviet Union finally will be a good
investment.
   Officials say chances of getting the Soviets to pay the
long-standing debt have improved thanks to a thaw in U.S.-Soviet
relations and the Soviets' need to borrow Western capital.
   The state bought $10,000 in bonds issued by the czarist
government, as part of the celebration of the end of the
Russo-Japanese War. The treaty that ended the war was negotiated in
Portsmouth.
   When the Communists threw the czar out in 1917 and set up their
own government, they stopped paying the czar's debts.
   Secretary of State William Gardner, who will ask the State
Department to press the state's claim, estimates that with interest,
the state is owed about a half-million dollars.
   The Boston Sunday Globe reported that negotiations are under way
to repay the debts, spurred in part by the Soviet Union's need to
expand its economy. A U.S. law says the country can't lend the
Soviet Union any money until its U.S. debts are paid.
   Gardner said if the Soviets won't pay the claim, the state might
be able to make some money by selling the bonds.
   ``Collectors tell me they are valuable,'' he said.

<HEAD>Ethics Panel Headed By Watergate Conspirator Launches Honesty Campaign</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A citywide ethics panel headed by a figure
in the Watergate conspiracy this week kicks off an eight-month
campaign to promote honesty.
   ``It's a natural first issue to deal with because of the armored
car incident,'' the Rev. Jeb Stuart Magruder said, referring to a
1987 incident in which motorists stopped their cars to scoop up
hundreds of thousands of dollars of cash that had fallen from an
armored truck onto a busy Columbus freeway.
   Magruder, now executive minister at First Community Church in
suburban Marble Cliff, was chosen last year by Mayor Dana G.
Rinehart as the first chairman of the Columbus Commission on Ethics
and Values.
   Magruder, the former deputy director of communications in the
Nixon White House and deputy director of Nixon's Committee to
Re-elect the President in 1972, served seven months in a federal
prison after he admitted destroying records and committing perjury
in the Watergate coverup attempt.
   Ceremonies set for Wednesday will begin the $75,000 campaign,
called ``Take an Honest Look.'' The committee will plaster its
message on billboards and provide public service ads featuring the
campaign's theme song. Schools, churches and businesses are also to
take part in the effort.
   The project calls for a television show featuring an ``honesty
test,'' an honesty week and having honesty awards, producing
leaflets and coffee mugs, pen sets and other business items with
messages about honesty and urging pastors to preach sermons about
being truthful.
   ``We are simply trying to raise people's consciousness,''
Magruder said.
   Had he been more conscious of ethics and values, Magruder said he
might not have become involved in the Watergate conspiracy.
   ``If Nixon had called us all in and said, `We're not going to
have anything done in this administration that's illegal or
unethical,' it probably would not have happened.''
   ``I think it's a characteristic in American life that there is
redemption,'' Magruder said.

   A judge on Monday denied a request to
move the murder trial of Noah Robinson, the half-brother of Jesse
Jackson, but said he would reconsider the motion if prospective
jurors appear biased by pre-trial publicity.
   Jury selection began in the trial of Robinson, a Chicago
businessman who is accused of hiring members of Chicago's El Rukn
street gang to kill Leroy ``Hambone'' Barber, a former employee and
a childhood friend of Robinson's in Greenville. Three jurors were
selected Monday.
   He also is accused of conspiring to murder Janice Denise
Rosemond, a witness to the slaying who later survived a brutal
stabbing attack. Five El Rukn members also are charged. Their cases
are being handled separately.
   Albert Taylor Jr., an attorney for Robinson, had asked the trial
be moved to Charleston because of the publicity surrounding the case.
   He entered as evidence a tape of news reports by WYFF-TV in
Greenville and said The Greenville News and the Greenville Piedmont
had published 137 stories on the case since November 1987.
   He said it was ``inconceivable'' that any prospective juror did
not hear or read the news reports.
   Taylor also accused Solicitor Joe Watson of releasing evidence to
the media in an attempt to influence prospective jurors.
   Watson denied the charge. ``I have done everything I could to
keep down pre-trial publicity,'' he told Circuit Judge James Moore.
   Watson said Robinson and his attorneys contributed to the
publicity because they had sent numerous releases to the media.
   Moore gave no reason for his decision to deny the motion. He
said, however, that he would be willing to reconsider the motion
during jury selection if it appears that the publicity has damaged
Robinson's chance for a fair trial.
   Jury selection could take several days to complete, officials
said.
   The judge dismissed on Monday candidates who were related to
anyone involved in the case, medically unable to be a participant,
over 65 and unwilling to serve or already decided about the guilt or
innocence of Robinson.
   After cutting the number of prospective jurors from about 150 to
112 Monday afternoon, the judge divided them into four groups of 28
people each. People in the first group were questioned by attorneys
Monday and officials were to call the remaining groups.
   When a jury is selected, that person would be taken home, allowed
to pack and then sequestered, officials said.
   About 50 people watched the proceedings in the Greenville County
Courthouse. All spectators had to pass through a metal detector
before they could enter the third-floor courtroom.
   Robinson has maintained that he is a victim of a political
conspiracy caused partly by the success of his half-brother.
Robinson and Jackson share the same father, but the former
Democratic presidential hopeful has said he has had no recent
contact with his half-brother.
   Barber was shot in the head on Jan. 2, 1986, while standing in a
phone booth inside a Greenville shopping center owned by Robinson.
   In a brief arraignment held last week in Greenville, Robinson
pleaded innocent to the Barber slaying. He was jailed for about 10
weeks after his September arrest until a judge agreed to let him
post $1 million bond.

   Wending their way over the green mountains of
Vietnam through the misty Hai Van Pass, six former U.S. Marines
revisited the battlefields of fallen comrades on a sentimental
journey into the past.
   Where only heavily armed military convoys dared to go two decades
ago, they rode in a van over the 68 miles of winding roads from Da
Nang to Hue, stopping en route to embrace the beauty of the
mountains and the serene waters of the South China Sea.
   ``This pass was continually harassed,'' said Robert Dalton, a
54-year-old free-lance writer from Davidsonville, Md., during a stop
Sunday at an old French fort. Dalton, as a captain 20 years ago,
commanded Kilo Company, 26th Marine Regiment, First Division, which
patrolled sections of the Hai Van Pass.
   ``This is fantastic, the natural splendor,'' said Nate Genna, a
maintenance man from Boston, during another stop to look out over
the bay at a tiny fishing village set off by a steepled church in
its center.
   ``I've never seen this before,'' said Genna, 41. ``The only
mountains I saw were west of Dong Ha,'' a former Marine base farther
north.
   Their odyssey brought them at nightfall to Hue, the imperial
capital from the end of the 18th century until the abdication of
Vietnam's last emperor, Bao Dai, in 1945. It was here that U.S.
Marines fought house-to-house and lost 142 men during North
Vietnam's Tet offensive of 1968.
   The Marines, on a 10-day visit to Vietnam, arrived in Da Nang by
plane from Hanoi.
   ``I had butterflies in my stomach just seeing the place, the
mountains around it,'' said Frank Noe, a firefighter from Stoughton,
Mass. ``I could see the strip from way ahead when we were comimg
in.''
   For Noe, it brought back memories of his first arrival in Vietnam
in November 1967 when he landed in Da Nang as a frightened
19-year-old kid.
   The revetments then were filled with U.S. jets that regularly
bombed North Vietnam and the air base was rustling with military
activity. But this time, the 40-year-old Noe saw only the red noses
of Vietnamese MiG fighters between the embankments, many of them
rusting away.
   A warmer reception awaited them in Da Nang, which was once a part
of South Vietnam.
   ``There's more of the relaxed atmosphere here than in the
north,'' said Mike Wallace, a 41-year-old farmer from Langdon, Kan.
   ``Look at the reception,'' said Dalton. ``The people move a
little bit brighter. Their faces are a little more open. They're a
lot less constrained and they know us, they know Americans. They
smile a little bit more than the people up north do and they just
accommodate Americans a lot more easily.''
   ``A lot look mysteriously familiar, but at the same time
something isn't the same,'' said Genna. ``I think what's missing is
my youth. You can't go home, like the saying goes. I was trying not
to think. I was just looking. I saw a place I saw a long time ago,
it looks the same but it's not the same because I'm not the same.
I'm 22 years older.''
   When William Johnson of Manchester, Conn., landed in Da Nang in
October 1967, he was nervous.
   ``This time, I was hoping I could see what I saw the last time,
not a war going on, but I mean recognizable things which I don't
see. I never even got into Da Nang really,'' said Johnson, 41.
   In Hanoi, the former Marines were greeted with mostly stoic looks
and an occasional forced smile from Vietnamese soldiers they once
fought against.
   Gene Spanos, a 39-year-old police lieutenant from Rosemont, Ill.,
pulled out a map and showed to Vietnamese officers the sites of
former U.S. bases just below what was once the demilitarized zone
that divided the country at the 17th parallel.
   Spanos and the former Marines, all except Dalton members of the
11th Marines, said they were concerned that land mines their
engineer battalion had planted were still killing and wounding
civilians.
   ``In wartime the Americans also sprayed chemicals,'' one of the
Vietnamese officers said. They shook hands for photographers and
television cameras in an embrace that was less than spontaneous.
   ``You always had to carry a loaded rifle, a helmet and a flak
jacket and anything could happen,'' said Genna. ``I always dreamed
about returning here just to take a nice slow relaxed walk without
any fear, and I finally did it 21 years later.''

   President-elect Bush's choice of a moderate,
pragmatic cabinet means the confirmation process that begins this
week will lack the ideological overtones of the Reagan years and
instead offer debate on substantive issues.
   The Democrats who control Congress are likely to use the sessions
to force Bush's nominees to say how they will carry out their boss'
campaign promises to tend to neglected social programs in a time of
extreme fiscal austerity, and to test the strength of Bush's
no-new-taxes pledge.
   ``They will want to build a record for why new revenues are going
to be needed,'' said Charles Cook, a Washington political analyst.
``The Democrats are going to let the nominees build their case for
them.''
   Initial reactions on Capitol Hill to Bush's cabinet selections
have been generally positive. The majority of those named are
veterans of federal government service. Three are holdovers from the
Reagan administration, five others have been previously confirmed by
the Senate for other jobs, and four are former members of Congress.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, has said he is
impressed with the appointees as a group and expects the Senate to
work well with them.
   ``They are generally experienced, hopefully pragmatic people, and
we won't have the rigid ideology of the first Reagan term,''
Mitchell said. ``I am trying very hard to establish from our side an
atmosphere of cooperation and bipartisanship.''

campaign in 1976, he started it with a ceremony in his tiny hometown
and promised to return after he won the office.
   It's 13 years later, and Tampico is still waiting.
   And residents wonder why the title ``birthplace of a president''
never translated into tourism and fame for this dusty farming
community.

   Interior Secretary Donald P. Hodel is leaving
Washington convinced that leaders of environmental organizations are
much too partisan and out of touch with their members.
   Hodel also said in a farewell interview that he believes the
global warming called the ``greenhouse effect'' has been overblown,
and the cost of cleaning up the nation's nuclear weapons plants has
been overstated.
   Hodel said he was ``delighted and astounded'' that the losing
Democratic campaign of Michael Dukakis argued, in Hodel's words,
that ``you don't have to choose between an improving environment and
an adequate energy and minerals supply; you can do both'' _ his own
position.
   The environmentalists who attacked President Reagan's first
interior secretary, James Watt, whom Hodel served as deputy, were
``the anti-can-do-both'' people, Hodel said.

   While some Americans still await word of a
husband, father or son, U.S.-Vietnamese teams patrol the countryside
in the biggest effort yet to find remains of fallen airmen and send
them on a final, peaceful journey home.
   Some families, an unspecified but apparently small number, have
been told five teams are investigating and excavating sites where
relatives are believed to have crashed during air strikes between
1964 and 1972. This is the fourth joint operation since October.
   ``Due to privacy considerations of the affected families we
cannot discuss the specifics,'' a statement from the U.S. delegation
said. ``However, those families have been notified of the
investigation and will be fully advised of the results.''
   The two dozen U.S. specialists will be in Vietnam until Jan. 23
and will leave with 25 sets of remains that are being prepared for
repatriation and identification at the U.S. Army laboratory in
Hawaii.

   Heart disease remains the nation's
biggest killer, taking a life every 32 seconds, but researchers have
made ``unbelievable'' progress in taming the disease, according to
the American Heart Association.
   Figures released Sunday show that deaths from heart and blood
vessel disease have dropped 24 percent during the past decade.
Researchers attribute the improvement to healthier living habits and
better treatment.
   ``The public ought to appreciate the progress that has been made
in heart disease over the past 20 years,'' said Dr. Myron L.
Weisfeldt, the association's president-elect.
   ``It's almost unbelievable. There is almost no form of heart
disease that we can't approach without meaningful treatment.''

   After a march by 5,000 opposition

give the opposition greater political opportunity and those who
don't want it can ``look for their democracy in Miami.''
   In his Sunday speech, Ortega also said he would propose severe
budget cuts that would require extensive government layoffs.
   Sunday's opposition demonstration, the largest since a July 10
rally in the town of Nandaime that police broke up with tear gas and
beatings, was called to protest the leftist government's economic
management and political repression.
   The peaceful march through Managua's streets was organized by the
Nicaraguan Democratic Coordinating Committee, a coalition of 14
opposition parties and several unions.

   An offer of free 40-acre parcels for people
willing to settle in a remote county on the Canadian border has
brought more than 4,000 inquiries, some from as far afield as West
Germany and Guam.
   ``It's been mind-boggling,'' said Jim Lemieux, a member of the
Bidstead Advisory Council in International Falls, county seat of
Koochiching County.
   Homesteaders will be required to build a home and live there for
at least 10 years. They are expected to be self-sufficient, so as
not to drain the local economy, and are subject to an extensive
credit and criminal-records check.
   The offer received widespread publicity last month, and since
then Lemieux said the county has received inquiries from all 50
states and Canada, Ireland, England, West Germany, Spain, Mexico,
Japan, Puerto Rico and Guam.

<HEAD>Scandal Shakes Yugoslavia's Communist Elite</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DUSAN STOJANOVIC</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SARAJEVO, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A real estate scandal has uncovered
rampant corruption among the communist elite here in the Yugoslavian
republic of Bosnia. A former party chief and dozens of officials
have lost their jobs.
   The scandal involved the Adriatic fishing village of Neum, which
was turned into a chic playground for top communists.
   The scandal also may have hastened the departure of Premier
Branko Mikulic, who in December became the first government chief in
communist Yugoslavia to resign.
   Like other politicians implicated in the scandal, Mikulic comes
from Bosnia, once seen as the country's most repressive and
dogmatically communist republic and now increasingly tainted by
corruption.
   Neum, 75 miles southwest of Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital, was
transformed in just 10 years from a sleepy seaside village to a
resort of glittering white marble villas.
   Hundreds of top Bosnian officials reportedly built private villas
with illegal bank loans obtained with the connivance of local bank
officials.
   In return, the bankers reportedly received political favors and
rapid promotions.
   The affair has thrown a sharp light on the growth of corruption
in Yugoslavia since the death in 1980 of Josip Broz Tito, who
prevented the state-run media from reporting corrupt practices among
officials during his time as leader.
   Bosnian officials deny anything is distinctly bad about their
region, saying that corruption is widespread in Yugoslavia's five
other republics.
   ``I don't understand why they are only after us, since similar
loans were taken by almost every Yugoslav who had friends working in
banks,'' said one ranking Bosnian official accused of involvement in
the Neum scandal. He spoke only on condition of anonymity.
   But Bosnia and its senior officials have been at the center of
two of the nations biggest corruption scandals. According to a
Sarajevo television report, the two scandals have led to the ouster
of about 2,000 leading politicians, managers, police officers and
other officials.
   In September 1987, Yugoslavia's vice president, Hamdija Pozderac,
resigned after being implicated in a Bosnian agricultural company,
Agrokomerc, that issued uncovered bills of exchange worth the
equivalent of nearly $1 billion.
   The managers of Agrokomerc, now on trial, reportedly relied on
their influence with local politicians to persuade banks to issue
the uncovered bills.
   In October, Milanko Renovica, national Communist Party chief in
1986-87, resigned from the ruling Politburo over the scandal in Neum.
   According to press reports, he used his influence to obtain
illegal loans that financed a mansion in Neum, several apartments in
Sarajevo and an opulent lodge near his native village in the Bosnian
mountains.
   Todo Kurtovic, the Communists' top ideologue throughout the
1970s, was expelled from the party in December on grounds that he
secured seven unusually favorable loans worth the equivalent of
$90,000 to build his Neum villa.
   According to press accounts neither confirmed nor denied by
authorities, most of the villas of Bosnian officials in Neum were
built free by Bosnian companies and covered in white marble obtained
at ``ridiculously low prices.''
   The real-estate scandal, first uncovered by Bosnian journalists
and later publicized by the press in Belgrade, has now led to the
replacement of almost all of Bosnia's ruling elite.
   They face confiscation of their property and even criminal
charges, press reports say.
   Mikulic has publicly denied widespread allegations that he was
implicated in the real-estate scandal. State-run newspapers,
however, published a list of landowners in Neum and said Mikulic's
wife owns a plot acquired under ``suspicious circumstances.''
   In an account similar to previous press reports, the head of a
bank branch in Sarajevo, Dragan Djodjic, said in an interview
Bosnian politicians qualified for loans by having top bank
executives order a brief transfer of foreign currency from the
savings account of a Yugoslav working abroad to the applicant's
account.
   This, he explained, would temporarily provide the politician with
the foreign currency, on the books, that he needed as collateral to
secure the loan, which would then be immediately approved.
   The hard currency funds would immediately be returned to the
original account, making the transaction difficult to trace, Djodjic
added.
   Since the repayment terms of the long-term loans did not include
the usual adjustment provision for inflation, which hit 250 percent
at the end of 1988, repayments will soon be reduced to what the
Belgrade newspaper Vecernje Novosti called ``the value of a pack of
cigarettes.''

<HEAD>Labor, Industry, Government in Crusade to Save Dutch Environment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROLAND DE LIGNY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Labor, industry and the government
are joining in a crusade to save the fast-deteriorating environment
of the Netherlands, described by a union chief as the ``trash can of
the continent.''
   Not only does pollution come from the Netherlands' own postwar
industrialization, it also flows down the Rhine River from chemical
plants in Switzerland and West Germany.
   The pollution issue has been played down by officials in recent
years, although others have issued repeated warnings about the air,
water and soil, but now unprecedented steps for the Netherlands
apparently are about to be taken.
   The 900,000-member Federation of Dutch Trade Unions has linked up
in the save-the-environment effort with its traditional sparring
partner, the Dutch Organization of Enterprises, industry's major
umbrella group.
   Premier Ruud Lubbers joined in on the government's side. He told
a group of foreign reporters: ``One of our major future aims will be
to establish an economic structure that safeguards the ecological
balance.''
   Queen Beatrix devoted her entire traditional Christmas address to
the environment.
   ``Slowly, the Earth is dying and we think about what was
previously unthinkable _ the end of life itself,'' she told her
subjects.
   The new crusade reflects an unease in the Netherlands over the
declining quality of the environment, which only a few decades ago
was virtually unpolluted.
   In recent years, the Dutch media have reported on the pollution
of drinking water by pesticides and herbicides spilled into the
Rhine River by Swiss, West German and Dutch chemical plants.
   Acid rain, attributed mainly to nitrates rising into the
atmosphere from manure used in Netherlands' huge agricultural sector
and the country's 5 million cars, is rapidly becoming a prime
environmental threat.
   One chemical dump after another is being discovered under housing
developments built in the 1960s and under new golf courses. A recent
government report estimated that about 9,000 heavily polluted sites
are scattered all over the Netherlands, leaching noxious substances
into the ground water.
   The Netherlands is a prime manufacturer of chemicals, petroleum
products and electronic equipment.
   ``Care for the environment is such an essential task ... that I
do not hesitate to say that for us, (it) is the top priority,'' said
Jan Kamminga, the chairman of the Dutch Association of Small and
Medium-Sized Industries.
   ``Dutch companies should accept their responsibility ... and
contribute substantially to the solution of the problem.''
   With 100,000 affiliated companies employing 1 million of the
Netherlands' 14.6 million people, the association is one of the
major players in the Dutch industrial field.
   After Kamminga made his remarks in a speech, Johan van
Stekelenburg of a trade union group and Chris van Leede of the
industry group held a news conference to announced their joint
effort to save the environment.
   They said they would include environmental issues in the
collective bargaining process.
   ``Our declaration will not instantly change the world, but it
commits us to take such (environmental) issues into serious
consideration,'' Van Leede said in an interview later. ``It is not
an empty promise.''
   ``We must clean up the Netherlands, which is rapidly becoming the
trash can of the continent,'' Van Stekelenburg said.
   ``Given these huge problems, the industry and union initiative
can only be a beginning,'' said Marijke Brunt, a spokeswoman for the
Nature and Environment Foundation, one of this nation's most
influential conservationist organizations. ``If they fail to
implement a radical restructuring of Dutch industry within 10 years,
it will be too late.''
   Such a turnaround of the Dutch industrial complex would involve
huge investments in purification plants, research into alternative
manufacturing technologies, and the development of new products that
are harmless to the environment, such as biodegradable plastics.
   Controversy is brewing, however, over the question of who will
pay for a cleaner environment, the cost of which no authorities have
even dared estimate.
   Premier Lubbers told the foreign reporters: ``Pollution is not
the result of activities of the government. ... We will have to pay
together, as companies and citizens.
   ``There is economic growth. Let's not add it all to profits or
personal income, but use part of it to improve the environment.''
   Industry's Kamminga, differed. He said that for the
export-dependent Dutch industry, ``an unbridled rise in the
production costs ... would be attempted suicide.''

<HEAD>Canadian Government Tries to Curtail Influx of Refugees</HEAD>

   A government attempt to clamp down on the flow of
refugees into Canada is drawing protests from church and human
rights groups. They say it is unjust and won't work.
   The Canadian Council of Churches has taken the new provisions t
court.
   ``We want the law and the practice to live up to what are
fundamental principles of justice,'' Tom Clark, a spokesman for the
council, said in an interview.
   A backlog of some 85,000 refugee cases had built up since the
government declared a limited amnesty in May 1986 for about 22,000
people then claiming refugee status.
   At the New Year, Immigration Minister Barbara McDougall announced
there would be no amnesty this time and the government would spend
$100 million ($83 million U.S.) for an emergency program to screen
all cases in the backlog over the next two years.
   New, tighter regulations intended to keep any questionable cases
out of Canada on arrival at airports and border stations took effect
Jan. 1.
   ``Many people came here making refugee claims to circumvent our
immigration laws,'' McDougall said. ``We must restore integrity to
our refugee and immigration system.''
   The change does not affect the prevailing immigration system,
which is expected to allow 150,000 to 160,000 people into Canada
this year through normal channels.
   The government clearly believes a significant percentage of those
claiming to be refugees are fleeing poor economic conditions rather
than political persecution, but the critics say otherwise.
   Dan Heap, immigration spokesman for the socialist New Democratic
Party, says the rising number of refugees can be pegged to the Third
World's conflicts while the boom in jet travel has made it easier to
reach Canada.
   Significant numbers of refugee claimants came to Canada in 1988
from such countries as Nicaragua, Iran, Sri Lanka, Lebanon, Panama,
Somalia, El Salvador and India.
   ``The determination of refugee status is not an immigration
question,'' Heap said in an interview at his district office. ``It's
a human rights question.''
   In the House of Commons, Heap represents the heavily ethnic
Trinity-Spadina district of downtown Toronto, a traditional
destination for immigrants and refugees.
   His solution is to devote enough staff to refugees' hearings so
their cases can be taken up within three months. The hope is to
remove the incentive for those who come to Canada for a few years of
higher pay checks while their cases drag on.
   Canada is the world's second largest country in area but with a
population of only 26 million. Much of its vast northern territory
has limited potential for settlement. Unemployment was about 8
percent in 1988.
   At a community legal clinic not far from Heap's office, lawyer
Robert Adamson works regularly with refugee claims.
   ``It's not as though people suddenly decided Canada's the easiest
place to get to,'' he said. ``There are reasons people leave their
homes.''
   In addition to genuine refugee claims, Adamson said, the general
confusion surrounding Canadian policy of the past few years has
encouraged some to try to reach Canada in hopes there would be
another amnesty.
   ``We see everybody,'' he said. ``If they don't have a refugee
claim, we tell them that.''
   But Adamson said he expects the new system to screen refugee
claims quickly will bog down before unrealistic timetables for fair
hearings.
   The backlog has built up since the Supreme Court in 1985 ruled
that anyone claiming refugee status was entitled to a full hearing,
not just a review of documents as had been the system.
   Clark at the Canadian Council of Churches said that while the
government appears to believe Canada has reached a level of
saturation with refugees, ``the church's view is that we don't think
we're there.''
   He added that the practice has been good while the laws on the
books allow ``the whims of the government of the moment.'' He said
the church council's goal is to bring the refugee laws into
agreement with the practice.
   Canada's record of receiving refugees, more than half a million
since World War II, has been praised internationally.
   Roger White of the federal Immigration Department said it is the
highest per capita level of the industrialized countries. He said
the number of refugee claims rose from 1,800 in 1981 to 30,000 last
year.
   White, in a phone interview from Ottawa, said the system has been
reeling in part because of ``unscrupulous consultants, scam artists
telling tales and basically aiding and abetting these influxes.''

<HEAD>Arab Children Imitate Violence of Uprising Against Israelis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LOUIS MEIXLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   During a kindergarten show-and-tell period in
the occupied Gaza Strip, a pupil told of throwing a rock at an
Israeli army jeep, causing it to overturn and kill the soldiers in
it.
   It was all in the child's imagination, of course, said
kindergarten administrator Mary Khas in describing what Arab
educators and psychologists say is a trend of violent fantasies of
children growing up in the 13-month Palestinian uprising against
Israeli occupation of the Gaza Strip and West Bank.
   The experts said Arab children who are 5 and 6 years old will
become more aggressive as they become desensitized to the violence
and predicted the Israeli-Palestinian conflict may become more
brutal as the children grow up.
   ``All the children have these fantasies,'' said Khas, director of
the American Friends Service Committee's kindergarten program in the
Gaza Strip, which runs 14 schools for 1,500 pupils.
   She said the violent behavior also shows up on the playground.
   ``When they're alone they play a game called Arabs and Jews,''
she said. ``They bang on doors and arrest each other.
   ``I saw one child, who played an Israeli, holding another boy's
head to the sand and screaming, `yamous, yamous,' lick it, lick it,
imitating the Hebrew-accented Arabic the soldiers speak,'' she said.
   Bethlehem University's Nadira Kvorkian said such hostile feelings
are spilling over into family life.
   ``The children are learning how to deal with problems in a
violent way and I'm seeing more family violence,'' Kvorkian said.
From last May to August, she studied the effects of the uprising on
80 Palestinian children 11 to 14 years old.
   ``When they have an argument with their brothers the first thing
they think of is fighting, of throwing stones,'' she said.
   Kvorkian said the children also are becoming alienated from their
families, which they see as incapable of protecting them from the
Israeli army.
   ``Children complain that the family can't solve their problems
and parents are now afraid of their children,'' Kvorkian said.
   ``They try to keep the kids inside so they don't throw stones,
but the children want to act like men,'' she said. ``They feel that
their parents have been sitting in the refugee camps and doing
nothing for 40 years.''
   Most of the refugees have been living in camps since fleeing from
what is now Israel in the 1948 Middle East war. Others came to the
camps after Israel captured the West Bank from Jordan and the Gaza
Strip from Egypt during the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.
   The generation gap was illustrated in another study in which the
Arab father, the traditional role model in Palestinian society, was
shown as virtually powerless in the dreams of 11-year-old children
in refugee camps.
   In 58 out of 75 dreams involving the Arab-Israeli conflict, the
father was incapable of rescuing his family from the army, according
to a study by Dr. Shafiq Masalha for Save the Children, an
international relief organization.
   Masalha said that in a typical dream a child will say: ``The army
entered our house and tied up my father in front of my eyes. I
screamed, `God help us, our lives are in danger.' Then I woke up.''
   Masalha and a research team of four interviewed 24 children in
July 1988 for his clinical study.
   He said 70 percent of the dreams he randomly collected centered
on the Israeli-Arab struggle. In a similar study in 1982, the
conflict appeared in 50 percent of the dreams.
   ``In dreams there are more confrontations with the Israeli army,
and the children are afraid,'' Masalha said. ``But in the dreams I
analyzed before the uprising the children sometimes panicked in the
confrontations and the dreams became nightmares.
   ``I see this much less now,'' he said.
   Masalha said the children are growing less fearful of the
military and increasingly identifying with the ``shebab,'' the
young, rock-throwing Palestinians who confront the Israeli army.
   ``It seems as though the children are relating to the shebab as a
father figure,'' Masalha said.
   ``One of the consequences of this change is that there are more
confrontations with the Israeli army,'' he said.
   Khas said pre-schoolers have come to idolize the shebab.
   ``They are the heros, the strong people,'' she said. ``They are
what kids want to be.''

the risk of life.'' _ Lt. Col. Virgil I. ``Gus'' Grissom (1926-1967).

<HEAD>A New President Confronts The Hostage Dilemma</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new president with an old problem, George
Bush knows of no swift stroke that would free the American hostages
in Lebanon _ but he also knows that a signal to Iran could help.
   So the president-elect says he can visualize a day of better U.S.
relations with Iran, a statement which in itself is a gesture he
hopes could help produce ``keys to unlock the locks.'' Meanwhile, he
promises to pursue any path that might point toward freedom for the
hostages.
   Eight years after the Tehran embassy hostages were freed on
President Reagan's inauguration day, Bush comes to the White House
with nine Americans held captive by Lebanese kidnappers.
   Their plight had not produced the air of crisis that persisted
while 52 Americans were held in the embassy for 444 days, until the
hour Reagan took office.
   With smaller numbers and no identifiable villains to blame, let
alone televise nightly, the case of the Lebanon hostages is a
nagging headache that won't go away.
   Reagan did not mention the hostages in his farewell address. At
his last news conference he said the United States eventually must
negotiate with Iran, ``because they have control of these people.''
   Bush isn't so certain that Iran fully controls the situation.
   ``... My view is be alert to opportunity,'' he said in an
interview. ``I think the cease fire between Iran and Iraq has
potential for amelioration of that hostage situation, but I think it
would be improper to assume that Iran controls a key to all these
hostages. I don't think we know that.''
   Nevertheless, the president-elect believes improved U.S.
relations with Iran could help. ``I'm one who thinks it's in our
interest to have better relations with Iran. And I'm one who thinks
that Iran can take a handful of steps and demonstrate that they want
better relations with the United States.
   ``And so to the degree Iran holds the key, holds most of the keys
to unlock the locks, that could be helpful,'' he said.
   He emphasized his message to Tehran: ``They'll read this. They
know me ... I know their views ... I don't start off with the view
that we always have to be at loggerheads with Iran.
   ``I also don't start off with the naive view that if you have
some dramatic meeting, that's going to result in the instant release
of hostages who are not held by Iran. . . may be held by clients of
Iran.''
   Meanwhile, he promised, the new administration will seek a way
out. ``We are not going to leave any rabbit trail unexplored.''
   The hostage-takers in Lebanon do not directly reflect a
government but, instead, shadowy groups of Shi'ite Moslem extremists
operating in the turmoil of Beirut. Still, they are responsive to
the will of Iran. Three captive Americans were freed while the
Reagan administration was sending secret arms shipments to Iran in
1985 and 1986.
   Longest held of the captive Americans is Terry Anderson, chief
Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press, kidnapped on
March 16, 1985 _ two months after President Reagan began the term of
office that ends on Friday. In addition to the nine Americans, at
least seven citizens of other nations are held hostage.
   The Iranian hostage crisis was an issue in the presidential
campaign of 1980, working to Reagan's advantage in the election that
ousted Jimmy Carter. But the dilemma of freeing them never became
his; they were released just as he took office. The kidnappings in
Lebanon recreated the problem in a different form, and led to the
worst internal crisis of the Reagan years, the Iran-Contra scandals.
   The Reagan administration found no solution, despite the
president's early vow that ``our policy will be swift and effective
retribution'' against hostage-takers. There was no way to make
retaliation work in Lebanon.
   Since disclosure of the Iran arms-for-hostages shipments, the
administration has played down the hostage situation it could not
resolve.
   Bush insisted there was no decision to lower visibility and push
the hostages down the administration agenda because of that episode.
He said that wasn't a matter of policy.
   But it certainly was a matter of fact.

<HEAD>Boom Attracts Foreign Investors to Turkey</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EMEL ANIL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   On the road in from the airport is a
gleaming new shopping center, called Galleria after its look-alike
in Houston, Texas.
   The complex includes Turkey's first foreign department store, a
branch of the French Printemps chain. Nearby are a Kentucky Fried
Chicken, a Pizza Hut and a McDonald's.
   The mall is an eye-catching symbol of the economic transformation
Turkey has undergone since Premier Turgut Ozal launched his economic
liberalization policies after coming to office in 1983.
   The economy, spurred by massive government spending, is the
fastest growing in Western Europe with an average annual real growth
rate of 7 percent for the past three years.
   And despite soaring inflation, foreign capital is pouring in.
   The State Planning Office authorized $536 million in new foreign
investment applications in 1987 and $800 million in 1988, bringing
up total foreign investment in the country close to $3 billion.
   Although foreign investment is a still a fraction of domestic
investment, it is 10 times what it was in 1980.
   Arab, Japanese and West European capital have a share in the
increase. But the most impressive entries have been by U.S.
companies, whose numbers have risen from 16 in 1980 to 100 in 1988.
   Ibrahim Cakir, head of the State Planning Office's foreign
investment department, predicts an injection of at least $1 billion
of foreign capital this year.
   Not everyone is so optimistic.
   Turkey's private sector is being squeezed by the government's
tight monetary policies designed to combat inflation, which averaged
75 percent in 1988. Inflation was 40 percent in 1987.
   Anticipating lower demand, Turkish manufacturers have started to
cut back production, with the car industry in the lead.
   One concern is that inflation will devalue the original capital
once it comes in and is converted into Turkish lira.
   If Ozal's economic stabilization program is successful in 1989
and inflation declines, confidence in Turkey will remain strong,
specialists say.
   ``Inflation is a short-term problem. It will not wipe out all the
gains,'' said Attila Uras, manager of the Manufacturer's Hanover
Trust branch in this financial capital.
   An executive for the Coca-Cola Co. thinks investments undertaken
so far will lure in additional investments. A new investment by
Coca-Cola of $13.5 million encouraged American National Can Co. to
enter Turkey with an equal amount for a new bottling plant for the
soft-drink industry.
   One main attraction for the foreign investor is the size of the
domestic market, executives say. Turkey's population is 55 million
and growing.
   Turkey is advantageously situated at the crossroads of the Middle
East and Eastern and Western Europe _ markets where Turkish
businessmen already have made significant inroads.
   Other attractions include the tourism potential of a country with
miles of unpolluted Aegean and Mediterranean coasts, a low-wage
labor force, and liberal rules and regulations, company executives
say.
   All sectors are open to foreign investment and tax breaks are
available. Foreign companies can own all the shares in a Turkish
venture, and they can send profits home freely.
   Red tape has been reduced significantly. An application that took
years for approval is now handled in a month or two, said Cakir of
the State Planning Office.
   Hopes are also pinned on Turkey's bid to become a full member,
eventually, of the European Economic Community, although prospects
for the new future are considered dim.
   There have been a series of foreign buyouts, among them Procter
and Gamble's buyout of a local detergent manufacturer and the
takeover of a paper company by James River of the United States.
   The Ozal government also hopes foreign firms will buy shares in
Turkish public sector companies.
   Turkish stocks worth $60 million are expected to be floated this
year on the New York Stock Exchange. The International Finance Corp.
is underwriting the project.
   One drawback for many Turks and foreign lenders is Turkey's
foreign debt, which has risen from $16 billion in 1980 to $39
billion.
   At the same time, economic growth has yet to benefit Turkey's
masses in real terms. Annual per capita income has been hovering
around $1,200 for the past 15 years because of the steady
devaluation of the Turkish lira and high population growth rate of
2.5 percent.

<HEAD>Despite Some Gains, Press is Still Threatened in Chile</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EDUARDO GALLARDO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Although some pressures have been eased,
restrictive laws and the prosecution of opposition journalists still
hinder press freedom in Chile, news executives say.
   ``There is an impending threat that makes many journalists resort
to self-censorship,'' said Emilio Filippi, executive editor of the
opposition newspaper La Epoca. ``The situation is serious,
especially because many journalists are being tried by the
military.''
   Eighteen Chilean journalists currently are being tried by
military courts in 28 different cases, all of them on charges of
``offending'' or ``defaming'' the armed forces.
   A journalist can be arrested if a military official deems an
article or broadcast to be offensive to him or his service, even
though the report is true.
   A navy prosecutor has requested jail sentences of four and three
years, respectively, for Fernando Paulsen, chief editor of the
opposition weekly Cauce, and Ivan Badilla, a reporter for the
magazine. It was believed to be the stiffest sanctions ever sought
in a press trial. Paulsen and Badilla are accused of offending the
navy in a story suggesting that it agreed to an inflated price in
the purchase of French-made helicopters.
   Nine other journalists face charges before civilian courts.
   A 1988 report by lawyers of the Vicary of Solidarity, the Roman
Catholic Church's human rights agency in Chile, said 34 different
laws affect freedom of the press.
   The report also criticized what the vicary perceived as an
increased reliance on military courts to deal with the press.
   ``The government in recent years has chosen the military courts
as an extraordinarily useful deterrant against the media and free
public information,'' it said.
   The military codes were changed twice in recent years to stiffen
penalities for ``opinion or press crimes,'' according to Jose
Galiano, a lawyer who works as an adviser for the Chilean
Journalists Association.
   One change, he noted in an interview, increased from five years
to 10 the maximum penalty for any journalist found guilty of
``offending'' the armed forces or any of their units or members.
   Making the situation more serious, Galiano said, the law now does
not require that an article had to be false for it to be a crime. If
it ``offends'' a member of the military, the journalist who authored
it, can be tried and sentenced.
   ``In other words,'' the lawyer said, ``if you write that the
secret police tortured a prisoner, you can be jailed, even if you
prove that your report was correct, because accusing someone of
being a torturer is certainly an offense.''
   The result, Galiano said, is that ``it has become virtually
impossible to talk in critical terms of the armed forces.''
   Many journalists do take note, however, that the military
government has allowed a marked opening to the Chilean press in
recent months, especially since the Oct. 5 referendum in which
voters rejected a military proposal that the president and army
commander, Gen. Augusto Pinochet, remain in office until 1997.
   ``After the referendum, the government allowed a real opening,
including in television,'' La Epoca's Felippi said. ``But the
restrictive laws are still there, posing a clear danger.''
   Filippi noted that the government announced it is studying a new
press law to streamline and unify the legislation existing now.
   ``And that is also very dangerous, because every time new press
legislation was passed under this government, it was to stiffen
penalties and impose new restrictions,'' he said.
   On New Year's Eve, the government said it was ordering an end to
the prosecution of journalists, as ``a contribution to the necessary
reconciliation in the country.''
   It later explained, however, that the action was limited to
prosecution initiated by the Interior Ministry, which deals in
civilian cases. Only four journalists, all tried by civilian courts,
were favored by the decision. All other trials, including those
before military courts, are to continue.
   ``The government claims it cannot interfere with those trials,
but that's false,'' said Jaime Moreno, president of the Journalists
Association. ``We all know that Gen. Pinochet is not only the
president of the republic, but also the commander of the armed
forces and of the army.''
   ``As such, he has the decisive word on anything related to the
military courts,'' Moreno said.
   ``What we see here is the lack of a real political will by the
government to stop prosecution of journalists.''

<HEAD>Former Greek Radical Becomes EEC Commissioner</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DINA KYRIAKIDOU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Greece's new commissioner in the European
Economic Community is Vasso Papandreou, a former Socialist radical
who once wanted Greece out of the organization.
   She and Christiane Shrivener, 63, of France are the first women
to serve on the 17-member EEC Commission, which is made up of senior
executives and now is charged with preparing for the removal of all
remaining trade barriers within the 12-nation community by the end
of 1992.
   The 44-year-old Ms. Papandreou, a close friend of but not related
to Greece's Socialist premier, Andreas Papandreou, was appointed by
Jacques Delors, the Commission's president. As with all other
commissioners she is expected to act independently of her country in
shaping EEC policy. She has been assigned the community's taxation
and customs union portfolio.
   ``The Commission recognizes that social affairs have been left
behind,'' she said in an interview. ``There is a lot of work to be
done and success depends both on Commission policy and my activity.''
   A farmers's daughter from southern Greece, Ms. Papandreou studied
economics at Athens Higher School of Commercial and Economic Studies
and then earned a Ph.D. at Reading University in England.
   She belonged to a generation of young leftists who bitterly
opposed the 1967-74 military dictatorship in Greece and who were
inspired by Andreas Papandreou's radical socialist policies,
including pledges to take Greece out of the EEC and the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   But after leading his Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) to
power in 1981, Papandreou decided it would be too costly to take
Greece out of the EEC.
   As one of the trade bloc's poorer members, Greece receives more
than $1.5 billion a year in benefits. Premier Papandreou and the
government are now enthusiastically pro-European.
   Asked how she reconciles her radical and Marxist past with her
new job, the tall, dark-haired Ms. Papandreou said: ``It's not me
that's changed but PASOK.''
   As deputy industry minister while Greece held the EEC presidency
during the second half of 1988, Ms. Papandreou chaired meetings on
streamlining industrial legislation in the community.
   In the male-dominated world of Greek politics, Ms. Papandreou and
Culture Minister Melina Mercouri, the former actress who starred in
``Never on Sunday,'' have proved the only female high-fliers in the
Socialist government.
   In her first government post as director of the Organization for
Small and Medium-Size Businesses for two years from 1981, Ms.
Papandreou often was assailed by conservative businessmen, who
accused her of trying to impose Marxist policies.
   But her two-year stint as deputy commerce minister after winning
a Parliament seat in 1985 impressed even those critics.
   Ms. Papandreou's portfolio on the EEC Commission will be a
sensitive one.
   Socialist EEC member-governments, currently in the majority, will
be seeking to expand labor laws and increase social security
payments.
   But the conservative governments are likely to oppose more social
welfare legislation that might further complicate the 1992 goal of
moving services, goods and money freely around the community.
   Ms. Papandreou says that during her years in government she has
learned the art of compromise, crucial in building community policy.
   ``One always has to compromise,'' she said. ``But I'm taking a
positive view and this will be a challenge and a great experience.''
   ``She is very intelligent, a very good diplomat and knows how to
maneuver,'' said Christos Papoutsis, a Socialist member of the
European Parliament who has known Ms. Papandreou for 15 years.

<HEAD>At the Movies: ``Talk Radio''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The abusive broadcast host is a recent media phenomenon, hence
``Talk Radio'' is a timely film. It is also a disturbing one, not
fully realized, but mesmerizing in its portrayal of a man obsessed
by his power to command and destroy.
   ``Talk Radio'' is the latest film from Oliver Stone, who is
establishing himself as the socially-conscious filmmaker of the
1980s. He directed the film and co-wrote it with Eric Bogosian, who
created the role on the stage in his own play. Such conceptual
closeness is ideal for this kind of intensely personal film.
   Barry Champlain emerges in all his ferocity, playing the hold
buttons on his console like the Phantom of the Opera at the organ.
Unlike the play, the movie affords flashbacks to disclose how he got
there. In the '60s he was a clothing salesman to the elite of
Dallas, his only rebellion indicated by shoulder-length hair.
   As guest on a talk-show, Barry sabotages the host by responding
to callers with his outrageous opinions. Soon it's ``The Barry
Champlain Show,'' and his nightly communion with his
listener-victims dominates his life, destroying a seemingly happy
marriage to Ellen Green.
   Most of ``Talk Radio'' takes place, appropriately, within the
broadcast studio. Barry's aides are his concerned assistant (Leslie
Hope) and the patient engineer (John C. McGinley). He is harried by
the devious studio manager (Alec Baldwin) and the radio syndicator
(John Pankow) who wants to take Barry national.
   Stone inexorably constructs the tension between Barry and his
callers, drawing fine performances from unseen actors on the
telephone line. Perhaps he was aiming for the claustrophobia of the
radio studio, but constant viewing of the same set does become
wearing. Even camera stunts such as the 360-degree turn at
Bogosian's climactic oration don't help.
   Bogosian's capacity to sustain a portrayal on one shrill note is
impressive indeed. Ellen Greene and Leslie Hope offer welcome
periods of calm, and all of the actors perform admirably, a hallmark
of Oliver Stone's films. A marvelous bit is provided by Michael
Wincott as a bombed-out caller who pays a call to the station.
   ``Talk Radio'' was produced by Edward R. Pressman for Cineplex
Odeon Films and released by Universal Pictures. The R rating is
largely for language and adult subject matter. Running time: 110
minutes.

   Videos reviewed this week: ``The Unbearable Lightness of Being,''
``The Pointsman,'' ``The Great Outdoors''
   
   
   ``The Unbearable Lightness of Being'' (Orion Home Video.
VHS-Beta, $89.98. Rated R)
   
   ``The Unbearable Lightness of Being'' is yet another triumph for
Philip Kaufman, a filmmaker of great depth and vision who is able to
grasp a complex work and distill it for mass consumption without
losing its spirit or essence. He made Tom Wolfe's vast celebration
of American flyboys, ``The Right Stuff,'' into one of the industry's
most original and interesting films.
   He faced an even greater challenge with Milan Kundera's 1984
philosophical, sensual and political novel about deeply troubled
times in Czechoslovakia during the Soviet invasion of 1968.
   The movie captures the spirit of what filmmaking is all about:
great storytelling, compelling characters, original and beautiful
visuals. It is epic yet intimate, poignant yet funny, tragic yet
inspiring.
   Tomas (Daniel Day-Lewis), a noted neurosurgeon in Prague, is a
hopeless womanizer who simply says, ``Take off your clothes,'' and
women oblige with the speed of a zipper. Into his life comes Tereza
(Juliette Binoche), a shy but sensual country girl, and they marry.
But he continues to see his mistress, Sabina (Lena Olin), an artist
who fears commitment of any kind.
   Soviet tanks roll into Prague just as tensions threaten the
marriage. Tomas and Tereza join protests and finally flee to
Switzerland rather than succumb to Soviet rule. Sabina also shows up
in Switzerland, where the triangle continues. However, life there is
a lie, and Tereza goes home. Tomas follows, knowing he will be
punished by the authorities for his defection. But he prefers the
``heaviness'' of commitment to the ``lightness'' of freedom.
   They are not happy in the city and finally flee to the
uncomplicated, rustic life of the farm.
   It is good that Kaufman takes his time telling the story, which
runs almost three hours. There are too many human motivations to
probe, too many underpinings.
   It is also good that he chose to cast Day-Lewis (``My Beautiful
Laundrette,'' ``A Room With a View'') in the lead. There are
marvelous performances by Brioche and Olin who perfectly balance one
another and offer sensuality in different ways. A scene in which
they photograph one another in the nude is exceptionally directed
and paced, and celebrates the beauty of women.
   The movie has been named best picture of 1988 by the National
Society of Film Critics and has been nominated for two Golden Globe
awards including best picture. It is perhaps the best American film
in a decade and a welcomed diversion for the home screen.

   ``The Pointsman'' (Vestron Video. VHS-Beta, $79.98. Rated R)
   
   In Europe, railway switches are called ``points'' and those who
switch them ``pointsmen,'' a fact not unknown to seekers of metaphor
who sometimes wonder in night thoughts what might have happened if
at some time past they had taken another direction in their lives....
   A beautiful, elegantly dressed woman sits on a train that moves
through a forlorn landscape. She tears pages from a handwritten
journal. Waking suddenly she mistakenly gets off the train at a
switching station in the middle of nowhere and confronts the
switchman.
   The woman and the pointsman do not speak each other's language.
They do not like each other. She huddles outside with her luggage.
The train does not come. She huddles inside the dank station. Still,
the train does not come. She stays.
   Seasons change and still she remains. She and he work out a modus
vivendi as domestic as a marriage.
   This movie is tough sledding, not your typical, thrill-crazed
rental. It's a demanding, eerie, densely metaphoric parable about
men and women and it's beautifully photographed and intensely
well-acted.
   It's too cold, too abstract a movie to love, but it can be
experienced and felt, and on a strictly emotional level it succeeds
brilliantly. As Huckleberry Finn said of another parable, ``The
statements was interesting but tough.''

   ``The Great Outdoors'' (MCA Home Video. VHS-Beta, $89.95. Rated
PG)
   
   Once again John Candy, an immense man of immense talents, finds
himself stranded in mediocrity. This time around it's ``The Great
Outdoors.'' Co-starring as his brother-in-law is another comedic
great, Dan Aykroyd. Both are wasted in this Howard Deutch study in
boredom, which was produced and written by John Hughes who seems to
delight in superficial film stories.
   Candy and his family head to Perks Pine Lodge in Wisconsin for a
little rustic holiday. Who shows up, uninvited but Aykroyd and
family. John Hughes, who wrote and produced this insipid farce,
thought that setup would be grist for great comedy. Wake up and
smell the pine trees, John.
   There are plenty of sight gags and hostile exchanges between the
two men. There's a running bit with an enraged bear, the obligatory
waterski fiasco (you've seen it dozens of times) and a strange
fishing trip.
   Their wives and children utter the predictable Hollywood babble
wives and children (in Hollywood, anyway) mutter when stuck in the
woods with two people who just don't get along. And guess what saves
the relationships? A little would-be accident, of course. And guess
who it involves? Why Aykroyd's little girls, of course.
   And they all lived happily? everafter.

   ``Workers Playtime'' (Elektra) _ Billy Bragg
   
   Electric folkster Billy Bragg poses the question himself in this
record's signature tune, ``Waiting for the Great Leap Forwards'' _
``Mixing pop and politics he asks me what the use is, so I offer him
embarrassment and my usual excuses.''
   Excuses, hardly. What Billy Bragg has made is a record of
stinging social criticism, but with overtones of hope for humanity,
and even of love.
   ``Workers Playtime,'' with its hammer-and-sickle logo and
collective farm cover, looks like it should contain nothing but
tributes to Lenin and Marx. Bragg does sing of revolutions and
social injustice in his Cockney twang, but it's when he touches the
common emotions shared by all that he really hits home.
   On most tunes, Bragg strums an electric guitar backed by pianist
Cara Tivey, sometimes with a full band and sometimes not. He's
capable of spritely pop, such as ``She's Got a New Spell'' and ``The
Price I Pay,'' the latter a lament about a lost love in which Bragg
says he would ``walk a mile with a stone in my shoe'' to regain it.
   Relationships, and the trouble with keeping them intact, are the
subject of seven of the 11 songs. The best, ``Must I Paint You a
Picture,'' is a tender bass, piano and guitar piece in which Bragg
sings: ``The temptation - To take the precious things we have apart
- To see how they work - Must be resisted for they never fit
together again.''
   Bragg goes solo _ literally _ on the a cappella song ``Tender
Comrade,'' about a pair of army buddies trying to decide whether or
not they were really brave under fire. The strong lyrical content
makes instruments unnecessary.
   A pair of country tunes tackle completely different subjects. The
honky-tonk ``Life With the Lions'' deals with a man who hates what
his life has made him become, while ``Rotting on Remand'' is a
steel-guitar flavored tale of injustice that ends: ``You don't turn
criminals into citizens - By treating them this way.''
   The album ends with the rocking ``Waiting for the Great Leap
Forwards,'' featuring backing vocals by Michelle Shocked and Martin
Belmont on guitar, in which Bragg wonders whether things ever will
change in the world: ``In a perfect world we'd all sing in tune -But
this is reality so give me some room.''
   Billy Bragg's music is a delicate mixture of folk, rock and
country with some of the strongest lyrics this side of early Bob
Dylan. The album's leftist look shouldn't deter listeners from
finding the heart of gold inside.

   ``Reputation'' (Polydor) _ Brian Spence
   
   Drop the needle on ``Reputation,'' the first song on newcomer
Brian Spence's album, and you'll hear some burbling bass,
call-and-response vocals and a pleasant Daryl Hall imitation. Keep
the record going for the second song and you'll hear the same thing.
Virtually identical _ so much so you'll check your stereo for a
malfunction.
   Not a good sign for a new artist trying to establish his identity
in a competitive music scene. Spence's record is designed to fit
neatly on increasingly restrictive AOR (album oriented rock)
playlists.
   As such, it's paint-by-numbers rock devoid of personality. Except
for the clue of guitars tuned to sound vaguely like bagpipes, the
Edinburgh-born Spence could just as easily have been from Illinois
or California or Canada.
   There are a couple of breathy ballads to prove to women that
Spence is a sensitive guy. There's the roughhousing ``You Got the
Whip'' to prove to men he isn't. ``Reputation'' and ``Come Back
Home,'' the first two songs, are extremely radio friendly.
   This is all done with reasonable skill, although Spence is
annoyingly ungrammatical (learn the difference between your and
you're, Brian). It's the kind of record likely to be forgotten two
minutes after it's heard.

   Symphony No. 7, ``Leningrad,'' by Dmitri Shostakovich; Leningrad
Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by Mariss Jansons (EMI)
   
   In the era of glasnost, EMI brings us a quintessentially Russian
performance of Shostakovich's Seventh Symphony, the ``Leningrad'' _
a work seized on by Soviet propagandists as a patriotic symbol. Its
first three movements were written in the summer of 1941 when Hitler
was marching on the composer's native Leningrad.
   But as the composer told Solomon Volkov in the book
``Testimony,'' ``It's not about Leningrad under siege, it's about
the Leningrad that Stalin destroyed and that Hitler merely finished
off.''
   There can't be much argument about this performance's
authenticity. Mariss Jansons, who studied with Yevgeni Mavrinsky,
the first conductor of many Shostakovich pieces, leads the
Leningraders in a wiry, lean performance. He paces nicely the first
movement march theme as it builds slowly from the fragile lyrical to
the clownish to the terrifying, supposedly symbolizing Hitler's
march on the city.
   The generally agile strings produce a slightly grainy sound when
called for, and the winds can produce a fine edge. Jansons is not
afraid to get ugly when that's appropriate.
   A caveat: the oboe has a somewhat cloying, over-vibratoed sound.
Balances in the winds are good. Overall, the orchestra sounds set
back on a stage, wih the listener somewhere in the middle of a large
hall.
   Speaking of halls, the only non-authentic aspect to this compact
disk is where it was recorded: the Konserthus in Oslo.

<HEAD>Star Watch: Dustin Hoffman Inspired Eric Bogosian</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto LA2</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eric Bogosian always knew he wanted to be an
actor, but he was never convinced that he could become a star until
he saw Dustin Hoffman in ``Midnight Cowboy.''
   ``I must have been around 16 or so,'' Bogosian recalled. ``I
wasn't pursuing acting full-force by then, but I knew I loved it. I
loved it! The only problem was: There weren't a lot of lead actors
who looked like me in the late '60s.
   ``So here's this guy, Dustin Hoffman, blowing the wheels off the
screen. It was such a courageous act. He had just done `The
Graduate,' and he didn't care how he looked, he was just going to
throw himself totally into this role. That really set the bead for
me as to what I wanted to do.''
   It took a while, but Bogosian at 35 has achieved his goal: a
star-making role in a movie, ``Talk Radio.'' He delivers the kind of
performance that cries out for an Academy nomination.
   A slender, nervous man with blunt features and Persian-lamb hair,
he should have been familiar with the role of talk-show host Barry
Champlain: He wrote it, played it in the theater and co-wrote the
movie script with director Oliver Stone.
   ``Talk Radio'' has had a fascinating history.
   ``I do a one-man show in which I play about 14 characters in an
hour and a half,'' Bogosian recounted. ``An artist named Tad Savinar
saw my show in Portland, Ore., and liked it. He asked if I ever
listened to talk radio. I said I didn't.
   ``He said, `I'm addicted to it. Why don't you make your
characters call you up, and you can be the radio host? So I made up
this radio host who was pretty obnoxious and fought with people and
hung up on them.
   ``I had to make a character that people would watch for an hour
and a half. I found that no matter how repellent I made the guy, the
audience in the theater liked him anyway. I felt I had hit pay dirt.
You find a bad guy that people love, and it's a great role.''
   Bogosian wrote a full-length drama that opened to enthusiastic
reviews at Joseph Papp's Public Theater in New York in May 1987.
Producer Edward Pressman (``True Stories,'' ``Wall Street'') signed
up the film rights to ``Talk Radio'' and assigned Bogosian to write
a script.
   Pressman also acquired the rights to Stephen Singular's biography
``Talked to Death: The Life and Murder of Alan Berg,'' about the
Denver radio host who was slain by neo-Nazi fanatics. The book
supplied left-wing politics, a subplot about an ex-wife as well as
other personal matters. But many of the call-ins remain the same as
in the play.
   ``Talk Radio'' now sought a director. One applicant said he
wanted merely to film the play. Bogosian said no, he wanted it to be
a movie. Another director told Pressman: ``I'd love to do it; how do
we get rid of Bogosian?'' No way, said the author; he alone would
play Barry Champlain.
   Oliver Stone, who had been overseeing the script-writing for
Pressman, finally agreed to direct _ ``as a little project while he
was waiting to do a big one,'' Bogosian suggested. The film was shot
for $4.5 million in Dallas on a tight schedule.
   ``Oliver loves that kind of stuff,'' Bogosian said. ``He moves,
and he has a great crew, the same guys who shot `Platoon' and `Wall
Street.' They work very, very fast, and they love to come up with
all kinds of camera tricks and new techniques. The harder it is, the
more they like it.''
   It was in his home town of Woburn, Mass., where Bogosian was
first inspired by viewing ``The Graduate.'' The son of
first-generation Armenian-Americans, he was already appearing in the
Woburn Drama Guild, and he pursued acting at the University of
Chicago and Oberlin College which awarded him a degree in drama in
1976. In New York, he and his Australia-born wife lived in a tiny
apartment while he tried to find an audience with his monologues.
   ``I quit acting a number of times, but I would sort of float back
and start doing it again,'' he said.
   Bogosian and Champlain have been passionately connected for the
past few years, and the actor admits a certain fascination with his
fictional counterpart: ``He's like on a road to destruction. His
appetite for the audience keeps growing, and he's destroying his
personal life. That can only lead to suicide or breakdown or
something that won't work after a while.
   ``I love playing Barry, because he's funny, he's exciting, he's
energetic, he fits me like a glove. He's got this voice, and I got a
voice. I thought it was a great part. There aren't great parts
available for me, at least not at the time I started doing Barry.''

   One breath on the viewfinder of his camera as
he photographed a pack of six Arctic wolves taught Jim Brandenburg
the difficulties of shooting in frigid temperatures when excited.
   The warm, moist air coated the viewfinder glass with a layer of
ice.
   ``This must be scraped off with your fingernail, which means
removing your two sets of gloves, which means freezing your
fingers,'' Brandenburg recounts in his book, ``White Wolf: Living
With an Arctic Legend.''
   The 160-page book, which evolved from a May 1987 ``National
Geographic'' cover story, recounts in words and photographs the
summer of 1986 when Brandenburg and biologist L. David Mech lived
among a pack of wild white wolves on Ellesmere Island, 500 miles
from the North Pole.
   Brandenburg first spotted the arctic wolf pack while
photographing the historic dogsled journey to the North Pole led by
Will Steger. He persuaded National Geographic to let him do a story
on Ellesmere Island and asked Mech, who has devoted the past 30
years to the scientific study of wolves, to accompany him.
   Mech also wrote a book about the experience, ``The Arctic Wolf:
Living With the Pack,'' after deciding against collaborating with
Brandenburg on a single book.
   Photographs included in Brandenburg's book have won many
prestigious awards, including Magazine Picture Story of the Year,
and first and second place in the nature category from the National
Press Photographers Association; first place in the nature category
from the World Press Photography contest; and the No. 1 cover for
1987 in a National Geographic Survey.
   He also was named 1988 Wildlife Photographer of the Year by BBC
Wildlife Magazine and Kodak for his white wolf photographs.
   Brandenburg, 43, a Minnesota native who began working as a
contract photographer for National Geographic Society after working
as a photographer for the Worthington Daily Globe, had been
photographing wolves in their natural habitat for 20 years before
going to Ellesmere Island. He had photographed wolves in Canada,
Alaska, northern Minnesota, China and the Soviet Union.
   But it's the Ellesmere Island experience that stands out. ``This
story was the most important story I've ever done. This is the
highlight of my career,'' Brandenburg said.
   Although there were hardships _ temperatures ranged from 70
degrees below zero to 70 degrees above zero and Brandenburg
destroyed the cartilege in his knees kneeling on the ice _ those
aren't the things that stand out in his memory.
   ``I don't remember one difficult day. I just remember a positive
dream. It was wonderful all the way through,'' Brandenburg said.
``Their tolerance of me up there is probably the most profound
feeling I have.''
   When Brandenburg returned to the island last spring to do some
followup work for the book, he crawled into the wolf den to
photograph pups, a first in nature photography.
   ``I had spent so much time that they weren't concerned with my
proximity to the pups,'' he said. ``I was more concerned about my
intruding into what was an intimate bedroom. I wouldn't have done it
if I thought there would be a problem.''
   The mother of the pups came back into the den a few minutes after
Brandenburg left, he said, and the animals resumed their routines.
   ``Sometimes I forget I'm actually working for a living with this.
I don't think of it as a business. It's sort of a passion. I can't
stop doing it.''
   The book, with a first printing of 50,000 copies and a second
printing planned, is the culmination of that passion.
   ``There is something about a book that is really precious,'' he
said. ``It's a cultural thing. It's almost like giving birth to a
child.''
   Craftsmanship isn't the only reason Brandenburg takes pride in
the book.
   ``I think the book is making a difference in people's attitudes
toward nature and especially toward wolves,'' he said. ``Even if it
makes 10 people change their ideas about wolves, it's worth it to
me. Those rewards are greater than the financial ones.''
   Brandenburg, who studied art in college and has never taken a
photography course, said he considers it important that his
photographs are both accurate and artistic.
   He tries to present work that will attract people who normally
aren't interested in science or the environment: ``I feel with the
environmental problems we have, we are going to have to get into
people's hearts rather than their heads.''
   A small, gentle man with haunting pale blue eyes, Brandenburg
speaks of nature with quiet reverence.
   ``My God is what I see and what I breathe and what I feel,'' he
said. ``I know we have something here _ a certain kind of heaven _
that we are despoiling. And that's a sin. I think we should live in
harmony with the environment.''
   In keeping with that philosophy, he is donating some of the
profits from his book to wolf education and environmental education.
Some of the proceeds are going to the Wolf Ridge Environmental
Learning Center on Lake Superior's North Shore and the environmental
group Defenders of Wildlife.
   He is also organizing a benefit concert for wolves which will
feature musicians Paul Winter and James Taylor.
   ``That is the most satisfying thing of all _ trying to change
people's attitudes toward creatures I love and respect,''
Brandenburg said.

<HEAD>Music Makers: Loverboy Guitarist Goes It Alone</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HILLEL ITALIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the early 1980s, Loverboy dominated radio with
such hits as ``Turn Me Loose'' and ``Working for the Weekend.''
   Although their mainstream power-pop music wasn't popular with
critics _ ``corporate rock'' it was called _ millions of fans played
Loverboy's records. Loud.
   According to guitarist Paul Dean, however, the group then went
``soft'' in 1984 when lead singer Mike Reno made a duet with Heart's
Ann Wilson on the ballad ``Almost Paradise,'' a smash hit from the
soundtrack of ``Footloose.''
   Loverboy had been regarded as just another faceless band, but
suddenly Reno's trademark headband made him famous around the world.
The rest of the group, meanwhile, remained largely unknown.
Dissension set in. Now, Dean says, ``we're not communicating that
great.''
   ```Almost Paradise' made Mike a ton of dough for five hours
work,'' Dean said. ``We went from being a high energy rock band to
being a ballad band. People just got ideas. Our record company would
come up to us and say, `Look what `Journey' did with ballads.'''
   On ``Hard Core,'' Dean's first solo album, the guitarist
dispenses with Loverboy's keyboard sound and delivers nine songs
that are sure to test the most expensive speaker systems.
   ``I was being buried by a keyboard player and production team,''
Dean said of his later work with Loverboy.
   Dean put together his own band for ``Hard Core.'' From Loverboy
came drummer Matt Burnette, a longtime friend; Geraldo Domenelli
helps out on guitars and Dave Watson, who played bass for country
star Lee Greenwood, rounds out the group.
   ``I started rehearsing a trio while mixing the last Loverboy
album,'' Dean said. ``I was not involved in the production of that
album. I was in a $35 an hour studio, rehearsing and making demos.''
   Also chipping in are some hard core rock 'n' rollers: fellow
Canadian Bryan Adams, KISS member Paul Stanley, and Jon Bon Jovi,
who plays harp on the Adams composition, ``Draw the Line.''
   Stanley wrote the album's first single, ``Sword to Stone,'' a
song Dean originally meant to record with Loverboy.
   ``I played it for the guys in the band and they laughed and said,
`Get serious.' There are a lot of things that Mike can't stand. He
wants to sing good time stuff. I guess he felt it was too heavy
metal.''
   Dean's own roots are a combination of country and rock. He was
born in 1946 in British Columbia and recalled listening to a country
music station from Spokane, Wash., on radio at night.
   Johnny Cash was an early hero, but so were the Ventures, an
instrumental group in the early '60s best known for ``Walk, Don't
Run.''
   ``I wore out that record,'' he said. ``I had quarters on the tone
arm, trying to get it to play one more time. I had the first 10
Venture albums and learned all the parts. I drove my parents mad,
but that's the idea, isn't it?
   He didn't fare much better with employers. After attending the
University of British Columbia, he tried holding a job during the
day and playing in bands at night. It didn't last very long.
   ``I worked with the Coca-Cola company as a deliverer for a week.
I was sleeping on the job because I was playing bars until 3,'' Dean
recalled. ``I also had jobs in warehouses. ... I was good for maybe
a month or two, but I just couldn't handle it.''
   Even playing full time, Dean's career made little progress until
1978 when he met Reno in Calgary and the two decided to put a band
together. ``I was tired of working with front men and putting all my
energy behind then and getting screwed in the end,'' he said.
   Dean came up with the name for the group in 1979: ``I was looking
through some magazines sitting on the table, `Glamour' and `Cosmo,'
just sitting on the table. There were cover girls everywhere and I
thought `Coverboy,' then `Loverboy.'''
   Their self-titled debut album came out in the fall of 1980 and
went platinum in the United States and Canada. With the release of
``Get Lucky'' in 1981, and the smash hit, ``Working for the
Weekend,'' Loverboy established itself as one of the world's hottest
bands.
   ``It was like a magic plan that worked,'' Dean said. ``I had been
in so many bands and thought this is how it should work. I was
always one thing short. When it all finally happened I was really
impressed.''
   In 1983, Loverboy released ``Keep It Up,'' another platinum
seller which yielded the hit singles ``Hot Girls in Love'' and
``Queen of the Broken Hearts.'' ``Lovin' Every Minute of It,'' which
came out in 1985, had three more hits, but by the time ``Notorious''
was released two years later, the thrill was gone.
   ``I felt I wanted to keep the band together,'' Dean said. ``But
the tunes on `Notorious' were not the best.''
   So the days of filling arenas with screaming fans are over for
now. Dean is back to playing clubs again, hoping to build an
audience for his solo record.
   ``I don't think they're waiting in line with baited breath. I
don't think anyone even knows about the record, to be honest. Not
many people are even aware that the band is taking a break from each
other.''

<HEAD>Books and Authors: Book Injects Grain Of Salt Into Pioneer Tales</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL WHITE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SALT LAKE CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As both a devoted scholar and practicing
Mormon, the late historian Eugene E. Campbell knew well the hazards
of challenging the more cherished versions of his church's history.
   In his recently published book, ``Establishing Zion,'' Campbell
notes the risks and then carefully proceeds to inject a grain of
salt into popular tales of the Mormon pioneers.
   Published by Signature Books two years after Campbell's death in
1986, the book chronicles The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
Saints from the colonization of the Salt Lake Valley in 1847 through
its initial battles with the federal government over polygamy in the
late 1860s.
   The book originally was intended as part of an official,
multi-volume history the church. The project was scrapped in 1981
after leaders became uncomfortable with research by Campbell and
others, but the historians were allowed to seek independent
publication of their writings.
   ``The version that was published was a version he was hoping
would pass by the church censors. If he had known it was going to
Signature, it might have been a different book,'' said Campbell's
daughter, Mary Ann Payne. ``He might have been harder on (Mormon
founder and leader) Brigham Young.''
   Nevertheless, Campbell, an award-winning historian and professor
at the Mormon Church's Brigham Young University, gives some of
Utah's most fabled moments a new perspective.
   For instance, popular lore holds that the first Mormon pioneers
who entered the Salt Lake Valley tamed a harsh, barren desert and
made it bloom. Drawing from the pioneers' own diaries, Campbell
notes that many in the intitial company actually described the
valley as a veritable garden _ green, inviting and well-watered by
snow-fed streams.
   Did seagulls miraculously save the pioneers' first crop by
gobbling hordes of ravenous crickets during the summer of 1848?
   The gulls did eat a lot of crickets, Campbell writes, and some
saw the phenomenon as providential. But decades passed before the
episode was hailed by the church as a miracle.
   Such notable Mormons as Young, Eliza R. Snow and Parley P. Pratt
made no mention of gulls in their accounts of that critical summer.
   Despite Campbell's concern to appease censors, the book paints an
unsparing portait of Brigham Young.
   In a chapters dealing with Mormons' relations with the Indians,
Campbell points out that Young's idealistic hope of converting and
civilizing the Indians ultimately gave way to bloodshed and forced
removal to reservations.
   Campbell recounts how Young, influenced by attacks on settlers,
ordered the extermination of all male Indians in Utah Valley.
Several days later, the militia attacked a band of 70 male and
female Indians camped on the Provo River, slaying the last few as
they fled across frozen Utah Lake.
   ``I think it is by far the most objective books, one of the very
best, we've got covering that period,'' said Fred Gowans, a BYU
history professor who assisted Campbell with his original research
in the early 1970s. ``I'm sure there are people who would disagree,
but I think it's very accurate.''
   Campbell also illustrates Young's pragmatic side. As an
ecclesiastical leader, Young strongly urged Mormons to resist the
temptations of the California gold fields. Yet when the church found
itself in dire financial straits, Young sent ``missionaries'' to pan
to for gold and send the proceeds back to Salt Lake City.
   Payne said that after the church abandoned its history project,
Campbell begain revising his manuscript, toning down critical
commentary, hoping to have the work published by the church-owned
Deseret Book or Bookcraft, a Salt Lake City company specializing in
church-oriented books.
   She said she completed the arrangements with Signature following
Campbell's death, even though the manuscript was rough and the
footnotes incomplete.
   A quotation from Campbell's earlier writings, included in the
publisher's foreword, summarizes the author's own view of writing
Mormon history.
   ``This is the challenge I face: How do I bring a fresh, new
approach to a subject that has been heard many times before by
church members without upsetting their faith or _ better yet _ while
strengthening their faith? Let me suggest one rule. ... I will never
knowingly teach my students something they will have to `unlearn'
later on.''

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: Otis Blackwell, Accidental Songwriter</HEAD>
<BYLINE>With LaserPhoto NS3 ^By JOE EDWARDS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Otis Blackwell stumbled into a
songwriting career and ended up composing hit records that have sold
a remarkable 185 million copies.
   In more than 30 years of writing, he says he's used no guidelines
in turning out such rock 'n' roll hits as ``Handy Man,'' ``Don't Be
Cruel,'' ``Return to Sender'' and ``All Shook Up.''
   ``I wrote, went home and prayed,'' he said about his early years
as a songwriter when he composed several hit records for Elvis
Presley and ``Great Balls of Fire'' and ``Breathless'' for Jerry Lee
Lewis.
   He's written more than 1,000 songs that have been recorded by
performers such as Billy Joel, James Taylor, Ray Charles, the Who,
Otis Redding, Peggy Lee and dozens of others in addition to Presley
and Lewis.
   ``It makes me feel wonderful for other people to do my songs and
have them still be around and have people still wanting to do
them,'' Blackwell says, reflecting on a composing career few can
match.
   His favorite?
   ``I don't know. I have fun with all of them.''
   The 56-year-old Blackwell was a poor kid from Brooklyn, N.Y., who
wanted to be a singer. He worked as a young man as a floor sweeper
at a Brooklyn theater and later as a clothes presser. While
recording tunes for a small New York company, he was asked to write
songs as well.
   ``I was thrown into it,'' he says about songwriting.
   His songs in the years since have sold 185 million copies, with
Presley's ``Don't Be Cruel'' one of his first hits. Cheap Trick
recently had another hit version.
   ``I guess the style was different,'' he says about Presley's
version. ``Elvis came out with it and it was new and he was new.''
   About the Cheap Trick version, he says, ``I loved it. It was done
close to the way it was done the first time. I was surprised it was
so close. The performance they did was superb.''
   Another big seller was ``Handy Man,'' a hit most recently for
Taylor but a song written and recorded years earlier. ``It was out a
few weeks before I heard it,'' Blackwell says. ``I didn't even know
who James Taylor was. It was a little different. I had no idea it
would catch on the way it did.''
   He wrote ``Return to Sender'' hoping it would be included in a
movie Presley would make.
   ``It wasn't the same type of shuffle songs we used to do,''
Blackwell recalled. ``I really didn't think he would accept it. It
was different compared to the type songs we had been pitching at
him.''
   Blackwell often sang the songs himself before they were recorded,
and some music historians believe his style influenced Presley's.
   ``I don't know except that we both sound alike,'' Blackwell says.
``I used to do quite a few demos (demonstration versions) of songs I
didn't write ... songs that were his style. It was easy writing for
him. When I would do these things, I would figure this is me singing
and this is the way he would sing them. So it came real easy.''
   He never met Presley and feels his relationship with him was best
kept at a distance: ``We hadecord company and may put a band
together and perform the songs he's written.
   ``I enjoy singing the songs I've written because the people I
perform for know the songs and like to sing along with me,'' he says.
   He offers few suggestions for writing songs.
   ``What I find out is you've just got to get up and whatever
comes, I just throw the book away, whatever that is. I don't have
any guidelines. I try to write simple lyrics. I try to write clear
lyrics. My lyrics must be simple and can be sung by kids 5-years-old
on up. I just try to figure out something not done before.
   ``I made a lot of money and still do,'' he said. ``I've spent a
lot foolishly. I had my problems with the big house and big car and
the good times and the government and I guess I had an alcohol
problem at one time.
   ``The wealth I have is knowing that my songs are still being done
and I've helped a lot of writers whenever possible.''

<HEAD>Plight of Socially Rejected Children Still Poorly Understood</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shunned in the classroom and the playground, they
are the kids who are disliked by just about everybody.
   Some fly off the handle for no apparent reason. Some just don't
seem to know how to act with their peers.
   ``Socially rejected'' children comprise maybe one-tenth of the
nation's grade-school classes. They run a risk of truancy, repeating
grades, becoming depressed and anxious, and dropping out. In later
life, they show heightened rates of juvenile delinquency and mental
health problems.
   Recent research into why some children are rejected shows they
are a mixed group. Many children apparently haven't learned normal
social skills. Others have learned the wrong lessons too well.
   Researchers are far from solving the problem, but they say they
have found ways to help some children, at least temporarily.
   ``We're not turning rejected kids into well-liked, well-adjusted
kids yet (but) we're moving in the right direction,'' said
psychologist Karen Bierman of Pennsylvania State University.
   Rejected children aren't those who simply don't attract much
attention from classmates, or who lose battles for status among
their peers. They're ``those kids who are at the real bottom,'' said
Ken Dodge, psychology professor at Vanderbilt University in
Nashville, Tenn.
   A key mystery is whether the other troubles are caused by the
experience of being rejected or stem from other factors, and the
rejection merely indicates a child's peers can identify those
factors early, said psychologist Martha Putallaz of Duke University.
Bierman suspects both play a role.
   In any case, researchers have proposed three major explanations
for rejection: lack of certain social skills, aggressiveness and the
way children of an ``in-group'' treat non-members. A given rejected
child may be affected by more than one of these problems, Bierman
said.
   Much research focuses on the idea that children are rejected
because they lack certain social skills. They consistently
misinterpret people's intentions, for example, and don't know how to
enter groups of children at play or to solve common social dilemmas
properly.
   Dodge's research has shown that rejected children are less
accurate than others in reading the intentions of people in
videotaped vignettes. They tend to assume hostility where none
exists _ which is important because his work has also shown that
much peer conflict arises through misinterpreted motives.
   If a child bumps another and takes his place in line, most
children at the scene may realize it was an accident. But the bumped
child may misperceive the episode as an aggressive act and retaliate
aggressively, Dodge said.
   Putallaz, focusing on another skill, found that unpopular
grade-school chhildren behaved differently from popular kids when
they tried to join other children in play. Unpopular children were
more likely to be disagreeable, as in disapproving of another's
behavior or possessions, and were also more likely to state their
feelings, talk about themselves, ask questions and abruptly change
the subject of conversation.
   In short, they seemed to be trying to call attention to
themselves rather than blending into the activities of the group,
Putallaz said. The stategy did not go over well; unpopular children
needed more time and more attempts to enter a group than popular
children did.
   Dodge said he believes the work applies to rejected children, too.
   Programs that include teaching and practicing social skills can
help improve some rejected children's behavior for at least several
months, leading in some cases to improved social standing, he said.
But children have not been followed long enough to show whether such
programs can reduce the risk of later behavioral and psychological
problems.
   A second explanation for rejection is gaining acceptance as
researchers focus on aggressive behavior of rejected children,
Bierman said. Perhaps half to a third of rejected children are
unusually aggressive, she said.
   These children may have learned at home that tantrums and other
obnoxious behavior can get them what they want. Then they carried
that lesson to school.
   In this hypothesis, the problem is parents who give a lot of
commands but fail to back them up. Instead, they occasionally give
up in the face of yelling or tantrums. The process escalates as
parents become angry and essentially compete with their screaming
children to see who can be more obnoxious.
   In the end, children learn from the process that anger is the way
to solve a problem, Bierman said.
   Some researchers suspect such children find that if they get
angry and scream in school situations, such as losing an argument,
their peers and even teachers will let them have their way _
reinforcing the idea that aggression is the way to face a problem,
she said.
   Intervening with this kind of child involves working with
parents, teachers and peers so they no longer reward aggressive
behavior. Research suggests such programs can help reduce
aggression, but are difficult to do in school because the children
are so obnoxious others often hesitate to help, Bierman said.
   The behavioral change often does not lead to better social
status, she said. But her research suggests peers may be more likely
to change attitudes if they are involved in the treatment. They have
a stake in the outcome, and they get a chance to find a more
likeable child beneath the veneer of aggression.
   The third overall explanation for rejection deals with how
rejected kids stay that way. Essentially, it says that allegiances
form between subgroups of peers, and part of such ``in-groups'' is
to identify and criticize non-members, effectively keeping them out
of the group.
   Children in this situation are helped by programs that combine
them with in-group members to work for a common goal, so that
in-group children and the rejected child get a chance to view each
other in a new light.
   This strategy has shown some short-term success in changing
behavior, but its long-range impact is not known, Dodge said.
   Regardless of the theory behind intervention programs for
rejected children, Bierman said, the programs appear to do the least
good for the most severely rejected children.
   And other key questions remain unresolved:
   Why do some children lack social skills most kids learn? Do
children rejected in school tend to have the same problem in their
neighborhoods or athletic teams? Could any support they find outside
school be used to reduce their risk of the long-term problems
associated with rejection?
   Despite the uncertainties and lack of effective treatment in some
cases, Bierman said research does offer hope to some rejected
children.
   ``We know enough to start working with a child and family,'' she
said. ``We know things to try, and for some kids we will have very
good success.''

<HEAD>Debate Over Methods Increases With Popularity Of Laser Surgery</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BERNARD SCHOENBURG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dr. Vijay Maker operates in a hospital, his laser
a ``magic knife'' that seals off blood vessels, kills bacteria and
reduces pain.
   Dr. Philip Morris, who works in an outpatient surgery center,
uses a laser to remove cancer from breasts, and sends patients home
hours later with ``so little pain that they only take one or two
little pain pills.''
   The two are among a growing number of doctors who strongly
advocate using lasers _ focused beams of light of a single color, or
wavelength _ for surgery. They also illustrate a growing debate over
what type of laser is best.
   Maker, chief of surgery at Grant Hospital in Chicago, uses a
laser called a YAG, short for yttrium aluminum garnet. Its beam
prevents tissue from bleeding by heat-sealing cells as they are cut.
   The beam can travel through a flexible cord, and in Maker's model
of choice, a pen-like instrument directs the beam through
crystalline tips that touch the surgical surface. That means, he
says, that surgeons who learned to respond to feedback from scalpel
touching tissue make an easy transition.
   Morris, at The Surgery Center in Santa Rosa, Calif., uses a
carbon dioxide laser, which heats a thin layer of tissue until cells
actually explode, or disintegrate. It also seals off small blood
vessels.
   Maker says a carbon dioxide laser, where the beam travels only in
straight lines and must be turned by mirrors, and where the beam
touches skin but the instrument tip has no contact with the tissue,
is far less accurate.
   ``You're shooting pretty much like target practice,'' he said.
``It's a very crude way of doing a very fine surgery like
mastectomy.''
   Morris disagrees, though he admits that a YAG is ``much more
precise.''
   He said a YAG beam, which reacts with red substances like blood,
is better for coagulation, but the beam can penetrate ``deeper than
what you can see ... so the next day a guy might blow a hole out of
his stomach or colon.''
   The wavelength of a CO2 laser makes it heat water, and cells are
90 percent water, he said. But even as one cell is disintegrated by
the beam, ``you don't hurt the tissue right next door.''
   Dr. Leonard Cerullo, an associate professor of surgery at
Northwestern University School of Medicine and director of the
Chicago Neurosurgical Center at Columbus Hospital, said, ``You
really have to match the instrument to the surgical need. I think
it's a mistake to say one size fits all.''
   Despite difference over types of lasers, Maker and Morris agree
that laser surgery in many ways tops traditional methods of
operating.
   Dr. Ellet Drake, secretary of the American Society for Laser
Medicine and Surgery in Wausau, Wis., estimates that more than a
million surgical procedures were done in the past year with lasers,
but he doesn't envision the scalpel being replaced in the forseeable
future.
   Lasers should be used, said Drake, a cardiologist, when ``they
either do something better or do it exclusively. Why use a $100,000
apparatus when you can get by with a $10 apparatus.''
   Albert Einstein first conceived the laser more than 50 years ago,
but it was 1960 before a usable one was built, Drake said.
   Ophthhalmologists were the first doctors to use them widely, and
about 90 percent in that field use lasers to treat ailments
including detached retinas, glaucoma, retinitis and some cataracts,
he said. Most opthamologists use argon lasers, which are lower in
energy than YAG or CO2 models, and the beams can pass through clear
eye tissue to heat the blood-rich retina.
   He said that lasers also are becoming more popular with
obstetricians and gynecologists, with applications from dissolving
venereal warts to breaking up blockages in fallopian tubes. In
dermatology, lasers have proven to be the best tools to lighten
port-wine stain birthmarks. In cardiology, lasers on the ends of
flexible tubes can clear blockages from arteries. And urologists can
use them to break up kidney stones or cut out cancer from bladders.
   Dr. Francis L`Esperance, an opthamologist at
Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in New York City, says a new
laser could be used to reshape the retina and eliminate the need for
corrective eyeglasses or contact lenses.

<HEAD>Man Fights to Save Seeds from Extinction</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GREG SMITH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DECORAH, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If it weren't for his wife's grandfather,
Kent Whealy might be just another journalist.
   Just before he died, Baptist Ott gave Whealy the seeds of a
morning glory, a large pink German tomato and a little pole bean. He
instructed Whealy to preserve the seeds, which had come from Bavaria
in the 1930s.
   That was 16 years ago, when Whealy was fresh out of the
University of Kansas. He now is editor and founder of Seed Savers
Exchange, a small group in Iowa working to save countless varieties
of seeds from extinction.
   ``Animals just have more cuddle appeal. It's a lot easier to get
the concern about an animal than it is to get concerned about a
plant,'' Whealy said, adding that the ``genetic erosion'' of seeds
has been dramatic.
   The U.S. Department of Agriculture conducted a survey of the U.S.
and Canadian garden seed inventory in 1903. A comparison between
that list and the inventory of the government's largest seed
collection, in Fort Collins, Colo., found that ``only 3 percent of
the varieties available in 1903 are still in government
collections,'' he said.
   ``That's the type of loss that has occurred in the last 80
years.''
   Genetic erosion of plant seeds ``is so abstract that most people
fail to recognize it as a threat,'' but rapidly changing weather
patterns, increased use of pesticides and chemicals, and hardier
insects will ultimately take a toll on the nation's food crops,
Whealy said.
   ``If you look at the corn around here ... it's just millions of
acres and billions of plants that are genetically similar,'' he
said. ``There are only six parent lines that make up all of the corn
plantings in the U.S., and three of those lines are so closely
related they might as well be the same.
   ``What I'm saying is that we're in sort of an evolutionary race,
with the plants on one side and weather and disease and pests on the
other. We're going to need all the genetic variability that we can
lay our hands on to breed the crops of the future.
   ``The situation is just ripe for epidemics of huge proportions.''
   Much of the problem is economic.
   In 1984, Seed Savers researched ``the entire U.S. and Canadian''
garden seed inventory and found 230 mail-order vegetable seed
catalogs. Three years later, 54 of the 230 had gone out of business.
The huge companies generally discontinue a line of seeds if they
can't sell 500 packets, he said.
   The Seed Savers Exchange attempts to fill that void. It offers
three publications a year, the most important being the winter year
book. Through this 250-page journal, more than 700 members who pay
$15 a year trade their seed collections, many of them strains that
go back generations.
   Whealy himself has strains of vegetable seeds dating to the
Mayflower.
   ``This is the core of the Seed Exchange. The year book lists
4,000 varieties, and almost all of them are not available
commercially,'' he said. ``A lot of it is very rare, material that
is almost extinct.''
   Whealy lives on an 84-acre farm with his wife and five children.
Heritage Farm, as he calls it, is an ideal place to plant the
thousands of seeds he has collected, stored in labeled jars and
recorded on a computer.
   ``Out at the farm we're keeping 2,200 strains of beans, 1,500
kinds of tomatoes and probably between 300 to 400 different kinds of
peppers,'' he said.
   Also at the farm, Whealy is raising a type of cattle called
ancient white park, which were hunted during the 12th and 13th
centuries in England and ``only number about 100 now,'' he said.
He's also raising ``Iowa Blue'' chickens, a vanishing breed once
prevalent in northeast Iowa.
   ``We've also hired an orchard manager who is doing research right
now on varieties we would like to put into an historic apple
orchard,'' he said. ``We imagine it would be 400 to 500 varieties of
19th century apples.''

   ``Animals just have more cuddle appeal. It's a lot easier to get
the concern about an animal than it is to get concerned about a
plant,'' Whealy said, adding that the ``genetic erosion'' of seeds
has been dramatic.
   The U.S. Department of Agriculture conducted a survey of the U.S.
and Canadian garden seed inventory in 1903. A comparison between
that list and the inventory of the government's largest seed
collection found ``only 3 percent of the varieties available in 1903
are still in government collections,'' he said.
   Seed Savers Exchange offers three publications a year, offering
more than 700 members _ who pay $15 a year _ the chance to trade
their seed collections, many of them strains that go back
generations.

<HEAD>Archaeologists Re-Think Early Agriculture</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Evidence that cultivated vegetables
found in a cave are half as old as was believed is forcing
archaeologists to examine their assumptions about how agriculture
was introduced in the Southwest.
   Indians were once thought to have cultivated corn at Bat Cave,
along the southern rim of the Plains of San Augustin in southwest
New Mexico, thousands of years before the agricultural lifestyle
caught on throughout the region.
   Bat Cave was excavated in 1948 and 1950. In an early application
of radiocarbon dating, researchers concluded that corn cobs found at
the cave had been grown 6,000 years ago. The findings influenced a
generation's ideas about early agriculture, said University of New
Mexico anthropologist W.H. Wills.
   A new excavation in 1981 and 1983, and re-examination of the
earlier artifacts using updated radiocarbon techniques showed the
corn, bean and squash specimens from the site are 3,000 to 3,500
years old.
   Those dates correspond to the age of domesticated plants in other
sites in the Southwest, said Wills, who supervised the re-excavation.
   Based on the early findings, researchers speculated that
agriculture spread slowly because crops initially were a dietary
supplement with limited value.
   The newer findings and data from other agricultural sites in the
Mogollon Highlands suggest that people must have considered corn,
beans and squash to be very important for their survival, Wills
said. Cultivation of crops demanded a dramatic change in lifestyle
for those people.
   Because people throughout the region all seemed to adopt
agriculture at about the same time, something might have happened to
the environment to make the change worthwhile, or necessary, he said.
   Hunter-gatherers ranged over the Southwest and northern Mexico,
traveling hundreds of miles a year in small bands. Cultivating crops
at high elevations would have required at least some to remain in
one place for a growing season.
   ``We tend to think of agriculture as inherently better than
running around as hunter-gatherers,'' but early plants were
nutritionally deficient and farms faced the risk of poor weather or
blight, Wills said.
   Corn, squash and beans, the staples of Southwestern agriculture,
were first domesticated in the Valley of Mexico.

   Things are up in the air at New Mexico
State University, and that's the way they like it.
   The Physical Science Laboratory has nearly cornered the market in
high-altitude balloon research since winning a $45 million National
Aeronautics and Space Administration contract in October 1987, said
director Harold Connell. ``It's the only large balloon program in
the country,'' he said.
   The laboratory has launched more than 50 giant helium-filled
balloons that carry scientific payloads weighing up to 6,000 pounds
as high as 130,000 feet _ nearly 27 miles.
   Most are released from the National Scientific Balloon Facility
in Palestine, Texas. The site is used when upper-altitude winds are
from the east, to avoid landings in heavily populated areas. When
the upper winds are from the west, a launch area in Fort Sumner is
used. A series of balloons also launched from Australia and
Antarctica to study last summer's supernova, which was observable
only in the Southern Hemisphere.
   ``The balloons that we fly regularly at Palestine (hold) between
11 million and 29 million cubic feet of helium,'' Connell said.
``The large ones have 15 acres of plastic in them about as thick as
a dry-cleaning garment bag. That 15 acres of plastic will weigh
about 4,000 pounds by itself.''

<NOTE>Turkish Beetle May Be Hero in War on Russian Wheat Aphid</NOTE>
<DATELINE>PALISADE, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A tiny beetle from Turkey may be the hero
of Colorado's war against the Russian wheat aphid, which cost
growers an estimated $26 million last year in damage and controls.
   Some winter wheat fields in Moffat County suffered as much as 25
percent infestation by the aphid last fall, said Bob Hammond, an
entomologist with the state Department of Agriculture Insectary
here. If this winter is mild, the aphids will survive to cause more
problems next spring, he said.
   But the Scynmus frontalis beetle, which looks like its cousin,
the ladybird beetle but is one-fourth the size, may save the day.
   The Scynmus, imported by the U.S. Department of Agriculture
Beneficial Insects Laboratory, kills more Russian wheat aphids than
it can eat. It kills an aphid, briefly feeds, then goes for a fresh
kill. It can rapidly clean out an aphid infestation where its
slower-eating cousin takes much more time.
   The insectary soon will be raising the Scynmus, Hammond said,
though it will take some time to begin mass production because of
space limitations. A new technique will have to be established to
fit the facility's size.

<HEAD>FermiLab's Cancer-Therapy Accelerator Reaches Milestone</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BATAVIA, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory
lost out in the battle to house the world's largest atom smasher,
but developed what officials say is the world's smallest _ to
bombard cancer.
   ``It's the first accelerator built exclusively for medical
treatment,'' FermiLab spokeswoman Barbara Lach said of the $60
million cyclotron being built here for the Loma Linda University
Medical Center in California.
   With conventional radiation _ X-rays and gamma rays _ the beams
go right through the patient, said Loma Linda spokesman Dick
Schaefer. ``We're losing 100,000 people in the United States alone
because we can't put enough radiation on the tumor without doing too
much damage to the good tissue.''
   Proton beams, however, ``come through good tissue at a tremendous
rate of speed and come to a stop'' at the directed target, Schaefer
said. The Loma Linda accelerator will deliver 250 million electron
volts.
   Proton therapy and neutron therapy so far available only through
hospitals with access to major physics laboratories. Neutron
therapy, provided since 1976 to patients at Fermilab's Neutron
Therapy Facility, is available at a handful of U.S. hospitals, said
Fermilab physicist Arlene Lennox. ``We've had people from India ...
the Philippines'' and all 50 states for treatment, she said.
   ``There has been talk of running it 24 hours a day because of the
expected interest,'' said Schaefer. Loma Linda is expected to take
delivery this summer.
   ``It's been an international effort to benefit mankind,'' he
said. Researchers from Sweden, Switzerland, Japan, the Soviet Union
and various parts of the United States contributed to the project.
   The facility carried an initial pricetag of $40 million, since
augmented by $20 million from the U.S. Energy Department, Ms. Lennox
said.
   At 50 tons, it really is small only in accelerator terms.

   The rate of increase in wholesale prices nearly
doubled in 1988 to 4 percent, the worst pace since Americans began
recovering from double-digit inflation at the beginning of the
decade, the government says.
   Although inflation is still a far cry from 1979 and 1980, when
wholesale prices posted back-to-back increases of 13 percent and 12
percent, many economists said Friday they are worried about the
trend.
   The rise in the Labor Department's Producer Price Index for

<HEAD>Northwest Pilots Accuse Airline of Inefficiency</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Northwest Airlines has done better than its
competitors in limiting costs but has been less profitable since its
1986 merger with Republic Airlines, the Air Line Pilots Association
said.
   Northwest planes spent less time in the air and thus generated
less revenue than those of American Airlines, Delta Air Lines and
United Airlines from the beginning of 1986 through mid-1988, the
association said in a study reported this weekend.
   The association, which represents 4,800 Northwest pilots, based
its findings on an analysis of U.S. Department of Transportation
data. The pilots and Eagan, Minn.-based Northwest entered mediated
bargaining in late 1988 after 19 months of negotiations failed to
produce a new contract.
   ``We found not only was Northwest not making full use of its
domestic resources, both planes and employees, but that this
phenomenon was beginning to show up as a drag on the bottom line,''
said Pete Quortrup, a Northwest co-pilot and association spokesman.
   Northwest's domestic operating expenses increased by 5 percent
from 1986 to 1988, the study said. Expenses increased at American
and United during that period by 18.8 percent and 15.5 percent,
respectively, it said.
   But American's domestic operating revenues increased 29.1
percent, United's rose 27.4 percent and Delta's grew 17 percent
during the period, while Northwest revenues were up only 2.5
percent, it said.
   Profits for the period soared by 9,961.3 percent at American,
313.4 percent at Delta and 93.9 percent at United. Northwest profits
declined 39.7 percent during the 30-month period, the study said.
   In addition, it said, the number of hours flown daily by each
American, Delta and United plane increased during the period and
declined at Northwest.
   The 1986 merger with Republic prompted Northwest to reduce
service to many cities where both airlines had competed, Quortrup
said. But Northwest left many newly available planes idle instead of
assigning them to other routes, he said.
   Northwest Chairman Steven Rothmeier declined a request by The
Detroit News to be interviewed about the pilots' study but gave
written responses to several questions in a story published Sunday.
   Rothmeier acknowledged that Northwest scaled back use of its
domestic fleet during the first six months of 1988 ``to get a better
handle on customer service.
   ``Anybody who flew Northwest in Detroit knew the problems we were
having: poor on-time performance, baggage mishandling and other
complaints, in large part all the result of inadequate airport
facilities,'' he wrote.
   Northwest also absorbed relatively high labor costs during the
period, including a 14 percent pay raise for former Republic pilots.

   In addition, traders interpreted the slip in retail sales to mean

<TEXT>
   The EEC Commission said Monday it had
begun an inquiry into imports of audio cassette tapes from Asia
which are allegedly being sold in the 12-nation trade bloc at below
market prices.
   The Commission said it had opened the anti-dumping investigation
after receiving a complaint from the European Council of Chemical
Manufacturers' Federations on behalf of EEC producers of audio
cassette tapes.
   CEFIC claimed that the imports from Japan, South Korea and Hong
Kong rose 23 percent between 1984 and 1987. It said the three
countries had exported 234.5 million audio cassettes in 1987, up
from 190.6 million in 1984, taking their share of the European
Economic Community market from 65 percent to 71 percent in 1987.
   The complaint also alleges that the Asian tapes were undercutting
prices charged by EEC producers by between 3.4 percent and 28.5
percent.
   CEFIC said that as a result of this price undercutting, EEC
producers had had to lower their prices so much that they had
suffered ``substantial reduction of their profits and significant
losses.''
   EEC producers' production had dropped from 156 million audio
cassettes in 1984 to 151 million in 1987, CEFIC said.
   Among the 20 exporters from Hong Kong named in the complaint who
exported 24.2 million audio tapes in 1987, are Magnetic Enterprise
Ltd., Sound and Sound (H.K.) Magnetic Tape Ltd., and the Sun Tak
Magnetic Industrial Co.
   The nine Japanese exporters, whose exports totaled 173.2 million
tapes in 1987 are 3M, Fuji Film, TDK, Maxell, Konica, Sony, Victor,
Matsushita and Columbia.
   The six South Korean firms exported 37.1 million audio cassette
tapes in 1987. They are Sun Electronics, Inc., Goldstar@CC,VC,
SKC@VC, SK Magnetic@CC, Saehan Media@CC,VC and Kolon@VC.

<HEAD>Promising Signs For Ailing Economy, But Austerity Still Hurts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY GERBER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>OSLO, Norway (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly three years of forced austerity have
produced some encouraging signs for Norway's ailing economy, but
most people are still feeling the pinch of hard times.
   Oslo is listed as Europe's most expensive city by Business
International, the Geneva research company, and bargains have long
been hard to find anywhere in the country.
   But real trouble came in the mid-80s with a sudden drop in the
price of oil, a major Norwegian export. Easy credit and plenty of
money had given Norwegians a spending habit, and many households
went in debt to buy television sets, furniture, foreign vacations or
cars.
   ``The last year, people really have been buying less,'' said Anne
Titlerstad, manager of Tronsmo bookstore near the center of Oslo.
``I think people are cutting down on luxuries _ if you can call it
luxuries _ like going to the cinema or taking a taxi.''
   As the banks tightened credit, one result was a wave of
bankruptcies. Last year, 3,494 companies filed bankruptcy petitions,
up 81 percent from the previous year. Most victims were small firms
with less than 10 employees.
   And though many countries might be envious of Norway's 3.2
percent unemployment figure, that December rate was more than double
the figure for December 1987, and it's expected to keep climbing.
   ``Unemployment is a necessary evil to improve the trade balance
and hold down domestic demand,'' said Hans Petter Wilse, an
economist at Norges Bank, the central bank. ``The increase is not
what we want, but it's necessary to avoid an even worse situation in
the future.''
   The government of Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland, a social
democrat, has had to enforce some unpopular measures to keep the
economy afloat. Last summer, a wage restriction law limited
increases to one krone per hour, or 15 cents.
   The measure means that most workers are not keeping abreast of
inflation, which was measured at an annual rate of 5.6 percent in
December. It has, however, helped bring inflation down.
   In 1987, inflation reached 8.7 percent. Wilse said the decline
was encouraging, but ``not as much as we had hoped.''
   Other encouraging signs, on paper at least, are an improved trade
balance, lower interest rates and indications that Norwegians are
saving more.
   Central bank projections show that Norway in 1988 will show a
positive personal savings figure after three years of Norwegians'
spending more than they earned.
   That may be small comfort though, to people trying to make do
with less money, especially since middle-income wage earners can
expect to pay out about half their salaries in taxes.
   A liter of milk costs about 6.40 kroner (96 cents), a dozen eggs
is 21.85 ($3.27). A kilo (2.2 pounds) of fresh sliced codfish runs
75 kroner or $11.22. Shoppers pay 45 kroner and up for a pair of
wool socks and 700 kroner or more for a pair of solid winter boots.
   Several Norwegians said in interviews that widespread
dissatisfaction could turn into trouble for the government, which
has been in office since the spring of 1986. Income taxes have gone
up every year since then, and a national election is scheduled Sept.
11.
   ``The government has a tough task because it's easy to take shots
at them,'' said Wilse.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. is expected to
take part in a planned consortium bid for General Electric Co. PLC
of Britain, a respected financial daily reported Monday.
   Analysts said, however, that GEC's defenses against a consortium
takeover bid was strengthened by its announcement Friday of a merger
with the U.S.-based General Electric Co. of their European consumer
products, medical equipment and some electrical divisions.
   The Financial Times reported that AT&amp;T was expected to confirm
its participation in the dramatic bid for GEC this week following
weekend negotiations with Lazard Brothers investment firm.
   The Financial Times and other newspapers also reported that the
British electronics firm Plessey Co. PLC made a bid to acquire GPT,
an electronics company it jointly owns with GEC, citing a broken
agreement between the two companies.
   GEC, which itself has made a $3 billion bid with West Germany's
Siemens AG for Plessey, said it would fight to keep its share of
GPT, reports in The Guardian and Financial Times said.
   The financial daily said that under a deal with the consortium,
AT&amp;T would take a controlling stake in GPT. It said AT&amp;T would
announce its participation after a board meeting Wednesday in New
York.
   In the United States, AT&amp;T spokesman Walter Murphy declined to
comment on the reports.
   Lazard Brothers is the merchant bank adviser to Plessey, which
also has been reported to be a member of the consortium bidding for
GEC, along with the French company Thomson.
   The announcement of a deal between GE and GEC dampened
speculation that GE, which had not been related to the British GEC,
would participate in the consortium to buy GEC. GE is paying $580
million to GEC in the joint-venture agreement.
   In the case of GPT, Plessey served notice to GEC Saturday night
that it intended to buy out GEC's holding in the company they formed
a year ago, the reports said.
   Plessey said that GEC, by making its bid with Siemens, had broken
an agreement not to change the 50-50 ownership arrangement, the
dailies reported. GEC had promised Siemens 40 percent of Plessey.
   If either side broke the agreement, the other was allowed to buy
its share at a price determined by independent auditors.
   A spokesman for Plessey, who was not named, denied the company's
move was designed as a ``spoiling tactic. We believe they have
broken an agreement in good faith. We have to protect our
shareholders' interests,'' the Observer reported Sunday.
   But an unnamed GEC spokesman called the move a ``pretty
unconvincing argument,'' in the Financial Times.
   On Thursday, the British government referred the GEC-Siemens bid
for Plessey to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, which blocks
the takeover during a three-month inquiry into its effects on
competition.
   The European Economic Community Commission will examine the
agreement between GE and GEC closely before deciding to investigate
whether it impedes fair competition within the 12-nation trade bloc,
according to an official who spoke on condition of anonymity.

<HEAD>Ford to Switch Sierra Production to Belgium</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ford Motor Co. Ltd. said Monday it plans to switch
production of its Sierra model from Britain to Belgium as part of
its strategy to prepare for the single European market in 1992.
   The gradual production switch is likely to cut 500 jobs in
Dagenham, northeast of London, and create 2,000 jobs in Genk,
Belgium, over the next five years, said a Ford spokesman, who wasn't
identified, in accordance with British practice.
   Ford said it planned to achieve the job reductions through
attrition and voluntary layoffs.
   ``It's all part of a realignment of our European production
program to increase capacity and improve efficiency,'' the Ford
spokesman said. ``The basic logic behind the whole thing is that a
plant producing one type of car is more efficient than one producing
two types of cars.''
   The moves will strengthen the company's ability to meet
anticipated increases and variations in demand by 1992, when the
Common Market is to become one barrier-free marketplace of 320
million consumers, Ford said.
   Dagenham, which currently employs 8,300 auto workers, will
concentrate on the new Fiesta model, to be introduced in the spring,
with production to be increased to match the current combined output
of Sierras and Fiestas of 1,100 a day.
   Genk, which employs about 10,000 people, is to become the sole
European source for the Sierra, producing an expected 1,500 a day.
It now produces about 1,100 Sierras daily, plus Transit vans.
   Amalgamated Engineering Union executive member Jimmy Airlie,
secretary of the seven-union Ford negotiating committee, said: ``Our
initial reaction is one of considerable concern.
   ``The Sierra is Ford's most important car and the loss of
production from the U.K. will have a catastrophic effect on the
Dagenham operation. The full ramifications of the announcement are
not yet known.''
   All the unions involved are to hold an urgent meeting later this
week, Airlie said.
   Ford also has plants in Halewood, Britain; Cologne, West Germany;
and Valencia, Spain.

   The stock market was little changed today in
quiet holiday trading.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials slipped 1.96 to 2,224.11
in the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers and losers ran about even in the overall tally of New
York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 420 up, 429 down and 564
unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 15.72 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Trading had been expected to be light because of the absence of
many investors taking the day off in observance of the Rev. Martin
Luther King Jr.'s birthday.
   Analysts said the mood of the markets kept brightening gradually
as the rally in stock prices that began last November continued into
the new year.
   By the end of last week, several primary indicators of market
trends stood at their highest levels since the crash in October 1987.
   However, brokers said some traders were selling today to cash in
on those gains. Many Wall Streeters worry that the rally cannot make
much progress unless interest rates turn downward.
   Losers among the blue chips included American Express, down \ at
27}; Sears Roebuck, down \ at 41}; General Electric, down [ at 44~,
and Eastman Kodak, down [ at 44}.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
slipped .05 to 159.53. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was up .06 at 315.99.
   On Friday the Dow Jones industrial average rose 3.75 to 2,226.07,
finishing the week with a net gain of 31.78 points.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 7 to 5 on the
NYSE, with 843 up, 594 down and 532 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 132.32 million shares, against 183

<HEAD>Some Holding Out Their RJR Stock</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   WINSTON-SALEM (AP) _ Some RJR Nabisco stockholders are refusing
to part with their RJR Nabisco stock, apparently under the belief
that their RJR dividends will keep coming in the mail, financial
officials say.
   In addition, some feel they are voting against the buyout, by not
tendering ``and that's a real mistake,'' said David Schamens,
managing executive of Integrated Resources Equity Corp.
   Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. won the bidding war for RJR Nabisco
six weeks ago in a record $25 billion cash deal.
   Schamens said about 2 percent of his RJR callers are holdouts.
   ``They think that the dividends are just going to keep coming in
the mail every three months, and, unfortunately, they're wrong,''
Schamens said.
   Under the law, stockholders have two years to trade their RJR
Nabisco shares for the new securities. If they take no action, their
holdings then go to a North Carolina fund where it is held for seven
years. If not claimed in that time, it belongs to the state.
   Harry Rolison, manager of corporate trust at Wachovia Bank and
Trust Co., said he talked with a couple last week who did not plan
to sell their shares on the market or tender them to KKR.
   They were planning to take securities that KKR expects to issue
for RJR stock after its cash offer expires Jan. 31. But they did not
realize they would be losing their RJR Nabisco dividend.
   ``Once they understood that, it was obvious to me that they were
reconsidering,'' Rolison said.
   KKR won the right to acquire RJR Nabisco with a bid of $25
billion. Under the terms of the cash tender offer, KKR will pay $109
a share in cash for about 74 percent of RJR Nabisco's outstanding
common stock. In a second step expected in late April or May, KKR
will issue preferred stock and converting debentures for the
remaining shares.
   When the deal is done, stockholders who tendered their shares
will have received about $81 in cash and $28 in securities for each
share.
   Gene Hoots, an investment consultant in Winston-Salem, said he
thinks there is a sizable group of stockholders who have done
nothing to get ready to sell or tender.
   ``There are people who have actually left town for extended
periods without ... having taken care of this,'' he said. ``For
those people, this could be a very expensive decision.
   ``For goodness sakes, they need to get their paperwork in order
and talk to somebody who can help them.''
   The securities KKR will issue are expected to be traded at a
discount of about 70 percent of their face value immediately after
the transaction is completed. But KKR has included a provision in
the deal that it hopes will raise the value of the securities to par
value in two years.
   While many stockholders are opting to sell their stock outright,
Schamens said he is advising people to tender their shares to KKR.
RJR Nabisco stock closed at $94.75 Friday on the New York Stock
Exchange.

   The revamped annual automotive show in the

   Patrick Fitzgerald, spokesman for the North American

Detroit Auto Show, drew 451,626 people.
   There were 41 exhibitors at this year's show, 17 more than last
year's, displaying nearly 700 cars and light trucks.
   For years, the Chicago Auto Show has stolen the thunder from the
Detroit show, and organizers said this year's show in Detroit would
put the city back on top of the U.S. auto show heap. The 1989
Chicago Auto Show is scheduled for Feb. 11-19.

<HEAD>Coastal Corp. to Begin Cash Tender Offer for Texas Eastern Corp.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Coastal Corp. today announced it was making an
unsolicited cash tender offer for Texas Eastern Corp. in a $2.6
billion deal that would combine two of Houston's largest energy
companies.
   The $42 per share offer was about 40 percent more than Texas
Eastern stock closed on Friday.
   In early composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Texas
Eastern's stock soared more than $13 to $43.87{ a share, after
closing at $30\ on Friday. Coastals' stock was down | at $34\ on the
exchange.
   Texas Eastern said in a statement this morning that the Coastal
tender offer had not been made and that the company had not received
a copy of the tender offer.
   ``When the offer is received, the board of directors of Texas
Eastern will carefully consider the offer and expects to advise its
shareholders of its recommendations not to take more than 10
business days from the date of commencement of such tender offer,''
the Texas Eastern statement said.
   Coastal said the decision to make the offer was approved at a
Sunday night meeting of its board of directors. Coastal said it
would begin the offer on Tuesday for all outstanding shares of Texas
Eastern's common stock.
   James R. Paul, president and chief operating officer of Coastal,
wrote Dennis R. Hendrix, president and chief executive officer of
Texas Eastern, requesting a meeting with the Texas Eastern board of
directors to discuss a business combination.
   A federal judge in Houston today was to consider a request from
Coastal for a temporary restraining order to keep Texas Eastern's
board of directors from taking any action to prevent shareholders
from accepting the offer.
   ``We are convinced that a combination of Coastal and Texas
Eastern would be in the best interests of our respective
stockholders as well as employees, customers and suppliers,'' Paul
wrote. ``Operating flexibility and efficiencies brought about by a
combination of our companies would significantly improve the
abilitites of each company to provide the best possible service to
customers.''
   ``We also believe that our offer is a fair one. It gives Texas
Eastern's stockholders an opportunity to receive immediately a very
attractive cash price for all their shares,'' he added.
   Coastal is a Houston-based diversified energy firm with $8
billion in assets and operations in natural gas transmission and
storage, gas and oil exploration and production, refining and
marketing, coal, trucking and independent power production.
   Texas Eastern is involved in natural gas and petroleum products,
pipeline and international oil and gas exploration and production.
It also refines and markets petroleum products at wholesale and is
involved in real estate projects.
   The offer which will be made by Coastal's wholly owned
subsidiary, Colorado Interstate Corp., will be subject to conditions
which will be disclosed in the company's filing with the Securities
and Exchange Commission.
   Coastal said its offer will be financed primarily by bank
borrowings and subordinated notes. Citibank N.A. has informed the
company by letter it is highly confident it can provide up to $2
billion in senior bank financing including $500 million Citibank
will provide under a firm commitment.
   Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. sent a letter to Coastal saying it is
confident it can place up to $1.3 billion in subordinated notes of
Coastal.

   The merger is subject to approval by stockholders of Sound
Warehouse at a meeting in March or early April.
   Sound Warehouse, based in Dallas, has 121 outlets in 13 states.
An additional 10 outlets are planned for opening by Dec. 31. For the

   A year ago, Sport magazine swore off swimsuit
issues, and gave its readers a pinup sports calendar rather than
``devoting 16 pages to luscious photos of beautiful women in
swimsuits'' as competing magazines did.
   ``There are no sexy pictures there (just some remarkable sports
photos), but you don't have to hide it from your kid either,'' the
magazine's editor said in a message to readers in the
January-February 1988 issue.
   But that was last year.
   Sport's latest issue recently hit the stands with a dark-haired
model on the cover, appropriately dressed for what the headline over
the magazine title called its ``Hot Swimsuit Issue.''
   The magazine's executives note that new owners _ and a new editor
_ have taken over since the last policy pronouncement on swimsuits.
Petersen Publishing Co., based in Los Angeles, bought the magazine
last summer.
   And the new owners say they are giving the predominantly-male
sports magazine audience what it wants, as demonstrated by the huge
popularity of the swimsuit issues from its rivals, Sports
Illustrated and Inside Sports.
   What's a faithful follower of Sport magazine to think?
   ``Our readers are going to be happy that Sport magazine changed
its mind,'' said executive editor Kelly Garrett.
   Sport is reviving its swimsuit issue just weeks before Sports
Illustrated celebrates the 25th anniversary of its first swimsuit
edition with a blitz that will include a pay-cable program, a home
video and a desk calendar.
   Sports Illustrated designed its initial swimsuit issue as a
travel feature to brighten up the dark days between the football and
baseball seasons when many Northern cities are snowbound and sports
fans are blue.
   The swimsuit issues periodically have sparked protests that the
sections are sexist, exploit women and are unsuited to a sports
magazine. Some readers threaten subscription cancellations, although
publisher Donald Barr said he had fewer than 50 cancellations due to
last year's swimsuit issue.
   Sports Illustrated charges about 28 percent more for ad space and
75 percent more for a single copy of its swimsuit issue. It expects
to sell nearly 5.5 million copies of this year's special issue _
which hits the newstands Feb. 6 _ compared with the usual 3 million
for regular issues.
   Barr has also agreed as part of the 25th anniversary to have a
video shot in connection with the swimsuit issue.
   Home Box Office Inc. plans to air the 47-minute video about
shooting the swimsuit issue several times starting Feb. 9. A
slightly longer home video will made available a few days later in
video, retail and magazine stores.
   Bridget Potter, an HBO executive, said retailers had placed about
350,000 orders for the home video, which will be priced at $19.99.
It will carry two automobile commercials for which Chrysler Corp.
paid $337,500.
   Next fall, a special 25th anniversary desk calendar will be
published for 1990 using photos taken for the 1989 swimsuit issue.
Tom Ettinger of Sports Illustrated Enterprises said he expects to
sell about 250,000 desk calendars at $12.95 each in addition to
500,000 of the usual wall calendars at $10.95 each.
   Magazine executives decline to say how much will be made from the
25th anniversary issue and related products, but Business Week
magazine estimates total sales could reach $30 million.
   Inside Sports, owned by Century Publishing Co. in Evanston, Ill.,
has its ninth swimsuit issue on the newsstands, and hopes to sell
850,000 copies compared with a normal rate base of 500,000.
   The magazine's first swimsuit issue was a parody of Sports
Illustrated's version, showing pretty women in swimwear carrying
rolled-up copies of the competition's swimsuit issue.
   ``It was so well-received that we decided we would keep doing our
own every year,'' said marketer Jerry Croft.
   Sport magazine tried its first swimsuit issue in March 1986,
featuring swimsuit-clad women athletes from all fields, but sales
failed to improve.
   In his message to readers last year, then-editor Neil Cohen
wrote, ``We didn't feel comfortable with the pages, they didn't fit
our magazine.''
   This year, Sport used professional models rather than athletes in
swimsuits. Publisher Lew Green is looking for a sales boost _ but
won't say how much _ in Sport's rate base of 850,000 copies.
   Green makes no apology for the change in philosophy on swimsuit
issues.
   ``What we are showing here is appropriate for a young male
audience,'' he said. ``... It's part of what sports are all about.''

<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar rose Monday against most major
currencies in European trading.
   Gold prices fell, and silver dipped to its lowest level in nearly
22 months in London.
   Foreign exchange dealers said trading activity was lighter than
normal because of holidays in the United States and Japan.
   They said that with chances reduced for market intervention by
either the U.S. or Japanese central banks, dealers tested the
dollar's strength and pushed dollar rates higher.
   Dealers said the market was looking toward Wednesday's expected
release of U.S. trade figures for November. The November deficit is
expected to widen from the October deficit of $10.35 billion.
   In London, the British pound fell to $1.7615 late Monday from
$1.7770 late Friday.
   Also in London, the dollar traded late in the day at 128.05
Japanese yen, compared with 126.65 yen late Friday in Tokyo.
   Other late rates for the dollar in Europe, compared with Friday's
late rates, included: 1.8575 West German marks, up from 1.8275;

<HEAD>NCR Earnings Fall, But Per-Share Earnings Set Record</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   NCR Corp. said its earnings fell 7.4 percent and revenue fell 1
percent in the fourth quarter, but the computer maker's stock
repurchase program lowered the number of outstanding shares and
helped it post record earnings per share for the period.
   NCR, of Dayton, Ohio, said it earned $149.6 million on revenue of
$1.80 billion in the three months ended Dec. 31, down from $161.4
million on revenue of $1.82 billion a year earlier. But a reduction
in outstanding shares caused earnings per share to rise to a record
$1.85 from $1.79 a year earlier.
   For the full year, NCR said its earnings rose 4.8 percent to
$439.3 million, or $5.33 per share, from $419.3 million, or $4.51 a
share. Revenue rose 6.2 percent to $5.99 billion from $5.64 billion.
   NCR said revenue outside the United States, which accounts for
more than half its total revenue, increased in the fourth quarter
and substantially offset declines in U.S. revenue. It said orders
set a record in the quarter.

<HEAD>Brazilian Government Seeks Support For ``Total War'' Against Inflation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JORGE MEDEROS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Amid widespread skepticism, the
government on Monday began a campaign to persuade Congress and the
Brazilian people to support a radical anti-inflation program
announced Sunday.
   President Jose Sarney, in a nationwide radio and TV address
Sunday, asked Brazilians to back him in a ``total war'' on the
nation's 933 percent inflation rate. The plan includes a
wage-and-price freeze, government spending cuts and a currency
devaluation.
   However, initial reaction to the economic reforms was lukewarm.
   Mario Amato, president of the powerful Federation of Industries
of Sao Paulo State, said he didn't like the price freeze. But, he
added, ``We will ask businessmen to make this new sacrifice.''
   The leader of the influential Metalworkers Union of Sao Paulo,
Luiz Antonio Medeiros, said after Sarney's speech he would back a
general strike to protest the wage freeze. But on Monday he said the
president ``deserves a vote of confidence.''
   ``If the plan fails it will be catastrophic. We'll go back to
hyperinflation and lose the best thing we have: democracy,''
Medeiros said in a televised interview.
   Sarney, a civilian, took office in 1985 after a 21-year military
regime. But his inability to halt inflation led to Leftist gains in
recent nationwide elections and rumors of military unrest.
   The anti-inflation program is the third enacted by the Sarney
government. The first two, in 1986 and 1987, enjoyed some early
success but then collapsed disastrously under black marketeering,
shortages and reheated inflation.
   Under the new plan, prices of many items and salaries will be
frozen indefinitely. The government also created a new currency, the
``new cruzado,'' by devaluing the old cruzado 17 percent and lopping
off three of its zeroes. One new cruzado is worth roughly one U.S.
dollar.
   Sarney also promised to sharply cut government spending, seen as
the main cause of inflation. He pledged to fire about 60,000 federal
employees, sell off 14 state-run companies and eliminate five of
Brazil's 27 ministries, as well as 42 government agencies.
   To avoid a surge in consumer spending that sabotaged the earlier
price freezes, the government announced it would raise interest
rates and restrict credit time payments.
   A bank holiday was decreed Monday and Tuesday to allow banks to
adapt to the reforms. Long lines formed at automatic tellers as
Brazilians withdrew cash to tide them over until banks reopened.
   In Sao Paulo, supermarkets closed Monday morning while employees
changed prices to meet government-set limits. However, there were
charges that many shops had raised prices as much as 100 percent in
anticipation of the freeze.
   In Rio, the illegal but widely tolerated numbers game known as
the ``Animal Game'' was suspended Monday to avoid confusion over the
currency change.
   In Brasilia, the capital, Finance Minister Mailson da Nobrega
warned that Brazil could suspend interest payments on its huge
foreign debt if it needed hard currency to make the plan work.
   Brazil has a foreign debt of $115 billion, the Third World's
largest. In 1987 the government stopped interest payments to private
overseas creditors when reserves fell low, but the moratorium was
lifted last year.
   The new program must be approved by Congress within 30 days. The
two-chamber body is in recess for Southern Hemisphere summer
vacation and was to convene in special session.
   Conservatives and Leftists promised to oppose the plan. But the
centrist Brazilian Democratic Movement Party was expected to give
Sarney enough votes to get the program approved.
   ``The Congress will not deny the country this chance at national
salvation,'' said Rep. Carlos Santanna, leader of the Democratic
Movement Party.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Northern Telecom Ltd., the Canadian
telecommunications company, said Monday it had picked former Unisys
Corp. executive Paul Stern to serve as its vice chairman and chief
executive.
   Stern, 50, will take the post on March 1 and then ascend to the
rank of chairman and chief executive at the time of the planned
retirement of Edmund B. Fitzgerald, the current chairman, in April
1990, the Mississauga, Ontario-based company said.
   Stern, a resident of Villanova, Pa., joined Northern Telecom's
board of directors and was elected to its executive committee in
April 1988 and has also served as a consultant to it since May.
   Stern joined Burroughs Corp. in 1981 as executive vice president
and was appointed president and chief operating officer in May 1982.
When Burroughs bought Sperry Corp. in 1986 to form Unisys, Stern
became president of the new company and served in that post until
Dec. 31, 1987.
   Northern Telecom, a leading supplier of digital phone equipment,
had 1987 revenue of about $4.9 billion.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Most corn, soybean and oat futures prices plunged
their permitted daily limits Monday on the Chicago Board of Trade in
reaction to a government report indicating corn and soybean supplies
were larger than expected.
   Wheat futures prices closed mixed.
   Corn futures dropped to their lowest level since Dec. 21 and
soybeans hit their lowest price since Dec. 14 in reaction to an
Agriculture Department crop report released Friday after the grain
markets closed.
   The USDA said 1988 U.S. corn production totaled 4.92 billion
bushels, more than 30 percent below the 1987 harvest but much higher
than market analysts had expected.
   The USDA pegged the nation's corn stockpile as of Dec. 1 at 7.07
billion bushels, down from 9.77 billion a year earlier but still
well above pre-report estimates.
   The corn numbers were considered the most bearish in the report,
but the government's numbers for soybean production and stocks also
were greater than expected.
   The USDA's wheat numbers, taken alone, were bullish. But analysts
said the corn and soybean markets pulled down wheat prices for
near-month delivery.
   Analysts said they expected corn and soybean futures to open
lower on Tuesday.
   Corn and most oat futures contracts lost 10 cents a bushel, the
daily limit. Four of the nine soybean delivery months fell by 30
cents a bushel, the limit in that market, and the limitless contract
for January delivery fell 36} cents.
   At the close, wheat was 10{ cents lower to 3 cents higher with
the contract for delivery in March at $4.30{ a bushel; corn was 10
cents lower across the board with March at $2.78\ a bushel; oats
were 9 cents to 10 cents lower with March at $2.33 a bushel;
soybeans were 18{ cents to 36} cents lower with January at $7.67 a
bushel.

<HEAD>Six OPEC Members Have 70 percent of World's Oil Reserves</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Six members of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries now have 70.5 percent of the world's
proven oil reserves, the Middle East Economic Survey reported Monday.
   The respected oil industry newsletter said that, according to
revised estimates, reserves for the ``big six'' in the last five
years has risen from 308 billion barrels to a total of 699 billion
barrels.
   It listed Saudi Arabia with 255 billion barrels, Iraq with 100
billion, the United Arab Emirates with 98 billion, Kuwait with 95
billion, Iran with 93 billion and Venezuela with 58 billion.
   The five Persian Gulf states alone account for nearly two-thirds
of the world's proven reserves.
   Saudi Arabia last week upgraded its reserves by 85 billion
barrels to 255 billion following a six-year study.
   The Arabian American Oil Co. noted that with additional
development and exploration their ``remaining reserves could be as
high as 313 billion barrels of oil.''
   Describing the Saudi revision as ``a staggering increase,'' the
Nicosia-based survey noted: ``The reassessment of reserves in Saudi
Arabia represents the latest stage of a truly massive upward
revision of proven oil reserves by the major OPEC countries in
recent years.''
   In other OPEC news Monday, Venezuelan president-elect Carlos
Andres Perez arrived in Abu Dhabi as part of a Gulf swing designed
to bolster unity within OPEC and stablize oil prices.
   He said he would discuss with Gulf leaders the possibility of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries holding a summit. Such
a summit, if held, would be the second since 1975.
   However, U.A.E. oil minister Mana Saeed Otaiba, who is
participating in the talks with Perez, said he believes that such a
summit is premature.
   During his gulf tour, Perez was scheduled to visit Iraq and Iran,
OPEC members who have been at war for eight years until a cease-fire
agreement was reached in August.
   The U.A.E. has been one of the OPEC states often accused of
overshooting OPEC production quotas and contributing to the glut
that weakened oil prices.

   Contributions to worthy causes by the largest
U.S. corporations continue to level off, the Conference Board said
Monday.
   According to a survey of 328 leading corporations, contributions
rose by less than 5 percent in 1987, the latest year for which
complete data were available.
   Donations over the last three years have gone up by 3 percent to
7 percent annually. These are much smaller rises than the
double-digit ones posted over the previous decade, said the board, a
nonprofit group that does management and economic research.
   Total contributions, including those made by both large and small
corporations, came to about $4.6 billion in 1987, the same as the
1986 level.
   In 1988, corporate giving appears to have been flat or possibly
less than in 1987, the sponsors of the survey said. The survey was
jointly sponsored by the Board and the Council for Aid to Education.

   Trading had been expected to be light because of the absence of
many investors taking the day off in observance of the Rev. Martin
Luther King Jr.'s birthday.
   Analysts said the mood of the markets had been brightening

continued into the new year.
   By the end of last week, several primary indicators of market

   However, brokers said some traders were selling today to cash in
on those gains. Many Wall Streeters worry that the rally cannot make
much more progress unless interest rates turn downward.

   The stock market turned in an inconclusive
showing Monday in quiet holiday trading, pausing after the rally of
the past several weeks.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which had gained ground
in seven of the eight preceding sessions, slipped 1.43 to 2,224.64.
   Advancing issues slightly outnumbered declines in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 695 up, 679
down and 574 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 117.38 million
shares, down from 132.32 million in the previous session.
Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 138.87 million shares.
   Trading had been expected to be light because of the absence of
many investors taking a holiday in observance of the Rev. Martin
Luther King Jr.'s birthday.
   Analysts said the mood of the markets had been brightening
gradually as the rally in stock prices that began last November
continued into the new year.
   By the end of last week, several primary indicators of market
trends stood at their highest levels since the crash in October 1987.
   However, brokers said some traders were selling Monday to cash in
on those gains. Many Wall Streeters worry that the rally cannot make
much more progress unless interest rates turn downward.
   Another question mark in many minds is the government's impending
monthly report Wednesday on the nation's position in international
trade.
   Advance estimates at leading brokerage houses generally call for
the U.S. trade deficit to widen for November to $11 billion or more
from the $10.3 billion gap reported for October.
   In the action that did take place Monday, takeover news and
rumors provided the dominant theme.
   Texas Eastern led the active list and jumped 14} to 45 on word of
Coastal Corp.'s plan to make a $42-a-share bid for the company.
   Traders who pushed the stock past Coastal's proposed price are
looking for a higher bid to emerge, analysts said.
   The news on Texas Eastern prompted buying of such other
natural-gas pipeline issues as Transco Energy, up 1\ at 36[, and
Panhandle Eastern, up 1 at 26{.
   Tidewater, subject of a $9.50-a-share proposal from investor
Irwin Jacobs, climbed 1] to 8~.
   Sound Warehouse, which agreed to be acquired by Shamrock Holdings
for $25.65 a share, rose 2| to 24| in the over-the-counter market.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $2.24 billion, or 0.08
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks added
.20 to 159.78.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose .08 to 328.89, and S&amp;P's

   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market gained

index closed at 316.81, up .88.

   ``We will have management and employees who have worked together
and established a superior track record in oil and gas
exploration,'' Foster said. ``We will focus on an area of the Gulf
of Mexico which is gas prone, where the group has knowledge, and has
had good success.''
   Duncan Cook &amp; Co., a Houston investment firm headed by former
U.S. Energy Secretary Charles W. Duncan Jr., is providing initial
funding and investment advice for the venture.
   Late last year, Tenneco sold all its oil and gas segments to
various buyers. The sale brought the company $7.3 billion.

   Cleary joined Heileman as legal counsel in 1960 and was named
president in 1971 after his father-in-law, the late Roy E. Kumm,
retired.
   Under Kumm and Cleary, the brewery made more than 50 acquisitions
and rose from the nation's 39th-largest brewer to fourth in national
sales by 1986. Sales increased from $100 million in 1970 to more
than $1.3 billion last year.
   Bond Corp., a multinational company headquartered in Australia,
became the world's fifth-largest brewer when it acquired Heileman.

   A European subsidiary of Time Inc. Monday
announced the purchase of Books for Children, a large British book
club, from Independent Television Publications.
   The price paid for the acquisition by Time-Life Books (Europe)
Inc. was not disclosed.
   In an announcement released in London and made available in New
York, Books for Children was described as Britain's largest quality
hardback book club for children from pre-school age to early teens.
   Its monthly catalogue includes books about such famous characters
as ``Winnie the Pooh'' and ``Thomas the Tank Engine.'' The club is
known for its policy of introducing new, imaginative authors and
illustrators and it sponsors the annual Mother Goose Award for the
most exciting newcomer to British children's book illustration.
   Joe Ward, president and chief executive officer of Time-Life
Books (Europe), said the acquisition is part of the company's
strategy of international expansion and the development of a
significant children's publishing capacity.
   ``We have been interested in obtaining Books for Children for
some time because it is a natural fit for our own plans to grow in
the children's market,'' said Ward.
   Independent Television Publications, owned by 15 independent
television companies in Britain, acts as the magazine publishing arm
of independent television. Its main publication is TV Times,
Britain's second largest selling magazine.

<HEAD>Coastal to Begin Cash Tender Offer for Texas Eastern Corp.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH RENDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Coastal Corp. announced Monday it planned to
launch a $2.6 billion tender offer for Texas Eastern Corp. in a deal
that would make Coastal the nation's largest natural gas company.
   The $42 per share offer was about 40 percent more than Texas
Eastern's closing stock price on Friday.
   The announcement sent Texas Eastern stock soaring by $14.75 a
share to $45 in trading on the New York Stock Exchange, which
analysts said indicated the bidding may go higher.
   At the same time, Coastal's stock fell 75 cents a share to
$34.12{.
   Houston-based Coastal is the third largest natural gas company in
the country while Texas Eastern, also of Houston, is among the top
six. Another Houston firm, Enron Corp., holds the top position,
analysts said.
   ``In my view, Coastal and Enron are two prototypes of interstate
pipeline networks of the future,'' said Charles Strain, director of
energy research for Lovett Mitchell Webb &amp; Garrison in Houston.
   Texas Eastern is attractive to both companies because of its
pipeline system reaching the Northeast market.
   Strain said even though the acquisition will put Coastal further
in debt, in the long run it is a good move because pipeline
regulations are expected to be relaxed.
   William D. Hyler, an analyst for Oppenheimer &amp; Co. Inc. in New
York, said he was surprised by Coastal's timing of the offer because
of its debt.
   Coastal had nearly $3.5 billion in debt outstanding as of Sept.
30, according to Coastal spokesman R.W. Wells.
   ``I believe they've always had an interest in this company,''
Hyler said. ``Apparently they thought that if they waited someone
else would get it. In the long term, it looks good. It's a good
strategic fit.''
   Hyler said if the buyout were successful, he expected Coastal to
sell off Texas Eastern's exploration and production operations.
   Monday's jump in the price of Texas Eastern stock, however,
prompted analysts to predict Coastal would have to sweeten its offer
to $45 or $48 per share.
   Texas Eastern urged its shareholders not to not to take any
action on the expected tender offer until it makes its
recommendation.
   ``When the offer is received, the board of directors of Texas
Eastern will carefully consider the offer and expects to advise its
shareholders of its recommendation no later than 10 business days
from the date of commencement of such tender offer,'' Texas Eastern
said in a statement.
   Coastal said the decision to make the offer was approved at a
Sunday night meeting of its board of directors. Coastal said it
would begin the offer on Tuesday for all outstanding shares of Texas
Eastern's common stock.
   U.S. District Judge Lynn Hughes in Houston was considering a
request from Coastal for a temporary restraining order to keep Texas
Eastern's board of directors from taking any action to prevent
shareholders from accepting the offer.
   James R. Paul, president and chief operating officer of Coastal,
wrote his counterpart at Texas Eastern, Dennis R. Hendrix,
requesting a meeting with the Texas Eastern board of directors to
discuss a business combination.
   ``We are convinced that a combination of Coastal and Texas
Eastern would be in the best interests of our respective
stockholders as well as employees, customers and suppliers,'' Paul
wrote. ``Operating flexibility and efficiencies brought about by a
combination of our companies would significantly improve the
abilitites of each company to provide the best possible service to
customers.
   ``We also believe that our offer is a fair one. It gives Texas
Eastern's stockholders an opportunity to receive immediately a very
attractive cash price for all their shares.''
   Coastal is diversified energy firm with $8 billion in assets and
operations in natural gas transmission and storage, gas and oil
exploration and production, refining and marketing, coal, trucking
and independent power production.
   Texas Eastern, with $5 billion in assets, is involved in natural
gas and petroleum products, pipeline and international oil and gas
exploration and production. It also refines and markets petroleum
products at wholesale and is involved in real estate projects.
   Coastal said its offer will be financed primarily by bank
borrowings and subordinated notes. Citibank has told the company by
letter it is confident it can provide up to $2 billion in senior
bank financing including $500 million Citibank will provide under a
firm commitment.
   Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. sent a letter to Coastal saying it is
confident it can place up to $1.3 billion in subordinated notes of
Coastal.
   Drexel's involvment in the takeover attempt comes at a time when
it is finalizing details of its securities fraud plea bargain
settlement with the federal government.
   Under an agreement with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Drexel agreed to pay a record $650 million in fines and restitution,
plead guilty to six unspecified felonies, settle related civil
litigation with the SEC and agree to cooperate in the government's
expanding campaign against Wall Street corruption.

<HEAD>GE Strengthens European Foothold Ahead of 1992</HEAD>
<HEAD>Repeating for all needing.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By COTTEN TIMBERLAKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   America's General Electric Co. has strengthened its
European foothold ahead of 1992 by stepping into a complex
electronics industry takeover battle and emerging with an agreement
with Britain's General Electric Co. PLC to merge European operations.
   The U.S. and British companies, previously unrelated, announced
on Friday that they had reached agreement to merge their European
consumer products, medical equipment and some electrical divisions.
   American and Japanese companies are eager to expand operations in
Europe before 1992, when the 12-nation Common Market is to be
transformed into one barrier-free marketplace of 320 million people.
   GE, the U.S. company, is paying GEC $580 million to create the
joint operations, which will have annual revenue of about $2.45
billion.
   The agreement also helps GEC by serving as a defensive tactic
against a possible takeover bid for GEC by an international
consortium.
   The investment firm Lazard Brothers and Co. announced on Jan. 8
that a new company had been formed to create an international
consortium to make a bid for GEC.
   Such a bid was expected to amount to between $11 billion and $14
billion, making it Britain's largest takeover ever.
   Plessey Co., the target of a $3 billion joint takeover attempt by
GEC and West Germany's Siemens AG, was expected to participate in
the potential consortium bid to buy GEC. Such a counter-bid would be
what Wall Street calls a Pac Man defense, an allusion to the
eat-or-be-eaten video game.
   GE had been rumored to be interested in joining a bid for GEC,
but the announcement of a deal between GE and GEC cooled that
speculation.
   However, American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. was expected to
confirm this week its participation in a consortium bid, the
Financial Times reported Monday. In the United States, AT&amp;T
spokesman Walter Murphy declined to comment.
   A Lazard Brothers official did not return a phone call from The
Associated Press. Lazard Brothers serves as adviser to Plessey,
which has declined comment on the consortium bid.
   GEC and Siemens' offer for Plessey, launched in November, is on
hold for three months following the British government's decision
Thursday to have the Monopolies and Mergers Commission examine its
effect on competition.
   The European Economic Community Commission also is examining the
offer.
   GE's arrangement with GEC fits a strategy followed by many
non-European companies, which are concerned that 1992 might see the
emergence of a ``Fortress Europe,'' shutting them out of the huge,
lucrative market.
   European companies also have scrambled to form pan-European
alliances.
   ``What it (GE) has done is significantly increase the size of its
business in Europe by this deal,'' said analyst Keith Sykes of the
London investment firm Smith New Court PLC. ``The prime reason is
1992.''
   He added: ``There are a number of other people who must be
feeling shut out of the market. I think there are quite a number of
people looking to position themselves. I think there's going to be
more of this.''
   However, electronics companies' efforts to expand their
businesses across borders will be hampered by governmernts' concerns
about national security and other matters, Sykes said.
   The electronics business has been largely domestic because the
companies usually do a big portion of their business with state
agencies, such as defense departments and state telecommunications
concerns, Sykes said.
   ``It's going to be really difficult but I think at least they are
going to have a go at it,'' he said.
   Analyst Chris Tucker of Kleinwort Grieveson Ltd. said the
takeover scramble has been spurred by overcrowding.
   ``There's been overcapacity in the U.K. industry and there is a
need for rationalization,'' he said.
   GE and GEC were founded independently a century ago and have
grown into the largest electronics companies in their own countries.
   GE, a minority stakeholder in GEC from 1928 until 1934, is much
larger, with annual revenue of $40.5 billion in 1987.
   GE said its European revenue, which totaled $2 billion in 1987,
should swell to an estimated $6 billion in 1989.
   It already has European interests in plastics, medical diagnostic
equipment, electrical distribution control and protection products,
and information services.
   GEC had revenue of $9.8 billion in the year ended March 31.

<HEAD>Corn, Soybean, Oat Futures Fall The Limit On Crop Report</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Prices for future deliveries of corn, oats and soybeans plunged
their permitted daily limits Monday on the Chicago Board of Trade
after a government report showed larger supplies of corn and
soybeans than most experts had expected.
   On other markets, livestock and meat futures declined; energy
futures surged; copper was sharply higher; precious metals were
mixed; and stock-index futures advanced.
   Wheat settled 10\ cents lower to 3 cents higher with the contract
for delivery in March at $4.30} a bushel; corn was 10 cents lower
across the board with March at $2.78\ a bushel; oats were 9 cents to
10 cents lower with March at $2.33 a bushel; and soybeans were 19
cents to 37 cents lower with January at $7.66} a bushel.
   The Chicago Board of Trade limits corn and oat futures to daily
moves of 10 cents a bushel, wheat to 20 cents a bushel and soybeans
to 30 cents a bushel. The limit on the January soybean contract has
been lifted pending the contract's pending expiration.
   Analysts said they had expected the sharp declines, especially in
the corn market, in reaction to an Agriculture Department crop
report released after the close of trading on Friday.
   The report's final 1988 U.S. corn production figure _ 4.92
billion bushels _ was nearly 6 percent higher than the average
pre-report estimate of market analysts and more than 5 percent above
the USDA's last projection, which it made in November.
   The USDA pegged the nation's corn stockpile as of Dec. 1 at 7.07
billion bushels, more than 6 percent higher than the average
pre-report estimate.
   The government's numbers for soybean production and soybean
stocks also were higher than expected.
   The USDA's wheat numbers were considered bullish but analysts
said the corn and soybean markets pulled down wheat prices for
near-month delivery.
   The sharp drop in prices may force some corn producers to
reconsider their strategies for the new growing season, said Cathy
Leow, a grain-market analyst with Thomson McKinnon Securities Inc.
in New York.
   She said corn's recent rise to levels near $2.80 a bushel may
have prompted some farmers to consider dropping out of the
government's price-support program, in which they agree to limit
their corn acreage in return for a guaranteed selling price.
   But now, she said, ``I think a lot of them will think twice about
dropping out of the program, given current price levels. It will
affect planting decisions but we don't know how much.''
   The soybean market came under additional pressure Monday from
reports of weekend showers in the South American soybean belt,
analysts said.
   Under exchange rules, the daily price limit for corn futures will
be expanded Tuesday to 15 cents a bushel, but analysts said they did
not expect a second session of limit losses.
   Most livestock and meat futures prices fell on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange on expectations of lower feed costs in the
future, analysts said. Sharply lower cash prices for hogs added to
the selling pressure.
   Live cattle settled .20 cent to .35 cent lower with February at
74.15 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent lower to .20 cent
higher with January at 84.80 cents a pound; live hogs were .52 cent
to .93 cent lower with February at 44.87 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .10 cent to .68 cent lower with February at 42.05 cents
a pound.
   Copper futures soared on New York's Commodity Exchange on reports
that repairs to an explosion-damaged flash furnace at the Chilean
Copper Corp.'s Chuquicamata mine could take two months.
   Chile is the world's largest copper exporter and the Chuquicamata
mine is the world's largest copper mine, accounting for more than
half of Chile's annual copper output, said Craig Sloane, an analyst
in New York with Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co.
   ``The market is balanced finely enough that if you can affect
production in Chile from this mine for a couple of months, that's
significant,'' he said.
   Copper settled 2.80 cents to 4.45 cents higher with March at
$1.4805 a pound.
   Gold settled 10 cents to 30 cents lower on the Commodity Exchange
with February at $403.30 a troy ounce; silver was unchanged to 0.2
cent higher with March at $5.957 a troy ounce.
   Energy futures surged on the New York Mercantile Exchange to
their highest levels since November 1987 on perceptions that the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries was succeeding in
reducing its crude-oil production, analysts said.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 4 cents to 40 cents
higher with February at $18.88 a barrel; heating oil was .21 cent to
.49 cent higher with February at 53.16 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .05 cent lower to .94 cent higher with February at
50.91 cents a gallon.
   Stock-index futures gained modestly on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, where the contract for March delivery of stocks
represented by the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index settled .40 point
higher at 286.70. Each point is worth $500.

<HEAD>Foreign Minister Calls Debt Interest Payments Unbearable for Latin
Nations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Brazil must lower its debt interest
payments to avoid potentially serious social and political unrest,
which could stimulate calls for another debt moratorium, a top
government official said Monday.
   Finance Minister Mailson da Nobrega called ``unbearable'' the
present situation of Brazil and other Latin debtors whose massive
foreign debt payments make them net exporters of capital.
   Last year, Brazil spent $12 billion in interest payments on the
$115 billion foreign debt.
   Da Nobrega said this year Brazil must import capital and recover
economic growth to ``avoid serious problems in the social and
political fields.''
   According to da Nobrega, the debt is not Brazil's principal
problem but it is ``the principal flag waved by populist
politicians,'' who could take advantage of this presidential
election year in Brazil to push for a moratorium on interest
payments.
   In the past, some politicians have argued the $1 billion monthly
payments takes money away from needed investments in domestic social
programs.
   ``If a populist reaches the government after an electoral
campaign based on threats to foriegn creditors, there will be a
moratorium on all payments and it will be of the worst kind,'' da
Nobrega told a news conference.
   Da Nobrega said the Brazilian government, which Sunday announed a
package of economic measures including a wage and price freeze and
massive spending cuts, ``had no intention of returning to its
previous confrontational approach of dealing with foreign
creditors.''
   However, he said should the country suffer a dip in money
reserves from the measures, which included a freeing of currency
exchange and import restrictions of certain products, Brazil could
''suspend payments in common accord with creditors.''
   Last year Brazil's current account trade surplus was a record $18
billion. Brazil takes its foreign debt payments from the monthly
surplus.
   In 1987, Brazil declared an 11-month moratorium on about $70
billion of its foreign debt with private creditors saying the
country was broke, with monthly trade surpluses as low as $131
million. In return, private banks cut the country's short term
credit lines and stalled rescheduling negotiations.
   But last year Brazil eased its hard-line stand, suspended the
moratorium and reached an agreement with banks to reschedule some
$64 billion in interest and principal due over 20 years with an
eight-year grace period. They also were to receive $5.2 billion in
new financing.

   The dollar strengthened against all key
currencies in quiet holiday trading Monday.
   Gold and silver prices fell, with silver dipping to its lowest
level in nearly 22 months in London.
   Bruce Giammattei, a currency trader for Harris Trust &amp; Co. in
Chicago, said near-term sentiment toward the dollar remained
somewhat bullish.
   ``I think there's a growing feeling in the market that the United
States doesn't really mind seeing a higher dollar at this time,''
Giammattei explained. ``A higher dollar helps take inflationary
pressure off of us by making imports cheaper.
   ``Right now the No. 1 goal in this country is to see that
inflation doesn't get out of hand.''
   Traders said the dollar also was boosted by reduced chances for
central-bank intervention from the United States and Japan due to
holidays there.
   Many U.S. traders were absent from the market Monday in
observance of the Rev. Martin Luther King's birthday, a federal
holiday. Government agencies and most banks were closed.
   In London, the British pound fell to $1.7615 late Monday from
$1.7770 Friday. Sterling fetched $1.7610 in New York, down from
$1.7660 on Friday.
   The dollar rose in London to 128.05 Japanese yen from 126.65 yen
Friday in Tokyo. Later, in New York, the dollar rose to 128.10 yen
from 127.30 yen.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Friday's late
rates, included: 1.8565 West German marks, up from 1.8445; 1.5845
Swiss francs, up from 1.5740; 1.19785 Canadian dollars, up from
1.19775; 6.3245 French francs, up from 6.2850; and 1,352.625 Italian
lire, up from 1,352.60.
   Late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Friday's rates,
included: 1.8575 West German marks, up from 1.8275; 1.5835 Swiss
francs, up from 1.5715; 6.3285 French francs, up from 6.2505; 2.0965
Dutch guilders, up from 2.0655; 1.1965 Canadian dollars, down from
1.1982; and 1,359.50 Italian lire, up from 1,346.50.
   Meanwhile, prices of precious metals sagged Monday.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, gold bullion for current
delivery fell to $402.20 a troy ounce from $402.30 Friday. Later,
Republic National Bank in New York quoted gold bullion at a bid of
$401.80 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EST, down from $402.30 late Friday.
   Gold fell to $401.75 a troy ounce in London and to $401.35 an
ounce in Zurich, down from $405.75 an ounce in both cities late
Friday. Earlier in Hong Kong, gold closed at $402.65 an ounce, down
from $403.13 Friday.
   Silver prices rose in New York after falling in London. On New
York's Comex, silver bullion for current delivery rose to $5.890 a
troy ounce from $5.888 Friday. In London, silver bullion fell to its
lowest level since March 26, 1987, trading at $5.89 a troy ounce,
down from $5.96 late Friday.

<TEXT>
   National Semiconductor Corp. announced
plans Monday to lay off about 2,000 workers, or 5 percent of its
worldwide workforce, to cope with sluggish business.
   The Silicon Valley chip maker also said it would take a charge
against earnings in the current quarter to cover costs of the
dismissals, but said it had not yet decided how big the charge would
be.
   The stock closed unchanged at $9 a share in consolidated New York
Stock Exchange trading.
   ``This step is necessary to staff our organization around the
needs of our fundamental semiconductor business and bring our costs
into alignment with our current and projected revenues,'' Charles
Sporck, the president and chief executive, said in a statement.
   In the latest fiscal quarter ended Nov. 28, National
Semiconductor had a loss of $25 million on revenue of $705 million,
a drop from profits of $11.6 million on revenue of $640 million in
the same period a year earlier.
   National Semiconductor, which makes a broad range of integrated
circuits, has been hurt worse than some other chip makers because of
its reliance on the sluggish personal computer market. It has been
selling off unrelated units in order to focus on its core business
of semiconductors.
   It has agreed to sell its Datachecker unit to ICL, a British
company, and is selling half of its mainframe computer marketing
subsidiary, National Advanced Systems, to Memorex Telex NV of the
Netherlands.
   Datachecker, with 2,000 employees, and National Advanced Systems,
with 2,200, are exempted from the layoffs because they are being
sold. All the cuts will come from the semiconductor business and
corporate staff.
   The layoffs will occur at all levels in Asia, Europe and the
United States, with about 50 percent of the cuts taking place in the
United States, spokeswoman Mary Coady said.
   Sporck said officials expect slow growth during the current
calendar year, but are optimistic the company will maintain its
growth and long-term health.
   Last August, it announced it would take an $18 million charge for
restructuring of its Information Systems Group and lay off about 450
people. At the time, National said its business was being hurt by
slow demand and pricing pressures.

   Andre Gillet, International Multifoods Corp.'s

officer since 1983. He led the company in adopting a new strategic
plan involving a move into higher-growth businesses such as food
service distribution and manufacturing.
   He will continue to serve on Multifoods' board of directors after
his July 1 retirement.
   ``The strategic objectives we established five years ago have
been largely attained,'' Gillet said in a statement.
   ``Today, the company's major businesses have been refocused, and
the restructuring of operations and management is essentially
complete. I feel this is a very appropriate time to transfer the
responsibility to the next generation of management to carry out our
strategies and further enhance our earnings capabilities,'' he said.
   Luiso, elected president and chief operating officer in July, has
been responsible for Multifoods' food service, Canadian and
Venezuelan businesses as well as corporate human resources. He was
elected to the board last August.
   Before joining Multifoods in 1987, Luiso was with Beatrice Cos.
for 15 years, serving in various executive positions including
director, corporate executive vice president and president of its $7
billion U.S. Foods Division.
   International Multifoods is a diversified food company that had
net sales of $1.7 billion last year.

<HEAD>ADM Buys 8 Percent Stake In Illinois Central</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>

   Grain processor Archer Daniels Midland Co. said
Monday it had purchased an 8 percent stake in Illinois Central
Transportation Co., a major rail hauler of grain between Chicago and
the Gulf of Mexico.
   ADM, based in Decatur, Ill., said the purchase was an investment,
not a takeover move, and industry analysts agreed.
   ``I think at this time they really are buying for investment
purposes,'' said analyst Leonard Teitlebaum of Merrill Lynch Capital
Markets Inc. in New York. ``I don't think they have any interest in
running the railroad.''
   Illinois Central spokesman Joseph Fidanza said he knew nothing
more about ADM's intentions than what ADM had told the railroad
company.
   ``They said to us that it's for investment purposes,'' he said.
   ADM spokesman Richard Burket said the company recently purchased
the nearly 1.6 million shares of Illinois Central at market prices,
which have ranged from $12.12{ on Jan. 3, the stock's first day of
trading on the New York Stock Exchange, to $14.12{.
   Illinois Central closed Monday in composite trading at $14, 12{
cents below Friday's close, making ADM's stake worth about $22.4
million.
   Chicago-based Illinois Central became an independent company late
last year when it was spun off from its parent, IC Industries Inc.
IC then changed its own name to Whitman Corp.
   The railroad benefited from last summer's drought, which lowered
the level of the Mississippi River and forced grain companies to
ship by rail instead of by barge.
   A recent study commissioned by Illinois Central found a trend
toward drier weather in the Mississippi River watershed, prompting
projections by the railroad for continued river-shipping problems.
   Burket said he didn't know if the railroad's predictions played a
part in ADM's decision to invest in Illinois Central.
   ``As you know, the company is just available now as a railroad,''
he said, referring to the spinoff. ``We took a look at it and
decided we'd make an investment.''
   He said the stock was part of ADM's $1.2 billion portfolio of
cash and securities.
   Analyst George S. Dahlman of Piper Jaffray &amp; Hopwood Inc. in
Minneapolis said he wouldn't be surprised to see an ADM
representative named to Illinois Central's board of directors.
   ``ADM is one of the major users of railways and so I think they
know a good one when they see one,'' he said. ``I would not be
surprised to see the investment go higher, but I'd be surprised if
they tendered for the whole thing.''

   China Eastern Airlines will buy five
McDonnell Douglas MD-11 jumbo jets for a total of $500 million, the
airplane maker announced.
   The planes, four of them set up to carry passengers and one to
carry freight, are scheduled for delivery between July 1990 and
1993, McDonnell Douglas Corp. announced Monday.
   The $500 million value placed on the transaction by the
manufacturer includes spare parts and training for the crews of the
airline, one of two which flies overseas from the People's Republic
of China.
   The MD-11, successor to the company's DC-10, is being assembled
at Douglas Aircraft Co. in Long Beach, a subsidiary of St.
Louis-based McDonnell Douglas. Deliveries of the 250 planes
presently on order are set to begin in 1990.

<HEAD>Report Says Two More Boeing 757s Found With Crossed Wires</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDS: LEADS throughout with Boeing comment; No pickup; Also moved

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two more Boeing 757 jetliners have been found with
crossed wires leading to cargo hold fire extinguisher bottles,
bringing the total to five since compulsory checks began Friday, The
Times of London reported Tuesday.
   The newspaper said checks by engineers in the Netherlands and
Canada revealed that two aircraft, both less than a year old, were
wrongly wired at the Boeing plant in Seattle in the United States
before delivery.
   Boeing spokesman Tom Cole in Seattle said such problems can take
place in the manufacture or in the maintenance of airplanes.
   ``We're aware of the Air Holland findings and this does make five
airplanes reported so far,'' Cole said Monday night. ``We are
looking into the technical aspects of it to see what the miswiring
was or is, how they relate to each other, and what might have
happened so we can correct it.''
   Britain's Civil Aviation Authority reported Sunday that engineers
of the British airline Air 2000 found crossed wires during checks of
cargo compartment warning systems following the discovery of wiring
problems in two Boeing 757s in the United States since compulsory
checks began.
   Faulty wiring is one possibility being examined by experts
investigating the British Midlands Boeing 737 crash at Kegworth in
central England on Jan. 7 in which 44 people were killed.
   But The Times said the faults involving wiring to the cargo hold
fire extinguisher bottles found on the five 757s are not thought to
have been a factor in the crash of the 737 on Jan. 7.
   In the Jan. 7 crash, for some reason so far unexplained, the
right-hand engine was shut down though it was the left-hand engine
that caught fire.
   The Times said the faults in each of these two new cases were
identical to the fault discovered on a Boeing 757 operated by Air
2000.
   The CAA said Sunday that the fault on the Air 2000 plane was
caused by switched plugs and was immediately rectified.
   The Times said Tuesday that the Air 2000 plane and the two latest
planes found to have crossed wires were delivered within days of
each other.
   It said Boeing executives are now trying to trace the fitter
responsible, though Cole on Monday said Boeing was not pointing the
finger at any one person.
   Cole confirmed that the last three planes reported with problems
were manufactured at about the same time, but the first two were not.
   The Times reported: ``A 757 belonging to Air Holland was found to
have its wires crossed in checks ordered by the FAA (the U.S.
Federal Aviation Administration) following two similar faults
reported (in the United States) on a Delta Airlines 757 and another
belonging to Royal Brunei Airlines. Although the faults were not
identical they all involved the wiring to fire extinguisher bottles
in the cargo hold.''
   It did not name the Canadian charter airline that owned the other
faultily wired aircraft.
   The paper said the findings indicated that someone in Boeing's
plant at Renton, Wash., where the 757s are manufactured made
repeated errors in fitting wiring.
   ``The assembly lines for the 737 _ the type involved in the
British Midlands crash _ run alongside the 757 lines and efforts are
now being made to ensure that similar mistakes were not made,'' the
paper said.
   Cole said: ``The Boeing Company will examine what's happened and
study the way the bottles are put in there. We'll see if something
can be done to make them less fallible.
   ``We do have a large number of checks and balances before we send
these out and that's why we want to study these'' reports, he added.
   Cole said Boeing didn't yet know whether the wiring problems were
identical, although all affect the cargo fire suppression system.
That system has nothing to do with engines, he said.
   An FAA directive that all American airlines check their 757s for
the problem is to conclude Tuesday afternoon, Cole said, at which
time it will be announced whether the problem is more widespread.
