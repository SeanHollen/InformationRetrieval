   What's a hot tub doing at the Farm Science
Review?
   ``The farmer likes hot tubs just as much as anyone does. We have
a tendency to think the farmer is not a normal person. But of course
he is,'' said Craig Fendrick, manager of the farm equipment
exposition at the Molly Caren Agricultural Center, 20 miles west of
Columbus.
   Organizers of the three-day event say the 600-plus demonstrations
and displays have changed over the years.
   ``We sat back and thought, `How come we can attract the farmer
but not his wife, his family, his neighbors?''' Fendrick said
Wednesday.
   So along with tractor demonstrations and free samples of
pesticide, the review offered tips on how to remove chocolate stains
from linen, manage personal finances, update a wardrobe with
inexpensive accessories and eat at Pizza Hut without gaining much
weight.
   Information also was available on owning a bed-and-breakfast inn
and breeding a pet llama.
   Ten or 15 years ago, the typical visitor at the review was white,
male, between 50 and 60 years old, wore overalls and attended the
event by himself.
   ``Today he's wearing designer jeans, his wife is with him, and
she's usually pushing the stroller,'' Fendrick said. ``A lot of them
out there are in their 30s.''

   Glasnost notwithstanding, there are still
some unknown details about Soviet leaders. Such as, how big is
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze's head?
   Wyoming officials wanted to know that before Shevardnadze's
scheduled arrival in Jackson Hole today for two days of talks with
Secretary of State James Baker. Officials from the Cowboy State
didn't want to cause an international embarrassment by presenting
the minister with an ill-fitting Stetson.
   ``We tried calling the Soviet Embassy in Washington. They said
it's just kind of average. We didn't really know what that meant,''
said Dennis Curran, spokesman for Gov. Mike Sullivan.
   So they rang up the State Department, counting on the
resourcefulness of the American intelligence network.
   It took two days of research to find an answer: 60 centimeters.
   ``We weren't quite sure what that meant,'' Curran said, adding
that officials think it corresponds to a size 7{.
   The cowboy hat is intended to help Shevardnadze fit in at a
western barbecue to be thrown by Baker on Saturday night at the end
of the two-day talks.

   Michigan House members returned from summer
break to temporary quarters in a former print shop and went to work
on folding chairs and cafeteria-style tables instead of their usual
stately chairs and desks.
   The House is being housed in an office building so its Capitol
chamber can be restored during the next few months.
   Low ceilings made the noise level louder than usual Wednesday,
and legislators practically had to step over each other in crowded
aisles. One lawmaker said he couldn't find a bathroom.
   ``This wouldn't pass the inspection for a dairy barn,'' Rep. Carl
Gnodtke said, ``but I guess it's good enough for legislators.''
   Despite the tight space and the noise, most lawmakers gave good
reviews to their temporary chamber.
   ``I was all set to come here and gripe, but I want to make sure
the right people get complimented,'' said Rep. Michael Griffin.
   House Speaker Lewis Dodak said he hoped members would start using
their phones to call each other on the floor to cut down on traffic
and noise.

<HEAD>Cambodians Fear More War After Vietnamese Withdrawal</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Also in Thursday AMs report. Vietnamese pullout set to be completed
by Sept. 26.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER ENG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At 6 a.m. one recent Thursday, Soun
Sundary, gentle and serene at 21, gave birth to her first child and
held her up to a Cambodia that has known only war for two decades.
   ``I don't know about the future, whether there will be peace or
not,'' she said as the sun shone into her hospital room after days
of monsoon rains.
   She and her husband, Soun Rithy, 25, have spent most of their
lives with their tragic nation in turmoil and mass deaths _ the
civil war of 1970-75, the fanatical communist Khmer Rouge rule of
1975-78 and the fighting since Vietnam invaded in late 1978.
   Seven members of their two families died in the murderous scourge
of the Khmer Rouge who defeated a pro-West government in 1975.
   The couple and their daughter are likely to see more killing in
the years ahead, even though the Vietnamese are pulling out.
   Rithy had come to Phnom Penh for the birth of his child but is
returning to southern Koh Kong province, where he has fought as a
government soldier for seven years against the Khmer Rouge and other
guerrillas.
   Peace talks in Paris have collapsed. Vietnam's pullout, due to be
completed Sept. 26, will leave the Vietnamese-installed Communist
government in Phnom Penh facing the guerrillas alone in what could
be the war's most chaotic and violent phase.
   ``We would like to have peace, really,'' Vice Premier Kong Sam-Ol
said in n interview. ``For almost 20 years, our people have known
more about killing and war than peace.''
   Most feared is the possibility that Vietnam's pullout will allow
the return of the Khmer Rouge, the black pajama-clad fighters who
killed hundreds of thousands of people in torture chambers and slave
labor camps after they took over in 1975.
   The government claims the army will have no problems handling the
guerrillas.
   Many others do not feel as confident.
   Some Phnom Penh residents have been stocking rice in case
supplies are cut off by escalating fighting, said Khieu Kanharith,
editor of the government-sponsored weekly Kampuchea.
   Some senior government officials have told Western aid workers
they are saving money in case they have to flee.
   ``They don't know what is going to happen after September if
there are problems with the Khmer Rouge,'' one aid worker said.
``They believe if there are problems, the first problems would be
for them.''
   At Kompong Chhnang, just north of Phnom Penh, Maj. Chhour
Chandoeun, the provincial military commander, said his nine
battalions are hard pressed in their fight against the 300 Khmer
Rouge guerrillas in the area.
   ``They don't stay in one place and we don't know all their hiding
places,'' he said.
   An aid official said the government's military draft appears to
be widening. A few months ago, some parents forbade their sons to
leave the house as overzealous recruiters yanked men off the
streets. Some youths flee to the border with Thailand, only to be
rounded up by the guerrillas for service.
   A 10 p.m.-5 a.m. curfew was lifted in April, but the climate of
war still pervades this riverside capital.
   In July, authorities closed dance halls that had been packed
nightly since they were permitted to open last year. Mayor Thong
Khong blamed drunken quarrels and said only the rich could visit
them anyway.
   ``At that time, there was increased fighting at the border and it
was difficult to justify the sacrifice at the border and the good
life in Phnom Penh,'' one foreign-aid official said.
   For many years, popular support for the Vietnamese-backed
government had stemmed mostly from its being the only alternative to
the Khmer Rouge. With Vietnam's pullout, Phnom Penh extended
economic reforms to include a freeing up of private trade in an
effort to raise primitive living conditions.
   Ironically, it created a new security problem by worsening
corruption among officials, and corruption was a factor that helped
the Khmer Rouge topple Lon Nol's pro-West government in 1975.
   The reforms reduced somewhat the gulf between the people and
their leaders But in addition to the fear of more war remains the
widespread fear of the authorities and ``the police,'' who are
thought to be everywhere.

   As though the constant shelling isn't enough,
residents of Beirut now face marauding bands of gunmen who loot
abandoned apartments or rob those huddling in bomb shelters. Here is
another in a series of periodic reports on life in Beirut.

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Long-suffering residents of this
beleaguered capital have braved six months of shelling and shortages
only to face a new terror _ bunker bandits.
   Bands of gunmen prowl the streets of Moslem west Beirut at night,
cleaning out apartments hit in the artillery battles between the
Syrians and Christian forces.
   They grab anything salvageable: Persian carpets, television sets,
video recorders, silverware.
   It's not unusual to hear the crackle of automatic weaponsfire at
night, as the marauders fire in the air to keep people away from the
scenes of their depredations.
   They also prey on civilians huddling in basement shelters during
the shelling because many people take their savings and jewelry with
them when they go underground.
   One gang of masked gunmen robbed six families in a bunker beneath
their apartment block in west Beirut's Aishe Bakkar neighborhood.
   ``I don't know how they managed to get in during the shelling,''
said one of the victims, Mohammed Abu-Samir, a middle-aged Sunni
Moslem taxi driver.
   ``They just ordered us to hand over our jewelry, money and
watches and we had to do as they said,'' he said. ``I don't know
which is the worst: getting robbed in our own shelter, or the
shelling.''
   The number of reported robberies has gone down in recent weeks
because about 1.3 million of Beirut's 1.5 million people have fled
to safer areas to escape the nightly barrages that have killed more
than 900 people and wounded nearly 2,800 since March 8.
   But the thousands of abandoned apartments make easy pickings.
Some residents now take pistols to their shelters to protect
themselves against the looters.
   Other indirect victims of the violence are hundreds of Sri Lankan
maids stranded in Beirut by fleeing employers who order them to
guard apartments and houses.
   ``I risk my life here during the shelling, looking after their
carpets and silverware while they're safe somewhere and having fun
in south Lebanon,'' said a bitter Kumari Hami, left to fend for
herself in an eighth floor apartment in Moslem west Beirut.
   ``I'd rather starve in my own country than be here,'' she said.
   Her countrywomen, along with Filipinas and women from other poor
Asian countries, came to Beirut hoping to make a decent living. Most
are paid $50 a month.
   She said most employers make sure the maids do not flee by taking
their passports. Unable to leave Lebanon, they're left alone and
frightened amid the daily artillery battles.
   Some are among the casualties, but police said they have no
specific figures.
   Fadi Sinno, who runs an office that hires Sri Lankans to work in
Lebanon, said about 2,000 women share Kumari's plight.
   ``Their employers leave them in Beirut because thieves usually
rob empty apartments,'' he said. ``The maids come to me crying, but
there's nothing we can do about it because they're bound by their
contracts.''
   The Philippines government has evacuated more than 200 Filipinas
who were stranded in Beirut, some complaining they had been forced
into prostitution.
   Many have been made destitute by the 14-year-old civil war that
has destroyed Lebanon's economy, but the latest round of fighting
has brought a boom for scrap metal merchants.
   In the Chatilla district of west Beirut, junkyard owners like
Mohammed Wehbi are out in the rubble-strewn streets every day in
their trucks as soon as there's a lull in the shelling.
   They scavenge among wrecked cars, shrapnel and bombed-out
apartments for battered metal household items.
   ``We only care about copper pieces of shrapnel,'' Wehbi said
during a recent sweep through west Beirut. ``Iron ones aren't worth
the trouble of collecting because they don't bring in much money.''
   He said when he sees a smoldering car, he usually looks for the
owner to buy it.
   ``The most I'll pay for such a car is 15,000 (Lebanese) pounds
($30),'' he said.
   But people in some neighborhoods said dealers usually just tow
the blackened, shrapnel-holed hulks away without bothering to ask
about ownership.
   Wehbi said that after the metal is compressed it is shipped to
Europe and some Arab countries through the southern ports of Sidon
and Tyre to be melted down and used to make household appliances and
ammunition.
   ``Iran takes copper for ammunition. Italy, West Germany and
Britain take brass for electrical appliances,'' he said.
   Pointing to a large shipping container, Wehbi said: ``That's more
than half full of empty beer cans. People are drinking more because
they're nervous and because there's no water. It's all good for
business.''

<HEAD>12-Year-Old Raises $587 for Bullet-Proof Vests for Police</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRISTOL, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police thanked a 12-year-old boy for
raising $587 to buy them two bulletproof vests.
   Seventh-grader Thomas Flores said he learned of the dangers
facing police officers when he read a magazine article describing
how a bulletproof vest saved an officer's life.
   He visited the police department, where he learned that the
department had only enough of the $300 vests for about a third of
its officers.
   So, he placed jars for contributions in stores, raising about
$300.
   Thomas, whose father is a doctor, then got more than $200 from
doctors at Bristol Hospital.
   City Council voted Monday to let the police department buy two
vests with the $587 he raised.
   ``He did it on his own,'' Lt. Thomas Killiany said Tuesday.
``We're very appreciative of the efforts of this youth.''
   It wasn't Flores' first contribution to the city. He has
volunteered to help senior citizens and with clients of the Bristol
Association for the Retarded _ and now he's looking for more
volunteer work.
   ``I'll find something,'' he said.

   A crew from CBS-TV's ``Rescue 911'' that
came to Fort Worth to film a burglary re-enactment got a first-hand
look at real crime.
   A $30,000 camera disappeared Monday night as the crew was
unloading equipment to shoot a segment about real-life emergencies.
   ``It's a sad fact for Fort Worth,'' said police Lt. Alvin Allcon.
``Here someone is filming a property crime and then they become a

   Investigators believe a passer-by simply walked away with the
camera that was left unattended on a sidewalk. They have no leads.
   Filming resumed Monday night after the crew got another camera.

<HEAD>Death Toll From Typhoon Rises to 162</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The death toll from a powerful typhoon that hit
China's east coast over the weekend has risen to 162, with 354
people still missing, an official newspaper reported today.
   The China Daily, quoting flood control officials in Zhejiang
province, said 692 people were injured and property losses from
Typhoon Vera were estimated at $350 million.
   The typhoon, the most powerful to hit the province in 27 years,
flooded 857,000 acres of farmland and washed out 40,000 acres of
crops.
   Earlier television newscasts showed toppled buildings, flattened
fields and workers rebuilding the shoreline with stones and sandbags.
   Zhejiang, located just south of Shanghai, was also hit by
torrential storms this July that killed 122 people and caused
economic losses of $405 million.
   ``These natural calamities have brought appalling losses to the
province's people and property as well as to its industrial and
agricultural base,'' the flood control headquarters said.
   Last year, summer storms in the disaster-prone province killed an
estimated 400.

<HEAD>World's Most Expensive Teddy Bear Bought As Anniversary Gift</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Sotheby's was surprised when a well-preserved,
67-year-old teddy bear sold for a record $86,000.
   So was the buyer.
   ``His first words were, `You're kidding','' Jack Wilson, who was
an intermediary in the deal, said Wednesday.
   However, Wilson said, his American friend was prepared to pay
even more and was delighted to bag the bear as a 42nd anniversary
present for his wife.
   Wilson refused to identify the buyer.
   The actual bidding was done by stockbroker James Fox, 26, of
Bristol, who was given a blank check and sent to Sotheby's in London
on Tuesday.
   ``I could tell from his voice he was ashen,'' Wilson said, ``and
he said ... the auction's just over and I've got the bear.'
   ``And I said `well done, James' and then he said `you'd better
sit down because I paid 50,000 (pounds).'
   ``And I said `You've done what?!'''
   Wilson said he waited a few hours before phoning his American
friend.
   ``I guess he might have figured on a third'' of that record
price, said Wilson, who is chairman of the House of Nisbet teddy
bear manufacturers in Weston-super-Mare in southwest England.
   ``He's is very pleased. He was determined to have it.''
   The buyer and his wife are avid teddy-bear collectors, Wilson
said, and both happen to be as old as the record-breaking bear.
   The price is nearly five times the previous highest price for a
teddy bear and 61 times its catalogue estimate, said Bunny Campione,
a valuer for Sotheby's.
   Wilson said his firm would like to do a replica of the bear.
``It's up to my friend, although it seems like we have the inside
track,'' he said.
   The previous highest auction price for a teddy bear was $19,000
paid at a Christie's auction in London on May 18 for a Steiff bear
made between 1906 and 1909 for Princess Xenia, a cousin of Czar
Nicholas II.
   Several bidders stayed in the race until the price reached
$38,000, Wilson said.
   ``The other bidder after 24,000 pounds ($38,000) was a telephone
bidder and the general impression was that the caller was from
Tokyo,'' Wilson said.
   ``Bears are an art form like paintings,'' Wilson said. ``People
are used to hearing about crazy figures like $400 million for
paintings and this is the same kind of price inflation. It is a very
rare bear.''
   The German-made teddy, Edward T. is thought to date from 1927.
The bear is 24 inches long, has dual-plush fur in blond and brown,
amber and black glass eyes measuring about 1 inch in diameter,
swivel joints, a humped back and widely spaced pricked ears.
   It is believed that it was part of a batch of a few thousand, but
Mrs. Campione said the bear was in unusually good condition.
   Before going to America, the bear will on display at the National
Teddy Bear Museum in Stratford-upon-Avon this weekend.

<HEAD>Mixed Reviews Follow ``Miss Saigon'' Ovation</HEAD>
<HEAD>By MATT WOLF</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The new show ``Miss Saigon'' received a rapturous
ovation at the Theater Royal, Drury Lane, followed by decidedly
mixed early reviews for the first major musical set mostly in
Vietnam.
   ``For all its frenzied breast-beating, this is a show with about
as much heart as the Tin Man in `The Wizard of Oz,''' Charles
Osborne in The Daily Telegraph wrote of the musical, which updates
the tragic tale of Puccini's ``Madame Butterfly'' opera to the
Vietnam War.
   Lea Salonga, an 18-year-old Filipino making her acting debut in
the West, and Welsh actor Jonathan Pryce star as a young Vietnamese
girl, Kim, and her cynical pimp, The Engineer.
   Both yearn for the United States _ she to escape her war-torn
country, he to exploit what he refers to sardonically in a
second-act showstopper as ``the American dream.''
   Simon Bowman plays the American GI who weds Kim in 1975 prior to
the fall of Saigon only to leave her for a new life, and a new
American bride. The story reaches its fatal climax in Bangkok in
1978, with the implication that innocence, as embodied by Kim,
cannot be reclaimed.
   Salonga and Pryce both received cheers from the black-tie
audience Wednesday night that gave ``Miss Saigon'' an eight-minute
standing ovation.
   But alongside the applause came concerns about the hype, with
some wondering whether this wasn't another in a series of
effects-heavy, overhyped British productions that substitute
impressive mechanics for meaningful emotion.
   Said The Daily Telegraph's Osborne: ``It gives the impression of
having been cynically concocted _ with lavish high-tech decor as the
most important ingredient _ merely to fill theater seats.''
   Lester Middlehurst in Today newspaper wrote: ``There's more to a
musical than the (money) it cost Cameron Mackintosh to create such
stunts as landing helicopters on stage and building giant statues of
Ho Chi Minh... ''
   Both these staging coups received extensive advance publicity in
the British press and elicited more applause than most of the
musical numbers.
   Problems installing the 22-foot statue of Ho Chi Minh, reported
to weigh almost two tons, had led to the cancellation of the first
two previews Sept. 4 and 5. But the opening night proceeded without
technical difficulty.
   Budgeted at $4.65 million, ``Miss Saigon'' will most likely
withstand any critical slights. Its advance sale to date is almost
$8 million, and a Broadway opening is tentatively scheduled for late
autumn, 1990, with director Nicholas Hytner repeating his London
assignment.
   ``Miss Saigon'' marks another commercial hit for millionaire
producer Mackintosh, whose shows, besides ``Les Miserables,''
include ``Cats'' and ``The Phantom of the Opera,'' two
internationally successful Andrew Lloyd Webber musicals.
   But the producer said in a pre-opening interview that he is
forsaking mega-musicals for a while to turn his attention to Alan
Parker's upcoming film version of ``Les Miserables.''

   An Alaska Air National Guard tanker
aircraft exploded and burned Wednesday at Eielson Air Force Base,
killing two people, Air Force officials said.
   Five people aboard the KC-135 tanker were treated for minor
injuries, along with two base firefighters, said Sgt. Gene LaDoucer.
The aircraft was destroyed.
   The plane apparently was taxiing to park when the explosion
occurred at about 3 p.m. LaDoucer said the Eielson public affairs
office was notified at 5 p.m. that the fire was out.
   Five of the seven people aboard were crew members, and the other
two were military passengers, he said. Names were withheld until
relatives could be notified.
   LaDoucer said an Air Force board will investigate the cause of
the crash and probably will release findings in several months.
   The aircraft was part of the 168th Air Refueling Squadron at
Eielson.

<HEAD>Gathering of Intellectuals Searches for `Metaphor for Our Times'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   It was billed as a gathering of world-renowned
intellectuals tackling the loftiest of subjects and perhaps coming
up with a metaphor for our times.
   But while participants in the modestly named Conversazioni on
Culture and Society considered changes in the Soviet Bloc, the
influence of religion in world events and cultural illiteracy, the
larger assignment proved elusive.
   ``Everybody was satisfied but no final metaphor, alas, emerged,''
said Bernard Levin, chief columnist for The Times of London.
   In an introduction to the conference, Claudio Veliz, a conference
host, noted such past ``eloquent and economical'' tags as ``Roaring
20s,'' ``Neo-Gothic,'' and even ``Cold War,'' but lamented that
``today we are encumbered with `post-industrial' and `post-modern,'
usages as illuminating as `post-life' is for death or `post-oats'
for porridge.''
   Levin, one of many academics, historians and others who joined a
debate of world issues, did not seem defeated by the group's failure
to write a tag line for the closing years of the 20th century.
   ``The whole idea is that we thrash out these things,'' he said.
   The third annual conference, held this year at Boston University,
brought together such thinkers as former presidential advisor Arthur
Schlesinger Jr., Cambridge University professor Ernest Gellner and
noted French historian Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie to work on ``A
Metaphor for Our Times.''
   The conference invited about 60 top thinkers.
   Several papers were presented Sunday and positions taken on the
best name for the present era. During dinner discussion groups and
public presentations, the participants defended and attacked each
others reasoning. The papers were revised and a final session was
held Tuesday night.
   ``I don't think the idea of the metaphor was ... built into the
idea. It was just a way of saying, `What do we think of our
condition?''' Levin said.
   Levin pointed in his presentation to the drug epidemic, the
collapse of form in the arts and ``the old certainties vanishing and
nothing being put in their place'' to coin ``The Age of Disorder.''
   The points he raised provoked considerable discussion and, he
said, a degree of accord, particularly his position that cultural
literacy would someday return.
   `I had said that our time is the only one that would in fact try
to define itself,'' he added. ``Obviously any era, the `Dark Ages,'
the `Age of Enlightenment,' is not called that when it happens.
We're the first age to try and define itself right now, rather than
waiting for history.''
   American economist Walt Rostow talked of the European Community's
plans for dropping border restrictions in 1992 and offered ``The Age
of Regionalism.''
   Schlesinger gave an overview of how the world became what it is,
while Ladurie's presentation was non-political and more abstract,
dealing with the ``nature of the world,'' Levin said.
   Veliz, a professor at La Trobe University in Melbourne,
Australia, focused on the domination of the English language and
English culture throughout the wolrd. He noted how soccer, or
English football, is played throughout the world.
   He also displayed a group photograph in which Iran's late leader
Ayatollah Khomeni and his fellow ayotollahs wore jogging shoes.
   Keith Botsford, American correspondent for the Independent in
London, said one series of discussions focused on the fact that 15
years ago no one would have predicted that religion would affect
politics in Poland, or that Islam and fundamentalism would dominate
headlines.
   ``Religion came in a startling second to the Soviet Union and
really was talked about a great deal,'' he said.

<HEAD>House Panel Defeats Emission Averaging Proposal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A ``very upset'' auto industry predicts many
more recalls will result from the swift collapse of a Bush
administration plan to let carmakers meet pollution targets by
averaging vehicle emissions.
   A House subcommittee removed the averaging plan from the
president's clean air bill Wednesday, in a unanimous voice vote that
shocked a standing-room crowd that expected a closely divided tally.
   The vote means the Bush bill would require each car sold in this
country to pass anti-pollution requirements for hydrocarbons, carbon
monoxide and nitrogen oxide. Current law has the car-by-car
requirement, but the Bush plan would make the standards tougher to
meet.
   Tim MacCarthy, of the auto industry's Motor Vehicle Manufacturers
Association, said the new standards would be too tough for each car
to meet after they're driven for several years.
   The industry _ and Bush _ wanted to allow some engine classes to
flunk the requirements, while other classes would meet them with
room to spare, resulting in an overall pollution reduction after the
emissions were averaged.
   MacCarthy predicted that once an engine class began regularly
failing emissions tests, the Environmental Protection Agency would
order massive recalls for repairs.
   Subcommittee Chairman Henry A. Waxman, D-Calif., the chief
proponent of eliminating averaging, said the concept would simply
allow more dirty cars on the road. ``Averaging provisions would
cause more pollution,'' he said, because emissions from cars failing
to meet the standards would not offset the gains from autos
bettering the requirements.
   The subcommittee vote had a bizarre quality, because the two
chief sponsors of the Bush measure _ Rep. John D. Dingell, D-Mich.
and Norman F. Lent, R-N.Y. _ vigorously defended averaging at the
outset of debate.
   But as one subcommittee member after another argued averaging was
a bad idea misunderstood by the public, the defense stopped.
   The voice vote was taken with only ``ayes'' heard, and nobody
sought a roll call to record individual members.
   Rep. Terry Bruce, D-Ill., sponsor of the anti-averaging
amendment, said it may be possible to work out a modified averaging
proposal later. But MacCarthy said the averaging idea ``suffered a
mortal wound.''
   ``We are very upset by the removal of the averaging provision,''
MacCarthy said. ``It takes away our flexibility to deal with some
very severe requirements in the bill.''
   After the vote, Dingell, the powerful chairman of the full Energy
and Commerce Committee who moments earlier defended averaging, told
reporters that it ``appears existing law is working satisfactorily''
without averaging, and that if the administration wanted the concept
it could impose it without legislation.
   Asked why averaging was needed, he said, ``I did not advocate
that particular point of view.''
   William Rosenberg, EPA's assistant administrator for air
programs, said the averaging idea was devised in the White House and
not by Dingell. But Rosenberg said he had no indication that Dingell
had any reservations.
   ``We didn't give any signals'' that the administration was
willing to drop averaging, he added. ``I was surprised. I did not
expect this would happen.''
   Current law requires auto and light truck exhausts to meet a
standard of 0.41 gram per mile for hydrocarbons such as unburned
fuel, 1 gram per mile for nitrogen oxides and 3.4 grams for carbon
monoxide. Cars sold in California must meet even tougher standards.
   The Bush legislation would make the 49-state standards 0.25 gram
per mile for hydrocarbons, 0.7 gram for nitrogen oxides and leave
carbon monoxide unchanged at 3.4 grams.
   Today's exhaust limits represent reductions of 96 percent in
hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide and 75 percent in nitrogen oxides
from the uncontrolled cars of the 1960s and earlier. But
environmentalists note that cars are still the main contributor to
urban smog and argue that they account for 50 percent of cancer
deaths due to toxic emissions.

<HEAD>Frank Won't Resign Pending Ethics Investigation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rep. Barney Frank says it would be ``a great
mistake'' and ``cowardly'' to resign in the midst of a scandal over
his involvement with a male prostitute.
   The Massachusetts Democrat broke two days of public silence on
his case Wednesday to declare his resolve to ride out the scandal,
at least until the House ethics committee completes its inquiry into
the case.
   He disputed reports that Democratic Party and congressional
leaders were urging him to step aside in order to save them further
embarrassment and risk partisan damage.
   ``I haven't been asked by anybody to resign,'' Frank said. ``No
one has been urging me to resign.''
   A leading ally of Frank, meanwhile, backed off plans to draft and
circulate for the signature of Democratic colleagues a statement
supporting Frank's desire to stay in office through the ethics probe.
   Rep. Joe Moakley, D-Mass., dean of Frank's home-state House
delegation, had planned such a statement. But his press secretary,
Jim McGovern, said Moakley decided press attention has been so
negative for Frank that it was ``better to do nothing.''
   ``He's not running away from Barney,'' McGovern said.
   Frank, a five-term House member and leading liberal in Congress,
is an acknowledged homosexual who has come under scrutiny since
admitting last month that he had an 18-month relationship with male
prostitute Stephen L. Gobie.
   Frank admitted paying Gobie for sex, then hiring him as a driver
and personal assistant.
   Gobie, who went public with his allegations last month, contended
that he operated a prostitution ring out of Frank's Capitol Hill
apartment with Frank's knowledge. Frank denied knowing of such
activity and said he threw Gobie out when he learned of it.
   Frank asked for the ethics committee review, heading off a
certain request by opponents.
   ``I think that resignation would be a great mistake,'' Frank
said. ``It would cut off the ethics committee process, and I think
that would be a cowardly and inappropriate way to proceed.
   ``There are things that I did that I should not have done, that
I've apologized for, and I will submit to the judgment of the ethics
committee,'' he said. ``There are other things that I've been
accused of that I haven't done that I want to be able to rebut, and
the ethics committee is the place to do that.''
   Frank also responded to a partisan attack leveled by House
Republican Leader Rep. Robert Michel of Illinois, who suggested that
Frank was benefiting from a double standard that judged him less
harshly, either because he was a liberal or because the allegations
involved activity with another man rather than a woman.
   ``I don't think it's fair to suggest the ethics committee of the
House would be imposing a double standard. They've been very tough
in the past. So I think that's just an inaccurate accusation,''
Frank said.
   Over the weekend The Boston Globe, long an editorial supporter of
Frank, called on him to resign. Democratic National Chairman Ronald
Brown on Tuesday acknowledged that ``pressure is building'' for
Frank's resignation but said the ethics investigation should go
forward.
   Asked if he was hurting the party, Frank responded: ``At this
point I think it's important to have the ethics process go forward.
Then, people can make judgments after that.''

<TEXT>
   With a commander waving flowers in the
lead, Vietnam on Thursday began a pledged final withdrawal from an
11-year war against guerrillas it couldn't eradicate despite
superior firepower.
   Vehicles carrying thousands of soldiers bearing rifles rumbled
out of this northwestern province after a band played pop music and
thousands of Cambodians threw the troops flowers and flags in a
government-organized ceremony.
   Vietnam says it is conducting a six-day withdrawal of its last
26,000 troops from Siem Reap and several otehr areas of the country.
   But guerrillas charged that Vietnam was faking the troop movement
and actually hiding and disguising its troops.
   Vietnam invaded Cambodia on Christmas Day 1978 and within two
weeks toppled the fanatical Khmer Rouge regime, a former Communist
comrade that had launched bloody attacks on the Vietnamese border.
   During its four-year rule, the Pol Pot-led Khmer Rouge killed
hundreds of thousands of Cambodians as it tried to turn Cambodia
into an agrarian commune.
   At the height of its conflict with Cambodian guerrillas, Vietnam
had 200,000 men in the country, according to Vietnamese officers.
They say it began annual partial pullouts in 1982 and that 55,300
Vietnamese died fighting the Cambodians, including 25,000 in 1977-78.
   The invasion also brought economic blockades by non-Communist
countries that kept Vietnam one of the world's poorest counties.
   With the collapse of peace talks in Paris last month, the pullout
would leave the Vietnamese-installed Phnom Penh government fighting
three guerrilla groups backed by China, Thailand and other countries.
   Maj. Gen. Huol Savorn, commander of Cambodia's 4th Army Region,
said he expected a major guerrilla offensive after the pullout of
the some 10,000 soldiers of ``Front 479'' from Siem Reap, Battambang
and Oddar Meanchey provinces. These are among Thai border provinces
the guerrillas have been strongly contesting for years.
   ``They are going to fight a lot'' to try to occupy border areas
before striking inland, he told reporters.
   ``But they will not be able to achieve this,'' he said ``With the
equipment that they have, they can only carry out hit-and-run
attacks.''
   The Paris talks failed to agree on international monitoring of
the troop movement, and the only official foreign observers seen in
Siem Reap were from Vietnam and its close allies Laos, Cuba and the
Soviet Union, the main source of arms for the war.
   Of the absence of Western observers, Soviet delegate and Foreign
Ministry official Genrich Kinreed said ``it was astonishing why they
insisted (on international monitoring) but didn't come.'' His
four-member team was led by Suleimenov Oljas, member of the Supreme
Soviet, or parliament.
   About 50 journalists from non-Communist countries watched the
troop movement.
   The Cambodians bade the soldiers farewell in a two-hour ceremony
on the rain-soaked gravel road outside a kindergarten built by
Vietnamese soldiers.
   Banners expressing sadness at the troops' departure and hopes for
continued Vietnamese-Cambodian ``solidarity'' were raised by groups
of students, soldiers, and schoolchildren wearing red kerchiefs _
the ``young pioneers'' of the ruling Cambodian Communist Party. They
sweated under a hot sun that charged in just after a morning mist
lifted.
   On a wooden stage with the military officers, four Buddhist monks
in flowing saffron robes chanted prayers for peace.
   Cambodian and Vietnamese officials took turns with speeches that
denounced the ``Pol Pot genocide'' and defiantly claimed the
guerrillas cannot take any territory.
   Maj. Gen. Khieu Anh Lon, commander of Front 479, hugged a
Cambodian commander in front of a blue banner displaying the
national emblems of Vietnam's yellow star and Cambodia's Angkor Wat
temple.
   A young pioneer gave him her kerchief while three women in
traditional costumes presented a bouquet of flowers.
   The general walked down the muddied road, picked up a young boy,
and climbed into his weather-beaten U.S.-made jeep to begin the
withdrawal.
   The Vietnamese troops, whose intervention triggered fighting that
killed tens of thousands of people and split almost all Asia into
two hostile camps, waved yellow and purple flowers as they
disappeared down the road.

<HEAD>Unusual Protein in Skin May Help in Alzheimer's Diagnosis and Treatment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A protein found in the brain of Alzheimer's
patients has been located elsewhere in their bodies, and that may
lead to better diagnosis and treatment of the disease that afflicts
2{ million Americans.
   The protein deposits appear in several tissues, including the
skin and intestines, indicating they may come from an unknown
substance that circulates in the blood, said Dennis Selkoe,
co-director of the Center for Neurologic Diseases at Brigham and
Women's Hospital in Boston.
   If so, finding ways to block delivery to the brain may help in
fighting Alzheimer's disease, he reported today.
   But he said it is too early to know if such an approach would be
useful. And another scientist said the research provides only
suggestive evidence for the idea that the protein deposits come from
a blood-borne source.
   David Drachman, chairman of the medical and scientific advisory
board of the Alzheimer's Association, also said it is unproven that
the protein's appearance in the brain plays any role in causing
Alzheimer's.
   Nonetheless, he called the study ``a very important advance'' in
knowledge about the protein, which is called amyloid.
   Selkoe, who is also associate professor of neurology at Harvard
Medical School, reported the findings in the British journal Nature
with colleagues Catharine Joachim and Hiroshi Mori.
   Even if no circulating substance is involved in the protein
deposits, the work suggests that doctors may one day be able to
confirm an Alzheimer's disease diagnosis by taking skin samples,
Selkoe said in an interview.
   Drachman said data from the study suggest such a test would be
unreliable, but that perhaps the accuracy can be improved.
   Alzheimer's disease attacks the brain and produces progressive
impairment in memory, thinking and behavior. It kills more than
100,000 Americans a year. No cause or cure is known.
   Doctors now have no standard biological test to confirm the
diagnosis in a living patient. They can only rule out other possible
causes, including treatable ones, for suggestive symptoms.
   A standard feature in the brain of Alzheimer's victims is a large
number of spherical neuritic plaques, composed partly of the amyloid
protein.
   Scientists do not know whether the plaques cause the disease or
simply result from it.
   Brains of Alzheimer patients also contain deposits of amyloid
alone, which is what the new study found in other tissues, Selkoe
said.
   Eight of 11 Alzheimer patients showed patchy amyloid deposits in
the skin, subcutaneous tissue or intestines, with suggestive
evidence of such deposits in two others.
   Three of 26 people without Alzheimer's showed the deposits, with
two showing equivocal evidence.
   The three with deposits were at least 77 years old. Selkoe noted
that elderly people without Alzheimer's also can have plaques in the
brain, although they have fewer plaques than Alzheimer patients.
   The findings imply that the amyloid deposits either are created
independently at multiple sites in the body or derived from some
substance that circulates in the blood, he said.
   Selkoe said he favors the latter idea. Other kinds of amyloid
come from such a circulating precursor, and some newly found
deposits were in or near blood vessel walls, much as they can appear
in the brain, he said.
   Nobody has yet identified a circulating substance that can be
demonstrated to give rise to the form of amyloid linked to
Alzheimer's, Selkoe said.
   He also said further study is planned to see if skin sampling
might be useful to confirm a diagnosis of the disease.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration is supporting efforts
to retain catastrophic medical insurance for retirees amid growing
indications that Congress may bow to pressure to repeal the program.
   ``Catastrophic meets a very real need in protecting senior
citizens against financial ruin'' as a result of an illness,
Secretary of Health and Human Services Louis Sullivan told the
Senate Finance Committee. Although some adjustments may be needed,
he added, ``repeal would be a big mistake.''
   But leaders of the House and Senate acknowledged Wednesday the
number of lawmakers who will vote to repeal the program outright is
growing. Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, an author of the program and
chairman of the Finance Committee, said the House probably will vote
for repeal.
   Democratic leaders of the House agreed to allow a repeal vote
next week when the House considers a Ways and Means Committee plan
for keeping catastrophic care but scaling the program back.
   The program, the largest expansion ever of Medicare, is under
attack from two groups of retirees: those who already are covered by
a catastrophic plan, including federal retirees; and higher-income
older Americans who object to paying for coverage for those at the
bottom of the economic ladder.
   Sullivan said that although the administration prefers no changes
in the program, it would support a modification backed by Senate
leaders of both parties.
   That proposal would eliminate coverage for most prescription
drugs; scale back coverage of physicians' fees, and reduce the
surtax on higher-income retirees that pays for most of the program.
   ``We want to do everything we can to preserve the core benefits''
in the program, Sullivan told the committee.
   Sen. John C. Danforth, R-Mo., said Congress should repeal the
program and consider a replacement as part of an overall national
health strategy.
   Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J., said any discussion of repeal should
include recognition that ``people's lives are at stake.'' Repeal, he
said, would amount to ``denying somebody the right to get an
operation in a hospital and allow them to live ... without going
bankrupt.''

   Transportation officials believe new security
rules brought on by the explosion that destroyed a Pan American
airliner over Lockerbie, Scotland, make flying U.S. carriers in
Europe and the Middle East as safe as possible.
   ``Nothing is 100 percent, but we try,'' said Fred Farrar, a
spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration, which ordered
security procedures tightened after the Dec. 21, 1988 bomb blast
that killed 270.
   ``The airlines are doing a lot,'' said Tim Neale, a spokesman for
the Air Transport Association, an industry group. ``We spend a half
billion dollars a year on security.''
   The new rules imposed by the FAA since the Pan Am 103 explosion
include a requirement that U.S. airlines operating in Europe and the
Middle East X-ray or physically search all checked luggage. A
certain percentage of the luggage is searched by hand.
   The new FAA regulations apply only to U.S. carriers.
   Air carriers operating in and out of 40 high-risk airports are
required to make ``a positive passenger-baggage match,'' designed to
ensure that no piece of luggage gets on an airplane unless the
passenger who checked it is also aboard.
   And the installation of automatic devices for detecting
explosives in checked luggage has begun, with the first installed at
New York City's John F. Kennedy International Airport. The Thermal
Neutron Analysis Machine costs $750,000 to $1 million.
   ``We have issued a rule requiring airlines to provide devices
like this and have them installed in 40 airports here and abroad
within 1{ years,'' Farrar said.
   Asked whether the explosive-sniffer could have detected the bomb
hidden in a radio-cassette player which blew the Boeing 747 airliner
apart, Farrar said: ``We are confident it could have caught it.''
   ATA's Neale was not so sure.
   ``It's hard to say,'' he said. ``We still don't know for sure
exactly what happened there. It's like a moving target, you are
constantly readjusting.''
   Airline security originally was designed to counter hijackings of
planes, mainly to Cuba.
   ``Now, it's an entirely different threat, it's more sabotage than
hijacking,'' said Neale. ``Defenses have to be changed and the new
requirements are intended to do that.''
   There is no single answer to terrorism, he said. ``The idea is to
set up a new series of roadblocks.''
   U.S. airlines are frustrated, he said, because there is a
perception among the traveling public that flying a foreign carrier
is safer.
   But, he said, ``the U.S. carriers are the only ones physically
inspecting and X-raying all checked luggage now.'' Overseas
airlines, he said, use the ``profile'' system in which added
attention is paid to a passenger who has behavior patterns or
matches statistical data characteristic of hijackers.

   Richard Ramirez cooly flashed a sign of the
devil and muttered the word ``evil'' after jurors convicted him of
all 13 murders and 30 other felonies in the 1985 satanism-tinged
``Night Stalker'' rampage.
   The glum, shaggy-haired drifter refused to stay in the courtroom
when jurors returned their verdicts Wednesday after 22 days of
deliberations.
   The jury found that Ramirez was the devil-worshiping ``Night
Stalker'' who left satanic symbols at some murder scenes and forced
terrified victims to ``swear to Satan'' as they suffered unspeakable
assaults.
   Husbands were murdered in their beds and wives were raped beside
the dead bodies. One victim's eyes were gouged out.
   The verdicts came four years after the killings terrified many
Californians and more than a year after the trial began. When
Ramirez was caught, it was by angry residents who ran him down and
beat him.
   Ramirez, of El Paso, Texas, listened to the verdicts on a speaker
in a nearby cell.
   As he was taken from the courthouse while wearing sunglasses,
Ramirez flashed photographers a ``devil sign,'' extending his index
and little finger.
   Asked what he thought about the verdicts, the 29-year-old Ramirez
said only:
   ``Evil.''
   The trial's finale came despite a juror's slaying, which had
threatened to halt the case during deliberations.
   In a silent courtroom, Superior Court Judge Michael Tynan and
clerk Josephine Williams spent more than a half hour reading the
jury's thick book of verdicts. The word ``guilty'' echoed again and
again.
   Ramirez was convicted of all charges, including rape, sodomy,
oral copulation, burglary and attempted murder. In addition, the
jurors found 18 special circumstances existed, making it possible to
impose the death penalty.
   In one of the murders, the panel reduced a charge of first-degree
murder to second degree, a decision the prosecutor praised as
``sophisticated.'' The victim in that murder, Tsai-Lian Yu, was
dragged from her car on a street and shot to death, indicating a
lack of premeditation.
   Ramirez still faces an attempted murder charge in Orange County
and a murder charge in San Francisco. His status in those cases will
be decided after sentencing in the Los Angeles case.
   Tynan scheduled the penalty phase of the trial to begin Sept. 27.
The same jury will decide the sentence. The judge forbade the jurors
from talking about the case.
   ``We're going to try to save his life,'' defense attorney Ray
Clark said of the penalty proceeding. ``We will try to convince the
jury that he should not be executed.''
   The defense had argued Ramirez was a victim of mistaken identity,
that the victims were too traumatized to remember their assailant's
face.
   Clark characterized Ramirez' reaction to the verdicts as ``kind
of stoic.''
   Clark said he would appeal, citing the juror's slaying as one
reason for overturning the conviction.
   On Aug. 14, juror Phyllis Singletary was found beaten and shot to
death. Her live-in boyfriend confessed to the killing in a note
written before he committed suicide.
   The slaying was not related to the case, but defense lawyers
unsuccessfully asked for a mistrial, arguing that the killing had
made the other jurors prejudiced against Ramirez.
   Relatives of three ``Night Stalker'' victims were in the packed
courtroom and listened somberly to the verdicts.
   Outside court, Deputy District Attorney P. Philip Halpin said,
``I'm satisfied that certainly the jury considered the evidence very
carefully and rendered appropriate verdicts.''
   But he added, ``I'm not going to be relieved until its over, and
it's not over yet.''
   He said he would urge jurors to impose the death penalty.
   Clark conceded that the most powerful evidence against Ramirez
came from attack survivors who wept and sometimes shouted at the
defendant as they recalled their ghastly ordeals from the witness
stand.
   ``You son of a bitch, why did you kill him?'' cried one woman who
witnessed her husband's slaughter. ``I gave you everything you
wanted. ... What's wrong with you? ... He was such a nice man.''
   Through it all, Ramirez sat slumped in a chair, occasionally
smirking and once laughing as a foreign-born witness struggled to
describe her rape.

<HEAD>Federal Crop Insurance Most Equitable Way to Aid Farmers, Report
Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal crop insurance program needs
improvements, but it is a better way to provide disaster aid to
farmers than emergency loans and direct payments, a congressional
report says.
   And a government commission says some changes could be made
immediately in the crop insurance program to boost farmer
participation beyond the current 25 percent.
   The program needs to be simplified and made more responsive, and
the administration could be improved, Ray Davis and Bill Classen,
co-chairmen of the Commission for the Improvement of the Federal
Crop Insurance Program, told a House subcommittee on Wednesday.
   A General Accounting Office report said the federal government
spent $17.6 billion between 1980 and 1988 assisting farmers who lost
crops because of drought or other natural causes.
   About $6.9 billion of that was direct assistance, $6.4 billion
came through emergency loan programs and $4.3 billion was spent to
subsidize crop insurance.
   However, the GAO said the crop insurance program is a more
equitable and efficient way to provide aid to farmers.
   The GAO said its investigation showed that most farmers don't buy
crop insurance because they are used to having Congress come to the
rescue with special assistance whenever there is a major crisis.
   For example, $4 billion in direct payments were made in 1988 by
emergency act of Congress because of the severe drought, said the
GAO.
   Rep. Glenn English, D-Okla., who chairs the subcommittee on
conservation, credit and rural development, said 65 percent to 70
percent participation in the crop insurance program is needed to
make it work.
   ``We cannot continue to do this,'' English said, referring to
Congress' ad hoc approach to agricultural disasters. ``The costs are
too high.''
   John Harman, of the GAO, said that in examining disaster
assistance programs, his agency found that direct payments or
emergency loans can result in different treatment for similarly
affected disaster victims.
   ``In contrast, the terms of compensation under crop insurance are
determined before a disaster occurs and therefore, crop insurance
provides farmers equitable assistance more consistently,'' he said.
   The GAO also found that crop insurance, because it is
consistently available, allows farmers more flexibility in
long-range planning.
   ``We recognize that the crop insurance program has had a history
of management problems that, in the short term, makes it difficult
to justify the current crop insurance program as the sole source of
disaster assistance to farmers,'' said Harman.
   He said Congress should provide a transition period if it decides
to rely exclusively on crop insurance for disaster assistance.
   Davis and Classen testified before the House Agriculture
subcommittee on conservation, credit and rural development.
   ``The commission believes that many changes to effect immediate
administrative improvements in the program can be made under
existing law by the secretary of agriculture and the Federal Crop
Insurance Corp.,'' said Davis and Classen. ``These changes would
foster increased participation by farmers.''

   American ethnic groups view the U.S.-Soviet
meeting that starts today as a means of seizing on Kremlin reforms
to lobby for such causes as Baltic independence, Jewish emigration,
easy travel for Eskimos and Armenian rights.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard A. Shevardnadze are to sign an agreement Saturday to shatter
the so-called ``Ice Curtain'' that has divided the Yupik and Inupiat
Eskimos of Siberia and Alaska since the Kremlin forbade travel
across the Bering Strait in 1948, administration and congressional
sources said.
   ``The Arctic winds that pass through are becoming warmer,
beckoning others to join in chipping away at the ice curtain,'' said
Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, hailing the promised agreement.
   The well-being of other ethnic groups in the Soviet Union is far
less certain. Jewish, Armenian and Baltic organizations were
pressuring the Bush administration to use the Baker-Shevardnadze
session to discuss many of the same issues dealt with at a stormy
Communist Party meeting that ended Wednesday in Moscow.
   The Communist Party passed a resolution urging Soviet
nationalities, including the Lithuanians, Estonians and Latvians of
the Baltic republics, and the Armenian majority of the troubled
Nagorno-Karabakh enclave, to curb their demands for political
independence in return for greater economic autonomy.
   Six senators led by Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., chairman of the
Foreign Relations Committee, have introduced a measure urging Moscow
to transfer authority over Nagorno-Karabakh to Armenia, from which
it is separated by a narrow band of Azerbaijan.
   Armenian-American groups took out newspaper advertisements this
week urging Baker to raise the issue with Shevardnadze when they
meet in Jackson Hole, Wyo., this Friday through Sunday.
   Baltic-American groups were planning similar steps. The United
States never has recognized the Soviet annexation of the Baltic
republics at the close of World War II, and on Tuesday Baker
advanced that policy a step further by urging independence for those
people.
   ``It's been the position of the United States for some time that
we do not recognize the incorporation of the Baltic states into the
Soviet Union,'' Baker said. ``We do not seek to foster, nor would we
profit from, instability in the Soviet Union. So we'd like to see a
peaceful move toward independence for the Baltic states.''
   Vice President Dan Quayle signaled a more outspoken White House
stance on the Baltic in a Cable News Network interview on Sept. 9.
   ``Clearly, every event triggers a response. And if there's a
negative event toward the Baltic states, I would imagine there would
be a negative response,'' Quayle said. Neither he nor other
administration officials have specified what steps they would take
if the Kremlin cracks down.
   Viktor Nakas, a spokesman for the Lithuanian Information Center,
a Washington-based emigre group, said, ``I see this as a step. I
think that circumstances have forced the Bush administration to take
a stand.''
   A bipartisan group of 24 senators, headed by Sens. Robert C.
Byrd, D-W.Va., and Don W. Riegle, D-Mich., sent a public letter to
Baker on Wednesday saying that ``the vice president's recent
statements to the press in support of the Baltic peoples' struggle
for independence must be reemphasized in face-to-face meetings with
Soviet officials'' including Shevardnadze.
   The administration also came under some pressure, and some
applause, this week from the National Conference on Soviet Jewry,
which pointedly met in Washington on Tuesday, two days before
Shevardnadze's arrival.
   ``It looks as if most Jews who want to leave the Soviet Union may
now leave,'' Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger told the
conference.
   ``That does not mean we are dropping the refusenik cases that are
still unresolved. We will continue to work on them until every
single case in which an emigrant permit is unjustly denied has been
satisfactorily resolved,'' he said, stressing that the issue would
be raised at the meeting this week.
   The Jewish group, in response, endorsed a Bush administration
plan to shift to the U.S. consulate in Moscow the job of screening
of Soviets seeking to emigrate to the United States. The change is
needed to cope with the rapid rise in emigration, which promises to
top the record level set in 1979.

<HEAD>House Panel OKs Burial of Ashes at Arlington</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Legislation advancing in the House would give
more veterans the opportunity to choose Arlington National Cemetery
as their final resting place.
   The national military cemetery, on a hillside directly across the
Potomac River from Washington, D.C., is expected to run out of
casket space in 2020. The columbarium, where urns are stored, is
expected to be full in 2029.
   But a bill approved by the House Veterans Affairs Committee
Wednesday would allow veterans who qualify for burial at Arlington
to choose an unmarked burial for their ashes. Although the
legislation doesn't specify the site, one proposal would have ashes
buried in one area with the names of all the deceased carved on a
large memorial stone.
   The problem of dwindling space at Arlington has been growing as
the average age of the veterans population has grown older. The
number of veterans over 65 years old total nearly 6 million now and
should be nearly 9 million by the turn of the century.
   Until restrictions were enacted in 1967, any honorably discharged
veteran could be buried at Arlington. Roughly 190,000 people are
buried in the 612-acre cemetery.
   The disposal of ashes in a common area would be strictly optional
and would not use any space that could be used for caskets, the bill
says.
   The ashes, which would not be placed in urns, would be buried
under sod or in small hole. An aide to Rep. Charles E. Bennett,
D-Fla., the bill's chief sponsor, said the Army would insist on a
fitting ceremony and interment to address concerns ``that it may
seem like a mass grave.''
   In another action, the committee approved legislation to create a
World War II memorial in or near the District of Columbia, paid for
by donations and taxes.
   No decisions have been made on size, location and design of the
memorial.

<HEAD>Nominee Says Defense Cuts Would Undercut Treaty Talks</HEAD>

   Cuts Congress is considering in the fiscal 1990
budget for various weapons programs could derail a U.S.-Soviet
agreement on reducing strategic arms, says President Bush's nominee
to be chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
   Gen. Colin L. Powell, whose career has spanned two combat tours
in Vietnam to a stint as former President Reagan's national security
adviser, won unanimous approval Wednesday from the Senate Armed
Services Committee to be the nation's top military commander.
   If confirmed by the full Senate, Powell would succeed Adm.
William J. Crowe Jr., who is retiring Sept. 30.
   During the nearly three-hour confirmation hearing earlier
Wednesday, Powell told members of the committee that political
changes in the Soviet Union should not lead to wholesale cuts in the
Star Wars program, land-based nuclear missiles or the B-2 stealth
bomber.
   House legislation would cut $502 million from the $1.1 billion
request for the multiple-warhead, rail-based MX missile and
eliminate all $100 million earmarked for the single-warhead,
truck-mobile Midgetman.
   Powell said the House plan ``would completely unhinge our START
(Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty) negotiating position.''
   House and Senate conferees met behind closed doors Wednesday to
craft a final version of the defense bill. According to
congressional sources who requested anonymity, senators rejected a
revised House proposal calling for full funding of the MX missile
and elimination of the Midgetman.
   Powell's remarks came one day after Secretary of State James A.
Baker III announced the administration will no longer insist on
elimination of land-based mobile missiles, conceding the issue had
complicated negotiations. The Soviets have two mobile missiles while
the administration is asking Congress to fund the MX and Midgetman.
   Powell also told senators that scaling back the program to build
130 of the bat-winged B-2 bombers, considered the most expensive
plane in history at $530 million a copy, would force the United
States to change its stance in arms talks with the Soviets.
   ``Without the B-2, we no longer have the same START position that
we did for the last several years and I believe it most unlikely
that there will be a treaty up here to ratify,'' he said.
   ``We would have to go back quite a ways and renegotiate a
different type of treaty,'' he said.
   On other issues, Powell said:
   _He supported using the armed forces in the war on drugs and in
response to terrorist attacks.
   _The U.S. should not unilaterally cut troops in South Korea,
Europe and other overseas posts to convince allies to share more of
the defense burden. Powell said he was ``very hesitant'' to do it to
satisfy current budget demands.
   Powell is commander of the Army Forces Command in Fort
MacPherson, Ga. He was hailed by Democrat Albert Gore Jr. of
Tennessee and Republican Pete Wilson of California as likely the
best appointment Bush has made.

<HEAD>Gorbachev Shows Renewed Strength in Politburo Shake-up'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Mikhail S. Gorbachev's swift elimination of a
quarter of the ruling Politburo, including two leading
conservatives, demonstrates his political strength just as doubts
about his staying power were gaining currency in Washington.
   The dramatic power play, executed on the eve of Foreign Minister
Eduard A. Shevardnadze's meeting with President Bush at the White
House, served to counter suggestions that the Soviet president had
been weakened by increasing public frustration with worsening
economic conditions and heightened ethnic tensions.
   The shake-up could be seen as strengthening Shevardnadze's hand
as he seeks to revitalize the arms control process during talks with
Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker III in Washington and
Wyoming.
   With successive moves during the last year to consolidate his
power, Gorbachev may now have broken high-level resistance and
opened the way for sweeping changes that reformers say are needed if
Gorbachev's program of economic restructuring is to shake the
country out of the doldrums.
   The party's Central Committee meeting that shuffled the makeup of
the party's Politburo also handed Gorbachev an early opportunity
next year to use a party congress to reach further down into the
party apparatus to shake out bureaucrats blamed for smothering
reform.
   The president and Communist Party chief successfully instituted
glasnost, which has brought more open criticism and debate.
   He overhauled the political system to encourage competitive
elections and representative oversight of government operations.
   And his ``new thinking'' in foreign policy has done much to
dispel what he called his country's ``enemy image'' abroad.
   But Gorbachev's reforms so far have failed to relieve the
grinding economic hardship that has left consumers frustrated by
barren cupboards and empty store shelves at a time when their own
media show them the practical pleasures of living in the
comparatively wealthy West.
   Outspoken reformists in and out of the recently elected Congress
of People's Deputies have said the transition from the old system of
central planning and control to a new market economy requires
radical stripping away of bureaucratic control over supplies and
prices. But Gorbachev so far has talked about such steps without
actually taking them.
   With the retirement of veteran Ukrainian party boss Vladimir V.
Shcherbitsky, 71, the 58-year-old Gorbachev is now the only member
of the Politburo elevated to the ruling body during the regime of
the late Leonid I. Brezhnev.
   Shcherbitsky has long been regarded as one of the most
conservative forces in the leadership but too entrenched in his home
republic for Gorbachev to unseat him.
   Former KGB chief Viktor M. Chebrikov, 66, another of those
retired Wednesday, also was regarded as a conservative anchor who
opposed many Gorbachev reforms.
   The departures left one prominent conservative, Yegor K.
Ligachev, in place. But both Gorbachev and Ligachev have taken pains
to express their support for each other while often disagreeing on
policy.
   Gorbachev installed two of his own men, Gen. Vladimir A.
Kryuchkov, the new KGB chief, and Yuri D. Maslyukov, who heads
economic planning, as full members of the Politburo, which now
numbers 11 men.
   The retirements also included non-voting member Yuri Solovyev,
who thus became the first member of the party's top leadership to
fall after being defeated at the polls.
   Solovyev, who was rejected by the voters of Leningrad when he ran
unopposed for a seat in the Congress, already had been removed as
Leningrad party chief.
   Gorbachev opened the way for graceful retirement from the top
echelons of Soviet power when he paid public tribute to Andrei A.
Gromyko as he relieved him of the presidency a year ago.
   He continued that practice Wednesday.
   When it was announced that Shcherbitsky, Chebrikov and Viktor P.
Nikonov were going out on pension, Tass said, Gorbachev thanked the
three Politburo members warmly for their ``many years of fruitful
activity'' in the party.
   Departures from the party leadership were once accomplished only
by death or abrupt ouster into instant obscurity or public disgrace.

   Lucille Bloch, the wife of suspected spy Felix
Bloch, will no longer work as executive director of a foundation
that promotes cultural exchanges between Austria and the United
States because of publicity surrounding her husband's case.
   Thomas J. McGrath, a lawyer in New York who serves as the
secretary of the American Austrian Foundation, said Wednesday that
Mrs. Bloch resigned because she found the controversy surrounding
her husband hurt her effectiveness on the job.
   The board has decided to close its office in Washington and move
its headquarters from Washington to New York. The group is looking
for a successor to Mrs. Bloch, who resigned Tuesday.
   Felix Bloch, the former No. 2 official at the U.S. Embassy in
Vienna and a veteran of 30 years in the Foreign Service, has been
under surveillance by FBI agents since June.
   ``Just imagine the terrible pressure and the problem (Mrs. Bloch)
is having,'' McGrath said. ``I'm sure every time she turns around,
they say, `Oh, you're that man's wife.'''
   Bloch has denied any wrongdoing and no charges have been filed
against him.
   A secretary at the American Austrian Foundation said Mrs. Bloch
was not available for comment, and she did not immediately return a
message left on her home answering machine. McGrath said she has
relatives in New York she often stays with.
   McGrath said the foundation, which received private contributions
and about $39,000 from the Austrian Foreign Ministry in 1988, will
continue to operate programs such as one that promotes exchanges for
young journalists.
   Meantime, the FBI refused Wednesday to discuss the status of the
Bloch case.
   Bloch, 54, was placed on administrative leave with pay from his
State Department job in June, a month before allegations against him
were made public.
   Bloch was trailed for weeks by reporters and photographers as he
went about his business, operating from his apartment. More recently
he has disappeared from the media spotlight.
   The Justice Department launched its probe after Bloch was
photographed handing a briefcase to a suspected Soviet agent in a
restaurant in Paris in May, according to U.S. sources who commented
on condition they not be named.

   Jessye Norman, who has probably the most lustrous
female voice in opera today, was the guest artist at the opening of
the New York Philharmonic's season in Avery Fisher Hall.
   She sang gloriously both before and after intermission at the
concert Wednesday night, televised by PBS as ``Live from Lincoln
Center.''
   The evening began with music director Zubin Mehta's remarkable
conducting of Wagner's overture to ``Tannhauser.'' It had the pure,
sweet religious faith which is one of the major themes of the opera,
a feeling of cleansing its listeners. Finally, the music swelled
into an electrifying ending.
   Mehta certainly has a feel for opera. The New York Philharmonic
sounded like one of the great orchestras.
   Miss Norman followed, singing Mahler's five late songs to poems
by Friedrich Ruckert. She shaped each of those familiar songs
differently but with no sense of stretching to be different. The
first was poignant, the third sometimes mysterious, the third tender
then swelling to become tones a listener could enter. In the final
song, ``I Have Withdrawn from the World,'' Miss Norman used a dark,
lush tone to convey something stark, then shaded it into calm.
   After intermission, she sang the ``Liebestod'' from Wagner's
``Tristan und Isolde.'' Even in that outpouring from a woman in a
trance of love, Miss Norman had nuances. She started softly, then
rose to the power of Isolde's larger-then-life vision. Though her
vocal strength, with a larger-than-usual orchestra on stage, was
remarkable, she lost no tonal beauty.
   The orchestra played the prelude to ``Tristan,'' leading up to
the ``Liebestod.''
   The other piece on the program was Mozart's ``40th Symphony.''
Mehta may have been slightly less inspired by that than by the
operatic pieces. Balances in the second movement didn't sound just
right. But it is a rather hyper symphony and Mehta and the
Philharmonic did capture that.
   It was suggested ahead of time to audience members that women's
gowns be white, black or a combination of white and black and most
women complied. Miss Norman's gown, in contrast, was bright patterns
which looked inspired by Africa or Japan. A covered walkway and tent
for a late dinner kept the heavy rain off concertgoers. Bouquets in
tall, slender silver vases on each table were of white flowers.

<HEAD>Democrats, Republicans, Educators Vie for Piece of Summit Action</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   With President Bush guaranteed a prominent role
in next week's education summit, Democrats and Republicans _ and to
a lesser extent educators _ already are jockeying for a piece of the
action.
   However, money is one key subject absent from most of the lofty
proposals and the flurry of activities before the two-day meeting
with the nation's governors.
   Democratic leaders of Congress stole the scene Wednesday by
announcing six national performance goals to upgrade American
education, including lower dropout rates, higher college-going rates
and early childhood education for all poor 4-year-olds by 1995 or
earlier.
   The Democrats, joined by Maryland state and local politicians,
assembled at a showcase school in a Washington suburb about 2 {
hours before Bush attended a private seminar with some of the
nation's best-known educators who offered advice for the summit in
Charlottesville, Va.
   Thirty minutes before Bush's seminar, the National Education
Association, the nation's largest teachers' union, released its own
``Classroom Agenda for the Education Summit.''
   NEA President Keith Geiger broached the politically volatile
issue of money and noted that for every $3 state and local
governments added to education in the 1980s, the federal government
took $1 away. He said the federal share of the school dollar for
elementary and secondary schools declined from 9.2 percent in 1981
to 6.3 percent in 1989.
   Geiger said money should be a key focus of the summit and added,
``The federal government must become a more active partner in
promoting progress.''
   Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton, on hand to congratulate the Democrats
for their proposals, conceded ``there will be a lot of discussions
about federal funding'' at the summit.
   ``But I think the important thing is to note that the governors,
at the White House, committed to this process of goal-setting
because we know, first of all there's a big deficit; secondly, the
president made a commitment not to raise any money; thirdly, most of
the money being raised now ... is at the state and local level,''
Clinton said.
   ``I think the most important thing is to decide where the country
needs to go in education and then once you do that you can develop a
strategy to achieve those goals that assesses responsibility,''
Clinton said, who is co-leading summit preparations for the National
Governors Association.
   The Democrats also seek to raise students' basic skills
achievement levels, boost their performance in math, science and
foreign languages, and expand the pool of qualified teachers.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell of Maine called the list
``Democratic education goals for the nation,'' and said his party
``has long championed educational opportunity for all Americans. The
major federal education programs were Democratic initiatives.''
   While the Democrats gathered at Eleanor Roosevelt High School in
Greenbelt, Md., Bush sat down for private talks at the White House
with a dozen education leaders, assuring them that the deck was not
``stacked'' for the summit and that he was eager to hear their ideas.
   Dr. James P. Comer, a Yale University child psychiatrist and
expert on educating poor children, said afterward that he entered
the White House skeptical, but emerged ``relieved and impressed that
(Bush) does understand the complexity'' of the problems facing the
schools.
   Comer cautioned against putting ``more pressures on educators
without creating ... the circumstances that can support them and
make it possible for people to reach those goals.''
   But University of Tennessee President Lamar Alexander, the former
Republican governor of Tennessee, said, ``We need clear goals and
... brand-new school systems.''
   While the Democrats put no price tag on how much it would cost to
meet their education goals, the list clearly would entail major
increases in the $22 billion Education Department budget.
   Their policy statement promised that the Democrats ``will
continue to seek adequate funding for the major federal education
initiatives,'' especially efforts to improve opportunities for the
poor and handicapped, and aid for schools and college students.

   A proposal to expand the rights of the disabled
could put such a financial strain on city transit services that it
ends up harming the general public and the handicapped alike,
congressional critics of the legislation say.
   Republicans on a House Transportation subcommittee questioned
Wednesday whether wheelchair lifts should be required on all public
transit buses, pointing to one major city where existing lifts are
used only every other day on average.
   A Bush administration official told the surface transportation
subcommittee the provision is a key part of the Americans With
Disabilities Act, which has come to be known as civil rights
legislation for the handicapped.
   The universal use of the lifts, and a requirement for
door-to-door bus service for those who can't make it to a bus stop,
would help get the nation's 43 million disabled people into the
mainstream of daily American life, said Roland J. Mross, deputy
administrator of the Urban Mass Transportation Administration.
   Republicans on the panel, however, are questioning the blanket
nature of the requirements.
   ``I'm also concerned that if we increase costs to the point that
we bring a reduction of service then we are not serving the disabled
and we're not serving the general public either,'' said Rep. Bud
Shuster, R-Pa.
   Each lift adds about $10,000 to $15,000 to the $155,000 cost of a
bus and adds $2,000 to the annual maintenance cost, Mross told the
panel. He estimated the annual cost just of buying lifts at $30
million. UMTA would probably pay $24 million of that, he said.
   Although there are already regulations governing access by the
elderly and handicapped to mass transit receiving federal funds, the
new act would be far stricter.
   At issue in Wednesday's hearing was a requirement in the bill,
already passed by the Senate and endorsed by the Bush
administration, that all public transit buses be equipped with
wheelchair lifts.
   Shuster said Transportation Department figures show that in
Seattle, which has lift-equipped buses, each lift is used every
other day.
   Spokesman for the Seattle and the Cambria County, Pa., systems _
which are considered leaders in serving the handicapped _ told the
panel the bill would cause hardships.
   But Ellen Daly, legislative analyst at the President's Committee
on Employment of People with Disabilities, said the existing service
keeps the handicapped virtually confined to their homes.
   She said many systems that have door-to-door service for the
disabled require long advance notice _ 16 or 17 hours on the average
_ and require a large amount of red tape to qualify for the service.
   ``You can't decide on a moment's notice that you want to go
shopping or stay at the office late,'' she said.
   The Senate passed a version of the bill, with the transit
requirements, on Sept. 7.

<HEAD>Sexually Active College Students Not Using Condoms</HEAD>

   A survey of 6,911 white, middle-class college
students found that they knew how to protect themselves against AIDS
and other sexually transmitted diseases but weren't doing it.
   About 75 percent of the Canadian students reported that they were
sexually active but only 19 percent said they used condoms
regularly. Twenty-six percent said they never used condoms.
   Yet 80 percent answered correctly when asked questions about
preventing sexually transmitted diseases.
   The survey ``suggests most education and media campaigns to
increase condom use are dismal failures,'' said Dr. Noni MacDonald
of the University of Ottawa. She presented her findings Wednesday at
a meeting of the American Society for Microbiology.
   MacDonald, a member of a Canadian health ministry task force on
sexually transmitted diseases, said her findings probably would
apply to white, middle-class U.S. college students.
   ``If we've got it in `middle-America Canada,' you must have it in
middle America,'' she said.
   The study found that 30 percent of 14-year-olds already had had
intercourse. So had 77 percent of college men and 73 percent of
college women.
   One in four men and one in eight women reported having had at
least 10 sexual partners.
   These findings held true ``right across the country,
coast-to-coast, little town, big town,'' said MacDonald.
   A recent study of condom use by adolescent males in the United
States found that 57 percent reported use of a condom the last time
they had intercourse, but that only 30 percent said they had always
used a condom.
   The author of the American study, Freya Sonenstein of the Urban
Institute in Washington, D.C., said condom use has increased, but
that condom use is lowest in the adolescents who are most at risk,
either because they have multiple partners or have sex with
prostitutes, for example.
   Condoms have been widely promoted as a way to cut the risk of
getting infected with the human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, that
causes AIDS. But they also can protect against other sexually
transmitted diseases, such as chlamydia, a common infection that can
leave women infertile, sometimes without causing any symptoms at the
time of infection.
   Eight percent of the Canadian college students have had at least
one sexually transmitted disease, MacDonald said.
   Sonenstein found that reports of condom use among American
adolescent males doubled during the past 10 years or so.
   Dr. John Moran of the federal Centers for Disease Control said
condom sales jumped by 20 percent shortly after the U.S. surgeon
general released his report on AIDS in 1986. Even so, syphilis is on
the rise in inner cities.
   ``It appears obvious to me that there are a lot of people not
using condoms that should,'' he said in a telephone interview.
``Clearly there is a large group of people putting themselves at
risk for HIV by not using condoms.''
   AIDS is uncommon among Canadian college students now, but ``with
the rapidity with which they're having sexual intercourse, it would
not take long to spread,'' MacDonald said.
   She said that students must be taught not only the facts about
AIDS and sexually transmitted diseases but also how to handle
awkward social and sexual situations so that condom use becomes
easier.
   ``When you teach someone how to drive a car, you don't tell them
about the engine, you teach them how to do it,'' she said.

   Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze's journey to
the United States for superpower negotiations comes at a time the
Soviets are dealing with complex internal difficulties and talking
as if the thrill is gone from relations with the United States.
   ``That the Bush administration is not consumed by the
enthusiastic wish to reach agreements with the Soviet Union is
recognized even here as an indisputable fact,'' Pravda wrote from
Washington, D.C., as Shevardnadze flew to the United States.
   Shevardnadze and Baker last met in Paris in July, and for the
Soviets, arms control remains the acid test of their relationship
with the United States.
   ``Successful development of U.S.-Soviet relations can hardly be
imagined without progress in the area of arms limitation and
reduction,'' the Tass news agency recently informed readers.
   Shevardnadze and Baker will meet over the weekend in Jackson
Hole, Wyo.
   The Kremlin's outward mood has shifted from elation to dismay as
President Bush has presided over a slowdown in the pace of arms
control talks, an area which gave Mikhail S. Gorbachev his first
tangible policy achievement with the signing of a treaty with former
President Reagan to eliminate medium- and shorter-range nuclear
missiles.
   For Soviets, whose dreary, shortage-plagued lot has failed to
improve and in many cases worsened under Gorbachev's economic
reforms, the 1987 treaty and Reagan's visit to Moscow seemed to
presage a new and safer world, with a good share of credit going to
their own leader.
   But with President Bush, the Soviets are dealing with a president
who said this week he's in no hurry for a summit meeting with
Gorbachev.
   This time the Soviets have dropped heavy hints that Shevardnadze
will unveil a new offer in Washington, where he pays a call on Bush
today, or later in Wyoming.
   Exactly what Shevardnadze is carrying remains under wraps, but
Tass quoted him upon departure from Moscow as saying he has a
personal message from Gorbachev to Bush on disarmament.
   ``It's a deep and constructive document'' designed to spur the
talks in the United States, Shevardnadze said without giving details.
   Superpower negotiations aside, Shevardnadze's activities before
he boarded a special Washington-bound jetliner give a glimpse of how
daunting the problems facing his country are.
   According to Gennady Gerasimov, his spokesman, the snowy-haired
member of the ruling Politburo attended a Kremlin meeting charged
with finding a way out of the spasms of violence between Soviet
ethnic groups in which 200 people have died in the last 19 months.
   In addition, entrenched portions of the Soviet bureaucracy,
fearful of losing position and privilege, have resisted movement
toward a more market-oriented economy with its attendant risks.
   Official press accounts assert the superpowers are within reach
of an accord to boost a worldwide ban on chemical weapons, and
Gerasimov on Wednesday welcomed Baker's statement that the Americans
may withdraw their proposal for a ban on mobile ICBMs, one sticking
point in the Geneva talks on long-range weapons.
   Yet the Soviets have expressed dissatisfaction with the pace of
arms control talks under the Bush administration.
   Usually smiling and debonair, Shevardnadze earlier this month
denounced the ``constraint and timidity'' of the officials in charge
of Washington's new arms reduction policy. It was another signal of
the Kremlin's frustration at the latest turn taken by U.S.-Soviet
relations.
   Putting superpower talks for a 50 percent reduction of strategic
weapons on a faster track is a major concern of the Soviets, and
they've all but openly accused Bush and Baker of neglecting the
parleys.
   ``The Geneva negotiations and the American delegation's stance
there call for a powerful political impetus,'' Tass said. ``Only the
U.S. president and the secretary of state are able to provide it.''
   ``When creating the atmosphere around the forthcoming political
contacts, the Soviet side would like to concentrate primarily on
recent positive statements by President George Bush and Secretary of
State James Baker,'' Tass said. Among those statements is Bush's
professed support for Gorbachev's domestic reform agenda, Tass said.
   Whatever the course of the talks, Shevardnadze should feel right
at home in the mountain air of Jackson Hole. His native Georgia in
the Soviet south lies in the Caucasus range, and its tallest peak,
Mount Elbrus, tops Grand Teton by almost a mile.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev has strengthened his hold on
the ruling Communist Party at a time when economic failures and
ethnic violence have prompted some to worry openly about the
possibility of a coup or civil war.
   The Soviet leader on Wednesday retired a quarter of the party's
top elite. Three full Politburo members departed, including the last
Brezhnev appointee other than Gorbachev, conservative Ukrainian
party chief Vladimir V. Shcherbitsky.
   Replacing the three are men who hold critical positions for
revolutionizing the old Soviet ways of controlling citizens, making
law and running the economy.
   The new KGB chief, professional intelligence officer Vladimir
Kryuchkov, replaced Viktor Chebrikov, an executive of the secretive
agency through two decades of harsh repression of dissent.
   Economic planning chief Yuri D. Maslyukov was promoted to full
membership on the Politburo and a leader in the new legislature,
Yevgeny M. Primakov, became a non-voting member.
   The shake-up came at a meeting of the Communist Party Central
Committee that centered on solving ethnic strife that has killed
more than 200 people in the multi-national Soviet Union in the past
19 months.
   It followed committee approval of a program advocating for more
self-rule in restive Soviet republics but demanding that calls for
secession from the union be stifled.
   The removal of Shcherbitsky and Chebrikov _ two men with
histories of cracking down on dissent _ was likely to mitigate the
sting of Gorbachev's harsh criticism of secessionists for
independence activists in some republics.
   The shake-up gives Gorbachev a stronger hand in Moscow as the
party leadership writes a new program for the 1990s.
   The Central Committee on Tuesday moved up the date for the
party's next congress to October 1990, handing Gorbachev an early
opportunity to bring new blood into the party's top echelon.
   Only a party congress can add reformers to the 251-member Central
Committee. The last one was held in 1986, just a year after
Gorbachev came to power.
   Shcherbitsky was the last Politburo member other than Gorbachev
still serving from the time of President Leonid I. Brezhnev. His
retirement makes Vitaly I. Vorotnikov of the Russian republic the
only pre-Gorbachev appointee remaining on the Politburo.
   Shcherbitsky presumably will remain party chief in the Ukraine
until a replacement can be named.
   Chebrikov had moved from head of the KGB a year ago to a new
party position overseeing legal affairs. He is said to be one of
those responsible for Gorbachev's selection as party chief in 1985
but some Western analysts regarded him as a Gorbachev rival.
   His departure was likely to please activists in some Soviet
republics, especially in Georgia, where he was suspected of having
prior knowledge of a military assault that killed a score of
nationalist demonstrators in April.
   Viktor P. Nikonov, an agricultural bureaucrat, also retired from
full membership. He had described himself earlier this year as a
deputy to Yegor K. Ligachev on party agricultural policy. His role
on the Politburo was never clear, however, and his views on major
policy questions were not well known.
   The new full members of the Politburo, Kryuchkov and Maslyukov,
are no strangers to the Soviets.
   KGB chief Kryuchkov has promoted his agency as a friend rather
than foe of the people. He has undergone an unprecedented
legislative confirmation hearing, granted interviews to the press
and offered to cooperate with the West to combat terrorism and drug
trafficking.
   Maslyukov, head of the State Planning Committee, faces the task
of reducing decades of central planning and sorting out economic
relations with the republics.
   Two non-voting members of the Politburo, Yuri Solovyev and
Nikolai Talyzin, also were forced out. Their places were taken by
legislative leader Primakov, and Boris Pugo, head of the party
commission overseeing discipline.
   Solovyev, the former party chief of Leningrad, was humiliated in
March when he was rejected in an election for the new Congress of
People's Deputies even though he ran unopposed. He subsequently was
removed as party chief.
   Talyzin was Maslyukov's predecessor as planning chief, but was
demoted twice before being dropped from the Politburo.
   Gorbachev told the Central Committee in his closing speech
Wednesday it was time to ``strike a determined blow at those who
offer us adventurist platforms instead of politics and serious
affairs.''
   Speaking extemporaneously and jabbing his finger in the air for
emphasis, he said the country could not afford to be ``dragged into
any reshaping of borders ... changing shapes of national
formations.''
   The Communist Party's program declared that republics have the
right to own and manage their land and natural resources free from
central planners in Moscow, and should ``enjoy broad opportunities
to invigorate their economy and culture'' while relying on the
overall strength of the national economy.

   The makeup of the Soviet Politburo has shifted
sharply and now reflects strong support of President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's reforms.
   The Communist Party's ruling body Wednesday retired its last
Brezhnev man, die-hard conservative Ukrainian party leader Vladimir
V. Shcherbitsky, and the first Kremlin leader to lose a public vote
of confidence, former Leningrad party chief Yuri F. Solovyov.
   Key Gorbachev supporters also joined the Politburo: Yuri D.
Maslyukov, the man appointed to decentralize economic planning;
Vladimir A. Kryuchkov, a KGB chief who spent his career in the
secret police force's foreign operations rather than in repression
of domestic dissent; and Gorbachev's Mideast and Far East adviser,
Yevgeny M. Primakov, who also is a leader in the new Soviet
legislature.
   The Politburo also lost one KGB general and gained two with the
retirement of former KGB chief Viktor Chebrikov and the promotion of
Kryuchkov and Boris K. Pugo.

   Yuri D. Maslyukov, 52, named last year to transform the Soviet
central planning agency, Gosplan, from a vast bureaucracy trying to
control the production and distribution of every nut and bolt to a
smaller agency that only sets general economic goals. He is a
Russian born in Tadzhikistan who held jobs in engineering and the
defense industry for 26 years. He took on the decentralization of
the Soviet economy in 1988, replacing Nikolai V. Talyzin, who lost
his non-voting status on the Politburo on Wednesday.
   Vladimir A. Kryuchkov, 65, a career spy promoted to run the KGB
last year and the first KGB chairman to face a public confirmation
hearing this summer. He is a Russian schooled in law and diplomacy
and ran foreign spy operations for years. As KBG chairman he has
launched a publicity campaign emphasizing the agency's role in
capturing foreign spies and terrorists while playing down its role
in repressing dissidents.

   Panicked residents and tourists who scrambled to the
first evacuation plane out of St. Croix told tales of horror after
arriving back on the U.S. mainland.
   Hurricane Hugo's devastation of the popular Caribbean tourist
retreat was followed by a swarm of gun-wielding looters, prompting
President Bush to dispatch military police and arrange for
evacuations.
   ``We just got lucky,'' said Bob McManus of West Point, Conn.,
about being among 145 passengers on a special Pan Am evacuation
flight arranged by U.S. marshals Wednesday night. He said the sight
of the plane at the St. Croix airport touched off a stampede of
those trying to flee.
   ``The looters were everywhere there,'' said McManus, still
gripping the 4-iron golf club he used for protection.
   ``They said, `We're in charge now.' At one grocery store, they
just rolled up trucks and loaded them up.''
   U.S. District Judge Stanley Brotman of Camden, N.J., who was on
temporary assignment in St. Croix, said he first had to protect
himself from the storm, then the looters.
   ``It was the most devastating experience of my life,'' Brotman
said. ``We had three originally in our condomimium, and after the
storm there were 18 in one room with mattresses up against every
wall and rope to hold the shutters closed.''
   Nadine Gregg, owner of an art gallery in St. Croix, said she fled
to protect her 5-month-old son from violence several evacuees said
was tinged with racism.
   ``White people are scared. It's totally a racial thing,'' she
said. ``They need martial law down there.''
   ``The younger blacks are going crazy,'' McManus said. ``They're
shouting racial slurs at the whites.''
   Pan Am planned four more evacuation flights today and the U.S.
Coast Guard dispatched cutters to aid those requesting evacuation.

   Many residents of St. Simons Island never
lived through a major hurricane, but they're not ignoring the furor
of Hurricane Hugo as it headed toward the East Coast.
   ``I think anybody is going to be worried. It's a major
catastrophic happening,'' said Billy Cullens, a director of the St.
Simons Chamber of Commerce.
   At an island grocery store, shoppers packed carts with bottled
water, canned goods and other supplies.
   ``Compared to past storms, they're taking it more seriously,''
supermarket manager Richard Thomas said. ``A lot more people seem to
be talking about leaving.''
   Attracted by its beaches, golf courses, warm climate and Southern
charm, about 5,000 people have moved to the island 65 miles south of
Savannah since the last hurricane came ashore in Georgia in 1979.
   St. Simons is about 10 miles long and is connected to the
mainland city of Brunswick by a seven-mile causeway. Parts of the
island remain undeveloped but elsewhere, beachfront condos and
subdivisions have sprouted up amid palms, pines and moss-draped oaks.
   Disaster officials called for the voluntary evacuation of the
island's 14,000 residents late Wednesday. They were ready to order
the evacuation of 30,000 residents from St. Simons and lowlying
areas of Brunswick and surrounding Glynn County.
   ``We would have to assess the situation, look at the tides, the
storm surge and the advice of the National Weather Service,'' said
Ed Stelle, the county's community development director.
   The weather service issued a hurricane watch Wednesday evening
and said there was an 11 percent chance Hugo could come within 65
miles of Savannah between 8 p.m. today and 8 a.m. Friday.
   When Hurricane David came ashore near Savannah on Sept. 4, 1979,
the storm knocked down trees, power lines and flooded streets before
moving into South Carolina. David left 1,200 people dead _ 19 in the
United States.
   Hugo has claimed 25 lives on Caribbean islands.
   Since its last hurricane, St. Simons' population jumped from
9,000.
   ``The major problem is the education of people,'' said Vernon D.
Martin, executive director of the Coastal Georgia Regional
Development Center in Brunswick.
   ``We've got a lot of new people who probably aren't familiar with
coastal problems associated with a hurricane. They're now aware of
the warnings and what the warnings mean.''
   The problem is common in Georgia's eight coastal counties. The
area is the state's fastest growing region, with the population
surging from 350,000 in 1980 to an estimated 400,000 in 1988. Growth
has been spurred by a new submarine base in Camden County, an Army
division at Hinesville, an $800-million-a-year tourist industry and
an influx of industries.
   But Cullens said the growth has left the island better equipped
to withstand hurricanes.
   ``We have a better causeway and a better road system,'' he said.
Since Hurricane David, a two-lane causeway with lift bridges has
been replaced by a four-lane causeway with high bridges. The island
also has strengthened building codes, he said.
   Ann Rogers, who runs a mail-order business on St. Simons, said
Hugo would be her first hurricane.
   ``I think I'm more concerned about our business than our house on
the beach,'' she said. ``We'd take our dogs and cats, and we'd be
gone.''
   At the Heritage Retirement Community, the staff has met often
with the elderly residents to prepare them for a possible evacuation.
   ``Many of our residents have pets and valuables,'' general
manager Freddie Stroud said. ``It's hard to explain to them that
this is a temporary evacuation.''

   The dollar remained sharply lower against the
Japanese yen Thursday, while the key index on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange rose.
   The dollar closed at 145.00 yen, down 1.25 yen from Wednesday's
close of 146.25 yen. It started trading lower at 144.90 yen and
moved between 144.82 yen and 145.25 yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shot up 274.44 points, or 0.80
percent, ending the day at 34,745.02. It had lost 0.49 points the
previous day.
   The index rose as market players were reassured by the yen's
rebound against the dollar, and buying orders for a variety of
issues were given since the opening, said Masahiro Umemori, a stock
analyst with Nomura Securities.
   ``Participants were buying supermarket issues considering that
reorganization and easing regulations on large-scale retail stores
could be positive steps to improve U.S.-Japan structural problems,''
he said.
   In currency dealings, the dollar's drop followed an overnight
downswing on overseas markets over speculation that West Germany may
raise the country's interest rates.
   A dealer with the Bank of Tokyo said Japanese market players were
watching closely whether the West German Bundesbank will take action
on its interest rates during its scheduled meeting Thursday.
   Although institutional investors and trading houses bought the
dollar as it fell, the majority of participants slowed down their
dollar-buying ahead of the monetary talks in Washington this weekend
among the Group of Seven industrialized nations, which might come up
with some measure to stem the dollar's strength, said the dealer,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Participants in the G-7 meeting are Japan, the United States,
West Germany, Britain, Italy, France and Canada.

   Hurricane Hugo quickened its pace toward the Eastern
Seaboard on Wednesday as residents gathered supplies and made
evacuation plans, while violence and looting broke out on the
shattered islands in the storm's wake.
   President Bush ordered Army troops to St. Croix of the U.S.
Virgin Islands after National Guardsmen and police reportedly joined
prison escapees and others in wild looting. Armed Coast Guard
crewmen also went ashore to help restore order.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh ordered 100 U.S. marshals and
FBI agents to the island, and Coast Guard cutters evacuated
frightened tourists and residents. Bush also authorized troops to
help hurricane-damaged Puerto Rico.
   Forecasters issued a hurricane watch from St. Augustine, Fla., to
Cape Hatteras, N.C., urging coastal residents to begin taking
precautions. Hugo picked up speed over open water and could come
ashore late Thursday or early Friday.
   ``I think they're looking at this one with a bit of respect,''
city spokesman Pat Dowling said in Myrtle Beach, S.C., as radio and
TV advisories warned: ``Remember the people of Puerto Rico.''
   Since Sunday, Hugo has killed at least 25 people, left thousands
homeless and caused hundreds of millions of dollars in damage as it
slashed through the northeastern Caribbean with wind of 125 to 150
mph.
   Chaos reigned on St. Croix, as police and National Guardsmen
joined machete-armed mobs on a post-Hugo looting spree. Gunshots
were fired, and ham radio operators heard reports that inmates had
either escaped or been released because of prison damage and were
looting.
   Tourists pleaded with reporters landing on the island to take
them off.
   ``They said, `Please get food! Please get water! Please help us!
They're looting. We've seen police looting. We've seen National
Guard looting. There's no law and order here,''' said Gary Williams,
a reporter for the San Juan daily El Nuevo Dia.
   The U.S. Coast Guard had six ships in the area and sent armed
crewmen from the cutter Bear ashore to help restore order.
   ``Our shore party went ashore and basically determined there was
a complete breakdown of authority. There's a very high indication
that innocent people are going to get hurt in an act of violence
there,'' Lt. Jeff Karonis said in Miami.
   The crew was evacuating ``all people from the island who fear for
their safety,'' the Coast Guard said in a statement. A cargo plane
was ready to supplement the evacuation if needed.
   Tourists sat on the porch of the King Christian Hotel, protected
by hotel employees carrying shotguns.
   ``It was horrendous,'' said Rose Hertzog of Northampton, Pa., who
waited out the storm in a hotel laundry room. ``I thought we were
going to die.
   Thornburgh ordered the 100 marshals and FBI agents to protect
federal officials and property, as well as help bolster local law
enforcement, said David Runkel, a Justice Department spokesman in
Washington. A small team of FBI agents was sent in first to set up a
command post.
   The White House said Alexander Farrelly, governor of the U.S.
Virgin Islands, asked Bush to authorize use of troops to restore
order on St. Croix, but Farrelly on Wednesday night denied making
that request.
   Bush on Wednesday declared the U.S. Virgin Islands a disaster
area and a White House spokesman said a similar declaration was
expected soon for Puerto Rico, which suffered widespread damage.
   The Coast Guard sent cutters to St. Thomas to pick up personnel
and their families whose homes were destroyed. It also was
evacuating 200 American medical students at Montserrat, a British
colony where Hugo damaged nearly 90 percent of the homes.
   Federal relief shipments laden with supplies and rescue workers
from Florida, South Carolina, West Virginia and Guantanamo Bay,
Cuba, went to Puerto Rico, while British and French forces helped
Montserrat and Guadeloupe.
   At 3 a.m. EDT Thursday, Hugo's center was about 450 miles
southeast of Savannah, Ga., at 28.2 degrees north latitude and 75.2
degrees west longitude, and was moving northwest at 17 mph, up from
12 mph earlier in the day.
   Hugo's wind speed also rose from 105 to 110 mph Wednesday, but
forecasters said little further strengthening was likely.
   Forecasters said Hugo's path made residents from Savannah, Ga.,
to Charleston, S.C., most likely to be in harm's way, but they were
delaying issuing hurricane warnings until they could make better
projections.
   Bob Sheets, director of the National Hurricane Center, said
officials didn't want to spur ``a cry-wolf syndrome'' by triggering
premature evacuation of the resort and retiree communities. But
forecasters said they hoped U.S. residents learned from Hugo's
Caribbean rampage.
   ``When those islands got pounded like they did, that's
remarkable,'' forecaster Martin Nelson said of the relatively low
death toll. ``We gave them a lot of warning, and they apparently
took the warnings.''
   U.S. coastal residents have enough time to prepare, he said.
   ``Let's hope they are,'' Nelson said. ``If later on, they say
`Boy, you sure got that wrong,' that's OK. We'd rather that happen
than have people wake up at 2 a.m. and find a hurricane coming.''
   South Carolina Gov. Carroll Campell put state law enforcement
agencies on alert. `All we can do is to watch now and to wait,'' he
said.
   In Charleston, the historic City Hall was boarded up and school
children were told to stay home Thursday.
   Officials said coastal residents seemed to be taking the right
steps, such as storing emergency supplies and buying materials for
boarding up.
   ``They're buying me out of all my candles, tape, flashlights,
propane fuel, oil and lamps,'' said Tim Brindley, merchandise
manager of K mart in Mount Pleasant, S.C.
   ``I see a lot of people buying water and canned goods like pork
and beans. It's been pretty steady,'' said Bryan Raleigh, manager of
the Market Street Food Lion in Wilmington, N.C., where nearby
Carolina Beach suffered $90 million in damages when hit by Hurricane
Diana in 1984.
   Some took extra precautions.
   ``We're going to church a lot,'' said Dean S. Phillips, town
manager in Bethany Beach, Del.
   The Navy sent its Charleston-based ships to sea to avoid Hugo,
while crews were called Wednesday to their ships at Mayport Naval
Station near Jacksonville for a possible move out.
   ``Like the Boy Scouts, we're prepared,'' said Chief Petty Officer
Art Riccio.
   Adminstrators at the Florida School for the Deaf and Blind sent
home 400 children living in dormitories. ``The decision was to
assume the worst and plan accordingly,'' said Mary Jane Dillon, a
school spokeswoman.
   Bahamians, meanwhile, watched as the hurricane moved away with
little impact.
   ``It's a great sigh of relief for all of us in the Bahamas,''
said meteorologist Michael Stubbs in Nassau. ``Most people want to
be able to enjoy the sea and sunshine here, and now they can.''
   Meanwhile, forecasters said Tropical Storm Iris was being
weakened because of its proximity to Hugo, but could cause more
problems for the Hugo-hit islands.
   ``Satellite pictures show an area of thunderstorms extends south
of the center into the extreme northeastern Caribbean,'' forecaster
Gil Clark said. ``Unfortunately, this activity will be moving
westward over an area that was struck by Hurricane Hugo just three
days ago.''
   At 10:30 p.m., Iris was near latitude 22.0 north and longitude
64.0 west, or 250 miles north-northeast of Puerto Rico. Its winds
were down to 45 mph as the storm moved west-northwest at around 12
mph.

<HEAD>Mercedes Pulls Disappearing Act on EPA Guzzlers List</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Environmental Protection Agency's massive
annual guide to automobile gas mileage is supposed to tell motorists
at a glance what cars are the stingiest and the worst guzzlers of
fuel.
   But not always, it turns out.
   Dozens of cars each year are missing from the annual list, and
this year the absent included the entire line of luxury cars from
Mercedes-Benz, including 11 whose mileage is so poor the cars are
subject to the special ``guzzler'' excise tax.
   Three of the Mercedes cars likely would have made the ``ten
worst'' list had they been included in the EPA survey of 981 cars
that was released earlier this week and widely distributed by the
news media.
   Don Larson, branch manager at the EPA's auto testing laboratory
in Ann Arbor, Mich., said every year perhaps 80 or 90 cars do not
make the list because manufacturers do not provide the testing data
to the EPA when the mileage guide goes to the printer.
   Aside from Mercedes, the EPA could not say what specific cars
were missing. A spokesman for General Motors Corp. said GM still
must submit test data for three cars and industry sources said they
would not be surprised if a dozen or more other manufacturers had
yet to submit test information on a few cars each.
   ``There are always a few stragglers,'' said EPA spokeswoman
Martha Casey.
   Federal law requires automakers to submit the mileage test data
and have it certified by the EPA before a car is placed on the
market. But they are not required to submit the information by a
specific date or meet the deadline for the initial industry-wide
mileage guide.
   Government and industry sources, speaking anonymously,
acknowledged the mileage guide can both help and hinder automakers.
Manufacturers often test their high mileage cars early to meet the
deadline for the publication and move more slowly on their
high-mileage models, said one official.
   The submission of the test data ``is at the manufacturer's
control. I don't know what was in the minds of Mercedes in making
their decision (not to submit test results earlier). But they do
have relatively fuel inefficient vehicles,'' said the EPA's Larson.
   The deadline for test data this year was Aug. 30. At the request
of one automaker, it was postponed until Sept. 5. Mercedes-Benz
submitted its first 1990 model test data covering a dozen cars on
Sept. 9, said Eldert Bontekoe of the EPA's certification office in
Ann Arbor.
   A.B. Shuman, manager of public relations at Mercedes-Benz of
North America in Montvale, N.J., said in a telephone interview the
mileage performance of the cars was ``absolutely not a factor'' in
the data being submitted late.
   ``It was just getting it all done,'' said Shuman, who said the
company had been unable to complete all the testing in time.
   Shuman also noted Mercedes does not put its 1990 models on the
market until Nov. 1 and so has more time to submit the test data
than many other automakers whose 1990 models hit the showroom in
September and October.
   Nevertheless, 11 of the Mercedes cars showed overall mileage of
18 miles per gallon or less and are subject to a ``gas guzzler''
excise tax, according to figures provided by the EPA.
   At least three of the 1990 Mercedes models had mileage so low
they likely would have been among the ``worst ten'' in mileage for
1990 had they been included in the EPA survey list.
   The mileage data for the Mercedes cars _ along with figures for
any other cars submitted late _ will be included in an updated
mileage list in February.
   But Ms. Casey, the EPA spokeswoman, acknowledged the revised list
usually gets little public attention.

<HEAD>FDA Investigating Reports of Side Effects Related to Drug Halcion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration is looking
into a ``relatively high'' number of reports about unwanted side
effects from the drug Halcion, the world's most widely prescribed
sleep medication.
   An FDA advisory committee is expected to review the reports at a
meeting Friday to determine why more adverse reactions have been
reported for Halcion than for other drugs in its class of hypnotics.
   Halcion has been on the market since the beginning of 1983 and is
The Upjohn Co.'s second-largest sales item.
   Spokeswomen for the company and the FDA said they did not know
the nature of the reports about adverse reactions or the number of
reports received.
   However, the FDA said that at the time the drug was approved the
agency was aware of a variety of adverse effects reported in
association with use of Halcion, including confusion, agitation,
hallucinations, amnesia and bizarre behavior. All except bizarre
behavior were included in label warnings, the FDA said.
   Upjohn spokeswoman Florence Steinberg said the company will
review epidemiological data at the meeting that ``indicate that side
effects with Halcion are not different in number or kind when
compared with other medications in its class.''
   She said the higher number of reports of problems associated with
the drug stem in part from ``sensational allegations in the media
about Halcion,'' including a case in which a Utah woman who was
using the drug was accused of killing her mother. Murder charges
against the woman were dismissed.
   Steinberg said it was never established that Halcion caused the
woman to act as she did and contends the woman was taking a number
of medications at the time.
   The FDA, in seeking the advice of its Psychopharmacologic Drugs
Advisory Committee, did not say how many reports of adverse effects
have been received for Halcion, but said the number is higher than
for other hypnotic drug products. The agency asked the panel to
determine ``the meaning of this relatively high reporting rate and
how this finding might be meaningfully communicated to the medical
and lay public.''
   Analysts quoted in Wednesday editions of The Wall Street Journal
said Halcion sales have been declining apparently because of reports
of adverse reactions to the drug. The newspaper quoted analysts as
estimating that Upjohn's worldwide sales of Halcion were expected to
fall from about $260 million in 1988 to about $235 million this year.

   A USAir 737 carrying 61 people skidded off a
runway at LaGuardia Airport and splashed into the East River late
Wednesday, killing at least two people, after the pilot tried to
abort the takeoff, authorities said.
   ``The pilot seemed to be accelerating but didn't have enough
power to get the plane up,'' said survivor Larry Martin of New York
City, who huddled in blankets with his wife, Valerie.
   ``Something happened and he put on the brakes. The plane took a
dip and the next thing I knew all hell broke loose,'' Martin said.
``People were on top of each other. People were screaming. There was
the smell of gas. Everyone was saying `Get out! Get out! Get out!'''
   Witnesses said the aircraft split into two pieces, with part of
the jetliner suspended out of the water. Some survivors crawled onto
the wing to await their rescue, and some ended up in the water.
   ``They were hanging from the pier, hanging on the wing, hanging
from the front of the plane,'' said police Lt. Larry Johnston.
   Sgt. Jack Casey, a police diver at the crash site, said he
removed two bodies from the plane and heard of a third fatality. But
51 people escaped from the plane unhurt, said Mayor Edward I. Koch,
who was on the scene.
   Stephen Berger, executive director of the Port Authority, said he
knew of only two deaths in the crash.
   Two people were taken to Jamaica Hospital in critical condition,
said Port Authority spokesman Bill Cahill. A third person was in
stable condition at another hospital after suffering a heart attack.
   The pilot tried to abort the takeoff for an unknown reason, said
Kathleen Bergen, spokeswoman for the Federal Aviation Administration
in New York.
   The pilot aborted the takeoff at 11:29 p.m. and the plane skidded
off runway into 25 to 40 feet of water in Bowery Bay, about 50 to
100 feet from the end of the runway built on pilings in the water,
officials said.
   ``The first third of the airplane is resting on the approach
lights,'' said Ms. Bergen. ``The rest of the plane is in the river.''
   Some people were trapped in the plane's tail section and were
removed, said Coast Guard Lt. Cmdr. Paul Milligan.
   Milligan said the plane skidded off the runway during takeoff and
landed in the water, about 2,000 feet from the end of the runway, at
11:35 p.m. EDT.
   Fire officials said survivors were being taken to the Pan Am
Shuttle terminal at LaGuardia. Coast Guard small boats and planes
were on the scene, as well as scores of police and emergency
vehicles.
   A USAir spokeswoman in Arlington, Va., Susan Young, said Flight
5050, a Boeing 737-400, was bound for Charlotte, N.C. She said the
plane carried 55 passengers and a crew of six.
   ``The evacuation of the aircraft was completed at 12:30 a.m. by
raft,'' she said.
   The airplane was scheduled to leave for North Carolina at 7:27
p.m. EDT, but was delayed three hours by heavy rain, as were all
flights into and out of the New York area.
   The plane's engines were apparently cut off halfway down the
runway and went into reverse thrust, said David Hawthorne, a CBS
News producer, who was on the plane.
   ``At that time no one thought there was going to be real
trouble,'' Hawthorne told CBS News via cellular telephone. Hawthorne
said he was sitting near the front of the plane, which split into
two or three pieces.
   ``I was able to get up and start going toward the back,'' he
said. ``A lot of women and children were screaming that they
couldn't swim, they couldn't swim.''
   Rescuers and crew members were trying to keep people calm, he
said.
   ``Most people were pretty calm after we got out onto the wing of
the plane,'' he said. ``And they waited for boats to come pick us up
and the rescuers also arrived and I have to say they did a pretty
good job of keeping everybody calm and getting them safely off.''

<HEAD>Automatic Cuts Looming as Congress Snarled in Partisan Fight</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN KOMAROW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Partisan warfare over cutting the capital gains
tax is part of a budget quagmire that has Congress so steeped in
dispute that the government is threatened with automatic spending
cuts next month.
   Republicans are taking pains in advance to set up the majority
Democrats for the blame.
   At the heart of the political battle is the annual budget bill
designed to reduce the deficit to within the parameters of the
Gramm-Rudman budget law.
   Unless the bill is enacted, the estimated fiscal 1990 deficit
will exceed the $110 billion maximum in Gramm-Rudman's guidelines,
triggering cuts of nearly $17 billion will be ordered on Oct. 15.
Half the cuts would come from the Pentagon and half from civilian
programs.
   But the budget bill is threatened with defeat in the House next
week because most Democrats oppose its cut in the capital gains tax
rate, which they call a giveaway to the rich.
   Republicans, who expect to win on the capital gains issue, may
not vote for the bill either because they want the bill stripped of
other provisions, including child care legislation and a revised
catastrophic insurance plan for the elderly.
   House Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta, D-Calif., predicted
flatly that the automatic cuts ``will go into effect.
   ``The question is how long will they stay in effect'' before the
House, Senate and White House can agree, he said.
   House Minority Whip Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., agreed and said popular
items such as farm subsidies and the space program would be slashed
because Democrats were unable to manage the Congress' agenda.
   Gingrich said Democrats were killing the legislation because they
loaded child care, Medicaid improvements, the Fairness Doctrine for
broadcasters and a host of other issues on the must-pass legislation.
   ``The more they load this up, the more ... likely it will carry
us into'' the automatic cuts, he said.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater told reporters
prospects for averting the cuts were ``somewhat bleak,'' and it was
up to the Democratic-controlled Congress to overcome the problems.
   With debate less than a week away, House Democratic leaders
decided Wednesday it would fight Bush's capital gains cut with a tax
alternative of their own _ raising rates for society's wealthiest in
order to give new tax breaks for individual retirement accounts.
   The plan is similar to one offered earlier this month by Senate
Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, including a
provision which would allow IRA savings to be used without penalty
for education or first-time home purchases.
   Most House Democrats adamantly oppose the amendment approved in
the House Ways and Means Committee which would cut the maximum
capital gains tax rate from 33 percent to 19.6 percent.
   Much of their anger is directed at Bush, who Democrats believe
has pushed his tax-cut campaign promise ahead of his commitment to
work together to reduce the deficit.
   ``This dispute on capital gains is undercutting the kind of
cooperation'' needed to tackle the deficit, said Panetta.
   The capital gains dispute was also exposing rifts within
Democratic ranks. Not only were some conservatives siding with the
GOP on capital gains, but liberals were pushing House Speaker Thomas
S. Foley for an all-out brawl instead of a compromise.
   ``The troops that want to get on their horses and charge are
growing impatient,'' said Rep. David Nagle, D-Iowa.
   ``This capital gains issue will test the legendary Tom Foley
thoughtfulness,'' said Rep. Pat Williams, D-Mont. ``And a lot of
people are watching to see if he'll pass the test.''
   Aside from the deficit-reduction legislation, the House passed
all 13 of its annual appropriations bills before the August recess.
But only one has been forwarded to the president's desk because
action in the Senate has been stalled over the drug controversy.
   Acknowledging the mess, the House Appropriations Committee has
tentatively scheduled a meeting next Tuesday to approve a 31-day
interim spending bill which would prevent the government from
shutting down Oct. 1.

   Presidential assailant John Hinckley is still
collecting material on actress Jodie Foster and thinks mass murderer
Charles Manson is a ``cool dude,'' according to the government.
   Government lawyers, opposing Hinckley's request to talk with the
news media, on Wednesday produced letters he wrote last year
thanking a man for sending him a semi-nude caricature of Miss Foster
that Hinckley had requested.
   The letters were read into the court record after Hinckley, who
wants to meet with reporters to prove he is sane, testified he
hadn't been ``obsessed, fixated (or) preoccupied'' with Miss Foster
for five or six years.
   Hinckley has ``consistently told us he had no thoughts about
Jodie Foster,'' testified psychiatrist Dr. Raymond Patterson. `These
writings tell us that is not true.''
   Hinckley said after his arrest in the March 1981 assassination
attempt on President Reagan that his action was an effort to attract
Miss Foster.
   Psychiatrists treating Hinckley were unaware of the recent
letters until they were turned over by the U.S. attorney's office,
Patterson said. The Secret Service obtained the letters after
Hinckley sent them.
   U.S. District Court Judge June Green is considering Hinckley's
request to conduct up to two interviews a month with the news media.
The hearing resumes Monday.
   ``Mr. Hinckley's concern is on (ABC TV's) `Prime Time,' not on
his mental health,'' testified Patterson, who said Hinckley suffers
from a narcissistic personality disorder, characterized as a severe
mental illness.
   Patterson said a symptom of Hinckley's illness is an inability to
draw distinctions between the famous and infamous.
   In his letter, read in court by Patterson, Hinckley thanked the
man for the caricature, then referred to Manson.
   ``I am not a follower, but he is one cool dude,'' Hinckley said
of Manson, leader of a cult whose members killed actress Sharon Tate
and six others in 1969. Miss Tate was eight months pregnant when she
was murdered.
   Patterson testified that Hinckley made references to Adolf Hitler
``as recently as yesterday.'' The psychiatrist did not elaborate.
   At the hearing, Janet Maher, a lawyer for the mental hospital
where Hinckley is staying, asked Hinckley whether he told
psychiatrists that he considered himself ``Hitler's successor.''
Hinckley replied he had not informed the psychiatrists. Maher did
not pursue that line of questioning further.
   Hinckley was acquitted by reason of insanity in the shooting of
President Reagan, White House press secretary James Brady, a
Washington police officer and a Secret Service agent. The shooting
left Brady partially paralyzed.
   St. Elizabeths Hospital where Hinckley is a patient bars
maximum-security patients from conducting interviews with the media.
It does permit such patients to correspond with reporters by mail.

<HEAD>Senate Readies Poland Aid Package</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate is ready to dispatch beefed-up U.S.
economic aid to Poland's first non-communist government in four
decades.
   In addition, the Democrats who control both the Senate and House
are signaling their willingness to fight for an aid package far more
potent than anything President Bush has so far proposed or than the
$45 million initiative in the pending aid bill.
   The Senate readied the $14.4 billion appropriations measure for
certain passage in a series of votes on amendments Wednesday. Final
action was postponed pending agreement on an unrelated anti-drug
package.
   The Senate Appropriations Committee included the bolstered aid
for Poland in the bill after contending that $10 million in economic
aid initially proposed by Bush was ``totally inadequate'' to
demonstrate U.S. support for Poland's surging economic and political
reform movement.
   Democrats on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee raised the
hackles of GOP members Wednesday as they contended the Bush aid
proposal is ``pathetically timid.''
   With all but one Republican member boycotting, and ignoring
arguments that the money is not available, the committee voted 10 to
1 to authorize spending nearly $1.2 billion over three years in
economic assistance for both Poland and Hungary.
   The keystone of the Democratic initiative is the creation of
economic development funds for both countries. The Polish fund would
be authorized at $300 million for each of the three years; the fund
for Hungary at $75 million a year.
   House Democrats also indicated their willingness on Wednesday to
substantially increase aid to Poland.
   ``I believe we should give the administration everything it has
asked for _ and then do more,'' Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., told the
House Foreign Affairs Committee. ``If we do not come to Poland's
aid, how can we expect others to make the sacrifices necessary to
obtain freedom and democracy?''
   Rep. Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., the House majority leader, said
Congress must find ways to rise above the nation's budget crunch and
provide assistance to Poland and Hungary equal to the historic
nature of their apparent transformation from communist rule.
   ``Now is not the time for the niceties of bookkeeping; now is the
time for imagination and innovation,'' Gephardt said. ``Visionaries
do not wear green eyeshades.''
   Acting on amendments to the overall foreign aid bill, the Senate
voted Wednesday to boost aid to El Salvador to $90 million after
appeals to give the country's new president ``a chance to succeed.''
   Voting 67-33, the legislators removed from the bill a provision
that would have cut the aid into three installments to be made
available at four-month intervals, with Congress given virtual veto
power over the last installment.
   The Senate then voted to peg U.S. military aid to El Salvador at
$90 million, a $5 million boost.
   Opponents of the restrictions contended that they represented an
unwarranted slap at the government of Salvadoran President Alfredo
Cristiani at a time when there is a chance to end a ten-year civil
war.
   Cristiani was sworn in June 1 as the victorious candidate of the
rightist Arena party.
   ``It will be a blow to him politically, at the very moment _ the
very hour _ when we ought to be encouraging him to go forward,''
said Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., who joined a rare
liberal-conservative alliance to oppose the restrictions.
   Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., and other senators contended that the
Arena Party has been linked to death-squad activity in the past and
has failed to totally stamp out human rights abuses.
   The annual foreign aid spending bill pays for programs to bolster
the military forces of friendly nations and to support economic
development in poor countries.

   Here is a transcript of Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard Shevardnadze's remarks to reporters on arriving at Andrews
Air Force Base on Wednesday. Shevardnadze's remarks were translated
by his interpreter.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Q: Can you tell us what you're bringing?
   Shevardnadze: Well, I am bringing a lot of paper. But they are
interesting papers.
   Q: Are they surprises?
   Shevardnadze: I would not call them surprises, but we have
serious proposals. I've brought a letter from Mikhail Gorbachev to
President Bush and I would like to say that we have come to
Washington at a very important stage in the development of
Soviet-U.S. relations, also at a time when major very important,
fundamental changes are taking place in the Soviet society and when
many things are changing in the East-West relationship.
   And we have to state that to a large extent those changes in the
East-West relationship result from the changes from the positive
developments in Soviet-U.S. relations. But we believe that we should
not stand still. We should not mark time. We should move forward.
The experience that we have gained thus far permits us to hope that
there will be further movement.
   President Bush has mentioned the possibility of a new closeness
between the Soviet Union and the U.S. and I would add that we have
to move from a level of mutual understanding to a level of working
together to a level of partnership wherever this is possible. So
this is what we are bringing with us to Washington. My meeting with
the president is tomorrow. We shall begin discussions with the
secretary of state.
   Mikhail Gorbachev's letter contains some very important
proposals, specifically, mostly on arms control and on reducing the
military standoff between our two countries. And those proposals, I
have no doubt, serve to remove most of the obstacles holding up
progress and an agreement in Geneva, in Vienna at conventional arms
discussions, also at the negotiations on a convention banning
chemical weapons and nuclear testing talks and so on. And of course,
we will be reporting to you more specifically during the talks and
after them.
   Q: Mr. Shevardnadze, are you going to tell the president that you
wish the pace, the progress of U.S.-Soviet relations would quicken?
Has he been too cautious?
   Shevardnadze: Well, I do believe that we have reason to say that
the pace of the development of Soviet-American relations has to
quicken. That would serve the interest of our two countries, the
Soviet Union and the U.S., and the interests of the world. Thank you.

<HEAD>Virgin Islands Governor Says He Did Not Request Troops</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Virgin Islands Gov. Alexander Farrelly says he
didn't ask for the troops sent by President Bush to his islands in
the wake of looting related to Hurricane Hugo.
   Interviewed by AP Network News from his offices in Charlotte
Amalie, Farrelly said his office had spoken to officials in
Washington about the possibility of requesting troops, ``and we got
the impression that if we asked for help we would get it.''
   But asked whether he had in fact sought federal help in restoring
order, Farrelly said, ``We have not done so yet.''
   White House spokesman Steve Hart, informed of Farrelly's remarks,
said, ``That's contrary to the information I have.'' Hart said the
White House would stand by its earlier statement, which said that
Farrelly had requested the federal troops.
   Bush ordered two military police battalions and a headquarters
unit totaling about 1,100 men to the islands to restore order. There
have been unconfirmed reports that National Guard troops joined
looters in the islands.
   Regarding reports of looting and rioting, the governor said:
``There is some looting, no doubt about that. But there is no near
state of anarchy. And I should know. I'm in the streets every day
and I'm the governor of this territory.''

<HEAD>Study Links Overnight Contact Wear with Dangerous Eye Ulcers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   People who sleep wearing contact lenses face 10-15
times the usual risk of potentially blinding eye ulcers, researchers
warned today.
   But many eye doctors already discourage patients from routinely
wearing their lenses to bed.
   ``You significantly increase the risk of complications when you
wear any contact lens overnight, and the more nights you wear it in
a row, the greater the risk,'' said Dr. Ronald E. Smith of the
University of Southern California.
   So-called extended-wear lenses are designed to be kept in the eye
for several days at a time. When approved in 1980, they were
recommended for use up to one month. But because of concern about
complications, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration reduced the
limit last May to one week.
   By then, however, many eye doctors already had grown suspicious
of the safety of wearing lenses to bed, in part because they began
seeing the usually rare eye ulcers in patients fitted with
extended-wear lenses.
   ``My recommendation to patients is that if it is not terribly
inconvenient for you, and you don't mind doing it, I would prefer
you to remove your lenses'' at night, said Dr. Lee Rigel of East
Lansing, Mich., chairman of contact lens section of the American
Optometric Association.
   ``I encourage my patients to try to wear them on a daily-wear
basis and avoid wearing their lenses overnight,'' said Dr. Scott M.
MacRae of the Oregon Health Sciences University. ``It's easy to
start wearing a lens for one night and having it turn into 10
nights.''
   The latest research estimates that about 12,000 contact-lens
users in the United States suffer corneal ulcers each year, largely
because they wear their lenses to bed.
   The studies also showed, however, that even ordinary daytime use
of contacts _ while far safer than overnight wear _ seems to
slightly raise the odds of these ulcers.
   The research found that people who use extended-wear lenses day
and night were 10 to 15 times more likely than strictly daytime
users to have eye ulcers. Sleeping with ordinary soft lenses just
twice a month resulted in nine times the usual risk of the disease.
   ``Our paper shows that overnight wear is the major risk factor,''
said Dr. Oliver D. Schein. ``It begins with even the first night of
overnight wear. To some extent there is a risk with any kind of
contact lens wear, whether they are hard or soft, worn daily or
extended.''
   The study also found that the level of lens care among users was
``alarmingly low.'' While it suggested that proper cleaning helped
reduce the hazards of extended-wear contacts, it did not eliminate
the risk.
   Spokesman Richard Kase of Bausch and Lomb, a contact lens
manufacturer, said his company believes extended-wear contacts are
safe, but the research ``will reinforce the importance of
remembering that these are medical devices. They need to be taken
care of.''
   The research was conducted by Schein, an ophthalmologists at
Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary in Boston, and Eugene C. Poggio,
a biostatistician at Abt Associates in Cambridge. It was financed by
contact lens manufacturers and published in the New England Journal
of Medicine.
   An estimated 18 million Americans wear contact lenses. Of these,
9 million wear ordinary soft contacts, 4 million use extended-wear
soft lenses and the rest wear hard or rigid gas-permeable lenses.
   The researchers looked for links between contact lenses and
ulcerative keratitis, or ulcers of the cornea, the transparent
tissue that covers the eyeball. These ulcers may puncture the
cornea, causing permanent blindness, or leave scars that partially
block or blur sight.
   They estimate that 22 to 32 cases of these ulcers occur annually
for each 10,000 people who use extended-wear lenses overnight, and 2
to 3 cases occur per 10,000 daily-wear users.
   Schein said the ulcers are almost unheard of unless people wear
contacts or have some other clear risk factor, such as an eye injury.
   The researchers estimated that each year in the United States,
there are 8,000 cases of corneal ulcers among users of extended wear
contacts and 4,000 among those who use daily-wear lenses.
   ``Although contact lenses are safe for the majority of users and
offer certain visual and cosmetic advantages over eyeglasses,'' they
wrote, ``both professionals and the public should know that contact
lenses are not innocuous and that their use can lead to permanent
adverse effects.''

<HEAD>Financial Leaders to Face Soviets, Chinese Questions</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Requests from the Soviet Union for membership
and from China for more money were facing members of the World Bank
and the International Monetary Fund at the beginning of their annual
meetings.
   Financial leaders from 152 countries were opening the meetings of
the twin organizations today, with representatives from 24
debt-strapped developing nations planning to meet behind closed
doors to discuss their concerns.
   President Bush is scheduled to address all the leaders next week.
   High on the agenda this year is the request by the Soviet Union
for membership in the two lending organizations, which would bring
Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev's government a greater role in
world affairs outside his nation's allies. The United States has
opposed membership for Moscow.
   There have been suggestions recently that the IMF and World Bank
should concentrate in the next decade on bringing the Soviet Union
into the economic framework of the non-communist world.
   Membership would also allow the Soviet Union to claim loans from
the twin organizations.
   In advance of the Washington meetings, World Bank President
Barber Conable announced Wednesday that he intends to resume new
loans to China in the near future, but refused to name a date.
   China, the bank's largest borrower after India, has been getting
$2 billion in loans a year. But Conable suspended consideration of
$780 million in new loans after the Chinese government's bloody
crackdown on pro-democracy forces in June. The bank has continued to
disburse loans granted to China in the past.
   In addition to the Soviet and Chinese matters, delegates were
expected to discuss:
   _the Third World's $1.3 trillion debt, and the progress of
Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady's plan for reducing the burden.
Agreements have been tentatively reached for Mexico and the
Philippines, but the problem of Brazil, the Third World's biggest
debtor, has not yet been tackled. Brady will be the chief U.S.
representative at the meetings.
   _how to deal financially with the worsening state of the
environment, especially in developing countries.
   _Conable's bid for $14.5 billion in contributions to make easy
loans over three years to about 35 countries where the average
income is only about $1 a day or less.
   ``These are the poorest of the poor,'' he told reporters
Wednesday.

<TEXT>
   Federal drug czar William Bennett
went outside with a bullhorn to give his anti-drug message to
schoolchildren after a bomb threat forced police to evacuate an
elementary school.
   No bomb was found and Police Chief Richard Vaughn said he
believed the threat was a prank. Bennett didn't consider it a
laughing matter.
   ``It's a sad thing. This is what drugs have done to this
country,'' Bennett said after Wednesday afternoon's assembly at
Chambers Elementary School.
   Anyone who would make such a threat to harm children is ``small
and petty and wicked,'' he said.
   Bennett spoke to more than 700 pupils and 45 faculty members at
the school. It was the last in a series of meetings with Ohio
mayors, ministers and officials in which Bennett outlined the Bush
administration's four-pronged, $7.9 billion proposal to fight drug
abuse.
   Bennett said he plans to carry his anti-drug message to all 50
states before Thanksgiving.
   Funding for police departments in poor neighborhoods must be
increased to protect the majority of residents who are not drug
users, he said.
   ``Good education, rehabilitation and job training programs are
not going to fluorish if the bad guys control the streets,'' Bennett
said. ``We need as a matter of national policy to build more
prisons.''

<HEAD>Pierce Faces Subpoena to Testify in HUD Probe</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto WX9</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An attorney for Samuel R. Pierce Jr. says the
former HUD secretary is deciding whether he will testify as demanded
by a subpoena from a congressional panel.
   ``We are forced to review each and every option,'' including
whether to the refuse to answer questions by invoking his Fifth
Amendment right against self-incrimination, said attorney Paul L.
Perito.
   A House Government Operations subcommittee voted unanimously
Wednesday to subpoena Pierce to testify about alleged
influence-peddling and mismanagement at the Housing and Urban
Development Department he once headed.
   Pierce was ordered to appear on three separate occasions _ the
first before the employment and housing subcommittee. He faces
contempt of Congress proceedings if he does not appear.
   Pierce provoked anger among the panel members when he demanded a
third delay on the eve of his scheduled voluntary testimony last
Friday.
   ``I think the subcommittee had no option,'' said subcommittee
Chairman Tom Lantos, D-Calif. ``The subcommittee had an agreement
with Mr. Pierce ... That agreement was broken unilaterally by Mr.
Pierce.''
   Perito, said Pierce _ who appeared voluntarily before the panel
in May _ was willing to testify but needed another two weeks' time
for preparation.
   In a letter to the panel received before the vote, he said: ``We
believe the subcommittee's vindictive and punitive actions in
denying Mr. Pierce adequate time to obtain and review pertinent
documents and in insisting on use of subpoenas are taken in
retaliation against Mr. Pierce's exercise of his constitutional
right.''
   Republicans and Democrats alike rejected that claim, saying
Pierce had months of time for preparation _ even though Pierce said
he only hired a lawyer this month.
   ``Rather than coming forth and clearing the record ... he is
toying with the subcommittee in order to evade or avoid his
responsibility,'' said Rep. Ted Weiss, D-N.Y.
   Congressional staff attorneys said refusal by a former Cabinet
official to testify could appear to invite efforts to appoint a
special prosecutor under the law providing for a court-appointed
independent counsel to handle investigations of current or former
top executive branch officials.
   Already, some House members are calling for a special prosecutor
or suggested one would be needed if the Justice Department does not
clarify whether it is investigating possible criminal violations by
former HUD officials who are principals in the subcommittee's
investigation.
   The subpoenas call for Pierce to appear next Tuesday, followed by
other appearances on Oct. 27 and Nov. 3. Lantos said the dates could
be changed at his discretion, and he raised the possibility that
further testimony by Pierce could be required.
   Lantos said because of Pierce's actions, he no longer felt bound
by their previous agreement to limit the scope of the subcommittee's
questioning to three matters: Pierce's previous voluntary testimony
of May 25; his actions involving a Durham, N.C., housing project;
and the case involving DRG Corp., which conducted mortgage
coinsurance business with HUD and left the government with huge
defaults.
   Since Pierce appeared before the panel in May, subcommittee
members say inconsistencies and contradictions in his testimony have
emerged.

   Thousands of Cambodians threw
Vietnamese troops flowers today as Hanoi began a pledged final
withdrawal from an 11-year war against resistance forces its
superior firepower could not suppress.
   In the government-organized ceremony, vehicles carrying thousands
of soldiers bearing rifles rumbled out of this northwestern province
after a band played pop music. A commander waved flowers in the lead.
   Vietnam says it is conducting a six-day withdrawal of its last
26,000 troops from Siem Reap and several other areas of the country.
But opposing guerrilla forces charge that Vietnam is faking the
troop movement and actually hiding and disguising its troops.
   Vietnam invaded Cambodia on Christmas Day 1978 and within two
weeks toppled the fanatical Communist Khmer Rouge regime, installing
a pro-Hanoi government in the capital of Phnom Penh.
   During its four-year rule, the Khmer Rouge killed hundreds of
thousands of Cambodians as it tried at the point of a gun to turn
the country into an agrarian commune. It also launched bloody
attacks on the Vietnamese border.
   At the height of its conflict with Cambodian guerrillas, Vietnam
had 200,000 men in the country, according to Vietnamese officers.
   They say Hanoi began annual partial pullouts in 1982 and that
55,300 Vietnamese died fighting the Cambodians, 25,000 of them in
1977 and 1978.
   The invasion also brought economic blockades by non-Communist
countries that kept Vietnam one of the world's poorest counties.
   With the collapse of peace talks in Paris last month, the pullout
would leave the Phnom Penh government fighting a coalition of up to
50,000 guerrillas backed by China, Thailand and other countries.
   Each side claims the other has received increased shipments of
arms in recent months.
   Phnom Penh's Prime Minister Hun Sen returned home today after
talks in Thailand on arranging a cease-fire and said it was now up
to the guerrillas to agree to halt fighting.
   Maj. Gen. Huol Savorn, commander of Cambodia's 4th Army Region,
said he expected a major guerrilla offensive after the pullout of
the some 10,000 soldiers of ``Front 479'' from Siem Reap, Battambang
and Oddar Meanchey provinces. These malarial, jungled Thai border
provinces are among those most strongly contested by the guerrillas.
   ``They are going to fight a lot'' to try to occupy border areas
before striking inland, he told reporters.
   ``But they will not be able to achieve this,'' he said. ``With
the equipment that they have, they can only carry out hit-and-run
attacks. The main thing is they don't have enough food and
equipment.''
   He said the guerrillas were outnumbered three to one, and they
had different aims and refused to cooperate with each other.
   The Paris talks failed to agree on international monitoring of
the troop movement, and the only official foreign observers seen in
Siem Reap were from Vietnam and its close allies Laos, Cuba and the
Soviet Union.
   Of the absence of Western observers, Soviet delegate and Foreign
Ministry official Genrich Kinreed said ``it was astonishing why they
insisted (on international monitoring) but didn't come.'' His
four-member team was led by Suleimenov Oljas, member of the Supreme
Soviet, or parliament.
   A four-member team Soviet was led by Suleimenov Oljas, member of
the Supreme Soviet, or the parliament.
   About 50 journalists from non-Communist countries watched the
troop movement.
   The Cambodians bade the soldiers farewell in a two-hour ceremony
on the rain-soaked gravel road outside a kindergarten built by
Vietnamese soldiers.
   Banners expressing sadness at the troops' departure and hopes for
continued Vietnamese-Cambodian ``solidarity'' were raised by groups
of students, soldiers, and schoolchildren wearing red kerchiefs _
the ``young pioneers'' of the ruling Cambodian Communist Party. They
sweated under a hot sun.
   On a wooden stage with the military officers, four Buddhist monks
in flowing saffron robes chanted prayers for peace.
   Cambodian and Vietnamese officials took turns with speeches that
denounced Khmer Rouge ``genocide'' and claimed the guerrillas cannot
take any territory.
   Maj. Gen. Khieu Anh Lon, commander of Front 479, hugged a
Cambodian commander in front of a blue banner displaying the
national emblems of Vietnam's yellow star and Cambodia's Angkor Wat
temple.
   A young pioneer gave him her kerchief while three women in
traditional costumes presented a bouquet of flowers.
   The general walked down the muddied road where the army vehicles
were waiting, picked up a young boy, and climbed into his
weather-beaten U.S.-made jeep to begin the withdrawal.
   The troops carried back bamboo mats, water jugs, guitars, even
yawning dogs and a monkey on their trucks, buses and armored
personnel carriers.
   ``We are very happy to be leaving,'' said Maj. Duong Chu Viet,
whose chest pocket was crowded with medals. ``We feel Cambodians can
defend their own country.''
   The soldiers, whose intervention sparked fighting that killed
tens of thousands of people and split almost all Asia into two
hostile camps, smiled and waved yellow and purple flowers as they
disappeared down the road.
   At a press conference Wednesday in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, the
defense ministry's chief spokesman refused to rule out fighting
another war in Cambodia.
   If the Khmer Rouge threatened the Phnom Penh government's rule
and asked Vietnam for assistance, the Vietnamese army ``would then
announce its decision,'' said Maj. Gen. Nguyen Van Thai.

   New York's Puerto Rican community, which is
larger than San Juan's, is reaching out to its hurricane-shattered
homeland with medicine, supplies and money.
   Hurricane Hugo caused hundreds of millions of dollars worth of
destruction and damaged the homes of 50,000 people when it swept
through the island Sunday, according to Gov. Rafael Hernandez Colon
of Puerto Rico.
   In New York _ home to about 1.5 million people of Puerto Rican
descent _ churches, city officials, pop music stars and others are
collecting money and supplies to send. About 1.1 million of the
island's 3.7 million residents live in the capital of San Juan.
   ``My office has been inundated by the calls and visits. People
just want to help,'' Bronx Borough President Fernando Ferrer said
Wednesday.
   Ferrer had tried in vain to reach his grandmother, aunts and
uncles in Puerto Rico after the storm. They finally called Wednesday.
   ``All is well,'' Ferrer said. ``But now there are a lot of other
aunts and uncles who need some help.''
   The Department of Puerto Rican Community Affairs, a Manhattan
office of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, is coordinating the
relief effort.
   The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York asked its churches to
collect money this weekend for relief work throughout the Caribbean.
The hurricane struck the U.S. Virgin Islands, Montserrat, Guadeloupe
and Antigua as well as Puerto Rico.
   Branches of Banco Popular de Puerto Rico, Banco de Ponce and
Manufacturers Hanover Trust are accepting donations for disaster aid
in Puerto Rico. Banco Popular also will do the accounting for a
telethon to be broadcast Sunday over two local Spanish-language
television channels.
   Drummer Tito Puente and singers Lisa Lisa and Iris Chacon are
scheduled to perform at a benefit concert at Nassau Coliseum in the
New York City suburb of Uniondale Sunday to raise $250,000 for the
hurricane victims.
   St. Barnabas Hospital in the Bronx plans to send two doctors and
three nurses to Puerto Rico to provide medical services and seek out
relatives of staff members. Hospital employees already have raised
$20,000.
   ``We're a community hospital and we have a large Hispanic
population and many of our employees have families there,'' said
Maria Zito, a hospital spokeswoman.
   Parishioners from Our Lady Queen of Angels in Spanish Harlem
started a food drive and took to the streets for donations.
   Rev. Michael Sevigny, the pastor, said many parishioners are
worried about relatives.
   ``Some are still waiting for information,'' Sevigny said.
``People have been gathering in front of the church after liturgies
and talking about what they have learned.''
   The Rev. Nicanor Lana, pastor of Spanish Harlem's Holy Rosary
Church, also has held masses and collected canned food and money.
The cash and goods will go directly to churches run by the
Augustinian Order, which runs Holy Rosary.
   ``We have our own men there,'' Lana said. ``They know much better
the situation there. We are going to deliver them into the right
hands.''
   Ferrer said among the items he was asked to find for the relief
effort are 200 chainsaws.
   ``I don't know where I'm going to find them,'' he said, ``but
I'll try.''

   A Soviet military helicopter on a police raid to
destroy opium poppy fields in Central Asia crashed and exploded in
flames, killing four of the 15 people aboard, the Tass news agency
reported today.
   The Mi-8 copter was about to land in mountains near the fabled
city of Samarkand in Uzbekistan when a gust of wind threw if off
course and onto rocks, N. Sattarov, a senior Interior Ministry
official in Samarkand, was quoted as saying.
   Most of the passengers escaped through the middle and tail
sections of the chopper but could do nothing to help those trapped
inside as fire broke out and the craft exploded, killing four
people, Tass said.
   Survivors of the Wednesday crash were evacuated and given medical
treatment, Tass said. It said the crash's cause was under
investigation.
   The Mi-8 was taking part in a police operation to destroy poppy
fields cultivated by local drug producers, Tass said. Major raids to
eradicate poppy growing in Soviet Central Asia have been mounted
since Mikhail S. Gorbachev became Soviet leader 4{ years ago.
   Samarkand, located 1,700 miles southeast of Moscow, was once the
most important cultural center of Central Asia, the capital of the
14th-century Oriental conqueror Tamerlane and a trading center on
the Silk Road to China.
   It was annexed by Russia in 1868.

<NOTE>Report Says Fighter Defects Undermine Combat Readiness</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Test equipment the Air Force uses to determine
the effectiveness of radar-warning receivers and other electronics
on tactical fighters has been faulty and unreliable, a new report
says.
   The General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress,
said Wednesday that the problems with the test equipment undermine
the combat readiness of the aircraft and the ability of the planes
to fly combat missions.
   The aircraft are equipped with electronic warfare systems
consisting of a radar-warning receiver that alerts the pilot when
his airplane is being tracked by enemy radar and a jammer that
transmits signals to deceive enemy radar.
   The GAO study found that at five tactical units in the United
States, Europe and Asia, almost half of about 455 jammers the Air
Force deemed ready for combat had undetected defects.
   ``The cost for this kind of carelessness can be staggering,''
said Rep. John Conyers Jr., D-Mich., the chairman of the House
Government Operations subcommittee on legislation and national
security, which had requested the GAO report. ``And the risk it
poses to our national security and to the lives of our pilots is
simply unacceptable.''
   The study attributed the problems to the Air Force's acquisition
process. In one instance, the Air Force purchased 72 test sets at a
cost of $272 million before testing them.

<NOTE>Panel Says Tests Of Genetically-Modified Plants, Microbes Safe</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Field testing of genetically modified plants
and microorganisms ``will not pose any hazard'' to the environment
if done carefully under existing laws, says a National Academy of
Sciences panel.
   Genetically engineered plants and microbes are ``not
intrinsically dangerous,'' the panel concluded in a study released
Wednesday. But the experts said field tests should be allowed only
after evaluating the effect on the environment if the modified
organism were to ``escape'' from the test area.
   ``We feel fairly confident that if this thing is done right, it
will not pose any hazard,'' said Robert H. Burris, an emeritus
professor of biochemistry from the University of Wisconsin. ``We
hope that this will be reassuring to the public.''
   Jeremy Rifkin of the Foundation on Economic Trends, a longtime
opponent of field testing of genetically-altered organisms, called
the report ``irresponsible public policy.'' He said science has no
way to evaluate the risks of releasing such organisms into the
environment.
   Burris, who was chairman of the academy's committee on evaluation
of introduction of gene-modified microorganisms and plants, that
some 80 modified plants and microbes have been tested in the
environment and ``we haven't had any accidents as yet.''

<HEAD>Showers, Thunderstorms Along Atlantic Coast</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Showers and thunderstorms fell on the Atlantic coast today as
Hurricane Hugo moved slowly toward the U.S. mainland.
   A cold front extending from Minnesota into Wyoming and Colorado
produced some rain and wind in the high plains.
   Hugo, whose winds were clocked at 105 mph, was well offshore
early today. But its leading edge brought rain from North Carolina
to Florida.
   On Wednesday, showers and thunderstorms struck along the Atlantic
coast from South Carolina to New England. More than 1{ inches of
rain fell in New York city and similar amounts were reported in
Newark, N.J., and near Philadelphia.
   Elsewhere, flooding continued Wednesday along the Wabash and
White rivers in Indiana, with rivers up to 6 feet above flood stage.
   A cold front in the Plains produced scattered rain, and 1 to 4
inches of snow was expected to fall overnight in the Wind River
Mountains of Wyoming.
   The front brought winds up to 64 mph Wednesday at Fort Morgan,
Colo., where the temperature plunged from the 80s to the mid-50s in
just an hour.
   Temperatures Wednesday reached into the 80s across the southern
and central Plains, the 90s in south-central Texas and the 80s and
90s across Florida and the desert Southwest. Clouds and rain kept
temperatures in the 60s in the upper Mississippi valley and in the
northern Atlantic states.

   The dollar fell sharply against the Japanese yen
today, while the Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index rose.
   The dollar closed at 145.00 yen, down 1.25 yen from Wednesday's
146.25-yen finish. It opened at 144.90 yen and ranged between 144.82
yen and 145.25 yen.
   It had gained 0.52 yen on Wednesday but opened sharply lower in
Tokyo today after declining overnight on overseas markets on
speculation that West Germany's central bank might raise interest
rates.
   As the Tokyo market awaited the Bundesbank's scheduled meeting
later today, exchange dealings were slow, said Toru Kanai, a foreign
exchange analyst with New Japan Securities Co.
   Spot volume was estimated at $5.6 billion.
   ``Participants slowed their dollar buying only temporarily prior
to the West German Bundesbank meeting and the G-7,'' Kanai said,
referring to the meeting of the Group of Seven industrialized
nations. ``After all, the dollar will remain strong.''
   At the G-7 meeting, market players are watching for any measures
to curb the dollar's strength.
   The weekend meeting in Washington will bring together the finance
ministers of Japan, the United States, West Germany, Britain, Italy,
France and Canada.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues gained 274.44
points today, or 0.80 percent, closing at 34,745.02. It had lost
0.49 points the previous day.
   The index began rising soon after the market opened as investors
were reassured by the yen's overnight jump against the dollar,
dealers said.
   It rose further in the afternoon on investment trusts' buying of
small amounts of a wide variety of issues, but institutional
investors remained reluctant to make major moves ahead of the
international monetary talks, said a dealer with a major securities
firm in Tokyo, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Masahiro Umemori, a stock analyst with Nomura Securities, said,
``Participants were buying supermarket issues considering that
reorganization and easing regulations on large-scale retail stores
could be positive steps to improve U.S.-Japan structural problems.''
   Trading was thin, with first-section volume estimated at 650
million shares, up from 600 million Wednesday. Among gainers were
supermarket, department store, bank and shipbuilding shares.

<DATELINE>SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   By the thousands, residents armed
with jugs and buckets scrambled for water in this hurricane-stricken
city while authorities opened fire hydrants and delivered water in
tank trucks.
   Gov. Rafael Hernandez Colon said late Wednesday that he feared
the prolonged power outage could cause pose a health hazard as
residents discard spoiled food in the street in 90-degree heat.
   Trash collectors have not worked since before Hurricane Hugo hit
Monday.
   Power began returning to many San Juan neighborhoods late
Wednesday and all power should be restored by today, said Esteban
Romero, assistant director of the island's Electrical Energy
Authority.
   However, tens of thousands of residents of eastern Puerto Rico
will not have water or electricity until early October, he said.
   Seventy percent of the Caribbean island, a U.S. commonwealth of
3.3 million, was without water Wednesday. The power authority was
working at 40 percent capacity, Romero said.
   Hernandez Colon said the government's priority was to find
temporary housing for an estimated 129,000 people whose homes were
either destroyed or severely damaged by Hugo.
   Coast Guard and National Guard cargo planes were flying food,
water and other supplies to the offshore islands of Culebra and
Vieques, the hardest hit parts of Puerto Rico, where up to 80
percent of the homes were destroyed.
   In Vieques, Gloria Roman, 60, said she watched her wooden house
being demolished by Hugo as she sat in a neighbor's cement house.
   ``I wanted to cry and scream, but I couldn't,'' she said.
   Her dog, who used to guard the house, sat in front of the ruins.
   Mayor Manuela Santiago Collazo said half of Vieques' 8,000
residents were homeless. She said virtually all the wooden houses
were wiped out.
   The Red Cross director of disaster services, Scotti McNulty, said
from Alexandria, Va., that a team of 50 relief specialists would
arrive in Puerto Rico today.
   Supplies of bottled water in San Juan supermarkets were dwindling
and hundreds of residents drove south across the island to Ponce and
west to Arecibo and Mayaguez to stock up on water, ice and gasoline.
   People stood in long lines at National Guard tanker trucks
filling water buckets, and bathed with soap at open fire hydrants.
   ``We've gone three days without washing,'' said one resident,
Olga Perez.
   Police spokesman Baltasar Vazquez said there were several cases
of looting in San Juan and towns in the northeast. ``These people
are taking advantage of the chaos to carry out robberies and
assaults,'' he said.
   Vazquez said there also were reports of youths stopping motorists
to either steal cars or gasoline, ice and other provisions they were
carrying.
   Hundreds of tourists jammed Munoz Marin International Airport,
which reopened Wednesday. Many were turned back because of
overbooked flights.
   Juan Garcia, director of the Association of Insurance Companies,
said insurers expected to receive ``tens of millions of dollars'' in
damage claims.
   Hernandez Colon said damages to the island would be between $100
million and $200 million.
   In Culebra, Mayor Anastasio Soto said: ``There is no way to
estimate the damage. We've been put back 25 years.''
   Conditions were also difficult on islands east of Puerto Rico
that Hugo hit hard. On the British island of Montserrat Chief
Minister John Osborne said the island had only enough food to last
until the end of the week and that rationing might be necessary.
   ``People are hungry, homeless and don't know what to do,'' he
said.
   Officials of the British Virgin Islands reported damage of more
than $150 million. The government said more than a third of the
private homes were ruined on the island of Tortola.
   On Wednesday night, a French helicopter plunged into the
Caribbean about half a mile southeast of the outlying island of
Desirade as it evacuated an islander who suffered head injuries when
Hugo struck, Defense Ministry officials said in Paris.
   The body of the islander, Bertrand Berchel, later washed up on a
beach, they said. Searchers in a helicopter and fishing boats
continued today to look for the eight missing, including Berchel's
son, three medical workers and the twin-engine Puma's crew of four.
   The cause of the accident was unknown. The helicopter had been
based in Point-a-Pitre, Guadeloupe, about six miles west of Desirade.

   More than 500 people overflowed a church
for the funeral of former child abduction victim Steven Stayner,
killed in a motorcycle crash four months after a TV movie depicted
his seven-year ordeal.
   His abduction by a convicted child molester left Stayner scarred,
family and friends said at Wednesday's service.
   ``Steven had a hard time getting his feet back on the ground,
too, because of all the experiences he had. And even when everything
was going well, something would kick him back,'' said Bishop Steve
Tucker, Stayner's minister. ``His dad says, though, that Steven did
the best that he could.''
   Stayner, 24, was killed Saturday when he hit a car that pulled in
front of his motorcycle.
   The motorist, Antonio Loera, 28, fled, but surrendered at the
Mexican border Tuesday night, authorities said. He was arraigned
Wednesday on charges of felony hit-and-run driving and manslaughter.
   Stayner was snatched at age 7 from a Merced street in 1972 by
Kenneth Parnell, 53, and held with lies that his family couldn't
care for him anymore. He resurfaced in March 1980 when he took
another kidnap victim, Timmy White, then 5, to the Ukiah police
station 200 miles north of Stayner's hometown.
   ``When he came home, it was like we had known him all of our
lives, just as though he had never gone. He brought our
broken-hearted family together,'' Stayner's sister, Jody, told
mourners who filled a small Mormon church and adjoining gymnasium.
   But life never again was entirely normal for young Stayner or his
family because of the publicity his case attracted.
   ``When Steven returned after seven years, he was not just mom and
pop's son,'' Tucker said. ``They had to share him with the rest of
the nation. This was hard for them.''
   Stayner's story was depicted in May in an NBC-TV movie, ``I Know
My First Name is Steven.'' But Tucker said the character portrayed
``wasn't the real Steven Stayner. He wasn't rude to his parents. He
was a loving son.''
   Stayner finished high school, married in 1985 and had two
children, now ages 3 and 2.
   Parnell, who had been convicted of child molestation before
Steven's abduction, spent five years in prison for the two
kidnappings before he was released on parole in 1985. He faced no
sex charges in either case, though Steven testified during an 18-day
trial that he was regularly sexually abused.

   The people who wrestled convicted
``Night Stalker'' killer Richard Ramirez to the ground and held him
for police expressed gratitude at his conviction as they relived
that fateful day.
   ``I feel really good, like it is all over now,'' said Faustino
Pinon, one of those who struggled with Ramirez when the killer tried
to steal his daughter's car on Aug. 31, 1985.
   A jury Wednesday convicted Ramirez of 13 murders and 30 felonies.
Jurors also found circumstances that made Ramirez eligible for the
death penalty. A sentencing hearing is pending.
   ``The verdict brought back a lot of memories of that day and I'm
glad it's ended,'' said Pinon, who watched the news of the
conviction on the television in his small wood and stucco home.
   Daughter Gloria watched the news at work, on a small television
set she hid under her desk. ``I just yelled out, `yeah!' when I
heard what's going to happen to him. I think he got what he had
coming,'' she said.
   One neighborhood resident who wasn't watching the television news
was Jose Burgoin, 59, who captured Ramirez with the help of his
sons, Julio, 26, and Jaime, 22.
   He learned of the convictions from a daughter, who called from
work, and several neighbors who stopped by to chat on his wooden
porch.
   ``Well, I knew he was guilty and that he had done many bad
things, and if the court found him guilty, well, that's the way it
is,'' said Burgoin. ``Now he'll have to pay the price.''
   The day of his arrest, Ramirez had been spotted in several nearby
places by people who had recognized his picture from news reports.
   Witnesses called police and officers were sent to the East Los
Angeles areas where he had been sighted.
   On Hubbard Street, Ramirez struggled with Pinon for the Mustang
before giving up and trying to take another car, occupied by Angie
de la Torre.
   Burgoin, who said he was mowing his lawn at the time, saw Mrs. De
la Torre struggling with Ramirez and ran to help. He pulled Ramirez
from the car and he and his sons held him until sheriff's deputies
arrived minutes later.
   Burgoin said he learned after Ramirez' arrest that he had been
sought for a string of slayings that had terrorized California
during the summer of 1985.
   ``It's me! It's me! It's me! I'm lucky the cops caught me,''
Ramirez reportedly shouted in Spanish as he was arrested.
   Word of the arrest spread quickly, and by the time Ramirez
arrived at the police station for questioning, 500 people had
gathered outside shouting, ``Kill him! Kill him!''

   More than one-quarter of male prostitutes studied
in Atlanta were infected with the AIDS virus, and the virus was
especially common among those also exposed to syphilis and
hepatitis, according to a report today.
   Until now, most studies of AIDS among prostitutes have focused on
females.
   In the latest work, researchers took blood samples from 152 male
prostitues. Overall, 27 percent were infected with HIV, the AIDS
virus, as were 55 percent who also had syphilis and 37 percent who
had been exposed to hepatitis B.
   Forty-six percent of the prostitutes described themselves as
being heterosexual. The rest said they were bisexual or homosexual.
   The survey was conducted by Dr. Kirk W. Elifson and colleagues
from Georgia State University. It was published as a letter in the
New England Journal of Medicine.
   ``The rate of HIV-1 infection in our sample suggests the need for
continued educational, drug-treatment and outreach efforts for male
prostitutes and their sexual partners,'' they wrote.

<TEXT>
   The need to keep their offspring cool prompts
Asian bees to produce ``yellow rain,'' excrement the U.S. government
once believed was a Soviet biological weapon, researchers reported
today.
   ``The phenomenon has never been adequately explained. We're
providing an explanation,'' said Peter G. Kevan, a biologist at the
University of Guelph in Canada and co-author of the study published
in Nature, a British science journal.
   During the ``mass defecation flights,'' thousands of Asian giant
honeybees fly in swarms and relieve themselves of hot feces equal to
20 percent of their weight, allowing them to cool their nests more
efficiently to help their offspring grow, the study concluded.
   ``It can be explained by the need to prevent the temperature of
bees' nests becoming so hot as to endanger the larvae,'' wrote Kevan
and Makhdzir Mardan, a biologist at the Agricultural University of
Malaysia.
   In a 1981 speech and 1982 report, then-Secretary of State
Alexander Haig asserted that ``yellow rain'' was a Soviet weapon
derived from fungal toxins and used to kill thousands of people in
Cambodia, Laos and Afghanistan during the 1970s.
   That claim was quickly attacked by Matthew Meselson, a Harvard
University biologist who argued the yellow spots left on plants was
bee excrement.
   In 1987, Meselson and others published an article in Foreign
Policy magazine that ``demolishes definitively'' Haig's claim, the
magazine's editor, Charles William Maynes, said at the time.
   That article, based on declassified documents, revealed that
State Department and Pentagon investigators who visited Asia during
1983-1985 concluded Haig's theory was wrong. Nevertheless, State
Department officials and White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
replied they had no reason to question Haig's assertions.
   The U.S. government made a mistake, Kevan said by phone from
Guelph, about 50 miles west of Toronto. ``It's an embarrassing
mistake, to say the least. One can understand why they don't back
down.''
   He and Mardan took 306 bees from six nests in Asian tropical
forests before and after the insects made mass flights. They killed
the bees, weighed their gut contents and measured the amount of heat
in the bee droppings.
   The study determined that the Asian giant honeybees excrete large
amounts of hot waste during the mass flights. ``It's like somebody
weighing 200 pounds suddenly losing 40 pounds,'' Kevan said, adding
that a colony of 40,000 bees eliminates 1,850 calories of heat
during a single flight.
   This behavior doesn't directly cool the bees, but lets them cool
their nests 35 percent more efficiently through a process known as
``gobbetting,'' which also is used by European honeybees, Kevan said.
   During gobbetting, a bee regurgitates some nectar so some of the
liquid in it evaporates on its tongue. Then, the bee swallows the
cooled nectar.
   ``It's like drinking cold water on a hot day,'' Kevan said.
   The mass defecation flights mean the bees have less body weight
to cool by gobbetting, allowing them to cool themselves and thus
their nests more easily.
   At temperatures much higher or lower than 92 degrees Fahrenheit,
bee larvae growth slows and malformed bees are more likely, Kevan
said.
   Mardan and Kevan found 80 percent of the mass flights happened
when the bee colonies were under the greatest heat stress: during
mornings when temperatures rose most rapidly and during windless
late afternoons.

   Actress Zsa Zsa Gabor testified her
arrest for an expired auto registration tag resembled Nazi Gestapo
tactics and made her think her life was in danger.
   ``I was screaming, `Help, help, help!''' Miss Gabor said
Wednesday during her second day of testimony in her misdemeanor

   The former Hungarian beauty queen, believed to be in her late

knee-length skirt with petticoats _ to court that she wore on June
14, the day she was arrested.
   Miss Gabor testified that during her arrest, she was handcuffed
and ``plunked down'' on the curb next to her Rolls-Royce convertible.
   ``They don't give a damn about me. I was sitting on the floor
half nude,'' she testified.
   She denied threatening to ``call the Reagans'' or demanding that
Officer Paul Kramer, who arrested her, be fired.
   ``I recall somebody chasing me like the Gestapo wanted to shoot
me,'' she said.
   Miss Gabor also launched into a stream of invective against
Kramer.
   ``He was Hitler, Mussolini and Stalin in one,'' she said. ``I
can't believe an American taxpayer can be treated like this for an
expired registration.''
   Miss Gabor is charged with battery on a police officer,
disobeying an officer's orders, driving with an expired license and
having an open container of alcohol (a flask of Jack Daniels whiskey
in the glove compartment) in her car.
   If convicted, she faces a possible 18-month jail sentence.
   On Tuesday, she admitted she scuffled with Kramer after he pulled
her over for having expired license tags. But she said she acted in
self-defense, giving him more of a pat than a slap.

   Striking miners ended a four-day occupation of
a coal processing plant hours after a court-imposed deadline, but
the union said it would use the tactic again to increase pressure on
Pittston Coal Group Inc.
   ``We're going to hurt this company economically,'' Cecil Roberts,
vice president of the United Mine Workers, said after leading the
occupying strikers to a rally outside the plant gates Wednesday
night.
   ``We're going to cut off their production until they wake up and
we're going to do it peacefully,'' he said, adding that the union
could attempt to occupy another Pittston plant as early as next week.
   Ninety-five of Pittston's striking miners along with three union
officials and a religious leader voluntarily ended their occupation
of the seven-story building after ignoring a federal judge's
deadline for a little more than two hours.
   ``We got a lot of miles per gallon out of this effort and we've
got a lot more gas in the tank,'' said Eddie Burke, the union's
southeast regional coordinator and one of those who occupied the
plant.
   A human barricade of 3,000 supporters outside the plant protected
the occupying team. The supporters joined miners and other union
members from throughout Appalachia and the Midwest at a rally in
front of the plant as darkness fell.
   Some state troopers drove off at dusk and law enforcement
authorities let the deadline pass without trying to get inside the
plant.
   The troopers withdrew a short distance down the road ``to let
them have the rally without any interference,'' said Sgt. Mike
Frank, a state police spokesman. He said no specific time had been
set for removing the occupiers.
   Roberts said the union proved its strength without forcing a
confrontation.
   ``We stood the state on its head,'' he said. ``We shocked
Pittston and totally cut off their production at their most
productive processing plant for four days and we did that
non-violently. Everybody stood in the road and locked arms in
solidarity and nobody could do anything with that power.''
   Earlier, U.S. District Judge Glen Williams said the miners would
face no penalties if they left the plant before the deadline.
Otherwise, he said they would lose their $200 a week in UMW strike
benefits and face contempt charges while the union would be fined
$600,000 for each day of the occupation.
   It wasn't clear if they would face penalties for not leaving by
the deadline.
   The unarmed demonstrators stormed the plant Sunday when only a
dozen security officers were on the grounds.
   They barricaded themselves inside the control room and shut down
production at the plant, where coal is cleaned, sorted and shipped.
Replacement workers had been operating the plant since the strike
began in April, although production has been about half of normal.
   Union leaders said they wanted to make a dramatic public
statement about what they consider unfair treatment by the company,
which they contend is trying to break the union.
   Massive fines have taken away all other avenues of peaceful
protest, such as sit-down demonstrations and mass picketing, they
said.
   Pittston Coal President Michael Odom called the demonstrators
terrorists and said Wednesday, ``We will seek full prosecution under
the law.''
   Pittston's 1,695 UMW employees from Virginia, West Virginia and
Kentucky have been on strike over wages and working conditions.
Union members at other coal companies staged wildcat strikes in June
and July.
   Although Williams offered the demonstrators and the union
amnesty, UMW attorney Mike Passino said they still could face state
penalties.
   A state judge already has fined the union nearly $17 million
based on charges of illegal strike activities brought by the company.
   Meanwhile, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., said his Senate Labor
Committee was launching an investigation of the labor dispute. He
did not give a timetable.

<HEAD>Moslem Parliament Member Assassinated in West Beirut</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MOHAMMED SALAM</BYLINE>
<UNK>Associated Press Writer</UNK>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gunmen killed a Sunni Moslem member of
Parliament and his driver in Syrian-controlled west Beirut today,
police said.
   A police spokesman, who cannot be identified in line with
regulations, said Nazim Kadri, 74, ``died instantly from bullet
wounds in the head and chest.''
   No group claimed responsibility for the assassination of Kadri,
the third Sunni public figure slain in 27 months.
   The police spokesman said three men got out of a red
Mercedes-Benz and fired AK-47 automatic rifles at Kadri's brown
Mercedes sedan this morning a few yards from the nine-story
apartment building where the lawmaker lived.
   Kadri's police driver, Sgt. Sami Suleiman, also was killed in the
attack and a bystander, Samir Itani, was slightly wounded in the
left arm, the spokesman said.
   ``Immediately after emptying about two clips of 30 bullets each
into Kadri's car, the gunmen jumped into their Mercedes and sped
away while shooting in the air,'' the police spokesman said.
   He said a police car rushed Kadri and Suleiman to the American
University Hospital but they were already dead.
   Witnesses said Kadri was gunned down shortly after having a
haircut at a barber's shop across the street from his home.
   One witness, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Kadri's car
was intercepted by the gunmen minutes after he left the barber's
shop.
   Syrian soldiers rushed to the area, sealed off the murder scene
and took several witnesses for questioning, ``including the
barber,'' the witness added.
   Kadri, survived by a wife and seven daughters, represented the
central Bekaa Valley in Lebanon's one-chamber parliament since 1972.
   Since Lebanon's civil war began 14 years ago, 26 seats of the
99-member Parliament have been left vacant by deaths, many by
natural causes.
   The war has prevented parliamentary elections but the remaining
members periodically have voted for renewal of its four-year mandate
since 1976, a year after the war began.
   The other prominent Sunni Moslems killed in the past 27 months
were Grand Mufti Sheik Hassan Khalid and Prime Minister Rashid
Karami.
   Khalid was killed in a car bomb explosion in west Beirut May 16,
and Karami died in a bomb blast aboard an army helicopter that was
flying him from northern Lebanon to Beirut June 1, 1987.
   The economically powerful Sunni community is not involved in the
current six-month confrontation pitting the predominantly Christian
troops of Gen. Michel Aoun against Syrian and allied forces.
   Since the fighting began March 8, 926 people have been killed and
2,725 wounded, by police count.

<HEAD>Former Nurse's Aide Found Guilty of Killing Five Patients</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LISA PERLMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A jury found a former nursing home
aide guilty of killing five incapacitated patients in a pact with a
lesbian lover, and families of the victims celebrated the verdict
outside the court.
   ``My mother can finally rest in peace,'' said Jan Hunderman,
daughter of victim Marguarite Chambers. ``The scars will always be
there, but it helps knowing the truth.''
   A jury deliberated about five hours Wednesday before finding
Gwendolyn Graham guilty on five counts of first-degree murder and
one count of conspiracy to commit first-degree murder in the deaths
at Alpine Manor Nursing Home in Walker.
   Graham, 26, looked down and showed no emotion as the verdicts
were read.
   She faces a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment without
parole. No sentencing date was set.
   Linda Engman, daughter of victim Mae Mason, said she was thrilled
with the verdict. ``I didn't have any doubts at all,'' she said. ``I
wish we had the death penalty.''
   With a lack of hard evidence, the case rested largely on the
testimony of Catherine Wood, Graham's accomplice and former lover.
   Wood, who already has pleaded guilty to second-degree murder,
testified that Graham smothered patients with washcloths because it
``relieved tension.''
   Wood, also a nurse's aide at Alpine Manor, said the two had
formed a love pact, each agreeing to kill patients so they would be
bound to one another for life.
   The victims were Chambers, 60; Mason, 79; Belle Burkhard, 74;
Edith Cook, 97; and Myrtle Luce, 95. The women, all severely
incapacitated and many suffering from Alzheimer's disease, were
killed between January and April 1987.
   Defense attorney James Piazza said he planned to ask the judge to
set aside the verdict.
   ``I'm surprised and disappointed,'' Piazza said. ``There was no
physical evidence whatsoever.''
   Graham, testifying Tuesday, denied that any murders had occurred
at the home and said the murder plot was nothing more than a joke
made up by Wood that had gotten out of hand.
   Graham said a jealous Wood went to police with the story after
Graham left her for another lover and moved to her hometown of
Tyler, Texas.
   Her denials contradicted testimony of several former co-workers
and friends who said she admitted suffocating patients at Alpine
Manor.
   Graham's former lover, Heather Baragar, testified that Graham
often confessed to her and would ``joke around about it.''
   Another woman testified Graham and Wood had shown her
``souvenirs,'' such as an anklet and a balloon, they said they had
taken from their victims.
   Wood testified that she stood watch while Graham suffocated one
patient, but lacked the nerve to kill any of the patients herself.
   The deaths had been ruled natural, and no autopsies were
performed. Police began investigating last October after Wood's
ex-husband told them she had confessed her part in the murder plot.
   Autopsies were performed on the only two bodies that were not
cremated, but no definitive evidence of suffocation was found.
   ``Even though we still find it difficult to believe that any of
this actually happened ... we will continue to place our trust in
our system of justice,'' said a statement from the nursing home.
   In his closing arguments, Assistant Kent County Prosecutor David
Schieber speculated that Graham herself may not know why she killed
the women.
   ``It was murder for its own pleasure,'' he said.

   The dollar rose against all major currencies in
nervous European trading early today amid signs West Germany will
not raise interest rates before a weekend meeting of the world's
leading industrialized nations.
   Gold prices fell.
   Dealers said they expected the dollar to trade within a narrow
range before today's scheduled meeting of the Bundesbank Central
Bank Council.
   Many market players expected the West German central bank to take
no immediate action on interest rates, despite signs of rising
inflation, before monetary talks open Saturday in Washington among
the Group of Seven industrialized nations.
   The absence of Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl from the
meeting also reduced the chances of a rate hike, dealers said.
   The G-7 nations are the United States, Japan, West Germany,
France, Britain, Italy and Canada.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell to a closing 145.00 Japanese yen from 146.25 yen at
Wednesday's close. Later, in London, it edged back up to 145.10 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Wednesday:
   _1.9442 West German marks, up from 1.9400
   _1.6835 Swiss francs, up from 1.6800
   _6.5717 French francs, up from 6.5585
   _2.1903 Dutch guilders, up from 2.1890
   _1,402.00 Italian lire, up from 1,399.50
   _1.1825 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1824
   In London, the British pound fell to $1.5795 from $1.5820 late
Wednesday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $363.65 a troy ounce, up
from $363.25 bid late Wednesday. At midmorning, the city's five
major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $362.95.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $363.35, down from $363.50 bid late
Wednesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $2.69 to a closing bid of
$364.11.
   Silver bullion rose in London to a bid price of $5.13 troy ounce,
up from $5.09 bid late Wednesday.

   Joseph A. Fernandez, who grew up in a Harlem
housing project and dropped out of a New York high school, never
dreamed he would lead the nation's largest public school system.
   Fernandez, currently the Miami school superintendent, said the
New York City job was the farthest thing from his mind when he was
growing up in ``rough areas'' on Manhattan's west side.
   ``I didn't think I'd leave New York alive, much less come back to
lead the school system,'' he said at a news conference in Miami.
   On Wednesday, the New York Board of Education voted unanimously
to approve Fernandez as the next chancellor of the New York City
public schools.
   ``He will stand as a splendid role model,'' board President
Robert Wagner Jr. said of 53-year-old Fernandez.
   Wagner praised Fernandez for lowering the dropout rate in
Miami-Dade County schools while increasing parent and student
involvement in individual schools.
   Fernandez will face a daunting list of problems in New York,
including overcrowded schools, a high dropout rate and a
decentralized system which has been stung by patronage and
corruption scandals.
   ``I like a challenge,'' said Fernandez. ``If you put
well-intentioned people together, people with their hearts in the
right place, I think they can do something for the kids.''
   Wagner said Fernandez would start in January or February and
would be paid $195,000 a year under an 18-month contract. The salary
is $40,000 more than Fernandez receives in Miami and $45,000 more
than the previous chancellor, the late Richard Green, was paid.
   The United Federation of Teachers, which represents 102,000
teachers, assistants, counselors, psychologists and secretaries in
the city's schools, praised Fernandez for emphasizing ``school-based
management and shared decision making.''
   Wagner said that before Fernandez took over Miami's schools,
there were two applicants for each teaching vacancy. Now there are
six.
   Fernandez was one of three finalists in the search that began
after Green died of an asthma attack in May.
   Robert R. ``Bud'' Spillane, superintendent of schools in Fairfax
County, Va., was interviewed by the board Tuesday and Matthew W.
Prophet, school superintendent of Portland, Ore., withdrew from
consideration.
   In 1987, during the search that was to lead to Green's
appointment, the board had asked Fernandez to apply for the job. But
Fernandez said the timing was wrong because he had just been named
to head the Miami system, the nation's fourth biggest.
   Asked why he said yes this time, Fernandez said, ``Because it is
the number one system in the country. ... Maybe we can turn some of
the larger school systems in the country around by replicating what
we've done in Miami.''
   Eighty percent of the 940,000 children in New York's public
schools are minorities. Green was the first black chancellor. His
two immediate predecessors had been Hispanic. Fernandez is of Puerto
Rican heritage.
   While a student at the old High School of Commerce in Manhattan,
Fernandez dropped out and joined the Air Force. He received a high
school equivalency diploma while in the service and later attended
Columbia University.
   He joined the Miami school system as a math teacher in 1962 and
within 10 years became the city's first Hispanic principal.
   He and his wife, Lily, have four grown children.

<HEAD>American Professors Incorporate Events of Tiananmen Square into Courses</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANA KENNEDY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Many American professors are including
the recent democracy protests in China and subsequent army crackdown
in their courses, and they're finding that the Beijing massacre has
boosted student interest in those courses sharply.
   Some professors already have begun to teach the lessons of
Tiananmen Square this fall while others plan to wait until spring to
review the already rich literature spawned by the protests.
   ``Five or six years after our students graduate, many of them are
in positions to make a difference,'' said Andrew Walder, a professor
of sociology at Harvard University. Walder usually teaches a
graduate seminar focusing on post-1949 events in China but plans
this year to examine the years just since 1979.
   Gordon Bennett, a professor of government at the University of
Texas, Austin, said the demonstrations for democracy that occupied
Beijing's Tiananmen Square until the army crackdown in early June
will form the ``centerpiece'' of a survey of Chinese politics he
plans to teach next spring.
   ``It relates to every thesis of political change in China,''
Bennett said, ``That is, whether Chinese authoritarianism was
capable of significant economic reform while suppressing political
change or alternatively, whether the decade of economic reform in
China was forced.''
   Roderick MacFarquhar, professor of government at Harvard, plans
to teach a seminar in Chinese politics to juniors this semester and
said that the June protests will take up at least one week of the
course.
   MacFarquhar said he heard from colleagues at Beijing University
when he taught a course on the Cultural Revolution several years ago
that Chinese officials ``wondered why someone at Harvard was giving
a course on it and they weren't. It caused a lively debate.''
   As a result, MacFarquhar said the current regime may well be
apprised of professors at American universities teaching about
Tiananmen Square ``but since they are antagonistic, the reaction at
the official level will be negative.''
   Thomas Gold, associate professor of sociology and vice-chairman
of the Center for Chinese Studies at the University of California,
Berkeley, said the number of students enrolled in his undergraduate
course on contemporary Chinese society has doubled to more than 120
students since he last offered it two years ago.
   But while Gold expects that the student protests will dominate
the course, he said recent events in Beijing reflected a pattern in
Chinese government and society that has existed for centuries.
   ``It's part of a dichotomy, between a tightening up and a
loosening, that goes back thousands of years,'' Gold said.
   ``But Tiananmen Square meant a temporary victory for those people
who want to clamp down. What happened in Tiananmen Square has
happened many times. Part of the tragedy is how little is new,'' he
said.
   Gold said the events in Beijing ``caught the imagination'' of
American students.
   ``It brought out our respect for human rights and democracy that
most people don't think of very often,'' he said. ``When they saw
this in China it was sort of an ennobling experience. People are
trying to understand what happened and once they do it will have a
larger impact.''

   The seven Americans aboard the French jetliner that crashed in
northern Africa included the wife of the U.S. ambassador to Chad, a
U.S. Peace Corps volunteer and four oil workers, authorities said.
   ``You always think it's going to happen to someone else,'' said
Janice Huff, whose son, Pat, was among 171 passengers aboard the UTA
DC-10 flight from the Congo to Chad to Paris. All aboard the plane
died.
   A radical Shiite group Wednesday claimed responsibility for the
downing of a jetliner, the airline UTA said. The airline said a bomb
most likely caused the crash of the jetliner, which exploded Tuesday
shortly after taking off from Chad for Paris.
   One passenger was Bonnie Barnes Pugh, who decided to travel ahead
of her husband, Robert L. Pugh, the U.S. ambassador to Chad.
   Mrs. Pugh was to help plan the October wedding of her daughter
Anne Pugh, 26, of suburban Washington, D.C., said Mrs. Pugh's
sister, Sally Johnson.
   ``It's been pretty devastating for all of us,'' said Ms. Johnson,
of Brawley, Calif. ``It's hard, particularly when you think of it as
a bombing.''
   Margaret Schutzius, 23, another American passenger, had completed
a two-year stint with the Peace Corps in Chad and was en route to
Paris to begin two months of travel in Europe, her mother said.
   ``She gave her heart and soul to her job and even recommended
that I join the Peace Corps when I retire,'' said Mary K. Hassett, a
bookstore owner in Fredericksburg, Texas. ``She told me how Jimmy
Carter's mother joined the Corps showing that age was not a factor.''
   Ms. Schutzius taught English to elementary school children and
worked with members of Chad's government to develop an English
curriculum in the country's schools, said Jim Flanigan, a spokesman
for the Peace Corps in Washington.
   ``Even though it was a terrible tragedy, and her life was short,
she stood for a lot while she was with us,'' said Ms. Hassett.
   Exxon Corp. spokeswoman Sara Johnson in New York said two
Americans working in southern Chad for the company's Esso
Exploration &amp; Production Chad Inc. subsidiary also were on the UTA
flight.
   They were petroleum geologist Mark Corder, 35, of Houston, and
senior operation supervisor James Turlington, Sr., 48, of Bellville.
   Miss Johnson said an Esso Resources Canada employee on loan to
Exxon was also on the flight. Russell O. Jordan Jr, 29, a senior
projects engineer, is Canadian, but listed his hometown as Houston,
she said.
   The Tulsa, Okla.-based Parker Drilling Co. said four of its
employees were aboard the French airliner, including two Americans.
They were returning home from a 28-day work rotation.
   Parker Drilling spokesman Tim Colwell said the four men worked at
a rig in southern Chad that Parker owns and operates under a
contract with Exxon.
   He identified the Parker employees as Pat Huff, 38, of Franklin,
Texas; Donald Warner, 25, of Terry, Mont.; David Middleton, 38, of
Rowland Gill, England; and a Bolivian truck driver, whose name was
not released pending notification of relatives.
   A camp medic, Warner had been with the company for a month. Huff
was a rig manager.
   The State Department identified the seventh American as Mihai Ali
Manestianu, but no further information was immediately available.

<HEAD>Pravda Apologizes for Article on Behavior of Boris Yeltsin</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Eds: UPDATES thruout to ADD details, quotes, CORRECT spelling of
reporter's name to Zucconi. No pickup. ^By JOHN IAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Communist Party newspaper Pravda made a rare
public apology today for printing an article that accused political
maverick Boris N. Yeltsin of indulging in a boozing and buying spree
during his U.S. tour.
   It said the reporter who wrote the story hadn't seen the
purported binge himself but relied instead on a U.S. newspaper
report and hearsay.
   On Monday, Pravda reprinted an article published by the Italian
newspaper La Repubblica that said Yeltsin had departed the United
States leaving ``a wake of catastrophic prophecies, insane expenses,
interviews and above all the perfume of Jack Daniels Black Label''
whiskey.
   A flushed and angry Yeltsin called the charges ``garbage'' within
minutes of returning to Moscow Monday night. The Soviet legislator
accused Pravda of seeking ``revenge for the fact Americans received
us with admiration.''
   The Communist Party daily said today that it had instructed its
Washington correspondent V. Linnik to contact the La Repubblica
reporter who wrote the original article, Vittorio Zucconi, and check
its accuracy.
   ``Asked whether he stood by the authenticity of everything he
wrote about B.N. Yeltsin in his article, Zucconi replied he had
based it on secondary sources, on a story that appeared in The
Washington Post on Sept. 13 headlined `With Drunken Embraces Towards
The Capitalists' and the testimony of Soviet emigres who heard talk
of Yeltsin's conduct in Baltimore,'' Pravda said.
   The Pravda editorial board then offered its apologies to Yeltsin,
but seemed to do it grudgingly. The reprint of La Repubblica story
was promoted on the front page with excerpts saying Yeltsin found
the United States ``a holiday, a stage, a bar 5,000 kilometers
long.''
   But Pravda's apology came on the bottom of page 7.
   Pravda's reprint of Zucconi's article without comment prompted
the weekly Moscow News to publish an editorial sharply criticizing
the official organ of the Communist Party, whose name means ``the
truth.''
   Noting that the Soviet press practically never tells readers
which of their leaders drink or about their shopping habits abroad,
the Moscow News editorial said sarcastically, ``About Yeltsin, we
now know. Pity that such a leap forward in the sphere of glasnost
was made by the Soviet press not on its own, but with the help of an
Italian newspaper.''
   During his nine-city tour that ended Sunday, Yeltsin warned
Americans that President Mikhail S. Gorbachev could face a
revolution if he fails to improve living conditions soon.
   Yeltsin, the former Communist Party chief of Moscow, was stripped
of the post almost two years ago by Gorbachev, who criticized him as
politically immature and overly ambitious.
   But, in a remarkable political comeback in March, Yeltsin won 89
percent of the vote when he ran against an establishment candidate
to represent Moscow in the new Congress of People's Deputies.
   A month and a half ago, he was elected along with Nobel Peace
Prize laureate Andrei D. Sakharov and a handful of other reformers
to the steering committee of the first organized opposition in the
Soviet parliament in almost 70 years.

<HEAD>Military Head Denies Censorship at Pacific Stars and Stripes</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: CORRECT style on Stars and Stripes, which does not have an ampersand.

   The military head of the Pacific edition of Stars
and Stripes today rejected allegations of censorship and personnel
abuse under his editorship of the newspaper for U.S. armed forces in
the Far East.
   ``The paper is not censored,'' said Air Force Col. Edwin
Montgomery. ``I've never had anyone, no flag officer or bureaucrat,
tell me what stories to write or how they are to run.
   ``I've been here three years and no one has told me anything like
that.''
   But a civilian journalist at the newspaper, Dewey Brackett, said
he was preparing a list of serious problems to be given to the
paper's management and to ombusdman Philip M. Foisie, who is to
arrive Sunday.
   The Pentagon appointed Foisie ombudsman in June for the European
and Far East editions of Stars and Stripes, with authority to
monitor their performance and argue with military brass over
decisions about news coverage.
   He is a former editor with The Washington Post and a former
executive editor of the Paris-based International Herald Tribune.
   ``The issue is not simply censorship. It is also abuse of
personnel and editorial mismanagement,'' Brackett said in a
telephone interview.
   Brackett, who testified before Congress last winter about
conditions at the newspaper, declined to give details before the
list is submitted.
   Montgomery, who also testified before Congress on the dispute,
said in a telephone interview that he felt Foisie also will
represent him.
   ``Mr. Foisie will have the opportunity to speak with whomever he
wishes, and I'm confident he will come to the conclusion we're not
censoring the paper,'' he said.
   The editorial staff consists of 17 U.S. civilians and 21 military
people, Montgomery said.
   Montgomery disputed Brackett's claim that Brackett had been
disciplined for testifying to Congress.
   Brackett has been only temporarily relieved as Pacific editor and
assigned to be a supervising editor, Montgomery said, ``while we can
analyze the latest series of allegations.''
   He said it was normal for civilian employees of the government to
be relieved of normal duties during an investigation.
   Brackett said, however, ``I feel my relief is harassment and
definitely retribution for having testified to Congress.''
   Brackett, 49, said he was a retired U.S. Air Force officer with
about 20 years experience in journalism and in the Far East.
   There have been a series of disputes involving Stars and Stripes
in recent years and they predate the arrival of Montgomery, who
previously was a staff officer in Washington.
   Reporters who have worked for Star and Stripes say their
reporting of the news sometimes suffers because military commanders
worry about the sensitivities of host countries.
   The two editions of the paper, published in Japan and West
Germany, are edited separately and are supposed to be ``hometown
newspapers'' for U.S. service personnel.
   The Pentagon describes them as ``authorized, but unofficial
publications'' and their charter says they are to provide ``a free
flow of news and information ... without censorship or news
management.''
   But last year an investigation by the General Accounting Office,
an arm of the U.S. Congress, found evidence of censorship and
improper managament. The Society of Professional Journalists, Sigma
Delta Chi, assisted in that investigation.
   Democratic Reps. Barbara Boxer of California and Earl Hutto of
Florida have written to Adm. Huntington Hardisty, commander of U.S.
forces in the Pacific, asking him to look into continued allegations.
   ``What we have here is harassment of whistle-blowers and
censorship,'' Ms. Boxer said in an interview in Washington. ``It's
bad enough to censor the news. Our men and women in uniform deserve
the news as all of us get it, as harsh as it is.''

   An Alaska Air National Guard tanker
aircraft exploded and burned at Eielson Air Force Base, killing two
people, the Air Force said. The five others aboard received minor
injuries.
   Sgt. Gene LaDoucer said the KC-135 plane apparently was taxiing
to park when the explosion occurred at about 3 p.m. Wednesday. The
fire, which destroyed the plane, was reported out within two hours.
   Two base firefighters also were treated for minor injuries,
officials said.
   The cause of the explosion was not immediately known. An Air
Force board will investigate the incident, LaDoucer said.
   Five of the seven people aboard were crew members, and the two
others were military passengers, LaDoucer said. Names were withheld.
   The plane, used for in-flight refueling, was returning from a
routine training mission, Sgt. Walt Johnson said. He said he did not
know how much fuel was aboard.
   The Boeing-built aircraft, 134 feet long and with a windowless
fuselage, was part of the 168th Air Refueling Squadron at Eielson.

   Vice President Dan Quayle today visited
U.S. and South Korean troops near the demilitarized zone and
denounced Communist North Korea as a fanatical dictatorship.
   Quayle, who donned a U.S. Army camouflage jacket at one point,
inspected a tunnel under the demilitarized zone that was unearthed
in 1978 and said North Korea posed a grave threat to South Korea.
   ``If anybody thinks North Korea is a passive nation, I suggest
they go down and visit this tunnel. I think it shows the fanaticism
of that country and how far they are willing to go to export
destabilization,'' he said.
   The tunnel is one of several discovered by South Korean and U.S.
troops leading from the North into the South under the zone dividing
the nations.
   South Korean officials say the tunnels were to be used in the
event of an invasion.
   Quayle visited the demilitarized zone on the last day of his
visit to South Korea. He then flew to Tokyo, where he was to meet
briefly with Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain, who is
there on an official visit, and to attend a reception beginning the
International Democratic Union conference.
   Quayle and Mrs. Thatcher will speak Friday at the three-day
gathering of 27 conservative parties from 26 democratic nations and
meet with a wide array of leaders.
   Quayle began a 10-day tour of four Asian nations on Tuesday. He
also is to visit the Philippines and Malaysia.
   North Korean soldiers photographed Quayle and his wife, Marilyn,
when they visited the border truce village at Panmunjom today.
Officers came out of the North Korean pavilion to take notes and
watch the Quayles, who stared back from a tower on the U.N. side of
the compound.
   The vice president repeated reassurances that the United States
will keep its 43,000 troops in South Korea.
   North Korea invaded South Korea in 1950 and the United States
intervened on the side of South Korea. The nations agreed to a
cease-fire in 1953 but technically remain at war.
   North Korean loudspeakers along the demilitarized zone trumpeted
songs and propaganda as the Quayles toured the area for four hours.
   Quayle had lunch with about 100 American soldiers.
   Spec. 4 James Hills of Hot Springs, Ark., said he was pleased
Quayle visited the zone. ``It is great to know that someone is
thinking about us over here,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Sixteen Kuwaiti Shiite Moslems were
executed today for planting bombs that exploded in Mecca at the
height of the Moslem pilgrimage this year, the Interior Ministry
announced.
   The statement, read over the state-run Riyadh radio, said that
another four Kuwaitis received prison terms of 15 and 20 years and
1,000 to 1,500 lashes of the whip. It said another nine Kuwaitis
were acquitted.
   It was the first public word from Saudi Arabia that anyone had
even been arrested in connection with the July 10 explosions, which
killed one Pakistani pilgrim and injured 16 pilgrims of various
nationalities.
   The bombs went off as roughly 2 million Moslems were preparing to
head to Mount Arafat for the culmination of the pilgrimage rites.
Saudi Arabia is home of Islam's holiest shrines at Mecca and Medina.
   Saudi Arabians, including the ruling family, are members of the
majority Sunni Moslem sect. The Sunnis and the minority Shiite sect,
which prevails in Iran, are traditional rivals for the alliegance of
the world's nearly 1 billon Moslems. The antagonism dates back to a
split that occurred in the 7th century.
   Today's announcement said without elaborating that the executions
were carried out in Mecca and ``in accordance with Islamic law.''
   Condemned inmates in Saudi Arabia are usually beheaded by sword,
often in public squares after Moslem prayers.
   The defendants, who came to the kingdom in July as pilgrims,
belonged to the Moslem Shiite sect and were of Iranian, Kuwaiti,
Saudi and Qatari origin, according to the statement. They were all
Kuwaiti nationals.
   The announcement said the defendants, who had been tried before
an Islamic court, gave full confessions. It said the confession
would be broadcast on television.
   The announcement said the defendents were tried for ``an evil
crime ... an aggression on the sanctity of the holy sites and on the
pilgrims ... of the entire Moslem nation.''
   The visit of senior Kuwaiti officials in recent weeks had
prompted reports that the Saudis were holding and interrogating
several Kuwaiti pilgrims.
   The latest was a whirlwind visit Tuesday by the Kuwaiti minister
of state for foreign affairs, Saud al-Ossaimi, to relay a message
from the Kuwaiti leadership.
   The Interior Ministry statement said the defendants brought the
explosives with them from Kuwait, where they also trained on using
them.
   It said they held meetings in Kuwait, Medina and Mecca to plan
their ``aggression,'' with the confessed aim of spreading ``terror
and fear in the hearts of the pilgrims ... and show that the (Saudi
Arabia) was unable to protect the house of God.''
   It referred to their carrying out their crime ``at the
instructions of the unjust ones, who are enemies of this nation and
for all pilgrims of God's house, and cooperating with those unjust
ones on such debauchery and terrorism in the most sacred spot in the
world.''
   The allusion was an apparent reference to Iran, which has been
urging Moslems pouring into Saudi Arabia for the annual Hajj to
seize Mecca and Medina from the ruling Al Saud family.
   The Saudi ruling dynasty is the custodian of the holy shrines,
which are visited by Moslems as one of the five pillars of their
faith.
   Under the rule of the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the
Iranian pilgrims tried to turn the Hajj into a political forum to
spread his Islamic fundamentalist teachings.
   The worst incidents occurred in the pilgrimage of 1987, when the
Iranian contingent clashed with Saudi security forces, leading to
the death of 402 pilgrims, most of them Iranians.
   Riyadh severed ties with Iran the following April and gained the
Moslem's world backing for restricting the number of pilgrims to
1,000 people for each 1 million people of the sending nation's
population.
   The Iranians boycotted the Hajj in 1988 and 1989 as a result and
there was a fierce war of words between Tehran and Riyadh.
   Iran, however, has moved recently to improve ties with Gulf Arab
nations including Saudi Arabia. A ``pragmatic'' camp in Tehran,
headed by President Hashemi Rafsanjani, is trying to open Iran more
to the outside world.
   It is opposed by radicals who view links with the pro-Western
Saudi rulers as anathema.
   Kuwait itself has been a target of several acts of terrorism for
which responsibility was laid on Khomeini's Iran. These acts
included an attempt on the Kuwaiti ruler, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed
al-Sabah in 1985, and two years earlier the bomb blasts on the U.S.
and French embassies in which five people were killed and 86 injured.
   All these acts were also carried out by activists among Kuwait's
Shiite Moslem minority, many of them identified as members of the
anti-Iraqi underground Daawa party. The Shiites in Kuwait are mainly
members of families that came from Iraq and Iran for livelihood in
Kuwait.

   Passengers aboard a USAir jet that crashed into
the East River said they were surprised when they landed in the
water after sliding down chutes from the plane, and clung to
driftwood until being rescued.
   ``Everyone was saying, `Get out! Get out! Get out!' So we started
helping each other get out,'' said Larry Martin, a social worker
from Brooklyn who was on the Boeing 737 with his wife, Valerie.
   ``They told us to get of the plane and go out the door. I thought
we were going to go down the slide and onto the runway. When we got
off the slide we were in the water.''
   Flight 5050, from LaGuardia Airport to Charlotte, N.C., was
carrying 63 people when it skidded off a runway into the East River,
killing two people, the airline said.
   ``It wasn't a violent crash,'' said Frank O'Brien, 25, of
Manhattan. ``We went out the emergency exit. There was some
driftwood'' in the water that several people clung to.
   He said police came by in a boat and picked them up. ``We were
just hanging on to each other. We decided the only thing to do was
to be calm.''
   David Hawthorne, a CBS News producer who was on the flight, said
via a cellular telephone that the engines apparently were cut
halfway down the runway and went into reverse thrust.
   ``At that time no one thought there was going to be real
trouble,'' he said.
   ``The pilot seemed to be accelerating but didn't have enough
power to get the plane up,'' Martin said as he and his wife huddled
in blankets inside an airport terminal.
   ``And it seemed something happened and he put on the brakes,'' he
said. ``The plane took a dip and the next thing I knew all hell
broke loose.''
   Hawthorne said he managed to get out onto a wing, where he waited
with several other people to be rescued.
   ``A lot of women and children were screaming that they couldn't
swim, they couldn't swim,'' he said.
   ``Most people were pretty calm after we got out onto the wing of
the plane,'' he said. ``And they waited for boats to come pick us up
and the rescuers also arrived and I have to say they did a pretty
good job of keeping everybody calm and getting them safely off.''
   Some people were trapped in the tail section of the plane, he
said, and rescuers and crewmembers tried to keep them calm.
   Jerry Murtha, a fire department scuba diver, said it took him
about 45 minutes using a metal cutter to rescue one woman trapped in
the tail section between collapsed seats, behind a woman who had
died.
   ``Water started coming into the tail section,'' he said. ``When
we started it was at 6 inches and when we finished there was 3 feet.
And it (the fuselage) was rocking.''
   He said firefighters placed the unidentified woman, who was not
seriously injured, into a basket and took her to a boat.
   ``She hugged us, kissed us. She wanted to know our names. She
thanked us a million times,'' Murtha said.
   Martin said a stranger helped him after they hit the water.
   ``I started to panic,'' he said. ``There was a guy. ... He
grabbed me, he maneuvered me over to the driftwood. If it wasn't
there I don't know what would have happened.''

   Former President Jose Napoleon
Duarte is losing his battle with liver cancer and could be near
death, his doctors say.
   ``I thought he was going to die last night (Tuesday). But we were
able to stabilize him, and I don't think he'll die within the next
24 hours,'' said Dr. Jose Luis Sacasaid on Wednesday.
   Duarte was in ``serious but stable'' condition Wednesday, the
doctor said, but ``Even so, he probably will not recover from this
crisis.''
   Duarte, 63, led this country for five years until he stepped down
June 1 and was Washington's staunchest ally in the Western
Hemisphere.
   He handed power to elected successor Alfredo Cristiani, of the
rightist Republican Nationalist Alliance.
   The cancer was diagnosed in June 1988 in Washington's Walter Reed
Army Medical Center. Two-thirds of his stomach was removed and
chemotherapy was applied to help slow the disease's advance.
   However, last month the treatment was stopped because Duarte was
judged too weak to survive its debilitating side-effects.
   He was bedridden Wednesday at his home in the fashionable San
Benito neighborhood. A source close to the family said he did not
want to be taken to the hospital.
   Saca said the former president has low blood pressure and
difficulty breathing.

   Gov. Evan Bayh almost fell off a platform as
he proclaimed Emergency Medical Services week, but he would have
been in good hands.
   Nearby were about 40 ambulances and hundreds of emergency medical
personnel from around the state.
   They were at the Statehouse on Wednesday to hear the governor's
proclamation when Bayh's chair slipped from the small platform.
   State Health Commissioner Woodrow Myers, who was sitting next to
the governor, helped keep the state's chief executive from falling.
Bayh caught himself, then joked that he nearly needed emergency
services himself.
   The proclamation recognizes the dedication of workers in the
state's emergency medical services system.

   The actor was able to break free from the would-be robber
Wednesday afternoon during the attack outside the downtown Midnight

   Two mission employees immediately came to the actor's aid,
Schwehr said.
   Detectives Tom Blake and Joel Berk were driving past the mission

Schwehr said.
   They also seized the hunting knife that Orozco used to threaten
Dobson, police said.
   Dobson is a regular donor to the shelter, Schwehr said. The
clothes he donated Wednesday included several pairs of Levis jeans
and Calvin Klein socks and were worth about $500, he said.
   Dobson has played Mack MacKenzie on the CBS primetime soap opera
``Knots Landing'' since 1982. He previously was a detective on the

<HEAD>Bush Rejects Coffee Quota Appeal From Colombia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush is refusing a request by
Colombian President Virgilio Barco to reinstate a one-year Colombian
coffee export that has been beneficial to Colombian farmers, the
White House says.
   Colombia's coffee earnings have slumped at the same time that the
Bush administration is seeking Barco's help in cracking down on
cocaine exports.
   Colombian officials have suggested they will have an even harder
time persuading hard-pressed Colombia farmers to grow coffee instead
of coca if coffee export prices continue to slip.
   Colombian coffee prices have fallen sharply since the 74-nation
International Coffee Agreement (ICA) _ to which both the United
States and Colombia belonged _ collapsed in July after the United
States pulled out in a dispute over prices with coffee-producing
nations.
   The Agreement set quotas for member nations' exports aimed at
supporting prices of beans at $1.20 per pound or more. Some Central
American and others, supported by the United States, wanted larger
quotas.
   After suspension of the quotas in early July, prices fell quickly
to around 85 cents per pound, give or take a few pennies. Colombia
has said this will cost $500 million a year in export revenue.
   Barco, whose nation relies on coffee as a major source of export
earnings, had appealed to Bush to reconsider the coffee decision and
to support reinstating the quotas for at least one year.
   Bush, in a letter to Barco, said the United States was ready to
negotiate for a new quota system but was unwilling to adhere to the
now-defunct agreement, presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater
said Wednesday.
   Fitzwater said that Bush's letter to Barco was one ``expressing
appreciation of the importance of coffee to the economies of
Colombia and other developing countries.''
   The letter, Fitzwater continued, ``expressed his (Bush's)
disappointment that the members of the ICA were unable to settle ...
two fundamental problems.''
   The United States wanted an increase in export quotas for
higher-quality coffees enjoyed by American consumers, and tough
penalties against countries secretly selling coffee surpluses to
Eastern Bloc nations at prices below those charged the United States.
   ``President Bush expresses his confidence that a lasting solution
which is acceptable to other major members and respects market
trends can be found,'' Fitzwater said.

<HEAD>Mernick Says He Will Withdraw From Heritage USA Sale Negotiations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELIZABETH GROAT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Toronto businessman who bought PTL's
Christian theme park for $65 million says he is backing out of the
deal because of conflicting claims to the land from an Indian tribe.
   Stephen Mernick on Wednesday said the claims have prevented him
from getting title insurance on the 2,300-acre Heritage USA park and
that the dispute is an ``insurmountable barrier'' to closing the
deal by the Sept. 30 deadline.
   Mernick bought the Christian theme park, resort and shopping
complex in a U.S. Bankruptcy Court sale a year ago after the TV
evangelical empire's collapse in the sex and money scandal that
brought down Jim Bakker.
   Title insurance protects a piece of property from conflicting
claims.
   Title insurers have been unwilling to issue a policy, which
Mernick needs to secure financing for the deal, because of a claim
by the Catawba Indians to 144,000 acres in northern South Carolina
that include Heritage USA.
   Mernick sought a one-year extension of the closing to 1990 to
obtain insurance, but the court and the PTL creditors who stand to
gain from the sale withheld a decision unless he opened his records
and offered evidence that he had the financing to complete the deal.
   ``I was fully prepared to submit to such an examination,''
Mernick said. But he said the Catawbas' claims ``appear to present
at this time an insurmountable barrier to the closing of the
original transaction.''
   M.C. Benton, a trustee appointed by the court for now-defunct PTL
ministries, was notified Wednesday that Mernick was backing out.
   ``Heritage USA is still for sale,'' said Edwin Allman, an
attorney for Benton.
   Any sale would still be subject to court approval.
   The claim filed in 1980 by the Catawba Indians seeks to reclaim
land they contend was illegally sold to the state in 1840. A date
has not been set for the lawsuit, which apparently has halted other
commercial development, including a $100 million mall.
   The $175 million theme park was developed by Bakker and his wife,
Tammy. PTL filed for bankruptcy in 1987. Bakker is on trial in
Charlotte, N.C., on charges of defrauding followers of nearly $4
million.

<HEAD>NATO Proposal Would Limit Military Maneuvers in Europe</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   NATO and the Warsaw Pact would limit most
military maneuvers in Europe to 40,000 soldiers and 800 tanks under
a proposal offered by NATO today at East-West talks on conventional
forces.
   The proposal, the first to limit European military maneuvers, was
presented to Warsaw Pact delegates at the start of the latest round
of the talks.
   Chief West German delegate Ruediger Hartmann called the package
the ``most comprehensive, most detailed and most ambitious arms
control system that was ever worked out for conventional forces.''
   The NATO offer expands on a proposal the West made July 13 based
on a blueprint for deep reductions in arms and troops that President
Bush unveiled at a NATO summit meeting in May.
   Hartmann said the NATO package provides all the negotiating
material needed to reach an agreement on conventional arms next year.
   It proposes limiting the size of military maneuvers to 40,000 men
and 800 tanks. One maneuver every two years would be allowed to
exceed those limits.
   The NATO paper also requires each side to give 42 days notice
when calling up more than 40,000 reservists and would impose
ceilings on the number of tanks, artillery pieces and personnel
carriers in active units.
   It is little changed from a package offered two weeks ago at the
opening session of the Vienna talks on reducing conventional forces
in Europe. A dispute among NATO members delayed its presentation.
   Seven Warsaw Pact countries and 16 NATO members are taking part
in the talks on conventional forces in Europe, which began in March
and cover all of Europe from the Atlantic Ocean to the Ural
mountains.
   The measures proposed by the West today also provide for an
extensive exchange of information as part of detailed verification,
including routine inspections to see each side carries out pledged
reductions and maintains agreed upon ceilings. Western allies are
divided on this issue, with the United States and Canada seeking
strict surveillance, and their European partners objecting to
frequent inspections of their facilities by the Warsaw Pact.
   Under the proposal, removal of equipment from monitored storage
or units with a low level of readiness would be permitted only after
prior notification.
   In its July proposal, NATO suggested each alliance have no more
than 5,700 combat aircraft and 1,900 combat helicopters. The July 13
initiative also would restrict any one country to 3,420 aircraft and
1,140 helicopter gunships.
   Heavy armaments cuts are recommended, with a suggested ceiling of
20,000 main battle tanks, 16,500 artillery pieces and 28,000 armored
personnel carriers for each side.
   NATO also is proposing that U.S. and Soviet troops stationed
outside their national territory in Europe not exceed 275,000 each.
   Diplomats for East and West are optimistic that preliminary
agreements can be reached next year and implemented by 1992 or 1993.
   Negotiators have said the biggest problem in the current six-week
round of talks is weapons categories.
   The most serious differences exist in aircraft.
   The Warsaw pact, while not presenting specific figures, insists
``air defense interceptors'' based near Moscow and the Urals be
excluded.
   NATO objects. Western experts have expressed concern that
defensive aircraft could be reconstructed for strike capabilities.
   The Warsaw Pact has not yet responded to the West's July
proposal, but in March proposed reducing six kinds of weapons,
including aircraft, by 10 to 15 percent by 1994. That would be
followed by a further 25 percent cut by 1997, with the ultimate goal
of purely defensive forces by the year 2000.

<HEAD>German Prosecutor to Check British Documents on Former Nazi General</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LUEBECK, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The prosecutor's office said today
it is sending a lawyer to Britain next week to study evidence
against a former Nazi SS general suspected in the deaths of 85
British war prisoners in 1940.
   The Luebeck prosecutor's office opened a new investigation of
ex-Gen. Wilhelm Mohnke, 78, in June 1988 after the British Defense
Ministry said it had discovered more survivors of the massacre.
   ``One of our prosecutor's will be in London early next week to
evaluate documents held there as part of the on-going Mohnke
investigation,'' prosecutor's spokesman Joachim Boettcher said in a
telephone interview. He identified the prosecutor being sent as
Hartwig Nigendank.
   Boettcher said Mohnke remains free in West Germany pending
results of the investigation.
   Mohnke allegedly gave orders in 1940 for 85 unarmed British
prisoners being held in a barn to be shot by SS troops at Wormhoudt,
near Dunkirk in France. A similar investigation of Mohnke was
dropped in 1973 for lack of evidence.
   Earlier probes of Mohnke's alleged involvement in the 1944
execution of 75 unarmed U.S. prisoners of war at Malmedy, in the
French Ardennes, and Canadians in Normandy the same year, also were
dropped for lack of evidence.
   Mohnke, a retired businessman who lives in the town of Stemwarde,
near Hamburg, repeatedly has denied any connection with the
massacres.

   Aviation officials questioned crew members and
recovered flight recorders today in an effort to learn why a USAir
jet carrying 63 people aborted takeoff and skidded into the East
River, killing two passengers.
   About 10 people were rescued clinging to driftwood, while others
huddled on the wing of the 9-month-old Boeing 737-400 that broke
apart late Wednesday at the water's edge at LaGuardia Airport.
   ``We just grabbed on to a big piece of wood and held on for dear
life,'' said Tom Newberry, 27, of New York City.
   This morning, the plane's data and cockpit voice recorders were
recovered, Port Authority spokesman Mark Marchese said. Officials
from the National Transportation Safety Board arrived and began
talking to the crew.
   ``Something happened and he put on the brakes. The plane took a
dip and the next thing I knew all hell broke loose,'' said passenger
Larry Martin of New York City, who huddled in blankets with his
wife, Valerie.
   ``People were on top of each other. People were screaming. There
was the smell of gas. Everyone was saying `Get out! Get out! Get
out!''' he said. The Martins got out, and held fast to driftwood
until a police boat plucked them from the water.
   Officials said two women who had seats in the rear of the plane
near where the fuselage snapped were killed. Their bodies were taken
from the cabin; the cause of death was not immediately known.
   Forty-five people were taken to the hospital; two were reported
in serious condition and a third was in stable condition after a
heart attack.
   The Coast Guard said overnight that up to six people were missing
and divers were sent to look for them. But an airline spokeswoman,
Susan Young, said all 57 passengers and six crew members were
accounted for as of 8 a.m.
   Flight 5050, bound for Charlotte, N.C., originally scheduled for
departure at 7:27 p.m., was delayed by heavy rain. But officials
said weather was not a factor in the 11:29 p.m. crash.
   The plane split into three pieces, its nose remaining above water
on a pier that holds runway approach lights. The other pieces were
partly submerged in 25- to 40-foot-deep water, just beyond a runway
that extended onto pylons 10 feet above the water. A crane raised
the wreckage at dawn.
   ``What held it up was a lighting bridge,'' Mayor Edward I. Koch
said of the front section. ``The back section, God held that up.''
   Stephen Berger, executive director of the Port Authority, which
operates the airport, said several people walked away from the
crash, and at least one took a taxi home.
   Some survivors crawled onto the wing to await rescue. Others _
some shoeless _ slid out exits into the water. At least one person
was cut from the wreckage. ``They were hanging from the pier,
hanging on the wing, hanging from the front of the plane,'' said
police Lt. Larry Johnston.
   The airport reopened this morning after six hours.
   The plane was delivered new to USAir in January and had no
history of mechanical problems, said Nancy Vaughan, another USAir
spokeswoman.
   Coast Guard Lt. Tom Blisard said most of the passengers were
saved because the water was not cold, the plane went down close to
the lighted runway and the impact was not harsh. He said the only
problem was a strong current.
   David Hawthorne, a CBS News producer who was on the plane, said
he moved toward the back and got out onto a wing. ``A lot of women
and children were screaming that they couldn't swim, they couldn't
swim,'' Hawthorne said.
   Coast Guard boats and planes, police vehicles, a cherry picker
and divers responded.
   Frank O'Brien, 25, of New York City, said he helped a few
passengers.
   ``A couple people couldn't swim so we got them on the
driftwood,'' he said. ``It was a kind of `row, row, row your boat.'
It was kind of funny, but not really. You can't think about what can
happen here.''
   The plane's engines apparently cut off halfway down the runway
and went into reverse thrust, Hawthorne said. ``At that time no one
thought there was going to be real trouble,'' he told CBS via
cellular telephone.
   ``Most people were pretty calm after we got out onto the wing of
the plane,'' he said. ``And they waited for boats to come pick us up
and the rescuers also arrived and I have to say they did a pretty
good job of keeping everybody calm and getting them safely off.''

<TEXT>
   Ten bombs exploded early today in Bogota,
causing heavy damage to nine offices of Colombia's main political
parties and to one bank, police said. At least two people were
reported injured.
   Bombings have occurred almost daily since the government declared
a crackdown on Colombia's powerful cocaine traffickers on Aug. 18.
   The explosions came hours after lawmakers urged the government to
publicize reported ``black lists'' of corrupt politicians and
officials.
   Colombian newspapers today published the names of 25 lawmakers
and politicians, including a Liberal Party presidential candidate,
who the papers said had their U.S. visas denied or canceled.
   U.S. Embassy spokesman Pablo Urutia today said he did not know if
the visas were withheld because of links with traffickers. He
refused further comment.
   Police said the bombs went off around 3 a.m.
   They damaged offices of the Liberals and Conservatives,
Colombia's two main political parties, in several neighborhoods of
the capital of 6 million people. Another blast ripped through a
bank. Banks have been a favorite target of the cocaine cartels.
   Police said the two injured people were taken to hospitals. There
were no other details immediately available.
   ``This shows the total decadence we are living in in this
country. It's a senseless war,'' said Emilio Barguch,
secretary-general of the Conservative Party. He said one blast
destroyed national party headquarters.
   Liberal Party leader Julio Cesar Sanchez, a former Bogota mayor,
called for an emergency meeting of the Congress to discuss
additional security measures.
   Liberal Party presidential candidate Alberto Santofimio Botero
said today his U.S. visa was canceled in March in Miami because he
met Medellin cartel leader Pablo Escobar eight years ago, when both
were congressmen.
   ``I barely knew him and met him only during a political rally,''
the Liberal politician told Radio Caracol, a private radio chain. He
accused the United States of retaliating for his criticism of
``American intervention in Nicaragua and Panama and other parts of
Latin America.''
   On Wednesday, the Senate asked the government for a U.S. list
with names of politicians denied visas because of suspected drug
connections.
   It also passed a resolution urging the government to make public
other lists with names of politicians and government leaders alleged
to have links with the cartels. Barco has said he's not aware of any
such lists.
   Also Wednesday, the head of the country's criminal investigation
office said British and Israeli mercenaries smuggled weapons through
Panama to train assassination squads for drug cartels, teaching them
tactics used in political killings and bombings.
   Gen. Miguel Maza Marquez, head of the Department of
Administrative Security, told the Senate that the mercenaries,
working for the drug cartels since 1987, ``can't escape
responsibility'' for the bank bombings and political assassinations.
   The slaying Aug. 18 of Sen. Luis Carlos Galan, a popular
presidential candidate and anti-drug crusader, led to the government
crackdown.
   As part of the crackdown, President Virgilio Barco revived
Colombia's extradition treaty with the United States, where the top
traffickers are wanted. So far, one person has been extradited, but
the drug barons on the nation's most-wanted list have eluded capture.
   Maza said foreign military trainers smuggled weapons from
neighboring Panama to train four paramilitary groups. Squads of 50
to 80 men each received up to four months of training, Maza said.
   He said at least nine Israelis trained the squads. It's unknown
how many British mercenaries were involved, but the British Embassy
has acknowledged trainers were in Colombia.
   Maza said his information was based in ``intelligence
investigations,'' but he charged that many in the military and
government, in an attempt to discredit him, and have been slow to
act on his reports.
   Maza, who has had at least four recent attempts on his life,
headed the investigation that led to the government issuing an
arrest warrant Monday for Yair Klein, a former Israeli army colonel
accused of training paramilitary squads for drug cartels.
   Mercenary training for both the Cali and Medellin cocaine cartels
consisted of supplying weapons and martial arts and explosives
training, Maza said.

<HEAD>Committee Proposes Streamlining of Death Penaly Appeals</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A special committee today proposed streamlining
death penalty appeals to assure swifter executions but only after
guaranteeing condemned prisoners competent legal help.
   ``Capital cases should be subject to one complete and fair course
of collateral review in the state and federal system,'' said the
panel appointed by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist. ``When this
review has concluded, litigation should end.''
   Retired Supreme Court Justice Lewis F. Powell, the committee
chairman, said the current system encourages endless delays,
repetitive appeals and frenzied, last-minute activity as death row
inmates approach scheduled executions.
   ``The hard fact is that the laws of 37 states (that have the
death penalty) are not being enforced by the courts,'' Powell said.
``I respect those who argue for outright abolition of death
punishment. But it seems irrational to retain the penalty and
frustrate its fair implementation.''
   Powell noted that there are some 2,200 death row inmates but
there have been only 118 executions since the Supreme Court
reinstated the death penalty in 1972.
   He said the average delay between conviction and execution is
more than eight years and the longest has been 14{ years.
   ``Delay of this magnitude is hardly necessary for fairness or for
thorough review,'' Powell said.
   The committee he heads recommended that states enact laws to
assure that death row inmates have adequate legal help throughout
their appeals at taxpayer expense. The committee did not estimate
the potential cost or the likely reduction in time between
convictions and executions.
   If the state chose not to adopt the plan, the current system
would remain in effect for that state _ permitting repetitive state
and federal court appeals.
   One feature of the new system would be a six-month period to file
a federal appeal after the prisoner exhausts state appeals. There is
no such time period now.
   The current system permits death row inmates to file repeated
appeals to federal courts to challenge alleged violations of their
constitutional rights.
   Under the committee's proposal, there would be one round of such
federal appeals unless condemned prisoners could produce new
evidence to demonstrate innocence.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain called
today for strong Western support for Soviet economic and political
reforms, saying they are in the interest of liberty.
   Mrs. Thatcher, in Japan for an international conference of
conservative parties, also said she is confident that trade issues
raised in meetings with Japanese leaders and business executives
will be resolved satisfactorily.
   The British leader has frankly criticized what she called Japan's
unfair trade barriers and urged fast action to open its markets to
foreign goods.
   In a meeting with former Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita and
later in comments to reporters, Mrs. Thatcher stressed Japan's
responsibility to contribute to global economic growth and called
for stronger support for reforms spearheaded by Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   ``This is the most bold and courageous leader the Soviet Union
has had while it's been under Communism. What Mr. Gorbachev is
attempting to do ... is in the interests of liberty as a whole and
in the interest of all other nations who believe in the cause of
democracy as well.
   ``We should do, therefore, everything we can to support this
great, historic movement ... and do all we can to see that it is
successful.''
   Mrs. Thatcher will visit Moscow for talks with Gorbachev when she
leaves Tokyo on Friday.
   She noted a trend in favor of Western democratic political and
economic views but cautioned against relaxing defenses, predicting a
period of instability in East-West relations and elsewhere.
   ``A time of great uncertainty is no time to reduce your
defenses,'' she said. ``You don't prevent wars by disarmament. You
prevent wars by quietly being prepared and having a sure defense.''
   Mrs. Thatcher pointed to China as an area where unexpected
political developments had created great uncertainty, and she urged
Japan to provide increased investment and support to Hong Kong.
   Confidence in the future of that British colony, which reverts to
Chinese rule in 1997, was shaken severely by Beijing's military
assault on pro-democracy demonstrators in China in June and an
ensuing crackdown on political dissent.
   ``It is absolutely vital we should do everything we can to keep
up the confidence of the people in Hong Kong,'' she said.
   Mrs. Thatcher, who arrived Tuesday in Tokyo to attend a
conference of the International Democratic Union, a grouping of
right-of-center political parties, called her visit ``timely.''
   ``With so many changes taking place in the world, it is very
important that the great democracies, and particularly the economic
summit seven countries, should consult very closely with each
other,'' she said.
   She said she hoped to create an ``unprecedented partnership''
with Japan in the 1990s and to resolve lingering trade problems.

   A Turkish mechanic who schemed with an Army
intelligence officer to sell U.S. military secrets to the East Bloc
has been sentenced to life in prison.
   Huseyin Yildirim, 61, was convicted July 20 of conspiring with
Warrant Officer James W. Hall to funnel the material to East German
and Soviet agents.
   U.S. District Judge B. Avant Edenfield on Wednesday ordered that
Yildirim be ``banished from the United States, never to return'' if
he is paroled.
   Yildirim, of Belleair, Fla., did not testify at his trial but
told the judge Wednesday: ``In the reality, I am not guilty. I
protected America.''
   Prosecutors contended Yildirim, a civilian Army mechanic
stationed in West Berlin, carried military secrets from Hall and
returned with money from 1982 to 1988.
   Evidence indicated that Hall had access to all levels of
intelligence during tours at the Army's Field Station Berlin
listening post and in Frankfurt, West Germany; Fort Monmouth, N.J.,
and Fort Stewart, Ga.
   Hall was sentenced by a military judge to 40 years in prison.
   Edenfield rejected a plea to give Yildirim a comparable sentence.
   ``The only proper sentence for Mr. Hall would have been death at
a firing squad,'' Edenfield said.

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Judges won't be able to let violent criminals off
without prison unless they explain their sentences in writing under
a new state law.
   Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, who signed the legislation Wednesday
along with a bill increasing aid to victims of violent crime,
acknowledged the law would probably lead to more crowded prisons.
But he said he is committed to expanding prison space.
   ``If a judge is not going to sentence someone to prison for a
crime of violence, he should have very good reasons _ reasons that
will hold up to public scrutiny,'' Dukakis said. ``We're going to
expect judges in this state to be accountable.''
   Judges ``are fallible and make mistakes occasionally,'' he said,
adding that that would be much less likely to happen under the new
law because judges will be forced to think carefully about their
rulings.
   Chief Justice Paul Liacos said through a spokeswoman that he
isn't against the concept but is worried it will require more work
of judges without providing extra staff.
   The other bill signed by Dukakis at least doubles the fine
imposed on criminals to help victims.
   A sponsor said the legislation would raise $5 million a year for
services such as translation and counseling as well as $1.5 million
toward direct compensation to victims.

<HEAD>Lake Stakes Claim to Only Remaining Horse Ferry</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BURLINGTON, Vt. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The only known horse ferry left in America
will be preserved at its underwater location in Lake Champlain,
where divers will be allowed to examine it and take photographs.
   ``Just as we're protecting the natural beauty of Lake Champlain,
what today's event marks is the protecting of the historic
resources,'' said Vermont Gov. Madeleine Kunin, who dedicated the
wreck Wednesday along with state and local officials, historians and
representatives of the diving community.
   The horse-powered ferry, which cruised 150 years ago, and three
other shipwrecks are marked with surface buoys and underwater signs
that encourage divers to look but keep the wreck intact. A bright
yellow sign placed on the horse ferry advises divers to ``take
nothing but photos.''
   The horse ferry, or ``teamboat,'' was powered by two horses or
mules who walked on a large turntable mounted beneath the deck. The
turntable drove a pair of paddle wheels that allowed the ferry to
travel the lake between Vermont and New York state.
   The identity and date of the boat are still unknown, but it most
likely cruised the lake in the first half of the 19th century. The
design is based on an 1819 patent, and the Vermont Legislature
granted the first teamboat charter on Lake Champlain in 1821. The
last teamboat was retired around the time of the Civil War.
   Kevin Crisman, a marine archaeologist who is documenting the
wreck, said the two-horsepower boat would have been heard several
miles away, ``with the horses' hooves clumping on the deck and the
iron gears clanking.''
   Today its remains are in 45 feet of water less than a mile
northwest of the Burlington breakwater. It is 63 feet long and 23
feet wide, and is extremely fragile, said Giovanna Peebles, Vermont
state archaeologist.
   Divers can see the algae-covered wreck from five to 15 feet away.
Crisman said the most spectacular part is the paddle wheels, with
the iron hubs and oak spokes still complete, although badly
deteriorated, rising 10 feet above the bottom.

   Two slow-moving freight trains collided
head-on in the Mississippi Delta, slightlty injuring seven Illinois
Central Railroad crewmen.
   Authorities were unsure why the trains were traveling in opposite
directions on the same track on Wednesday, said Paul Reed, office
manager with Illinois Central's Transportation Department in Chicago.
   ``At the moment, we can't pin down the cause,'' Reed said. No
damage estimate was available.
   A 45-car train collided with a 119-car freight, knocking off the
tracks two engines and two ``piggy-back'' cars, Reed said. The
engines and cars of the longer train remained on the rails.
   Four crewmen jumped as the trains came together, said Lt. L.C.
Clarke, executive officer of the Highway Patrol's Greenwood
District. The seven injured crewmen were examined at a hospital for
scratches and other minor injuries.

   Italy's permanent representative to the
United Nations, Giovanni Migliuolo, has died at the age of 62,
according to officials at the Italian U.N. Mission.
   Migliuolo died Wednesday night of a brain tumor at Memorial
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York, they said.
   Migliuolo was one of the Italian government's experts on
East-West politics and was a scholar of Slavic languages and culture.
   He was Italy's ambassador to Moscow from 1981 to 1985, also
serving as ambassador to Mongolia. From 1985 to 1988, he was the
ambassador to Cairo. He became the senior U.N. ambassador a year ago.
   Migliuolo was married and had four children.

   A French air force helicopter aiding in rescue
efforts near the hurricane-stricken island of Guadeloupe crashed
into the sea, and officials said five bodies were recovered today.
   The body of a sixth man, who was being evacuated from the
outlying island of Desirade, was recovered shortly after the
helicopter went down Wednesday night, said officials from the
Guadeloupe capital, Point-a-Pitre. Three other people remained
missing.
   Chances were fading that searchers in helicopters and fishing
boats would find them alive, the officials said.
   The twin-engine Puma plunged into the Caribbean about a half-mile
southeast of the outlying island of Desirade while evacuating
Bernard Berchel, who had suffered head injuries when Hurricane Hugo
hit on Sunday, officials said.
   Also on the helicopter were Berchel's son, four medical workers
and the helicopter's crew of three, the officials said.
   The cause of the accident was unknown, but witnesses today
reported hearing unusually loud mechancial noises as the helicopter
lifted off from Desirade, about six miles east of Guadeloupe.
   The helicopter was part of ongoing rescue efforts involving about
3,000 French servicemen assisting civil authorities cope with the
aftermath of Hugo.

<HEAD>NATO Presents New Proposals to Curb Threat of War in Europe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE JAHN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NATO on Thursday offered the Warsaw Pact
sweeping new proposals for reducing the threat of war in Europe, and
senior Western negotiators expressed confidence agreement could be
reached by next year.
   The proposals would regulate exchange of information on numbers
and locations of forces and weapons systems of the two military
pacts over a zone stretching west from the Atlantic Ocean to the
Soviet Ural mountains in the east.
   Western delegation heads said their new presentation at the talks
on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe completed initial NATO
concepts on curbing the possibility of non-nuclear war on the
continent.
   In earlier proposals, the 16-nation North Atlantic Treaty
Organization suggested weapons ceilings on arms categories including
combat aircraft and helicopters, and the scrapping of all withdrawn
equipment.
   Chief West German delegate Ruediger Hartmann called the total
NATO package the ``most comprehensive, most detailed and most
ambitious arms control system that was ever worked out for
conventional forces.''
   His Canadian counterpart, David Peel, told reporters, ``Now that
our package is there ... I think chances of our reaching agreement
next year are extremely good.''
   Reflecting NATO confidence of quick progress, chief U.S. delegate
Stephen J. Ledogar said the alliance was planning to present a draft
treaty possibly before the current round of talks ends Oct. 19. The
talks resume Nov. 10.
   The new, 13-page, NATO initiative includes the following
proposals:
   _Exchange of detailed information on combat and support units and
air defenses to the squadron or batallion level.
   _Providing the numbers and locations of main battle tanks,
artillery pieces, armored troop carriers, combat aircraft and combat
helicopters, as well as NATO arms depots and their Warsaw Pact
equivalents.
   _Information on the number and location of U.S. and Soviet troops
in allied European countries.
   _Advance notification of major changes in force organization and
strength, mobilization of reservists if they number 42,000 or more,
and of major movements of main battle tanks, artillery and armored
troop carriers.
   _Limits on the numbers of main battle tanks, artillery and troop
carriers in storage.
   _No more than one military excercise every two years mobilizing
more than 40,000 troops or 800 main battle tanks.
   _Inspection of designated bases and depots and the right to ask
for inspection of non-designated ones; requests to look at
non-designated bases and depots may be refused.
   _Monitoring of the destruction of withdrawn equipment.
   A Warsaw Pact negotiator, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said in an interview that the new proposals ``showed promise'' but
that it was too early for substantive comment.
   The seven-nation Warsaw Pact still has to formally respond to a
NATO initiative presented in July.
   That initiative incorporated proposals made in May by President
Bush, including capping the U.S. and Soviet troop strengths at
275,000 each and slashing the number of military aircraft.
   While acknowledging general superiority in numbers, the Warsaw
Pact disputes the accuracy of specific NATO statistics on personnel
and weapons.
   According to November 1988 NATO statistics, Moscow and its allies
have 3,090,000 men in Europe, compared to 2,213,593 for NATO; 51,500
main battle tanks to 16,424 for NATO; 22,400 armored infantry
fighting vehicles to NATO's 4,153; 43,400 artillery pieces to 14,458
in NATO; and 8,250 combat aircraft to 3,977 for NATO.

   Hurricane Hugo's leading edge brought
rain to the lower East Coast today, and thousands fled inland. The
first of 1,000 soldiers sent by President Bush arrived in the Virgin
Islands to quell looting in the storm's wake.
   With landfall expected as early as tonight between Florida and
North Carolina and the killer storm's winds rising to 110 mph,
schools were closed, homes were boarded up, residents stocked up on
emergency supplies and shelters opened.
   Forecasters warned that waves could tower as much as 16 feet
above normal because the hurricane could cross the coast at high
tide, about 2:30 a.m. Rain of 5 to 10 inches was forecast.
   The military brought aircraft inland and sent ships out to sea to
ride out the storm, which has killed at least 25 people in the
Caribbean with direct blows to Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.
   South Carolina's governor declared an emergency and called out
the National Guard to help thousands move inland. As many as 490,000
people were being evacuated from the coast in Georgia, where an
emergency also was declared.
   ``We get a lot of storms over here. I don't get real upset over
them because I've sat through too many of them,'' said Nancy
Treadaway, who was packing this morning to leave Charleston.
   Robin Bevill, taping the windows of her Wrightsville Beach, N.C.,
gas station, said residents of the island town were nervous.
   ``Diana, back in 1984, was nothing really to worry about,'' said
Ms. Bevill. ``This one's expected to be bigger. ... It's still
exciting, as long as you're safe.''
   U.S. military police were sent to the Virgin Islands to reinforce
U.S. marshals, FBI agents and armed Coast Guardsmen who were
dispatched after police reportedly joined prison escapees and
machete-armed mobs in looting on St. Croix.
   The first contingent, about 75 soldiers led by a brigadier
general, arrived this morning, secured the airport and set up a
command center. It appeared to be the first time in more than 20
years that a president ordered active duty military personnel into
the nation's streets.
   ``Everyone in the federal pen there is loose,'' said Eileen Long,
a New York City advertising executive who was among 145 St. Croix
tourists who arrived in Miami late Wednesday on a
government-arranged evacuation flight.
   ``There are murderers and snipers running around everywhere,''
she said.
   Bush also declared the Virgin Islands a disaster area and freed
up $500,000 for relief.
   Hugo sideswiped the Bahamas and accelerated as it moved over open
water Wednesday. ``An increase in forward speed increases the
likelihood that it will strike the coast and not recurve, heading
out to sea,'' said Bob Sheets, director of the National Hurricane
Center in Florida.
   Early today, rain from Hugo fell from North Carolina to
Melbourne, Fla. Rain was heavy around Augusta, Ga. A hurricane
warning was issued from Fernandina Beach, Fla., to Cape Lookout, N.C.
   Forecasters said there was a 1 in 4 chance that it would come
ashore between Savannah, Ga., and Charleston.
   Charleston officials braced for widespread flooding, noting that
some streets flood at high tide during a full moon even without a
storm. Hospitals stockpiled supplies, discharged patients well
enough to go home and moved others inland. Utility companies said
they would cut off power to Hilton Head Island.
   At Cape Canaveral, Fla., NASA decided it was safe to keep shuttle
Atlantis on the launch pad for an October launch.
   At noon EDT, Hugo's center was 305 miles southeast of Savannah,
or 29.5 degrees north latitude and 77 degrees west longitude. It was
moving northwest at 17 mph, up from 12 mph Wednesday.
   Bill Clack, executive director of the Georgia Emergency
Management Agency, said he expected 490,000 people would be
evacuated from the state's barrier islands and other low-lying areas.
   From Florida to the Carolinas, people stocked up on supplies to
board up windows and carry them through several days without
electricity and water.
   ``They're buying me out of all my candles, tape, flashlights,
propane fuel, oil and lamps,'' said Tim Brindley, manager of a K
mart in Mount Pleasant, S.C.
   The governor requested shelters opened in eight coastal counties.
His emergency declaration put the National Guard and state law
enforcement agencies on alert and ordered vans to be made available
to evacuate the elderly.
   In Charleston, the 188-year-old City Hall was boarded up, schools
and colleges canceled class and the mayor said the storm could be
the city's biggest catastrophe since a 1938 tornado that killed 32
people and injured hundreds.
   ``It's very important no one underestimate the danger of this
hurricane,'' Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr. said.
   The Navy sent its ships from Charleston to ride out the storm.
Hunter Army Air Field in Savannah flew more than 60 helicopters
inland. Bases in Myrtle Beach and Charleston also planned to fly
aircraft away from the storm.
   Tropical Storm Iris was close behind. At 6 a.m. EDT, it was near
22.7 north latitude and 66.2 west longitude, or 330 miles east of
Grand Turk Island. Winds were 45 mph as the storm moved
west-northwest at about 13 mph.
   The last major storm to blow ashore in South Carolina was Gracie
in 1959, which struck near Beaufort with winds of more than 100 mph,
leaving 22 dead and $14 million in damage.

   President Bush today won the support of former
President Jimmy Carter for spending $9 million to aid the
anti-Sandinista opposition in Nicaragua's elections next year as a
way to ``make the playing field level.''
   Carter, who as head of the Atlanta-based Council of Freely
Elected Heads of State will lead an observer delegation to the
Nicaraguan elections, said as long as the money is used in
accordance with Nicaraguan law, it will benefit the political
process. He spoke with reporters after meeting with the president.
   The Nicaraguan election law requires that half of any money
coming into the political process from outside the country be given
to the country's electoral council that runs the elections.
   Carter reiterated his opinion that indications are the elections
will be fair, although some in the administration remain wary of the
leftist Sandinistas' sincerity.
   Bush was expected to send a formal request for the aid to Capitol
Hill as early as today, according to congressional sources. The aid
is intended to help long shot opposition candidate Violeta Chamorro
get a fairer shot in the presidential election scheduled for
February.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III has been sounding out
prospects for the measure with congressional leaders, and one Senate
GOP source who spoke on condition of anonymity said responses had
been encouraging.
   Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., a critic of past administration
efforts to aid opponents of the leftist Managua regime, said late
Wednesday his initial reaction to the package was favorable.
   The money _ to be funneled both directly to the opposition
political coalition and indirectly through the quasi-governmental
National Endowment for Democracy and United Nations election
observers _ would meet an estimated 80 percent or more of Chamorro
election budget, according to administration estimates.
   The endowment is a private foundation created by Congress in 1982
to support democratic elections worldwide, using money appropriated
by Congress.
   Proponents of the aid package said the administration believes it
would lend credibility to the opposition and make it easier for
Chamorro's coalition to raise additional money from other countries
and individuals.
   It also would help level the playing field for the fledgling
opposition coalition against the ruling Sandinista party, which has
held power since a 1979 revolution.
   Administration officials and many in Congress believe the
elections, while an uphill battle for the opposition, offer the best
opportunity in a decade to oust the Sandinistas and President Daniel
Ortega, who are closely linked to the Soviet Union.
   Most of the aid, some $5 million, would go to NED for use in
non-partisan efforts at voter registration, voter turnout and
election organizing, said sources in both parties and both houses of
Congress, all of whom spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The administration believes those efforts can be at least
indirectly helpful to Chamorro, the publisher of the opposition
newspaper La Prensa and the candidate of the opposition coalition
known as UNO.
   The move would require no change in NED's charter, which
prohibits direct partisan political activities.
   Another $2 million would go directly to UNO, but under Nicaraguan
law would have to be split 50-50 with the country's electoral
commission, which will run the elections.
   The remaining $2 million would help fund the activities of
election observer groups such as one to be sent by the United
Nations, the sources said.
   In visits to Washington last week, UNO representatives asked for
overt U.S. aid for ``the electoral process'' in Nicaragua, despite
what they said was the certainty that the Sandinistas would seek to
use American support as a propaganda weapon against them.
   Earlier this month, the Bush administration had considered asking
for $3 million for an open, direct donation to Chamorro's campaign,
but modified that approach in the face of congressional opposition.

   Residents of this
popular American vacation resort toted guns as they waited for U.S.
military police to arrive after widespread looting during Hurricane
Hugo.
   The first contingent of U.S. troops sent to restore calm to the
Virgin Islands arrived in St. Croix today and moved immediately to
secure the airfield and ``deploy troops as necessary,'' Pentagon
officials said in Washington.
   The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. William J. Crowe,
told The Associated Press in Washington today that the troops have
been given rifles and have been ordered to shoot if necessary to
defend themselves.
   ``Keep out or you will be shot,'' read a sign outside an
electronics store in St. Croix that already was stripped of its
merchandise Wednesday.
   At one shopping center, armed guards stood on rooftops to ward
off looters.
   But at another, people wandered freely from store to store,
loading up with shoes, clothes and bicycle tires.
   ``Everybody else is taking it. Why shouldn't we?'' said Nora
Rivera as she stood with her two young daughters beside a grocery
cart loaded with clothes and shoes.
   ``Most of our clothes got wet,'' said her husband, Robert. People
were taking damaged goods that merchants wanted to get rid of
anyway, he said.
   Shaher Abdallah, owner of a ravaged furniture store, disagreed.
   ``We didn't expect the public to do this to us,'' he said as his
15-year-old son, Saker, stood nearby with a pistol. ``They have
something bad in the heart.''
   Several residents said local National Guard troops had joined in
the looting, but the guard's commander denied the charge.
   ``The National Guard trucks are being used to transport food
supplies,'' said Adjutant Gen. Robert Moorehead. ``People see that
and they assume the worst.''
   A few National Guard members directed traffic; none was seen
where stores were looted.
   On the island of St. Thomas, Virgin Islands Gov. Alexander
Farrelly said some looting occurred but that ``there is no near
state of anarchy.''
   He said preliminarly reports indicated no one was killed in the
U.S. Virgin Islands during the storm. No injuries were reported
during the looting spree.
   Ingrid Ellis, a resident, said prisoners had been released from
jail because the building was damaged and no one was there to guard
them.
   ``I ran into a guy on the street yesterday who was a convicted
murderer,'' she said.
   Amid the lawlessness, there were some acts of charity. Ken Lobo
said he helped a friend who owns a restaurant hand out food.
   Dr. Carlos Tejo worked quietly to clean up his one-story frame
house that was flattened by the storm. He and his wife, Maria, moved
into the basement laundry room and tool shop.
   ``I'm going to rebuild this with cement walls and a cement floor
so this won't happen again,'' Tejo said as he looked through the
rubble.
   Mrs. Tejo, who was born a few months before the island's last
major hurricane in 1928, said they never thought of leaving St.
Croix.
   ``I have gone through a lot, and I am not leaving,'' she said.
``We have survived.''
   The island remained without water, power and telephone service,
and officials said it could take a month or more to restore the
utilities.
   Trees and downed power lines littered the highways. Hugo blew the
roof off nearly every building on the island when it struck Monday.
   Wrecked boats were piled on top of each other in a waterfront
street.
   The storm stripped the island's trees, leaving a barren, brown
landscape.
   ``An atom bomb hit St. Croix,'' said Holland L. Redfield II, a
territorial senator. ``No community could be prepared for this kind
of disaster.''
   The Coast Guard on Wednesday used the cutter Bear to begin
evacuating residents and tourists. The Coast Guard in Miami said
today that 100 people had requested evacuation on their vessels, and
a weather research vessel in Christiansted harbor took 200 people
aboard who wanted to leave.
   About 145 St. Croix tourists arrived in Miami late Thursday on an
evacuation flight arranged by U.S. marshals.
   Several tourists who remained on the island said they were being
protected by armed hotel employees but were anxious to leave
nonetheless.
   ``I'll sit anywhere,'' said Rose Hertzog of Northampton, Pa. ``I
don't care if they put me in one of those transports.''
   Doris and Walter Von Weber of Los Angeles still could manage to
joke about their ruined honeymoon as they waited for a ride off the
island.
   ``It's been a stormy relationship before, but this is
ridiculous,'' Von Weber said.

<TEXT>
   Three men armed with AK-47 rifles opened
fire Thursday on a Sunni Moslem member of Parliament, killing him
and his driver and injuring two passers-by, police said.
   Across Beirut and surrounding mountains, Syrian forces and
gunners loyal to Lebanon's Christian leader, Gen. Michel Aoun,
dueled with mortars and tank cannons.
   Police said at least one person was killed and six wounded,
raising the overall toll to 927 killed and 2,731 wounded since the
latest round of fighting broke out March 8.
   The attack on Parliament member Nazim Kadri occurred as the
74-year-old politician entered his car outside his home in west
Beirut at about 10:20 a.m., according to witnesses.
   A police spokesman said Kadri and his police driver, Sgt. Sami
Suleiman, were killed instantly and two pedestrians were injured,
one seriously, in the shooting.
   One witness said the killers jumped out of a red car parked
behind Kadri's.
   ``The gunmen called Kadri by name, the deputy looked at them,''
the witness said, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``Two gunmen
opened fire. Kadri's driver drew his pistol, but another gunman took
several shots at him from an automatic rifle before he managed to
open fire.''
   The witness said the killers sped away, shooting into the air.
There was no immediate claim of responsibility.
   An official obituary released by Parliament's public relations
department said Kadri was first elected as a representative for the
central Bekaa Valley in the one-chamber house in 1951. The former
lawyer was ``repeatedly elected'' until 1972 when the latest
parliamentary elections were held.
   The civil war, which broke out in 1975, has prevented further
elections. Kadri's assassination brought to 73 the number of
surviving deputies in the 99-seat Parliament. Twenty-five have died
and the seat of former President Amin Gemayel became vacant when he
was elected head of state in 1982.
   The latest violence occurred as an Arab League committee tried to
enforce a cease-fire call.
   Druse warlord Walid Jumblatt told the Kuwaiti newspaper Al-Qabas
that the peace plan issued last week by the three-man committee was
``inadequate.'' He demanded guarantees that arms supplies to Aoun
would be cut off.
   Jumblatt said that without guarantees of a halt of weapons to
Aoun, the plan would amount to no more than a ``mere truce.''
   Aoun receives weapons from Iraq, a bitter rival of Syria.
   Syria has 40,000 troops in Lebanon under a 1976 mandate to quell
the civil war. Aoun says Syria violated the mandate by siding with
the Moslems in the civil war, and he has vowed to drive them out.
   The latest violence broke out after Aoun in March imposed a
blockade of ports run by Moslem militias. The Syrians responded by
shelling the Christian enclave north of Beirut, home to about 1
million Christians.

   From an armed landing party in St. Croix to a
station 15 yards from the churning waters off Charleston, S.C., the
Coast Guard has moved to the battlefront of Hurricane Hugo
preparation and recovery.
   ``We're a small service (but) over the years, we've learned to be
very adept in applying our resources,'' said Jack O'Dell, spokesman
for the Coast Guard in Washington, D.C.
   As the storm bore down on South Carolina and Georgia, the Coast
Guard in Charleston, S.C., shut down the Intracoastal Waterway and
nearby rivers to commercial vessels and advised private boaters to
stay put or move upstream.
   ``We've given out warnings over the radios and televisions saying
please do not sail at this time due to the hurricane,'' said seaman
apprentice Iain Wells, who said rescuers would venture out only if
lives were endangered.
   ``If there is a boat that's just drifting, basically forget it.
We're not going to send someone out there to get it.''
   Coast Guard C-130 cargo planes capable of carrying up to 20 tons
of supplies were the first relief flights Tuesday to reach Puerto
Rico after Hugo struck. And in an extraordinary move, an armed Coast
Guard contingent went ashore Thursday in St. Croix after law and
order collapsed.
   ``We were the maritime agency that was in the area,'' O'Dell said
Thursday. ``We have maritime and peacetime missions, but we're still
a military service and we still have to maintain our military
readiness.''
   Six cutters remained in the area Thursday to evacuate anyone who
wanted off St. Croix while others stood by to help as needed as Hugo
churned toward the U.S. coast.
   The modern Coast Guard is part of the Department of
Transportation, but its history of law enforcement dates to 1867
when its predecessor, the U.S. Revenue Cutter Service, was the only
police agency for the Alaska territory.
   The Coast Guard has seen active duty as part of the Navy in World
War I, World War II and the Vietnam War, often escorting convoys and
operating landing crafts.
   Although the Coast Guard is probably best known for its search
and rescue efforts in modern times, it is deeply involved in the
drug war. Its cutters have fired on 18 vessels as part of its drug
interception duties.
   ``You have to be prepared to be ready to use and deploy the ship
in any kind of operation,'' O'Dell said. ``The cutters are equipped
with the necessary armaments to carry out their mission.''
   Both the South Carolina and Caribbean Coast Guard units are part
of the 7th Coast Guard District based in Miami.
   ``There's quite a bit of tug of war going on in the 7th right
now. She's getting pulled from about six different directions,''
O'Dell said. ``If need be, we will have resources moving in from
Cape Cod or California.''

   A high school's war on drugs turned violent
when an angry mother socked the prinicpal in the jaw for calling
police to question her son.
   The woman, whose name was withheld, was arrested Monday for
assault and battery after allegedly punching Otsego high school
Principal James Leyndyke, police Chief Elton Goswick said.
   Leyndyke called police Friday because he suspected a student of
selling drugs, Goswick said. When the youth was told police were
called, he fled on foot.
   The boy's mother later showed up at school, angry that police
were called, Goswick said.
   ``He took her into the office to try to explain the situation to
her,'' telling her it was part of his job, Goswick said. The woman
then responded, ```And this is part of my job,' and she struck him
on the jaw with her fist.''
   The 5-foot-3, 130-pound woman bruised Leyndyke's jaw, Goswick
said. She has posted bond and no arraignment date has been set. The
misdemeanor carries a maximum 90 days in jail.
   Her son was suspended from school.

   Mothers of drug-addicted babies are being
offered a chance to get treatment as an alternative to prosecution,
but some critics said the program would unfairly force women into
treatment.
   ``They go into the program. They successfully complete the
program. They will not have criminal charges arising out of this,''
said Mary McKeown, the assistant state attorney coordinating the
program.
   Charges have been postponed against about 40 women because they
may be eligible for the 18-month residential treatment program,
prosecutors say.
   ``I really think the traditional means of prosecution are not
going to accomplish what needs to be accomplished,'' she said.
   But the experimental program also is raising an ethical and legal
controversy.
   ``Effectively, it's involuntarily committing someone,'' said
Robyn Blumner, executive director of the American Civil Liberties
Union of Florida. ``What you're basically saying is, `Look, you have
a choice, addicted mother. You can either go to treatment or go to
trial, and either way, you're a loser.'''
   Opponents question whether courts will uphold the convictions of
women charged with getting their infants addicted to drugs. Some
critics say it will force women into treatment even though they
haven't been convicted of crimes.
   However, prosecutors and other supporters called it an innovative
way to deal with a complex social problem.

   A school bus was hit from behind by a
delivery truck and plunged into a watery gravel pit this morning,
authorities said. At least 18 youngsters were reported killed and 49
other people injured.
   Divers pulled several bodies from the 12 feet of murky water
covering the bus, which was carrying students to junior and senior
high schools in Mission when it fell on its side into the 40- to
45-foot hole, authorities said.
   ``They were just trapped. We had to break the glass of the
windows to get in,'' said Al Nye, a scuba diver who said he pulled
seven bodies out. Nye, who was driving his children to school at the
time of the accident, said, ``You couldn't see at all in there.''
   Mike Cox, spokesman for the Department of Public Safety, said at
least 18 people, ages 12 to 18, were killed in the 7:40 a.m.
accident, which occurred in clear, dry weather near the Mexican
border about 75 miles from Brownsville.
   Rescuers used a crane to lift the bus from the water but divers
continued searching at midday for any more victims.
   The number of people aboard the 70-seat bus was not immediately
known. The bus driver and the truck driver were being treated at
hospitals, authorities said. Their conditions were not known.
   The owner of the unfenced pit alongside the road was not
immediately known.
   ``We're going crazy here,'' said firefighter Ruben Ortiz. The
youngsters' parents ``are very hysterical. They have really lost
control, some of them.''
   Cox said it was the worst school bus accident in Texas history.
The two worst such accidents in U.S. history occurred in Kentucky.
In 1988, 24 children and three adults on a church outing died in a
fiery collision near Carrollton. In 1959, 27 people were killed when
a bus went into a creek in Prestonsburg.
   Mike Herrera, who was trailing the bus and the soft drink
delivery truck, said the truck ran into the back of the bus,
knocking it into the pit. Herrera said he jumped into the water and
helped rescue three students.
   Witnesses said that immediately after the accident, students and
the driver climbed onto the bus and screamed for help.
   At Mission Hospital, 29 people were in stable condition, said
Nora Martinez, a nursing supervisor.
   Seven were in good condition at HCA Rio Grande Regional Medical
Center, said spokeswoman Betty Baldwin.
   Thirteen were taken in McAllen Medical Center, spokeswoman Judy
Gomez said.

<HEAD>Continued Ban on Electronic Courtroom Coverage Urged</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal courts' policy-making arm is being
urged to continue banning all television, radio and photographic
coverage of courtroom proceedings, a spokesman said Thursday.
   A five-judge committee told the U.S. Judicial Conference this
week that ``circumstances have not changed so drastically'' in
recent years to justify relaxing the ban, said conference spokesman
David Sellers.
   The 28-judge conference, headed by Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist, in 1984 rejected a request by news organizations that the
longtime ban on electronic and photographic coverage in federal
courts be lifted.
   Today, 44 states allow such coverage in their courts at either
the trial or appellate level, or both.
   In its report to the conference, the five-judge committee
recommended that ``technological advances and the experiences of the
states continue to be monitored to determine whether further
modifications of the restrictions would be warranted at a future
date.''
   But one of the committee members, federal appellate Judge John P.
Moore of Denver, voted to end the blanket ban.
   Moore, a member of the Denver-based 10th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals, said each federal court should be free to allow electronic
and photographic coverage to the same extent allowed by state courts
in the same state.
   Rehnquist has said he isn't unalterably opposed to allowing
television and radio coverage of federal courts, including the
Supreme Court.
   ``If I were convinced that coverage by television of the Supreme
Court would not disrupt the way the court works I would give it
sympathetic consideration,'' he told the Senate Judiciary Committee
three years ago.
   But the chief justice has told reporters that a majority of the
Supreme Court's nine members opposes such an innovation.
   Federal court rules permit electronic and photographic coverage
of various ceremonial courtroom proceedings, and allow use of such
equipment for presenting evidence and making an official court
record.
   The committee report recommended that federal marshals be allowed
to use electronic equipment to monitor courtrooms for security
reasons. It also recommended that judges be given more flexible
authority to permit use of electronic equipment ``for other purposes
of judicial administration.''
   The report was authored by the committee's chairman, U.S.
District Judge Robert Peckham of San Francisco.

<HEAD>GNP Grows 2.5 Percent in 2nd Quarter; Outlook Described as `Pretty'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The economy grew at a moderate 2.5 percent pace
in the second quarter, the government said Thursday, down somewhat
from the first quarter but strong enough to stop any new predictions
of imminent recession.
   The Commerce Department reported that April-June growth in the
gross national product compared with a 3.7 percent gain in the first
three months. The second-quarter GNP had been revised downward 0.2
percentage point from the 2.7 percent growth estimate a month ago.
   Nearly two-thirds of the January-March strength came from an
anticipated rebound in farm output. Without the drought effect,
growth actually was only 1.5 percent.
   ``The picture is a pretty one,'' said Allen Sinai, chief
economist for The Boston Co. ``Not too much growth, not too little
... right on the nose for a `soft-landing.'''
   ``The picture,'' said Robert Dederick, chief economist for The
Northern Trust Co. in Chicago, ``is an economy that is continuing to
climb, albeit at a subdued rate ... a laid-back pace, but that's
really what the Fed wants.''
   The Federal Reserve has moved for over a year to achieve a
so-called ``soft-landing'' by dampening inflation by slowing the
economy without driving it into a recession.
   Thus, analysts said, the Fed also should appreciate the downward
revision in the GNP's April-June inflation rate. A price index tied
to the GNP showed a 5 percent gain, rather than the 5.1 percent
estimate a month ago.
   Since the April-June quarter, Dederick noted, ``inflation has
ebbed considerably.'' He said the second-quarter GNP rate ``is the
worst inflation number we'll have for the year and for some time
ahead, at least several quarters ahead.''
   And he predicted ``we're likely to see more of the same on
growth, perhaps a bit lower ... no more than what it has been in the
second quarter and more likely less.''
   The Fed, which influences the economy by controlling monetary
growth, ``will not be influenced by this report'' to reduce interest
rates further at this time, Sinai said. ``In fact, had it known in
June that the economy would have risen this much, it probably would
not have reduced interest rates then.''
   In a companion report, the Fed said after-tax profits of U.S.
corporations fell 7.2 percent in the second quarter, a bigger
decline that the 5.4 percent drop estimated a month ago.
   It was the second consecutive quarterly decline and, Dederick
said, ``shows that economic slowing is not without pain.''
   The GNP is the nation's total output of goods and services and
its broadest measure of economic growth.
   The downward revision in the second-quarter GNP reflected drops
in earlier estimates of consumer and government spending. But
consumer spending, which represents two-thirds of all economic
activity, still increased a healthy 1.9 percent in the April-June
quarter.
   At the same time, business investment spending advanced a strong
8.6 percent and U.S. exports grew 13.1 percent for the third
straight quarter of double-digit growth.
   Housing, adversely affected by high interest rates, fell 12.3
percent.
   On an annual basis, the economy grew at a 3.1 percent annual rate
during the first six months of the year. It will need to expand only
at a 2.3 percent rate for the remainder of the year to match the
administration's goal of 2.9 percent growth for all of 1989.
   The various changes left the GNP expanding in the second quarter
at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $4.13 trillion.

   Identity cards of 130,000 prisoners of the
Auschwitz concentration camp, which once were stored in sealed
Soviet archives, have been released and turned over to the Red
Cross, the Tass news agency said Thursday.
   ``The deaths of over 74,000 people were neatly recorded, day
after day, hour after hour, in 46 huge volumes,'' Valentina
Fatyukhina, head of the Soviet Red Cross research department, told
Tass.
   ``Their names, the birth dates and the names of parents were
written down,'' she said.
   Tass said the information was given to the International Red
Cross, which will soon begin the task of processing the cards,
making it possible to identify the citizens of many countries who
were victims of Auschwitz.
   Auschwitz, in Poland, was one of the most infamous concentration
camps run by the Nazis during World War II. An estimated 2.5 million
Jews were killed at the camp during the war.
   Ms. Fatyukhina said the Auschwitz material was found by Soviet
soldiers at the end of the war and shipped to the Soviet Union.
   Tass said access to the volumes only became possible about a year
and a half ago as more and more archives were opened to researchers
under the policy of glasnost initiated by President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev.
   ``Nobody expected that 130,000 individual cards of concentration
camp inmates existed,'' Tass said.

   A crowded bus crashed into a railroad
crossing barrier in central India and overturned Thursday, killing
10 people and injuring 100, the United News of India reported.
   According to UNI, six of the victims died immediately and four
died later at a hospital in the town of Mauranipur in central Madhya
Pradesh state, about 220 miles south of the Indian capital.
   Twenty-five of those injured were reported to be in serious
condition, the news agency said.
   The accident occurred when the driver of the speeding bus lost
control of the vehicle and crashed into the barrier, UNI said.
   The bus was carrying 110 people from the town of Erach to Jhansi,
UNI said.

   The leftist Greens Party has won court
approval to display a monument to an ``unknown deserter'' during a
government festival, officials said Thursday.
   The Greens say the monument is dedicated to all Germans who fled
Adolf Hitler's rule and refused to serve his army.
   Bonn's conservative-led government objected to the 12-ton marble
sculpture, calling it a political ploy to raise the ghost of the
Nazi era during the federal festival that marks the establishment of
the West German state in 1949.
   The Interior Ministry said other political parties would not be
conducting such ``spectacular, election-style action'' at the
festival Saturday.
   An administrative court in Colonge overruled the ministry's
objections.

<HEAD>Defense Begins Presenting Its Side of Jim Bakker Story</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL NOWELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A laid-off but still loyal PTL employee
testified today that Jim Bakker truly cared about the contributors
he is accused of fleecing because they were the ones who built his
empire.
   Elizabeth Sacco, who answered correspondence at PTL until her
layoff in 1986, testified for the defense today that Bakker was
concerned about the ministry's ``partners'' _ $1,000 contributors
who were promised free lodging at the Heritage USA theme park in
Fort Mill, S.C.
   ``He wanted them treated fairly and politely,'' she testified.
``He said these were the people who built this place.''
   Prosecution witnesses in the 3{-week-old trial have testified
that many PTL employees were laid off at the same time Bakker and
his wife were receiving six-figure bonuses. But Ms. Sacco continues
to back Bakker.
   ``Yes, I do, and I'm proud of it,'' Ms. Sacco said. ``I feel
loyalty because I've seen what this man built. A greedy man doesn't
have his hair turn gray in five years. I wouldn't have taken his job
for $10 million a year.''
   Bakker is accused of defrauding his followers by diverting $3.7
million so that he could live in high style. If found guilty on all
24 counts, Bakker could be sentenced to 120 years in prison and
fined more than $5 million.
   On Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Robert Potter rejected a
defense motion to dismiss the charges on the grounds that Bakker's
religious freedom was violated.
   ``This is not a case about religion,'' said prosecutor Jerry
Miller. ``This is a case about lying to people over television and
cheating them out of their money. ... This is a case about fraud.''
   Earlier Wednesday, prosecutors wrapped up their case, saying
Bakker's ministry had oversold partnerships at its hotels.
   The jurors saw 3-year-old tapes of ``The PTL Club'' show in which
Bakker called the purchase of such time shares ``a deal of a
lifetime.''
   ``We're not here to make money,'' Bakker said. ``I hope my
critics wake up and realize I'd be a fool if I tried to make money
off something like this.''

   A CBS producer on his way to cover Hurricane Hugo
helped two fellow passengers with small children escape a jet crash
before going back into the wreckage to retrieve his cellular phone
for a live broadcast.
   David Hawthorne was among 63 people aboard a USAir jet that
aborted its takeoff from LaGuardia Airport late Wednesday and
skidded into the East River, killing two women.
   ``My first instinct _ I'm no hero _ was to get out of there,'' he
said in a telephone interview.
   Hawthorne used a cellular phone he retrieved from the wreckage
for live reports, first for network-owned WCBS-TV, then for a
seven-minute CBS News special.
   A seven-year CBS employee, Hawthorne, 29, had planned to fly to
Charlotte, N.C., then to Wilmington, N.C., to help cover Hurricane
Hugo. He was sitting near the jetliner's front, which remained above
water while other parts of the cracked fuselage were partly
submerged.
   He saw a woman standing with a child farther back in the plane
and helped them out of the wreckage. Then, he said, ``I went down
toward the exits and I saw a woman holding a smaller infant ... and
she was saying, `I don't know how to swim, I don't know how to swim.'
   ``Until then, I didn't know we were in the water.''
   He helped that woman and her child out onto a wing.
   ``I was just praying that we wouldn't go down and wouldn't have
to make a choice of holding up the baby or the mother,'' he said.
   After they were clear of the torn fuselage, he said he thought,
``I need to let CBS know.'' He said he crawled back into the
wreckage for his portable phone, which he had placed beneath his
seat.
   ``The phone was pinned in between some seats, but I was able to
twist it out,'' he said. ``Then I went back to the exit door because
I didn't want the plane to start sinking with me on it. That's when
I made the initial calls to CBS NewsNet and CBS News.''
   The former, for which Hawthorne is an associate producer, feeds
news stories and footage to CBS affiliates and CBS News.
   When he first called from the wreckage about five minutes after
the crash, startled CBS staff members didn't believe him, he said.
   ``They said, `Come on, you must be kidding, you're in a plane
crash?' And I think a string of words that I don't usually spout
came out. I said, `This call's for real.'''
   After rescue crews took him and the others from the wreckage, he
said, he stood on a nearby pier and began live phone reports,
including a special report with Dan Rather at 12:33 a.m. EDT.
   Hawthorne, a native of Vermillion, S.D., who has lived in the
Bronx for most of his life, went to TV studios Thursday for
interviews on WCBS-TV and ``CBS This Morning'' rather than on to his
original assignment.
   He said he planned ``to go home and get some rest,'' although it
will be difficult.
   ``My adrenalin is telling me that I want to go down there and do
that hurricane story,'' he said. ``But my back is telling me that I
better take it easy. And my wife is telling me'' _ he began laughing
_ ``that if my back doesn't tell me to take it easy, she'll do it on
some other part.''

<HEAD>New Tax Law May End Under-the-Table Payments</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A new federal tax law aimed at collecting
unreported day-care income may thin the ranks of baby sitters and
drive up the cost of child care, tax specialists and industry
spokesmen say.
   The law requires parents to provide the Internal Revenue Service
with the name and Social Security number of their day-care provider
if they want to deduct the cost on their federal income taxes.
   The IRS will check the cost reported by parents with the amount
reported by baby sitters as the agency goes after an estimated $7
billion in day-care income that goes unreported each year.
   ``I don't know that they'll send a grandma to jail, but it will
be tough on them,'' said Barry Barros, a tax preparer who
specializes in day-care provider returns.
   The law applies only to day care provided while parents are at
work.
   ``We will indeed be cross-referencing to see if that baby sitter
claimed that as income,'' said Sarah Wreford, a spokeswoman for the
IRS in Detroit.
   Day-care providers not claiming the payments as income on their
tax returns could be required to pay back taxes with interest and a
$50 fine, Wreford said.
   Barros, of Stockton, Calif., says it may take the IRS two or
three years before it's equipped to double-check a large number of
returns for day-care income.
   Baby sitters collecting money under the table may be more likely
to raise their prices once they are required to declare the income,
Barros said.
   The National Association for Family Day Care, a non-profit
organization representing about 3,000 day-care providers, said it
supports the new law.
   ``The association feels anything that can be done to provide a
more professional setting for child care is beneficial,'' said Kay
Hollestelle, accreditation administrator.
   The IRS says parents who seek the deduction without providing the
Social Security number or tax identification number of their
day-care provider could be turned down for the credit.
   ``We may lose some providers,'' said Carole Quarterman, executive
director of the Child Care Coordinating Council of Detroit-Wayne
County Inc. ``There are some people whose clear intention is to make
some money on the side and not report the income.''
   The credit allows parents and those paying for the care of
mentally or physically incompetent dependents to deduct a certain
percentage of their care costs directly from their income taxes.
Those eligible usually can claim a credit ranging from 30 percent of
the expense, if their income does not exceed $10,000, to 20 percent
if their income exceeds $28,000.

<HEAD>Fadlallah: Washington Stalling on Hostages</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Shiite Moslem cleric linked to the
captors of Western hostages was quoted Wednesday as saying
Washington is delaying efforts to gain freedom for eight American
captives.
   Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah, spiritual head of the
pro-Iranian group Hezbollah, told the pro-Syrian Beirut daily
Ash-Sharq: ``In my opinion, America is following a plan for freezing
the issue of the hostages at the media level.''
   Hezbollah, or Party of God, is widely believed to be the umbrella
for Shiite factions holding most of the 16 foreign hostages in
Lebanon.
   ``America can free its hostages in a very simple way,'' Fadlallah
was quoted as saying.
   ``Instead, the United States is using the hostages as a blackmail
card in its so-called war against terrorism,'' Fadlallah added,
without elaboration.
   Eight Americans are among the 16 Western hostages held in
Lebanon. Thehostage held longest is Terry Anderson, chief Middle
East correspondent for The Associated Press, who was kidnapped March
16, 1985.
   In Kuwait, the newspaper Al-Qabas reported Thursday that Western
hostages in Lebanon could be released soon as a result of recent
intensive contacts between Syria and Iran.
   Numerous articles speculating on the release of Western hostages
have appeared in the Lebanese and Arab press in the past few years,
but few have been correct.
   Syria and Iran are allies in the 14-year-old Lebanese civil war,
backing the Lebanese Moslems against the Christians.
   In a London dispatch, Al-Qabas quoted Arab diplomatic sources as
saying the release of the foreign hostages was the key topic of
talks this week between Iranian officials and Syrian Foreign
Minister Farouk al-Sharaa.
   The sources were quoted as predicting the hostages would be freed
in stages.

   A train crashed into a bus carrying 45
French tourists at an unguarded rail crossing Thursday, killing six
people on the bus, police said.
   At least 28 of the tourists were injured, eight seriously, police
said. There were no reports of injuries on the train.
   The accident occurred at 3:30 a.m. at Sidi Buatmen, 18 miles from
Marrakech. The visitors had attended a festival and were returning
to Marrakech to spend their last night in Morocco before returning
home.
   The train struck the bus at high speed, police said. The dead and
injured were mostly seated in the rear of the vehicle.

   Sammy Davis Jr. was driven to drugs by ``a
terrible insecurity'' but he says he stopped using them after a
sit-down with Rat Pack buddy Frank Sinatra.
   ``He was telling me and looking right at me with his steely
blues, man, looking me right in the eye. He said, `Stop it! ... So
long as you're going to do that, I don't want to be around you,'''
Davis says in this Sunday's Parade magazine.
   ``And I said, `Frank, I'll stop, I promise.' That was nine years
ago.''
   Davis, who was diagnosed last week with throat cancer, credited
his wife, Altovise, and Barbara Sinatra for arranging the
get-together with the ``Chairman of the Board.''
   ``Because of her (Altovise's) love, I had a second chance. And
Frank's. Because of her, I've found my friendships have grown deeper
and more substantial,'' Davis said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of federal employees has charged that a
consumer group is undermining a government auto safety program, but
the head of the organization said Thursday that his group serves a
useful watchdog function.
   ``The facts show that recalls are down and that defective
vehicles aren't being recalled,'' said Clarence Ditlow, executive
director of the Center for Auto Safety. ``Our response is to
continue to publicize when the agency doesn't do its job.''
   Ditlow's comments came after publication in Thursday's editions
of The Washington Post of excerpts from a letter to him from 50
career employees at the National Highway Traffic Safety
administration.
   Employees of the Office of Defects Investigation said Ditlow was
undermining its safety defects program and that the center's attacks
were ``eroding the public's confidence in our ability to pursue
safety defects, thereby discouraging mortorists from submitting
safety defect information to us.''
   ``History proves them wrong,'' Ditlow responded. ``Whenever we
have criticized them, they get more complaints not less.''
   Ditlow said he had not received a copy of the letter but learned
of it from media inquiries.
   NHTSA spokesman Tim Hurd called the letter ``a good clear
statement of the frustration (the workers) feel in dealing with the
CFAS.''
   ``I think the employees are frustrated by the fact that they
can't get recalls like they used to,'' Ditlow said.
   Earlier this month, Ditlow said NHTSA had halted 25
investigations during the Reagan administration under pressure from
the auto industry.
   ``Although some of the decisions were more difficult than others,
to charge that we are captives of the auto industry because
investigations were closed ignores the facts completely,'' the
letter said.
   It also accused Ditlow of selling information obtained from the
agency to lawyers representing automobile accident victims.
   Ditlow said the center makes no profit from computer printouts it
provides ``to the public, not just lawyers,'' with information on
complaints about cars received by NHTSA, along with names and
addresses of individuals making those complaints.

   Greenpeace activists sailed by a
U.S. naval base on this Italian island Thursday to protest the
alleged presence of radioactivity from nuclear-powered submarines.
   The Greenpeace ship Sirius, flanked by several rubber boats,
approached the American naval support vessel Orion and the
protesters unfurled a large banner reading ``Nuclear Free La
Maddalena.''
   Port authorities sprayed jets of water at the protesters and
escorted the Sirius away. No arrests were made.
   Joining the protest were parliamentarians from Italy's Greens,
Communist and far-left Proletarian Democracy parties.
   An Italian Greenpeace spokesman, Paolo Guglielmi, said the
environmentalist group carried out underwater tests last April near
La Maddalena Navel Base that showed traces of radioactivity from
submarines.
   The Italian government has denied the base presents a radioactive
hazard to residents.

   Abolishing travel restrictions on American and
Soviet visitors in each other's countries would end a relic of the
Cold War that is a nuisance but has little practical effect, an
expert on U.S.-Soviet relations said Thursday.
   U.S. officials, speaking on condition they not be identified,
said Secretary of States James A. Baker III would present the
proposal to Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze in their
talks Friday and Saturday in Jackson Hole, Wyo.
   It would lift virtually all travel restrictions on Soviet
diplomats, trade representatives and journalists, the sources said.
It was not known how the Soviets would respond to the proposal,
clearly being made in light of the ``openness'' policies of Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev.
   ``It strikes me as a sensible thing to do at this stage,'' said
Raymond L. Garthoff, senior fellow in foreign policy studies at the
Brookings Institution and a former U.S. ambassador to Bulgaria.
   ``I don't think it's a terribly important matter, but I think
it's an appropriate, a reasonable thing to do.''
   The late Soviet dictator Josef Stalin placed severe travel
restrictions on foreigners in the Soviet Union in the 1950s, and the
United States reciprocated with restrictions on travel by diplomats
and other visitors from the Soviet Union and other Eastern Bloc
countries.
   These restrictions were gradually eliminated by agreements
between the Soviet satellites and the United States in the 1970's.
Garthoff said he signed the last such agreement in 1978, when he was
ambassador to Bulgaria.
   ``From then on I and my staff in Bulgaria were able to travel
anywhere in Bulgaria that any other foreigner was, which meant in
effect the whole country,'' the Brookings scholar said.
   Reciprocal travel restrictions by the United States and the
Soviet Union remained, however, with close to 90 percent of the
Soviet Union closed to Americans and much of the United States off
limits to visiting Soviets.
   ``They are more an annoyance than anything else,'' Garthoff said.
``They don't really prevent the embassies from functioning
adequately, but they do represent something of an anomaly in this
era. I don't think they are really effective in terms of preventing
access or protecting information. They really are more political
statements or gestures than anything else.''
   In practice, Americans and Soviets occasionally are granted
permission to enter the prohibited zones. For instance, Soviet
Ambassador Yuri V. Dubinin was permitted to visit off-limits parts
of the United States several dozen times, an official said.
   Garthoff said this was usually done on a ``tit for tat basis.''
He also said both the United States and the Soviet Union have made
changes over the years in the amount of each other's territory that
is closed.
   The U.S. proposal was dubbed ``Open Lands.''
   If it is adopted, Soviets still would have to register their
travel plans with the State Department's Office of Foreign Missions
for security reasons, officials said. They said the proposal had
been approved by the FBI.
   ``The idea is to abolish the curbs on a reciprocal basis so
travel theoretically is permitted everywhere,'' an official said.

   The Boston Celtics have agreed to buy a TV station
of the Fox Broadcasting network from Rupert Murdoch, owner of the
Boston Herald.
   Fox and the NBA team announced the agreement in a statement
Wednesday but provided no details.
   Murdoch, whose holdings once included the New York Post, had been
under pressure to sell WFXT or the Herald because of Federal
Communications Commission regulations against ownership two media
outlets in the same city.
   The Boston Globe said the price was an estimated $50 million. The
Herald, quoting unidentified sources, put the figure at closer to
$20 million.
   The sale is subject to FCC approval.
   Once the sale is final, the station will be able to broadcast the
Celtics' 39 road games as early as the 1990-91 season. Celtics games
are carried on WLVI.
   ``It's very positive that a station that three years ago nobody
ever heard of and then became a Fox affiliate will now be the
official station of the Boston Celtics,'' said Joe Robinowitz,
general manager of WFXT.
   Fox Television Stations Inc. is a unit on the Australian-based
News Corp., a media holding company controlled by Murdoch. The Fox
network owns seven of its more than 120 affiliates across the United
States, Robinowitz said.

<HEAD>No Exemption for Naturist Religious Society</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW PORT RICHEY, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Walking naked through the woods,
using the land as a spiritual retreat, does not constitute a
religious activity in the definition of this county's tax
authorities.
   The Pasco County Property Appraisal Adjustment Board turned down
an attempt by T. Ward Gulvin, president of the Naturist Religious
Society, to win a tax exemption on 80 acres of undeveloped property
for a kind of open-air church for the uninhibited.
   ``It may be a personal religious experience. But in my mind it's
not the type of religious activity that meets the statutory
requirement for a tax exemption,'' said Allan ``Sonny'' Safranek
Jr., county commission chairman.
   The society is based in Hudson, just up the Central Florida Gulf
Coast from New Port Richey.
   Gulvin told the board Wednesday that ``people who are members of
the Naturist Religious Society use the land as a spiritual retreat.
They want to feel next to nature, and enjoy the trees and shrubs and
birds and flowers and animals ... and all the beauty of nature.''
   But Property Appraiser Ted Williams told the board Gulvin hadn't
established a church. He was unable to provide a list of members,
Williams said, noting that five members of the corporation were
related to Gulvin.
   The society was incorporated in 1944 in New Jersey to provide a
place of worship for those who ``don't believe that it is a sin to
expose the unclothed human body to members of (the) opposite sex of
like belief,'' incorporation papers state.
   ``It appears to be a closely held corporation,'' said Williams.
``I think he is saying ... that because they believe in worshiping
nature, the sun, the breeze and things of that sort, he should have
a church exemption. In my opinion, he hasn't established himself as
a church.''
   Pasco Commissioner Ann Hildebrand said if the exemption request
had been granted, ``You'd be setting a precedent for everybody to
communicate with God on their property and get a tax exemption.''
   ``Nudism is not a religion,'' said Joan Axford of the City
Retreat Nudist Resort in Hudson. ``Nudism is a different way of
life. It doesn't separate people according to their socio-economic
backgrounds. The only thing you have going for you is what's
inside.''

<HEAD>Best Education Ideas Don't Involve Money: Bush Official</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration official in charge of
next week's education summit with the nation's governors said
Thursday that the most promising ideas for improving U.S. schools
don't require more money.
   The best ideas, including efforts to give parents more choice
over which public school their child attends, ``revolve around more
efficient use of the moneys that we are already spending,'' said
Roger Porter, President Bush's domestic policy adviser.
   They do not, he said, ``require more money.''
   Accompaning Bush to Wednesday and Thursday's Charlottesville,
Va., summit will be ``virtually the entire Cabinet,'' Porter said.
The White House, he said, is expecting perfect attendance from the
governors of the 50 states, and several governors from U.S.
territories will be there.
   The aim of the largely closed-door deliberations on the
University of Virginia campus will be to find new ideas to improve
America's schools, Porter said.
   The Democratic leaders of Congress on Wednesday unveiled their
own goals for the nation's schools and promised to press for
``adequate'' funding to help meet them.
   Porter said Americans are spending $353 billion on education at
all levels, from kindergarten through graduate school, including
more than $5,200 for every public school pupil.
   ``We're not going to be announcing any goals at the end of the
summit,'' Porter said. ``What we will be announcing will be the
process by which those goals are going to be developed.''
   The post-summit process of drawing up those goals ``will involve
parents and teachers and administrators and school boards.''
   Porter said the ideas that ``hold real promise for improving the
bottom line ... invariably expand choice for parents and students;
introduce greater flexibility, while demanding increased
accountability for results.''
   ``The president believes the current level of performance is not
acceptable and simply doing more of the same is unlikely to improve
it,'' Porter said. ``New approaches and new ideas are needed.''
   Although the agenda includes a discussion of expanding access to
higher education and training more teachers, the focus will clearly
be on problems in the lower grades.
   Porter, on leave as a professor of government at Harvard's
Kennedy School, said America's universities are ``really quite
phenomenal,'' in part because they are ``incredibly diverse and ...
highly competitive.''
   The topics for the six working groups, announced last week by the
governors, are: teaching; learning environment; governance; choice
and restructuring; a competitive workforce and life-long learning;
and post-secondary education.
   Bush will participate in each of the six working group sessions
with 16 or 17 governors and five or six Cabinet members.
   The working sessions _ three simultaneous 90-minute discussions
on both Wednesday afternoon and Thursday morning _ will be held
behind closed doors, with Bush spending 30 minutes in each session.
   Each working group will be co-chaired by a Republican governor
and a Democratic governor, with a Cabinet member moderating the
discussion. A rapporteur will prepare a report that the president
and the governors will consider in plenary sessions.
   The Democrats' national performance goals include lower dropout
rates, higher college attendance rates and early childhood education
for all poor 4-year-olds by 1995 or earlier.

   Actor Edward James Olmos said he relied on a
``discipline muscle'' to rise from Los Angeles barrio kid to movie
star.
   ``I started off not speaking the language. I was a minority. I
did not know how to read or write,'' Olmos said Wednesday during an
appearance at a high school.
   Olmos, who starred in ``Stand and Deliver,'' told 1,800 mostly
minority teen-agers that developing discipline is like brushing
their teeth.
   ``Since all of you brush your teeth every day, something that you
don't get off on, what makes you think that you can't do something
that you like seven days a week?,'' he said.
   Olmos portrayed math teacher Jaime Escalante in the film. The
real-life teacher inspired 18 inner-city students at an East Los
Angeles to pass the Advanced Placement test in calculus in 1982.

   Baseball fans are shelling out $2 and more
to listen to Oakland A's slugger Jose Canseco talk about guns,
steroids and speeding tickets in recorded messages about his daily
life.
   ``To hear Jose discuss the topics of steroids, his ownership of
guns or speeding, press 2,'' Wednesday's recording said. Or callers
could press ``1'' for this account:
   ``My personal life was kind of boring. I woke up late again _
like I say, I like to sleep late _ and went to a mall with my friend
and ate Italian food.''
   The hotline began this week and is expected to be updated daily.
Callers pay $2 for the first minute and $1 for each minute
thereafter.
   The outfielder said he started the hotline because he was
frustrated by sportswriters who refused to tell the truth as he
views it.
   ``It's what the fans want to hear,'' said Jeff Borris, Canseco's
Beverly Hills agent. ``They want to know what's going on in his
life.''
   Wednesday's recording also included an account of a recent
speeding ticket Canseco received.

   President Bush met with Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard A. Shevardnadze today as administration officials said the
United States will propose to the Soviets a mutual lifting of almost
all travel restrictions for diplomats, trade groups and journalists.
   The ``Open Lands'' initiative, imposed during the Stalin era,
surfaced as Shevardnadze opened high-level talks with Bush at the
White House, in advance of a weekend of talks with Secretary of
State James A. Baker in Wyoming.
   ``It's a big letter,'' Shevardnadze said when asked about a
message he carried from Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev for Bush.
But he and Bush deflected all questions, the president saying:
``This is a photo opportunity.''
   The Soviet foreign minister carried with him still-secret
proposals from Moscow that could accelerate reductions in the
superpowers' nuclear missile arsenals.
   Currently, nearly 90 percent of the Soviet Union is off limits to
Americans, reflecting the suspicions that marked Josef Stalin's
rule. The United States responded through the years to the curbs by
imposing similar restrictions on a large part of the United States.
   The Washington Times first reported the removal of the travel
restrictions in today's editions.
   The FBI has approved the proposal and it is ready for Baker to
present to Shevardnadze during their talks Friday and Saturday in
Jackson Hole, Wyo., the officials said.
   If it is adopted, however, Soviets still would have to register
their travel plans with the State Department's Office of Foreign
Missions.
   This is designed to address security concerns, said the
officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   In practice, Americans and Soviets occasionally are granted
permission to enter the prohibited zones. For instance, Soviet
Ambassador Yuri V. Dubinin was permitted to visit off-limits parts
of the United States several dozen times, an official said.
   It was not known how the Soviets would respond. But the ``Open
Lands'' proposal obviously had in mind the more open policies of
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   ``The idea is to abolish the curbs on a reciprocal basis so
travel theoretically is permitted everywhere,'' an official said.
   Even before Bush received the message Shevardnadze brought from
Gorbachev, the two sides had made siginificant progress on three
fronts: human rights, chemical weapons and breaking the ``Ice
Curtain'' that has divided Alaskan and Siberian Eskimos for more
than 40 years.
   ``Mikhail Gorbachev's letter contains some very important
proposals, specifically, mostly on arms control and on reducing the
military standoff between our two countries,'' he said through an
interpreter. ``And those proposals, I have no doubt, serve to remove
most of the obstacles holding up progress and an agreement.''
   Shevardnadze called for a speeding up of developments in
U.S.-Soviet relations.
   ``We believe that we should not stand still, we should not mark
time,'' he said. ``The experience that we have gained thus far
permits us to hope that there will be further movement.''
   According to U.S. officials, the Soviets have given assurances
that hundreds of Jews who were refused exit permits will be
permitted to depart.
   The Bush administration had presented lists of more than 500
so-called ``refuseniks.'' The Soviet Union replied during meetings
at the State Department on Monday and Tuesday that three-quarters of
them would be allowed to leave, said the officials, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   It was not immediately clear if in all instances exit permits
would be granted, or if some applicants would be allowed only to
travel abroad.
   Also, a U.S. official stressed, ``the proof will be in the
documents issued.''
   At separate arms control sessions, meanwhile, the two sides moved
closer to an agreement to exchange data on their chemical weapons
program and to open stockpiles and plants to inspection by the other
side.
   Left for Baker and Shevardnadze to resolve were details about the
extent of the information to be swapped and whether U.S. chemical
weapons stored in West Germany would be included in the inspection
scheme.
   ``We're quite optimistic,'' a U.S. official said.
   They also are due to sign an accord for regular visits between
the Yupik and Inupiat Eskimos of Alaska and Siberia, thereby
shattering the so-called ``Ice Curtain.'' The Kremlin forbade travel
across the Bering Strait in 1948.
   In a tactical switch, Gorbachev did not send advance word through
diplomatic channels of the contents of the message for Bush.
   Speculation centered on a new approach to break the deadlock on a
treaty to reduce by 30 percent to 50 percent U.S. and Soviet
stockpiles of the deadliest nuclear weapons _ long-range bombers,
missiles and submarines.
   But whatever Gorbachev's letter contained _ and Gennady
Gerasimov, the Soviet foreign ministry spokesman, would not say
Wednesday on American television _ Bush and Baker were determined to
deflect criticism by some congressional Democrats that the
administration was reflexive in dealing with the East.
   Bush said Monday that ``we do want to move forward and are
working inside our own administration to have the proposals that I
think will capture the imagination of the Soviet people.''
   Baker, at a news conference Tuesday, announced that ``to start
the ball rolling'' on strategic weapons negotiations the United
States would withdraw its proposal for a ban on mobile missiles.
   The move has limited consequences. The administration already is
asking Congress to fund the development of the Midgetman mobile
missile. And in the Geneva negotiations, the United States has long
taken the position that a ban would be dropped after ways to keep
track of the elusive weapons were perfected.
   Still, Baker offered assurances the administration had not taken
a ``wait-and-see'' approach toward Moscow.

   A grand jury has handed up an 11-count
indictment charging a federal drug agent, his wife and the owner of
a construction company with conspiracy, tax evasion and laundering
large amounts of cash, officials said Thursday.
   The federal grand jury indicted Drug Enforcement Administration
special agent Dennis Harker, his wife, Mary Ann, and Susan K. Terry,
who owns a construction business in West Des Moines.
   The indictment also charges Harker and Ms. Terry with ``use of an
interstate facility to promote an illegal activity.'' It alleges
that from 1986 and 1988 Harker and his wife ``spent, invested and
profited by cash transactions exceeding $1 million.''
   Harker and Ms. Terry were charged with using a business they
established ``to launder substantial amounts of currency which
Harker had acquired and to funnel the cash through what would appear
to be legitimate business transactions and loans between the two
partners.''
   There was no mention of drugs in the indictment, and U.S.
Attorney Joe Beck refused to elaborate beyond the indictment.
   Harker is assigned to the DEA in Miami, but formerly lived in
West Des Moines. He could face 40 years in prison and $2 million in
fines if convicted on all charges.
   The U.S. attorney's office said the indictment was handed up
Wednesday.
   Arraignment was set for Oct. 2.

   A teen-ager whose steer won grand prize at
the Ohio State Fair will forfeit her ribbon and $28,000 following
charges the animal had been entered another name in Illinois and its
hide dyed to conceal the ruse.
   The Ohio Expositions Commission approved 10-0 today an agreement
reached with the family of 17-year-old Susan Shealy, whose
Angus-cross steer Hank won the blue ribbon in August.
   ``The message is not to cheat at the livestock show at the Ohio
State Fair,'' said Jack Foust, general manager of the fair.
   Foust said officials could not prove suspicions that Hank had
been shown under the name Carl at an Illinois farm show in July _ a
violation of the rules.
   But there was no question, officials said, that a white spot on
Hank's belly had been dyed black at the Ohio fair, also a violation.
   Under the agreement, the Shealy family admitted no wrongdoing,
but the girl from Tiro will not get her prize money and must give up
the ribbon. She and her family also were barred from competition for
five years.
   Family members did not return messages today.
   Farm shows have become increasingly lucrative for farm children
who raise champion livestock. Hank was sold for $28,000 at the fair
Aug. 14.
   Hank's credentials came into question when fair officials
received a tip five days later that Hank might be Carl, a
second-place steer at a farm show in Illinois on July 24.
   Investigators said black dye had been used to cover a swirl of
white hair on Hank's belly. A similar white patch can be seen in a
photograph of Carl.
   Fair rules prohibit misrepresentation of an animal's history or
ownership and any alterations in an animal's natural appearance.
   Hank was impounded when the investigation began so investigators
could wait for his hair to grow out.
   The family of 12-year-old Jeremy Simmons, who exhibited Carl at
the Illinois fair, has also denied any wrongdoing. They said Carl
was destroyed after the Illinois fair.

   A former salesman for the company that prints
Business Week pleaded guilty Thursday to conspiring to trade on
advance information about stocks mentioned in the magazine's
influential ``Inside Wall Street'' column.
   Shayne Walters, 32, of Laguna Hills, Calif., also pleaded guilty
to perjury for lying under oath to an investigator of the Securities
and Exchange Commission.
   The plea expands to the West Coast the government's investigation
of illegal trading using purloined copies of the business weekly
from 1986 to 1988. The magazine was not charged.
   Walters was a sales representative for R.R. Donnelley &amp; Sons Co.,
a Chicago-based printer of Business Week, from January 1983 until
April.
   In entering the plea, Walters agreed to cooperate in the federal
investigation. Assistant U.S. Attorney Carl Loewenson said his
office would recommend a lenient sentence for Walters based on the
information he gives the government.
   Walters faces up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine on
each of two charges. He is to be sentenced April 24.
   The conspiracy charge alleged that from September 1986 to July
1988, Walters obtained advance copies of Business Week from the
Donnelley printing plant in Torrance, Calif., and then supplied them
to his stockbroker who traded on companies reported favorably in the
``Inside Wall Street'' column.
   Walters told the judge he would leave his house at 3:45 a.m. on
Thursdays, the day the magazine was distributed, and drive 45 miles
to the plant to get a copy of the magazine.
   He then would drive back to his hometown and give the magazine to
his stockbroker, Walters said. He also said the stockbroker, who was
not identified, paid him for some of the advance copies.
   Walters was the latest person to plead guilty to schemes
involving trading on prepublication copies of ``Inside Wall Street.''
   William Dillon, a former Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. broker, and S.G.
``Rudy'' Ruderman, the former broadcast editor for Business Week,
had previously pleaded guilty to similar charges. Both were
sentenced to six months in prison.
   At least seven other Donnelley employees have either resigned or
been fired in wake of the Business Week scandal. The SEC also has
sued Dillon and five others.
   In a settlement reached with the SEC in August, Walters agreed to
pay $62,000 in restitution and civil penalties _ an amount double
his illegal profits.
   The perjury charge to which Walters pleaded guilty said he lied
to an SEC investigator on March 16 when he said he had never seen an
advance copy of Business Week.

   U.S. troops sent to restore calm to the
hurricane-ravaged Virgin Islands ``are having an obvious impact in
controlling the looting and other lawlessness,'' White House press
secretary Marlin Fitzwater said today.
   ``Our purpose is to help out in an interim and temporary way
until the local law enforcement can handle the problem,'' Fitzwater
told reporters.
   President Bush authorized the use of the troops to halt a looting
frenzy and protect residents and tourists from the lawlessness
gripping St. Croix two days after Hurricane Hugo's devastation.
   ``The situation there is improving somewhat,'' Fitzwater said.
``The troops are having an obvious impact in controlling the looting
and other lawlessness associated with the destruction.''
   He said it was impossible to predict how long the troops, which
began arriving this morning, would remain on St. Croix.
   ``We stay in close contact with the police authorities on the
islands and the governors and will be guided by their feelings about
when they're in control and when they can handle the situation,''
Fitzwater said.
   The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. William J. Crowe
said in an interview today that the troops have been issued rifles
and ordered to shoot if necessary to defend themselves.
   ``Certainly, we never deploy troops if they don't have the right
to defend themselves,'' Crowe said. ``We've had reports of shooting
on the island. We're not going to permit people to be totally
defenseless.''
   The chairman said the decision was made to send in the troops
after ``federal authorities on the scene were reporting chaos, and
near-anarchy and the situation as being out of control.''
   Crowe added that he envisioned the troops would remain on the
island a ``very short period of time,'' but he did not define the
time any further.
   ``The task force commander, Brig. Gen. Walter B. Moore, is now on
the scene and is assessing the situation,'' said Lt. Comdr. Ned
Lundquist, a Pentagon spokesman. ``He will deploy troops as
necessary.''
   Lundquist said Moore was on board the first plane of some 76
military personnel that arrived at 7:40 a.m. EDT. The contingent
formed an advance team that planned to secure the airfield, set up a
mobile control tower and organize the command structure for the
other troops that will be arriving later in the day.
   ``Members of the armed forces of the United States will be used
to suppress the violence ... and to restore law and order in and
about the Virgin Islands,'' Bush said in a statement Wednesday night.
   It appeared to be the first time in more than 20 years that a
president ordered active duty military personnel into the nation's
streets.
   About 700 soldiers began leaving Pope Air Force Base, N.C., early
today.
   ``I think the show of force is going to go a long way (in ending
the looting),'' said Lt. Gen. Carl W. Stiner, commander of the 18th
Airborne Corps and Fort Bragg.
   The Pentagon said in a statement that 1,105 military police would
begin arriving in St. Croix by early morning on 16 Air Force C-141
Starlifter transport planes.
   The units were to include 635 military police from Fort Bragg,
N.C.; and 470 military police from companies in Fort Polk, La.; Fort
Hood, Texas; and Fort Leonard Wood, Mo.
   On Wednesday, armed Coast Guard crewmen from at least one of the
six Coast Guard ships in the area went ashore on St. Croix, the
largest of the three main U.S. Virgin Islands at 84 square miles, to
try to restore order.
   After Hugo hit St. Croix, damaging virtually every building on
the island of 53,000, looters stripped stores of merchandise and
many residents armed themselves with guns and knives.
   To counter roaming lawless mobs, merchants posted armed guards.
   Local National Guardsmen and police reportedly joined in the
looting. A spokesman for the Pentagon's National Guard Bureau, Maj.
Bob Dunlap, said the reports involving Guardsmen were not confirmed.
   On Wednesday, the popular tourist retreat still lacked water,
power and telephone service. Hurricane winds that stripped trees
turned the lush island southeast of Puerto Rico into a brown
wasteland.
   The island's governor said Hugo caused no deaths, but hundreds of
people were reported injured and thousands left homeless. Holland L.
Redfield II, a territorial senator, said as much as 90 percent of
the island was destroyed.
   Coast Guard cutters evacuated frightened tourists and residents,
some of whom had pleaded with arriving reporters to take them off.
   About 145 St. Croix tourists arrived in Miami late Thursday night
on an evacuation flight arranged by U.S. marshals. The injured,
elderly and pregnant women were given first priority, and other
passengers were taken on a space-available basis.
   ``We just got lucky,'' said Bob McManus of West Point, Conn.
``The looters were everywhere there. They said, `We're in charge
now.' At one grocery store, they just rolled up trucks and loaded
them up.''
   U.S. District Judge Stanley Brotman of Camden, N.J., who was on
temporary assignment in St. Croix, said he first had to protect
himself from the storm, then the armed looters.
   Meanwhile, Virgin Islands Gov. Alexander Farrelly said Wednesday
night he did not ask for the federal troops. Bush had said the
governor of the islands requested the them, and White House
spokesman Steve Hart said later the governor's denial was ``contrary
to the information I have.''
   Usually, in cases of civil disturbances, it is the Guard that is
called out to help restore order, but federal law allows the
president to declare an emergency during civil disturbances and to
use federal troops to restore calm.
   At the White House, presidential assistant James Cicconi was
asked what orders would be given the troops about the use of force.
He replied, ``I'm sure they'd use only that which was necessary and
appropriate.''
   The Pentagon also was dispatching three small reconnaissance
OH-58 helicopters, some transport vehicles and ``appropriate medical
support,'' the agency's statement said.
   The last time federal troops were used to suppress riots was in
1968 in Washington, D.C., after the assassination of Martin Luther
King Jr., administration officials said.
   President Reagan authorized the use of troops in 1987 to deal
with prison riots in Atlanta, but that trouble subsided before they
were deployed.

<TEXT>
   The Bush administration told Congress on
Thursday that it remains committed to enhancing economic cooperation
and dialogue with Asian Pacific nations, but that it will take time,
effort and patience.
   But Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., criticized U.S. diplomacy in
the area as ``complacent'' despite an economic boom in East Asia
that's bringing unparalleled prosperity and trading opportunities
and problems.
   Richard H. Solomon, assistant secretary of State for East Asian
and Pacific Affairs, told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee
that the Bush administration believes it's essential to build a
framework ``to help manage the increasingly interdependent economies
of the Asian-Pacific region.''
   Consultations, he said, are under way with nations along the
Pacific rim ``to strengthen the consensus for an open trading and
investment system essential for sustaining global economic growth
into the 21st century.''
   Consensus building is ``a delicate and measured process'' that is
difficult to rush, Solomon said.
   However, Cranston said ``there is insufficient initiative from
Washington to prepare for the challenges of the Pacific century.''
   ``And key Asian powers appear too willing to trot out the same
tired excuses to avoid the tough decisions necessary to organize for
the challenge of the 21st century,'' said Cranston, chairman of the
Foreign Relations subcommittee on Asia.
   A Pacific Basin Forum, Cranston said, ``would allow us to pursue
such crucial issues as free trade, economic development and security
confidence building.''
   Cranston called for the establishment of a permanent secretariat
to do research and pursue dialogue on a wide range of concerns.
   ``Unless we undertake a deliberate effort to establish a more
mutually beneficial business climate, trade tensions with Asia may
well increase in the years ahead as export-led development by the
remarkably successful capitalist nations of East Asia continues,''
he said.

   Amtrak claims in a federal lawsuit the
state shouldn't be allowed to prosecute the rail service on criminal
charges over the dumping of human waste from train toilets.
   ``The enforcement of the statutes in question would impose undue
burdens on Amtrak, the only interstate passenger railroad, and
threaten the continuation of intercity passenger service in
Floria,'' said Amtrak lawyers Robert Warren and Edward Booth.
   Some train cars used by the national passenger service dump waste
directly onto railroad bridges and overpasses when toilets are
flushed. Other cars have tanks that automatically release waste onto
tracks when a train reaches a speed of 25 mph.
   Amtrak contends in the lawsuit filed Tuesday that federal laws
governing rail service supersede state laws under which prosecutor
John Tanner filed charges. The railroad is asking U.S. District
Judge Howell W. Melton to halt prosecution in Circuit Court, calling
the charges an unconstitutional hindrance to interstate commerce.
   Assistant State Attorney Dennis Bayer rejected Amtrak's argument
and said the state would press on with the case.
   The railroad already had pleaded innocent to the dumping charges.
   Amtrak operates 12 trains daily in Florida. Six pass through
Putnam County by crossing the St. Johns River and Rice Creek.
   Tanner filed the charges after fishermen complained they were
sprayed with sewage beneath a trestle.

   Federal investigators are seeking a
court order to force a hospital to release any psychiatric records
on the pilot who crashed in the Atlantic Ocean after a mysterious
800-mile flight.
   The petition filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court said the
National Transportation Safety Board wants all records related to
the physical and mental condition of Thomas Root.
   Board investigator Andrew Alston said Memorial Hospital in
Hollywood, where Root was treated after his July 13 crash, already
released its medical records but a court order is needed for it to
turn over any psychiatric records.
   Root, 36, a Washington communications lawyer, said Wednesday he
could not comment on the hospital records because he did not know
what they include. Root has said he does not recall how he suffered
a gunshot wound in the abdomen.
   Root says he passed out while at the controls, and his small
plane flew on for several hours on autopilot until it ran out of
fuel and crashed in the Bahamas. It was followed much of the way by
military jets.

   Sixteen Shiite Moslems from Kuwait
were beheaded Thursday for exploding two bombs in Mecca at the
height of the Moslem pilgrimage to the holy city, the Interior
Ministry said.
   An Interior Ministry statement implicitly blamed Iran for the
attacks, which killed a man and were believed connected to the
centuries-old feud between Sunni and Shiite Moslems.
   Four other Kuwaitis were sentenced to 15 years and 20 years in
prison and 1,000 to 1,500 whiplashes for the bomb blasts, the
ministry statement said.
   Nine defendants were acquitted, it said. Convictions and
sentences were decided and confirmed by lower and appellate courts
of Islamic scholars, the statement said.
   A Pakistani man was killed and 16 other pilgrims of various
nationalities were wounded when the bombs went off the night of July
10 as 2 million Moslems gathered for the culmination of the
pilgrimage, or hajj.
   Thursday's report was the first official word that arrests had
been made in connection with the blasts near the Grand Mosque in
Mecca, Islam's holiest shrine.
   The executions were carried out ``in accordance with Islamic
law,'' the statement said without elaborating. Sources close to the
government, who requested anonymity, said the Kuwaitis were
blindfolded and beheaded by sword at dawn in a Mecca prison compound.
   Government sources said Saudi Arabia refused a Kuwaiti request to
extradite the bombers.
   Full confessions from the condemned men will be broadcast on
television, the announcement said.
   It described the blasts as ``an evil crime ... an aggression on
the sanctity of the holy sites and on the pilgrims ... (and) of the
entire Moslem nation.''
   The Interior Ministry said the defendants plotted the attack at
meetings in Kuwait, Mecca and the Saudi city of Medina.
   Their aim, it said, was to spread ``terror and fear in the hearts
of the pilgrims ... and show that (Saudi Arabia) was unable to
protect the house of God.''
   Every Moslem, Sunni or Shiite, has a duty to make the pilgrimage
to Mecca, the birthplace of the 7th century prophet Mohammed, and to
Medina, where Mohammed is buried.
   Sunnis and Shiites disagree about who should have succeeded
Mohammed.
   Iran, which has an overwhelming majority of Shiites among its
nearly 50 million people, had been urging Moslems to seize Mecca and
Medina.
   Without naming Iran, Saudi Arabia's statement said the July
bombings were perpetrated ``at the instructions of the mischievous
ones, who are enemies of this nation and for all pilgrims of God's
house, and cooperating with those mischievous ones on such
debauchery and terrorism in the most sacred spot in the world.''
   Since the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's 1979 Islamic
revolution in Iran, Iranian pilgrims have tried to turn the hajj
into a political forum to spread his fundamentalist teachings.
   In 1987, Iranian pilgrims clashed with Saudi security, leading to
the deaths of 402 pilgrims, most Iranians.
   After that, Riyadh restricted the numbers of pilgrims. This drew
protests from Iran, which boycotted the 1988 and 1989 pilgrimages.
   Saudi Arabia, citing subversion and terrorism, severed relations
with Tehran in April 1988.

   A conservation group that has been pressing for
expansion of wolf ranges said Thursday that it has agreed to pay two
Montana ranchers for livestock believed lost to wolves.
   Defenders of Wildlife said it will pay $1,700 to the ranchers to
compensate for the loss of a cow and seven calves.
   The group said it is paying full market price for the cow, which
animal experts said was a definite wolf kill. Government officials
said the calves were probably wolf kills, and the group paid the
farmers 50 percent of their value.
   Defenders began offering compensation for stock lost to wolves
three years ago. The only other claims under the program came in
1987 when it paid farmers $3,200 in compensation for 10 sheep and
five cows.
   The program is part of the non-profit group's effort to encourage
the reintroduction of wolves into the northern Rockies, including
Yellowstone National Park. Stockmen in that region have opposed
restoration of wolves to the area, fearing losses to the animals.
   ``Those of us who would like to see wolves return to select
locations in the northern Rockies are ready and willing to assume
financial responsibility for such a program,'' said Hank Fisher of
Defenders of Wildlife.

   Cambodians showered Vietnamese
soldiers with flowers Thursday as they began their final withdrawal
from a war that started with a Christmas invasion 11 years ago and
ended the bloody rule of the Khmer Rouge.
   The Vietnamese-installed government said it would carry on the
fight against a three-party guerrilla coalition.
   ``Our friends go, but the special Cambodian-Vietnamese
relationship does not,'' said a red banner in front of dozens of
military vehicles that rumbled out of this northwestern province to
the blare of a pop music band in a government-organized ceremony.
   The only observers of the fanfare were foreign journalists and
official delegations from Vietnam's socialist allies _ Laos, Cuba
and the Soviet Union, the main source of arms for the war.
   As the withdrawal began, Phnom Penh's Prime Minister Hun Sen
returned home from Thailand without a cease-fire agreement. The
Thais had tried to patch a truce together after a failed
international peace conference.
   Hun Sen called on countries to honor pledges to halt aid to the
guerrillas after the Vietnamese pullout.
   Vietnamese officials said 26,000 troops from Siem Reap and other
areas will cross the border into southern Vietnam by Tuesday, ending
Hanoi's involvement in the war that erupted after it invaded to oust
its former Communist comrade, the Khmer Rouge.
   Leaders of the Khmer Rouge and two non-communist guerrilla
organizations in the resistance coalition say the withdrawal is a
ploy and charge Vietnam is hiding troops in Cambodia. The coalition
commands 50,000 fighters.
   China shared that skepticism Thursday. ``It (Hanoi) is still
employing tricks on the question of troop withdrawal and placing a
variety of obstacles in the way of a comprehensive settlement of the
Cambodian question,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman Li Zhaoxing told
reporters.
   Some observers have called Hanoi's intervention ``Vietnam's
Vietnam'' _ likening its withdrawal from a costly, agonizing war
against forces it could not eradicate to the United States' war in
Vietnam.
   Hanoi says 55,300 Vietnamese died fighting the Cambodians, half
of them in 1977 and 1978 before their Christmas invasion. Vietnam's
impoverished population of 65 million also suffered from economic
blockades mounted by non-Communist countries outraged by the
invasion.
   It ended the rule of Pol Pot, who led Khmer Rouge efforts to
force an agrarian revolution in Cambodia. Hundreds of thousands of
civilians were slain.
   ``The West should stop supporting the Khmer Rouge and stop being
fooled by Khmer Rouge propaganda,'' senior Foreign Ministry official
Uch Kiman said at the farewell ceremony.
   He said his Vietnamese-backed government is prepared to continue
fighting, but added he does not believe his country ever would ask
the Vietnamese to return.
   Phnom Penh rejects U.S.-backed demands from the non-Communist
guerrillas who say they rather would have a transitional government
including the Khmer Rouge, the most powerful resistance faction,
than continue fighting it.
   Maj. Gen. Huol Savorn, regional commander of Cambodian forces,
said his troops have taken over the fighting from the Vietnamese
this year in the hotly contested provinces bordering Thailand.
   After the pullout, the guerrillas will launch a major offensive
to try to occupy border areas before striking further into Cambodia,
he told reporters.
   Fighting already has intensified. Cambodian refugees at a U.N.
camp on the Thai border Thursday threatened a strike and demanded to
be moved to a safer place after four to eight artillery shells
exploded close by their camp overnight, a U.N. refugee worker said.
   Across the border, departing Vietnamese troops carried rifles
along with flowers and miniature flags thrown by thousands of
Cambodians.
   The Cambodians, many looking glum and uninterested, stood outside
a kindergarten school built by Vietnamese troops of the departing
Front 479, and waved flags and placards praising and thanking them.
   Organized by authorities into groups were students, soldiers, and
hundreds of children in red kerchiefs _ ``young pioneers'' of the
Communist Party.
   On a makeshift wooden stage, military officers made speeches
denouncing ``Pol Pot genocide,'' and four elderly Buddhist monks in
saffron robes prayed for peace.
   Maj. Gen. Khieu Anh Lon, commander of Front 479, hugged a
Cambodian officer and received a kerchief from a young pioneer and a
bouquet of flowers.
   The general waved the flowers as he climbed into his
weather-beaten U.S.-made jeep to begin the long journey southeast.
   Departing soldiers carried back guitars, photos of Vietnamese
actresses clipped from newspapers, even dogs and a monkey.
   Some had served in Cambodia since 1979 and said they were glad to
return home to their families.
   ``Pol Pot soldiers are weak and we are strong,'' said Maj. Chu
Viet Duong, 32, who in eight years fought many battles against them
and had five medals on his chest to prove it. Unlike many Vietnamese
soldiers, he said he was never hungry and had malaria only once.

<HEAD>737-400: A Good Record, But Some Problems</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-USAir Crash, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Authorities have been investigating recent engine
problems on the Boeing 737-400, the latest model of the 737 series
and the type that crashed into the East River from a runway at
LaGuardia Airport.
   Officials said the cause of Wednesday night's crash was unknown
and there was no initial indication that the 9-month-old plane might
have had engine trouble.
   Passengers said they felt the engine power being cut and then
felt reverse thrust as the pilot apparently tried to stop the
aircraft.
   The twin-engine 737, which can carry up to 150 passengers, has
one of the longest and safest histories of any commercial jet.
   The 737-400 differs from previous models in that it has a more
powerful version of the CFM56 engine, which is produced jointly by
General Electric Co. and Snecma, a French company, said T. Craig
Martin, a Boeing Co. spokesman.
   A 737-400 operated by British Midland Airways crashed Jan. 8
beside a highway about 100 miles north of London, killing 44 people.
It used CFM56-3C engines; the USAir jet in Wednesday's accident had
CFM56-3B2 engines.
   British investigators said initially that the crash may have
resulted from a fire in one engine and the crew mistakenly shutting
down the other engine, but no official report has yet been issued on
the cause, Martin said.
   In June, the Federal Aviation Administration ordered most of the
Boeing 737-400s then in operation grounded because of two incidents
in one week in which the engines failed.
   The FAA ordered airlines to replace certain parts on the -3B2
engines and restrict their power output because of safety concerns.
Most of the planes affected were inspected and returned to service
within a few weeks.
   Martin said the USAir flight that went down was a short-haul
flight for which full thrust would not have been needed. He also
said the plane probably was not involved in the grounding because of
its age.
   A thumbnail sketch of the 737-400:
   LENGTH: 119 feet, 7 inches.
   WINGSPAN: 94 feet, 9 inches.
   ENGINES: Two turbofan jets built by CFM International, a joint
venture of General Electric Co. and the French industrial consortium
SNECMA.
   CAPACITY: Pilot, co-pilot and up to 146 passengers and flight
attendants in typical mixed-class configuration, or up to 168 in
charter configuration.
   RANGE: Up to 2,879 miles.

<HEAD>Agreement Suspending Visa Requirement to Be Signed This Weekend</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Natives of northwest Alaska and parts of
the Soviet Far East can look forward to streamlined travel across
the Bering Strait after the signing of a U.S.-Soviet agreement this
weekend.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard Shevardnadze are to sign a document allowing visa-free travel
by 1,000 or so Alaska and Soviet Yupiks with relatives on opposite
sides of the strait.
   While meeting at Jackson Hole, Wyo., on arms control, the two
also are expected to sign another agreement creating a commission to
resolve minor incidents in the Bering Strait region. Since the
Soviet Union cut off travel across the strait in 1948, there have
been occasional border-crossing disputes.
   Elimination of the visa requirement ``means that family members
will be able to see each other again,'' said Janie Leask, president
of the Alaska Federation of Natives. ``It means that a people
divided by an artificial boundary will once again be able to share
experiences and their culture.
   ``I expect quite a bit of travel, especially from those villages
along the Bering Sea coast.''
   One of those planning to go is Branson Tungiyan, secretary of the
Gambell Common Council.
   ``Now that we've seen some of the ... Russians here at Gambell
we've made friends, and more than likely we have long lost relatives
we haven't seen since the 1930s,'' Tungiyan said.
   Improved U.S.-Soviet relations in the past year have resulted in
several trips across the strait and reunions. This week, 34 natives
from the Soviet Union have been participating in the Bering Straits
Region Elders Conference in Nome.
   Bering Air of Nome recently began offering charter flights
between that town, 100 miles southeast of the Bering Strait, and the
Soviet port town of Provideniya.
   Although the need for visas will end, passports still will be
required. People from each side of the Bering Strait will be allowed
non-visa visits of up to 90 days if they have been invited by
relatives or other people with whom they share a cultural heritage.

   The tiny pieces of UTA Flight 772 first
appeared like confetti in the sand. Then big chunks of the fuselage,
shattered in the crash that killed all 171 people aboard, came into
view.
   It was hard to imagine, during a low-level flight over the crash
scene, that the pieces ever came together to form a jumbo jet.
   Investigators in the Tenere Desert worked in 113-degree heat
Thursday to determine a cause for the crash of the Paris-bound DC-10
two days earlier. They recovered the flight and voice recorders from
the wreckage, a spokesman at the French Foreign Ministry in Paris
said Thursday night.
   UTA, or the Union des Transportes Aeriens, a private French
company that serves Africa and the Pacific, says a bomb was the most
likely reason that debris spread over as much as 40 square miles.
   The pro-Iranian group Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility in
separate telephone calls in London and Paris, although officials
said they could not authenticate the claim.
   Strewn across the sand was a piece of the wing of the 16-year-old
white and blue DC-10, and miles away, the tail. The bright colors of
clothes dumped from shattered bags contrasted with a dull brown
landscape.
   Blackened bodies were scattered across the desert.
   The dead included seven Americans, among them Bonnie Pugh, wife
of the U.S. ambassador to Chad, Robert L. Pugh. Other victims
included a Chadian Cabinet minister, two Swiss priests and eight
children.
   Two French military helicopters were stationed at a small camp at
the site. Two tents and several small vehicles, some with Red Cross
markings also were seen. The force was flown in from neighboring
Chad.
   They were gathering the bodies to fly them to N'Djamena, Chad for
identification, according to Col. Jean-Pierre Job, commander of the
French forces in Chad. His men were the ones who located the
wreckage and were the first on the scene.
   The French Transport Ministry appointed a commission to analyze
the information from the plane's flight and voice recorders.
   The plane was on a flight from Brazzaville, Congo to Paris. It
disappeared 400 miles northwest of N'Djamena, the Chadian capital,
where it had made a stop. The crash area is about 150 miles east of
Agadez, a city in central Niger.
   Crash investigation experts were en route from the United States.
Other officials were on site from Chad and Niger.
   In Washington, the FBI said it was reviewing information from the
crash to determine whether to open a criminal investigation.
   Anti-terrorism statutes give the FBI jurisdiction to investigate
terrorist attacks on Americans overseas.
   ``There is always a possibility of an FBI investigation. Right
now we are on consultation wth other government agencies,'' said FBI
spokesman Charles W. Steinmetz. ``It's certainly a serious issue we
are placing a significant amount of importance on.'' Before the FBI
can enter such cases, it must get permission of the country where
the crime occurred.
   An anonymous caller to the news agency in London said Islamic
Jihad was responsible for the plane's downing and demanded the
release of Shiite Moslem religious leader Sheik Abdul-Karim Obeid,
who was kidnapped from southern Lebanon on July 28 by Israeli forces.
   Islamic Jihad is among several radical fundamentalist groups in
Lebanon believed to be part of Hezbollah, or Party of God, the
umbrella group thought to hold 16 Westerners hostage in Lebanon.
Obeid is a member of Hezbollah.
   UTA said it received an anonymous telephone call about midnight
Tuesday, before the downed aircraft had been located by a French
military plane, saying Islamic Jihad was responsible.

<HEAD>Two Americans Claim New Discovery of Noah's Ark</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two Americans claimed Thursday to have
discovered Noah's ark on the southwest side of Mount Ararat in
eastern Turkey while flying over it by helicopter.
   Chuck Aaron, the pilot, said a square boat shape was spotted
14,500 feet up on the mountain in a place usually covered by a
glacier. He said the area was exposed this summer because of high
temperatures in the region near the Soviet border.
   ``We are 100 percent sure this is the ark,'' Aaron, of Orlando,
Fla., said in a telephone interview.
   There have been various claims of the discovery of the ark since
Turkey lifted a ban on climbing the mountain in 1982.
   Many Christian fundamentalists, who interpret the Bible
literally, believe the ark must be on Mount Ararat. The biblical
account in the Book of Genesis said that after the great deluge, the
ark came to rest on the mountain with Noah's family and a cargo of
male and female pairs of every kind of animal.
   But geologists say even though there is evidence of a flood in
Mesopotamia in Sumerian times, they maintain it is not possible for
a ship to make landfall at an altitude as high as Mount Ararat.
   Aaron said he and his partner, Bob Garbe, discovered and
photographed the object they believe is the ark during a Sept. 15
flight.
   He said he and Garbe, a pharmacist in Colombus, Ohio, have made
five flights in the last three years in search of the ark on the
16,000-foot-high mountain.
   He said the glacier on the mountain only melts enough to expose
the boat every 20 or 30 years.
   Aaron and Garbe belong to the Orlando-based Immanuel Expeditions
Foundation. Aaron said they used donations and $60,000 of their own
funds to finance the expedition.
   He said they plan to return next year for a June climb to the
spot with a team of 20 that will include geologists and
archeologists.
   Aaron said they based their search on information provided by an
American pilot, Ed Davis of Albuquerque, N.M., who said he saw the
same boat shape at the same spot during a flight in 1943, and on
other reported sightings.

<TEXT>
   The Bush administration formally asked Congress
Thursday for $9 million to help the election campaign of Nicaraguan
opposition candidate Violeta Chamorro, declaring, ``We are at a
watershed in Nicaragua.''
   In a message to congressional leaders asking for the assistance,
Secretary of State James A. Baker III called the February 1990
election between Chamorro's opposition coalition and incumbent
Sandinista president Daniel Ortega ``a rare chance for us to support
democratization in a totalitarian society.''
   Most congressional Democrats were still evaluating the proposal,
but initial reaction was positive. After a White House meeting with
President Bush, former President Jimmy Carter _ who will be an
observer at the elections _ said he would support the initiative.
   The administration wants to rush legislation through Congress in
the next week or so in order to make money available in time for
Nicaragua's one-month voter registration season in October.
   Baker said Chamorro has a chance to win, but added, ``We
shouldn't be under any illusions about the battle they face.'' He
noted that the Sandinistas would use all resources at their command
_ the army, the secret police, the government bureaucracy and mass
organizations _ to further their political fortunes.
   Despite the odds, the opportunity to install a new government is
a rare opportunity, he said. ``We are at a watershed in Nicaragua,''
Baker wrote. The election ``pits an under-financed democratic
coalition against an authoritarian state.''
   The aid package would transfer $5 million to the National
Endowment for Democracy for activities like election monitoring,
voter registration, get-out-the vote efforts and party-building.
NED, a private foundation created by Congress in 1982 to support
democratic elections worldwide, has undertaken similar efforts in
Poland, the Philippines, Panama and Chile.
   Another $4 million would be left ``flexible,'' the administration
said, but could go for election monitoring by groups like Carter's
and the United Nations; civic education and get-out-the-vote
campaigns; help in registering Nicaraguan expatriates to vote; and
to pay necessary ``taxes'' to Nicaragua's Supreme Electoral Council.
   Nicaraguan law requires that any foreign money coming into the
election process be matched by a contribution to the council, which
oversees and runs the elections.
   The money would be transferred from unused funds that had been
earmarked for verification teams overseeing a cease-fire in the
country and for humanitarian aid for the anti-Sandinista Contra
rebels.
   Carter, who will be an official observer at the elections, said
there is a need ``to make sure that the opposition parties do have
adequate funds to make the playing field level,'' as well as a need
for money to pay for running the mechanics of the election.''
   He noted that there 4,394 polling places and that each needs 11
observers _ one from each party. ``That is going to cost some
money,'' Carter said.
   Bush met with Carter ``to encourage him in his observer effort,
ask that he try to get the Sandinistas to allow other observers down
there as well,'' said White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater.
The leftist government has blocked some other international
observers.

<HEAD>Bakker Underpaid, PTL Supporter Testifies</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former aide at the PTL ministry
testified Thursday that she still thinks founder Jim Bakker was
underpaid, even though she was laid off during the period he is
accused of taking hundreds of thousands of dollars in bonuses.
   Elizabeth Sacco told a U.S. District Court jury said she's still
loyal to Bakker ``and I'm proud of it. I feel loyalty because I've
seen what this man built. A greedy man doesn't have his hair turn
gray in five years.
   ``I wouldn't have taken his job for $10 million a year.''
   Ms. Sacco, who answered correspondence for the ministry until her
layoff in 1986, was one of the first witnesses to testify for Bakker
as the defense phase of the 3{-week-old fraud trial got under way.
The defense presented videotapes of old ``PTL Club'' shows on
Wednesday before calling the first witnesses Thursday.
   Bakker, who resigned from the ministry in a sex-and-money scandal
in 1987, is accused of fleecing his followers by diverting $3.7
million raised from PTL partners to finance a lavish lifestyle.
Prosecution witnesses testified that he and his wife, Tammy,
received six-figure bonuses in the years before his resignation even
though the ministry was in financial trouble. Mrs. Bakker is not
charged in the case.
   If found guilty on all 24 counts, he could be sentenced to 120
years in prison and fined more than $5 million.
   Partners, who contributed at least $1,000, were promised a set
number of days per year of free lodging at PTL's Heritage USA theme
park in Fort Mill, S.C. But most of the lodging planned there was
never built.
   Still, Ms. Sacco said Bakker was ``very concerned about the
partners. He wanted them treated fairly and politely. He said these
were the people who built this place.''
   Government attorney Jerry Miller asked Ms. Sacco if she ever
heard Bakker telling people he oversold any of the partnerships.
   ``I believe he did not know if, indeed, they were oversold,'' she
said. ``Why would a man who worked so hard fleece his partners and
destroy the place he built?''
   ``How about the Rolls-Royces and $500,000 homes?'' Miller asked.
   ``Wasn't he entitled to have a home?'' she said.
   ``How many homes was he entitled to?'' Miller asked, referring to
prosecution allegations about luxury homes in California and Florida
as well as a lavish home at Tega Cay, S.C. She didn't respond.
   In a heated exchange during the cross-examination, Miller asked
her how an additional $3 million would have affected PTL.
   After being asked the same question several times, Ms. Sacco
replied: ``I guess many people could have been helped, yes.''
   Another witness, Louise Grimes of Hopkins, S.C., the owner of a
gas station, testified that she bought six lifetime partnerships at
PTL and was always able to obtain reservations at the Christian
retreat. She contradicted other partners who had testified for the
prosecution that they had been unable to get reservations.
   Under questioning by defense attorney George T. Davis, she
described the atmosphere at Heritage USA.
   ``I want to say it's heavenly, but I don't know what heaven is
like,'' she said. ``I can tell you that people were happy there.''
   She testified that Bakker had helped her kick her cigarette habit
and that she considered Heritage USA to be a holy place.
   Also Thursday, Vicki Liddell, who worked at PTL's adoption
agency, said the ministry sheltered pregnant teen-agers and
succeeded in placing their babies in good homes.
   ``Those families that could were asked to contribute, but by and
large the bills were paid for by PTL,'' she said. She described the
main purpose of the PTL home for unwed mothers as ``saving babies
from abortion.''

   The historic Bedford Springs Hotel
went on the auction block Thursday, but its owners rejected the high
bid of $5.3 million as not enough for the 185-year-old building and
2,300 acres of mountain land.
   ``I think the vultures were here looking to scoop up a bargain,''
said Hobert Hobbs, vice president of Sky Group International Inc.,
which owns the resort. ``We've been in a lot of battles. We're not
going to give up the war.''
   About 200 people crowded into the lobby of the Bedford County
hotel, but neither the owner nor auctioneer David Fox would say how
many bids were offered during the hourlong auction. Neither
identified the high bidder.
   The auction was held nine days before $4.8 million is due to
Union National Bank of Pittsburgh. The money was spent out of a $7.5
million loan made in 1987 for renovations never completed because of
a dispute between owners that ended up in federal bankruptcy court.
   Hobbs would not say how much Sky Group International wants for
the 244-room hotel and surrounding land, which includes a golf
course and wooded trails. As for the bidding, he said, ``It was
considerably far off.''
   He said the owners would continue to seek new financing to pay
Union National Bank before it forecloses on the property.
   Hobbs said the high bid would not have covered second mortgages
on the property and unsecured debt.
   ``We'd rather take our chances that in nine more days we can find
the financing,'' Hobbs said. ``We're going to continue and say a lot
of prayers.''
   The hotel is a stately stretch of three- and four-story buildings
in the Allegheny Mountains. In its glory days, it attracted notables
including six presidents, but now all but 66 of its 244 rooms have
been closed to guests.

<TEXT>
   Gallo has asked distributors to pull
Thunderbird and Night Train _ the drink of choice among derelicts _
from Skid Row liquor stores across the nation.
   Ernest Gallo, chairman of the E.&amp;J. Gallo Winery, ordered
retailers in such areas Wednesday to halt sales of the high-alcohol,
screw-top wines. The Skid Rows were not identified.
   At the same time, the company said, the wines should not be
blamed for the problem of drinking among street people. Rather,
retailers who sell the products to ``obvious alcoholic derelicts''
should be stopped by stricter enforcement of laws, the winery said.
   ``This practice has led to the assertion that these products
cause Skid Row conditions and, therefore, that by stopping the sale
of high-proof wine the problem of Skid Row can be solved,'' the
company said.
   ``We believe this thinking is naive and that the use of these
products on Skid Row is merely a symptom and not a cause.''
   Thunderbird and Night Train are made with a hint of wine flavor
and fortified with grape brandy to boost the percentage of alcohol
to about 18 percent. The wines usually sell for 90 cents to $1.50
for a three-quarter liter bottle.
   Gallo called the wines ``an affordable alternative to other
alcoholic beverages'' and warned that alcoholics deprived of one
source will simply find another.
   The company claims about 26 percent of the U.S. wine market, with
estimated sales of four million cases of the two wines each year.
Gallo, with about 20 commercial brands, is a privately held company
with total sales of reportedly more than $1 billion annually.

<HEAD>Judge in Frozen Embryo Case Rules Life Begins at Conception</HEAD>

   A woman fighting for control of seven
frozen embryos in an unprecedented divorce case on Thursday was
awarded temporary custody by a judge who ruled that life begins at
conception and the woman should be allowed to carry them to term.
   Blount County Circuit Judge W. Dale Young, ruling in favor of
Mary Sue Davis over her estranged husband, Junior Lewis Davis,
declared that their embryos were children not property.
   ``I'm thrilled. It's definitely what I wanted,'' Mrs. Davis told
a news conference in Titusville, Fla., where she now lives.
   Davis said he would appeal in the state court system, and
potentially beyond. ``They are going to force me to become a father
against my wishes,'' he said.
   Mrs. Davis said she would not try to get pregnant immediately.
``I'm waiting to see about the appeal then hopefully after that try
to have a child,'' she said. ``I could (try) at any time, but I have
to recover from all of this and then consider starting the program.''
   She added that the earliest she would try to get pregnant was
January.
   ``As far as we are aware, this is the first judicial decision
which has declared an embryo a human being,'' said Charles Clifford,
Davis' attorney, adding that he would ask the court to prevent Mrs.
Davis from implanting the embryos until appeals are settled.
   Clifford said the ruling could conflict with the Supreme Court's
landmark Roe vs. Wade decision allowing women to have abortions.
Janet Mayfield, the attorney who will handle Davis' appeal, said the
decision might also conflict with state laws on property interests
and anatomical gifts.
   The case grew out of the decade-old technology of ``test-tube
babies,'' or in-vitro fertilization. The Davises became embroiled in
the dispute after they were unable to have children and turned to in
vitro fertilization.
   The couple produced nine embryos in December under the guidance
of Dr. I. Ray King at a Knoxville clinic. Two were implanted in Mrs.
Davis but failed to develop. The others were put in cold storage.
But then, Davis sued for divorce in February.
   During testimony in August, Davis, 31, said he would feel ``raped
of my reproductive rights'' if Mrs. Davis were allowed to implant
the embryos without his consent.
   Mrs. Davis, 29, argued the embryos represent her best chance of
becoming a mother. She contended that Davis was seeking a right not
normally given to a man _ whether a child should be born after he
has fertilized the egg of his mate.
   After declaring the four- to eight-cell embryos to be children,
Young in effect treated the case like a custody dispute, in which
the overriding concern is the best interest of the child.
   ``From fertilization, the cells of a human embryo are
differentiated, unique and specialized to the highest degree of
distinction,'' the judge said. Thus, he said, ``human life begins at
conception.''
   Young said Mrs. Davis could have temporary custody so that she
could have the eggs implanted in her womb in hopes of becoming
pregnant. Child support, visitation and final custody will be
decided if a birth results, he wrote.
   ``It was the toughest decision of my life as a judge,'' Young
said in an interview. ``On a scale of 1 to 10, it was a 10. I have
agonized over it.''
   Young's ruling relied on a 1988 federal appeals court decision
from Florida affirming the reliability of DNA profiling in
determining a person's individuality _ ``that the life codes for
each special, unique individual are resident at conception and
animate the new person very soon after fertilization occurs.''
   The judge said the Roe vs. Wade decision was ``in directly the
opposite direction'' from Davis vs. Davis. ``Everything the court
said in Roe vs. Wade dealt with the constitutionality of abortion
statutes,'' he said. ``That issue was not before this court.''
   But Clifford said the Roe decision ``contains some explicit
language that says that a fetus, which of course is much further
along than an embryo, is not a human being for the purposes of the
United States Constitution.''
   Regina Smith, executive director of the Pro-Life Council of
Connecticut, called the court's decision ``a victory for unborn
children.''
   Ellen Clayton, an associate professor of law and pediatrics at
Vanderbilt University, called the ruling ``a disaster ... that could
have implications on in vitro research and abortion.''
   In the in vitro process, eggs are extracted surgically from a
woman's body and mixed with sperm in a laboratory dish. Those that
are fertilized can be implanted in the womb. Testimony indicated the
success rate for the procedure averages about one in five.
   The Davises' divorce is not yet final. In his ruling Thursday,
Young instructed Mrs. Davis to file final papers that would complete
the proceeding. The couple did not contest other issues such as
division of household property.

<TEXT>
   William M. Hammon, a retired missionary and
physician widely known for his research of polio and tropical
diseases, has died. He was 85.
   Hammon, recipient of the presidential Medal of Freedom in 1946,
died Tuesday at a nursing home in this community near St. Petersburg.
   In the 1950s, he worked with Dr. Jonas Salk researching an
effective vaccine for polio. Hammon had been a professor of
epidemiology at Harvard University and traveled throughout Africa,
the Pacific Islands and Asia practicing public health medicine.
   ``He was a pioneer in the field of polio,'' said Salk, who
finally developed the breakthrough vaccine that virtually wiped out
the crippling disease. ``His research was part of the progression of
how one might understand how to prevent polio,'' Salk said from his
medical institute in San Diego.
   Hammon, a native of Columbus, Ohio, had lived in the Tampa Bay
area since 1972.
   He was awarded the Outstanding Civilian Service Award from the
U.S. Army in 1973, was president of several national medical and
scientific societies and was a consultant with the World Health
Organization and Pan American Sanitary Bureau.
   He is survived by his wife Helen, a son, daughter and six
grandchildren.
   A memorial service was planned Friday in Seminole.

<TEXT>
   Storm-weary residents searched for
scare water, gasoline and grocery items Thursday as crews worked to
restore the island's water and elecricity, knocked out by Hurricane
Hugo.
   Police said a 94-year-old woman, Emilia Negron Figueroa, was
found dead Wednesday in her home in San Juan, raising to 26 the
number of deaths blamed on Hurricane Hugo.
   The storm hit the U.S. commonwealth Monday after passing through
a string of Caribbean islands. Police said the woman apparently
fell, was unable to get up and drowned when water rushed into her
home.
   President Bush on Thursday declared Puerto Rico and the U.S.
Virgin Islands federal disaster areas, making them eligible for
emergency relief funds.
   A team of 1,100 soldiers dispatched by Bush entered the Virgin
Islands at St. Croix, which was pummeled by Hugo and then hit by a
looting frenzy.
   The Coast Guard in Miami said about 600 people had been evacuated
from St. Croix. It said crewmen on board the cutter Bear reported
that the city of Fredericksted in St. Croix ``erupted'' at sunset
Wednesday and that firing from automatic weapons and small arms
could be heard.
   Adm. William J. Crowe, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
described the situation as ``near anarchy'' and said troops had
rifles and were ordered to shoot if necessary to defend themselves.
   But presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the situation
had improved.
   ``The troops are having an obvious impact in controlling the
looting and other lawlessness associated with the destruction. It is
impossible to say at this point how long they will have to be
there,'' he said.
   Gov. Rafael Hernandez Colon of Puerto Rico said the government
was taking an inventory of the damage and expected disaster relief
money to be made available within two weeks.
   The Red Cross was sending thousands of cots and bedding for some
of the island's estimated 25,000 people still in shelters.
   Coast Guard planes continued shuttling food, medicine, bedding
and clothes to the 8,500 residents of the offshore islands of
Vieques and Culebra, which were devastated by the hurricane.
   Seventy percent of the island remained without water and 25
percent was without electricity. Health officials warned a possible
health hazard if the island remained without water for much longer.
   Luis Ruiz Javier, director of the Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer
Authority, said five electric motors for water pumps arrived from
the United States on Thursday to replace those demolished at
Carraizo Dam, which provides water to much of the capital of 1.1
million people.
   He one of the five motors would be installed by Friday morning
and would begin distributing water to the capital on a rationing
basis.
   By Monday, the authority expected to have water service restored
to 80 percent of the island, which has a population of 3.3 million.
   Many hospitals in the San Juan metropolitan area cut back
services because of water shortages, and at least two, Teachers
Hospital and San Jorge Hospital, stopped admitting patients
Wednesday.
   At Ashford Presbyterian Community Hospital, personnel worked 36
hours straight to deliver babies and take care of the injured from
the hurricane, said Ivan Millon, the hospital's executive director.
   ``Everybody's pitching in,'' he said. The hospital had its own
water supply and generators, he said.
   Supermarkets were opened on shortened hours, but bottled water
and canned foods were almost impossible to find. There was also
shortages of baby food, disposal diapers and milk.
   ``Yesterday we sold all the water we have,'' said Pilar Colon,
manager of a 7-Eleven. Looters stole the store's cigarettes and
liquor after the hurricane broke its front windows.
   Hernandez Colon said dairies back in operation after being shut
down by power outages had agreed to donate 300,000 quarts of milk a
day to the needy.
   Gasoline was also in short supply in some areas. A line of more
than a dozen cars waited at one of the few service stations opened
in San Juan.

   New Yorkers prepared Thursday for weekend
telethons, fund-raising concerts and church collections to benefit
Puerto Ricans left homeless by Hurricane Hugo.
   A Trump Shuttle plane was to leave Friday morning, laden with
tons of supplies, including clothing, air mattresses and water.
   ``We're going to load it up with as much as we can get on the
airplane,'' said Bruce Nobles, president of Trump Shuttle. City
Council President Andrew Stein and Luis Miranda, the mayor's adviser
for Hispanic affairs, will accompany the shipment.
   Stein, noting the 1.5 million New York-area residents of Puerto
Rican descent, said, ``We are going to strengthen our ties and
relieve the suffering for those who are in need. ... In assisting
them, we will be assisting our neighbors as well.''
   The hurricane destroyed or damaged homes of an estimated 129,000
people on Puerto Rico.
   Pop music stars were joining in the fund-raising effort, which on
Sunday includes a telethon on the Spanish-language network
Telemundo, a marathon show at a South Bronx theater and a concert at
Nassau Coliseum on Long Island.
   ``My office has received hundreds of calls, and to my surprise,
the majority of calls are from English-speaking people,'' said the
Rev. Ruben Diaz, executive director of the Christian Community
Benevolent Association, which is coordinating some events.
   ``We have a saying in Puerto Rico that you know who your friends
are when you are in need,'' he said. ``People without knowing us
have come forward and are volunteering to help. It's beautiful.''
   Along with three banks accepting donations for disaster aid in
Puerto Rico, the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York asked its
churches to collect money this weekend for relief work throughout
the Caribbean. The hurricane also struck the Virgin Islands,
Montserrat, Guadeloupe and Antigua.
   Sunday's ``Telethon for Brotherhood,'' from 11 a.m. to 11 p.m.
will originate from studios in New York and Florida, with live
transmissions from Puerto Rico. Singers Danny Rivera, Ruben Blades
and Chayanne are scheduled to perform.
   The Telemundo network of 34 stations reaches three-fourths of the
Hispanic households in America, said spokeswoman Alicia Villarosa.
She said the telethon's ``tentative, conservative'' goal is to raise
$2 million.

<HEAD>USDA Sees Rising Crop Yields in Next Century</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   New projections announced Thursday by the
Agriculture Department suggest that rising crop yields may reduce
the amount of land needed to meet U.S. demands more than 40 percent
by the year 2030.
   Export needs are expected to increase, but growth in yields of
such major crops as wheat, corn and soybeans will more than keep
pace. That will result in less land needed for crops.
   The new projections were included in a 280-page appraisal of the
nation's soil and water resources ordered by Congress in the
Resource Conservation Act of 1977.
   In its first RCA appraisal published in 1981, USDA analysts said
that almost 390 million acres would be required by 2030. By
comparison, slightly more than 380 million acres were used for crops
in 1982, the base year for the new projections.
   Under ``intermediate'' conditions assumed in the latest study,
cropland acreage in 2030 is projected to be slightly less than 220
million acres.
   ``The differences in the two projections of acreages needed do
not result primarily from differences in projected demand (for
commodities),'' the report said.
   ``In fact,'' it continued, ``for the major crops _ corn, sorghum,
soybeans and wheat _ projections of quantities needed are higher in
the second appraisal than in the first, largely because projected
export demands are higher.''
   The report said that domestic use of some grains in 2030 may be
lower than anticipated previously because of improvements in
livestock feeding efficiency and much greater use of pasture and
forage. Also, per capita projections of red meat consumption are
lower in the new appraisal.
   But the main reason for the differences in the amount of cropland
that will be required in 2030 stems from the projected rates of crop
yields.
   For example, in the first appraisal, average corn yields in 2030
were projected at a U.S. average of 144 bushels per acre. The 1989
harvest is currently estimated at 112.4 bushels per acre.
   The new appraisal puts 2030 corn yields at 198 bushels per acre.
Sorghum would go to 127 bushels per acre, compared with 67 projected
in the first appraisal and this year's average of 62.6 bushels.
   Wheat would go to 70 bushels per acre from 42 projected earlier
and this year's average of 32.9. Soybean yields were projected at 69
bushels per acre, compared with 45 earlier and 32 this year.
   ``The assumptions about yield increases mirror the vastly changed
view of the future that has developed during the past decade,'' the
report said. ``In the early 1970s, many studies indicated that
productivity was increasing more slowly than in preceding decades.''
   At that time, it appeared to researchers that ``without
significant technological breakthroughs and increased investment in
research and extension programs, the rate of growth in productivity
will probably continue to decline.''
   But later research ``provided a basis for greater optimism,'' the
report said. In scientific meetings in 1982 and in 1986, a view
developed favorable to continued technological progress in crop and
livestock production as well as in conservation of the nation's
resources.

   Thousands fled barrier islands and coastal areas.
Bumper-to-bumper traffic stretched at least 30 miles inland from
Savannah. Hotels and motels were booked to capacity in Savannah and
as far inland as Statesboro and Hinesville.
   Coastal school systems canceled class for the rest of the week.
   The National Weather Service said the storm was taking a gradual
northward turn, with the eye headed toward Myrtle Beach, S.C.,
indicating Georgia would be spared the brunt of the storm.
   Authorities still expected flooding, but less damage.
   Officials at Georgia Southern planned to play their game Thursday

   In Charleston, City Hall was boarded up, businesses were closed
and classes at public schools and universities canceled.
   Hospitals in Charleston stockpiled supplies, discharging patients
well enough to go home and moving others to hospitals inland. At one
hospital, officials also prepared for an influx of maternity
patients, since some studies indicate that low atmospheric pressure
could advance labor.

<TEXT>
   J. Peter Grace, who headed a presidential
commission on government costs in the Reagan administration, called
on President Bush Thursday to name a ``waste czar'' to lead a
campaign against waste of public money.
   ``We are in a crisis situation, and nothing less than a war on
waste, with the full support of every taxpaying American, will stop
Congress' wasteful spending,'' Grace told the National Press Club.
   ``To lead the war on waste, I am calling for the appointment of a
waste czar, reporting directly to the president,'' he said.
   Grace, chief executive officer of W.R. Grace &amp; Co., was chairman
of the President's Private Sector Survey on Cost Control, also known
as the Grace Commission, from 1982 until the commission reported to
Reagan in 1984.
   He is now co-chairman, with syndicated columnist Jack Anderson,
of Citizens Against Government Waste.
   Grace said the ``waste czar'' should have authority cutting
across governmental agencies, much like that of William Bennett,
appointed by Bush to coordinate the administration's war on drugs.
   Grace noted that the federal debt stood at $1.6 trillion when he
last spoke to the press club in early 1984, shortly after his
commission's report was presented.
   ``Now I'm back, five years later, and the federal debt stands at
$2.9 trillion, or nearly double what it was in 1984,'' he said.
   He said the waste czar should be given a mandate to carry out the
recommendations of his commission as well as cost-saving
recommendations of the congressional General Accounting Office and
government inspectors general.
   ``We don't need more taxes. We need less spending. We need less
waste. And that's why the American people need a waste czar to
protect their interests,'' he said.
   Grace also announced appointment of Alan L. Keyes, who was
assistant secretary of state for international organization affairs
in the Reagan administration, as president of Citizens Against
Government Waste.

   A state appeals court Thursday threw out the
theft-by-extortion conviction of former congressman and Mecham
administration aide Sam Steiger, saying political arm-twisting
doesn't constitute an illegal act.
   In a 3-0 ruling, the midlevel Court of Appeals said it did not
approve of Steiger's conduct but feared it could have ``a chilling
effect'' on politics if the hardball tactics that Steiger used were
considered a crime.
   Steiger was convicted April 7, 1988, after prosecutors said he
had tried to ``extort'' a vote from state parole board member Ron
Johnson. He was accused of threatening Johnson with the loss of an
outside job unless Johnson voted Gov. Evan Mecham's way in an
administrative matter.
   Just three days before Steiger was convicted, Mecham, a
first-term Republican, was removed from office by the state Senate.
Senate members concluded Mecham misused money in a state protocol
fund and obstructed justice by trying to thwart an investigation of
allegations that one of his aides had threatened another aide. The
allegations were unrelated to the Steiger case.
   Steiger, who served five terms in Congress before resigning in an
ultimately unsuccessful bid for the Senate in 1976, said Attorney
General Bob Corbin had singled him out unfairly when he brought the
extortion charge.
   ``Everybody has forgotten that I was very critical of the size
and the ineffeciencies that the attorney general's office had
created,'' he said. ``It's the most expensive attorney general's
office in the United States and we have the second highest rate of
crime in the United States. It's crazy.''
   ``He was after me not because of Mecham,'' Steiger added. ``He
was after me because I was a threat to the department.''
   Corbin was away from his office and unavailable for comment
immediately. Aides said they had not decided whether to appeal to
the state Supreme Court, but they criticized the appeals court's
decision.
   ``It's bad public policy to say that an independent official can
be threatened with financial harm,'' said Steve Twist, Corbin's
chief deputy.
   Steiger, 60, was the only Mecham administration offical convicted
of any administration-related crime. Thursday's reversal was issued
only hours before the state Supreme Court was to start hearing
arguments on whether Mecham's impeachment and ouster should be
overturned.
   Writing for a three-judge panel, Judge John Claborne said the
theft-by-extortion statute was ``unconstitutionally vague'' because
it doesn't spell out clearly enough what is to be considered illegal
and because it permits ``arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.''
   ``Certainly we do not condone in any way Steiger's conduct,''
Claborne added.
   The court said an executive assistant to a governor must
sometimes issue strong orders to carry out the governor's policy,
even by suggesting that underlings could lose their jobs if they
didn't comply.
   Many of the changes that Steiger was trying to make at the board
have been made since then under the administration of Gov. Rose
Mofford, who was elevated from her elected post as secretary of
state after Mecham's impeachment.
   Steiger was fined and placed on probation after his Maricopa
County Superior Court conviction and ordered by Judge Ronald
Reinstein to perform public service work for the State Bar of
Arizona. He completed the public service work even before the appeal
was decided.

   At least 780 white men have
vowed not to perform mandatory military service in the largest

leaders said Thursday.
   The military said legal action would be taken against anyone who
failed to report for service.
   Leaders of the End Conscription Campaign released names of the
conscientious objectors at news conferences in six cities.
Organizers said the protest was part of a nationwide defiance
campaign waged by anti-apartheid groups since early August.
   As part of the campaign, about 9,000 people of all races staged
an anti-government march in Pietermaritzburg, one of many mass
demonstrations staged since President F.W. de Klerk said his
government will allow peaceful protests.
   Police said when the crowd dispersed there was stonethrowing,
several shop windows were broken and goods valued at several
thousand dollars were looted from stores. Police said no one was
arrested and there were no injuries reported.
   Several major protests have taken place without incident since
then, but Justice Minister Kobie Coetsee said the trouble in
Pietermaritzburg ``can in no way be compared with peaceful and
orderly protests and will not be tolerated.''
   In the nearby port of Durban, police arrested 38 high school
students and teachers when they broke up a march of about 400 mostly
black people protesting the acquittal of a black civic leader
charged with murdering a schoolboy.
   Riot police in Johannesburg turned back several hundred students
from the University of the Witwatersrand who wanted to march to a
local police station to protest the detention of fellow students.
   Teachers and students in mixed-race areas of Cape Town held
several demonstrations, but no incidents were reported.
   In Pretoria, Chief Justice Michael Corbett swore in the new
Cabinet a day after de Klerk's inauguration.
   A pro-government Afrikaans newspaper, Beeld, said in a front-page
story the Cabinet probably will decide within a week or so on the
possible release of Nelson Mandela, Walter Sisulu and other jailed
leaders of the outlawed African National Congress guerrilla
movement. Mandela is serving a life sentence since his 1962
conviction for sabotage.
   The draft resisters include many who have yet to be drafted and
others who have completed their two-year training but say they will
not attend mandatory call-up camps.
   ``We are not prepared to serve in a racist defense force to
uphold a racist system,'' said Chris de Villiers, a lawyer and
acting chairman of the End Conscription Campaign.
   The military said it will take legal action against those who
fail to report for service.
   Military service is mandatory for all able-bodied white men
unless they qualify as religious objectors or win delays, for
example to attend college.
   Draft resisters face jail terms of up to six years, and several
men have been sentenced in the past two years, including two who
received the maximum penalty.
   A press statement said the new draft resisters included
professors, clergymen, executives and engineers.
   ``We will respond to the call-up in different ways,'' the
statement said. ``Some will go to jail. Others will opt for
religious objector status. Many of us will choose between a life in
exile or constant evasion of call-ups.''
   De Villiers, a former army lieutenant, urged the government to
introduce a non-military alternative for political objectors.
   The government does not release information on the manpower of
the armed forces. But an estimated 68,000 conscripts are on active
duty and about 325,000 men are in the reserves at any one time.
   Under apartheid, South Africa's 28-million black majority has no
vote in national affairs. The 5 million whites, about half male,
control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools and
health services.

<HEAD>Schools, Social Service Agencies Should Coordinate Efforts: Report</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TAMARA HENRY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Children who are hungry, sick or homeless are
poor learners, a study by a private educational group said Thursday,
calling for greater coordination between schools and social service
agencies.
   The Institute for Educational Leadership Inc. said the study
found that changing demographics and lifestyles of American families
have created problems that schools alone cannot solve.
   Only 6 percent of families are the so-called traditional ones
with a breadwinner father, housewife mother and two children in
public schools, said the report. Forty percent of the nation's poor
are children, 15 million children are being raised by a single
parent and 2 million children live with neither parent.
   The study, entitled ``The Same Client: The Demographics of
Education and Service Delivery Systems,'' said the average income
for female-headed households with children is only $11,200.
   Harold L. Hodgkinson, director of the group's Center for
Demographic Policy and the author of the report, also pointed to
limited transportation options for the poor _ such as having to
travel by bus and subway to get to work, day care and school _ and
the lack of low-income housing _ 8 million low-income renters
competing for 4 million housing units _ as creating great hardships,
particularly for working mothers.
   As for health care, Hodgkinson, a former director of the National
Institute of Education, said 11 percent of America's school children
are enrolled in special classes for the handicapped. Roughly
one-third of these children, he said, would have a smaller handicap,
or none at all, if adequate medical care had been provided during
pregnancy and in infancy.
   ``It is painfully clear that a hungry, sick or homeless child is
by definition a poor learner, yet schools usually have no linkage to
health or housing organizations outside those run by the schools
themselves,'' said the report.
   ``At a time when service organizations are increasingly strapped
financially, this kind of interactive organization holds promise ...
It may well be that with few increases in funding, we could still
magnify the effectiveness of each dollar several times through
programs based on interagency collaboration at each governmental
level.''
   Hodgkinson said that in recent years, there has been more
dialogue among government agencies with the same function, but one
outcome has been ``organization maintenance, not improved services.''
   ``For the urgent problems we face, this is not enough. Service
organizations must begin to see their interdependence across
functional lines,'' he said.

<HEAD>Teen Loses $28,000 Prize for Allegedly Using Same Steer in Two Competitions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB LEWIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A girl whose steer won first prize at the
Ohio State Fair must forfeit the $28,000 because the animal's hide
had been dyed, allegedly to mask that it had been entered under a
different name in another fair.
   The Ohio Expositions Commission, which operates the fair,
approved an agreement reached with the family of 17-year-old Susan
Shealy, whose steer named Hank won the prize in August. The family
admits to no wrongdoing, but the girl will not get her prize money
and must give up her first-place ribbon. She and her family also
were barred from competition for five years.
   ``The message is not to cheat at the livestock show at the Ohio
State Fair,'' said Jack Foust, general manager of the fair.
   Foust said officials could not prove suspicions that Hank had
also been shown under the name Carl at the Iroquois County Fair in
Illinois in July _ a violation of the rules. But, he said
investigators for the Ohio fair found that a white spot on Hank's
belly had been dyed black, which is also against the rules.
   Illinois officials did not have nose prints of Carl to compare
with those of Hank taken at the Ohio fair, Foust said. Carl was the
second-prize steer at the Illinois fair.
   Hank, a 1,245-pound Angus-cross steer, had been impounded at an
Ohio State University barn while investigators waited for his hair
to grow out. The Shealy family picked him up on Thursday.
   ``We're happy Ohio is strict, but I wish Illinois was as strict
as Ohio, because if they were we'd have nose prints and could prove
that they're two separate steers and we'd get you people off our
back,'' said a boy who identified himself only as a family member
when reached at the Shealy's home.
   The agreement was reached two weeks ago.
   Hank's credentials came into question when fair officials
received a tip from an Illinois extension agent on Aug. 19 that Hank
might be Carl, named reserve champion at the Iroquois County Fair in
Illionois on July 24.
   Investigators said black dye had been used to cover a swirl of
white hair on Hank's belly. A similar white patch can be seen in a
photograph of Carl.
   Fair rules prohibit misrepresentation of an animal's history or
ownership and forbid any alterations in an animal's natural
appearance. Under the rules of both fairs, an exhibitor also must
have owned the animal since Jan. 1 of the year in which it is shown.
   The agreement states that the Shealys exhibited Hank ``based upon
a misunderstanding created by advice provided a professional
groomer. ... Susan Shealy and the Shealy family believed that
certain coloring or shading of Hank the steer was fair and
appropriate to successfully present Hank the steer for competition.''
   The groomer was not identified.
   Foust said that, under state fair rules, there will be no grand
champion this year.
   The family of 12-year-old Jeremy Simmons, who exhibited Carl at
the Illinois fair, has denied any wrongdoing. They said Carl was
destroyed after the fair.
   Marvin Perzee, chairman of the Illinois fair, could not be
reached for comment Thursday. Telephone calls to him were not
answered.
   The $28,000 was the highest bid made for Hank at the state fair's
Sale of Champions on Aug. 14. Rod Link of Fremond-based Link
Carnivals bid the money.
   Link was on the road in Oklahoma and not available for comment.

<HEAD>Pravda Apologizes for Article on Yeltsin</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with action to be taken against two
prosecutors who accused Ligachev of misconduct, details. No pickup</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN IAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Communist Party newspaper Pravda printed a rare
public apology Thursday for a report that claimed political maverick
Boris Yeltsin had gone on a boozing and buying spree in the United
States.
   In another case involving public criticism of an official, the
official news agency Tass said the party plans action against two
prosecutors who accused hard-line Politburo member Yegor K. Ligachev
of misconduct.
   In its apology for the Yeltsin report, Pravda said the reporter
who wrote the story had not seen anything of the kind.
   A legislative committee created to serve as a watchdog for the
state media said the account of Yeltsin's purported American binge
smacked of the ``gutter press'' and was unacceptable.
   Yeltsin called the piece ``garbage.''
   The lengthy expose appeared Monday in Pravda. It was originally
published by the Italian newspaper La Repubblica and said the Soviet
legislator left behind in the United States ``a wake of catastrophic
prophecies, insane expenses, interviews and above all the perfume of
Jack Daniels Black Label.''
   The Pravda article was picked up by Tass and distributed
nationwide. Regional newspapers carried it in full.
   A flushed and angry Yeltsin, who returned home Monday from a
nine-city U.S. tour, accused Pravda of seeking ``revenge for the
fact that Americans received us with admiration.''
   The Communist Party daily said Thursday it had instructed its
Washington correspondent, V. Linnik, to contact the La Repubblica
reporter who wrote the original article, Vittorio Zucconi, and check
its accuracy.
   ``Asked whether he stood by the authenticity of everything he
wrote about B.N. Yeltsin in his article, Zucconi replied he had
based it on secondary sources, on a publication that appeared in The
Washington Post Sept. 13 headlined `With Drunken Embraces Toward The
Capitalists' and the testimony of Soviet emigres who heard talk of
Yeltsin's conduct in Baltimore,'' Pravda said.
   The Pravda editorial board offered its apologies to Yeltsin but
appeared to do so only grudgingly.
   The reprint of La Repubblica story's was promoted on the front
page with excerpts saying Yeltsin found the United States ``a
holiday, a stage, a bar 5,000 kilometers long.''
   The apology was on the bottom of page 7.
   Members of the media watchdog committee _ the Supreme Soviet
Committee on Glasnost and People's Rights _ accused Pravda of
deliberately drawing a biased picture of Yeltsin, a deputy in the
Supreme Soviet.
   The Pravda report apparently did little to dull public enthusiasm
for Yeltsin, who revels in his role as an anti-establishment
gladiator fighting for a better life for average Soviets, though he
himself is a member of the elite Communist Party Central Committee.
   On Wednesday night, about 10,000 people rallied in the Moscow
suburb of Zelenograd to show support for Yeltsin and for the two
prosecutors who have made claims of corruption by Ligachev and other
high party officials.
   In its report on the prosecutors Thursday, Tass said the
Communist Party Central Committee directed its Moscow organization
to take action against the two prosecutors, Telman Gdlyan and
Nikolai Ivanov.
   The two publicly accused Ligachev, Yeltsin's archrival in the
Soviet leadership, of involvement in corruption cases they were
investigating.
   However, the Soviet procurator-general's office cleared Ligachev.
   Tass did not say what type of action would be taken against the
two prosecutors, who have themselves been under investigation on
charges that they forced confessions during their inquiry.
   During his U.S. visit, Yeltsin warned Americans that President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev could face a revolution if he fails to improve
living conditions soon.
   Yeltsin, the former Communist Party chief of Moscow, was stripped
of that post almost two years ago by Gorbachev, who denounced him as
politically immature and overly ambitious.
   In a remarkable political comeback in March, Yeltsin won 89
percent of the vote when he ran against an establishment candidate
to represent Moscow in the new national legislature, the Congress of
People's Deputies.

   When Kacey Cisyk walked around Ford Motor
Co.'s Dearborn assembly plant, no one recognized her. Perhaps if
she's just hummed a few bars ...
   Cisyk is the voice behind Ford's ``Have You Driven a Ford ...
Lately'' jingle that's been part of the company's advertising
campaign for eight years. The company estimates that her voice has
been heard 20 billion times in a variety of Ford advertisements
since 1981. Since then, she's also done commercials for Classic
Coke, Delta Airlines, American Airlines and Princess Cruises.
   The New York City woman, who got her first tour of an auto plant
Wednesday, said that after knocking on a lot of doors and making a
lot of demonstration tapes, she got a call from Ford and started
making commercials. A couple of months later, she was told that
someone at Ford named Donald Petersen wanted to meet her.
   ``Honestly, at that time I didn't know who he was,'' she said of
the executive who's now the company chairman. ``But we talked for
several hours about music. He's the only executive from any of the
companies I've done advertising for who has inquired about who's the
person behind the voice.''

   Mules _ the uncelebrated offspring of a
donkey and a horse _ have no pride of ancestry nor hope of posterity.
   But the strong work animal of a bygone era will get some
recognition Saturday when this northwest Alabama town hosts the 15th
annual Mule Day.
   Proud mule owners from several states bring their animals to be
judged.
   There'll even be a reversal of historic farmland roles, with two
mules riding in a cart pulled by two strong men, a Mule Day charity
event.
   The late Curt Estes started Mule Day in 1975, leading a parade
with ``Old Kate.''
   ``He just came to a Chamber of Commerce meeting one day and
suggested we have a mule day,'' said the chamber's president, Danny
McDaniel. ``He said the mule is a dying breed, more or less, but had
been the backbone of the country for a number of years and that we
ought to honor the mule.
   ``The chamber picked it up and we've been doing it since then.''
   Mules now are kept ``mostly for show,'' McDaniel said. ``I don't
think anybody uses them much, although some are used to skid logs
out of woods in rough terrain.''

<HEAD>Cable TV Better Than Critics Think, Cable Executive Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Despite its problems, cable television has a
lot to crow about, a cable executive said Thursday in urging his
colleagues to fight back against widespread ``cable-bashing.''
   National Cable Television Association President James Mooney,
saying ``there is no shortage of cable-bashing going on in the world
today,'' told a cable convention it was time for operators to
``stand up for cable and for what cable has achieved.''
   He said there were 51 million cable homes today, compared with 21
million in 1981, ``not because they have to be _ they're cable homes
because they want to be,'' thanks to an upsurge in first-run
programming featuring big-name stars since cable was deregulated in
1984.
   Mooney spoke to the Great Lakes Exposition cable convention in
Columbus, Ohio. A copy of his speech was released from NCTA offices
in Washington.
   Mooney reminded his audience that many cable programs are highly
praised by TV critics and that a recent Roper Organization poll
showed the public believes that cable cultural, children's, sports
and general entertainment programming is superior to that found on
broadcast TV.
   ``Is it any wonder then that most people _ voting with their
wallets _ think an average of $14.50 a month for over 30 channels of
basic cable is a good buy?'' he said.
   A General Accounting Office report to Congress last month said
the average cable bill, including premium services, went up 14
percent during the first 23 months after 1984 rate deregulation to
$24.68.
   Mooney said that increase was ``significant but hardly
unreasonable'' and that the price hikes had abated this year.
   ``According to the government's Consumer Price Index for this
year, cable bills from January through August went up only 1.4
percent, less than half the the overall CPI,'' Mooney said.
``Clearly, what happened during the first 23 months of deregulation
was an adjustment, and today we're back on track.''
   But a host of bills are pending in Congress that would reregulate
cable as lawmakers react to constituent complaints about poor cable
TV service and increased rates.
   In the face of such criticism, Mooney said it was important for
cable operators to ``let people know the value of what they're
getting'' and also to ``pay very serious attention ... to good
customer service.''
   He said the Cable Act required cable systems to dedicate more
channels for public, educational and governmental access and that
increases in cable franchising fees had fattened municipal coffers
by more than $3 billion since 1984.
   ``We've got to tell our story,'' Mooney said. ``We've changed the
way people spend their leisure hours; we've done for television in
15 years what the broadcasters couldn't do in 30. We've got a great
story to tell, and if we tell it effectively, a great future.''

<HEAD>East Germany Declares Reform Group Illegal</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Refugees</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The communist East German government declared a
newly formed pro-democracy group illegal on Thursday and accused the
organizers of ``anti-state policies'' and attempts to deceive the
public about its true aims.
   A statement issued by the Interior Ministry and carried by the
state ADN news agency formally rejected an application to legalize
the Neues Forum (New Forum) opposition group.
   Neues Forum was established two weeks ago by 30 East Germans
pushing reform of the hard-line government under ailing, 77-year-old
Erich Honecker.
   In a conflicting high-level signal, Deputy Culture Minister Klaus
Hoepcke demanded a state probe into why thousands of young East
Germans are leaving their homeland for the West.
   The Communist Party youth newspaper Junge Welt said Hoepcke told
students and teachers at an East Berlin art college that authorities
should investigate and correct the social problems prompting the
exodus.
   About 18,000 East Germans fled to the West through Hungary after
Budapest opened its border with Austria on Sept. 10 to those
refusing to return to East Germany.
   Legal emigration from East Germany to West Germany is also at
record levels, with more than 80,000 permitted to leave by early
September.
   West German officials earlier predicted about 100,000 East German
arrivals for 1989, but now say the number could reach 200,000.
   Bolstered by the widely publicized refugee tide, reformers
organized Neues Forum to press the leadership for change.
   But East German Communists are likely to be more resistant to
reforms than their Warsaw Pact allies in Hungary and Poland. Without
a communist government, the nation would have little cause to exist
as a state separate from West Germany.
   Hoepcke called for news media reforms and more dialogue between
the East German leadership and its citizens.
   On Wednesday, another prominent politician, Manfred Gerlach, had
questioned whether the leadership should rethink its positions in
view of the decision by so many ``children of the revolution'' to
abandon East Germany for the West.
   The main party daily Neues Deutschland has ignored suggestions
that reforms be considered.
   The ministry statement Thursday said Neues Forum's request for
legalization had been received, reviewed and rejected.
   ``The aims and concerns of the proposed organization contradict
the constitution of East Germany and present anti-state policies,''
it said. ``The signature drive for support of formation of the
organization was not allowed and is therefore illegal. It is an
attempt to deceive the citizens of East Germany about the true
intentions of the authors.''
   In Bonn, West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher told
reporters Thursday he will meet next week with East German Foreign
Minister Oskar Fischer to discuss the refugee problem and conditions
in East Germany.
   They will be in New York for the U.N. General Assembly session.

<HEAD>New Report Finds More Consultant Payoffs; Total to $6 Million</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Inserts 2 grafs new material after 3rd graf pvs, The report</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Federal housing auditors have discovered nearly
$300,000 in additional payments to consultants who won lucrative
rent subsidies for developers, bringing the known total of such
payments to $6 million.
   The payments, detailed in a new report to the Senate Banking
Committee obtained Thursday, included $57,500 more to former
Department and Housing and Urban Development official Joseph
Strauss, by far the most highly paid known HUD consultant with more
than $1.7 million in fees in the last five years.
   The report by HUD's inspector general also revealed additional
payments to two prominent Republicans, political consultant Lou
Kitchin and Frederick Bush, the top fundraiser for President Bush's
campaign. Frederick Bush's nomination for an ambassadorial post was
doomed by disclosures about his role in influence peddling at the
agency.
   Meanwhile, Stuart Weisberg, staff director of the House
subcommittee investigating the HUD scandal, said subpoenas ordering
former HUD Secretary Samuel Pierce to appear before the panel were
being formally served with Pierce's lawyers late Thursday.
   The subcommittee voted unanimously Tuesday to subpoena Pierce to
testify on at least three occasions, the first next Tuesday, as part
of the congressional investigaiton into the department's problems.
Weisberg said Pierce's attorneys had agreed to accept the subpoenas
on behalf of Pierce.
   Payments to five consultants not identified in previous reports
were discovered during a follow-up investigation by HUD auditors.
Those payments totaled $128,000, a relatively small amount compared
to the huge fees paid to more prominent consultants.
   All of the $6 million in consulting fees were paid since late
1983 by developers seeking subsidies from HUD's Section 8 Moderate
Rehabilitation Program. It was an April audit of that program that
triggered the current congressional, internal and Justice Department
investigations of fraud, mismanagement and influence peddling at HUD
during the Reagan administration.
   The April audit identified $4.2 million in fees paid to
consultants and said those lobbyists, some former HUD officials and
other prominent Republicans with little or no experience in housing,
appeared to win special treatment from HUD officials.
   At an August hearing, HUD Inspector General Paul A. Adams said
his investigators had discovered additional payments that brought
known consultant fees to $5.7 million, and in a report sent to the
Senate panel this week Adams said the total had grown to $6 million.
   Kitchin, southeastern regional director for the Reagan and Bush
presidential campaigns, received $90,000 more than had been known
just last month, bringing his total from $25,000 to $115,000, the
report said.
   The first $25,000 was for his work on a North Carolina project
Pierce approved over the objection of several agency experts.
   And auditors uncovered an additional $800 paid to Frederick Bush,
who is no relation to the president but served as a top aide to
then-Vice President Bush and as well as treasurer of his
presidential campaign.
   Frederick Bush was in line to be U.S. ambassador to Luxembourg
but withdrew him name from consideration earlier this month after it
became clear his work as a HUD consultant had doomed his chances of
Senate confirmation.
   The new report also put a price tag on the effect of the 1983
decision to abandon a ``fair share'' financing formula, which
distributed Moderate Rehabilitation funds to based on local housing
needs and ability to administer the program. Instead, spending
decisions became discretionary and were made at HUD headquarters, a
change auditors have concluded opened the door for influence
peddling.
   Of $3.1 billion spent on the program from October 1983 through
September 1988, about 40 percent, or $1.2 billion, was
``misallocated when compared to the fair share percentages,'' the
report said.

   A three-year, $35.4 billion authorization bill
for the nation's space programs was passed by the House Thursday
with only 14 dissenting votes.
   It authorizes NASA to spend $12.8 billion in the year beginning
Oct. 1, some $2 billion more than in the current year. Included in
the authorization is $2.1 billion for the space station.
   The bill, approved 398-14, also authorizes $9.3 billion for NASA
programs in 1991 and $13.3 billion in 1992. The 1990 authorization
is $648 million less than asked by the Bush administration.
   In 1990, the bill authorizes spending $127 million to continue
work on an aerospace plane, the so-called ``Orient Express,'' which
would be capable of flying from Los Angeles to Tokyo in four hours.
Supporters say the technology developed for such a plane is crucial
to keep the United States in the forefront of aviation.
   The Senate Appropriations Committee last week voted to deny NASA
any funds in 1990 for the aerospace plane.
   Included in the authorization is $2.1 billion for the $30 billion
space station that the nation hopes to put into orbit by the mid
1990s.
   The House already has appropriated $12.26 billion for NASA in the
1990 fiscal year, of which $1.66 billion is for the space station, a
13 percent increase over the current $10.68 billion budget.

   A moderate earthquake shook southern Mexico
before dawn Thursday, the National Meteorological Service said.
There were no reports of damage or injuries.
   The meteorological service said the quake, which registered 4.7
on the Richter Scale, struck at 12:41 a.m. (2:41 a.m. EDT). It said
the epicenter was in the Pacific off Mexico and Guatemala.
   Local news services monitored in Mexico City carried brief
accounts of panic among residents who were rousted from their sleep.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph. A quake of magnitude 4 is capable of causing moderate
damage in populated areas, and one measuring 5 can cause
considerable damage.

   Thousands fled Georgia's barrier islands and
parts of its coastline Thursday, but Hurricane Hugo's new northward
path offered hope that the state would be spared its full force.
   ``I think we escaped the brunt,'' said Ed Stelle, Glynn County
emergency operations spokesman, after the center of the storm was
200 miles east of Brunswick.
   The National Weather Service said the Georgia coast could expect
winds of 40 to 50 mph, near tropical storm strength but far short of
the fury closer to Hugo's center.
   Beryl Diamond of the Georgia Emergency Management Agency said
flooding was expected, ``but hopefully we're looking at less
damage.''
   Earlier, GEMA opened shelters and advised about 142,000 people,
more than 95,000 of them in Chatham County, to leave their homes.
   By mid-afternoon, Tybee Island on the north end of the coast and
St. Simons Island to the south were virtual ghost towns of
boarded-up buildings. The only open business on Tybee Island
appeared to be Nickie's Lounge, where a handful of holdouts gathered.
   As he sipped a drink, 63-year-old island resident Charlie Dowell
scoffed at the idea of heading for Savannah.
   ``I don't go in there even when the weather's good,'' he said.
   Authorities said they would cut off electricity to Tybee Island
at 6 p.m., and police prevented most vehicles from entering the
island.
   Gov. Joe Frank Harris declared a state of emergency in six
coastal counties.
   ``It is imperative that citizens heed the warnings to flee
low-lying areas and the barrier islands,'' Harris said in a
statement.
   Many didn't need much prompting. Hotels and motels were booked to
capacity in Savannah, not far up the Savannah River from the
northern barrier islands of Tybee and Skidaway, and further inland
at least as far as Statesboro and Hinesville.
   Most of Tybeee's 4,500 residents fled across a causeway to
Savannah, and many weren't stopping there. Bumper-to-bumper traffic
stretched at least 30 miles inland from Savannah. Many of the
vehicles were towing boats.
   But about 25 surfers lingered. One of them, Cannon Gould, said he
would be moving to his parents' house _ on higher ground than his
beach house, but still on the island.
   ``It's fun,'' Gould said of the surfing. ``I think tomorrow it
will be better.''
   Others fled low-lying areas on the mainland, especially people
living in mobile homes.
   Ann Owens of Brunswick, with two young daughters in tow, stocked
up on bottled water and canned goods at a supermarket. She said she
feared the hurricane would topple her mobile home.
   ``I'm not experienced with hurricanes, but after looking at it on
television I don't want to stand here and take my chances,'' Ms.
Owens said.
   She said she didn't know where she would go.
   Shelters were opened in Savannah, Brunswick and further inland.
The biggest ones were at Georgia Southern College in Statesboro,
with room for 15,500, and the Veterans Administration Medical Center
in Dublin, where officials said nearly 19,000 could be housed.
   Coastal school systems canceled class for the rest of the week.
   Forecasters expected the storm to turn north after striking land,
lessening the danger to historic structures in Savannah, which was
founded in 1733 as one of the nation's first planned communities.
   The barrier islands _ Tybee, Cumberland, St. Simons, Jekyll and
others _ also are rich in history. They hold wilderness areas and
luxury resorts, the graveyards of former slaves and the ruins of
once-prosperous rice and cotton plantations.
   Wild ponies roam Cumberland Island, while at the turn of the
century Jekyll was home to 20-room cottages inhabited by the likes
of the Rockefellers, Morgans and Vanderbilts.

<HEAD>GAO Report Sees Problems in Veterans' Housing Loan Program</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GREENE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A veterans' housing loan program is having
financial problems because of high foreclosures and may require more
aid than the Veterans Affairs Department has requested, according to
a government audit.
   The General Accounting Office audit covered the department's
financial statements for 1987 and '88, but made special note of VA's
housing loan program.
   ``The primary cause of the loan guaranty fund's increased need
for funding beyond that generated through normal operations was the
weakened financial condition of certain sectors of the economy,
particularly energy and agriculture,'' according to the report
released this week.
   The loan guaranty fund guarantees a portion of private sector
loans made to eligible veterans at special terms. About 13 million
veterans have taken advantage of VA housing programs.
   The fund largely paid its ways through the 1970s, but its
requirement for appropriations and money transfers ``has increased
significantly since 1980.''
   The fund required $900 million in transfers and appropriations in
1988, the GAO said.
   Congress and the VA are making several efforts to address the
issue, and VA says the problem is lessening because of a decline in
foreclosures.
   VA had 44,693 home loan foreclosures in fiscal 1987 and 48,963 in
fiscal 1988, the report said. Foreclosures totaled 38,721 in the
first 10 months of this fiscal year, said VA spokeswoman Donna St.
John.
   ``We expect further improvements ... and we expect the numbers to
continue to decrease,'' she said.
   VA says the fiscal year appropriation for the fund was $778
million, with $120 million of that in supplemental funds,.
   The GAO report says VA will need about $100 million in tranfers
from the direct loan fund plus about $453 million in additional
direct appropriations in fiscal 1990. The direct loan fund is a
separate fund used for direct mortgage loans to severely disabled
veterans.
   The report noted several possible influences that would change
VA's estimates:
   _A higher foreclosure rate than VA's projection.
   _The continued sale, without-recourse, of loans on properties
aquired by VA through defaults.
   When VA finances foreclosed property sales, it can package
several loans for sale to an investor. The sale with recourse
guarantees that VA will make good on any future default. Without
recourse means the investor cannot go against VA. The
without-recourse loans, though supposedly providing less liability,
provide less cash at time of sale, GAO says.
   A law will prevent VA from making without-recourse sales after
Sept. 30, but VA is proposing legislation to give it flexibility in
determining which types of loans to sell.
   _ A ``significant lapse'' of VA's authority to collect a 1
percent funding fee on loans. The last time there was such a lapse _
six weeks in 1988 _ VA lost $30 million, GAO said.

   House Democratic leaders struggled Thursday to
sell party members on a deficit-reduction plan whose key element is
a multibillion-dollar tax increase for the nation's 600,000 richest
taxpayers.
   But there was no rush by rank-and-file Democrats to embrace the
proposal, aimed at staving off President Bush's plan to cut the tax
on capital gains. The Democratic alternative has a capital-gains
break of its own.
   ``This is an awful plan,'' Rep. Byron L. Dorgan, D-N.D., a member
of the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee, said of the proposal.
``George Bush wants to give big tax breaks to the rich, and we want
to give them to the near-rich.''
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., defended the plan, which
includes tax-deductible Individual Retirement Accounts for all
workers, as fair and sound.
   ``There is very substantial positive reaction to this proposal,''
he said.
   Ways and Means Chairman Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., who would be
expected to manage the Democratic alternative in the House, said
after a closed meeting with party whips: ``There's not too much
unity here.''
   Also attending that meeting was Democratic National Committee
Chairman Ron Brown, who recently cautioned party lawmakers against
repeatedly calling for tax increases in the face of Bush's
no-tax-increase pledge.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater complained that expanding
IRAs ``amounts to a tax increase.''
   ``If you institute a proposal that reduces revenue, the
government deficit gets larger and leaves you with even more
pressure for a tax increase,'' Fitzwater said.
   House Republican Whip Newt Gingrich of Georgia told colleagues
that he was ``absolutely amazed that liberal Democrats would rush
into a tax-increase fight after the lessons of 1984 and 1988,'' when
Democratic presidential candidates portrayed as favoring higher
taxes were swamped.
   The Democrats' still-emerging plan is intended as a substitute
for the capital-gains tax cut that Republicans and six maverick
Democrats pushed through Ways and Means last week. The cut, which
Bush endorsed, is part of the committee's deficit-reduction plan.
   Democratic leaders note estimates that 80 percent of the benefit
of the capital-gains reduction would go to those with annual incomes
over $200,000. After briefly accelerating revenues, they contend, it
would deepen the budget deficit in 1992 and beyond.
   As an alternative, Democratic leaders proposed:
   _Expanding IRAs so all workers, regardless of income, could have
a deductible plan. The money could be withdrawn without penalty to
finance the down payment on a first home or for college education.
   _Eliminating a quirk in the 1986 tax overhaul in a way that would
raise taxes on the richest 600,000 couples and individuals. The
quirk requires some upper-middle-income Americans to pay a higher
rate of tax on part of their earnings than applies to the wealthiest
taxpayers.
   Under that law, for example, a single person with $75,000 taxable
income pays a top rate of 33 percent on a $10,000 pay raise or
investment windfall. But a $250,000-a-year earner pays only 28
percent tax on a similar increase in income.
   The Democratic plan would apply the 33 percent rate to all
taxable income above $44,900 for a single person and to all above
$74,850 for a couple.
   _Assuring that the 33 percent rate would not apply to any
capital-gains income. Thus, the maximum tax on capital gains, which
for some upper-middle-income people is 33 percent, would be cut to
28 percent.
   Rep. William H. Gray III, D-Pa., who as House Majority Whip is
the Democrats' chief vote-counter, called the proposal ``a
continuation of the simplification of the tax code'' that would
encourage saving and investment.
   Rep. Dan Glickman, D-Kan., said the plan gives the party a chance
to stand for something, rather than just oppose the capital-gains
cut. The capital-gains reduction has drawn little public response,
he said, but ``the mere mention of IRAs caused the phone to ring.''
   Rep. Mike Synar, D-Okla., calling any capital-gains cut a blow
against deficit reduction, said there would be ``a large group of us
that will vote against any kind of change.''
   ``I think it's a mistake for the Democratic Party to be
advocating an increase in taxes until the president has done that,''
said Rep. Ed Jenkins, D-Ga., chief sponsor of the capital-gains cut
that won Ways and Means approval.

   The U.S. Border Patrol is hoping to enlist the
help of the Marines to help intercept illegal aliens and drug
smugglers crossing the U.S.-Mexican border, an immigration official
said Thursday.
   The Immigration and Naturalization Service, which oversees the
Border Patrol, is negotiating an agreement with the Marine Corps
that would allow the platoon of about 45 Marines to conduct
surveillance to help detect smugglers, said INS spokesman Duke
Austin.
   The Marines would operate radar and other equipment to help the
Border Patrol in stopping illegal aliens and drug traffickers,
Austin said.
   The Border Patrol and the Marine Corps are discussing what type
of equipment the Marines will use, he said.
   ``They would not have any arrest authority whatsoever,'' Austin
said. Federal law forbids use of regular military forces in civilian
law enforcement.
   The Marines will have to receive a special legal designation to
enable them to accompany the Border Patrol officers onto private
property, Austin said. U.S. law prohibits military personnel without
such a designation to enter private property. The Border Patrol is
empowered to patrol private property within 25 miles of U.S. borders.
   Austin declined to say what part of the southern border the
Marines would watch.

   The Public Health Service said Thursday many of
its 1990 objectives for a healthier nation won't be met, but said
the agenda for the next decade calls for a longer life expectancy
and a reduction in infant mortality.
   Substantial progress can be made in the 1990s also in areas like
obesity, where little improvement was made in last 10 years, said
Dr. J. Michael McGinnis, director of the Office of Disease
Prevention and Health Promotion.
   ``We know more now about what the risk groups are,'' he said.
   Areas where goals for 1990 apparently will not be reached are
immunization of children before age 2 and flu vaccinations for
high-risk populations, the Atlanta-based national Centers for
Disease Control said in its Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.
   The report referred to a draft of the Health Service's ``Year
2000 Objectives for the Nation,'' released Thursday.
   Tentative targets for the next decade include cutting the
percentage of adult smokers in half, to about 15 percent, and
reducing infant mortality from 10.4 infant deaths per thousand in
1986 to no more than seven. Other goals include raising life
expectancy from 74.9 years to at least 78 and increasing years of
healthy life to 65 years from an estimated 60 in 1987.
   ``Smoking is a good example,'' said McGinnis, a deputy assistant
secretary for health based in Washington, D.C. ``It's accountable
for 390,000 deaths a year. It's an example of where we can target
low income and minority populations, where the most difficult
challenges lie.''
   McGinnis said that for goals to be reached, every sector of
society must get involved.
   ``The most important component is the work of voluntary
organizations,'' he said. ``We have to have leadership at the state
and local levels.''
   In the area of infant mortality, McGinnis said: ``It has been
said that one of the truest measures of civilization is the care
society gives its children. We have had a 35 percent reduction in
infant mortality since the 1970s when the (1990) goal was set.''
   He said infant mortality is an area where ``progress has been
reasonably good, but we need to target areas where the population is
most vulnerable. We have not been able to close the gap between
blacks and whites and have missed the target for 1990 of reducing
the rate for blacks.''
   The service listed 21 areas for improvement by the year 2000.
   ``We ought to be able to anticipate progress in each of them,''
McGinnis said. ``The biggest challenge will be in the area of
violent and abusive behavior.''
   The 21 areas include: nutrition; physical activity and fitness;
tobacco, alcohol and other drugs; sexual behavior; violent and
abusive behavior; vitality and independence of older people;
environmental health; occupational safety and health; and
unintentional injuries.
   Others are maternal and infant health; immunization and
infectious diseases; AIDS; other sexually transmitted diseases;
cholesterol and high blood pressure; cancer; other chronic
disorders; oral health; mental and behavioral disorders; health
education and preventive services; and surveillance and data systems.
   ``We need to emphasize that these are national goals and not
federal goals,'' McGinnis said. ``Federalizing is not the way to do
this. We hope by laying out a common framework we'll be able to
focus our collective resources.''
   McGinnis said in a telephone interview that the planning process
was not complete and that comment was welcome.

   President Bush's meeting with Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard Shevardnadze had at least one light moment,
Secretary of State James A. Baker III suggested Thursday: Soviet
maverick Boris Yeltsin's visit.
   But, a laughing Baker told reporters after the White House
session: ``There are some things that I'm not going to repeat.''
   Baker suggested that Yeltsin's well-publicized visit was brought
up indirectly by Schevardnadze.
   The Soviet Communist Party newspaper Pravda printed a public
apology Thursday for a report that said Yeltsin had gone on a
boozing and buying spree in the United States. Yeltsin had denounced
the report as ``garbage.''
   A senior administration official, who was present for at least
some of the Bush-Schvardnadze-Baker meeting, said that Yeltsin had
not been mentioned by name.
   But the U.S. official, speaking on the condition of anonymity,
quoted Schevardnadze as joking with Bush, ``You can't believe all
the things you hear are going on these days in the Soviet Union.''
   Yeltsin, a frequent critic of Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev,
met briefly with Bush last week as he toured the United States.
   Baker was asked whether the Yeltsin visit came up. ``It was
indirectly alluded to,'' he said. I think it was alluded to by the
other side. There are some things I'm not going to repeat out of
that meeting.''

<HEAD>Germany Urged to Charge Ex-SS General with Alleged Atrocities</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A legislator called Thursday for international
pressure on West Germany to charge a former Nazi SS general after a
new book alleged Wilhelm Mohnke ordered the massacres of British,
U.S. and Canadian prisoners of war.
   Meanwhile, West Germany, which promised 15 months ago to re-open
investigations, announced it would send a government prosecutor to
Britain next week to examine still-secret government files on the
78-year-old Mohnke.
   ``The governments (of Britain, Canada and the United States) must
either bring enormous pressure on West Germany to charge Mohnke on
the facts available or remove his name from the United Nations list
of suspected war criminals and explain why,'' legislator Jeff Rooker
said.
   He was speaking at a publication party to launch the book,
``Hitler's Last General,'' written by two Nazi era researchers, Ian
Sayer and Douglas Botting.
   The book said that evidence in the British files includes
death-bed testimony in 1947 by an SS corporal, Oskar Senf, to a war
crimes investigator that Mohnke ordered the 1940 killing of 80 to 90
unarmed British prisoners at Wormoudt, France.
   The book also described Mohnke as a ``key link'' in the chain of
command during the killing of 72 American prisoners shot at Malmedy
in the Ardennes on Dec. 17, 1944, and in the shootings of some 35
Canadian prisoners in Normandy in June 1944.
   Mohnke has denied all the charges.
   The authors published the names of 11 of the 12 SS troopers who,
they say, are identified in the secret British files as having
herded the captured troops into a barn at Wermoudt, near Dunkirk,
and mowed them down with gunfire and hand grenades. The authors said
three or four of these men were believed to be alive.
   After World War II, allied investigators entered Mohnke's name in
the U.N. War Crimes Commission list as one of some 25,000 ``A''
class suspects accused of serious crimes.
   But Mohnke, who was in Hitler's bunker in Berlin when the Nazi
leader committed suicide April 30, 1945, was captured by the Soviets
and they refused to extradite him. After 10 years in a Soviet jail,
Mohnke was released to West Germany.
   He became a businessman and attracted scant publicity.
   In 1973, West German prosecutors said they had dropped
investigations on grounds there was insufficient evidence.
   Britain asked West Germany to re-open the inquiry last year after
Sayer said he had traced documents showing Mohnke had been sought
separately by British, American and Canadian investigators.
   Mohnke told German newspapers he had done nothing wrong, but took
no action against Sayer or newspapers that published the claims.
   Neighbors described Mohnke as a ``nice, quiet, friendly old man.''
   ``The West German authorities have grudgingly opened their own
investigation but ... the safest refuge on earth for a fugitive Nazi
war criminal is West Germany,'' Sayer said Thursday.
   He added that during the previous West German investigation, the
prosecutors never asked to see the British files. They had also
never asked to see 70 boxes of files with references to Mohnke held
by the U.S. Justice Department's Nazi-hunting Office of Special
Investigations or the relevant Canadian government records, said
Sayer.
   After the war 77 SS officers and men were convicted of taking
part in the massacre of the Americans at Malmedy and jailed.
   Rooker, whose constituents include one of five veterans who
survived the Wermoudt massacre, said ``public-spirited'' people had
given the authors access to some of the secret files on the Wermoudt
massacre.
   The material has been classified under Britain's Official Secrets
Act as confidential until the year 2021. Rooker said government
ministers have told him that this is ``to avoid embarrassment'' _
apparently to relatives of the men of the SS, Hitler's notorious
stormtroopers.
   Rooker, the authors and the five elderly surviving veterans of
the Wormoudt massacre all said Thursday they thought there was scant
chance that Mohnke would be prosecuted.
   ``If anyone wanted to do it, they'd have done it sooner,'' said
76-year-old veteran Charles Daley, who survived in the barn, his leg
blown off, under a pile of corpses.
   Next month, legislators are to vote on whether to allow the first
war crimes trials in Britain. A government inquiry this year said
there is sufficient evidence to charge three British residents,
former nationals of Soviet-occupied territories, with atrocities
against Jews.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. government announced Thursday
it was putting 14 Panamanian companies and individuals on a trade
blacklist, including a former presidential candidate supported by
Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   The blacklist prohibits any U.S. company from dealing with the
14, with a possible penalty of 10 years imprisonment or a $50,000
fine, or both.
   The move was announced in a press release by the U.S. Embassy in
Panama City and in a Treasury Department announcement published in
the Federal Register in Washington.
   It was part of a continuing campaign by the U.S. government to
force the ouster of Noriega, who was indicted by two U.S. federal
grand juries last year in Florida on drug trafficking charges.
   Noriega holds the real power in Panama through his command of the
Panamanian Defense Forces.
   Former opposition presidential candidate Guillermo Endara entered
the second day of a hunger strike to back his plea that Panamanians
refrain from gambling or playing the lottery in an effort to cut
government revenue.
   International observers say Endara won last May's elections by a
3-to-1 margin, but the Noriega-controlled government nullified that
vote and installed a provisional president.
   Carlos Duque, Endara's main opponent and a Noriega associate,
headed the list of individuals and companies residing in Panama that
are banned from doing business with U.S. firms.
   Many Panamanian companies do business with U.S. operations such
as the Panama Canal Commission and the U.S. Southern Command, which
has military installations in Panama with about 14,000 soldiers.
   The United States has moved all its personnel on base and
restricted off base movement.
   Washington imposed economic sanctions on the Panamanian
government early last year, freezing its assets in the United States
and barring U.S. companies from paying Panamanian taxes.
   Canal revenues due to go to Panama were also frozen.
   The Treasury Department blacklist is made up of associates or
friends of Noriega and will probably be expanded, said a U.S.
official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Noriega denies the drug charges and says U.S. economic help to
the political opposition in Panama made fair elections impossible.
   He says moves against him are part of a U.S. plot to renege on
its obligations to turn the Panama Canal over to Panama at the end
of the century.

   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze on
Thursday gave President Bush an unusual gift _ a mosaic on copper of
the capital's most famous sights, including the White House,
Washington Monument and Lincoln Memorial.
   Bush brought the Soviet visitor into his private study in the
midst of their discussions to admire the artwork.
   Shevardnadze and aides met for more than an hour with Bush,
Secretary of State James A. Baker III and other U.S. officials in
the Cabinet Room before taking time out to inspect the mosaic.
   Bush then showed Shevardnadze the view of the White House grounds
before repairing to the Oval Office for another 45 minutes of talks.

   The Environmental Protection Agency said
Thursday it halted enforcement against a polluting Louisiana
waste-burning plant for more than two years because it didn't want
to damage a criminal investigation of the facility.
   The EPA action frustrated area parents whose children had a
higher-than-usual incidence of cancer, the House Government
Operations environment subcommittee was told.
   The enforcement halt also stymied state officials, who
aggressively sought civil penalties against the Marine Shale
Processors plant, near Morgan City, La. Louisiana officials found
air, water and hazardous waste violations at the plant.
   Edward E. Reich, acting assistant EPA administrator for
enforcement, said the agency declined to take action under an
agreement with the Justice Department, which believed that any civil
enforcement could lead to dismissal of criminal evidence and other
problems.
   Subcommittee Chairman Mike Synar, D-Okla., said there's something
``fundamentally wrong'' with a system that ``allows violations for
years to go unabated.''
   ``It's unfair to the community'' to say that a pending criminal
investigation means ``we cannot protect the safety of people,'' he
said.
   The criminal investigation ran from November 1986, when the EPA
and FBI searched the plant, to last July 24, when the company
pleaded guilty to three pollution violations _ one felony and two
misdemeanors _ and was fined $1 million.
   The violations involved hazardous waste storage, creating an
obstacle to navigation and allowing contaminated storm water to
enter a waterway.
   Reich said only an imminent health danger would have changed the
policy, and it didn't find one.
   But Rep. W. J. ``Billy'' Tauzin, D-La., who represents the
district where the plant is located, said there is a higher than
average rate of child cancer in the area and a state study has tried
to determine if the Marine Shale plant is responsible. He said there
is no conclusive evidence to implicate the facility.
   Marine Shale Processors is located along Bayou Boeuf, part of the
heavily traveled Gulf Intercoastal Waterway System. The facility
burns hazardous waste, producing a byproduct known as aggregate,
which is used as a substitute for gravel in road building.
   Robert C. Olde Jr., an attorney representing the company, said in
an interview ``There are no hazardous releases'' from the firm's
operation.
   He said the company was not responsible for child cancer in the
area, saying he suspected ``chemical companies that have been
dumping chemicals all around'' his region of Louisiana.
   ``We're not making hazardous waste. We're trying to clean up
hazardous waste,'' he said. ``We make a clean product.''
   State officials first discovered pollution violations beginning
in August 1985 but were asked by the EPA to place enforcement on
hold while the criminal investigation continued, according to
Elizabeth Megginson, assistant secretary of legal affairs for the
Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality. The state has has
proposed $5.5 million in penalties against the plant.
   Under prodding by Synar, Reich acknowledged that the agency only
did routine inspections during the criminal probe out of ``concern
that the criminal investigation not be interfered with...'' He
admitted the EPA lacked hard data on health hazards.
   ``I find that incredible. You've been telling people for three
years there's no imminent helath threat and you have nothing to back
that up,'' Synar said.
   Tauzin told the panel, ``I wish you could have seen the
frustration of the families'' who believe EPA ``let them down.'' He
said local residents from Morgan City were ``traumatized'' by the
lack of action because they couldn't get answers to ``why children
are dying of cancer.''

<HEAD>Rural Solidarity Leader Proposes New Political Party</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of the farmer's union Rural
Solidarity proposed Thursday the creation of a new political party,
an action that could splinter the Solidarity movement.
   Though nominally independent, the farmer's union has battled
alongside Solidarity for eight years and backs its new parliamentary
coalition. Its initiative to form its own party could augur the
breakup of Solidarity into more narrowly defined parties.
   However, Solidarity leader Lech Walesa said in Gdansk a variety
of parties in Poland was inevitable and that he was not disturbed.He
said the proposal ``should be treated naturally.''
   In his statement, Rural Soldarity Chairman Jozef Slisz said the
new party should be called Polish Peasants Party-Solidarity.
   ``It is only the Polish Peasants Party-Solidarity that can
abolish monopolies. I believe that (this party) will help build a
civil society,'' he said in the statement printed in the
pro-Solidarity Gazeta Wyborcza newspaper.
   The new party would rival the existing United Peasants Party,
which Rural Solidarity criticizes for its long alliance with the
Communist Party and its support of collectivation of private farms
in the 1950s.
   The United Peasants Party switched allegiance last month to
Solidarity, creating the parliamentary bloc that allowed Solidarity
activist Tadeusz Mazowiecki to take over as prime minister on Aug.
24. His government is the first East Bloc admiministration led by a
non-Communist since the Communists consolidated control of Eastern
Europe after World War II.
   Rural Solidarity members have been unhappy with their role in the
new government. The farmers' union received only one post of
minister without portfolio in the 24-member Cabinet, despite its
long alliance with Solidarity.
   Slisz's statement implied criticism of how the new government was
formed. He said the countryside viewed ``with astonishment'' recent
parliament reshuffles.
   ``In this situation, after due consideration, I came to the
conclusion that it is necessary to establish our own political
organization,'' he said.
   He said that the United Peasants Party was not equal to the
problems facing Poland.
   ``Agriculture needs immediate changes. However, it is to delude
oneself dangerously to believe that these changes can be effected by
the renovated United Peasants Party: a Stalinist product established
by the (Communist Party) to fight against private farming,'' said
Slisz.
   ``The people who earlier acted against the interests of the
countryside will not cure its ills now,'' he said.
   United Peasant Party chairman Dominik Ludwiczak issued a
statement read on state television Thursday night saying ``mutual
complaints and conflicts do not serve effective action.'' He added,
``One cannot blame currently active members of the party for
mistakes of 40 years ago.''
   He suggested instead that farm leaders of all stripes hold
meetings to work out their differences.
   Earlier Thursday, Slisz told leading Solidarity parliament
deputies and senators about the plans for the new party, the state
PAP news agency reported.
   In response to fears that the caucus would break up into
factions, Slisz promised that deputies or senators who join the new
party will continue to operate as members of the Solidarity caucus.

<HEAD>Investigators Examine Recordings From USAir Plane</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal investigators examined flight data and
cockpit voice recorders Thursday in an effort to find out why the
pilot aborted takeoff of his USAir Boeing 737. The plane slid into
New York's East River; killing two people.
   National Transportation Safety Board technicians displayed the
recorders for reporters. One machine was still dripping with water;
it had been removed from the crash site at LaGuardia Airport.
   The data recorder measures 70 functions in the airliner and its
engines and should quickly provide clues to any problems that might
have caused the pilot to put on the brakes and reverse engine thrust
before the plane crashed late Wednesday, said board spokesman Allan
Pollock.
   The data recorder in the nine-month-old aircraft is
state-of-the-art and provides much more information than earlier
models, Polock said.
   The voice recorder was connected to a microphone in the cockpit
and should have picked up the last 30 minutes of conversation among
pilots and anyone else in the cockpit.
   Technicians said both of the tapes and recorders appeared to be
in good condition.
   Content of the recorders is generally not made public before 60
days, but preliminary information that may give investigators some
idea of any problems that existed could be available right away,
Pollock said.
   An investigative team remained at the crash site and other board
personnel were attempting to interview passengers and members of the
crew in New York.
   According to safety board records, 737s used by U.S. carriers
have been involved in 56 accidents since 1969, when the airliners
were first produced. More than 1,700 of the planes have been built
with 800 of the newer models on order, said Boeing spokesman George
Weiss.
   A 737 model similar to the one that went off the runway in New
York crashed Jan. 8 in England, killing 44 people. Investigators
have reached no final conclusion on the British Midlands crash, but
they initially said that the pilot shut down his right engine after
his left engine malfunctioned, leaving the plane without power.
   The accident led to inspections for crossed-wires in warning
systems in several Boeing models.
   Four of the 737 crashes of U.S. carriers have involved fatalities.
   The worst was the Jan. 13, 1982, crash of an Air Florida 737 that
plowed into a bridge crossing the Potomac River into downtown
Washington. Seventy-eight people were killed in the accident, which
was blamed on the flight crew's failure to ensure that ice had been
removed from the wings.
   An April 28, 1988, the top ripped off of an Aloha Airlines 737 in
Maui, Hawaii, sparking concern over aging and overused airliners.
One flight attendant was killed.

   A Vatican statement calling for a convent
at the edge of Auschwitz to be moved has not changed the feelings of
local residents who want the nuns to stay.
   ``This is Poland and they (the Vatican) are very far away,'' said
an elderly man hoeing vegetables Thursday in the well-tended garden
on the convent grounds adjacent to the walls of the former German
death camp.
   ``The nuns need to be here, and nobody has the right to throw
Poles off Polish soil,'' said a woman who has worked more than 20
years in a bookstore inside the camp, under the cloister's shadow.
   All the Poles interviewed seemed wary and refused to give their
names.
   Most said they had not heard of the Vatican statement in Rome
Monday. It was not prominently reported in the Polish media.
   The 14 nuns of the Carmelite order, who in 1984 moved into the
abandoned theater used by Nazis as a storehouse during World War II,
are at the center of a controversy that is straining Catholic-Jewish
relations.
   Monday's Vatican statement appeared aimed at persuading the
Polish church to reverse its stand and honor a 1987 agreement
between church representatives and Jewish leaders to move the
convent.
   Led by Cardinal Jozef Glemp, the primate, the Roman Catholic
Church in Poland has yet to officially react to the Vatican's
position.
   Glemp met Wednesday in London with a British Jewish leader, and
according to the state PAP news agency, ``further prospects
surfaced'' for resolving the dispute.
   Solidarity Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki quietly asked fellow
Catholic journalist Stefan Wilkanowicz to help mediate the
controversy.
   Wilkanowicz, editor-in-chief of the monthly Znak in Krakow, said
on Thursday the decision to move the convent has been settled ``in
principle'' although many logistical and financial problems remain.
   ``For sure the church in Poland will make some moves now to solve
this problem,'' said Krzysztof Kozlowski, assistant editor of the
influential church-linked Tydgodnik Powszechny weekly in nearby
Krakow and a national legislator.
   But Kozlowski said in an interview in Warsaw on Thursday that the
feelings of Jews about the convent are ``not very easy'' for the
average Pole to understand.
   Jews and some Christians say the convent, and particularly its
large wooden cross, do not belong in a place where 2.5 million Jews
were killed during World War II.
   ``They (nuns) are trying to take away our memories and even our
cemeteries,'' said Zvi Samharet, an Israeli guide at the camp
Thursday who was accompanying a group of children from Israel.
   Jewish leaders in Europe, Israel and the United States renewed
appeals for the removal of the nuns this spring after the church
missed a Feb. 22 deadline, set in the 1987 agreement, to move the
convent to a prayer center away from the camp. The prayer center has
yet to be built.
   Meanwhile, relations between Polish Catholics and Jews have
deteriorated.
   Tension escalated in July when a small group of American Jews
climbed over the convent fence to try to talk to the nuns. Workers
in the convent poured water on the rabbi and his six students and
dragged them off the premises.
   The Carmelites now have hand-lettered signs in English saying
``No trespassing'' and ``Private property'' posted in the grass near
their gate. A St. Bernard patrols the perimeter of the convent.
   The nuns seem determined to stay.
   Throughout the afternoon Thursday, several nuns worked in the
vegetable garden, tending flower beds or sweeping the front porch of
the red brick building.
   ``We don't listen to the radio. We don't read newspapers. We
don't give out information. We only pray,'' said a nun who answered
the door at the convent. She then went back inside.
   There are signs of continuing renovations _ bricks and lumber on
the porch and a wheelbarrow and sand on the sidewalk.
   ``The sisters are not going to move until they have someplace to
go, and they don't have it yet,'' said a nun of another order
waiting at a bus stop near the convent entrance.
   ``If the cloister were inside the camp, then maybe somebody could
complain. But they are outside the camp and they are praying for
everybody whether they are Christians or Jews,'' said the bookseller.

<HEAD>Study: Day Care May Be Safer Than Home</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Day-care centers may be safer than home for
avoiding childhood injuries, a researcher said Thursday, suggesting
that injury rates could be lower still with a little more attention
to playground hazards.
   ``Parents have always had the bad news that kids in day-care are
at increased risk of infectious disease,'' said Dr. Jeffrey Sacks, a
medical epidemiologist at the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta.
   ``Here's some good news for a change: they are probably at less
risk of injury and death from injury than they are when they're not
at day-care,'' he said.
   Sacks and his colleagues studied 143 injuries among 5,300
children at 71 Atlanta day-care centers between June 1987 and May
1988. Centers reported any injury that required medical or dental
attention to the researchers, whose study is published in Friday's
Journal of the American Medical Association.
   The researchers said that 3.54 percent of children in day-care
could be expected to be injured at the center in a given year. They
extrapolated from their data that, if children were to stay at
day-care 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, 14 percent would incur an
injury.
   ``A typical injury rate for children in a community in one year
is about 35 percent,'' Sacks said. ``That suggests to us that
children in child care are probably safer than when they are in the
community at large.''
   An earlier Massachusetts study reported similar findings. The
Atlanta researchers did not specifically study children injured at
home, but cited previous research on their injury rates.
   Dr. George Stern, a New Orleans pediatrician, said although he
hadn't seen the new study ``there is a certain amount of logic to
it.''
   ``In a well-supervised day-care center the environment has been
looked at for hazards probably more than in the average home,'' said
Stern, who edited a day-care manual for the American Academy of
Pediatrics.
   ``And many children who are at home do not get the amount of
ongoing supervision as a child does in a day-care center,'' he said
in a telephone interview.
   In the Atlanta study, most injuries _ 58 percent _ were caused by
falls and 68.5 percent were head injuries, the researchers said.
Most injuries, 54 percent, occurred outside, with outside accidents
accounting for 76 percent of the most serious injuries, the study
said.
   The high number of playground injuries could be cut with a few
simple measures, including the installation of impact-absorbing
surfaces, such as wood chips or sand, Sacks suggested.
   Playgrounds should be examined regularly for possible hazards,
such as equipment that is not stable, he said.
   ``As I drive by playgrounds, I often see staff congregated
talking to each other while kids play,'' he said. ``When a kid is on
a playground, it's time for heightened supervision, not less.''

<TEXT>
   A man was convicted Thursday of snatching a
toddler from his mother and using the child to shield himself from
gunfire during a wild battle between gangs fighting over drugs.
   The 3-year-old child, put on the stand by prosecutors last week
to show the jury his wounds, is recovering from a bullet that
pierced his chest on Feb. 1.
   Eric Casseus, 19, was convicted of assault, reckless endangerment
and endangering the welfare of a child. He faces five to 15 years in
prison when he is sentenced Oct. 10.
   ``This defendant's crime _ grabbing a little boy from his mother
and using him as a shield against flying bullets _ was depraved,''
said District Attorney Elizabeth Holtzman. She said her office would
seek a stiff sentence.
   Casseus ``was controlled, but stunned'' by the verdict, defense
lawyer Elizabeth Sack Felber said. She said she would appeal the
verdict.
   Casseus maintains he was an innocent bystander mistakenly
identified by the child's mother, Modesta Alvarez.
   Ms. Alvarez was pushing one of her children in a baby carriage
and had her son, Gregory, walking at her side when the gunfire
erupted at a housing project in the East New York section of
Brooklyn.
   The mother took cover with the children between two parked cars.
But Casseus, one of eight youths involved in the gun fight, ran
toward them, grabbed Gregory and then held him up as a shield.
   He released Gregory only when a bullet went through the boy's
chest, penetrating his lungs and grazing his left arm as it exited.
Casseus was shot in the leg and identified by Ms. Alvarez at a
hospital where he and the boy were treated.

<TEXT>
   Weary residents and tourists who arrived here
Thursday from St. Croix said they armed themselves with makeshift
weapons and watched in horror as looters rampaged through the
hurricane-ravaged island.
   ``The worst stories that you hear, you can believe them,'' said
John Curans of Washington, D.C., who was honeymooning with his
bride, Patty, when Hurricane Hugo struck.
   Currans was among 77 people evacuated from the popular tourist
retreat by the Coast Guard aboard a C-130 transport plane that flew
into Miami airport.
   In Grand Rapids, Mich., two brothers chartered a plane and
rescued their parents after receiving a desperate call from them in
St. Croix.
   ``My father managed to get to a boat yesterday and radioed my
brother and _ he only was on for a minute _ he said, `Do whatever
you can to get us out of here,' '' said Kim Sorrelle. ``My parents
were in fear for their lives.''
   ``My father said it's total anarchy,'' Sorrelle said. ``The
island is completely destroyed.''
   She said her parents, Bruce and Mary Langlois, had seen a
National Guardsman use his gun to break the lock of a jewelry store
for looting, and that people were firing rifles from rooftops.
   Sorrelle's two brothers, Joel and Bruce Langlois, flew to Miami
late Wednesday, where they chartered a small plane into St. Croix on
Thursday afternoon. Because their plane had eight seats, the
brothers also were bringing four other people back to Miami,
Sorrelle said.
   A Pan American Airlines emergency flight carrying some 250
passengers from St. Croix arrived Thursday at about 5 p.m.
   Drew Simpson of Toronto, Canada, told of forming a ``dynamic
team'' with several dozen others who took refuge in a hotel outside
of Christiansted.
   He said they used machetes to sharpen flag poles into spears and
blocked roads to the hotels with trees and debris because of fears
of potential violence.
   ``Once it became dark, you really got spooked,'' he said,
describing hearing weapons fire. But he and others said they were
not threatened by looters.
   During the long days, Simpson said his group tossed around a
coconut-turned-football and taught cribbage to some Louisiana
construction workers. He said they found a cistern with fresh water
and ate thawing food from a hotel freezer.
   National Guardsmen and St. Croix police joined in the looting
spree, Simpson said.
   ``We didn't go out after dark,'' said Jim Clark of Westport,
Conn. ``Whatever the storm didn't break, the looters broke. ``It
looked like a war zone.''
   Clark, a concert promoter, said he watched as authorities shot a
looter in the leg after several warning shots.
   Art Morales, a California police officer, said the lawlessness
after the hurricane Sunday was ``unbelievable.''
   Like Simpson's group, he and guests at their small hotel armed
themselves with plastic batons and organized security watches.
   Morales and his wife, Timi, of Tustin, Calif., were also on their
honeymoon.
   ``There's nothing left over there,'' Mrs. Morales said.
   Mrs. Morales said they carried only one small flight bag off the
island. They left the rest of the belongings behind, donating some
of their clothing to those in need.
   Simpson said he was looking forward to relaxing after fearing for
his life for the past few days.
   ``I want to get a nice cold beer, sit down and take it easy,'' he
said. ``I haven't slept for four days. And then find a flight back
to sunny Toronto.''

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A visiting West German official
said Thursday that more than 500 East Germans are camped out at the
West German Embassy in Prague, seeking free passage to the West.
   Peter Glotz, head of a visiting West German parliamentary
delegation, said many were determined to stay until their demands
were met.
   ``Well over 500 refugees, including 170 children and two pregnant
women, are camping out on the embassy grounds,'' Glotz told a news
conference in Prague.
   ``There are very many young people ... and there are people who
quite strongly say they will not return to (East Germany),'' the
official said.
   The flood of East Germans emigrating to the West through Hungary
continued Thursday, with 465 crossing into neighboring Austria in
the previous 24 hours. Austrian border officials said nearly 18,000
East Germans have entered since Hungary opened its western border 11
days ago to the emigrants.
   From Austria, the East Germans are heading to West Germany, where
they are granted automatic citizenship. West German officials said
304 arrived overnight.
   Most have cited East Germany's hard-line Communist government as
their reason for leaving.
   In East Berlin, Deputy Culture Minister Klaus Hoepcke was quoted
in the youth newspaper Junge Welt as calling for an investigation
into the causes of the refugee wave and social changes needed to
stem it.
   About 250 would-be emigrants last week accepted an East German
offer of impunity and the chance to apply for legal emigration and
left the Prague embassy, reducing the number there to about 150.
   Over the past few days, however, hundreds more have scaled the
6-foot-high fence around the compound.
   Many were reported to have come to the embassy after having been
turned back at the Hungarian border by Czechoslovak authorities.
Hard-line Czechoslovakia has condemned Hungary for allowing the East
Germans to go West.
   ``Our delegation tried to urge a humanitarian solution'' in talks
with Czechoslovak officials and Foreign Minister Jaromir Johanes,
Glotz said. ``But at this point I cannot raise any hopes.''
   Many East Germans have told reporters in Hungary and West Germany
that Czechoslovak authorities were trying to prevent them from
traveling to Hungary. Reports have emerged of people illegally
crossing from Czechoslovakia to Hungary by crashing through road
barriers or swimming the Danube.
   Czechoslovak officials denied the charges.
   The Hungarian news agency MTI meanwhile said Thursday that East
German refugees who left for the West through Hungary will be able
to reclaim hundreds of cars they left behind.
   It said 200 cars abandoned by refugees were previously returned
to East Germany, but about 600 cars remain. MTI said they will be
sent to Austrian and West German motor clubs so refugees can recover
them.

<HEAD>Argentine Foreign Minister Says Will Meet With British Colleague</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The foreign minister said Thursday
he will meet with his British counterpart next week in New York to
discuss restoring diplomatic and commercial ties severed at the
outbreak of the 1982 Falkland Islands war.
   It would be the first meeting between Argentine and British
foreign ministers since the 74-day war in the South Atlantic, which
left dead nearly 1,000 people.
   Foreign Minister Domingo Cavallo said his meeting with Foreign
Secretary John Major of Britain will take place Wednesday at U.N.
headquarters in New York.
   Cavallo will fly to New York on Saturday with President Carlos
Menem, who is scheduled to address the U.N. General Assembly.
   Argentine and British diplomats are scheduled to meet Oct. 17-18
in Madrid to discuss renewing diplomatic and trade relations.
   Such a move would in effect set aside for now the dispute
stemming from their rival claims of sovereignty over the Falklands.
   The islands off Argentina have been ruled by Britain since 1833.
Argentina claims it inherited the territory, which it calls the
Malvinas, when it declared independence from Spain in 1810.
   Argentina invaded the islands, inhabited by about 1,800 people of
British descent, on April 2, 1982. Britain counterattacked and
defeated Argentina in a war that helped contribute to the downfall
of the military junta that ruled from 1976 until Raul Alfonsin was
elected president in 1983.
   Alfonsin, who by law could not run for re-election, was succeeded
in July by Menem, who defeated Alfonsin's candidate, Cordoba Gov.
Eduardo Angeloz, in the general election.

   A bus crowded with youngsters on their way to
school Thursday plunged more than 40 feet into a water-filled pit
after being struck by a delivery truck that ran a stop sign.
Nineteen students were killed and 64 other people were injured, five
critically.
   Dazed survivors scrambled out of the submerged bus and stood on
it, screaming for help. Passers-by dived in 12 feet of water to pull
out survivors and the dead trapped in the bus.
   Four boats, firefighters from six departments and about 10 divers
helped in the rescue, as notebooks and school papers floated in the
murky water.
   ``I thought I was going to die,'' Alex De Leon, 18, said as he
stood in front of Mission Hospital in muddy pants and hospital
slippers, with cuts on his face and bruised hands. ``It just filled
up with water real quick.
   ``I opened up a window, took out my sister, took out a couple of
friends and it was already full of water, and you could smell the
diesel,'' he said.
   ``They were just trapped. We had to break the glass of the
windows to get in,'' said Al Nye, a diver who pulled seven bodies
from the bus.
   The bus driver had picked up the last of his 80 students en route
to nearby Mission High School when the bus was hit by a soft-drink
truck about 7:40 a.m. at an intersection just east of Alton, just
north of the U.S.-Mexico border.
   Leon and other survivors said the truck driver ran a stop sign
and struck the bus, sending it careening off the road about 20 feet
and into the gravel pit. The truck remained alongside the road.
   Truck driver Ruben Perez said his brakes failed, said Sgt. Israel
Pacheco of the state Department of Public Safety. The truck passed a
state inspection last week, Coca-Cola officials said. No charges
have been filed against Perez.
   Roads were dry and the weather was clear at the time of the
accident.
   Authorities used a crane to pull the bus from the pit and dragged
the pit for victims. Rescuers later called off their search and said
no students were missing.
   All the dead were 12 to 18 years old, said Mike Cox, a public
safety spokesman in Austin. A temporary morgue was set up at a civic
building in Mission.
   Frantic parents rushed to the scene and swamped phone lines at
the school and police station. One woman was carried away in an
ambulance, hysterical after seeing the bodies of her two daughters
pulled from the water, The Monitor in McAllen reported.
   Another wept as she was told about the death of her child, the
newspaper said. ``How can she be dead? She had just gotten on the
bus five minutes before,'' the woman said.
   Students' families met with counselors and school officials at
the city's community center. ``It's very somber. The whole city's in
shock right now,'' said fire Capt. Rene Lopez.
   Students brought by ambulance to McAllen Medical Center were
``soaked from head to toe, muddy with no shoes,'' said Susie Ramon,
a student nurse.
   Mission school Superintendent Ralph Cantu canceled all
extracurricular activities for the weekend ``because we've had a
tragedy. How can you be cheering at a football game when something
like this has happened?''
   Cox said it was the worst school bus accident in Texas history.
The nation's worst such accident was in 1976, when 28 Yuba City,
Calif., high school students and a teacher were killed after their
bus plunged off a freeway ramp. In 1959, 27 people were killed when
a bus went into a creek in Prestonsburg, Ky.
   Sixty-four people were taken to hospitals; four students and bus
driver Gilberto Pena were in critical condition, according to
hospital officials.
   The bus, which had 81 people aboard, was designed to carry 83
people, said Herman Light, quality assurance director for the
manufacturer, Blue Bird Body Co. of Fort Valley, Ga.

   A French air force helicopter helping rescue efforts
in hurricane-battered Guadeloupe crashed into the sea, killing six
people and leaving three missing, officials said Thursday.
   The twin-engine Puma plunged into the Caribbean on Wednesday
night about a half-mile southeast of the outlying island of
Desirade, said officials in the capital, Point-a-Pitre.
   The helicopter was evacuating Bernard Berchel, who had suffered
head injuries when Hurricane Hugo hit on Sunday, officials said. The
other eight people aboard were Berchel's son, four medical workers,
and the helicopter's crew of three, the officials said.
   They said six bodies were recovered with three missing. Chances
were dim that searchers in helicopters and fishing boats would find
them alive, the officials said.
   The cause of the accident was unknown, but witnesses reported
hearing loud mechanical noises as the helicopter lifted off from
Desirade, about six miles east of Guadeloupe.
   The helicopter was part of ongoing rescue efforts involving about
3,000 French servicemen assisting civil authorities in coping with
the aftermath of Hugo.

<TEXT>
   New doubts were raised Thursday over prospects
for the Bush administration's strategy to reduce the $1.3 trillion
Third World debt burden as delegates from 152 nations began arriving
for talks on global economic issues.
   Questions about world pollution, political upheavals in communist
Eastern Europe and China and the roller coaster ride of the U.S.
dollar were all expected to be addressed during the annual meetings
of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
   But the U.S. debt plan, unveiled last March by Treasury Secretary
Nicholas Brady, was the major topic on the agenda because resources
of the IMF and World Bank are crucial to the success of the effort.
   The administration found itself facing new questions about the
Brady plan after three of the largest U.S. banks this week decided
to set aside more than $4 billion in reserves to cover losses
related to Third World loans.
   J.P. Morgan &amp; Co. said Thursday it was setting aside $2 billion
to cover loan losses. Earlier, Chase Manhattan Corp., the country's
third largest bank, had said it was setting aside $1.15 billion and
Manufacturers Hanover Corp. said it was boosting its loan loss
reserves by $950 million.
   The decisions will translate into big third-quarter losses for
all three banks.
   The increase in loan loss reserves, which are expected to be
followed by other banks, came after Brazil, the Third World's
largest debtor with $110 billion in loans outstanding, missed making
a $1.6 billion interest payment this week.
   Banking analysts cited the Brady debt plan as another factor
driving banks to boost loan reserves. Under the plan, banks are
encouraged to forgive a portion of their loans to debtor countries
in exchange for guarantees supplied by the IMF and the World Bank
that the remaining debt will be repaid.
   Thus, the Brady plan forces the banks to formally acknowledge
that they will receive less than full repayment on their loans.
Executives at both Chase and Manufacturers Hanover cited this as one
reason for boosting their loss reserves.
   Last week, final agreement on debt reduction terms was reached
with Mexico, the first country to qualify for assistance under the
Brady strategy.
   Some banking analysts said they feared that the actions by major
banks to boost loan loss reserves could be a signal that these
institutions would no longer lend new money to Third World countries.
   Paul Getman, an economist with the WEFA Group, said that so far
the only bank that is even considering making new loans to Mexico is
Citicorp.
   Robert Litan, an economist at the Brookings Institute, said the
question of new money on the part of commercial banks was a concern
and he said it pointed to the need for a commitment of much greater
government resources to make the Brady plan work.
   ``The Bush administration doesn't want taxpayer bailouts for the
banks and they seem to equate substantial IMF and World Bank
guarantees as the equivalent of a taxpayer bailout,'' he said. ``But
I think you are going to need those kinds of guarantees on both old
and new debt in order to move the program forward.''
   A Treasury Department official praised the decisions to boost
loan loss reserves as a ``further move to realism by these
commercial banks that we welcome'' and denied that the actions
represented a threat to continued lending to debtor nations.
   ``By strengthening their financial position, banks really have
more flexibility to participate in a broader range of options,
incluidng debt reduction or debt service reduction and new money,''
said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   While both the IMF and the World Bank are expected to spend
substantial time discussing the Brady debt strategy, analysts said
they expected little to be committed in the way of increased funding.
   IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus told reporters the Mexican
debt package offered encouragement to other debtor nations to push
forward with negotiations with their creditor banks.
   On the issue of assistance to Hungary and Poland, Camdessus told
reporters that IMF officials were holding discussions with officials
of both countries aimed at providing assistance to support economic
reforms in Eastern Europe.
   The problems of China were also expected to be taken up at the
meetings. World Bank President Barber Conable told reporters
Wednesday that he hoped to be able to resume lending to China soon.
Seven loans totaling nearly $800 million were suspended in June
following the confrontation between Chinese troops and student
protesters in Tiananmen Square.
   Before the opening of the formal sessions of the IMF and World
Bank, finance officials of the world's seven richest countries were
scheduled to hold talks all day Saturday to review global economic
issues.
   The closed-door meeting, hosted by Brady and Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan, will likely focus on efforts by the rich
nations to stabilize the value of the dollar, which has been rising
for most of this year, despite efforts by the United States and its
allies to drive it lower.
   The rising dollar threatens to derail the administration's effort
to lower the huge U.S. trade deficit. A stronger dollar makes U.S.
goods less competitive on overseas markets and invites higher
imports.

<HEAD>Woman on Life Support Dies When Electricity Disconnected</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HAMMOND, Ind. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman on life support died after a utility
company disconnected power to her home instead of the house next
door, a company spokesman said Thursday.
   Northern Indiana Public Service Co. President Gary Neale said an
employee was sent to disconnect a customer's service in this Chicago
suburb because the bill had not been paid. However, the employee
accidentally turned off the power to the sick woman's home.
   Service was disconnected about 10 a.m. Tuesday, and a relative
notified the power company about a half hour later that power had
been cut off and that life-support equipment was in use, Neale said.
   ``A customer service representative working with the relative
immediately initiated a call to dispatch an employee to the home to
restore service,'' Neale said. Service was restored by 11:10 a.m.
   The woman, described as in her late 50s or early 60s, was taken
to Saint Margaret Hospital and Health Centers in Hammond, where she
died about 3 p.m.
   ``We have expressed our sincere regrets and condolences to the
customer's family and offered any assistance we can provide,'' Neale
said. He said the electric company would pay for any medical or
funeral expenses.
   ``The accidental disconnection of service was a tragic mistake
and we take responsibility for it,'' Neale said.
   The woman's name and medical condition were withheld at the
family's request.
   The woman was not on the company's life support registry, which
lists customers who use life support and medical treatment machines
in their homes.
   People on the registry get priority service whenever there is a
power outage. Their meters are tagged and service is never shut off,
Neale said.
   ``Because we had no record of the customer's life support
equipment, the electric meter was not tagged. Had it been tagged, it
would not have been disconnected,'' Neale said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Defense Department's planned $4.8 billion
system for jamming enemy radar is ``seriously flawed'' and
production of the joint Navy and Air Force program should be put on
hold, a senator charged Thursday.
   ``I believe we have discovered a Pentagon embarrassment and a
potential waste of billions of dollars,'' said Sen. David Pryor,
D-Ark.
   The Airborne Self-Protection Jammer, under development since
1969, is used to deceive or jam enemy radar and will be used on Navy
and Air Force fighters, including the F-14, F-18, F-16 and AV-8B.
The Defense Department plans production of 2,369 jammers.
   To date, $577 million has been spent on research and development
of the system.
   Pryor, in a speech on the Senate floor, said unclassified Navy
documents quote testers as saying the system is ``marginally
operationally effective. In order to become potentially effective,
ASPJ effectiveness must be improved for all threats not meeting
reference criteria.''
   The senator complained that further testing on the system is not
planned until 1991 when more than 300 systems will have been
produced, or committed to production, at $2 million a copy.
   ``All arrows point to a multibillion dollar rip-off,'' Pryor said.
   In a letter to the U.S. Comptroller General Charles Bowsher,
Pryor asked that the General Accounting Office, the investigative
arm of Congress, review the testing, costs and possible alternatives
to the jammer system.
   The Defense Department declined comment on the charges until it
has seen Pryor's comments.

   Jesus rides into Jerusalem on a donkey instead of
an ass in a new English-language Bible that is careful not to upset
U.S. readers, the editor said Thursday.
   ``The old usage is a classic example of offense being caused in
the United States for obvious reasons,'' said Roger Coleman,
coordinating editor of ``The Revised English Bible.''
   In Britain, the word ass doesn't have as many meanings as it does
in American use.
   ``References to ass have been adjusted to the inoffensive and
unambiguous donkey,'' he said.
   The change is one of thousands in the 1,294-page revision of
``The New English Bible,'' which appeared in 1970 and which in
Britain has largely replaced the Authorized Version or King James
Bible of 1611 and its late 19th- century Revised Version.
   Coleman said American viewpoints reached the translators through
the New York offices of the Oxford and Cambridge university presses,
which are jointly printing the new Bible.
   ``They came largely from people who want to use the Bible
literally, with only the meanings they attribute to the words,
although a large number of Americans are used to the Authorized
Version where `ass' is used liberally,'' Coleman said.
   The publishers describe the new Bible as a linguistically updated
version, whose style relates less to the vocabulary of a
19th-century clergyman and more to the needs of a 20th-century
congregation.
   It substitutes ``you'' for ``thee'' and ``thou,'' ``did'' for
``didst'' and abandons the ``O'' in references to God such as ``O
Lord.''
   God is still referred to as ``he'' (but without a capital H) in
faithfulness to the original writings, Coleman said, but in other
references to gender the version grapples with sexism for the first
time in a British-produced Bible.
   ``English is not too well equipped to express gender,'' Coleman
told a news conference.
   ``We carefully looked at all cases where male-oriented language
was used _ `men' or `brethren' applied to people of both sexes _ and
we used an inclusive gender term or adjusted the translation to
sidestep the problem,'' he said.
   ``Brethren'' becomes ``friends'' in some places and ``a man''
sometimes is changed to ``a person.''
   Elsewhere, ``corn'' has been changed to ``grain'' in many cases
because it means wheat in some countries, maize in others and oats
in Scotland.
   William Duff McHardy, formerly Regius Professor of Hebrew at
Oxford University, the revision's director, was asked why the
phrase, ``Vanity of vanities ... all is vanity'' from the first
chapter of Ecclesiastes was changed to ``Futility, utter futility.''
   ``We discussed it for a long time,'' he said. ``Vanity did not
represent all that the original Hebrew ought to represent, but
futility was the best we could do. We still have slight misgivings.''
   Morna Hooker, professor of New Testament studies at Cambridge
University and the only woman among the revisers, said: ``If God was
referred to as `she,' it wouldn't be the Bible, which one must
remember is 19 centuries old. You must always stand at a slight
distance from it.''
   Scholars of all Britain's mainstream churches cooperated for the
first time in the revision, which took 15 years: Anglicans, Roman
Catholics, Presbyterians, Methodists, Baptists, Quakers, the
Salvation Army and the Bible societies.
   Literary advisers included the poet Philip Larkin before his
death in 1985 and novelist Mary Stewart.
   Lord Coggan, former archbishop of Canterbury and a scholar of
ancient Hebrew who presided over meetings of the project committee,
said they aimed to produce the ``first fully ecumenical Bible'' in
``straightforward language for reading in church that can be
immediately understood.''
   ``The Bible is one of the main tools of the Christian church but
tools get blunt and the edges need resharpening. Knowledge increases
as the years go by, language changes and style alters,'' he said.
   The new Bible, officially published Sept. 28 but already on sale,
will be used immediately in Protestant churches but still needs the
imprimatur _ license to publish _ of Catholic authorities before
their congregations can use it, Coleman said.
   The revisers met in the Jerusalem Chamber of 900-year-old
Westminster Abbey where the compilers of the first Revised Version
met from 1871 to 1881.
   The work is being printed in a first run of 300,000 copies for
the English-speaking world, including 200,000 for the United States,
said Geoffrey Cass, chief executive of Cambridge University Press.

<TEXT>
   Vice President Dan Quayle joined conservative party
leaders from around the world Thursday at a meeting expected to
focus on ways to help drives toward greater democracy in Eastern
Europe.
   Quayle came to Japan from a two-day trip to South Korea, where he
toured the Demilitarized Zone and denounced communist North Korea as
an ``astonishing dictatorial regime.''
   He shares the spotlight at the Tokyo meeting of the International
Democratic Union with Britain's Margaret Thatcher, who asked the
West to give stronger support to reforms initiated by Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev.
   British officials said Prime Minister Thatcher and Quayle had a
half-hour meeting and discussed East-West relations and Cambodia,
where Vietnamese troops began final withdrawal moves on Thursday.
   On Saturday, Quayle will visit U.S. military bases in Japan with
his wife, Marilyn. Next week, he holds talks with Prime Minister
Toshiki Kaifu and other Japanese leaders before traveling to the
Philippines and Malaysia.
   The International Democratic Union, founded in 1983, groups 26
right-of-center political parties, and holds leaders' meetings every
two years. Representatives from 17 nations are attending this
meeting, with Kaifu, head of Japan's long-governing, conservative
Liberal Democratic Party, acting as host.
   The three-day conference ends Saturday. Comments by IDU officials
and advance texts of speeches indicated a major theme would be moves
toward greater democracy in such East bloc countries as Poland and
Hungary.
   A senior U.S. administration official said that in Quayle's
keynote speech at a luncheon Friday, the vice president will urge
his fellow conservatives to help democratic forces in Central
America, as well as in Eastern Europe.
   ``In Central and Latin America, the crunch is really coming
now,'' said the official, briefing reporters on condition of
anonymity.
   Andrew Peacock, leader of Australia's opposition Liberal Party,
said in a speech prepared for delivery Friday that Eastern Europe
``is today at a watershed in its history (and) many states in the
Asia-Pacific region are also searching for a new strategy.''
   ``Who would have thought when we established the IDU in 1983 that
we would, six years on, be witnessing such changes. We must renew
ourselves in the battle of ideas and lead the agenda.''
   Peacock, who is to become IDU chairman, said the organization
should ``examine ways in which we can give practical assistance to
those sympathetic parties that are developing in Eastern Europe,
South America, Asia and the Pacific.''
   The outgoing chairman, Norwegian former Prime Minister Kaare
Willoch, told a news conference European conservatives have been
traveling in Eastern Europe to make contacts with pro-democracy
activists.
   ``I think this is very important, because through such contacts
it is possible to help those groups fighting and working for freedom
in Eastern Europe,'' he said.
   ``This is a very complicated issue, because we all want to help,
and we know that some sorts of help may be counterproductive. So
thorough study of what's going on and what can be done are very
useful.''
   Willoch said it was premature to think of having Eastern European
groups join the IDU, since forming non-communist political parties
was still difficult.
   Mrs. Thatcher flies to Moscow Friday to meet with Gorbachev. She
had lunch Thursday with Emperor Akihito.
   In comments to reporters, she praised Gorbachev as ``the most
bold and courageous leader the Soviet Union has had while it's been
under communism. What Mr. Gorbachev is attempting to do ... is in
the interests of liberty as a whole and in the interest of all other
nations who believe in the cause of democracy as well.
   ``We should do, therefore, everything we can to support this
great, historic movement.''
   Mrs. Thatcher noted a trend in favor of Western political and
economic views but cautioned against relaxing defenses. She
predicted a period of ``very great uncertainty'' in East-West
relations and cited unexpected developments in China as a strong
example.

   President Bush on Thursday presented medals for
bravery to a 12-year-old girl who rescued a Japanese tourist from
the ocean in Hawaii and an 18-year-old boy who subdued a gunman at
his California high school.
   Bush, in a White House ceremony, also presented a Young Americans
Medal for Bravery posthumously to a 17-year-old who died rescuing
victims of a Texas bus accident.
   Angela Marie Campanoli, a seventh grader from Lacey, Wash., and
Ruben Ortega, a former student at San Gabriel High School in
Alhambra, Calif., received the medals.
   Angela was vacationing with her family at Maui, Hawaii, in
October when she dove into the surf and helped pull out a Japanese
woman being swept away by a strong current.
   Ortega subdued a student armed with an assault rifle who was
holding 70 students hostage at his high school April 26, 1988.
   Bush praised them for ``facing death and challenging eternity.''
   The president also presented a posthumous award to John and Rosie
Bankston, parents of John Clinton Bankston.
   John drowned July 17, 1987, while helping rescue others when a
church bus and a van carrying 43 people from a children's camp were
swept into the Guadalupe River in Kerr County, Texas.
   ``We know that a parent's grief is a special hardship,'' Bush
told the couple. ``But we hope that your grief is tempered now by
pride _ a pride in your hero, your son, John.''
   Bush also presented Young American Service Awards to:
   _John Philip Donovan, 18, of River Vale, N.J., for a variety of
community activities, including leading a Boy Scout troop with
disabled members and for leadership in a student group campaigning
against drunken driving.
   _Freddy Torres, 19, of East Boston, Mass., for volunteer work in
helping keep young people away from drugs and for his work in AIDS
prevention programs.
   _Sean Fox, 20, of Ethel, Wash., for starting a food bank for the
needy.
   _Vicki Lynn Urich, 19, of Alvin, Texas, for leading efforts to
clean up beaches along the Texas coast.
   ``These services may not be as dramatic as pulling someone from
the surf or subduing a gunman, but Freddy, John, Sean and Vicki know
something very profound: that it is in the daily accumulation of
small acts of kindness that can be improved; and often, that lives
can be saved,'' Bush said.

   Flight attendants had to throw seat cushions to
passengers evacuated into New York's East River after a USAir
jetliner broke apart in an aborted takeoff because the plane was not
required to carry life vests, a spokeswoman for the flight
attendants union said Thursday.
   Cindy Yeast of the Association of Flight Attendants said the
aircraft's cabin crew was unable to open all exits as the floor
buckled and the plane broke apart.
   Seat cushions on commercial aircraft are designed to float, with
enough buoyancy to support a person. Some flight attendants have
been critical of rules that require inflatable life vests only on
flights that spend appreciable time over major bodies of water, Ms.
Yeast said.
   As it became apparent the Boeing 737-400 carrying 61 people would
not stop safely, the attendants began yelling ``brace'' commands to
get passengers to grab their ankles and put their heads down to
reduce injuries, she said.
   ``The floor of the plane buckled up and down like a roller
coaster,'' Ms. Yeast said, based on information the union received
from flight attendants and others.
   Some passengers were sent down an inflatable slide into the
water. Others scrambled onto the aircraft's wing. Passengers in the
water hung on to floating timbers and other debris untio rescued.
   Later, Ms. Yeast said, flight attendants and the plane's captain
tried to use the slide as a raft _ as slides are designed to be used
in a pinch _ to reach several passengers caught in the rear of the
cabin as the plane sections filled with water. But the slide
deflated, apparently punctured by debris, she said.
   The interior of the plane was dark and shifting in the current,
Ms. Yeast said, as at least one passenger yelled for help from
behind a place where the floor had buckled all the way up to the
ceiling. That passenger and others were rescued, but two other
passengers died in the accident.
   Ms. Yeast said the pilot and last flight attendants stayed in the
aircraft trying to free passengers and left only after rescue
workers arrived and ordered them to evacuate.
   ``When the flight attendants realized passengers were going into
the water, they ripped of seat bottom cushions and began throwing
them out the door,'' she said.
   People were in the water for as long as 30 minutes, she said, and
some started singing as they awaited rescue.
   Ms. Yeast identified the flight attendants on the flight as Wayne
Reed, Jolynn Galmish, Susan Harrelson and Kelly Donovan, all based
in Baltimore.

<HEAD>Eds: UPDATES throughout with detail from indictments, comments from
Ms. Terry, her lawyer; no pickup.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A grand jury has indicted a federal drug
agent, his wife and the owner of a construction company on charges
of conspiracy, tax evasion and laundering large amounts of cash,
officials said Thursday.
   The federal indictment named Drug Enforcement Administration
agent Dennis Harker; his wife, Mary Ann; and Susan K. Terry, who
owns SKT Construction in West Des Moines.
   Ms. Terry was one of five recipients of the ``women of enterprise
award'' sponsored by the U.S. Small Business Administration last
year, said William Kutmus, her lawyer. She's a business partner of
Roxanne Conlin, a former U.S. Attorney and Democratic gubernatorial
candidate.
   Kutmus said she is a widow with two young children whose husband
died in a construction accident. He called her ``a spokeswoman for
women in non-traditional positions.''
   ``I was shocked and outraged to learn that I was being
indicted,'' Ms. Terry said at a brief news conference.
   The 11-count indictment alleges that between 1986 and 1988 Harker
and his wife ``spent, invested and profited by cash transactions
exceeding $1 million.''
   Kutmus said he had advised Ms. Terry not to comment on the facts
of the case, but ``the charges themselves are ruinous to her and her
business.''
   Kutmus said he would enter an innocent plea at arraignments
scheduled for Oct. 2.
   ``She feels she is wholly innocent and that the charges are very
ridiculous,'' Kutmus said.
   Harker and Ms. Terry were charged with using a business they
established ``to launder substantial amounts of currency which
Harker had acquired and to funnel the cash through what would appear
to be legitimate business transactions and loans between the two
partners.''
   The indictment also says Harker loaned thousands of dollars in
cash to other drug agents and spent more than $30,000 in cash to buy
rare coins.
   There was no mention of drugs in the indictment, and U.S.
Attorney Joe Beck refused to elaborate on it.
   Harker, 42, is a supervisory agent for the DEA in Miami who
joined the agency in 1971, and previously was assigned to St. Louis
and Laredo, Texas, before coming to live in West Des Moines. He
could face 40 years in prison and $2 million in fines if convicted
on all the charges. The Harkers also could owe taxes and penalties.
   Mrs. Harker, 40, faces up to 20 years in prison and $1 million in
fines if convicted. Ms. Terry, 38, faces up to 30 years in jail and
fines of up to $1.5 million.
   The U.S. attorney's office said in a statement released Thursday
that the indictment was handed up Wednesday. It resulted from an
investigation that began in spring 1988 ``as a result of information
received by the FBI,'' the statement said.
   In the indictment, Harker was charged with one count of
conspiracy, three counts of tax evasion and four counts of using an
interstate facility to promote illegal activity _ presumably the
mailing of bundles of cash. His wife faces a conspiracy count and
three tax evasion charges.
   Ms. Terry faces three counts of arranging bank deposits to avoid
a federal law that requires banks to report cash deposits larger
than $10,000.
   The indictment details real estate transactions _ many in cash _
in Texas, Florida, California, Colorado and other locations.
Farmland, resort properties and homes were bought, the indictment
said.
   The Harkers filed returns for 1986 claiming taxable income of
$38,999, but it actually was more than $416,000, the indictment
charged. For 1987, the couple claimed just over $34,000 but it
really was nearly $680,000, the indictment charged.
   There was no mention of the source of the income in the
indictment or accompanying statement.

<HEAD>Hersh Testifies at Own Libel Trial: I Tried to `Follow the Truth'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SHERI T. PRASSO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Journalist Seymour Hersh testified Thursday he was
trying to ``follow the truth'' when he wrote a book being challenged
by a former Indian prime minister in a $100-million libel suit.
   Morarji Desai, prime minister from 1977-79, claims Hersh defamed
him by saying he was a paid CIA informant and a valuable ``asset''
to the U.S. government during the administrations of Lyndon Johnson
and Richard Nixon.
   Hersh, called to the stand by lawyers for Desai, testified he had
made several errors in the first printing of ``The Price of Power,''
a book he wrote in 1983 about former U.S. Secretary of State Henry
Kissinger.
   The mistakes _ that Desai did not remain a cabinet member after
he resigned in 1969 but was a member of Parliament, the spelling of
Desai's first name, and the year Indira Gandhi returned to power _
were corrected in a second edition published a few months later. The
mistakes are not at issue in the libel case.
   ``I made a mistake,'' Hersh testified. ``The Indian ambassador
called me up, told me I had a mistake there.''
   When questioned by the plaintiff's attorney Francis Baumgart
about his accuracy in reporting and writing, Hersh said he was
attempting to be truthful.
   ``The notion is truth. I follow the truth, is what I'm trying to
do,'' he said.
   Hersh testified that six sources told him Desai worked as an
informant for the CIA, but acknowledged that he said in two 1983
interviews there were only two. He testified that one source among
the six told him Desai was paid $20,000 to be an informant.
   ``Did it occur to you this source may not be accurate,''
questioned plaintiff's attorney John O'Meara.
   ``Yes, it would to anybody,'' Hersh answered.
   But subsequent research ``butressed my view about certain
important facts ... and increased my confidence which, in fact, was
already high,'' Hersh testified.
   Under questioning, Hersh declined to reveal the name of another
source who was a foreign service officer in Washington, D.C., for
the Indian government. He said he submitted part of his manuscript
prior to publication to the source for verification of its accuracy.
   Earlier, plaintiff's attorney Cyriac Kappil told the court
Kissinger had been subpoenaed to testify, but his whereabouts were
not known.
   ``We'll make every effort to bring him in,'' Kappil said. ``On a
personal level, we prefer not to inconvenience Mr. Kissinger because
of his schedule.''
   Kappil said he would give Kissinger the opportunity to come in
voluntarily before asking the judge to enforce the subpoena. He also
said he was considering using a videotaped deposition made by
Kissinger if he was unsuccessful in procuring the former secretary
of state.
   Under U.S. libel law, Desai's attorneys must convince the
six-member jury that Hersh knowingly printed false, negligent or
malicious material.
   Hersh won the Pulitzer Prize for international reporting in 1970
for his articles exposing the My Lai massacre in Vietnam when he was
a reporter for the Dispatch News Service. He was also a reporter for
The Associated Press and for The New York Times. He left the
newspaper to pursue his own writing projects.
   He is working on a book on the Middle East.

<HEAD>FBI Won't Appeal Court Order in Discrimination Case</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS 14th graf, bgng: The suit xxx to CLARIFY that Perez was
FBI's second-highest ranking Hispanic agent.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The FBI said Thursday it will not appeal a
sweeping court order that sets in place mechanisms to end what a
judge found was systematic discrimination against Hispanic agents.
   The decision against appealing the May 5 decision by a federal
judge in Texas was made by Solicitor General Kenneth Starr, the
bureau said. The FBI made the announcement after receiving word of
Starr's decision.
   FBI Director William S. Sessions said in a statement that after
weighing ``the myriad legal, operational and institutional
considerations,'' he recommended to the Justice Department that no
appeal be pursued in the case.
   Sessions said the decision not to pursue the appeal is in the
best interests of FBI employees. ``We must move beyond the frictions
caused by this case to address the many vital challenges facing the
FBI in the 1990s.''
   The court order in the class-action suit by 311 of the bureau's
approximately 400 Hispanic agents directed the FBI to adopt changes
to end the ``unsystematic, excessively subjective'' method of
promoting special agents.
   In his order, U.S. District Judge Lucius Bunton III of Midland,
Texas, stripped the special agents in charge of FBI field offices of
the power to override decisions of career promotion boards.
   That system, the judge said, was ``anathema to nearly every
reform advanced by the bureau and ordered by this court to improve
the fairness and reviewability'' of promotion decisions.
   Bunton also appointed an outside panel of three attorneys to
conduct a case-by-case review to determine if as many as 200
Hispanic agents should be promoted to compensate for past
discrimination.
   Under the terms of the order, the FBI can appeal the panel's
findings to the judge.
   Bunton's order came as a result of more than two years of
litigation in the class-action case, in which he had earlier found
discrimination against Hispanics in promotions and working
conditions.
   The judge had found that Hispanic agents were often relegated to
undesirable assignments, such as monitoring the wiretaps of
Spanish-speaking suspects in a criminal investigation.
   Since taking office in November 1987, Sessions conducted a review
of the FBI's personnel and recruitment practices. He reorganized the
bureau's equal employment opportunity office, going outside the FBI
to recruit a manager of that unit who now reports directly to him.
   In his order, Bunton acknowledged that the changes ordered by
Sessions ``demonstrate energetic and good-faith effort to correct
the disparities found by this court.''
   The suit was filed in early 1987 by Bernardo ``Mat'' Perez, the
FBI's No. 2 agent in El Paso, the bureau's second-highest ranking
Hispanic agent after he had suffered a series of demotions.
   The judge ordered Perez promoted to a job with responsibilities
``commensurate with his experience and training'' but denied any
monetary damages or back pay to him or the other plaintiffs who
eventually joined the lawsuit.
   As a result of the court order, Perez was promoted to deputy
assistant director of the FBI's laboratory division in Washington,
the FBI said.
   The FBI's decision not to appeal was praised by Rep. Don Edwards,
D-Calif., chairman of the House Judiciary subcommittee on civil
rights.
   ``That's exactly the right decision, something we've been urging
for many months,'' Edwards said.
   ``It's time for them to move on and get at the root causes of the
problems associated with Perez and Rochon,'' the congressman said,
referring to a racial harassment suit by a black FBI agent, Donald
Rochon.
   Edwards called the Rochon case ``a thorn in their side day after
day.''
   Rochon accuses the FBI of tolerating racial harassment by white
agents of him and his family while he was assigned to the Chicago
field office.
   The lawsuit also accuses FBI supervisors of retaliating against
him for complaining of racial harassment.
   David Kairys, Rochon's lawyer, contended in a telephone interview
this week that the Justice Department has filed a series of
``frivolous motions'' that he said were ``calculated to immobilize
the court'' overseeing the case.

<HEAD>Swiss Former Justice Minister Charged With Passing Secrets</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BERN, Switzerland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Justice Minister Elisabeth Kopp
was indicted on criminal charges of leaking official secrets to her
lawyer-husband during an inquiry into drug money laundering,
prosecutors announced Thursday.
   Special federal prosecutor Joseph-Daniel Piller said enough
evidence was uncovered in a preliminary investigation to bring
charges against Mrs. Kopp before Switzerland's supreme court, the
Federal Tribunal.
   Mrs. Kopp, indicted Wednesday, resigned in January amid reports
she gave her husband inside information. She is the only woman to
have served as a Swiss government minister.
   Two former subordinates were also charged with passing
confidential goverment information.
   Piller said in a statement an inquiry was dropped into whether
Mrs. Kopp's actions provided illegal benefits to her husband.
   Her troubles stem from a secret telephone call last October to
her husband, Hans W. Kopp, urging him to cut ties with a
Zurich-based company, Lebanese-controlled Shakarchi Trading AG.
   The company had come under scrutiny in Switzerland's biggest-ever
inquiry into the laundering of drug money.
   Kopp gave up his post as Shakarchi board vice president shortly
before prosecutors linked the company to the scandal, which came to
be called the ``Lebanon Connection.''
   The supreme court, responsible for handling cases involving
government ministers, now must rule whether to accept as
well-founded the charges against Mrs. Kopp.
   Mrs. Kopp indicated Thursday in a statement issued through her
spokesman that she will contest the charges.
   She has denied criminal wrongdoing while acknowledging she made a
``mistake.''
   She could face a prison term or fine if tried and convicted.
   No charges have been filed against Shakarchi, which has denied
involvement.

<TEXT>
   Boxer Tony Wilson won his fight in
three rounds Thursday night after his mother climbed into the ring
and hit his opponent over the head with her stiletto shoe.
   Opponent Steve McCarthy left the ring with blood seeping from a
head wound as security officers ushered Mrs. Minna Wilson away.
   When McCarthy refused to return, referee Adrian Morgan raised
Wilson's arms in victory, declaring McCarthy had retired.
   Uproar broke out among the 1,000 spectators at The Guildhall in
this south English port, where the British light heavyweight title
eliminator fight between local boy McCarthy and Wilson was being
staged.
   The furious crowd kicked and punched Wilson before he escaped to
a dressing room, sheltered by his trainer and manager Jimmy Tibbs.
   ``The first thing I saw was my mum in the ring, and then
everything went wild,'' said Wilson, from Wolverhampton, central
England.
   ``She has been watching my fights for years and nothing like this
has happened before.''
   Police reinforcements were sent, but no one was arrested and no
one was reported injured.
   The British domestic news agency Press Association quoted an
unidentified senior police officer as saying: ``We sent a large
number of police officers when the problems first arose, but
thankfully the people there calmed down.''
   Wilson later said the uproar was worse than the Hagler-Minter
fight at in London in September 1980, when American Marvin Hagler
was bombarded with bar glasses after taking the World Middleweight
title from Britain's Alan Minter in one of the worst scenes in
British sporting history.

<HEAD>Soviets Report 292 Dead in 20 Months of Ethnic Violence</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK J. PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union's top policeman, Interior Minister
Vadim V. Bakatin, said 292 people were killed, 5,250 were wounded
and 360,000 had to flee their homes in ethnic violence since January
1988, Tass reported Thursday.
   Bakatin reported on the magnitude of the problem on Wednesday,
final day of a two-day meeting of the Communist Party Central
Committee devoted to trying to resolve the country's ethnic turmoil.
   He said thousands of homes were robbed or burned down in the past
20 months.
   It has been months since Soviet officials issued any nationwide
statistics on ethnic violence. Unofficial counts had put the number
of dead at slightly more than 200 and the number of refugees at
about 200,000. Bakatin did not break down the statistics by ethnic
groups.
   The Central Committee passed a policy statement calling for the
15 Soviet republics to take on more economic and political autonomy,
including ownership of all natural resources, but drew a line at
calls for independence.
   At the end of the long-delayed session, the Central Committee
accepted the retirement of Ukrainian party chief Vladimir V.
Shcherbitsky, former KGB chief Viktor M. Chebrikov and Viktor P.
Nikonov from the ruling Politburo.
   In a major power play, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev also
succeeded in promoting his new KGB chief, Vladimir A. Kryuchkov, and
economic planning chief Yuri D. Maslyukov.
   Ethnic activists interviewed by telephone on Thursday cheered the
three retirements, but said the development may not change official
attitudes toward their demands for sovereignty.
   ``Everybody thinks it was a good riddance,'' journalist Tarmu
Tammerk of the newspaper Kodumaa said of the reaction in the small
Baltic republic of Estonia.
   Shcherbitsky, 71, the last holdover from the 1964-82 era of
President Leonid I. Brezhnev, was regarded as one of the Politburo's
most conservative members. He kept a tight rein on the Ukraine for
17 years.
   He did not immediately resign as Ukrainian party chief, but that
is likely when a Central Committee meeting can be held in his
republic.
   Ukrainian activists said they did not know who might replace him,
and doubted whether his successor would pursue more moderate
policies.
   ``All the members of the Ukrainian Politburo are more or less
like Shcherbitsky, even the younger ones'' said Bogdan Gorin, a
leader of the Ukrainian Helsinki group, formed to monitor human
rights in the Soviet Union's second-largest republic.
   Gorin said in a telephone call from Lvov he was disappointed in
Gorbachev's speech setting out his ethnic policy. The speech smacked
of ``old stereotypes'' that regard the country as being under a
unified government rather than a federation of equal governments, he
said.
   ``He started for the first time to threaten those political
figures and organizations who are raising the issue of
independence,'' Gorin said.
   Gorbachev said Moscow would not tolerate anarchy in the Soviet
republics, or separatist ``demagogues.''
   Tonis Avikson, a spokesman for the Estonian People's Front, said
his political movement found little new and nothing to worry about
in Gorbachev's speech. For Estonians, the retirement of conservative
Politburo members was more important, he said.
   He said the activists particularly were pleased by Chebrikov's
retirement. Some people accused Chebrikov of knowing beforehand of
an attack by soldiers on a nationalist protest in the Georgia
republic. Twenty protesters were killed.
   Avikson noted that Maslyukov, who was promoted in the shake-up,
does not share the Baltic republics' enthusiasm for economic
self-management. He takes a particularly hard line on the idea of
transferring control of state-run enterprises from Moscow to the
republics, Avikson said.
   ``Maslyukov is not a big radical,'' he said. ``We have our
differences with him, but I think it's possible to talk to him.''

<HEAD>Communist Leader Released from Jail, Accuses Government of Kidnap</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL NORTON</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ The second-in-command of the Haitian
Communist Party was released Thursday after six days in jail and
accused the military government of trying to kidnap him.
   ``I escaped by the skin of my teeth. ... The three police who
broke into my courtyard wanted to kidnap me. They roughed up the
guard, but he didn't have a key, so they couldn't get into my house
without making noise,'' Max Bourjolly said after he and his guard
were released from the National Penitentiary.
   Bourjolly was arrested last Friday, several hours after his
security guard Jean Wilfried Herard had been taken into custody for
illegal possession of an Uzi submachine gun.
   ``The kidnapping failed, so they arrested me instead. If the
kidnapping had succeeded, I might have been killed,'' he said.
   Bourjolly admitted his guard did not have a permit for the
weapon, but said he had been ``targeted by the government because of
my opposition to its economic policy.''
   On Aug. 29, the government of Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril decreed a
series of tax measures that drew protests from politicians and labor
leaders. They claimed tariffs and tax hikes for small shopkeepers,
allegedly imposed by the IMF, would provoke social upheaval.
   Haiti, one of the poorest countries in the Western Hemisphere,
recently negotiated a $26.5 million standby loan with the IMF. It
owes the IMF $41 million.
   On Monday, bus horns honked and people beat on pots and pans in a
15-minute symbolic protest called by 18 organizations.
   The six political parties _ including the Haitian Communist Party
and the centrist parties of Louis Dejoie Jr. and Hubert De Ronceray
_ four labor unions and eight other groups threatened to call for a
general strike if the government did not rescind the measures.
   On Thursday, the Haitian Chamber of Commerce said the measures
``might lead to a social explosion.''
   In a news conference last month, Bourjolly was the first to
denounce government negotiations with the IMF.
   Bourjolly, 48, said he was well-treated during his week in jail,
although he claimed Herard was beaten.
   Bourjolly was arrested twice during the Duvalier regime, and was
jailed in the dreaded Fort Dimanche prison. He was released and
expelled from Haiti in 1977, in a general amnesty of political
prisoners, after 13 months in jail.

   U.S. mainland forces
carrying shotguns patrolled St. Croix on Thursday to stop looting
that has frightened islanders and tourists in the aftermath of
Hurricane Hugo.
   In Washington, a top Pentagon official said the American forces
found ``chaos and near anarchy'' upon arrival in this popular U.S.
resort, but the White House later said the situation was improving.
   The Marine Radio Band, monitored on nearby St. Thomas, said two
looters had been shot in St. Croix, the largest and most populous
island of the chain. However, there was no word of their condition
or independent confirmation.
   The latest forces arriving from the mainland joined 100 U.S.
marshals and FBI agents that the U.S. attorney general ordered to
the island.
   On Thursday, dozens of marshals with shotguns were posted in
front of the downtown federal building, while others patrolled the
streets on foot.
   One woman checking her destroyed yacht screamed insults at
marshals when they aimed weapons at her, apparently mistaking her
for a looter.
   ``Go after the bloody criminals, not the honest citizens!'' she
shouted.
   Territorial Sen. Holland Redfield said that in many cases,
supermarkets gave people permission to take the food because it was
spoiling. He said only a few looters were hardcore criminals.
   People were reported carrying guns after widespread looting
convulsed the island, which still lacks water, power and telephone
service in the wake of Hugo's wrath.
   There were new reports Thursday that looting was rampant too on
neighboring St. Thomas, the second most populous of the U.S. Virgin
Islands and also a popular tourist site for Americans.
   Hugo damaged virtually every building on St. Croix, an island of
53,000 about 70 miles east of Puerto Rico. Authorities reported one
drowning, and hundreds were reported injured and thousands homeless.
   Chief Warrant Officer Layton Timmons of the Virgin Islands
National Guard, who was at the airport watching mainland forces
disembark, said there were only 900 guardsmen in the U.S. Virgin
Islands.
   He acknowledged that the Coast Guard had videotaped some
guardsmen who had taken part in looting.
   ``When two people start looting, the whole Guard gets the wrap,''
Thomas said. ``Don't condemn the organization. I don't loot.''
   By late Thursday, it appeared most unprotected stores had been
sacked and there appeared to be little left to loot.
   The Coast Guard on Wednesday began evacuating to Puerto Rico all
people who feared for their safety. A C-146 transport plane with 70
aboard, mostly tourists, arrived late Wednesday at old Ramey Air
Force Base in Agua Dilla, about 75 miles west of San Juan.
   Coast Guard officials expected to bring up to 200 more people
from St. Croix on Thursday.
   John Curren, a writer from Washington, D.C., said after stepping
off the plane that mobs had ``established the law of the revolver''
by shooting and breaking into stores.
   On St. Croix, Lt. Col. Ned Longsworth, spokesman for the 18th
Airborne Corps from Fort Bragg, N.C., said his unit's mission is to
assist local civilian authorities in restoring order and protecting
public and private property.
   ``We will stay until the mission is accomplished,'' he said.
   In Miami, weary residents and tourists who arrived Thursday from
St. Croix said they armed themselves with makeshift weapons and
watched in horror as looters rampaged through the island.
   Drew Simpson of Toronto told of forming a ``dynamic team'' with
several dozen others who took refuge in a hotel outside of
Christiansted.
   He said they used machetes to sharpen flag poles into spears and
blocked roads to the hotels with trees and debris because of fears
of potential violence.
   ``Once it became dark, you really got spooked,'' he said,
describing hearing weapons fire. But he and others said they were
not attacked by looters.
   The first contingent of U.S. military personnel landed at 7:40
a.m. EDT on the island and moved quickly to establish a mobile
control tower and prepare the airfield for the arrival of 1,105
military police, said Lt. Cmdr. Ned Lundquist, a Pentagon spokesman.
   By late afternoon Thursday, five aircraft carrying a total of 230
people and 105 tons of cargo had arrived on St. Croix. Three more
aircraft were en route with 120 people and 40 additional tons of
cargo, Pentagon officials said.
   Longsworth said the rest of the soldiers were to arrive later
Thursday and Friday. He said most of the units consist of military
police.
   ``Martial law has not been declared. We are just here to assist
local authorities. We are authorized to make arrests only in the
total absence of local authorities,'' Longsworth said.
   By late Thursday, the helmeted, heavily armed soldiers, equipped
with flak jackets and backpacks, were still at the airport with only
the federal marshals deployed downtown.
   Harry Brandon, head of the FBI in San Juan, said the FBI agents
and federal marshals will ``help local authorities get back on their
feet.'' He said the FBI's first priority was to stop the looting.
   ``The looting is still going on,'' Brandon said. ``I think that
by the end of the day, things will begin to return to normal.''
   In Washington, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said,
``The troops are having an obvious impact in controlling the looting
and other lawlessness associated with the destruction. It is
impossible to say at this point how long they will have to be
there.''
   He said, ``The local officials of course are still in charge of
law enforcement there.''
   Another military spokesman, Fred Hoffman, said the troops had
encountered problems landing on St. Croix because the small airfield
was crowded and there were no night lights. Planes overturned by the
storm littered the airport.
   Two guided missile carriers, the Stephen Groves and the Clifton
Sprague, have been moved into the area as a precaution, Hoffman said.
   The troops, the first active duty military personnel sent onto
the nation's streets in 20 years, were ordered by President Bush
Wednesday night.
   Adm. William J. Crowe, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
said earlier Thursday the troops had been issued rifles and told to
shoot if necessary to defend themselves.
   All told, the troops would include 635 military police from Fort
Bragg, N.C., and 470 military police from companies in Fort Polk,
La.; Fort Hood, Texas, and Fort Leonard Wood, Mo.
   Generally, the National Guard is summoned to restore order in
civil disturbances. But presidents are allowed to use federal troops
by declaring an emergency.
   The last time federal troops were used to suppress riots was in
1968 in Washington, D.C., and other cities after the assassination
of Martin Luther King Jr., administration officials said. President
Reagan authorized the use of troops in 1987 to handle prison riots
in Atlanta, but they were never deployed.

   Jose Napoleon Duarte on Thursday
bid farewell from his deathbed to his successor, President Alfredo
Cristiani, Duarte's doctor said.
   Jose Luis Saca, the former president's personal physician, said
Cristiani arrived early Thursday to see Duarte, who is dying of
liver cancer.
   Duarte's cancer was diagnosed in June 1988. His condition has
deteriorated rapidly the past two days, and his doctor says the end
is near.
   ``It seemed like the visit raised his spirits a bit,'' said Saca.
Even so, he said the 63-year-old Duarte ``is in a terminal state.''
   Cristiani arrived before journalists had taken up watch at
Duarte's home in the fashionable San Benito neighborhood, so what
the two men said to each other was not available.
   Saca said the cancer now ``has invaded the lungs.''
   The doctor said Duarte was asking for friends and colleagues to
be sent to his room for brief farewells.
   ``He is completely aware that he is dying,'' said Saca.
   Duarte's youngest child, Lorena, said her father was in a coma
for a time Thursday, but woke up, got out of bed, sat down in a
wheelchair and in ``a moment of lucidity'' asked that a favorite
grandson be brought to see him.
   Moments earlier, Raquel Cerezo, wife of Guatemalan President
Vinicio Cerezo, told reporters Duarte sat up and spoke with her _
``He was lucid. Even joking.''
   Duarte's daughter, Ines, told reporters earlier Thursday, ``His
condition is very serious. He could die today or tomorrow.''
   The former president's wife, Ines, all six of his children and
most of their spouses were at the house.
   Monsignor Fredy Delgado, Duarte's confessor, said Duarte received
last rites early Thursday. He said Duarte has taken communion every
day since his cancer was diagnosed last year.
   Saca said Duarte has given up the battle and was refusing
medication that could prolong his life.
   ``We're trying to make his death painless,'' Saca told reporters.
   Duarte's condition has been critical since Tuesday, when his
health badly deteriorated while he was attending a meeting of
regional Christian Democrats in Guatemala.
   Duarte was president for five years and was Washington's
staunchest ally in the Western Hemisphere. He handed over power to
Cristiani, of the rightist Republican Nationalist Alliance, on June
1.
   Duarte underwent treatment last year at Washington's Walter Reed
Army Medical Center. Two-thirds of his cancerous stomach was removed
and chemotherapy was used to slow the disease's advance in his
kidneys.
   He had been receiving chemotherapy periodically until last month,
when he was judged too weak to endure more.

   Most whites would not mind having a black
dinner guest, boss, doctor or neighbor, but well over half say they
don't want their sisters dating one, according to poll results
released Thursday.
   The poll conducted for USA Today said that 30 percent of whites
believe members of their race are prejudiced against blacks. An
earlier poll of blacks by the newspaper found that 26 percent of
blacks believe whites are prejudiced.
   The poll of whites, conducted Sept. 13-14, found that 75 percent
said they have had black guests in their home, 86 percent would have
no objection to having a black next-door neighbor, 86 percent would
not mind having a black doctor, and 89 percent had no problem with
the idea of a black boss.
   But 60 percent said they would not approve of their sisters
dating black men, and 69 percent objected to the idea giving jobs to
blacks to make up for past discrimination if it meant that equally
qualified white people were to be passed over.
   The poll, which contacted 806 white adults nationwide selected at
random, has a sampling error of plus of minus 3.5 percent. It was
conducted by the Gordon S. Black Corp.
   A poll of blacks was conducted for the newspaper in August.
   Results and analysis will appear in USA Today Friday editions,
the newspaper said.

<HEAD>Hurricane Hugo Bears Down on Southeast</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Hurricane Hugo, packing 135 mph winds, headed for the mainland
United States on Thursday, bringing showers to much of the Southeast
and prompting a hurricane warning from Florida to North Carolina.
   Elsewhere around the nation, showers and thunderstorms were
widely scattered from the central Gulf Coast states through the
lower Ohio Valley to the middle Atlantic Coast states and southern
New England.
   A hurricane warning was in effect from Fernandina Beach, Fla., to
the Oregon inlet of North Carolina, including Pamlico Sound, with a
tropical storm warning and hurricane watch in effect from the oregon
inlet to Cape Henlopen, N.C., including the Albermarle Sound and
Chesapeake Bay.
   High wind warnings were in effect through Friday for the north
and south Midlands of South Carolina and south central sections of
Virginia.
   Storm surge flooding 12 to 17 feet above normal tide levels was
expected near and to the north of where the center of the hurricane
crosses the coast.
   A few tornadoes were likely in parts of South Carolina and North
Carolina, with rainfall amounts of 5 to 10 inches expected in the
path of the hurricane.
   Flash flood watches issued for South Carolina, North Carolina and
southeastern Georgia. Flash flood watches were posted for Friday for
Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, the eastern Panhandle of West
Virginia, and the District of Columbia.
   A coastal flood watch issued for Friday in much of the middle
Atlantic Coast. An urban and small stream flood watch was posted
through Friday evening for the lower Susquehanna Valley of
Pennsylvania.
   Showers and thunderstorms associated with Hugo were in South
Carolina, eastern Georgia and coastal North Carolina.
   Heavier rainfall totals for the six hours ending at 8 p.m. EDT
included 1{ inches at Savannah, Ga. 1 1-3 inches at Fort Stewart,
Ga., and nine-tenths of an inch at Beaufort, S.C.
   Showers and a few thunderstorms extended across eastern Nebraska
and central Kansas, as well as the lower Rio Grande Valley of Texas.
   Cloudy skies and a few showers prevailed over the north central
United States, with fair skies predominant across the western third
of the country.
   Unseasonably warm weather prevailed across Florida, with high
temperatures in the lower 90s at many locations. Miami Beach's
93-degree high was a record for the date.
   Afternoon highs were mostly in the 80s across southeastern and
south central sections of the country, with readings in the 90s
reported in southern Texas and in the 80s and 90s in the
southwestern deserts.
   Clouds and rain helped keep temperatures unseasonably cool in the
north central United States, with afternoon readings only in the 50s
from northern Minnesota to the central High Plains.
   An arctic cold front with strong northwest winds is expected to
bring much colder weather to the north central states in time for
the official start of autumn Friday evening, with freezing
temperatures expected by Saturday morning.

   Doctors said prospects for Mother Teresa's
recovery looked better on Thursday following her heart attack this
month.
   They said she spent a comfortable day without chest pains or
fever.
   ``The overall picture is a shade brighter,'' said a statement
from Woodlands Nursing Home, where the 79-year-old charity worker
and Nobel laureate was being treated.
   One physician, Dr. A.K. Bardhan, noted, however: ``We cannot be
certain about her health condition at this moment. She is still not
out of danger; she is mentally very strong, but not physically.''
   Bardhan said although her general condition was improving, the
frail Roman Catholic nun will remain hospitalized for at least two
more weeks.
   Mother Teresa has had intermittent chest pains since she suffered
a heart attack on Sept. 8, three days after she was hospitalized
with a high fever.
   The Yugoslav-born nun founded the Missionaries of Charity in
October 1950. Her work with the poor earned her a Nobel Peace Prize
in 1979.

<TEXT>
   Justice Minister Monica de Greiff, who
traveled to the United States to seek protection for judges under
death threats from Colombian drug lords, resigned Thursday after two
months on the job, a radio chain reported.
   She would be the sixth justice minister in three years to resign.
   Ms. de Greiff, 32, has been threatened with death since she
signed an extradition order that brought Eduardo Martinez Romero to
Atlanta on Sept. 6 to face U.S. charges that he was a drug money
launderer for the Medellin cartel.
   The report by Radio Caracol could not be confirmed late Thursday
at either the presidential palace or the Justice Ministry. Her
resignation has been rumored almost since she took the post July 16.
   She has been constantly surrounded by bodyguards and secret
police scout the routes to and from the ministry before she is
driven to her office. She is said to take a different route every
day.
   After the radio report, Ms. de Greiff, a lawyer and mother of a
3-year-old son, met Thursday night with President Virgilio Barco at
the palace.
   Radio Caracol, quoting unidentified sources, said she handed a
letter of resignation to the president, who offered her the
ambassadorial post in Portugal. She reportedly declined.
   She traveled to Washington in August amid reports she had
resigned. But she repeatedly denied those reports, one of which was
by Caracol.
   In Washington, she met with U.S. government officials and won a
pledge of $19 million to provide security for the hundreds of
Colombian judges under death threats from drug traffickers. At least
41 judges and 220 court officials have been killed by traffickers
the past 10 years.
   Reports say she left her son in the United States because he was
also threatened by death, as was her husband.
   Wearing a black and white checkered suit, her blonde hair pulled
back in braids and her face framed by heart-shaped amethyst
earrings, the young minister has become well-known in the Colombian
and U.S. news media.
   When she teamed up with Barco, 69, she vowed to wage a tough
fight against the cocaine cartels, winning admiration for her
courage worldwide.
   ``What Americans are seeing is this brave old man, this young
woman and her child fighting these criminals,'' drug czar William
Bennett said in an interview with Newsweek.
   Barco's government is presently in crisis following allegations
that senior government officials are being paid by drug cartels.
   Early Thursday, 10 bombs ripped through the offices of Colombia's
main political parties after senators urged the government to
publish names of officials suspected of taking bribes from drug
barons.
   Newspapers Thursday identified 25 politicians denied U.S. visas,
following days of rumors the United States has a blacklist of
Colombian officials on the payroll of drug traffickers.
   Nine bombs in Bogota went off shortly after 3 a.m. in nine
offices of the governing Liberal Party and opposition Conservative
Party. Another explosion damaged a savings and loan bank.
   Two people were injured in the blasts.
   There have been reports the government has a list of politicians,
journalists, army and police officials allegedly spying for drug
cartels. During debate this week, senators asked the government to
make the alleged list public, but President Barco has denied such a
list exists.
   A list was published in newspapers Thursday naming 25 legislators
and other politicians recently refused entry to the United States.
   Foreign Minister Julio Londono Paredes said he will ask
Washington for its blacklist.
   ``We want to establish the context in which the information was
made public,'' he told reporters.
   Three senators claimed Thursday they were denied visas for
political reasons, rather than links to drug traffickers.
   Liberal Party presidential candidate Alberto Santofimio Botero
accused the United States of retaliating for his criticism of its
intervention in Latin America.
   He claimed one reason he was denied a visa is that he met
Medellin cartel leader Pablo Escobar, the most wanted man in
Colombia, eight years ago at a political rally while both were
congressmen. But he said he ``barely knew him.''
   Sen. Juan Slebi, also of the Liberal Party, said: ``This is part
of the war the United States is waging in our country ... for us to
submit to them on extraditions. But I will never approve of the
extradition of Colombians to battle narco-traffickers.''
   The U.S. Embassy refused to comment on the list, citing the
Privacy Act. Embassy spokesman Pablo Urutia said he did not know if
those denied visas are suspected of links to drug merchants.
   Barco declared war on the cocaine cartels after the Aug. 18
assassination of leading presidential candidate Sen. Luis Carlos
Galan, a staunch enemy of drug dealers. Barco then decreed emergency
measures empowering him to bypass Congress to extradite Colombians
to the United States.
   Only Martinez Romero, accused of being the Medellin cartel's
financier, has been extradited. Top drug barons remain at large,
including Escobar.

   The groom survived a plane crash, but the wedding
site was in the path of Hurricane Hugo, which had just rendered the
intended honeymoon resort a disaster area.
   ``I've had everything possible go wrong with this wedding so
far,'' said Tom Newberry, shortly after the crash of USAir Flight
5050. The plane skidded off a LaGuardia Airport runway into the
water late Wednesday. Two people died, and 59 survived.
   The flight was headed for Charlotte, N.C. Newberry was going to
Wilmington, N.C., on the coast 1{ hours north of Myrtle Beach.
   He's to be married there, to Connie Bland, on Saturday.
Unfortunately, Hurricane Hugo was expected to arrive about midnight
Thursday.
   The couple, both 27, then plan to take a honeymoon.
   ``You'd laugh if I told you (where),'' said Newberry. ``Virgin
Islands.''
   The Caribbean resort has been declared a disaster area. Hugo
passed through a string of islands Sunday and Monday, leveling
buildings, killing 26 people and leaving 50,000 homeless.
   Only once during the crash ordeal did Newberry, a New York City
banker, question if he'd make it.
   ``It's not a pleasant feeling,'' he said. ``There were problems
maneuvering the (police) boat and we got caught sort of sideways
near the boat. ... I was really mortified.''
   ``We just grabbed onto a big piece of floating wood and held on
for dear life,'' he said. ``I was just hoping and thinking that if
we just held onto the wood we'd be alright, surely some boat would
come get us. We were all screaming bloody murder at whoever was up
on the runway.''
   Those aboard knew what was coming about 30 seconds before the
crash, Newberry said.
   ``Everybody was kind of grim and just got down,'' he said.
``There was no indication given that there was going to be a crash.
Everybody just knew it.''
   Barely three hours later, Newberry seemed quite calm as he spoke
to reporters. He'd already called his fiancee twice.
   ``East River water doesn't taste real good,'' he recounted. ``My
shoes are at the bottom right now, along with all my clothing.''
   Newberry got off the plane via an emergency slide. Next he had to
figure out how to get to North Carolina. At last report, he was
planning to drive.

   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar
said Thursday the Dominican Republic, El Salvador and Equatorial
Guinea are so far behind in their dues they risk losing their vote
in the General Assembly.
   The U.N. Charter says any nation two years behind loses the right
to vote in the Assembly.
   The Assembly may let the country vote if it is satisfied that
failure to pay is due to circumstances beyond the country's control.
   The Dominican Republic, which is assessed about $224,000
annually, must come up with $223,600 to keep its voting rights, said
the U.N. chief's letter.
   El Salvador, assessed more than $74,000 annually, must pay
$12,057 and Equatorial Guinea, assessed the same, must pay $46,300
to keep their votes.
   When a small, impoverished nation has been unable to pay in the
past, its former colonial power or a major ally quietly paid the
dues.
   South Africa is also in arrears, but has refused to pay since the
General Assembly suspended its voting rights in 1974 as punishment
for its racial segregation policy. If its voting privileges were
restored, South Africa would have to pay more than $35 million to
regain its vote.
   Dues are based on a formula that largely relies on a nation's
gross national product.
   The United States still owes more than anyone. As of Aug. 31,
America was $278.8 million in arrears for past years and owes more
than $216 million for this year's dues, bringing the total close to
$500 million.
   The United States is assessed for one-fourth of the regular U.N.
budget, about $216 million a year.
   President Reagan's administration began withholding a large
portion of the U.S. dues starting in 1985 to spur reforms and budget
cuts at the world body. Reagan announced a year ago he was satisfied
with U.N. progress along these lines and authorized full payment of
U.S. dues and payment of all back dues on a six-year plan.
   Congressional committees refused to pay back dues this year,
citing constraints imposed by the U.S. federal budget deficit.

   President Bush is sending more than 1,100
troops to the Virgin Islands to halt a looting frenzy and protect
residents and tourists from the lawlessness still gripping St. Croix
two days after Hurricane Hugo's devastation.
   ``Members of the armed forces of the United States will be used
to suppress the violence ... and to restore law and order in and
about the Virgin Islans,'' Bush said in a statement Wednesday night.
   It appeared to be the first time in more than 20 years that a
president ordered active duty military personnel into the nation's
streets.
   The Pentagon said in a statement that 1,105 military police would
begin arriving in St. Croix by early morning on 16 Air Force C-141
Starlifter transport planes.

   A protein found in the brain of Alzheimer's
patients has been located elsewhere in their bodies, and that may
lead to better diagnosis and treatment of the disease that afflicts
2{ million Americans.
   The protein deposits appear in several tissues, including the
skin and intestines, indicating they may come from an unknown
substance that circulates in the blood, said Dennis Selkoe,
co-director of the Center for Neurologic Diseases at Brigham and
Women's Hospital in Boston.
   If so, finding ways to block delivery to the brain may help in
fighting Alzheimer's disease, he reported today.
   But he said it is too early to know if such an approach would be
useful. And another scientist said the research provides only
suggestive evidence for the idea that the protein deposits come from
a blood-borne source.

   People who sleep wearing contact lenses face 10-15
times the usual risk of potentially blinding eye ulcers, researchers
warned today.
   But many eye doctors already discourage patients from routinely
wearing their lenses to bed.
   ``You significantly increase the risk of complications when you
wear any contact lens overnight, and the more nights you wear it in
a row, the greater the risk,'' said Dr. Ronald E. Smith of the
University of Southern California.
   So-called extended-wear lenses are designed to be kept in the eye
for several days at a time. When approved in 1980, they were
recommended for use up to one month. But because of concern about
complications, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration reduced the
limit last May to one week.

   A ``very upset'' auto industry predicts many
more recalls will result from the swift collapse of a Bush
administration plan to let carmakers meet pollution targets by
averaging vehicle emissions.
   A House subcommittee removed the averaging plan from the
president's clean air bill Wednesday, in a unanimous voice vote that
shocked a standing-room crowd that expected a closely divided tally.
   The vote means the Bush bill would require each car sold in this
country to pass anti-pollution requirements for hydrocarbons, carbon
monoxide and nitrogen oxide. Current law has the car-by-car
requirement, but the Bush plan would make the standards tougher to
meet.
   Tim MacCarthy, of the auto industry's Motor Vehicle Manufacturers
Association, said the new standards would be too tough for each car
to meet after they're driven for several years.

   Richard Ramirez cooly flashed a sign of the
devil and muttered the word ``evil'' after jurors convicted him of
all 13 murders and 30 other felonies in the 1985 satanism-tinged
``Night Stalker'' rampage.
   The glum, shaggy-haired drifter refused to stay in the courtroom
when jurors returned their verdicts Wednesday after 22 days of
deliberations.
   The jury found that Ramirez was the devil-worshiping ``Night
Stalker'' who left satanic symbols at some murder scenes and forced
terrified victims to ``swear to Satan'' as they suffered unspeakable
assaults.
   Husbands were murdered in their beds and wives were raped beside
the dead bodies. One victim's eyes were gouged out.

   Thousands of Cambodians threw
Vietnamese troops flowers today as Hanoi began a pledged final
withdrawal from an 11-year war against resistance forces its
superior firepower could not suppress.
   In the government-organized ceremony, vehicles carrying thousands
of soldiers bearing rifles rumbled out of this northwestern province
after a band played pop music. A commander waved flowers in the lead.
   Vietnam says it is conducting a six-day withdrawal of its last
26,000 troops from Siem Reap and several other areas of the country.
But opposing guerrilla forces charge that Vietnam is faking the
troop movement and actually hiding and disguising its troops.
   Vietnam invaded Cambodia on Christmas Day 1978 and within two
weeks toppled the fanatical Communist Khmer Rouge regime, installing
a pro-Hanoi government in the capital of Phnom Penh.

<HEAD>TV Movie Features Tough Anti-Drug Unit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT MACY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Nasty Boys, a tough anti-drug police unit
with a penchant for breaking down doors and manhandling drug
dealers, touts the motto ``We Make House Calls.''
   That's the plan tonight when the TV version of the drug busters
visits homes across America (NBC, 9-11 p.m. EDT).
   Television crews spent several weeks here last spring putting
together a two-hour movie they hoped might evolve into a new series
this fall.
   The show failed to make NBC's series schedule, but producer Dick
Wolf hopes ``The Nasty Boys'' may still achieve that status, if the
public reacts well to the movie.
   The show, with Hollywood's usual poetic license, is based on the
activities of a crack anti-drug unit formed by the North Las Vegas
Police Department last year to fight the city's growing drug problem.
   The Nasty Boys, an elite band of undercover cops, wage a high
profile battle against the city's drug dealers _ breaking into crack
houses while wearing black Ninja-type outfits and masks to hide
their identity.
   City officials say the no-nonsense approach, using tactics
befitting the group's name, is paying off by making a dent in the
drug problem.
   Wolf, whose credits include co-producer of ``Miami Vice'' and
executive consultant on ``Hill Street Blues,'' sees ``Nasty Boys''
as the first of the '90s-genre cop shows.
   ``We want to tell the story that there is literally a war going
on against drugs,'' Wolf said. ``This is unapologetically
pro-police. This is pro-attitude that this drug problem has got to
stop.''
   Shooting locales ranged from a cemetery to crack houses to $4
million mansions. There were helicopter shots along the Las Vegas
Strip and shooting in and around the Las Vegas Hilton Hotel and
Casino.
   The idea was brought to Wolf after a segment on the anti-drug
unit was featured on ``The Reporters'' TV show. The Nasty Boys had
allowed a ``Reporters'' camera crew to follow them around on some
drug raids.
   ``They showed me this picture of the Nasty Boys, with their
masks, Ninja outfits and exotic weapons, posed against a brick wall
covered with graffiti,'' Wolf recalled. ``I told them, `This is a
hit show.'''
   Wolf said he took the idea to Brandon Tartikoff, president of NBC
entertainment, in mid-January and received the green light.
   Network executives did not see the finished version before
setting the fall schedule, Wolf said.
   ``There'll be some touching stuff, some stuff with families,''
Wolf said. ``It will show how five guys with diverse backgrounds are
molded into this very special team.
   ``It is exploitative in a most positive way. These cops are
heros. We've stayed away from gory violence. There are no gratuitous
killings.
   ``These guys are waging a war, but they're not vigilantes.
They're good cops. They use weapons most police wouldn't use, but
they're facing guys who do the same. They're not up against guys who
play by the rules.''
   Wolf admits to use of poetic license in developing a ``Nasty
Boys'' story line. In the movie, six members of a police tactical
team are killed by drug dealers and the city's mayor orders
formation of a group to handle the drug problem by using some of the
enemy's tactics. In fact, no such incident spawned the group.
   There is no name star in the show. The five principals play cops
who are used to being free agents and must now learn to work as a
group.
   A brother of one of the team members is ``dirty,'' obligated to
the mob because of _ what else? _ gambling debts. His involvement
puts members of the team in jeopardy, and Wolf isn't tipping his
hand on the outcome.
   The actual Nasty Boys team members are used in some of the
scenes, including a mock raid that was staged for the cameras.

<HEAD>Connie Chung, Producer of Her New Show, Defends Re-Creations</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   On Saturday night, James Earl Jones, a Tony
award-winner, will portray Rev. Vernon Johns, an early civil rights
activist in Alabama. A docudrama? Sort of. But it's from CBS News,
not the network's entertainment division.
   The dramatization appears on ``Saturday Night With Connie
Chung,'' a new series whose executive producer, Andy Lack, ran the
``West 57th'' series that Chung's series succeeds.
   He calls the new effort a ``contemporary `You Are There.'''
That's the CBS News series of the 1950s that, with Walter Cronkite
anchoring, re-created such historical events as Lincoln's Gettysburg
Address.
   But there's a difference.
   Chung says the technique her show uses is that of the Warren
Beatty film, ``Reds,'' which in telling the story of John Reed, an
American radical, interspersed interviews of people who knew him.
   The first half of Saturday's show will use that technique, she
says. CBS wouldn't provide a tape of the show for advanced
screening, but the balance is apparently devoted to interviews
concerning the modern relevance of Johns' urging his middle-class
black congregation to fight their complacency and stand up for their
rights. Johns died 24 years ago.
   Lack's new venture comes at a time old network strictures against
re-creations in news programs are easing, at least in NBC's
``Yesterday, Today &amp; Tomorrow.''
   But Saturday's show is not Lack's first re-creation for a news
program.
   He did it in 1983 with ``The Plane That Fell From the Sky,'' a
CBS Reports special about a jetliner that plummeted 33,000 feet
before its pilots regained control.
   In that re-enactment, he used the plane's real crew and 39
passengers from the near-fatal flight. But his use of an actor,
however distinguished, in a news series has raised eyebrows among
news traditionalists.
   Some, like ABC's Sam Donaldson, oppose re-creations in general,
saying that no matter how responsibly and honestly done, they cause
questions in the minds of viewers about what is real and what isn't.
   Lack says there won't always be re-creations on Chung's show
``but we're certainly not shy about them and we'll do them often.''
   Asked how he would respond to critics of re-creations in a news
program, he responded: ``This program speaks for itself. It needs no
defense or explanation.''
   For that matter, he says, he finds debate over re-recreations
``academic, pointless, foolish. I think it's just dumb.''
   Chung says she doesn't feel uncomfortable about dramatizations,
at least the kind that will be in her show. ``Not one bit,'' she
says. ``You'll see very clearly how it works. ... I think it works
beautifully.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   In addition to Chung's series, Lack is working on an outside
project commissioned by CBS Entertainment, a proposed dramatization
about Hedda Nussbaum and her role in the much-publicized beating
death of 6-year-old Lisa Steinberg in New York's Greenwich Village
two years ago.
   Lack's wearing of two hats, as a CBS News producer and as an
independent producer of a show for CBS Entertainment, is unusual but
not unprecented.
   In 1977, NBC made a formal effort to combine a news producer's
experience and background in making entertainment-division
docudramas. The network set up what proved to be a short-lived
experiment, headed by the respected news and documentary producer
Robert ``Shad'' Northshield.
   The unit had no involvement with NBC News. Neither did
Northshield while he headed the unit. He was on loan from the news
division. No projects were ever made, and Northshield moved on to
CBS News.
   Lack says his CBS News colleagues ``have no problem with my work
outside the CBS News division.'' He says he believes ``everyone here
knows where my heart is, in news. But I'm allowed to dabble in other
areas from time to time without it threatening the institution.''
   The story of Hedda Nussbaum would seem ripe for a dramatization.
Her lover, Joel Steinberg, was sent to prison last March for killing
his illegally adopted daughter, Lisa. Nussbaum, who had observed the
child's abuse for years but said she had also been beaten by
Steinberg, testified against him and charges against her were
dropped. Her life with Steinberg, and her failure to prevent Lisa's
death, brought her both public sympathy and condemnation.
   No script has been written for the Nussbaum program yet and the
proposal is still in discussion stages, Lack said. He declined to
say if Nussbaum is being paid for her story. ``I have nothing to say
about that,'' he said.

   Vision Interfaith Satellite Network, the year-old
venture of a consortium of 22 different faith groups, will expand
its hours and add new programs to its faith- and values-oriented
schedule beginning Oct. 9.
   ``We begin our second year with a renewal of our commitment to
offer a full range of religious programming,'' said Wil Bane, chief
executive of VISN, which was started Sept. 19, 1988, by the National
Interfaith Cable Coalition.
   VISN will expand its schedule to 18 hours, from 8 a.m. to 2 a.m.
Eastern.
   New programs include ``On The Line,'' a call-in show; ``The Joy
of Music,'' discussion and perfomance of classical and sacred music;
``Family Theater;'' ``Short Story Sampler;'' and ``Children's Video
Bible.''
   Two October specials are Zubin Mehta conducting the Israeli
Philharmonic at the ancient fortress Masada on Oct. 4 to salute the
Jewish New Year, and live coverage Oct. 16 of the ``World Food Day
National Conference'' in Washington.

   The National Conference of Catholic Bishops
will give $7.2 million collected in parishes across the country to
213 self-help poverty groups as part of the Campaign for Human
Development.
   ``The funding of these projects, in which low-income people
organize to improve their lives, is firmly grounded in the social
teachings of the church and in America's traditional concern and
compassion for the poorest among us,'' said St. Louis Archbishop
John L. May, president of the national conference.
   Since its inception in 1970, the Campaign for Human Development
of the U.S. Catholic Council has funded more than 2,500
community-based self-help groups, said the Rev. Alfred LoPinto,
executive director. ``The issues that concern them most are decent
wages and benefits, quality education for their children, affordable
housing and drug-free communities.''
   The 1989 annual CHD collection in each of the nation's Catholic
parishes is the weekend of Nov. 18-19.

   The American Jewish Committee, American Jewish
Congress and Anti-Defamation League will work together toward
reversing a ``deterioration'' in communication between the Jewish
community and Christian bodies.
   Citing a ``lack of sensitivity'' by both Christians and Jews to
important issues, the three organizations on Sept. 13 announced an
agreement to form the International Interreligious Entity.
   They called in a statement for review of Christian ``policies and
theological formulations'' seen by Jews as ``erosions of earlier
positions that were theologically more forthcoming and politically
more sensitive to Jewish concerns.'' They also said Jews need ``a
more effective instrumentality that can conduct a wide-ranging
dialogue with Christian counterparts.''
   ``We hope to advance constructive relations between us and
international Protestant, Catholic and Christian Orthodox bodies,''
they said.
   Leadership will be shared by Rabbi Leon Klenicki of the ADL,
Michael Wyschogrod of the Jewish Congress and Rabbi A. James Rudin
of the Jewish Committee, who will be the first chairman.

   One of the most intimidating threats to peace of
mind is a Congress searching for new sources of revenue, because
somewhere, somehow, someone will have to pay.
   The threat is all the more real because in this, if not in other
matters, Congress' mind seems to be made up _ never on details,
perhaps, but on the general idea that government forever will need
more money.
   In ways most people do not understand, proposals for tax cuts
become tax increases, and whenever a tax decrease escapes into law
it is thereafter stripped of all its benefits, leaving little more
money in taxpayers' pockets.
   Throughout the 1980s, tax cuts have been eroded by subsequent
increases, some of them imposed with little publicity. Why? Because
they appeared almost insignificant at the time. But as they say,
little increases do add up.
   Consider the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981. It promised
corporate tax reductions averaging $51 billion in the years 1987-89.
But by 1986, says the Tax Foundation, this ``reduction'' became a
$20 billion-a-year increase.
   Somehow, such things happen when Congress goes rummaging through
the tax code, and it may happen again. As your neighbors might tell
you, it is one of the most fearsome things that can happen to good
Americans.
   The latest tax go-round probably was initiated by President Bush,
who proposed that capital gains taxes, the kind imposed on
investment earnings, be cut substantially, from as high as 33
percent to as low as 15 percent.
   To do so, he said, would raise revenue, for a couple of years at
least, because lower taxes would encourage people who owned stocks
to redeem them for cash, and thereby declaring their capital gains
and paying their taxes.
   Besides, he suggested, it was only fair. Such investments involve
risk, he observed. The benefits from such investments are delayed
rather than immediate. And much of the tax is imposed on inflated
rather than real returns.
   Some members of Congress rebelled, saying such a cut would be a
gift to the rich, and could not be permitted. The rich should be
taxed more, they said, and so they proposed a tax increase, which
Congress is now considering.
   In such manner has a tax cut generated the threat of a tax
increase.
   Seldom, however, is any tax matter as open, clear and
understandable as that. In the past, Congress has actually passed
taxes it never meant to pass, and has ommitted items it thought it
had included. Always there are surprises.
   In the recent tax increase proposal, for instance, the emphasis
is on making life more expensive for the rich, even though the
definition of ``rich'' is highly suspect.
   (In tax logic, for instance, a person who never made $20,000 a
year but who, through lifelong discipline, may be rich for the one
year in which the funds are redeemed, is defined as rich. And so
taxed.)
   Somehow, in this latest proposal, the matter of private pension
funds was introduced. They have lots of money, $2 trillion or more,
so it wasn't askew of tax reasoning to go after them.
   And so the suggestion is being made: Why not tax these tax-exempt
entities every time they are involved in a short-term securities
trade?
   Typically, the rationale being offered is not that Congress wants
more money, but that those pension funds should be investing for the
long term. Too much of America, it is said, is thinking short-term.
This will help correct it.
   It could do more than that. It could become the foot in the door,
or if you prefer, the nose of the camel in the tent. That is, more
could follow, drawn irresistibly by the vast possibilities of such
vast sums of money.

   At the Science Lab in midtown Manhattan, the same
studio where Irving Berlin composed standards, keyboardist David
Frank and singer Mic Murphy churn out funk.
   ``Don't Disturb This Groove'' and ``You're in My System'' won't
make anyone forget ``Blue Skies'' or ``White Christmas,'' but Frank
and Murphy, whose songs have climbed the charts, aren't complaining.
   Neither are Phil Collins, Phillip Bailey, Stevie Winwood, Chaka
Khan and Nona Hendryx, some of the artists who have received help _
songwriting or production _ from the two-man funk band appropriately
called The System.
   ``One day, the phone rang and I woke up and picked it up,'' Frank
recalled. ``Mic said, `I know what the name of the group should be.'
He said `The System.' I said I don't like that. I thought it should
be more colorful. The next morning, I called him and woke him up and
said I liked the name.''
   That was in 1982. Frank and Murphy had just met, written a song,
``In Times of Passion,'' and persuaded Atlantic Records to release
it. One problem: What should they call themselves? The
``Frank-Murphy Project'' was definitely out, it sounded too much
like an album-rock band. Murphy considered Fiberglass and This
Record Itches before thinking of The System and phoning Frank.
   ``It has so many meanings. It's political, the body, a manner of
the way things work together. We can go on. I was thinking, `Dave is
from Boston and I'm from Jamaica, Queens.' I used to say, `We are
America.' We have the whole spectrum on the East Coast,'' Murphy
said.
   Names matter, Frank and Murphy insist. When they start writing a
song, the title often comes first; music and lyrics are filled in.
That's why ballads are rare for The System. Working titles such as
``Groove'' and ``You're in My System'' just don't seem right for
slow songs. Neither do ``Midnight Special'' nor ``Wicked,'' tracks
off their new album ``Rhythm &amp; Romance.''
   ``A lot of times we'll fit things together,'' Frank said. ``The
Beatles used to do exactly the same thing: `Let's just take this
bridge and inject it into this song.'''
   Their childhoods had little in common, except a love for music.
Frank grew up in the Roxbury section of Boston, literally on the
wrong side of the tracks.
   ``I lived at the edge of town,'' Frank said, ``and WLIB was the
only R&amp;B station in the Boston area and only during daylight hours.
Right when we crossed into our town, I'd be listening to my mother's
car radio and it would fade out and we'd get a Top 40 station from
Baltimore.''
   While Frank had to fumble with the radio dial to hear the music
he loved, rhythm and blues was practically in Murphy's backyard. The
local barbershop was owned by the father of future Funkadelic
guitarist Eddie Hazel and several other aspiring funk stars _ Eddie
Martinez, Marcus Miller and Ronnie Drayton _ were in the
neighborhood.
   ``I was in bands when I was 10 or 11,'' Murphy recalled. ``
`Little Mic and the Soulshakers.' We played a lot of social clubs
and dances at the time. My parents and their friends went to these
clubs and because we were the only young kids who had a band, we got
to play every weekend.
   ``People would say, `They're so cute.' We were getting paid 50
bucks a night. We'd be the midnight floor show. We'd play all the
new songs and the audences loved it. We were like the local Jackson
5.''
   Frank, meanwhile, was being groomed for a more highbrow career,
studying classical piano at the New England Conservatory and
Berkeley College of Music. Rock 'n' roll won out, but he did not
forget his early training.
   ``It affects the way I think of music,'' Frank said. ``I'll refer
to a song as a concerto, a vocal concerto.''
   ``That's what happened with `Don't Disturb This Groove,''' Murphy
added. ``That's the first movement. `Soul to Soul' on this album is
the second movement.''
   The Sytem has other influences, including the Rolling Stones, Sly
and the Family Stone, Parliament-Funkadelic and Led Zeppelin. Frank
and Murphy's musical tastes ranged so wide, they at first had no
idea into which radio format or formats their songs would fit.
   ``We'd never been on a chart,'' Frank said. ``I looked at the
label and saw our names as producers and thought, `So that's what
producuers do.' We didn't have any plan in mind. We just did it were
getting paid more money than we had ever gotten before.''

   The federal agency that polices the commodity
markets has been called a snoozing watchdog since scores of Chicago
traders were indicted for fraud this summer, but its top cop says
the charges show the system works.
   ``You wouldn't have had the results you had without our
involvement in this,'' said Dennis Klejna, enforcement chief of the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
   Klejna reluctantly agreed to an interview to talk aobut the work
of the commission, which is under congressional review for
reauthorization of its authority. It faces extraordinary scrutiny
partly because of a major fraud scandal in the freewheeling
commodity pits of Chicago.
   More than 40 traders and brokers at the Chicago Board of Trade
and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange were indicted in August, the
result of a 2{-year undercover investigation in which FBI agents
posing as traders taped conversations.
   To congressional critics, the scope of the indictments suggested
that the defendants had used the commodity pits as their personal
profiteering club and that the commodity commission had been lax in
detecting and stopping it.
   ``Yes, a lot of people were indicted,'' Klejna said. ``I guess
people can say that's a large number and there may be more _
potentially _ we don't know that yet, or at least we're not going to
comment on it.''
   But Klejna (pronounced CLAY-neh) said the Chicago indictments
``should not be seen as a sign of weakness but rather as a sign of
strength.''
   The commodity commission is an independent agency that oversees
13 futures markets in Chicago, New York and other cities, much like
its sister agency, the Securities and Exchange Commission, which
oversees the stock and bond markets.
   While it considers the exchanges and their rules as the first
line of defense against fraud, the commodity commission is
responsible for keeping the futures markets fair.
   Klejna, a 42-year-old lawyer with prematurely gray hair, knows
about that strength first hand. He has been with the commission
almost from its creation by Congress in 1974.
   He was an officer with the Army's Judge Advocate General Corps
when he read about a new federal agency seeking lawyers.
   A 1971 law school graduate from Fordham University in his native
New York, Klejna joined the commission as a staff attorney in August
1976 and rose to special counsel in 1978, deputy director of
enforcement in 1981 and director since April 1983.
   This past week, he was one of several senior federal agency
executives who received the presidential award for distinguished
service.
   ``Fiscal year 1989 was one of the most challenging and active
years in the history of the commission,'' the agency's 1991 budget
proposal for Congress says. But to Klejna, ``they're always busy
years.''
   To get to his sixth floor office in downtown Washington, visitors
must thread through a maze of receptionist desks and crowded
computer work stations that suggest the commission is outgrowing its
space.
   Klejna's corner office reveals little of the man who oversees the
commodity police force. There is a large desk and table, some chairs
and an American flag in one corner. Two works of art decorate a
wall, both of them framed posters _ one from the American Ballet
Theater.
   Among the many undisclosed details of the Chicago probe is
whether the commission uncovered the wrongdoing first and alerted
the FBI or vice versa. The commission has no criminal authority and
can seek only civil sanctions for trading violations, tapping its
enforcement staff of 140, half of them lawyers.
   ``I do think you could say they are attempting an enormous job
with inadequate resources and that there is no question of the
integrity and concientiousness of that division,'' said Alton
Harris, a prominent Chicago lawyer and expert on securities and
commodities regulation.
   ``Having said that, however, I think there are substantial
questions as to whether they have their priorities properly
aligned,'' Harris said. A number of market problems, he said, ``are
best left to rule-making procedures and interpretative guidance
rather than enforcement or disciplinary actions.''
   That sentiment seems to be shared by several commodities lawyers.
   Just a few weeks before the indictments were announced, Klejna
was a panelist at an American Bar Association function in Chicago.
   ``And not one, but two defense lawyers that were on that panel
talked about how trading abuses had gone on all the time and what's
the big deal,'' Klejna said.
   He said the lawyers also questioned the appropriateness of
prosecuting traders for what had been seen in the past as
essentially ``parking ticket'' violations.
   But to Klejna, they are still illegal.
   In July, Klejna announced that a New York-based commodity futures
trading concern and three affiliates had agreed to pay a record $4
million to settle allegations of fraud in cocoa contracts.
   This year Klejna also concluded what he called the largest
anti-fraud sales solicitation case the commission ever brought, with
lawsuits against two commodity options firms.
   They were accused of misleading customers on investment risks
that ran up millions of dollars in losses over five years while the
firms took hefty sales commissions.
   Klejna has appeared uncomfortable in the glare of television
lights. His voice trails off behind a thicket of microphones and he
masks emotion with a stern face.
   Despite his ill ease with publicity, Klejna says it will be
worthwhile if he shows ``the high level of commitment and
professionalism from the enforcement program at this agency, which
has been doing its job all along.''

<HEAD>Farmers Union, Yeutter Look at Farm Bill Differently</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Farmers Union and Agriculture
Secretary Clayton Yeutter would agree that profitable, family-owned
agriculture is a noble dream of American farmers.
   But the NFU has its own ideas how best to achieve mastery of the
agricultural dream machine, and Yeutter has a few of his own.
   They're not alone.
   Many other agricultural and commodity organizations, individuals,
analysts and special interest groups of all sorts are jockeying for
position as Congress works on the 1990 farm bill to replace the 1985
law.
   And Yeutter is not the only one who has a say in what the Bush
administration wants in the 1990 bill. Trade policy, budget
requirements, White House political nit-picking and dozens of other
factors litter the road ahead.
   Yeutter has said repeatedly that the administration doesn't have
its specific farm bill proposals ready for Congress but hopes to
outline those by the end of the year.
   But a look at some of NFU's legislative desires and a few of
Yeutter's ruminations might help a bit to clarify some of the
thinking as farm bill debate unfolds.
   Earlier this month, about 150 NFU members from 16 states, mainly
in the Midwest and Great Plains, participated in a two-day
``fly-in'' to Washington that included brisk lobbying treks to
Capitol Hill.
   The current farm law, the Food Security Act of 1985, covers a
multitude of programs, from conservation, credit and fish farming to
food stamps, rural development, research and trade.
   But the heart of the 1985 law _ and its predecessors for more
than half a century _ is the array of commodity programs that
provide federal price supports and related benefits for milk, sugar,
wool and major crops such as wheat, feed grains, cotton, rice and
soybeans.
   Among other things, the 1985 law gave the Agriculture Department
more discretionary authority in administering commodity programs,
including reductions in some of the price support benefits. A goal,
supported heartily by the Reagan administration, was to help make
U.S. products more competitive in foreign trade.
   Supporters of this approach say the 1985 law has been successful
in this regard. The NFU disagrees.
   ``Low farm prices are not the answer to our problems,'' says NFU
president Leland Swenson. ``Low prices are the problem.''
   In letters to members of Congress, Swenson and NFU vice president
Michael V. Dunn said farmers and consumers alike ``are all
interested in promoting the sustainability of our natural resources,
promoting the sustainability of our communities and ensuring a
stable, safe food supply.''
   The NFU is proposing a 10-point legislative list that features
``a voluntary supply management program'' based on using bushels or
other units of production instead of acres to control crop output.
   It also would encourage participation in the program by offering
farmers higher price support loan rates and higher target prices for
base levels of crop production. These are key items that the 1985
farm law allowed to be reduced.
   The NFU says a bushel-based system of supply management would
allow the government to ``better predict farm program costs and give
farmers income protection without sacrificing crop rotation
flexibility.''
   Yeutter also thinks there should be more flexibility for farmers
to rotate crops and have more management control.
   ``A primary objective for the price and income support elements
of the new farm bill should be to reduce the rigidity of present
programs,'' Yeutter told the American Soybean Association in July.
   One proposal, called the ``triple base'' plan, would limit crop
deficiency payments under the target price formula _ a subsidy
making up the difference between the market price and the target
price for a specific crop _ to the existing base acreage or a
portion of it. Farmers could then plant other crops on the remainder
without losing any of their acreage base.
   ``Flexibility is not just a back-door way to cut target prices,
as some have labeled it,'' Yeutter said. ``Even though budget
constraints must be addressed in all 1990 legislative proposals,
greater flexibility should and can be achieved because it is the
right thing to do.''
   The NFU wants Congress to include in the 1990 farm bill a
statement ``that would reaffirm policy designed to foster and
sustain the family farm system of agriculture.''
   It also would recognize that the objective ``is to ensure that
U.S. consumers have ample quantitites of domestically produced,
nutritious, safe and reasonably priced food and farm products. Such
an objective is long-term and non-negotiable.''
   One of the paragraphs, according to NFU, should declare that the
1990 farm bill ``must enhance, promote and be fully supportive of
the family farm structure'' and ``must avoid measures which would be
detrimental to family-scale operations.''
   At a White House news conference on Sept. 15, Yeutter was asked
about his role and the usual perception of farmers that the
secretary of agriculture is their champion.
   Yeutter said he intends to be ``a champion for the interests of
American agriculture'' and believes that he can be as vigorous and
effective as anyone who has ever held the job.
   ``But I'm not always the champion for some of the programs that
some ... would prefer to be enacted into law,'' he said. ``The
question is what does one champion? And I'm going to be the champion
of agricultural programs that I believe are in the best interest,
the best long-term interest of American agriculture.''

<HEAD>Nancy McKeon Stars in True Story of Tracey Thurman</HEAD>

   Nancy McKeon was so frightened the first time
she read the script for ``A Cry For Help: The Tracey Thurman Story''
that she couldn't look at it again for a week.
   The NBC movie, to be broadcast Monday, tells the story of a
Connecticut woman who in 1983 was permanently crippled and almost
killed by her estranged husband after police ignored her pleas for
protection.
   ``It was a scary story for an actor to do,'' McKeon said. ``But I
also felt it was too important to let go. I talked to Tracey and
that convinced me to do it.
   ``For a woman who's gone through all that, Tracey is very
strong,'' said McKeon. ``She has a great perspective on things.
People need to see that someone who went through that can come back
and have a positive attitude. People need to see there's someone
that strong out there.''
   The attack, in which Thurman was stabbed 13 times and suffered a
broken neck, left her partially paralyzed. Thurman's lawsuit against
the Torrington, Conn., police prompted reforms in police response to
domestic violence there.
   ``They told her she'd never walk, but she can walk. Her left side
can work but has no feeling. Her right side does not function and is
hypersensitive. Her 3-year-old son watched while his father did this
to his mother. He's still trying to get through those feelings,''
McKeon said.
   ``This is not a fun movie. People are going to watch it and see
parts of their own lives in it.''
   ``The Tracey Thurman Story,'' which stars Dale Midkiff as the
husband, Buck, and Bruce Weitz as Thurman's attorney, is the first
time McKeon has been on the screen since the end of ``The Facts of
Life'' in 1988.
   ``I took a year off and turned down everything,'' she said. ``I'd
been on the show for eight years and every hiatus I'd done a movie.
I've never had any time off. I needed time to get some things into
perspective.
   ``I traveled, I spent a lot of time with my family. When you're
working everything else has to take second place. You don't want it
that way, but your work comes first. I love to work. I could work
all the time. I had to force myself to take time off.''
   McKeon had been scheduled to star in a television series based on
the hit movie ``Working Girl,'' but quit the show.
   She cited ``personal reasons'' for leaving the show, scheduled as
a midseason replacement for NBC. She was to play Tess McGill, the
role that brought Melanie Griffith an Academy Award nomination.
   Harris Katleman, president of Twentieth Television Corp., said in
a statement that a new actress would be cast in the role. McKeon
will remain under contract to Twentieth to develop a television
series.
   McKeon has been working as an actress since she was 2. Her
brother, Philip, was on ``Alice'' and now divides his time between
acting and working as an assistant director.
   ``I grew up in Queens, so I feel at home in New York,'' she said.
``We lived in Forest Hills, and when they still had the tennis
tournament there some of us kids ran a parking concession. We'd save
spaces on the street and charge $5. Those were my hoodlum days.
   ``Philip and I did commercials and modeling in New York. He was
in a couple of plays. I was 12 when Philip got `Alice' and we moved
here. I didn't work for a long time because nobody knew me. Then I
started doing things for Aaron Spelling like `Starsky and Hutch,'
`The Love Boat' and `Fantasy Island.' I started `Facts of Life' when
I was 14.''
   McKeon came into ``Facts of Life'' when it was revamped at the
end of the first season. She played Jo, the tough kid from the Bronx.
   ``I think they thought I'd play off well against Blair, who was
spoiled and rich,'' she said. ``I wasn't too enthusiastic about
doing it. I thought I'd only have about a half a line a show. Then
when I got the script I saw it was a character I could play.''

   It's not quite a replay although it comes close
_ President Bush is accused of timidly yielding the diplomatic
initiative to Moscow but insists he isn't going to be pressured into
hasty offers on arms control.
   When that script was written, only last May, Bush produced the
ending, silencing his critics with a proposal for conventional arms
cuts in Europe that upped the Soviet ante. Now the complaints are
about foot-dragging on strategic arms reductions.
   There's no hint that the administration has a September surprise
ready to match its springtime comeback. But the White House does
control the agenda, and that carries with it the power to undercut
Democratic attacks on Bush-style diplomacy.
   It happened before, less than four months ago, with the same cast
and similar dialogue. Bush got the last word and Democratic leaders
had to switch overnight from complaints to applause.
   In both cases, Soviet officials also criticized the
administration's diplomatic pace. This time, 10 days before his
Thursday meeting with Bush, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze said the administration had been restrained, indecisive
and timid in arms talks.
   The White House called that complaint mystifying.
   Senate Democratic Leader George Mitchell of Maine said Monday
that Bush ``must reach beyond the status quo thinking that appears
to dominate administration policy.''
   ``He must cast aside the ambivalence, the hesitation and the
timidity and adopt a more energetic and engaged policy toward the
Soviet Union and eastern Europe,'' Mitchell said. ``The
administration appears to have become complacent about the arms
control process, trusting that the Soviets will do the work and
provide the results.''
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III dismissed Mitchell's
comments as political talk. ``When the president of the United
States is rocking along with a 70 percent approval rating on his
handling of foreign policy, and I were the leader of the opposition
party, I might have something similar to say,'' he said.
   Baker and Shevardnardze are spending the weekend in Jackson Hole,
Wyo., discussing arms control and other U.S.-Soviet issues.
   ``Now, will we conclude a treaty in Wyoming? The answer to that
is obviously no,'' Baker said. ``I think if you will judge us at the
end of the day, hopefully next Sunday, that you will agree that
we've moved the process forward substantially across the full range
of our arms control agenda.''
   He said that includes strategic arms reductions, chemical
weapons, and long-stalled negotiations on nuclear testing. Baker
said he also hopes the Soviets will move toward acceptance of Bush's
proposal that both sides cut their conventional forces in Europe.
   That was the U.S. proposal that stilled the earlier round of
criticism, after months during which the Soviets seemed to be
out-maneuvering the new administration. Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev announced unilateral cuts in troops and weapons in the
East, scoring public relations points in western Europe while Bush
was silent, awaiting a review of U.S. policy.
   At home, the Democrats complained about the president's pace. But
Bush turned that around at the end of May, proposing conventional
arms cuts with solid allied support at the NATO summit in Brussels.
He said the offer put the United States on the offense and tested
Soviet intent. ``We may be at an important turning point in history,
one in which the security environment in Europe can be
transformed,'' Sen. Mitchell said at the time.
   Now the cycle is recurring, with a new agenda.
   Bush said anyone who thinks the administration is reluctant to
move forward on strategic arms talks is misreading his intent,
perhaps because the conventional arms proposal was his first
priority.
   ``We're working inside our own administration to have proposals
that I think will capture the imagination of the Soviet Union,''
Bush said Monday. He didn't say when.
   ``I think we have to be careful not to become frantic and rush
out here to negotiate a treaty on strategic arms, or anything else
for that matter, that would be non-ratifiable,'' Baker said. The
president said he was in no rush to stage a summit meeting with
Gorbachev.
   And he's calling the plays.

<HEAD>Hotels Offer Free Lodging For Cancer Patients</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HEIDI NOLTE BROWN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ethel Flippen was diagnosed with cancer in
January, but a daily 160-mile round trip from her home to a hospital
was daunting, and so was the cost of a hotel for the week of
radiation treatments.
   Flippen, of Emporia, wasn't the only one faced with the dilemma.
   ``We were having patients call us from out of town saying they
needed transportation into Richmond for their radiation therapy and
we were finding that these people were coming from long distances on
a daily basis,'' said Norma Rawls of the local American Cancer
Society.
   ``Financially it was hard on them ... physically it was hard on
them.''
   The society turned to the Metro Richmond Hotel and Motel
Association, which began offering patients free room and board.
About a dozen, including Flippen, have taken advantage of the offer
since the program began in March.
   ``I've had one patient tell me that she would not have been able
to get her radiation therapy had it not been for the hotel lodging
program,'' said Rawls. ``This is true of most of these patients.
They could not afford to stay in a hotel Monday through Friday for
eight weeks.''
   Flippen, who underwent 25 radiation treatments at Massey Cancer
Clinic of the Medical College of Virginia Hospitals, has stayed at
four of the two dozen participating inns. ``If it hadn't been for
the hotels and motels, I guess I would have just died,'' she said.
   ``To see them come together on something like this...to do
something good for the community in a very competitive industry is
something very special,'' said Jim B. Poppell, executive director of
the society's state chapter.
   ``We've talked to a lot of our counterparts across the country,
and we know of no other program where it's being made available at
no cost to patients.''
   Each of the participating hotels agree to provide two weeks of
complimentary lodging a year. Referrals come from social workers,
hospitals and oncologists such as Dr. Dean Goplerud at the Medical
College of Virginia.
   ``The typical patient will have treatments of four or five weeks.
They often feel tired and may suffer a loss of appetite, diarrhea
and nauseau,'' he said. ``The reason they require a place to stay is
because many of them live a long distance from Richmond and have to
come in every day for treatment. They get tired out from the long
drive.''
   If free lodging weren't available, Goplerud said, hospitalization
or missing treatments would be the only options for some patients.
``Some would continue to commute back and forth and feel miserable.''
   Richmond area hotel rooms range from $40 to $90 a night, said
Robert M. Ramsey, executive vice president for the Virginia and
Metro Richmond Hotel &amp; Motel associations, which are helping other
groups set up similar programs.
   ``It's going to be a natural for these other organizations to
pick up on this. For us this made sense,'' he said. ``It was a very
positive thing to do.''

<HEAD>Food Allergies Implicated in Dizziness, Hearing Loss</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Allergic reactions to foods may be responsible
for dizziness, hearing loss and ringing in the ears among thousands
of people who suffer a disorder called Meniere's disease, a study
concludes.
   The study of 49 patients with the inner-ear disorder was
conducted by Dr. Jennifer Derebery of the House Ear Institute. The
institute's president is Dr. John House, former President Reagan's
ear doctor.
   The 49 underwent testing to determine their food allergies, then
those foods were removed from their diets. Vertigo either was
reduced or eliminated in 66 percent of the patients. Half
experienced a decrease in ringing in their ears and several had
dramatic improvements in hearing.
   The foods most commonly linked to Meniere's disease were wheat,
eggs, milk, corn, yeast and soybeans.
   Thousands of Americans have the disease, in which excess fluid
accumulates in the labyrinth, the part of the inner ear that
controls balance.

<HEAD>Scientists Fight Popcorn Lovers' Plague: Unpopped Kernels</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHAMPAIGN, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Food engineering students cooked up 800
pounds of popcorn in an effort to combat the tooth-jarring plague
that afflicts popcorn lovers everywhere: UPKs, also known as
unpopped kernels.
   ``There are two basic problems that appear to cause an increase
in UPKs and a decrease in popping volume: shelling of the kernel off
the cob, and the moisture content of individual kernels at the time
of popping,'' said Steven Eckhoff, a food engineer at the University
of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
   During the summer, food engineering students using a movie
theater popper found that unpopped kernels were most likely those
that were too moist or too dry. Large kernels at the butt of an ear
of corn have the highest moisture content; small kernels near the
tip have the lowest.
   ``It follows, then, that companies could process kernels of
uniform size to decrease the number of unpopped kernels,'' the
university said.
   The researchers also found that if a kernel's outside covering is
damaged when kernels are removed from the cob, steam can't build up
inside the kernel. That also creates those dreaded UPKs.
   ``We're looking at ways to precondition the corn to loosen the
attachment of the kernel to the cob so you wouldn't need as much
mechanical force,'' Eckhoff said. ``Then you wouldn't damage the
kernels so much.''
   The research was funded by Beatrice@Hunt-Wesson Foods, parent
company of popcorn maker Orville Redenbacher.

<HEAD>Hot Spring Search Opens New Frontier of Deep Lake Exploration</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   On the bookcase behind biologist Jim
Milestone's desk at Crater Lake National Park is a reminder that the
National Park Service is ``gravely concerned'' about geothermal
development just outside the park.
   The park service was so concerned that drilling for heat left by
a volcano might rob the lake of clarity that it paid more than
$600,000 for a series of dives to look for hot springs. It also
focused attention on deep lakes, long the neglected stepchildren of
oceanography.
   ``It is finally begining to sink in that, gee, if we really want
to know this planet, we've got to get down under not only the oceans
of the world, but the fresh water as well,'' said Sylvia Earle, an
oceanographer and head of Deep Ocean Engineering, the maker of Deep
Rover, a one-person submarine.
   ``It awaited the last couple of years, a couple of crafty
(oceanographers), the Park Service and an issue, concern about
geothermal development, to awaken people to how much we did not
know,'' Earle said.
   In August, Oregon State University oceanographers Jack Dymond and
Bob Collier led 23 dives _ 13 seeking hydrothermal activity, five
for geological samples and five studying biology _ to the floor of
1,932-foot-deep Lake.
   They're convinced hot springs exist but didn't find conclusive
proof. They will spend a year on a report to help determine whether
Crater Lake stays on a list of national parks with significant
thermal features. If it does, Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan could
block geothermal development to protect the lake.
   What Dymond and Collier did find were mysterious blue pools of
dense salty water on the bottom laden with carbon dioxide and radon;
fluffy orange mats of iron-eating bacteria; elevated temperatures in
rock anchoring the bacteria and rust-colored spires resembling
stalagmites.
   At the deepest point of the lake, park biotechnician Mark
Buktenica found tiny craters and a midge fly larva.
   Last year, Earle found ordinary green moss growing at the
freshwater record depth of 725 feet. ``Part of it is the clarity of
the water, but I think there may be more to it than that,'' said
oceanographer Bruce Robison of the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research
Institute.
   Indian legends ascribe the formation of Crater Lake to a battle
between Llao, god of the underworld, and Skell, god of the surface
world. Geologists date the cataclysmic eruption of Mount Mazama to
6,850 years ago. The volcano collapsed, leaving a ``caldera'' that
filled with rain and melted snow and became a world standard for
lake clarity.
   Scientists became concerned that the lake was losing clarity and
in 1982, Congress ordered a 10-year study. The clouding appears to
be cause by growth in the population of microscopic plants called
phytoplankton. The Park Service discounts a theory that nitrates
from a septic system on the rim were feeding the plankton, but is
going to remove the system anyway.
   California Energy Co. filed leases just outside the park in the
Winema National Forest and in 1986 began drilling in search of
geothermal energy. The company says it would be impossible for its
work to affect the lake.
   Dymond began studying the lake in 1984. ``We found these unusual
chemical and temperature variations at that time.''
   Findings of a helium isotope he had seen in conjunction with
ocean hot springs bolstered the theory that hot springs could be
bubbling up through a crack ringing the lake bottom, producing heat
and salts that stir up the lake.
   A remote-controlled submersible made five dives in 1987. On one,
Dymond and Collier saw what looked like a plume of smoke curling up
from a crack, but they failed to get a temperature reading or a
water sample for proof.
   They returned last year for the first dives in Deep Rover.
Navigation problems plagued them, and after 17 dives they were
unable to claim more than encouraging evidence. This year, a system
called ultra-short baseline acoustic navigation, which uses sound
waves from four ground stations to locate the sub in three
dimensions, cured the echo problems.
   On Aug. 19, Collier piloted Deep Rover to a depth of 1,400 feet
in the South Basin, where hydrothermal explorations were
concentrated, and poked a probe into a bacterial mat, where it
registered 61 degrees Fahrenheit.
   Three days later, navigator James Cooley of Land and Sea Surveys
peered into the colored plots on his computer screen and directed
Dymond back to the area, where he found a temperature of 63.9
degrees Fahrenheit in another mat.
   The temperatures met the U.S. Geological Survey test for a
thermal spring _ 18 degrees higher than the mean annual air
temperature at the surface, which is 37.8 degrees. The water at the
lake bottom is 38.3 degrees.
   ``So it is a thermal spring in some sense,'' said USGS engineer
Manuel Nathenson in Menlo Park, Calif. Whether it's a ``significant
thermal feature'' as required by law ``is a judgment call by the
secretary of the Interior.''
   California Energy geologist Joe LaFleur is skeptical and suggests
that any flow at the lake bottom comes from cold mineral seeps.
``Certainly an objective scientist would have to appreciate that
nothing they have found would have any significant effect on the
lake,'' he said.
   Though the bacteria mats suggest something is flowing, Dymond and
Collier couldn't see it or devise any way to measure it. They hope
other data will show some fluid seeping through bottom sediments.
   One significant finding was made by Ray Weiss, a geochemist at
the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of
California, San Diego., whose team measured the amount of freon in
the water at the bottom of the lake, and found it had been at the
surface just three years ago.
   Nathenson said it appears the lake is like a layer cake, with the
top layer turning over like a normal lake in the spring and the
fall, and a series of thinner layers mixing from one to the other to
the bottom. In this way oxygen works down from the top and heat and
salts work up from the bottom.
   Dymond said the blue pools, one of which he dubbed Llao's
Bathtub, could be the source of unexplained salts found in the lake.
Those found in the South Basin have no apparent source; others found
on the north side of the lake appear to be fed by tiny streams that
pop out from under rocks.
   Excited by their successes, Dymond and Collier are talking about
expeditions to other deep lakes. First on their dream list is Lake
Baikal in Siberia, the deepest in the world at 5,315 feet.
   ```We are continually amazed,'' Collier said, ``at how little is
known about deep lakes.''

<HEAD>Trade Ministry Plans Tax Incentives to Boost Imports</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan's trade ministry is considering tax incentives
for companies that boost imports as a way to correct its $52 billion
trade surplus with the United States, officials said.
   ``We realize that Japan accounts for half of the total U.S. trade
deficit and therefore we are trying to vigorously increase our
imports,'' Yuzuru Hatakeyama, of the Ministry of International Trade
and Industry, told reporters Wednesday.
   Hatakeyama, director general of the International Trade Policy
Bureau, said the ministry is considering a plan to grant special tax
incentives for importers.
   During Japan's industrial buildup after its defeat in World War
II, incentives granted to exporters allowed them to reduce their
taxes by from 1 percent to 3 percent of the value of their exports.
The system was discontinued in 1964.
   Hatakeyama said the government is considering a similar system to
promote imports. The tax breaks would not extend to importers of raw
materials, he said.
   Japan is under pressure from the United States to increase its
imports and institute other economic and trade policy changes to cut
its surplus.
   Earlier this month, the two countries began a yearlong round of
bimonthly talks on structural impediments to trade in each nation,
and U.S. officials have said they expect ``measurable'' improvement
in the trade imbalance by next spring.
   Japan also has been named, along with India and Brazil, as a
possible target of retaliation under U.S. trade laws for policies
that allegedly hinder the sale here of supercomputers, lumber
products and satellites.
   U.S. Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher, in a three-day visit
to Japan last week, welcomed the idea of tax incentives to Japanese
importers as a far-reaching method of increasing imports and cutting
the trade imbalance.
   Total Japanese imports have risen 16.5 percent in the first eight
months of this year, and imports from the United States have
increased by 19.9 percent from the same period last year, the trade
ministry says.
   The senior trade official said the proposed tax breaks are not
likely to be implemented until next spring at the earliest, since
Parliament would have to approve legislation.
   But Hatakeyama admitted the tax breaks could take even longer
because of political uncertainties.
   Plagued by a series of scandals and an unpopular new sales tax,
the governing Liberal Democratic Party lost its majority in the
upper house of Parliament in July for the first time in 34 years.
   A general election for the more powerful lower house must be held
by next summer.
   It is not clear whether the proposed tax incentives would be
legal under rules of the international trade body known as the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
   ``But we hope no countries would complain about this scheme,''
Hatakeyama said.

<HEAD>SEC, Italian Securities Agency Reach Mutual Assistance Pact</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission and
Italy's securities market watchdog have announced a tentative mutal
assistance agreement.
   The announcement Wednesday came in a joint communique issued by
SEC Chairman David S. Ruder and Franco Piga, Chairman of the
Commissione Nazionale Per la Societa' e la Borsa (CONSOB).
   The communique covered only the exchange of information between
the two agencies.
   It was issued at the 14th Annual Conference of the International
Organization of Securities Commissions in Venice, which Ruder is
attending in one of his last official acts before stepping down at
the end of the month.
   The communique was described as ``an interim understanding''
between the two agencies to provide the fullest mutal assistance
permitted by law or regulation in their countries to exchange
information that will help each agency oversee markets, conduct
investigations and prosecute wrongdoers in their own jurisdictions.
   ``It is in the best interest of all nations to expose and
prosecute those who would abuse the integrity of the securities
markets,'' the two-page agreement said.
   It noted that Italian transactions in U.S. corporate securities
grew from about $269 million in 1985 to $1.8 billion in 1988.
Conversely, U.S. transactions in Italian corporate stock increased
from about $457 million to some $656 million over the same period.
   Both agencies ``contemplate that it will be a preliminary step to
a more expansive and comprehensive memorandum of understanding''
after they obtain the legal authority to do so, the communique said.

<HEAD>U.S. Automaker With Largest European Presence Wants More</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ford Motor Co., the U.S. automaker with the
largest and longest presence in Europe, wants more.
   During the past two weeks, Ford has acknowledged it is holding
talks with the Swedish car and truck maker Saab-Scania AB and has
started acquiring up to 15 percent of Jaguar PLC of England.
   Ford may be positioning itself in the European luxury car market
as it gets ready for the evaporation of trade barriers among the 12
members of the European Community in 1992, analysts said Wednesday.
   ``I think they want to move their image a little up market in
Europe,'' analyst Mary Anne Sudol of Fitch Investors Service Inc.
said from New York. ``They really have been a mass-market producer
and never have been regarded as having some specialities.''
   And there's a benefit for Jaguar, too, said analyst Scott Merlis
of Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. in New York.
   ``Ford could help Jaguar with product and technology,'' he said.
   Ford has declined to describe the nature of its talks with Saab.
Some analysts have speculated that Ford is interested in Saab's
heavy truck business, an area where Ford is weak in Europe.
   Ford's heritage in Europe dates back to the early years of this
century. Company founder Henry Ford started the automaker's European
connection in 1903 by exporting cars to England from the United
States. Five years later, Ford opened an office in France, the
company's first overseas branch.
   The continent has been important to Ford not only as a car and
truck market but as a base for its earnings. During the past two
years, profits from Ford's European operations have risen, to $1.46
billion last year, while North American earnings have fallen.
   Ford, which has a number of European assembly plants, isn't the
only U.S. automaker moving to increase its presence in Europe before
1992.
   Robert Lutz, president of Chrysler Motors Corp., the
vehicle-making arm of Chrysler Corp., said Wednesday that the No. 3
U.S. automaker has developed a network of 770 dealers in Europe. The
company recently introduced U.S-made versions of the Dodge Spirit
and Plymouth Acclaim to the European market, he added.
   He said Chrysler's European sales would reach 100,000 annually in
a few years. While that's far behind Ford's 1.7 million in European
car and truck sales last year, it marks a return to the European
market for Chrysler.
   Chrysler sold its European plants more than a decade ago when it
encountered financial trouble that led to a U.S. government bailout.
In February, it announced it would return to European production
through a joint venture with France's Renault to build a
sport-utility vehicle, now named the ``JJ,'' at plants yet to be
disclosed in Europe and the United States.
   General Motors Corp. sold 1.45 million vehicles in Europe last
year through its General Motors Europe subsidiary in Zurich,
Switzerland. GM began exporting U.S. cars to Europe in 1911 and
started making cars on the continent in the early 1920s. It now has
seven assembly and 30 component plants in Europe.
   GM owns all of Group Lotus PLC of Britain and has a European
joint truck venture with Isuzu Motors Ltd. of Japan.
   U.S. automakers must have assembly capabilities in Europe when
the trade barriers fall in about two years, Sudol said.
   ``It will be a fortress Europe and if they have no manufacturing
over there, they will have to jump over a high tariff wall,'' she
said.

<HEAD>Major Airlines Ponder American's Proposed Fare Hike</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's major airlines are pondering whether
they should match an American Airlines proposal that would raise
some discount fares by more than 15 percent and double cancellation
penalties.
   The increases proposed by American, one of the largest carriers,
would take effect Sept. 29. They would follow a recent rise in a
type of discount fare popular with business travelers, reflecting an
effort by airlines to partly recoup revenue lost from bargain fares
offered this summer to fall vacationers.
   Spokesmen for competitors of Dallas-based American said Wednesday
those airlines were considering matching the increases but hadn't
decided.
   ``I think there are several carriers out there that are inclined
to match,'' said Edward Starkman, an airline analyst at the
investment firm PaineWebber Inc.
   Under American's proposal, the popular ``MaxSaver'' cut-rate fare
often used by vacationers, which must be purchased 14 days in
advance, would be increased by $10 to $20 per round trip. A
``MaxSaver'' ticket on American between Dallas and Los Angeles, for
example, would go from $338 to $358 round trip. The ``MaxSaver''
tickets would remain non-refundable.
   In addition, American would raise fares on seven-day-advance
tickets by $30 to $60 round trip. The same Dallas-Los Angeles round
trip ticket bought seven days in advance would go from $378 to $438.
The penalty for changing or canceling a reservation would double to
50 percent of the ticket price.
   ``We're trying to get the yields up,'' said John Hotard, a
spokesman for American.
   An airline's yield, which reflects the average revenue from
passengers for each mile flown, is the lifeblood of the competitive
air transport industry.
   Starkman, like many industry analysts, is expecting little
improvement in yields overall for the rest of the year and into 1990.
   In mid-August, the airlines announced steep fare cuts for the
fall, extending summer travel bargains. They slashed round-trip
fares by as much as $160 to lure passengers in the historically weak
autumn season. Most fares to Europe were reduced by $100 into next
spring.
   Last week, in an effort to recover some of the losses, the
airlines boosted ``Supercoach'' one-way fares by about $20 for a
one-way ticket. These fares are favored by business fliers because
they have more lenient advance-purchase requirements than cheaper
discount fares and don't require a Saturday-night stay.
   Spokesmen for United Airlines, Continental Airlines, Delta Air
Lines, Northwest Airlines, USAir, Pan Am and Eastern Airlines said
Wednesday those airlines were studying American's proposal but
hadn't decided if they will match it.
   If they don't follow suit, it would be difficult for American to
raise the fares alone and remain competitive. But Hotard said the
airline planned to go ahead next week, in any case.
   American also announced Wednesday an increase in service from
Miami to become a larger competitor in that market, historically
dominated by Eastern, which has been hobbled by a prolonged strike.
   American's efforts to buy Eastern's Latin American route network
recently collapsed when Eastern decided not to sell it. But American
officials said the airline would seek government approval for routes
on its own.

<HEAD>Chase Manhattan Raises Loan-Loss Reseves, Takes Big 3rd Qtr Hit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VIVIAN MARINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chase Manhattan Co. has become the second major
U.S. bank this week to strengthen itself against problem Third World
debt, reflecting a growing realization among bankers that the money
lent years ago may never be fully repaid.
   In a major recapitalization plan announced Wednesday, Chase said
it would add $1.15 billion to its loan-loss reserves in the third
quarter and issue $500 million in new common stock. The move is
expected to result in a loss of more than $1 billion in the quarter.
   Manufacturers Hanover Corp. said Monday it would add $950 million
to its reserves and also issue up to $500 million in common stock.
But unlike Chase, it is raising much-needed capital by selling a
controlling interest in its financial services unit, CIT Group, and
a 4.9 percent equity stake to Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd. of Japan,
the world's largest bank, for about $1.4 billion.
   Chase said it would have an after-tax charge totaling $1.26
billion in the third quarter, which would result in a net loss of
$1.12 billion for the period. Chase said it didn't have an earnings
estimate for the full year.
   For the first six months of 1989, Chase earned $269 million, or
$2.57 per share, vs. $501 million, or $5.53 a share, a year earlier.
   Included in Chase's after-tax charge is the $1.15 billion
addition for the loan-loss reserve, an $85 million charge reflecting
the lower value of problem real estate assets in Chase's Arizona
banking subsidiary and a $25 million charge relating to securities
trading activities.
   ``The basic core earnings of the bank have been going well but
they have been masked by these three drags,'' Chairman Willard C.
Butcher told a news conference.
   Butcher said the actions would eliminate a current after-tax
earnings drag of about $200 million a year. ``This will result in
Chase entering the 1990s with renewed financial strength and
enhanced earnings potential,'' he said.
   Chase, with $100 billion in assets, is the second largest U.S.
bank behind Citicorp, which has assets of more than $210 billion.
   The Chase announcement came after the close of trading Wednesday
on the New York Stock Exchange. Chase was up $1.62{ at $39.50 a
share before trading was halted late in the day.
   Some industry analysts predicted the market would act favorably
to Chase's actions.
   ``It's a big step for Chase,'' said James J. McDermott Jr. of
Keefe Bruyette &amp; Woods. ``By stepping up and taking a big hit and
getting the problem into a different zone, it's going to allow for
greater focus on its core earnings base.''
   With the big charge, Chase's total reserve for possible credit
losses at the end of the third quarter will be about $3.7 billion.
   This includes about $2.9 billion for loans to developing nations,
or about 46 percent of Chase's total $6.2 billion of medium- and
long-term loans to Third World countries. The ratio had been 26
percent.
   The major New York money center banks generally have loan loss
reserves equalling roughly a third of their outstanding Third World
loans. Chase's new reserve ratio will lead the pack.
   Major banks have been under increasing pressure lately to boost
their reserves to cover Third World debt in the aftermath of the
recent Mexico debt agreement and the plan by Treasury Secretary
Nicholas Brady that emphasizes bank forgiveness of these accounts.
   ``This action resulted from our ongoing review of economic and
political conditions and our belief that recent developments,
including the Brady initiative, have resulted in increased pressure
on banks to reduce their claims ... and an increased resistance on
the part of some lesser developed nations to meet their contractual
obligations,'' Butcher said.
   He said the pressure ``has become apparent in the now-completed
Mexican negotiations and the negotiating positions announced by
other countries.''
   Chase's new stock issuance amounts to about 14 million shares. As
of June 30, Chase had 90.2 million common shares outstanding.
   The charge involving the Arizona subsidiary reflects the
continuing economic downturn in the Southwest. By establishing the
provision for the real estate loans and foreclosed property, Chase
anticipates improvement in the core earnings in that area. After-tax
losses for the first half of 1989 for that subsidiary totalled $30
million.
   Chase said it lost $25 million after taxes in the first half from
securities trading. It said the third-quarter charge reflected its
decision to get out of market-making in British government bonds and
U.S. mortgage-backed securities.

<HEAD>Adobe Strikes Back in Battle Over Computer Typefaces</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Adobe Systems Inc. is hoping to keep Apple
Computer Inc. from stealing its thunder in a battle over typefaces
that has the computer industry's biggest names choosing sides.
   Adobe said Wednesday it would take the unusual step of making
public some valuable technical information about the way its
PostScript software creates letters, numbers and other figures on a
page.
   That step, while helping Adobe's competitors, should confirm the
Adobe system as an industry standard and deal a blow to a joint
effort by Apple and Microsoft Corp. to create a new standard,
analysts said.
   The seemingly obscure battle will affect the course of desktop
publishing, which makes it possible for personal computer owners to
create professional-looking documents and publications using special
software and laser printers.
   John Warnock, Adobe's chairman, chief executive and co-founder,
announced the decision to publish PostScript specifications in an
emotional speech at a conference in San Francisco.
   He said he feared Apple's unspecific plans for new software
amounted to ``vaporware'' that could jeopardize a valuable existing
standard.
   Steve Jobs of Next Inc. lined up on the side of Adobe at the
Seybold Computer Publishing Conference and Exposition, while Bill
Gates of Microsoft sided with Apple.
   ``This is like a soap opera. It's melodrama at its best,'' Bill
McGlynn, marketing manager for the Boise printer division of
Hewlett-Packard Co., said in a telephone interview from the
conference.
   An agreed-upon standard makes things easier for makers of
computers, printers and new typefaces as well as computer users.
With Adobe's announcement, companies that already use PostScript may
decide to stick with it instead of spending their efforts on the
Apple-Microsoft plans, analysts said.
   ``A lot of people think this is a very good move,'' said David
Nelson, an analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. He said customers
attending the conference ``overwhelmingly'' indicated in a show of
hands that they would stick with Adobe.
   Adobe's stock was hurt Wednesday by the Apple-Microsoft
combination, which came after the close of trading Tuesday, but
helped by Adobe's counterploy. It closed the day off 37{ cents at
$19.75 in over-the-counter trading.
   Adobe, of Mountain View, Calif., rose rapidly in recent years to
dominate the software that goes into laser printers and controls
their output.
   Apple, which had been Adobe's biggest customer, signalled its
intention to go its own way earlier this year when it sold its 16
percent stake in Adobe.
   Apple and Microsoft, which are battling each other in an
unrelated copyright suit, set aside their differences Tuesday to
announce they would swap technology on advanced printer fonts. The
plan is for Macintosh computers and IBM-type computers using
Microsoft base software to have identical font capabilities.
   Gates, the Microsoft chairman, said the plan is to improve upon
PostScript. But he acknowledged that the improvements could render
the two sets of software incompatible.
   Jonathan Seybold, the host of the San Francisco conference,
predicted that the first software from that alliance would not be
shipped before 1991.
   Adobe's president, Charles Geschke, said in a phone interview
that the company had planned to publish the PostScript
specifications within a matter of months anyway but speeded up its
plans in hopes of keeping the industry standard from splitting.

<HEAD>American Health, Reader's Digest Deal Reported</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Owners of American Health magazine are talking to
an unidentified publishing company about selling the 8-year-old
magazine, and a media industry newsletter identified it as Reader's
Digest Association Inc.
   Owen Lipstein, head of American Health Partners, said Wednesday
the partnership was ``having discussions'' about selling the
magazine, but refused to identify the prospective buyer.
   Media Industry Newsletter reported that sources it did not
identify were saying Reader's Digest Association and American Health
had an agreement in principle for the deal.
   Lipstein said he would neither confirm nor deny the report, and a
spokesman for Reader's Digest Association said his company could not
comment.
   ``We have not made any announcement, and we can't discuss any
subject that has not been announced,'' said spokesman Bruce S.
Trachtenberg from company headquarters in Pleasantville.
   As a private company, he said Reader's Digest usually doesn't
comment on its business plans. He noted the company is currently
operating under added regulatory constraints because it is preparing
to file registration material that will enable some of its
shareholders to offer non-voting stock to the public for the first
time. The filing is expected by early 1990.
   American Health magazine is published 10 times a year and has
seen both circulation and advertising pages rise this year.
   ``It's doing very well,'' said Lipstein, a founder of the
magazine and the largest stockholder in the partnership that owns it.
   He said American Health's ad pages have risen 12.4 percent this
year from a year ago and circulation is up 10 percent to an all-time
high of 1.048 million.
   Lipstein is also involved in separate partnerships that own
Mother Earth News, Psychology Today and Smart magazines, but said
these were not for sale.
   Reader's Digest Association has been publishing Reader's Digest
for nearly 68 years and in the past three years has acquired three
special interest magazines: Travel-Holiday, The Family Handyman and
New Choices for The Best Years, which had formerly been called
50-Plus.
   Reader's Digest also publishes general and condensed books and
produces and markets by direct mail a variety of home entertainment
products including compact discs, tapes, records and home videos.
   In an announcement Wednesday, the company said it was creating
three new business groups and named presidents for each of them.
   George V. Grune, chairman and chief executive, said the
realignment was part of a ``continuing growth strategy ... designed
to maximize our position as a leader in the global publishing and
direct mail industries.''
   Two of the executives come from within the organization. M. John
Bohane, who has been with the company since 1971, becomes president
of the new direct marketing group, and Kenneth A. Gordon, a 29-year
veteran, was picked to head the new international group.
   Bohane, 53, had been vice president and director of U.S.
marketing for Reader's Digest Association and in the new post will
be responsible for domestic direct mail activities for book, music
and home video products and financial services.
   Gordon, 52, had been vice president and director for
international operations and will oversee Reader's Digest activities
outside the United States.
   Thomas A. Kenney, 42, who has more than 15 years in the magazine
field for companies including Time Warner Inc. and CBS Inc., becomes
president of the new magazine publishing group with responsibility
for all four magazines and the QSP subsidiary, which helps schools
and youth organizations with fundraising.
   Since 1986, Kenney has headed his own firm that has served as an
adviser on media deals to the investment banking firm First Boston
Corp.

<HEAD>Chrysler's Lutz: Plant Closings Looming</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Ford-Europe, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>HIGHLAND PARK, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Another round of auto plant closings
is looming for the 1990s, but nothing should happen in the next year
despite an expected drop in vehicle sales, a Chrysler Corp.
executive says.
   ``There absolutely will be more plant closings in the United
States,'' Robert Lutz, president of Chrysler Motors Corp., said
Wednesday. ``If over a period of time market demand is insufficient,
then we would be forced to realign capacity.''
   Lutz, president of Chrysler's vehicle-making arm, predicted that
14.2 million vehicles _ 9.4 million cars and 4.8 million light
trucks _ will be sold in 1990. That will be down 4 percent to 5
percent from 1989 sales and 10.1 percent below the 15.8 million
vehicles sold in 1988, the second-best year in automotive history.
   Chrysler, the No. 3 U.S. carmaker, closed its Kenosha, Wis.,
assembly plant last year. Last week, General Motors Corp. announced
it would shut its Lakewood, Ga., assembly plant in March. Ford Motor
Co. hasn't recently announced any plant closings.
   ``Over the '90s, the market is not going to grow sufficiently to
absorb all the capacity,'' Lutz said.
   A large percentage of the new U.S. automaking capacity in recent
years has come from ``transplants,'' or foreign-based companies
operating assembly plants in the United States.
   Recently, Nissan Motor Corp. of Japan increased capacity at its
Smyrna, Tenn., plant; Chrysler and Mitsubishi Motors Corp. of Japan
began production at their joint-venture plant in Illinois; a
cooperative venture between GM and Suzuki Motor Co. Ltd. of Japan
opened in Canada; and Hyundai Motor Co. of Korea began operating in
Canada.
   Honda Motor Co. begins production at a second U.S. plant later
this year in East Liberty, Ohio, and Isuzu Motors Ltd. and Fuji
Heavy Industries Ltd. join together for production later this year
at Lafayette, Ind. All three companies are Japanese.
   All that adds up to a lot more production capacity for cars and
trucks.
   Chrysler is using less than 30 percent of the capacity at its
Bramalea, Ontario, plant but that will rise next year when the
company begins building a new Dodge Monaco, derived from the Eagle
Premier it assembles there now.
   On other matters raised Wednesday as Chrysler wound up its 1990
model introduction, Lutz said:
   _The 2,300 white-collar jobs Chrysler tagged for extinction in a
$1 billion cost-cutting program should be gone by the end of the
year, as expected.
   _The minivan market segment will continue to grow. Chrysler's
dominant 56 percent share will slip a little, mainly because of the
entry of new minivans, including those from GM and Mazda Motor Corp.
of Japan.
   _Chrysler's 5 percent average price increase for 1990 cars and
trucks was due mainly to the company's decision to put driver-side
air bags on all of its U.S.-made cars to meet federal safety
standards.

<HEAD>Amerada Hess Confirms Refinery Damage from Hurricane</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JULIA C. MARTINEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Amerada Hess Corp. has confirmed that its big St.
Croix refinery sustained major hurricane damage and will not resume
full operations for about 60 days.
   The company said in a statement after the markets closed
Wednesday that ``there had been considerable damage to the plant and
to its administrative buildings and employees' housing.''
   The New York company said the refinery, with a capacity of
545,000 barrels a day, would resume partial operations in about 30
days. The refinery supplies markets in the eastern United States and
the Gulf of Mexico.
   Reports that there might be major problems at the refinery sent
gasoline futures surging Wednesday on the New York Mercantile
Exchange.
   The October contract for unleaded gasoline closed 2.07 cents
higher at 59.74 cents a gallon after trading as high as 60.20 cents.
Heating oil for October delivery jumped 1.60 cents to 56.55 cents a
gallon. Other contract months also had strong gains.
   An Amerada spokesman said the refinery had been shut down
Saturday in preparation for Hurricane Hugo. The refinery had been
producing about 400,000 barrels a day of gasoline, distillates and
other products, most of which are used in the United States, said
the official, who asked that his name not be used.
   He said Amerada officials traveled to the U.S. Virgin Islands to
inspect the refinery earlier in the week but that damage from the
hurricane made communication out of St. Croix difficult.
   Amerada said despite the shutdown it planned to maintain ``normal
sales arrangements with all of its customers on the mainland of the
United States.''
   Traders said the strength in product prices helped buoy crude oil
prices. The October contract for West Texas Intermediate, the
benchmark grade of U.S. crude oil, rose 8 cents to close at $19.64 a
42-gallon barrel. November crude rose 29 cents to $19.68 and
December jumped 32 cents to $19.46 a barrel.
   Energy analysts said the small gains in October crude on the last
trading day of the contract reflected the market's belief that it
was oversold.
   ``Buyers decided they can't justify paying the price,'' said Bob
Baker, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   Traders said the market started out relatively calm until
gasoline prices surged early in the day on word that Amerada Hess
was buying large amounts of oil and gasoline in New York and Gulf of
Mexico markets to make up for the shortfall from St. Croix.
   But some analysts said they were surprised by the strong buying
activity given the recent buildup of inventories, particularly
gasoline.
   ``It's hard to see why we had this kind of move,'' Baker said.
   The latest weekly report by the American Petroleum Institute
showed gasoline stocks rose 244,000 barrels in the week ended Sept.
15. Distillate stocks rose more than 1.6 million barrels while crude
supplies fell 9.6 million barrels.
   Baker also said a Department of Energy report indicates that the
St. Croix refinery provides only about 50,000 barrels a day of
gasoline to U.S. markets, while the rest of its production is
composed of products such as distillates.

<HEAD>Bush Rejects Colombian Plea on Coffee Quotas</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush has rejected a plea by Colombian
President Virgilio Barco for a 1-year reinstatement of a
coffee-export quota system that had been beneficial to Colombian
farmers, the White House said.
   Colombian coffee prices have fallen sharply since the 74-nation
International Coffee Agreement _ to which both the United States and
Colombia belonged _ collapsed in July after the United States pulled
out in a dispute over prices with coffee-producing nations.
   Barco, whose nation relies on coffee as a major source of export
earnings, had appealed to Bush to reconsider the coffee decision and
to support reinstating the quotas for at least one year. But the
White House said Wednesday that the decision would stand.
   Colombia's coffee earnings have slumped at the same time that the
Bush administration is seeking Barco's help in cracking down on
cocaine exports.
   Colombian officials have suggested they will have an even harder
time persuading hard-pressed Colombian farmers to grow coffee
instead of coca if coffee export prices continue to slip.
   The agreement set quotas for member nations' exports aimed at
suporting prices of beans at $1.20 per pound or more. Some Central
American nations and others, supported by the United States, wanted
larger quotas.
   After suspension of the quotas in early July, prices fell quickly
to about 85 cents a pound. Colombia has said this will cost $500
million a year in export revenue.
   Bush, in a letter to Barco, said the United States was ready to
negotiate for a new quota system but was unwilling to adhere to the
now-defunct agreement, presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater
said.
   Fitzwater said Bush's letter was one ``expressing appreciation of
the importance of coffee to the economies of Colombia and other
developing countries.''
   The letter, Fitzwater continued, ``expressed his (Bush's)
disappointment that the members of the ICA were unable to settle ...
two fundamental problems.''
   The United States wanted an increase in export quotas for
higher-quality coffees enjoyed by U.S. consumers, and tough
penalties against countries secretly selling coffee surpluses to
Eastern bloc nations at prices below those charged the United States.
   ``President Bush expresses his confidence that a lasting solution
which is acceptable to other major members and respects market
trends can be found,'' Fitzwater said.
   Bush's letter may have opened the way for negotiations on
restoring coffee export quotas, a Colombian representative said.
   While Bush rejected Barco's plea, he also said the United States
was prepared to resume discussions on quotas at any time.
   Possibilities for restoring the International Coffee
Organization's export quota system may be explored next week at a
week-long session of the 74-member group.
   ``The aim will be to maintain the momentum towards an economic
agreement for coffee that brings back export quotas,'' Nestor
Osorio, Colombia's permanent coffee organization delegate, said in
London.
   ``The council will look at the market situation and could set a
timetable for negotiations,'' he added.
   Coffee prices have dropped by more than 30 percent since the ICO
export quota system was suspended on July 4, and prices touched a
14-year low of less than 67 cents per pound last month. Allowing for
inflation, coffee is now at its lowest level since the 1920s.

<HEAD>Mosbacher Remains for Talks To Build Business Confidence</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DRUSILLA MENAKER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher
has signed investment and tourism agreements and extended his stay
to negotiate a pact to persuade American companies to do business in
the new Poland.
   The proposed accord would address the concerns of U.S. companies
considering investing in the economically and politically volatile
country, which has the East bloc's only non-communist-led government.
   Mosbacher and Polish Foreign Trade Minister Marcin Swiecicki are
discussing how far the new government is willing to go to increase
Western investment through a series of favorable agreements.
   The pacts would address removing profits from Poland, offer
guarantees against expropriation of property, protect technology,
patents and other intellectual property, and govern taxation.
   ``I think this will add confidence and comfort and a level of
excitement for American businesses and bring more ... to invest in
Poland,'' Mosbacher said Wednesday.
   Mosbacher's visit, which he extended by a day until today, comes
as Poles are looking to the West for support of the new government's
efforts to dismantle four decades of communist rule amid what
Solidarity Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki calls ``economic
chaos.''
   In Washington, Democrats contending the Bush administration is
failing to back the reforms have proposed a $1.8 billion aid plan
that would dwarf a $100 million package offered so far by the White
House.
   Neither the comprehensive ``Business and Economic Agreement''
under discussion nor the agreements signed Wednesday has any
significant cost to the U.S. government, Mosbacher said.
   But they do represent a largely unprecedented encouragement of
U.S. commerce with a communist country in transition.
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa met with Mosbacher in Gdansk on
Wednesday and said it will likely be some time before the benefits
of investment are felt.
   ``The Americans propose that Poland reduce inflation first and
then they will provide us with some specific help,'' he said.
   ``I think I managed to persuade (Mosbacher) that it should be the
other way around because I am sure that without this help we will
not make it,'' Walesa said. ``It would be a vicious circle.''
   Mosbacher and Swiecicki, one of four remaining communist cabinet
members, signed an agreement to foster contact between American
business and the developing private sector in Poland.
   Under the pact, business experts will be brought to Poland and
management training programs will be developed for an economy in
which companies have been run by a centralized bureaucracy.
   The other agreement is to improve tourism and expand
opportunities for U.S. investment in hotels and other travel
projects in Poland.
   Mosbacher stayed at the Marriott Hotel, expected to open next
month in a skyscraper that was unfinished most of the decade due to
lack of funds. The project is considered a prime example and key
test of the potential for U.S. investment.
   Tourists now have legal access to a more favorable exchange rate
that had been only available only on the black market until currency
laws were changed earlier in the year.
   But they still are required to exchange set amounts and pay for
lodging and other services at the lower ``official'' exchange rate.
   A series of programs now before the U.S. Congress include a $100
million fund to promote development of private firms in Poland and
the rewriting of tariff laws to allow 4,100 products to be imported
to the United States without tariffs.
   About $70 million of current Polish exports would be covered,
including furniture and light machinery.

   Wage and price projections point toward increased
productivity by salaried workers in 1990, according to a private
study that found salary increases lagging behind inflation this year.
   The survey of 1,260 businesses indicates the companies plan to
give slightly bigger raises next year while inflation is expected to
ease a bit.
   With higher compensation costs in an atmosphere of greater price
restraint, employers will likely demand more from their employees,
said Eddie Smith, an executive with Hewitt Associates, which
released its study Wednesday.
   Hewitt, a compensation consulting firm based in suburban
Lincolnshire, asked a cross-section of U.S. businesses how much they
increased their budgets for salaries in 1989 and how much more they
expected to budget in 1990.
   The companies projected increases averaging 5.4 percent next year
while the Bush administration is projecting an increase of 4.2
percent in a consumer price index that tracks the prices of goods
and services bought by urban wage earners and clerical workers.
   Those projections compare with salary increases averaging 5.3
percent this year while inflation for wage earners and clerical
workers is running at an annualized rate of 5.1 percent through
August, according to the Labor Department.
   The increased income taxes on the 5.3 percent raises will more
than offset the apparent edge over inflation, so salaried workers
will actually lose some purchasing power this year for the second
year in a row, Smith said.
   The loss of spending power is ``small, but significant,'' he said.
   ``It's more of a statistical concept than something the average
person is going to feel. But if it continues over time, you're going
to feel it.''
   The projected loss of purchasing power extends a pattern
established in 1988, the first year this decade in which inflation
outstripped the average rise in salaried workers' take-home pay,
Smith said.
   The survey did not include wage increases for union workers, who
comprise 16.8 percent of the work force, according to Labor
Department figures.
   On the brighter side, Smith said an increasing number of
companies are shifting compensation dollars to bonus plans or other
incentive programs that reward salaried employees for achieving
stated goals.
   ``For a large number of salaried workers there is a second source
of earnings,'' he said.
   The Consumer Price Index used in Hewitt's study, known as CPI-W,
is a narrower indicator of inflation than the more widely cited
CPI-U index, which tracks the prices of products purchased by all
urban consumers, not just wage earners and clerical workers.
   The Labor Department's CPI-U index shows inflation running at an
annualized rate of 4.8 percent through August.
   The salary increases in Hewitt's study are substantially greater
than those reported by the Labor Department for wage and salary
earners in private industry because the government's numbers include
hourly and union workers, whose raises are typically smaller than
those of salaried workers.
   The Labor Department said wages for those workers rose 3.3
percent in 1987, 4.1 percent in 1988 and 4.1 percent through August
of this year.

   West Coast retailers have fared better than their
East Coast rivals this year and sales at chain stores in oil-patch
states have grown faster than elsewhere in the country, according to
a new report.
   Department stores and discounters in the El Paso, Texas,
metropolitan area posted the best sales gain for the first half of
1989 while Akron, Ohio retailers suffered the worst decline.
   These were among the findings in a regional retail sales report
based on results from 6,000 stores, with at least 25 employees each,
in the 125 largest U.S. metropolitan areas. The stores account for
$110 billion in annual sales.
   The retailers, which regularly submit sales figures to the U.S.
Census Bureau, include such national chains as Sears, Roebuck and
Co., K mart Corp. and J.C. Penney Co. Inc., mass merchants and
department stores.
   Using data collected by the Census Bureau, the International
Council of Shopping Centers is compiling a new monthly report that
complements other government retail sales publications. The premier
issue, released Wednesday, covered sales for June and the first 6
months of 1989.
   Ike Lagnado, director of research for the shopping center trade
group, said the report indicates a region's health because consumer
spending at general merchandise stores is a key element of economic
activity.
   Nationwide, consumer spending accounts for about two-thirds of
economic activity.
   Walter Loeb, a retail industry analyst at Morgan Stanley &amp; Co.,
said at a news conference that the new reports will help analysts
determine store traffic trends and sales momentum, which are crucial
factors in assessing a retailer's prospects.
   According to the report for January through June, the West South
Central or ``oil patch'' area of the country, including parts of
Texas, Louisana, Arkansas and Oklahoma, had a sales gain of 11.2
percent for the first half from the corresponding 1988 period.
   The increase was by far the best of any region and compared with
a national median increase of 4.5 percent.
   ``Since the oil-dominated economies have suffered through an
extended widespread economic contraction, a recent turnaround has
apparently been sufficient to usher in a wave of consumer
spending,'' the report read.
   The West had a 6.3 percent sales gain in the first half of 1989.
On the East Coast, the south Atlantic states showed a growth rate of
only 1.3 percent and the New England states trailed all other
divisions within geographic regions, with a 2.6 percent drop in
sales.
   In the Midwest, the report said department store sales rose 4.3
percent in the first six months of the year from a year earlier but
accelerated in the second quarter, posting a rise of 5.3 percent.
   Among specific metropolitan areas El Paso had a sales rise of
18.7 percent in the first half of 1989 to lead gainers, while Akron
sales fell by 8 percent to lead the decliners.

<HEAD>Senate Panel Approves Bill Reauthorizing SEC</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Senate panel has passed legislation that
would increase Securities and Exchange Commission funding by $70
million over the next two years and lift salary caps for SEC
staffers.
   The Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee approved
a package of SEC-realted legislation without amendements and little
discussion on Wednesday.
   In addition to increasing the SEC's budget for 1990 and 1991, the
proposed package would let the SEC lift caps on employee salary,
especially crucial entry level staff attorney posts.
   Most other federal financial regulators were given that authority
by the savings and loan bailout bill passed earlier this year.
   At his confirmation hearing before the same committee last week,
Richard Breeden, the Bush administration's nominee for the SEC
chairmanship, said raising staff pay was one of his top priorities.
   ``We don't want a thrift crisis in the securities markets,'' said
Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., chairman of the subcommittee that
drew up the legislation.
   Noting the high turnover rate caused by salaries that are not
competitive with the private sector, Dodd added: ``We simply must
have an agency that has the funds and expert staff to keep our
markets clean and keep them sound.''
   The legislative package must still clear the Senate
Appropriations Committee and the full Senate and House.
   ``The passage of these bills as well as the lifting of the pay
caps at the SEC is long overdue,'' said Sen. Donald W. Riegle Jr.,
the committee chairman. ``I do not anticipate any difficulties
enacting this legislation into law,'' the Michigan Democrat added.
   The packages also calls for action that would:
   _bolster the SEC's ability to fight international fraud by
allowing the commission to guarantee the confidentiality of
documents provided by foreign regulators in SEC probes;
   _extend to mutual fund shareholders, the protection of the
shareholder communications act, which equires banks and brokers to
notify shareholders about proxy materials and other documents not
sent directly to the individual;
   _streamline the law regulating the disclosure language for the
issuance of corporate bonds.
   The package of four bills was passed by voice vote with little
discussion.
   Under the SEC reauthorization bill, the agency which oversees the
stock and bond markets, stock exchanges and other aspects of the
securities industry, would get $178 million for 1990 and $212.6
million for the following year.
   By contrast, the SEC budget for 1989 was $142.6 million.
   Dodd said it may be the panel's ``most important single task'' in
the securities field.
   ``We can pass countless laws against insider trading or market
abuses, but we need an expert agency to administer and enforce those
laws,'' he added.

<HEAD>Former Heileman Chief Discouraged by Company's Troubles</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The former head of G. Heileman Brewing Co. says
he is discouraged by the company's troubles since it was acquired by
Australian Alan Bond, but he declined to speculate whether the
country's fifth-largest brewer might be sold again.
   ``It's unfortunate,'' Russell Cleary said in a telephone
interview from La Crosse, Wis., where Heileman is based. ``I
certainly hope they get their act straightened out for the sake of
the employees.''
   Cleary said he would not speculate on whether Heileman might be
sold. A spokesman for Heileman referred calls to Bond's headquarters
in Australia, but officials there could not be reached for comment.
   ``It's a tough business and he has an enormous amount of debt,''
Cleary said. ``We didn't have that debt.''
   Through a series of acquisitions, Cleary built Heileman into a
national power before it was bought by Bond in 1987 for about $1.3
billion.
   But the purchase of Heileman has contributed to Bond's mounting
debts, which reportedly exceed $4 billion. On Tuesday, Bond
announced he was selling half of his brewery empire to New Zealand's
Lion Nathan Ltd., for more than $760 million.
   Under the transaction, Lion Nathan will buy a 50 percent interest
in and management of Bond Corp.'s Swan, Tooheys and Castlemaine
breweries in Australia, and the group's hotel and associated liquor
interests.
   Bond said in a statement that the brewery deal was ``another
positive step in the restructuring and strategic refocusing'' of his
group. He said it would create a ``formidable brewing alliance'' in
the region, aimed at the Pacific as well as Asia.
   Under the proposal, the brewing assets will be folded into a new
joint venture company, Australian Breweries Pty. Ltd., equally owned
by Bond Corp. and Lion Nathan.
   Bond deferred for 12 months any decision to part with Heileman.
   Analysts say, however, Bond is bound to lose money whether he
sells Heileman or decides to keep it.
   ``Heileman today is to some extent painted in a corner,'' said
Robert Weinberg, a professor of marketing management at Washington
University in St. Louis.
   ``The question is whether you operate it and bleed a little or
take a big hit and move on,'' said John Collopy, an industry analyst
and chairman of the Milwaukee investment firm Cleary Gull Reiland
McDevitt &amp; Collopy Inc.
   While the overall beer market has stagnated, Heileman's share has
eroded, falling from a high of 9.4 percent in 1983 to a current
level of about 7 percent. Industry observers say Heileman was worth
far below $1.3 billion when it was sold, and Bond would have a hard
time finding a buyer.
   ``You're not getting anyone to pay $1.3 billion for the
breweries,'' said Ben Steinman, associate publisher of Beer
Marketer's Insights, an industry newsletter.
   Analysts point out that Heileman's sales started to slip before
the company was sold, but Cleary was able to keep the company
efficient and profitable.
   ``His helmsmanship helped hold it together better than anyone
could,'' Collopy said. ``When you lose that, the underlying softness
got exaggerated.''

<HEAD>Government Clears Hoylake's Offer For BAT</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government today cleared Hoylake Investment
Ltd.'s $21 billion bid for the British conglomerate BAT Industries
PLC.
   The decision follows last week's ruling by the Panel on Takeovers
and Mergers allowing Hoylake to suspend its all-paper bid until it
resolves regulatory problems with state insurance commissioners in
the United States.
   Thursday's approval came in the form of a decision by Trade
Secretary Nicholas Ridley not to refer the bid to the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission.
   However, the notice from Ridley said the matter could be
reconsidered if there is a ``material change'' in the terms of the
bid or other ``material facts.''
   BAT shares were up the equivalent of 11 cents at $12.96 on the
London Stock Exchange Thursday morning.
   Hoylake, an investors group led by the Anglo-French financier Sir
James Goldsmith, offered $13.87 worth of securitie for each BAT
share.
   BAT said it regretted Ridley's decision.
   The British conglomerate, comprising holdings in tobacco, paper,
retailing and financial services, said a referral to the monopolies
commission ``would've provided an opportunity for the government to
establish a coherent policy on the controversial question of highly
leveraged bids for major companies using junk bonds, with their
negative potential for the markets, for companies and for small
shareholders.''
   BAT Chairman Patrick Sheehy said ``seeing off'' Hoylake remained
the company's first priority.
   ``We are continuing our strategic review in light of the historic
undervaluation of our shares,'' he noted, adding that the company
was determined to ``take suitable measures to provide a sustainable
long-term increase'' in shareholder value.
   Hoylake had requested that the takeover panel grant it a
lengthier bid timetable because of the need to secure approval from
the U.S. state insurance commissioners for a change in ownership of
BAT's Farmers Insurance Group Inc. of Los Angeles.
   BAT last week appealed the takeover panel's decision allowing
Hoylake to renew its offer for BAT within 21 days of overcoming its
regulatory obstacles in the United States.
   Normally in Britain, a bidder is given 90 days to win a majority
stake in its target. If the bidder fails, he must wait at least a
year before bidding again.

   Pan Am is being fined $630,000 for alleged
security breaches mainly involving its flight that blew up over
Scotland, but federal aviation officials say the violations did not
lead to the bombing.
   The Federal Aviation Administration announced the fines involving
the Dec. 21 flight on Wednesday, giving the airline 30 days to pay
or appeal.
   The action came as the House of Representatives, prompted by the
Pan Am bombing and another apparent airliner bombing over Northern
Africa on Tuesday, passed a bill to bolster international aviation
security.
   The FAA fine covers charges of improper screening of passengers
and cargo boarding Flight 103 at West Germany's Frankfurt and
London's Heathrow airports, as well as five other European flights
within a few days after the bombing.
   The agency said its letter announcing the fines to Pan Am
``contained no allegations that any of the violations contributed to
the Flight 103 tragedy.'' All 259 people aboard the flight were
killed, as well as 11 on the ground in Lockerbie, Scotland.
   The FAA said all of the problems cited in the accusations have
been corrected.
   Pan Am chairman Thomas G. Plaskett called the alleged security
lapses ``administrative rather than substantive'' and also said they
did not contribute to the bombing.
   ``There is no evidence that any of the items noted in the ...
inspection by the FAA were in any way related to the bombing of our
aircraft last December,'' said Plaskett.
   Investigators are still trying to determine who planted plastic
explosives in a radio-cassette player found in debris from the
Boeing 747's cargo hold.
   The fines came as a team of U.S. investigators was setting out
for Niger in Northern Africa to look into the crash of a DC-10 en
route from N'Djamena, Chad, to Paris. The French airline UTA said a
bomb apparently downed its plane carrying 170 people.
   A spokesman for Pan Am Flight 103 victims' relatives, Bert
Ammerman, reacted to the fines by saying the government, not
airlines, should be responsible for aviation security. The relatives
have called for a federal investigation into the bombing.
   Sen. James Exon, D-Neb., praised the FAA action, saying the fines
would ``serve notice not only on Pan Am but all other airlines that
we are going to be insistent on not only proper maintenance of the
aircraft but proper screening of passengers and baggage that goes on
airplanes today.''
   The House on Wednesday passed a bill that would have the
government pay $270 million for modern weapons-detection equipment
at many U.S. and foreign airports. The Transportation Department has
ordered airliners to install and pay for the devices.
   The legislation, approved 392-31, also would require for the
first time that commuter airlines screen passengers and luggage,
require airlines to acknowledge that they have received FAA warnings
of possible security threats, and urge agreements with other
countries to require detectable chemicals in plastic explosives.
   The FAA accused Pan Am of failing to properly check 31 passengers
at Heathrow airport and another five at Frankfurt, where the flight
to New York originated.
   Other violations were cited in the handling of passengers or
cargo for three other flights from London and two from Frankfurt
within three days after the bombing of the Boeing jumbo jet.
   In some cases in which passengers were identified for further
checks, hand-held metal detectors were used on their carry-on
luggage rather than having it opened for physical inspection as
required, the FAA said.
   Pan Am said in May that all passengers and cargo boarding Flight
103 were thoroughly inspected. The airline said the allegations of
security lapses ``appear to be based on a misunderstanding of Pan
Am's procedures.''
   A New York lawyer who handles aviation cases, James Stengel, said
that despite the FAA's failure to connect the lapses with the
bombing, the fine might still be used by plaintiffs as evidence in
support of suits against Pan Am. He said it could support
allegations that Pan Am was not meeting all of its security
responsibilities at the time of the incident.
   Another aviation lawyer, Keith Gerrard of Seattle, said he
thought the FAA fines would be excluded as prejudicial evidence in
liability cases since the government has not concluded that the
violations contributed to the bombing.

   A congressional subcommittee investigating
the generic drug industry has asked Eli Lilly &amp; Co. to hand over
several documents within two weeks.
   Rep. John D. Dingell, D-Mich., sent a letter Tuesday to Lilly
Chairman Richard D. Wood in which he said an inspection report by
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration made public last week
``confirmed that callous and cavalier business practices were
commonplace in your Indianapolis plant.''
   Dingell chairs the subcommittee on oversight and investigations
of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, which has been
investigating production problems and illegal payments in the
generic drug industry and the FDA's approval process for generic
drugs.
   Generic drugs are copies of brand name products that have lost
their patent protection.
   The subcommittee's request seeks from Lilly copies of documents
dating back to Jan. 1, 1985, and covering Lilly responses to any
inspections of its manufacturing operations; communication to or
from the FDA regarding inspections of manufacturing or research
facilities for drugs produced or sold in this country; and a list of
management personnel at the Indianapolis plant.
   A spokesman for Lilly said the company had not received the
letter.
   The 90-page FDA inspection report addressing Lilly's tablet and
capsule manufacturing facility criticized the company's quality
control, manufacturing and record-keeping procedures.
   In response, Lilly recalled 18 lots of 10 products, temporarily
halted all shipments from the Indianapolis plant, and formed an
in-house task force to revamp procedures to meet FDA objections.
   Last week Dingell's subcommittee asked the FDA for the reports of
all Lilly manufacturing plant inspections worldwide since Jan. 1,
1985.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. economy grew at a healthy annual rate
of 2.5 percent from April through June, slightly slower than
previously believed, the government said today.
   In its final look at overall economic activity in the spring, the
Commerce Department said growth in the gross national product was
0.2 percentage point lower than it estimated a month ago
   The small downward revision did nothing to change the view that
the economy was performing remarkably well during the spring,
bolstered by a rebound in consumer spending, strong business
investment and continued double-digit growth in U.S. exports.
   Many economists believe that growth will slow during the second
half of the year. However, the momentum provided by the second
quarter has erased fears that the country was in danger of toppling
into a recession.
   The GNP revision also bore good news for the Federal Reserve
Board's goal of restraining inflation. A price index tied to the GNP
rose at an annual rate of 5 percent from April through June, a bit
lower than the estimate a month ago.
   The overall growth rate of 2.5 percent represented a modest
downward revision from a 2.7 percent rate estimated a month ago.
However, both estimates were well above the inital government
projection, which had put GNP growth at an anemic 1.7 percent rate
in the second quarter.
   Before the first GNP estimate was revised, there was widespread
concern that a year-long effort by the Fed to dampen inflationary
pressures was going to push the country into a recession.
   The GNP is the nation's total output of goods and services and
its braodest measure of economic health.
   In a companion report, the government said after-tax profits of
U.S. corporations fell 7.2 percent in the second quarter, an even
bigger drop than the 5.4 percent drop in after-tax profit estimated
a month ago.
   The Fed reported on Wednesday the economy started the second half
of the year with its growth mixed, ranging from slow to modest from
region to region. Other recent government reports also indicate more
sluggish growth in the months ahead.
   ``I basically see us muddling along'' without falling into a
recession, said Samuel D. Kahan, chief financial eocnomist for
Kleinwort Benson Government Securities Inc. in Chicago.
   ``There'll be a little weakness here, a little there, but nothing
really to collapse us one way or the other,'' he said.
   Nevertheless, the peacetime record of economic expansion appears
likely to reach its seventh year in November.
   On an annual basis, the economy grew at a 3.1 percent annual rate
during the first six months of the year. The administration is
predicting GNP growth of 2.9 percent for all of 1989.
   In contrast to past overly optimistic economic forecasts by the
Reagan administration, the Bush outlook is generally viewed as well
within grasp. Indeed, the GNP will only need to expand at an annual
rate of 2.3 percent in the second half to reach that goal.The
reasons for the modest revision in the second quarter GNP were
slightly smaller levels of government and consumer spending than
estimated a month ago.
   But even with the revisions, consumer spending, which accounts
for two-thirds of all economic activity, rose at a solid annual rate
of 1.9 percent.
   Other areas of strength came from a big 8.6 percent increase in
business spending on investment and a 13.1 percent rise in American
exports, the third consecutive quarter in which exports have climbed
at a doublel-digit rate.
   The various changes left the GNP expanding in the second quarter
at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $4.13 trillion.
   In its report Wednesday, the Fed said inflation continued to ease
over much of the nation as the third quarter got undeway, indicating
the central bank continues to attain its goal of easing inflationary
pressures without slowing the economy so much that it is driven into
a recession.
   The Commerce Department reported Tuesday that consumer inflation
was running at a 4.8 percent annual rate, compared to 4.4 percent
for all of last year.
   Most of the newfound strength in the August GNP revision came in
consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of total economic
activity. Government spending, business investment and U.S. export
sales also provided momentum during the spring.
   But during the summer, consumer spending tapered off except for
automobiles. Analysts believe auto sales, which had been driven by
incentives and fears of steep increases in 1990-model prices, will
slacken in coming months.
   Exports, which also grew strongly during the first half of 1988,
are expected to slow because the rising value of the dollar is
making U.S. goods more expensive overseas.
   ``Capital spending, after being a shining star during the first
half of the year, should ease back a bit,'' Kahan said. ``In terms
of government spending, it's likely to chug along. The housing
market should show a bit more life down the road, but not a lot.''

<HEAD>By The Associated Press</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Texas Air Corp. is discussing the sale of its computer
reservation system to a General Motors Corp. unit in a deal that
could bring the troubled airline concern as much as $400 million,
according to a report published today.
   Unidentified sources cited in the Wall Street Journal confirmed
that negotiations with Electronic Data Systems Corp. were advanced
and that barring a snag, an agreement could be forged within several
weeks.
   A spokesman at Texas Air headquarters in Houston was said to be
unavailable for immediate comment on the Journal report while in
Dallas, EDS spokesman Roger Still said the company does not comment
on speculation.
   Analysts estimated that Texas Air's System One, the third-ranked
computer reservation system in the airline industry, could fetch
between $300 million and $400 million.
   Texas Air has given no indication of what it might do with the
proceeds from any sale.
   Texas Air is facing considerable difficulties. Frank Lorenzo, its
chairman, last month said he may sell an interest in Continental
Airlines, Texas Air's main operating unit. And its Eastern Airlines
unit is in bankruptcy proceedings.
   The Journal noted that the airline industry's computer
reservation system is undergoing its own restructuring. Earlier this
week, Delta Air Lines Inc. disclosed it was discussing merging its
reservation system with PARS, an operation jointly owned by Trans
World Airlines Inc. and NWA Inc.'s Northwest Airlines.
   And AMR Corp.'s Sabre reservation system has been seeking a
partner after the Justice Department quashed its plans to link up
with Delta's system.
   The paper also noted that a System One-EDS combination would mark
the first non-airline owner of a computer reservation system.
   System One has a market share of about 19 percent, according to
the Journal, roughly half that of AMR's Sabre system.
   In addition to the work it performs for GM, EDS is involved in
health insurance, government and financial institution data
processing.

<HEAD>Plans to Trim Excess Cigarette Inventories</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (AP) _ R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. today
announced a plan to cut excess customer-held inventories by the end
of 1989 by reducing domestic cigarette shipments for the rest of the
year.
   The company also will refocus its distribution incentive programs.
   ``In the future, Reynolds Tobacco will better balance its sales
to direct customers with consumer purchases of its products,'' said
James W. Johnston, the company's chairman and chief executive
officer.
   ``We will replace our existing trade incentive programs with a
comprehensive new program that will provide performance-based
financial incentives to our direct customers and assist us in
improving our retail share of the market,'' he said in a news
release.
   Details of the new program, which will become effective Jan. 1,
1990, will be announced to customers in December. The program is
intended to prevent imbalances in what are known as trade
inventories.
   A company spokeswoman, Betsy Annese, said Reynolds Tobacco's
trade inventories are unsold cigarettes held by customers.
   During certain periods of the year, the company offers incentives
to customers to encourage them to buy more cigarettes than they
expect to sell. The practice is a commonly used method in the
consumer goods industry to move products into retail channels.
   Because tobacco industry unit volume is generally reported based
on manufacturer's shipments rather than on actual consumer sales,
the plan will result in a reduction from comparable periods in 1988
of Reynolds Tobacco's reported shipment volume of about 29 percent
for the third quarter and 17 percent for the fourth quarter.
   However, the plan will not have an impact on the company's share
of actual consumer shares, which is expected to decline only
slightly in 1989.
   The plan is expected to reduce operating earnings for Reynolds
Tobacco by about $170 million in the third and the same amount in
the fourth quarter.
   However, it is also expected to have a moderate positive impact
on the company's cash flow for 1989. Reynolds Tobacco expects the
plan to have a positive impact on its financial performance after
1989 because of reduced costs for returned product and increased
manufacturing and sales efficiency.
   ``This is a milestone decision that eliminates a long-standing
problem for our company in a short time,'' Johnston said.
   ``It will ensure fresher, more consistent products for our
customers, provide more efficiency in our planning, production and
distribution and help us build a stronger partnership with our
direct customers. We are also pleased that we can accomplish our
plan without any reduction in staffing,'' he added.
   R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co.'s major brands are Winston, Salem,
Camel, Vantage, Doral, More, NOW, Century and Ritz.

   Agriculture Department economists say rising
incomes and a decline in the attrition rate are reasons the farm
situation is looking up these days.
   Recent surveys show farm bankruptcy filings in 1988 were down 50
percent from 1986, the peak year for the decade, the department's
Economic Research Service said Wednesday in a preliminary report.
   ``Despite the 1980s farm financial crisis, farm numbers fell less
than in preceding decades,'' the report said. ``Farm numbers
declined by 266,600 during 1980-89, compared with 1.7 million in the
1950s, 1 million in the 1960s, and 516,000 in the 1970s.''
   The brief analysis is in a summary of the October issue of
Agricultural Outlook magazine to be issued later this month.
   Greg Gajewski, the magazine's economics editor, said the
summary's account do not portray fully, however, the impact of the
decline in farm numbers during the 1980s.
   ``There were proportionately more of the large, commercial farms
that went out of business in the '80s than in the earlier decades,''
Gajewski said in a telephone interview.
   But the peak of financial stress for farmers, collectively, has
passed, he said. There are still exceptions, including many who are
having problems repaying loans made by the department's Farmers Home
Administration.
   Others with debts to commercial banks and the Farm Credit System
are faring much better than they were a few years ago.
   Gajewski cited a recent American Bankers Association survey of
commercial agricultural banks which showed that 2.8 percent of their
farm borrowers went out of business during the year that ended last
June 30.
   Fifty percent of those quitting business did so because of
``normal attrition'' such as retirement and death, he said.
   In 1986, 6.2 percent of the farms served by the agricultural
banks went out of business. And only 29 percent of those were due to
normal attrition.
   The USDA report said 1989 ``net cash income'' of farmers is still
expected to decline 5 percent to 13 percent from last year's record
of $59.9 billion. That was unchanged from the forecast a month ago.
   Higher expenses associated with larger crop plantings are major
factors in the expected decline in cash income this year. Also,
federal payments to farmers will be lower.
   Net cash income is the amount of gross cash income generated by
farmers during the calendar year minus cash operating expenses. It
includes the sales of inventory stocks build up over previous years.
   Last year's drought helped push up 1988 net cash income as
farmers sold accumulated inventories at higher prices.
   Another measure used by the agency is ``net farm income''
accounting, which measures the value of the current year's
production plus government payments, minus total costs. Allowances
also are made for the value of family dwellings and other factors.
   By this method, net farm income could rise 5 percent to 16
percent this year to a range of $48 billion to $53 billion from
$45.7 billion in 1988, also unchanged from the August forecast.

   Farmers are idling 29.9 million acres under
this year's federal crop programs, little more than half the 54.2
million acres taken from production in 1988, according to the
Agriculture Department.
   The final 1989 contract figures were released Wednesday by the
department's Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service.
The final land-idling figure was up slightly from 29.2 million acres
announced in a preliminary report on May 24.
   To be eligible for price supports and related benefits, farmers
who produce feed grains, wheat, cotton and rice are required to take
a percentage of their base acres from crop production and put the
land in conservation uses that help protect the soil.
   After drought reduced 1988 production, USDA relaxed some of the
idling requirements in order to boost plantings for this year's
harvest.
   Total land idled, or diverted, under the 1989 programs included:
corn, 10.1 million acres; sorghum 2.9 million; barley, 2.2 million;
oats, 300,000; wheat, 9.7 million; cotton, 3.5 million; and rice,
1.2 million.
   The agency report said farmers enrolled 171.2 million acres of
land used to produce feed grains, wheat, cotton and rice in the 1989
program, which represented 77.8 percent of the 220 million acres in
the national base area for those crops. The idled acres are part of
the 171.2 million acres that were enrolled.

<HEAD>Crop Futures Gain on Frost Fears</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Forecasts for freezing temperatures this weekend
in the Midwest gave grain and soybean futures a boost in early
trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Some forecasters expect frost in Minnesota and northern Iowa
Saturday night, with the cold moving into the eastern Corn Belt
Sunday night.
   If frost occurs, it would be about a week ahead of normal.
Analysts said the greatest threat would be to soybeans in Indiana
and Ohio, where crops were planted late due to heavy spring rains.
   In the western Corn Belt, where the crops are more mature, ``I
don't think you're talking about yield losses, I think you're
talking about quality problems,'' said Dale Gustafson, an analyst
with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
   Frost could slow the natural drying of mature corn and lock some
chlorophyll into not-quite-ripe soybeans, causing some
discoloration, Gustafson said.
   In early trading, wheat futures were \ cent lower to { cent
higher with the contract for delivery in December at $3.91{ a
bushel; corn futures were { cent to 1 cent higher with December at
$2.29{ a bushel; oat futures were unchanged to 1 cent higher with
December at $1.40{ a bushel; soybeans were 1} cents to 5{ cents
higher with November at $5.78 a bushel.
   Livestock futures were mostly higher while pork-belly futures
were mostly lower in early trading on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange after bellies soared the 2-cents-a-pound daily limit on
Wednesday.
   Live cattle futures were .05 cent to .40 cent higher with October
at 71.55 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent to .40 cent
higher with September at 83.30 cents a pound; hogs were .45 cent
lower to .35 cent higher with October at 42.12 cents a pound;
frozies were .75 cent lower to 1.40 cents higher with February at 49
cents a pound.
   Cattle futures retreated Wednesday while pork futures advanced.

known to outsiders as the area where border gunners shot down a
Korean Airlines jumbo jet.
   Most foreign investment in the resource-rich, lightly populated
region is still in the startup stage.
   Moscow sees foreign trade and foreign investment as ways to boost
the Soviet economy, although so far no large-scale foreign projects
have been started in the Soviet sector of the booming Pacific Basin.
   Nonetheless, enthusiasm abounds on both sides when the ideas
mesh, and a small projects are envisioned for ventures ranging from
sportfishing to seafood canning to volcano tours.
   ``The key factor is the (Soviet) desire to do business, and it's
there in spades,'' W.K. Nichoson said after signing a preliminary
pact to go into business with the district government in Yuzhno
Sakhalinsk, capital of the island of Sakhalin and the remote Kuril
Islands.
   Nichoson, originally from Long Island, N.Y., but a longtime
resident of Japan, accompanied a group of Tokyo-based journalists on
a recent Soviet-arranged tour to Sakhalin, previously off limits to
foreigners.
   Sakhalin became a household name worldwide six years ago, when
the Soviets shot down a KAL 747 en route from the United States to
South Korea. All 269 people aboard died in an incident that
aggravated East-West tensions.
   Sakhalin also was an area Nichosen knew 35 years ago. Then he was
an electronics officer in the U.S. Air Force flying reconnaissance
missions from Japan and dodging Soviet fighters based on Sakhalin,
he said.
   He has been in business in Japan since leaving the military, and
started his own company, Asia Dynamics (Japan) Ltd., in 1969.
   ``I've been selling things in Tokyo for 30 years, and I'm tired
of selling things in Tokyo,'' said Nichoson, 58, explaining why he
was exploring this new frontier.
   The initial business Nichosen foresees is small _ processing
local wild berries for a health drink and canning high-quality
seafood, both for export. He is pledging $500,000 to be half the
capital of a joint-stock company, with local Soviet government
enterprises putting up the rest in rubles.
   But further down the line, he said, there were possibilities in
tourism, plywood, dairy products and other exportable goods, and the
venture would need ``very large sums from Wall Street investment
bankers.''
   The Soviet Far East is terra incognita now to Wall Street, but
since President Mikhail Gorbachev put the region on the perestroika
course of economic restructuring, business tours have been trickling
through.
   Problems abound: the ruble isn't convertible to foreign currency;
it is hard to repatriate profits; roads, telephones and hotels are
poor; Soviet products often don't meet export standards.
   Worst of all, the Soviets are new to business. But the Soviet Far
East has such rich resources _ fish, forests, minerals, oil, coal _
that a growing number of foriegn businessmen are exploring for
profitable opportunities.
   Some Japanese firms have embarked on deals, even though Tokyo
does not want economic relations to expand before the resolution of
the dispute over Kuril islands captured by Soviet troops in the last
days of World War II.
   Japan insists on the return of the islands, Moscow refuses, and
the issue lies like a tall barricade between big Japanese investors
and the Soviet desire to join the economic boom now enjoyed by many
countries in the Far East.
   Nonetheless, small Japanese-Soviet operations include two
fish-farming joint ventures on Sakhalin, the southern half of which
was owned by Japan until 1945. A Japanese company is taking a 30
percent interest in a project to refurbish a hotel in Yuzhno
Sakhalinsk and participate in management.
   Yoichi Okada is running a Japanese restaurant as a joint venture
with a Soviet enterprise in the Sakhalin port of Holmsk and says
it's already profitable.
   The Kuchiro restaurant, in a nicely trimmed building with a giant
red lantern outside, stands out in drab Holmsk like a peacock in a
piggery. It draws 300 customers a day, Okada said.
   A problem, he said, is how to take out his side's 49 percent of
the profits and convert them to Japanese yen. ``There are ways to do
it, maybe buy fish or go into further enterprises to export fish to
Japan,'' Okada said.
   Perestroika seems to have unleashed a torrent of ``new Soviet
businessmen'' on Sakhalin with sometimes eccentric ideas requiring
foreign money, ties or technology. A geologist wanted to organize
tours of the island's volcanoes. An electronics specialist wanted to
deal in computer technology.
   Ilya Sukharev, a local television producer, is organizing a
cooperative to export art. He said permission came in only three
months. ``I never imagined it could be done in such a short time,''
he said. ``It was a miracle.''
   Two Sakhalin journalists, Vladimir Ardunov and Grigory Kireev,
said their young company is embarking on a deal to develop a resort
on an island in Vietnam and wants foreign expertise.
   One way to exploit the area's bountiful fish is with rod and
reel, preferrably wielded by a hard-currency-spending foreign
anglers. To find out how to please them, the Soviets invited Fishing
The West, of Milwaukie, Ore., to Sakhalin to try the rivers and give
advice.
   Kerry E. Brown of the company said the salmon fishing had been
great, but accommodations and roads were poor. ``The Russians want
to do it right, but they've got a long way to go,'' he said.

   The total cost of an employee-management group's
leveraged buyout of UAL Corp. would be $9.45 billion, according to a
merger agreement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
   The $300-a-share tender offer for the parent company of United
Airlines was to begin today.
   According to the agreement filed with the SEC, the buyout group
will require $6.8 billion to purchase UAL's 22.65 million fully
diluted shares. It said the group may refinance $950 million in
existing UAL debt, which would leave $512 million in long-term debt
and $411 million in capital leases outstanding.
   In addition, there are fees and a $1.3 billion credit facility
for working capital included in the total buyout cost.
   In addition to management personnel and United pilots, the buyout
group includes British Airways PLC as a minority partner.
   The group plans to finance the transaction with $750 million from
British Airways; $200 million in voluntary pension contributions
from the pilots; $1.3 billion from UAL cash reserves and $7.2
billion in bank loans.
   The buyout would give UAL nonmanagement employees 75 percent

   Around midday on the New York Stock Exchange, UAL was up $2.12{

   A federal jury has awarded Monsanto Co. more
than $21 million for an alleged breach of contract by Mobil Oil
Corp. to buy pure phosphorus produced at plants in Idaho and
Tennessee.
   Monsanto contended Mobil violated a five-year agreement to buy
the phosphorus and other products, including detergents and
lubrication additives, at Mobil plants in suburban Cincinnati and
Charleston, S.C.
   A six-member jury in U.S. District Court deliberated two hours
Wednesday before awarding $21,126,557 to Monsanto.
   Mobil contended during the trial, which began Sept. 11, that its
sale of the Ohio and South Carolina plants to Albright &amp; Wilson Inc.
in April 1985 negated the contract with Monsanto.
   ``We obviously disagree with the verdict. It's a complex
commercial case,'' said Richard A. Ahrens, a lawyer for Mobil. He
said Mobil would ask the judge to overturn the verdict or order a
new trial.
   Monsanto produced elemental phosphorus _ the pure, uncombined
chemical element _ at plants in Soda Springs, Idaho, and Columbia,
Tenn.

   Koito Manufacturing Co. said Thursday it will not
give T. Boone Pickens Jr. more power just because he is increasing
his stake in the Japanese auto parts supplier to 26 percent.
   But the company, which Pickens has railed against for repeatedly
refusing him a spot on its board, said the larger ownership by the
American takeover specialist could threaten its position on the
Tokyo Stock Exchange.
   Pickens said Wednesday in Washington that his Boone Co. _ Koito's
largest shareholder _ was buying another 10 million shares above the
32.4 million it currently holds but has no plans to mount a takeover
battle.
   He said he expected to request a special Koito shareholders'
meeting in early October.
   ``We just don't have to allow Pickens to have seats on our board
even though he increases the stake from 20.2 percent to 26
percent,'' Koito spokesman Mikio Tsuruta said. ``There is no such
law.''
   Tsuruta also said Pickens could not request a shareholders
meeting until at least the end of September. To make such a call, a
shareholder must hold more than a 3 percent stake for at least six
months.
   ``We haven't even been notified anything about this from Pickens'
side,'' he said. ``The deal is strictly between Pickens and the
Azabu Group, which has nothing to do with us in the first place.''
   Azabu, a large Japanese car sales and real estate concern, owns
about 10 percent of the shares in Koito, an automobile lighting
company closely associated with Toyota Motor Corp.
   Additional purchases by Pickens could endanger Koito's position
on the Tokyo Stock Exchange's first section, which permits stock
dealing on a credit basis and makes raising capital easier.
   ``How come Pickens has to do this to us? It wouldn't be good for
any of our shareholders, even including Pickens,'' Tsuruta said
about about the danger of falling to the exchange's second section.
   A dealer for Nomura Securities Inc. said Pickens' increased stake
could pressure Koito into a compromise allowing Pickens to name
executives to play a leading role in Koito management.
   Koito would fall from the first section if its top 10
shareholders' total stake exceeds 80 percent. The top group,
including Pickens at 20.2 percent and Toyota at 19 percent, now
holds a total 67 percent stake. Pickens' new purchases would boost
the level to 73 percent.
   In addition, a company is supposed to have at least 3,400
shareholders to qualify for the first section, while Koito now has
3,120, Tsuruta said, who charged that a stake increase by Pickens
would scare off other potential shareholders.
   Noting that Toyota has three representatives on Koito's board,
Pickens said he and Boone Co. have been ``denied our rights because
we are Americans.''
   ``Not only do they want to keep out Americans from participating
in Japan's economy, but they also don't want the Japanese public to
see how their closed corporate structure benefits a few elites to
the detriment of the public,'' he said Wednesday.

   The U.S. dollar finished higher against all major
European currencies in cautious trading Thursday.
   Gold prices were little changed.
   Foreign exchange dealers said trading remained in a narrow range
with players unwilling to take aggressive positions ahead of this
weekend's meeting in Washington of the Group of Seven finance
ministers and central bankers.
   Traders said they weren't expecting any new initiatives out of
the weekend meeting, but they were being cautious in case there was
a communique expressing concern over an excessive rise in the dollar.
   Recent statements by Japanese and West German officials indicated
some concern about the dollar's strength.
   The G-7 nations are the United States, Japan, West Germany,
France, Britain, Italy and Canada.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell 1.25 yen to a closing 145.00 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted at a higher rate of 145.10 yen.
   In London, the dollar gained against the British pound. It cost
$1.5805 to buy one pound, cheaper than $1.5820 late Wednesday.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Wednesday:
1.9435 West German marks, up from 1.9400; 1.6830 Swiss francs, up
from 1.6800; 6.5710 French francs, up from 6.5585; 2.1920 Dutch
guilders, up from 2.1890; 1,401.00 Italian lire, up from 1,399.50;
1.1842 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1824.
   Gold held steady in London at a late bid price of $363.25 a troy
ounce, unchanged from Wednesday's late bid.
   In Zurich, gold also was unchanged at a bid $363.50.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $2.69 to close at a bid $364.11.
   Silver bullion prices rose on the London market where the metal
was trading at a late bid price of $5.14 a troy ounce, compared with
Wednesday's $5.13.

<HEAD>Hoylake Gets British Government Clearance For BAT Bid</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By COTTEN TIMBERLAKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hoylake Investments Ltd. won an important second
round in its takeover battle for BAT Industries PLC Thursday when
the British government cleared the group's $21 billion hostile bid
for the conglomerate.
   Trade Secretary Nicholas Ridley said he would not refer Hoylake's
offer to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, upholding the
Conservative government's free-market policies and sweeping aside
concerns about the advent of giant, highly leveraged, junk
bond-financed buyouts in Britain.
   However, Ridley said, the matter could be reconsidered if there
were a material change in the terms of the bid for BAT or other
``material facts.''
   The decision followed last week's ruling by the Panel on
Takeovers and Mergers giving Hoylake _ which is led by financier Sir
James Goldsmith _ more time for its bid. The offer has been delayed
by regulatory hurdles in the United States.
   BAT stock rose 22 cents to close at $13.07 a share Thursday on
London's Stock Exchange.
   Hoylake is offering $13.87 in securities for each BAT share.
   BAT noted Ridley's decision ``with regret,'' but said it was
pleased the trade secretary left open the possibility of referring
the bid to the mergers commission if its terms were changed.
   BAT said a referral to the monopolies commission would have given
the British government a chance to establish a policy on takeovers
that rely heavily on risky junk bonds.
   Junk bonds have a ``negative potential for the markets, for
companies and for small shareholders,'' BAT said.
   Securities analysts have said Hoylake would have to raise its
offer and include cash to succeed.
   Hoylake wants to retain BAT's tobacco interests and sell its
retailing, financial services and paper and packaging operations.
   BAT Chairman Patrick Sheehy said his company would try to defeat
the Hoylake bid on its merits. He said BAT was determined to ``take
suitable measures to provide a sustainable long-term increase'' in
shareholder value.
   Because Hoylake was formed by Goldsmith, British merchant banker
Jacob Rothschild and Australian entrepreneur Kerry Packer
specifically to make the BAT bid, it was unlikely the offer would be
referred to the monopolies commission on competition grounds, a
common basis for review.
   The bid's opponents have argued for an investigation into whether
the offer is in the public interest, contending that such
highly-leveraged takeovers could strap British companies with debt,
cut down on their investments and distract executives from
day-to-day management.
   Ridley said he based his decision on a recommendation by Director
General of Trading Sir Gordon Borrie, who advised there were no
competitive problems raised by the buyout offer.
   ``In the first instance it must be for the shareholders to
decide,'' Ridley said in an interview on British Broadcasting Corp.
radio. ``I would not wish to interfere in a purely market
situation.''
   Bryan Gould, an opposition Labor lawmaker who serves as his
party's spokesman on trade matters, said, ``This is a triumph of
narrow ideology over the wider interests of British industry.''
   Hoylake requested that the takeover panel grant it a lengthier
bid timetable because of the need to secure approval from U.S. state
insurance commissioners for a change in ownership of BAT's Farmers
Insurance Group Inc., which is based in Los Angeles.
   Insurance regulators in nine states have undertaken reviews of
the deal.
   Hoylake wants to sell Farmers to the French insurance company Axa
Midi Assurances. Goldsmith's group is hoping the move will speed up
U.S. approval for their bid.
   BAT immediately appealed the takeover panel's decision allowing
Hoylake to renew its offer for BAT within 21 days of overcoming its
regulatory obstacles in the United States.
   Normally in Britain, a bidder is given 90 days to win a majority
stake in its target. If the bidder fails, it must wait at least a
year before bidding again.

<HEAD>OPEC Ministers Will Hold Meeting on Contentious Quota Issue</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   OPEC ministers will meet this weekend to
tackle the troublesome issue of how to fairly divvy up
oil-production shares among the 13 nations. Some want much more than
their current allotment.
   But analysts were skeptical the eight-member committee of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries would do much more
than review proposals for reworking output quotas assigned each
member.
   Fergus MacLeod, analyst at the investment firm of Barclays de
Zoete Wedd in London, said he expected ``not very much'' to come out
of the meeting that begins Saturday in Geneva, Switzerland.
   Failure to reach any meaningful conclusion on current production,
however, could be ``very dangerous'' because countries might widen
their oil taps and increase their already high production level, he
said.
   Another analyst, Nick Antill, of London's County NatWest,
predicted the ministers would ``leave the fighting until November''
when all 13 ministers are scheduled to gather for a key year-end
meeting in Vienna.
   ``They will discuss (quotas) but they will take no decision,''
said Pierre Terzian, editor of the oil publication Petrostrategies
in Paris.
   The ministers are at odds over how the cartel divides up and sets
the ceilings for each country's crude output.
   Some countries, like Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, want a
larger share of the production pie. Both have been ignoring their
quotas in recent months and pumping at higher levels.
   Moreover, Iraq just opened the second phase of a twin pipeline
across Saudi Arabia, which will add more than a million barrels a
day to its export capacity. The move increases the likelihood it
will want a higher quota.
   Analysts estimate OPEC's current production at close to 22
million barrels a day, well over the cap of 19.5 million set in June
for the last six months of the year.
   Prices have been lower than earlier in the year. A basket of
seven crudes monitored by OPEC was priced at $17.04 a barrel last
week, under the cartel's target of $18.
   West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. oil, has
been trading in the range of $19.50 to $20 for a 42-gallon barrel.
U.S. crude normally sells for about $2 above the OPEC-monitored
crudes.
   Indonesian Oil Minister Ginandjar Kartasasmita was quoted earlier
this month as saying he was not satisfied with the market's recent
performance.
   ``We have not been able to reach the $18 per barrel price level
that we wanted, except for a few weeks earlier this summer,'' he
told OPECNA, the cartel's news agency.
   At their June conference, the ministers agreed to begin the tough
task of finding a more acceptable way to figure out each country's
take of the cartel's daily output.
   But analysts detected less willingness now _ with higher
production and weaker prices _ to try to solve the problem.
   Nevertheless, they expected OPEC Secretary-General Subroto to put
forth proposals for drawing up quotas that would consider only
oil-related factors. Some members have suggested that quotas take
into account a country's ``need'' for oil revenue as determined by
its foreign debt, balance of payments and population.
   While quotas were likely to grab most of the attention, the
ministers were also expected to decide whether to boost their supply
cap to 20 million barrels a day in the last quarter.
   An OPEC official, who demanded anonymity, said there was ``a
slight possibility'' they would do so.
   ``They may want to narrow the gap between the quota and actual
production,'' said Bahman Karbassioun, an oil consultant in Vienna,
Austria.
   But he said production ``could go even higher'' if countries
failed to agree to abide by their ceilings.
   The International Energy Agency reported in its Monthly Oil
Market Report that the nations lifted output in August to 21.6
million barrels a day, the highest so far this year. The agency is
an arm of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development,
made up of two-dozen Western nations.
   The eight-member Long-term Strategy and Price-Monitoring
Committee includes ministers from Algeria, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq,
Kuwait, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela. The other five nations
_ Gabon, Ecuador, Libya, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates _ were
also invited to attend.
   Saudi Arabia's oil chief, Hisham Nazer, was reported recovering
from surgery earlier this month in the United States and was not
expected to attend.

   PPG Industries Inc. said Thursday it purchased
the Olympic HomeCare Products and Lucite HomeCare Products
subsidiaries from Clorox Co. for $130 million.
   PPG said the acquisition includes headquarters offices in
Bellvue, Wash., and plants in Ballard, Wash.; Batavia, Ill.;

   The stock market responded to fresh evidence of a
slowing economy with a moderate advance today.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 8.93 to 2,692.82 by
3 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 5 to 4 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 754 up, 616 down and
547 unchanged.
   Before the trading day began the Commerce Department reported
that the nation's gross national product grew at an annual rate of
2.5 percent, after adjustment for inflation, in the second quarter
of the year.
   That came as a mild surprise to analysts, who had generally been
expecting no change in the GNP reading from the 2.7 percent
estimated increase the department reported last month.
   The resulting suggestion of a slower-than-expected pace of
business activity prompted a slight decline in open-market interest
rates.
   And brokers said that, in turn, provided a measure of support for
stock prices.
   Chase Manhattan climbed { to 40 in active trading. Wall Streeters
generally upgraded their appraisals of the company's earnings
outlook following its announcement late Wednesday of large writeoffs
on its loans to lesser-developed nations.

<HEAD>Ferranti Plans To Sell $158 Million in Assets</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ferranti International Signal PLC said Thursday it
plans to sell $158 million in assets to reduce its debt and that it
had reached agreement with its creditor banks on a support program.
   The program is to help Ferranti weather any financial
difficulties resulting from losses related to irregularities it
recently discovered in its accounts.
   Ferranti's discovery of possible contract fraud by its Lancaster,
Pa.-based subsidiary International Signal and Control led the
company to seek assurances from its banks they would hold open lines
of credit.
   Ferranti Chairman Derek Alun-Jones announced the latest
developments in a Thursday letter to employees, a copy of which was
obtained by the AP-Dow Jones News Service.
   It said the company ``has now reached agreement with its bankers
by which credit facilities for the company are in place to take it
forward.''
   The letter didn't elaborate on the extent of the credit.
   It said Ferranti was in talks with parties for the sale of about
$158 million, or 100 million British pounds, of ``peripheral''
assets.
   Alun-Jones said Monday that an investigation of contract
irregularities at International Signal and Control suggested that
Ferranti was ``at least misled and possibly made the victim of
serious fraud.''
   But he said these problems affected only a few transactions and
were not connected with other important contracts.
   The Sunday Times of London reported that the company might have
to write off $237 million or more against non-existent contracts for
which the company had previously believed it had been paid.
   The newspaper also reported that International Signal and Control
has been the target of a secret, two-year investigation by the U.S.
Justice Department for allegedly selling arms illegally in the
Middle East and South Africa.
   Trading in Ferranti shares was suspended last week and the annual
shareholders' meeting postponed due to problems with the company's
accounts.
   Ferranti merged with International Signal and Control two years
ago in a $656 million deal.

<TEXT>
   The dollar gained ground against the major
currencies in quiet dealings Thursday.
   Gold prices were unchanged to slightly higher.
   On the New York Commodity Exchange, a troy ounce of gold finished
at $365.50, up 60 cents from Wednesday. Republic National Bank later
quoted a bid of $363.85 for a troy ounce of gold, up 25 cents from
late Wednesday.
   Currency traders continued to square up their positions ahead of
this weekend's meeting in Washington of the Group of Seven finance
ministers and central bankers. The G-7 includes representatives from
the United States, Japan, West Germany, France, Britain, Italy and
Canada.
   Although dealers were divided over whether any new initiatives
would result from the meeting, the underlying sentiment toward the
dollar remained bullish.
   With the Federal Reserve openly intervening throughout the week
to drive the dollar lower, ``one would believe that something will
happen (to push the dollar down), but we're seeing a continued
demand for dollars,'' said Stephen Flanagan, a vice president at
Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co.
   Recent statements by Japanese and West German officials indicated
some concern about the dollar's strength. But at regularly scheduled
meeting of Bundesbank officials Thursday failed to result in an
expected hike in West German interest rates.
   Some traders are anticipating higher West German and Japanese
interest rates in tandem with softer rates in the United States, a
scenario that would depress the dollar.
   ``That would take away the interest-rate differential, which is
sustaining the demand for dollars,'' Flanagan said.
   Separately, the dollar failed to respond to the Commerce
Department's downward revision in the second-quarter gross national
product. The government pegged economic growth at a moderate 2.5
percent during the April-June period.
   ``The technicals are bearish, and you would think the momentum
would be on the downside,'' said Linda McLaughlin, a trader at
Chemical New York Capital Markets Group. ``But it looks like we're
having real difficulty getting the dollar lower.''
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell 1.25 yen to a closing 145.00 yen. Later in London,
it was quoted at a higher rate of 145.10 yen. In New York, the
dollar closed at 145.65 yen, up from 145.10 yen on Wednesday.
   In London, the dollar gained against the British pound. It cost
$1.5805 to buy one pound, cheaper than $1.5820 late Wednesday. In
New York, one pound cost $1.5790, less expensive than Wednesday's
$1.5835.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Wednesday, included: 1.9846 West German marks, up from 1.9397;
1.6835 Swiss francs, up from 1.6815; 6.5740 French francs, up from
6.5560; 1,400.25 Italian lire, up from 1,399.00, and 1.1830 Canadian
dollars, down from 1.1833.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Wednesday,
included: 1.9435 West German marks, up from 1.9400; 1.6830 Swiss
francs, up from 1.6800; 6.5710 French francs, up from 6.5585; 2.1920
Dutch guilders, up from 2.1890; 1,401.00 Italian lire, up from
1,399.50; 1.1842 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1824.
   Gold held steady in London at a late bid price of $363.25 a troy
ounce, unchanged from Wednesday's late bid. In Zurich, gold also was
unchanged at a bid $363.50. Earlier in Hong Kong, gold rose $2.69 to
close at a bid $364.11.
   Silver prices rose. On New York's Comex, silver closed at $5.181
a troy ounce, up from $5.119 on Wednesday. Earlier in London, the
metal was trading at a late bid price of $5.14 a troy ounce,
compared with Wednesday's $5.13.

   Dow Jones &amp; Co. offered Thursday to acquire the
33.8 percent interest in Telerate Inc. that it does not already own
in a deal that values the financial information company at nearly
$1.71 billion.
   In a letter to Telerate President and Chief Executive Officer
Neil Hirsch, Dow Jones said it would begin an $18 a share cash
tender offer for the stake in Telerate now held by the public.
Telerate has approximately 94.9 million outstanding shares.
   Telerate said it appointed a committee of two independent members
of its board to consider the offer and would have no comment pending
evaluation.
   Investors were enthusiastic about the offer, and bid the price of
Telerate stock up $5 to $20.12{ a share in early New York Stock
Exchange trading.
   Dow Jones said it was willing to discuss its offer with Telerate,
an indication that it might increase its bid.
   Telerate supplies computerized financial information to
subscribers that include brokerage houses.
   Dow Jones, which also provides business information services,
publishes newspapers including The Wall Street Journal and Barron's.
   Warren Phillips, the chairman of Dow Jones, said in a statement
his company was seeking full ownership of Telerate ``to obtain
operational efficiencies and to permit even closer and more
efficient working relationships in marketing, customer service and
the management of our related businesses.''

<TEXT>
   Assets of the nation's 466 money market mutual
funds rose $1.30 billion in the latest week to a new all-time high
of $348.98 billion, the Investment Company Institute said Thursday.
   It was the 12th straight week that fund assets reached a new
record and reflected the growing popularity of money market mutual
funds despite a general softening of interest rates.
   The institute, a Washington-based mutual-fund trade group, also
revised upward its week-earlier asset figure to $347.68 billion from
the $347.07 billion first reported, largely because of the addition
of three new funds.
   It said that in the latest week, assets of 230 general purpose
funds rose $1.13 billion to $113.21 billion, assets of 95
broker-dealer funds increased $815.8 million to $151.56 billion, and
assets of 141 institutional funds declined $645.4 million to $84.21
billion.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds fell in
the week ended Tuesday to 8.26 percent from 8.27 percent the
previous week, said Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade journal
based in Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield fell to 8.26 percent from 8.28 percent,
Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was 37
days, up from 36 days, Donoghue's said.
   The newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of 100 leading
commercial banks, savings and loan associations and savings banks in
the nation's 10 largest markets showed the effective annual yield
available on money market accounts unchanged from a week earlier at
6.44 percent.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super NOW
accounts, remained unchanged from a week earlier at 5.10 percent.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 8.24
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, down from 8.25 the
previous week. Yields were 8.29 percent on 1-year CDs, down from
8.30 percent; 8.21 percent on 2{-year CDs, down from 8.22 percent;
and 8.21 percent on 5-year CDs, unchanged.

<HEAD>Grain Futures Rally, Bracing for Freeze</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices rallied strongly Thursday on the
Chicago Board of Trade as the markets braced for the first hard
freeze of the season in the Midwest.
   On other markets, silver futures were sharply higher for the
second consecutive session; energy futures were mixed; and livestock
and meat futures were mixed.
   Wheat futures settled 2 cents to 3 cents higher with the contract
for delivery in December at $3.94} a bushel; corn futures were
unchanged to 3 cents higher with December at $2.31{ a bushel; oats
were 1{ cents to 2 cents higher with December at $1.41{ a bushel;
soybeans were 3 cents lower to 7\ cents higher with November at
$5.82} a bushel.
   The rally was rooted in forecasts for freezing temperatures this
weekend and early next week, possibly reaching as far south as
northern Arkansas and Tennessee.
   ``This is record-breaking or near-record-breaking type cold
coming in,'' said Charles Notis of Freese-Notis Weather Inc., a
private forecasting firm in Des Moines, Iowa.
   Most corn and soybean crops west of the Mississippi River and in
Illinois have matured beyond the danger stage. But the crops in
other Midwestern states east of the Mississippi _ especially
soybeans _ are susceptible to freeze damage.
   Notis estimated that 500 million bushels of soybeans, a little
less than a quarter of the crop, were still vulnerable to frost
damage and that 45 million to 70 million bushels could be hurt by
the arctic high pressure system sweeping down from northwestern
Canada.
   Most of that damage is likely to occur in Indiana and Ohio, he
said.
   In the western Corn Belt, where the crops are more mature, ``I
don't think you're talking about yield losses, I think you're
talking about quality problems,'' said Dale Gustafson, an analyst
with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
   Frost could slow the natural drying of mature corn and lock some
chlorophyll into not-quite-ripe soybeans, causing some
discoloration, Gustafson said.
   Dennis Michelsen, a meteorologist with Murray &amp; Trettl Inc. of
Northfield, Ill., predicted a less-severe freeze than Notis.
   Still, he said, ``I would expect to see a killing frost over a
great portion of the upper Midwest by early next week. We've got
quite a cold snap here.''
   Silver futures scooted up sharply on New York's Commodity
Exchange as the dollar weakened but gold futures made only slight
gains, held back by the oil market's lackluster showing.
   Gold settled 10 cents to 60 cents higher with October at $366.30
a troy ounce; silver was 6 cents to 6.4 cents higher with September
at $5.181 a troy ounce.
   Crude-oil futures were narrowly mixed on the New York Mercantile
Exchange but near-month gasoline and heating-oil futures rose

<HEAD>Money Supply Grew In Latest Week</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The two broadest measures of the nation's money
supply rose in the week ended Sept. 11, the Federal Reserve Board
reported Thursday.
   The Fed said the measure known as M2 rose to a seasonally
adjusted $3,153.9 billion from $3,142.0 billion the previous week.
   An even broader measure, M3, rose to a seasonally adjusted
$4,017.8 billion from $4,007.3 billion.
   The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, rose to a
seasonally adjusted $782.1 billion from $774.7 billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply
measures.
   For the latest 13 weeks, M2 averaged $3,122.5 billion, a 5.8
percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous 13
weeks. M3 averaged $4,001.5 billion, up 4.4 percent, while M1 fell
1.4 percent to an average of $776.1 billion.
   In other reports:
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported commercial and
industrial loans at major New York City banks fell $6.95 billion,
compared with a rise of $1.46 billion a week earlier.
   _The Federal Reserve said bank borrowings from the Federal
Reserve System at the discount window, excluding extended credit,
averaged $723 million a day in the week ended Wednesday, up from
$461 million the previous week.
   _The Federal Reserve said net free reserves averaged $487 million
in the two weeks ended Sept. 20, up from a revised $431 million in
the previous two-week period. The previous period's average
originally was reported as $483 million.
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that the monetary
base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank reserves held at
Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and in circulation,
was $292.8 billion in the two-week period ended Sept. 20 up from
$289.8 billion two weeks earlier.

   Immunex Corp. on Thursday announced a plan that
will transform it from a research-dominated firm in medical
biotechnology into a conventional pharmaceutical company.
   The 8-year-old company, based in Seattle, said it would achieve
the transition primarily by reacquiring rights to sell
Immunex-developed products in the United States. In return, its
business partners will get rights to some other Immunex products,
primarily for overseas distribution.
   Immunex's plan will require the company to build a sales staff
from scratch, but it should permit it to keep more of the profits
from its work, said Joseph Edelman, an analyst at Labe, Simpson &amp; Co.
   ``Overall, I think it's an aggressive strategy,'' Edelman said.
   In over-the-counter trading Thursday, Immunex stock fell 50 cents
to $16.50.
   Immunex uses gene-splicing and other biotechnology techniques to
create products for medical treatment, mainly products that either
promote or inhibit the activity of the immune system.
   Products that are being tested on people in government-supervised
trials include ones for cancer therapy, wound healing and protection
of bone marrow from the harmful effects of radiation therapy and
chemotherapy.
   The biggest threat to Immunex is that other companies developing
products in the same field could challenge its patent position,
Edelman said.
   At the end of 1988 Immunex had marketing rights for only two of
its own products. After the changes announced Thursday, some of
which occurred earlier this year, it will have rights to more than a
dozen.
   Like many small biotech companies, Immunex had given marketing
rights for its products to other companies in exchange for research
funding and help in manufacturing. Even after the deals, other
companies will retain foreign marketing rights for many
Immunex-related products.
   Immunex's partners include Eastman Kodak Co., West Germany's
Behringwerke AG and Syntex Corp.
   The restructuring will give Immunex a five-year head start on its
plan to transform itself into a conventional pharmaceutical company
by 1995, Stephen Duzan, the chairman and chief executive, said at a
New York news conference.
   ``We're going to be a modest-sized but fully integrated
pharmaceutical company,'' Duzan said in an interview.
   Immunex said it is poised to enter the cancer market in the
coming five years and the infectious disease and autoimmune disease
markets in 1995 to 2000. Autoimmune diseases are those such as
arthritis and diabetes in which the body is attacked by its own
immune-system defenses.
   Immunex reacquired worldwide marketing and manufacturing rights
to interleukin-1 receptor and interleukin-4 receptor products by
restructuring its joint venture with Kodak's Sterling Drug Co.
   It also reacquired U.S. co-marketing and manufacturing rights
from Behringwerke AG for CM-CSF (granulocyte macrophage colony
stimulating factor), interleukin-3 and other CSF products.
   In return, it gave Behringwerke the foreign rights to a package
of receptor products, including receptors for interleukin-1,
interleukin-4 and other undisclosed receptor products.
   It retained all North American rights for all receptor products.
Receptors can block the destructive action of the immune system by
serving as decoys for attackers.

<TEXT>
   ITT Consumer Financial Corp. agreed Thursday
to pay what could total more than $50 million for allegedly bilking
hundreds of thousands of Californians with loans later packed with
extra requirements.
   California Attorney General John Van de Kamp called the civil
settlement capping a three-year investigation ``one of the largest
and most sweeping consumer fraud settlements in American history.''
   He said Minneapolis-based ITT lured applicants into expensive
loans packed with extras such as various forms of insurance and
thrift club memberships. Applicants were bilked of as much as $2,000
each, he said.
   ITT is the parent company of co-defendants Aetna Finance Co. _
which Van de Kamp said had no connection with Aetna Insurance Co. _
ITT Lyndon Property Insurance Co., and ITT Lyndon Life Insurance Co.
   All the consumers involved are to be sent letters explaining the
settlement.
   Van de Kamp estimated as many as 300,000 victims but said only
about one third are expected to seek restitution, with the total
return between $25 million and $50 million.
   ITT also will pay $10.5 million to establish consumer protection
trust funds, $8.67 million in civil penalties and $575,000 for legal
costs and a toll-free phone number for consumers claiming refunds.
   Van de Kamp said ITT took advantage of people ``in desperate need
of money'' and charged up to 35 percent interest on loans and
attached items.
   ITT said in a statement it agreed to restitution at the same time
a civil suit was filed Thursday in Alameda County Superior Court. It
neither admitted nort denied wrongdoing.
   ITT said the accusations ``without doubt were contraventions to
our procedures and not a pattern of behavior condoned by the
company,'' but added that ``pre-existing safeguards'' existed on
loans and insurance.
   Claimants will be entitled to interest paid, interest on the
interest for years involved and the cost of all extras.

   J.P. Morgan &amp; Co. Inc. moved ahead of other major
banking companies Thursday by adding $2 billion to its cushion of
reserves for loan losses, indicating deeper pessimism about the
chances of repayment by developing countries.
   Morgan's action was far more severe than those taken earlier this
week by Chase Manhattan Corp. and Manufacturers Hanover Corp.
   Morgan's reserves now equal 100 percent of its medium- and
long-term loans to developing countries. In contrast, Chase's equal
46 percent after its addition this week and Manufacturers Hanover's
36 percent.
   Morgan, the parent of Morgan Guaranty Trust Co., said it would
continue doing business in developing countries but would focus on
merchant banking rather than general lending. Merchant banking
involves providing advice, trading and investing and finance.
   ``We will continue to consider lending in appropriate specific
transactions. We intend to continue to play a constructive role in
developing countries,'' Morgan spokeswoman Kathleen Baum said.
   The bigger cushion indicates Morgan has gotten tired of prolonged
and unfruitful negotiations with debtor nations on repayment, said
Stephen Berman, a banking analyst at County Securities USA.
   ``I think they just want to say the hell with this,'' he said.
   Morgan, the nation's third-largest bank-holding company, also is
one of the financially strongest. That means it was able to take the
punishment of the $2 billion addition, which will result in a loss
of about $1.8 billion in the current quarter.
   Morgan's action could be an indication of trouble for the
negotiations on debt relief under a plan devised by Treasury
Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, Berman said. Less developed countries
have debts of $1.3 trillion.
   ``Early on in this process everybody sort of pulled together,
followed the lead of Citibank,'' Berman said. ``Everybody is sort of
cutting and running now and pursuing their own interest.''
   This week's round of additions to loan-loss reserves was
triggered by the conclusion last week of an accord to provide debt
relief to Mexico under the Brady plan, which emphasizes debt
forgiveness by the banks.
   The terms of the Mexico accord made banks acknowledge that they
had been overly optimistic in their earlier expectations for
repayment. But Morgan's action seemed to go beyond necessity, Berman
said.
   ``Economic and political problems have intensified in several
countries where we have significant exposure, including problems in
paying interest when due,'' Lewis T. Preston, Morgan's chairman,
said in a written statement.
   Preston said he was concerned that debtor countries could be
expecting more help from the Brady plan than the industrial
countries are likely to provide.
   He also said: ``Achieving satisfactory loan restructuring
agreements will also be more and more difficult because of
increasingly divergent approaches to LDC (less-developed country)
debt problem among bank lenders and among governments.''
   Morgan now has a total of $3 billion in loan-loss reserves, with
$2.8 billion of that unofficially allocated to loans to developing
countries. That $2.8 billion is equal to 70 percent of Morgan's
total loans to developing countries, and 100 percent of the
medium-and long-term loans to those nations. In an indication of
Morgan's financial strength, Moody's Investors Service and Standards
and Poor's both confirmed their investment-grade ratings on Morgan
senior debt.
   The last big round of additions to reserves was in late 1987, and
many banking companies have not taken any action since then.
   For example, Chemical Banking Corp.'s loan-loss reserves equal
just 28 percent of its loans to developing countries, the level it
reached in late 1987, spokesman Charles Salmans said.
   Chase Manhattan said Wednesday it would take a $1.31 billion
charge in the third quarter, largely to boost its reserves for
troubled loans to developing countries.
   Chase also announced plans to raise $500 million by selling new
common shares.
   Chase said its reserve increase would boost its reserves for
losses on loans to developing countries to 46 percent of its $6.2
billion in such loans and would produce a third-quarter loss for the
holding company of $1.11 billion.
   Manufacturers Hanover on Monday added $950 million to its
loan-loss reserves and sold control of its asset-based lending unit,
CIT Group, to Japan's Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank for $1.28 billion.
   Manufacturers Hanover also agreed to sell a 4.9 percent stake in
the parent company to Dai-Ichi Kangyo for another $120 million.
   Manufacturers Hanover said the addition to its loan-loss reserve
would produce a third-quarter loss of $775 million.

<HEAD>World Bank Reports Incomes Up in Asia</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Incomes rose sharply for people in key Asian
countries last year, with Japan's increase almost twice that of the
United States, the World Bank reported Thursday.
   In Japan, the average went up to $12,480 from 1987's $11,780,
while average income in the United States rose to $14,080 from
$13,650. The figures are corrected for inflation.
   The data show that compared with wealthier countries, the Third
World is losing its share of the world's income, said John O'Connor,
who heads the bank's office on social and economic data.
   ``Comparatively, the poor are getting poorer,'' he said.
   People in countries where earnings are lower showed more modest
gains. The average South Korean had a proportionately large
increase: from $2,760 to $3,060 in 1988. India was up from $310 to
$330, the Philippines from $620 to $680 and Thailand showed a sharp
rise from $830 to $940.
   China's figure for 1988 was not in yet. In 1987, the average
Chinese had an income of $510. No figure was given for Taiwan, which
is not a member of the bank.
   ``For 1989, we expect to see a modest correction in what have
been very high rates of growth down to more sustainable levels for
India, China and several middle-income countries,'' said Attila
Karaosmanoglu, the bank's vice-president for Asia.
   The World Bank's figures deal largely with Third World countries,
since it is the largest source of loans to raise their standards of
living. Statistics for 1988 are not yet complete, officials said.
   Scattered reports for a few European countries that borrow from
the bank showed increases in Cyprus from $4,810 to $5,010 and Greece
from $4,310 to $4,440. But in Yugoslavia there was a drop, to $3,080
from $3,180 in 1987.
   In Latin America, the 1988 figure fell to $1,800 from $1,830.
   The significant losses came in the larger countries. In Brazil,
which accounts for a third of the production in the continent,
average income dropped to $1,930 from $1,980. In Mexico the fall was
to $2,260 from $2,300 and in Venezuela from $3,390 to $3,290. Chile
rose to $2,370 from $2,280, while Argentina's figure was not
available.
   For southern Africa, the bank's figures show a steady decline
since 1980, when the average income for the area was $570 a year. In
1988 it was $440. The Republic of South Africa is not included in
this calculation.

<HEAD>With AM-Texas Air-GM, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The total cost of the UAL Corp. buyout could reach
$9.45 billion, according to Securities and Exchange Commission
filings by the employee-managment group seeking to take over United
Airlines' parent.
   The group, composed of United pilots, UAL's top management and
British Airways PLC, also announced in newspaper ads Thursday the
commencement of their tender offer for all outstanding shares of
UAL's common stock for $300 a share.
   According to the merger agreement filed with the SEC on
Wednesday, the buyout group will require $6.8 billion to purchase
UAL's 22.65 million fully diluted shares.
   It said the group may refinance $950 million in existing UAL
debt, which would leave $512 million in long-term debt and $411
million in capital leases outstanding.
   Various fees and a $1.3 billion credit facility for working
capital are also included in the total buyout cost.
   The buyout, accepted by UAL's board of directors Sept. 14, will
give UAL workers 75 percent ownership of the company. Management
will own 10 percent and British Airways will own 15 percent.
   The group plans to finance the transaction with $750 million from
British Airways, $200 million in voluntary pension contributions
from the pilots, $1.3 billion from UAL cash reserves and $7.2
billion in bank loans.

<TEXT>
   A U.S. magistrate denied bail Thursday to
one of three defendants charged with trying to extort $10 million
from Du Pont Co. in exchange for trade secrets stolen from the
chemical giant.
   U.S. Magistrate Sue Robinson denied bail for Bruno Skerianz
during a pretrial detention hearing, saying there was a possibility
Skerianz would not show for trial because he was an international
traveler with ``considerable resources.''
   Skerianz was returned to the United States from Switzerland last
week. He had fought extradition since his arrest there earlier this
year.
   Defense attorney Richard Zappa had sought limited electronic
monitoring for Skerianz.
   Skerianz and two other suspects have been in custody at
undisclosed locations since their arrests in February. All are
charged with one count each of attempted extortion. They face up to
20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine each.
   The federal government plans to drop charges against a fourth
suspect, Maria I. Lorenzo de Bianchini, who is living in a private
home in Elsmere. According to court documents, the charges will be
dropped in exchange for her testimony if needed.
   The three Argentinian nationals and Skerianz were arrested in
Geneva, Switzerland, after an aborted meeting at which Du Pont was
to pay $10 million to the suspects in exchange for ``sensitive
documents'' concerning Lycra, Du Pont's trade name for spandex
fiber, the FBI said.
   The suspects had all worked at Du Pont's plant in Mercedes,
Argentina, one of several plants that make the fiber.
   Spandex is used primarily in swimming suits, leotards and
pantyhose.

   China prefers to sell its goods for Western
hard currency but its imports from the Soviet Union, paid for by
bartering, are way up, the Central Intelligence Agency reports.
   ``Chinese imports of goods such as timber and fertilizer, where
the quality of the Soviet commodity is comparable to that elsewhere,
will probably grow this year as Beijing turns to barter to conserve
foreign exchange,'' the CIA said in an analysis prepared for
Congress and released this week to the press.
   Sino-Soviet trade grew 27 percent least year to a two-way total
of $3.3 billion and figures for the first half of 1989 show even
stronger growth, with Chinese imports surging by 63 percent and
exports up 12 percent, the report said.
   Trade along the Soviet-Chinese border has risen swiftly to
account for 10 percent of the two countries' trade, welcomed by
remote Chinese provinces lacking easy access to other markets, it
noted.
   The report also disclosed that 8,000 Chinese laborers are working
on projects in the Soviet Union under arrangements generally
providing payment to China with a percentage of the production. At
least 5,000 more are expected to follow, it said.
   The two countries normalized relations last spring, providing a
boost to their economic relations which, however, appear to be
reaching their limits, since Beijing will continue to favor Western
technology, said the CIA.

   The Board of Governors of the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange said Thursday it had approved a proposal to allow traders
to buy or sell blocks of Standard and Poor's 500 stock index futures
outside the trading pit.
   The rule, approved Wednesday at the board's regular meeting, is
comparable to rules on block buying and selling on major U.S. stock
exchanges, the board said in a release Thursday.
   The rule will help lessen the impact of large trades on the
market, said John Geldermann, chairman of the board of governors.
   The board said the Merc is the first futures exchange to adopt
such a plan.
   Under the rule, a member firm with a customer order to buy or
sell more than 300 S&amp;P futures contracts could attempt to find a
counterparty to the trade outside of the trading pit.
   Once a counterparty is found, the firm would notify an exchange
official and announce to the trading pit the size and type of order.
The intended price would not be disclosed at that point.
   Members in the pit would have the opportunity to trade with all
or part of the order. The remainder of the order not filled within
the open outcry process in the pit would be traded to the
counterparty at the agreed-upon price.
   The rule will be submitted to the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission for approval. If approved, it will be used on a pilot
basis for the S&amp;P futures contract, which is the most heavily traded
stock index futures contract in the world, according to the board.

<HEAD>Texas Bank Failures Tie Last Year's Record, More Coming</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With Thursday's announcement of the state's 113th
bank closing this year, Texas tied last year's record on a scorecard
of failure that experts say may slow, but won't end, for several
years.
   ``We believe that 1990 is going to show a slight increase in the
number of independently chartered banks that fail,'' said Texas
Banking Commissioner Kenneth Littlefield. But ``we will continue to
have bank failures for two more years that are the result of past
lending decisions.''
   ``We have seen the peak as far as the absolute numbers are
concerned,''added Sandy Flannigan, a Houston-based analyst for
PaineWebber Inc.
   Nationally, the numbers should remain about the same next year,
according to Alan Whitney, a spokesman for the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp. in Washington, D.C.
   The failures will continue, Whitney said, ``even though the
economy in Texas and other parts of the Southwest has begun to
stabilize somewhat, because changes in the banking industry always
lag from 18 months to 24 months.''
   On Thursday, Littlefield shut down Rose Capital Bank in Tyler.
   The bank, which had assets of $64.6 million and deposits of about
$61.1 million, was purchased by First City Bancorp of Texas Inc. for
$25,000. First City also will purchase about $46.4 million of Rose
Capital's assets.
   The FDIC will provide $16.8 million in assistance, and retain
assets with a book value of $18.2 million.
   The 113 Texas failures this year included 20 involved in the
federal seizure of MCorp banks and 24 from the shutdown of banks
owned by Texas American Bancshares Inc.
   The number does not include the 12 banks of National Bancshares
Corp. of Texas that were bought by Equimark Corp. of Pittsburgh in a
federally assisted transaction.
   Last year's 113 included 40 banks taken over from First
RepublicBank Corp. Those banks became NCNB Texas National Bank,
which remains the state's largest bank.
   Nationally, Rose Capital was the 160th failure this year, a huge
jump from 10 years ago. Ten banks failed each year from 1979 to 1981
and ``we thought it was Armageddon,'' the FDIC's Whitney said.
   Since then, the numbers have grown each year: 42 in 1982, 48 in
1983, 80 in 1984, 120 in 1985, 138 in 1986, 184 in 1987 and 200 last
year.
   Although regulators frequently cite poor management and
inadequate supervision as reasons for specific failures, Robert
Rieke, a banking analyst at Rauscher Pierce Refsnes Inc. in Dallas,
said regulators themselves are partially at fault.
   He said that from 1982 to 1985 ``the regulators just
indiscriminately approved bank charters and these banking
organizations never had the opportunity to grow in size.''
   Rieke predicted it would take five years to clean the slate.
   Littlefield, who took over as Texas banking commissioner three
years ago, said, ``In hindsight, it's easy to make that conclusion:
that there were too many banks chartered.''

<HEAD>Carl Icahn, Jesse Jackson, Others Play Simulated Takeover Game</HEAD>

   Do takeover battles really end when the power
system blows during a climactic board meeting?
   Probably not. But that was about the only thing clearly out of
character Thursday as TWA chairman and investor Carl Icahn and a
cast of corporate and civic heavyweights including the Rev. Jesse
Jackson put some of their well-honed moves on public display in a
three-hour simulated takeover.
   ``I think it's been incredibly realistic,'' Arthur R. Taylor, the
dean of the Graduate School of Business Administration at Fordham
University, said shortly before the lights dimmed and the
microphones went dead.
   He said the participants in the program that people from his
school designed were ``acting as they do at real board meetings.''
   Robert O. Anderson, the former head of the Atlantic Richfield Co.
who played the role of the chief executive of the company under
siege, rated the interplay among the board members ``surprisingly
good.''
   But Frederick H. Joseph, the chief executive of the investment
banking firm Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., cautioned that there were
limits to the imagined reality. ``What we are doing in 10 minutes
takes 10 days,'' he said.
   In the game, Joseph played an investment banker advising Icahn,
who was cast as an investor with a small stake in the beleaguered
target company and was considering launching an alternative takeover
bid.
   The program was put on at a conference run by the World
Management Council, an international organization of management
groups.
   The simulation went a step further than recent exercises in which
prominent people in various fields are brought together for a
moderator-led discussion about a hypothetical case.
   In this corporate war game, the directors of the imaginary Main
Street Industries Inc., a Southern retailing company, met in one
room to mourn the death of their chairman and to assess their
options should the swirl of takeover rumors produce an offer.
   At the same time, Icahn was closeted in a room across the hall,
talking one-by-one with with financial advisers, union officials and
representatives of a foundation that had an 18 percent stake in the
company about his plans to make a bid for the company.
   Several hundred people attending the conference were invited to
walk back and forth between the rooms as they wished as the scenario
unfolded through a series of twists and turns.
   Conference staffers added to the atmosphere with periodic updates
on the company's stock price and news headlines, such as Icahn's
notice that he bought an 8 percent stake in the firm.
   Observers got to watch Icahn court the unions and the foundation
for support before going to the board. They saw him needle his
investment bankers about the fees they wanted to finance the bid and
get so swept up in the franctic pace of activity that he chided an
inattentive assistant by blurting out, ``Come on, you're not at
Smith College.''
   When Icahn finally got in to see the board, he found they had
been doing their homework as well and felt that neither his offer
nor a competing bid was worth accepting.
   Board members said they would investigate a recapitalization
instead.
   The real-life power outage cut short any additional countermoves,
and the game was declared finished.
   ``I enjoyed it,'' Anderson said. Icahn concurred, saying ``It was
entertaining. It was fun.''
   Jackson, the civil rights activist who played a foundation
representative interested in protecting the communities and workers
served by the stores, said the game created a ``healthy
environment'' for discussion of tough issues.
   ``I hope it increases all of our sensitivity,'' he said.

<HEAD>Burned Junk Bond Investors Sue Regulators in Lincoln Debacle</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Investors who say they lost $250 million on
junk bonds sold by Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan Association sued the state
of California on Thursday, claiming state officials never should
have allowed the bond sale.
   The suit alleges the Department of Corporations disregarded its
own findings and warnings by savings and loan regulators when it
approved the sale of bonds by Lincoln's parent company, American
Continental Corp.
   It accuses top Department of Corporations officials, including
Christine Bender, the head of the department, of conflict of
interest because of their ties to the law firm representing American
Continental, the Phoenix company that federal officials are suing
for $1.1 billion. American Continental is operating under Chapter 11
of federal bankruptcy laws.
   Bender, who once worked for the law firm, declined detailed
comment, but said, ``Our actions were appropriate, we think we did
more than what was required by the law, and we are persuaded that a
court will find in our favor.''
   Attorney Joseph Cotchett added the state as a defendant in an
Orange County Superior Court class-action suit filed on behalf of
23,000 bondholders. The suit says many of the investors were elderly
people who believed the bonds were insured because they were
purchased in Lincoln Savings offices.
   The suit seeks return of the $250 million, unspecified punitive
damages and attorneys' fees.
   Lincoln Savings is insolvent and has been seized by thrift
regulators, with estimated losses to taxpayers running as high as
$2.5 billion, the largest S&amp;L bailout in history.
   Federal thrift regulators have sued American Continental
officials for $1.1 billion, with additional penalties that could
bring the total to $2.4 billion.
   That suit accuses Lincoln officials of racketeering, insider
trading, illegal loans, sham real-estate and tax transactions, and
the fraudulent sale of Lincoln stock to employees of the parent
company.
   The Orange County suit, amended Thursday, says state regulators
had enough documentation that they knew or should have known that
American Continental was near collapse in 1986, when the regulators
approved the sale of $200 million in uninsured junk bonds known as
subordinated debentures.
   Junk bonds are high-risk, high-yield securities usually offered
by companies with a great deal of debt on their books or in weak
financial condition.
   In addition, state officials approved the sale of $150 million
more in American Continental junk bonds in 1988.
   The suit says the bonds were extremely risky to investors because
of American Continental's precarious financial condition, the
company's speculative investment portfolio and ``the high
probability that the subordinated debentures would be sold to
persons seeking to make federally insured deposits, and who would
not understand the risks of subordinated debentures.''
   When a company goes bankrupt, holders of its junk bonds are among
the last creditors to get paid.
   The head of American Continental, Arizona businessman Charles
Keating, contributed $366,250 to California politicians from 1986 to
1988, including $79,000 to Gov. George Deukmejian, most of it for
his 1986 re-election bid.
   At a Department of Corporations meeting on the bond offering in
March 1988, Los Angeles attorney Karl Samuelian, Deukmejian's chief
fund raiser, personally represented American Continental. The
meeting helped lead to approval of the bond sale.
   Bender once worked for Samuelian's firm.
   Deukmejian spokesman Tom Beermann said Thursday that ``Mr.
Keating was one of 56,000 individuals who contributed to the
governor's re-election campaign. Campaign contributions in no way
influenced any action by the Deukmejian administration.''

<HEAD>FTC: Buffet Can Vote His USAir Stock</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS last graf to UPDATE with Steinhardt increasing holding.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.,
investor Warren E. Buffett, said Wednesday he now has federal
regulators' permission to vote his stock in USAir, as provided by a
previous agreement.
   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Buffett
said the waiting period for approval of the agreement under federal
antitrust law expired Sept. 13.
   Buffett, who bought $358 miilion in newly issued convertible
preferred stock in USAir Group Inc. last month, said the expiration
of the waiting period gave him clearance from the Federal Trade
Commission to exercise his voting rights under the agreement.
   Buffett's shares, described by him and USAir as a friendly
investment, gave him a 12 percent stake in the company, which runs
the nation's seventh-largest airline.
   In July, a New York investor group headed by Wall Street money
manager Michael Steinhardt said it acquired 5.98 percent of USAir
and might seek control of the Arlington, Va.-based airline company.
The group said in a recent SEC filing that it had increased its
holding to 8.38 percent through stock purchases between Sept. 7 and
Monday.

<HEAD>American Home Products Halts Generic Drug Production</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   American Home Products Corp. is halting
production and distribution of all its generic drugs after federal
inspectors found discrepancies and possible misrepresentation in
some of the firm's records, according to a report published Thursday.
   Quantum Pharmics Ltd., a subsidiary of New York-based American
Home, took the action after an investigation by the parent company
and an inspection by the Food and Drug Administration, The
Washington Post reported.
   The FDA said it ``uncovered some discrepancies in records
associated with three of their products. In those three instances,
some data appears to have been misrepresented to the agency during
the approval process.''
   Quantum is one of 20 generic drug companies being inspected as
part of a government investigation of the industry.
   The company manufactures 21 generic drugs that include a variety
of anti-hypertensive, anti-arthritic and anti-depressant drugs.
   American Home Products is a major brand-name drug maker and
consumer products manufacturer. Among its well-known
over-the-counter drugs are Anacin and Dristan. Its prescription drug
operations include Wyeth Labs, Whitehall Labs and Ayerst Labs.
