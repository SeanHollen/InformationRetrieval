   The federal inspector who oversees United
Airlines' Boeing 747 fleet testified Thursday he had not been aware
the airline had a problem with a cargo door that later blew off in
flight, killing nine passengers.
   Inspector George Batiza also said the Federal Aviation
Administration had failed to ensure that United complied with a
federal rule that took effect last July 1, requiring airlines to
inspect cargo doors after they were manually operated because of
electrical problems.
   Testimony on the final day of a three-day hearing into the
accident held by the National Transportation Safety Board also
centered on Boeing's design for the door. But the hearing failed to
unearth any definite cause for the accident.
   On Wednesday, the airline testified that it was unaware of the
FAA's inspection rule and was not in compliance for about nine
months.
   But by coincidence, company mechanics made a partial inspection
of the ill-fated cargo door in late December, two months before the
Feb. 24 disaster, a United executive said Thursday. The inspection
followed repairs made to the door, which had failed to open and
close electrically.
   ``I am convinced the check ... verified that the door was
working,'' said Robert Doll, United vice president for technical
services.
   He added, however, that the inspection was not as thorough as
the Federal Aviation Administration required under the new rule.
   Batiza testified that he was unaware of the repairs at the time
and had not found any deficiencies in United's maintenance program
recently.
   Ray Ramakis, manager of aircraft maintenance for the FAA,
testified later that agency inspectors were required to review rule
changes with airlines to see if airline plans for responding to the
changes were adequate.
   Ramakis declined to comment when asked to explain how Batiza,
who oversees United's 31-plane 747 fleet, could not know that
United was failing to follow the new rule.
   Another FAA inspector, Robert Sanchez, said Thursday he was
unaware that United was using power tools to operate some cargo
doors, despite recommendations from Boeing not to do so for fear of
damaging the mechanisms.
   Sanchez, who oversees maintenance for United's entire 412-plane
fleet, said he was unaware until just a few weeks ago that the
company had received FAA approval to use the power tools.
   The NTSB hearing was being held to gather evidence on why the
door and part of the fuselage tore off United Flight 811 as the 747
was climbing to 23,000 feet. Nine passengers were sucked out of the
plane over the Pacific Ocean, 85 miles southwest of Honolulu as the
plane headed for Australia.
   Speculation has focused on a possible malfunction in the locking
mechanism of the cargo door, which remains on the bottom of the
Pacific Ocean. The NTSB has not decided whether to retrieve it.
   Boeing was sharply criticized by an accident investigator for
the Air Line Pilots Association for insisting 747 cargo doors are
safe despite two incidents since 1987 of the doors opening in
mid-flight.
   A door on a Pan Am flight out of London partially opened in 1987
and the plane had to return to London, with no loss of life. No
definite cause has ever been established for that incident.
   ``We cannot explain the Pan American incident, and we have the
United accident where the door failed, but we steadfastly are
saying the door is safe,'' Capt. Douglas Robinson of ALPA
complained.
   Boeing engineering manager James Fitzgerald spent two hours in
the witness chair defending the design and operation of the cargo
door, which has been the main focus of the investigation.
   ``I don't know how the door came open,'' Fitzgerald said. ``I
don't want to speculate on how it happened.''
   Under questioning, Fitzgerald told the NTSB that Boeing had not
done projections on the effect of cargo-door openings in mid-flight.
   ``You had no idea what would happen ... when the door came off
the airplane?'' an incredulous Robinson asked.
   ``The doors are not designed to come off the airplane,''
Fitzgerald replied. ``We had no way of knowing exactly what would
happen if a door came open in flight.''
   Boeing builds 747s in nearby Everett, Wash.

<HEAD>Rite Aid President Charged With Bribing Pharmacy Board Member</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CLEVELAND (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The president of Rite Aid Corp., the nation's
largest retail pharmacy chain, was arrested Thursday on charges of
paying a $33,000 bribe to a state Pharmacy Board member,
authorities said.
   Martin Grass allegedly was videotaped saying the money was
intended to induce the board member to quit so a replacement of
Rite Aid's choosing could be appointed by the administration of
Gov. Richard Celeste, prosecutors said.
   Assistant Cuyahoga County Prosecutor William Caine said Grass
also promised the pharmacy board member family medical insurance
for four years if the member signed an undated resignation letter.
   Rite Aid, in a statement, said the arrest stemmed from a
vendetta by the pharmacy board against Rite Aid and said the
payment by check reflected money legally owed by the chain to the
board member.
   A spokesman for the governor denied Celeste intended to appoint
a pharmacy board member who would be supportive of Rite Aid, which
is based in Shiremanstown, Pa.
   The prosecutor's office did not identify the target of the
alleged bribe attempt but Rite Aid said Grass met with board member
Melvin Wilczynski of Toledo, who declined to comment on the
allegations.
   Caine said Grass brought six drafts of an undated resignation
letter, one of which the board member signed, and suggested that
the board member retire between June and October.
   ```We'll let you know,''' Caine quoted Grass as telling the
board member with regard to the effective date of the resignation.
   The pharmacy board is made up of eight voting members appointed
to staggered four-year terms by the governor subject to Senate
confirmation. The executive director only votes to break ties.
   Grass was charged with bribery and was freed after posting 10
percent of his $100,000 surety bond. His attorney, John S. Pyle,
declined comment.
   Garry South, Celeste's communications director, said the
governor knew nothing about the matter.
   ``He (the governor) has never heard of the guy (Grass),'' South
said. ``He is either using the governor for cover or using too many
drugs from his own drug store.''
   Suzanne Mead, assistant vice president for corporate
communications for Rite Aid, said the charge was ``totally without
merit and the payment in question was made in satisfaction of a
contract between a pharmacist, who also is an Ohio pharmacy board
member, and People's Drugstores, his former employer.''
   She said Rite Aid acquired the Lane Drug Division of Peoples
Drugstores on April 10 and was liable for the payment under the
contract. The payment was made in settlement of the contract and
was legal, she said.

Secretary who founded the National Gallery of Art.
   Bush, just back from a four-day, cross-country trip, attended
the black-tie dinner at the National Gallery with his wife, Barbara.
   Bush said Mellon created a tradition that reaffirms the nation's
``decency and kindness.''
   The president also praised Mellon's son Paul, whose family
remains intimately involved in donating art and raising funds for
the gallery.
   Mellon announced that former Ambassador Walter Annenberg and his

<HEAD>Coach Thompson Says He Met With Alleged Drug Dealer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Georgetown University basketball coach John
Thompson said Thursday that he met with an alleged drug kingpin and
asked him to steer clear of his players after learning that several
members of his team were frequenting a bar where drug trafficking
is common.
   Thompson told ABC News that he summoned the alleged drug dealer,
24-year-old Rayful Edmond III, after learning that many players on
the Hoyas team were socializing at Chapter III, a Washington
nightclub where both college students and alleged drug dealers
regularly gather.
   ``I sent the word out on the street that I'd like to talk to
him,'' Thompson said. ``It was almost like a tacit agreement: `Do
me a favor: If you see anything going on out there, use whatever
resources you have to stop it from happening.'''
   Thompson, who coached the U.S. basketball team in the 1988
Olympics in Seoul, said he met with Edmond in February. On April
15, Edmond and 15 others were arrested and charged with running a
massive transcontinental cocaine ring.
   U.S. Attorney Jay B. Stephens has estimated that Edmond's group
may be responsible for up to 20 percent of the cocaine trafficking
in the nation's capital.
   Thompson said he was trying to head off a problem before it
developed.
   ``What I was trying to do ... was not wait until something
happened, that would hurt one of the kids,'' Thompson told ABC.
``(I didn't want) to have a body laying there, someone who had been
using drugs.''
   Thompson did not elaborate on whether he suspected any of his
athletes were using drugs.
   ``Nightline'' host Ted Koppel reported that Thompson learned
that freshman center Alonzo Mourning and sophomore forward John
Turner were among the Hoyas who frequented the nightclub.
   Thompson described Edmond as ``very polite.''
   ``It was `Yes sir, no sir,''' Thompson said.
   District of Columbia police suspect that Edmond's organization
may be responsible for up to 30 drug-related murders in the
nation's capital during the past two years.
   The city became the nation's murder capital last year with 372
murders, most of the drug-related. So far this year, there have
been 164 slayings, compared with 102 at the same time last year.

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A spring snowstorm swept across the Rockies on Thursday, dumping
up to 8 inches of heavy, wet snow in Montana, while winds and new
snow created near blizzard conditions in parts of Wyoming and
tornadoes hit southern Iowa.
   A twister struck the Bluffs Run greyhound racetrack in Council
Bluffs about 8 p.m. Thursday, sending one man to the hospital for
stitches after he was struck by flying debris, officials said.
   The tornado, which touched down in a field about 1,000 yards
from the track, ripped siding from the building, downed trees and
damaged some cars with wind-blown debris, officials said. The dog
races were delayed about 15 minutes.
   Another tornado was reported on the ground in southern Omaha,
Neb., about 7:40 p.m. and funnel clouds were sighted over the
central part of the city as well as near Papillion and 20 miles
west of Omaha, the weather service said.
   There were no immediate reports of injury, streets flooded in
Omaha and golf-ball sized hail caused extensive damage to many cars
after a day of record high temperatures in Nebraska and in the
South.
   Heavy snow warnings were posted through Friday over the northern
mountains of Wyoming, with up to a foot of snowfall expected by
late Friday in the Laramie Range.
   Near Cheyenne, Wyo., about 6 inches of new snow combined with
strong and gusty winds to create near blizzard conditions Thursday
morning.
   In south-central Montana, 8 inches of snow fell on Red Lodge, a
ski resort community. Great Falls, Cut Bank, Helena, Butte, Bozeman
and Livingston all had accumulations of 2 to 4 inches.
   ``We've got big, white flat flakes coming down here, about the
size of a quarter,'' said Phil Kumm in Great Falls, Mont.
   Elsewhere, afternoon showers and thunderstorms extended Thursday
along the northern coast of North Carolina, as well as from
southwestern West Virginia into eastern Kentucky. Showers were
scattered over west-central Minnesota, as well as from southwestern
South Dakota across western Nebraska and eastern Colorado and
eastern Idaho.
   High-temperature records for the date were set in seven cities
and tied in two.
   Grand Island, Neb., broke its record of 87 set in 1901 with and
afternoon high of 88. Other records included Apalachicola, Fla.,
high of 86, breaking its record of 84 set in 1948; in Lincoln,
Neb., (92, 91 set in 1896); Nashville, Tenn., (90, 89 set 1987);
Omaha, Neb., (88, 87 in 1981); Paducah, Ky., (89, 87 in 1987).
Charleston, S.C., tied its record of 93, set in 1986 and St. Louis,
Mo., tied its record of 89, set 1956.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 31
degrees at Miles City, Mont., to 93 degrees at Charleston, S.C. The
nation's low Thursday was 16 degrees at Truckee, Calif.
   The national forecast for Friday called for showers and
thunderstorms from the Ohio Valley across southern lower Michigan,
Wisconsin and Illinois, from much of Missouri across southwest
Minnesota; the northern Plains, and from Montana across northern
Colorado and Idaho; rain becoming snow in the higher elevations of
the northern and central Rockies; and showers scattered through
northeast Texas.
   High temperatures were forecast in the 30s from western South
Dakota across central Wyoming; in the 40s and 50s from New England
across the Great Lakes, the upper Mississippi Valley, the northern
Plains; northwest Nebraska, and the Rockies; the 60s and 70s from
southern New York across Virginia, West Virginia, Ohio, Indiana,
northern Illinois, Iowa, the central Plains, western Oklahoma, the
Oklahoma-Texas panhandles, and the Pacific Coast; in the 90s from
southeastern South Carolina across much of Georgia and northern
Florida, as well as southwest Arizona into southeast California;
and in the 80s throughout the rest of the nation.

<HEAD>Appeals Court Upholds One of Largest Air Force Discrimination Settlements</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court, spurning charges of
reverse discrimination, affirmed an agreement Thursday that calls
for the government to promote 240 black civilian workers at Robins
Air Force Base.
   The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a consent degree
issued by U.S. District Judge Wilbur Owens that also required the
government to pay $3.75 million in back pay to 3,200 black
civilians who were employed at the base between 1972 and 1979.
   The agreement, reached in 1984 on a lawsuit filed in 1975, was
one of the largest discrimination settlements in Air Force history.
   The three-judge appeals panel agreed with Owens that black
civilian workers were entitled to the promotions because of past
discrimination at the base near Warner Robins, about 100 miles
south of Atlanta.
   The appeals court earlier had ordered Owens to allow a group of
white and non-minority employees, called the Warner Robins
Constitutional Rights Fund, to intervene in the lawsuit and
challenge the promotions. That group had challenged Owens' decision
in October 1987 to reaffirm the 1984 decree.
   The court ruled on an appeal by the fund, upholding the consent
decree and saying the interveners had failed to present any
evidence that the decree would have hurt their own chances for
promotion.
   Robert T. Poss, president of the Warner Robins Constitutional
Rights Fund, said in a telephone interview that the group would
discuss the ruling before deciding whether to appeal future.
   But, he added, ``We thought from the beginning it would be a
case that would have to be decided by the Supreme Court.''
   Thursday's opinion, written by Circuit Judge Charles Clark,
noted that 169 promotions were granted to blacks under the decree
between December 1984 and October 1986 and that those promotions
``comprised only 4.3 percent of the promotions made at Warner
Robins during that period of time.''
   The court noted that the decree was narrowly written so the
promotions were made only to 38 target positions to which the
original black plaintiffs had ``demonstrated that black employees
were promoted in proportions less than their representation in the
work force or in lower grades.''
   Clark wrote that the white and non-minority employees ``did not
present any evidence that any one of them otherwise eligible for a
target position was denied that position.''
   Robins Air Force Base spokesman Dale Brinkman said Thursday
night that base officials had not had time to study the court's
ruling so it was ``premature for me to make any statement on it.''

<TEXT>
   As he was finishing an emergency appendectomy, Dr.
James W. Turner noticed what he throught was a stray thread on the
surgical drapes. Then it wiggled.
   The thread was actually a 2-inch-long skinny red worm slithering
out of the patient's incision. It was a fish worm, inadvertently
eaten by the patient in sushi the night before.
   The patient was undergoing the operation for abdominal pain, but
doctors believe the worm was the real cause of his misery.
   The incident, described in today's New England Journal of
Medicine, ``is an uncomfortable reminder of the potential danger of
eating raw fish,'' noted Dr. Peter M. Schantz of the U.S. Centers
for Disease Control in Atlanta.
   Raw fish in sushi and sashimi has become popular with the spread
of Japanese restaurants in the United States, but health experts
say most cases of worm infection occur when people prepare raw fish
at home. Experienced sushi chefs are good at spotting wormy fish so
it doesn't reach customers.
   In the latest case, the victim ate raw fish at a friend's home
in New York City.
   ``He looked like anybody else with appendicitis,'' recalled
Turner, a surgeon at Booth Memorial Hospital. ``I operated, and
much to my chagrin the appendix was normal. I was getting ready to
close the abdomen, and I see this little thing, and it looks like
it's moving.
   ``I said, `Wait a minute. There's something wrong. I'll be
damned. It's a worm.'''
   The astonished doctors sent the worm to Albert Einstein College
of Medicine, where it was identified as a larval nematode known as
eustrongylides.
   ``There is a clear danger involved in eating raw fish. This
underscores that danger,'' said Dr. Murray Wittner, an Einstein
parasitologist.
   The adult form of eustrongylides is a parasite of fish-eating
birds, while the larvae are found in the flesh of fish that live in
brackish and fresh water.
   In an editorial in the journal, Schantz noted that only four
other cases of human infection with a nematode have been reported.
All were fishermen who swallowed bait minnows whole _ ``a practice
not likely to be widely imitated.''
   The worms most commonly acquired from raw seafood are larvae of
the family Anisakidae. Between 25 and 50 U.S. cases have been
documented, but experts believe most cases are not recognized or
reported to health officials.
   The worms often pass harmlessly through the digestive system or
are coughed up a few hours after the meal. Doctors have even
described a condition known as ``tingling throat syndrome,'' which
occurs when the worms get stuck in the back of the throat.
   Sometimes, however, the worms burrow into the wall of the
stomach or the intestines. They must be removed with a tube that's
pushed down the victim's throat.
   Schantz noted that many commercial fish are commonly infected
with worms. These include mackerel, herring, rockfish, salmon and
cod. The parasites also are more common in fish from the Pacific
Ocean than from the Atlantic.
   The number of worm infections is increasing in the United
States. But Schantz doubts that this will ever become a major
health problem, since most Americans still prefer their fish
cooked, which kills the worms.

   A Libyan air force officer split away from a
five-helicopter squadron flying to Sudan, landed his craft in
southern Egypt and requested asylum, a senior security source said.
   The incident Wednesday was the fourth defection-motivated
landing by Libyan military aircraft in Egypt in just over two
years. Relations between Egypt and Libya have been badly strained
since 1972.
   The security source, speaking by telephone from the southern
provincial capital of Aswan, identified the officer as Maj. Fat'hi
Miloud al-Saghir, 26.
   He said el-Saghir landed his Soviet-made helicopter about 62
miles south of Aswan and told Egyptian officers he wanted asylum
because he opposed participation in military operations in southern
Sudan and was ``unhappy'' with the regime of Libyan leader Col.
Moammar Gadhafi.
   Libya has been giving military aid to the Sudanese government of
Prime Minister Sadek Mahdi to fight a 6-year-old rebellion in three
southern regions.
   Libyan-Egyptian relations soured in 1972 after Cairo spurned a
bid by Gadhafi for immediate merger of the two countries.
   Five years later, the two countries fought a five-day border war
after a series of bombings in Egyptian cities that Cairo blamed on
Libyan agents. Relations chilled further after Gadhafi denounced
Egypt for signing a peace treaty with Israel in 1979.
   Libya expelled more than 40,000 Egyptian workers in 1986, but
tens of thousands of Egyptians continue to work there.

   A small slot in the personals section was not

$3,744.
   ``I am looking for a very special woman who would like to share

   A spokesman for the newspaper said it was the most expensive

   Gamma Boo, a little-known star in the constellation
Bootes, has been thrust from obscurity and named the
``astrophysical symbol'' of the French Revolution bicentennial.
   Hundreds of people toasted the new twinkling symbol with
champagne at the Paris Observatory at sunset Wednesday and peered
into the gathering twilight to the northeast trying to make it out.
   Jean-Noel Jeanneney, head of the commission planning the
festivities marking the revolution's 200th birthday, said choosing
an official star showed the poetic side of the celebration.
   Gamma Boo, also known as Seginus, was chosen because it is the
brightest of several stars that are roughly 200 light-years from
earth. Light now reaching Earth would have left the star at about
the time Parisians were storming the Bastille prison in July 1789.
   To spot Gamma Boo, a skywatcher should locate the Big Dipper,
then follow the direction of the Dipper's handle another
handle-length away.

   President Bush's mass media adviser for the 1988
presidential race denied Wednesday that his campaign strategy and
tactics were dirty or too negative.
   ``Look at `trash TV,' look at the lines blurring between tabloid
journalism and journalism, look at the garbage that is out there in
general,'' said Roger Ailes, a panelist at a seminar on ``The
Presidency in the '90s'' at Fordham University.
   ``I would submit that the political campaigns are among the
cleanest things on television today,'' Ailes said.
   NBC News commentator John Chancellor, who moderated the seminar,
said that since presidential candidates are spending public money _
about $41 million each in 1988 _ ``we ought to have some say in how
they spend it.''
   Jeff Greenfield, political and media adviser for ABC News,
defended political advertising as admittedly ``a short and clumsy
way to get to know a candidate. Yet even within those limits, you
pick up something.''
   Kathleen Hall Jamieson, an expert on presidential politics from
the University of Texas at Austin, suggested a nonpartisan panel be
instituted to review political advertising and rule on its fairness
and accuracy.
   And while some may complain that the presidential campaign drags
on, ``I don't know what you can do about the process being too long
short of legislating it and that would just drive it underground
like booze,'' he said.
   Ron Brown, chairman of the Democratic National Committee,
suggested that allowing the political parties a bigger role in
selecting candidates might produce more leaders on a par with the
great presidents of years past.
   ``There are people who believe when it comes to selecting
candidates for president, that you use participatory democracy to
its fullest extent in a general election, but that there are other
ways that parties ought to select candidates,'' Brown said.
   ``Certainly no changes are going to be made by 1992, but it
certainly isnce because there are ``too many imponderables'' in
making a successful campaign.
   Brown said that negative campaigning was one of the factors that
turn people off and keep them away from the polls on Election Day.
   Greenfield said he believed the role of television was ``vastly
exaggerated.'' Even with the skills of media gurus like Ailes,
``you run the 1988 campaign with 10 percent unemployment and you
have a very different result,'' he predicted.
   Greenfield, a former speech writer for Sen. Robert Kennedy, also
criticized the level of public discourse the campaigns have reached.
   ``Every time a candidate breaks through the puerility of the
debate,'' he said, ``whether it's Jesse Jackson and his `working
poor' litany or George Bush's acceptance speech (at the Republican
convention), you can feel the public almost come alive, say, `More,
please give us more.' ''
   At a later seminar Wednesday night, pollster Louis Harris said
he believed that presidents should turn to public opinion polls
after they confront the issues and make a decision.
   But, he pointed out, ``our polling is either victimized or a
reflection of what is reported. There's no question about it. And
television is the most powerful medium.''
   CBS White House correspondent Lesley Stahl said television's
coverage of issues is dependent, like it or not, on the president
presenting them in a simplified manner.
   ``If they want to communicate what their policies and their
thoughts and their decisions are to the American people over
television, they simply must learn how to simplify it,'' she said.
   She also noted that Bush has not been getting his message out as
well as President Reagan or even as well as he did during the
campaign.
   ``Presidents win support in these times not because the public
agrees with them on their ideology or their policies or on
substantive issues, but because they come to like them over
television,'' she said.
   ``Reagan became adored by the public because the White House
manipulated very brilliantly'' the media with staged events and
photo opportunities, she said. Bush has not done that, she said,
adding ``I kind of respect it but it's not doing him any good.''
   The seminars at Fordham in Manhattan were part of the city's
commemoration of the bicentennial of George Washington's
presidential inauguration.

   She never knew how great she was.
   Amid the blimp-size egos of the entertainment world, Lucille
Ball stood out like an orange beacon. She never bragged. She never
exercised her considerable power. She always seemed astonished,
even embarrassed, when honors inevitably came her way.
   When she was to receive a humanitarian award from Variety Clubs
on a CBS special five years ago, she told me: ``There comes a time
in your life when you get a lot of plaques. It's very flattering
and I'll go along with it, especially if it benefits children.''
   Whenever she was praised for ``I Love Lucy,'' she invariably
replied: ``Well, all of the credit should go to (writers) Madelyn
Pugh and Bob Carroll Jr.'' Or, ``Desi was a genius: He was
responsible for the show's success.'' Or she cited co-stars Desi,
Vivian Vance and Bill Frawley.
   Yes, the writing and producing and casting of ``I Love Lucy''
were marvelous, but Lucy's performance added the quantum force. Her
inspired pantomime could be written by no one: the growing panic as
the chocolate assembly line speeded up; her catalog of pained
expressions after tasting the patent medicine she was demonstrating.
   Unlike many stars, Lucille Ball rarely indulged in
self-analysis. But on one occasion she revealed why her feelings
about the ``I Love Lucy'' triumph might have been ambivalent:
   Living through the last five years of the show, she said, ``took
the edge off any enjoyment I might have had. Desi's drinking and
carousing were a terrible embarrassment, bad for a woman's
self-esteem. The talk around town was `poor Lucy.' Because I
couldn't face people, I became a recluse for more than 5{ years.
   ``I never demonstrated my unhappiness at the studio, and
actually, working together was a blessing. Desi had everything so
well organized that it was easy to do the work.''
   Lucy was late in reaching her comedy potential. She was 40 when
``I Love Lucy'' started on CBS and revolutionized television. And
although she spent many years in Hollywood, ``none of the studios
ever designed comedies for me the way MGM did for Red Skelton,
Paramount did for Bob Hope and Sam Goldwyn did for Danny Kaye,''
she once said.
   ``Television was the medium for me, the medium for anyone who
wanted to be well known a lot faster than waiting a year and a half
for a movie to come out,'' she said in an interview late in life.
``Television is an instant barometer, especially the way we did it.
   ``It was all new. Nobody knew anything about television. Nobody
was there to say, `No, don't do that, it's wrong!' We never knew
what was wrong and what was right. We were all feeling our way.
Desi was very innovative and very showmanship-conscious and was
very intent on going ahead and doing it: `That sounds all right,
let's go!' So we went.''
   Always the credit to someone else. But millions upon millions of
television watchers know otherwise.

   When 200 officers in riot gear came to
arrest protest organizer Zviad Gamsakhurdia two weeks ago, they
stormed over the walls of his home _ actually a museum to his
poet-father.
   And when the heavily armed officers returned to search the
premises, they were stymied outside for four hours because
Gamsakhurdia's 9-year-old son refused to open the door when he was
home alone.
   Gamsakhurdia, 50, is one of Georgia's most prominent dissidents,
who helped organize demonstrations that ended April 9 in a bloody
confrontation between troops and protesters. At least 20 people
died in the unrest.
   One of the southern republic's most prominent activists, he is
following the example of his late father, Konstantin, a revered
writer who was involved in creating the independent republic of
Georgia that existed from 1918 to 1921.
   After the government confiscated some of his father's earnings
six years ago, his son persuaded authorities to use the disputed
funds to renovate the family home into a house-museum showcasing
Konstantin's life.
   The leaky roof and old linoleum are gone, according to Zviad's
wife, Manana. The family now lives in spacious rooms with carved
wooden shutters and a sweeping staircase.
   Mrs. Gamsakhurdia said in an interview Tuesday that her husband
is still being held, and she has not been allowed to see him or
heard from him since.
   Gamsakhurdia helped start the series of demonstrations that
culminated in the April 9 tragedy when he went on a hunger strike
March 11, with a list of 20 demands. Many of the demands involved
ethnic issues, such as vandalism of an antique church, allegedly by
Southern Ossetians, and anti-Georgian discrimination in Abkhazia, a
region of Georgia on the Black Sea.
   But in seeking a resolution to these disputes, he drew
accusations that he was inciting ethnic tensions himself.
   By the end of March, Abkhazians were holding mass meetings to
complain about discrimination against them by Georgians. The
Tbilisi demonstrations started as a response to the Abkhazian
demands for secession from Georgia, and evolved into a mass call
for Georgia's secession from the Soviet Union.
   On April 9, protesters helped Gamsakhurdia and other organizers
escape the Tbilisi clash because they assumed the leaders were the
targets of the soldiers, said Mrs. Gamsakhurdia.
   At 6 a.m. that day, Gamsakhurdia was at Tbilisi State
University, organizing a general strike, Mrs. Gamsakhurdia said.
   At 8:30 a.m., about 200 officers of the KGB, the Interior
Ministry and police descended on the family home in a neighborhood
of antique meandering streets, and scaled the 12-foot-high brick
wall rather than ring the bell, Mrs. Gamsakhurdia said. They had no
arrest warrant _ ``nothing at all,'' she said.
   The officers donned riot gear, burst through a door, attacked
her husband and dragged him off to jail, she said.
   The officers did not damage the shrine of books, photographs and
memorabilia of Gamsakhurdia's father and his involvement in
Georgia's heady three years as an independent nation. But in the
garden, the officers uprooted the crosses on the graves of
Konstantin, his wife and daughter.
   ``Why do they do that to dead people?'' Mrs. Gamsakhurdia asked.
   When the police returned April 15 for a search, only to be put
off by the 9-year-old, Mrs. Gamsakhurdia called the Communist Party
headquarters of Georgia. She said she threatened to release to the
world press a photograph of the troops swarming over her home if
such actions did not halt.
   On April 20, her home was searched _ by just four officials, she
said.
   Mrs. Gamsakhurdia says she does not believe new Georgian
Communist Party chief Givi Gumbaridze when he says he wants a
dialogue with opponents to replace the traditional party monologue.
   ``They still don't want a dialogue,'' she said. If officials
really wanted to talk with her husband and other activists, they
would release them from prison, she said.
   She also noted that her husband's 20 demands have never been
published in the local press, but Soviet TV ran daily reports last
year on an American hunger striker in front of the White House.
   Gamsakhurdia's other demands include halting construction of the
Transcaucasian Railway and several hydroelectric dams, closure of
the polluting oil refinery at Batumi on the Black Sea, return of
the deported Meskhetian minority from Central Asia to their
homeland in Georgia, and restoration of university-level Georgian
studies programs.
   Authorities have taken action on only one of his 20 demands:
conversion of the Metekhi chapel from a concert hall to a place of
worship, his wife said.

   A quake rattled the metropolitan area,
including 30 people at an earthquake preparedness meeting who
thought the jolt was staged as part of their training.
   No injuries or damage was reported.
   The tremor, which measured 3.5 on the Richter scale, struck
Wednesday afternoon and was centered in the Pacific Ocean nine
miles west of El Segundo, said Bob Finn, a spokesman for the
California Institute of Technology.
   ``It was pretty strong. It was a rolling kind,'' said dispatcher
Kim Neil at the Santa Monica Police Department.
   The Santa Monica Emergency Services coordinator had just opened
the meeting in the City Council chambers when the tremor shook the
building.
   ``Everybody just looked at each other like, `Are they causing
this for the meeting?''' said Brenda Sweet, a reserve police
officer.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude. An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause
slight damage in the local area.

   Barbara Bush has called on the nation's newspaper
publishers to step up their efforts to fight illiteracy.
   ``We know the job of building a literate America is far from
done and newspapers have a crucial role to play,'' the first lady
told an audience of about 1,000 gathered at the American Newspaper
Publishers Association's 103rd annual convention on Wednesday.
   Mrs. Bush's talk came on the final day of the three-day meeting,
which President Bush addressed Monday.
   Mrs. Bush plans to direct much attention to the nation's
literacy problems during her husband's presidency.
   ``Tens of millions of Americans will never pick up a
newspaper,'' and that has obvious implications for the industry,
she told the publishers.
   She said one of the main thrusts of literacy programs should be
family literacy, ``where it all begins.''
   ``Parents are their children's first role models,'' and
illiterate parents are likely to raise children who cannot read or
write, the first lady said.
   ``To break this cycle of despair we have to establish literacy
as a value in every American family.''
   She gave several examples of disadvantaged people across the
country, who, with the help of literacy programs, have gotten off
welfare and continued their educations.
   One woman, Evelyn Vega, 29, of Stamford, Conn., was a
third-generation welfare mother who learned to read and got off
public aid last year with the help of a United Way literacy program.
   ``These are the stories of struggle and triumph that newspapers
nationwide have used to mobilize'' literacy efforts, Mrs. Bush said.
   Newspapers also should look within their own ranks in tackling
the problem, she said, citing the case of a typesetter at a
Washington, D.C., publication ``who could not read what she
produced.''
   The woman is an example of people who learn to cope and mask
their reading problems, but still must be helped, Mrs. Bush said.
   Los Angeles Times Publisher Tom Johnson, who spoke after the
first lady, cited his newspaper's efforts as an example of what the
industry can do to address the problem.
   The Times has organized a literacy program that includes centers
where children and their parents can learn to read, Johnson said.
   ``No profession is more affected by illiteracy than ours,'' he
said. ``The future of newspapers depends on the ability of our
citizens to read.''
   Johnson urged his colleagues to take part ``in an all-out
national campaign against illiteracy. Together,'' he said, ``we can
make a difference.''

   Beards, an ancient badge of wisdom and
virility, are vanishing from the halls of Congress. But a few of
the House members who are still sporting chin whiskers _ and proud
of it _ gathered to keep the faith.
   ``There'll always be beards,'' said Rep. David E. Bonior,
D-Mich., the undaunted chairman of the House Beard Caucus, whose
members convened in the House barber shop Wednesday to count noses
and admire each other's facial adornments.
   Only two others showed up _ Reps. Mickey Leland, D-Texas, and
Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif. The two remaining members, Reps. Ron
Dellums, D-Calif., and Floyd Flake, D-N.Y., sent their regrets.
   The dwindling ranks of the beard caucus, down to only five
members from about a dozen last year, surely make it one of the
smallest and least influential special-interest groups on Capitol
Hill.
   Indeed, Rep. Gary Ackerman, D-N.Y., says with a laugh that he
recently shaved off his distinctive goatee, which he'd worn for 17
years, ``when I discovered there was no PAC (political action
committee) that was interested in the beard caucus.''
   Bonior, who also is chief deputy whip for House Democrats, says
the caucus is a ``fun group'' that meets ``anytime we can get a
photographer to come and give us some free publicity.'' Its sole
purpose, he says, is to ``allow members to fraternize about the
politics of having hair on your face.''
   Bonior confessed that he shaved off his 10-year-old beard
briefly during the Christmas holidays. ``My family hadn't seen me
for 10 years, so I shaved. They didn't like what they saw, so I
grew it back,'' he said.
   Beards may not be an endangered species, as Bonior claims, but
they have fallen on hard times. Washington is full of earnest,
clean-shaven yuppies. The Senate hasn't seen a beard since Philip
A. Hart, the liberal Democrat from Michigan, died in 1976. There
hasn't been a bearded president since Benjamin Harrison left office
in 1893.
   In the turbulent Sixties, beards enjoyed a brief renaissance as
symbols of antiwar liberalism, but Bonior says they are a
``non-ideological growth'' today.
   Bonior might be right. Although he, Dellums, Flake and Leland
are all liberal Democrats, the bearded Rohrabacher is a staunch
Reagan conservative who won a House seat last November with active
campaign support from Iran-Contra defendant Oliver L. North.
   ``The experts told me that if I had any chance of winning, I had
to shave my beard and stay away from Ollie North. I refused to do
either, and I won,'' Rohrabacher said.
   Another conservative California Republican, Rep. Robert K.
Dornan, shaved off his beard and won re-election handily. But when
liberal former Rep. Mike Lowry, D-Wash., tried the same trick in
his bid for a Senate seat last fall, he lost.
   ``I had my beard for six years,'' Lowry said in a telephone
interview from Seattle, where he is teaching college and
reassessing his political future.
   ``I had it so long I was becoming identified with it. I was
tired of being a Yasser Arafat look-alike. Also, my mother hated
it.''
   Rep. Sam Gejdenson, D-Conn., shaved a beard he'd worn for six
months last year. ``During that time, I got more nasty mail over my
beard than over any other issue since I've been in Congress,'' he
said. ``Generally, they didn't like the way it looked, or thought
it was unclean.''
   Gejdenson, who intends to grow a new beard, believes the rise
and fall of their popularity has some mysterious connection with
the economy.
   ``When the stock market goes down, there are more beards, and
when the market goes up there are fewer beards,'' he observes.
``When I showed up for the 101st Congress, I was clean-shaven and
the economy was back up again.''

   The future of abortion in America will be on
the Supreme Court's discussion agenda when its nine members gather
for a closed-door conference Friday morning.
   First item: Must the court, in resolving an abortion-regulation
controversy from Missouri, plunge into its landmark 1973 decision
that women have a constitutional right to end their pregnancies?
   Although Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist may conduct an
initial vote Friday and begin the opinion-writing process, the
court's final decision likely will not be announced until late June
or early July.
   Missouri officials and the Bush administration are urging the
court to overturn or curtail the 16-year-old ruling in Roe vs.
Wade. And while speculating about the Supreme Court's direction is
always tricky business, questions from the bench in Wednesday's
argument session indicated three key justices may be willing to
undertake a broad review of abortion rights.
   Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin Scalia and Anthony M.
Kennedy _ all appointees of former President Reagan _ pointedly
asked lawyers for both sides about the dimensions of abortion
rights.
   ``Do you say there is no fundamental right to decide whether to
have a child or not? A right to procreate?'' O'Connor asked the
administration's lawyer. ``Do you deny that the Constitution
protects that right?''
   Scalia asked the lawyer representing opponents of the Missouri
law, ``How can you derive (a fundamental right) without making a
determination as to whether the fetus is a human life or not?''
   The justice added, ``It is very hard to say it just as a matter
of basic principle that it must be a fundamental right unless you
make the determination that the organism that is destroyed is not a
human life.''
   Kennedy asked the administration's lawyer about a 1965 Supreme
Court decision striking down a state law that barred use of
contraceptives _ the high court's first enunciation of the
constitutional ``privacy'' right which served as the basis for Roe
vs. Wade.
   ``Does the (1965) case stand for the proposition that there is a
right to determine whether to procreate?'' Kennedy asked.
   Of the justices considered strong supporters of abortion rights
_ Harry A. Blackmun, William J. Brennan, Thurgood Marshall and John
Paul Stevens _ only Stevens participated fully in the session.
Brennan asked one question; Blackmun and Marshall none.
   Rehnquist and Justice Byron R. White, dissenters in and
consistent critics of Roe vs. Wade, each asked several questions
but seemed intent on giving the three junior justices as much time
as they needed.
   Their questions could have zeroed in on the particulars of the
Missouri law's regulations. Many of them did not.
   The court, however, still could resolve the Missouri case
without reconsidering Roe vs. Wade.
   Such a decision still would be read as a barometer of the
current justices' commitment to the 1973 ruling, but might not
affect many women outside Missouri. Higher stakes would be left for
a future case.
   But the possibility exists for a broader ruling, one that
includes in its scope a nation in which 1.5 million legal abortions
are performed each year.

<HEAD>U.S., Soviets In Bitter Exchange Over Afghanistan</HEAD>

   The United States and Soviet Union traded
charges of hypocrisy, lying and bad faith in a blistering finale to
three weeks of debate on Afghanistan in the Security Council.
   The meeting adjourned Wednesday without resolution and no
further meeting was scheduled.
   The debate marked the first full-fledged council discussion of
Afghanistan since January 1980, right after Soviet troops
intervened in Afghanistan, replacing one Marxist government with
another and staying on to help fight a Moslem insurrection.
   The session began April 11 and included more than 40 speakers,
all of them calling for a political settlement and
self-determination by the Afghan people.
   Ambassador Patricia Byrne, U.S. representative to the council,
told delegates Wednesday, ``It is the height, or should I say the
depth of hypocrisy for the representative of the Soviet Union to
claim that the regimes in Kabul and the U.S.S.R. are fulfilling
their obligations under the Geneva Accords of April 14, 1988, and
that the United States and Pakistan have failed to do so.
   ``The truth is precisely the opposite ... distortion and
falsehood will not work.
   ``The whole world knows full well who created the dreadful
situation by its invasion of Afghanistan. The Soviet Union has at
least withdrawn its troops but it is seeking to lay the blame for
the chaos and continued suffering at the feet of others.''
   Soviet Ambassador Alexander M. Belonogov earlier delivered an
extensive and stinging rebuke to the United States for arming the
Afghan guerrillas with weapons transported across the border from
Pakistan.
   ``The world community ... has formed a very clear idea about who
is hypocritical and who has been lying in this hall,'' he said,
jabbing his finger in the air for emphasis.
   Referring to U.S. arms being supplied to the rebels through
Pakistan, Belonogov gibed, ``We don't believe babies are borne by
storks or come from cabbage patches, so how did these arms from the
territory of Pakistan get there into Afghanistan?
   ``Did they fall out of the sky, or were they brought by some
other force?''
   Neither the United States nor Pakistan admitted supplying
weapons, including Stinger and Blowpipe missiles and other arms to
Afghan guerrillas.
   ``The United States is not setting the best example (of respect
for international agreements),'' Belonogov said during an hourlong
statement.
   ``By supplying the Afghan opposition with weapons on Pakistani
territory, the United States has thereby been pushing Pakistan
toward a violation of the bilateral agreement between Pakistan and
Afghanistan.''
   That U.N.-mediated agreement between the two west Asian
neighbors, guaranteed by Washington and Moscow, calls for
non-interference in domestic affairs of Pakistan and Afghanistan.
It also provided for the Soviet troop withdrawal, completed in
February.
   Afghanistan and the Soviet Union say Pakistan violated the
accords by arming and training Afghan rebels in Pakistan and
sending them into Afghanistan along with weapons convoys. They
claim the Pakistani military, intelligence units, logistics
officers and militia are involved _ both directly and indirectly _
in fighting within Afghanistan.
   Pakistan denies it and says Soviet supply of weapons to the
Kabul regime has continued the warfare and suffering in
Afghanistan. Most Afghans reject the Marxist government in Kabul,
Pakistan says.
   Pakistani Ambassador S. Shah Nawaz said in response to an Afghan
threat of retaliation issued in the council Monday that his
government will defend itself against any aggression from its
neighbor.

<HEAD>Pope Heads To Africa For A Fifth Time</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEPHEN R. WILSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>VATICAN CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II heads for the troubled
island of Madagascar on Friday, where opposition parties have
declared a ``papal truce'' following violent anti-government
protests.
   The pope later will go on the French Indian Ocean island of
Reunion, to Zambia and finally to Malawi on his nine-day trip, his
fifth to Africa as pope and the 41st foreign pilgrimage of his
10{-year papacy.
   The visit comes seven months after his tour of five southern
African countries and underlines John Paul's emphasis on the
fastest growing segment of the Roman Catholic Church. The Vatican
counts 75 million adherents in Africa and expects the number to
reach 100 million by the turn of the century.
   Among issues he is expected to address are human rights, AIDS,
apartheid in South Africa, foreign debt, the environment, the
shortage of priests and the process of adapting African traditions
to a faith imported from Europe.
   In a papal first, John Paul will fly on the Concorde, although
the Air France jetliner that will take him from Reunion to Zambia
will not travel at supersonic speed because of the shortness of the
trip.
   Madagascar, a 235,000-square-mile island off southeast Africa,
has been the scene of turbulent demonstrations against the
government of President Didier Ratsiraka, who has been in power
since 1975 and was re-elected last month to a third seven-year term.
   At least five people have been killed and 74 wounded in the past
week in demonstrations by opposition parties, which accuse the
government of rigging the election.
   Opposition leaders said Tuesday they will suspend their
demonstrations during the pope's visit, recognizing the work of
John Paul and the church ``in favor of democracy and the rights of
man.''
   About 25 percent of Madagascar's 10 million people are Catholic,
and the church has spoken out against some of Ratsiraka's policies.
Vatican officials said the pope is expected to stress the need for
respect of human rights and political freedoms in Madagascar.
   Church-state relations improved in recent years after Ratsiraka
turned from many of his socialist policies to gain Western aid to
tackle a severe economic crisis and protect the country's unique
plant and wildlife.
   In Reunion, a French overseas territory where 90 percent of the
500,000 people are Catholic, John Paul will be received by Premier
Michel Rocard of France in the capital St. Denis and address
bishops from other Indian Ocean islands.
   The pope is expected to raise the issue of apartheid in Zambia,
a front-line state that provides headquarters in exile for the
African National Congress _ the main group fighting to end white
domination in South Africa.
   In a major document released in February, the Vatican condemned
apartheid _ South Africa's policy of racial segregation _ as the
``most systematic'' form of racism in the world.
   Vatican officials, previewing the trip on the condition of
anonymity, said Malawi could provide the pope the opportunity to
address the problem of AIDS, which is estimated to have stricken up
to 20 percent of the male population.
   In the past, the pope has urged compassion for AIDS victims. The
Vatican has condemned the use of condoms as a means of stopping the
spread of acquired immune deficiency syndrome, prescribing
abstinence as the best means of avoiding the fatal disease.
   Malawi, one of Africa's smallest and poorest nations, has been
strained by an influx of 650,000 to 800,000 refugees fleeing the
civil war in neighboring Mozambique. The church is inviting the
Catholic refugees to attend the papal events.
   The pope is scheduled to return to Rome on May 6.

   Brace yourself. In the Soviet Union, the cat IS
the hat.
   But the good news is that not all Soviets like felines turned
into fedoras, and in a kind of ``purr-estroika,'' members of a
Moscow cat club are in animal-loving Britain seeking advice on how
to promote better treatment of their furry friends.
   ``The position of homeless cats in the Soviet Union and in
Moscow is very difficult,'' said Nikolai Nepomnyaschy, vice
chairman of the Fauna Club.
   ``The sanitary inspectorate is very strict on homeless cats and
they destroy a lot of them. They poison them with different poisons
and they make hats out of them,'' Nepomnyaschy said.
   Dogs are no better off.
   ``It's not just cats they're after, but also dogs,''
Nepomnyaschy said. ``They're very bad people, even people who have
been setting up cooperatives'' to make and sell cat hats.
   Such profit-making cooperatives have become possible under
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of ``perestroika,'' or
social and economic reforms.
   While cruelty to cats is illegal in the Soviet Union, it's not
against the law to make hats out of them. ``Nobody is actually
going to punish you if you turn a cat into a hat,'' Nepomnyaschy
said.
   How did the problem start?
   ``As we don't have a tradition of looking after cats, some
parents buy cats for their children simply as toys. So it happens
that children can play with the cats until they get tired of them
and then they let them out into the street and parents don't say
anything about it,'' he said.
   Nepomnyaschy brought a film crew that is making a movie about
cats. They arrived Tuesday and will stay until May 2, visiting cat
rescue centers and talking to experts.
   ``Three or four years ago such contacts between our countries
would not have been possible. They probably would have said,
`You're completely mad. You can't do that,''' Nepomnyaschy said
Wednesday.
   ``It's only been possible since the process of perestroika
starting in our country in 1985-86.''
   Britain is the first non-communist country the club has visited.
   ``We couldn't have possibly not come to England, because there
are almost legends about how (well) people treat their pets,''
Nepomnyaschy said.
   ``We were very pleased indeed that we were approached to ask if
we would be willing to hold their hands a little,'' said Philip
Wood, deputy chairman of Britain's Cats Protection League.
   With uncharacteristic British immodesty, he said: ``We do have
quite a good international reputation.''
   Cats are increasingly popular in the Soviet Union, where perhaps
30 million people keep felines as pets, Nepomnyaschy said.
   Fauna Club, the Soviet Union's oldest and biggest cat club, was
established in 1986 and has attracted 1,000 members. Its opening
cat exhibit was attended by 80,000 people, he said.
   ``And the cats they were queuing to see were just household
cats,'' he said.
   The film is targeted at young people and will be shown in movie
theaters, and perhaps on television.
   ``The film we are going to make is a continuation of this
propaganda of the advertisement of cats,'' said Nikita Voronov, the
film's director and a Fauna Club member. ``We'd like to make a film
that shows that everything alive has a right to life.''
   Incidentally, it's not just tough being a cat in the Soviet
Union. Owning one isn't easy either.
   For starters, there's no canned cat food, said Nepomnyaschya.
The club recommends boiled hake, a kind of fish.
   There also are no covered cat litter pans, fitted plastic
liners, or mint-scented cat litter. Soviets use plastic
photo-developing trays filled with paper or sand, he said.

   Why shouldn't a crack at the fattest jackpot in
North America create a ticket-buying frenzy? How else can you turn
a one dollar lottery chance into a $100 million payoff?
   ``The lure of great prizes fires people up. There's a kick of
anticipation,'' said Abe Kramer, a psychologist who counsels
compulsive gamblers in New York City. ``The bigger the prize the
better, even though they don't have a snowball's chance in hell of
winning.''
   Pennsylvania's Super 7 Lottery drawn Wednesday night was worth
more than $100 million, the world's largest prize outside Spain's
$159 million pot divvied up in last December.
   The Pennsylvania prize illustrates how popular lotteries have
become since New Hampshire opened its game in 1964.
   Lottery sales are expected to top $15 billion this year in 32
states and the District of Columbia, up from an estimated $14
billion last year. Sales in at least eight states exceed $1 billion.
   ``The lottery is the poor man's stock market. It let's you
fantasize about the lifestyles of the rich and famous,'' said J.
Blaine Lewis Jr., president of the North American Association of
State and Provincial Lotteries.
   For $1, players of Super 7 picked seven numbers from one to 80.
The winner must match them against 11 numbers drawn. The official
winning numbers were 06; 16; 24; 34; 35; 37; 40; 41; 45; 60; 71.
   The odds of winning were 9.6 million-to-one, and the pot grew
because there was no winner for six weeks.
   Tickets were sold at a rate of 500 a second. In a scene
reminiscent of a gold rush, rabid prospectors invaded Pennsylvania
by car, bus and plane to queue up. It was as if an entire state had
gone mad.
   ``It's a dream, the fantasy of getting rich, of never having to
work again,'' said Don Baucum, a professor of psychology at
Birmingham-Southern College in Alabama. ``People get to carry
around a little extra glow.''
   Part of the fascination was getting a piece of the action.
   ``Not many people really expect to win. But somebody's going to.
Everybody wants to be part of the fun,'' said Russ Gladieux, acting
director of the New York state lottery. ``It's generated a
super-mega-jackpot.''
   Gary Zurenda, owner of Ticket Plus Inc., in Wilkes-Barre, Pa.,
put in four extra phone lines and ran ads in newspapers for
out-of-staters. He charged $100 for a minimum order of 50 tickets,
twice the going rate.
   Madelyn Rose Wallace came in person, spending $796 for roundtrip
air fare from Houston to Pittsburgh. ``I had a vision a year ago
that I won the largest jackpot in jackpot history. This is my
chance,'' she said.
   Steve Harris of Phoenix, Ariz., jetted in for tickets. ``It's
only once in a lifetime that you get to participate in the largest
gambling action in the history of mankind,'' Harris said.
   Promoters bill lotteries as benign entertainment, but critics
say players can spend their life savings or write bad checks to
cover debts.
   ``There's a dramatic increase in lottery addicts,'' said Valerie
Lorenz, executive director of the National Center for Pathological
Gambling in Baltimore.
   ``Gambling used to be immoral, sinful and illegal, associated
with greed and crime. The lotteries are promoting it as an act of
civic responsibility because it supports education, transportation
and elderly programs,'' she said.
   Lotteries were introduced as a way to raise money without
raising taxes. In a way of using a vice to fund a virtue, lottery
proceeds pay for senior citizens programs in Pennsylvania,
education in Ohio and California, and economic development in Iowa.
   But states pocket an average of 35 percent of lottery sales, and
the games account for only a small percentage of a state's budget.
   ``The lottery is a rather inefficient and ineffective method of
general revenue. But nobody wants to raise taxes. That's a dirty
word,'' said Roy Kaplan of the Florida Institute of Technology, who
has studied state lotteries for 20 years.
   ``I look at the lottery as the flip side of work. Gambling gives
the tantalizing thought of achieving success without work,'' Kaplan
said. ``It's an innocent diversion for a few days.''
   The sheer magnitude of a $100 million treasure, and the chance
to chase rainbows and get rich instantly has a strong American
appeal. But while a dollar may make you rich, it can also cost you
your privacy.
   Glen Stanley, a coal miner, won $5.6 million in the West
Virginia lottery in 1986 and spent $6,000 for a chain-link fence
adorned with a ``no soliciting'' sign. One stranger asked him for
$10,000 so he could buy new cars for his kids. A woman asked for
$10,500 to have her breast enlarged.

   Craig Thomas gave the Republican Party its
first victory of the spring by outdistancing Democrat John Vinich
in the race for Wyoming's at-large seat in the U.S. House of
Representatives.
   With 88 percent of the vote in and just 40 of the 334 precincts
left to report, unofficial returns gave Thomas 60,262 votes, or 53
percent, and Vinich had 49,435, or 43 percent.
   Independent Craig McCune received just 4,475 votes, while Daniel
Johnson, an independent who espoused white separatist views,
claimed just 413.
   ``Tonight the best man won,'' Guy Vander Jagt, chairman of the
National Republican Congressional Committee, said from his
Washington, D.C., office. ``Craig Thomas won the special election
for Wyoming's congressional seat because he was a better candidate
than John Vinich.
   ``Vinich and the Democrats started with enormous advantages. In
a campaign that was only 40 days long, John Vinich had a towering
lead in name identification and had an established campaign
organization that only five months ago nearly won a U.S. Senate
seat.''
   Before the polls closed, Howard Schloss of the Democratic
Congressional Campaign Committee complimented Vinich for his
campaign and touched on the Democratic victories in Indiana and
Alabama earlier this year.
   ``Our victories in Indiana and Alabama, and our strong showing
in the heavily Republican state of Wyoming, proves two things,'' he
said. ``One, the voters have responded to the Democratic message
and vision for this country.
   ``And two, the Republican strategy of divisiveness, hate and
gutter politics does not work, and the people will not accept it.
From Republican John Rice waving the Confederate flag in Alabama to
a Republican pollster spreading lies about John Vinich in Wyoming,
the GOP has proven _ and even flaunted _ their gutter tactics.''
   The special election was called to fill the House vacancy
created last month when Dick Cheney resigned to become defense
secretary.
   At stake in the election was Republican pride, as the GOP lost
special elections in Indiana and Alabama earlier this year.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Cheney's move from the House to the Bush cabinet gave Democrats
their best opportunity since 1978 to gain a seat on the
congressional delegation.
   The Democrats fielded Vinich, who has spent 15 years in the
Legislature and almost upset Sen. Malcolm Wallop last November. The
GOP countered with Thomas, who just won a third term in the state
House of Representatives.
   The short campaign centered more on negative political
portrayals than on specific philosophical differences. Both Vinich
and Thomas boasted of being fiscally conservative, in favor of
multiple use of federal lands, and concerned over health care
issues.
   Both oppose gun control and voted in the Legislature to restrict
public funding of abortions.
   Both support an amendment to the U.S. Constitution that would
let states restrict abortion. However, Vinich has been quoted as
saying abortion is a matter of personal choice.
   Thomas said he was the candidate who aligned best with Sens.
Wallop and Alan Simpson.
   ``The basic choice will be whether the people want continuity of
the conservative representation we have had or to move over to the
left of center and send a liberal to represent the state of
Wyoming,'' Thomas said often during the campaign.
   Vinich denounced Republican effors to paint him as a liberal
tied to big labor and stressed that Wyoming must be represented
within the majority in Congress.
   ``I want to be part of a team that makes sure Wyoming gets the
best from both sides of the aisle, from Democrats and
Republicans,'' he said.
   The National Republican Congressional Committee at one point
seemed on the verge of torpedoing Thomas' campaign. Ed Rollins, a
strategist hired to reverse GOP fortunes, early on declared that he
was calling the shots for Thomas.
   Vinich used those comments to charge that Thomas, a 56-year-old
businessman, had lost control of his campaign. The 38-year-old
Democrat also scored the Republicans for a telephone poll that
implied Vinich was a liar.
   Thomas countered by noting that the bulk of Vinich's campaign
contributions came from out-of-state labor groups. He portrayed the
Democrat as beholden to organized labor with little Wyoming support.

<HEAD>Report Says Few States Assure Safety of Lawn Care Treatments</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Millions of homeowners hire companies to treat
their lawns, but most states make no attempt to assure that workers
are properly trained and that precautions are taken against
chemical poisoning, says a public interest group.
   Public Citizen, a private environmental and consumer
organization, says its national survey found far too few state laws
and regulations aimed at protecting public health from hazards
posed by lawn care chemicals.
   As a result, ``millions of Americans may be unwittingly exposed
to potentially dangerous pesticides in their own back yards,'' said
Laura Weiss, who wrote Public Citizen's report on the survey.
   For example, the report said, nearly two-thirds of the states
have no requirement for either training or testing lawn care
employees. Two-thirds do not require that customers be provided
with information on potential hazards of the chemicals used. Only a
handful require notice before a lawn is treated or a warning that
it has been treated.
   Ms. Weiss also was the author of a recent report maintaining
that many of the chemicals used by the lawn care industry have the
potential of causing long-term health problems including cancer,
birth defects, liver, kidney or nerve damage as well as short-term
ailments.
   The industry has defended its use of the chemicals, saying the
companies only use them in accordance with safety instructions
supplied by the manufacturers and that the chemicals are approved
by the Environmental Protection Agency for lawn care use.
   ``We have to be registered and certified in most states,'' said
James Brooks, a spokesman for the Professional Lawn Care
Association.
   But Ms. Weiss says in her new report that while the EPA approves
chemicals and doses that may be used on lawns, some of the
standards may be outdated and there is little federal regulation of
companies that actually apply the chemicals.
   Federal regulations, for example, allow any company employee to
apply chemicals as long as the worker is under the supervision of a
person who is certified, but the certified employee need not
actually be present when the treatment is applied.
   For the most part, government regulation is just as lacking on
the state level, although the commercial lawn care industry has
grown into a $1.5 billion business servicing more than 7 million
households a year, the report said.
   ``Most states have failed to take the necessary steps to protect
public health from the hazards associated with law care
pesticides,'' said Joan Claybrook, president of Public Citizen.
   Here are some of the findings, according to the Public Citizen
survey:
   Only six states require both that advance notice be given of
scheduled lawn treatment and that signs be posted afterward. Those
states are Maryland, Massachusetts, Connecticut, New Jersey, New
York and Rhode Island.
   Maine and Iowa require the warning signs, but no advance notice,
while New Hampshire and Pennsylvania require the advance notice but
no post-treatment warning signs.
   A dozen states require lawn care company employees to pass a
state test. Those states are Arizona, Connecticut, Illinois,
Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico,
Tennessee, Utah and Wisconsin.
   Only in Indiana and Utah are lawn care employees required to be
both trained and tested under state-supervised programs.
   In most states consumers also are left without detailed
explanations of the potential hazards associated with lawn care
chemicals, said Ms. Weiss.
   Only Massachusetts, New York and Maryland require state
information sheets to be provided to customers. Seventeen other
states have some form of consumer information requirement, but in
many cases that amounts to merely providing the names of the
pesticides being used, the report said.
   ``This is inadequate because pesticide labels are often
difficult, if not impossible, to understand and do not tell the
full story about a chemical's known or potential chronic health
effects,'' said Ms. Weiss.

   Some of the Agriculture Department's federal
aid programs of last year have been kicked into gear to help
farmers through the 1989 version of drought and privation.
   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter announced on Wednesday the
reactivation of some of the key parts of last year's drought
assistance package, including permission to graze livestock and cut
hay from land set aside for conservation use under 1989 crop
programs. Those include programs for wheat, feed grains, rice and
cotton.
   The emergency measures will apply to Kansas and other states
where drought has hurt 1989 crop prospects and in counties where
farmers meet eligibility standards.
   ``Rain is what these states need, but I can't guarantee that,''
Yeutter said. ``However, I trust the assistance we are able to
provide will help.''
   Livestock and poultry producers also will be able to buy surplus
grain owned by the department's Commodity Credit Corp. at half
price. In a related program, CCC will help pay feed cost for
farmers who must purchase more than usual amounts of feed for
livestock.
   Yeutter said he had directed the Agricultural Stabilization and
Conservation Service to respond within 24 hours to requests from
the agency's state offices for drought aid.
   The emergency measures, he said, will ``have the potential'' to
make substantially more acres available to farmers for haying and
grazing this year and thus help stem any forced livestock
liquidations.
   Yeutter said he had also instructed the Farmers Home
Administration to sell hay at reasonable cost and take bids for
livestock grazing on farmers taken over by the agency in counties
where the emergency grazing of set-aside acres has been approved.
   Kelly Shipp, Yeutter's press secretary, said the aid package is
essentially the same as USDA made available during the 1988
drought, which spread by summer throughout most of the nation and
cut last year's harvests sharply.
   Asked if there were significant changes from what was offered
last year, Shipp said, ``Not really, it's pretty straightforward.''
   Shipp said that while Kansas is expected to benefit greatly from
the emergency assistance, farmers in a number of other states are
also expected to be eligible, including Iowa, Nebraska, Oklahoma
and Texas. Others are expected to qualify, too, she said.
   Yeutter also announced that a 1989 USDA drought task force has
been established, headed by Undersecretary Richard T. Crowder, who
oversees international affairs and commodity programs.
   The action followed Yeutter's visit April 14 to the hard-hit
winter wheat drought area, with Sens. Robert Dole and Nancy
Kassebaum, Rep. Pat Roberts, all Kansas Republicans, and Gov. Mike
Hayden.
   In a letter to Hayden, Yeutter said he had no authority to
extend to 1989 wheat producers the broader relief provisions in
last year's $3.9 billion Disaster Assistance Act, a move that had
been sought by the governor.
   The 1988 law included disaster payments to farmers who lost at
least 35 percent of their normal crop production.
   Rep. Dan Glickman, D-Kan., applauded Yeutter's decision but said
it was ``unfortunate it took him this long to respond.''
   ``It doesn't go far enough but at least it's a recognition that
there are people who need help,'' said Glickman, ``and from here we
can proceed to provide more help to them.''
   Dole said, ``These first steps can't take the place of a week's
worth of rain or a green wheat field but it's the best news yet
under the circumstances.''
   On Capitol Hill, meanwhile, USDA's chief meteorologist, Norton
Strommen, told members of Congress that except in the central Great
Plains, the weather outlook for crops has improved greatly.
   ``Conditions are much more encouraging than in 1988,'' Strommen
said.
   But he said the damage from a February freeze and lack of spring
rain has caused irreversible damage to a large part of the winter
wheat crop in the Texas and Oklahoma panhandles, west Kansas and
southern Nebraska.
   Strommen said he expects a more normal distribution of summer
rainfall and a weather pattern favorable to the spring planting
that is beginning.
   Despite the severe damage to the winter wheat crop in Kansas,
USDA and private analysts think the total U.S. wheat harvest will
be up substantially from last year when production dropped to 1.81
billion bushels.
   Unofficially, those put 1989 total wheat output at around 2.1
billion bushels or more. But that would not be enough to rebuild
depleted U.S. wheat stockpiles, siphoned off by export demand the
past year.
   On June 1, the beginning of the 1989-90 wheat marketing year,
the stockpile is forecast by USDA at a meager 549 million bushels,
down from 1.26 billion bushels a year ago and 1.82 billion two
years ago.

<HEAD>Turner Plans Ad-Free News Show for Schools</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A last-minute change of heart by Ted Turner
will keep commercials out of the news show for schools that his
Turner Broadcasting System Inc. plans to launch in August.
   The decision prohibiting ads on the new program from Turner's
Cable News Network puts the Atlanta-based company squarely at odds
with Whittle Communications LP, which has been testing a similar
news show with commercials.
   Educators who have criticized the Whittle program for letting
companies pitch candy bars and shampoo to a captive audience
applauded Turner.
   ``Ted Turner should be commended for responding to this ethical
concern,'' Gary Marx, an executive of the American Association of
School Administrators, said Wednesday.
   Turner said he initially had planned to help pay for the daily
15-minute news program for schools by getting companies to
underwrite up to two minutes of messages per show. The messages
would advocate such causes as safe driving and the importance of
staying in school.
   But Turner said he changed his mind after hearing Marx object to
that type of advertising while at a private breakfast Turner held
Wednesday for about 40 educators shortly before the news conference
to announce the venture.
   Turner said the show, CNN Newsroom, will cost millions of
dollars, but he said CNN was profitable enough to absorb it.
   Christopher Whittle, head of the Knoxville, Tenn.-based company
that recently completed a seven-week test of its Channel One news
service in six schools, said he still thinks his show with
commercials is on the right track.
   The money Channel One collects for advertising will be used to
supply each of the participating schools with about $50,000 in
video recording equipment, TV monitors and satellite dishes if
Whittle decides to expand the test nationally.
   ``We wish the cable industry the best of luck in its endeavor to
bring free news and information programming to schools,'' Whittle
said in a statement.
   But he added that Channel One ``successfully addresses what has
been the gap between need and delivery in the past by delivering
all of the components necessary to deliver news and information
programming to students.''
   Whittle is evaluating results of the test of Channel One and
hopes to decide by midsummer whether to expand the service to as
many as 10,000 schools nationwide in the fall of 1990.
   Turner is not supplying equipment to the schools, but will make
teachers' guides with tips on how to use the material available to
schools that have the right computer equipment to receive it.
   Three top cable operators _ Tele-Communications Inc.,
Continental Cablevision Inc. and Jones Intercable _ joined Turner
at the news conference to express support for his program and
pledged to see that schools in their areas each were equipped to
receive the show. The three operators serve about a third of the
estimated 50 million homes with cable nationally.
   Turner said he expected individual cable operators would decide
for themselves what to do if some schools cannot afford video
recording equipment or monitors.
   CNN plans to run the CNN Newsroom show before dawn every school
day so that teachers can record it and replay all or parts of it as
they wish.
   Whittle sends Channel One by satellite overnight to
participating schools and requires that the show be played once a
day throughout the school.
   Turner declined to say how much lost revenue his decision
against any advertising cost the new program.
   But some industry insiders said the commercial-free news program
could work to the entire industry's benefit by building up some
goodwill at a time when calls have grown for more regulation of the
industry.

<HEAD>Both Sides Find Reason for Hope in Abortion Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Both sides of the abortion issue are finding
grounds for hope as they await a Supreme Court ruling in a key
Missouri case that could alter the right of women to end their
pregnancies.
   Frank Susman, a St. Louis lawyer who urged the court Wednesday
to strike down a Missouri law restricting abortions, said he is not
conceding any votes among the nine justices.
   ``I have given up on no one,'' he told reporters after the
hour-long argument session that packed the courtroom and drew more
than 200 demonstrators and spectators outside the court building.
   Twenty-seven ``pro-choice'' protesters were arrested for
breaking through police barriers that lined the court building's
plaza.
   Referring to the court's 1973 ruling in Roe vs. Wade decision
that legalized abortion nationwide, Susman said he believed the
justices are now aware ``Roe works. You cannot put the cork back in
the bottle. You can't turn the clock back 16 years.''
   Missouri Attorney General William Webster, who urged the court
to uphold the state's abortion regulations even if it does not
reverse the broader 1973 decision, also said he was pleased with
the arguments.
   ``To the extent Roe works, you have to ask yourself why we are
standing in front of the court'' 13 years after the case was
decided and after numerous subsequent court rulings on abortion,
Webster said.
   He said the Missouri regulations are a lot less severe than the
``pro-choice'' forces claim and stop far short of outlawing
abortions.
   ``The debate has been polarized and exploited. Frankly, (the
Missouri law) just doesn't go that far,'' he said.
   Harvard law professor Charles Fried, a former top Reagan
administration official, argued in behalf of the Bush
administration. He urged the court to overturn its 1973 ruling, but
declined to speak to reporters outside the courtroom after the
argument session.
   The justices, who do not necessarily have to reconsider Roe vs.
Wade in resolving the Missouri dispute, gave little indication of
how broad their decision will be. They are expected to announce
their ruling by July.
   At one point, Justice Antonin Scalia _ a potential swing vote
along with Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and Anthony M. Kennedy _
asked whether the court must consider the nature of a fetus.
   ``Can you derive (a fundamental right to abortion) without
making a determination as to whether the fetus is human life or
not?'' Scalia asked the lawyers.
   The justices will take their initial vote in the Missouri case
Friday in a closed-door meeting. They will discuss their views,
beginning a process that will include drafting and redrafting
opinions.
   Molly Yard, president of the National Organization for Women,
said she was heartened by the discussion before the justices
because it focused in part on the link between abortion rights and
contraception rights.
   ``We've said all along the right to privacy is the same'' in
both cases, she said.
   She and others in the abortion battle agreed the court's ruling,
while potentially momentous, will not be the last word.
   Kate Michelman, executive director of the National Abortion
Rights Action League, said, ``While the attention of the national
press is on the Supreme Court today, it is important to keep in
mind that pro-choice activities are occurring all across the
country. We must take our message to the public today and tomorrow
and every day until we settle this issue once and for all.''
   James Bopp, general counsel to the National Right to Life
Committee, said opponents of the Missouri law ``are seeking to
expand the right to abortion. The question is whether the court is
ready to make that right more absolute.''
   A federal appeals court, relying on Roe vs. Wade, struck down
major provisions of the Missouri law as unconstitutional. The law
banned use of public hospitals for performing abortions not
necessary to save a woman's life; prohibited any public employee
from performing or assisting an abortion or ``encouraging or
counseling'' women to have abortions; and required doctors to
determine whether a fetus older than 19 weeks is capable of
surviving outside the womb by, for example, testing lung maturity.

<HEAD>Man Accused Of Murder Marries Potential Witness Against Him</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANSFIELD, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man accused of murder and a potential
witness against him held hands through the jail bars that separated
them as they were married, and now she cannot be forced to testify
against him.
   Jacqueline Jonet Thomas on Wednesday married Cedric Burton, who
is charged with first-degree murder in the death of a car salesman.
The victim was kidnapped during a test drive, robbed and shot.
   DeSoto Parish District Attorney Don Burkett, who tried
unsuccessfully to get the courts to forbid the ceremony until after
the trial, said Burton will still be tried for the death of Michael
Wade Langton.
   ``It would not be appropriate for me to comment on the evidence
in a case before it is tried, but the marriage of the witness will
have absolutely no effect on the case going forward,'' Burkett
said. ``It is fixed for trial on June 26, and it will go to trial
on June 26.''
   Burkett had said earlier that Thomas was living with Burton when
Langton was slain, and her testimony could destroy Burton's alibi
against charges of murder, aggravated kidnapping and armed robbery.
   Under state law, someone cannot be compelled to testify against
a spouse.
   Thomas got a marriage license Tuesday at the parish clerk's
office. On Wednesday, state District Judge Claude R. Sledge waived
the required 72-hour waiting period. The couple said their vows a
few hours later before a Baptist clergyman.
   Two jailers served as witnesses and other jail employees
gathered around for the double-ring ceremony.
   The couple won the right to marry April 12, when the 2nd Circuit
Court of Appeal in Shreveport upheld Sledge's ruling that the state
lacked the authority to prevent someone from marrying.
   Jail Administrator Jerry Lowe spent several days calling
ministers before he found one willing to marry the couple.
   Burton said on April 19 that he had changed his mind and wanted
to postpone the wedding. But after talking with Thomas last
weekend, he told Lowe he was ready to proceed with the marriage.

<HEAD>Intelligence Committee to Investigate Non-Release of Documents</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate Intelligence Committee will try to
determine why congressional Iran-Contra investigators were not
given crucial Reagan administration documents that turned up during
the trial of Oliver North.
   The documents, which were missed during a supposedly thorough
search of administration files during the panel's 1987
investigation, portray far more clearly than previously known the
involvement of Reagan and then-Vice President George Bush in aid to
the Nicaraguan rebels throughout 1985.
   Three former members of the Senate investigating panel said in a
letter to Intelligence Committee Chairman David Boren, D-Okla., and
Vice Chairman William Cohen, R-Maine, that a quick staff review
found four documents introduced as evidence in North's trial that
they had never seen before.
   Two other documents released at the trial are similar to ones in
the committee's files, but include important attachments or
notations that are missing from the committee versions.
   One document, an April 25, 1985, memo from then-national
security adviser Robert McFarlane, recommends that Reagan telephone
Honduran President Roberto Suazo to reassure him of U.S. backing
for the Contras. Missing from the congressional copy is the
notation, ``cc Vice President,'' apparently showing that Bush was
sent a copy of the memo.
   ``These six documents are sufficient to raise questions about
the procedures followed by the executive branch in providing
documents to the Iran-contra Committee and the completeness of its
compliance with agreements on the provision of documents,'' the
letter stated.
   The request was signed by Senate Majority Leader George
Mitchell, D-Maine, and Sens. Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii, and Warren
Rudman, R-N.H., the chairman and vice chairman of the Senate
Iran-Contra panel.
   Boren, in a statement, promised to ``look at this matter
expeditiously and in a businesslike, non-political manner.''
   Responding for the Bush administration, White House Counsel C.
Boyden Gray wrote Mitchell on Wednesday: ``We have confidence that
the last administration followed the agreed procedures (for
releasing the material) and that its representatives will be able
to address your concerns. We, of course endeavor to be as helpful
as we can.''
   The letter from the senators said some of the documents contain
key evidence about the way U.S. officials conducted policy in
Central America in 1985 ``and raise questions regarding ...
possible efforts to circumvent the provisions of the law'' which
barred direct or indirect U.S. aid to the Nicaraguan rebels.
   One of the documents, a Feb. 20, 1985, memo from North to
McFarlane, states it is ``very clear'' that the law forbids any
direct or indirect military aid for the Contras. That is at odds
with testimony by North and other administration during the
congressional hearings that they had believed they had found a
loophole to get around the law.
   A similar request for an investigation was made two weeks ago by
Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., who was chairman of the House
Iran-Contra committee. An aide to Hamilton said Wednesday that he
had not yet received a response to his request, which was directed
to Gray.
   Congressional investigators ultimately concluded in November
1987 that a ``cabal of ... zealots'' in the Reagan administration
seized control of policy in the affair which sent weapons to Iran
and profits from the sales to the Nicaraguan rebels.
   Despite the documents released in the North case, former
committee counsel Mark Belnick, now a New York attorney, said he
does not believe that conclusion would have been much different had
the documents been turned over.
   ``The documents were clearly called for, we would like to have
had them and they would have led to additional questions,'' he
said. ``But if this is the sum and substance ... they wouldn't have
materially changed any of the conclusions'' reached by
investigators, he said.
   Among documents which the congressional panels did not receive:
   _A Feb. 19, 1985, memo for Reagan outlining a plan to step up
U.S. aid to Honduras in return for its support of the Contras, and
proposing that an emissary go to Honduran President Suazo and
``very privately'' outline the link between U.S. aid and help for
the rebels. Approval of the proposal is initialed, ``RR.''
   _A memo dated Feb. 20, 1985, from North and NSC official Raymond
Burghardt to McFarlane noting that the emissary to Honduras would
be needed to keep the request to aid the Contras secret from
Congress.
   _An Oct. 30, 1985, memo from North to McFarlane outlining plans
for reconnaissance flights over Nicaragua and mentioning plans to
airdrop two recoilless rifles to the rebels.
   _A Feb. 22, 1985 memo outlining plans for delivery to Suazo of a
Reagan letter promising support for Honduras if needed against
Nicaraguan military attack and saying, ``I hope that your
government will do all in its power to support those who struggle
for freedom and democracy.''

<HEAD>Army Engineer Corps Says Its Ships Outperform Soviet Skimmer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two dredging ships from the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers have been modified to provide clean-up crews with their
most effective weapon yet against the massive oil spill in Alaska,
Army officials say.
   The hopper dredging vessels normally pick up silt, sand and
other debris from the bottom of harbors. Off the coast of Valdez,
Alaska, however, the corps has shown that such ships can be altered
to suck up huge quantities of oil floating on the ocean's surface.
   The two dredging ships are ``the major oil pick-up vehicles up
there now,'' Robert W. Page, the assistant Army secretary for civil
works, said in an interview Wednesday, ``We are really forging
ahead with a new technology.''
   Over the past week, the hopper dredges ``Essayons'' and
``Yaquina'' have managed together to pick up roughly 3,300 barrels
of oil. That represents 36 percent of all the oil recovered since
April 18, when the 200-foot Yaquina arrived on the scene, Page
said. The 350-foot Essayons joined the Yaquina April 21.
   By comparison, Page continued, a Soviet oil recovery ship named
the Vaydaghubsky that volunteered last week with great public
fanfare to assist the oil clean-up effort has managed to reclaim
only about 250 barrels.
   ``We always knew these vessels were versatile,'' said John P.
Elmore, the chief of the corps' operations and readiness division,
adding it had taken the ships' crews only half a day to modify the
dredges for oil operations.
   The technology being applied by the Army corps is deceptively
simple and involves only the rotation of the draghead _ the
business end of a large boom that dangles off the side of the ship
and leads to a huge hopper on board.
   In normal operations, the draghead is dropped into the water and
pulled across the ocean bottom, sucking silt or sand into the boom
and up into the hopper.
   According to Page and Elmore, the corps initially experimented
by raising the boom and huge draghead level with the ocean surface,
with disappointing results. When that didn't work, the corps
decided to remove the dragheads from their booms, rotate them 180
degrees and then re-attach them.
   That simply turned the draghead and its huge suction mouth
upside down, where it could be placed just below the ocean's
surface and suck oil down instead of up.
   ``It's set up like a giant vacuum cleaner,'' said Page.
   The inverted system was tested by the Yaquina on April 20 and in
the course of just 15 minutes, the dredge sucked up 1,500 barrels
of oil, Page added.
   The Yaquina and Essayons are now attacking the oil spill, when
weather permits, by allowing smaller skimmers to corral a large
quantity of oil and then moving in with the underwater draghead.
   The oil tanker Exxon Valdez ran aground on a reef off the coast
of Valdez on March 24, spewing an estimated 11.2 million gallons,
or almost 267,000 barrels, of oil into Prince William Sound. The
vessel was carrying a load of Alaskan crude to a refinery in
California.
   The Alaskan authorities have charged the tanker's master, Capt.
Joseph J. Hazelwood, with operating the vessel while intoxicated,
reckless endangerment and the negligent discharge of oil.

<HEAD>Anti-Catholic Discrimination Charged in Fund for Northern Ireland</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CALLAHAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House members of the pro-Irish caucus say
Congress should renew support of an economic grant program in
Northern Ireland, but nationalist critics say the program must
first stop discriminating against the Roman Catholic minority.
   The International Fund for Ireland is an outgrowth of the 1985
Anglo-Irish pact. The program seeks to ease violence between the
Protestants and Catholics in British-ruled Northern Ireland by
improving economic conditions with special grants designed to
create jobs in the unemployment-wracked nation.
   Most of the fund's money has come from a three-year, $120
million U.S. aid package pushed by then-President Reagan and
then-House Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill Jr., D-Mass. Fund advocates in
Congress now are pressing for another three-year package to provide
$50 million annually.
   ``The fund is the only way the United States can play a
constructive role in Northern Ireland,'' said Rep. Brian J.
Donnelly, chairman of the Friends of Ireland congressional caucus.
He was joined by House Majority Leader Thomas Foley, D-Wash.
   Proponents cited new fund projects, such as one to build a
shopping center in a poor Catholic neighborhood outside of West
Belfast that has no local food store.
   But Father Sean McManus, national director of the Irish National
Caucus and a leading fund critic, said there is ``blatant, naked
discrimination'' against Northern Ireland's Catholic minority in
the distribution of funds. He called for a congressional
investigation.
   In County Fermanagh, one of six counties in Northern Ireland, 87
percent of the fund money went to Protestants while Catholics
received 10 percent, he said. The county's Catholic-Protestant
population is split 52 percent to 48 percent.
   Gerald E. Coleman, national information officer of the Irish
American Unity Conference, cited cases of abuse, including the use
of fund money to build luxury hotels, saunas, golf courses and a $2
million British government fishing vessel. He called for a
restructuring of the board to make it more independent of the
British-controlled bureaucracy in Northern Ireland.
   ``If St. Patrick headed the (fund) as currently structured, it
would discriminate against Catholics,'' Coleman said.
   Subcommittee members, including Reps. Gary L. Ackerman, D-N.Y.,
and Benjamin A. Gilman, R-N.Y., said they back continued U.S.
support of the fund, but expressed concern over the reports of
abuse and discrimination.
   ``My support of the fund should not be taken as blind faith,''
said Ackerman, who indicated that the House Foreign Affairs
subcommittee on Europe would look at placing new requirements on
U.S. contributions.
   Gilman said the accounting firm of Price Waterhouse is now
auditing the program for the United States. Results are expected
within several months.
   But Donnelly and Foley urged the subcommittee to provide $50
million in U.S. aid without new conditions or restrictions.
   Foley, testifying with Donnelly, said the subcommittee should
not be swayed by the arguments of McManus and Coleman because they
are opponents of the fund and the Anglo-Irish pact.
   The majority leader specifically attacked Coleman's appearance
before the subcommittee.
   Coleman, according to his printed testimony, was appearing on
behalf of his group and eight other Irish activist organizations,
including Irish Northern Aid. That group is registered with the
Justice Department as the U.S. agent of the Irish Republican Army,
a Catholic militant group, according to Foley.
   ``I don't think they should really be welcomed,'' said Foley,
adding that it was the first time he knew of that ``an agent of a
terrorist organization came before Congress.''
   Coleman said he was not a member of the IRA and that his group
did not advocate the IRA's violent activities.

<TEXT>
   Lawmakers are predicting a fight over
President Bush's proposal to develop two kinds of land-based
nuclear missiles and are targeting the committee chairman who
helped work out the deal without consulting colleagues.
   House Democrats who support the Midgetman missile on Wednesday
called the Bush proposal a ``sucker play'' that will ultimately use
financial constraints to eliminate the single-warhead missile they
support. Under the plan, a 10-warhead, rail-mobile MX missile would
be deployed first.
   But both supporters and opponents were upset with House Armed
Service Committee Chairman Les Aspin's failure to consult with them
on what they considered a deal between the White House and the
chairmen of the Armed Services panels _ Aspin in the House and Sam
Nunn, D-Ga., in the Senate.
   ``It is not a rebellion,'' Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., said
after a meeting Aspin held with about a dozen House Democrats. ``It
is a reminder to him that he was never authorized to make this kind
of deal.''
   The two-missile plan is putting Frank in the position of
supporting the MX, which liberal Democrats have opposed in the
past, in order to avoid supporting two mobile systems.
   Rep. Les AuCoin, D-Ore., said the meeting became a bit testy
when members pointed out that ``consultation is different than
notification.'' The Oregon Democrat said his colleagues left ``a
reminder card.''
   The genesis of the MX-Midgetman plan is Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney's original recommendation to move the nation's 50 MX
missiles from silos to deployment on railroad cars rather than
developing the Midgetman.
   But President Bush chose quick deployment of the MX and
research-and-development funding for the Midgetman.
   The Pentagon budget calls for $1.2 billion funding in fiscal
1990 for the MX and $100 million on the Midgetman.
   ``If you go through with those figures you might as well kiss
the Midgetman missile good-bye,'' said Rep. Nicholas Mavroules,
D-Mass.
   ``It's really a one-missile package,'' said AuCoin, who charged
that ``sequencing MX first is just a sucker play.''
   Aspin, chairman since 1985, said he spoke for himself in
discussions on the MX and Midgetman missiles. ``I was talking from
my own point of view and what was necessary to get through in the
House,'' he said.
   At the House Armed Services hearing with Cheney, Aspin sought
assurances that the Midgetman missile would not be squeezed out and
suggested possible legislation to ensure development of the
strategic weapon.
   Aspin also argued that the two land-based missiles are necessary
as a bargaining chip for U.S. arms control negotiators dealing with
the Soviet Union.
   ``This issue of getting a consensus on where we go on land-based
missiles is fundamental to whether we get a START agreement,'' said
Aspin, who told reporters he raised that point after Frank left the
meeting.
   Frank said he had consulted with Republicans Vin Weber of
Minnesota, Newt Gingrich of Georgia and Joseph McDade of
Pennsylvania about defeating the Midgetman.
   ``I think Les (Aspin) miscalculated the extent to which the
Democrats will fall in line,'' Frank said. ``And President Bush
miscalculated Republicans falling in line to support the Cheney
plan.''
   Weber, who called the plan to fund Midgetman a ``bad decision,''
said budgetary constraints and demands of various domestic programs
may force the hand of many lawmakers.
   ``While there has been debate in the House over MX vs. Midgetman
that debate has mainly taken place just among the defense
intelligentsia of the Congress,'' Weber said. ``The problem among
the rank-and-file membership has been increasing hostility to
defense spending.''

   Grunt the half-ton pig, whose abandonment
and near-slaughter touched the hearts of hundreds who wanted to
give him a home, will spend the rest of his days roaming a ranch.
   After sorting through about 300 offers nationwide that ranged
from making the porker a county fair mascot to a pig farm stud,
officials chose a ranch in Ojai, 75 miles northwest of Los Angeles.
   ``This place ... sounds like a perfect location, with other
animals there like donkeys, geese, all kinds of other animals,''
Gail Christensen, spokeswoman for the Los Angeles County Department
of Animal Care and Control, said Wednesday.
   Grunt was taken to the shelter last week after his owners
abandoned him in affluent Rolling Hills Estates because they were
moving. They gave their gardener permission to butcher him, but
Grunt was saved from becoming breakfast when his frightened squeals
alerted neighbors.
   At the shelter, the pig apparently liked the fuss.
   ``He seems to be happy about it,'' said animal care officer
Leslie Mitchell. ``In fact, he seems to be a big ham about it.''

   At age 75, the original Raggedy Ann
and Raggedy Andy dolls were beginning to look a little, well,
ragged.
   The dolls were removed Tuesday from their case at a Coral Gables
library and sent to New York for restoration.
   ``You could repaint the face and replace the clothes and make a
new doll, but that's not what we want,'' said Barbara Young, arts
services coordinator for the Metro-Dade library system.
   The dolls will be restored at a branch of the Smithsonian
Institution, and a textile expert will clean and mend them and
their clothes.
   They were given to the library by the late Myrtle Gruelle, widow
of Johnny Gruelle, who wrote and illustrated the Raggedy Ann books
first published in 1918 with the dolls as his models.
   Young noticed last year that the dolls needed to be restored.
She said in addition to the wear and tear from age, the pair had an
active youth.
   ``They were played with quite a bit by the children of the
Gruelle family,'' she said.

   Thanksgiving in April?
   Some Texans say a weary band of conquistadors was the first to
give thanks and feast.
   Amateur and professional historians of the Mission Trail
Association say the first Thanksgiving feast was celebrated near
present-day El Paso 23 years before the Pilgrims landed on Plymouth
Rock.
   The association plans to re-enact the April 30, 1598, banquet on
Sunday. About 6,000 to 8,000 spectators are expected, officials
said.
   Mission Trail president Sheldon Hall said he wants the
re-enactment to become an annual springtime Thanksgiving tradition.
   Hall found out about the Thanksgiving feast when he read the
account of Juan de Onate's 1598 expedition from central Mexico to
northern New Mexico. Onate had been appointed to take formal
possession of the Rio Grande basin in the name of Spain.
   Onate, 130 men, 270 women and children and 7,000 head of
livestock ran out of water while trekking through the vast
Chihuahuan desert. Five days after running out of water, they came
upon the Rio Grande. The group spent 10 days hunting, fishing and
recovering. Then, they sat down for a huge feast.
   Hall doesn't expect a change in the national observance of
Thanksgiving, but said he wanted people to know about the 16th
century meal in Texas _ or the ``historical correction'' of the
first Thanksgiving.

<HEAD>Analysts Say Kremlin Shakeup Big Win for Gorbachev</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The latest Kremlin shakeup is a ``tremendous
victory'' for Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, part of a
methodical consolidation of his power and purge of his opponents,
analysts say.
   ``It signals that Gorbachev is strong, and the Bush
administration cannot wait for two years to see whether he will be
in power,'' said Jerry Hough of Duke University in Durham, N.C.
   Gorbachev forced the retirement Tuesday of 74 of the 301 voting
members of the Communist Party Central Committee, and promoted 24
nonvoting members to full status.
   Although Gorbachev's maneuver did not entirely rule out a
backlash by Soviet conservatives, it appeared to guarantee him the
top job for several years, strengthening his hand at home and
abroad.
   President Bush and other administration officials, while
welcoming Gorbachev's efforts to democratize Soviet politics and
cut the size of the military, have warned that the Kremlin leader
could be removed from power before the reforms are carried through.
   Bush has adopted a wait-and-see attitude in reaching new
U.S.-Soviet accords, and administration spokesmen reacted
cautiously Wednesday to the latest Kremlin developments, simply
expressing hope that they will further reform.
   But private U.S. experts on the Soviet Union agreed that the
shakeup vastly strengthened Gorbachev's hand.
   ``One has to count this as obviously a tremendous victory for
Gorbachev,'' said Thane Gustafson, a Sovietologist at Georgetown
University in Washington.
   But, said Gustafson, ``what we have seen is a preemptive move,
that shows that Gorbachev is not entirely serene.''
   By purging the so-called ``Dead Souls,'' Central Committee
members who have lost the party and government jobs that won them a
spot on the policy-making body, said Gustafson, ``Gorbachev himself
was telling us that he faced a threat.''
   Only once since the 1920s has the Central Committee played the
decisive role in Kremlin politics, in 1957, when Nikita S.
Khrushchev summoned it to overturn a vote of the ruling Politburo
ousting him as party leader. Seven years later, the Central
Committee and Politburo agreed to dump Khrushchev.
   The removal of the Dead Souls was ``a clear victory for
Gorbachev, but not as decisive as it could have been,'' said
Marshall Goldman of the Russian Research Center at Harvard
University. ``It reduces the pressure he faces from conservatives.''
   Dmitri Simes, a Soviet emigre scholar at the Carnegie Endowment
for Peace in Washington, said the Dead Souls were ``a potential
pool of opposition'' who might have voted against Gorbachev in
favor of more conservative Politburo members, such as Yegor
Ligachev or Viktor Chebrikov.
   ``If you were Gorbachev, would you want one third of the Central
Committee to have nothing to lose by going after you?'' said Simes.
   The 24 nonvoting Central Committee members who advanced to
voting status include conservatives as well as reformers, said
Simes. The one thing the new members have in common is that they
owe their new status to Gorbachev.
   Gorbachev's latest action fits a pattern, including a Central
Committee plenum last Sept. 30 in which he removed a number of
aging Politburo members, including then-President Andrei Gromyko,
and shifted Ligachev and Chebrikov to new jobs. Gromyko lost his
Central Committee seat Tuesday, but Ligachev and Chebrikov were not
touched.
   ``What he has done as usual is to divide those that remain,''
said Gustafson. ``Now there is a big plum that he can dangle before
people, telling them, `You be good and I will make you a full
member Central Committee.'''
   Hough, who does not agree that Gorbachev faced a threat from
conservative Politburo members, viewed the Central Committee purge
as a calculated effort to strengthen the Soviet leader's hand at
home and abroad.
   ``He has been strong all the way through, since 1986, in my
opinion,'' said Hough.
   Soviet officials, said Hough, have fostered the belief that
Gorbachev faced a threat from Ligachev and Chebrikov.
   ``Now, they understand that this has had two bad consequences,''
said Hough. ``The stories about the Ligachev opposition were
unsettling both to U.S.-Soviet relations and to peasants who have
been reluctant to take out long-term leases.''
   Gorbachev so far has balked at decollectivizing land seized from
peasants in 1929-30, but instituted long-term leases to encourage
them to boost production and profits on land to which they have
exclusive rights.
   That program, key to Gorbachev's reforms and to increasing
Soviet food supplies, has drawn few takers among a deeply
suspicious farming class.
   ``If they are going to persuade peasants to take leases, they
have to convince them that there will not be a palace coup in two
years,'' said Hough.

<HEAD>Coast Guard Chief Says Valdez Was in Danger of Sinking After Spill</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Coast Guard commandant says the Exxon
Valdez likely would have sunk and created a worse problem if its
captain had succeeded in rocking the giant tanker off a reef where
it spilled 11 million gallons of oil.
   Adm. Paul A. Yost also praised Coast Guard Cmdr. Steve McCall,
who radioed a warning to Captain Joseph Hazelwood: ``I wouldn't
recommend doing much wiggling.''
   Yost told a news conference Wednesday that was sound advice for
the vessel that rested atop a pinnacle of reef in Alaska's Prince
William Sound with 42 million gallons of oil still in its hull.
   A transcript of the March 24 conversation between McCall and
Hazelwood was released on Tuesday after a Freedom of Information
request from the Anchorage Daily News.
   ``It's probable that had the ship gotten off the reef, it would
have sunk in position where it was in about 300 feet of water,''
Yost told a news conference.
   The remaining oil was transferred off the ship before it was
moved several days after the incident.
   It would have been much more difficult to remove the oil had the
ship sunk, Yost said.
   ``I don't know whether (Hazelwood's action) was
ill-considered,'' Yost said in response to a question, ``but I
think Commander McCall ... gave the captain some very sound advice.
I hope what (Hazelwood) ultimately did was in response to that
advice which was not to jerk that thing off the pinnacle.''
   The transcript showed that McCall warned Hazelwood to ``take it
slow and easy'' after the captain said he there was ``a little
problem here with the third mate, but we're working our way off the
reef.''
   The transcript shows that McCall warned, ``Before you make any
drastic attempt to get away, make sure you don't, you know, start
doing any ripping.'' He added that the tide was still rising.
   Hazelwood is charged with operating the vessel while
intoxicated, reckless endangerment and negligent discharge of
pollution into the water, all misdemeanors.
   Exxon earlier had estimated that 10.1 million gallons of crude
oil had spilled from the ship. State officials said it was 11.2
million and Yost confirmed it was more than 11 million.
   Exxon said Hazelwood was not on the bridge when the ship ran
aground but had turned over the tanker to his third mate, Gregory
Cousins, who was qualified to operate the ship but not licensed to
steer it through the sound.
   Yost said Hazelwood's reference to a ``little problem ... with
the third mate'' may have only been a reference to the ship's
having run aground rather than an indication of any other problem
with the third mate.

   ``Jane Roe,'' a Texas cleaning woman whose
pregnancy led to the 1973 landmark decision legalizing abortion,
watched quietly as the Supreme Court revisited her case 16 years
later.
   Recently emerged from the anonymity that had concealed her real
name and kept her away from the court when it decided in her favor
in 1973, Norma McCorvey was inside the Supreme Court on Wednesday
as an observer during its arguments on whether to overturn the Roe
vs. Wade decision.
   ``I'm very overwhelmed,'' she said later. ``I was just looking
around and trying to listen to the arguments. I was thinking, I
should have been there in 1973.''
   McCorvey, as Jane Roe, agreed to become a test case in the legal
challenge of anti-abortion laws when she became pregnant with a
second child in 1970.
   McCorvey, 41, answered questions with great difficulty and
stumbled through a nine-line written statement as she met with
reporters. Her present attorney, Gloria Allred, assisted her and
told reporters that McCorvey has only a modest income, cleans other
people's homes for a living, and has a 10th grade education.
   Allred, a feminist lawyer from Los Angeles known for her
flamboyance, has helped McCorvey put together a movie deal about
her experience. McCorvey is being paid as a consultant to the
project.
   She has been in hiding since April 4, when shotgun blasts were
fired at her Dallas home. She suspects abortion opponents were
trying to intimidate her.
   McCorvey disputed suggestions she has been used in the new case
and said she stepped forward at considerable risk because she still
believes in the cause of a woman's right to an abortion.
   ``Our law is in jeopardy for all the women of the United
States,'' she said. ``I have to protect Roe vs. Wade.''
   McCorvey said she considered an illegal abortion in 1970 but was
revolted by conditions at a back-alley abortionist's office she
visited.
   She didn't have an abortion. Instead she gave birth and put her
child up for adoption.
   Her lawyer said McCorvey considered the experience ``far more
traumatic to her than an abortion would have been.''
   Yet McCorvey said she has recently begun efforts to locate that
adopted child, whose conception triggered the landmark case.
   Allred insists there's no irony or inconsistency there. ``The
whole point is it's about a woman's right to choose,'' she said.
   So what would Norma McCorvey, once Jane Roe, say to this child?
   ``Well, I obviously wouldn't discuss politics right away,'' she
said. ``I'd just say, `I'm your mom. How about a hug?'''

   Here are excerpts from the Supreme Court oral
argument Wednesday in a case in which the justices are being asked
to overturn the court's 1973 decision, in Roe vs. Wade, that women
have a constitutional right to abortion.
   Missouri Attorney General William Webster: This case represents
a direct appeal that involves a 1986 Missouri statute defining the
rights of the unborn and regulating abortion in Missouri.
   Missouri's appeal involves three basic areas for this court's
review: The first, the constitutional boundaries on the limitations
of public funding; the second, the effect of and the facial
constitutionality of legislation declaring that life begins at
conception; and third, the ability of a state to require a
physician to preform tests and to make and record findings when
determining viability.
   Finally, we have asked this court to reconsider the standard of
review to be applied to state abortion regulation.
   Since 1973 this court has reaffirmed Roe vs. Wade's mandate,
state and lower federal courts have repeatedly interpreted that
mandate, frequently strictly against the states.
   One result is that the states have effectively been forbidden,
not only to prohibit abortion, but usually to regulate abortion in
any significant way. ...
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Webster: It seems to us a convoluted result to suggest that if
you can afford an abortion, we have to provide one for you in a
public facility but if you lack the financial capacity ... the
state and other public governmental entities are not obligated to
provide those services for you.
   Justice John Paul Stevens: Can I ask you one clarifying
question? What is the consequence of a violation of that section.
...
   What if a doctor who had a patient in a public hospital went
ahead and performed, in the first trimester, performed an abortion.
Is there any sanction against the doctor if he did that?
   Webster: This particular chapter (of the law) carries a general
misdemeanor penalty for violations ... but there is no operative
language. ...
   Stevens: So it would be a misdemeanor then?
   Webster: Arguably, it would be a misdemeanor.
   Stevens: What is your opinion? Don't you know?
   Webster: My opinion is that there is no language in that section
which was adopted here which would suggest that it would make it a
criminal offense. ...
   Stevens: Is it your opinion as the chief enforcement officer of
the state that it would not be a misdemeanor?
   Webster: We wouldn't view that violation as a misdemeanor, no.
...
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy: Wouldn't it be grounds for discharge
...?
   Webster: It is conceivable the hospital board could, if somebody
violated the policy of that facility, seek to discharge that
particular employee. ...

<TEXT>
   Charles Fried for the Bush administration: Today the United
States asks this court to reconsider and overrule its decision in
Roe vs. Wade.
   At the outset I would like to make quite clear how limited that
submission is.
   First, we are not asking the court to unravel the fabric of
unenumerated and privacy rights which this court has woven in
(previous) cases. ...
   Rather we are asking the court to pull this one thread.
   And the reason is well stated by this court ... abortion is
different.
   It involves the purposeful termination, as the court said, of
potential life.
   And I would only add that in the minds of many legislators who
pass abortion regulation, it is not merely potential life but
actual human life.
   And though we do not believe that the (Constitution's) 14th
Amendment takes any position on that question, we think it is an
utter non sequitur to say that, therefore, the organized community
must also take no position in legislation and may not use such a
position as a premise for regulation.
   Kennedy: Your position then is that Griswold vs. Connecticut
(striking down a state's ban on contraceptive sales as an invasion
of personal privacy) is correct and should be retained?
   Fried: Exactly, your honor.
   Kennedy: Is that because there is a fundamental right involved
in that case?
   Fried: In Griswold vs. Connecticut there was a right which was
well established in a whole fabric of quite concrete matters, quite
concrete.
   It involved not an abstraction such as the right to control
one's body, an abstraction such as the right to be let alone, it
involved quite concrete intrusions into the details of marital
intimacy. ...
   Kennedy: Does the case stand for the proposition that there is a
right to determine whether to procreate?
   Fried: Griswold surely does not stand for that proposition. ...
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor: Do you say there is no fundamental
right to decide whether to have a child or not? A right to
procreate? Do you deny that the Constitution protects that right?
   Fried: I would hesitate to formulate the right in such abstract
terms and I think the court prior to Roe vs. Wade quite prudently
also avoided such sweeping generalities.
   O'Connor: Do you think that the state has the right to, if in a
future century we had a serious overpopulation problem, has a right
to require women to have abortions after so many children?
   Fried: I surely do not. That would be quite a different matter.
   O'Connor: What do you rest that on?
   Fried: Because unlike abortion, which involves the purposeful
termination of future life, that would involve not preventing an
operation, but violently taking hands on, laying hands on a woman
and submitting her to an operation. ...
   O'Connor: And you would rest that on substantive due process
protection?
   Fried: Absolutely.
   Kennedy: How do you define the liberty interests of the woman in
that connection?
   Fried: The liberty interest against a seizure would be involved.
That is how the court analyzed the matter in Griswold. ...
   Kennedy: How do you define ... the liberty interest of a woman
in an abortion case?

   Fried: Well, I would think that there are liberty interests
involved in terms, perhaps, of the contraceptive interest ... At
all points it is an interest which is matched by the state's
interest in potential life. ...
   I would like to make clear that, in our view, if Roe were
overruled, this court would have to continue to police the far
outer boundaries of abortion regulation under a due process
rational basis test, and that test is muscular enough ... to strike
down any regulation ... which did not make proper provision for
cases where the life of the mother was at risk. ...
   Stevens: Is there a difference between the court's power in the
case of an abortion that would be life threatening to the woman and
an abortion that would merely cause her severe and prolonged
disease? Is there a constitutional difference?
   Fried: I think that is a matter of degree, and it is perfectly
clear that severe health effects shade over into a threat to the
life. I cannot promise the court that our submission would dispense
the federal courts from considering matter like that. ...

   Justice Byron R. White: Suppose there is a state that permits
abortions and they are done in public hospitals. Do you think that
is a _ you say that there is human life involved, that is destroyed
in abortions _ is there some problem about the state permitting
abortions?
   Fried: I think the Constitution takes no position on this point.
... The country's experience and the court's experience under the
constitutionalization of that issue has been so regrettable that I
could not in conscience recommend that it be constitutionalized in
some other way at another point in the spectrum. ...

   Frank Susman for those who challenged the Missouri law: I think
(Fried's) submission is somewhat disingenuous when he suggests to
this court that he does not seek to unravel the whole cloth of
procreational rights, but merely to pull a thread.
   It has always been my personal experience that when I pull a
thread, my sleeve falls off.
   There is no stopping.
   It is not a thread he is after.
   It is the full range of procreational rights and choices that
constitute the fundamental right that has been recognized by this
court.
   For better or for worse, there no longer exists any bright line
between the fundamental right that was established in Griswold and
the fundamental right of abortion that was established in Roe.
   These two rights, because of advances in medicine and science,
now overlap.
   They coalesce and merge and they are not distinct.
   Justice Antonin Scalia: You find it hard to draw a line between
those two but easy to draw a line between first, second and third
trimester. I don't see why a court that can draw that line can't
separate abortion from birth control quite readily.
   Susman: ... Things have changed.
   The bright line, if there ever was one, has now been
extinguished.
   That's why I suggest to this court that we need to deal with one
right, the right to procreate. ...
   Kennedy: Do you agree that the state can forbid abortions save
to preserve the life of the mother after the fetus is, say, eight
months old? Suppose the health rights of the mother are not
involved? ...
   Susman: Yes, I am willing to recognize the compelling interest
granted in Roe of a state in potential fetal life after the point
of viability.
   Kennedy: But that is a line drawing, isn't it?
   Susman: Yes, it is. But that is a line that is more easily
drawn. ...
   Procreational interests are, indeed, implicit in the concept of
ordered liberty and neither liberty nor justice would exist without
them.
   It is truly a liberty whose exercise is deeply rooted in this
nation's history and tradition. ...
   I suggest that there can be no ordered liberty for women without
control over their education, their employment, their health, their
childbearing and their personal aspirations.
   There does, in fact, exist a deeply rooted tradition that the
government steer clear of decisions affecting the bedroom,
childbearing and the doctor-patient relationship as it pertains to
these concerns.
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist: It is a deeply rooted
tradition, but surely abortion was regulated by the state in the
19th century and in the 20th century. ...

   Scalia: Let me inquire _ I can see deriving a fundamental right
from either a long tradition that this, the right to abort, has
always been protected. I don't see that tradition. But I suppose
you could also derive a fundamental right just simply from the text
of the Constitution plus the logic of the matter, or whatever.
   How can you derive it that way here without making a
determination as to whether the fetus is a human life or not? It is
very hard to say it just is a matter of basic principle that it
must be a fundamental right unless you make the determination that
the organism that is destroyed is not a human life. Can you as a
matter of logic or principle make that determination otherwise?
   Susman: I think the basic question ... whether this is a human
life or whether human life begins at conception, is not something
that is verifiable as a fact. It is a question verifiable only by
reliance upon faith.
   It is a question of labels.
   Neither side in this issue and debate would ever disagree on the
physiological facts.
   Both sides would agree as to when a heartbeat can first be
detected. Both sides would agree as to when brain waves can first
be detected.
   But when you come to try to place the emotional labels on what
you call that collection of physiological facts, that is where
people part company.
   Scalia: I agree with you entirely but what conclusion does that
lead you to? That, therefore, there must be a fundamental right on
the part of the woman to destroy this thing that we don't know what
it is. Or, rather, that whether there is or isn't is a matter that
you vote upon. Since we don't know the answer, people have to make
up their minds the best they can.
   Susman: The conclusion to which it leads me is ... it must be
left as a fundamental right. ...
   Women do not make these decisions lightly. They agonize over
them. And they take what we see out front (of the building) and
what we see in the media and they personalize it.

   Here, at a glance, are the views of each
Supreme Court member on the court's 1973 decision, reached by a 7-2
vote, that women have a constitutional right to abortion.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>SUPPORTERS</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   _Justice Harry A. Blackmun, 80. He authored the landmark Roe vs.
Wade opinion and is its most impassioned champion on the court. He
told a law school audience last fall the court might reverse the
1973 ruling this term. ``You can count the votes,'' he said.
   _Justice William J. Brennan, 82. A Roman Catholic, he reportedly
steered the court's closed-door deliberations that led to the 1973
ruling and joined in Blackmun's majority opinion.
   _Justice Thurgood Marshall, 80. He is the third remaining member
of the Roe vs. Wade majority.
   _Justice John Paul Stevens, 69. Since joining the court in 1975,
he consistently has voted to uphold the abortion right.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>OPPONENTS</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   _Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, 64. He was a dissenter in
1973 and, in subsequent abortion rulings, has voted to give states
far greater authority to regulate abortions.
   _Justice Byron R. White, 71. Also a dissenter from Roe vs. Wade,
he said in subsequent abortion opinions that the 1973 decision
``essentially created something out of nothing.''
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>SWING VOTES</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   _Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, 59. In a dissenting vote in 1986,
she favored giving states more authority in regulating abortions
and criticized the legal approach taken by Blackmun in 1973. But
she never has said that women do not have such a constitutional
right.
   _Justice Antonin Scalia, 53. He never participated in an
abortion case as a federal appeals court judge, and since joining
the high court in 1986 has taken no public stand on abortion.
   _Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, 52. Although a federal appeals
court judge for 12 years before joining the high court last year,
he never has ruled in an abortion case nor stated his views
publicly on the issue.

<TEXT>
   A father tearfully unhooked his comatose baby
son's life-support system early Wednesday, then took him into his
arms and kept hospital workers at gunpoint until the child was
dead, authorities said.
   ``I'm not here to hurt anyone. I'll only hurt you if you try to
plug my baby back in,'' police quoted Rudy Linares as saying.
   ``You can understand the motivation,'' police Sgt. William
Rooney said. ``I guess he didn't want his child to continue living
under those conditions.''
   The painter from west suburban Cicero was charged with murdering
his 16-month-old son, Samuel, said Lisa Howard, spokeswoman for the
Cook County state's attorney's office.
   ``This is the best thing,'' Linares' wife, Tamara, told radio
station WBBM-AM. ``Sammy is out of his misery.''
   At an evening court hearing, a judge ordered Linares released on
a $75,000 recognizance bond, which means he does not have to post
money unless he fails to appear at future hearings.
   But his release was delayed until early Thursday, when his
family raised $1,000 bail for an oustanding warrant from an
unrelated incident in Cicero.
   Assistant State's Attorney James Piper, in arguing that Linares
be held in jail, told Judge Marvin Ruttenberg that the weapon was
cocked and Linares had threatened to ``kill anybody who
interfered.''
   ``We feel that showed that the defendant is a danger; that
life-threatening actions were taken toward the nurses and other
people,'' Piper said.
   Ruttenberg told Linares to appear in court again on Thursday.
   About 25 people turned out in support of him, including his
wife, and his mother, father, brother and family friends. Mrs.
Linares is not charged in the boy's death.
   The couple has two other children, both under 5.
   Linares also unhooked his son's life support system on Dec. 30
but staff members reconnected it, Detective Gary Bulava said. When
Linares arrived early Wednesday, he spoke briefly with security
personnel but was not searched, Bulava added.
   Doctors had notified the parents Tuesday that the child was to
be transferred to a long-term care unit, said Rush-Presbyterian-St.
Luke's Medical Center spokeswoman Carolyn Reed.
   Police said Linares and his wife walked into the hospital about
1 a.m. and were escorted to the pediatric intensive care unit,
where their son's breathing had been sustained by a ventilator
since an accident in August.
   About 20 minutes later, after his wife left the room for a drink
of water, Linares pulled out a .357-caliber Magnum handgun, ordered
hospital staff out of the unit, unhooked the infant from the
life-support system and sat with his son in his arms.
   One nurse disregarded Linares' order and attempted to reconnect
the system, but left the room when he cocked the hammer of the
handgun, police said.
   Three other youngsters were in the unit while about a half-dozen
security personnel called by a nurse stood helpless just outside
the room, said Rush-Presbyterian spokeswoman Carolyn Reed.
   Linares eventually allowed nurses to enter the unit and remove
the three other youngsters. After about 30 minutes, his own child
was dead, Rooney said.
   ``He never pointed the gun at anyone other than the child,''
said Rooney. ``He sat there in a chair until the baby had expired,
then turned the gun over to the officers.''
   Linares was ``calm at times ... he did a lot of crying,'' said
Bulava.
   Linares had unhooked his son's life support system during a Dec.
30 visit, and staff members had reconnected the breathing
apparatus, Bulava said. Linares had spoken with security personnel
and received required clearance when he arrived in at the hospital,
but was not searched.
   Police and hospital spokeswoman Carmine Esposito said no charge
resulted from the earlier incident because police had not been
notified. ``The child's condition wasn't changed,'' Ms. Esposito
said.
   Lineras had been arrested on misdemeanor charges three times in
recent years, but the counts were unrelated in nature to
Wednesday's charge, said a law enforcement source with knowledge of
the case. Lineras was never convicted, said the source, who spoke
on condition of anonymity.
   Hospital spokeswoman Reed said Samuel was taken to
Rush-Presbyterian by ambulance last August with a blocked windpipe
after he swallowed an object, believed to be either a balloon or a
small piece of aluminum foil.
   Oxygen deprivation left him ``partially brain dead,'' according
to Ms. Reed, and Samuel had been in a coma since his arrival. Mrs.
Linares said doctors worked 12 hours to resuscitate her son then,
despite their pleas to the contrary.
   In the working-class neighborhood where the Linareses live,
neighbors expressed both resignation and surprise.
   ``They were very, very polite people,'' said Bernice Kielb, who
lived two doors away. ``I can't imagine what possessed him unless
he got a bill in the mail. You can't say he didn't love that baby.''
   Across the street, Diana Munoz said she had asked Linares on
Tuesday how the baby was doing and he responded with a shrug,
``Still the same.''
   ``It shocked me,'' she added. ``He was too nice of a guy.''
   Mrs. Munoz also said Linares talked often of the child, telling
her recently the couple already had made funeral arrangements for
Samuel.

<HEAD>Political Appointees Taking Over Some Career Civil Service Jobs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of a House panel dealing with
federal workers is calling on the Bush administration to reduce the
number of mid-level government jobs that are given to political
appointees.
   Rep. Gerry Sikorski, D-Minn., issued the plea on Wednesday along
with a congressional report that shows political appointees are
taking over mid-level federal jobs traditionally held by career
civil servants.
   Sikorski chairman of the human resources subcommittee of the
Committee on Post Office and Civil Service, released a General
Accounting Office report showing that 64 political appointees in 18
agencies had recently been converted to career status.
   ``The increasing number of conversions of political appointees
into career positions is troubling, especially where ... (they)
infiltrate mid-level management positions traditionally held by
long-time civil servants,'' Sikorski said.

<NOTE>Bill Endorsed by House Interior Committee</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House Interior Committee has sent to the
full House legislation to improve the transportation of coal from
mines to distant power plants through pipelines.
   The committee approved the bill, the Coal Pipeline Act, on a
22-13 vote on Wednesday. It allows coal pipeline companies approved
by the interior secretary to use the federal power of eminent
domain to gain access to land so they can lay pipes.
   The technology has existed for years to use pipes to transport
coal mixed with water. The bill, which has yet to be taken up in
the Senate, covers such ``slurry'' pipelines as well as those in
the future using other media, such as natural gas, to transport
coal.
   ``This legislation will increase our energy security, create new
jobs, and provide much needed competition in the coal
transportation market,'' said committee Chairman Morris Udall,
D-Ariz.

<NOTE>FCC Allows Phone Company to Test Cable TV System</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A California firm has won permission to build
a coaxial cable TV system and permission to test a state-of-the-art
fiber-optic system that will allow customers to order movies every
15 minutes by phone.
   Wednesday's ruling by the Federal Communications Commission was
challenged immediately by the National Cable Television
Association, which said it appears to violate federal rules
generally barring telephone companies from the cable TV business.
   The FCC, affirming a preliminary decision last year, will let
General Telephone Co. build and operate the coaxial (bundled copper
wire) cable system in the Los Angeles suburb of Cerritos. GTE of
California also provides phone service to Cerritos.
   The FCC said the permission was justified because there had been
no adequate bids submitted to the city of Cerritos for cable
service except from General Telephone. GTE is leasing the system to
Apollo CableVision to provide programming.

   The vicious attack and rape of a jogger in
Central Park by a gang of teen-age hoodlums has left many New
Yorkers trying to make sense of a senseless crime.
   The victim, a 28-year-old investment banker, remains in a coma.
Eight of her alleged attackers, ages 14 to 17, are in custody. Two
were indicted Wednesday and indictments against the others were
expected today.
   But by some accounts, the youths seemed unlikely attackers
although several came from broken homes and all lived in a Harlem
neighborhood surrounded by drugs, alcohol, crime and poverty.
   ``I deal with kids in trouble, these were not kids in trouble,''
said Bernard Diamond, principal of the junior high school two of
the boys attended. ``They come from homes of parents who care,
parents who are as shocked as we are.''
   Their victim was on a solitary jog in the northern end of the
park the night of April 19. She was beaten unconscious with a lead
pipe and rock, raped and left bound and nearly naked. She was found
several hours later.
   Doctors at Metropolitan Hospital, where she has been in critical
condition in a coma since the attack, say that although she may
survive it's unlikely she will ever recover completely.
   The woman apparently was one of several targets of the gang as
it went ``wilding'' through the park that night.
   The term was a new one to the police, but not the activity. For
years, loosely organized packs of marauding youths have roamed the
streets and parks bullying, robbing and attacking victims at random.
   ``I ain't going to say it's fun. It's getting your anger out at
somebody. It's like stealing fruit. It's not 'cause you are
hungry,'' a 15-year-old boy who said he was a friend of one of the
suspects told The New York Times.
   The assailants reportedly used racial epithets in one of eight
assaults during the rampage and discussed ``getting whitey'' or
``getting a white jogger.'' The victim is white and the accused
attackers are black.
   However, law enforcement experts say victims of the so-called
``wolf packs'' are more often black than white, and the lawyer for
one of the youths denied the boy suggested the gang go after a
white victim.
   The suspects are being held on charges of attempted murder, rape
and assault and could face other charges.
   Lisa Whitten of the national board of the Association of Black
Psychologists said the violence of city life allowed the boys to
bury normal emotions in the frenzy of their attack.
   ``They're human beings who went berserk,'' she said. ``They had
fantasies in their minds _ of being like those on television, the
ones who shoot people, who are powerful, in control, macho,
aggressive, strong.''
   Police said only one of the suspects _ 17-year-old Michael
Brisco _ had a police record. But friends said he was a frequent
churchgoer who played drums for the choir.
   After their arrests, Brisco and Kharey Wise, 16, were roughed up
in an attack by several other inmates and Yusef Salaam, 15, was
attacked by another youth at the Spofford Juvenile Center.
   Tim Burns, a 15-year-old schoolmate of suspect Anton McCrary,
15, said: ``He's a good kid, he just followed the wrong crowd. If
you're in the wrong crowd, this could happen to anybody. You have
to make your own decisions, that's all.''
   Since the attack, hundreds of runners, neighbors of the
suspects, friends of the woman and other New Yorkers have gathered
in the park and outside the hospital to pray for the victim.
   ``We're here today to pray in sympathy with the victim and her
family,'' William S. Perkins, president of the residents' council
of the housing development where four of the eight suspects live,
said at a vigil he organized Tuesday. ``Through prayer we can heal
the wounds on her body and the racial wounds this has caused to
society.''
   Friends and strangers have filled her room with flowers.
   The park has a reputation _ largely undeserved police and city
officials say _ of being a dangerous place.
   ``It's notorious because it is Central Park. If this had
happened in the streets, it wouldn't be anything like this,'' said
Eva Haws, who takes tourists on carriage rides through the park.

<HEAD>Confusion Over Takeshita Successor, Panel Recommends Fund-Raising
Changes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERRIL JONES</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The governing party rammed the 1989 budget through
committee today, setting the stage for Prime Minister Noboru
Takeshita to fulfill his pledge to resign to take responsibility
for the Recruit corruption scandal.
   But the question of who will be Japan's next prime minister was
thrown into confusion as the top contender, former Foreign Minister
Masayoshi Ito, said he would decline any offer to succeed Takeshita.
   An advisory board to the the prime minister today recommended an
overhaul of regulations governing politicians' fund-raising to
avoid the conflict of interest and influence-peddling that have
dogged Takeshita's administration.
   Takeshita pledged Tuesday to resign after the budget's passage
to take responsibility for the Recruit Co. stock-profiteering and
bribery scandal, which has buffeted his administration for 10
months.
   The Budget Committee of the House of Representatives, Japan's
powerful lower house, took just one minute to approve the budget.
The session was boycotted by opposition party members.
   Japanese lawmakers like to operate by consensus so the boycott
was seen as more than just symbolic.
   Takeshita's Liberal Democratic Party was expected to force the
budget through Parliament on Friday, again in the absence of the
opposition, which is demanding new parliamentary elections and that
former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone be summoned to testify
about his role in the scandal.
   There still was no clear successor to Takeshita, as many senior
Liberal Democratic leaders are linked to the scandal.
   Ito, widely viewed as the top candidate for interim premier,
said today that he would not serve due to poor health. Ito, 76, has
heart problems caused by diabetes.
   Takeshita met Wednesday with Shintaro Abe, secretary general of
the governing party, and the two agreed to decide after a holiday
week that ends May 6 on a new party president, who will
automatically become prime minister.
   Ito told reporters that Masaharu Gotoda, an ex-chief of the
national police who served as the top Cabinet aide to Nakasone,
might be an appropriate choice. Gotoda, 76, now heads an ethics
panel appointed by Takeshita and comprised of members of the
governing party.
   Another blue-ribbon panel made up of prominent members of the
private and academic sectors today recommended a series of reforms,
including requiring all members of Parliament to make public their
assets and banning them from trading in stocks or giving monetary
gifts at funerals and weddings.
   Currently only Cabinet members must divulge their assets. There
are no restrictions on lawmakers or their staff speculating on
stocks, and parliamentarians routinely spend huge sums on wedding
and funeral offerings to their constituents.
   Oppositionists blasted the Liberal Democrats' strong-arm tactics
on the budget, complaining that Takeshita's impending resignation
was not enough to resolve the Recruit scandal.
   The budgetary moves came a day after the suicide of a former
Takeshita aide who handled Takeshita's political funds.
   Ihei Aoki, 58, who had served Takeshita since 1958, was found
dead in his Tokyo apartment after he slashed his wrist and ankle
and hanged himself.
   It was in Aoki's name that stock dealings and a $384,000 loan
from Recruit Co., the firm at the center of the scandal, were
carried out.
   Aoki is among more than a dozen politicians and political aides
who bought shares of a subsidiary of Recruit, a giant business
services conglomerate, before they were offered publicly, thus
reaping huge profits. In all, more than 150 political, business and
media figures purchased the shares.
   The transactions, though not illegal, badly tarnished the image
of the governing party and Takeshita's admnistration. Three of his
Cabinet ministers resigned when it was discovered they or their
aides had purchased the stocks or received sizable contributions
from Recruit.
   A widely unpopular tax reform also forced through Parliament by
the Liberal Democrats earlier this year contributed to public and
political outcries against Takeshita, plunging his support rate to
historic lows _ 3.9 percent according to one poll this month.

<HEAD>Dollar Edges Highers, Share Prices In Tokyo Hit Record</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar edged up against the Japanese yen
Thursday, while share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange ended at
yet another high.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which gained
190.15 points for a 33,434.93-point record close Wednesday, added
another 65.90 points, or 0.20 percent, to finish at 33,500.83.
   The dollar closed at 132.05 yen, up 0.58 yen from the previous
day's 131.47-yen finish. It started at 131.90 yen and edged up
while ranging from 131.70 yen to 132.25 yen.
   Traders said the dollar opened higher in Tokyo following its
strength in New York, where a release of U.S. economic growth
figures boosted dollar-buying.
   The U.S. Commerce Department reported Wednesday the nation's
economy, as measured by its gross national product, expanded at a
robust annual rate of 5.5 percent during the first three months of
1989, the fastest pace in more than a year.
   Japanese investors were reluctant to make further purchase of
the currency due to speculation about an interest rate hike in
Japan as well as the Bank of Japan's market intervention if the
dollar rises further, said a trader with a major commercial bank in
Tokyo.
   Many investors are speculating that the central bank might raise
the nation's interest rate depending on the consumer price index
for March, which is to be released Friday.
   But a trader with the Bank of Tokyo, speaking anonymously, said
bullish sentiment for the dollar remains a basic trend.
   On the stock exchange, a moderate gain in the market's main
barometer followed a similar trend on overseas markets overnight,
dealers said.
   The Nikkei slowed down as some participants sold issues for
profit taking, said a dealer with a major securities firm in Tokyo.

<TEXT>
   A gun-wielding father who tearfully unhooked his
comatose son's life-support system and held him until the baby died
has been charged with murder for an act he said he committed
``because I loved my son.''
   Rudy Linares entered the hospital room of his 16-month-old son,
Samuel, and unhooked the boy's ventilator, holding hospital workers
at bay with a .357-caliber Magnum handgun, police said.
   ``No one has the right to take the law into his own hands,''
said Cook County State's Attorney Cecil Partee. ``The facts of this
case clearly dictate the filing of first-degree murder charges.''
   At the hearing Wednesday night, prosecutors said the 23-year-old
Cicero house painter should be held without bail on the murder
charge because the gun was cocked and Linares had threatened to
``kill anybody who interfered.''
   But Judge Marvin Ruttenberg ordered Linares released on a
$75,000 recognizance bond, which means he does not have to put up
any money unless he fails to appear at future hearings.
   The judge told him to return to court today.
   Following Ruttenberg's order, Linares was taken into custody by
police from Cicero on an unrelated December warrant of battery and
resisting a police officer.
   He was released early today after posting $1,000 at the suburban
jail, police said.
   Linares' wife, Tamara, joined close relatives and about 20
friends at the hearing.
   ``Nobody has a right to call him a murderer, because Sammy was
already dead,'' said Linares' 22-year-old brother, Robert. ``He was
hurting. Put yourself in his situation. It was his son.
   ``For eight months he went through so much pain and agony. ...
This was killing and eating my brother away inside.''
   ``I did it because I loved my son, alright? I love my wife,''
Rudy Linares shouted to reporters after his arrest.
   At 1:20 a.m. Wednesday, Linares ordered hospital staff out of
the pediatric intensive care unit at Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's
Medical Center, where the boy's breathing had been sustained on a
ventilator since August, police said.
   He then unhooked the boy from the life-support system and sat
crying with his son in his arms, police said.
   ``I'm not here to hurt anyone. I'll only hurt you if you try to
plug my baby back in,'' police quoted Linares as saying.
   Linares eventually allowed nurses to enter and remove three
other youngsters. Sgt. William Rooney said the child died about 30
minutes after the incident began.
   ``He never pointed the gun at anyone other than the child,''
Rooney said. ``He sat there in a chair until the baby had expired,
then turned the gun over to the officers.''
   Linares was ``calm at times ... he did a lot of crying,'' said
Detective Gary Bulava.
   Later, Mrs. Linares said: ``This is the best thing. Sammy is out
of his misery.''
   Linares had unhooked his son's life support system during a Dec.
30 visit, but staff members reconnected the apparatus, Bulava said.
   A police official who spoke on condition of anonymity said no
charge resulted from the earlier incident because police had not
been notified.
   Rush-Presbyterian spokeswoman Carolyn Reed said Samuel had been
brought to the hospital last summer with a blocked windpipe after
he swallowed an object, believed to be either a balloon or a small
piece of aluminum foil.
   Oxygen deprivation left him ``partially brain dead,'' according
to Ms. Reed, and the boy had been in a coma since his arrival eight
months ago.
   Mrs. Linares said doctors worked 12 hours to resuscitate her son
at the time, despite their pleas to the contrary.
   The Linares family previously had asked about disconnecting the
life-support system, but the medical center told them it could not
do so without a court order because there still was some sign of
brain activity. The family had been scheduled to meet with a lawyer
Friday to discuss the matter.

   As a young girl in western New York,
Lucille Ball hawked hot dogs and popcorn at an amusement park as
she dreamed of starring in movies, hometown friends recalled.
   ``She always talked about being a star,'' said Pauline Lopus,
who went to school with Miss Ball and had kept in touch with her.
   Miss Ball, born 60 miles south of Buffalo in Jamestown on Aug.
6, 1911, grew up in nearby Celoron, a rural hamlet on Chautauqua
Lake.
   Mrs. Lopus remembered the sitcom star on Wednesday as ``daring
in many ways.''
   ``She tried to get me to run off (to Broadway),'' Mrs. Lopus
added. ``But I didn't have the nerve.''
   At 15, Miss Ball worked as a barker at the amusement park,
screaming for people to buy popcorn and hot dogs until she lost her
voice.
   Later, she starred in high school plays and got her start in
front of a large audience on the vaudeville stage at the defunct
Palace Theater in Jamestown.
   Although Miss Ball hadn't visited Jamestown since 1956 and had
no family there, she stayed in touch with friends.
   ``Even though she was a big star, she was still just Lucy to
us,'' said Irene Rosseti of Celoron.
   Mrs. Rosseti said Miss Ball recently sent her and her husband a
letter on their 50th wedding anniversary.
   Miss Ball regularly donated money to charities, civic events and
Jamestown Community College, said Jamestown Mayor Steven Carlson.
   On May 20, Miss Ball was to receive an honorary degree from the
college and had planned to return to Jamestown, now a city of about
40,000.
   Residents had put up posters saying ``Jamestown Loves Lucy'' in
storefronts and home windows. After Miss Ball suffered a heart
attack last week, residents decided to sign the posters and send
them to her as a get-well greeting. More than 150 posters were sent
with 10,000 signatures.
   The 77-year-old comedian died Wednesday of a ruptured aorta, the
main heart artery, at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles,
where she was recovering from last week's emergency heart surgery.
   ``It is a sad day for all of us,'' said Nelson Garifi, an
organizer of the welcoming event. ``But I'm sure that feeling is
shared by many people around the world.''
   Garifi, community relations director for the community college,
said the honorary degree will be awarded posthumously.
   Future generations in Celoron will have a reminder of their
famous resident every time they drive or walk down the street where
she grew up _ it will be renamed Lucy Lane.
   Village officials had planned formal ceremonies renaming the
street when she was due in the area next month.
   ``But it will happen anyway,'' John Goodell of the village's
historical society said Wednesday.
   When the society was formed about a year ago, Goodell said: ``We
sent an invitation to Lucille Ball to be a member, and she sent
back a check for $500 for a life membership.
   ``It was a check written in a very bold hand with a signature
about a half inch high.''

<HEAD>Study Raises Questions about Common Prostate Operation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The most common kind of prostate operation may not
be as effective as traditional surgery for relieving prostate woes
in older men, a study published today concludes.
   A form of surgery called transurethral prostatectomy has largely
replaced traditional open surgery to cut away enlarged prostate
glands. In the newer procedure, surgeons push a thin tube up the
urethra to the prostate, where a cutting loop slices the excess
tissue. Patients recover more quickly and have less pain with this
approach.
   However, new data from three countries suggests that men are
substantially more likely to require a second operation after the
transurethral procedure.
   In addition, the researchers said their data ``raise the
possibility'' that men are more likely to die in the years
immediately after the transurethral operation, although they said
more study is necessary to be sure this is true.
   The study, directed by Dr. Noralou P. Roos of the University of
Manitoba in Winnipeg, was published in today's New England Journal
of Medicine. It was based on the records of 36,703 men undergoing
prostate surgery in Denmark, 5,284 in England and 12,090 in Canada.
   The need for second operations ranged from 12 percent to 16
percent of patients in the three countries undergoing transurethral
surgery, compared with 2 percent to 5 percent of those getting open
surgery.
   The death rate during eight years of followup was higher in the
transurethral patients in all three countries. This difference was
most carefully analyzed in the Canadian patients, and the
researchers found that those getting the transurethral procedure
there had a 45 percent higher death rate. The excess of deaths was
due mainly to more heart attacks.
   In an accompanying editorial, Dr. Sheldon Greenfield of New
England Medical Center said the study ``does not provide convincing
evidence that open prostatectomy carries less risk than
transurethral prostatectomy.''
   He said men might have been more likely to get the transurethral
procedure if they already had heart disease.

<HEAD>Fossil Find Suggests Neanderthals Could Make Human Speech Sounds</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A 60,000-year-old Neanderthal neck bone
resembles its counterpart in modern humans, suggesting the ancient
creatures were anatomically equipped to speak, researchers reported
today.
   Scientists are interested in the Neanderthal's capability for
those sounds because it bears on the question of whether
Neanderthals were direct ancestors of modern man or simply an
evolutionary dead end.
   The discovery of the tiny, U-shaped bone is reported in the
British journal Nature by reseael, France and
Moorhead State University in Minrchers from Isranesota.
   Other scientists said the find is unlikely to end the debate
about Neanderthal speech capabilities.
   The Neanderthals, who lived in Europe and Asia until about
35,000 years ago, undoubtedly did communicate in some fashion
because their culture was relatively advanced, scientists say. The
debate is whether they were physically able to speak.
   The new fossil, unearthed from Kebara Cave at Mount Carmel in
Israel, is a hyoid bone. In the body, the hyoid lies between the
root of the tongue and the larynx.
   In the Nature paper, the researchers said the fossil bone is
almost identical in size and shape to modern hyoids. Along with
other evidence, that suggests that that the larynx, or voice box,
also he
Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York.
   Secondly, he said he does not see how the isolated bone will
help scientists determine the position of the larynx in the throat.
He called that crucial to the question of Neanderthal's speech
capabilities.
   The larynx is lower in the throat of modern humans than it was
in very early ancestors, he said. The lower position allows for the
space above it to act as a resonating chamber, which is required
for fully articulate speech, he said.
   In an editorial accompanying the Nature paper, John Marshall of
the Radcliffe Infirmary at Oxford, England, cautioned that
determining function from anatomy is tricky.
   The argument about Neanderthal language capability, he wrote,
``will undoubtedly run and run until we discover a deep-frozen
Neanderthal who is susceptible to resuscitation.''
   A second report in Nature confirms an earlier study that
suggested anatomically modern humans lived in the Middle East some
90,000 years ago. That was more than twice the age scientists had
been able to establish reliably for the existence of anatomically
modern humans.
   Scientists from Britain, Canada and Israel studied the age of
cattle teeth associated with human remains in the Skhul cave at
Mount Carmel. They found that the teeth, and so the humans, are at
least about 81,000 years old and more probably about 101,000 years
old.
   That resembles the age of about 92,000 years reported last year
for similar humans in the Qafzeh cave in Israel.
   Anatomically modern humans may have occupied the area only
intermittently during that era, study co-author Christopher
Stringer said in an interview.
   Neanderthals probably were more established there, but it is not
clear whether they encountered the anatomically modern humans, said
Stringer, curator of fossil hominids at the British Museum (Natural
History) in London.

   As the U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments on a woman's right to
an abortion and as thousands demonstrated nationwide, one woman
made final plans for an abortion at the St. Louis clinic that
started the case.
   ``My finances won't let me have another child. I think I should
have the right to choose,'' the 23-year-old woman, who spoke on the
condition on anonymity, said Wednesday.
   ``There were more concerns in the waiting room this morning,''
said Amelia McCracken, spokeswoman for Reproductive Health
Services, which initiated the case before the nation's high court
by challenging restrictions in Missouri's abortion law. ``There is
an awareness, an edge today that I haven't seen previously.''
   The Supreme Court could use its ruling in the case of Webster
vs. Reproductive Health Services to tighten or even overturn its
landmark 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision that legalized abortion.
   The St. Louis clinic, a target in the past of many anti-abortion
protests, was quiet Wednesday. But from Connecticut to California,
people marched and spoke out at rallies on both sides of the issue.
   The crowds were mostly pro-choice, and many who had abortions
told their stories.
   ``I am compelled by the thought that someone else ... could have
made such a personal decision for me,'' said Cynthia Shang, 24, of
Durham, N.C., who spoke before 800 pro-choice demonstrators in
Raleigh. She said she had an abortion at age 19.
   ``We are committed to a woman's inalienable right to her own
womb,'' she said. ``It is not the property of the state. It is not
the property of the church.''
   But in Sacramento, Calif., Nola Jones told reporters she had two
abortions before becoming an abortion foe. ``Abortion is a major
death experience. Women cannot participate in the death of their
own child and not be psychologically impaired,'' she said.
   About 2,000 pro-choice demonstrators rallied at the state
capital in Sacramento and a half-dozen abortion opponents gathered
nearby.
   The abortion foes approached the rally, but were surrounded by
pro-choice demonstrators. State police separated the groups, then
stayed between them throughout the protest.
   ``This is not a women's issue,'' actor Tim Busfield, who plays
Elliot Weston on ABC's ``thirtysomething,'' told the pro-choice
rally. ``It's a family issue. It's a human rights issue.''
   Elsewhere, rallies were held in Albany, N.Y.; at Yale Law School
in New Haven, Conn.; Columbus, Ohio; Fort Wayne, Ind.; and at the
University of California, Berkeley in the culmination of an
on-campus vigil that went on for days.
   And about 800 backers of legalized abortion marched in Atlanta.
   ``This is a monumental day of reckoning for women's lives in the
U.S.,'' said Victoria Lambert, a spokeswoman for the Coalition
Opposing Operation Rescue.
   Operation Rescue, which has mounted a series of major
anti-abortion protests aimed at blocking access to abortion
clinics, is planning protests in 65 cities Friday and Saturday,
said spokeswoman Barbara Magera in Binghamton, N.Y.
   She said the group would work for a ``human life amendment'' to
the Constitution, and would seek bans on abortion in individual
states in the event the Supreme Court overturns Roe vs. Wade.
   Many speakers across the country spoke of the possibility that
the high court could return decision-making authority on the
legality of abortions to the states.
   ``It will be total chaos, either way,'' said Mary Newberg, the
president of the Atlanta chapter of the National Organization for
Women.
   The Louisiana legislature already has a bill that declares
abortion centers public nuisances in the event the high court
overturns Roe vs. Wade.

   Taking ulcer medicine continuously, not just
during ulcer flare-ups, can help keep the painful irritations from
returning, a study published today says.
   Doctors frequently prescribe the drugs ranitidine and cimetidine
to ulcer sufferers. While these medicines can heal digestive ulcers
within a month or two, they usually come back.
   In the study, conducted on people with duodenal ulcers, doctors
showed that regular maintenance therapy with ranitidine cut the
chances of ulcers returning almost in half.
   Patients who drank alcohol, smoked, had a history of ulcer
disease or had duodenal scarring were at the greatest risk of
recurrence, and they also benefited the most from regular doses of
the drug.
   During a one-year period, ulcers returned in 37 percent of the
people getting ranitidine and 63 percent given placebo pills.
   The study conducted on 140 people was directed by Dr. Gary M.
Van Deventer of the Veterans Administration Medical Center in Los
Angeles. It was published in the New England Journal of Medicine.

   A strong earthquake centered in the Pacific ocean
shook islands south of Tokyo early today but no injuries or damage
were reported, the Central Meteorological Agency said.
   The agency said the quake, centered about 50 miles under the
seabed and 420 miles south of Tokyo, registered 6.4 on the Richter
scale. It said there was no danger of tsunami, or tidal waves.
   An agency official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
that on the nearest inhabited island, Chichi Jima, the quake
registered 2 on the Japanese scale of 7, meaning slight movement of
sliding doors was noticeable.
   A tremor measuring two on the Japanese scale means extremely
feeble shocks only felt by those at rest.
   The Richter scale measures the magnitude of a quake at its
epicenter, according to ground motion as recorded on seismographs.
An earthquake of 6 is considered ``severe,'' capable of widespread
damage near the epicenter.
   The Japanese scale measures the intensity of an earthquake at a
particular location and is not convertible to the Richter scale.

<HEAD>City Administrator Who Used False Resumes Sentenced</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A man who used false resumes in a
cross-country government career has been barred from taking a
government job for seven years and sentenced to 90 days in jail for
deceiving an Alaskan village.
   At his sentencing Wednesday, Carl Keyser Jr., 34, also was
ordered to pay $18,000 restitution. He was convicted of
first-degree theft stemming from his three-month tenure as city
administrator of Kake, a tiny fishing and timber village in
southeast Alaska about 100 miles south of Juneau.
   He pleaded no contest in February to the felony charge alleging
he took $28,680 in salary, benefits and expenses before he was
fired in December.
   Superior Court Judge Thomas Schultz of Ketchikan placed Keyser
on probation for seven years, ordered him not to accept any
government jobs during that time, and told him to write letters of
apology to Kake and Pikeville, Ky., where he also briefly worked.
   Keyser had listed academic degrees he hadn't received and jobs
he hadn't held on his resume, officials have said.
   District Attorney Mark Ells said a Kentucky charge of theft by
deception will be dismissed at the request of the Pikeville
prosecutor. Keyser sent the city $707 in restitution Tuesday,
closing that case, Ells said.
   The Pikeville restitution represented expense money Keyser was
paid in August during a six-day stint as city manager before he
resigned amid allegations he faked his resume.
   Keyser already has served 60 days in jail and asked to have the
30 remaining days waived, saying he had been unable to find a job
since he was released on bail.
   Schultz, however, said 90 days was not a harsh sentence
considering the crime. ``This is pretty reprehensible conduct,''
the judge said of Keyser's employment record.
   Keyser apologized for his conduct. He said he obtained the jobs
by lying so he could support his wife and four young daughters.
   ``What I did here was wrong,'' he said. ``I lied on my resume
because I needed a job to feed my family, and instead of doing it
the right way ... I took too many shortcuts.''
   Outside the courthouse, however, he denied allegations that he
obtained other jobs under false pretenses.
   Public defender Mary Treiber said Keyser was considering going
to Seattle to find employment.
   ``If Mr. Keyser stays in Alaska, it is unlikely he will be able
to pay the entire amount (of restitution), even in seven years,''
Treiber said.
   Kake residents became suspicous of Keyser shortly after he
arrived to take the $44,000-a-year administrator's job in October.
   He bought a luxurious $66,000 double mobile home, rifles and
1,000 rounds of ammunition with city money, and refused to release
his resume for public inspection.
   A police records check revealed the outstanding Kentucky warrant
in December and he was arrested.
   Interviews with prosecutors and city officials in several states
revealed that at least 19 of Keyser's jobs since 1980 were with
city or county governments. Records and the interviews showed
Keyser used false information to obtain at least 11 of the jobs.
   Keyser, a native of Huntington, W.Va., previously was placed on
a year's probation after pleading guilty to a misdemeanor perjury
charge in Oak Hill, Fla. The charge alleged he used false
information to get hired as Oak Hill police chief. He was fired
after four months when the discrepancies in his resume were
reported in the news media.

   Two women who received fertilized eggs in their
fallopian tubes through a new non-surgical procedure have produced
the nation's first births to result from that technique.
   The procedure involves guiding a tube through the cervix to the
fallopian tube, where it deposits two or three fertilized eggs.
   It is called non-surgical ZIFT, for zygote intrafallopian
transfer. Previously, the fertilized eggs were deposited through
surgery and general anesthesia.
   The new non-surgical approach is less expensive and can be done
more often to establish pregnancy, Ricardo Asch of the University
of California, Irvine said Wednesday.
   One girl was born April 9 by normal delivery, according to a
university spokeswoman. One girl was delivered by Caesarean section
on April 12, according to the Genetics &amp; IVF Institute of Fairfax,
Va.
   The second girl was premature at 36{ weeks, but was pronounced
healthy soon after birth, the institute said. The girl and her
mother are doing well now, institute director Joseph D. Schulman
said Wednesday.
   Asch said putting fertilized eggs in the fallopian tube, rather
than in the uterus as is done with standard in-vitro fertilization,
gives them a better environment for development.
   ZIFT is a variant of GIFT, or gamete intrafallopian transfer, in
which unfertilized eggs and sperm are put into the fallopian tube
to achieve fertilization there.
   Asch said ZIFT is preferable to GIFT if the prospective father
shows a low sperm count or if the woman has proteins called
antibodies that can attack the father's sperm.
   Schulman estimated that only about 20 percent to 30 percent of
women who go to an in-vitro fertilization center are candidates for
GIFT or ZIFT, because those procedures require that the fallopian
tubes not be damaged.
   Martin M. Quigley, president of the Society for Assisted
Reproductive Technology, said Wednesday he did not know of any
previous American births from non-surgical ZIFT.

   Lucille Ball's comedic talent was her
strongest show business suit, but behind the scenes, her gutsy,
pioneering spirit helped the fledgling television industry come of
age.
   Miss Ball, who died Wednesday at 77, helped to develop that
enduring TV staple, the situation comedy, and with her former
husband, the late Desi Arnaz, established one of television's first
major independent studios.
   Desilu, as the famed production house was called, became one of
the most powerful forces in early television. Besides the ``I Love
Lucy'' series, it turned out some of the top comedy shows of the
1950s and 60s, including ``December Bride,'' ``Our Miss Brooks''
and ``Make Room for Daddy.''
   Desilu, which had taken over RKO Studios, also produced
successful action-adventure programs such as ``Star Trek'' and
``Mission: Impossible.''
   As testament to their value as prime-time stars, Miss Ball and
Arnaz signed an $8 million, no-cancellation, two-year contract with
CBS in 1953 _ the largest in television history at the time and a
figure scarcely touched today.
   In 1951, when CBS decided to move Miss Ball's radio series, ``My
Favorite Husband,'' to television, the network also wanted to move
the show from Hollywood to New York, where the young TV industry
was based. But Miss Ball wanted to remain on the West Coast, and
she got her way.
   The solution was to use Hollywood's motion picture facilities
and film the ``I Love Lucy'' episodes for later broadcast _ a bold
decision that changed the face of television in the days before
videotape.
   The show was filmed like a stage play before an audience,
employing three cameras instead of the one camera traditionally
used for motion pictures.
   This eliminated the need to interrupt dialogue to shoot from
different angles and made the presence of a comedy enhancing
audience feasible. The technique still is used today.
   Miss Ball needed an audience to be funny, recalled Harry
Ackerman, who was CBS vice president for programming in Hollywood
at the time.
   ``When she started the television show I insisted that she have
an audience,'' Ackerman said. ``Lucy was a great clown, but she
could only work successfully in front of people.''
   The multiple-camera filming produced another dividend. ``I Love
Lucy'' episodes were resalable as reruns and Desilu was the first
studio to profit from program syndication. The various Lucy series
continue to be seen in more than 80 countries.
   Miss Ball and Arnaz divorced in 1960, and he sold the actress
his share in the company for $3 million. With a shrewd business
sense, Miss Ball built it into a major TV production company and in
1967 sold it to Gulf &amp; Western Industries Inc. for $17 million.
   The couple stopped making weekly ``I Love Lucy'' shows in 1957
in favor of monthly hourlong specials. In 1961, Miss Ball married
nightclub comic Gary Morton, who became her executive producer, and
she remained on television for another 12 years in the weekly
``Here's Lucy'' and ``The Lucy Show.''
   ``The biggest gamble she took was when she went on without
Desi,'' said Michael Dann, then head of programming for CBS. ``The
whole program staff was 50-50 whether she would be successful, let
alone as successful as she had been with Desi. There was absolute
amazement when she became just as big a star as before. In her
career, that had to be her biggest challenge.''
   ``I Love Lucy'' transcended other domestic comedies not only due
to technical innovations, but also because it successfully mixed
art and life, such as writing Miss Ball's pregnancy into the series
_ a TV first _ or celebrating actual birthdays on camera.
   William Paley, the former CBS chairman, said Wednesday that Miss
Ball would always remain the network's first lady.
   ``Lucy's extraordinary ability to light up the screen and
brighten our lives is a legacy that will last forever,'' he said.
``Her loss is a loss to us all.''

   Leave it to Lucy to find laughs _ hysterical,
sidesplitting laughs _ in chocolates and grapes.
   Lucy MacGillicuddy Ricardo, and later Lucy Carmichael and Lucy
Carter, could get into more trouble than anybody on television.
   Sometimes actress Lucille Ball had the help of co-conspirator
Ethel Mertz, played by Vivian Vance. But she always left Ricky
sputtering in broken English. Her then-husband, the late Desi
Arnaz, was her first foil on ``I Love Lucy.'' Later, Gale Gordon
was on the receiving end on ``The Lucy Show'' and ``Here's Lucy.''
   In the very first show, which went on the air on Oct. 15, 1951,
the Ricardos decide to make out wills. And Lucy thinks Ricky is
going to kill her.
   ``I Love Lucy'' got ratings that would make even Bill Cosby
envious. The ratings were in the 50s. The birth of Little Ricky on
Jan. 19, 1953, got a rating of 71.8 and was seen by 92 percent of
the television audience.
   Many of the shows involved Lucy's attempts to break into show
business. Husband Ricky was band leader at the Tropicana Club in
Manhattan.
   Lucy's grape-stomping episode is one of her funniest and most
memorable. It came during the fifth season, in 1956, when the
Ricardos and Mertzes were on a visit to Europe. Information on
individual episodes is from ``The `I Love Lucy' Book'' by Bart
Andrews, published by Doubleday-Dolphin.
   Lucy is cast by an Italian director in a movie called ``Bitter
Grapes.'' Assuming it's about wine-making, she dresses up as a
peasant girl carrying a bunch of grapes and soon ends up in a
grape-filled vat at a local winery. She stomps on the grapes to
make wine and is soon in a grape fight with another woman grape
stomper.
   She's in no shape to play her movie role, which turns out to be
that of a typical American tourist. The role goes to Ethel.
   In 1952, Lucy and Ethel take a job in a candy factory when Ricky
tells Lucy she needs to mend her spendthrift ways. The wives will
go to work and Ricky and Fred will do the housework. Lucy works in
the chocolate-dipping section, where, of course, she ends up in a
chocolate fight with a fellow worker. She and Ethel are sent to the
wrapping department and are unable to keep up with the assembly
line.
   Another favorite episode came in 1955, when Harpo Marx was a
guest and Lucy dressed up like the silent Harpo. The funniest part
and the best remembered came when the Harpo and his lookalike meet
and re-create the famous mirror routine from the Marx Brothers
movie ``Duck Soup.''
   When Lucy and Ethel tried to emulate pioneer women in the first
season, they made the usual mess. Lucy's bread-making effort turned
into a gigantic loaf that nearly filled up the kitchen when she put
in too many cakes of yeast.
   Her television commercial for a health tonic left her tipsy in
1952. She had to keep drinking the tonic for the commercial and
eventually its 23 percent alcohol content took its toll. Her speech
became more and more slurred and the show got funnier and funnier.
   The birth of Little Ricky and Desi Arnaz Jr., which rivaled
Dwight D. Eisenhower's inauguration as president on the front pages
of the nation's newspapers, was seen by more people than any other
TV episode at its time. The birth of Desi Jr. was announced at the
end of the show.
   In the show, filmed two months earlier, Ricky rushes Lucy to the
hospital, but has to get to the nightclub for his act. He gets into
his voodoo doctor makeup at the hospital, then rushes to the
Tropicana. He comes back for his first look at Ricky Jr.

   James Clayton Bailey Jr. says he stripped to
his underwear and jumped into near-freezing water in the Tennessee
River to grab a deck hand who had fallen off a barge because ``I
just hated to see a man die.''
   The Paducah, Ky., man was among 17 Americans and one Canadian
recognized Wednesday by the Carnegie Hero Fund Commission. A $2,500
grant was awarded to each hero or their survivors.
   Bailey, a business manager for E.M. Bailey Co., his family's oil
business, said he had just walked out onto the company's river dock
in Calvert City, Ky., on Jan. 23, 1988, when a group of frightened
men told him 20-year-old Rockey A. Jobe had fallen into the river.
   Heavy clothing meant to protect dock workers from cold weather
was pulling Jobe further into the 38-degree water, and a 7 to 10
mph current was moving him toward midstream.
   Bailey stripped, grabbed a two-foot piece of plastic wrapping on
the ground and swam about 150 feet to Jobe.
   After pushing the plastic under the man, Bailey grabbed a chain
dock workers had lowered to the water from a crane and prepared to
be pulled to safety. Seconds later, however, the crane's boom
struck a utility pole, and Bailey, fearing electrocution, released
the chain.
   Struggling against the current, Bailey eventually reached the
bank, and several other men used rope to lift Jobe out of the
water. Jobe quickly recovered.
   ``I had been around the river and I knew I could stand cold
water at least for a little bit, and I just thought I could get to
him,'' Bailey, 42, said in a telephone interview Wednesday. ``I
just didn't want to stand around and watch a man die. ... I just
hated to see a man die.''
   The Carnegie Hero Fund Commission has recognized 37 people so
far this year and 7,331 since it was founded in 1904 by
industrialist Andrew Carnegie.
   Wednesday's other heroes were:
   _Michael J. Ruthemeyer, 26, of Houston and Gary C. Williams Sr.,
28, of Sugar Land, Texas, who pulled a father and son from a
burning car in Houston on April 27.
   _Eric J. Prindle, 35, of Xenia, Ohio, who pulled a woman from a
burning car in Xenia on June 25, 1988.
   _Geronimo M. Barreras, 37, of Mesquite, N.M., who rescued a
wounded woman from a man firing a semi-automatic pistol in Mesquite
on Dec. 2, 1987.
   _Thomas M. Booth, 35, of Cordova, Tenn., and C. Arthur Dimond,
39, of Pittsburgh, who saved Dimond's two children from drowning in
the Atlantic Ocean at Naggs Head, N.C. on July 7, 1988. Dimond
drowned.
   _Paul A. Thompson, 26, of Mount Vernon, N.Y., who saved a man
from a burning apartment in Mount Vernon on Sept. 4, 1988.
   _Michael S. Weatherhead, 32, of Jefferson, Maine, who pulled a
girl from the swift current of a stream in Jefferson on May 3, 1988.
   _John E. Roach, 43, of Tooele, Utah, who pulled three women from
a burning car in Tooele on Oct. 8, 1988.
   _Truman E. Nickell, 58, of Lebanon, Mo., who saved his
granddaughter and another girl from drowning in the Gulf of Mexico
near Galveston, Texas, on July 14, 1988.
   _Gerald Thomas Grimm, 30, of Morristown, N.J., who saved a
police officer struggling with a man who attempted to grab his gun
in Ridgefield Park, N.J., on Feb. 4, 1988.
   _Paul B. Dostie, 42, of Haverhill, Mass., and James G. Scott,
40, of Newburyport, Mass., who pulled a man out of a burning car in
Haverhill on Dec. 17, 1988.
   _Salvatore Silvestri, 36, of Toronto, who helped save a man who
had fallen off a chartered boat on Lake Ontario on Aug. 2, 1986.
Silvestri drowned.
   _Craig Wrolsen, 33, of West Camp, N.Y., and Jonathan D. Nitkin,

<TEXT>
   Konosuke Matsushita, an inventor who founded of
Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., one of the world's largest
manufacturers of consumer electronics, died of pneumonia today, a
hospital official said. He was 94.
   Matsushita had been in poor health and was admitted to
Matsushita Memorial Hospital in Osaka on April 5 for treatment of a
cold, a company official said.
   Quitting school at age 10 to go to work, Matsushita remained
faithful to the values he learned growing up as the youngest of
nine children in Wakayama in western Japan.
   He built his global electronics empire from an electric socket
business he began in 1918.
   The company grew into more than 450 companies in 37 countries,
with brands including Panasonic, National, Quasar and Technics.
Sales totaled $30.3 billion in the fiscal year ending in March.
   ``I have many memories of him,'' Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita
said today. ``He was like a god.''
   ``I have simply done common things commonly well, doing what I
should do and abstaining from what I should not,'' Matsushita once
wrote. ``In short, I have lived my daily life at the dictates of
common sense.''
   Later in life, he espoused a philosophy of ``peace and happiness
through prosperity,'' a kind of benevolent capitalism he preached
through his own publishing company and a weekly magazine with a
circulation of 1.5 million. His views were criticized, however, as
being a religion of worldly interests.
   Born Nov. 27, 1894, Matsushita grew up in a well-to-do
environment but was forced to quit school and work after his
father, a farmer, lost the family fortune speculating in rice
futures.
   After apprenticeships with a dealer of charcoal-burning stoves
and a bicycle maker, Matsushita began working for the Osaka
Electric Light Co. in 1910. He stayed there seven years, until he
quit to begin his electric socket business with his wife, Mumeno,
and her brother.
   As an inventor, Matsushita registered more than 100 patents. His
first was for a successful two-way socket he invented while
confined to home because of poor health.
   Centering around consumer appliances, his Osaka-based company's
products ranged from television sets, washing machines and
refrigerators to video tape recorders and microwave ovens.
   Matsushita was known in the business world for his
unconventional ideas, such as turning assembly line workers into
door-to-door salesmen during a 1974 recession, and once advocating
that Japan bulldoze 20 percent of its mountains to provide
reclaimed land for the crowded nation.
   He received honorary degrees from several of Japan's most
prestigious universities, and, in 1979 started his own school of
government and business.
   He wrote more than 50 books, including a 1975 best-seller titled
``How to Rescue Crumbling Japan,'' and received one of the Japanese
government's highest honors, the Order of the Rising Sun First
Class, as well as medals and honors from the Netherlands, Belgium,
Spain, and Malaysia.
   Matsushita is survived by his wife, Mumeno, 93, and daughter,
Sachiko, 68. The daughter's husband, Masaharu Matsushita, 76, was
adopted into the family and now is the company chairman.
   A Matsushita official said funeral services would be held Sunday
at Honganji Tsumura Betsuin Temple in Osaka, western Japan.

   A woman who believed her children were
clones was charged with decapitating the two baby girls, according
to authorities.
   Laura Lee Rice, 37, told authorities she had to kill the
children to get her real babies back, according to a complaint
sworn out against her.
   She pleaded innocent by reason of mental illness to two counts
of first-degree murder on Wednesday and was ordered to the state
hospital in Evanston to undergo psychiatric testing.
   Sheriff's deputies on Monday found the bodies of 15-month-old
Danielle Lee Rice and 4-month-old Joan Rice in a mobile home south
of Gillette, which is in the northeast part of the state.
   The deputies were summoned to the trailer Monday evening by
Daniel Runyon, the girls' father. Runyon told the deputies that a
homicide had been committed in his mobile home.
   Asked how he knew, Runyon replied, ``I saw my daughter's head in
a plastic bag.''
   Runyon told deputies that Rice had said that ``Medussa had made
her do it.''
   At the mobile home the deputies confronted Rice, who told them
she had received a telephone call from a woman who told her she
``would have to kill the look-alike chidren'' if she wanted her
real children back, said Investigator Monty Trenary in a complaint
sworn out against Rice.
   ``The defendant further stated ... that she needed to cut the
look-alikes' arms and heads off and put them in different places so
that her children may be brought back in two days,'' Trenary said.
   Deputies found the children's bodies in plastic bags hidden in a
closet and beneath a crib. The complaint said Rice admitted
committing the killings with a large butcher knife.
   Sheriff Byron Oedekoven said the woman has several aliases and
that Rice may not be her legal name.

<HEAD>Doubts Linger on Cold Fusion As Experiment Published</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Today's publication of one of the first reports
of so-called cold fusion has met with continuing skepticism about
the technology's potential to provide a major new energy source.
   ``It sounds like there's a real reaction which is very slow and
very curious, but it's more of a curiosity than anything else,''
said Francis Chen, an electrical engineering professor at the
University of California at Los Los Angeles.
   The amount of energy produced is so small that while it may
someday be appropriate for small-scale applications, such as
satellites, it probably could not be useful for power plants, he
said.
   Still, he called the report in today's issue of the British
journal Nature ``about the only reasonably scientific paper that
I've seen'' on cold fusion.
   The research was done by a team led by physicist Steven Jones at
Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah. Jones had already publicly
described the experiments, which found evidence of fusion occurring
in relatively simple equipment at room temperature.
   Fusion is the process that powers the sun. It occurs when the
core, or nucleus, of one hydrogen atom fuses with the core of
another, releasing energy.
   Some scientists believe fusion, if harnessed, could provide an
environmentally attractive source of energy. In contrast to cold
fusion, conventional fusion research uses very high temperatures
and complex machinery.
   University of Utah scientists caused a sensation last month when
they announced that their cold fusion apparatus produced more
energy than it consumed.
   In contrast, Brigham Young's Jones has said his experiments
produced only a very tiny fraction of the energy they consumed.
   Still, he and colleagues from Brigham Young and the University
of Arizona write in the Nature paper, the phenomenon ``opens the
possibility, at least, of a new path to fusion energy.''
   They used a series of small jars, each holding about four
teaspoons of a mix of metallic salts and heavy water, in which
hydrogen is replaced with a chemical cousin called deuterium.
   Researchers applied three to 25 volts to the solution between an
electrode made of gold foil and another made of either titanium or
palladium. The current herded deuterium atoms into the latter
electrode, where they apparently fused, researchers said.
   The scientists reported that the apparatus produced a ``small
but significant'' emission of neutrons, which are extremely tiny
particles that are given off in fusion reactions.
   John Carpenter of Argonne National Laboratory in Argonne, Ill.,
one of the experts Nature asked to review the Jones paper, said he
has doubts that fusion occurred to the extent the paper suggests.
   ``I take it as a certainty that cold fusion goes on at some low
level, but it's problematic as to whether it's at an observable
level. That remains to be shown in a tight case,'' he said in an
interview.
   More experiments must be done with additional procedures to rule
out other explanations for the results, such as interference from
cosmic rays, he said.

   A man accused of being married to four women at
the same time was sentenced to 27 months by a federal judge who
told him he would be spending some time ``in the company of men''
for a change.
   U.S. District Judge Barbara Hackett on Wednesday sentenced
Victor Barr, seated in a wheelchair in court, to prison without
parole.
   Barr, 49, pleaded guilty in January to marrying Carol Kelly of
Pontiac and Margaret Gearing of Cleveland under false pretenses in
1988 and of defrauding the women of about $50,000. Federal
officials believe he had two other wives at the time.
   Barr conned women into marrying him by promising them money from
an inheritance, prosecutors said. They said he paid his expenses
with their credit cards and repaid them with checks written on a
phony bank account.
   Hackett said she was skeptical of Barr's claims that he was
illiterate and unable to walk.
   ``When you are in custody you will be in the company of men,''
she told him. ``For the first time you will be without women to
look after you and you will be taking care of yourself.''

   However, Pedrin's new wife, 28-year-old Belinda Hoefert, who is
expecting his child in September, began crying softly when the
sentence was announced and left the courtroom in tears.
   Under state law, the 31-year-old Pedrin must serve the full team
because a plea bargain with prosecutors required him to admit to a
previous conviction for burglary.
   Pedrin's first wife was stabbed to death in February 1987. A

for the killing.

<TEXT>
   Republican faithful, shaken by election
losses in Indiana and Alabama earlier this year, saw GOP hopeful
Craig Thomas win a surprisingly easy victory to fill Wyoming's only
seat in Congress.
   Thomas, a state representative, defeated Democrat John Vinich in
Wednesday's special election by more than 13,000 votes.
   Even Thomas, 56, was amazed by the victory margin in the race
for the seat relinquished by Defense Secretary Dick Cheney.
   ``I thought it would be close, for no other reason than, of
course, our campaign started 40 days ago, or less, and the other
campaign has been going off and on for nearly a year-and-a-half,''
said Thomas.
   Unofficial returns showed him with 74,258 votes, or 52 percent,
to Vinich's 60,821 votes, or 43 percent. Independent Craig McCune
received 5,921 votes, while Daniel Johnson, an independent who
espoused white separatist views, got 500.
   Thomas credited his victory to the voters' desire to maintain a
conservative approach in Washington.
   ``I think largely it was an expression of continuation of the
splendid job that's been done by Dick Cheney,'' he said. ``And a
voice for continued representation in that mode, of a conservative
voice in Washington for Wyoming.''
   Vinich, a state senator, had won the Democratic nomination for
the House seat after a 13-month campaign that ended with his losing
to U.S. Sen. Malcolm Wallop by just 1,322 votes last November.
   Vinich's widespread name recognition was a decided plus for the
Democrat, but in the House campaign the Republicans constantly
referred to him as a free-spending liberal beholden to out-of-state
labor groups.
   Indeed, labor groups contributed more than 80 percent of
Vinich's campaign funds. But the Democrat denounced the Republican
charges and countered by portraying Thomas as a pawn of the
national GOP, which appeared desperate for a victory after losing
special congressional elections in Indiana and Alabama.
   Vinich, 38, ran behind as the returns came in and never
recovered, winning just four of the state's 23 counties. In an
interview from his home, Vinich blamed the loss on voters who
stayed home.
   ``Close to 60,000 voters that didn't vote in this election ...
voted last November. That's where the difference was,'' he said.
``We just didn't get all the voters out that we hoped would have
voted.''

   Federal scientists will monitor the operation
of a cold fusion experiment in an attempt to verify that University
of Utah researchers have captured the power of the sun in a test
tube.
   University of Utah chemist Stanley Pons testified Wednesday
before the House Science Committee that scientists from the Los
Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico will visit his campus to
watch the operation of a tabletop fusion cell.
   Later, Pons told the committee, the cell will be dismantled and
taken back to Los Alamos by the federal scientists.
   Pons and his collaborator, Martin Fleischmann of the University
of Southampton in England, arranged for the demonstration in an
effort to calm skepticism in the science community that the
room-temperature fusion apparatus actually works.
   Testimony by Pons and Fleischmann was followed by comments from
seven scientists at other university and federal laboratories who
told of great doubts among researchers about the Utah results.
   Mike Saltmarsh, head of the fusion energy program at the Oak
Ridge National Laboratory, said all of the federal laboratories had
tried to replicate the Utah cold fusion results.
   ``The results have all been negative,'' said Saltmarsh. ``We
have seen no heat'' generated by the process.
   The Utah delegation before the committee also included
University of Utah president Chase Peterson, who urged that the
government move swiftly to provide federal funds for the cold
fusion research.
   Other scientists who testified, however, cautioned against
federal support until the process has been verified.
   Pons and Fleischmann received a generally warm reception by the
science committee, but did face some sharp questioning about why so
many other laboratories have not been able to verify their
experiment.
   Pons' announcement of the Los Alamos participation came after
Rep. Sid Morrison, R-Wash., asked if the Utah experiment could be
performed before independent observers.
   ``We have 19 experiments being set up now,'' said Pons. One of
these, he said, will be monitored by the Los Alamos scientists.
   Committee members also asked why some other laboratories have
not been able to get details needed to replicate the Utah
experiment, and Fleischmann replied: ``We are very happy to tell
people how we have been able to do it.''
   He said, however, that those who don't succeed should ``publish
in full'' reports of their failures.
   Two researchers at Portland State University in Oregon reported
a successful experiment on Monday in which results of the cold
fusion experiment were duplicated using specifications and
materials described in an article by Pons and Fleischmann.
   Physics professor John Dash and graduate student Patrick Keefe
said ``at least'' 100 times more energy was produced than was used
to start the experiment, with the energy burst occurring in the
first second.
   Rep. Marilyn Lloyd, D-Tenn., noted at Monday's hearing that
reports of the Utah experiment have indicated the heat produced is
at a low level. She asked if they could achieve a ``useful
temperature'' with the reaction.
   ``We've had a cell warm up to the boiling point,'' said
Fleischmann. But he said to scale up to a useful level ``raises
many new problems.''
   ``We think it's feasible, but it will require a very high
effort,'' he said.
   Fleischmann and Pons spent about $100,000 of their own money to
develop the tabletop fusion cell, but they said to scale up to a
larger size will cost about 10 times more, and to produce useful
energy ``would cost millions.''
   Peterson urged the committee to provide federal funds to help
set up a fusion research center at the University of Utah. He said
the state already has allocated $5 million and another $1 million
has been raised from private sources.
   ``What level of funding do you believe is needed?'' asked Rep.
George E. Brown Jr., D-Calif.
   ``The figure that comes to mind is $25 million,'' said Peterson.
``We should move promptly. We should have proposals within a week.''
   Other scientists who testified, however, urged the committee not
rush into support of the effort.
   ``We need at least two months to evaluate the significance of
this process,'' said Steven Jones, a Brigham Young University
fusion researcher.
   Fusion research could be hurt if federal money were put into the
Utah effort before it is proven, said George Miley, a fusion expert
from the University of Illinois, Urbana.
   ``A failure could set fusion research back by years,'' he said.
``I urge us to not overreact and put all our eggs in one basket.''

<HEAD>King Hussein Names Former Army Commander Prime Minister</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMAL HALABY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>AMMAN, Jordan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   King Hussein today named close friend and
former army commander Field Marshal Zeid Bin Shaker to head a new
government, official sources reported. Jordan was shaken last week
by riots over price increases.
   The new Cabinet will act as a caretaker until the country can
organize its first general parliamentary elections in 22 years,
King Hussein said in an interview published today with the Kuwaiti
newspaper Al-Seyassah.
   ``The next government will be a temporary one with a specific
assignment, namely speeding up solutions to our problems ... and
overseeing the general elections which will take place very soon,''
the king was quoted as saying.
   Bin Shaker, 55, was commander in chief of the armed forces until
last year, when the king brought him to the palace as chief of the
royal court and adviser on security affairs.
   He is best known outside Jordan as the architect of the army's
1970-1971 war to crush Palestinian guerrillas who had threatened
the stability of the state. The bloodiness of that conflict earned
him lasting hostility on the part of many Palestinians, but respect
from native Jordanians who resented the guerrillas' actions in
their country.
   The rioting over price rises last week was Jordan's worst
domestic violence since 1971. At least nine people died and
government property was smashed in dozens of southern Jordanian
towns and villages.
   The unrest occurred almost wholly among disgruntled native
Jordanians in the south, the wellspring of Hussein's support.
   The rioters shouted backing for Hussein, but chanted for the
ouster of Prime Minister Zaid Rifai, who was blamed for economic
difficulties that cut per capita income to about $1,200 a year from
$2,000 in the mid-1980s.
   Rifai resigned with his cabinet on Monday after four years in
office _ the longest single term by any premier since Jordan gained
independence in 1946.
   Bin Shaker is very distantly related to the king because both
are members of the Hashemite family descended from Islam's Prophet
Mohammed.
   His father, Shaker bin Zeid, came north from the Arabian
Peninsula with Hussein's grandfather, Emir Abdullah, the founder of
Jordan and served as Abdullah's closest adviser for many years.
   Bin Shaker, like Hussein, was educated at Victoria College in
Egypt and at Britain's Sandhurst military academy.
   He joined the army in 1953, the year Hussein came to power, and
was by the young king's side when Hussein drove out to meet his
troops and rally them against a coup d'etat attempt in 1957.
   Bin Shaker commanded an armored brigade in the 1967 war with
Israel and his reported hostility to Palestinian guerrillas led the
PLO to demand his dismissal as assistant chief of army operations
in early 1970.
   Hussein complied in a brief attempt to placate the fedayeen
guerrillas, but restored Bin Shaker's position on the eve of the
army's Black September war against the Palestine Liberation
Organization.
   The official army history describes him as ``the principle
architect of the operational plan for neutralization of the
fedayeen'' in 1970 and 1971.
   Hussein said in a televised address Wednesday night that
elections would be held soon.
   Jordan last held general elections for parliament in 1967, just
before Israel captured the West Bank, which contributed half of the
deputies to the old 60-member parliament.
   The king suspended that body last year when he severed links
with the West Bank. The government recently announced plans for a
new parliament with 72 members elected wholly from Jordan itself.

   Three Soviet cosmonauts returned to Earth today
from the Mir space station, leaving no one aboard the orbiting
craft until at least August, the official news agency Tass said.
   This is only the second time the space station has been left
unattended since it was launched in February 1986. Mir was unmanned
from July 1986 to February 1987 while the Soviets prepared the
station for constant occupation.
   Officials said leaving the Mir unmanned will save money at a
time when the Soviet Union faces a $160 billion budget deficit and
will give experts a chance to review scientific data already
collected.
   Meanwhile, other segments of the Soviet space program are
continuing. Tass announced today that a Photon rocket had been
launched Wednesday.
   ``The program of the 16-day flight includes experiments to
produce semiconductor materials with improved qualities and
extra-pure biologically active preparations in micro-gravity,''
Tass said.
   The Soyuz TM-7 carrying the three cosmonauts from the Mir
touched down in Soviet Central Asia at 6:59 a.m., Tass reported.
The capsule carrying Alexander Volkov, Sergei Krikalev and Valery
Polyakov landed 90 miles northeast of Dzheskazgan.
   The cosmonauts, apparently suffering no ill-effects from their
extended space flight, were to be taken by helicopter to a nearby
town to meet with their families, Radio Moscow said.
   Volkov and Krikalev had been in space for five months while
Polyakov, who remained on board after orbiting with a Soviet-Afghan
team, had been aboard Mir for eight months.
   A replacement crew was originally due to arrive at the Mir on
April 19, but Tass said ``a delay with the preparation'' of two new
modules forced a change in plans.
   The next crew due to take up residence in Mir in mid-August will
bring with it two modules containing a space chicken farm and
equipment for the production of single-crystal semiconductor
materials, Tass said.
   The agency said there would be ``a biological complex for
mastering the technology of growing poultry in zero gravity.''
   The new crew members, Alexander Viktorenko and Alexander
Balandin, are expected to remain on board six months.
   One of the new modules will contain an airlock to permit
cosmonauts to exit the craft while in orbit, and a maneuvering unit
for spacewalks, Tass said.
   Deputy flight director Viktor Blagov said last week that the new
modules, which would double the station's weight to 100 tons, would
be attached to the Mir by the end of the year. He said they also
will bring on board a space bicycle, a solar battery and an East
German optical experiment.
   In September, an Afghan and a Soviet cosmonaut were forced to
postpone the landing of their Soyuz TM-5 capsule for a day because
of equipment and crew errors. They touched down safely a day late
but were running dangerously low on food and air.
   In December, two Soviet cosmonauts returned from the Mir after
breaking the record for the longest time in space after a year-long
stay.

<TEXT>
   Thousands of striking workers and
students fought police with firebombs and clubs in four cities
today and dissidents vowed to go ahead with mass demonstrations
this weekend despite a government ban.
   About 10,000 striking workers from 12 factories clashed with
riot police in Changwon for a fourth straight day to demand the
release of jailed strike leaders, police said.
   Workers swarmed into the streets, hurling firebombs and rocks at
police, who fired volleys of tear gas and made shield charges.
   Another 3,000 strikers clashed with riot police in the nearby
port of Masan after marching through the city. Protesters burned
down an office of the governing Democratic Justice Party, according
to Yonhap, the South Korean news agency.
   Police officials, who declined to be named, said two riot
troopers were seriously injured in Changwon, but they had no
further details on injuries.
   Radical students also clashed with riot police in Seoul and the
southern city of Kwangju. About 1,000 students battled police at
Kwangju's Chonam University after burning effigies of President Roh
Tae-woo and President Bush.
   The clashes came as dissidents vowed to proceed with plans for
protests this weekend despite government warnings that police would
block any protest.
   The United National Democratic Movement, the main dissident
alliance, said the government had no right to ban a major labor
rally scheduled for Sunday in Seoul. Alliance leaders said police
would be responsible for any violence.
   ``We are ready to break down any police blockade if police use
illegal means to block our peaceful rally,'' the alliance said in a
statement.
   About 30 labor leaders were arrested today in police raids in
Seoul as the government moved against radical labor groups, police
said. Those arrested faced charges of staging illegal strikes, they
said.
   Radical student groups, which have said they will support the
labor rally, said they would go ahead with a march Friday from
Seoul to the North Korean border for talks with communist students
on reuniting the Korean peninsula and taking part in an
international youth festival in Pyongyang in July.
   Police have banned the student march. Several attempts last year
by radical students to march to the border triggered rioting in
Seoul and other cities.
   The radical students have been staging almost daily violent
campus protests in recent weeks to demand the overthrow of the Roh
government. The radicals and allied dissident groups lack popular
support because of their extremism and are not seen as a threat to
the Roh government.
   But government leaders are concerned about growing labor unrest
and a wave of increasinlgy violent strikes for better pay and
improved working conditions. Student and dissident groups are
attempting to unite with workers to build an anti-government
alliance.
   Top opposition leaders warned Wednesday that continued unrest
could undermine democratic development in South Korea.
   Dissident leaders claim Roh is a front for military rule and
demand the former general step down. Roh won elections in December,
1987 after rival opposition candidates split the opposition vote.

<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Maybe, President Bush says, Ann Richards
was right.
   The Texas treasurer had ridiculed Bush at last summer's
Democratic National Convention, saying he had been ``born with a
silver foot in his mouth.''
   Bush referred to her remark after he flubbed a line in his
speech Wednesday to a joint session of the Texas Legislature.
   ``You know, I've been thinking about it. Ann Richards was
right,'' Bush said to appreciative laughter and applause.
   ``Look, I kept putting that silver foot in my mouth all along
the way,'' he said. ``But the bottom line is, when they ask,
`Where's George?' _ say he's in Austin, among friends, and very
proud to be back.''
   Ms. Richards, who had a front-row seat for the president's
address, wore the foot-shaped silver pin that Bush previously sent
her.
   ``I thought it was appropriate that I wear it today. When a
gentleman sends you jewelry and he comes to town, well, you want to
be sure and wear it.''
   Bush devoted much of his address to reminiscences about his 1948
move to Texas and his deep affection for the state.
   Raised in Connecticut and owner of a home in Kennebunkport,
Maine, Bush took some ribbing from Democrats during the 1988
campaign over his claim to Texas, where his address now is a
Houston hotel.
   ``Let me just say a few words about what it means to be a Texan.
My credentials,'' Bush said. ``I have my driver's license here. I
have my Texas hunting license here. And somewhere, my voter
registration slip.
   ``And it is true, I like Kennebunkport. But I am a Texan. I just
want to clear the air and say a few words about that.''
   Unlike Alamo hero Davy Crockett, Bush said, he didn't ride to
Texas on a horse but in a red Studebaker.
   ``I'll admit it. I didn't know if a chicken fried steak was a
chicken fried like a steak or a steak that tasted like a chicken.
But I've learned,'' he said.

   Thunderstorms that left one person dead continued to bring hail
and damaging winds from Iowa to North Carolina today.
   In central Iowa, strong winds in Granger toppled a newly erected
wall over a 21-year-old construction worker Wednesday. Leroy
Lundberg died instantly, according to State Medical Examiner Thomas
Bennett.
   Winds reached up to 75 mph and tornadoes and golf ball-size hail
were reported as the thunderstorms swept across the state.
   In Illinois, thunderstorms Wednesday spawned a tornado in the
western part of the state near Carrollton and winds gusting up to
68 mph blew the windows out of homes in Casey near the Indiana
border.
   Thunderstorm winds also downed trees and power lines in parts of
North Carolina and Indiana. Golf ball-size hail fell near

<HEAD>Crippled Exxon Tanker Arrives in Port Angeles</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A Exxon tanker loaded with 22 million gallons of
oil lost power and drifted for nearly seven hours before it was
towed into harbor early today to undergo engine repairs, a Coast
Guard spokesman said.
   The 810-foot Exxon Philadelphia had drifted away from land, in
an area without reefs and in water 600 feet deep. Seas were calm
and winds were mild.
   Coast Guard Petty Officer Michael Cobb said the ship arrived at
Port Angeles at about 1 a.m. today, under tow by a tugboat. Two
other tugboats were dispatched and traveled alongside the tanker in
case of problems, Cobb said.
   The U.S. Coast Guard and the Canadian Coast Guard also sent
ships and planes to monitor the situation and to be available in
case of an emergency. Cobb said it may take a couple of days to
repair the damage to the tanker's propulsion system.
   The single-hulled tanker was about nine miles off Cape Flattery
and 12 miles west of the entrance to the Strait of Juan de Fuca
when a boiler tube failed about 8:30 a.m. Wednesday, shutting down
the propulsion system, said Joe Tucker of Exxon in Valdez, Alaska.
The crew of 20 never was in danger, Tucker said.
   The incident occurred about a month after the tanker Exxon
Valdez ran aground near Valdez, dumping 11.2 million gallons of
crude oil into Prince William Sound.
   The Philadelphia, built in 1970, was inspected in a shipyard a
month ago, Tucker said.
   The tanker left the Alaska pipeline terminal at Valdez early
Sunday to deliver crude oil to a refinery in Anacortes, about 65
miles north of Seattle, said Tucker.
   It carried 532,862 barrels of oil, or 22.38 million gallons,
according to the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation in
Valdez.

   Communist Party leaders warned in a heated debate
over their losses in balloting for a new legislature that the party
is in danger of losing both its unity and its hold on the Soviet
people.
   In response, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev rebuked several
officials, including non-voting Politburo member Yuri F. Solovyov
of Leningrad, for losing faith in his reform campaign.
   Statements of Central Committee members published today in the
party newspaper Pravda revealed an unprecedented open dispute in
the party's policy-making body about the party's political course.
   Gorbachev told the meeting of the committee during a closed-door
session Tuesday that the election results were a victory because
they showed the people back his reforms.
   The party cannot afford to slow down or lose control of the
reform process it started, he said.
   ``If we lose initiative, allow a lagging behind, serious if not
irreparable damage will be done to the cause of restructuring with
the resulting additional moral, social, political and economic
confusion,'' Gorbachev said.
   The debate took place in a meeting where the Central Committee
accepted the resignations of 74 of its 301 members, most of whom
through age, illness or political disgrace had lost the government
or party job that entitled them to membership. The move
strengthened Gorbachev's grip on the policy-making body.
   Solovyov was among at least three dozen senior party and
government officials who went down to an embarrassing defeat in
March 26 elections to the Congress of People's Deputies.
   It was the country's first contested vote in seven decades.
   Gorbachev also criticized the Leningrad party for a lack of
openness and failing to push reforms hard enough.
   Perestroika _ the program Gorbachev launched four years ago to
overhaul the Soviet economy and society _ remains the proper
course, he said, but reforms are not being properly enacted,
particularly by local leaders.
   ``I think, comrades, and this is opinion of the entire Politburo
_ that we can no longer put up with mismanagement that literally
compromises perestroika and does a tremendous damage _ economic and
moral _ to the whole of society.''
   Gorbachev said that in many areas the economy has deteriorated
and food and housing shortages are increasing, in part because
economic reforms were not fully thought out before implementation.
   He said many problems can be traced to wasteful government
spending.
   ``The food problem is far from solved,'' the president said.
``The housing problem is acute. There is a dearth of consumer goods
in the shops. The list of shortages is growing.''
   People ``see all these ugliest facts of mismanagement and justly
demand a strict punishment of the culprits, not because of
vengeance but to assert the realization that it is inadmissible and
impossible to throw the people's resources to the winds,''
Gorbachev said.
   ``The state's financial position is grave,'' the 58-year-old
leader said. The budget deficit is expected to hit $162 billion
this year, economists say.
   In one pointed attack, Gorbachev singled out those responsible
for particular failures, such as importing millions of syringes
with no needles.
   The construction industry ``has been shoveling billions of
rubles into the ground and is creating actual ruins.'' Building a
factory to produce detergent is in its ninth year, while people
face daily shortages of soap and detergent, he said.
   Individual workers share the blame, he said.
   ``Many forgot how to work. They got used to being paid often
just for coming to work.''
   Gorbachev blamed poor agricultural production on ``the work
level, initiative and responsibility of local leaders.''
   He said the problem became especially acute after the central
leadership began delegating some power and decision-making to the
local level.
   When people turn to local bureaucrats for help, they encounter
``the old atmosphere, where every visitor is looked down upon as
being very nearly persona non grata,'' he complained. ``This causes
special resentment.''
   In this week's housecleaning of the Soviet leadership, the
Central Committee removed 110 senior officials. Many had already
retired or been ousted from posts entitling them to seats on the
committee or its financial arm.
   Gorbachev said many leaders were caught in an ``inertia of old
thinking ... One generation of party members has naturally to
replace another. This process should be perceived as such.''
   Observers said many of those retired were the so-called ``dead
souls,'' holdovers from the era of the late Leonid Brezhnev.
   Gorbachev also noted crime has risen as society has become more
democratic, especially in areas where nationalism is on the rise.
   He pledged a thorough investigation of the April 9 clash in
which 20 pro-independence demonstrators in the southern republic of
Georgia were killed.

   Families of the 47 sailors killed in an
explosion aboard the battleship USS Iowa should begin receiving
benefits checks within a month, government officials say.
   All 47 crewmen carried the maximum of $50,000 in life insurance
available under a military policy administered by the Department of
Veterans Affairs, said John Brizzi, counsel to the House Veterans
Affairs subcommittee on compensation, pensions and insurance. Those
checks will be mailed by the end of May, he said.
   The sailors' dependents also will receive monthly benefits
checks sent to the families of any service member killed while on
duty, Brizzi said Wednesday.
   ``They'll receive a lot of assistance here because this is an
abnormal case,'' he said.
   Aside from the insurance payment and monthly benefits checks,
the families will get six month's salary from the Department of
Defense. The military also will pay for funeral costs for the
sailors who died when an explosion tore through a ship turret
during a training exercise April 19.
   The families will receive medical coverage and educational
benefits as well, Brizzi said.
   A private fund-raising drive sponsored by Shearson Lehman
Hutton's Norfolk office also has received more than $35,000 in
contributions. The money will be divided equally among the families.

<HEAD>1 Killed, 32 Wounded In Israel</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israeli soldiers today shot and killed one
Palestinian and wounded 32 in clashes in the occupied lands, Arab
reports said.
   Also today, an aide said Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir will not
offer an alternative to his election proposal for the occupied
lands now that it has been rejected by prominent Palestinians there.
   Hospital officials said Imad Muhammad Harbieh, 20, of the Askar
refugee camp near Nablus died of a gunshot wound to the chest. Arab
reporters said he was shot after troops trying to enter the camp
opened fire to disperse several masked youths throwing stones and
empty bottles.
   Twenty-six Palestinians, including an 11-year-old boy hit in the
left shoulder, were wounded by gunfire in a half-dozen clashes in
the Gaza Strip and six Palestinians were wounded in the West Bank,
Arab reports said.
   The army, which does not include victims treated for injuries
and released, said only three Palestinians were wounded in the West
Bank. It had no information on the death or the Gaza clashes,
spokesmen said.
   Palestinians observed a general strike to express solidarity
with their brethren killed in the nearly 17-month uprising against
Israeli occupation.
   The strike came a day after three Palestinian youths were shot
to death and about 60 wounded, most in Gaza.
   The deaths raised to 451 the number of Palestinians killed in
the uprising. Eighteen Israelis also have died during the unrest.
   On Wednesday, 83 local Palestinians issued the first formal
response to Shamir's election plan. They rejected the idea of
balloting before Israel withdrew its troops from occupied areas.
   Shamir's proposal calls for elections to be held to select
representatives to negotiate with Israel on an interim solution to
the occupied lands. The aim of the talks would be to agree on an
autonomy scheme for Palestinian self-rule in the occupied lands.
   Palestinians fear the temporary solution would become permanent.
   ``This is the best program we can suggest to them,'' said Shamir
spokesman Yossi Ahimeir. He said Shamir didn't view the rejection
as final and would ask U.S. officials to press Palestinians to
reconsider.
   Shamir was quoted by Israel radio as telling an audience
Wednesday night that his proposals were ``generous and logical''
and that Palestinians would be ``mistaken'' if they thought they
could hold out for more later.
   In taped remarks from the same gathering broadcast by army
radio, Shamir said: ``We have heard an announcement from some of
our neighbors that they reject our proposals. I hope this is not
their last word.''
   The Palestinians insisted on an international peace conference
with participation of the PLO, proposals Shamir has rejected. They
did not rule out elections entirely but said balloting should be
one step in a process toward an overall settlement that they want
to end in statehood.
   In a leaflet distributed today, the clandestine PLO-backed
Unified National Leadership of the Uprising turned down Shamir's
plan. ``Our people categorically reject the U.S.-backed plan and
the attempts to market it to the Palestinians and the Arabs,'' it
said.
   Underground leaders demanded in the leaflet that Arab states
convene a summit to press for an international conference

<HEAD>Millionaire Tax-Evader's Homeless Study Presented in Court</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A study on the homeless that was funded by
millionaire industrialist Victor Posner as part of a criminal
tax-evasion sentence was outlined in federal court.
   The 800-page study, including graphs, charts and other
documents, was unveiled Wednesday and provided guidelines for
changes in community action, funding and policy to ease the plight
of the homeless in South Florida.
   The $267,000 study was meant as a guide for Posner, who must
recommend a spending plan for easing problems of the homeless as
part of an innovative sentence that kept him out of jail in the tax
case. Two probation officers sat through the proceedings to monitor
Posner's progress.
   Principal author David Fike of Barry University summarized 42
primary study points for a committee headed by former Dade County
administrator Dewey Knight, who was appointed by U.S. District
Judge Eugene P. Spellman to oversee the $3 million fund Posner
created.
   The $267,000 study was paid for out of the interest-bearing
fund, which now has a balance of $3,015,000, said Sister Jeanne
O'Laughlin, president of Barry University, which directed the
effort.
   Sister O'Laughlin said she expected Posner would present his
plan soon.
   ``I think he is ready now. He has it in his mind and I think he
could do it within the week,'' she said. ``It is my impression that
he wants it to be family-oriented.''
   Posner pleaded no contest in September 1987 to evading $1.2
million in federal income taxes by overestimating the value of
property in Dade County he donated to Miami Christian College.
   At his sentencing last year, Spellman placed Posner on five
years' probation on the condition that he pay all of his back
taxes, penalites and interest, the cost of prosecution of his case
and create the $3 million homeless fund.
   The penalty package totaled about $7.75 million _ more than six
times the amount Posner was accused of defrauding from the Internal
Revenue Service.
   Among the study's findings: homeless drug addicts and the
mentally ill with severe disabilities would benefit from
professional rehabilitation, more residential services were needed
for homeless people with AIDS, prevention measures should be taken
to keep female-headed families from becoming homeless, South
Florida lacks day-care centers for homeless children, and zoning
and code enforcement rules could help people stay in their homes
during rehabilitation and discourage deterioration of low-income
housing.

   Harper &amp; Row has agreed to pay $9.6 million for
reprint rights to 33 titles by Agatha Christie, a bid that far
exceeded what the auction had been expected to bring, The New York
Times reported today.
   The agreement amounts to almost $300,000 for each title,
including such classics as ``Murder on the Orient Express'' and
``Death on the Nile.''
   It takes effect on Oct. 1, 1991. Harper's will then be able to
publish the books for eight years and three months, after which
several titles go into the public domain.
   G.P. Putnam's, which conducted the 14-hour auction Monday on
behalf of the Christie estate, had established a minimum bid of
$2.9 million.
   Five publishing houses entered the title auction and stayed in
until the sixth round, when bidding topped $7 million, according to
Diane Gedymin, Putnam's subsidiary rights director.
   Harper's and Pocket Books continued for eight more rounds as
Pocket Books, which currently publishes the 33 Christie titles,
fought to retain them.

<TEXT>
   After people prayed for rain to relieve
a drought, two tornadoes and heavy rains battered rural Bangladesh,
killing at least 176 people and injuring hundreds, the state news
agency said today.
   The agency, Bangladesh Sangbad Sangstha, did not cite a source
for the death toll but gave the figure in a story that said
President Hussain Muhammad Ershad had ordered relief and rescue
operations for victims of a tornado Wednesday night in the
Manikganj area.
   An independent news agency, United News of Bangladesh, put the
death toll at 42, citing reports from its correspondent in
Manikganj, 25 miles northwest of Dhaka. The tornado, with winds of
100 mph, hailstones, and drenching showers came hours after Ershad
ordered nationwide prayers for rain.
   In Dhaka alone, more than 75,000 people joined Ershad in a
prayer service.
   Two months of drought had threatened to destroy more than half
the rice crop in this poverty-stricken nation. Agriculture
officials said more rain would be needed in the coming week to save
the crops.
   The government news agency said 22 bodies were found in the
rubble of fallen mud and straw houses. The news agency did not give
details.
   At least 200 of the injured were hospitalized, the
government-owned newspaper Dainik Bangla said. It said scores of
people were missing after their boats capsized on the Padma River,
25 miles northwest of Dhaka.
   Another tornado hit the Narsingdi district, 25 miles east of the
capital, killing five people and injuring 500, the English-language
New Nation said. The independent daily said about 200,000 people
were affected by the tornadoes.
   The newspapers said thousands of mud-and-straw houses were swept
away. The tornadoes snapped communications links between Dhaka and
much of the country.
   Bangladesh, one of the world's poorest countries with a per
capita annual income of $160, alternates between flood and drought.
Agriculture is the main occupation of the majority of the country's
110 million people.

   Twenty bandits armed with pistols and
machine guns raided a Colgate Palmolive factory today and escaped
with $740,000 worth of soap, toothpaste, bubble bath and shampoo,
police and company officials said.
   The bandits, who arrived with a dozen trucks to transport their
loot, burst into the factory in this seaside city 35 miles south of
Rome shortly after midnight, police said.
   The bandits locked about 80 workers in a company truck and at
gunpoint forced another 20 workers to load up the gang's trucks
with the toilet articles. The gang then forced the rest of the
workers into the company truck and drove off, according to the
police account.
   ``The bandits were calm and very professional. They looked
through the lists of merchandise to decide what they wanted to
steal,'' the Italian news agency ANSA quoted an unidentified
company employee as saying.
   Police said the gang remained in the plant for about four hours.
The workers freed themselves about a half hour later and called
police.
   A spokesman for the U.S.-owned company confirmed the police
report.
   Police speculated that the robbers may have been members of the
Camorra, an organized crime syndicate based in Naples.

<HEAD>American Publisher Pulls Out Of Tehran Book Fair</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of two American publishing companies that
planned to display books at a book fair in Iran next month has
withdrawn, citing questions about the fair's legitimacy.
   John Wiley &amp; Sons, a major publisher of technical and scientific
books, had agreed more than a year ago to be in the fair. It
shipped books for display to Iran soon afterward but had not
intended to send anyone to Tehran.
   Spokesman Leonard Harris said that because books already are in
Tehran, Wiley titles may be put on display, but the publisher was
disassociating itself from the fair because of what it has learned
recently.
   ``First, visas have not been granted by Iran to any members of
the European community or to Americans to participate in the fair
in Tehran,'' the publisher said in a statement Wednesday.
   ``Second, Iran is excluding the books of some publishers. Given
these facts, Wiley should not be considered a participant in the
fair,'' it said.
   The biennial fair May 7-19 is conducted by the Iran Ministry of
Islamic Culture and generally concentrates on scientific, medical
and technical books.
   McGraw-Hill, the other publisher planning to participate, will
be there through its company in England, McGraw-Hill Book Co. (UK)
Ltd., said spokesman Donald S. Rubin.
   ``We don't anticipate anyone going with the books,'' said Rubin.
``We have an independent sales agent who sells our books and those
of other publishers. He's an Iranian national.''
   Rubin said about 50 publishers worldwide would participate in
the fair.
   Wiley and McGraw-Hill were criticized by the Authors' Guild and
by the publisher of Salman Rushdie's books. Rushdie is the author
of ``The Satanic Verses,'' a fictional work many Moslems have found
offensive and that caused Iran's leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini, to issue a death threat against him.
   Guild President Robert K. Massie said he was appalled that any
Western publisher ``would deal with any organization in Iran as
long as the death threat on Salman Rushdie is in place.''
   Viking Penguin, Rushdie's U.S. publisher, said in a statement it
doubted ``anyone could fail to recognize the moral questions''
raised by participating.
   ``Obviously we deplore the death threat that was made,'' Rubin
responded. ``But we don't think censorship is the answer to that.
Authors should be free to write and publishers free to distribute
their books. Anything less than that is a blow to anyone's
liberty.''
   Philosophy and safety both figured in decisions of publishers to
skip the Tehran fair, said Thomas D. McKee, executive vice
president of the Association of American Publishers.
   He said the modest-sized fair would have been a low priority for
most publishers anyway.

   Rebels attacked a Burmese town early
today and killed at least seven people, according to reports from
the Burmese government and from people who said they fled the
ambush.
   Karen rebels fired rocket-propelled grenades into houses in the
town of Myawaddy and shot at those who tried to escape their
burning homes, said refugees who crossed the border into Thailand.
   More than 180 houses and government buildings and 30 trucks were
set ablaze during the 2 a.m. attack, and at least 16 people
wounded, the refugees said.
   In Burma's capital, Rangoon, government spokesman Kyaw Sann told
a news conference the town was attacked by 150 rebels. He said two
policemen and five civilians were killed and nine others, including
four soldiers, were injured.
   The refugees said 12 people died and that all were Burmese
except for one Thai who was visiting the town, just across the Moei
River border.
   Thai officials said 14 Burmese were sent to the Mae Sot
hospital, eight in serious condition. Two Thais also were injured.
   The Karens withdrew from Myawaddy after 3 a.m. but continued
firing to prevent residents from putting out the fires, the
refugees said.
   They said guerrillas came from two nearby Karen camps and
attacked while most of the Burmese government soldiers normally
occupying the town were away.
   The Karens have been sporadically attacking Myawaddy, 165 miles
east of Rangoon, since February. Thai officials say the attacks are
retaliation for government assaults on Karen bases.
   Government forces have captured two major Karen strongholds
along the Thai border _ Maela and Maw Poh Kay _ in the past month.
   Guerrillas of the Karen ethnic minority have been fighting the
government since Burma achieved independence from Britain in 1948.

   George Coulouris, an English actor best known for
playing villains during a long film and stage career that included
a role in the movie ``Citizen Kane,'' has died, his wife said
today. He was 85.
   Coulouris died Tuesday of heart failure brought on by
Parkinson's disease, Elizabeth Coulouris said from their north
London home.
   Born Oct. 1, 1903 to a Greek father and English mother in
Salford, central England, Coulouris ran away from home to become an
actor against his businessman father's wishes.
   He attended the prestigious Central School of Speech and Drama,
studying with Peggy Ashcroft and Laurence Olivier.
   He went to New York in 1929, landed his first major stage roles,
and worked at the Mercury Theater founded by Orson Welles. He later
followed Welles to Hollywood, acting in the Welles-directed
``Citizen Kane,'' released in 1941.
   He began playing villains with his portrayal of blackmailer with
Nazi connections in the 1943 film of Lillian Hellman's ``Watch on
the Rhine.''
   ``I don't think he thought of himself as someone who only worked
as a villain,'' Mrs. Coulouris told The Associated Press. ``But I
don't think he minded. He enjoyed it because he did it well.''
   In the 1950s, Coulouris moved back to London and continued
playing a range of characters on stage, including Big Daddy in
``Cat on a Hot Tin Roof.'' He once listed his favorite stage roles
as Othello, Macbeth and King Lear.
   He also appeared in the films ``Hotel Berlin,'' ``The Verdict,''
``Confidential Agent,'' ``Murder on the Orient Express,''
``Papillon,'' ``The Antichrist,'' and ``Mahler.''
   Coulouris is survived by a son and a daughter from his first
wife, Louise, who died in 1976. Mrs. Coulouris said funeral
arrangements were private.

   The jury in Oliver North's trial resumed
deliberating his fate today on 12 criminal charges as it entered
its sixth day plowing through 363 exhibits totaling some 1,300
pages.
   The office of U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell said
Wednesday that all of the jurors were bearing up well, following
earlier health problems reported by several members.
   Since Monday, when juror Jean Johnson complained of high blood
pressure problems, courthouse nurses have made regular visits to
the jury. They also gave non-prescription medicines to two jurors
who complained of chest colds.
   The trial, almost 3 months old, produced 187 government and 176
defense exhibits that are in the courtroom with the jurors as they
consider the charges.
   North is accused of lying to Congress to cover up his role in
secretly assisting the Nicaraguan Contras and lying to the attorney
general about aspects of the diversion of funds to the Contras from
the Iran arms sales. He also is accused of illegally converting
traveler's checks from a Contra leader to his personal use,
accepting a $13,800 home security system from Iran-Contra
co-defendant Richard Secord and conspiring to defraud the Treasury.
   On seven of those counts, if North is found innocent, the jury
also must decide whether or not he is guilty of aiding and abetting
in the activity, another felony.
   Nine of the charges carry maximum penalties of five years in
prison and fines of $250,000 each. The other charges have maximum
penalties each of 10 years, 3 years and 2 years, along with
$250,000 fines _ a total of 60 years and fines of $3 million as a
maximum if he is convicted on all counts.
   Meanwhile, the Justice Department is seeking a federal appeals
court order that Gesell conduct a further hearing on a motion by
The Associated Press and nine other news organizations to inspect a
sealed trial exhibit.
   The exhibit is a stipulation summarizing top secret intercepts
by the National Security Agency concerning a November 1985
CIA-assisted shipment of Hawk missiles to Iran. North's lawyers
used the stipulation in an attempt to show the jury that top Reagan
administration officials knew at the time of the plane's cargo.
   North's defense of one of the charges against him is that his
superiors knew Hawks were aboard the flight, but tried to cover up
by saying that no one at the CIA knew until January 1986 that the
missiles had been shipped.
   The Justice Department wants a further hearing to ``afford the
government the opportunity to establish a basis for denying the
press the access it now seeks'' to the document that was shown only
to jurors, the department said.
   Alternatively, the government asked for 14 days in which to file
a brief with the appeals court responding to the news
organizations' motion.
   The Justice Department noted that it could have contested the
relevancy of the stipulation under the Classified Information
Procedures Act.
   ``To minimize the disruption of the proceedings at the final
stages of the case, however, it agreed to the less time-consuming
alternative of permitting the (unedited) stipulation to go to the
jury with the understanding that it would not be subsequently
disclosed,'' the department said.

<TEXT>
   Presidents who don't use the media, especially
television, to build a relationship with the electorate will find
themselves without a base when a crisis develops, said a panel
discussing ``The Presidency in the '90s.''
   ``Presidents win support in these times not because the public
agrees with them on their ideology or their policies or on
substantive issues, but because they come to like them over
television,'' Lesley Stahl, White House correspondent for CBS News,
said at the Fordham University seminar Wednesday.
   President Reagan was able to weather the crises of his tenure
because of his personal popularity. ``Reagan became adored by the
public because the White House manipulated very brilliantly'' the
media with staged events and photo opportunities, she said.
   President Bush has not done that, she said, adding, ``I kind of
respect it, but it's not doing him any good.''
   Other panelists said, however, that media manipulation is
worthless if the president or candidate has nothing substantive to
say.
   ``That is equally as important in politics if not more
important,'' said David Gergen, an editor at U.S. News and World
Report. ``Jesse Jackson does not attract followers because he's got
media people. He's got something to say.''
   The point was echoed at an earlier seminar Wednesday on the
presidential selection process.
   ``Every time a candidate breaks through the puerility of the
debate, whether it's Jesse Jackson and his `working poor' litany or
George Bush's acceptance speech (at the Republican convention), you
can feel the public almost come alive, say, `More, please give us
more,''' said Jeff Greenfield, political and media adviser for ABC
News.
   Greenfield also defended political advertising as admittedly ``a
short and clumsy way to get to know a candidate. Yet even within
those limits, you pick up something.''
   Roger Ailes, Bush's media adviser, defended the advertising he
crafted for Bush last year against charges that it was too negative
or unfair.
   ``Look at `trash TV,' look at the lines blurring between tabloid
journalism and journalism, look at the garbage that is out there in
general,'' Ailes said. ``I would submit that the political
campaigns are among the cleanest things on television today.''
   But NBC News commentator John Chancellor, who moderated the
seminar, said that since presidential candidates are spending
public money _ about $41 million each in 1988 _ ``we ought to have
some say in how they spend it.''
   Kathleen Hall Jamieson, an expert on presidential politics from
the University of Texas at Austin, suggested a nonpartisan panel be
instituted to review political advertising and rule on its fairness
and accuracy.
   Negative campaigning was one of the factors that turn people off
and keep them away from the polls on Election Day, said Ron Brown,
chairman of the Democratic National Committee.
   But Greenfield said he believed the role of television was
exaggerated. ``You run the 1988 campaign with 10 percent
unemployment and you have a very different result,'' he said.
   The five seminars Wednesday and today at Fordham were organized
as part of New York City's commemoration of the bicentennial of
George Washington's presidential inauguration.

   More than 150,000 students and supporters of
their pro-democracy campaign burst past a police line today and
triumphantly filled Tiananmen Square, defying communist leaders'
threat of a crackdown.
   ``We have created history today. History will not forget us. The
people will not forget us,'' a student leader shouted through a
megaphone to students in the 100-acre square, China's symbolic seat
of power.
   Trucks filled with soldiers circled the square to act as a
barricade, but marchers swarmed onto the trucks.
   They shouted ``Welcome 38th Army!'' and handed out leaflets to
soldiers explaining their demands for sweepings changes in China's
autocratic system, including press freedom and accountability of
the country's leaders.
   The trucks were immobilized by the mob, and within minutes the
vast square was turned into a sea of waving white-and-red student
banners and protesters chanted pro-reform slogans.
   The students did not try to occupy the square but continued
their march down Changan Boulevard, the capital's main
thoroughfare. They then headed back to their campuses, declaring
they had scored a victory by reaching the square.
   While the march was going on, the government partially acceded
to the students' demand for dialogue, saying it was ready to hold
talks with them ``at any time.'' But the statement said talks would
have to be conducted through official student organizations, which
the protesters have rejected.
   The evening television news carried lengthy official comments
reiterating the government's pre-march statements condemning
student-generated ``turmoil.''
   ``The broad masses of students ... want to promote democracy and
end corruption. That we understand and are in agreement with,'' the
Beijing city government said. ``But a minority of people ... reject
the leadership of the party and government and want to return our
country to the chaos of the Cultural Revolution.''
   The 1966-76 Cultural Revolution was a leftist campaign that
turned into near civil war.
   The Communist Party and Beijing government on Wednesday issued
stern warnings that the student protests, now in their 11th day,
are illegal and further street demonstrations would be crushed.
   But students and a growing hoard of supporters pushed their way
through police barriers across half a dozen intersections along the
nine-mile route from campuses in northwest Beijing to the center of
the city.
   When three truckloads of armed police pulled up at one
intersection, they were surrounded by a crowd shouting ``People
love the people's police, the people's police love people.''
   By the time the students reached the square, more than eight
hours after the march began, they were far outnumbered by workers
and residents had who joined them, and the soldiers who had been
guarding the square faded out of sight.
   Thousands of people leaned out windows and cheered as the
marchers surged by. Kindergarten children stood at the gate of
their school and applauded, and patients wearing bathrobes emerged
from a hospital to accept pamphlets the students were handing out.
   Students with arms linked sang the national anthem and shouted
``Long live democracy.''
   Others shouted ``Down with bureaucracy, down with corruption,''
oft-repeated phrases during the demonstrations and class boycotts
that have shaken the communist government.
   Student leaders called on students from dozens of Beijing
universities to march to Tiananmen Square to protest harsh
government statements condemning their campaign for democracy.
   The government has accused the student activists of a ``planned
conspiracy'' to overthrow the government.
   The students have called for Premier Li Peng to resign and say
senior leader Deng Xiaoping, 84, is too old to rule. But most say
their campaign is not anti-government.
   They have appealed for free speech and press, an end to rampant
corruption in government and more funding for education.
   ``Strongly support the good leaders of the party,'' read one
banner.
   The demonstrations were sparked by the April 15 death of ousted
Communist Party chief Hu Yaobang, a reformer.
   The demonstrations have been much larger, and gained far more
popular support, than pro-democracy student demonstrations of
1986-87 that led to Hu being ousted for failing to crack down on
the students.

   Negotiations on a global chemical weapons ban
recessed today with delegates reporting a positive atmosphere but
no progress on major issues holding up completion of a draft treaty.
   French envoy Pierre Morel, who chaired the talks, said results
at the latest 15-week session ``may appear as falling short of the
ambitions'' set by the 149-nation conference on chemical weapons in
January.
   That Paris meeting called on negotiators to redouble efforts to
finish their work, which dates back to 1968.
   Morel suggested in a written progress report that ``real and
intensive negotiations'' have yet to begin at the chemical arms
talks in the 40-nation Conference on Disarmament. He said ``actual
progress'' would be sought when the conference reconvenes in June.
   Morel said more than 18 countries have carried out trial
inspections of their national chemical industries, a move aimed at
helping negotiators design ways to police a future ban.
   But disagreement persisted, as in past years, on precisely these
provisions for monitoring compliance and on several other issues,
East German delegate Peter Dietze told the closing meeting of the
conference's spring session.
   The Soviet Union and three Soviet bloc countries have submitted
reports on national inspections to the conference, while the United
States and Britain are among those expected to report at the next
session, Morel said.
   Morel's report showed that one problem facing negotiators is
that poison gas can easily be produced with readily available
chemicals in plants not specially designed for the purpose. Some
Western experts have said total monitoring of a chemical weapons
treaty is not feasible.
   Negotiators are seeking to complete a global convention banning
the production, use and stockpiling of chemical arms. The talks are
the priority agenda item at the disarmament conference, the world's
only multilateral arms negotiating forum.

<TEXT>
   A federal grand jury has indicted Biloxi
Mayor Gerald Blessey, his law partner, a former U.S. Department of
Housing and Urban Development official and others on extortion,
fraud or perjury charges.
   The indictments came Wednesday as the grand jury wrapped up a
two-year investigation into Biloxi politics.
   Later in the day, Blessey's former law partner and campaign
manager, Mike Cavanaugh, resigned from his post as state bond
attorney.
   Blessey and Cavanaugh were indicted on one count each of
extortion and conspiracy to commit extortion. The charges stem from
allegations by state Auditor Pete Johnson that Blessey and two
other city officials diverted $2.4 million in bond proceeds to
other city uses.
   Blessey, who isn't seeking re-election to the post he has held
for nearly eight years, has denounced the investigation as
politically motivated.
   Blessey and Reba Capers, director of the Greater Biloxi
Development Foundation, were indicted on one count each of
conspiracy to defraud the United States and two counts each of mail
fraud. Blessey also was indicted on a separate count of attempted
extortion, while Capers was re-indicted on six counts of perjury,
charges that had earlier been lodged against her but dropped.
   Capers said last week she will resign her post, effective in
June.
   DuBois Gilliam, the former HUD official, was charged with one
count of conspiracy to defraud the federal government and four
counts of accepting a gratuity. Former City Councilman Roy Mattina
was indicted on four counts of perjury.
   If convicted, Blessey faces up to 75 years in prison and $1.5
million in fines, Capers faces up to 45 years in prison and $2.25
million in fines, Mattina faces up to 20 years in prison and $1
million in fines, Cavanaugh faces up to 40 years in prison and
$500,000 in fines, and Gilliam faces 13 years in prison and $1.25
million in fines.

<TEXT>
   Dan Quayle, noting he is the first
American vice president born after World War II, celebrated with
Australians today the allied effort 47 years ago to beat back
Japanese forces advancing toward this nation.
   Quayle, on a five-day visit to this island nation to commemorate
Australian-American Friendship Week, said the two countries must
dedicate their relationship ``to keeping peace in this region.''
   At a black-tie dinner, Quayle, 42, discussed the spirit of
cooperation that took place in May 1942 when American and
Australian naval forces turned back the Japanese at the Battle of
the Coral Sea off the northeast coast of Australia.
   The vice president, who arrived here from Canberra, read a
proclamation from President Bush that said the relationship between
the United States and Australia ``has thrived in peace because of
our mutual respect, shared ideals and coordinated strides toward a
more secure and prosperous world.''
   Earlier today, Quayle toured a National Aeronautics and Space
Administration facility deep in the Australian bush and called the
resignations of several top NASA officials a problem the
administration must confront.
   Quayle, on his second day in Australia on his trip to the
Pacific, visited the Tidbinbilla Space Tracking Station, which is
managed by Australia's space office on behalf of NASA.
   The station where three giant satellite dishes keep tabs on
satellites will track the Magellan satellite that is to be carried
into space by the space shuttle Atlantis on Friday.
   Quayle earlier met with Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke and
his top Cabinet officials. In a speech after those meetings, he
praised the U.S.-Australia alliance and called on the Soviet Union
to take concrete steps to lessen military tensions in the Pacific
region.
   During his visit to the space tracking station, Quayle placed a
telephone call to Charles Bolden, an astronaut stationed at the
Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral.
   ``How are you doing ... Any good?'' Quayle asked Bolden as the
two chatted about the upcoming Atlantis launch. ``We hope and pray
everything goes well,'' said Quayle, who has recently taken a keen
interest in space policy as the head of the National Space Council.
   Asked about the recent resignations of six top NASA officials,
including James Odom, head of the space station project, Quayle
said, ``It was an interesting problem.''
   The NASA officials cited low pay and potentially tougher ethics
legislation the Bush administration has asked Congress to consider.
Some of the rules are aimed at tightening the ``revolving door''
for federal workers, which would close job opportunities in the
private sector for NASA officials.
   ``We'll just have to work with Congress and work within the
administration to see if there is anything to adjust the
regulations,'' Quayle said.
   Higher pay for NASA workers should also be considered, he said.
   Before leaving the space complex, Quayle gave Thomas Reid, a
former head of Tidbinbilla, a NASA award.
   Quayle told reporters at the National Press Club after his
speech there that economic frictions should not harm the strong
alliance that has developed between the United States and Australia.
   ``Our relationship with Australia is as strong as ever ... our
alliance remains an essential part of the Western global and
pacific regional collective security system,'' he said in the
question-and-answer session.
   Quayle also said he hopes to hopes to see Prince Norodom
Sihanouk, the leader of the Cambodian anti-communist resistance, in
Jakarta on his Pacific trip.

<TEXT>
   A black teen-ager whose tale of abduction and
sexual assault by a group of white men led to months of legal
commotion reportedly told a friend that she and her mother made up
the story.
   Tawana Brawley told the friend that she and her mother, Glenda,
invented the story to keep the mother's live-in boyfriend from
beating Ms. Brawley, New York Newsday reported today.
   Ms. Brawley denied the friend's report, the newspaper said.
   She was 15 when found Nov. 28, 1987, in a plastic bag, smeared
with dog excrement and racial epithets. She said she had been
abducted and raped over four days by five or six white men, at
least one with a badge.
   Hospital tests did not show signs of rape, and witnesses later
said they saw her at a party during the four-day period.
   Activist lawyers C. Vernon Mason and Alton Maddox and the Rev.
Al Sharpton advised Miss Brawley and her family not to cooperate
with a grand jury or investigators, claiming white officials were
engaged in a racist cover-up.
   The grand jury concluded last fall after a seven-month
investigation that the charges were untrue and that her condition
when found was not inconsistent with ``having been self-inflicted.''
   Attorney General Robert Abrams, the special prosecutor in the
case, told Newsday that Daryl T. Rodriguez's tale was consistent
with the grand jury's findings.
   Rodriguez, who began dating Ms. Brawley in the fall of 1987,
told the newspaper that within the last two weeks Ms. Brawley told
him what happened during the time she was supposedly missing.
   According to Rodriguez, the invented story went awry when Mrs.
Brawley picked up her daughter at a condominium complex in
Wappingers Falls, north of New York City, and saw two neighbors
helping her out of the trash bag. The mother then reported to
police that her daughter had been missing for four days, Rodriguez
said.
   Ms. Brawley, who now lives in Virginia Beach, Va., denied the
report and told Newsday she has not talked to Rodriguez since last
summer.
   Maddox and Sharpton did not immediately respond to messages left
today asking them for comment. Mason was out of the country.

<HEAD>Report Cites Lack of Security At A Moscow Airport</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Security is so lax at one of Moscow's major
airports that people have walked onto the runways and asked pilots
to fly them to distant points for cash, a newspaper reported today.
   The Moscow regional newspaper, Leninskoe Znamya, said people
pass easily through checkpoints at Demodedovo airport, one of the
capital's three major passenger terminals, without passports or
tickets. In one case, a car drove onto the runway to unload
luggage, the newspaper said.
   People treat Aeroflot passenger aircraft like city taxis at the
airport, the paper said. The airport primarily services domestic
routes, but foreign dignitaries often land there, and President
Reagan's plane arrived there when he came to Moscow for last year's
summit meeting.
   In one case, ``a man walked between parked airplanes, then
stopped and asked a pilot to take him to Baku,'' 1,000 miles away,
the newspaper said. It said he offered to pay cash, but he had no
documents or tickets.
   ``At the same airport, a car drove right to the plane scheduled
to leave for Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky (on the Soviet Pacific coast)
started to unload heavy parcels, saying to an air hostess that the
captain was aware of the load, which was a lie,'' the Leninskoe
Znamya said.
   The newspaper said the crunch of passengers at peak periods,
particularly in the summer, made it impossible to check documents
and passports properly.
   ``A person with someone else's passport can board a plane,'' the
newspaper said. It said baggage at many airports also was not
checked carefully.
   In the past year, there were 1,966 attempts to smuggle weapons,
mostly knives, aboard Soviet airliners, the newspaper said.
   At Moscow's Domodedovo airport, sophisticated baggage-checking
equipment was bought but still is not in use, the newspaper said.
``For a year, the equipment has been kept in storage and planes are
flying with crews that do not know who or what they are carrying,''
Leninskoe Znamya said.
   There have been three attempted hijackings this year. The latest
on March 31, was an attempt to commandeer an airliner to Pakistan
foiled by the KGB.
   Two attempts were reported in January, both stopped by police.
   In December 1988, four people commandeered a school bus, then
demanded to be flown to Israel aboard an Ilyushin 76-T transport
jet. They were arrested in Tel Aviv and returned to the Soviet
Union.

   Three African National
Congress guerrillas who refused to take part in their murder trial
because they claimed to be prisoners of war were sentenced to death
today for four killings.
   The three wore olive-green military uniforms with ANC colors
throughout the proceedings.
   Their only active role in the trial came Tuesday, when one read
a statement that said: ``We are soldiers in a patriotic army
struggling to establish democracy and peace. We believe that we are
prisoners of war.''
   In an unusual procedure, the men's families were allowed to
present evidence during the sentencing phase of the trial when the
defendants refused to do so. The death penalty is mandatory for a
murder conviction unless evidence shows there were mitigating
circumstances.
   Supreme Court Justice Marius de Klerk found there were none. He
sentenced Jabu Masina, 36, Ting-Ting Masango, 28, and Neo Potsane,
27, for killing two black policemen, a black town council member,
and the council member's sister-in law.
   The defendents also each received a 25-year prison sentence for
attempted murder in connection with a 1986 bombing at a bus stop,
in which 17 people were injured, and for setting a mine on a road
mainly used by military vehicles.
   A fourth defendant, Joseph Makhura, 26, was sentenced to 25
years in prison in connection with the bomb and land mine.
   The four had been convicted March 2.
   The trial took place in the farming town of Delmas, northeast of
Johannesburg. No execution date was set.
   Masina read the defendants' statement Tuesday before a packed
gallery of more than 200 people chanting, ``Viva ANC!''
   ``We say that the present South African government has no
authority, no moral or legal right to rule over the people of this
country,'' he said. ``It is therefore our duty to bring this crime
to an end, to remove this illegal state.''
   ``If we are hanged, our death will not be in vain,'' the
statement said. ``Those who come after us will undoubtedly complete
our mission in life.''
   The statement said the ANC had not taken up arms until after it
was outlawed in 1960, and ``it is contrary to the policy of the ANC
to select targets whose sole objective is to strike at civilians.''
   Without referring to the bus stop bomb, Masina said: ``There may
be situations where individual combatants go beyond policy and
commit acts which cannot be condoned.''
   Under apartheid, South Africa's 28 million blacks have no vote
in national affairs and must maintain separate housing districts
from the 5 million whites, who control the economy. The ANC is
fighting to overthrow the government and permit everyone to vote.

   British rockers Nick Lowe and Elvis
Costello lead the chorus at a 21st anniversary gathering for
Village Music, a tiny second-hand record shop frequented by music
stars.
   The store, 10 miles from San Francisco, is jammed with owner
John Goddard's collection of vintage rock and soul posters.
   The parade of music legends that performed Monday included Jerry
Garcia and Bob Weir of the Grateful Dead, Sammy Hagar of Van Halen,
Kim Wilson of the Fabulous Thunderbirds, Pete Sears of the Starship
and Commander Cody.
   With an audience that was half musicians, Costello confessed
that it was ``more nerve-wracking than getting up before 7,000
people.''
   Goddard enjoyed most of the marathon show from a front-row seat.
When asked how he signed up Costello, a popular British songwriter
and a regular store customer, Goddard had a simple answer.
   ``I asked him,'' he said.

<HEAD>Strong Gain in Personal Income; Sluggish Advance in Spending</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NANCY BENAC</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans' personal income increased a strong
0.8 percent in March while consumer spending edged up 0.2 percent,
a combination that boosted the personal savings rate to the highest
level in nearly four years, the government reported today.
   As income advances continue to outpace spending increases, the
personal savings rate has been inching upward and in March reached
6.3 percent, the Commerce Department reported.
   That was highest level since the rate _ savings as a percentage
of after-tax income _ hit 6.4 percent in May 1985.
   The March increase in income, to a seasonally adjusted annual
rate of $4.35 trillion, was due partly to special factors such as
profit-sharing payments to auto workers, a big increase in
retroactive Social Security benefits and higher farm subsidy
payments.
   Excluding those special factors, income rose 0.6 percent last
month.
   The sluggish consumer spending, at a seasonally adjusted annual
rate of $3.39 trillion last month, was consistent with a series of
recent government reports suggesting economic growth is slowing
down.
   The 0.2 percent advance in personal consumption expenditures in
March was the weakest performance since spending held steady last
September.
   The weakness was concentrated in spending on durable goods _
``big ticket'' items expected to last at least three years.
Spending on durables declined 1.5 percent last month, in part
reflecting weak car sales.
   Purchases of non-durable goods, meanwhile, rose 0.4 percent, and
spending on services advanced 0.5 percent.
   Today's report came a day after the Commerce Department reported
that consumer spending for the first quarter overall rose at an
annual rate of 1.3 percent after adjusting for inflation, down from
3.5 percent in the last quarter of 1988 and the slwest pace in more
than a year. The weakness was concentrated in spending on cars and
home heating.
   J. Antonio Villamil, the department's chief economist, said
Wednesday that ``a slowdown in the consumer sector this year has
been expected.'' He said the economic pattern of the first quarter
_ slower consumer spending accompanied by increased exports and
business investment _ was ``a desirable one for the sustainability
of the economic expansion.''
   The Bush administration is projected a 2 percent increase in
real personal consumption expenditures this year, down from 3.7
percent in 1988.
   The Federal Reserve Board for a year has been pushing up
interest rates in an effort to relieve inflationary pressures in
the economy by slowing demand. Consumer spending accounts for
two-thirds of all economic activity.
   Disposable, or after-tax, income increased 0.8 percent last
month after rising 1.1 percent in February. Wages and salaries, a
key component of personal income, rose 0.8 percent in March to
$2.59 trillion on an annual basis.

   An outpouring of sympathy from presidents to
childhood neighbors followed the death of Lucille Ball, but many
said the queen mother of comedy will live on through television
reruns and her influence on comedy.
   The daffy, redheaded comedian whose harebrained schemes drove
her television family crazy and delighted viewers for four decades
died Wednesday of a ruptured abdominal artery at Cedars-Sinai
Medical Center. She was 77 and died eight days after emergency
heart surgery.
   A private burial was planned, reportedly with no funeral
services in accordance with Miss Ball's wishes.
   ``God has her now, and, thanks to television, we'll have her
forever,'' said comedian and longtime friend Bob Hope.
   Hospital switchboards were swamped with condolence calls and
thousands of cards after Miss Ball's death, spokesman Ron Wise
said. Miss Ball's family requested that any flowers sent to the
Medical Center in her memory be distributed to other patients.
   Miss Ball maintained her sense of humor even when she was
critically ill. Following her operation last week, her first words
to her daughter, Lucie, were: ``Wouldn't you know _ this is the day
I was going to get my hair done.''
   Miss Ball had been improving steadily from the heart surgery, so
her death came as a shock.
   ``She had been walking, her spirits were up. Her family was with
her,'' Wise said. ``She responded as well as anyone could respond
to that kind of surgery.''
   He said she woke up early Wednesday complaining about a sudden
pain in her back, and in a matter of seconds went into a full
cardiac arrest that was caused by a ruptured aorta.
   Miss Ball and her late former husband, Desi Arnaz, starred in
``I Love Lucy'' from 1951 to 1957. In the ground-breaking show,
still seen in syndication worldwide, the late Vivian Vance and
William Frawley played their neighbors, Fred and Ethel Mertz.
   ``Probably a lot of what she did rubbed off on what I do,'' said
actress-comedian Jane Curtin, star of the sitcom ``Kate and
Allie.'' ``But it couldn't be helped, because I memorized her
shows.''
   The show, one of the most popular in television history, was
distinguished by Miss Ball's faultless timing, rubber-faced
expressions, wide-mouthed wails and extravagant pratfalls.
   ``Working with Lucy was like receiving an M.A. or a Ph.D. in
comedy,'' recalled Joan Rivers. ``What she forgot about comic
timing and delivery is more than most of us will ever learn in a
lifetime.''
   Comedian Whoopi Goldberg said: ``Lucy was great because she
represented every person. She showed us human foibles and gave us a
chance to laugh at ourselves.''
   Miss Goldberg said her favorite episode involved a visit by the
``I Love Lucy'' characters to Hollywood, where Lucy and Ethel
spotted actor William Holden in a restaurant.
   ``That was how we would all react to seeing a movie star in a
restaurant,'' Miss Goldberg said. ``She was looking at him in a
compact mirror, and trying to look at him surreptitiously. And
that's just an example of how everyone can identify with Lucy.''
   Bob Rosati, who lives down the street from the Beverly Hills
home Miss Ball shared with husband Gary Morton, said he was
watching a rerun of ``I Love Lucy'' on Wednesday morning when the
screen went black and the words ``In Memory of Lucille Ball,
1911-1989'' appeared.
   ``I felt I had lost someone in my family. I couldn't believe
it,'' said Rosati, 40. ``I was watching Lucy like I do every
morning. She's one of the most-admired ladies in this town.''
   He was among a group of fans who stood reverently outside Miss
Ball's home on Roxbury Drive as florists delivered baskets of
flowers to the house. Tour vans passed by in a non-stop procession.
   On Hollywood Boulevard's Walk of Fame, flower arrangements were
placed on Miss Ball's two stars _ one for her film work, one for
television.
   Budd Friedman, owner of the Improvisation comedy clubs, said,
``The world of comedy has lost its first lady. Her death is an
irreparable loss ... to our industry.''
   Actor Danny DeVito recalled getting a personal congratulation
from Miss Ball in 1981 when he won an Emmy for the TV series
``Taxi.''
   ``It made it like it had been blessed,'' he recalled.
   Admirers included President Bush, in Southern California at the
time of Miss Ball's passing, and former President Reagan.
   ``Her red hair, her antics on the screen, her timing and her
zest for life made her an American institution,'' the former
president and Nancy Reagan said in a statement. ``Just the mention
of her name brings a smile. ... We love Lucy and will miss her
deeply.''
   ``Lucille Ball possessed the gift of laughter,'' Bush said.
``But she also embodied an even greater treasure _ the gift of
love. She appealed to the gentler impulses of the human spirit. She
was not merely an actress or comedienne. She was Lucy and she was
loved.''
   ``To baby boomers, a happy chunk of our childhood is missing,''
said ``Saturday Night Live'' comedian Victoria Jackson, who was
born two years after ``I Love Lucy'' went off the air as a regular
series. ``She didn't make me laugh out loud, I remember, she just
made me happy about life.''
   Said comic Tim Conway: ``We're going to miss this lady, but not
really, because she's still here. All those wonderful things they
did together ... those wonderful TV shows ... are still available.''
   Although Miss Ball hadn't visited her hometown of Jamestown,
N.Y, since 1956 and had no family there, she had stayed in touch
with friends.
   Irene Rosseti, who now lives in Celoron, N.Y., said Miss Ball
recently had sent her and her husband a letter on their 50th
wedding anniversary.
   ``Even though she was a big star, she was still just Lucy to
us,'' she recalled.

   New cases of baby food tampering were reported
today across England as well as in Ireland and Northern Ireland,
and three babies were treated by doctors after eating food tainted
by extortionists, officials said.
   Newspaper reports said food companies had paid $850,000 to
extortionists and that the culprits were demanding another $1.7
million.
   The Daily Telegraph said police believe a gang that extorted
$85,000 from a large supermarket chain this year was reponsible.
   Scotland Yard, which is coordinating a nationwide inquiry,
refused comment on the reports.
   According to police, parents today reported finding glass, pins,
needles and caustic baby soda in jars and cans of baby food and in
one case, powdered milk. They did not say how many new cases were
reported, but as of Wednesday there had been at least 28 cases in
England alone.
   Three babies were taken to hospitals in Leicester, Exeter and
Leeds and later released. One mother found food glass fragments in
her baby's food and another discovered two pieces of metal. The
third baby became ill when eating a banana dessert, police said.
   New cases turned up in the province of Northern Ireland as well
as across the border in the Republic of Ireland, police said.
   H.J. Heinz Co. Ltd. and Cow and Gate Ltd., two of Britain's
leading food manufacturers, on Wednesday offered a total of
$169,000 for information leading to the conviction of the
extortionists.
   Heinz, whose parent company is the Pittsburgh-based food giant,
and Cow and Gate said they had received extortion demands. They
refused to elaborate.
   The Daily Telegraph said police suspected a gang of
extortionists who reportedly got $85,000 from a supermarket chain
this year after threatening to poison food on its market shelves.
The gang threatened to spike baby food unless it was paid $1.7
million, the newspaper said. It did not name the victimized
supermarket chain.
   The London tabloid Today said without attribution that some
manufacturers had already paid $845,000 to the extortionists. It
did not name the companies.
   Today said the extortionists initially hid the money in various
accounts with the Halifax Building Society, one of Britain's
leading savings and loans groups, then used cash cards to draw it
bit by bit from Halifax cash dispenser machines.
   The paper did not say, but the implication appeared to be that
the gang used false identities to open the accounts.
   It said more than 4,000 police staked out 768 Halifax cash
dispenser machines around the country in a bid to trap the
extortionists but that they failed.
   The government said 28 incidents of tampering with jars and cans
of baby food have been reported since April 7, including 11 on
Wednesday.
   In addition to today's victims, a 9-month-old girl in Oxford cut
her mouth on a piece of razor blade in a yogurt container and two
mothers were cut by glass shards in jars of infant food. None
required hospital treatment.
   In one incident, sodium hydroxide, or caustic soda, was used to
contaminate a jar of baby food. The white substance is a strong
caustic base used in chemistry and oil refining.
   Heinz and Cow and Gate said internal investigations have
determined their baby food products were not tampered with during
production.
   Ted Smyth, director of corporate affairs for Heinz in
Pittsburgh, said Wednesday the parent company ``shares the
universal outrage'' over the tampering.
   He said, ``We have no reason at all to be concerned about
tampering of products in the United States.''

<HEAD>Peach Bottom Plant Restarts After Shutdown</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DELTA, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Peach Bottom nuclear plant restarted today
after a costly, two-year shutdown ordered by regulators after they
found operators sleeping on the job.
   The federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission granted final approval
for a restart of Unit 2 Wednesday night and the chain reaction
began about 5:40 a.m., said Bill Jones, a spokesman for plant
operator and part-owner Philadelphia Electric Co.
   Peach Bottom will operate at very low power for the next two
weeks while safety checks are made. If all goes well, the plant
should reach full power in 14 weeks, he said.
   The plant has been closed since March 1987 when the NRC said
sleeping and inattention by 33 control room workers posed a safety
threat to the public.
   Philadelphia Electric shook up its top management and had to pay
some $250 million for plant modifications, replacement power and
its share of a $125 million fine, the biggest in NRC history.
   The fine also was shared by the plant's other three owners:
Public Service Gas and Electric of Newark, N.J.; Atlantic Electric
Co. of Atlantic City, N.J.; and Delmarva Power and Light Co. of
Wilmington, Del.

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Army commander Michel Aoun said today his
troops would cooperate with a cease-fire observer force that Arab
countries plan to deploy in Lebanon.
   In Tunisia, foreign ministers of the 22-member Arab League today
called for a cease-fire to begin Friday at noon. They did not say
how many observer troops would be deployed or when but said the
plan should be carried out immediately.
   A special committee made up of six ministers has recommended
stationing 312 officers from Arab armies in Lebanon.
   The observer force would be deployed along Beirut's dividing
Green Line and other flashpoints in the hills above the Lebanese
capital, according to a text of the committee's plan published
today in Beirut newspapers.
   Its main task would be monitoring the cease-fire, and officers
would have no right to use arms except in self-defense, according
to the text.
   The force's mandate is set for three months but could be
extended. The newspapers did not say which countries would
contribute to the force.
   ``We will cooperate positively with the Arab force on the
military level,'' Aoun said in a statement broadcast by
Christian-controlled radio stations in Beirut.
   Acting Prime Minister Salim Hoss, who heads a Moslem Cabinet
that rivals Aoun's Christian military government, has welcomed
setting up an Arab observer force. But his justice minister, Nabih
Berri, who heads the pro-Syrian Shiite Moslem Amal militia, has
rejected the plan.
   At least 272 people have been killed and 991 wounded in six
weeks of battles between Aoun's mainly Christian troops and an
alliance of the Syrian army and Druse warlord Walid Jumblatt's
Progressive Socialist Party militia.
   Police said Syrian and Druse gunners sporadically shelled the
coast north of Beirut with rockets and mortars today, keeping
closed the only escape route for the 1 million Christians in their
enclave.
   No casualties were reported.
   Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon, maintains 40,000 troops
in northern, eastern and central areas as well as Beirut's Moslem
sector under a 1976 peacekeeping mandate from the Arab League.
   The newspapers said the Arab foreign ministers decided to
postpone the issue of political reforms in Lebanon and election of
a new president until after the observer force is in place.
   The presidency has been vacant since Sept. 22, when President
Amin Gemayel's six-year term ended with Parliament unable to elect
a successor.
   Before stepping down, Gemayel appointed Aoun, a Maronite
Catholic, head of an interim Cabinet to rule pending the election
of a new head of state.
   Moslem and leftist forces rejected Aoun's appointment and
pledged allegiance to the Hoss Cabinet, which governed under
Gemayel.
   Moslems also are seeking political reforms that would give them
an equal share of power with the traditionally dominant Christians.
   The current fighting broke out March 8 after Aoun clamped a
blockade on illegal ports run by Moslem militias south of Beirut.
   Jumblatt retaliated by shelling the 310-square-mile Christian
enclave. The Syrians joined the bombardment and sealed off the
area's land exits.

   An illiterate, unemployed construction
worker has been convicted of the murders of four prostitutes, two
of which had been listed as Southside Slayer killings.
   Louis Craine, 31, also was found guilty Wednesday of several
counts of sexual assault in the strangulation murders between
August 1985 and May 1987, but was acquitted on a fifth count of
murder.
   The jury is scheduled to return May 8 to decide if Craine should
be sentenced to death or life in prison without the possibility of
parole.
   It was the Los Angeles man's second trial. His first ended in
mistrial in August.
   Craine is one of three men arrested in connection with the
slayings of 18 women whose deaths were so similar homicide
detectives believed they may have been the work of a serial killer.
Most of the victims were prostitutes who had been stabbed or
strangled and their bodies dumped in south-central Los Angeles or
adjacent communities.
   In March 1986, before any arrests were made, police announced
the formation of what they called a South Side Serial Murder Task
Force to investigate slayings that dated to 1983.
   Craine was charged with three of those killings and two
unrelated slayings. He confessed to three murders when he was
arrested in 1987, but later recanted on the witness stand.
   The defense portrayed Craine as an illiterate man of low
intelligence who confessed during an aggressive interrogation
simply to tell investigators what they wanted to hear.
   Daniel Lee Siebert was charged with two killings last year, and
Charles Mosley was convicted of one slaying.

<HEAD>Judge Says North Has Permit to Carry Concealed Weapon</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FAIRFAX, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oliver North possesses a permit to carry a
concealed weapon in Fairfax County, Va., because he feels
threatened by terrorists and what his attorney calls ``the nut
element,'' the chief judge of County Circuit Court said today.
   ``It's very unusual'' for anyone to be granted a permit to carry
a concealed weapon, said Chief Judge Lewis Griffith. But his
predecessor, Judge Barnard F. Jennings, granted North the original
one-year permit in October 1987 because he was convinced North
showed a legitimate need, Griffith said.
   Griffith, who became chief judge the following January, renewed
the license for two more years on Oct. 13, 1988, a month after
North re-applied.
   North, a former White House aide, is awaiting a jury's verdict
on charges stemming from the Iran-Contra affair. He was identified
last July as the target of a potential assassination plot involving
one of eight man charged with illegal pro-Libyan activities in the
United States.
   Just one other person received a concealed license permit in
1987, and of 77 applications filed in 1988, North was the sole
recipient, Griffith said.
   ``He is the only one that I have ever felt satisfied and
demonstrated a need to carry a concealed weapon,'' said Griffith.
The county's chief judge makes the final decision on concealed
weapon permits, based on need.
   Papers filed by North's attorney, Brendan Sullivan, focused on
two threats to the life of the former White House aide. ``According
to experts, dangers come from two basic sources _ the terrorist
element, which wants to fulfill its promise to even the score, and
the nut element, which surfaces in situations like this,'' the
papers said.
   Fairfax County law allows residents to carry weapons in view,
but those who wish to carry a concealed weapon must go through a
complicated approval process, said Griffith.
   The permit is only in effect when North is in Fairfax County,
where he lives.
   ``It's only good in the jurisdiction it's issued in,'' said a
District of Columbia police spokesman. ``You get a gun permit in
Virginia, it's only good in Virginia.''

   A mentally disabled, AIDS-stricken 7-year-old
stepped into a classroom for the first time in her life today, with
bows in her hair, a knapsack on her back and the cheers of
supporters surrounding her.
   Rosa Martinez, who fought a 2{-year court battle against school
officials who feared a health risk, called today the most important
day in her daughter Eliana's life.
   A federal district judge Wednesday cleared the way for Eliana to
attend class without being confined to a glass isolation booth, as
required in an earlier ruling.
   Supporters cheered as Mrs. Martinez and Eliana walked into the
one-story, red-brick Manhattan Exceptional Center, where 201
students are enrolled. There were no protests.
   ``She'll finally, for the first time in her life, be able to be
with children and spend all the time she can with them,'' Ms.
Martinez said as they went inside.
   Eliana wore a pink dress and pink bows in her hair and carried a
toy that plays the Disney song ``It's a Small World.''
   Ms. Martinez told reporters later that when Eliana entered the
classroom, ``the children came around her and one of them hugged
her.''
   ``They just surrounded her,'' she said. ``They didn't need any
introductions.''
   Principal Sandra Williams said she sent notes to parents
Wednesday to prepare them for Eliana's arrival and received seven
calls of concern, with one mother saying she was not ready to
accept the risk.
   Attorney Steve Hanlon, who pressed a suit through a federal
appeals court to keep the little girl from being put in a
glass-walled booth in the class for mentally disabled, physically
impaired children, drove mother and daughter to school. Eliana
became the 12th student in the class.
   ``It's a wonderful day for her,'' he said. ``She'll do
wonderfully here. She's going to take off like a rocket.''
   But he said he expected her first day to be difficult because
``she doesn't have any exprience with other kids.''
   Linda Castellano, a family friend and head of an AIDS support
group called ``Linda and Frenz,'' was among seven supporters on
hand to watch Eliana enter public school for the first time.
   ``I know she'll benefit from playing with other kids,'' she
said. ``She's always around adults and always having to look up.
Now she'll have eye contact with children.''
   The child, who had been taught at home since June 1987, was once
told she could attend class on the condition she remained inside a
glass booth. However, the issue of a partition became moot when
U.S. District Judge Elizabeth A. Kovachevich decided Eliana posed
no significant threat to her classmates.
   Hanlon predicted Wednesday that the ruling will have
far-reaching effects.
   ``I'm just a trial lawyer,'' Hanlon said, ``but people who
really do a lot of this work tell me this is a landmark case _ that
it will have a major impact around the country.''
   In an earlier ruling, Kovachevich tried to allay the school
system's fears by ordering the isolation booth for the incontinent
child until the girl became toilet trained and learned to stop
sucking her fingers.
   But Mrs. Martinez said she would not send her daughter to school
to sit in a ``glass cage'' and appealed.
   ``I'm so happy. I don't have bitterness for anything,'' Mrs.
Martinez said after the ruling. ``My daughter is not a monkey. I've
always said that.
   ``All she understands is she will be going in to play with some
little people. She doesn't know what school is; she hasn't been to
it.''
   School board attorney Crosby Few said he was glad the judge had
ruled and would recommend that it be followed.
   In December, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals sent the
case back to Kovachevich, saying the child must be placed in a
regular classroom setting unless evidence proved Eliana posed a
significant risk to other children through bodily secretions.
   The judge said she learned through recent sworn statements that
Eliana is ``capable of being instructed not to suck or mouth her
fingers and that she is well on her way to being fully toilet
trained.''
   Hanlon and Mrs. Martinez, a nurse who adopted Eliana as an
infant in her native Puerto Rico, argued that in order to develop
fully Eliana needed to be with other children for interaction,
stimulation and socialization.
   Eliana was stricken with acquired immune deficiency syndrome
from tranfusions of tainted blood shortly after her premature birth.

<TEXT>
   Heavy rains caused a landslide that killed
at least 31 gold miners in northeastern Burundi and trapped up to
100 more, the Burundi News Agency reported today.
   Four people have been rescued from the caves in Butihinda since
the accident Sunday, and 31 are known dead, a local administrator
told the news agency. The report was monitored in Nairobi.
   The landslide occurred so quickly the miners had no chance to
escape, the provincial governor, Bayaga Deo, told Bujumbura Radio.
   ``There were no injuries, only deaths. It was so sudden that no
one was able to get away,'' he told the radio. ``It is not possible
to give an exact figure, but people who were present estimate that
there are between 50 and 100'' trapped.
   The trapped miners apparently had gone into the mines at night
to prospect for gold for themselves, according to a reporter at the
Burundi News Agency.
   Burundi's government regulates the little official mining done
in the central African nation. Burundi produces less than 44 pounds
of gold annually, according to a recent survey of the country's
mining industry prepared by a Western embassy.

   An Arab League delegation was meeting today
with Secretary of State James A. Baker III to discuss a cease-fire
plan for Lebanon and a U.S.-supported Israeli proposal for
elections on the West Bank and in Gaza.
   The delegation also planned to ask Baker to reopen the Palestine
Liberation Organization's office here. The Reagan administration
closed in on the ground the PLO is engaged in terrrorism, but the
administration later opened talks with the group.
   The Arab League delegation is headed by Clovis Maksoud, the
league's representative in the United States, and includes
Ambassadors Saud al-Sabah of Kuwait and Mohsin A. Alaini of North
Yemen.
   The league has proposed stationing 312 officers from Arab armies
in Lebanon to monitor a cease-fire under United Nations
supervision. The country is torn by warfare between Christian and
Moslem factions, with 40,000 Syrian
   Arab League foreign ministers approved the cease-fire proposal
at a meeting in Tunis, Tunisia, today. The Council of Ministers
from the 22 member countries, after nearly seven hours of
discussions, said the cease-fire should begin Friday at noon.
   Maksoud said that in the afternoon meeting, the delegation also
would discuss with Baker the proposal by Israeli Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir to hold elections among Palestinian Arabs on the
Israeli-occupied West Bank and in Gaza.
   The elected leaders would negotiate an interim system of local
self-rule to be followed by negotiations on an overall settlement
for the territories Jordan and Egypt surrendered in the 1967
Mideast war.
   The Arab League has rejected the plan, saying it is a device for
ratification of Shamir's ``annexation'' of the West Bank and Gaza,
where more than 1.4 million Palestinian Arabs live. But Baker has
called on all sides to consider the arrangement as a hopeful step
toward a permanent agreement.
   The league is planning tentatively to hold a summit meeting next
month and would send a delegation afterward to meet with Baker.

<HEAD>Energy Chief Discloses New Delay In Restart of Key Defense Reactors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Energy Secretary James D. Watkins told
Congress today he had pushed back the target date for resuming
production of a radioactive gas needed in nuclear warhead
production, but he said the delay would not harm national security.
   Watkins said in a letter to the chairmen of the House and Senate
Armed Services committees that he was not yet convinced the three
South Carolina nuclear reactors that produce the gas, called
tritium, could be operated safely.
   ``... I believe safe startup is achievable early enough in 1990
to maintain a viable weapons stockpile,'' he wrote.
   Watkins released copies of his letter after meeting in his
office with a group of reporters. He said he notified Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney of the delay on Monday.
   Watkins told reporters the main reason for putting off restart
of the reactors was a need to resolve safety issues and complete
retraining of reactor operators.
   ``There are so many issues that are unresolved in my mind, as
they relate to safety,'' he said. ``I will not allow them (the
reactors) to be started this year.''
   Up to now, the Energy Department had said it intended to restart
the first of the three reactors at Savannah River Site, near Aiken,
S.C., by the end of this year. It had said quick resumption of
operations was required to assure an adequate supply of tritium,
which is needed to boost the explosive power of nuclear warheads.
   The three reactors were shut down a year ago because of safety
concerns.
   The Pentagon said last fall that unless at least one of the
reactors was running again by late this year, the reliability of
the weapons stockpile would be jeopardized.
   The exact size of the tritium supply is classified.
   Watkins also disclosed that he planned to announce soon a ``new
approach'' to determining the feasibility of constructing the
nation's first permanent repository for high-level nuclear waste,
at Yucca Mountain, Nev.
   The state government and many environmental groups are strongly
opposed to the project, which has been plagued by delays and is not
scheduled for completion until 2003.
   ``We'll probably have to restructure that program in the very
near time frame and announce some kind of new approach,'' Watkins
said. He gave no details.

   President Bush said today there is increasing
evidence that foreign drug-traffickers are using American-made
chemicals to refine cocaine and ``we should demand that United
States corporations act responsibly'' to prevent such abuses.
   Bush said few Americans are aware that ``illegally diverted
barrels of dangerous chemicals _ clearly marked with U.S. corporate
logos _ are routinely seized'' in the jungles of Colombia.
   While U.S. businesses ``by and large'' have supported government
efforts to curb drug abuse, ``industry's got to do more,'' the
president said.
   ``And I hope that parents' groups and stockholders are listening
today,'' he said in the speech to the International Drug
Enforcement Conference here. ``We should demand that United States
corporations act responsibly, and that they not tolerate chemicals
ending up in criminal hands.''
   More than 100 striking Eastern Airlines employees and their
supporters demonstrated outside the hotel where Bush spoke. They
gave a thumbs-down salute as Bush's motorcade rode past. The
president, who has refused union appeals to intervene in the nearly
8-week-old strike, waved in return.
   In advance of Bush's speech, White House press secretary Marlin
Fitzwater said the administration hoped that corporations would
take ``voluntary action'' to determine the end use of chemicals
they sell and ship out of the country.
   But in his speech, Bush noted that a wide-ranging anti-drug
abuse bill passed by Congress last year authorizes the government
to take action against the diversion of chemicals for drug
production. He said ``regulations are now being drafted to tighten
controls on the chemicals needed to refine cocaine.''
   The president said the time had come to ``rid the world of these
toxins'' and said ``we're going to start right here in the United
States ... because, all too often, that's the original source of
the basic industrial chemicals needed to produce cocaine.''
   ``Traffickers have hit us where it hurts,'' he told the
gathering of drug enforcement officers from Latin American nations.
``Now, we're going to exploit their vulnerabilities, crimping the
flow of materials, without which they cannot roduce. No chemicals,
no cocaine.''
   Bush pointed to the seizure by a 30-nation task force last year
of 155,000 pounds of highly flammable ether, almost 450,000 pounds
of acetone and more than 50,000 pounds of hydrochloric acid.
   He said Colombian authorities in January destroyed 25 cocaine
laboratories and ``enough chemicals to make approximately 83 metric
tons of cocaine. The damage that's done when 83 tons of coke hits
U.S. streets is pretty obvious.''
   In a second speech today, at the dedication of a Coast Guard
drug-interdiction communications center in Miami, the president
said ``our purpose is simple and close to home: to keep drugs out
of the lockers, the classrooms and off the playgrounds of our
schools, to redeem the children of America from the scourge of
drugs.''
   ``From this site, civilian and defense radars will work
together, under the watchful eye of Coast Guard and Customs duty
officers, who will coordinate interception by federal, state and
local law enforcement agencies, whether it means scrambling a jet
fighter, a Coast Guard cutter or speedboats guided by the Blue
Lightning strike force,'' he said.
   Meanwhile, Fitzwater said Bush believes his trip, coming as he
neared the 100-day mark of his presidency, has gone ``very well.''
He said he expects Bush to travel around the country frequently to
discuss his agenda and programs.
   He said Bush feels it is important to ``report to the American
people, tell them what he is doing, discuss his program, talk about
various issues. Bush will often make speeches before the American
people, visit a lot of states.''
   Fitzwater said he expects that the administration will have a
drug-related crime package to propose to Congress within two weeks.
Attorney General Dick Thornburgh indicated to reporters Wednesday
that drug control director William Bennett still was studying
options to recommend to Bush.

   Chancellor Helmut Kohl, in a major
policy speech today, intensified pressure on the United States to
agree to superpower talks on short-range nuclear weapons.
   Addressing Parliament, Kohl repeated his call for negotiations
to reduce the number of short-range nuclear rockets in Europe as
well as atomic artillery.
   ``Because of the range of the short-range systems, the Federal
Republic of Germany is affected more by these weapons than the
other partners in the alliance,'' Kohl said.
   ``It is to me self-evident for our friends to have the same
understanding for our interests as we have shown many times for
theirs,'' he added.
   Britain and the United States have been critical of Kohl's
proposal for superpower talks on tactical atomic arms deployed in
Europe. But NATO allies Belgium, Norway and Denmark have indicated
their support for Kohl on the issue.
   Many lawmakers applauded when Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich
Genscher indirectly criticized the United States and Britain for
their stand.
   ``There is much to fear in this world. But we certainly don't
have to fear negotiations, and we don't have to fear talks with a
Soviet Union that is ready for negotiations,'' he told Parliament.
   Recent polls indicate that three-quarters of the West German
population favors eliminating all nuclear weapons in Europe. Most
of NATO's short-range weapons are based in West Germany.
   Kohl reassured the United States and other NATO partners that
his government does not want to eliminate those battlefield nuclear
weapons.
   ``In the current circumstances, land, sea and airborne
short-range nuclear weapons are still important in Europe,'' he
said.
   The chancellor also said the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
cannot afford to make unilateral disarmament moves ``as long as the
Warsaw Pact has a superior military potential and
security-political risks continue to exist.''
   Kohl has called on NATO to delay a decision on replacing the
aging short-range Lance nuclear missiles that are on West German
soil until after national elections scheduled for late next year.
   Hans-Jochen Vogel, head of the opposition Social Democratic
Party, called Kohl's proposal for talks on short-range atomic
arsenals ``half-hearted'' and repeated his demand that all those
weapons be eliminated from West Germany.
   Kohl's call for negotiations on short-range nuclear weapons
appears to be part of a wide-ranging attempt to win public support.
   In recent weeks he has taken a number of actions to try to
bolster his sagging popularity and to defuse criticism that has
threatened his conservative coalition government.
   Kohl has reshuffled his Cabinet and has reversed himself on
several widely unpopular issues, abandoning for example a plan to
extend compulsary military service terms from 15 to 18 months.
   While trying to improve his image among West Germans eager for
arms control and domestic reform, Kohl has incurred the wrath of
the United States and Britain for his proposal on short-range
nuclear weapons.
   The United States has launched a diplomatic offensive against
Kohl's proposal, instructing its ambassadors in NATO countries to
present arguments against starting up negotiations on short-range
weapons.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain also has criticized
Kohl's move and is expected to discuss the matter with him during
talks in West Germany on Sunday.
   Britain and the United States fear that starting up negotiations
on the tactical arsenals could lead to their elimination and
increase the threat from superior Warsaw Pact conventional forces.
   But Kohl, Genscher and other West German leaders say the climate
is ripe for stepping up disarmament efforts with the Soviets.

   Small quantities of illegal drugs were
found in the home of Abbie Hoffman, the Yippie movement co-founder
who committed suicide earlier this month, authorities said today.
   The drugs were found in a box in Hoffman's refrigerator, Bucks
County District Attorney Alan M. Rubenstein said.
   The box contained 9.38 grams of marijuana, 0.31 grams of
hashish, a cocaine residue and trace amounts of LSD, amphetamines
and psilocybin, Rubenstein said. Toxicology tests completed last
week confirmed the drugs and the amounts, he said.
   Hoffman, 52, was found dead April 12 in his home near New Hope.
Coroner Thomas J. Rosko ruled April 18 Hoffman died of a ``massive
overdose'' of the sedative phenobarbital and large quantities of
alcohol.
   Rubenstein said the quantities of the illegal drugs found in
Hoffman's refrigerator indicated they were for his personal use.
   ``None of these items were found in his bloodstream,''
Rubenstein said.

<HEAD>U.S. Official To Keep Airline Security Alerts From Congress</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner said
today he will no longer tell Congress about airline security alerts
for fear of leaks and is considering a bill to make unauthorized
disclosure a crime.
   Skinner also said that passengers on U.S. airlines may be barred
from taking electronic devices such as portable computers on
aircraft following the Pan Am Flight 103 air disaster over Scotland.
   Speaking to American reporters in London on the last leg of a
five-nation European tour, Skinner said he was adamant about not
discussing publicly intelligence-gathering or unannounced airline
security bulletins.
   ``I have just sent a letter to the U.S. Congress advising them
that I will no longer disseminate information to them regarding
security bulletins until I am absolutely sure that they have a
mechanism in place to protect that information,'' he said.
   He said he plans new regulations about leaking airline
``security-type information,'' adding: ``I may seek legislation
making it a crime.''
   Last month, Skinner criticized a London newspaper, The Daily
Express, which reported a security bulletin sent by the U.S.
Federal Aviation Administration to airports and carriers March 16
about a possible hijacking of an American airliner in Europe.
   Skinner said public disclosure of all warnings would mean they
would be taken for granted.
   After the Pan Am disaster, British Transport Secretary Paul
Channon was accused by critics in Britain of bungling the
dissemination to airlines of warnings from West Germany that
Palestinian terrorists had devised a new radio cassette bomb.
   Flight 103, bound for New York from Frankfurt via London, was
blown apart by a tiny bomb hidden in a radio cassette recorder. It
crashed on the Scottish village of Lockerbie, killing 270 people.
   Skinner, who met Channon later today, also said he expects the
latest U.S. bomb-detection equipment, thermal neutron analysis, to
be installed at several European airports by year's end. The
machines can find plastic explosives missed by X-rays.
   In a $60-million program, the United States accelerated
development of thermal neutron analysis after the Flight 103
disaster Dec. 21. The first device is due to be installed at John
F. Kennedy Airport, New York, in July.
   ``Every place I have gone, everyone wants to do more,'' said
Skinner, who arrived in England after meeting government officials
in Italy, West Germany, France and Switzerland.
   On electronic devices, Skinner said that unless a sure means of
examination is found ``the ban of such devices is an option that
will be looked at.''

   Vietnam today returned 21 sets of
remains that tentatively have been identified as Americans killed
in the Vietnam War, the Vietnam News Agency said.
   A brief dispatch from the official agency, monitored in Bangkok,
said the remains were turned over to a representative of the
Hawaii-based U.S. Joint Casualty Resolution Center, the military
unit set up to resolved the issue of more than 2,300 Americans
missing in action, or MIA, from the Indochina war.
   According to U.S. spokesmen, the military unit was to have
picked up the remains in a ceremony at Hanoi airport and then fly
them to army laboratories in Honolulu for analysis and
identification.
   The Vietnamese report did not provide details but said the
Americans ``appreciated the humanitarian policy, good will and
cooperation'' of Vietnam.
   A total of 1,730 Americans are still listed as missing in action
in Vietnam while 634 are missing in Cambodia, Laos and China.
   The Indochina war ended in 1975 with communist victories over
U.S.-backed governments in Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos.
   A 20-member U.S. military flew to Hanoi from Bangkok earlier
today aboard a U.S. Air Force C-131 transport to pick up the
remains. The team, headed by Lt. Col. Bill Jordan, was to arrive in
Honolulu Friday after stopping in Guam.
   Including today's repatriation, Vietnam has returned 184 remains
since mid-1987 when it agreed to accelerate cooperation on the
issue in exchange for Washington's help in encouraging private
humanitarian aid to Vietnam.
   The U.S. military says that of those remains returned since
mid-1987, 45 have been positively identified as those of U.S.
servicemen killed in action.
   A team of 10 U.S. military specialists has been in Vietnam since
April 12, cooperating with Vietnamese counterparts in the fifth
joint field investigation on MIAs. They are interviewing villagers
who witnessed plane crashes and seeking other evidence of the
missing men. The investigators are to work until April 30 in the
longest such project thus far.

<TEXT>
   A tornado killed at least 500
people, injured thousands and devastated more than 20 villages in
central Bangladesh, the government said today.
   The tornado Wednesday night blew away people, houses and animals
as it whirled at 100 mph through the Manikganj area, 25 miles
northwest of Dhaka.
   Survivors said the funnel cloud raged for 10 minutes and
flattened ``everything, including buildings.''
   ``I saw black clouds gathering in the sky. In moments we found
we were flying along with the house,'' said Sayeda Begum, a
30-year-old homemaker in Saturia village near Manikganj.
   Another tornado hit the Narsingdi district, 25 miles east of the
capital, killing five people and injuring 500, the English-language
newspaper New Nation said.
   The tornadoes brought with them rain and hail and followed a
two-month drought that has threatened to destroy more than half the
rice crop in this impoverished nation. The tornadoes hit hours
after President Hussain Muhammad Ershad ordered nationwide prayers
for rain.
   In Dhaka alone, more than 75,000 people joined Ershad in a
prayer service.
   A senior government official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said 5,000 people were injured in Manikganj. He said 500
bodies had been recovered.
   Troops searched through rubble today for more victims.
   In Saturia, nothing was standing as far as the eye could see.
The village of 10,000 resembled a bombed area, with houses uprooted
and electric poles twisted.
   Mrs. Begum said she, her husband and four of their children were
lifted through the air and all were injured. A fifth child, a
5-year-old boy, was found about two miles away and received severe
bruises, she said.
   At Nandeshwari, a neighboring village of at least 120 houses,
there were no standing structures or people in sight.
   Tofael Ahmed, a teacher, wept bitterly, holding a torn shirt
that had been worn by his son. Both his son and daughter were
missing.
   ``What shall I do with this shirt. Why should Allah curse me
like this,'' he cried. He said he had brought the shirt for his son
to wear during the Moslems' religious festival of Eid next week.
   Authorities said more than 500 people were admitted to hospitals
and many were in critical condition.

   Lottery officials couldn't confirm today
that anyone won the record $100 million-plus Pennsylvania Super 7
lottery, but a group of Ohio factory employees told friends and
relatives they had the winning numbers.
   Officials have said two computer systems may need until Friday
to complete a scan of all 87.3 million Super 7 plays this week and
perform other security checks before any winning ticket in
Wednesday's drawing can be validated.
   George Andersen, lottery deputy executive director, said this
morning he could not confirm that any potential winners had called
lottery headquarters.
   ``We get a lot of calls, but there's been no claimants so far,''
Andersen told reporters outside lottery headquarters in Middletown.
``We always receive crank and legitimate calls, all kinds of calls,
even until the wee hours.''
   At Windham, Ohio, Janet Miller, office manager of the
Harbison-Walker brick factory, said a foreman and 13 press
mechanics set out for Harrisburg claiming to have a winning ticket
as she pulled up to the plant this morning.
   ``We're all excited about it,'' said Rudy Palya, closing manager
for a grocery in Windham. ``The customers all know, and they're
talking about it in town and when they're coming through for
groceries.''
   A receptionist at the factory said the workers each spent about
$10 on tickets for the drawing.
   Anderson said lottery officials would have an announcement later
today but he refused to say what details would be disclosed.
   The huge ticket sales mean the jackpot will be something higher
than $100 million, lottery officials said. Andersen said the size
of the final jackpot won't be known until the lottery receives bids
from a pool of seven insurance companies for an annuity to cover
the prize, payable in annual installments over 26 years.
   The numbers, picked live on television, were 06; 16; 24; 34; 35;
37; 40; 41; 45; 60; 71. To win the grand prize, a ticket must
contain seven of the 11 numbers. Six numbers carry a prize in the
thousands. Having four numbers means a $7 prize.
   The drawing went off without a hitch at a television studio,
while crews from at least six TV stations stood by to broadcast the
drawing to affiliates across the country.
   Millions of dreams died and hours of standing in line for a
ticket went for naught when the numbers were drawn _ some even
before then.
   At the Shop 'n' Save in Butler County, northwest of Pittsburgh,
manager Debbie Baron said two customers were still in line when the
lottery computers were automatically turned off at 6:56 p.m.
   At the Penn-Ohio Drug Store in Sharon, more than 75 people were
in line when sales ended.
   ``There was one guy who was mad because his friend got in before
he did, and he said, `He's not getting a ride home,' and he started
to leave,'' said night supervisor Debbie Trinckes of Hubbard, Ohio.
``But I told him the machine got cut off before his friend got to
play, and he seemed happy.''
   At a minimum $100 million, the top prize would eclipse the
previous U.S. record jackpot, $69.9 million, for which four winning
tickets were held April 15 in Illinois. The world's largest lottery
jackpot, $159 million, was split by hundreds of people in December
in Spain.
   Officials said the Super 7 prize would probably top the world
record if no winning tickets were sold this week. The jackpot would
then be rolled over.
   But Karl Ross, a deputy revenue secretary, said the odds against
the jackpot carrying over for the seventh-straight week were about
4,000 to one.
   Those who played the lottery used a variety of methods for
choosing numbers. Nearly three-quarters of all tickets used numbers
picked at random by the computer.
   Jazz saxophonist Grover Washington Jr., on the other hand, based
his choices on the serial number of his latest album, ``Then and
Now.''
   Philadelphia Eagles football coach Buddy Ryan included numbers
of some of his players, including quarterback Randall Cunningham
(12) and fullback Anthony Toney (25).
   In Erie, two lottery pilgrims who drove more than 200 miles from
Ohio were robbed of about $850 early Wednesday as they waited for a
convenience store to open, authorities said.
   As the Toledo, Ohio, men waited about 5:30 a.m. in an
automobile, a man asked what they were doing.
   ``He pulled a gun and took all their money,'' police Capt.
Dennis Tobin said. ``They had driven all night. They never did get
their tickets.''

   Rebels abducted 15 people, killed a
woman, looted shops and stole communications equipment belonging to
the United Nations in northern Uganda, sources said Thursday.
   More than 200 rebels armed with guns, spears, machetes, arrows
and sticks waged the attack before dawn Monday in Moyo district,
about 280 miles northwest of Kampala, said Moses Ali, a Moyo
parliamentarian.
   A reporter for a weekly Kampala newspaper said the rebels,
believed to be members of the Holy Spirit Movement, abducted three
women and 12 government laborers who had been drilling water wells
for about 40,000 Sudanese refugees camped in the area near Uganda's
border with Sudan.
   Ali, who also serves as minister for youth, culture and sports,
said the rebels also looted shops and stole communications
equipment belonging to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees.
   It was the first reported attack in the region since President
Yoweri Museveni came to power three years ago.

<TEXT>
   A federal judge ruled that the Customs
Service must release about 1,200 semiautomatic rifles impounded at
an airport as part of the Bush administration's ban on the
importation of assault weapons.
   The decision was issued Wednesday by U.S. District Judge William
Acker Jr., who criticized the temporary ban, initiated by federal
drug policy coordinator William Bennett.
   The ban was ``obviously the product of a `hurry-up' skull
session, if not a stampede reaction set off by Bennett,'' the judge
said.
   Acker did not overturn the ban for other rifle models imported
to other cities. But he ordered federal officials to deliver to Gun
South Inc. of Trussville about 1,200 Steyr AUG-SA rifles impounded
by customs agents at the Birmingham Municipal Airport and another
3,000 to be sent from Austria.
   The company argued that the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms approved import permits for the rifles before the Bush
administration announced its ban in late March.
   The Justice Department was reviewing the decision and had not
decided whether to appeal the judge's ruling, said spokeswoman Amy
Brown.
   There was no immediate comment from the Customs Service.
   ATF Director Stephen Higgins said in court documents that
releasing the weapons would undermine the government's policy
review of the effects of the temporary ban.
   Acker said the administration issued the ban without consulting
American gun dealers or foreign manufacturers of semiautomatic
rifles, and without re-examining ATF's past approval of the Steyr
AUG-SA.
   The ban followed a schoolyard shooting in California involving
an assault rifle.
   Gun South owner and president Don Wood, who sued four weeks ago,
testified his company would face bankruptcy if it could not receive
and sell the rifles it has ordered and committed to pay for.
   The company also claimed the Steyr AUG-SA rifle is used for
hunting, the criterion on which ATF had approved previous shipments
of the rifles.
   The Justice Department argued that the public interest in
halting importation of semiautomatic and automatic rifles pending a
review outweighed any potential harm the temporary ban might cause
Gun South.
   ``This is a small case but a significant example of why our
justice system enjoys the envy of the world. Once again, a federal
judge has enjoined the government from violating the right of way
at a constitutional intersection,'' said James C. Barton, an
attorney for Gun South.

   Housing Secretary Jack Kemp is halting more
than $100 million in low-income housing renovation projects
following an investigation that found former top HUD appointees won
lucrative contracts through a system rife with favoritism,
officials said today.
   The report by the Housing and Urban Development Department
inspector general said HUD agreed to pay $59 million in excess
housing assistance over the life of 15-year contracts that the
inspector general examined. The report said if the pattern exists
throughout the program, the excess could approach $413 million.
   Kemp said he was halting all fiscal 1989 funding for programs in
which contracts had not yet been agreed upon and ordering an audit
of existing contracts.
   His actions stopped funding for 35 projects valued at more than
$100 million while they are reconsidered, Kemp's assistant, Mary
Brunette, said today. Eight other projects for which contracts were
already in place will be allowed to continue, subject to audit, she
said.
   Kemp said Wednesday that the investigation by the HUD inspector
general found ``fundamental flaws'' in the department's Moderate
Rehabilitation program.
   He said the investigation revealed that the selection and
allocation process ``was undocumented, ignored existing standards
and regulations, and was based on the perception and reality of
favoritism and abuse of non-public information.''
   The report centered on a rehabilitation program that provides
$225 million a year for housing in which developers acquire and
renovate existing projects. By winning the contracts with HUD,
developers are able to receive low-interest commercial loans backed
with HUD's guarantee of federally subsidized tenants.
   The report by HUD Inspector General Paul Adams said former HUD
officials and employees, actively participated, often as developers
or consultants, in the projects.
   It named top-ranking HUD officials during the Reagan
administration, including former under secretary Philip Abrams and
former assistant secretary for housing Philip Winn, who later
became owner-developers in half a dozen rehabilitation projects.
   Winn is now the ambassador to Switzerland. Both he and Abrams
are from Colorado. Efforts to reach them by telephone were not
immediately successful.
   The report named several other former HUD officials who earned
money as consultants on the projects after leaving government.
Among them was Joseph Strauss, a former special assistant to
then-HUD Secretary Samuel Pierce. The report said Strauss collected
$1.3 million in consultant fees on such projects.
   Pierce's one-time executive assistant, Lance Wilson, was also
identified as an owner-developer in six projects.
   Adams said today he found no evidence of criminal activity, but
that the report was turned over to the Justice Department's public
integrity section for review.
   ``We at HUD are committed to ending both the reality and the
perception that HUD's funding processes have been tolerant of or
inattentive to program abuse,'' Kemp said in a prepared statement.
``However, the inspector general has assured me that his
investigation found no evidence of criminality or legal wrongdoing
of any kind.''
   The audit was critical of HUD management as well as management
by locally run public housing authorities.
   ``We concluded that the moderate rehabilitation program was
poorly managed,'' the report said. ``There was little or no
documentation or accountability for the public housing authorities
selected by HUD headquarters to receive the funding allocations.
   ``Moreover the housing authorities selected developers without
complying with the need for an effective competitive selection
process, and oftentimes in violation of their own administrative
plans. There was an absence of clear written policy and
guidelines.''
   The investigation covered the rehabilitation of 35,780 units
over a five -year period, 1984-1988. It found favoritism in the
awarding of the funding, saying that over half the units in that
period were awarded in 10 states, which by HUD formula were fairly
entitled to only 16 percent of the units.
   Those states were Florida, Colorado, Oklahoma, Virginia, Nevada,
Utah, Illinois and Louisiana, as well as Puerto Rico and the
District of Columbia.
   The report said former HUD officials and employees ``actively
sought and participated in the program as developers, consultants
or lender representatives.'' Of 69 projects examined, such former
insiders participated in 55, it said.
   It said consultants received fees of $500 to $1,500 per unit
from developers, and that often there was no written contracts.
   ``A perception of favoritism and abuse evolved, thereby
impacting program integrity.'' it said.
   The report said, ``There is little assurance that housing is
being provided to those locales having the greatest need, and that
limited program funds are being spent efficiently and effectively.''
   Kemp said he was canceling all funding selections in the program
for the current fiscal year that are still pending, and that over
300 projects already executed will be audited. He said he asked for
the HUD general counsel to review existing governmental and
department ethics and personnel laws and regulations in light of
the finding.

   Forty-three people have been arrested
in the latest wave of demonstrations against Chippewa Indian
spearfishing in off-reservation public lakes.
   The arrests were made Wednesday when large crowds gathered at
boat landings in northern Wisconsin where the annual Chippewa
spearing season began last weekend prior to the fishing season for
non-Indians.
   Federal courts since 1983 have upheld 19th century treaties in
which the Chippewa deeded northern Wisconsin to the United States
and were guaranteed the right to hunt, fish, trap and harvest wild
grain on public land.
   Critics say the Indians' spears leave too few trophy-size fish
for the rod-and-reel season that begins next month. More than 400
people rallied Wednesday at the state Capitol in Madison,
complaining that spearing discourages sport fishing upstate and
reduces the region's summer tourism business.
   Tribal members are expected to spear about 30,000 fish this
spring, compared with an annual hook-and-line walleye catch of
about 800,000 fish annually in northern Wisconsin.
   The Chippewa have announced plans to spear at 254 lakes.
   Five of the tribe's six Wisconsin bands fished Wednesday.
   Wardens and police have been kept busy this season shielding
spearers from hecklers, said George Meyer, DNR administrator of
enforcement for the Department of Natural Resources.
   ``It's starting out every night with a crowd someplace,'' Meyer
said.
   The Chippewa fish at night with battery-powered lights to
illuminate walleyed pike, muskellunge and other fish in shallow
water.
   At Rainbow Flowage, a Wisconsin River reservoir, 35 people were
arrested Wednesday night for disorderly conduct or obstructing
police after walking into a restricted area at a public boat
landing used by Chippewa, said David Kunelius, a DNR spokesman.
   About 150 miles to the west, six people were taken into custody
at Balsam Lake in Polk County for various offenses from scattering
nails on roads to disorderly conduct, Kunelius said.
   One man was arrested for disorderly conduct at Crescent Lake,
where a crowd peaked at about 200 people. Another was arrested for
tire slashing at Seven-Mile Lake, where there were no spearers,
Kunelius said.

   Arab League foreign ministers called today
for a cease-fire in Lebanon and said they will send observers to
monitor it.
   The ministers also said blockades of Lebanon's ports should be
lifted. The blockades touched off six weeks of intensive fighting
between Christian and Moslem forces that have left more than 270
people dead.
   The Council of Ministers from the 22 member countries, after
nearly seven hours of discussions, said the cease-fire should begin
Friday at noon.
   Their final statement did not say how many observers will be
sent or when, saying only that the plan should be carried out
``without delay.''
   Foreign Minister Farouk Al-Sharaa of Syria told reporters at the
close of the session that his country is ready to give any aid a
special six-member Arab League committee will need to help end the
fighting.
   About 40,000 Syrian troops are based in Lebanon under an 1976
Arab League peacekeeping mandate. Syria maintains it is not part of
the conflict.
   However, the Syrian army, in alliance with Druse warlord Walid
Jumblatt's Progressive Socialist Party militia of about 7,000 men,
has been fighting the 20,000 Christian troops of Gen. Michel Aoun
since March 8.
   Iraq supports Aoun in the fighting.
   The Council of Ministers met from midnight to 3:30 a.m. today,
then suspended the session. The council met again for more than
three hours beginning at 1 p.m. before issuing the final communique.
   The special committee charged in January with finding a solution
to the conflict, composed of foreign ministers from six of the 22
Arab League member nations, has recommended stationing 312 Arab
observers in Beirut, sources said.
   An Arab League delegation also met today in Washington with
Secretary of State James A. Baker III to discuss the cease-fire
plan. Aoun, whose blockade of Moslem controlled ports touched off
the latest round of fighting in Lebanon, has repeatedly called on
the United States to help end the nation's civil war.

   The City Council approved an ordinance
today that would ban plastic packaging, despite an effort in the
Legislature to block the local restriction.
   Council member Thomas Dimond said community concern about the
city's waste disposal problems led to the 6-1 vote.
   ``When you see that groundswell, we're certainly headed in the
right direction,'' he said.
   The council voted to ban non-degradable, non-returnable,
non-recyclable packaging. The local ordinance, identical to one
approved last month in the twin city of Minneapolis, would become
effective in July 1990.
   A state Senate Tax Committee refused Tuesday to remove from a
recycling bill a provision that would block such local plastics
bans.
   Most supporters of the anti-plastics laws believe the bans
should be implemented on a county or state level.
   Advocates of such bans say plastics take up too much space when
buried in landfills and do not decompose. They also argue that
plastics might release harmful emissions when burned in
incinerators.
   Plastics manufacturers and grocers, who say the bans will be an
economic disaster, promised to fight the anti-plastics laws at the
state level and in the courts.
   Among items that could be banned under the Twin Cities'
ordinances are foam egg cartons and trays in meat packages, plastic
products shipped into the state, such as ketchup bottles and peanut
butter jars, grocery bags, drinking cups, serving trays and plates.
   The ordinances expand on less stringent laws adopted in New
York's Suffolk County; Berkeley, Calif.; and Portland, Ore., said
Council member Bob Long, who wrote the ordinance and shared it with
Minneapolis.

   William Bligh, long portrayed as the villain of
the mutiny on the H.M.S. Bounty, is regaining heroic stature as the
200th anniversary of the revolt led by Fletcher Christian is
observed Friday.
   ``The old view of Bligh as a bully is largely legend and I'm
afraid that Hollywood, Charles Laughton, Trevor Howard, Clark Gable
and Marlon Brando have a lot to do with it,'' said Baron Terence
Lewin, a retired Royal Navy admiral.
   Laughton and Howard played Bligh as a flogging villain in the
``Mutiny on the Bounty'' films of 1935 and 1962, in which Gable and
then Brando portrayed Christian, the leader of the mutiny, as
upright and virtuous.
   ``Bligh was abrasive but the mutiny was a flash-in-the-pan
affair that might easily have never taken place if he had not upset
Fletcher Christian the day before by accusing him of stealing his
coconuts,'' Lewin said in an interview.
   ``In fact,'' said Lewin, ``Bligh was a great navigator, a brave
commander in battle and a fine seaman who looked after the comfort
and health of his sailors in an age when going to sea could let you
in for a pretty rough time.''
   The 68-year-old admiral, who won the Distinguished Service Cross
for World War II high seas action, greeted visitors to a preview
Thursday of an exhibition open through Oct. 1 at the National
Maritime Museum in Greenwich, southeast London, to mark the 200th
anniversary of the mutiny.
   Anthony Hopkins, who reinterpreted Bligh as sympathetic in the
1984 film, ``The Bounty,'' opened the exhibition and said: ``I
think Bligh was a perfectionist who failed in human relations. But
he was a great character whose strength and vision made history.''
   The museum show celebrates Bligh's long career, his heroism
under the command of Adm. Horatio Nelson, his achievements as
navigator with explorer Capt. James Cook and his feat of seamanship
after being cast adrift from the Bounty, of which he was captain.
With 18 loyal crewmen, he sailed a 23-foot open boat 3,618 nautical
miles in 47 days to Timor, Indonesia.
   A central exhibit is the Bounty's chronometer which the
mutineers took to their Pitcairn Island refuge.
   Also displayed are blackened relics of wood, copper and iron
sheathing from the Bounty, which Christian burned, knowing the
Admiralty would try to hunt him down.
   Christian's brother, Edward, resented Bligh's published account
and replied with his own denouncing Bligh as a blackguard. ``That
was the start of what we now feel is the legend of bully Bligh,''
said Helen Mitchell, the museum's exhibitions officer.
   Glyn Christian, a descendant of the mutineer, said: ``Fletcher
Christian was a slaver, a law-breaker, a mutineer, a pirate, and
probably a fool, but there never really was a mutiny of the
Bounty's crew.''
   ``It was really a revolt by one man against another and I look
forward to the day when there is no urge to blame either of them,''
he said.
   Bligh had been sent to Tahiti to collect breadfruit plants. The
mutiny took place after the Bounty's crew had spent six months in
the tropical paradise.
   ``It must have been a marvelous place with all those beautiful
girls,'' Lewin said. ``Discipline became too lax and Bligh had no
Royal Marines to enforce it on the ship, which is customary in the
navy, and no commissioned officers.''
   Ten recaptured mutineers were returned to England and
court-martialed, and three of them were hanged. Bligh was honorably
acquitted by a naval inquiry.

   Pressured by consumer and grocer concerns
over food safety, state agriculture officials are about to offer a
``quality assurance'' seal for produce grown by farmers who agree
to meet all pesticide regulations.
   The plan developed quickly after consumer scares in March over
the use of the chemical Alar on apples and the discovery of cyanide
in two Chilean grapes.
   Despite the short lead time, the California Department of Food
and Agriculture is expected to inaugurate the new system early next
month unless a hitch develops.
   The language of the ``quality assurance'' seals has been under
review by the state Attorney General and governor's staffs this
week to see if it would present any legal liabilities for the state.
   Participating growers would sign a contract with the state in
which they would agree to comply with all laws and regulations and
manufacturer's label instructions governing any pesticides they use.
   The state will test about 2,500 samples of crops from those
signing up for the voluntary program. That sampling, financed by an
additional one cent per box levy paid by participants, will be in
addition to the 8,000-9,000 pesticide tests the department already
conducts on fruits and vegetables each year, by far the most of any
state in the nation.
   Growers in the program whose crops are below tolerance limits
for pesticide residue will be able to label their produce with a
``quality assurance'' sticker certified by the state.
   ``This will give them a seal to use that it is
California-produced in accordance with California laws and
regulations,'' said Jim Wells, who oversees the agriculture
department's pesticide regulatory program. ``Retailers and growers
alike feel that kind of thing will help put the public's mind at
ease.''
   However, Harry Snyder of Consumers Union said growers should
quit using pesticides and predicted that the program will fail
because buyers who consider pesticides dangerous won't be appeased
by a seal on produce.
   ``People have the perception this stuff is dangerous,'' Snyder
said. ``Well, it's an accurate perception.''
   After the Alar and cyanide incidents, the California Grocers
Association persuaded state agricultural officials to start this
program, said President Don Beaver.
   ``We have no control as retailers what is being used by
growers,'' Beaver said. ``All we want to know is, if we are buying
it and we are paying for it, that it's safe for consumers.''
   Officials of grower organizations expressed cautious enthusiasm,
although some felt the system should be mandatory instead of
voluntary or should be delayed a year to allow more time to prepare
for the change.
   ``The indication we've gotten from retailers and also from the
California Grocers Association is that they intend to buy only from
those who have the seal, so suddenly we have some questions,'' said
Richard Matoian of the California Grape and Tree Fruit League.
``Once one person puts a stamp on a box, everybody's going to have
to do it to keep their markets.''
   Iceberg lettuce probably will be the first crop to use the new
seals because growers report they are ready to sign up now.
   ``The position our industry has taken is they do support the
seal, and they're ready to start implementing it as soon as the
state wants to do it,'' said Wade Whitfield, president of the
California Iceberg Lettuce Commission.
   Beaver feels food is safe now, but because the public perceives
that some isn't, such a program is necessary to help restore
consumers' confidence.

   More than 150,000 students and workers calling
for democracy pushed through police lines Thursday and marched
cheering and singing through central Beijing in communist China's
biggest protest ever.
   Workers by the thousands joined the students, giving them
popsicles and bread in their strongest act of support in 11 days of
protests.
   Beijing residents escorted the students on bicycles and foot and
tried to shield them from soldiers and police, who had issued harsh
warnings against marches.
   But the security forces were unarmed, and although they pushed
fiercely against advancing students in a vain effort to halt their
march, they did not use other force against them.
   There was no immediate information on any injuries in the crush.
   The march turned instead into a jubilant procession. For more
than 15 hours, the students marched through streets and under
overpasses jammed with thousands of applauding people. High-rise
dwellers leaned from their windows to watch, store clerks stood in
their doorways and the patients of one hospital emerged in
blue-and-white-striped pajamas.
   The march was the biggest and most dramatic action yet by
Beijing students in their campaign for sweeping democratic reforms,
including a free press and an end to corruption.
   In Washington, the State Department called for restraint on the
part of Chinese authorities and hoped the demonstrations would
remain peaceful.
   ``The United States believes in and supports the right of
peaceful assembly, including peaceful protest and the freedom of
expression,'' department spokeswoman Margaret Tutweler said.
   Even before the march ended, the government announced it was
willing to hold talks with the students ``at any time'' if the
students return to their campuses and ``adopt a calm and reasonable
attitude.''
   However, a government spokesman quoted by the official Xinhua
News Agency said the talks should be conducted through official
student groups already rejected by the protesters as
non-democratic. The government calls the protesters' newly formed
unions illegal.
   Xinhua later quoted a city spokesman as saying many of the
students' demands, such as wiping out corruption, were ``in accord
with the wishes of the party and the government.'' The spokesman,
who was not identified, urged the students to return to class,
disband their illegal organizations and stop agitating.
   Protest leaders did not immediately respond.
   Other government statements read on the evening TV news
emphasized the need for stability for China to develop and accused
some protesters of trying to overthrow the party and government.
   The students have called for Premier Li Peng to resign and say
senior leader Deng Xiaoping, 84, is too old to rule.
   Most students say their campaign is not anti-government and they
only want the leaders to do their job better and respect human
rights.
   The march was the biggest since the communists took power in
1949.
   Student protests in 1986-87 resulted in the ouster of reformer
Hu Yaobang as Communist Party chief. Hu's death on April 15 touched
off the new protests.
   ``The government has lost face,'' said one student as marchers
surged onto Tiananmen Square, the symbolic seat of power in China.
   It was not clear what the next step in the protest would be.
   The students say they plan another march Thursday, the 70th
anniversary of China's first student movement for democracy.
   At least 75,000 students from 20 schools took part in the more
than 20-mile march.
   The government warned Wednesday that the march would be illegal,
and Chinese sources had reported soldiers were brought into the
city from outlying counties.
   ``We fear nothing,'' read one of hundreds of banners waved by
the students.
   The marchers met the first police barricade a half-mile from its
start at Quinghua University, but the students managed in 15
minutes of violent shoving to press through three rows of police.
   ``It was like watching an iron bar bend,'' one viewer said.
   Five more police lines were breached in the same way. Police at
one barricades sent the students through with pats on the back, and
several officers told the youths, ``We understand you. We won't hit
you.''
   At one point bystanders rushed to surround police trucks that
pulled up beside the marchers. ``Don't hit the students!'' the
crowd chanted.
   A similar scene occurred at Tiananmen Square, when a dozen
trucks filled with soldiers pulled up in the marchers' path. Dozens
of people climbed onto the sides of the trucks.
   ``Welcome 38th Army!'' they shouted, handing the soldiers
student protest leaflets.
   Students also gave out copies of a letter written in English to
the U.N. Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, asking
``in this moment of top emergency ... for sympathetic understanding
and moral support.''

   Karen Oldham's husband died five months ago,
one of six Kansas City, Mo., firefighters killed when they
responded to a fire unaware the burning trailer contained 50,000
pounds of highly explosive ammonium nitrate.
   Herb Kelly says he has a kidney infection and lung cancer he
blames on exposure to radiation during his 27 years working at the
Department of Energy's Fernald nuclear facility in Ohio.
   Mrs. Oldham and Kelly are among thousands due to participate
Friday in ``Workers Memorial Day,'' when labor unions plan more
than 100 events in 37 states and the District of Columbia to
highlight safety issues in a month of anniversaries of milestones
and tragedies in job safety.
   ``I think it's important to remember the workers who have been
hurt and killed in the line of duty,'' Kelly said in a telephone
interview. ``Maybe this type of thing can stop it before it gets
worse.''
   One of the events will be in Honolulu, marking the first
anniversary of the death of flight attendant C.B. Lansing, who
vanished 24,000 feet above the Pacific on April 28, 1988, when the
roof of Aloha Air Flight 243 ripped open.
   In Bridgeport, Conn., a ceremony will honor the 28 construction
workers killed two years ago this month in a building collapse.
   Friday was chosen because it is the 19th anniversary of the
founding of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.
   The events, organizers say, will highlight what they see as the
shortcomings of OSHA and its accomplishments and serve as a
reminder that an estimated 10,000 people a year are killed on the
job. That estimate does not include those who die of job-related
diseases or suffer non-fatal injuries at work.
   According to government figures, jobs in mining, transportation,
construction and agriculture carry the highest risk of fatal
injury, with unguarded machinery, trench cave-ins, electrocution
and motor vehicle accidents responsible for the largest number of
deaths.
   ``If we are to do honor to the thousands of working men and
women who have sacrificed life and limb on the job, then we must
redouble our efforts to enact stronger and more effective laws,''
said AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland, who will attend the memorial
service for the Kansas City firefighters Friday. ``We will fight
until the day when the spilling of workers' blood at the job site
is nothing more than a memory.''
   A study released Thursday by a private Washington research group
supports some of labor's criticisms of OSHA.
   The agency, considered by labor leaders to be short-staffed,
lost one-third of its inspectors to Reagan administration budget
cuts, fails to coordinate criminal investigations with the Justice
Department, levies fines so small they serve as no deterrent to
worker-safety abuses and lacks the necessary police authority to
halt unsafe practices, the Bureau of National Affairs said. It said
it interviewed more than 125 prosecutors, private attorneys, labor,
industry officials and government officials and others.
   The 1.2 million-member American Federation of State, County and
Municipal Employees has rallies planned in 30 cities to point out
what it considers another flaw of OSHA: it does not cover
public-sector employees.
   Some of the tragedies being remembered were highly publicized.
Others received little attention.
   In Bloomington, Ill., demonstrators will read a roll of former
workers at an asbestos plant whose deaths allegedly were linked to
exposure to the product; in Omaha, Neb., three U.S. senators will
join workers to discuss hazards in the meatpacking industry.
   The AFL-CIO is organizing about a dozen of the events; its
member unions dozens more, from northern Maine to southern
California to the memorial service for Lansing in Honolulu.
   In New York, bus drivers will pull into the nearest stop to
honor a one-minute moment of silence and Roman Catholic Cardinal
John O'Connor will lead a special labor Mass honoring workers
killed on the job, including two track workers struck by a train
March 30. Bells will toll across the state at 12:15 p.m. EDT.
   In Cincinnati, Ohio Gov. Richard Celeste, Sen. Howard
Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, and others are to discuss contamination at
Fernald.
   Kelly said he'll be on hand. He has not worked since 1984
because of his illnesses; the government is fighting his workers'
compensation claim on grounds there is no evidence his health
problems are linked to his former job.

<HEAD>Suggetion to Remove Lenin's Body From Mausoleum Creates Scandal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK J. PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A stage director has caused a furor reaching all
the way to the Communist Party Central Committee by suggesting on
live TV that Vladimir I. Lenin's body be removed from the mausoleum
on Red Square and buried.
   Lenin's mausoleum at the Kremlin Wall is visited by millions of
Soviets every year, reflecting the reverence in which the Soviet
founder still is held.
   Two candidate members of the party's policy-making Central
Committee, speaking at a meeting Tuesday, criticized the suggestion
by Mark Zakharov, director of Moscow's Leninsky Komsomol Theater.
   Zakharov said on the weekly discussion program ``Vzglad'' that
Lenin's body should be removed from the mausoleum where it has been
kept since his death in 1924 and buried.
   The mausoleum, he and other speakers said, should be turned into
a monument to the Soviet founder without his body.
   ``Vzglad'' is one of the most outspoken and popular shows on
Soviet TV, and the April 21 live show was broadcast only hours
after official TV carried a Kremlin ceremony marking Lenin's 119th
birthday.
   ``To repeat these kinds of questions is, it seems to me, simply
immoral,'' said Ratmir Bobovikov, regional party leader in Vladimir.
   ``Literally the next morning people began calling the party
committee and in disbelieve asking, `How are we supposed to
understand this? Whose point of view is this?' '' he said.
   Another Central Committee member criticized the show for
broadcasting the comments.
   ``Why does our television _ state, party television _ permit
such statements?'' said Georgy Zhukov, a candidate Central
Committee member who retired at Tuesday's meeting.
   Alexander Aksenov, director of the state radio and television
committee, said ``Vzglad'' was ``a live broadcast and no one
expected anything like it.''
   He indicated that editors face disciplinary action for the
broadcast.
   Although ``Vzglad'' is one of the most popular shows on Soviet
TV, its editors have been chastised more than once for the
viewpoints expressed on the show, he said.
   Even under the greater openness of President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's policies, Lenin is rarely criticized.
   On major state holidays, May Day and Revolution Day, the Soviet
leadership stands atop the mausoleum to review parades.
   Lenin's widow, Nadezhda Krupskaya, bitterly opposed interment of
Lenin in an above-ground mausoleum where his body could be viewed,
but she was overruled by the party leaders, including Josef Stalin.
   When Stalin died in 1953, his body was placed in the mausoleum,
but it was removed in 1961 after Premier Nikita S. Khrushchev began
a liberalization campaign and a re-evaluation of Stalin's ``cult of
personality.''

<HEAD>Lujan Says He Underestimated Problem of Louisiana's Vanishing Coastline</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB McKNIGHT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan said Thursday
he underestimated the problem of protecting Louisiana's
disappearing coastal marshes, which are vanishing at the rate of
about an acre every 15 minutes.
   Louisiana loses 30 to 50 square miles of its coastal marshes
each year. The wetlands support a billion-dollar seafood industry
and serve as the winter home for about 5 million migratory birds.
   Lujan was here for a meeting at the Petroleum Club of New
Orleans; he also visited an offshore drilling rig.
   ``At first, I thought that all we needed to do was put riprp and down
the coast,'' Lujan said. ``And
then someone explained to me that was not possible.''
   For one thing, Louisiana's 400 miles of coastline translates to
almost 7,000 miles of shoreline when the bays, inlets and
peninsulas are included. Solid objects also tend to sink in the
marshy soil of the shoreline.
   Louisiana, with 40 percent of the nation's coastal wetlands,
suffers 80 percent of the annual loss. Most of the loss is due to
industrialization along the Mississippi River, which robs the
marshes of the fresh water and silt that used to renew them.
   Lujan said the ``no net loss'' policy proclaimed by President
Bush probably can't be interpreted to mean that an acre of
Louisiana marsh must be reclaimed for every acre lost.

<HEAD>Vietnam Returns 21 Sets of Remains to U.S.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vietnam on Thursday returned 21 sets of
remains believed to be those of Americans killed in the Vietnam
War, and U.S. sources said they expected talks soon on further
repatriations of the dead.
   Vietnam's Communist Party leader Nguyen Van Linh said the two
countries were ``cooperating fruitfully'' to solve humanitarian
issues arising from the long, bloody conflict.
   The resolution of the missing in action issue and Vietnam's
military occupation of Cambodia have been the prime obstacles to
normalization of ties between Vietnam and the United States.
   A dispatch from the official Vietnam News Agency, monitored in
Bangkok, said the remains were turned over to a representative of
the Hawaii-based U.S. Joint Casualty Resolution Center, the
military unit tasked with resolving the fates of more than 2,300
MIAs from the Indochina conflict.
   According to a U.S. spokesmen, a team from the center was to
have picked up the remains in a ceremony at Hanoi airport, then
take them to army laboratories in Honolulu for analysis.
   The Vietnamese report did not provide details but said the
Americans ``highly appreciated the humanitarian policy, goodwill
and cooperation'' of Vietnam.
   U.S. official sources, who asked not to be identified, said
talks on more repatrations were likely to take place in the near
future.
   There are 1,730 Americans still listed as missing in action in
Vietnam, while 634 others are missing in Cambodia, Laos and China.
The war ended in 1975 with communist victories over U.S.-backed
governments in Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos.
   A 20-member U.S. military flew to Hanoi from Bangkok on Thursday
aboard a U.S. Air Force C-131 transport to pick up the remains. The
team, headed by Lt. Col. Bill Jordan, was due to arrive in Honolulu
on Friday after an overnight stop in Guam.
   Counting Thursday's repatriation, Vietnam has returned 184 sets
of remains since 1987, when it was agreed to accelerate cooperation
in exchange for Washington's help in encouraging private
humanitarian aid to Vietnam.
   The U.S. military says that of those remains returned since
mid-1987, 45 have been positively identified as those of U.S.
servicemen killed in the conflict.
   A team of 10 U.S. military specialists has been in Vietnam since
April 12, working with Vietnamese in the fifth joint investigation
on MIAs. They are interviewing villagers who saw plane crashes and
seeking other evidence of the missing men.
   The investigators will work until April 30 in the longest such
project thus far.
   American experts believe that while other remains will probably
be found, a total resolution of all on the MIA roster is impossible
given the corrosive tropical climate, difficult terrain and the
fact that many died at sea.
   The lack of diplomatic relations between the onetime enemies has
hampered progress on the MIA and other humanitarian issues.
   But Vietnam announced April 5 that it will withdraw all of its
troops from Cambodia by Sept. 30, and progress on the MIA
resolution has been substantial.
   ``At present, the Vietnam-U.S. relationship is not good but it
is better than that during the U.S. aggression against Vietnam,''
Linh said in a recent interview.
   ``The two countries are cooperating fruitfully in the settlement
of humanitarian issues of both sides,'' he said. ``We are prepared
to look forward.''
   Linh, who is seeking to expand ties with the non-communist
world, said normal relations with the United States would ``benefit
both sides as well as peace and stability in the region.''

   Health experts told Congress Thursday that
Third World methods could help reduce infant mortality rates in the
United States.
   ``Approximately 40,000 infants die each year'' in the United
States, said Lacey A. Gude, a Washington businesswoman who serves
as secretary of the National Association of the Partners of the
Americas, a group that aimes to foster cooperation among the
nations in the Western Hemisphere.
   She said health workers in Latin America are used to making do
with little money and to dealing with poor people.
   She cited a card that Brazilian communities give new mothers to
keep track of their children's weight and vaccinations. Babies who
die soon after birth are often underweight.
   ``A simple device like this has made a big impact on educational
programs in other countries and we believe it can help us reduce
our own infant mortality rates here in the states,'' she said.
   Ms. Gude and others testified to the House committee on hunger.
   Dr. Norbert Hirschhorn testified in favor of the cure now
widespread in poor countries for diarrhea in babies: a simple
mixture of water, sugar or glucose and salt that can be drunk.
   Such an oral rehydration treatment using ``rice powder in place
of glucose is palatable and helps slow diarrhea,'' he said.
   He said the standard U.S. treatment for dehydration, the loss of
body fluids, is to give replacement fluids intravenously. But this
treatment is expensive and not always available outside hospitals.
   Hirschhorn is vice president of John Snow, Inc. a consulting
firm.
   Rep. Mike Espy, D-Miss., chairman of the committee's domestic
task force, said diarrhea annually kills about 500 American
children under age five. Rep. Mickey Leland, D-Texas, chairman of
the committee, estimated that oral rehydration saves 750,000 to a
million lives every year in the Third World.
   Dr. Stanley Foster said the United States could learn from other
countries about immunizing pre-school children against measles and
whooping cough.
   ``Coverage for measles'' for children under age two in some
large U.S. metropolitan areas ``has been documented to be as low as
49 percent,'' he testified.
   ``This is lower than in many nations of the developing world.
...''
   Dr. Foster directs the field services division of the U.S.
government's International Health Program Office.
   Dr. Sandra Huffman, president of the Center to Prevent Childhood
Malnutrition, said that breast feeding is less common in the United
States than in Canada, Sweden, the Netherlands or Australia.
   ``The United States has far to go if we are to catch up with
breast-feeding rates in those developed countries, all of which
have lower infant mortality rates than the United Statses,'' she
testified.

<TEXT>
   Republicans breathed easier Thursday after
Craig Thomas' solid victory in a hotly contested congressional race
in Wyoming, but Democrats still claimed ``a lot of momentum'' from
the three special elections during George Bush's first 100 days as
president.
   ``We feel good about two out of three,'' said Democratic Party
chairman Ron Brown.
   After a 40-day campaign marked by heavy involvement by both
national parties, Thomas defeated Democrat John Vinich on Wednesday
for the House seat given up by Republican Dick Cheney when he was
appointed secretary of defense.
   Unofficial returns gave Thomas 74,258 votes, or 52 percent, to
Vinich's 60,821 votes, or 43 percent.
   There were few claims that the contest had any broad national
importance, with most analysts concluding merely that as Wyoming
goes, so goes Wyoming.
   ``It's a strain to try to come up with anything of national
significance,'' said Tom Mann, director of governmental studies at
the Brookings Institution.
   ``Unlike the Democrats, who like to beat their breasts and claim
national implications in every special election, we will simply say
that in this one the best man won,'' said Rep. Guy Vander Jagt of
Michigan, chairman of the House GOP campaign committee.
   Brown noted that the Democrats won the first two special House
elections this year and he said a victory in Wyoming would have
been ``like winning the Pennsylvania lottery.''
   ``It's the first thing after a presidential election where the
Republicans win and are feeling pretty full of themselves and we
come in and the first three tests do real well,'' said Brown.
   The possibility that the Democrats might make it three in a row
had Republicans feeling on edge early in the Wyoming campaign,
despite the fact Republicans outnumber Democrats three-to-two among
the state's registered voters.
   ``It's like getting a big ball and chain cut,'' said GOP
campaign committee spokesman John Buckley of the returns from
Wyoming.
   ``I think we have a lot of momentum coming out of this series of
three special elections,'' said Howard Schloss, spokesman for the
Democratic House campaign committee.
   The president did not campaign in Wyoming. Any possibility that
he might was quashed when out-of-state involvement became in issue
on both sides.
   After Bush's landslide victory over Democrat Michael Dukakis in
November _ the fifth GOP victory in the last six presidential
elections _ Republicans set their sights on diminishing if not
ending Democratic dominance of Congress.
   The battle was joined early with a special election last month
in Indiana to fill the House seat once held by Vice President Dan
Quayle. Democrat Jill Long was the upset victor after a campaign in
which she tagged her GOP opponent as soft on taxes, a theme often
used against Democrats by GOP candidates.
   In a second special election one week later in Alabama, the
Democrats held a seat by a landslide margin, dashing Republican
hopes for a show of strength in the Deep South.
   Ed Rollins, who had signed on with the GOP campaign committee at
a fee of $250,000 a year, proclaimed the stakes were high in
Wyoming and said the campaign was ``something I've had my hands on
since day one.''
   Democrat Vinich immediately started running ads talking about
``outside Washington consultants'' taking control of the Thomas
campaign.
   Thomas countered with ads saying that 80 percent of Vinich's
campaign money came from out-of-state labor unions.
   The Democrat started the Wyoming campaign with a big edge over
Thomas in name recognition. Five months earlier, Vinich had come
within 1,322 votes of upsetting Sen. Malcolm Wallop.
   Vander Jagt chided the Democrats for running a Willie
Horton-style campaign that accused Thomas of being soft on
criminals.
   ``It was not a pleasant campaign,'' he said.
   Brown said he planned to study polling results to determine the
impact of the negative ads run in Wyoming.
   ``It's too early to tell,'' he said.
   In the presidential campaign, Bush succeeded in tagging Dukakis
as soft on crime by citing a Massachusetts prison furlough program
and particularly the case of Horton, a convict who left while on
furlough and raped a woman in Maryland.
   In Wyoming, Vinich ran ads accusing Thomas of being soft on
criminals by voting for legislation that allowed certain felons to
serve sentences in county jails rather than the state prison. The
ads were criticized by many Democrats who pointed out that the
legislation passed both chambers of the Wyoming Legislature with
only three dissenting votes and then was signed by a Democratic
governor.

   Some townspeople won't claim folk singer
Woody Guthrie as a native son, while others say the town hasn't
done enough to capitalize on the Dust Bowl balladeer and lure
tourists whizzing past on Interstate 40.
   The decades-old argument is raised anew this week because
Guthrie's son, Arlo, is giving a benefit concert Saturday at
Okemah's venerable Crystal Theatre.
   It will be Arlo Guthrie's first performance in his father's
hometown.
   ``I don't feel an obligation to push my dad on anyone,'' the
younger Guthrie said in a recent interview. ``His work, his life
can stand on its own. Time and history have spoken for him. Now, I
can relax a bit and just have fun with his music and just be my
dad's kid.''
   Theater owner Mark Smyth said he has sold out the 698-seat
theater at $10 a ticket, but he said many of those attending will
be from out of town.
   ``I wouldn't go across the street to hear it,'' said Dorothy
Webb, an Okemah resident since 1931. ``I'm not for it at all, and
I'm against it.''
   Detractors call Woody Guthrie, whose songs included ``This Land
is Your Land,'' a Communist and a ``militant atheist.'' Supporters
say he was a patriot and a defender of the downtrodden.
   ``If you'd read what Woody wrote, you'd know how he felt,'' said
Guthrie's sister, Mary Jo Edgmon of Seminole.
   Last week, local funeral home director Bart Webb, Mrs. Webb's
son, placed a poster outside the downtown American Legion hall
proclaiming ``Woody Was No Hero.'' A local newspaper reporter who
tore it down faces municipal charges.
   For years, a town water tower has proclaimed to traffic on I-40
that Okemah is Guthrie's home. But when the ramshackle house
Guthrie lived in until he left Okemah at age 17 began falling down,
locals let it go. Its pieces are stored for possible future
restoration.
   Guthrie was born 76 years ago in this central Oklahoma town of
3,300. He died in 1967 at age 55 of Huntington's chorea, a
hereditary degenerative disorder.
   There are no monuments to him in Oklahoma. His ashes were
scattered over the Atlantic.
   Guthrie denied he was a Communist, and the House Un-American
Activities Committee that focused on entertainers in the 1950s
didn't call him to testify.
   Guy Logsdon, a retired University of Tulsa professor who has
lectured about Guthrie and performed his music for years, noted
that Guthrie served in the Merchant Marine during World War II.
   ``Woody was outspoken. He was a radical in a lot of ways and
controversial,'' Logsdon said. ``Most people never considered Woody
a threat to the security of this nation.
   ``Woody was very patriotic. All you have to do is look at his
songs.''
   Guthrie wrote more than 1,000 songs, including classics such as
``So Long, It's Been Good to Know You.'' Many have become folk
standards.
   He led a vagabond existence after leaving Okemah, writing and
performing about what he saw in migrant worker camps from Oklahoma
to California. His songs railed against the abuses of the poor.
   Smyth, an Okemah native, guessed that the town's residents are
``80 percent pro-Woody.''
   ``But the little core group that are against Woody are pretty
vocal,'' he said.
   ``Two or three people, they speak out against Woody,'' said
Logsdon. ``Then there has been the right-wing element, it has
always circulated things quietly against Woody.
   ``There will always be those who don't like Woody, and don't
know why. Woody liked Okemah. He was proud of Oklahoma and Okemah.
He loved both places. He didn't always paint a pretty picture,
because he wrote what he experienced.''
   Logsdon said Guthrie would not have been surprised by the debate.
   ``He would enjoy the controversy and would laugh,'' he said.
``He had the ability to laugh at himself and laugh at life.''

   A trouble-free countdown gave NASA
workers some breathing room today as preparations proceeded toward
Friday's midafternoon launch of Atlantis and five astronauts. The
mission will propel a probe to Venus on the first space shuttle
planetary mission.
   ``We're ready to go fly,'' said Richard Truly, the former
astronaut who has been nominated as NASA administrator. The
Magellan spacecraft, ready for its 15-month flight to Venus, ``is
in good shape,'' said Lennard Fisk, NASA's chief scientist. After
an 11-year hiatus in deep space exploration, he said, ``No one is
going to question our leadership in planetary (flight) again.''
   Officials called it their smoothest countdown in 29 shuttle
missions.
   ``We just don't have anything out there that we're worried
about; it's been a real smooth count and we expect it to continue
that way,'' NASA test director Ronald Phelps told reporters.
   Phelps spoke as the countdown was halted for 15-hours, 34
minutes. The hold was planned to allow for any catchup work in case
of problems, but Phelps said there were none.
   As the NASA crew prepared for its four-day flight, three Soviet
cosmonauts returned to Earth today, leaving the Mir space station
unmanned for the first time in more than two years. Three of the
cosmonauts had been in orbit for five months, the third for eight
months.
   When the Atlantis count resumes shortly before midnight, the
launch team will make preparation to begin loading more than
500,000 gallons of propellant into Atlantis' fuel tanks.
   The only concern, and it was slight, was the possibility of
crosswinds of more than 17 mph that could be dangerous if the
shuttle had to make an emergency landing on a runway near the
launch pad.
   Shuttle managers assessed all facets of the flight during a
day-long meeting Wednesday and reported, ``all preparations are
progressing satisfactorily. There are no technical or programmatic
issues. ... Weather is expected to be good.''
   Liftoff of the 29th shuttle mission and the fourth since the
Challenger explosion three years ago is set for 2:24 p.m. Friday.
The launch team will have only a 23-minute period in which to get
the shuttle off the ground because of the need to deploy the
Magellan probe from a precise point in space and the requirement
that liftoff occur before darkness falls on emergency landing sites
in Spain and Morocco.
   The astronauts were to review flight plans and make efficiency
runs in jet aircraft today.
   They are commander David Walker, pilot Ron Grabe and mission
specialists Mary Cleave, Mark Lee and Norm Thagard.
   Late Friday, about six hours after liftoff, Lee and Cleave will
release Magellan from the cargo bay and an hour later a rocket will
hurl the 7,600-pound payload on a 450-day voyage to Venus.
   Magellan is to orbit the cloud-veiled planet and map up to 90
percent of the surface with a high resolution radar system.
   Its images should reveal details as small as 100 yards across,
about the size of a football field. This is 10 times sharper than
any previous pictures of the planet.
   ``All our previous data from Venus has been low resolution and
about all that data has done is tell us basically there are
continent-size mountain masses on Venus and that there are
extensive rolling plains,'' Magellan project scientist Joseph Boyce
said Friday.
   ``We don't know whether Venus ever had oceans, we don't know how
Venus rids itself of its internal heat, and we don't know if Venus
is still volcanically active,'' he said. ``Magellan's goal is to
answer these questions and improve on our knowledge of the
geophysical and geological properties of Venus and the nature of
processes that shape its surface.''
   Boyce said the images could help scientists understand how Earth
and its sister planet Venus evolved so differently, even though
they basically were identical when formed at the beginning of the
solar system.
   The surface temperature on Venus is 900 degrees Fahrenheit and
its atmospheric pressure is 90 times that of Earth's. The
atmosphere is composed primarily of carbon dioxide and a thick
cloud of sulfuric acid drops.
   John H. Gerpheide, Magellan project manager, said the $550
million Magellan mission will mark ``the beginning of a big year
for the planetary program.''
   ``In August the Voyager spacecraft will fly by Neptune and in
October we'll launch Galileo to Jupiter,'' he told reporters
Wednesday.
   ``So after an 11-year gap in the planetary program, we're
anxious to get started,'' he said. ``We have our team in place .. .
and the butterflies are soon to arrive.''
   The last planetary mission launched by the United States was the
1978 Pioneer-Venus probe. Voyager 2, launched in 1977, will take
the first closeup look at distant Neptune in August after earlier
exploring Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus.

<HEAD>Weak Consumer Spending, Strong Income Gain Boost Savings Rate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NANCY BENAC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government said Thursday that consumer
spending rose a slim 0.2 percent in March, its weakest performance
in six months and a sign, analysts said, that consumers are
contributing to an economic slowdown.
   The sluggish spending came even as personal income rose a strong
0.8 percent. That combination boosted the personal savings rate to
its highest level in nearly four years, the Commerce Department
reported.
   Analysts said Thursday's reports provided new confirmation that
the economic acceleration is slowing and that consumers are helping
apply the brakes.
   ``It is consistent with this view of the wary consumer, of
consumers not being sure that their paychecks are going to stretch
to cover the rising costs of things in their budgets,'' said
economist Cynthia Latta of Data Resources Inc. in Lexington, Mass.
   Personal income in March rose sharply to a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of $4.35 trillion after advances of 1 percent in
February and 1.7 percent in January.
   Personal spending, meanwhile, edged up to a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of $3.39 trillion after gains of 0.5 percent in
February and 0.7 percent in January. Last month's 0.2 percent
advance was the weakest performance since spending held steady in
September.
   With the advances in income consistently outstripping the gains
in spending, the personal savings rate has been edging up and in
March hit 6.3 percent, the highest level since it was at 6.4
percent in May 1985.
   The savings rate _ savings as a percentage of after-tax income _
has been on the increase since it hit a 40-year low of 3.2 percent
in 1987. Last year, the savings rate was 4.2 percent. In January,
it was 5.1 percent; in February, 5.8 percent.
   Analysts cautioned, however, that the savings rate has been
inflated in recent months by strong farm income and slower sales of
autos and other expensive items that have a disproportionate effect
on the rate.
   The March increase in personal income was due partly to special
factors, including profit-sharing payments to auto workers, a big
increase in retroactive Social Security benefits and farm subsidies.
   Even excluding those factors, however, income rose a solid 0.6
percent.
   The weakness in spending was concentrated in purchases of
durable goods, ``big ticket'' items expected to last at least three
years. Spending on durables declined 1.5 percent last month,
largely due to slow auto sales.
   Purchases of non-durable goods, meanwhile, rose 0.4 percent;
spending on services advanced 0.5 percent.
   With consumer spending accounting for two-thirds of the nation's
economic activity, any slowing trend there can be widely felt.
   However, economist Michael Evans, head of a Washington
consulting firm, said that so far in the slowdown, ``consumers are
contributing a little bit ... but they're not the main reason.''
   Added Sandra Shaber of the Futures Group in Washington:
   ``A major slowdown in consumer spending can tip the economy into
a recession, but I don't think it's going to be consumers who will
do that.''
   Many analysts expect smaller advances in exports and business
investment to play a big role in slowing the economy this year.
   The Federal Reserve Board for a year has been pushing up
interest rates in an effort to relieve inflationary pressures by
restraining economic growth.
   More information about inflation became available Thursday when
the Labor Department reported that the prices Americans paid for
imported goods rose 1.7 percent in the first quarter while prices
of U.S. goods sold overseas advanced 1.4 percent.
   Data Resources economist Nigel Gault said the increases are
``consistent with the fact that the industrialized nations as a
whole are getting close to full capacity'' at their factories, a
condition that can create shortages and bottlenecks that drive up
prices.
   Gault said it will take some time ``for the tightening of
monetary policy in the U.S. and in other industrialized countries
to slow down the economies enough to have a significant impact on
the inflation rate.''
   On Wednesday, the Commerce Department reported that consumer
spending for the first quarter overall rose at an annual rate of
1.3 percent after adjusting for inflation, down from 3.5 percent in
the last quarter of 1988 and the slowest pace in more than a year.
   J. Antonio Villamil, the department's chief economist, said the
economic pattern of the first quarter _ slower consumer spending
accompanied by increased exports and business investment _ was ``a
desirable one for the sustainability of the economic expansion.''
   The Bush administration is projecting a 2.0 percent increase in
real personal spending this year, down from 3.7 percent in 1988.

   A clerical error caused United Airlines to fail
to follow federal requirements in inspecting the cargo door that
blew off the jumbo jetliner two months later, killing nine people,
the company said today.
   Robert Doll, United vice president for technical services, told
federal investigators Wednesday the airline was unaware it had to
inspect the locking mechanism after the cargo door was repaired
Dec. 23 in Chicago.
   Doll clarified his statement today, saying a partial inspection
was made. Although it was not as thorough as the Federal Aviation
Administration required, company repairmen were satisfied the door
was operating properly, he said.
   Company officials stressed that the Boeing 747 door had been
inspected in November 1988, three months before the accident, and
no problems were found.
   A Boeing Co. engineer testified today that the plane
manufacturer had no idea why on Feb. 24, the door and part of the
fuselage tore off as United Flight 811 was climbing to 23,000 feet
85 miles southwest of Honolulu.
   Boeing engineering manager James Fitzgerald also told the
National Transportation Safety Board the company had made no
projections about the effects of a cargo-door loss.
   ``The doors are not designed to come off the airplane,''
Fitzgerald said. ``We had no way of knowing exactly what would
happen if a door came open in flight.''
   Fitzgerald refused to speculate on how the accident happened.
   He came under extensive questioning from Capt. Douglas Robinson
of the Air Line Pilots Association, who criticized Boeing's
contention that the door is safe in the wake of the United accident
and a 1987 incident when a door partly opened in mid-flight on a
Pan Am flight.
   ``We cannot explain the Pan American incident and we have the
United accident where the door failed, but we steadfastly are
saying the door is safe,'' Robinson said.
   He also noted that the two known failures of 747 cargo doors
both involved forward cargo doors, and advised the company to study
why.
   Fitzgerald also said Boeing is looking at ways to improve the
warning system to ensure the cargo doors are closed before takeoff,
but has not determined what to do or even if changes in the present
systms are necessary.
   Doll's testimony Wednesday came during a day when United
officials were grilled about the operation and maintenance of the
800-pound cargo doors. Speculation has focused on a possible
malfunction in the locking mechanism of the cargo door, which
remains on the bottom of the Pacific.
   The plane was bound for Sydney, Australia, with 337 passengers
and a crew of 18.
   After the Pan Am incident, the FAA proposed new rules requiring
that lock mechanisms of all 747s be visually inspected for signs of
wear by July 31, 1988, said United spokesman Robert Doughty.
   United inspected all 31 of its 747s and found no problems,
Doughty said.
   The FAA also required that aluminum parts of locking mechanisms
be reinforced with steel, which United also began to perform.
   But a clerical error caused the company to miss a third
requirement regarding cargo doors that had been opened and closed
manually because of a problem with the electrical system.
   That requirement was that once those doors were repaired, they
had to be reinspected for damage, Doughty said.
   A clerk who retyped the message from Boeing Co., the aircraft
manufacturer, into United's internal communication system
apparently dropped six key words, Doll told the board.
   The note, with the words that were dropped in parentheses, read:
``The special procedures ... for manual door operation must be
continued and performed prior to takeoff following each operation
of the door until electrical restoration (and operations are
resumed and reinspection) of the lock sectors has been accomplished
... ''
   ``It was a clerical error,'' Doughty said.
   The cargo door of the 747 developed electrical problems during
flights over the Pacific in December 1988, and the door was
operated manually for more than a week before repairs were made in
Chicago, company officials said.
   Doll told investigators he would like to see the door raised
from 17,000 feet of water, but the safety board has made no
decision on that yet.
   Doll also said he is unconvinced the locking machanism was the
culprit because United has had no similar problems.
   He told investigators the 747 did not have a history of unusual
cargo door problems, and that United recorded 112 problems with
forward and aft cargo doors in all of its 747s from March 1986 to
February 1989. Eight of those were on the ill-fated plane, he said.

<HEAD>Committee Passes Budget, Takeshita One Step Closer to Leaving Office</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ERIC TALMADGE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan's governing party broke with tradition,
defied an opposition boycott and rushed the budget through a
parliamentary committee Thursday, indicating Prime Minister Noboru
Takeshita will leave office soon.
   Also on Thursday, an advisory board recommended an overhaul of
political fund-raising regulations to avoid the type of conflict of
interest and influence-peddling charges that destroyed Takeshita's
career.
   A separate panel urged all lawmakers be banned from stock
trading, make public disclosures of their assets and stop
traditional gifts of money at funeral and weddings.
   Under intense political pressure, Takeshita took responsibility
Tuesday for a bribery and influence-peddling scandal and said he
will resign after final passage of the budget.
   That has prompted the governing Liberal Democrats to rush
legislation through Parliament over an opposition boycott and
despite Japan's traditional emphasis on consensus.
   The party-dominated Budget Committee of the lower house rammed
through approval of the budget in one minute Thursday, and party
leaders are expected to push the issue through the full lower house
on Friday.
   That means Takeshita apparently will step down in May. The
budget automatically goes into effect within 30 days of lower house
approval if not rejected by the upper house. The governing Liberal
Democrats have a majority in both houses.
   Opposition party leaders denounced the rushed committee vote as
an act of desperation.
   ``This outrage treads parliamentary democracy under foot and
cannot be forgiven,'' said lawmaker Shun Oide of the Socialist
Party, the leading opposition party.
   The budget action ``is the final act of political hari-kari for
Takeshita,'' said political analyst and author Asao Yamaguchi. ``He
is offering himself as a sacrifice, but this will just increase the
people's distrust of the Liberal Democrats.''
   The opposition has boycotted budget debate, demanding new
parliamentary elections and a broad investigation of the scandal
surrounding the purchase by business and political leaders of
unlisted shares in a subsidiary of the Recruit Co., an information
and publishing conglomerate. The shares soared in value when they
went on the market.
   Prosecutors contend at least some of the stock transactions
amounted to bribery by Recruit to try to influence government
policy. Fourteen bureaucrats and businessmen have been arrested on
bribery and securities law violation charges.
   The company also made huge political donations. Takeshita
acknowledged receiving more than $1 million in donations.
   While a panel of the prime minister recommended new rules on
fund-raising, another panel of members of the private and academic
sectors recommended widespread changes in Japan's big-money
politics, including requiring all legislators to disclose their
assets and stop traditional monetary gifts.
   Only Cabinet members now must divulge their assets. There are no
restrictions on lawmakers or their staff speculating on stocks, and
politicians routinely spend huge sums on wedding and funeral
offerings to their constituents.
   Analysts say Masayoshi Ito, 75, head of the Liberal Democrats'
Executive Council and a former foreign minister, will likely
replace Takeshita and lead a caretaker government.
   Ito told reporters Chief Cabinet Secretary Keizo Obuchi _
Takeshita's main lieutenant _ asked him early Thursday to accept
Takeshita's job.
   Later Thursday, the Japan Broadcasting Corp. reported Ito
received the backing of his party faction, headed by former Finance
Minister Kiichi Miyazawa.
   Ito has insisted he will not accept the post due to a heart
condition caused by diabetes. Many analysts say his public denials
are a facade.
   ``It would be un-Japanese for him to come out and say he'll take
the job,'' said Keiichiro Nakamura, an aide to former Prime
Minister Takeo Miki. Nakamura said Ito will accept once ``the
proper atmosphere has been created.''
   The party was shocked Wednesday by the suicide of a Takeshita
aide who handled the prime minister's political funds. Stock
dealings and a $384,000 loan from Recruit were carried out in the
name of the aide, Ihei Aoki.
   Aoki was among more than a dozen politicians and political aides
who profited from Recruit stock. More than 150 political, business
and media figures purchased such shares.

<TEXT>
   About 20,000 striking workers and
students clashed with riot police in Seoul and seven other cities
Thursday, and dissidents planned weekend demonstrations in defiance
of a government ban.
   About 10,000 striking workers from 12 plants fought police with
rocks and firebombs in the southeastern industrial city of
Changwon, demanding the release of jailed strike leaders.
   In the nearby port of Masan, about 3,000 workers also clashed
with police, demanding pay increases and the release of strike
leaders. Protesters set fire to a governing office and threw rocks
at several police posts.
   About 1,000 students in the southern city of Kwangju clashed
with police after a campus rally at which they burned effigies of
President Bush and President Roh Tae-woo.
   Police officials said two riot troopers had been seriously
injured in Changwon, but they had no further details. It was not
known immediately if there were any workers injured or arrested.
   In Seoul, an estimated 4,500 students hulring rocks and
firebombs battled police at three universities in support of
striking workers and scheduled border talks between students of
South and North Korea.
   About 10,000 students at the state-run Seoul National University
boycotted classes and held an anti-government campus rally,
denouncing alleged government suppression of labor movement.
   ``Down with Roh Tae-woo,'' students shouted, shooting clenched
fists into the sky.
   After the student rally, about 3,000 tried to march into the
streets, hurling rocks and firebombs. Police fired tear gas to
drive them back.
   No injuries or arrests were reported.
   Campus clashes were also reported in Anyang, Chunchon, Chongju
and Taejon.
   Student leaders said they will march to the border village of
Panmunjom Friday for talks with North Korean students on uniting
the Korean peninsula and taking part in an international youth
festival in Pyongyang in July.
   Authorities outlawed the march and said police would block it.
Last year, several marches for unification were blocked by police.
   The United National Democratic Movement, the main dissident
alliance, said they would hold a labor rally Sunday in Seoul
despite a government ban and said police would be responsible for
any violence.
   About 30 labor leaders were arrested in police raids in Seoul
Thursday as the government moved against radical labor groups,
police said. Those arrested face charges of staging illegal
strikes, they said.
   The radical students have been staging almost daily violent
protests in recent weeks to demand the overthrow of the Roh
government. The radicals and allied dissident groups lack
widespread popular support and are not seen as a threat to the Roh
government.
   But government leaders are concerned about growing labor unrest
and a wave of increasingly violent strikes for better pay and
improved working conditions. Student and dissident groups are
attempting to unite with workers to build an anti-government
alliance.
   Dissident leaders claim Roh is a front for military rule and
demand the former general step down. Roh won a December 1987
election after rival opposition candidates split the opposition
vote.

<TEXT>
   The Navy has arrived to help in an assault
on gummed-up beaches and bays, more than doubling cleanup efforts
five weeks after the nation's worst oil spill fouled Prince William
Sound.
   After loading workers and supplies in Valdez, the USS Juneau was
anchored today near Smith Island as part of Exxon's state-guided
effort to clean rocky beaches where seals and sea lions have their
pups.
   ``The Juneau allows us to accelerate the pace of the cleanup.
That's key,'' said Exxon spokesman Joe Tucker.
   The top state environmental official today disputed Exxon's
estimate of how the cleanup is going, saying more study was needed
before concluding that just 10 percent of the oil remained
unaccounted-for. Exxon had stated that 17 percent of the spilled
oil had been recovered and 73 percent has dissipated.
   ``It's important for our credibility we want to make sure we
take all the steps necessary to make an assessment, even if Exxon
is willing to go out on a limb and provide you with figures that
may be both gross and inaccurate,'' Alaska's environmental
commissioner Dennis Kelso said.
   The state also revised its estimate of the total amount of oil
spilled downward, to 10.9 million gallons from 11.2 million
gallons. Exxon's estimate of the oil spill remains 10.1 million
gallons.
   The arrival of the Juneau could spell good news for marine
mammals in the sound, where the most heavily oiled beaches are.
   ``The ship carries nine landing craft,'' Tucker said of the
Juneau. ``Each will be equipped by Exxon with pumps and heaters,
enabling the company to transport crews to work areas more quickly.
The crew will just stay out there.''
   The landing transport is carrying 400 workers who were to get
off each morning and return to sleep at night. About 250 workers
who had been cleaning Eleanor Island today moved to Green Island.
Most of them sleep on barges nearby.
   After three days of 15-to-20-foot seas and gale-force winds
whipping snow in some areas, skimmers returned to work Wednesday in
the sound and the Gulf of Alaska. Today's forecast called for light
rain and wind, and seas of three feet.
   Confirmed reports have placed the oil at Cape Douglas on the
Alaska Peninsula, 275 miles west of where the Exxon Valdez ran
aground on Bligh Reef on March 24 in a picturesque area rich in
marine life.
   Neither Exxon, which conducts daily overflights of the area, nor
the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration could confirm a
report by a National Park Service officer that oil was spotted 100
miles south of Cape Douglas at Kashvik Bay on the Alaska Peninsula.
   The spreading oil sheen has crept into energy politics as well
as the coves that make up Kenai Fjords National Park 100 miles
south of Anchorage.
   A letter to the House Interior Committee released Wednesday by
Gov. Steve Cowper urged Congress to buy back oil exploration leases
sold for Bristol Bay, an area Cowper said produces $1 billion a
year in seafood.
   ``Alaskans already have had to face the closure of this year's
multimillion-dollar Prince William Sound herring fishery and black
cod fishery, and the attendant loss of jobs and community
stability,'' Cowper wrote.
   ``The spector of such an event in Bristol Bay is unthinkable,''
Cowper said. ``It is time to cancel the sale and refund the bid
money.''
   But President Bush, speaking in Austin to a joint session of the
Texas Legislature, warned that the nation must not retreat from oil
exploration because of the spill.
   ``We are using federal resources intelligently in the cleanup
effort,'' he said. ``We are working with industry to develop an
improved plan in the event of a future spill.
   ``But shutting down our domestic energy production is no answer,
and would merely increase our dependence on foreign oil,'' Bush
said. To avoid that, ``we must return to high levels of exploratory
drilling.''
   While some wildlife has moved out of oiled areas, bald eagles
and other scavengers have been drawn to it, said Walt Steiglitz,
regional director for the U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service.
   Steiglitz said in a news release that eagles and gulls that have
moved in to feed on the carrion will become ``secondary victims of
the oil by contamination through the food chain.'' Four eagles have
been reported dead.

<HEAD>Watkins Discloses New Delay In Restart Of Weapons Reactors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Energy Secretary James D. Watkins said
Thursday he has moved back the timetable for resuming production of
a scarce gas needed to make nuclear warheads. He assured Congress
the delay would not weaken the national defense.
   Watkins said he hoped to restart production at the Savannah
River reactors, near Aiken, S.C., early in 1990. The three
reactors, which have been plagued by safety and technical flaws,
are the nation's only source of tritium, a perishable, radioactive
gas that boosts the explosive power of warheads.
   More retraining of reactor operators and a fuller assessment of
other safety issues are needed before the plant can be allowed to
resume operation, Watkins said.
   ``Because of the attention I'm giving to safety, health and the
environment, ... I have said unequivocally I will not allow them to
be started this year'' as previously planned, Watkins told
reporters at a meeting in his office.
   Shortly after the reactors were shut down for safety reasons
last summer, the department said it could have them running again
by late 1988. After that target was missed, the department told
Congress it expected startup by late this year.
   Watkins also disclosed in a meeting with reporters that he
planned to announce a ``new approach'' to the Energy Department's
controversial effort to build the nation's first permanent
repository for high-level nuclear wastes in Nevada.
   He said residents of the state may have been justified in
feeling ``they had a waste dump jammed down their throats'' by
federal officials who paid too little attention to local opinion.
The $30 billion Yucca Mountain repository is officially scheduled
to open in 2003, although Watkins' planned changes could put that
date in doubt.
   The Energy Department, which builds and tests nuclear weapons
for the Pentagon, has been able to continue warhead production
because it has a reserve of tritium.
   The size of the tritium stockpile is classified, but the
department told Congress earlier this year that supplies would be
sqeezed if the Savannah River reactors were not operating by the
end of this year.
   Many private groups that monitor the government weapons program
have expressed doubt that tritium supplies are as tight as
suggested by the Energy Department.
   ``The initial suggestion that we faced a national security
emergency is absurd,'' said Frances Close Hart, chairman of the
Energy Research Foundation, a Columbia, S.C.-based environmental
group that wants the Savannah River reactors closed permanently.
She said Watkins' new timetable for the reactors was overly
optimistic.
   ``I don't believe they will be able to restart them even by
early 1990,'' she said.
   In a letter sent Thursday to the chairmen of the House and
Senate armed services committees, Watkins said he believed the
reactors could be safely restarted ``early enough in 1990 to
maintain a viable weapons stockpile.'' He said he had told Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney of the delayed startup on Monday.
   In his comments to reporters, Watkins said the department and
its Savannah River field office face a tough test in getting the
reactors started in time to meet tritium needs.
   ``The race will be a close race, but it can be done,'' he said.
   Watkins said he was moving ahead with a broad strategy for
weeding out safety, technical and managerial problems at the
Savannah River reactors. He said this was central to his overall
plan for restoring the credibility of nuclear power.
   ``I see in Savannah River an opportunity to make it the flagship
of the Department of Energy, rather than the butt of criticism,''
he said.
   Watkins will go to the Savannah River plant Friday in his first
visit to the department's nuclear weapons production network, which
includes 16 major plants in 12 states. He said he wanted to ``boost
the troops' morale,'' damaged by months of critical reports about
the safety and efficiency of plant operations.

<HEAD>Texas' 300 Inmate Death Row Now Nation's Largest</HEAD>

<DATELINE>HUNTSVILLE, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When a barred door slammed shut behind
convicted killer Martin Vega on the steamy row of identical cells
known simply as J-23, Texas's death row became the largest in the
nation.
   Vega, whose white prison suit bears an orange tag with his name
and the number ``DR 932,'' is the 300th person on death row in
Texas, according to Department of Corrections statistics this week.
   Florida, which in recent years has held the largest number of
convicted killers awaiting execution, this week has 299 death row
inmates, according to Paula Tully of the Florida Department of
Corrections.
   ``It's a pretty good indication that the people of Texas support
the death penalty if they keep sending people there,'' said Ron
Dusek, a spokesman for Texas Attorney General Jim Mattox.
   Texas also leads the nation in the number of people put to death
since the U.S. Supreme Court in 1976 allowed capital punishment to
resume. Thirty men have been given lethal injection at the Walls
Unit in Huntsville, starting with Charlie Brooks in December 1982.
   By that time, Texas had 130 others awaiting the same fate as
Brooks.
   During the early 1980s, death row grew by about two per month.
As the pace of executions quickened, so did the number of people
awaiting death. In 1986, 43 new inmates joined the ranks while 10
were executed. An additional 36 came the next year, and the
three-per-month average continues now.
   But while death row in Texas has grown _ it now incorporates
five prison wings _ the number of executions has fallen. Only three
were put to death last year and just one so far in 1989 as inmates'
attorneys have won Supreme Court review of cases.
   ``The way it's growing, they can dedicate half the farm to death
row in the next five years, unless they do away with the death
penalty,'' says Jim Beathard, awaiting execution for a killing
spree in which three members of a family died in 1984.
   Jim Vanderbilt, who has been on the row since 1976 and is among
the most senior of all inmates, fears a legal breakthrough will
trigger many executions.
   ``The water is building up behind the dam,'' Vanderbilt says.
``And if they let the dam overflow or if they remove the dam, then
there's going to be a flood.''
   For Vega, 42, a self-described jack-of-all-trades who was
convcted in February of the 1985 slaying of his wife's former
husband, in what authorities said was an attempt to collect the
man's insurance, the move to death row was his fourth trip to the
Texas prison system. Included among his terms was a two-year stint
for robbery which kept him behind bars for just one week before he
was released.
   Death row, he says, is different.
   ``It's a title we have and under that title we're supposed to be
dangerous,'' he said in an interview this week. ``But Lord knows a
lot of people here are not dangerous. I'm not saying all _ but
some.''
   Vega, from Luling, says he misses ``freedom, my family, women,
money, breathing the fresh air and just being able to raise my
hands and say `I'm free!'''
   But the Texas prison system, mandated by federal court orders
this decade to improve prison conditions and inmate rights, is a
much better place now, Vega says.
   One prison beating in the old days left him with a severed
tendon that has left the little finger of his left hand immobile.
   ``Most officials I have encountered have been nice so far,'' he
says. ``If you have a question, they will answer. Since the time
I've been back here, TDC has not bothered me at all. It's good.''

<HEAD>Congressional Investigator Says EPA Officials Weakened Draft Report</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Environmental Protection Agency officials
weakened a task force's draft report that had presented a ``damning
picture'' of the agency's program to protect groundwater from
chemical contamination, a congressional investigator said Thursday.
   The diluted final report minimized EPA's troubles in monitoring
leakage from hazardous waste dumps, said Richard L. Hembra,
director of the environmental protection section of the General
Accounting Office. GAO is an investigating arm of Congress.
   A separate ``Superfund'' program is for cleanup of abandoned
disposal sites, sometimes in cases where responsible parties cannot
be located. Hembra said the problem involving leaks from hazardous
waste dumps into groundwater supplies ``could be as big'' as the
waste problem which Superfund handles.
   In testimony before the House Energy and Commerce Committee's
investigations subcommittee, Hembra and Kathie A. Stein, an
attorney with the Environmental Defense Fund, a private,
pro-environmental advocacy group, criticized changes made by EPA
officials in the draft report.
   Hembra said an accurate picture of the groundwater monitoring
and protection program is crucial because ``over 70 percent of the
facilities are leaking'' and ``about one-half the nation's
population depends on groundwater for drinking water.''
   Hazardous waste disposal facilities are licensed to operate by
EPA under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. That law
controls operation and closure of the sites and requires operators
to clean up spills at their expense.
   EPA issued its final report last October on groundwater
monitoring at 58 of the nation's 1,447 hazardous waste disposal
facilities studied by its own task force. The GAO studied 50 sites.
   A comparison of the October report and the staff task force
draft in September 1987 showed that some of the hardest-hitting
staff criticism of the enforcement program was deleted. Other
conclusions were softened.
   Hembra said while ``a lot of what you see in the way of changes
was moving away from emotion-laden language,'' other deletions
presented ``a pretty damning picture of the program.''
   Ms. Stein said ``some of the best technical talent at EPA
sounded an alert'' about the monitoring program, but ``it doesn't
seem like EPA answered the call.''
   ``Somewhere, as it moves up through the agency, the findings
seem to disappear,'' said Rep. Ron Wyden, D-Ore. ``The final
version of the task force report deleted the finding that most
facilities are leaking.''
   One deletion was a task force conclusion that enforcement of
groundwater monitoring was so poor that EPA and state officials
``potentially compromise the level of protection provided to the
public and the environment.''
   Jonathan Z. Cannon, acting assistant EPA administrator for solid
waste and emergency response, said officials who have left the
agency were responsible for the changes. He asked the committee to
recognize that new officials are now in charge of the monitoring
program. He said EPA has ``made progress'' but has ``a long way to
go.''
   The September 1987 staff report said each of the facilities it
investigated had ``significant deficiencies with their ...
detection monitoring systems.'' That conclusion was omitted from
the final report.
   The earlier report said the task force found ``that while most
facilities were found to have groundwater contamination, very few
have any active groundwater cleanup program in progress and none of
these programs meet (the law's) standards.''
   The final report left out that ``most facilities'' contaminated
nearby groundwater and said: ``With respect to corrective action,
the task force found that of those facilities that had groundwater
contamination, few had active groundwater cleanup programs in
progress.''
   A staff report conclusion, deleted in the final version, said
EPA enforcement personnel and managers ``do not elicit, cannot
understand, or sometimes do not heed, recommendations from
qualified technical personnel, which would improve the level of
compliance and quality of actions.''
   The draft said that ``none'' of the facilities investigated has
characterized the extent of its contamination as required by law.
The final version deleted the ``none,'' and said, ``The task force
found ... that inadequate groundwater monitoring efforts at many
sites often resulted in unsatisfactory ..~hy

   More than 100 anti-abortion demonstrators
were arrested Thursday after linking arms to block the doors at the
Women's Health Center, police said.
   ``They had a crowd of 250 to 350 people, and they effectively
barricaded the entrance to the women's clinic,'' police Sgt. Chuck
Smith said. The demonstration came a day after the U.S. Supreme
Court heard arguments in a case that could limit abortions.
   One man suffered arm and facial abrasions when he slipped from
the grasp of police officers who picked him up to remove him. Most
of those arrested were released soon afterward, but some refused to
identify themselves and were kept in custody.
   The clinic reopened by noon.
   ``Some of our patients were delayed in getting inside the
clinic, but they've all be taken care of now,'' clinic
administrator Carolyn Maxwell said.
   The protest was organized by a local group called Christians
Against Abortion. It is affiliated with Operation Rescue, a group
that has staged similar demonstrations across the nation.

   Five astronauts tracked a perfect
countdown Thursday as technicians prepared the shuttle Atlantis for
a midafternoon launch on Friday. The mission will propel NASA's
``Magellan'' probe to Venus and revive America's deep-space science
program.
   ``After an 11-year gap in the planetary program, we're anxious
to get started,'' said John H. Gerpheide, Magellan project manager.
   Officials described the countdown as the smoothest of four since
the Challenger disaster. The chance of high winds provided slight
concern as NASA looked forward to liftoff in an unusually tight
launch window that opens at 2:24 p.m. EDT and lasts justs 23
minutes.
   Magellan, ready for its 15-month flight to Venus, ``is 100
percent healthy and ticking along,'' said Lennard Fisk, NASA's
chief scientist. ``We're ready to go fly,'' said Richard Truly, who
heads the shuttle program and is the incoming NASA administrator.
   Earlier Thursday, three Soviet cosmonauts returned to Earth,
leaving the Mir space station unattended for the first time in more
than two years. Two of the cosmonauts had been in space for five
months, the other for eight months.
   Atlantis' cargo is the Magellan spacecraft which has a radar
system powerful enough to pierce the dense sulfuric acid clouds of
Venus and map its surface. The mission costs $550 million, not
including the $225 million cost of the four-day shuttle flight.
   Magellan's radar images, relayed to Earth and enhanced by
computer, should reveal details as small as 100 yards across, about
the size of a football field. That is 10 times sharper than
previous pictures of the planet.
   Stephen Saunders, Magellan project scientist, said the radar
images could help scientists understand how Venus was formed and
might provide an answer to the puzzling question of how Earth and
Venus evolved so differently even though they were almost identical
when the solar system formed 4.6 billion years ago.
   The Magellan deployment is scheduled 6 hours 18 minutes after
liftoff, with astronauts Mark Lee and Mary Cleave conducting a
countdown from inside their shuttle cabin. An hour after the
release, a rocket is to fire to hurl the 7,600-pound unmanned probe
on a 450-day journey to Venus, a complex trip that takes Magellan
one and one-half times around the sun before it intercepts its
target planet.
   The Atlantis crew also includes commander David Walker, pilot
Ronald Grabe and mission specialist Norman Thagard. Lee is the only
one who has not flown on a previous shuttle mission.
   Spending cutbacks and delays forced by the 1986 Challenger
accident prompted NASA to use the roundabout approach to Venus. The
trip could have been made in four months under better circumstances.
   The first American planetary mission since 1978 will mark the
beginning of a busy year for NASA's planetary program. ``In August
the Voyager spacecraft will fly by Neptune and in October we'll
launch Galileo (from the shuttle) to Jupiter,'' Gerpheide said.
   At a briefing for reporters Thursday, NASA's Fisk vowed, ``No
one is going to question our leadership in planetary (flight)
again.''
   The Atlantis countdown began Tuesday and was progressing so
smoothly Thursday that the launch team had time to relax during a
15-hour halt of the clock. The time had been set aside for catchup
work.
   ``We just don't have anything out there that we're worried
about; it's been a real smooth count and we expect it to continue
that way,'' said countdown director Ron Phelps.
   Weather officers said they were keeping one eye on scattered
clouds which were moving into the skies above Moron, Spain, where
an airbase serves as an emergency landing site in the event of a
problem after launch.
   The astronauts were briefed throughout the day on the status of
the countdown and reviewed their flight plans. They were to retire
early Friday, arising about 9 a.m. to prepare for the afternoon
launch. Only five of the 28 earlier shuttle flights took off after
noon.
   Magellan is to orbit the cloud-veiled planet and map up to 90
percent of the surface during 243 Earth days, equal to one Venusian
day.
   Low resolution pictures obtained by earlier spacecraft hint at
Earth-like mountain ranges and rolling plains, but the surface
temperature on Venus is 900 degrees and the atmospheric pressure is
90 times that of Earth's.
   The last planetary mission launched by the United States was the
1978 Pioneer-Venus probe. Voyager 2, launched in 1977, will take
the first closeup look at Neptune in August after earlier exploring
Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus.
   Other major science projects planned in the next three years are
the launch of the Hubble Space Telescope from a shuttle early next
year, the Ulysses probe to study the sun in October, 1990, and the
Mars Observer spacecraft in 1992.

   A tornado swept through central
Bangladesh, killing 600 people and injuring 12,000 others as it
flattened buildings and tossed fishing boats, government officials
said Thursday. At least 200 people were missing.
   Wednesday evening's storm, which also unleashed hail and heavy
rain, struck hours after President Hussain Muhammad Ershad led
nationwide prayers for an end to a drought that has been tormenting
Bangladesh.
   Survivors said the funnel cloud raged for 10 minutes at dusk
Wednesday in the Manikganj area 25 miles northwest of Dhaka, and
tore down ``everything, including buildings.''
   The twister capsized several fishing boats, raising fears that
many of the 200 missing may have been killed.
   ``I saw black clouds gathering in the sky. In moments we found
we were flying along with the house,'' said Sayeda Begum, a
30-year-old housewife in the village of Saturia, near Manikganj.
   The government official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
confirmed the toll of 600 dead. A government doctor from the area
said at least 12,000 people were injured.
   Troops on Thursday searched wrecked villages for survivors. In
Saturia, a village of 10,000 people, nothing was standing for about
one square mile.
   Sayeda said she and her husband and four children were lifted
through the air by the storm. Her 5-year-old son was found two
miles away, suffering from bad bruises, she said. All of them
suffered injuries.
   In the neighboring village of Nandeshwari, none of the 120
houses was left standing.
   Tofael Ahmed, a teacher, wept bitterly as he held a torn shirt
that had been worn by his son, Sonal, hours earlier. Sonal and his
sister, Sufia Beagum, were among the missing.
   ``What shall I do with this shirt? Why Allah should curse me
like this!'' he cried.
   Another tornado hit Narsingdi district, about 25 miles east of
Dhaka, killing five people and injuring 500 others, news reports
said.
   The New Nation newspaper said about 200,000 people were affected
by the tornadoes as thousands of mud-and-straw houses were swept
away. Most of the survivors have no shelter and camped in fields
under fresh rains Thursday.
   Relief Minister Sirajul Hoosain Khan said the government had
rushed food and medicine to the survivors and was setting up
makeshift camps.
   The Health Ministry appealed for blood donations, and Ershad
flew to the affected areas in Manikganj and Narsingdi.
   Before the storms, more than 75,000 people joined Ershad in a
service at the national prayer ground in Dhaka to pray for rain.
   Two months of drought had threatened to destroy more than half
the rice crop in this poverty-stricken nation.
   Bangladesh, one of the world's poorest countries with a per
capita annual income of $160, alternates between flood and drought.
Agriculture is the main occupation of most of its 110 million
people.

<HEAD>Hair Today, Gone Tomorrow? To Shave or Not to Shave, That's the Question</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   To shave, or not to shave? For bearded
politicians facing an election fight, that's the question.
   Either way, they say, it's risky business.
   Conservative Rep. Robert K. Dornan, R-Calif., sprouted flaming
red chin whiskers last year but shaved them off for the November
election. He easily won a sixth House term.
   But when liberal former Rep. Mike Lowry, D-Wash., shaved off his
``Yasser Arafat look-alike'' beard last fall in his bid for a
Senate seat, he lost.
   Another GOP conservative from California, freshman Rep. Dana
Rohrabacher, ignored his media experts' advice and refused to shave
his beard. The voters elected him anyway.
   ``I got letters, mostly from older people, saying, `I like your
ideas but you look like a tramp,''' said Rohrabacher, who had
written speeches for then-President Reagan. ``But I figure I gained
much more support by keeping my beard. It helped me stand out from
the eight other primary candidates, who all looked alike.''
   Rohrabacher is one of only five remaining members of the House
Beard Caucus, an informal group that convened one morning this week
in the House barber shop to celebrate their hairy individualism.
   The group's sole purpose is ``to allow members to fraternize
about the politics of having hair on your face,'' said Rep. David
E. Bonior, D-Mich., the caucus chairman.
   The other members are Reps. Mickey Leland, D-Texas; Ron Dellums,
D-Calif., and Floyd Flake, D-N.Y. The numbers are shrinking, down
from about a dozen last year. There are no beards in the Senate.
   One of the caucus' clean-shaven defectors, Rep. Gary Ackerman,
D-N.Y., is scornful of the ``wimps'' who shave before an election,
or wait until they've won to grow a beard.
   Ackerman got rid of his 17-year-old goatee only after the
election, he says proudly.
   ``I just got tired of reading in the newspapers that I won by a
whisker or had a close shave in the last election,'' he said.
   Ackerman has no intention of growing a new beard _ ``I feel
almost like a virgin, as though I've captured my long-lost youth,''
he says _ but smooth-chinned Rep. Dennis Eckart, D-Ohio, says he
will grow another.
   Shaving, says Eckart, ``is my way of splurging, my little way of
rewarding myself after an election.'' Moreover, ``I've discovered
that the humidity of Washington is the greatest inducement to
shaving known to mankind,'' he said.
   Eckart says shaving off a beard before an election campaign is
hazardous.
   ``Many members now have to resort to an expensive media campaign
that features them with one look,'' he said. ``As I discovered,
when folks get used to seeing you one way, and then see you a few
weeks later looking another way, it draws instant criticism.''
   Rep. Sam Gejdenson, D-Conn., now clean-shaven, says he grows a
beard ``every time I take a couple of days off'' and always gets
complaints from constituents.
   ``I've gotten more nasty mail over my beard than over any other
issue since I've been in Congress,'' he says. Nonetheless,
Gejdenson plans to grow his back.
   Bonior, who is chief deputy whip for House Democrats, says he
shaved his beard briefly last Christmas because his family hadn't

   ``They didn't like what they saw, so I grew it back,'' he said.

   Israeli soldiers shot and
killed three Palestinians and wounded 74 others in widespread
clashes Thursday in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, Arab
reports and hospital officials said.
   The army reported only eight woundings and accused Palestinians
of inflating the figure to gain sympathy.
   The gunshot wounds reported by Palestinian hospitals brought to
more than 225 the number reported injured in clashes with soldiers
this week. The army has confirmed only 22.
   In the West Bank, more than 100 teen-agers from Jewish
settlements hiked near the Palestinian village of Beita, where an
Israeli girl was killed a year ago, to symbolize their demand that
the occupied lands be part of Israel.
   ``It's our country. We must walk here,'' said 16-year-old Biti
Shaovitz from the settlement of Karnei Shomrom.
   Soldiers and armed settler leaders guarded the hikers. Under an
agreement with the army, they did not enter Beita, where
15-year-old Terza Porat was accidentally killed by a Jewish
bodyguard a year ago when a group of hikers got involved in a
confrontation with stone-throwing Arabs.
   Before Thursday's hike, soldiers raided the village to search
for Palestinian activists. Two youths were wounded by army gunfire,
a military spokesman said. Arab reports said five were wounded.
   The army's deputy spokesman, Col. Renaan Gissin, said, ``The
reason you see a greater number of wounded is because of a
deliberate attempt by Palestinians to overload the list.''
   ``There is no dramatic increase in the number of wounded,'' he
said.
   The wounded figures from hospitals include people who are
treated for gunshot wounds, then released. The army says it does
not include these since it cannot verify if they were shot by
soldiers or fellow Palestinians.
   ``This makes it easy for the Palestinians to inflate the
figures,'' said Gissin.
   He added the army also cannot confirm gunshot victims who go to
private hospitals or clinics, only those treated in government
hospitals.
   Of the 74 reported treated in five Arab hospitals on Thursday,
the army confirmed 11 Palestinians wounded, eight from the West
Bank and three from Gaza.
   An official at the U.N. Relief and Works Agency, which is
responsible for Palestinians refugees, said he had reports of 30
gunshot wounds by midafternoon in Gaza and was still receiving
reports. He spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Of the 154 reported wounded earlier in the week, the army
confirmed 14.
   The army reported that soldiers Thursday ran into a violent
protest in the Askar refugee camp near the West Bank town of Nablus
and opened fire, killing one Palestinian.
   The victim, Imad Muhammad Harbieh, 20, was shot in the chest,
hospital officials said.
   In the Gaza Strip, Ali Said Gharableh, 30, died of a gunshot
wound to the chest in a clash with soldiers after Moslem prayers at
a mosque in Gaza City, hospital officials said.
   Also in Gaza, 15-year-old Ashraf Samir Ead was shot in the chest
in a protest in the town of Rafah and died en route to the
hospital, Arab reporters said.
   The army was checking the reports of the deaths in Gaza.
   Thursday's deaths raised to 454 the number of Arabs reported
killed in the revolt, which began in December 1988. Eighteen
Israelis have died.
   On Thursday, the PLO-backed leadership of the uprising issued a
leaflet rejecting plans by Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir to hold
elections in the occupied lands. The leaflet said the plan was
attempt to divide the Palestinians and circumvent the PLO.
   An aide to Shamir said Israel will not offer an alternative to
Shamir's election proposal, despite the rejection of the plan.
   On Wednesday, 83 prominent residents in the occupied lands
rejected the idea, calling the elections a ploy to end the uprising
without giving the Palestinians what they want: an independent
state.
   ``This is the best program we can suggest to them,'' said Shamir
spokesman Yossi Ahimeir.
   Shamir's plan calls for elections of local Palestinians to
negotiate an interim peace with Israel, to be followed by talks on
the final status of the occupied lands.
   Shamir, who has repeatedly rejected the Palestinians' demands
for their own state and talks with the PLO, said on Israel army
radio: ``We have heard an announcement from some of our neighbors
that they reject our proposals. I hope this is not their last
word.''
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin told Israel Radio if Palestinians
turn down the peace proposal, Israel must adopt a policy ``of a
more intense action of putting down first of all the violence.''
   This, he said, ``will bring about, between half a year to a
year, acceptance of the political way by elements in the Arab world
and, first and foremost, in the territories.''

<HEAD>Shanghai Jews Return To Their Roots</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Passover, the Jewish holiday of exodus, was a
festival of return this year for a group of Jews who lived in
Shanghai more than four decades ago.
   ``It was symbolic of the return of a Jewish presence to China''
said Yosef Tekoah, Israel's former ambassador to the United
Nations, said of the Passover seder celebrated this year in China's
largest city.
   Tekoah, as honorary chairman of the International Assembly of
Jews in China, last week led 25 Shanghai Jews or their descendants
back to the city that offered thousands of Jews refuge from
persecution in the first half of this century.
   The tour, which included 50 others from the United States,
Israel and other countries, also provided new impetus to growing
contacts between China and Israel, which have no diplomatic
relations.
   For most on the trip, nostalgia took precedence over politics.
Tekoah, chancellor of Ben Gurion University of the Negev, recited
the Kaddish, or prayer for the dead, at the synagogue, now a law
college auditorium, where he prayed with his parents as a boy.
   Sasson Jacoby, foreign editor of the Jerusalem Post, returned to
the house where he spent his childhood. He also found his old
synagogue, now a Shanghai government education bureau office.
   ``Nothing has changed. They haven't even repainted the
interior,'' he said. The Red Guard, the young leftists who
destroyed houses of worship throughout China during the 1966-76
Cultural Revolution, apparently failed to discover the Hebrew
inscriptions now hidden behind a movie screen.
   The group also found several former Jewish cultural centers. At
one, they ran into a Chinese wedding in what is now a public hall.
   ``Most of it remains as we remember it,'' Tekoah said, adding
that while the homes in the old foreign quarters are run down,
today's Shanghai is vibrant with activity. Gone are the downtrodden
masses of beggars, rickshaw drivers and the desperately poor.
   The Shanghai Jewish community dates back at least to the 19th
century when Jacoby's ancestors arrived from Baghdad.
   The Iraqi Jewish community, numbering about 1,000, included
families such as the Sassoons and Kadoories who were to become rich
in the China trade. The Sassoon family in 1921 helped build their
synagogue, and Jacoby's father was once the temple's rabbi.
   The next wave, including Tekoah's family, were refugees from the
Bolshevik Revolution. Many of the 8,000 Russian Jews first stopped
in Harbin and other northeastern China cities.
   The third and largest group was German and other central
European Jews escaping Nazi persecution before and during World War
II. From 20,000 to 25,000 eventually made their way to Shanghai,
Tekoah said.
   ``China occupies a very special place,'' Tekoah said. ``It is
the only country in the entire world that didn't know what
anti-Semitism is. The Chinese people by their nature are very
tolerant, and Jewish people have benefited from that.''
   Tekoah said that in his speech at the Passover seder, he spoke
of parallels between two of the world's oldest cultures. Both value
scholarship and the family, he said, and both are very pragmatic in
their approaches to life.
   Jewish traders are believed to have settled in China even before
the beginning of the Christian era, but the first permanent Jewish
community was probably established in the 11th century in Kaifeng,
in central China.
   The Kaifeng Jews, who may have arrived by way of India,
flourished until the 19th century when they assimilated with the
Chinese and their customs and rituals gradually disappeared.
   During their Shanghai visit, the tour met with the Shanghai
Judaic Studies Association, a group of Chinese scholars formed
several months ago to study the heritage of Judaism in Kaifeng and
other Chinese cities.
   ``They want to be in touch with Jewish organizations in
Israel,'' Tekoah said. He said the forming of such a group, and the
warm reception they received in Shanghai, were indications of
increased contacts between Israel and China, long a firm supporter
of Arab causes.
   ``As Mao Tse-tung said, a 1,000-mile journey begins with a
single step.''
   The Jewish community in Shanghai dissolved in 1948 and 1949 with
the communist takeover and the creation of the Jewish state in
Israel. But now, Tekoah said, the links have been restored. ``For
each one of us this was a very moving return to our roots.''

<HEAD>Guerrillas Attack Kabul on Anniversary of Communist Coup</HEAD>

<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Moslem guerrillas bombarded Kabul with
rocket fire Thursday, the 11th anniversary of the communist coup,
and officials said at least six people were killed and four were
injured.
   The military fired back with long-range missiles into the
surrounding mountains where the insurgents are hiding.
   The guerrillas issued a statment from their Peshawar, Pakistan,
headquarters describing the 1978 revolution as ``the beginning of
more than a decade-long nightmare.''
   Iran's Islamic Republic News Agency said Iran-based guerrillas
and Afghan refugees marched in Tehran to protest the communist coup.
   Hundreds of Afghan refugees in New Delhi also marched and burned
an effigy of Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, whose
government backs the Afghan leadership.
   ``Long live Afghanistan! Down with Russia! Down with
communism!'' they shouted while marching near Parliament.
   In a speech to diplomats and visiting delegations, President
Najib said the army has proved it can defend Afghanistan without
the help of Soviet troops, who completed their withdrawal from the
country Feb. 15.
   ``The enemies had set a deadline of two or three weeks after the
withdrawal for occupying Kabul,'' Najib said. ``You can see that
... the armed forces have created an unsurmountable barrier before
the aggressors.''
   As he spoke to 1,500 people at the presidential palace, rockets
and explosions could be heard outside.
   Fifteen rockets hit Kabul starting at sunrise.
   One landed in the central square, where a day earlier the
government celebrated the anniversary with a military parade. The
parade was held a day before the actual anniversary because of
fears of attacks.
   There had been speculation for weeks the guerrillas would send a
volley of rockets into the city of 2.25 million people Thursday.
   The dead included two soldiers and a member of the local
security forces. One rocket killed two women, injured two children
and a man, and destroyed three mud-and-stone houses, military
officials said.
   About half a mile away, another woman died and a child had his
legs blown off when a rocket slammed into their house, the
officials said on condition of anonymity.
   This year's observance of the Saur, or April revolution, was
subdued. Most businesses closed and there were few people or
vehicles in the streets, which were lined with the black, red and
green Afghan flag, and the red flag of the ruling People's
Democratic Party.
   The Moslem insurgency began after the coup that ousted President
Mohammed Daoud on April 27, 1978. More than 1 million people have
died in the fighting and 5 million Afghans _ about one-third of the
country's population _ fled to neighboring Pakistan and Iran.
   Soviet military forces entered Afghanistan in December 1979,
replaced one communist government with another and stayed to help
fight the insurgents, known as mujahedeen or Islamic holy warriors.
   Najib became president in May 1986. On May 15, 1988, the Red
Army began leaving Afghanistan under a U.N.-sponsored accord.

   Oliver North's lawyers and a civil liberties
group are joining 10 news organizations in seeking release of a
sealed document described to North's trial jury by his principal
lawyer.
   The news organizations, including The Associated Press, are
battling the Justice Department in the U.S. Court of Appeals in an
attempt to gain access to the stipulation, which has been given to
the jury.
   The document summarizes intelligence intercepts concerning a
CIA-assisted arms shipment from Israel to Iran in the early stages
of the Iran-Conta affair.
   The news organizations are seeking a speedy hearing on their
request, saying that North's lawyers were free to disclose ``the
entire stipulation on the public record'' during final arguments in
his criminal trial. North lawyer Brendan Sullivan described what
the document shows in open court on April 19, but the Justice
Department says full disclosure ``would threaten national
security.''
   The stipulation describes U.S. government tracking of the
November 1985 shipment of Hawk missiles to Iran.
   U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell on Saturday rejected the
motion of the news organizations to gain access to the stipulation,
saying it ``is a classified document.'' The organizations went to
the appeals court Monday.
   The Justice Department now wants the matter sent back to
district court to give the government an opportunity to spell out
in secret to the judge why the press should be denied access.
Alternatively, the department wants 14 days to file a brief in the
appeals court.
   On Thursday, the news organizations opposed both government
requests, saying the case should remain in the appeals court and
that briefs should be filed by next Tuesday.
   The American Civil Liberties Union supports the news media's
request for an expedited hearing on the request for public
disclosure.
   ``The government has made no attempt here to show any compelling
interest for sealing an exhibit which has been shown to the jury
and partially read in open court,'' stated the motion by ACLU
lawyer Kate Martin.
   North's lawyers say nondisclosure of an exhibit at a criminal
trial is incompatible with the Sixth Amendment guarantee of a
public trial and with the Classified Information Procedures Act.
CIPA makes no provision for partial release of a trial exhibit to
jurors but not to the public, said North's lawyers.
   Court security officers deleted portions of Sullivan's courtroom
comments on the intercepts from the official court transcript, but
Gesell ruled that they must be restored.
   One deleted passage said that employing certain
intelligence-gathering methods allowed North to know ``exactly what
was going on in the Iranian initiative and exactly what was
happening with respect to the transfer of missiles to Iran.''
Another deleted passage said the intercepts were delivered to
high-ranking government officials, including CIA Director William
Casey and Deputy National Security Adviser John Poindexter.

   The prices Americans paid for imported goods
rose 1.7 percent in the first quarter, largely reflecting a surge
in the cost of crude oil from abroad, the government reported
Thursday.
   The first-quarter price increase, down slightly from a 2 percent
pace in the final three months of 1988, would represent a 7 percent
annual inflation rate if sustained for a full year, the Labor
Department said.
   On the export side, meanwhile, prices for U.S. goods sold
overseas rose 1.4 percent in the last quarter after declining 0.3
percent in the preceding three months. The increase, which
reflected higher prices for exports of food, fuels and crude
materials, would translate into a 5.7 percent annual inflation rate.
   The quarterly figures are not adjusted to remove seasonal
factors.
   Economist Nigel Gault of Data Resources Inc. in Lexington,
Mass., said the price increases for both exports and imports were
``consistent with the fact that the industrialized nations as a
whole are getting close to full capacity'' in industrial
production, a condition that can create shortages and bottlenecks
that drive up prices.
   The January through March increase in import prices was
primarily due to an 18.3 percent jump in prices for imported fuels.
The fuels increase was led by a 27.8 percent surge in prices for
imported crude oil that followed a November production accord by
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
   Despite the first-quarter increase in fuel costs, average prices
for imported fuels still were one-third below their 1985 levels.
   Excluding fuels, import prices rose a modest 0.5 percent during
the first quarter after climbing 2.4 percent in the previous
quarter. The advance in prices for non-energy imports was held down
in part by the appreciation of the U.S. dollar during the period,
the Labor Department said.
   The dollar's value increased 3.2 percent last quarter after
falling 4.9 percent in the preceding quarter, according to a
trade-weighted index used by the department. The index now is 2.1
percent higher than it was in March 1988.
   On the export side, prices for food sold abroad rose 2.5 percent
last quarter after declining 3.8 percent in the fourth quarter of
1988. The grain index, which reflects prices for roughly one-half
of U.S. food exports, rose 5.9 percent in the first quarter after
falling 6 percent in the final three months of 1988.
   Since March 1988, the grain index has risen 35.3 percent, mainly
due to last summer's drought.
   Prices for crude material exports rose 4.9 percent last quarter;
prices for fuel exports advanced 2.9 percent.
   For a year, the Federal Reserve Board has been pushing up
interest rates in an effort to restrain economic growth and keep
inflation in check.
   But Gault said it will take some time ``for the tightening of
monetary policy in the U.S. and in other industrialized countries
to slow down the economies enough to have a significant impact on
the inflation rate.''
   For the 12-month period that ended in March, import prices rose
5.1 percent while export prices advanced 6.3 percent.

   It may not be hog heaven, but a new home
in the bucolic mountain town of Ojai is a big improvement for Grunt
the pig, who was facing the prospect of becoming bacon only a week
ago.
   The estimated 1,000-pound animal, whose plight touched people
across the country, is to be sent to a ranch where it is hoped
he'll live high on the hog.
   ``This place that was arranged through the Fund for Animals
sounds like a perfect location, with other animals there like
donkeys, geese, all kinds of other animals,'' said Los Angeles
County Animal Control spokeswoman Gail Christensen on Wednesday.
``It sounds like a real good life to me.''
   But the wife of Grunt's new owner sounded a bit, well,
disgruntled.
   ``Seems to be any animal in the country who's not wanted by
somebody, guess who gets it,'' said Rhonda Osborn.
   Mrs. Osborn's contractor husband, Ozzie, was selected from more
than 300 people across the nation who offered to give Grunt a new
place to wallow.
   The porcine plight began when Grunt was abandoned by his owners,
who moved from their home in affluent Rolling Hills Estates. They
gave their gardener permission to butcher him, but the 4-foot-tall
hog was rescued by animal control officials when his terrified
squeals alerted neighbors.
   Meanwhile, officials say Grunt seems to be reveling in all the
attention.
   ``He seems to be happy about it,'' said Animal Control Officer
Leslie Mitchell. ``In fact, he seems to be a big ham about it.''

   Plane painters got to cut loose with a
million-dollar corporate jet, decorating it with a menacing shark's
jaw on the nose, gang-like logos in bright colors on its fuselage,
in a job that was anything but plain.
   But the paint job _ including one graffito tag saying, ``Elvis
on board'' _ was temporary.
   Kerry McPherson, director of marketing for the Englewood-based
International Jet Aviation Services, said painting was a chance to
display the company's nonconformity.
   ``It was our chance to be irreverent,'' he said. ``We treat
these planes with such kid gloves all the time, polishing, cleaning
and maintaining them like gems. We were having fun.''
   The six-passenger jet had reached 20 years of age and 12,000 air
hours, a point in which the Federal Aviation Administration
requires a complete dismantling and overhaul of an aircraft's
engine, electronic and navigational systems. Part of that overhaul
includes a new paint job, officials said.
   Before the jet was flown to Tucson, Ariz., where the exterior is
to be stripped and repainted in a respectable white-on-blue with
red and gray stripes, the company decided the have a little fun.
   ``We figured it was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to graffiti
something that's worth over $1 million and still not get in trouble
for it,'' said Doug Strangfeld, the firm's maintenance director.
   The paint job at Centennial Airport, south of the Denver
metropolitan area, pleased officials so much they flew to Stapleton
International Airport and left it on the runway for a few hours to
attract gawkers and amateur photographers.
   The $350,000 overhaul, ordered by International Jet official
Bill Milam, is a four-week operation.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Star Wars scientists conducted a 20-second
laboratory flight test of a prototype weapon designed to maneuver
in space to destroy enemy boosters early in flight, Pentagon
officials announced Thursday.
   The test of a Space Based Interceptor prototype, last Monday in
a laboratory at Edwards Air Force Base in California, was billed as
a breakthrough by the Pentagon. It followed a test flight of the
vehicle last Nov. 18 lasting two seconds.
   ``The last test proved that the baby could stand up. This one
proves that it can walk,'' said Pentagon spokesman Dan Howard.
   Scientists from the Strategic Defense Initiative Organization
said that the technology could be used on the ``Brilliant Pebbles''
interceptor that Defense Secretary Dick Cheney told Congress
Tuesday would be a main focus of Star Wars research.
   ``That was the first time that a space weapon has flown. We
integrated the propulsion and guidance units into a configuration
and flew it for the first time,'' said Alan Weston, a scientist
involved in the test.
   Pentagon officials showed reporters color film of the device,
powered by small rocket engines, rising 30 feet in the air, using
small rocket engines to maneuver within a protective net, then
settling back down. Engineers could be heard cheering wildly inside
the laboratory.
   The reusable device cost $3 million to build, is six feet long
and weighs 154 pounds when loaded with 20 pounds of propellant,
said Weston. The test itself cost $500,000, he said.
   It did not move forward and did not include sensing devices to
track enemy boosters.
   ``The technology advances here are in extreme light weight and
fast response,'' said Weston. The rockets aboard the device fired
in 450-millisecond bursts with 350 pounds of thrust, according to
the Pentagon. A millisecond is one thousandth part of a second.
   The Brilliant Pebbles plan discussed by Cheney this week
envisions thousands of orbiting satellites, each about three feet
long and weighing less than 100 pounds, equipped with sensors to
spot, track and target satellites.
   Each ``pebble'' would also have rockets to drive it toward an
enemy booster at speeds capable of destroying it without using
explosive warheads.
   The technology exists to reduce the weight of the vehicle tested
Monday to 10 pounds, said Lloyd Stoessell, another SDIO official at
the briefing.
   The test also was intended to show the ability of computers
aboard the device, programmed in advance, to give orders to
maneuvering rockets that pointed the vehicle with a precision
one-eighth of a degree, an accuracy that would be necessary to
steer the weapon toward an enemy rocket.
   ``This is something that had never been done before,'' said
Weston.
   Scientists plan another test of the prototype this June, when it
will be equipped with a infrared tracker pointed at a rocket engine
parked and firing in a parking lot outside the laboratory, said
Weston.
   The prototype space vehicle would not leave the inside of the
laboratory, and therefore would not break the 1972 Anti-Ballistic
Missile Treaty, which restricts tests of space-based anti-missile
systems.
   Cuts in the Star Wars budget have delayed for several years any
space tests of the technology demonstrated on Monday, said
Stoessell.
   The Bush administration this week proposed cutting Star Wars
spending to $4.6 billion in fiscal 1990, down from the $5.9 billion
proposed by President Reagan in his last budget recommendation.

   West German leaders on Thursday
criticized Washington's rejection of superpower talks on
short-range nuclear weapons and urged NATO to show more readiness
to deal with the Soviet bloc.
   ``There is much to fear in this world. But we certainly don't
have to fear negotiations, or a Soviet Union that is ready to
talk,'' Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher told Parliament,
winning cheers and applause from opposition as well as government
party lawmakers.
   His remarks followed a major policy speech in Parliament by
Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
   Kohl also stepped up pressure on the United States to agree to
negotiations with the Soviets on reducing short-range nuclear
rockets and artillery.
   ``Because of the range of the short-range systems, the Federal
Republic of Germany is affected more by these weapons than the
other partners in the (NATO) alliance,'' Kohl said.
   Kohl also has called on the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
to delay a decision on modernizing aging short-range Lance nuclear
missiles until after federal elections next year. Polls indicate
most West Germans oppose NATO plans to increase the range of the
Lance missiles.
   The NATO nations are in disarray over Kohl's proposal for
superpower negotiations on short-range weapons.
   Washington has given Kohl a clear rebuff, fearing negotiations
could lead to elimination of the short-range weapons and increase
the threat to Western Europe from superior Warsaw Pact conventional
forces.
   Britain also rejects Kohl's proposal.
   But NATO allies Belgium, Norway and Denmark have indicated their
support for Kohl. Another NATO partner, Italy, on Thursday
announced it was siding with Kohl.
   The Western alliance hopes to reach a common position on the
issue before the May 29-30 NATO summit in Brussels, but there have
been no signs the stalemate can be broken before then.
   Genscher delivered a ringing address indirectly targeting the
United States and Britain.
   ``Those who want disarmament must take up negotiations,'' he
said.
   U.S. officials have said NATO should keep a cautious eye on
reform movements in the Soviet Union and other Soviet bloc nations,
because there is no certainty their results _ including promises of
unilateral disarmament measures _ will be permanent.
   But Genscher urged the West to be far more receptive of positive
Soviet bloc developments.
   ``This is a historic opportunity. We cannot let it pass us by
and wait passively. That is our responsibility,'' Genscher said.
   Kohl echoed Genscher's call for an increased Western dialogue
with the Soviet bloc.
   ``We should support the reform processes in all Warsaw Pact
countries,'' Kohl said, urging ``our European and American friends
to help carry out this policy and agree on a common course.''
   Recent polls indicate that three-quarters of the West German
population favors eliminating nuclear weapons in Europe. Most of
NATO's short-range weapons are based in West Germany.
   Kohl reassured the United States and other alliance partners
that his government does not want to eliminate those arms.
   ``In the current circumstances, land, sea and airborne
short-range nuclear weapons are still important in Europe,'' Kohl
said.

<HEAD>Group Urges Tighter Regulation of Lawn Care Industry</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   A consumer group on Thursday urged tighter
government regulation of the multimillion-dollar lawn care
industry, saying there are few state laws to ensure workers are
properly trained or warned of potential health effects of the
chemicals used.
   Public Citizen, a private environmental and consumer
organization, said a national survey shows that nearly two-thirds
of the states have no requirement for either training or testing
lawn care employees.
   The survey said only about a third of the states require that
consumers be given information about the chemicals used and in most
of those states a company supplies little more than a chemical
label. Only a handful of states require notice before a lawn is
treated or a warning that it has been treated, according to the
survey.
   As a result, ``millions of Americans may be unwittingly exposed
to potentially dangerous pesticides in their own back yards,'' said
Laura Weiss, who wrote Public Citizen's report on the survey.
   The lawn care industry has grown rapidly in recent years with
more than 7 million households using such sevices annually. In 1987
the industry had revenues of $1.5 billion, according to Public
Citizen.
   Ms. Weiss also wrote a recent report maintaining that many of
the chemicals used by the lawn care industry have the potential of
causing long-term health problems including cancer, birth defects,
liver, kidney or nerve damage as well as short-term ailments.
   The industry has defended its use of the chemicals, saying the
companies only use them in accordance with safety instructions
supplied by the manufacturers and that the chemicals are approved
by the Environmental Protection Agency for lawn care use.
   ``We have to be registered and certified in most states,'' said
James Brooks, a spokesman for the Professional Lawn Care
Association.
   But Ms. Weiss says in her report that while the EPA approves the
use of chemicals for lawn care, there is little federal regulation
of lawn care companies and no federal training or performance
standards for workers who actually treat the lawns.
   Here are some of the findings, according to the Public Citizen
survey:
   Only six states require both that advance notice be given of
scheduled lawn treatment and that signs be posted afterward. Those
states are Maryland, Massachusetts, Connecticut, New Jersey, New
York and Rhode Island.
   Maine and Iowa require the warning signs, but no advance notice,
while New Hampshire and Pennsylvania require the advance notice but
no post-treatment warning signs.
   A dozen states require lawn care company employees to pass a
state test. Those states are Arizona, Connecticut, Illinois,
Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico,
Tennessee, Utah and Wisconsin. But only in Indiana and Utah are
lawn care employees required to be both trained and tested under
state-supervised programs.
   In most states consumers also are left without detailed
explanations of the potential hazards associated with lawn care
chemicals, said Ms. Weiss.
   Only Massachusetts, New York and Maryland require state
information sheets to be provided to customers. Seventeen other
states have some form of consumer information requirement, but in
many cases that amounts to merely providing the names of the
pesticides being used, the report said.

<HEAD>Conservationists Say Wildlife Loss from Oil Spill Much Worse than
Reported</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY B. DARST</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Press reports from Alaska have failed to get
across the vast killing of wildlife or the enormous remaining risks
to millions of birds, animals and fish from the oil spill in Prince
William Sound, a conservation group said Thursday.
   ``We may already be seeing only one percent of the dead,'' said
Albert M. Manville, senior staff wildlife biologist for Defenders
of Wildlife.
   Manville, who spent April 12-17 observing cleanup efforts and
damage from the March 24 spill, said reports of 200 to 300 miles of
beach contaminated by the 11-million gallon spill were ``wildly
inaccurate.''
   Actual beach contamination, he said, ``is probably closer to
1,000 to 2,000 miles'' of coastline and islands southwest of the
sound.
   Aerial spotting may report many beaches clean when an
on-the-ground inspection would show they are not, Manville said. He
said he was unable to say how much uncontaminated coastline remains
at risk.
   ``The war on stopping the oil spill is lost, in my opinion, but
a few skirmishes can still be won,'' he said. ``The unfortunate
fact of the matter is that ongoing wildlife rehabilitation is
probably more for the public's benefit than for the wildlife's.''
   His organization was joined by several other environmental
groups in writing the tanker owner, Exxon Corp., the Coast Guard
and other cleanup authorities asking greater attention to wildlife.
   The letter from Defenders, Greenpeace, the Sierra Club Legal
Defense Fund, the National Audubon Society and Trustees for Alaska
called for immediate installation of protective booms and
stationing of skimming equipment at Port Nellie Juan and Port Wells
in western Prince William Sound and Port Chalmers and Stockdale
Harbor on the northwest coast of Montague Island, and development
of a plan developed to protect Orca Inlet if necessary.
   Millions of waterfowl migrate through the sound area every year,
and 300,000 to 500,000 birds make the sound their home for at least
part of the year, Manville said.
   Birds on their northward migration probably would not land on
oil or oil-soaked areas in good weather, but if the weather is bad
they might ``and we could have the catastrophic loss of millions of
birds,'' Manville said.
   Oil has been spotted 325 miles from the spot where the tanker
Exxon Valdez ran aground, Manville said. This was a somewhat
greater distance than the 275 miles mentioned in the latest
confirmed reports from Alaska.
   Accurate counts of dead wildlife have been difficult, Manville
said, because of scavenging by eagles and gulls _ which may die
after eating oil-soaked carcasses. Deaths include up to 300 Sitka
black-tailed deer; at least one bear, and muskrat and porcupine.
   Probably three-quarters of the 5,500 sea otters living in the
western half of the sound, the half hit by the spreading oil, have
been killed or harmed by the oil, he said. The Fish and Wildlife
Service estimated on April 14 that nearly all the otters in the oil
``impact area'' had been killed.
   As of Wednesday, 391 dead otters had been counted either in the
wild or after unsuccessful rescue attempts.
   Defenders recommended the transfer of additional
``super-sucker'' oil scooping ships from the oil-exploration areas
off Alaska's North Slope; a visit to the sound by President Bush;
trials of a new detergent, BioVersal, offered by a West German
company for beach cleaning; payments by Exxon of $1 billion a year
for five years for restoration; conversion of key areas of the
Arctic National Wildlife Refuge on the North slope to a wilderness
area to prevent drilling there and refunding the money for some $95
million worth of drilling leases not yet awarded in Bristol Bay,
another major fishing ground.

   Gunmen shot and killed a leftist congressman
as he took his children to school Thursday and authorities said he
was the highest elected official killed in Peru's nine-year
insurgency.
   No group claimed responsibility for the attack.
   In the Amazon jungle, guerrillas raided a river town and
occupied it for four hours, killing a woman and wounding five
people, the newspaper El Comercio said.
   Eriberto Arroyo, a congressional deputy from the United Left
party, was killed in Chaclacayo, a Lima surburb, the Interior
Ministry said but refused to give further details. The United Left,
a coalition of communist parties, has the second-largest
representation in Congress.
   Radio Programas, Peru's leading news station, quoted police as
blaming the lefist Shining Path guerrilla group, which has admitted
to 15,000 killings in its nine-year war against the government. But
the Path, which seeks to impose communist rule, has made only
infrequent attacks against legal leftist groups.
   United Left Sen. Edmundo Murrugarra told reporters the
anti-guerrilla death squad, the Rodrigo Franco Command, killed
Arroyo. Murrugarra said a gunman, seated with three others in a
car, opened fire on Arroyo and his wife as they were leaving their
three children at a school.
   None of Arroyo's family members was injured, Radio Programas
said.
   The Franco Command surfaced a year ago vowing to kill people it
considers leftist guerrillas or their supporters. The government
led by center-left Alan Garcia of the Aprista party has denied any
connection to the rightist group.
   In the Amazon, at least 150 members of the Tupac Amaru
Revolutionary Movement aboard motor boats on Tuesday stormed
Contamana, on the Ucayali River, 390 miles northeast of Lima,
according to the respected daily El Comercio.
   The Interior Ministry refused to confirm reports of the attack.
   Ten defenders in the town's police post traded shots with the
attackers for an hour before running out of ammunition and fleeing
into the surrounding dense jungles, El Comercio said.
   The Movement is an anti-U.S. guerrilla group, which emerged one
year before Peru's 1985 presidential elections. Actions by the
organization so far have been confined to attacks that generate
publicity but little bloodshed.

   Emmy-winning actress Tyne Daly says
her former ``Cagney and Lacey'' role as ``a cop, a friend, and
somebody's mother,'' should help her play the mother of burlesque
star Gypsy Rose Lee.
   Ms. Daly, following the lead of stage luminaries Ethel Merman
and Angela Lansbury, is tackling the role of Mama Rose in the 30th
anniversary revival of ``Gypsy'' that premieres here May 2 prior to
a November opening on Broadway.
   The actress said it was difficult to tell how her interpretation
of the driven, pushy stage mother would differ from those of the
late Ms. Merman, who starred in the 1959 production, and Ms.
Lansbury, who headlined a revival in 1974.
   ``I like her (Rose) because she is gallant and she has pizazz.
... She's a glorious monster and a lot of fun,'' said Ms. Daly.
   ``My obligation is to play Rose. I have to play Rose, not
Tyne,'' said Ms. Daly, adding, ``I have every intention of being
the Rose of the '80s or '90s.''

   Acting experience didn't ease the butterflies
Meryl Streep felt when she went to Washington to complain about
chemical additives in food and drink.
   ``I'm uncomfortable in a public platform,'' she said. ``But the
issue of pesticides in children's lives ... was alarming enough
that I felt that I wanted my friends to know about it and I felt
that other people would be interested in it.''
   Miss Streep, who has waged a campaign against Alar, a chemical
additive which enhances the shelf life of apples, added, ``It's
taken more work, more time and more from my family than any movie
or any other project that I have ever done.''
   On Wednesday, Miss Streep, winner of two Academy Awards and
seven Oscar nominations, was among eight women named by the
National Mother's Day Committee as Outstanding Mothers of 1989. She
and her husband, sculptor Don Gummer, have three children and live
in Connecticut.
   The others who received awards were Faith Daniels, a CBS-TV news

   John Denver was in Denver this week _ not to sing
country songs but to inspire and seek help for Mother Earth.
   He offered his first presentation Wednesday of ``Higher
Ground,'' a multimedia symposium that uses music and a slide show
to urge people to pitch in for the environment.
   ``I'm not here as John Denver the celebrity. I'm not here as
John Denver the singer. I'm not here as John Denver, the aspiring
cosmonaut,'' Denver told the crowd. ``I'm here as an expression of
my whole, true, complete self.''
   Denver said individuals can improve the environment by taking a
stand, and that politicians and governments will follow, not lead,
committed people who have moved to ``higher ground.''

   Dutch Queen Beatrix and her
husband, Prince Claus, will visit China next month on a weeklong
trip focusing on economic issues, a royal house spokesman said
Thursday.
   In Beijing, the queen is to attend the opening meetings of talks
between the Netherlands' trade mission and their Chinese
counterparts, while in Gingdao, a city in a so-called new economic
zone, the royals will get a first-hand experience of China's
ongoing economic reforms.
   In Shanghai, the last stop of the trip, the royal couple is to
attend an economic seminar, as well as visit a joint venture of
Heineken, the Dutch brewery concern, and a Chinese beer
manufacturer.
   The couple previously visited China in 1978, two years before
Beatrix's coronation.

   Officers pursued Tyson late Wednesday night as the boxer, in his
1989 Lamborghini, raced against a friend on a four-lane avenue.
After a brief chase, police caught up with Tyson and the other
driver, 22-year-old Mark Johnson of Albany, when they pulled into a
parking lot.
   ``We asked them for their license and registration,'' said

   Australian soap opera star and pop
singer Kylie Minogue will shed her squeaky-clean image in a new
film, ``The Delinquents,'' playing an uneducated 1950s teen-ager.
   The film, based on a novel by Criena Rohan, calls for Minogue to
play several intimate love scenes. Her character will also undergo
an abortion.
   Minogue, 20, said Thursday the movie appealed to her ``because
the producers wanted me for who I am, not just because I can put
bums on seats.''
   ``I've been offered lots of roles, but this was the first one
that is decent,'' said Minogue, who played Charlene, a motor
mechanic, in the soap opera ``Neighbours,'' which tops the ratings
in Britain and Australia.
   Minogue has also had top 10 hits in Britain and the United
States, including ``I Should Be So Lucky'' and ``Locomotion.''
   The film, which also stars American Charlie Schlatter, will be
shot on location in Queensland and is scheduled for a December
release.

   Pravda on Thursday published seven pages of
astonishing admissions by Communist Party officials that their
failures had led to embarrassing losses in parliamentary elections
and damaged the people's faith in their leaders.
   The officials, speaking at a meeting of the party's
policy-making Central Committee, said the 20 million-member party
is in danger of losing its unity and hold on the Soviet people.
   ``The people feel uncomfortable, alarmed, have lost their
optimism,'' said Moscow Mayor Valery T. Saikin, who lost in the
March 26 elections. ``Various generations of people, separate
social layers and even regions are quarrelling among themselves.''
   His remarks and those of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and 19
other speakers dominated Pravda, the party's official newspaper.
   Saikin said people were losing faith in the party, and that as a
result, party organizations ``have lost their vanguard role.'' This
was a striking admission that the party had failed in one of its
primary goals, to lead Soviet society.
   Remarks at Central Committees generally are kept secret, and
publication of 20 critical speeches delivered Tuesday appeared to
be an effort to show the people the leadership is hearing their
complaints.
   Admissions that perestroika, Gorbachev's 4-year-old
restructuring program, has failed to solve many of the country's
problems also could serve as ammunition by people fighting for more
radical reform.
   Gorbachev gained strength to push for more extreme action at
Tuesday's meeting, when 74 of the Central Committee's 301 members
retired.
   Because of age, illness or political disgrace, those who retired
had lost the top government or party job which entitled them to
membership. The remarks of some of those who retired were published
Thursday.
   Among them was Geidar A. Aliev, the 65-year-old former party
chief in Azerbaijan and a close associate of former President
Leonid I. Brezhnev.
   News reports have accused Aliev of corruption and falsifying
records to show he was a war veteran. But Aliev told the Central
Committee the accusations were untrue and came from people he had
fired in Azerbaijan for wrongdoing.
   Yuri F. Solovyev, the highest ranking of the approximately three
dozen party officials who lost in the elections to the Congress of
People's Deputies, said that despite perestroika, ``The minuses
here still significantly exceed the pluses.''
   Because of the failures, said Ivan K. Polozkov, a party leader
in the Krasnodar region of southern Russia, ``the authority of the
party is falling in the eyes of the public.''
   Many members feel no need to adhere to the party program and
rules, and some are so despondent over the lack of recognition of
their accomplishments that they have turned in their party
membership cards, he said.
   Several other speakers painted similarly bleak pictures.
   ``Today, people do not have confidence in tomorrow,'' said
Vladimir I. Melnikov, the party chief of the Komi region.
   ``We are losing the workers,'' he said. The country is ``in a
real crisis'' that Gorbachev is not fully aware of because the
Central Committee staff is ``safeguarding the general secretary
from the severity of the situation.''
   Melnikov told the committee many party officials are so afraid
of the people's wrath that they are refusing to run in the next
round of elections to the 2,250-seat parliament on May 14.
   In closing remarks at the committee meeting Tuesday, Gorbachev
agreed perestroika was going poorly and was worsening shortages of
housing, consumer goods and food, but said people still have faith
in the party.
   ``I do not agree with extreme judgments that the party is nearly
losing its position in the country or that it has turned into a
debating society and so on,'' Gorbachev said.
   ``The party's dialogue with working people is not a weakness or
making the Communist Party a debating society. If it is weakness to
conduct a dialogue with all segments of society, then I do not know
what courage is.''

   The juvenile justice system was created to
deal with ``the children of folks like us'' and should be toughened
to punish ``the kinds of kids who did what happened in Central
Park,'' a New Hampshire congressman declared Thursday.
   ``What we're saying is, If you're going to do big-boy crime,
you're going to do big-boy time,'' said Rep. Chuck Douglas, R-N.H.,
a former state Supreme Court justice.
   Douglas spoke at a news conference called by four congressional
freshmen, members of the Republican Research Committee Task Force
on Crime, to say the beating and rape of a woman in New York's
Central Park on April 19 highlights a need for changing the
juvenile justice system.
   ``I can tell you that we have a juvenile justice system that is
modeled basically for the middle class,'' Douglas said. ``The
children of folks like us, the children of the middle class who may
get into trouble with shoplifting at a young age; they may throw a
rock through a window, that's where the juvenile justice system
works. ... But the system does not work, and it's no deterrent, and
it's no protection and shouldn't be for the kinds of kids who did
what happened in Central Park.''
   Asked to explain his ``folks like us'' comment, Douglas said,
``The kinds of people who are in this room ... people who are not
involved in the drug scene, people who are not making their living
selling crack. That's what I meant by the kinds of folks who are in
this room.''
   Eight people, ages 14 to 17, are in custody.
   Only one has a police record, and in general teachers called
them good students. One principal said of two of them: ``They come
from homes of parents who care, parents who are as shocked as we
are.'' Four lived in a building with a doorman.
   The congressmen said that in many states youngsters who commit
violent crimes such as rape, armed robbery, murder or attempted
murder get little more than a slap on the wrist.
   The task force is hoping by the end of the year to create
standardized state legislation ``that would cause the most violent
of juvenile offenders to receive the full punishment for their
actions if they're convicted,'' said Rep. Steven Schiff, R-N.M., a
former district attorney. The task force would strongly urge states
to pass its model legislation, he said.
   Douglas said he hoped Congress would pass his own bill to
withhold federal money for juvenile justice from states that fail
to adopt such model legislation.
   The other two members of the group at the news conference were
Reps. Dennis Smith of Oregon and Melton D. Hancock of Missouri.

   A mentally disabled, AIDS-infected 7-year-old
who won a long legal battle for admission to public school attended
class for the first time Thursday amid cheers from supporters and
hugs from classmates.
   Eliana Martinez, wearing a pink dress and matching bows in her
hair, received a warm welcome at the Manhattan Exceptional Center
where supporters cheered outside the single-story, red-brick
building.
   Administrators pushed for a smooth transition inside, and fellow
students wasted no time getting acquainted with their new classmate.
   ``She rushed in, the children came around her and one of them
hugged her,'' said Rosa Martinez, who fought officials' fears that
her incontinent daughter posed a health risk to others through
bodily secretions. ``They just surrounded her,'' she added. ``They
didn't need any introduction.''
   A federal judge ruled Wednesday that the child could attend
school without being confined to a glass isolation booth, paving
the way for what Mrs. Martinez called the most important day of
Eliana's life.
   Principal Sandra Williams said she sent notes to parents
Wednesday to prepare them for the girl's arrival and received seven
calls of concern, with one mother saying she was not ready to
accept the risk.
   A meeting aimed at reducing anxiety among parents is scheduled
for next week, said Walter Sickles, deputy superintendent of
Hillsborough County schools.
   Eliana carried a knapsack and a toy that plays the Disney song
``It's A Small World'' as she entered school to become the 12th
student in her class.
   ``It's a wonderful day for her,'' attorney Steve Hanlon said.
``She'll do wonderfully here. She's going to take off like a
rocket.''
   Mrs. Martinez said she was glad the 2{-year legal battle was
finally behind her. ``I'm too happy to be bitter about anything,''
she said.
   Linda Castellano, a family friend and head of an AIDS support
group called Linda and Frenz, was among seven supporters outside
the school where 201 pupils are enrolled.
   ``I know she'll benefit from playing with other kids,'' she
said. ``She's always around adults and always having to look up.
Now she'll have eye contact with children.''
   U.S. District Judge Elizabeth A. Kovachevich, who originally
ordered the glass booth for Eliana, ruled Wednesday that the girl
posed no significant health risk to her classmates.
   Her initial decision would have confined the child to the booth
until she became toilet trained and learned to stop sucking her
fingers. Mrs. Martinez said she would not put her child in a
``glass cage.''
   The latest decision came four months after the 11th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals sent the case back to Ms. Kovachevich, saying
Eliana, who had been taught at home since June 1987, must be placed
in a regular classroom unless there was evidence she posed a threat
to other children through bodily secretions.
   School officials generally said they were relieved that the
lengthy battle is finished. One, however, indicated he was still
concerned about safety and said if he had a child in Eliana's class
he probably would not let the child stay at the school.
   ``Based on the knowledge I do have right now, I could not allow
my child to be in the class,'' school board Chairman Sam Rampello
said. `` ... A judge's decision doesn't take away the trepidation.''
   Mrs. Martinez adopted Eliana as an infant in her native Puerto
Rico. The girl became infected with AIDS from tranfusions of
tainted blood shortly after her premature birth.

   U.S. Secretary of Transportation Samuel Skinner
said Thursday he will no longer inform Congress about airline
security threats because he fears public disclosure could hamper
security measures.
   Skinner also told reporters that passengers on U.S. airlines may
be barred from taking electronic devices on jets. The bomb that
blew up Pan Am Flight 103 in December was hidden inside a
radio-casette player.
   Later, British Transport Secretary Paul Channon announced that
Britain will install a new U.S. bomb-detection device _ thermal
neutron analysis _ at London's Gatwick Airport this summer. The
device can find plastic explosives that standard X-rays miss.
   Britain will be the first foreign country to use the $1 million
device. Skinner said it should be installed throughout Europe
following the Dec. 21 Pan Am explosion.
   The jumbo jet, bound for New York from Frankfurt and London, was
blown apart by a tiny bomb over the Scottish village of Lockerbie,
killing 270 people.
   Skinner, on the last stop of a five-nation European tour, said
he was adamant about not discussing publicly intelligence-gathering
or unannounced airline security bulletins.
   ``I have just sent a letter to the U.S. Congress advising them
that I will no longer disseminate information to them regarding
security bulletins until I am absolutely sure that they have a
mechanism in place to protect that information,'' he said.
   He said he plans new regulations about leaking airline
``security-type information,'' adding, ``I may seek legislation
making it a crime.''
   Last month, Skinner criticized a London newspaper, The Daily
Express, which reported a security bulletin that the U.S. Federal
Aviation Administration sent to airports and carriers March 16
about a possible hijacking of a U.S. airliner in Europe.
   Skinner thinks disclosure of warnings would prejudice security
and that public notification of the many threats would result in
them being taken for granted.
   After the Pan Am explosion, Channon was accused of bungling the
dissemination to airlines of West German warnings that Palestinian
terrorists had devised a new radio-cassette bomb.
   The first of the thermal neutron analysis devices will be
installed at John F. Kennedy Airport in July.
   After the Pan Am disaster, the United States accelerated by six
months a $60 million thermal neutron analysis program.
   Skinner said he expected the devices to be installed at several
European airports by year's end.
   ``Every place I have gone, everyone wants to do more,'' said
Skinner, who arrived Thursday night after meeting government
officials in Italy, West Germany, France and Switzerland.
   On electronic devices such as portable computers, Skinner said
that unless a sure means of scanning them is devised, they might be
barred from aircraft. But he added that a ban was unlikely.

   Italians had to buckle-up Thursday as the
nation's first seat belt law went into effect, and a traffic
policeman in the eastern coastal city of Ancona wasted little time
in making sure people complied.
   Five minutes after the law went into effect at midnight, police
officer Giuseppe Baccolini spotted an offender, and in the next
hour he issued 11 other tickets, according to the ANSA news agency.
   Fines range from about $9 to $37.
   The law requires the driver and front-seat passenger to wear
seat belts at all times. Babies and toddlers must be strapped into
car seats and children under 12 must sit in the back seat.

   Iranian authorities arrested 792 drug
pushers and addicts in a two-day nationwide narcotics sweep,
state-run Tehran Radio reported Thursday.
   The radio, monitored in Nicosia, said two notorious drug
smugglers were among those arrested in southeast Kerman province,
along with 165 pounds of opium and a large quantity of cash.
   Since a new anti-narcotics law went into effect on Jan. 21, more
than 2,000 people allegedly involved in drug abuse have been
arrested. The law carries the death sentence for possession of even
small quantities of drugs.
   According to official reports, 416 people have been convicted of
drug offenses and executed.
   Most arrests made since January were in provinces along the
border with Pakistan and Afghanistan, from where authorities say
most of the drugs are smuggled into Iran.
   Officials have estimated that 1 million of Iran's 50 million
people are drug addicts but unofficial estimates put the number at
twice that.

   While the jury continued deciding his fate
Thursday, Oliver North turned his attention to a speech to an
invitation-only audience in Ohio.
   North, the former National Security Council aide being tried on
12 criminal charges stemming from the Iran-Contra affair, has made
several speeches since the trial began on Jan. 31 at fees believed
to be $20,000-$25,000 each.
   Asked how much North was getting for Thursday night's speech at
the Bankers Club in Cincinnati, club manager Brian Lasure said
``that's confidential.''
   The legal bills of North, who has had at least three lawyers at
the defense table and at times as many as five, are estimated at
$380,000 a month.
   Reporters in Cincinnati were told there would be no press
coverage of North's speech in DuBois Tower. The Bankers club's
1,200 members principally are bankers, lawyers and businessmen and
women.
   The three men and nine women on North's jury, meanwhile,
deliberated for the sixth day without any hint of where they stand.
They sent no notes out of the room and made no requests of the
judge.
   They quit for the day shortly after 4 p.m., having worked on
their verdict for 5{ hours _ a total 32{ in the six days.
   All 363 exhibits, totaling some 1,300 pages are in the second
floor courtroom where the jurors are meeting so there is no need
for them to ask for specific documents.
   Meanwhile, 10 news organizations, including The Associated
Press, are appealing U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell's ruling
that they cannot see a North trial stipulation summarizing
intelligence intercepts concerning a CIA-assisted arms shipment to
Iran.
   North's lawyers and the American Civil Liberties Union are
lining up on the side of the press, which is trying have the
document _ available to the jury _ released to the public as well.
   North attorney Brendan Sullivan read aloud part of the document
during his final summation in open court last week.
   Court security officers deleted some of Sullivan's words from
the official transcript, but Gesell ordered them restored after the
motion by the news media. But he also declared the stipulation
itself to be classified and that is the basis of the appeal.
   The stipulation referred to intelligence ``intercepts'' that
tracked _ minute-by-minute _ the CIA-assisted shipments of U.S.
Hawk missiles sent from Israel to Iran in November 1985. North's
lawyers used it in an effort to show the shipment was known at the
top levels of the government.
   Sullivan told the jury to ``remember, Ollie North is charged
with somehow doing a chronology and leaving out the November 1985
missile transaction and somehow fooling Casey and Poindexter, even
though they got all this material which shows exactly what it
was.'' The reference was to the late CIA Director William Casey and
then-National Security Adviser John M. Poindexter.
   Later in the censored-then-uncensored transcript, Sullivan
called the intelligence intercepts ``the most guarded, most closely
held intelligence in the United States government. ... They remain
classified, top secret, code level even today.''
   Gesell's office said all of the jurors were bearing up well,
apparently having overcome earlier health problems.
   North is accused of lying to Congress to cover up his role in
secretly assisting the Nicaraguan Contras and lying to the attorney
general about aspects of the diversion of funds to the Contras from
the Iran arms sales. He also faces charges alleging he personally
profited from the affair.
   Also Thursday, the chief judge of the Fairfax County Circuit
Court said he had renewed North's permit to carry a concealed
weapon in the county, where North lives.
   ``It's very unusual'' said Chief Judge Lewis Griffith, adding
that of 77 applications filed in 1988, North was the sole recipient
of a permit.
   North feels threatened by terrorists and what his attorney calls
``the nut element,'' Griffith said.
   One of the charges against North is that he accepted an illegal
gratuity _ a $13,800 home security system, which he says he needed
because of terrorists' threats.

<TEXT>
   On one side of Prince William Sound,
wildlife agents set up scarecrows and fireworks Thursday to scare
migratory birds from landing on oily beaches.
   A different kind of fireworks was being planned on the other
side of the sound, where residents of Cordova prepared for a town
meeting Thursday night with officials of Exxon, the Coast Guard and
others involved in cleaning the nation's worst oil spill.
   ``The mood here is people are really concerned,'' said Nancy
Bird, a resident who has started a weekly newsletter on the oil
spill and its effect on the small fishing community of about 2,500
people about 50 miles southeast of Valdez.
   Bird said some of the concerns likely to be expressed at the
meeting were:
   _Cannery workers want to know why they're being asked to release
Exxon of liability for canceling the herring season in order to get
claims checks.
   _Businesses want to know why they aren't being reimbursed for
their loss of business.
   _Fishermen are concerned that the Exxon Valdez still is leaking
and want it moved from one side of Naked Island to the other so
crude won't flow directly toward hatcheries.
   ``Last time we talked with Exxon everyone was very frustrated,''
Bird said. ``The frustration level is still pretty high, but it's
kind of matured. We don't expect things to change very fast.
They're so disorganized.''
   Heavy fog canceled spotter flights Thursday and kept skimmers in
port.
   Wildlife agents arrived Wednesday on Green Island and were
setting up propane cannons, scarecrows and other devices to scare
migratory birds away.
   The plywood scarecrows also will eventually be erected on Seal
Island, another favorite stopover for seabirds headed north,
officials said.
   ``We went to the Salvation Army store in Anchorage and bought 36
sets of clothes'' to outfit the scarecrows, said David McGillivary,
a U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife biologist in Valdez. The life-sized
scarecrows with painted faces were made with only half-length arms
so that shirt sleeves flap in the wind.
   Exxon scientist Al Maki said Wednesday the hazing program,
financed by the company, is a contingency plan.
   ``We could have that oil up before the majority of the birds
arrive,'' he said. Exxon officials said cleanup of the islands
would begin within days.
   The Fish &amp; Wildlife Service said some migratory birds have
arrived, but most of the tens of thousands that pass through the
area won't do so until early May.
   An official of the National Audubon Society said he doubts the
usefulness of the program, but doesn't fault the Fish &amp; Wildlife
Service for preparing it.
   ``It's something that we support reluctantly,'' said David
Cline, the society's vice president for Alaska.
   The scare tactics are unlikely to have an impact because they
will be conducted in a very small part of the vast sound, and
because the birds heading off to breeding grounds are ``genetically
and physically programmed'' to go certain places, Cline said.
``It's extremely difficult to deter them.''
   A Fish &amp; Wildlife Service spokesman at the agency's regional
office in Anchorage defended the hazing program.
   ``Basically, the methods they will be using have been used
extensively in the Lower 48,'' spokesman Craig Rieben said.
   More than 10 million gallons of oil spilled when a tanker ran
aground on Bligh Reef on March 24. Exxon and the state dispute the
amount of the spill, with the oil company setting the figure at
10.1 million gallons and the state at 10.9 million.

<TEXT>
   To no one's surprise, President Bush moved
quickly to fulfill his campaign promise of strong efforts against
the illegal drug trade. But to almost everyone's surprise, he also
suspended imports of assault rifles and talked of possible federal
controls.
   Drugs and guns have highlighted the domestic policies of the
first 100 days of the Bush administration, including an emergency
plan to combat drug-related murders in the District of Columbia
which became the nation's murder capital in 1988.
   A leftover problem and a sudden crisis put the spotlight on
other domestic areas in the 100 days that ends Saturday, as the
Republican leader moved carefully in many other policy matters.
   Bush sent a major proposal to Capitol Hill to deal with the
savings and loan crisis left from the Reagan years. Congress is
grinding away on the bailout bill, estimated to cost $157 billion
over 10 years.
   And then the Exxon Valdez ran aground, pouring oil from the
giant tanker into the sea and polluting the Alaska shoreline. The
administration came in for criticism for not moving fast enough to
try to halt the environmental damage. Bush eventually dispatched
Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner and other top U.S.
officials to deal with the cleanup.
   But the president made clear from Inauguration Day that dealing
with the drug problem was at the top of his agenda.
   ``This scourge will stop,'' Bush declared, adding that it was
``the most obvious'' area ``in which we as a society must rise up
united and express our intolerance.''
   The president named William J. Bennett the nation's drug czar,
charged with the task of coordinating the fight.
   But almost immediately Bush's fight against drugs raised another
tough issue, gun control.
   Semiautomatic assault-style rifles were becoming increasingly
popular with warring drug dealers around the country, but public
demands for controls on the weapons didn't take off until January,
when innocent children became the victims of a man who opened fire
with such a rifle on a school yard in Stockton, Calif. Five
children were killed.
   Bush, a lifelong member of the National Rifle Association, vowed
for the first six weeks in office that he opposed any ban on the
rapid-fire assault-style rifles.
   He maintained that stance even though his wife, Barbara, told
The Associated Press just two weeks after her husband's
inauguration that she fears guns and thinks assault weapons should
be banned.
   Faced with a growing public outcry against the weapons, Bush
relented a bit.
   Less than a month later, the president asked Bennett to look
into the situation and revealed at a news conference that he had
told Bennett, ``if you come to me with a sensible answer that takes
care of the concerns that I've felt over the years, I'll take a
hard look at it, and I'll work with you to that end.''
   The initial suspension on imports of semiautomatic weapons,
announced March 14, came only a few days after Bennett was sworn in
as director of the office of national drug control policy, and the
announcement came out of Bennett's office.
   Bush dismissed speculation that the White House had directed
that Bennett's office handle the announcement to place some
distance between the suspension and Bush. When the administration
expanded the suspension a month later to include 24 models of
weapons that had been left out of the original ban, the
announcement came out of the White House.
   The president is a lifelong member of the National Rifle
Association, which was clearly not thrilled by the wayward path of
its most well-known member. But the powerful lobby kept its powder
dry when the first suspension of imports took effect, saying the
action would cool off the public outcries over the weapons
triggered by the schoolyard shootings Jan. 17 by Patrick Purdy, a
24-year-old drifter, in Stockton, Calif.
   The NRA denied allegations by an administration source that it
had delivered messages through third parties to Bennett threatening
his political future because of his stand on the weapons.
   Irwin Kahn, a Republican National Committeeman and machine gun
dealer who also owns a $23 million office furniture company in
Ohio, said Bush had no other option but to suspend the imports.
   ``I think it's the only thing he could have done ... What he did
was defused, temporarily, a situation that is being totally
overreacted to,'' Kahn said in a telephone interview.
   As for the drug-related violence in the District of Columbia,
Bennett outlined an emergency plan April 10 to combat the problem.
In doing so, he blasted Mayor Marion Barry Jr.'s handling of the
issue, which brought a comment from White House spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater that ``We are in this to solve the drug problem, not to
pick fights.''
   The administration had hoped to have a comprehensive drug, crime
and gun package ready to announce during Bush's four-day trip this
week, but it did not materialize. White House Chief of Staff John
Sununu said the package is a week to 10 days away.
   The president's budget proposal for fiscal 1990, starting Oct.
1, reflected his interest in the drug war by requesting $5.5
billion to fight the battle, almost a $1 billion increase over
spending this year and about $236 million more than President
Reagan had sought for 1990.

   Police are arresting non-Indian protesters
at a record pace at lakes where the Chippewa Indians are spearing
fish under the guarantee of 19th-century treaties, state officials
said Thursday.
   An organizer of a sit-in protest at which 35 people were
arrested Wednesday night said more opponents of the Chippewa's
court-affirmed treaty rights are willing to go to jail, and similar
protests may be staged.
   The arrests were made when crowds gathered at boat landings on
northern Wisconsin lakes where the annual Chippewa spearing season
began last weekend prior to the fishing season for non-Indians.
   Dean Crist, a spokesman for Stop Treaty Abuse-Wisconsin and one
of those arrested, criticized Oneida County Sheriff Charles Crofoot
for roping off boat landings where the Chippewa were spearing, thus
restricting protesters from the lakes.
   ``If Sheriff Crofoot doesn't come around we might try it (a
protest) with 300'' people, Crist said. ``What we would like is
equal access to the landings. We're not trying to test the jails.''
   This is the fifth spring that Wisconsin's six Chippewa bands
have speared fish since a federal court ruled in 1983 that the
tribe retained the right to gather food off-reservation. The right
was guaranteed under 19th-century treaties that ceded much of
northern Wisconsin to the United States.
   Spearfishing critics say the three-pronged spears used by the
Indians leave too few trophy-size walleyed pike for non-Indian
anglers when the rod-and-reel season begins in early May.
   Tom Maulson, a member of the Lac Du Flambeau Chippewa who helps
organize the tribe's spearfishing activities, said police were
``doing a fantastic job'' protecting the Indian spearers.
   But tensions between the Chippewa and non-Indians were at an
all-time high, he added.
   ``I don't think it can get any worse than this,'' he said. ``All
we can do is hope.''
   Twenty-six of those arrested were charged Thursday in Oneida
County Circuit Court with violating a county disorderly conduct
ordinance and released on signature bonds, District Attorney Brian
Maloney said.
   Nine others were released from jail after posting bond and will
be charged at a later date, he said.
   In all, 43 protesters were arrested at three lakes Wednesday
night, raising the total number of arrests to 46 since the Chippewa
began their spearfishing season Sunday night.
   In Madison, Ralph Christensen, chief warden for the state
Department of Natural Resources, said Thursday it was ``clearly the
case'' that police would arrest a record number of protesters this
season.
   Christensen said Wednesday's protests marked the first organized
civil disobedience involving treaty rights opponents.
   George Meyer, DNR chief of enforcement, said crowds of
protesters at boat landings this year have been ``more emotional
and larger than at this time in other years.''
   The Wisconsin Natural Resource Board on Thursday approved an
emergency rule that authorizes the state to sharply reduce bag
limits for non-Indian anglers who fish lakes that are also speared
by the Chippewa.
   Under the rule, the state will reduce the number of walleye
taken daily by anglers from five to three or less on the 254 lakes
that the Chippewa plan to spear this spring.

<HEAD>Probe Reveals Former Officials Profited from HUD Contracts</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An investigation into a federal housing
renovation program has revealed a pattern in which former Reagan
administration officials raked in handsome profits on contracts to
rehabilitate subsidized apartments for the poor.
   The inspector general of the Department of Housing and Urban
Development drew a comparison with the Pentagon procurement
scandal, with former government officials drawing big fees as
consultants to developers seeking government contracts.
   But Inspector General Paul Adams said he had found no evidence
that active HUD officials had been involved in influence-peddling
and made no charges of criminal activity.
   The investigation by the department's inspector general,
announced Wednesday, also listed several former top-level HUD
officials who later won contracts as developers of rehabilitation
projects.
   The consultants _ who charged fees up to $1.3 million _ included
President Reagan's first interior secretary, James Watt; the late
John Mitchell, attorney general under President Nixon; former
Republican Sen. Ed Brooke of Massachusetts, and former Kentucky
Gov. Louis Nunn, also a Republican.
   Adams, in an interview Thursday, said that while he had found no
illegality or criminal activity in the investigation into HUD's
Moderate Rehabilitation Program, contracts had been distributed in
ways that suggested favoritism and insider information was used to
direct HUD awards for projects.
   Money for over half the units audited went to just 10 states,
who by HUD formula were fairly entitled only 16 percent.
   Adams said he had turned over the 700-page investigative report
to the Justice Department's public integrity branch for review.
   The rehab program is a $225 million a year endeavor that has
survived in Congress despite efforts by the Reagan administration
to kill it. Through it, developers win contracts to acquire and
renovate existing housing and receive HUD guarantees of subsidized
rents for 15 years.
   Adams said in a memo to HUD Secretary Jack Kemp that developers
and local public housing agencies ``were led to believe the
consultants enjoyed a special relationship with persons making
recommendations and decisions.''
   Interviews with housing officials suggested favoritism in the
program was widely suspected.
   ``This is not news to me; it was suspected,'' said Gordon
Cavanaugh, attorney for the Council of Large Public Housing
Authorities.
   One HUD official, speaking only on the condition of anonymity,
said, ``This was the road to the gravy train _ you come in here and
work a few years and then get out and make millions in mod-rehab.''
   Addressing the Pentagon purchasing scandal, Adams said in his
memo:
   ``In Defense, the contractors were paying consultants to obtain
information to influence contract awards. At HUD, the developers
were paying consultants to influence awards of moderate
rehabilitation units to public housing authorities.
   ``The difference between the two situations is that the
investigation at Defense was able to prove that the consultants
paid government employees for information and for selecting a
particular contractor. Our investigation at HUD was unable to
substantiate that government employees received any financial
consideration from the consultants.''
   Adams' report questioned the role of Thomas T. Demery, the
former assistant secretary and federal housing commissioner, who
was responsible for the program's beginning in 1986. The
investigation looked into contracts going back to 1984.
   Investigators found that a nonprofit charity, FOOD for Africa,
which Demery headed before joining HUD, received $290,000 from
recipients of HUD contracts under the program. Efforts to locate
Demery were unsuccessful Thursday.
   Kemp, expressing shock at the ``fundamental flaws'' and
mismanagement revealed by the investigation, ordered a halt to 35
pending awards worth $100 million, his aide, Mary Brunette, said
Thursday. Eight contracts already executed in the current fiscal
year will be allowed to continue but will be audited, as will
nearly 300 existing contracts.
   Investigators found nearly $59 million in excess subsidies paid
by HUD and said if the pattern existed throughout the program, the
figure would reach $413 million.
   On Capitol Hill, the House Banking chairman, Rep. Henry B.
Gonzales, D-Texas, said the report showed the program ``was misused
to feather the financial nest of HUD and (Reagan) administration
favorites.''
   He praised Kemp's actions, announced intentions to hold hearings
on the investigation and said he would ask the Office of Government
Ethics to examine the reports on former HUD officials.
   Adams' report named 11 former HUD officials who participated in
project contracts as developers and owners, consultants, or
representatives of lenders.
   Among them was former Under Secretary Philip Abrams and former
Assistant Secretary for Housing Philip Winn. Both were presidential
appointees under then-HUD Secretary Samuel Pierce, and later became
owner-developers in half a dozen rehabilitation projects.
   Winn is now the U.S. ambassador to Switzerland; efforts to reach
him through the State Department were unsuccessful.
   Abrams did not return a reporter's call to his Colorado office.
   Others included Joseph Strauss, a former special assistant to
Pierce, who the report said collected $1.3 million in consultant
fees on such projects. Pierce's one-time executive assistant, Lance
Wilson, was identified as an owner-developer in six projects.
   Watt collected a $300,000 fee as a consultant on a 312-unit
project in Essex, Md. Investigators reported that he ``said that
his role was to talk to the `right people' and convice them that
the project was needed,'' the report said.
   It said Nunn was paid $375,000 as attorney and consultant on a
1984 Miami project in which he in turn paid Mitchell $75,000 for
his assistance.
   ``Nunn claimed Mitchell told him he had HUD contacts from the
top on down, because he and (Pierce) ... were friends,'' the report
said. Pierce told investigators that he knew Mitchell but that
Mitchell had never discussed HUD matters with him.
   Brooke was paid $183,000 as consultant, most of that in a Lynn,
Mass., deal. Also named as a consultant who received $260,000 in
fees was Frederick Bush, no relation to the president, who has been
nominated as ambassador to Luxembourg.
   Calls to Watt, Nunn and Brooke were not immediately returned.

<HEAD>Honecker: 11,500 Soldiers To Be Employed In Economy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Communist Party leader Erich Honecker said
Thursday that East Germany will reduce its armed forces by 11,500
men and assign them to jobs in the economy.
   The state-run news agency ADN said Honecker described the move
as a gesture of good will. It comes in addition to cuts of 10,000
men, 600 tanks and 50 planes announced in January.
   Honecker made the announcement during talks in East Berlin with
Ernst Albrecht, governor of the West German state of Lower Saxony.
Albrecht, at a news conference, later confirmed the ADN report.
   ADN said 11,500 men will spend three months receiving basic
military training and will then be sent to different jobs in the
economy for the remainder of their obligatory 15-month service.
   The agency did not specify when the cuts will be implemented and
did not say in which economic sectors the future recruits would be
employed.
   According to Western estimates, East Germany has about 175,000
men under arms.
   When he announced the troop and equipment cuts in January,
Honecker also said the country would reduce its military budget by
10 percent. ADN said the reductions will begin on Friday and will
be completed by 1990.

<HEAD>State Department Blasts Panama For Detaining U.S. Reporter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department criticized the government
of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega of Panama on Thursday for detaining
an American reporter who allegedly passed a dollar that had
anti-Noriega slogans on it.
   Spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said Charles Lane, a Newsweek
reporter based in El Salvador, was taken into custody Wednesday and
held for several hours by the Panama Defense Forces. He was
unharmed.
   ``At no time were there any charges against Mr. Lane,'' Ms.
Tutwiler said, calling the incident ``a typical instance of an
absence of political freedom and basic civil liberties in Panama.''
   She said the Panamanians staged a ``deliberate effort to
intimidate an independent journalist in the context of a national
election which Gen. Noriega would have the world believe will
represent the free expression of the will of the people of Panama,
its domestic opponents and those able to give a true picture of the
Noriega regime to the world.''
   Presidential elections are scheduled in Panama for May 7.
   Bob Rivard, chief of correspondents for Newsweek, said in a
telephone interview from New York that Lane had been held for six
hours and interrogated several times.
   ``The editors of Newsweek regard Chuck's detention as
unwarranted and a very cynical exercise on the part of the
military,'' Rivard said. ``He had done nothing wrong.''

<HEAD>House Democrats Ask Reconsideration of Naval Strategic Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House Democrats concerned about a naval
strategic modernization plan's compatability with a U.S.-Soviet
arms control treaty sent a letter Thursday to President Bush urging
him to review the proposal.
   Navy officials have told Congress they want a force of at least
20 Trident submarines equipped with a high number of missile tubes
_ 24 _ rather than more submarines with fewer tubes.
   In the letter, the lawmakers asked for a better plan ``in order
to maintain a robust naval strategic fleet _ and strengthen our
current arms control negotiating posture.''
   ``Under the scenarios proposed to Congress, the Navy would
retain over 4,000 strategic warheads,'' the lawmakers said.
``However, the proposals _ or the Trident's missile tube
configuration _ may need to be revised.''
   Former President Reagan and Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev agreed to limit each country to 4,900 ballistic missile
warheads. Under a U.S.-Soviet strategic arms reduction treaty, the
Navy plan would leave fewer than 900 warheads for land-based
missiles, the lawmakers said.
   ``If we continue to procure one Trident per year, as currently
configured, we may end up buying Tridents in excess of those we
would deploy under START,'' the letter also says. ``This may force
premature retirements of one or more Tridents _ forfeiting a
multibillion-dollar expenditure.''
   Among the possible options, the letter suggests, is redesign of
the Trident to carry fewer missile tubes, research on a smaller
strategic submarine or slowing down production of the Trident.
   ``I am concerned that the Navy may be going down a blind alley
with its strategic modernization plan,'' said Rep. Tom Foglietta,
D-Pa., one of the signees of the letter. ``It appears incompatible
with the current arms control framework.''
   Rep. Charles Bennett, D-Fla., chairman of the House Armed
Services seapower subcommittee, raised the issue with the deputy
chief of naval operations for plans, policy and operations at a
congressional hearing.
   Vice Adm. Charles R. Larson said the Trident gives the Navy the
necessary flexibility and survivability, and another witness _
Robert G. Joseph, deputy assistant secretary of defense for nuclear
forces and arms control policy _ cautioned against strategy based
on a U.S.-Soviet treaty.
   ``The last thing we want to do now is act as if we have an
agreement in START,'' Joseph said.
   In addition to Foglietta, the House members who signed the
letter were Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the Armed Services
Committee; John M. Spratt, D-S.C., Ronald Dellums, D-Calif.;
Nicholas Mavroules, D-Mass.; Barbara Boxer, D-Calif.; Albert G.
Bustamante, D-Texas; and Martin Olav Sabo, D-Minn.

<HEAD>Some High School Seniors Sabotage State Test</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Kelle in 13th graf is correct.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TORRANCE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Seniors at a high-achieving high school
sabotaged their answers on a test that measures the school's
academic quality, and one said the diminished scores were a
rebellion against pressure to perform.
   Administrators at West High School denied there was too much
pressure, and a spokeswoman for the State Department of Education
suggested that dragging down the school's score on the California
Assessment Test may have been sparked by something else.
   ``I think it would be interesting to know what else is going on
at that campus. The last time this happened at a school a few years
ago, students were mad at the administration for putting speed
bumps in the parking lot,'' said state Department of Education
spokeswoman Susie Lange.
   She said officials at the education department's testing office
have talked to the school, and said there was no chance of getting
a second test.
   The results are used to determine a school's academic placement
compared to other schools in the state. The results are published
in newspapers and are considered by the state for achievement
awards and grants. Home buyers use the results when a good school
district is a consideration.
   Reading scores at West High School dropped from the 85th
percentile statewide last year to the 51st percentile this year and
math scores fell from the 95th percentile in 1987-88 to 71st
percentile this year.
   ``We thought that it was the wrong high school,'' said Principal
William Bawden. ``And then we got some rumors that maybe some of
the seniors had sabotaged the test.''
   He said a check of students' test booklets, which are not
signed, showed an unusual number of wrong answers in 18 booklets,
including some booklets that contained no right answers. Bawden
said one student admitted deliberately doing badly on the test. He
denied extraordinary pressure was placed on students to do well.
   Bill Franchini, head of the Torrance Teacher Association, said
Thursday he had talked to teachers at West High School in this Los
Angeles suburb, and said he was unaware of any extra problems or
pressure that would have caused the sabotage.
   But Franchini said the CAP test is a ripe target for angry
students, since names are not on the tests and the results are
averaged for the entire school.
   ``A lot of these seniors have been tested, perhaps over
tested,'' said Franchini. ``They have the California Test of Basic
Skills, the Scholastic Aptitude Test, and various achievement
tests. They are tested, tested, tested. So when this one comes
along and it doesn't have their name on it, they may think `Well,
so what?'''
   Student body President Kelle Price said Tuesday some seniors
became disgruntled when teachers interrupted classes to prepare
students for the test and when administrators visited classes
stressing the importance of doing well.
   ``They said this is the test that is the school's report card,''
said Ms. Price, ``and West is a really good school and that we all
want to keep it up. I think a lot of people resented that.'' She
said she did not participate in the sabotage.
   Franchini disagreed with Ms. Price's allegation that
extraordinary pressure was brought on students.
   Lange said the last time a test was sabotaged was in 1984-85,
when CAP scores were tied to state cash bonuses to the schools.
That program has been cancelled. She said the students at one
school said they would do poorly on the test to protest speed bumps
placed in their parking lot.
   ``The damage is done,'' she said of the results at West. ``It's
not hurting them, its hurting their younger brothers and sisters.
They have broken the school's trend.''

<HEAD>Changes in Physicians' Reimbursement Will Be Recommended</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An independent government agency that monitors
the Medicare program will submit a report to Congress on Friday
urging change in the way the program pays physicians to make the
system more fair and to help cut soaring costs.
   The Physician Payment Review Commission recommends a uniform fee
structure that would be based on the actual costs of providing
services. Fees would be set at national rates for the 7,000 medical
services covered by Medicare, and the rates would be adjusted to
reflect geographical cost differences.
   Currently, Medicare pays physicians based on what they and other
doctors in their area customarily charge, a system that critics say
is neither fair nor efficient.
   The current system pays less for ``evaluation and management
services'' _ typically provided by family practice and internal
medicine physicians _ than for surgical and other invasive
procedures relative to the time and effort required of the doctor.
   Under the payment system the commission proposes, fees would be
raised for family practitioners and lowered for many specialty
physicians, including surgeons and ophthalmologists.
   The proposed system would be based on a plan developed by the
Harvard University School of Public Health. That plan sets fees for
services based on the costs of a doctor's education, training and
equipment as well as the mental and physical effort and technical
skill and judgment required of the physician.
   The commission also proposes to limit the amount physicians can
charge Medicare patients for a service beyond the amount approved
by Medicare.
   Medicare has been one of the fastest growing sections of the
federal budget, with last year's expenditures rising more than 15
percent over the preceding year.
   Much of the increase in Medicare outlays for physicians'
services has come from an increase in the volume of services
provided, according to the commission's report. From 1980 to 1988,
the number of services provided per Medicare enrollees has
increased by 7 percent per year, the report said.
   The report says many of these services have little or no benefit
to patients. The commission calls for more research on the
effectiveness of medical services and the development of guidelines
to reduce the use of procedures that have minimal benefit, and thus
cut Medicare costs.
   The commission's plan also proposes to set expenditure targets
based on estimates of inflation and growth in beneficiaries and
services. These would work as incentives for physicians, the
commission said. If expenditures come in at the target one year,
the next year's physicians' fees would be increased at the rate of
inflation. If expenditures exceeded the target, physicians' fees
would be increased by the rate of inflation minus the amount
exceeding the target. Conversely, if expenditures were under the
target, fees would be increased by inflation plus the amount under
target.
   ``It's a mechanism for gaining control over the growth in
spending and to provide the financial incentives for physicians to
take more seriously the need to control the volume of services,''
said Lauren LeRoy, commission deputy director.

<TEXT>
   A crowd of more than 5,000, mostly
schoolchildren, chanted and sang political songs as they marched
six miles behind a U.N. convoy carrying released SWAPO guerrillas
toward the border Thursday.
   The crowd began gathering at dawn at Ongwediva Lutheran mission
station, where 31 guerillas spent the night after greeting streams
of Namibian peasants who came to see them and participate in a
church service.
   Most black schools in the area around the garrison town of
Oshakati were closed Thursday as the students marched.
   U.N. police monitors watched the procession, which grew larger
as it progressed. South-West African police were barely visible,
and army patrols were non-existent. The South African-controlled
military was restricted to base from Wednesday to Saturday to allow
the estimated 600 guerrillas in the territory a safe route to the
border.
   The South-West African People's Organization guerrillas
endangered a U.N. independence plan for Namibia when they crossed
the border from Angola on April 1. Under the plan, they were to
wait in their Angolan bases until mid-May when they were to return,
unarmed, as refugees to take part in November elections.
   South African-controlled military forces, which had been
confined to base in accordance with the plan, were released to
fight the SWAPO incursion. According to Namibia
Administrator-General Louis Pienaar, the battles caused the deaths
of 305 infiltrators and 27 security force members.
   The United Nations said Thursday at Windhoek, the territorial
capital, that 3,941 military personnel from 21 countries are
deployed in Namibia to help monitor the transition to independence.
   The South African military on Wednesday turned over to the
United Nations 31 guerrillas captured in the fighting.
   At midday Thursday, 28 of them walked across the border at
Ruacana and got into trucks to carry them to their bases 100 miles
to the north, a territorial official said. Three injured fighters
were taken elsewhere to recuperate.
   The United Nations is supervising a transition period and
elections aimed at ending South Africa's 74-year rule over Namibia.
   The independence plan is tied to a southern Africa peace
agreement that provides for withdrawal of South African and Cuban
forces from Angola.
   American, Soviet, Angolan, Cuban and South African delegations
met Thursday in Cape Town, South Africa, to discuss developments.
   ``This is perhaps the most serious meeting the joint commission
has faced so far,'' South African Foreign Minister Pik Botha said
in welcoming the delegates. `` Since we last met ... in Namibia we
tried our best, all of us, to deal with the serious problem that
has arisen as a result of SWPAO's incursion and violations.''
   The meeting represents the first time in decades that Soviets,
Angolans and Cubans have made an official visit to South Africa,
since relations were broken over the country's laws of apartheid _
racial separation.
   Bishop Cleopas Dumeni, the head of the Evangelical Lutheran
Church in Namibia who conducted church services at the Ongwediva
mission Wednesday evening and Thursday morning, suffered the loss
of a son killed by security forces and a daughter killed by a bomb
explosion blamed on SWAPO during the 23-year bush war.
   He told the SWAPO fighters, ``They (the villagers) have come to
see you and admire you. The coming of the group here shows that
they appreciate your great sacrifice.''
   Some of the guerrillas greeted family members they had not seen
for five to 13 years.

<HEAD>Rowny Challenges Soviets On Arms Control</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Diplomatic Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Edward L. Rowny, a senior U.S. arms control
adviser, accused the Soviet Union on Thursday of seeking military
advantage even as it appeals to public opinion seeking arms
reductions.
   Rowny said in a speech prepared for delivery in San Antonio the
Soviets ``play to the grandstand of public opinion while masking
their own very real efforts to achieve military advantage.''
   The former U.S. negotiator, who advises President Bush and
Secretary of State James A. Baker III on arms control issues, said
the Soviets were trying to promote a positive image in the West and
divide the NATO alliance at the same time.
   In the speech to the National War College Alumni Association,
Rowny challenged Soviet sincerity on withdrawing tanks from Eastern
Europe and on the issue of short-range nuclear missiles.
   While Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said in January that
none of the 10,000 tanks to be withdrawn would remain in the Soviet
military inventory, Rowny quoted Gen. B.V. Snetkov, the Soviet
commander in East Germany, as saying last week that some of the
tanks would remain in the Soviet arsenal.
   On short-range missiles, Rowny accused the Soviets of
propaganda. He said while Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze
has objected to improving NATO's weapons the Soviets have been
modernizing their own missiles for a decade.
   Rowny said the Soviets are replacing the SS-23 missiles banned
by the U.S.-Soviet Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty with
SCUDs that have a range of 300 miles and have been replacing FROG
missiles with SS-21s with potentially greater range and accuracy.
   The Warsaw Pact has an advantage of at least 16 to 1 over the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization in missiles below the range of
315 miles, Rowny said.
   Within the NATO alliance, West Germany is resisting U.S. efforts
to extend the range of Lance missiles and has called for U.S.
negotiations with the Soviets to scale back such weapons. The Bush
administration, with support from Britain and France, has rejected
the West German overture.
   ``On this issue,'' Rowny said, ``the Soviets have created a
credibility gap so wide one could drive a tank through it.''
   He said the Soviets have tried to make arms control the main
focus of their relations with the United States because they
believe that serves Soviet interests.
   ``Preoccupation with arms control diverts attention from the
critical underlying causes of East-West tension which the Soviets
cleary recognize __ the differences in the values of our respective
social systems,'' Rowny said.

<HEAD>Study Says Conservation Could Cut Billions From Utility Bills</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An aggressive conservation effort by electric
power companies could sharply reduce consumers' utility bills and
save the companies millions of dollars in pollution-control costs,
according to a study released Thursday.
   The Center for Clean Air Policy, a Washington-based think tank,
said its 18-month study showed that cutting electricity use would
help both consumers and the utilities, as well as reduce carbon
dioxide emissions by substantial amounts.
   Fossil fuels burned in power plants and by other energy
producers are blamed for the release of large amounts of carbon
dioxide, which is considered to be a major contributor to global
warming.
   The study focused on potential savings to two of the nation's
largest electric utility systems _ the Tennessee Valley Authority
and the American Electric Power Co. of Columbus, Ohio.
   A 7 percent cut in electricity sales by American Electric by the
year 2000 would reduce by 26 percent, or $51 million, the amount it
would have to pay for pollution controls over that period.
   A 10 percent drop in sales by TVA over the same period would
reduce its pollution control costs by 55 percent, or $77 million,
the study said.
   These energy conservation programs would save American
Electric's customers $1.23 billion over the next 30 years, the
study said. TVA's customers would save $891 million over the same
period. The savings are based in part on the assumption that lower
demand would preclude the need for the utilities to invest in new
generation capacity.
   ``It's time we started addressing our basic environmental
problems through approaches like energy conservation which
eliminate pollution rather than just moving it from the air into
the ground or water,'' said Tony Earl, the study group's chairman.

<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration said Thursday
it will allow a potentially promising new AIDS drug to be tested on
people infected with the deadly virus.
   Researchers say the drug, known as GLQ223, is unique because it
appears to kill only those immune system cells that are infected
with the AIDS virus, leaving non-infected cells alone.
   However, they caution that the drug so far has been tested only
in the laboratory and has not been used on AIDS patients.
   ``I'm very optimistic because of the test tube results, but
there's always the possibility it could have unpredictable side
effects or when given to humans the drug may not be able to get to
all the infected cells,'' said Dr. Michael McGrath of the
University of California in San Francisco and San Francisco General
Hospital.
   McGrath led a team of scientists from UCSF, the Chinese
University of Hong Kong and Genelabs of Redwood City, Calif., that
developed GLQ223.
   The drug is a highly purified form of the plant protein
trichosanthin, which is derived from the root of a Chinese cucumber
plant. The plant extract has been used in China to induce abortions.
   In the laboratory, the drug has been found to work on two
different types of cells crucial to the normal functioning of the
immune system _ T-cells and macrophage cells, which act as a
reservoir for the virus.
   AZT, the only drug now licensed for treatment of AIDS, and other
drugs like it only prevent the virus from replicating in T-cells.
   David Corkery, a spokesman for the American Foundation for AIDS
Research, called the drug ``very promising,'' and said he is
``cautiously optimistic'' about its prospects.
   Genelabs said Thursday the clinical trials are expected to begin
in May at San Francisco General Hospital, primarily to determine
safety and human tolerance of the drug. McGrath said the trials are
expected to last three to six months.
   If a safe dosage can be determined, then trials would be
conducted on the effectiveness of the drug.
   Genelabs also cautioned that though GLQ223's active ingredient
is found in some Chinese herbal medicines, ``such preparations may
also contain other components with unknown toxic effects.''
   Also, the company said that since the toxicity of trichosanthin
itself has not been evaluated in AIDS patients, it ``cautions
against the use of trichosanthin or trichosanthin-containing
preparations as an AIDS therapy.''
   The drug is being developed with money from the Swiss chemical
and pharmaceutical company Sandoz Ltd., which would have rights to
market it.

<HEAD>USDA Approves Field Testing of Two Potato Varieties</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Agriculture Department said Thursday it
has approved a request for the first field testing of two
genetically altered potato varieties which could be resistant to
three destructive plant viruses.
   A permit to conduct the test was approved for Monsanto
Agricultural Co., St. Louis, Mo., said James W. Glosser,
administrator of the department's Animal and Plant Health
Inspection Service.
   Glosser said the field testing of both disease-resistant
varieties will begin later this month near Jersey, Ill., and that
one of the varieties also will be tested in Nampa, Idaho.
   ``The experimental design of these trials is sound and should
provide important scientific data without causing any significant
impact on the environment,'' he said.
   Three disease-causing organisms _ leaf roll virus, virus x and
virus y _ infect potato crops, causing yellowing and stunting of
plants, Glosser said. Depending on conditions, the viruses can
cause a 5 percent to 10 percent yield loss, or more, as well as a
drop in product quality.
   The Monsanto potato varieties were developed by taking genetic
material from the viruses and inserting it into the potato. In
greenhouse studies, the company found that the material produced
proteins in the potatoes, which protected them from disease.
   In a related development, the department's Agricultural Research
Service said the first outdoor test of cotton genetically
engineered to kill caterpillar pests began on Thursday. The cotton
project was announced two weeks ago.
   The new cotton variety is being tested on a one-acre site at
Mississippi State University, Starkville, Miss.
   A gene from a common bacterium, Bacillus thuringienensis, was
inserted into the cotton plant. The gene produces a protein that is
toxic to caterpillar-type insects but not to humans.
   The cotton was engineered by scientists at Agracetus Inc.,
Middleton, Wis. If successful, the new variety could protect itself
against such pests as the bollworm, tobacco budworm and armyworm.

<HEAD>Newspaper: Police Spirited Rushdie Away From Dinner Party</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Novelist Salman Rushdie, in hiding under death
threats from Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, was spirited away
from a dinner by police worried about Moslem students nearby, a
newspaper said Thursday.
   The Daily Mail said Rushdie was attending a private dinner party
with professors at an Oxford University college.
   It said detectives spotted Moslem students near the college and
``fearing an attempt on his life, the officers interrupted the
author during the party with dons (instructors) and spirited him
out of a side entrance.''
   The paper said Rushdie was driven away in an armored car, and
officers worried whether a security lapse had led to details of the
party leaking out.
   The Mail did not say when the reported incident occurred, and
police declined comment. The office of Rushdie's agent, Gillon
Aitken, who acts as his spokesman, did not return a phone call.
   Rushdie went into hiding 10 weeks ago after Khomeini ruled that
his novel, ``The Satanic Verses,'' blasphemed Islam and ordered
Moslems to find him and kill him.
   Many Moslems contend the book is blasphemous because it includes
a scene in which prostitutes take the names of the prophet
Mohammed's wives, and it suggests Mohammed wrote the holy Koran
instead of receiving it from Allah.
   On Wednesday night, five Moslem women protesting a new play
defending the right of Rushdie and other writers to freedom of
expression invaded the stage at London's Royal Court Theater and
halted the performance for 10 minutes.
   The one-act play, ``Iranian Nights,'' was nearly over when the
women staged their peaceful protest, a theater spokesman said on
condition of anonymity.
   Attendants escorted the women off the stage and out of the
theater, and the play resumed without further interruption. No
arrests were made.
   The play is by dramatist Howard Brenton and Tariq Ali, a
well-known left-wing student activist in London in the 1960s. It
covers issues raised by the events surrounding Rushdie and ``The
Satanic Verses.''
   The Times of London, meanwhile, quoted Rushdie's agent Aitken
Thursday as saying he believed Rushdie was eager for his book to be
published in paperback toward the end of the year, despite warnings
from Moslem leaders in Britain that it would inflame the
controversy.
   Aitken was quoted as saying there had been little discussion
with Rushdie about paperback publication, but ``I think he is keen
that this book should be published in the way that his other books
have been published.''
   Viking Penguin, Rushdie's hardcover and paperback publisher,
said there were no plans at this stage for a paperback edition.
   The Times said Rushdie telephones Aitken at his office about
twice a week to discuss the book's sales.
   On March 17, Iran broke diplomatic ties with Britain after
British Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe defended Rushdie's
right to freedom of speech and to publish his book.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's government subsequently
ordered the expulsion of 18 Iranians from Britain, saying they were
perceived as a security threat. Iran retaliated by ordering 18
Britons either to be expelled from Iran or not allowed back into
Britain.
   In Barcelona, Spain, 18 companies said Thursday they planned to
jointly publish a Spanish edition of ``The Satanic Verses.''

<HEAD>Anti-Baldness Drug Works on Growth Genes, Upjohn Researchers Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM BOVEE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The anti-balding drug minoxidil promotes hair
growth apparently by affecting gene activity, a finding with
implications for the treatment of genetic disorders, Upjohn Co.
researchers said Thursday.
   Minoxidil has been marketed by Upjohn under the trade name
Rogaine since its approval by federal regulators in September, but
the way the drug makes hair grow has been poorly understood.
   Researchers had previously suggested the drug stimulated the
flow of blood to the scalp and hair roots, thereby promoting growth.
   ``Our experiments do not negate the blood-flow hypothesis, but
they do demonstrate that the drug directly enhances growth and
maturation of cells that form hair shafts,'' said Allen Buhl, an
Upjohn researcher.
   Knowledge of growth gained from study of minoxidil's effects on
cell growth could have implications for research into genetically
based diseases, such as sickle-cell anemia, Buhl said, although
some scientists voiced skepticism about that contention.
   Minoxidil was originally developed for internal use as a
treatment for high blood pressure. As an anti-balding drug, it is
applied externally to the scalp.
   Vincent Groppi Jr., another Upjohn researcher, said minoxidil
was applied to whiskers removed from mice and placed in cultures in
a petri dish. Other whiskers were left untreated as a control on
the experiment.
   After three days, hair treated with minoxidil had grown, while
the untreated hair had not.
   Further work showed that the minoxidil ``not only affects
growing cells, but affects cells that make hair-shaft protein,''
Groppi said. ``Minoxidil affects gene activity that affects the
growth of the (hair) shaft.''
   Another scientist, however, was skeptical that the Upjohn
finding represented a significant advance.
   ``Within our cells, we have between 50,000 and 100,000 genes,
and many of those genes, probably at least several thousand, are
poised to respond to the effects of different kinds of
stimulants,'' said Robert Weinberg, biology professor at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, Mass. ``It
would be rare for a physiological stimulant, including this drug,
not to affect the expression of one or another gene.''
   Although the drug may affect hair follicles, there is no reason
to believe that the drug would have similar affects on other types
of cells, Weinberg said.
   Weinberg said the research would have been more compelling had
it identified a specific gene or group of genes affected by the
drug. Upjohn spokeswoman Kaye Bennett said in Kalamazoo, Mich.,
that the researchers hadn't identified a specific gene.
   Weinberg also cautioned against concluding that effects on hair
in a culture would also be seen on hair growing in tissue, such as
on the scalp.
   ``In a culture, it is meaningless because cells in culture
behave differently than when they are sitting in tissue,'' Weinberg
said.
   Upjohn's Bennett said that although the research was performed
on hair in cultures, ``we do feel that what we're looking at here
is an accurate indication of the effectiveness of minoxidil.''
   The Upjohn research was abstracted in the May issue of the
Journal for Investigative Dermatology and was to be presented in
full Saturday at the annual meeting of the Society for
Investigative Dermatology.

   An Arab League delegation failed Thursday to
persuade Secretary of State James A. Baker III to reopen the
Palestine Liberation Organization office here.
   ``There is no change in our policy,'' a State Department
official said after the 45-minute meeting.
   Clovis Maksoud, the Arab League's representative here, said he
had ``the impression'' Baker was not opposed to reopening the
office. ``But he wants to have the proper timing and the proper
circumstances,'' Maksoud told reporters.
   The office was closed in March 1988 after Congress declared the
PLO a terrorist organization. Since then, however, the United
States has held a series of meetings with the PLO and is seeking
its support for Mideast peace talks.
   Maksoud said the Arab delegation told Baker the office should be
reopened in light of the talks begun by the Reagan administration
in December.
   However, a State Department official, who spoke to a reporter on
condition of anonymity, said no change was contemplated.
   The delegation also disagreed with Baker on a proposal by
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir to have Palestinian Arabs on
the West Bank and in Gaza elect leaders to negotiate an interim
self-rule arrangement.
   President Bush and Baker have endorsed the proposal as a useful
and encouraging step toward an Arab-Israeli settlement.
   But Maksoud said it was an attempt by Israel ``to frustrate the
international outrage concerning the practices of Israel in the
occupied territories.''
   He called the proposal ``a charade'' designed to undermine the
PLO, which the Arab League has declared the only legitimate
representative of Palestinians.
   On a third point, there was apparent agreement.
   Maksoud and Ambassadors Saud al-Sabah of Kuwait and Mohsin A.
Alaini of North Yemen described to Baker a plan by the Arab League
to enforce a cease-fire in Lebanon with soldiers from several Arab
countries.
   Maksoud said Baker ``expressed appreciation'' for the league's
efforts, while the U.S. official said Baker had ``restated strong
support'' for the peace initiative and a need for a cease-fire.
   The country is torn by warfare between Christian and Moslem
factions, with 40,000 Syrian troops playing a dominant role in much
of the country.

<HEAD>Congressman: Ethiopian President Favors Reunification Of Jews</HEAD>

   Ethiopia's president is willing to allow
Ethiopian Jews to emigrate and rejoin families from whom they have
been separated since a secret airlift to Israel was halted, a
congressman said Thursday.
   Rep. Mickey Leland, D-Texas, the chairman of the House Select
Committee on Hunger, said he received the assurances of President
Mengistu Haile Mariam at a meeting in Addis Ababa during Congress'
Easter recess.
   Leland also defended Ethiopia's role in efforts to deliver
emergency food supplies to thousands of starving people in
rebel-held southern Sudan.
   While acknowledging that Ethiopia wasn't working with the United
Nations relief efforts, Leland claimed they were taking other steps
to help get food across the border before the rainy season arrives
in May and makes roads impassable.
   ``Recognition of Ethiopia's cooperation in the urgent
humanitarian mission to save the people of southern Sudan is
imperative to future efforts towards establishing peace throughout
the Horn of Africa,'' Leland told a news conference.
   Leland said some news reports have unfairly painted
Soviet-backed Ethiopia as a ``villain'' in the emergency relief
effort to supply food to Sudanese people caught in the country's
civil war.
   Although Ethiopia is not working with the U.N. ``Operation
Lifeline,'' Leland said 5,000 to 7,000 metric tons of food is en
route to Sudan under a joint relief program of private, voluntary
and church organizations headquartered in the capital of Addis
Ababa.
   Roughly 120 trucks are needed for the joint-relief effort
separate from the UN's mission, and Leland said Ethiopia is
providing at least half of those vehicles.
   ``They are allowing for cross-border operations to happen, just
not under the auspices of the UN,'' said Leland, who also visited
Sudan to assess the situation. ``When it comes to feeding the
hungry, we should not take potshots because (Ethiopia) doesn't
agree with us ideologically.''
   On the issue of Ethiopian Jews, Leland said in an interview that
Mengistu assured him recently in that he is committed to ``family
reunification'' and that the issue is ``a project we can work on
mutually.''
   ``There are families who are being reunited,'' Leland said.
``The Ethiopian government has been forthcoming about allowing
families to be reunified and I expect more of that will be realized
as time goes on.''
   Like the Soviet Union, Ethiopia restricts the emigration of its
people.
   More than 10,000 Ethiopian Jews remain in what Leland said is
the poorest country in the world, peasants who were left behind
after an exodus in the late 1970s and early 1980s.
   Between November 1984 and the first days of 1985, an estimated
7,000 Ethiopian Jews were airlifted to Israel, joining about 6,000
who had made their way to Israel earlier, before Ethiopia imposed
emigration restrictions.
   The secret operation in late 1984 was stopped when the Belgian
charter company flying the refugees to Israel through Europe balked
at the publicity in the international press.
   The Ethiopian Jews trace their roots in Judaism back 2,600
years. American Jews have supported efforts to bring the Ethiopian
Jews to Israel.
   Leland said he did not ask Mengistu for any numbers on how many
Ethiopian Jews had been reunited with their families in Israel and
elsewhere in the world.

<HEAD>Owner of Holiday Spas Agrees Not to Discriminate</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   U.S. Health Inc. accepted a consent order
Thursday to settle allegations it discouraged blacks from joining
the 40 Holiday Spa health clubs it operates in five East Coast
metropolitan areas.
   In a settlement approved by a federal judge, the Towson,
Md.-based company did not admit or deny any of the allegations. It
accepted the consent order, negotiated with Justice Department
attorneys who filed the lawsuit on Feb. 10, enjoining any
discrimination by Holiday Spas.
   In the settlement, the company agreed to show black people in
advertising and to include a statement that it does not
discriminate against minorities.
   The consent order, approved by U.S. District Judge John H.
Pratt, also directs the company to give blacks who may have been
turned away another opportunity to join the club.
   The company operates 40 health clubs in the Washington, Boston
Philadelphia, Baltimore and Atlanta metropolitan areas.
   James Turner, acting assistant attorney general for civil
rights, said in a statement the case ``was resolved quickly because
there was absolutely no reason, no excuse and no defense in how
these defendants were conducting business decades after these
anti-discrimination laws went into effect.''
   Turner noted that the consent order contains an ``elaborate
procedure to ensure that all personnel of the company from top
executives through individual club employees, receive comprehensive
training in the subject of racial fairness.''
   In a press release, read by Washington attorney Basil J.
Mezines, the company said it ``did not admit any of the allegations
in the original complaint, agree to any fines or the legal
contentions'' made by the Justice Department.
   The statement quoted Barry Mandel, Holiday's vice president, as
saying: ``We at Holiday have never discriminated against any
prospective member or a member and our clubs are open to all who
comport themselves in accepted manners.''
   The consent order said it was ``not to be considered in any way
an admission or finding of any discrimination'' by the company.
   But it contained a statement of evidence the Justice Department
would have produced at trial, including a summary of testimony from
black applicants who would have said they were not told of the
least expensive membership packages or the most favorable loan
rates.
   Former employees were prepared to testify that they were
instructed to tell black applicants that no one was available to
give them tours of the health clubs, the statement said.
   Black members would have testified that they received rude
treatment from club employees. ``Former employees would testify
that black members were treated in this manner to discourage them
from utilizing the club facilities and to discourage them from
recommending the club to other black persons,'' the statement said.
   Former employees were also prepared to testify they were
reprimanded by club managers for selling memberships to blacks and
that they often did not receive commissions for these sales.

<HEAD>Unions Ask Congressman To Ax Random Testing From Railroad-Drug Use
Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHERINE RIZZO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Random drug testing is ``nothing more than
looking for a needle in a haystack'' and isn't necessary to prevent
drug- and alcohol-related train accidents, railroad unions told
Congress on Thursday.
   The unions told Rep. Thomas Luken, D-Ohio, he could accomplish
his goal of safer railways without making workers go through
unnecessary tests.
   ``There comes a point where enough is enough,'' said James
Kennedy Jr. of the Railway Labor Executives' Association, which
represents 17 unions.
   ``Rail workers now are subjected to numerous potential alcohol
and drug tests each year,'' he said in testimony to the House
Transportation and Hazardous Materials Subcommittee.
   New employees are screened for drugs before they're hired, he
said. Once on the job, workers are tested after accidents, during
physicals, when they return to work after illnesses and when
there's some suspicion of impairment.
   A bill proposed by Luken would require drug testing of all
railroad workers with ``safety sensitive'' jobs, set standards for
the labs that do the testing and require that railroads maintain
rehabilitation programs.
   The Supreme Court ruled March 21 that the Federal Railroad
Administration's current drug-testing regulations are
constitutional.
   The random drug-testing allowed under the Supreme Court decision
would be limited under Luken's bill.
   S. Mark Lindsey, the FRA's chief counsel, told the subcommittee
the bill would ``set in concrete'' some testing options that
``could far exceed actual safety needs.''
   The administration favors no changes to the policies supported
by the high court, he said.
   United Transportation Union President Fred Hardin said he feared
mandatory random drug and alcohol testing would give railroads an
excuse to cancel costly rehabilitation programs.
   Hardin compared rail workers to long-haul independent truckers.
   ``There are thousands of `gypsy' truck drivers operating their
trucks over our nation's highways utilizing medicinal aids to stay
awake and continue driving their trucks for unrealistic periods of
time,'' he told the subcommittee, which Luken heads.
   ``Why not propose requirements for random testing of both truck
and automobile drivers?''
   The Association of American Railroads said it supported the idea
of random drug testing but didn't like Luken's plan because it
singles out railroads from other forms of transportation.
   Association President William Dempsey also said he disagreed
with a proposal to force railroads to guarantee that workers who
have completed drug or alcohol rehabilitation are reinstated in
their jobs.
   Luken interpreted the complaints from both labor and ownership
as a positive sign.
   ``Frankly, that tells me that we are on to something here,'' he
said.
   His bill duplicates a measure that passed the House in the last
session.

   Police in Britain and Ireland stepped up the hunt
Thursday for extortionists who spiked baby food with glass, razor
blades and caustic soda, and the number of reported cases of
tampering rose to more than 200.
   Three babies were hospitalized in England but were released
after doctors found they were not harmed by contaminated food,
hospital authorities said. The only victims so far are a
9-month-old girl who cut her mouth on a piece of razor blade in a
jar of yogurt and two mothers cut by glass hidden in baby food.
   Police said the total number of reported cases stood at about
220.
   Not all the reported cases have been confirmed. Police say the
majority of cases are probably the work of ``copy-cats, people
getting on the bandwagon, cranks and some cases of
self-contamination,'' an unidentified police detective said,
according to Press Association, the British domestic news agency.
   He said they believe there may be some cases of people putting
items in food in a bid to claim compensation from companies, but
the vast majority will be by cranks and copycats.
   ``We are not pointing the finger at mothers. People are
genuinely finding contaminants in food,'' the detective was quoted
as saying.
   Scotland Yard said no one has been arrested in connection with
the contamination but that some people were arrested locally for
hoaxes. A Yard spokesman had no details of the hoaxes.
   H.J. Heinz Co. Ltd. and Cow and Gate Ltd., which together
control nearly 80 percent of Britain's baby food market, on
Wednesday offered a joint reward totaling $169,000 for information
leading to the conviction of the extortionists.
   U.S.-owned Heinz said it had received an extortion demand it
refused to disclose. It issued a statement Thursday saying it had
not paid any money and never would. Cow and Gate, owned by Nutricia
of the Netherlands, said it had not received a demand.
   Police said only two of the reported cases were definitely
linked to the Heinz threat.
   Police and government officials refused to comment on newspaper
reports that the extortionists were paid $850,000 this year and
were now demanding an additional $1.7 million.
   Scotland Yard, which is coordinating the hunt for the saboteurs,
refused to comment on the investigation. The Daily Telegraph, a
respected conservative daily, said detectives from 12 countries
were searching for the extortionists.
   Local police forces reported 91 cases of suspected baby food
contamination, including five in Northern Ireland, and 21 more
unconfirmed cases. Across the border in the Republic of Ireland,
police said two cases were under investigation.
   Home Office Minister John Patten said Wednesday that 28
incidents of tampering with jars and cans of baby food had been
reported since April 7, including 11 on Wednesday.
   Mothers reported finding glass shards, pins, needles, broken
razor blades, stones and caustic baby soda in jars and cans of baby
food and in one case, in powdered milk. Most were in Heinz or Cow
and Gate products, but several were in other brands of baby food.
   Heinz and Cow and Gate have not pulled their baby food products
off supermarket shelves. In stores where contaminated jars and cans
have been found, all stock has been replaced.
   Both companies have said their internal investigations have
determined that their products were not tampered with during
production.
   Press Association said Scotland Yard detectives believe the
extortionists may have mastered a sophisticated technique of
resealing jars. The small glass jars have metal lids with an
indented center that indicates the vacuum seal has not been broken.
   In its statement Thursday, Heinz said, ``Police have stressed
that there has not at any time been a need for a general or batch
recall of baby food products.''
   The company stressed that a general withdrawal of the products
``would not solve external tampering. The problem would reappear at
any future date on Heinz products or any other food products sold
in grocery outlets.''
   Several newspapers, including The Daily Telegraph and the Times
of London, said the extortionists had demanded $1.7 million. The
Times said Heinz was the target, the Telegraph said both Heinz and
Cow and Gate were the targets.
   The Telegraph said police believe a gang that extorted $85,000
from a large supermarket chain this year by threatening to poison
food on its shelves turned its attention last month to Heinz and
Cow and Gate.

<TEXT>
   The House Budget Committee approved on
Thursday a fiscal 1990 spending plan designed to carry out a
deficit-reduction agreement with President Bush but still reflect
congressional plans for domestic programs.
   The $1.17 trillion plan, adopted by a bipartisan vote of 18-6,
calls for new user fees, sales of government assets and $5.3
billion in unspecified new revenue, while restraining spending
growth in defense and in some domestic areas.
   The budget is designed to reduce the federal deficit next year
by roughly $27 billion to less than $100 billion, as required by
the Gramm-Rudman deficit law. However, even its sponsors described
it as only a modest accomplishment.
   ``There's not a lot of deficit reduction in this package,'' said
Rep. Bill Frenzel, R-Minn., senior Republican on the committee.
   And committee chairman Leon Panetta, D-Calif., said he hoped to
``work toward a bolder resolution in the future.'' Panetta and
Frenzel both participated in the White House talks, and jointly
offered the budget adopted by the committee.
   Earlier, at a breakfast meeting with reporters, Panetta said
Congress and the White House might have to seek more spending cuts
or taxes as early as this summer if deficit estimates worsen in the
next few months.
   Panetta, after the committee meeting, predicted the budget would
pass the House next week. The Senate Budget Committee produced its
version last week and full Senate action is also expected next week.
   The $5.3 billion in new revenue called for in the White House
pact remains a matter of contention. Bush has insisted that rather
than a tax increase the additional revenue would be raised by
cutting the rate on capital gains income.
   The chairmen of the House and Senate tax committees have given
Bush's capital-gains proposal little chance of approval, but talks
continue.
   ``There's a five-point-three number hanging out there,'' Frenzel
said.
   A list of proposed user fees in the House committee version of
the budget, obtained by reporters, includes new levies on a wide
range of government services.
   They include fees for inspection of imported foods, charging
federal insurance fees for bank deposits held by foreigners,
additional levies on the nuclear power industry, and new or
extended charges for veterans' home loans and national flood
insurance.
   The two current versions of the budget, which must be reconciled
by the two chambers before the budget resolution becomes final, are
necessarily similar because of the White House agreement earlier
this month between Bush and congressional leaders.
   Military spending in the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1 would be
about $299.2 billion, with total spending authority _ some of which
may be spent after the end of the fiscal year _ of $305.5 billion.
Foreign aid spending would be $16.7 billion.
   Growth in the Medicare program would be trimmed about $2.7
billion. There would be no cuts in Social Security benefits.
   But while overall spending by federal agencies was set by the
agreement, the House and Senate had slightly different priorities.
   The Senate allocated more money for agriculture, energy,
transportation and law enforcement programs while the House favored
spending on education, health and veterans, according to figures
released by the House panel. Bush, for the most part, did not spell
out priorities among those programs, but he agreed in the deficit
pact to increase them overall to keep pace with inflation.
   Panetta and Frenzel said the House committee, unlike the Senate
panel, produced detailed recommendations on how money would be
spent in each area. For examle, Frenzel said the extra money put in
the science and space category would allow Congress a chance to
keep alive both the space station and superconducting supercollider
science projects.
   Much of what the House committee decided was done behind closed
doors and not revealed during the public session. Those policy
choices will be included in the committee report published next
week.
   The press release by the committee touted popular spending in
the package.
   The budget would clear the way for new federal child care and
child health and education spending, paent's crime
initiative with more money than he requested for the war on drugs,
and provide $1.9 billion to fight AIDS, it said. Federal civilian
and military employees wouldy for the presid get a 3.6 percent pay boost.
   In its open session, the committee rejected an amendment by Rep.
Marcy Kaptur, D-Ohio, to increase veterans' health spending $150
million beyond what was approved in the private meetings. Panetta
said the committee level was still well above the level recommended
by Bush or passed by the Senate.
   The budget does not itself authorize federal spending. It serves
as the guideline for the annual spending and tax bills that go
through Congress to the president.
   If by Oct. 1 those bills don't reduce the fiscal 1990 deficit,
as projected by the White House, to within $10 billion of the
Gramm-Rudman target of $100 billion, the administration must order
automatic spending cuts to make0.29  0.40

   Under a circus tent on the White House lawn,
there was a ``three-ring celebration'' of the joys of reading as
first lady Barbara Bush singled out two children from Texas for
special honors Thursday.
   Ten-year-old Amber Smith of Fort Worth was recognized as winner
of the Reading is Fundamental national poster contest, while
11-year-old Danny Leyva of San Juan won the organization's random
drawing in the ``Celebration of Reading'' program.
   Mrs. Bush, an adopted Texan, and entertainer-businessman Jimmy
Dean, the master of ceremonies, honored the children as part of
Reading is Fun Week.
   Reading Is Fundamental, which Mrs. Bush said will have provided
100 million books to children by the end of the year, sponsored the
event and entertainment was provided by Ringing Bros. and Barnum &amp;
Bailey Circus which has a motivational reading program for children.
   Mrs. Bush said: ``After we decided not to have elephants or lion
trainers, I only had one other worry. Would my Millie be jealous?
   ``Millie's my springer spaniel. This is her front yard. She owns
the south grounds and the only way that Millie would let me have
this big, wonderful party for Reading Is Fundamental was if I
promised her her puppies could come to the party.''
   She told the 200 children that ``today really is a three-ring
celebration, and I want all of you to have a wonderful time because
that's what Reading Is Fundamental is all about, having a wonderful
time with books.''
   ``Next to my family and gardening, I love reading more than
anything in life. And it's impossible for me to imagine ever being
without books, and that's why reading is very important,'' Mrs.
Bush said.

<HEAD>Brady Rejects Proposal to Reduce Medicare Catastrophic Surtax</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady on Thursday
rejected a proposal to reduce Medicare ``catastrophic'' health
insurance premiums that congressional analysts expect to generate a
bigger surplus than is needed.
   Brady, in a letter to Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, said the
insurance program ``is literally in its first few months of life''
and the administration wants to be sure it is not left with
insufficient reserves.
   The new insurance program, approved by Congress last year,
provides extended coverage for the costs of hospital and medical
care and drug benefits. It is financed through a surtax paid by
Social Security recipients.
   Bentsen, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, last week
said he would move to reduce the surtax if the Treasury Department
agreed with new congressional estimates that the surtax will yield
a $9.1 billion surplus over a five-year period.
   Brady, however, said the administration expects the premiums to
yield ``contingency reserves'' of $6.2 billion and finds no reason
to revise that estimate or to allow for a smaller surplus.
   ``Until we gain experience with this program, we believe that we
must be cautious about funding,'' Brady stated in the letter.
   He added that the administration believes ``the moderate cushion
which is currently projected should be maintained.''
   Earlier this week, President Bush issued a letter in which he
said it would be ``imprudent to tinker'' with the new Medicare
program. Bush noted that that reserves could be used only for
Medicare and ``cannot be diverted to any other program or purpose.''
   Bentsen's office said it had not yet received Brady's letter and
had no immediate comment.

   The Federal Aviation Administration on
Thursday announced $200,000 in fines against Air Wisconsin for
failure to conduct required inspections on three of its aircraft
after repairs.
   The FAA does not consider planes to be airworthy until repairs
have been inspected by qualified personnel other than those who
made the repairs.
   In one instance, a fuel control lever was unsafely wired during
maintenance, resulting in the right engine of a two-engine plane
being stuck at an 80 percent power level, the FAA said, adding that
an inspection would have caught the error.
   The FAA charged Air Wisconsin in an April 14 letter with using
three of its aircraft on several passenger-carrying flights after
failing to check repairs.
   Two of the aircraft had received unverified repairs after being
hit by birds, and one was hit by lightning, the FAA said.

   King Hussein swore in his tough former army
commander as prime minister Thursday after widespread rioting and
told him to reorganize the government and prepare for Jordan's
first general elections in 22 years.
   State-run Jordan TV showed the swearing-in ceremony for Zeid Bin
Shaker and said Hussein issued 19 directives to the new government,
including calls for freedom of the press, support for the PLO and
stamping out corruption.
   But the king also told the government to ``put an end to the
involvement of religion in politics,'' an apparent reference to
Islamic fundamentalists accused of encouraging the unrest.
   Bin Shaker takes office after the kingdom's worst domestic
violence since 1971. Riots stemming from government price increases
and economic difficulties killed at least nine people last week in
southern Jordan. Government buildings and banks were attacked in
dozens of cities and villages.
   The new government ``will be a temporary one'' charged with
``overseeing the general elections which will take place very
soon,'' Hussein was quoted as telling the Kuwaiti newspaper
Al-Seyassah.
   The 24-man Cabinet includes seven Palestinian-born men, down
from 10 in the previous 26-member cabinet.
   But that appeared enough to assert Hussein's continuing claim to
represent Palestinians in the kingdom despite his decision to sever
ties with the West Bank last year. Palestinians make up half of
Jordan's population of 3 million.
   The king vowed continued support for the Palestine Liberation
Organization and ``non-interference in their local affairs,''
distancing himself further from the West Bank he ruled until 1967,
when it was seized by Israel.
   The new government includes nine Cabinet holdovers, including
Foreign Minister Marwan Kassem.
   Bin Shaker, 55, a longtime friend and adviser of the king, is
best known for his military role in crushing Palestinian guerrillas
in Jordan in 1970 and 1971. He was armed forces commander in chief
until last year, when Hussein made him chief of palace advisers and
special adviser on security affairs. He still holds field marshal's
rank and enjoys high prestige in the army.
   In Thursday's message, Hussein alluded to charges of corruption
and profiteering leveled against Zaid Rifai, the replaced prime
minister whose name was chanted in rage by rioters.
   Hussein ordered his ministers to re-examine Jordan's tax laws
with an eye to fairness and ``to uproot corruption wherever it is.''
   He demanded stronger channels of communication between the
people and the government, including ``the right of expression and
freedom of the press.'' Rifai, who resigned on Monday, nationalized
Jordan's already docile newspapers during his four-year tenure.
   The riots were set off by 10 to 50 percent price rises for
gasoline and cigarettes and other commodities on top of an economic
slide that cut yearly per capita income to about $1,200 from $2,000.
   Al-Seyassah quoted Hussein as saying ``an accumulation of
factors'' led to the four days of riots and that the outgoing
government ``was unable to communicate to the public an explanation
of the recent economic measures.''
   Hussein also was quoted as saying Israel ``had a hand'' in
spurring the riots to draw attention from the 16-month Palestinian
uprising in Israeli-occupied territories.
   In Jerusalem, Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin retorted
Thursday on state-owned Israel radio, ``If he said these things,
then it is absurd, almost ridiculous.''
   Both Bin Shaker and Hussein were educated at Victoria College in
Egypt, and at Britain's Sandhurst military academy.
   Bin Shaker joined the army in 1953, the year Hussein came to
power, and was by the king's side when Hussein drove out to meet
his troops amid gunfire and rallied them against an attempted coup
in 1957.
   Bin Shaker commanded an armored brigade in the 1967 war with
Israel.

   Palestinian enforcers have stepped up a
self-policing campaign, targeting Arabs who collaborate with Israel
or defy policies of the underground leadership.
   An Israeli Defense Ministry report obtained by The Associated
Press said 960 attacks have been carried out on Palestinians by
other Arabs with 33 killed and 63 wounded between the start of the
uprising in December 1987 and the beginning of April 1989.
   Six additional Palestinians were killed in recent days, some
accused of spying for Israel and others the target of a new
underground ``vice squad'' that has singled out drug dealers and
prostitutes.
   On Thursday night, an Arab policeman, Jamil Sheik Hallil, 37,
was stabbed by masked Palestinians in the West Bank village of
Nazlat Iza for continuing to work with the Israeli government
despite warnings to quit, Arab reporters said. He was taken to a
hospital in Israel for treatment, they said.
   The pace and severity of such attacks intensified this week as
the pro-PLO underground called in an underground leaflet for a
``day of accounting for the collaborators.''
   Israeli officials claim Palestinian underground leaders are
creating a climate of fear in which moderates are intimidated from
speaking freely or challenging the policies of Yasser Arafat's
Palestine Liberation Organization.
   ``We believe such violence has an impact on the voices we can
hear coming from the Palestinian population and its leaders. It has
an impact on political behavior and expressions,'' said Foreign
Ministry Spokesman Alon Liel.
   Palestinians reject such claims, saying a wide variety of
political views are expressed in public as evidenced by a recent
debate on whether Palestinians should agree to an Israeli proposal
for elections.
   ``I don't think we are in Switzerland where there is a
completely free flow of ideas. But considering all the constraints,
Palestinians have an ample opportunity to give opinions. Look at
the elections, people publicly expressed various points of view,''
said Daoud Kuttab, a Palestinian journalist.
   Palestinian sources who spoke on condition of anonymity defended
the actions of the clandestine hit teams that ``cleanse the
community'' of informers who risk the lives of anti-Israeli
activists sought by Israeli security authorities.
   The most recent victim was Fayek Erar, who allegedly forged
deeds and sold land to Israelis. He died in a barrage of bullets
fired by three masked men who came to his house in the West Bank
village of Ras Atiya on Wednesday.
   In Gaza City, the body of Jamal Abdul Hamid El Nadi, 39, was
found stabbed and beaten March 25. A leaflet pinned to his chest
was signed by the ``strike forces of the State of Palestine'' and
said: ``This is the fate of all who collaborate with the Zionists
and deal with drugs.''
   Palestinians sources who spoke on condition of anonymity fearing
reprisal said suspected collaborators were were amply warned and
given a chance to repent. They also noted that underground trials
were conducted in which testimony was tape recorded.
   Sabah Kanaan, 32, said 10 Palestinian activists, their faces
concealed by checkered headdresses, broke into her home in the West
Bank City of Nablus on April 21, beat her and sexually assaulted
her. She said in a telephone interview that they demanded
information about an acquaintance they suspected of collaborating.
   ``They stormed into my house carrying sticks and covering their
faces. They beat me and threatened to take my life if I did not
cooperate and tell them,'' said Ms. Kanaan, who was hospitalized in
Ramallah with bruises on the legs and arms.
   ``This is the ugly face of the intefadeh,'' said Col. Renaan
Gissin, the deputy army spokesman, using the Arabic word for
uprising. ``For some months now, violence and intimidation have
been used to enforce the policies and orders of the underground
leadership.''
   The Defense Ministry report said frequent targets of threats
were the 18,000 Palestinians who work for the army-run civil
administration, which administers the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   For example, a threatening leaflet from the pro-PLO United
National Leadership of the Uprising forced the resignation of 450
Arab policemen, especially after warnings were underlined by the
killing of Jericho policeman whose body was left on the doorstep of
his house in March 1988.
   Israeli-appointed mayors, city council members and village
leaders were also targeted. Three mukhtars, traditional village
leaders, were assassinated in June 1988 and El-Bireh Mayor Hassan
Tawil was stabbed in the chest.
   Noting such attacks predated the uprising, an army briefing
paper said: ``The PLO always regarded the involvement of a local
leadership in the territories (of the West Bank and Gaza) as a
threat.''
   When Bethlehem Mayor Elias Freij proposed a ceasefire in the
uprising in exchange for prisoner releases and the opening of
universities, spray-painted graffiti condemned him as a ``traitor''
and threatened him with death. PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat warned
anyone trying to stop the revolt ``exposes himself to the bullets
of our people.''

<HEAD>Bush Urges US Companies to Work Harder to Prevent Chemicals from
Use in Cocaine</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDS: Inserts 2 grafs after 9th graf bgng, `The association,' to UPDATE

   Using the bully pulpit of the White House,
President Bush urged parents and stockholders Thursday to demand
that American companies ``act responsibly'' to prevent U.S.
chemicals from being used to produce cocaine.
   ``No chemicals, no cocaine,'' Bush told an international drug
enforcement conference attended by delegates from 30 nations.
   Cocaine producers use ether, acetone, hydrochloric acid, a
chemical known as MEK and other products to refine their drug from
coca leaves.
   ``Few Americans are aware that illegally diverted barrels of
dangerous chemicals _ clearly marked with U.S. corporate logos _
are routinely seized in the jungles of Colombia,'' Bush said.
   Although Bush referred in his speech to illegal diversions of
chemicals, Justice Department spokesman David Runkel said U.S.
companies currently are free to sell all their products to other
countries.
   As a result of last year's new drug law, however, federal
regulations are being drafted that would require the companies to
tell the Drug Enforcement Agency of the ultimate destination and
use of export shipments of seven products that could be used in
making cocaine, Runkel said. DEA would have 15 days to review the
paperwork and could stop shipments, he said.
   Runkel said chemical companies have filed a stack of objections
four inches high to the rules, but that they were expected to be in
place by May 15 anyway.
   In Washington, the Chemical Manufacturers Association issued a
statement saying the industry ``is already at the front lines'' in
the war against drugs.
   The association, which is made up of companies that manufacture
industrial chemicals, said the industry supported passage of last
year's anti-drug law. Even before the law was passed, the group
said, the industry was already working with law enforcement
officials to ``identify and stop illegal shipments of our
products.''
   Association spokesman Jeff Van said his organization's
objections center on DEA's attempts to take actions that Congress
rejected in previous legislation.
   Primarily, he said, the DEA wants to require chemical companies
to provide detailed reports on their regular customers, while
Congress required only that they list the customers; and the DEA
wants to force the chemical industry to provide statements
certifying that the chemicals are being used lawfully, a proposal
which he said Congress also has turned down.
   Bush made his comments in a speech on the final day of a hectic
four-day trek, visiting nine cities in six states from Virginia to
California and back.
   Although the trip was marred by scheduling problems and did not
make much news nationally, White House Chief of Staff John Sununu
said Bush was satisfied.
   ``He really feels it's important for him to go out and let the
folks see the president,'' Sununu said. ``You just don't always
focus on getting 15 or 30 seconds on the national news.''
   More than 100 Eastern Airlines strikers and their supporters
demonstrated noisily against Eastern chief Frank Lorenzo outside
the Miami hotel where Bush spoke.
   They waved signs with ban-Lorenzo symbols, chanted ``just say
no'' and gave a thumbs-down salute to Bush as his motorcade rode by.
   Bush, who has refused to intervene to end the strike, waved back
at them.
   Bush told the drug conference that ``by and large'' the chemical
industry has supported efforts to halt the flow of U.S. chemicals.
``We've been getting good support from most of the chemical
industry.''
   However, he said, ``industry's got to do more.
   ``And I hope that parents' groups and stockholders are listening
today. We should demand that United States corporations act
responsibly and that they not tolerate their chemicals ending up in
criminal hands.''
   Bush said he would like to see ``U.S. chemical manufacturers
demonstrate their courage and civic responsibility by entering into
a true partnership with our government as we try to stop narcotics
at the source.''
   ``These companies can make an important contribution to our
nation's fight against illegal drugs. They should make it their job
to join in.''
   Sununu told reporters that the chemical companies deserve
recognition for their voluntary efforts. However, he said,
``There's no question that there are still some strange purchases
of chemicals that take place.''
   Asked if Bush was suggesting complicity by some drug companies
in the use of chemicals to refine cocaine, Sununu replied, ``I
don't think that was the suggestion at all. It's just a call for
additional cooperation above and beyond the normal.''
   Bush said the products used to produce cocaine are ``chemical
time bombs.''
   In Peru, for example, he said 175,000 pounds of sulfuric acid
are dumped each year into tributaries of the Upper Huallaga Valley.
   ``Anyone concerned about the legacy of defoliation in Southeast
Asia ought to go see what illegally diverted chemicals are
beginning to do to the Andes right now,'' he said.
   In the United States, drug agents busted a houseboat lab on
California's Sacramento River that was dumping hydrochloric acid
and other waste into water within splashing distance of children
swimming, Bush said.
   ``Today I pledge to you that the United States will lead the
fight against illicit shipments of precursor chemicals,'' the
president said.
   He said drug-producing nations _ in Latin America _ and
drug-consuming nations _ chiefly the United States _ should stop
blaming each other for the drug scourge.
   ``Ultimately, the solution to the United States drug problem
lies within our own borders: stepped-up enforcement, education and
treatment as well.''
   Bush said that casual cocaine users ``can no longer claim
non-combatant status'' in the war on drugs. ``There is blood on
their hands.''
   He said that realization ``has begun to sear the consciences of
the stockbrokers and the students, the lawyers and the homemakers
and the athletes who finance our common enemy.''
   In a separate appearance in Miami, Bush dedicated a high-tech
center run by the Coast Guard and Customs Service to spot drug
traffickers in the air and at sea.
   ``Think of this as one of America's drug war situation rooms, as
our early warning network against narcotics,'' Bush said.
   Before returning to Washington, Bush stopped in Palm Harbor in
Pinellas County to dedicate a 51-bed care center at a retirement
center for victims of Alzheimers Disease.

<HEAD>Pinochet Changes Education, Mining Ministers But Keeps Interior Minister</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Military President Augusto Pinochet's
office said Thursday he will name new ministers of education and
mining, but it indicated no plans to replace Interior Minister
Carlos Caceres.
   Local press and radio had predicted Caceres' departure in a
conflict with Pinochet over proposed democratic reforms.
   On Wednesday, Gen. Pinochet asked all 15 members of his Cabinet
to hand in their resignations to give him ``freedom of action'' in
making changes, a spokesman said.
   On Thursday, his press office said he accepted the resignations
only of Education Minister Juan Guzman and Mining Minister Pablo
Baraona.
   According to local press reports that the government has not
denied, Caceres and Pinochet disagreed over the extent of proposed
amendments to the 1980 Constitution and other legal reforms sought
by the opposition.
   Caceres has been negotiating the changes with civilian
politicians, and he said last week he is ready to make a firm
proposal for the changes.
   The reforms would include modifying a constitutional ban on
Marxism and altering Congress and a powerful military-controlled
National Security Council. Opposition parties are pressing for the
reforms before scheduled Dec. 14 national elections to pick a
successor to Pinochet and a Congress.
   Pinochet, the army commander, seized power in a 1973 coup. He
proposed in a referendum last October to remain in power until
1997. Voters rejected the proposal, obliging him to call elections.
   Caceres was named interior minister, the top political position
in the Cabinet, shortly after the referendum.
   Patricio Aylwin, spokesman for an opposition coalition of 17
parties, said the retention of Caceres is ``probably a good
indication, showing a willingness by the government to reach an
agreement on constitutional changes.''
   Andres Allamand, secretary general of the pro-goverment National
Renovation, said Pinochet's decision to keep Caceres ``guarantees
that there will be substantial constitutional changes.''

   The federal government on Thursday raised the
amount of grain the Soviet Union can purchase this year to 24
million metric tons, but a farm state congressman said Soviet
negotiators aren't happy with the deal.
   The Soviets, who previously had a limit of 20 million tons on
the amount of U.S. grain they could buy this year, wanted to expand
the amount to 30 million tons under the Export Enhancement Program,
said Rep. David Nagle, D-Iowa.
   Nagle, who is a member of the House Agriculture Committee, said
U.S. negotiators told the Soviets they could not use the subsidy
program.
   Attempts to contact Soviet officials at their embassy in
Washington were unsuccessful.
   Kelly Shipp, press secretary to Agriculture Secretary Clayton
Yeutter, said the agreement does not stipulate whether the Export
Enhancement Program will be used during the sale. She said the
talks were about the amount of grain the Soviets could buy, not its
price.
   An Agriculture Department official told a Senate subcommittee
last week that EEP sales had been put on hold pending a budget
review, an announcement that stirred controversy for the program.
   The program is popular with foreign buyers because it makes U.S.
commodities cheaper. It also helps the United States stay
competitive with countries that heavily subsidize their exports.
   But no EEP applications have been processed since the end of
February.
   Members of Congress say they have tried unsuccessfully to find
out whether the Bush administration has suspended the program as
part of negotiations in the Uruguay Round trade talks. The U.S.
position at those talks is that all countries should remove or
drastically reduce subsidies on their exports.
   Shipp, Yeutter's spokeswoman, said the program has been slowed
down because of weather and stock conditions and because there is a
new administration, but it has not been suspended.
   She noted that domestic wheat supplies are lower than they have
been in 15 years and the EEP program draws on those stocks.
   Nagle said his sources told him Vice President Dan Quayle, who
arrived in Australia on Wednesday, assured the Australians that the
United States was backing off the export subsidy program.
   Australia also wants other countries to remove such subsidies
and has been pursuing that end even more aggressively than the
United States.
   Meanwhile, the Agriculture Department also announced Thursday
that the Soviet Union has bought an additional 150,000 metric tons
of corn for delivery this year under its long-term supply agreement
with the United States.
   Officials said the latest sales brought total corn sold to the
Soviets for delivery in 1988-89 to more than 13.2 million tons.
   In addition to the wheat and corn, sales include 450,000 tons of
soybeans, 1.4 million tons of soybean meal and 507,400 of grain
sorghum.
   The latest corn sale and the other grain is for delivery by
Sept. 30, the end of the sixth year of a long-term grain supply
agreement.
   The original agreement said the Soviets could purchase 12
million tons of grain, but would be able to come back periodically
to request more.

   Tawana Brawley, the black teen-ager who made
national headlines after claiming she was abducted and raped by a
gang of white men, admitted to her boyfriend that she and her
mother made up the story, a newspaper reported Thursday.
   Miss Brawley made the admission two weeks ago to Daryl T.
Rodriguez, 19, who became her boyfriend a few weeks before the
alleged abduction in Wappingers Falls on Nov. 24, 1987, when Miss
Brawley was 15, New York Newsday reported.
   A grand jury concluded last year that Miss Brawley, who was
found in a plastic garbage bag, smeared with feces and with racial
epithets scrawled on her body, had faked being raped.
   The Newsday story ``tends to corroborate everything that the
grand jury discovered and the conclusions it reached,'' said Tim
Gilles, speaking for state Attorney General Robert Abrams, the
special prosecutor who handled the case.
   Gilles said that although there no longer was a question of
criminal prosecution in the case, the attorney general wanted to
interview Rodriguez to confirm the story because ``it would be in
the public interest and satisfying to everyone to fill in some of
the final pieces.''
   The story, written by Newsday's assistant managing editor, Les
Payne, was denounced in a radio interview by two of Miss Brawley's
advisers, Alton Maddox and the Rev. Al Sharpton. They accused the
newspaper of trying to divert attention from what they called white
establishment lies about the recent Central Park gang rape case.
   Miss Brawley, who lives in Virginia Beach, Va., denied the
account and said she hadn't seen Rodriguez since last summer, the
newspaper said.
   Newsday said Miss Brawley told Rodriguez that she and her
mother, Glenda, invented the story to keep Ralph King, her mother's
lover, from beating the girl.
   Sharpton and two lawyers, Maddox and C. Vernon Mason, kept Miss
Brawley and her mother away from the grand jury while conducting a
publicity campaign that depicted the state investigation as a
coverup to protect the rapists, among whom they alleged were a
police officer and an assistant district attorney.
   Sharpton said the Newsday story, coming as the Central Park
``wilding'' rampage by black youths unfolds, was meant to deflect
the public from making comparisons ``between how the justice system
responds to the rape of a black girl and the rape of a white
woman.''
   Maddox, sounding the same theme in an interview on WLIB, said
that so far there ``hasn't been any evidence of a rape or of this
woman being assaulted or attacked at all'' in Central Park.
   ``We don't even know if she's over at Metropolitan Hospital or
not,'' yet that is accepted as true, while Miss Brawley's case is
branded a hoax, Maddox said.

<HEAD>Three Sentenced to Death for Bombings, Killings</HEAD>

   A Supreme Court justice on
Thursday sentenced to death three uniformed guerrillas of the
African National Congress for four killings and a bombing at a bus
stop.
   The men refused to take part in their trial, saying they were
prisoners of war. They wore olive-green military uniforms with ANC
colors throughout the proceedings at the farming town of Delmas,
northeast of Johannesburg.
   On Tuesday, one read a statement on behalf of himself and his
comrades which said in part: ``We are soldiers in a patriotic army
struggling to establish democracy and peace. We believe that we are
prisoners of war.''
   The court let the men's families present evidence in mitigation
of sentence when the men themselves would not. The defendants were
convicted of murder on March 2, making the death penalty mandatory
unless mitigating circumstances were shown.
   Supreme Court Justice Marius de Klerk found none existed. He
sentenced Jabu Masina, 36, Ting-Ting Masango, 28, and Neo Potsane,
27, for murdering two black policemen, a black town councilor, and
the councilor's sister-in law.
   No execution date was set.
   The three also were sentenced to 25 years in prison for
attempted murder in a 1986 bus stop bombing that injured 17 people
and in setting a mine on a road used mainly by military vehicles.
   A fourth defendant, Joseph Makhura, 26, drew 25 years in prison
in connection with the bombing and mining.
   Masina read a statement on Tuesday that said:
   ``We say that the present South African government has no
authority, no moral or legal right to rule over the people of this
country. It is therefore our duty to bring this crime to an end, to
remove this illegal state.
   ``If we are hanged, our death will not be in vain. Those who
come after us will undoubtedly complete our mission in life.''
   Prosecutor Harry Prinsloo said the men committed ``planned,
cold-blooded murders'' in pursuit of political objectives.

   The Soviet Union ended an era in its manned space
program Thursday when three cosmonauts returned to Earth, leaving
the Mir space station empty for the first time in more than two
years.
   A Soyuz TM-7 capsule carrying Alexander Volkov, Sergei Krikalev
and Valery Polyakov landed about 90 miles northeast of Dzhezkazgan
in Soviet Central Asia, Tass said.
   The suspension of the Mir mission, the showpiece of the Soviet
space program, comes one day before the United States plans to
launch its Atlantis space shuttle with a crew of five.
   Mir, designed for permanent occupancy, will remain empty until
another rocket launch scheduled in August. Officials said the
respite will save money at a time when the Soviet Union is
struggling with a $160 billion deficit.
   Tass called the touchdown of the Soyuz capsule soft, but Volkov,
on the evening news program ``Vremya,'' called it ``not one of the
softest.''
   ``There was a double touchdown. The apparatus landed, then
jumped from the ground and we were turned over several times. In
general, the blows could be felt. Probably the bruises will
remain,'' Volkov said.
   Krikalev suffered the most because he hit a capsule control
panel, the TV reporter said without elaboration.
   In the TV report, Krikalev appeared to be the most shaken and
pale of the three cosmonauts, and Polyakov, a doctor, was shown
treating him aboard a plane flight to Star City near Moscow.
   There was no explanation what went wrong or why Tass said the
landing was soft.
   Volkov and Krikalev had been in space for five months. Polyakov
remained aboard Mir for eight months after a joint Afghan-Soviet
flight to study the effects of long-term space flight on the crew.
   A replacement crew was orginally due to arrive at the Mir
station April 19 to keep the station manned, but Tass said ``a
delay with the preparation of the new modules forced a revision of
the plan.''
   The respite will allow scientists a chance to review scientific
data, complete work on two unfinished station modules and give
ground controllers vacations, space officials said last week.
   In August, cosmonauts will return to Mir for a six-month stint
that will include overseeing the addition of a new research module
and a service module, officials said. The additions will double the
space station's weight to 100 tons, Tass said.
   Since its launch in 1986, Mir has been home to four resident
crews, including the record-breaking yearlong stay by cosmonauts
Vladimir Titov and Musa Manarov, who returned to Earth in December.
   Cosmonaut Vladimir Gzhenebekov told Soviet TV the landing
required ``little corrections,'' but there were no major problems
like those that cropped up during the last two landings.
   In September, an Afghan and Soviet cosmonaut were forced to
postpone the landing of their Soyuz TM-5 capsule in Soviet Central
Asia for a day because of equipment problems and crew errors. They
touched down safely a day late, but were running dangerously low on
food and air.
   During the return of Titov and Manarov in December, the
cosmonauts had to spend an additional three hours orbiting Earth in
their descent module because of a computer problem, the Soviet
media reported.

<HEAD>Pentagon: Bullet That Killed Rowe Found `Soft Spot' In Armor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALEXANDER G. HIGGINS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The assassin's bullet that killed U.S. Army
Col. James ``Nick'' Rowe in the Philippines passed through a
soft-spot in his armored car, the Pentagon announced Thursday.
   Spokesman Dan Howard told reporters that the slaying of Rowe on
his way to work in suburban Manila last Friday demonstrated the
limits of the precautions the U.S. military can take to protect its
personnel overseas.
   ``Our bases in the Philippines have had a heightened state of
alert for over a year and a half now since three Americans were
shot outside of Clark Air Force Base,'' said Howard. ``That alert
status continues. And of course, the shooting has reemphasized the
need for all of our people to be especially vigilant.''
   ``Other than the heightened alert, there is a limit to what can
be done.'' he said.
   The car in which Rowe was riding was armored, he said, but
``perhaps there's misunderstanding about what an armored vehicle
is. ... It's an ordinary passenger automobile which has been
provided with some types of protection. It is not an M1A1 tank.''
   Thick plexiglass is applied to the windows, and armored plates
are in the doors as well as extra shielding in the floor, he said.
   ``But it is not a completely secure conveyance,'' he said. ``And
if someone fires armor-piercing rounds with an automatic weapon at
the vehicle, it can find a soft spot. It's not impervious to that
sort of an attack.''
   In fact, the bullet that killed Rowe ``was not an armor-piercing
round,'' Howard said. ``The round bullet that entered the Rowe
vehicle went through what they call a non-hardened area around the
window frame.''
   Police in the Philippines said hooded gunmen sprayed Rowe's car
with an M-16 rifle and a .45-caliber pistol. The communist New
People's Army claimed responsibility for the slaying.
   Rowe, 51, was chief of the ground forces of the Joint U.S.
Military Advisory Group, which provides training and logistical
support to the Philippine military.
   ``We use these armored vehicles all over the world, at our
embassies and the like, military installations, as do many, many
other governments,'' Howard said, adding that there was no
investigation under way to see whether the Rowe vehicle was
deficient.
   Howard said no special precautions were being taken in the
Philippines as a result of the slaying.
   ``It's been a general precaution area there,'' he said. ``The
New People's Army has a long history of terrorist activity against
citizens of the Philippines. They have occasionally turned their
violence on foreigners.
   ``We had three military personnel killed a year and a half ago.
There have been some other incidents, one of which was ... the
blowing up of some radio towers. But there's no indication of a
widespread campaign.''
   He said U.S. officials have alerted Americans in the
Philippines, adding, ``We have a great many people there.''
   Howard said he didn't know whether special investigators had
been sent from the United States on the case.
   ``Obviously, this is sovereign territory of the Philippines,''
he said. ``We are cooperating with the Philippine authorities. And
we are pleased with the high level of cooperation that we're
getting, trying to investigate the matter.''
   Howard said Rowe would be buried Monday afternoon at Arlington
National Cemetery, across the Potomac from Washington, D.C.,
following a private funeral in Ft. Myer Memorial Chapel.

<HEAD>Police Can't Confirm Downey Assault Allegation</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An alleged assault on Morton Downey Jr. by
neo-Nazis did not happen as the TV talk show host reported it did,
and may be a fabrication, authorities said Thursday.
   ``The facts certainly did not happen the way Mr. Downey said
they happened. We cannot substantiate any of his claims ... either
way,'' said San Francisco International Airport spokesman Ron
Wilson.
   Downey, star of his confrontational ``shock TV'' talk show, said
he was attacked by skinheads in a restroom at the airport Monday
night. He said they tried to shave his head and scribbled reversed
swastikas on his face, sweatshirt and pants.
   Since the initial report and Downey's interviews with local
reporters while still sporting the Nazi insignias, police have
tried unsuccessfully to verify his story, fueling speculation that
the skinhead story was a publicity stunt.
   ``There's just a lot of inconsistencies, and apparently his
story changes as time goes on,'' Wilson said. Asked if
investigators determined the attack was faked, he replied, ``I
don't want to make that flat statement. ... It certainly leaves a
lot of suspicions as far as I'm concerned.''
   Jim Langan, a former producer, writer and road manager for ``The
Morton Downey Jr. Show,'' said in Thursday editions of The Record
of Hackensack, N.J., that Downey told him last month he would
attempt a stunt to bolster sagging ratings.
   ``He said he thought it would get him national attention,'' said
Langan, who left the show in December.
   Gary Kessler, a talk show host at KBX-TV in Denver, said
Wednesday he spoke with Downey on Sunday about his trip to San
Francisco.
   He said Downey said he had been threatened by skinheads and the
gay community ``and at one point he told me, and I'm pretty sure
this is a quote, `I'm a little concerned about what might happen at
the airport.'''
   Asked about a possible publicity stunt, show spokesman John
Murphy said, ``I don't know. I don't know anything. There is no
official comment right now.''
   San Mateo County Sheriff's Sgt. Paul Giguiere said that filing a
false police report is a misdemeanor in California. But he said
Downey declined police inquiries, didn't want a report filed and
refused to be examined.
   Investigators have been unable to find anyone to corroborate
Downey's story, he said.
   ``This indicates to me that there is a possibility it (the
attack) was fabricated, certainly,'' Guiguiere said. ``If that's
show biz, you can have it.''
   ``The Morton Downey Jr. Show,'' formerly one of television's
most talked-about programs, has suffered a ratings collapse in
recent months. It ranks No. 82 in the season-to-date syndicated
television ratings.
   In addition to the ABC-owned station in Los Angeles, stations in
San Diego and Phoenix have announced that they have canceled the
show because of decreased ratings, lack of advertiser support or
consumer complaints.
   The half-hour show, which had its debut nationally last
September, features Downey debating with _ and shouting at _
various in-studio visitors.

<HEAD>Gingrich Says GOP Must Build `Caring, Humanitarian' Party</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID PACE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four House Democrats on Thursday called for
the appointment of an outside counsel to investigate allegations
that Republican Whip Newt Gingrich violated House rules in his
financial dealings.
   Rep. Bill Alexander, D-Ark., filed a formal complaint with the
House ethics committee earlier this month alleging 10 apparent rule
violations in the formation and operation of a limited partnership
set up to promote a 1984 book co-authored by Gingrich.
   But Reps. Barney Frank of Massachusetts, Larry Smith of Florida,
Pat Schroeder of Colorado and Albert Bustamante of Texas, are
asking Democratic colleagues to support their letter to the ethics
panel chairman, Rep. Julian Dixon, D-Calif., calling for an outside
counsel.
   In the letter to Dixon, the Democrats said such an appointment
to investigate the charges against Gingrich would ``preserve the
integrity of the committee's consideration process from
politicization and outside pressure.''
   The committee has not indicated whether it will launch a formal
investigation of Alexander's complaint, which was filed as the
committee neared the end of the investigation Gingrich initiated of
House Speaker Jim Wright.
   Gingrich earlier this week denied any wrongdoing in connection
with the partnership and released nearly 400 pages of documents
detailing its financial and incorporation history.
   The partnership was formed with $5,000 investments from 18
individuals and three corporations. Many of the investors were
wealthy Republicans who regularly contributed to Gingrich's
campaigns. In return for promoting the book, the partnership was to
have received half the publisher's profits, but the publisher lost
money and the investors ended up with tax writeoffs.
   Earlier Thursday, Gingrich used a National Press Club luncheon
to outline the message of Democratic corruption and Republican
opportunity that he has used to propel himself into the House GOP
leadership.
   He said the GOP must build a ``caring, humanitarian, reform''
party to offer voters an alternative to a Democratic party that is
``committed to propping up a system that's dying.''
   ``Every conservative in America must confront the reality that
the great age of opposition conservatism is over,'' he said.
``Goldwater and Reagan won the argument and now the country wants
us to govern. We must come up with a wave of reforms of
extraordinary scale.''
   Gingrich, who instigated the investigation that resulted in
Wright's being the first speaker ever charged with violating House
rules, said that America must undergo dramatic change to meet the
challenges of the 1990s, and that change must be focused on the
system rather than on personalities.
   ``I don't think any person in America can look at our
competitive situation in the world market, can look at the
pressures of high technology, can look at the rate of change in the
Soviet Union and China and then turn to our major cities and not
come to the conclusion that we are on the verge of absolutely
catastrophic decay in the 1990s,'' he said.
   The reasons for that decay, Gingrich argued, are drugs and
violent crime, the collapse of education systems in major cities,
the inability of unionized city bureaucracies to meet the needs of
the urban poor, the penetration of labor unions and city
governments by organized crime and the Democratic domination of
Congress.
   Gingrich said Democrats have so insulated themselves on Capitol
Hill that Soviet provincial leaders were 16 times more likely to be
defeated this year than were incumbent members of Congress.
   ``That is a fundamental insult to the constitutional freedoms of
American and it is nothing more than a game written on Capitol Hill
by a left-wing party that knows it cannot possibly survive in fair
elections in this country, and therefore they cheat every day,'' he
said.
   As an example of such ``Democratic cheating,'' Gingrich cited
franking rules that he said permitted Congress to spend ``more
money last year on franked mail than every challenger for the House
and Senate spent on everything.''

<HEAD>Ramon Salcido's Ex-Wife Recounts Violence and Fear</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FRESNO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first wife of confessed mass slayer
Ramon Salcido said the former winery worker terrorized her and once
threatened to kill her, a newspaper reported Thursday.
   Debra Salcido, 27, hid in terror during the three days and
nights her ex-husband was on the run and says that if their
daughter asks about her father, she will tell her he is dead,
according to a report in The Fresno Bee.
   ``When she comes of age I don't know what I'm going to tell
her,'' Debra Salcido said of the couple's 4-year-old daughter, who
does not know who her father is. ``I can't tell her her father's a
killer. If I can do it, I'm going to tell her he's dead. I hope by
then he will be.''
   After learning that her ex-husband was suspected of the slayings
in California's picturesque wine country, she fled with her
daughter and a 3-year-old son from a subsequent marriage.
   Ramon Salcido has been accused of slashing or shooting to death
seven people on April 14, including his wife, Angela, two of his
three young daughters, his mother-in-law, two young sisters-in-law
and his boss.
   He is being held in isolation in Sonoma County Jail.
   In her only interview since the slayings, Debra Salcido
described the frequent beatings she experienced during her brief
marriage to the man who now faces possible execution if convicted
of his alleged crimes.
   One incident occurred in late 1983 or early 1984 at the couple's
home in Sonoma, during which she said Ramon Salcido's
alcohol-fueled temper exploded.
   ``He got me onto the floor and put his knees on my arms,'' she
said. ``He took a pair of scissors and put them right to my throat
and said `I could kill you,''' while dripping saliva on her face.
   On another occasion, she said, Salcido came home drunk, and when
she refused to say where she had been that day, he took a
.22-caliber rifle from beneath the sofa and waved it wildly.
   Three weeks later, after she learned she was pregnant, she left
Salcido.
   During the agonizing international manhunt for the suspected
killer, Debra Salcido moved with her family to a Fresno motel,
where they learned that Ramon Salcido's three daughters were found
with their throats slit in a county dump. Only one of the victims,
Carmina, survived the attack. Panicked, Mrs. Salcido had a friend
pick up her daughter.
   In the years since the couple's separation and divorce, Mrs.
Salcido had a son by a man who was murdered in Mexico in January
1986.
   After she moved to Fresno and began collecting welfare, the
local district attorney pressed for child support from Ramon
Salcido for care of the couple's little girl.
   Authorities believe this dispute may have ignited the rage that
led to the murders. Ramon Salcido confessed to the slayings after
he was captured April 19 in his native Mexico.
   Following the killings, Salcido's blood-spattered car was found
with a note that read, in Spanish: ``Forgive me God, but this law
made me do it. We could live better, me and my children, but what
can I do.''
   Salcido's wife, Angela, called Debra Salcido about five weeks
ago and asked why Debra had filed the complaint, which sought
$5,807 in back payments and monthly payments of $511, Debra Salcido
said.
   ``Angela asked whether I would be willing to go to the DA's
office and say that the child was not his and that I had made a
mistake on the birth certificate,'' said Salcido, who refused the
request.
   Her account contradicts earlier reports that Angela was unaware
until the day before the murders that Ramon Salcido had been
married previously.
   Investigators have also speculated that the motive for the
killings was Ramon Salcido's belief that Angela was having an
affair.

<HEAD>Finance Minister Presents Budget Amid Calls For Resignation</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Figures are in U.S. dollars.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OTTAWA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Finance Minister Michael Wilson delivered a widely
criticized federal budget to the House of Commons on Thursday, and
opposition members walked out to protest the leak of the budget to
the media a day earlier.
   The combination of a new 9 percent sales tax on most goods and
services, higher income and corporate taxes and spending cuts
disappointed taxpayers, labor organizations and business groups.
   Wilson released the budget late Wednesday night after leaked
details were broadcast by Global Television.
   Commons Speaker John Fraser went so far as to suspend the House
of Commons to decide whether to allow Wilson to present his budget.
He later permitted Wilson to present it despite protests from the
opposition Liberals and New Democrats, who said the finance
minister had soiled parliamentary tradition by refusing to resign
after the leak.
   Only one opposition member, the Reform Party's Deborah Grey,
remained in the House for Wilson's 10-minute speech.
   Conservative Prime Minister Brian Mulroney defended his finance
minister, blaming an unidentified bureaucrat for the leak, and said
he would not accept his resignation.
   Wilson said the leak ``did not result from negligence ... or
lack of proper security arrangements'' and its premature release
appeared to have resulted from ``a breach of trust, a willful
criminal act.''
   The budget itself, which has a $26.5 billion deficit, did little
to improve the stature of Wilson, a 51-year-old Toronto
stockbroker, within the Canadian business community.
   ``What a mockery is going to be made of us on the world stage,''
said Stephen Wateridge of the Bank of Montreal. The Canadian
Chamber of Commerce called it a disappointment and a lost
opportunity for deficit reduction.
   The budget called for increased taxes on cigarettes, alcohol and
gasoline as well as increases of $1 billion in corporate taxes and
$1.2 billion in personal taxes.
   Plans to develop a nuclear-powered submarine fleet will be
shelved under a strategy to save $2.2 billion in defense spending
over the next five years. In addition, 14 military bases across
Canada are to be closed or scaled down.
   Under the $6.7 billion submarine program, the government was
considering building 10 to 12 vessels according to designs
purchased from France _ for its Rubis-Amethyste-class boat _ or
from Britain, for its Trafalgar-class vessel.
   The budget promises to cut the $26.5 billion deficit in half by
1993-94. It drastically shrinks the proposed national child-care
program. About $1.9 billion in tax breaks for parents will remain,
but $3.4 billion cost-sharing proposal with the Canadian provinces
will be put on hold.
   The leak resulted in the government's rushing out the budget and
forced Wilson to dismantle careful plans to release the budget in
its most favorable light.
   Mulroney blamed an unidentified whistle-blower who he said
leaked the budget to a television reporter.
   Responding to calls for Wilson's resignation, he shouted across
the floor to opponents, ``You should be worried about the guy who
stole the property.''
   Liberal leader John Turner sharply criticized Wilson for not
resigning. He said the rights of every Canadian had been violated
because the leak might have been used for personal gain by those
who had advance notice of the budget contents.
   Neither Turner nor any other opposition member had any evidence
that anyone gained from the budget leak.
   New Democrat Leader Ed Broadbent said Wilson's credibility ``is
now completely shot'' and that the government should withdraw the
budget and present another one later.
   Investigations were being conducted Thursday into the
possibility that people used the advance information in the budget
to make profits on the stock market.
   Police were questioning anyone involved in printing the budget.
Supply Minister Paul Dick told the Commons that ``every single
individual'' among the more than 200 people involved in printing
the budget had been cleared to handle secret material.

<HEAD>President Bush's Elm Tree Came With Tiny Bugs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An American elm tree President Bush
planted on the state Capitol grounds amid great fanfare this week
came with some uninvited guests _ tiny bugs a forester said could
be destructive gypsy moth larvae.
   Bush, who was guest of honor at a tree-planting ceremony Monday
afternoon, brought along the elm, which he said was a descendant of
a tree President John Quincy Adams planted on the White House
grounds.
   Paul Blumhardt, Bismarck city forester, reluctantly confirmed
several tiny, caterpillar-like bugs were picked off the tree after
it was planted.
   ``The tree wasn't unwrapped two minutes when we noticed it,''
Blumhardt said Wednesday. He believes the critters are gypsy moth
larvae, but tests to determine exactly what they are were not
finished, Blumhardt said.
   ``I don't think it's worth causing embarrassment to the
president,'' the forester said. ``He'll say, `The next time I'm
invited to North Dakota, to hell with them.'''
   The ceremony was part of North Dakota's celebration of its 100th
anniversary of statehood. Officials hope to plant 100 million trees
in the state by the year 2,000 as part of the celebration.
   The gypsy moth is common in the northeastern United States. Its
larvae, which can grow to more than 2 inches long, defoliate trees
by eating the leaves.
   The bugs found on Bush's elm tree were less than an eighth of an
inch long, so tiny a microscope was used to get a good look at
them, Blumhardt said.
   The forester said the visible bugs were picked off the tree, and
it was sprayed with an insecticide, as was the truck the tree was
transported in and the burlap in which it was wrapped.
   In six or seven weeks, monitoring traps will be set up around
the tree to make sure there are not any adult gypsy moths around,
Blumhardt said.

   Despite shellfire still rocking Beirut,
Lebanon's rival Christian and Moslem governments and Syria declared
support for the Arab League's call on Thursday for a cease-fire to
halt the seven-week bloodbath.
   Their separate statements came as Syrian and Christian gunners
dueled with mortars and rockets across Beirut's dividing Green Line
_ well after Arab foreign ministers appealed at their meeting in
Tunis for a truce in Lebanon.
   One man was killed and two were wounded in the fighting, which
sent thousands of people scurrying for cover in basements and
underground bomb shelters.
   The Christian Cabinet under army commander Gen. Michel Aoun
pledged to cooperate with a 312-man observer force the Arab League
will send here to monitor the cease-fire, called for noon Friday (6
a.m. EDT).
   ``It is a modest step in the right direction to lift the Syrian
hegemony off Lebanon,'' said a statement issued by Aoun's three-man
military Cabinet after a late-night session.
   The Cabinet welcomed the Arab League call to lift air, land and
sea blockades imposed in the latest round of Lebanon's 14-year-old
civil war.
   It ordered that Beirut International Airport, closed since March
12, be reopened simultaenously with the cease-fire deadline.
   The Aoun Cabinet also said it will ask the U.N. Security Council
to meet in New York to ``work out a mechanism to implement its
Resolution 425 which calls for Israel to withdraw'' from a border
strip it occupies in south Lebanon.
   Rival acting Prime Minister Salim Hoss, who heads a mainly
Moslem Cabinet, issued a statement in Moslem west Beirut pledging
full cooperation with the Arab League observer force.
   In Damascus, the capital of Syria, the official Syrian Arab News
Agency said the government of President Hafez Assad was
``satisified with resolutions announced by the Arab League on
Lebanon.''
   It quoted unidentified observers as saying the resolutions were
tantamount to a ``slap to Aoun and his isolationist, Zionist gang.''
   Whether the carnage actually would stop after Thursday's
welcoming statements by the warring factions was another question.
Three previous cease-fire calls by the Arab League failed to halt
the fighting.
   The 22-member Arab League's effort to end Lebanon's worst
outbreak of violence in four years came at a two-day emergency
meeting in the Tunisian capital.
   Aoun's 20,000-strong army has been locked since March 8 in
ferocious fighting with an alliance of Syrian troops and Druse
Moslem militiamen.
   By police count, 273 people have been killed and 993 wounded in
the clashes. Most of the victims have been civilians who fell in
the indiscriminate shelling of population centers in and around the
capital.
   Radio stations in the Moslem and Christian sectors of Beirut
interrupted regular programming Thursday to broadcast the Arab
League resolutions.
   Aoun, a Maronite Catholic, has been insisting that the Arab
League make a direct reference to Syrian involvement in the
fighting, instead of portraying the crisis as one between Lebanese
Christains and Moslems.
   He also wants the League to pressure Syria to withdraw an
estimated 40,000 troops stationed in Moslem regions under a 1976
Arab League peacekeeping mandate.
   The Arab League final statement in Tunis said an observer force,
to be commanded by a Kuwaiti officer, would deploy along the
demarcation line between the battling factions, keep points of
passage open and identify the party responsible for any violation.
   It said the League would make $3 million available immediately
to cover start-up costs for the observers, and that full financing
from member countries should be put in place by May 10.
   The mission was set for three months.
   Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk Sharaa told reporters Syria was
ready to give any aid requested by a special six-member Arab League
committee charged with resolving the civil war.
   Fighting broke out two days after Aoun clamped a blockade on
illegal ports run by Moslem militias south of Beirut in an attempt
to restore the long-eroded authority of the state.
   Druse warlord Walid Jumblatt retaliated by shelling the
310-square-mile Christian enclave. The Syrians later joined the
bombardment and besieged the Christians.

<HEAD>Dutch War Criminal Dies After His Release</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ferdinand Aus der Fuenten, a war
criminal jailed for 43 years for his role in deporting tens of
thousands of Dutch Jews to Nazi extermination camps, died less than
three months after his release from a Dutch prison, Dutch
television reported Thursday. He was 79.
   The report, attributed to the prison warden, said Aus der
Fuenten died in West Germany eight days ago and has already been
buried, but it gave no details.
   A telephone operator at the prison in Breda in the southern
Netherlands, where Aus der Fuenten served his term after World War
II, said the warden was not available for comment.
   Aus der Fuenten was released and expelled to West Germany on
Jan. 27 with another convicted war criminal, 87-year-old Franz
Fischer.
   Known as the ``Breda Two,'' they were the world's longest-held
war criminals.
   Their release followed an unusual vote in the Dutch Parliament
and brought angry protest by the nation's still-vocal organizations
of resistance fighters.
   During the war, Aus der Fuenten was an SS administrator of a
body that oversaw the mass deportations of Dutch Jews. Of a prewar
population of 100,000 Dutch Jews, only 10,000 returned from the
death camps.
   A Dutch court sentenced Aus der Fuenten to death in 1950, but
his sentence was commuted the same year.
   In the parliamentary debate that resulted in their release,
Justice Minister Frits Korthals Altes said Aus der Fuenten and
Fischer were ``symbols of Nazi evil and an unending source of of
sorrow and strife. ... Let's rid our society of the miserable
remainder of the two war criminals' lives.''

<HEAD>Eastwood Denies Claims of Lawsuit by Actress Sondra Locke</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Clint Eastwood on Thursday denied claims made
by his longtime companion Sondra Locke in a lawsuit that contended
the tough-guy actor promised to support her for life but has kicked
her out.
   ``I am deeply disappointed and saddened that she's taken this
kind of action,'' Eastwood said in a statement issued by publicist
Deborah Kelman.
   ``It will soon come to light that these accusations are
unfounded and without merit, however, this matter will be dealt
with in an appropriate legal arena. Beyond that I have no
comment,'' Eastwood said.
   Miss Locke, 41, filed the lawsuit Wednesday in Superior Court,
seeking unspecified damages, title to the two homes and an equal
division of property acquired during the couple's 10-year
relationship.
   The lawsuit also claims Eastwood, 58, persuaded Miss Locke, an
actress and director, to undergo two abortions and a sterility
operation because he did not want children.
   Miss Locke, nominated for an Academy Award for the 1968 movie,
``The Heart is a Lonely Hunter,'' co-starred with Eastwood in
``Gauntlet'' ``The Outlaw Josey Wales'' and several other movies.
   According to the lawsuit, Miss Locke began living with Eastwood
in 1978.
   She claimed they broke up in December and that on April 10,
Eastwood removed her clothing, pet parrot and other items from a
Bel-Air home where she was living alone.

<HEAD>Resolution Calls 20 Deaths in Soviet Georgia a Criminal Act</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDS: CORRECTS spelling to Sagdeyev throughout</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Academy of Sciences passed a
resolution last week declaring that the deaths of 20 demonstrators
in Soviet Georgia constituted a ``criminal act'' that signaled
danger to Kremlin reforms, a prominent Soviet space scientist said
Thursday.
   Roald Sagdeyev, a Soviet reformer elected last month to the
newly created Congress of Peoples' Deputies, released the text of
the resolution here.
   Sagdeyev was one of three members of the Soviet Academy of
Sciences, along with human rights activist Andrei D. Sakharov and
Russian historian Dmitri S. Likhachev, who were elected to the
congress and agreed to serve on a parliamentary investigating panel.
   ``The tragic events in Tbilisi (capital of Soviet Georgia)
confirm the sad fact that perestroika is in danger,'' said the
resolution, using the Russian name for Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's reforms.
   Special uniformed troops under the Soviet Interior Ministry, or
MVD, were responsible for using poisonous chemicals, shovels and
clubs to suppress the demonstrations in Tbilisi on April 9, killing
20 people, the statement said.
   ``This unusually cruel act has evoked the deep indignation and
outrage of our entire society,'' said the resolution, which
Sagdeyev said was passed at a meeting of the entire Academy of
Sciences April 21.
   ``It completely contradicts'' the reform program, ``is
completely incompatible with the accepted moral and legal norms of
a civilized government, and must be seen as a criminal act against
the people,'' the resolution said.
   Sagdeyev said the events in Tbilisi were especially troubling
because ``it was the suppression of ethnic Georgians by ethnic
Russian troops'' from the city of Gorky, in central Russia.
   Ethnic Russians form about half the 280 million population in
the Soviet Union, and their political power is far greater than the
numbers would suggest.
   Much of the unrest that has gripped the Soviet Union since
Gorbachev rose to power four years ago has come from residents of
the 14 non-Russian republics who, like the Georgians who
demonstrated, would like greater autonomy from Russian rule.
   The head of the Communist Party in Georgia, Givi Gumbaridze,
newly appointed after the April 9 deaths, has confirmed reports
that some of the demonstrators were killed by a toxic gas, the
exact nature of which has not been disclosed.
   Sagdeyev said it appeared final approval for using the MVD
troops against the demonstrators came from local officials in
Georgia.
   ``I do not think we should put all the blame on central
authorities,'' he said.
   Unrest in Georgia took a violent turn in part because of young
extremists among the demonstrators and in part because local
Communist Party officials were out of step with the populace, he
said.
   Far larger demonstrations in the Baltic republics of Lithuania,
Latvia and Estonia by and large have not resulted in violence, with
the exception of a police crackdown in Lithuania in September 1988
that resulted in no deaths but led to the removal of the local
party chief.
   ``I think that there is much better understanding in the Baltic
republics between the communist authorities and the popular
fronts'' which have been formed there, he said.
   Sagdeyev said the paramilitary anti-riot units involved in the
Georgian violence were formed under the MVD last July after the
Supreme Soviet drafted legislation banning anti-Soviet
demonstrations. Sagdeyev was one of 31 members of the Supreme
Soviet or parliament who voted against the legislation when it was
passed last October. Sagdeyev said he viewed the law as a threat to
reform and would seek to have it repealed.
   ``The anti-perestroika forces are becoming stronger and more
active than we would like to believe. Their main weapon is the
concealment and distortion of truthful information,'' said the
Academy of Sciences resolution, which was drafted in large part by
Sagdeyev.
   Gorbachev, president of the Soviet Union and general secretary
of the Communist Party, consolidated his rule on Tuesday by
accepting the resignations of 74 aged voting members of the
301-member Central Committee.
   Those who resigned had lost the party or government jobs that
had won them spots on the Central Committee, and were viewed widely
as potential threats to Gorbachev's reform.

<HEAD>Actor George Coulouris Dies At 85</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Actor George Coulouris, who played cold-hearted
lawyer Walter Parks Thatcher in the 1941 Orson Welles' movie
classic ``Citizen Kane'' and specialized in villains throughout his
career, has died, his wife said Thursday.
   English-born Coulouris, who spent more than 20 years in the
United States and worked in Hollywood in its heyday, died Tuesday
of heart failure brought on by Parkinson's disease, Elizabeth
Coulouris said from their north London home.
   His notable roles included a blackmailing Romanian count in the
1943 movie ``Watch on the Rhine,'' a Nazi posing as a Belgian
patriot in ``The Master Race'' in 1944, a treacherous territorial
magnate in the 1946 western ``California,'' and the bogus
psychiatrist who invites Claudette Colbert to commit suicide in
``Sleep My Love'' in 1948.
   Later films in which he appeared included Carol Reed's ``An
Outcast of the Islands'' in 1951, ``Papillon'' in 1973, ``Mahler''
in 1974, and ``Murder on the Orient Express'' also in 1974.
   Coulouris was also an accomplished stage actor. In the 1930s, he
appeared with the Mercury Theater company founded by Welles, and
gave arresting stage performances in London as a ruthless agent in
Clifford Odet's ``The Big Knife'' in 1954 and as Gen. Sikorski in
Rolf Hochhuth's controversial ``Soldiers'' in 1968.
   Born Oct. 1, 1903 to a Greek father and English mother in
Salford in northern England, Coulouris ran away from home to become
an actor against his businessman father's wishes.
   Tall, impressive and with powerful hooded eyes, he attended the
prestigious Central School of Speech and Drama in London, studying
with Peggy Ashcroft and Laurence Olivier.
   He made his London stage debut in Shakespeare's ``Henry V'' in
1926, went to New York in 1929 and landed his first major stage
roles.
   He made friends with Welles while appearing in the Broadway play
``Ten Million Ghosts'' and later recalled in an interview how he
delighted in taking the American actor, producer and director
``down a peg or two.''
   In 1943, Coulouris mounted and starred in his own Broadway
production of Shakespeare's ``Richard III'' but for once his relish
for villainy took him too far. One critic described him playing the
evil hunchback king as ``a screen Bela Lugosi crossed with a
grand-opera Quasimodo.''
   In the early 1950s, Coulouris returned to live in Britain,
joining the Bristol Old Vic theater company where he played the
name role in French playwright Moliere's famous 17th century comedy
``Tartuffe.'' In 1970 he played Big Daddy in a London stage
production of Tennessee Williams' ``Cat on a Hot Tin Roof.''
   He appeared in many British films, stepping out of his sinister
acting persona to play comedy in the 1954 movie ``Doctor in the
House.''
   In the the 1960s and 1970s he tried his hand at horror movies,
appearing in ``The Skull'' in 1965, ``Blood of the Mummy's Tomb''
in 1971 and ``The Antichrist'' in 1975.
   Coulouris once told an interviewer: ``I'm never in line for an
ordinary part _ an English barrister (lawyer), say, with some
sensible line to deliver. Some silly bastard always says:
Coulouris? He's a foreigner, isn't he?''
   He once listed his favorite stage roles as Othello, Macbeth and
King Lear.
   The large, powerful performer disliked television, claiming its
small screen restricted an actor's range. ``Television has wrecked
acting because it's impossible to make a stirring success,'' he
said in an interview.
   He is survived by a son and a daughter from his first wife,
Louise, who died in 1976.

<HEAD>Physicians' Marriages Among Most Stable, Study Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Contrary to widespread opinion, physicians'
marriages are among the most stable in the United States, according
to a new study based on census data.
   The proportion of physicians who were divorced in 1980 was
significantly lower than the proportion of men and women in other
occupations who were divorced, said the study, published in
Friday's Journal of the American Medical Association.
   But compulsive personality traits among physicians result in
many having discordant and unhappy marriages _ even those that
don't end in divorce, suggests a report accompanying the study.
   The report describes the marital problems observed among 320
couples attending workshops for physicians and their families.
   The study, however, said a review of scientific literature fails
to support the belief that physicians' marriages are poorer in
quality than those of others.
   Many books and articles portray physicians as poor marriage
partners due to what is described as a compulsive need to work long
hours, a need to feel all-powerful and inattentiveness to their
spouses, the authors wrote.
   But no sound evidence exists that physicians have marriages of
lower quality than other groups, said the authors, William J.
Doherty of the University of Minnesota at St. Paul and Sandra K.
Burge of the University of Texas at San Antonio.
   ``The bulk of the large body of literature regarding physicians'
marriages, while humanly interesting and challenging in its
damaging portrait of medical marriages, lack minimum scientific
standards for drawing generalizations about physicians as a
group,'' the authors wrote.
   The 1980 census data analyzed in their study involved a sample
of 74,822 male and 11,462 female physicans. The proportion of male
physicians who were divorced was 43 per 1,000, 22 percent lower
than the 55 per 1,000 proportion for the rest of the employed male
population, the authors said.
   The proportion of men divorced in other professional
specialities was also 55 per 1,000 and was 56 per 1,000 for male
lawyers and judges.
   The proportion of female physicians who were divorced in 1980
was 82 per 1,000, 23 percent lower than the 106 per 1,000 for the
rest of the employed female population.
   Females in other professional specialties had a significantly
higher proportion (93 per 1,000) who were divorced, and the
proportion of female physicians divorced was 35 percent lower than
than the proportion (127 per 1,000) of female lawyers and judges
divorced, the authors said.
   The accompanying report said, however, that physicians'
marriages are often characterized by a ``strategy of
postponement,'' in which physicians continually put off
participating in family life.
   In coping with the demands of medical education and then
practice itself, physicians learn to postpone gratification,
commitment and intimacy, said the authors, Dr. Glen O. Gabbard of
the C.F. Menninger Memorial Hospital and Dr. Roy W. Menninger of
the Menninger Foundation in Topeka, Kan.

   Shining Path guerrillas shot and killed a
leftist congressman Thursday, the government news agency said. He
was the highest-ranking official assassinated in the nine-year
insurgency.
   Eriberto Arroyo was slain in Chaclacayo, a surburb on Lima's
outskirts, the Andina news agency quoted police as saying.
   The news agency blamed the Maoist guerrillas, but a member of
Arroyo's United Left Party, Sen. Edmundo Murrugarra, blamed the
anti-guerilla death squad, the Rodrigo Franco Command.
   The Franco Command surfaced a year ago, vowing to kill people it
considers leftist guerrillas or their supporters. The government
has denied opposition charges that the group is linked to the
governing center-left Aprista Party.
   Arroyo was a congressional deputy from the United Left, a
coalition of Marxist parties and Peru's second strongest party in
Congress. He was the first legislator killed in the insurgency.
   Murrugarra said a gunman in a vehicle with three others opened
fire as Arroyo and his wife were dropping their three children off
at school.
   The other members of Arroyo's family were uninjured, Radio
Programas said.
   The Shining Path, which seeks to impose Marxist rule, has
assassinated scores of politicians. Most have been from the Aprista
party but officials from the United Left and other parties also
have been slain. None have been congressmen, however.
   In the Amazon jungle, a woman was killed and five people wounded
when a column of pro-Cuban guerrillas raided a river town and held
it for four hours, the Lima newspaper El Comercio said Thursday.
   The respected Lima daily said at least 150 members of the Tupac
Amaru Revolutionary Movement stormed Contamana on the Ucayali
River, 390 miles northeast of Lima, late Tuesday.
   The Interior Ministry said it could not confirm the report.
   Ten defenders in the town's police post traded shots with the
attackers for an hour before running out of ammunition and fleeing
into the surrounding dense jungles, El Comercio said.
   The guerrillas robbed three banks and bombed several government
offices before withdrawing, El Comercio said.
   The Tupac Amaru group, which endorses a Cuba-style Marxism, has
been active since 1984. The group is not connected to the larger
Shining Path.
   Also Thursday, miners across Peru began a three-day strike
demanding that mine owners agree to negotiate all labor contracts
jointly, the union said.
   It was not known how many of the nation's estimated 70,000
miners joined the walkout.
   The National Federation of Mine Workers, which called the
strike, held two strikes over the same issue in the past year.
   Mining was paralyzed mining for three months and losses reached
$400 million, one-third of the annual exports from Peru's most
important industry.
   But the walkouts failed to force private mine owners to accept
the federation demand that labor contracts of mine unions be
negotiated jointly rather than on the current company-by-company
basis.

<TEXT>
   A West German whom U.S. authorities
call ``the world's top techno-bandit'' was sentenced Thursday to 30
additional months in federal prison and a $40,100 fine in a daring,
ill-fated helicopter escape attempt from a federal prison.
   Werner Bruchhausen, 49, was given 30-month concurrent sentences
on both of two counts of conspiracy to escape, in addition to the
15-year term imposed on Bruchhausen for sales of classified
technology to Soviet bloc countries.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Steve Dobson urged U.S. District Judge
William Stafford to exceed the sentencing guidelines for the
attempted escape, discounting the defense contention that
Bruchhausen was entrapped.
   Defense attorney Bruce Culpepper asked the judge to stay within
the guidelines, which called for a maximum sentence of 30 months.
He said no decision had been made on an appeal.
   Authorities foiled Bruchhausen's escape by setting up a U.S.
Customs helicopter as the escape aircraft. He had reportedly
offered to pay up to $250,000 for assistance.
   Bruchhausen was taken into custody by an FBI agent and four
prison officers as he started toward the aircraft that swooped down
over the softball field in the prison recreation yard last August.
   Bruchhausen began serving his 15-year sentence for sales of
classified technology at the Tallahassee prison in May 1987.
   Bruchhausen and three others were indicted in August 1981 in Los
Angeles on charges of conspiracy and violating the Export
Administration Act, the Arms Export and Control Act and federal
income tax laws.
   The 60-count indictment charged that from January 1977 through
June 5, 1980, Bruchhausen and the others ``conspired to export from
the United States various high technology commodities'' to East
Germany and elsewhere without export licenses from the State
Department and Commerce Department.
   Dubbed the ``techno-bandit'' by the U.S. Customs Service, he was
arrested May 8, 1985, in London, extradited the following year and
convicted of wire fraud in 1987.
   Bruchhausen allegedly smuggled a microwave receiver system,
semiconductor manufacturing equipment, a computer system and other
military and scientific items to the Soviet bloc through dummy
corporations in California and West Germany.

   Fourteen winning tickets were picked in
the state's record $115 million lottery jackpot, a computer
analysis showed Thursday, and two winners quickly were claimed by a
group of Ohio factory workers and a Pennsylvania family.
   The big jackpot was totaled at $115,578,980.14, about 30 minutes
after 14 workers from a Windham, Ohio, brick factory arrived to
claim a share of it, said Jim Scroggins, lottery executive director.
   People from Washington, Pa., and East Windsor, N.J., also
claimed to hold winning tickets, but did not arrive at lottery
headquarters Thursday.
   ``I couldn't believe it. I still don't,'' said brick worker
Butch Shavers, 38, of Warren, Ohio.
   Also arriving to claim a winning ticket were Alverto Handel, 65,
of Portage; her son, Jim, 39, of Summer Hill, and her daughter,
Nancy Williams, 34, of Fort Montgomery, N.Y.
   Mrs. Williams said she got six of the winning numbers from a
computerized palm reader at an open-air bazaar when she and her
husband were vacationing in mid-March in the Bahamas.
   ``I didn't believe in them,'' Mrs Williams said of the palm
reader. ``I believe it was just luck.''
   Mrs. Handel added the seventh number, 24, based on the number of
tickets they had purchased.
   Jim Handel is a coal miner, Mrs. Williams is a library
technician at the West Point Military Academy and Mrs. Handel is a
retired house keeper.
   Mrs. Handel said the winning ticket was the first one that she
checked after the numbers were drawn Wednesday night.
   ``I went down the line, sinking my pencil in. Tears came to my
eyes and I couldn't even look at the tickets,'' Mrs. Handel said.
   Scroggins said lottery officials would not be able to confirm
the winning tickets until a second computer analysis is completed.
   Scroggins said each of the 14 jackpot tickets will be worth
$317,524.67 a year, or more than $8.2 million paid out over 26
years.
   The workers from the Harbison-Walker brick factory arrived at
the lottery's headquarters in Middletown, outside Harrisburg, in a
four-vehicle caravan, setting off a wild dash by reporters and
photographers as lottery officials tried to herd the potential
winners into the office by a back door.
   The workers said that they had bought $140 worth of tickets.
Each of them contributed $10 to the pool.
   Scroggins said that it may take until early next week to
validate the ticket presented by the workers, in part because they
do not have a signed, legal agreement among themselves on how their
share of the prize will be distributed.
   In most cases, Scroggins said, jackpot winners call the lottery
first and are told of the necessity of having a lawyer draw up a
dispersement agreement. In this case, he said, the workers did not
call.
   ``They got excited ... and headed on down,'' Scroggins said.
   In Washington in western Pennsylvania, Ed Trapuzzano Sr., said
his niece, Sylvia Ann Trapuzzano, 34, was heading to lottery
headquarters with what she believes is a winning ticket from
Wednesday's drawing.
   However, lottery officials said Thursday afternoon they had not
heard from the woman.
   In East Windsor, N.J., Jay Rosen showed a reporter from New
Jersey Network News a ticket that matched seven of the winning
numbers drawn. Rosen said he owns the ticket with his parents, a
brother and a sister.
   He said the family waited in line one hour too buy $80 worth of
tickets.
   A week of millionaire fantasies ended Wednesday night with the
drawing of the 11 Super 7 numbers. The numbers were
06-16-24-34-35-37-40-41-45-60-71.
   Smaller payouts for matching four, five or six numbers will be
determined by Friday. Prizes for matching six numbers are usually
several thousand dollars; for five they are usually several hundred
dollars and the prize for matching four numbers is $7.
   Lottery security was tightened last year after a bogus jackpot
ticket was presented to lottery officials and a check was issued.
Further checks revealed the ticket was fake, prepared by a computer
technician with access to the lottery system.
   Payment was stopped before the check was cashed and the
technician and an accomplice who claimed the prize were prosecuted.
Two lottery officials were reprimanded.
   ``The validation process is not a two-minute thing,'' Andersen
said. ``It's more like two days. There are extensive security
provisions in place and they will all be followed.''
   The long lines at the state's 3,400 on-line lottery outlets were
generally quieter Thursday.
   ``It's like going from a New Year's Eve party to the morning
after,'' said Rich Mazzocca, manager of a book and card shop in
Palmyra.

<HEAD>U.S. Millionaire Says He's Insulted by Japanese Company</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GENE KRAMER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. corporate takeover strategist T. Boone
Pickens Jr., saying he's ``offended'' by the treatment he received
from a major Japanese auto parts company, served notice Thursday he
will pursue his claim to management rights in the company.
   ``Frankly, I was offended'' by the ``brazen'' action of Japan's
Koito Manufacturing Co. to question his ownership of the largest
single block _ 20.2 percent _ of its stock in refusing him three
seats on its board of directors earlier this month, Pickens told
reporters at the Washington foreign press center.
   He also described it as ``frankly, insulting'' to him as the
largest stockholder to have to read in the newspapers rather than
being told personally that his stock ownership was being challenged.
   ``I not going to walk away from this issue, and neither, I
believe, is Washington,'' Pickens said, describing talks with U.S.
government leaders and members of Congress.
   The millionaire Texas oilman said he is asking neither the U.S.
nor Japanese government ``to bail me out of anything I'm in. I can
take care of myself.''
   But the reaction is very strong in both the administration and
Congress that ``something must be done as far as opening up''
Japanese financial markets to equality for foreign buyers, he added.
   ``I don't think the Japanese are going to be able to sit back
and continue to pick and choose in our country what they want to
buy, what they want to invest in and want to own without having the
same opportunities for Americans in Japan,'' he said. ``It's that
simple.''
   ``I don't think you're going to be able to do much about the $55
billion trade deficit with the Japanese unless you do something to
open up markets.''
   Pickens said he reported on his experiences in Japan to Japanese
Ambassador Nobuo Matsunaga in addition to U.S. Commerce Secretary
Robert Mosbacher, Trade Representative Carla Hills, other U.S.
officials and members of Congress.
   Legislation already has been suggested to establish reciprocity
in financial markets, Pickens said, adding, ``I wouldn't want to
see anything foolish'' proposed, and the best thing would be for
the two countries to cooperate in opening markets.
   ``I see the Japanese pouring $15 billion into our country buying
real estate and ranches, other ownership. They're treated just
exactly like other stockholders in this country, but ... there's
some reason we're not wanted in Japan.'' Reports from Tokyo said a
tenet of Japanese business culture is that enterprises belong
basically to their employees rather than stockholders.
   ``I plan to attend the annual meeting of Koito in Japan June 29
and will continue to assert my rights as a shareholder, in fact,
the largest one in the company,'' Pickens said.
   He said he purchased the 20.2 percent stock interest in Koito on
March 16 with the knowledge of the Japanese finance ministry which
cleared the purchase two weeks later.
   The company carried out the stock transfer and after that, ``It
is not the management's business'' to question the intention or
circumstances of purchase, he said.
   ``We don't have specific plans to change management or accuse
them of anything, other than I have reason to feel offended by the
way they have treated their largest stockholder,'' Pickens
continued. ``We said we were not hostile. We mean it. We said were
longterm. We mean it. We said we want to work with management and
expand markets. We mean it.
   ``I was told you don't understand Japanese customs. ... I said
maybe not customs, but I understand ownership, and we are your
largest owner.''

<TEXT>
   A federal judge said his decision to
release 4,200 Austrian-made rifles impounded as part of a Bush
administration ban on imported assault weapons still leaves a
bigger question far from settled.
   U.S. District Judge William Acker Jr. said the rifles should be
released to Gun South Inc. of nearby Trussville ``while the broader
national debate continues to rage.''
   His ruling came Wednesday in Gun South's lawsuit, apparently the
first challenge of the administration's temporary ban on
importation of semiautomatic rifles.
   Acker criticized the ban, initiated by federal drug policy
coordinator William Bennett, as ``obviously the product of a
`hurry-up' skull session, if not a stampede reaction set off by
Bennett.''
   Acker said the government must release 1,200 Steyr AUG-SA rifles
impounded by the U.S. Customs Service at the Birmingham airport,
and allow another 3,000 to be sent to Gun South from Austria.
   His ruling does not directly affect the moratorium on additional
import permits for 29 other kinds of assault rifles until the
administration decides whether they are used for legitimate
sporting purposes.
   But the judge criticized even that part of the policy,
contending the administration overstepped its bounds and interfered
with Congress' right to enact laws.
   Justice Department spokeswoman Amy Brown said in Washington the
department was reviewing Acker's decision and had yet to decide
whether to appeal. An appeal could delay delivery of the guns,
which sell from $900 to $1,000 each.
   ``I applaud the judge's decision,'' said James J. Baker, federal
affairs director of the National Rifle Association while attending
an NRA meeting in St. Louis.
   At an April 6 hearing before Acker, a Justice Department
attorney described the ban on assault weapons as a life and death
matter, but Gun South argued that the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms approved import permits for the rifles before
the ban was announced in late March.
   Gun South owner Don Wood testified that the ban could put him
out of business.
   Semiautomatic weapons became an issue after reports of their use
in drug-linked killings and in the slaying of five children and the
wounding of 30 others in a California schoolyard in January.
   Acker said the government offered no evidence that the Steyr
AUG-SA failed to meet the hunting qualification contained in the
ban.
   ``To the contrary, all of the evidence in this case demonstrates
that the Steyr AUG is designed and marketed to be predominantly a
sporting weapon,'' the judge said.
   He said that the ``only thing that has changed is an
administration in Washington and perhaps the perception of the
proportion of the drug and gun crisis.''

<HEAD>Serial Killer's Ninth Victim Identified As Mother of Two Boys</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The ninth victim of a serial killer apparently
preying on prostitutes and drug users in the seaport of New Bedford
was identified Thursday as a 25-year-old New Bedford woman with two
sons.
   Sandra Botelho was reported missing by her family last August,
and investigators said she probably was killed at that time. Her
body was largely decomposed when highway workers discovered it
Monday in the brush along Interstate 195 in Marion.
   Martin said both the circumstances of Botelho's disappearance
and the location of her body were similar to the other eight
victims. All were women between the ages of 25 and 36 who lived in
the New Bedford area and had ties to that city's Weld Square, a
neighborhood known for prostitution and drug sales.
   Martin said Botelho also ``had a history of drug use,'' but he
declined to comment on whether she was a prostitute.
   Botelho's family, meanwhile, struggled to tell her 4- and
6-year-old sons what happened, said her brother, Phillip Amaral.
   ``We told them that their mother didn't run away,'' he said,
crying. ``We told them basically just somebody took their mother
and he was bad to her and hurt her and now their mother died and
went to heaven.''
   Dr. Stanley Schwartz, a forensic dentist at Tufts University,
used dental records to identify the remains at his Boston
laboratory.
   All the victims found so far disappeared from New Bedford
between April and September of last year. The first body was
discovered last July, and the rest have turned up periodically
since. All have been found along highways within a radius of about
10 miles from the center of New Bedford.
   Botelho was one of three missing women whose families had been
awaiting word on identification of the body.
   Bristol County District Attorney Ronald A. Pina has said he has
several suspects, and a grand jury has been hearing evidence in the
case, but no one has been indicted.
   State police using five search dogs continued combing roadsides
for more bodies Thursday.

<HEAD>Canada May Ask Allies To Help Defend It in Arctic</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OTTAWA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The defense minister indicated Thursday Canada may
have to ask the United States to help defend its Arctic areas
because a $6.7 billion plan to develop a nuclear-powered submarine
fleet was left out of this year's budget.
   Asked how Canada could enforce its sovereignty claim over the
Arctic, Defense Minister Bill McKnight said, ``I believe there's an
opportunity through cooperation. We may have to rely more on allies.
   ``There are better was of defending northern sovereignty but
unfortunately we cannot afford those ways,'' McKnight said.
   The United States has a large fleet of nuclear-powered
submarines that have sailed under the polar ice cap, provoking
Canadian protests.
   Only nuclear-powered submarines can patrol the waters under the
polar ice cap. Reactors powering the subs allow them to stay under
water for long periods without having to surface.
   William Rompkey of the opposition Liberal Party said it was
incredible that Canada might have to rely on the United States to
defend Canadian territory.
   ``The whole point of the Conservative policy was to show the
Americans that we are in there defending ourselves. Now they've
done a 180-degree turn and said `leave it to the Americans,''' he
said.
   Since 1987, when the plan to build the submarines was announced,
Conservative ministers insisted the submarines were essential to
assert sovereignty in the Arctic.
   Polls showed that 70 percent of Canadians were opposed to buying
nuclear submarines.
   But McKnight said public opposition had nothing to do with the
decision, which he said was purely economic.
   Peace activists, meanwhile, praised the decision to shelve the
nuclear submarine project.
   ``It proves that organized, sustained public opposition can
indeed make a difference,'' said Ish Theilheimer, head of the peace
group Operation Dismantle, which gathered at its headquarters to
celebrate.
   John Lamb, director of a think tank called the Canadian Center
for Arms Control and Disarmament, congratulated the government for
scrapping the subs but said the decision shouldn't be viewed as a
step toward unilateral disarmament.
   The British and French firms that vied to sell their submarine
designs to Canada issued terse statements expressing disappointment
at the decision.
   Richard Sharpe, editor of the authoritative defense publication
Jane's Fighting Ships, said the decision was ``a disappointment to
(NATO and) all those who believe it is necessary to be able to
contain the Soviet submarine threat.''
   He said Canada's plan to buy either British Trafalgar or French
Amethyste submarines would have been ``a major contribution towards
NATO's anti-submarine warfare capability.''

<HEAD>Three Accused of Spying for CIA May Be Freed</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Three Nicaraguans convicted of spying
for the CIA may be pardoned under a presidential decree sent to the
legislature Thursday.
   The decree names Guillermo Quant Tai, Mario Baldizon and
Auxiliadora Rivas Urbina and was sent to the National Assembly's
Committee for Human Rights and Peace, headed by Nicaragua's former
ambassador in Washington, Carlos Tunnerman.
   The committee is to return its finding next Wednesday for debate
and a vote in the single-chamber assembly.
   Approval is virtually assured. The ruling Sandinista National
Liberation Front controls the assembly with 61 deputies to 35
deputies from six opposition parties.
   The move seems aimed at creating a more democratic image for the
leftist government of this Central American country and comes as
President Daniel Ortega tours Europe seeking more money for
economically distressed Nicaragua.
   Some of the 10 European countries on Ortega's itinerary have
said more aid to Nicaragua depends on government efforts toward
democratization.
   Quant, a Nicaraguan citizen of Taiwanese extraction, was vice
president of the Nicaraguan Chamber of Commerce when he was
arrested in September 1986 on charges of spying for the Central
Intelligence Agency.
   He was accused of being recruited in 1983 and then providing
economic information to the CIA. In a news conference at the time
of his arrest, Quant admitted giving information to the CIA, saying
he did it ``out of curiosity.''
   Baldizon, an official of the Interior Ministry, was arrested on
charges of being a CIA spy and of complicity in treason after his
brother, Lt. Alvaro Jose Baldizon, defected on July 1, 1985.
   He was sentenced on July 22, 1985, to 10 years in prison. A
spokeswoman at the Interior Ministry said Thursday he was released
from prison and placed under house arrest last March 17.
   Ms. Rivas, then a government employee, was sentenced to nine
years in prison on Jan. 9, 1985, on charges of belonging to the
U.S.-supported Nicaraguan guerrillas, known as Contras. The
spokeswoman said Ms. Rivas was allowed to leave prison in January
and live with her family under house arrest.
   On the political front, the government and opposition party
leaders have invited members of a private U.S. group, the
Washington-based Center for Democracy, to act as observers during
the Feb. 25, 1990, presidential election.
   Allen Weinstein, president of the non-profit organization, told
journalists in Managua Wednesday his group will decide by this
weekend if it will accept the invitation.
   Next year's election will be held under accords signed by the
five Central American presidents in El Salvador last Feburary.
Ortega moved up the elections by 10 months and promised to
institute democratic reforms here.
   The Bush administration has expressed doubts about Ortega's
democratic reform program.
   The Center for Democracy was formed by U.S. legislators,
business executives and others concerned about democracy worldwide.
It has sent observers in the past to oversee elections in other
nations.

   The Soviet Union releases 100 million
tons of waste into the air and water each year, but is working to
clean up its pollution, the leading Soviet environmental official
said Thursday.
   ``Damage to our environment costs the Soviet people at least 50
billion rubles ($80 billion) each year,'' said Dr. Feodor F.
Morgun, chairman of the Soviet Commission on the Environment.
   He refused to say, however, if Moscow was willing to join
Western countries in implementing a global ban on ozone-depleting
chemicals by the year 2000.
   Morgun said his commission was recently established to
consolidate the job of nine previous commissions and seven
ministries, some of which had vested interests in industry.
   Scientists and politicians were debating the question at
meetings in Helsinki, Finland. The head of the U.N. Environment
Program said Wednesday that disagreement with the Soviets could
block agreement to phase out chlorofluorocarbons, which are blamed
for depleting the Earth's ozone layer.
   Morgun was in Stockholm for two days of talks with Swedish
officials. He is to sign a Swedish-Soviet agreement on
environmental issues Friday.
   His visit was timed to the third anniversary of the Chernobyl
nuclear plant explosion, which played havoc with reindeer herds in
northern Scandinavia and sent fallout over much of Europe.
   He said Chernobyl taught the Soviets not to decide major
projects without open discussion.
   ``I would not want any other country to go through what we
did,'' he added.
   In a talk at the Royal Swedish Academy of Engineering Sciences,
Morgun reported, ``Our country suffers a great deal from acid rain,
and 100 cities, with more than 50 million inhabitants, are the
worst affected.
   ``Environmental problems are extremely grave in the Ukraine and
other southern parts of the country.
   ``From now on industries which let out more waste than allowed
will have to pay fines, and these will be heavy,'' he said. He
declined to give specifics.
   The Soviet Union recently began cooperating with Finland on how
to curb pollution on the Kola Peninsula, where acid rain from
metals plants have caused acid rain and water pollution.

<HEAD>Eds: INSERTS 4 grafs after 14th graf pvs bgng, `Our objective,' to
UPDATE with criticism of Quayle's trip to American Samoa</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vice President Dan Quayle celebrated
strong U.S.-Australian relations Thursday and in particular praised
Australia for its military defense efforts.
   Quayle, on his second day in Australia, flew here from Canberra,
where he told a press conference the United States would like to
see its friends in the Pacific pick up more of the tab for defense
at a time when Washington is restraining its military budget. But
he praised Australia for its efforts to enhance security.
   ``Australia has been a very very good partner in the alliance
and has taken national security to its heart,'' Quayle said.
   In Melbourne, he attended a black-tie dinner marking
Australian-American Friendship Week, an annual event to honor the
allies' joint effort in the Battle of the Coral Sea in 1942.
   Noting that he was born in 1947, Quayle said, ``I'm the first
vice president to be born after World War II.'' But in the
tradition of the Coral Sea battle, in which the allies repulsed the
Japanese, Quayle said, the two countries ``must continue a
relationship that is dedicated to keeping peace in this region.''
   He did mention one dispute between the two countries, over U.S.
subsidies to wheat growers in an export enhancement program that
the Australians contend hurts their wheat sales in foreign markets.
Quayle said he discussed the issue with Prime Minister Bob Hawke on
Wednesday.
   ``Believe me, I've heard about our trade policy and export
enhancement program ... in no uncertain terms not only from the
prime minister but others,'' Quayle said.
   ``It is still my belief that U.S. trade policy is not hurting
Australia,'' he said.
   But Hawke dismissed Quayle's arguments that subsidies had not
hurt Australia's wheat exports.
   ``The losses are not figments of the imagination. They are cold,
hard and brutally hurtful statistics which have adversely affected
our wheat farms,'' he said.
   Quayle said the United States has made ``every effort'' to see
that Australian markets are not hurt when third countries are
involved in grain trade.
   The vice president said the subsidies are not designed to hurt
Australia. Instead, his aides have said they are aimed at
countering subsidies that the Europeans place on their grain.
   Despite its own subsidy program, Quayle said the United States
is dedicated to free trade.
   ``Our objective is to have free trade. ... Our objective is to
knock down barriers.''
   Meanwhile, the congressional delegate to American Samoa, Eni F.
Faleomavaega, criticized Quayle's two-hour trip to that territory
Tuesday as ``a slap in the face'' to other island nations in the
Pacific.
   The Democratic delegate said U.S. policymakers are insensitive
to the unique economic structures and other problems facing such
nations as Western Samoa, Tonga and Vanuatu, none of which is
affiliated with the United States.
   ``It's time for different thinking in Washington'' regarding the
strategic region, he said, adding, ``I give credit to the Soviet
Union for their efforts to be friends with island countries.''
   During his two-hour stop, Quayle called the American Samoans
``happy campers,'' participated in a traditional ceremony and
declared a public holiday.
   Before leaving Canberra, Quayle visited the Tidbinbilla Space
Tracking Center, a joint operation between the Australians and
NASA, the American space agency.
   Quayle, who is chairman of the National Space Council, made a
brief telephone call to astronaut Charles Bolden in Cape Canaveral,
Fla., to discuss preparations for the space shuttle launch,
scheduled for Friday.
   ``We hope and pray everything goes well,'' Quayle told Bolden.
   The shuttle will carry in its payload a satellite to study
Venus. The staff at the Australian facility will track that
satellite.

   Several came from broken homes and all lived in
a neighborhood surrounded by drugs and crime, but the youths
accused of a savage gang rape of a Central Park jogger were
unlikely attackers, by some accounts.
   ``I deal with kids in trouble. These were not kids in trouble,''
said Bernard Diamond, principal of the junior high school two of
the accused boys attended. ``They come from homes of parents who
care, parents who are as shocked as we are.''
   The victim, a 28-year-old investment banker, remained in a coma
in critical condition Thursday and was on a respirator after
developing pneumonia.
   Eight of her alleged attackers, ages 14 to 17, are in custody.
Two were indicted Wednesday, and on Thursday a grand jury indicted
three more teen-agers who allegedly left her for dead. A fourth
teen-ager was released without bail after a prosecutor told the
judge the grand jury had taken no action in his case.
   When asked afterward by reporters if his client had made a deal
to testify or agreed to a plea bargain, the teen's defense attorney
said no.
   Two other teen-agers were indicted Thursday on charges involving
an earlier attack by the same group on a male jogger, who eluded
his assailants and reported the assault to park police.
   The female victim was jogging alone in the northern end of the
park later on the night of April 19 when she was attacked by a
gang, beaten unconscious with a pipe and heavy rock, raped and left
bound and naked on the ground.
   When she was found four hours later, her body temperature had
fallen to 85 degrees and much of her brain activity had stopped.
   Doctors at Metropolitan Hospital say she may survive, but it's
unlikely she will ever recover completely because of the injuries
to her brain.
   A CAT scan will be done Friday to find out if the woman's brain
swelling has gone down, doctors said Thursday.
   ``By the end of the weekend, we might have a clearer idea of
whether the damage is substantial,'' said Robert S. Kurtz,
assistant chief of surgery at Metropolitan Hospital. He said of
patients injured this badly: ``However `stable' we call them, their
life hangs by a thread.''
   Police said only one of the suspects _ 17-year-old Michael
Brisco _ had a police record. But friends said he was a frequent
churchgoer who played drums for the choir.
   Tim Burns, a 15-year-old schoolmate of suspect Anton McCrary,
15, said: ``He's a good kid, he just followed the wrong crowd. If
you're in the wrong crowd, this could happen to anybody. You have
to make your own decisions, that's all.''
   Lisa Whitten of the national board of the Association of Black
Psychologists said the violence of city life allowed the boys to
bury normal emotions in the frenzy of their attack.
   ``They're human beings who went berserk,'' she said. ``They had
fantasies in their minds _ of being like those on television, the
ones who shoot people, who are powerful, in control, macho,
aggressive, strong.''
   The suspects were being held on charges of attempted murder,
rape and assault and could face other charges.
   The woman apparently was one of several targets of the gang
going ``wilding'' that night.
   The term was new to police but not the activity: For years,
loosely organized packs of marauding youths have roamed the streets
and parks bullying, robbing and attacking victims at random.
   The assailants reportedly used racial epithets in one of eight
assaults during the rampage and discussed ``getting whitey'' or
``getting a white jogger.'' The victim is white and the accused
attackers are black.
   However, law-enforcement experts say victims of the so-called
``wolf packs'' are more often black than white.
   After their arrests, Brisco and Kharey Wise, 16, were roughed up
in an attack by several other inmates and Yusef Salaam, 15, was
attacked by another youth at the Spofford Juvenile Center.
   Questions about the assault reached Washington when a group of
freshmen Republican congressmen said Thursday the incident pointed
up the need for a tougher juvenile justice system.
   ``What we're saying is, If you're going to do big-boy crime,
you're going to do big-boy time,'' said Rep. Chuck Douglas, R-N.H.,
a former state Supreme Court justice. He and fellow members of the
Republican Research Committee Task Force on Crime said that from
age 14 on, youths who commit violent crimes such as rape, armed
robbery, murder or attempted murder should be punished as adults.
   Central Park has a reputation _ largely undeserved, police and
city officials say _ of being a dangerous place.
   ``If this had happened in the streets, it wouldn't be anything
like this,'' said Eva Haws, who takes tourists on carriage rides
through the park.

<HEAD>With AM-Tanker Spill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hearings into the wreck of the Exxon
Valdez next month will examine alcohol abuse, timeliness of
emergency responses and Coast Guard staffing, the National
Transportation Safety Board said Thursday.
   The agency is to hold fact-finding sessions May 16-19 to
determine how the tanker ran aground May 24, spilling more than 10
million gallons of oil, and how to prevent a recurrence, said NTSB
spokesman Alan Pollock.
   Twenty witnesses are expected, although Capt. Joseph Hazelwood,
skipper of the Exxon Valdez, probably won't be one of them, Pollock
said. Hazelwood faces three misdemanor charges, including operating
the tanker while under the influence of alcohol.
   ``The hearing will be the same as the ones that come after a
plane crash,'' Pollock said. ``Our purpose is not to assess blame,
but to have an open hearing and gather facts.''
   Other issues to be explored include fatigue, human factors,
adequacy of the U.S. Coast Guard's drug and alcohol regulations and
the role of the Coast Guard's ``vessel traffic service,'' which
guides vessels through shipping channels in Prince William Sound.
   Also to be examined are the history of the channel where the
wreck occurred, Exxon's and the Coast Guard's policies for
emergency spill responses and reactions from officers on the bridge
of the tanker after the ship ran aground.
   Details of the spill cleanup will be covered by the
Environmental Protection Agency and won't be a part of the hearing,
Pollock said. NTSB member Lee Dickinson will lead the hearing and
be assisted by the agency staff.

<HEAD>Brazil's President Announces Emergency Measure To Restrict Strikes</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: LEADS throughout, UPDATING with emergency measure restricts
strikes. No pickup</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Jose Sarney announced on
Thursday night an emergency measure restricting the right to strike
and imposing other curbs, saying ``savage waves of strikes''
threaten to undermine democracy in financially distressed Brazil.
   `I do not condemn legitimate strikes guaranteed by the
constitution,'' he said over national TV. ``But I cannot tolerate
the action of hoodlums who through violence occupy factories, or
armed demonstrators who throw bombs.''
   During his 10-minute address, Sarney attacked ``political groups
who do not accept the democratic game'' for what he called illegal
strikes that paralyzed key economic sectors.
   Much of Brazil's economic woes stem from inflation.
   Sarney said his provisional measure _ the equivalent of a
presidential decree _ goes into effect immediately and will force
unions to maintain a emergency work force in essential sectors such
as electricity, communications, hospitals, transportation, water,
fuel distribution, ports and the Central Bank.
   Workers in basic industries and services will have to give
48-hour advance notice before walking out, he said.
   As a third limitation, Sarney said strikes now must be approved
by one-third of the total union membership.
   Sarney, Brazil's first civilian president after 21 years of
military rule, said the government will release more details Friday.
   Congress has 30 days to approve or reject his action. If it
approves, the provisional measure becomes law.
   The president spoke as ports nationwide were idled for a second
day, union officials said, by a strike of 80,000 dock workers for
higher pay.
   ``No ships are being loaded or unloaded at any port in the
country,'' said Jose dos Santos, a union official at the port of
Rio, Brazil's second-largest. The strike does not affect oil
shipments because the state oil monopoly, Petrobras, has its own
loading terminals and separately unionized employees.
   Workers want a standardized pay scale and a pay increase of 180
percent to cope with inflation.
   The right to strike for both public and private workers is
guaranteed under Brazil's new constitution, approved by Congress
last October.
   But Sarney cautioned Thursday night, ``When one goes beyond the
limits of the law, the road to force is opened.''
   He said 8,790 strikes had been called during his four years in
office, including 1,288 so far this year. He said 70 percent were
in the public sector.
   ``I never imagined that among other attempts to undermine
democracy there would be savage waves of strikes,'' said Sarney,
who took office in a 1985 electoral college vote coordinated by
Brazil's top generals.
   Failure of the Sarney government to curb 1,000-percent-a-year
inflation has led to strikes that hit ports, banks, the auto
industry and schools.
   In January, the government announced its fourth anti-inflation
program in three years to control wages and prices, cut government
spending and eliminate up to 90,000 civil service jobs.
   Inflation fell from 28.8 percent a month in December to 3
percent for 11 days in February, but bounced back to 6 percent in
March and was expected to wind up at 7 percent for April.
   The government authorized pay increases of up to 18 percent in
April, unfroze some prices and created a system for 90-day
cost-of-living adjustments.
   But labor groups estimated that workers' buying power fell 49
percent in the last year and threaten to call another general
strike unless 50 percent pay raises are offered.
   Leftist labor unions organized a two-day national strike to
protest the wage freeze. The strike was only partially successful,
but strikes spread in April among teachers, bank workers,
longshoremen and Rio city police.

   An outpouring of sympathy from presidents to

said the queen mother of comedy will live on through television
reruns and her influence on comedy.
   The daffy, redheaded comedian whose harebrained schemes drove
her television family crazy and delighted viewers for four decades
died Wednesday of a ruptured abdominal artery at Cedars-Sinai
Medical Center. She was 77 and died eight days after emergency
heart surgery.
   A private burial was planned, reportedly with no funeral
services in accordance with Miss Ball's wishes.
   ``God has her now, and, thanks to television, we'll have her
forever,'' said comedian and longtime friend Bob Hope.

   A gun-wielding father who tearfully unhooked his
comatose son's life-support system and held him until the baby died
has been charged with murder for an act he said he committed
``because I loved my son.''
   Rudy Linares entered the hospital room of his 16-month-old son,
Samuel, and unhooked the boy's ventilator, holding hospital workers
at bay with a .357-caliber Magnum handgun, police said.
   ``No one has the right to take the law into his own hands,''
said Cook County State's Attorney Cecil Partee. ``The facts of this
case clearly dictate the filing of first-degree murder charges.''
   At the hearing Wednesday night, prosecutors said the 23-year-old
Cicero house painter should be held without bail on the murder
charge because the gun was cocked and Linares had threatened to
``kill anybody who interfered.''

   House Speaker Jim Wright is promising
``corrective surgery'' on a $4.7 billion emergency spending bill
that failed when members of his own party broke ranks on the first
major budget vote of the year.
   Wright and his leadership team will have their first opportunity
to recoup next week, when they plan to bring to the floor their
plan to implement a separate deficit-reduction pact with President
Bush.
   In the meantime, Wright promised to retool the emergency
spending measure that was labeled a ``budget buster'' and rejected
Wednesday by Republicans and Democrats at both ends of the
ideological spectrum.
   The bill to expand current spending for veterans, anti-drug
programs and other popular initiatives was forced back to committee
after a leadership amendment to address the budget-busting
complaints was defeated 252-172.

   Complaining of a slowness to embrace his reforms,
Mikhail S. Gorbachev declared that food and housing shortages are
worsening because economic mismanagement remains rampant and
workers still loaf on the job.
   The Soviet president's unusually tough analysis came in his
closing address to the Communist Party's policy-making Central
Committee after nearly a quarter of its members were retired _ many
of them holdovers from pre-Gorbachev days.
   Gorbachev said citizens vented their anger March 26, when at
least three dozen senior Communist Party candidates were defeated
in parliamentary elections _ the country's first contested vote in
seven decades.
   ``People respond badly to shortages and to queues that take time
and, to put it frankly, humiliate people,'' he said. The official
Tass news agency reported on Tuesday's speech to the closed-door
session a day later.

   A retarded, AIDS-stricken 7-year-old girl has
been allowed to sit in a classroom without staying in an isolation
booth for the first time in her life.
   U.S. District Judge Elizabeth A. Kovachevich on Wednesday
cleared the way for Eliana Martinez to attend Manhattan Exceptional
Center today. The ruling ended her mother's 2{-year battle against
school officials who feared a health risk.
   The child, who's been taught at home since June 1987, was once
told she could attend class on the condition she remained isolated
inside a glass booth. But the issue of a partition became moot when
Kovachevich decided Eliana posed no significant threat to her
classmates.
   ``I'm so happy. I don't have bitterness for anything,'' said her
adoptive mother, Rosa Martinez. ``My daughter is not a monkey. I've
always said that. All she understands is she will be going in to
play with some little people. She doesn't know what school is; she

   A clerical error caused United Airlines to skip a

jetliner two months later, killing nine people, a company executive
testified.
   But company officials stressed that the Boeing 747 door had been
inspected in November 1988, three months before the accident, and
no problems were found.
   Robert Doll, United vice president for technical services, told
federal investigators Wednesday the airline was unaware it had to
inspect the locking mechanism after the cargo door was repaired
Dec. 23 in Chicago.
   On Feb. 24, the door and part of the fuselage tore off as United
Flight 811 was climbing to 23,000 feet 85 miles southwest of
Honolulu. Nine passengers were sucked out of the hole.

<TEXT>
   George Bush brought to the White House a
Cabinet steeped in Washington experience, but it is one of his
outsiders, Samuel S. Skinner, who has taken the most visible role
100 days into his administration.
   The transportation secretary has taken charge in major aviation
and automobile issues. But he's also emerged as the
administration's point man in areas that stray into the territory
of others in the Bush Cabinet: the Alaska oil spill, the Eastern
Airlines strike, and fighting drugs and terrorism, to name a few.
   ``He's shown good instincts,'' said Norman Ornstein, scholar at
the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. But
Ornstein questions how much ``staying power'' the former federal
prosecutor and head of the Chicago mass transit system will have.
   Bush also came into office with a pledge to hit the ground
running, yet many of his department secretaries have moved slowly
in their new jobs.
   ``All of them are somewhat limited by the defining
characteristic of 1989 _ there ain't no money,'' said Stephen Hess,
senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, a liberal think tank.
   That financial reality of big deficits limits the initiatives
available to any of the administration's domestic Cabinet
secretaries.
   But even Bush's senior-most Cabinet member, Secretary of State
James Baker III, whose appointment was announced the day after
Bush's election, has moved slowly in building a team and taking
foreign-policy initatives.
   Many of the departments are still without confirmed appointees
in top-level jobs, with 49 nominations pending before the Senate
and more still to be made. Some of the independent agencies are
hampered too: the Federal Trade Commission has no chairman, and the
Consumer Product Safety Commission doesn't have enough members for
a quorum.
   Here is a brief look at the Cabinet:
   _State. Baker is an old Bush friend who ran his presidential
campaign and is a veteran of the Reagan administration. He has
concentrated on improving NATO ties but also started negotiations
in the Middle East and worked out a deal with Democrats in Congress
to permit non-lethal aid to the Nicaraguan Contras, at least until
the fall.
   So tightly have Baker and his closest aides held control that
experienced diplomats have grumbled that they were being ignored.
   _Defense. Dick Cheney has taken charge forcefully at the
Pentagon and helped the administration put behind the debacle of
John Tower's defeated nomination. In a month on the job, he has
faced a budget agreement requring him to find $10 billion worth of
cuts in next year's budget. He has moved to cut spending for the
``Star Wars'' nuclear defense, ship building, troop strength, and
the new stealth bomber, and he has put together a combined MX and
Midgetman missile program.
   _Transportation. When the Machinists Union walked out on
Eastern, Bush named Skinner to speak for the administration. He
rejected union appeals for the government to step in, and while the
strike drags on, it has brought no major disruption in air traffic.
   Bush also had Skinner, whose department includes the Coast
Guard, oversee the cleanup of oil spilled by the tanker Exxon
Valdez in Alaska's Prince William Sound. Skinner also has pushed
for tougher auto mileage standards.
   _Labor. Elizabeth Dole slipped into the background in the
Eastern strike, although it was threatening to spread and she had
the double qualification of being a former transportation
secretary. Still, she has led administration efforts in Congress to
limit a minimum wage increase and for its tax-credit child care
proposal.
   _Health and Human Services. Louis Sullivan has kept a low
profile after a bruising confirmation, when he was attacked by
abortion foes for remarks supporting a women's right to an
abortion. Sullivan apologized and said he had misspoken. Since
then, the White House has nominated assistants that are known for
anti-abortion views.
   _Justice. Dick Thornburgh, a Reagan holdover, is a moderate
former governor who has moved rightward as attorney general,
becoming the administration's advocate for drug testing and
overturning the Supreme Court's ruling that permits abortion.
   _Treasury. Nicholas Brady, another of the Reagan holdovers, has
won plaudits for tackling two of the toughest economic issues, how
to rescue the savings and loan industry and what to do about the
Third World debt crisis. But he's come in for criticism, in part
because of public miscues as the administration's chief economic
spokesman, giving what seemed to be indifferent responses regarding
problems of the deficit and inflation.
   _Commerce. Robert Mosbacher, a Texas oil millionaire and Bush
friend, fought to protect U.S. technology in the FSX fighter deal.
But he has not yet been elevated to the front-ranks of economic
decision-making.
   _Housing and Urban Development. Jack Kemp has drawn praise from
all sides for bringing attention to homelessness and other urban
ills, and has attacked drugs in public housing by moving to ease
evictions. He also won administration backing for tax credits for
urban enterprise zones. But urban advocates are waiting to see
money to go with his ``conservative war on poverty.'' The question
for Kemp is: Can he meet the expectations he has raised?
   _Interior. Manuel Lujan was frozen out of initial decisions on
the oil spill, while Skinner and EPA chief William Reilly
dominated. He's made public misstatements and been criticized as
uninformed by environmentalists.
   _Education. Lauro Cavazos has been more conciliatory and less
visible than his controversial predecessor, William Bennett. But he
has offered only a modest package of education initatives,
proposing spending that does not even keep up with inflation,
despite Bush's campaign pledge to be ``the education president.''
   At the other posts, James D. Watkins has yet to take a major
initiative at Energy, and Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter has
attacked foreign agriculture subsidies but also has been late in
hiring his team. At Veterans Affairs, the newest department, Ed
Derwinski has been praised by veterans' advocates for openness and
for winning approval from the White House to ask Congress for a
small supplemental appropriation this year.
   Office of Management and Budget Director Richard Darman has
Cabinet-level status, as does Trade Representative Carla Hills. She
has talked tough on the trade deficit but taken few real steps,
while Darman was chief architect of the White House budget
agreement with Congress. While it has been ridiculed as only
papering over the problem, it has allowed Bush to keep his
no-tax-increase pledge.
   Drug policy chief Bennett, while pointedly not given Cabinet
status, has drawn attention as if he had it, raising gun control as
an issue and winning at least a temporary ban on the importation of
semiautomatic weapons.

<HEAD>Eds: ``Getting It Right'' Opens May 5</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HILLEL ITALIE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In ``A Room With a View,'' Helena Bonham Carter
plays a young heiress struggling against the repressive atmosphere
of turn-of-the-century England. The actress felt equally confined.
   ``Maggie Smith and Daniel Day Lewis had the funny lines, but I
was on screen all the time,'' she said. ``I was the stooge in a
way. I wish I could have had the funny lines. I felt deprived.''
   Tired of portraying ``ever so nice, often corseted girls,''
Carter begged for a chance to play Minerva, the promiscuous
daughter of Sir Gordon Munday in ``Getting It Right,'' an English
comedy.
   ``They sent me a script because I have some sort of name,'' she
said. But Randal (Kleiser, the director) was somewhat doubtful I
was right for the part and thought I wouldn't be able to do it.''
   Carter's persistence won out, however, and not only did the
actress have fun with the character, but the role of her father was
filled at the last moment by Sir John Gielgud.
   ``I bumped into him the first day and he said, `I've heard so
much about you. Congratulations. And I said, `Congratulations on
your career.'''
   She remembered the great Shakespearean actor as being ``very,
very shy and terribly modest. There was great reverence on the set.
He would cringe with extra shyness because of everybody's sheer
reverence. He was very professional. He was also very nervous and I
was touched.''
   Carter has become accustomed to working with experienced actors.
Her film debut came in 1985 as the title character in ``Lady
Jane,'' in which she played opposite several members of the
Shakespeare Company.
   ``A Room With a View'' had a high-powered cast, including Smith,
Denholm Elliott and Julian Sands. Besides Geilgud, ``Getting It
Right'' features the veteran British actors Lynn Redgrave and Peter
Cook.
   ``Stars don't exist as such in England,'' Carter said. ``They
are more actors who are revered. There's much less said about their
sex lives. I think it has to do with the fact that there's not so
much money involved.''
   Carter had a chance to witness fame, American style, when she
was a guest star in an episode of ``Miami Vice.''
   ``Don Johnson couldn't walk the streets. I thought, if this is
what the star system does, I prefer not to know about it. Alec
Guinness is very famous and he can go out and not get recognized.''
   She talked of her fondness for doing things ``out of context,''
such as following a period piece such as ``A Room With a View''
with a contemporary comedy. Even her decision to become an actress
originated from a liking for the unexpected.
   ``I was intensely shy as a child. It was the last thing I
expected to do, stand up in front of an audience, which is why I
did it. It's extending yourself and exposing yourself to the
extreme,'' she said.
   ``Actors are considered egotists, but on the whole it's
generosity; you're giving of yourself.''
   But Carter did not see acting as a full-time profession, even
when she was chosen by director Trevor Nunn to play the teen-age
queen who was beheaded after nine days in ``Lady Jane.''
   ``He said, `Get that girl, she does look quite arresting.' He
told me to learn the part in 48 hours. I learned a speech from
`Romeo and Juliet' and I had about one month of auditions and
screen tests.
   ``I was about to go to Oxford and my life went into a completely
different tangent. It took me three years to realize that it's not
a tangent, that it's all connected.''
   The day after completing ``Lady Jane,'' Carter was contacted by
director James Ivory, who along with producer Ismail Merchant was
putting together the cast for ``A Room With a View.'' She felt
relaxed in the interview with Ivory, still taking a casual approach
to acting, but tensed up once filming began.
   ``I hated it,'' she said. ``I was learning. It was a case of
being asked to sprint before I could crawl. I didn't give myself
the license to fail. I owe it very much to the people around me. I
didn't realize that I should let myself learn and make mistakes. I
was doing too much.''
   Carter has gained an appreciation for the subtlety needed in
film acting.
   ``In the end you have to find one threadline. It's seeing the
essence of things. It might be just a walk, or a bit of music and
you think, `That's the person.' It's the most economical way of
revealing. Acting is about doing and the less you think it about
the better.''

   It is sometimes said that the stock market is
slave to two masters: interest rates and earnings. But if that's
so, you can't tell it from today's market.
   Stocks react inversely to interest rates, according to the
saying. But today's interest rates are higher than they used to be
and so are stock prices. Shouldn't they be lower?
   And, according to the saying, stocks anticipate earnings
increases by rising months before the fact. But stocks are up these
days, and anticipated earnings aren't what they used to be. Is the
market overpriced?
   Fundamental thinkers, such as Peter Lynch of Fidelity's Magellan
Fund, believe you can't foretell interest rates or the economy, and
that the only sensible thing to do is to buy into sound companies
and hope for the best.
   Throw out all the theories you read and hear about, say these
basic thinkers, because eventually the market will throw them out
anyway. It may be happening now, they say.
   Nevertheless, a very large percentage of the literature
disseminated by brokerage houses is loaded with theories, charts,
graphs, analyses and forecasts of where interest rates and the
economy are headed.
   It's the meat and potatoes of market analysis, even if at the
moment the practicioners are getting sick on their own diet.
   One market analyst states that while a widely anticipated
economic slowdown would have negative implications for corporate
earnings, ``Today's stock market investors have yet to make this
connection.''
   Eventually, he says, they might.
   But what about interest rates? If there is a slowdown, then
interest rates probably would fall. Would the market then rise on
the assumption that lower rates are good for stocks, or would it
fall in response to lower earnings?
   The current situation is an oddity, one of the reasons being
that a weaker economy is widely viewed as good. Ordinarily, a
weaker economy is viewed negatively because it cuts into profits
and throws people out of work.
   Today's economy, however, is believed to be close to capacity,
which is a dangerous thing. Without sufficient slack, upward
pressure on wages, prices and interest rates is created. A bit more
slack, some believe, is called for.
   The theory that the market is enslaved to rates and earnings,
therefore, is suspended for the time being. Undeterred, those who
subscribe to it believe the theory will reassert itself before
summer and fall in reaction to lessened expectations for corporate
profits.
   One of them, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., observes that prices
may be ignoring the evidence that is beginning to unfold _ that
while corporate profits might still achieve records this year, the
rate of increase is decelerating.
   Most published forecasts of corporate profits for 1990, it says,
are mere extrapolations of 1989. This it believes is unrealistic.
Why, says Drexel, there may be a recession in 1990, and ``if this
occurs, we estimate that profits will fall roughly 20 percent next
year.''
   Will profits fall? Will investors make the connection? Will the
market roam free? Or will it become enslaved by that other part of
the saying _ that lower interest rates are good for stocks?
   What the market really seems to be saying is that it is slave to
nothing but the hopes and expectations of investors. If you feed
the market more money, then prices will rise, and if you take money
away, it will shrivel.
   Now that's a maxim you can believe in.

<HEAD>Life of Quiet Isolation in Forgotten Philippine Province</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: CORRECTS to Batanes in 23d graf `They reach'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT H. REID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BASCO, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The jail in this windswept provincial
capital is empty, except for a rusting bicycle stored in one cell
and potted plants in the other.
   ``There are crimes here, but only small crimes,'' said Sgt.
Clementi Cantor, chief of the two-man police force in Basco,
capital of Batanes, the forgotten province of the Philippines.
   This year, Sgt. Cantor has investigated three ``crimes'' _
domestic disputes and fights between neighbors. None was serious
enough for the courts.
   Only 23 crimes were reported in the entire province last year.
The most serious, a murder committed by a soldier, was the first
killing reported in 20 years.
   ``We've had judges come to hear cases and they say it's like a
vacation in the Bahamas,'' said Tess Castillejos, executive
secretary to the mayor.
   The low crime rate is one of many features that make Batanes,
the smallest, most northerly and least developed province, unique
in the violence-plagued Philippines.
   Its 15,000 people, known as Ivatans, live in quiet isolation.
They fish and raise crops and cattle on 10 small islands about 250
miles) north of Manila and only 140 miles south of Taiwan.
   Few outsiders venture to Batanes, whose lush green fields,
mist-shrouded hills and villages on rocky cliffs make it look more
like the Welsh coast than the tropics.
   Telephones? Forget it. The radio-telephone link was cut last
year when communist rebels blew up a relay station on Luzon, the
main Philippine island.
   Batanes is not perfect.
   It has the highest rate of alcohol consumption in the
Philippines. Per capita income is only 416 pesos ($19.80) a month,
so many of the brightest youngsters leave after high school in
search of opportunity.
   ``We need government investments in cattle, fishing, garlic and
root crops and to improve the seaport so our young people can find
jobs here,'' said the provincial governor, Telesforo Castillejos.
   ``Most provinces have an overpopulation, problem but our growth
has been almost nill because of emigration.''
   Typhoons and and other storms batter the islands frequently and
Ivatans live in square, fortress-like stone houses for protection
from them, but there are no communist rebels, no armed gangs and no
beggars.
   Internal combustion engines do not pollute the air in Basco, a
town of 6,000 people. All Batanes has only 120 motor vehicles and
two-thirds are motorcycles.
   If roosters crowing can be called noise pollution, it is the
most common form.
   Lt. Col. Jesus Poblete, provincial military commander, said ``I
don't feel very busy here.''
   His major challenge is the occasional Taiwanese fishing vessel
encroaching on Philippine waters. Otherwise, he said, ``All we do
is run, train and have meetings. I don't have much to do.''
   ``I think it's the perpetual serenity which we don't find in the
metropolitan areas that keeps people here,'' said Tess Castillejos,
an in-law of the governor and native of Batanes who returned with
her husband after several years in Manila.
   ``In Manila, I spent the whole day taking my children to and
from school and driving to stores. Here, I kiss them in the morning
and they come home in the afternoon. I can walk everywhere.''
   Because of frequent storms in the Balintang Channel, commercial
ships do not run regular services between Batanes and Luzon, 140
miles to the south.
   Most supplies come on LST landing craft, which the Philippine
navy uses extensively for inter-island traffic.
   They reach Batanes about every three months. One ran aground in
the harbor during a storm last year and its hulk is still there,
quietly rusting.
   Philippine Air Lines provides the main link with the world, a
daily flight often canceled because of bad weather.
   A siren heralds the plane's arrival and scores of townspeople
usually go to meet it, since the airport is within walking distance
of downtown Basco.
   There is no television and residents can pick up Philippine
state radio for only a few hours a day on a relay from Tuguegarao,
200 miles south.
   That hardly matters because only a few hundred homes in Basco
can receive the part-time electricity. When the juice comes on for
four hours each evening, residents flock to makeshift theaters
where local entrepreneurs show movies at 5 pesos (25 cents) a head.
   Those who have seen the available movies watch or participate in
pickup basketball games in the town square until the electricity
goes off.
   ``Fishing, swimming, biking, that's about all the recreation
here,'' said Aniano Bata, 45, a lifelong resident. ``It's good,
clean fun.''

<HEAD>Rogaine Sales, Results Disappoint Some Analysts And Consumers</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Also on financial wire</HEAD>

   When Rogaine was unveiled last September
by the Upjohn Co. as the first scientifically proven hair-loss
remedy, financial analysts envisioned desperate balding men running
to doctors for prescriptions.
   Today, those analysts and many consumers are disappointed, and
Upjohn is preparing a new, more aggressive marketing campaign aimed
at men whose embarrassment at seeking help for their hair loss may
have prevented them from trying the drug.
   Upjohn says it is pleased with Rogaine's performance and blames
drug-industry analysts _ some of whom predicted 1989 U.S. sales
would top $300 million _ for unrealistic expectations.
   ``Any new product that saw the sales that Rogaine did in the
first few months would be deemed an outstanding success,'' said
Upjohn spokeswoman Kaye Bennett. ``We expected to succeed in the
long run, while the analysts thought it would be a runaway
success.''
   Disappointed consumers also may have set unrealistic
expectations by ignoring Upjohn's warnings that Rogaine wouldn't
work for most men.
   Though Upjohn does not release sales figures for specific
products, drug industry analyst Ronald Nordmann of PaineWebber Inc.
estimated domestic sales for Rogaine accounted for $11 million of
the Kalamazoo-based company's $755 million in net sales for the
first three months of 1989.
   While Rogaine's sales were more than double those for the fourth
quarter of 1988, Nordmann said he interpreted the figures as
disappointing.
   ``The product has certainly been slow out of the starting
gate,'' he said.
   There are many reasons for Rogaine's sluggish sales, researchers
and hair-loss specialists say. Among them:
   _Upjohn's 8-month-old, $20 million advertising campaign,
featuring a man walking along a beach with the ``see your doctor''
phrase, may have been too low-key and vague.
   _The price, about $50 for a one-month supply and the necessary
lifelong commitment to its use.
   Once you stop using Rogaine, any hair you may have grown back
will fall out. If the drug has stopped your hair loss, you'll make
up for lost time as soon as you quit.
   Most baffling, however, is that companies featuring bogus
baldness remedies on late-night television continue to outsell
Rogaine by a ratio of about 10-to-1, said Mike Mahoney, president
of the American Hair Loss Council.
   ``The biggest deterrent to Rogaine is that the man has to go to
his doctor and admit that he is not comfortable with his hair loss.
With the others, he can call a 1-800 number from the privacy of his
own home,'' said Mahoney, whose non-profit organization provides
consumer information on hair-loss treatments.
   Upjohn's new marketing campaign, beginning in mid-May, will
feature a toll-free number. The consumer will be connected with a
hair-care specialist to discuss Rogaine and then will receive
information on Rogaine via mail.
   Like the previous ads, Upjohn still won't refer to the drug by
name. U.S. Food and Drug Administration regulations prohibit
companies from advertising prescription drugs by name unless there
also is a full disclosure of any warnings and potential side
effects.
   The company has released few details about its new marketing
strategy, but says it's designed to identify and target the market
for the drug, which was approved by the FDA last August.
   Though analysts see the new campaign as Upjohn's reaction to
slow sales, the company insists the more aggressive campaign always
was part of its marketing strategy.
   Some of the blame for disappointment with Rogaine's results also
lies with the consumer, who may have been expecting too much.
Upjohn warned consumers from the start that the tonic wouldn't work
at all for most men.
   Rogaine, the trade name for a substance called minoxidil, is
recommended for men younger than 40 who have been losing hair for
10 years or less and who have an area of baldness 4 inches in
diameter or less on the crown of the head.
   Clinical trials showed about 39 percent of men suffering from
male-pattern baldness will either grow some new hair back or stop
losing hair after six to eight months on the drug.
   ``If you're going to use this stuff, you've got to be patient
and use it for a year,'' said Dr. David Whiting, medical director
of the Baylor (University) Hair Research and Treatment Center in
Dallas, Texas. ``Otherwise, you'll never know if it would have
worked.''
   Bert Camp, a railroad engineer in Mineola, Texas, saw results
after about three months on Rogaine.
   ``Since I started using it, I've definitely seen some new hair
growing,'' said Camp, 46. ``And for 10 years, I've been using
everything that I could get my hands on to stop hair loss.''
   Still, Camp said Rogaine was ``too expensive, especially since
I'm going to have to use it for the next 20 or 30 years.''
   At the 2,270-store Rite Aid pharmacy chain in Harrisburg, Pa.,
spokeswoman Suzanne Mead said Rogaine sales had been slower than
expected.
   Rogaine may almost double its market if the FDA approves it for
use by women. Of the 50 million Americans losing their hair, 20
million are women, and clinical trials have found the drug to be
slightly more effective on women, Bennett said.
   Upjohn also is working on advanced application methods for the
alcohol-based solution, which tends to be messy to apply, as well
as teaming up with Procter &amp; Gamble Co. on new ingredients designed
to increase efficacy and create new minoxidil products, such as a
cream.

<HEAD>Bush and Congress: Still On a Honeymoon</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush, charting a new course for
relations with Congress, is taking lawmakers on a 100-day honeymoon
of classic proportions, and usually feisty Democrats are declaring
themselves delighted.
   ``What Bush is trying to do is restore the trust that needs to
exist between the Congress and the White House in order to get
things done,'' says House Democratic Whip Tony Coelho, D-Calif., a
fierce partisan when he wants to be but mellow toward the president
these days.
   House Majority Leader Thomas Foley, D-Wash., says that `'after
what was clearly from our perspective a very harsh and negative
campaign, I think the president immediately offered an approach of
cooperation and conciliation ...''
   ``I think he's doing very well,'' says Foley.
   In his first 100 days, Bush has not only erased most if not all
of the bitterness among lawmakers resulting from the campaign but
administered salve to a Congress shell-shocked after eight years of
combat with Ronald Reagan.
   Still, Bush took a hard political beating in the early going as
the Senate rejected John Tower for secretary of defense. Lawmakers
say the problem was primarily friction between Tower and Senate
Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn, D-Texas.
   Bush made a swift recovery and won quick confirmation for his
second nominee for the Pentagon post, Dick Cheney. But he's headed
for another showdown with Congress over the minimum wage.
   And not all Democrats are buying off on the political nostalgia
trip back to the era of good feeling when presidents almost always
had a 100-day honeymoon with Congress. There is no certainty that
the mood will last, says Senate Democratic Whip Alan Cranston,
D-Calif. ``It's too soon to tell.''
   All the same, ``He's not an arm twister,'' says Cranston. ``He
reasons.''
   Bush compromised with lawmakers on the major issues of Central
America and the budget. ``I think the work we've done these past
three months demonstrates the value of tough, principled
negotiation,'' Bush told the annual meeting of The Associated Press
on April 24.
   The new president, who was a member of the House of
Representatives from 1967-1970, also has gone to work on
congressional egos. Earlier this month, he summoned a bipartisan
group of lawmakers to the Cabinet Room for an open-ended session
also attended by Secretary of State James A. Baker, White House
chief of staff John Sununu and budget Director Richard Darman.
   ``The president said, `I promised consultation and we're going
to consult,''' says Rep. Henry J. Hyde, R-Ill. ``The president
said, `I am concerned about the erosion of presidential authority
and I realize that if presidential authority is to be reinforced,
there must be consultation ...'''
   Skeptics hold that the new climate has been simple enough to
engineer, given the lack of hard choices thus far. The budget
compromise envisions meeting the $100 billion deficit ceiling for
fiscal 1990 prescribed by the Gramm-Rudman law but relies on
projections, such as $5.4 billion in new revenue, that have fiscal
experts squinting doubtfully.
   Many conservatives signed off on Bush's compromise plan to send
$90 million more in non-lethal aid to Contra rebels opposed to
Nicaragua's Sandinista government. Resigned to a firm anti-Contra
majority on Capitol Hill, they say it was the best the president
could have hoped for. But they still smoulder quietly at a
provision that will allow congressional leaders to short-circuit
the aid next fall if they are dissatisfied with the situation.
   The one issue where Bush and Congress appear to be on a head-on
collision course is the minimum wage. The president is threatening
to a veto of an increase approved by the Senate. Indeed, the White
House almost seemed to seize on the conflict as proof that
old-fashioned, head-butting politics are not extinct in Washington.
   ``I don't know what he's building up all this good will for,''
chortles Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass. ``When substance comes up,
people aren't going to go into the tank for you, just because
you're a nice guy.''
   Conservatives wonder if Bush might not be just a little too
affable for his own good. ``It's conceivable that Bush starts out
with this modest beginning and then really goes to town,'' says
Patrick McGuigan, a fellow of the Free Congress Foundation. ``But
that's not the normal pattern of presidencies.''
   ``Politics,'' says McGuigan, ``is about many things _
negotiation, necessary compromises, governing _ but at its bottom
line, politics is about confrontation and disagreement ... Where is
that agenda forcing confrontational votes in the Congress of the
United States? It's not there.''
   More pragmatic Republicans scoff at that notion. Bush, they
note, was not swept in amid clarion calls for a sweeping overhaul
of the system.
   ``George Bush did not come in what that same mandate'' that
Reagan had, reflects former White House Communications Director Tom
Griscom. ``This is not a time of confrontation. We're now trying to
improve what is already there.''
   ``What is legislation except compromise?'' says Washington
lobbyist Tom Korologos, a former chief of White House congressional
relations. He sees the Bush style as the normal product of the
president's career as a professional insider adept in his knowledge
of the ropes and levers of government.
   Even a few Democrats, however, wonder if Bush may not be missing
an opportunity to whisk through a few favorite programs before the
honeymoon ends.
   ``If there was anything on the Bush agenda, this was the time to
do it,'' says political consultant Gregg Schneiders, a former
adviser to the Carter White House. He sees a fat and happy America
that cares little about Capitol Hill conflicts. ``They're not
looking for a lot of activism and his style tends to fit in with
the public mood.''
   ``It's not absolutely necessary,'' says Horace Busby, one of the
inner circle in Johnson White House, ``to make a big show of muscle
and chutzpah and macho. He just has to show that he's not weak.''
   That represents a change in American politics that Busby traces
in part to ``the decline and virtual disappearance of tension and
potential conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union.
There's nothing to have a crisis about, and so Congress convenes
and goes about its business ... Where's his vision? Where's his
plan? He doesn't have to have one.''
   ``None of this will hurt much as long as the conditions that
elected him continue to prevail,'' says Georgetown University
political scientist Michael Robinson. ``... The country doesn't
much care whether he has an agenda or whether he has a philosophy
or whether he's a toady or whether he tries to stand up to
Congress.''
   Almost everyone agrees that a hard political rain would be
guaranteed to fall if there were a recession. For the moment,
though, the sun is shining and both sides instead are reveling in
the fellowship.
   ``All I know,'' says Republican Hyde, glancing across the aisle
to the Democratic side, ``is that Reagan was the hated enemy, the
usurper, he didn't belong there. The attitude toward Bush is that
he belongs there. That he elevates the debate and the level of
discourse considerably.''

<HEAD>U.S., Europe Ponder How To Keep 'Em Down on the Farm</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Probably few Americans believe Mexico or
Canada are likely to invade sparsely populated areas of Texas or
North Dakota when children of long-time farm families decide to
head for the bright lights of the big cities.
   But two Agriculture Department analysts say this fear is part of
a ``territorial imperative'' that is a reason for some European
countries viewing the migration of people from farming areas as a
threat to national existence.
   As a result, they say, these countries spend lots of money and
take extraordinary steps to keep people on the farms as long as
possible.
   Ken Deavers and Dick Long of the department's Economic Research
Service say the United States and Western Europe have a number of
common goals as they seek government policies that will enhance
rural development.
   ``In spite of agriculture's shrinking share of employment and a
corresponding decrease in its share of (total economic output),
agricultural policy is as difficult to disentangle from rural
development policy in Europe as it is in the United States,''
Deavers said. ``Agricultural and rural well-being are as closely
identified in the popular mind and political processes of Europe as
they are in the United States.''
   Therefore, he said, governments continue to spend huge amounts
of money on farm programs ``because they are uncertain about other
intervention strategies to hold population'' in rural areas.
   ``However, in spite of their popular appeal, farm programs do
little to accomplish that goal,'' Deavers said.
   Deavers, an economist, and Long, a political scientist, said in
the May issue of Farmline magazine that Americans might recognize
the situation in Europe as similar to their own.
   ``Here, despite record-high government ayments to farmers and
record-high farm income in the middle 1980s, farm-dependent rural
communities continue to lose population to metropolitan areas at or
near record rates,'' Deavers said.
   But the reasons behind the heavy spending on farm programs vary
tremendously between the United States and the European Economic
Community, for example.
   Deavers described territorial imperative as the commitment to a
form of economic development that allows people to continue to live
in the countryside, if they choose, and still maintain a living
standard at least close to the national average.
   ``The territorial imperative takes forms in Europe that are
unfamiliar to Americans,'' he said. ``Europeans are concerned with
the ecological consequences of depopulation, what they call
desertification. Europe has been more densely settled than the
United States for over a thousand years, and in this European view,
much of the territory must be maintained by man in order to protect
the ecology, the natural and social environments, and the beauty of
the countryside.''
   Deavers added: ``Territorial concerns manifest themselves in
some European countries, especially in the less-populated north, as
important to national defense _ the need to have people in remote
areas to assure that a potential enemy does not encroach unobserved
on the borders.''
   In the United States, he said, ``territorial imperative is less
tied to the maintenance of the countryside and more to the economic
viability of rural communities, and the plight of those who must
move to make a living.''
   Deavers said that when people move from rural areas of the
United States those left behind see it as a threat to their way of
life. ``Parents are distressed by the prospect of separation from
their children and granchildren, and elected officials see their
constituencies and electoral bases eroding,'' he said.
   Politicians have deplored the loss of people from U.S. rural
areas, but ``legislation creating rural development programs has
rarely corresponded to the rhetoric,'' he said. ``There are no
programs specifically helping only places experiencing
out-migration.''
   For example, he said, laws creating the Economic Development
Administration in the Commerce Department did not specifically
direct its assistance at such areas.
   ``Nor did the laws creating any of the Farmers Home
Administration rural development programs,'' Deavers added. ``Our
basic agricultural policies have supported the mechanization and
consolidation of farming, facilitating the rapid loss of farm
population and the decline of many farming communities.''
   Between 1950 and 1985, he said, the U.S. farm population
declined by an estimated 17.7 million people.
   ``Nevertheless, until the emergence of serious urban stresses in
the 1960s, especially the riots of that decade, there was
surprisingly little talk about out-migration or rural depopulation
as a major problem,'' Deavers said.
   In Europe, meanwhile, leaders have matched the rhetoric and have
added new programs that are designed to keep the rural population
in place.
   Long, the political scientist, that if anything, western
European leaders and governments ``are even more articulate about
the territorial imperative.''
   For example, he said, the 21-nation Council of Europe recently
conducted a ``campaign for the countryside,'' which included a
focus on ``disadvantaged rural areas threatened by depopulation,
economic decline and a diminishing quality of life.''
   Rural problems sometimes permeate European politics, reflecting
agriculture's ``comparatively great'' political muscle, Long said.
One reason for such strength is a version of syndicalism practiced
in in many European countries which gives quasi-official status to
various organizations of tradesmen, producers and craftsmen.
   In the case of agriculture, Long said, one farmers' organization
in France, for example, is designated as the official
representative for all farmers in that country.
   The practice in the United States is for each farm and commodity
organization to speak for itself, although various coalitions have
been formed from time to time as issues develop.

<HEAD>Bush, 100 Days Later</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   One hundred days later, President Bush is
doing just about what he said he was going to do _ changing things
slowly, operating methodically, nothing drastic, little drama.
   That is the approach he described before the inauguration and
the one he defends now. ``I'm a practical man,'' Bush said the
other day. ``I like what's real. I'm not much for the airy and the
abstract. And I like what works.''
   Whether the Bush method is working or not depends on who is
judging. Early on, the president found it necessary to deny that
his administration was drifting without clear purpose, beset by
malaise _ the dread political affliction diagnosed during Jimmy
Carter's one-term presidency. There remain suggestions that Bush
has described no clear purpose and that his own identity remains
indistinct, ill-defined.
   That doesn't seem to be bothering most Americans. The public
opinion polls show solid approval ratings for the way he is doing
his job. A USA Today poll indicated that 56 percent would rather
have him as president than Ronald Reagan.
   Reagan came to office with a clear mission and agenda _ rein in
government and cut taxes. Those goals overrode everything else
during his first months in office.
   Bush had no such program, and said so before he took office.
   ``You're looking for a dramatic two-point program or
something,'' he told an interviewer asking about his agenda for the
first 100 days. ``We don't need a two-point program.
   ``We need to correct one big problem and we need to build on
some tremendous successes, and we need to capitalize on changes in
the world.'' The problem was the budget deficit. It's still the
problem, despite a White House deal with Congress to produce a
holding-action budget this year.
   ``That's at least the approach I'm going to bring to the job,''
Bush said in January.
   And now:
   ``I do not feel compelled or pressed because of a column here or
a column there to reach out for something dramatic.''
   But Bush and his advisers did feel the need for a
campaign-paced, six-state swing this week to say and show that a
lack of drama does not mean a lack of action.
   ``My starting point has been a respect for American institutions
_ for Congress, for the dedicated civil servants of the executive
branch, for state and local governments, for the concept of public
service,'' the president told annual luncheon of The Associated
Press in Chicago on Monday. ``... The emphasis is on cooperation,
not confrontation, as the surest route to progress.''
   This has meant compromise on some points on which Reagan
wouldn't budge. But that fits the Bush premise that federal
government can and should help solve problems. Reagan maintained
that government usually was the problem, not the cure.
   Bush said before taking office that the voters didn't elect him
to bring drastic change to government. ``That's not what I am
about,'' he said. ``People understood that when they were voting.
They weren't looking for a radical shift.''
   There have been shifts, but most have come gradually, on
selected issues, not as part of any grand design. That leads back
to the question of whether there is a grand design for the Bush
presidency. None shows yet, but Bush has had only three months of
the 48 in this term.
   ``There's a long road ahead of us,'' he said. ``And I am
optimistic _ that our reforms will produce lasting results, that
the long-range planning we do today will pay off in the future,
that our consultations with Congress will result in progress in
domestic and international affairs as well.''
   His success in reaching those goals will determine which
historical parallel comes closest to fitting his first hundred days.
   In U.S. history, the phase recalls the 1933 special session of
Congress in which President Franklin D. Roosevelt won swift
approval of his proposals to deal with the Depression. In France,
it applies to Napoleon's escape from exile and the brief, final
campaign that ended in his defeat at Waterloo.

<HEAD>Benetton's U.S. Retail Trade Practices Being Probed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Trade Commission is investigating
certain business practices of Benetton Group SpA, focusing on the
company's relationships with owners of U.S. Benetton boutiques,
according to the Italian apparel maker.
   The company said the FTC's New York office is conducting a
preliminary probe trying to determine whether Benetton is a
franchisor that should have complied with federal franchise rules.
   Benetton made the disclosure in a recently published prospectus
for a proposed offering of 8 million American Depositary Shares. A
spokesman for the company Wednesday declined to answer questions
about the investigation.
   The document stated, ``Although many of these matters are in a
preliminary stage, the company does not believe that their outcome
will have a material adverse effect on the company.''
   At FTC headquarters in Washington, spokeswoman Susan Ticknor
said she could not confirm or deny whether there is an
investigation in progress into the Benetton matter.
   The clothing company said in the prospectus that a number of
U.S. store owners have alleged in bankruptcy court proceedings that
Benetton has ``engaged in unfair trade practices and violated
certain franchise and other statutes.''
   Federal law requires franchisors to make detailed disclosures
before selling a franchise. Franchisors must obey various federal
laws intended to protect business owners from abusive practices.
Some states also have statutes that apply specifically to
franchisors.
   The company markets its clothing for women, men and children
through independently owned Benetton retail stores. There are about
700 Benetton stores in the United States and the company does not
consider itself to have a franchise relationship with the owners.
   About 70 Independent sales representatives are used to cultivate
the development of stores for Benetton products in 79 countries.
   These representatives find investors and store operators to
finance, own and manage the retail outlets. They handle the
placement of orders to Benetton and monitor the stores in their
territories.
   Store owners buy merchandise from Benetton and set their own
prices. But they do not pay Benetton a fee for use of its trade
names nor do they pay any royalties based on a percentage of sales
or profits, as is frequently the case for franchisees.
   Benetton operations in the United States in 1987 and 1988 were
hurt by a downturn in women's apparel sales and a decline of the
dollar against the lira. U.S. sales were virtually flat last year
while operating margins shrunk.
   The timing of these factors was particularly bad because they
occured after a period of rapid growth in the number of stores in
the United States, some of which were opened in poor locations, the
company said in the prospectus.
   ``As a result of the lower levels of retail sales ... certain
store owners have experienced significant difficulties in meeting
their payment obligations to the company,'' Benetton said.
   In 1965, the Benetton family established a privately-held
clothing concern that has become known for its colorful sportswear.
   The family owns more than 80 percent of the company, which
earned $99.5 million in 1988 on revenue of $1.13 billion. The
family has been planning to increase public ownership of the
company.
   Proceeds from the offering, which will allow Benetton to be
listed on the New York and Toronto stock exchanges, will be used to
retire debt.

<HEAD>Ford Hints Government Help Needed For Practical Electric Car</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ford Motor Co. unveiled an electric-powered
minivan in the capital with a suggestion that the nation's No. 2
automaker would welcome more government involvement to boost the
fledgling technology.
   ``Joint government-industry initiatives are critical if any
alternative fuel strategy is going to become a viable national
option in the foreseeable future,'' said John McTague, Ford's vice
president for research.
   The Aerostar van showed by Ford at a hotel near the
Transportation Department was powered by a sodium-sulfur battery,
with the drive provided by a motor mounted on the rear axle. The
inverter, which converts direct current from the battery to the
alternating current needed to run the motor, was a new, lighter and
smaller design, Ford said.
   Company officials said the van has a 100-mile driving range and
a maximum speed of 65 mph, with acceleration from a standstill to
50 mph in less than 20 seconds. The battery takes eight hours to
recharge, the company said.
   The cost of operating the vehicle, both replacing the battery
every three or four years and recharging it, is comparable with the
cost of running a gasoline-powered vehicle at today's prices, Ford
said.
   Electric-powered vehicles have been put forward as a long-term
solution to the problems of diminishing petroleum supplies and
increasing air pollution.
   The system was developed jointly by the Energy Department, Ford,
General Electric Co. and several battery manufacturers.
   McTague said bringing the vehicle from the prototype stage to
commercial practicality would require government support of battery
research aimed at bringing down recharge times and ``substantial
production to test out'' the vehicles for durability, cost and
acceptance.
   Bill Day, Ford's chief of public relations in Washington, hinted
broadly that the company would need government purchase of the
electric vehicles in order to build momentum for their use.
   ``You've got to read between the lines,'' Days said, citing
other instances of new technology, such as air bags, where
government purchases created the momentum that led to commercial
success.
   Rep. Vic Fazio, D-Calif., planned this week to introduce
legislation that would require conversion to cleaner-burning fuels,
including electricity, of most vehicles operated by the Defense
Department and civilian federal agencies, his office said.
   The conversion would commence in 1993 at a rate of 10 percent of
the federal fleet per year and would be finished in 2002.
   With government support and the right market, electrical
vehicles could reach the commercial stage within 10 years, McTague
said.
   The Energy Department has provided 95 percent of the $20 million
spent on the electric vehicle program since 1982 and believes
battery technology has reached a stage that would allow practical
development of such cars without the need for breakthroughs, said
Paul Brown, the department's director of electric and hybrid
propulsion.
   General Motors Corp. and Chrysler Corp. have also been working
on electric technology for motor vehicles.
   Ford also showed a Taurus outfitted with its prototype
flexible-fuel system, which can burn both unleaded gasoline and a
mixture of 85 percent methanol and 15 percent gasoline.

   America's steel-using manufacturers are split
over whether steel import quotas should be extended by the Bush
administration when they expire in the fall.
   A coalition of manufacturers opposed to the quotas got some
competition Wednesday when a rival group led by Chrysler, Maytag
and others was announced to lobby on behalf of the import curbs.
   The new group claimed to have enlisted 374 members, including
makers of automobiles, home appliances, marine products, beverage
cans, tableware and farm equipment.
   The only thing the two coalitions have in common is that all
their members use steel as a raw material.
   The Coalition for a Competitive America was unveiled at a
Capitol press conference Wednesday by Sen. Jay Rockefeller,
D-W.Va., and executives from Chrysler Corp. of Detroit, Crown Cork
and Seal Co. of Philadelphia, Milton Can Co. of Elizabeth, N.J.,
UNR-Leavitt of Chicago, Maytag Corp. of Newton, Iowa, and others.
   Organizers said the coalition was created to help make the case
for continuing steel import quotas due to expire Sept. 30.
   ``Domestic steel producers have proven they can compete with any
steel producer in the world,'' said Rockefeller, chairman of the
Senate Steel Caucus. ``But they cannot compete with foreign
governments that pump billions of dollars in subsidies into their
state-owned steel operations.''
   The Reagan administration negotiated five-year,
product-by-product ``voluntary restraint agreements'' in 1984 with
Japan, South Korea, Brazil, South Africa, the European Community
and other nations to limit the flow of foreign steel into the
United States.
   Three days before last November's election, President Bush
pledged to continue the restraints in some form. But with the U.S.
steel industry newly profitable, opponents of the curbs believe
they can make a case for ending the program, or at least narrowing
its scope.
   The quota opponents have been led in part by Caterpillar Inc. of
Peoria, Ill. Caterpillar is part of the Coalition of American Steel
Using Manufacturers, a 300-member group that claims quotas have
driven up steel prices and caused product shortages.
   Members of the new coalition said they formed the group to show
that steel-consuming manufacturers are not widely opposed to trade
protection, as the older group suggests.
   Chrysler spokesman Richard Muller, UNR-Leavitt President Roy A.
Herman, Maytag government affairs counsel Douglass Horstman and
Crown Cork and Seal Vice President-Purchasing Ronald Thoma released
statements chronicling how the quotas had helped turn the ailing
steel industry around.
   Bipartisan legislation has been introduced in the Senate and
House that would enable the Bush administration to begin
negotiating new quota agreements with America's steel-trading
partners.
   But Samuel Berger, counsel for the older Coalition of American
Steel Using Manufacturers, said in a telephone interview that the
new group was already on the defensive.
   ``I think they are concerned that the debate here has been
expanded beyond simply what's good for the steel industry. We've
succeeded in getting people to understand that the debate is over
what's good for the overall economy,'' Berger said.

<HEAD>Wood Fad Makes Maple Defect A Hot Seller</HEAD>

   North American colonials viewed
bird's-eye maple as one of nature's defects, but today lumbermen
can't cut the trees fast enough.
   The specks and whirling disfigurations of bird's-eye have become
the fad of the wood world, foresters say.
   ``It's a very hot wood now. It's hard to say why,'' said Steve
Stanton, import veneers specialist for David R. Webb Co. Inc. in
Edinburgh, Ind. ``It will continue to be until some gentleman
decides the trendy wood is something else.''
   Foreign buyers are snapping up so much of the rare North
American wood that U.S. producers have had to turn away domestic
customers. The wood has become even harder to find in the last six
months, with Japan entering the market of would-be buyers.
   ``I think our shortage of bird's-eye is because we've shipped it
out. We can't satisfy the guitar makers, the clock manufacturers in
our own country,'' said Bob Owens of Owens Forest Products in
Duluth, Minn.
   Importers from Germany, Japan and Taiwan make up the bulk of the
foreign trade, Owens and Stanton said Wednesday. In Italy,
importers are dying the blond wood into all colors of the rainbow,
from pink to green.
   The supply of birdy maple _ as foresters call it _ is scarce,
limited to a narrow band through New England and the Great Lakes.
By most estimates, Michigan's Upper Peninsula produces the bulk of
the specialty wood.
   There, bird's-eye is selling for as high as $12.50 per board
foot, said Upper Peninsula forester Gary Willis.
   A conservation group trying to buy a 300-year-old virgin stand
of pines along the Upper Peninsula's northernmost shore gulped when
the timber company-owner named its price.
   The quote was steep, Willis said, not because the pines are ripe
for cutting, but because of the chance that bird's-eye maples are
among the scattered maples in the stand.
   ``They're drooling over the bird's-eye,'' Willis said.
   The price for long sections of bird's-eye veneer runs up to
$2.50 a square foot for a 10-foot panel. For comparison, walnut
veneer runs up to 50 cents a square foot, Stanton said.
   But 25 years ago, Boynton Glidden, president of GMC Hardwoods in
Dover, Mass., tossed his bird's-eye logs aside for pallet lumber.
``No one wanted bird's-eye at any price,'' Glidden said.
   ``Now, the yuppies, the wealthy, they think it's pretty. If
anyone has any, it's pretty easy to sell. And the price is going up
and up,'' he said.
   Some companies still throw bird's-eye out with their less
valuable boards. One of the most common places to find its dotted
planks is among the second-grade maple in gymnasium floors.
   Meanwhile, scientists remain unable to explain why it looks the
way it does.
   ``What causes bird's-eye? Don't ask me,'' said Dr. Henry Huber,
a forestry professor at Michigan State University. ``There are a
lot of theories _ maybe they are buds that didn't mature _ but none
of them has proven out. What can I say? Some trees have it, some
don't.''
   Bird's-eye maple is hard to cut and the delicate little eyes
tend to pop out during planing, wood products manufacturers said.
And not every log that looks like bird's-eye turns out to be
``birdy.''
   ``They're cruddy little nasty logs. You buy 20 logs and maybe
five of them have bird's eyes,'' said Sue Roberts of Dooge Veneers
in Grand Rapids, Mich. Yet Dooge Veneers sells every bird's-eye
maple log it can get.
   ``Nobody else has it,'' she said.

<TEXT>
   Tandy Corp. says it will make a laptop
computer that will be sold worldwide under the Radio Shack and
Panasonic brand names under a deal with Matsushita Electric
Industrial Co. Ltd.
   The laptop deal was announced Wednesday as Tandy dedicated a
factory in Fort Worth where the company will produce full-size
personal computers under a deal with Japan's Matsushita, which uses
the Panasonic brand name.
   Tandy Chairman John V. Roach did not reveal the projected price,
size or design of the new laptop.
   Roach also said the company is negotiating with other laptop
vendors over patents held by Tandy subsidiary Grid.
   Grid ``believes it has fundamental patents for portable
computers that will potentially need to be licensed by other
portable manufacturers,'' according to a statement from the company.
   Roach gave few details, except to say that the patents involved
machines where screens folded down.

<HEAD>Judge Refuses To Grant Boesky Early Release From Prison</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge says convicted stock speculator
Ivan F. Boesky has already gotten a lot of breaks and doesn't
deserve to get out of prison early.
   U.S. District Judge Morris E. Lasker rejected a request by
Boesky, who has already served one year of a three-year prison
term, to cut his sentence to time served, paving the way for his
immediate release.
   ``I cannot in good conscience conclude that, commendable as
Boesky's behavior has been since he was sentenced, he should be
given further credit,'' Lasker ruled Wednesday.
   There was no answer at the offices of Boesky lawyers in New York
and Washington when called for comment Wednesday evening.
   Once one of the leading speculators on the stock of potential
takeover targets, Boesky pleaded guilty to one felony count as part
of a plea bargain. Boesky, 52, also agreed to pay a then-record
$100 million in 1986 to settle civil insider trading charges
brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
   He has since supplied information used toward civil or criminal
charges in more than a dozen cases here and in Britain. In
exchange, he was allowed to plead guilty to one count of conspiracy
to lie to the SEC.
   The maximum penalty he faced was five years in prison, and
Lasker, who has a reputation as a lenient sentencer, handed Boesky
a three-year term.
   Lasker noted that even without any actions by him or the parole
board, ``Boesky will be released from custody less than a year from
today, which is to say, that the actual period he will have served
will be slightly more than two years. Such a sentence is not unjust
in the circumstances.''
   Boesky's earliest non-parole release date based on good behavior
is April 4, 1990.
   Boesky claimed that his help led to a record plea bargain deal
by Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and the subsequent indictment of its
junk bond chief, Michael Milken, and others on racketeering and
securities fraud charges.
   Lasker said he took Boesky's ``unprecedented'' cooperation into
account when he passed sentence.
   Federal prosecutors took no stand on releasing Boesky early but
they noted in a letter to Lasker, who sentenced Boesky Dec. 18,
1987, that the Milken indictment and the $650 million tentative
settlement of criminal charges Drexel reached with the government
was ``the centerpiece of Boesky's cooperation.''
   The letter continued: ``Boesky's disclosures were the essential
catalyst for all that has been and remains to be revealed in those
cases. Other investigations arising directly from Boesky's
disclosures have also matured since Boesky's sentencing.''
   But it added that ``the government nevertheless articulated the
value of that cooperation in unqualified terms when Boesky was
sentenced.''

<HEAD>Bid To Finalize Drexel-SEC Deal Again Delayed By Appeals Court</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission is
planning another try at finalizing its settlement of civil
securities fraud charges against Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
   A federal appeals court ruled Wednesday that it did not have the
authority to switch judges on the case.
   But an SEC lawyer said the ruling left open an option for
seeking lower court approval of its deal with Drexel.
   The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals previously barred Judge
Milton Pollack, who is assigned to the case, from conducting
hearings on the proposed settlement because his impartiality is
being challenged before the U.S. Supreme Court by former Drexel
junk bond chief Michael Milken, who is not part of the settlement.
   Until the high court decides whether to consider Milken's
appeal, Pollack cannot take any action in the Drexel case.
   The SEC and Drexel tried to bypass the delay, which could take
months, by asking the 2nd Circuit to modify its stay and allow
another judge to consider and possibly approve the settlement.
   The appeals court, however, said ``that decision does not rest
with us,'' adding that the final word on assigning the case to
another judge ``rests with Judge Pollack or with those responsible
for the assignment of cases'' at the district court level in New
York.
   In Washington, SEC Solicitor Paul Gonson said the commission
would not ask Pollack to step aside. ``Rather, we're going to be
asking the proper authorities to assign that part of the case to a
second judge for the sole purpose of considering the settlement,''
said Gonson, who oversees appeals for the SEC.
   Gonson would not comment on what action the SEC planned to take,
but a three-judge district court panel, the committee on
assignments, normally would consider requests for reassignments of
cases.
   Chief Judge Charles L. Brieant Jr., who chairs the committee,
said that if the SEC requested an assignment change, the panel
would consult with Pollack before making a decision.
   The appeals court's refusal to assign a different judge
continues to delay the landmark civil settlement as well as
Drexel's record plea bargain to criminal charges.
   Resolution of the SEC pact also is needed before Drexel can
formally plead guilty to six felonies and pay $650 million to
settle criminal charges brought by the Manhattan U.S. attorneys
office.
   A Drexel spokesman, Steven Anreder said: ``We're going to be
consulting with our counsel to see what options we have. We believe
the settlement should be implemented because it's in the best
interest of everybody.''
   Drexel originally battled to get Pollack to excuse himself from
the case for an alleged conflict of interest because his wife
stands to make a hefty profit from a debt-financed acquisition
Drexel helped finance.
   Pollack refused to step down from the case and the 2nd Circuit,
which delayed further district court proceedings pending its
decision, upheld Pollack in November.
   Drexel eventually dropped its objections to Pollack but the
delay was extended when Milken and his brother Lowell, who were
both indicted for racketeering and securities law violations last
month, sought to argue the issue before the Sumpreme Court.
   The 2nd Circuit has delayed all proceedings before Pollack
pending a decision by the Supreme Court, which has not yet decided
whether it will hear the appeal.

<HEAD>Snags Don't Prevent Davis From Bringing His Case To Shareholders</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TONY KENNEDY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Marvin Davis launched his proxy fight to
unseat the board of directors at Northwest Airlines' parent company
despite a conflict with the state commerce commissioner, who is
threatening to block Davis' tender offer in Minnesota.
   Davis had until 2 p.m. today to supply ``objective facts'' to
Commerce Commissioner Michael Hatch describing how he will operate
the nation's fourth-largest airline if his $2.7 billion tender
offer is successful.
   Hatch said Wednesday he will suspend the tender offer in
Minnesota if the deadline is not met, blocking the estimated 1,900
shareholders in the state from selling their 1.3 million shares to
Davis.
   There was no immediate reaction from Davis. Hatch gave Davis the
option of asking for another hearing on the issue, which would be
held tonight.
   Meanwhile, the Los Angeles-based billionaire proceeded with his
proxy fight Wednesday by mailing letters to those who hold the 29.1
million shares of NWA Inc., the airline's parent.
   Davis is lobbying for votes in the election of 11 board members
at NWA's May 15 annual meeting. The Davis nominees would review
``all bona fide offers'' to buy the airline company, including
Davis' offer, he wrote.
   ``By voting for our slate, you can mandate the sale of the
company,'' Davis said in his letter.
   NWA's board has rejected Davis' $90-a-share offer but has
pledged to explore alternatives that would maximize shareholder
value. Davis, who owns about 2.8 percent of NWA's shares, said in
his letter that he is skeptical of the claim.
   He cited the company's refusal to withdraw its ``poison pill''
takeover defense plan and a requirement that Northwest suitors sign
a restrictive confidentiality agreement.
   Kurt Rivard, an analyst for Minneapolis-based Dain Bosworth
Inc., said the odds are against Davis winning the proxy fight.
   ``To oust an existing management is an uphill battle,'' Rivard
said.
   Davis would be helped if nine dissident shareholders succeed in
their attempt to force NWA to change proxy documents that limit the
voting to those who held the stock as of March 17.
   Hennepin County District Judge Delila Pierce said Wednesday that
the request deserves a hearing next week.
   Karl Cambronne, an attorney for the shareholders, said because
more than 65 percent of NWA stock has changed hands since March 17.
Rivard said new owners would be more likely to vote for Davis'
slate of nominees because they bought the stock on takeover rumors.
   Working against Davis in his proxy fight is a provision in NWA's
``poison pill'' that would prevent Davis' proposed board from
selling the company for about six months. Davis sought to
invalidate the provision in a lawsuit he filed in the Court of
Chancery in Wilmington, Del. A judge on Tuesday denied his request.
NWA is incorporated in Delaware.
   Hatch said Davis must explain how he would operate the airline
in light of the large sum he proposes to borrow to buy it.
   ``Davis should objectively state whether (he) intends to demand
wage and salary, including productivity, concessions from NWA
employees,'' Hatch said. Davis has said he does not intend to sell
the airline's strategic assets, reduce payroll or move the
headquarters from suburban Eagan, but his lawyers have indicated he
may refinance or sell NWA's Tokyo real estate, reduce travel agent
commissions or change Northwest's in-flight service.
   NWA shares closed at $100 Wednesday, down 25 cents, on the New
York Stock Exchange.

   Louis B. Neumiller, former chairman
and chief executive officer of Caterpillar Inc., died Wednesday at
his home, authorities said. He was 93.
   Peoria County Coroner Herb Buzbee said Neumiller had been ill
for more than a year.
   The son of a German immigrant, Neumiller was born and raised in
Peoria before taking a job in 1915 at Holt Manufacturing Co.,
Caterpillar's predecessor.
   After starting as a stenographer and clerk, Neumiller worked his
way up to parts manager in 1921. When Holt and C.L. Best Tractor
Co. merged to form Caterpillar in 1925, Neumiller was designated
general parts manager.
   In 1941, Neumiller reached the top at Caterpillar _ the world's
largest manufacturer of earth-moving equipment _ with his election
as president.
   He held that position until 1954, when he was elected chairman
of the board and chief executive officer. During the post-war era,
Neumiller guided Caterpillar through a time of massive global
expansion.
   He retired as chairman and chief executive in 1962, but stayed
on the board of directors until 1968, giving him 53 years with
Caterpillar.
   Neumiller is survived by his wife, Selma, and three daughters.

   Reuters Holdings PLC said its shareholders have
approved plans to simplify the news and communications company's
share structure by converting its closely held ``A'' shares into
its publicly-traded ``B'' shares.
   The changes, approved Wednesday, will create a single class of
Reuters ordinary shares with equal voting rights. The ``A'' shares
account for 23 percent of outstanding equity but represent 54
percent of the voting rights.
   Reuters hopes the changed share structure will increase the
marketability of its stock and facilitate new share issues. In
addition, analysts said the new structure should improve Reuters'
chances of gaining a listing on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
   Reuters trustees will retain the so-called Founders Share, which
can be used to block a hostile takeover of the company.
   Reuters ``B'' shares were trading 29 cents higher at $12.39 late
Wednesday on London's Stock Exchange.

<HEAD>Dollar Lower, Gold Higher</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar was slightly lower this morning in
nervous European trading but failed to fall below a key resistance
level against the West German mark. Gold prices were higher.
   Foreign exchange dealers said the dollar fell initially after
comments by Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita that central
banks were ready to intervene and unconfirmed reports of modest
dollar sales by the West German Deutsche Bundesbank.
   But the dollar remained confined to a fairly narrow trading
range because of its failure to break the key resistance level of
1.8800 marks.
   In London, one British pound cost $1.6935, more expensive for
buyers than Wednesday's late $1.6932.
   Other mid-morning rates for the dollar in Europe, compared with
Tuesday's late rates, included: 1.8727 West German marks, down from
1.8770; 1.6547 Swiss francs, down from 1.6555; 6.3385 French
francs, down from 6.3395; 2.1087 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1150;
1,372.50 Italian lire, down from 1,374.00; 1.1955 Canadian dollars,
up from 1.1900.
   Earlier in Tokyo the dollar rose to 132.05 Japanese yen from
131.47 yen Wednesday. In London, the dollar traded higher at 132.25
yen.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $384.60, higher than
$384.25 late Wednesday. At mid-morning, bullion dealers fixed a
recommended price of $384.75.
   Zurich gold was trading at $384.70, up from a bid price of
$383.50 late Wednesday.
   Earlier in Hong Kong gold closed at $385.71, up from $385.59.
   Silver bullion traded in London at a bid $5.77 a troy ounce this
morning, unchanged from late Wednesday.

<HEAD>Dollar Rises Against Yen, Stocks Hit Another High</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar rose today against the Japanese
yen, while the Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index finished at yet
another high.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, which gained 190.15 points
to a record 33,434.93 close Wednesday, added another 65.90 points,
or 0.20 percent, closing at 33,500.83.
   The index has been climbing since Tuesday, when Prime Minister
Noboru Takeshita announced he would resign soon over a
stock-profiteering and bribery scandal.
   ``Alhough it (Takeshita's resignation announcement) was not good
news, it reassured investors, who thought they finally had got rid
of one negative element,'' said an analyst with Nomura Securities,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   But institutional investors remained on the sidelines, mainly
due to remaining uncertainties over politics and over interest
rates, the analyst said.
   Many market players speculate that the Bank of Japan may raise
interest rates soon to slow economic growth and combat inflation.
   Trying to anticipate ways the central bank might move, investors
are closely watching consumer price index figures due to be
announced Friday.
   Steel shares attracted investors in active trading, with first
section volume estimated at 1.2 billion shares Thursday.
   The dollar closed at 132.05 yen, up 0.58 yen from Wednesday's
131.47-yen close. After opening at 131.90 yen, the currency moved
from 131.70 yen to 132.25 yen.
   Traders said the dollar opened higher in Tokyo following its
strength in New York, where the announcement of robust U.S. gross
national product figure for January-March boosted dollar-buying.
   ``The market's demand for the dollar is still strong,'' said
Minori Takeuchi with Chemical Bank in Tokyo.
   Meanwhile, Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita told a regular
news conference today he does not expect a rapid rise or wide
fluctuation of the dollar on overseas markets next week _ a series
of Japanese national holidays known as ``Golden Week.''

<TEXT>
   House Speaker Jim Wright is promising
``corrective surgery'' on a $4.7 billion emergency spending bill
that failed when members of his own party broke ranks on the first
major budget vote of the year.
   Wright and his leadership team will have their first opportunity
to recoup next week, when they plan to bring to the floor their
plan to implement a separate deficit-reduction pact with President
Bush.
   In the meantime, Wright promised to retool the emergency
spending measure that was labeled a ``budget buster'' and rejected
Wednesday by Republicans and Democrats at both ends of the
ideological spectrum.
   The bill to expand current spending for veterans, anti-drug
programs and other popular initiatives was forced back to committee
after a leadership amendment to address the budget-busting
complaints was defeated 252-172.
   The timing of the defeat was bad for Wright, D-Texas, who is
trying to show he can still command the House while besieged by an
ethics committee probe into his personal finances. Only a day
earlier, Wright had confidently predicted passage of the
legislation.
   However, lawmakers of both parties doubted Wednesday's vote was
a direct reflection on Wright's powers.
   ``I don't think it reflects on leadership problems,'' said
Majority Leader Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash. ``This is not a vote of
confidence issue.''
   Foley had proposed in the amendment to trim other programs _
including $1 billion from the military _ to help offset the cost of
the new bill.
   But White House budget director Richard Darman sent lawmakers a
statement in which he said he would urge Bush to veto the
``fiscally irresponsible'' measure.
   And in a letter to House Minority Leader Bob Michel, R-Ill.,
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said the military cuts would force
the Pentagon to stop paying re-enlistment bonuses, reduce training
hours, eliminate five to 10 construction projects, lay off
scientists and engineers and curtail weapons testing.
   ``This would have very serious consequences for the manning of
our forces,'' he wrote, adding that he, too, would seek a veto.
   The chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, Rep. William H.
Gray III of Pennsylvania, said the vote was largely decided by the
defense issue and individual members' concerns about specific
domestic programs.
   If there was any indication about the Democratic leadership, it
might be that the party vote-counting in the House was made a
little inaccurate from the lack of legislative activity so far this
year, he said.
   ``Because we have not been really focused legislatively, members
haven't been giving accurate readings'' on their position, he said.
The Republicans, meanwhile, were free to exercise rebelliousness
because they ``have no responsibility,'' he said.
   Republicans were actively participating, however, in closed-door
drafting sessions on the fiscal 1990 budget.
   The House Budget Committee, carrying forth the deficit-eduction
pact announced at the White House earlier this month, has been
filling in some of the details on how to guide the spending and tax
bills Congress will consider this year.
   After several days of cutting deals in secret, on issues ranging
from child care to bank insurance fees for foreign investors, the
committee planned a public session today for passing the $1.17
trillion budget.
   The full House could then take up the plan as early as next
week, when the Senate also plans action on its version of the
budget.
   Budget chairman Leon Panetta, D-Calif., supported the Foley
amendment to the spending bill that was sent back to committee. But
he said he was not unhappy that the bill was sent back, so that the
deficit-reduction agreement could move on the legislative calendar
before a measure some saw as a deficit increaser.
   While he was defeated on his amendment, ``the purpose of the
amendment was in part achieved'' because the bill would be revised,
Foley said.
   The bill rejected Wednesday was titled by its supporters ``Dire
Emergency Supplemental Appropriations,'' and it included increases
requested by the president. But the budget committee had declined
to go along with his proposal to offset the increases by cutting
other domestic programs and not defense.
   The bill included $1.2 billion for veterans programs, $892
million for guaranteed student loans, $822 million for anti-drug
efforts and $600 million for last year's forest fire costs.
   The $4.7 billion measure would also provide $423 million for
state foster care programs, $250 million for reparations for
Japanese-Americans who were interned during World War II, $154
million for the homeless, $127 million for unemployment assistance,
$100 million for refugee assistance, and $88 million for public
housing.
   Without offsetting cuts, the bill would add to a deficit this
year that already is expected to exceed the Gramm-Rudman law's $135
billion target by $30 billion.

<HEAD>Corporate Jet Hit By Graffiti _ From Its Own Maintenance Experts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A corporate jet worth over $1 million was sprayed,
signed and decorated with graffiti in an exuberant display of
``fun'' by the same aviation experts who lovingly maintain it.
   Kerry McPherson, director of marketing for the Englewood-based
International Jet Aviation Services, said it was a
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to display the company's
unconventionalism.
   ``It was our chance to be irreverent, I guess,'' he said of the
recent treatment of the jet. ``We treat these planes with such kid
gloves all the time, polishing, cleaning and maintaining them like
gems. We were having fun.''
   The paint job _ a menacing open shark's jaw on the nose,
ganglike logos in day-glo colors on its fuselage and one graffiti
tag that said, ``Elvis on board'' _ however, was temporary.
   The six-passenger jet had reached 20 years of age and 12,000 air
hours, and the Federal Aviation Administration at that point
requires a complete dismantling and overhaul of an aircraft's
engine, electronic and navigational systems. Part of that is a new
paint job, officials said.
   So before the jet was flown to Tucson, Ariz., where the exterior
is to be stripped and repainted in a respectable white-on-blue with
red and gray stripes, the company decided the have a little fun.
   ``We figured it was a once in a lifetime opportunity to graffiti
something that's worth over $1 million and still not get in trouble
for it,'' said Doug Strangfeld, the firm's maintenance director.
   The paint job at Centennial Airport, south of the Denver
metropolitan area, pleased officials so much they flew to Stapleton
International Airport and left it on the runway for a few hours to
attract gawkers and amateur photographers.
   It created a similar reaction in Tucson, officials said.
   ``It was fantastic,'' said Strangfled. ``When we got there, it
basically emptied the whole Tucson facility.''
   The $350,000 overhaul ordered by International Jet official Bill
Milam is a four-week operation that also saved the company $6
million for a new Learjet.

<DATELINE>SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Intel Corp. plans to eliminate 600
jobs nationwide, a cut that amounts to about 3 percent of the
semiconductor maker's workforce of 21,700.
   The company said on Wednesday it made the decision involving
five U.S facilities in order to reduce costs and remain competitive.
   ``We operate in an aggressive, unforgiving marketplace,'' said
Andy Grove, Intel's chief executive. ``While our financial position
is solid and demand for our products is strong, our objective is to
make sure we stay in good shape as we enter the '90s.''
   Apart from Silicon Valley, the job cuts affect Intel plants in
Rio Rancho, N.M., Chandler, Ariz., and Hillsboro, Ore. About 100
positions will be eliminated at the Santa Clara headquarters and a
manufacturing plant in Livermore.
   The Oregon plant will feel the least impact, said the company,
adding it will try to move employees into other job openings and
predicting that only a small number will be laid off.
   Intel also announced that the Chandler plant, which makes
older-technology logic chips and microcontrollers, has excess
production capacity. It will begin a five-day rather than six-day
work week.
   Intel two weeks ago reported first-quarter profits of $97
million _ a 3.5 percent jump over the year-earlier period.
   The company is the sole supplier of microprocessors for all
high-end personal computers that use IBM-compatible software.

   Grain and soybean futures were mixed in early

   Trading was quiet at the opening bell following the National

additional rain in wheat growing states.
   Traders also were awaiting word on whether the United States

   ``Egypt finally ended up buying red wheat and that gave some
reassurance that the export bonus program is still working,'' said
Jerry Gidel, an analyst with LIT America Inc., in Chicago.
   In the soybean pit, there were expectations that a dockworker's

   United Airlines' $15.7 billion order for as many
as 370 Boeing aircraft was prompted in part by public perceptions
that new jets are safer than old ones, Chairman Stephen Wolf said.
   Wolf said Wednesday's order, the largest ever to a single
aircraft manufacturer, primarily reflects United's commitment to
expand its fleet and regain the title of America's largest airline.
   But United also will replace some of its aging planes, he said.
The Chicago-based airline has one of the oldest fleets in the
industry, with an average age of 13.5 years.
   Although Wolf said airplanes will fly ``forever'' if maintained
properly, the decision to replace some United jets was ``motivated
by two things: the cost of maintaining older aircraft and public
perception of older aircraft.''
   ``Some things have happened of late to focus the consumer and
focus Congress on the issue of aging aircraft,'' Wolf said. ``But
in terms of that being a prod, this is a business decision we were
flowing toward anyway.''
   Among the recent incidents focusing attention on aging aircraft
was a Feb. 24 accident in Hawaii involving a United Boeing 747. The
forward cargo door and part of the fuselage tore off shortly after
the plane left Honolulu, killing nine passengers.
   The National Transportation Safety Board finished a second day
of hearings into that accident Tuesday in Seattle, but officials of
United and Boeing said the timing of their announcement was purely
coincidental.
   The package includes firm orders for 180 Boeing jetliners and
options on 190 others.
   United's order came just one week after Ireland's GPA Group
Ltd., an aircraft leasing firm, ordered $17 billion in jets from
Boeing, McDonnell Douglas Corp. and Europe's Airbus Industrie.
   In another coup for Boeing, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines said today
it plans to spend around 2 billion Dutch guilders, or $940 million,
to buy five new Boeing 747-400s and ten new 737s. KLM said the
purchases are part of a program to standardize the type of planes
it flies.
   United is the nation's second-largest carrier, behind American
Airlines. During the first quarter of 1989, American flew 16.89
percent of the total domestic revenue passenger miles to United's
16.73 percent.
   United's order includes firm plans for 120 twin-engine Boeing
737s and 60 narrow-body 757s, plus options on 130 737s and 60 757s.
   United said it has ordered engines from CFM International, a
partnership of General Electric Co. and the French jet-engine maker
SNECMA, for the 737 jetliners. The order is potentially worth $2
billion, CFM officials said.
   The 757s will be powered by Pratt &amp; Whitney engines with a
potential total value of $1.4 billion.
   United spokeswoman Sara Dornacker said the engine costs were
included in United's $15.7 billion estimate for the entire package.
   It had been known for six months that United, a subsidiary of
UAL Corp., was preparing a large order for 737s and 757s. But the
airline wanted to hold off ordering while it tried to get contract
concessions from its pilots and flight attendants unions.
   The airline is still negotiating with those workers but has come
under increasing pressure to buy planes and lock in delivery
positions because its competitors _ including American, Delta Air
Lines and Trans World Airlines _ have placed orders in recent
months.
   ``I guess they've decided to go ahead and show their good
faith'' to the unions, said Louis Marckesano, an analyst who
follows airlines for Janney Montgomery Scott Inc. in Philadelphia.
   He said the size of the order was a surprise but ``it's what's
needed to maintain their growth and their position in the industry
in the next 10 years.''

<HEAD>Banking Panel Debates Stricter Capital Requirements</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Top 12 grafs new with committee action; picks up at pvs 6th

<TEXT>
   The House Banking Committee today began
considering an administration-endorsed effort to make owners of
savings and loans put up more of their own actual money than
President Bush initially sought as the price for a $100 billion
taxpayer bailout of the industry.
   After closing a loophole that has allowed some nearly insolvent
thrifts to challenge in court their takeover by federal regulators,
the committee began debating a measure that would shift some of the
risk of S&amp;L lending from the government's insurance funds.
   ``Without real capital _ hard capital _ the taxpayers have no
protection,'' said Rep. Henry Gonzalez, D-Texas, the committee's
chairman.
   Gonzalez likened ``good will'' exemptions from hard cash, stock
or other equity capital requirements that the government over the
past eight years has granted to S&amp;Ls to ``a soft ice-cream cone in
the July sun.''
   ``Good will provides nothing if the institution goes down,'' he
said. ``This entire exercise is a sham unless we change the way the
savings and loans operate. We cannot in good conscience require the
taxpayers to pay out billions of dollars and at the same time tell
them they must bear all the future risks.''
   Earlier today, the committee approved an amendment specifying
that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. has the authority to take
over sick S&amp;Ls even before they are technically insolvent.
   Two California thrifts are challenging in court their takeovers
earlier this year by the FDIC, which claims it already has that
authority although it is not spelled out specfically in the law.
   ``As long as somebody can go into court, they can get a week's
delay and essentially break the institution by selling off its
assets during that week,'' said Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., who
sponsored the amendment. ``And who ends up paying is us.''
   The Banking Committee voted Wednesday to require the savings and
loan industry to pour $75 million a year of its profits into
low-income housing subsidies as another price for the bailout.
   The measure, approved on a 27-24 vote with four Democrats
joining all 20 committee Republicans in opposition, could provide
up to 500,000 home buyers a 2 percentage point discount on their
home mortgages, according to consumer groups.
   However, the political party lines are a little more obscure in
that fight over tougher capital standards.
   The administration, Gonzalez and the committee's ranking
Republican, Rep. Chalmers Wylie of Ohio, all favor making S&amp;L
owners put up $2.25 of their own ``real money'' or ``tangible''
capital for each $100 of lending.
   S&amp;L supporters, claiming a third of the 2,950 surviving thrifts
in the nation could be wiped out by that stiff a requirement, favor
a $1.50 ``tangible'' capital requirement adopted last week by the
Senate and earlier by the House panel's financial institutions
subcommittee.
   President Bush's original proposal had no tangible capital
requirement, but Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady said Wednesday
that the administration now believes there should now be a minimum
$3 tangible capital requirement for every $100 in loans.
   However, in a letter to Wylie, Brady called his and Gonzalez'
amendment calling for $2.25 ``a marked and welcome improvement.''
   Wylie led the opposition to Gonzalez' amendment to require the
12 regional Federal Home Loan Banks to set aside 5 percent of their
profits _ $1.5 billion last year _ for providing low-interest
mortgage loans to the working poor.
   The regional banks, although created by the federal government,
are owned by the S&amp;L industry and pass their profits on to
individual S&amp;Ls.
   The legislation already requires S&amp;Ls to put up $300,000 a year
through the regional banks as their contribution to the bailout's
costs. But taxpayers still will assume at least 70 percent of the
estimated $250 billion to $300 billion burden over the next 30
years.
   Democrats said the directed industry subsidies would restore the
original purpose of the Home Loan Bank system when it was
established in the 1930s to promote home ownership among working
families. Without it, they said, there's no reason for a separate
S&amp;L industry.
   ``We've invited the taxpayers to the bailout banquet and told
them they can pick up the tab, but they've got no silverware, no
salad, no entrees,'' said Rep. Gerald Kleczka, D-Wis. ``The least
we can give them is some of the leftovers.''
   Republicans, however, complained that making the industry devote
a portion of its profits is nothing more than an ``end-around
play'' for subsidized housing and called it a symbol of fiscal
irresponsibility.
   ``At stake in this bill is the safety and confidence in the
financial fabric of this nation,'' said Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa.
``To play social policy games with this legislation jeopardizes
confidence in the system.''
   The four Democrats siding with the GOP were Reps. Frank Annunzio
of Illinois, Stephen L. Neal of North Carolina, Carroll Hubbard Jr.
of Kentucky and Doug Barnard Jr. of Georgia.
   The committee also got into a First Amendment fight over trying
to stop advertising by some banks claiming that their federal
insurance fund is safer than the one protecting S&amp;L depositors
against losses of up to $100,000 each.
   It eventually voted 32-10 in favor of an amendment by Rep. David
Dreier, R-Calif., directing the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to
outlaw ads that ``disparage the condition of either fund.''

   Paul Kazarian and his Japonica Partners
investment group stepped up their efforts today to acquire CNW
Corp., making a formal offer to acquire the Chicago-based railroad
holding company for $721.6 million.
   The offer exceeds by more than $213 million the value that
Japonica placed on the company in proxy materials mailed to CNW
shareholders.
   CNW's board will meet promptly to consider the bid, CNW
spokesman Fred Bloedorn said. Japonica asked the board to respond
to its offer by 9 a.m. Monday.
   In a letter to CNW's board of directors, Japonica said it would
buy all of CNW's stock for $44 a share _ $39.50 in cash and $4.50
in preferred stock _ if the board would agree to a merger.
   CNW was up $1.37{ to $42.12{ a share in early New York Stock
Exchange trading today.
   Japonica also is waging a proxy fight for control of CNW's
board. The New York investment group has indicated it would pay $31
a share for CNW's stock if it wins that contest.
   CNW owns the Chicago &amp; North Western Transportation Co. It has
16.4 million shares outstanding.
   Kazarian is the general partner of Japonica Partners, CNW's
largest shareholder with an 8.8 percent stake.

   Ford Motor Co. today said its first-quarter
earnings rose nearly 1 percent to $1.64 billion, the second-most
profitable three-month period in automotive history.
   Ford, the nation's second-largest automaker, said its
first-quarter results translated to $3.44 per share, and compared
with earnings of $1.62 billion, or $3.31 per share, in the first
three months of 1988.
   Revenue totaled $25.87 billion, up 11.5 percent from $23.2
billion during the first three months of 1988.
   Ford set a quarterly industry earnings record during the second
quarter last year, posting $1.66 billion in profit.
   General Motors Corp. last week reported its first-quarter
earnings were $1.55 billion, 42.2 percent more than the same period
last year, when the company changed its accounting method. GM's
earnings came on revenue of $29.6 billion and worked out to $2.37 a
share.
   Chrysler Corp. is expected to release first-quarter results next
week.
   Ford said its first-quarter profit was buoyed by increased
profits overseas, a continuing source of money for the automaker.
The company said its U.S. profits fell 5.6 percent to $800 million
during the quarter, principally because of sluggish sales and costs
of incentives.
   On March 29, Ford set off the latest chain reaction of new
incentive programs by offering financing as low as 2.9 percent on
two-year loans and increasing cash rebates and the number of
vehicles covered by the program.
   GM followed a day later, and in less than a week, Chrysler
announced its own package, offering interest-free financing on
two-year notes.
   The costs of the incentives are borne almost entirely by
manufacturers. Although the programs were announced at the end of
the first quarter and the beginning of the second quarter, they
affect a large number of cars the Big Three produced during the
first three-month period of the year.
   Ford also said earnings by its financial services subsidiary,
which provides consumer car loans among other things, fell 41.3
percent to $141 million from $240 million. The company said profits
were squeezed by rising interest on the money it borrowed and lower
interest payments from the money it loaned, apparently through
incentives.
   The financial services made up 8.6 percent of Ford's profit,
while its automobile operations made up 91.4 percent. First-quarter
profits in the automotive sector rose 8.2 percent to $1.5 billion
from $1.38 billion.

<TEXT>
   The European Economic Community will
not make the same errors the United States did when it deregulated
the airlines in 1978, a senior EEC official said Wednesday.
   Sir Leon Brittan, the EEC's commissioner for competition policy,
told an International Civil Airports Association symposium ``the
challenge for the Community will be to learn from the U.S.
experience and avoid the pitfalls encountered there.''
   The EEC, or Common Market, plans to liberalize the European
airline industry as part of its plan to dismantle all internal
barriers to free movement of people, trade, services and capital by
1993.
   The two-day ICAA symposium, which ended Thursday, discussed the
implications for airports.
   Brittan said the EEC Commission, the 12-nation trading bloc's
executive body, would use its antitrust laws to ensure there was no
repetition of the ``spate of takeovers'' which occurred among U.S.
airlines.
   He said the Commission would look at proposed airline mergers on
a case-by-case basis, seeking the ``preservation and promotion of
the position of new entrants as well as smaller regional and
charter carriers.''

   Sara Lee Corp. on Thursday announced record
third-quarter earnings of $95 million, up 23.4 percent from the
same period last year, on record sales of $2.84 billion.
   ``Our third-quarter sales and earning gains reflect the strong
operational trends that Sara Lee enjoyed throughout the first half
of fiscal 1989,'' said John H. Bryan Jr., chairman and chief
executive, in a statement.
   The earnings for the period ended April 1 amounted to 80 cents
per share compared with 66 cents per share on $77 million in
earnings last year.
   The sales figure was an increase of 14.2 percent from last
year's $2.48 billion.
   For the first nine months of fiscal 1989, Sara Lee officials
said, net sales increased 15.1 percent _ to $8.66 billion from last
year's $7.53 billion. Net income climbed to $307.8 million, a 29.3
percent increase over the $238 million reported last year.
   Earnings per share for the nine-month period increased 26.9
percent _ to $2.64 from the $2.08 per share a year earlier.
   Sara Lee is an international food and comsumer packaged good
company with annual sales exceeding $10 billion.

<TEXT>
   Xerox Corp. Thursday reported a 4 percent
increase in net income for the first quarter, reflecting strong
domestic revenues from its business products and the benefits of a
restructuring undertaken in January.
   First-quarter net income was $158 million on revenues of $4.1
billion, compared to net income of $152 million on revenues of $3.8
billion for the same period a year ago.
   Earnings per share rose 8 percent to $1.48, compared to $1.37
for the first-quarter of 1988.
   ``These results indicate that we are off to a good start for the
year and include the early success of the important restructuring
of our business products and systems operations that we have
undertaken to enhance shareholder value,'' David T. Kearns, Xerox
chairman and chief executive, said in a written statement.
   The restructuring, announced in January, included forming a new
office systems business, scaling back resources in the electronic
typewriter business and eliminating about 2,000 jobs throughout the
company in 1989.
   Income for the business products and systems in the first
quarter was $69 million on revenues of $2.8 billion, compared with
income of $64 million on revenues of $2.6 billion for the same
period a year ago.
   Xerox President Paul Allaire said the strong domestic
performance of the business products helped offset slower growth in
the international markets.

   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner is
winning praise for his handling of tough issues for the Bush
administration as head of a department touched by a wide range of
crises.
   The former federal prosecutor and Chicago mass transit
administrator joined the new administration as a Washington
outsider but is rapidly becoming one of the most visible members of
President Bush's Cabinet.
   Skinner, who is in Europe this week on his second diplomatic
mission concerning international air terrorism, has been Bush's
point man on several issues that might have been handled by
officials in other departments.
   Skinner said at his Senate confirmation hearing, ``I'm not going
to take a back seat.''
   He was referring to possible disagreements with the State
Department over foreign air agreements, but he has climbed into the
front seat on other issues as well, including air terrorism, drug
interdiction, the Alaskan oil spill and the Eastern Airlines strike.
   Skinner's European trip followed a meeting he and British
transport officials organized in Montreal to push for a coordinated
defense against air terrorism.
   He earlier traveled to the Caribbean to assess anti-drug
activities of the Coast Guard.
   When the Exxon Valdez ran aground in Alaska's Prince William
Sound on March 24, spilling 11 million gallons of crude oil and
creating an environmental disaster, Skinner flew to Alaska as the
lead Cabinet officer dealing with the clean-up.
   The Transportation Department has responsibility over all air,
sea, and ground transportation, as well as pipelines and the Coast
Guard.
   ``On balance, he's addressed most issues professionally and
frontally, with moxie and political skill,'' said aviation
consultant Dean Sparkman. ``Both businesswise and socially, Sam's a
winner.''
   Subordinates at Transportation describe Skinner as tough but
personable. Reporters who suggest ulterior motives in any of his
high-profile actions, get a curt, ``You don't know me very well.''
But at the end of his first press briefing, he softened his tough
image by pulling out a model airplane that played the tune ``Fly Me
to the Moon.''
   Relatives of some of the 270 people killed in the Dec. 21
bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Scotland say Skinner was the
first administration official to show them compassion and listen to
their complaints about government action or inaction in the case.
   Skinner, who headed Bush's presidential campaign in Illinois,
has received praise for his administrative skill from both
Democrats and Republicans in Congress and from all sides in the
transportation industry, although not all of his positions have
been popular with both management and labor.
   Senate Commerce Committee Chairman Ernest Hollings, D-S.C.,
called Skinner ``a breath of fresh air'' before unanimous
confirmation by the Senate.
   Skinner's toughest critics have been in the Machinists' union,
which had tried to get the administration to step in and prevent
the March 4 Eastern strike. Skinner recommended against it and then
defended Bush's inaction to the unions and Congress.
   ``We are extremely disappointed in his running of the Department
of Transportation and hope in the future he will not automatically
side with management,'' said Machinists' spokesman Jim Conley.
   The Airline Pilots Association, which joined the walkout, and
members of the independent National Mediation Board also expressed
dismay at the administration's refusal to step in. Eastern, which
since has shut down most of its operations and filed for
reorganization under bankruptcy laws, opposed government action.
   In some other matters, Skinner has defied corporate interests.
He joined Environmental Protection Agency chief William Reilly in
recommending tougher mileage standards for automobiles, and he is
insisting that airlines pay for devices he has ordered installed in
airports to scan luggage for plastic explosives.
   But even officials who disagree with some of Skinner's positions
give him high marks as an administrator.
   ``He's clearly emerging as a very good secretary of
transportation,'' said Stephen Hayes, spokesman for the Air
Transport Association which represents major airlines and believes
the government should pay for security.
   Robert J. Aaronson, ATA president, said Skinner inherited an
inadequate system and faces insufficient airports, understaffed air
traffic control operations, and tough security problems. The
airlines want the Federal Aviation Administration split off as a
separate agency.
   Carroll Carter, executive director of the International Mass
Transit Association and a former Transportation Department
official, called Skinner ``a very practical person in political
terms.'' His appeals to transit authorities to seek funding from
sources other than the federal government are well received by
transit officials because they believe he is sincere and
understands the complexity of the industry, Carter said.
   Carol Perkins, spokeswoman for the American Association of
Railroads, said Skinner ``has been warmly received by the railroad
industry.''

<HEAD>Sony to Set Up California Center for HDTV Research</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sony Corp. will research high-definition
television at a Silicon Valley facility as part of a ``long-term
commitment to building an extensive U.S. engineering and
manufacturing base,'' the company said Thursday.
   Sony is hoping its Advanced Video Technology Center in San Jose,
Calif., will help it localize products for the U.S. market while
defusing political tensions over the next generation of television.
   ``Today HDTV is being held hostage as a symbol of the need for
improving American competitiveness. This is in our opinion most
unfortunate,'' Neil Vander Dussen, president of Sony Corp. of
America, said at a news conference.
   Sony is contributing to the country as much as any U.S.-based
company would, by locating factories and laboratories in the United
States and buying parts locally, Vander Dussen said.
   The center has 25 engineers and will eventually expand to 50,
roughly 80 percent of them Americans, Sony said. The center will
focus on HDTV editing and production equipment rather than on the
televisions themselves.
   ``Sony's approach to technology development is global,'' said
Masaki Morita, chairman of Sony America. ``At the same time, we
recognize that many contributions are local.''
   Sony is a world leader in HDTV. It has made HDTV production
equipment in Japan since 1984 and in the United States for about
two years.
   Japanese industry overall has a large lead over U.S. concerns in
developing HDTV, which promises motion picture quality images and
compact disc quality sound and is expected to be a $50 billion
industry by the year 2000.
   Sony is among dozens of companies that have applied for $30
million in HDTV research funds being made available by the Defense
Department's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA.
   Some lawmakers have said they didn't want to see U.S. tax
dollars going to foreign companies to develop a U.S. HDTV industry.
   But Vander Dussen said the United States would benefit if Sony
got DARPA money because the company would transfer technology from
Japan to this country as part of its project.
   Sony has made two offers seeking less than $10 million in DARPA
funding.
   ``This was more of a good will or outreach program on our part
to allow the U.S. government to own and take advantage of the
techniques we had developed over the years,'' William Connolly,
president of Sony's advanced systems group, said in a telephone
interview.
   If Sony got U.S. funds for HDTV research, the studies would take
place at the San Jose facility, Connolly said.
   Prior to consolidation in San Jose, Sony had operated the Sony
Technology Center in Palo Alto, Calif., together with an
engineering and technical support facility in San Jose.
   The center since 1980 has actively supported HDTV development
efforts in Japan and has undertaken some direct HDTV work, Sony
said.
   Connolly said the new center will develop products for the
motion picture and TV industries. He pointed to a recent agreement
with Panavision, a major manufacturer of 35mm movie cameras, to
adapt Sony HDTV cameras for motion picture production as an example
of the kialition of Japanese and American firms that supports the
so-called 1,125 scan-line, 60 frame rate HDTV production standard.
Sony for a number of years has produced studio production and
editing equipment based on the 1,125-60 standard.
   Connolly emphasized that Sony still supports that standard
although a number of U.S. broadcasters seem to be backing away from
it in the face of adamant opposition from European companies that
want a standard based on a 50 frame rate.

   Share prices rose sharply again Thursday on
continued optimism that British interest rates will not go higher
for the time being.
   Sparking the market's latest bout of enthusiasm was Wednesday's
news of a sharp narrowing of the British trade deficit in March,
bettering most market expectations.
   Also giving the overall market a boost were better-than-expected
first-quarter earnings results from Imperial Chemical Industries
PLC, generally considered a bellwether of British industrial
performance.
   Prices got another boost late in the day as Wall Street posted
fresh, strong gains in early trading.
   At the close, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index
was up 22.3 points, or 1.1 percent, at 2,115.7.
   The Financial Times 30-share index was up 14.5 points at 1,745.9

   The stock market staged a broad rally today amid
mounting hopes for evidence of reduced inflationary pressures.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 27.68 to
2,416.79 by 2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by nearly 2 to 1 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 921 up, 471
down and 504 unchanged.
   Analysts expect a fresh sign of slowing economic growth when the
government reports Friday on the index of leading economic
indicators for March.
   The index, which is designed to detect future economic trends,
is expected to show a decline of about 0.6 percent, after falling
0.3 percent in February.
   That would provide some additional encouragement for the Federal
Reserve not to tighten credit in the immediate future.
   Wall Streeters generally agree that the Fed has lately been
following a neutral credit policy, watching to see the effects of a
year-long bout of credit-tightening intended to keep inflation in
check.
   Boeing, which received a big order for planes from United
Airlines on Wednesday, rose 1| to 75| in active trading.

   A boom in international charter traffic may
mean long delays and diversion of flights from the Orlando airport
this summer unless the U.S. Customs Service can increase the number
of inspectors, officials say.
   The bulk of international traffic here is handled by charter
carriers, and the staffing crunch for customs and immigration
inspectors affects only those flights, not scheduled international
service by carriers such as Delta Air Lines, British Airways, KLM
Royal Dutch Airlines and Icelandair.
   Local officials are lobbying Florida's congressional delegation
to get more inspectors assigned to Orlando, the gateway to Walt
Disney World, Sea World and other nearby attractions.
   The number of foreign travelers at Orlando International Airport
jumped 36 percent in 1988 to 742,786, and the rapid growth has
continued so far this year.
   ``We've done everything we can,'' said Dianne Zwicker, the
Custom Service's district director for north and central Florida.
``It's going to be real tight.''
   Customs has nine inspectors to process passengers, baggage and
cargo arriving on international charter flights. Immigration has 26
full- and part-time workers who process charter passengers.
   Airport officials said they expect federal legislation this year
to provide the needed inspectors, although it may not be quick
enough to prevent flights from being diverted.

<DATELINE>WORCESTER, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Conrail has approached the Providence
and Worcester Railroad Co. about a possible merger and the two
companies are discussing both an acquisition and financial support
from Conrail for construction projects.
   P&amp;W and Conrail issued a joint statement Wednesday during P&amp;W's
annual shareholders' meeting saying the companies have begun talks
to ``explore the advantages of reaching an agreement which could
lead to the generation of additional freight traffic for the
benefit of both parties.''
   The talks could lead to P&amp;W's acquisition by Conrail; an
infusion of capital from Conrail to P&amp;W; or joint efforts to build
more freight facilities on P&amp;W lines, the statement said.
   P&amp;W won its independence from the old Penn Central railroad in a
1973 court ruling, and has grown since then from a 44-mile line
linking its namesake cities to a 375-mile system, with 175
employees, that serves Rhode Island, Massachusetts and Connecticut.
   Much of P&amp;W's growth has come by absorbing former Conrail lines
that the larger railroad abandoned as unprofitable. P&amp;W is now the
only freight railroad in Rhode Island.
   Conrail has 32,600 employees and operates on 13,100 miles of
track in the Northeast and Midwest. If it acquires the P&amp;W, it
would be Conrail's first acquisition of another railroad since it
was spun off from government control in 1987.
   P&amp;W posted net profits of $3.9 million, or $1.95 a share, last
year, on $21.4 million in revenue. Conrail's net profits were $306
million, or $4.44 a share, last year on revenues of almost $3.5
billion.
   Andrew Geller, a transportation analyst for Provident National
Bank in Philadelphia, where Conrail is headquartered, said P&amp;W's
revenues were ``almost insignificant'' to the larger railroad. ``My
guess is they want a specific line,'' he said.
   P&amp;W interchanges freight cars with Conrail in Worcester and the
two railroads recently completed New England's first facilities for
handling double-stacked container trains. The work included raising
bridges on Conrail's main line into New England and track
renovations on the P&amp;W's line here.

<DATELINE>BLOOMINGTON, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Control Data Corp., which is shutting
down its supercomputer business, Thursday reported a 55 percent
decline in earnings in the first quarter.
   First-quarter earnings were $3.5 million, or 8 cents a share, on
revenues of $843.5 million, compared with earnings of $7.7 million,
or 18 cents a share, on revenues of $902.2 million for the same
period a year ago.
   Last week, Control Data said it would shut down its
supercomputer business, ETA Systems, and make other cuts that would
result in restructuring charges of $490 million and 3,100 layoffs.
   Of the estimated charges, $350 million was to be from
liquidation of ETA, the supercomputer subsidiary started in 1983 to
compete with Twin Cities rival Cray Research Inc. and other
supercomputer makers.
   The company also announced it would streamline the Cyber
mainframe business.
   ``With restructuring charges of approximately $490 million, we
will obviously report a large loss for the second quarter,'' Robert
M. Price, chairman and chief executive officer, said in a prepared
statement today.
   ``However, the actions we have taken enable Control Data to
focus on its Cyber mainframe customers' needs and to have a
profitable second half in 1989,'' Price said.
   ETA, which employed 800 people, lost $100 million in 1988 and
never made money for the company.
   Control Data provides computer products and services for
business, scientific and engineering applications worldwide.
   The company's last good year financially was 1983, when it
posted profits of $161.7 million. It earned $1.7 million last year
and $19.3 million in 1987 and lost a total of $832 million in 1986
and 1985. It also lost money in the last two quarters of 1988,
including a $12.8 million loss in the fourth quarter.

   The stock market ran up a broad gain today amid
mounting hopes for evidence of reduced inflationary pressures.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 29.88 to
2,418.99 by 3 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by more than 2 to 1 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 975 up, 473
down and 478 unchanged.
   Analysts expect a fresh sign of slowing economic growth when the
government reports Friday on the index of leading economic
indicators for March.
   The index, which is designed to detect future economic trends,
is expected to show a decline of about 0.6 percent, after falling
0.3 percent in February.
   That would provide some additional encouragement for the Federal
Reserve not to tighten credit in the immediate future.
   Wall Streeters generally agree that the Fed has lately been
following a neutral credit policy, watching to see the effects of a
year-long bout of credit-tightening intended to keep inflation in
check.
   Boeing, which received a big order for planes from United
Airlines on Wednesday, rose 1~ to 75~ in active trading.
   United Technologies, whose Pratt &amp; Whitney subsidiary is to
produce engines for some of the aircraft, picked up 2] to 51\.
   Other gainers among the blue chips included International
Business Machines, up | at 115[; General Electric, up } at 48};
Exxon, up \ at 43], and American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, up | at 35.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks added
1.50 to 173.25. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up 1.32 at 344.73.

   Corn futures prices rose Thursday on the Chicago
Board of Trade amid rumors that the Soviet Union was about to
announce a major corn purchase.
   Wheat futures prices dropped on rumors that the Bush
administration has suspended U.S. subsidies of foreign wheat sales.
Soybean prices closed lower.
   ``Corn was high because of rumors the USSR was going to buy 1.5
to 2 million (metric) tons,'' said Victor Lespinasse, a trader with
Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc.
   Soybeans were under pressure throughout the day as word
circulated that the Brazilian courts were set to rule on the
legality of a dock strike that is holding up that country's soybean
exports.
   ``The thinking is the court is going to be against the
dockworkers and the army is going to be used to break up the strike
if it continues,'' Lespinasse said.
   An extended dockworkers strike in Brazil, the world's
second-largest soybean producer, could result in increased world
demand for U.S. soybeans.
   At the close, wheat was 2 cents to 6 cents lower with the
contract for May delivery at $4.05 a bushel; corn was 1 cent to 3
cents higher with May at $2.68} a bushel; oats were 3} to 5} lower
with May at $1.77{ a bushel; soybeans were 11{ cents lower to 1
cent higher with May at $7.29 a bushel.

<TEXT>
   Eastman Kodak Co. and Walt Disney Co.
announced Thursday they had signed a 15-year promotional agreement
that is one of the longest and most comprehensive either company
has ever entered.
   ``There isn't a division of our company or a subdivision, for
that matter, that isn't involved in this agreement,'' said Frank
Wells, president and chief operating officer for Disney.
   Kodak will pay Disney an undisclosed ``multimillion-dollar''
amount for the various promotional opportunities and serve as
official supplier of film, batteries, cameras, still video and
other photographic products.
   Disney has agreed to exclusively use Kodak movie film at its
movie studios and exclusively sell Kodak photographic products when
available. Instant film, which Kodak does not sell, will be
supplied by Polaroid Corp.
   The old agreement, which was due to expire soon, only covered
the sale of film at Disneyland and Disney World and the use of
Disney characters.
   The key to the agreement, which enlarges an alliance the two
firms have had since the early 1980s, is EuroDisneyland, which is
scheduled to open in 1992.
   Kodak estimates that 5 percent of the 14 billion amateur
snapshots taken in the United States each year are snapped on
Disney property. That's roughly 700 million photos.
   ``If 5 percent of the pictures in the United States are taken at
Disney theme parks, we'd be delighted if 5 percent taken in Europe
were taken at Disney theme parks,'' said J. Phillip Samper, vice
chairman and executive officer at Kodak.
   Disney's Japanese park in Tokyo is not included in the
agreement, but the Spruce Goose and the Queen Mary, both
Disney-owned attractions in California, will be included.
   ``Because we've been together now for several years and have
gotten very used to each other, we knew we wanted to set a course
for many more years,'' Wells said after signing the contract
Wednesday.
   ``You get Kodak and Disney people together, thinking up ideas
and everything seems to multiply,'' said Samper.
   ``There is, I would dare say, twice the ways of reaching the
public in terms of the volume of what we do ... then when the
original agreement was done,'' Wells said.
   The companies have been involved with each other for more than
50 years.
   Kodak was an early participant at Disneyland, which opened in
1955, and was a sponsor of Disney's ``Wonderful World of Color''
television show in the late 1950s when only 700,000 color TV sets
existed in the United States.

<HEAD>Reynolds' New Bags Latest Effort To Insulate Firm From Cyclical Declines</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Reynolds Metals Co. Thursday introduced a line
of plastic storage bags, continuing its strategy of focusing on
consumer products to help insulate the big aluminum maker from
cyclical declines in aluminum markets.
   The Richmond, Va.-based company unveiled a 10-item line of
Reynolds Sure-Seal reclosable plastic bags at a New York news
conference.
   The sandwich, food storage and freezer bags were described as
the most durable ones that will be available in the $500 million
market and they have a ``triple track'' closure designed to provide
a tight seal for freshness, leak resistance and ease of opening and
closing.
   Earlier this year, Reynolds expanded its plastic wrap line by
introducing colored versions.
   Reynolds has been expanding its consumer products business for
several years, acquiring in the process Cut-Rite wax paper, Baker's
Choice paper products and Presto products.
   ``We have followed that strategy with great care and
attention,'' said William O. Bourke, Reynolds chairman and chief
executive.
   ``These are high-added value, recession-resistant products,'' he
said in a prepared statement. ``They help insulate our company from
the ups and downs of a cyclical world aluminum market.''
   Reynolds is one of the nation's largest aluminum manufacturers,
a precious metals producer and consumer products company. Its most
widely known consumer product is Reynolds Wrap aluminum foil.

<HEAD>Teen-Agers More Inclined To Radio Than Newspapers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Teen-agers are more likely to listen to the radio
than to read a newspaper on an average day, says a survey presented
to the American Newspaper Publishers Association.
   Ninety-three percent of the young people surveyed, ages 12 to
17, said they listened to the radio during an average weekday.
Forty-one percent said they read a newspaper and 23 percent said
they watched an evening television news broadcast on an average
weekday.
   ``Radio is basically an entertainment media, a background
media,'' said Dotty Shea, senior project director for the Newspaper
Advertising Bureau.
   ``Many of teens that I talked to said, `Hey, I got the radio on
in the background while I'm doing my homework, talking to my
friend. They did not usually just sit there and listen to the radio
by itself. Reading a newspaper is a much more focused activity.''
   The survey, conducted by Simmons Media Research and the
Newspaper Advertising Bureau last year, was presented to the
publishers' group Wednesday, the final day of the ANPA convention.
   It was based on interviews with 1,074 teens in a period late
last year marked by Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev's visit to
the United States, the earthquake in Soviet Armenia and a space
shuttle flight.
   Thirty-eight percent of the teen-agers surveyed said they could
think of a news item during that period that was notable to them.
Twenty-five percent listed newspapers as their prime source for the
time of interest while 47 percent gave television as their source.
   Teens tend to be introduced to newspapers through the comics,
said Leo Bogart, retiring executive vice president of the Newspaper
Advertising Bureau, who presented the survey to the publishers.
   He urged the publishers and editors to spread stories of
interest to teens throughout the paper and not ``assign them to an
editorial ghetto.''
   Christine Urban, a media consultant from Sharon, Mass., warned
publishers to stop ``tinkering at the margins'' of papers by making
editorial changes and, instead, to consider ``rethinking the whole
style, the whole presentation'' in trying to lure teens.

<HEAD>Public Works Projects Halt Decline In Construction</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: For Friday AMs; Embargo set by source</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A spurt of public works projects in March halted
a decline in the value of the nation's construction contracts,
although housing and non-residential building projects continued to
slide, according to figures released Thursday.
   The F.W. Dodge Group of McGraw-Hill Information Services Co.
said the value of new construction edged up 1 percent to a
projected annual rate of $236.1 billion.
   The slight increase, which followed a 7 percent decline in
February, resulted from a 22 percent rise in non-building
construction from the previous month. For March, public works and
utilities construction climbed to an annualized total value of
$49.2 billion, compared with $40.3 billion in February.
   For the entire first quarter, however, the unadjusted total of
all newly started construction stood at $53 billion, a decline of 3
percent from the same period a year ago.
   ``First quarter data show that the 1989 rate of contracting was
nearly 10 percent below its peak reached in mid-1987,'' said George
Christie, F.W. Dodge's chief economist. ``Two-thirds of the cutback
since then can be accounted for by just two building types _
offices and apartments.''
   The unadjusted value of non-residential building construction
fell 4 percent in the first quarter to $18.6 billion, compared with
$19.3 billion in the first quarter last year.
   From February to March, the adjusted annual value of
non-residential building construction fell 5 percent to $78.4
billion. The annualized value of residential construction also
declined in March, falling 1 percent to $108.4 billion.

<HEAD>Ford Earnings Up 0.8 Percent In Second Quarter</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ford Motor Co.'s first quarter profit was
0.8 percent higher than in the same period last year as overseas
earnings offset a drop in domestic profits, the automaker reported
Thursday.
   Ford said its profit of $1.64 billion, or $3.44 a share, came on
revenue of $25.87 billion. That compared with a profit of $1.62
billion, or $3.31 per share, on revenue of $23.19 billion a year
earlier.
   A week ago, General Motors Corp. reported it earned $1.55
billion, or $2.37 per common share, on revenues of $29.6 billion
during the first three months of the year. Chrysler Corp. was
expected to announce its first-quarter results next week.
   At a news conference, Ford Vice President and Treasurer David
McCammon Ford's first-quarter profits were buoyed by a 10 percent
increase in overseas earnings. Earnings in the United States, the
basis for profit-sharing computations, fell 5.6 percent to $800
million and could continue to slump, he said.
   He said Ford was cutting about 2 percent from its second-quarter
production schedule, but much of it would come out of overtime.
   Ford also reported earnings for its car-financing arm, Ford
Motor Credit Co., dropped 49.1 percent to $101.6 million from
$199.7 million. Ford Motor Chairman William Odom said the decline
mainly stemmed from rising costs of borrowing and lower profit
margins, due partly to costs of buyer incentive programs.
   Odom said Ford's cost of borrowing in the first quarter this
year was 9.2 percent compared with 8 percent a year earlier.
   Rising interest rates _ prompted by Fed credit-tightening moves
aimed at slowing the economy to curb inflation _ and
slower-than-anticipated car and truck sales prompted Ford on March
29 to begin offering new buyer incentive programs featuring
cut-rate auto loans. GM and Chrysler followed suit with similar
programs.
   McCammon the company expected an economic slowdown over the rest
of the year, which would keep the Federal Reserve from pushing
interest rates higher. McCammon said he expected interest rates
actually to fall during the second half of the year.
   The costs of the latest incentives should affect the
corporation's second quarter earnings. Ford earnned an industry
record $1.66 billion in second quarter 1988. The incentives expire
May 31 but could be extended.
   Financial services made up 8.6 percent of Ford's profit, while
its automobile operations made up 91.4 percent. First-quarter
profits in the automotive sector rose 8.2 percent to $1.5 billion
from $1.38 billion.
   When asked if Ford's earnings for all of 1989 would be lower
than the $5.3 billion it earned last year, McCammon said, ``At this
point, that would be the guess.''
   During the first 20 days of April, with the incentives in full
force, Ford's car sales increased 27.3 percent over the same time
last year. Meanwhile, GM's sales rose 7.2 percent and Chrysler's
were off 1.2 percent compared with the same time last year.
   McCammon said he couldn't be specific about the costs of the
incentives, but the new package costs the company between $100 and
$150 a vehicle more than the previous package did.
   Accordingly, if Ford's estimate that 55 percent of the non-fleet
cars it sells are covered by the incentive package, the company has
paid an extra $7.6 million to $11.4 million in incentive costs for
the cars sold during the first 20 days of this month.

<HEAD>Eds: Interest rate figures reported by Donoghue's Money Fund Report
are for week ended Tuesday. All other figures are for the week ended Wednesday.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Assets of the nation's 468 money market mutual
funds fell $435.5 million in the latest week, the Investment
Company Institute said Thursday.
   The decline, to $303.0 billion in the seven-day period ended
Wednesday, followed a $790.4 million increase in the funds' assets
the previous week, according to the Washington-based mutual fund
trade group.
   The decline, from the record of $303.43 billion set last week,
broke 15 consecutive record-setting weeks during which the funds'
assets posted gains as interest-bearing investments became
increasingly popular due to rising rates.
   The decline ``came in the wake of plateauing of (money market)
yields both in absolute terms and relative to yields offered to
individual investors by competing short-term instruments,'' said
Dr. Jacob Dreyer, vice president and chief economist at the
institute.
   The Investment Company Institute said that in the latest week,
assets of 232 general purpose funds fell $129.9 million to $99.67
billion, assets of 95 broker-dealer funds dropped $1.23 billion to
$129.02 billion, while assets of 141 institutional funds rose
$921.3 million to $74.32 billion.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds in the
week ended Tuesday was 9.19 percent, unchanged from previous week,
according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade journal based in
Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield rose to 9.15 percent from 9.11 percent,
Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was
34 days, unchanged from the previous week, Donoghue's said.
   Separately, the newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of
100 leading commercial banks, savings and loan assocations and
savings banks in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the
effective annual yield available on money market accounts 6.62
percent as of Wednesday, unchanged from a week earlier.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super
NOW accounts, rose to 5.15 percent from 5.14 percent.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 9.34
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, unchanged from the
previous week. Yields were 9.51 percent on 1-year CDs, unchanged;
9.33 percent on 2{-year CDs, unchanged; and 9.20 percent on 5-year
CDs, unchanged.

   Troubled appliance maker Allegheny
International Inc. on Thursday reported a $4.6 million
second-quarter loss as the company's bankruptcy-related expenses
increased and competition toughened.
   The loss, in the fiscal period ended April 2, widened slightly
from a $4.5 million loss posted in the year-ago period.
   Sales during the period rose 5.3 percent to $268.3 million, from
$254.7 million a year ago.
   The company, which filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 of
the federal Bankruptcy Code in February 1988, has asked a
bankruptcy judge to approve a plan that would allow Donaldson,
Lufkin &amp; Jenrette to acquire a 62 percent stake in the company for
$750 million in cash and securities.
   Costs related to the bankruptcy increased from $1.8 million to
$5.1 million during the second quarter.
   The Pittsburgh-based company produces Oster and Sunbeam small
appliances, along with barbecue grills, lawn and patio furniture,
electric blankets, scales and instruments.
   Barbecue grill and outdoor furniture sales and operating income
improved over the 1988 period, but profit margins declined in small
appliances due to competition from other manufacturers, the company
said.
   For the first two fiscal quarters, Allegheny lost $2.83 million
on sales of $495.3 million, compared with a loss of $2.74 million
on sales of $511 million in the 1988 period.

   The stock market rallied Thursday in buying
ascribed to hopes for favorable news on the inflation outlook.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 29.88 points to
2,418.99, a new high since the crash in October, 1987. Its previous
recovery peak had been 2,409.46 last Friday.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by more than 2 to 1 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
1,021 up, 485 down and 459 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 191.17 million
shares, up from 146.09 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 226.18 million shares.
   Analysts expect a fresh sign of slowing economic growth when the
government reports Friday on the index of leading economic
indicators for March.
   The index, which is designed to detect future economic trends,
is expected to show a decline of about 0.6 percent, after falling
0.3 percent in February.
   That would provide some additional encouragement for the Federal

   Wall Streeters generally agree that the Fed has lately been

   Buying by professional traders engaged in computer-program
strategies involving options and futures on stock indexes helped
fuel the market's advance, brokers said.
   Boeing, which received a big order for planes from United
Airlines on Wednesday, rose 1} to 75} in active trading.

   The dollar finished at varied levels against key
foreign currencies in light U.S. trading Thursday after a similar
performance overseas.
   Gold prices declined in the United States following modest rises
on foreign precious metals markets. Republic National Bank of New
York quoted a troy ounce of gold at $382.30 as of 4 p.m. EDT, down
from Wednesday's late bid of $384.50.
   Foreign exchange dealers around the world sold dollars on news
that West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl had confirmed his
government would repeal the country's 10 percent withholding tax on
interest income.
   The repeal, scheduled for July 1, would make the West German
mark and mark-denominated holdings more attractive.
   The dollar's downward move also was attributed to comments by an
official with West Germany's central bank, the Bundesbank. Lothar
Mueller said he would like to see the dollar decline to 1.80 marks.
   Despite this seemingly negative news for the U.S. currency, the
dollar recovered and ended trading above its lowest levels of the
day. Corporate demand was cited as a reason for the dollar's
renewed strength.
   Bank of Boston dealer Bob Morrissey said trading seemed subdued
after Wednesday's brisk business in response to the government's
gross national product report.
   The Commerce Department said the economy, as measured by GNP,
expanded at a 5.5 percent annual rate in the first three months of
1989, the fastest clip in over a year.
   Morrissey said the markets are awaiting fresh economic signals;
the Commerce Department on Friday is scheduled to issue its report
on the leading indicators for March.
   The dollar began its trading day in Tokyo by rising to 132.05
Japanese yen from 131.47 yen at Wednesday's close. Later, in
London, the dollar edged up further to 132.15 yen. the dollar
closed at 132.12 yen in later New York trading, up from 132.105 on
Wednesday.
   In London, one British pound cost $1.6905, cheaper for buyers
than $1.6932 late Wednesday. Sterling rose to $1.691 in New York
from $1.6900 late Wednesday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Wednesday's levels, included: 1.8760 West German marks, down from
1.8793; 1.65855 Swiss francs, up from 1.6580; 1.19195 Canadian
dollars, up from 1.18955; 6.3475 French francs, down from 6.3595;
and, 1,374.25 Italian lire, down from 1,377.375.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe compared with late Wednesday's
levels included: 1.8756 West German marks, down from 1.8770; 1.6585
Swiss francs, up from 1.6555; 6.3455 French francs, up from 6.3395;
2.1150 Dutch guilders, unchanged; 1,373.50 Italian lire, down from
1,374.00; and, 1.1940 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1900.
   Gold bullion prices gave a mixed performance.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery fell to $383.30 a troy ounce, $2 lower than Wednesday's
settlement.
   Gold rose in Zurich to a late bid price of $384.25 a troy ounce,
up from $383.50 bid late Wednesday. In London, the metal also was
quoted at a late bid of $384.25, unchanged from Wednesday's late
bid.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold closed at $385.71 bid, up from
$385.59.
   Silver bullion prices also pulled back. On the New York Comex,
silver bullion for current delivery settled at $5.645 a troy ounce,
down from $5.763 at Wednesday's close. Silver bullion dipped in
London to a late bid of $5.76 a troy ounce, down from $5.77 bid
late Wednesday.

<HEAD>Eds: CORRECTS amount of Drexel fine to $650 million in 12th graf.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wall Street's three-year scandal binge, capped
by the recent Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. fraud case settlements,
has sapped investor confidence and forced investment firms and
securities regulators to re-examine compliance procedures, experts
said Thursday.
   ``Newspaper stories about Levine and Boesky, Wang and Drexel
Burnham hardly ensure deep confidence in the public in the
financial markets,'' said U.S. District Judge Kevin Duffy said,
referring to four of the decade's most prominent insider trading
cases.
   Duffy, a former Securities and Exchange Commission regional
director in New York, was one of more than 200 state regulators,
government prosecutors and investment executives attending a North
American Securities Administrators Association conference on the
impact of white-collar crime on public policy.
   Duffy and others called for greater self-policing by securities
and commodities firms to help prevent fraud.
   Under its landmark settlement of fraud and insider trading
charges with the SEC earlier this month, Drexel pledged to boost
its internal compliance measures and agreed to tight SEC monitoring
for three years.
   Securities regulators said implementation of the deal was being
closely watched for indications whether it prompts other firms to
toughen internal compliance measures as a deterrent to
market-related crime.
   ``Drexel will be an example for other companies who don't want
to be the next one,'' said Susan Bryant, securities administrator
for Oklahoma, who heads a panel preparing action by that state
against Drexel.
   She said amendments Congress approved last year to the 1934
Securities and Exchange Act also should put pressure on individual
firms. Brokerages now can be held liable for failing to enforce
their own internal control procedures.
   ``I think things like the Drexel settlement are just the
beginning,'' Bryant said. ``I think regulators are going to be
looking at these procedures to see if it works.''
   Rep. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., a member of two House subcommittees
examining securities law reform, said Congress likely would be
pressed this term to boost SEC funding and allow the commission to
fine individuals up to $100,000 per violation and institutions up
to $500,000 for securities law violations.
   ``They don't have the resources to deal with two major cases at
once without the rest of the agency's caseload being altered,'' he
said.
   Wyden wouldn't characterize Drexel's SEC deal and its $650
million plea settlement with the Manhattan U.S. attorney's offices
as inadequate, but said:
   ``Certainly the sum of money is very large by anybody's
pocketbook calculation. But as incredible as it seems, it's about
in the ballpark of what Michael Milken makes in one year.''
   Milken is the former Drexel junk bond financier who was named in
the SEC suit against Drexel and later charged in a separate
98-count racketeering and fraud indictment. The government claims
he made more than $1 billion in four years, including $550 million
in 1987.
   Hardwick Simmons, vice chairman of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.,
a major Wall Street brokerage house, said the industry already
spends $300 million annually on self-regulation and routinely
cooperates with authorities.
   ``That doesn't mean we're going to catch all those who abuse
others and the system,'' he said. ``It does mean we'll do
everything we can to prevent it.''
   Duffy, a judge in the Southern District of New York, where the
major Wall Street securities fraud cases are being tried, said the
case of broker Dennis Levine _ whose revelations led prosecutors to
notorious insider trader Ivan Boesky _ was ``tied up with a bow and
delivered to the SEC'' because of internal compliance by Levine's
firm.

   Strikebound Eastern Airlines, three days after
outlining a plan for cutting away $1.8 billion in assets, Thursday
announced a deal to lease 14 Boeing 727-200 planes to rival Pan
American World Airways.
   The $96.6 million, 5-year lease gives Pan Am an option to extend
the lease or buy the planes at a price to be negotiated, Eastern
spokeswoman Karen Ceremsak said. The agreement must be approved by
the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New York, which has had oversight of
such deals since Eastern filed March 9 for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
reorganization and protection.
   ``We had indicated we would be raising about $1.8 billion
through assets sales,'' Ms. Ceremsak said. ``This is certainly the
first step in this direction for the new, reduced-size airline.''
   Eastern President Phil Bakes described the planned streamlining
of Eastern on Monday, after parent Texas Air Corp. ruled out a sale
of Eastern in its entirety. Bakes said Eastern would rebuild with a
smaller airline and pay its debts by slashing service 29 percent
from pre-strike levels and selling assets.
   Eastern's unions, on strike since March 4, continue to hope the
bankruptcy court and Eastern's creditors will call for a sale of
the airline. U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland has set for
May 3 a hearing on why Eastern shouldn't be sold to the highest
bidder in its entirety, including its Northeast shuttle service
slated to be sold to developer Donald Trump for $365 million.
   Ms. Ceremsak said there was considerable industry interest in
Eastern assets such as planes, airport gates and routes and that
the beleaguered company was receiving good offers.
   ``There's a tremendous demand right now for airplanes by other
carriers that are expanding,'' she said. ``The delivery positions
and orders are backed up in the factories.''
   She said she didn't have any information on other asset sales in
the works, but added, ``there have been many interested parties.
Obviously, there are going to be other transactions.''
   Eastern's plan calls for a fleet of 157 aircraft, down from
around 250 before the strike. If the 14 149-seat 727 planes are
leased to Pan Am at $115,000 a month and another 21 of the 727s are
sold to Trump in the planned shuttle sale, that would leave Eastern
with 60 other ``excess aircraft for sale or long-term lease,'' Ms.
Ceremsak said.
   Pilots union spokesman J.B. Stokes said the airline's unions
oppose any transfer of Eastern assets while hoping the bankruptcy
court will approve a buyout of the whole company.
   ``They can make all the plans they want,'' Stokes said. ``I
think they neglect to tell the people they must get approval from
the bankruptcy court. That's a fairly lengthy process and it's not
going to happen overnight.''
   The shuttle sale also must be approved by the court.

<HEAD>Silver Prices Drop On Supply Concerns</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HERBERT G. McCANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Silver futures prices dropped sharply Thursday on New York's
Commodity Exchange on selling prompted by indications of ample
supplies.
   On other markets, gasoline and crude oil prices fell, cattle
lost ground while hog prices rallied, and wheat and soybean futures
slipped while corn rose.
   Silver settled 11.8 cents to 15.2 cents lower, with May at $5.64
a troy ounce.
   Pressure built in the silver market ahead of Friday, the first
day for traders to post their intention to deliver physical silver
against the May contract.
   ``The drop reflected the large deliveries expected,'' said
Stephen W. Platt, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in
Chicago.
   A large number of delivery notices would suggest that producers
have adequate supplies of silver on hand.
   ``The downward pressure also tended to reflect the high
warehouse stocks,'' Platt said.
   Gold prices fell in sympathy with silver and on signs of selling
by gold dealers, Platt said.
   ``There is a general feeling that if the economy is slowing
down, metal finishing demand won't be there,'' he said.
   Gold settled $2.10 to $3.80 lower with June at $386.10 a troy
ounce.
   Petroleum futures settled mixed on the New York Mercantile
Exchange on position-evening ahead of the expiration Friday of the
gasoline and heating-oil contracts. Traders also were nervous over
the possibility that OPEC members may increase their crude-oil
production later this year.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 6 cents to 27 cents
lower with June at $20.92 a barrel; heating oil was .33 cent to .88
cent higher with May at 51.86 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was
.06 cent to .60 cent lower with June at 72.27 cents a gallon.
   Hogs were up, pork bellies were down and cattle futures were
narrowly mixed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   The recent rise in pork-market volatility reflects conflicting
views of whether cash prices for hogs have reached their normal
seasonal bottom.
   The hog market tends to make a bottom in late April, then trend
higher into the summer as the flow of hogs to slaughter slows.
   ``It has to do with the seasonality of the farrowing of pigs and
the seasonality of when they come to market,'' said Dale Durchholz,
an analyst with Agri-Visor Services Inc. in Bloomington, Ill.
   He said cash hog prices have recently approached $40 per
hundredweight, a signal that futures prices may be working higher,
but ``it's a little bit premature to say it with any real
conviction.''
   Live cattle settled .20 cent lower to .40 cent higher with June
at 70.82 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .08 cent lower to .05
cent higher with May at 75.82 cents a pound; live hogs were .18
cent lower to .40 cent higher with June at 47.07 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were .28 cent to 1 cent lower with May at 32.37
cents a pound.
   Corn futures prices rose on the Chicago Board of Trade amid
rumors of a major corn purchase by the Soviet Union. After the
close, the Agriculture Department announced the Soviets had
purchased 150,000 metric tons of U.S. corn.
   Wheat futures prices dropped and soybean prices closed lower.
   Soybeans were under pressure throughout the day as word
circulated that the Brazilian courts were set to rule on the
legality of a dock strike that is holding up that country's soybean
exports and could lead to increased global demand for U.S. soybeans.
   ``The thinking is that the court is going to be against the
dockworkers and the army is going to be used to break up the strike
if it continues,'' said Victor Lespinasse, a trader with Dean
Witter in Chicago.
   Wheat settled 2\ cents to 6 cents lower with May at $4.05 a
bushel; corn was 1 cent to 3 cents higher with May at $2.68} a
bushel; oats were 3} cents to 6 cents lower with May at $1.77\ a
bushel; soybeans were 11 cents lower to 1 cent higher with May at
$7.29{ a bushel.

   Gasoline futures prices closed flat to lower in
active trading Thursday, reversing the sharp runup of recent days.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the May contract for
unleaded gasoline finished the day at 78.12 cents a gallon,
unchanged from Wednesday. The last time gasoline closed higher was
on Nov. 27, 1985, when it settled at 79 cents.
   Analysts said the weakness in gasoline was expected because
current price levels are exaggerated and could not be sustained
indefinitely. Gasoline futures have surged 65 percent since Jan. 1.
   Crude oil that is traded on the exchange was down across the
board. The June contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
grade of crude oil fell 27 cents to $20.92 a barrel. Other contract
months lost as much as 19 cents.
   Heating oil for May delivery rose 0.88 cent to 51.86 cents a
gallon. Other contract months also gained.
   May contracts for heating oil and gasoline are scheduled to
expire on Friday.
   John H. O'Connell, analyst with Refco Inc., said softer gasoline
prices were not a surprise.
   ``I don't think the market can go straight up,'' O'Connell said.
``In the last few days, people who were short took a beating.''
   O'Connell said the fall in crude prices probably pressured the
gasoline market and reflected expectations of higher world
production.
   ``There is a belief in the market that the Saudis are signaling
a lifting of ceilings, making the market rethink its price
levels,'' O'Connell said.
   Consumer gasoline prices, which are usually more than 20 cents
below wholesale prices, have surged in recent weeks, playing
catchup to the sharp rise in crude prices since last December. Some
analysts predict a further rise in retail gas prices but at a
slower rate than in recent weeks as market conditions stabilize.
   Industry estimates put OPEC production at about 2 million
barrels a day higher than its self-imposed quota of 18.5 million
barrels. Saudi Arabia is the largest OPEC producer and the world's
largest exporter.
   Analysts say excess production from OPEC has offset much of the
supply disruptions stemming from the Alaska spill and last week's
North Sea gas explosion.
   The main factor driving up gasoline prices in recent weeks are
the new federal regulations scheduled to take effect this summer
lowering the amount of lead content in gasoline. The higher octane
formula requires the refining of more crude oil to make the new
gasoline.
   Since demand is perceived to be rising while the capacity of the
nation's refineries are thought to be declining, expectations of
possible tight supplies of gasoline have sent wholesale prices
soaring.
   But some observers believe that the current price rises are not
warranted and that refiners and wholesalers raised their prices
before a shortage or tightness actually occurred. A lot of oil and
oil products are actually in storage, analysts said.
   ``Despite the unpredictable events over the last several months,
we still do not see the fundamental support for recent price
levels, and we still anticipate a correction,'' the petroleum
consulting firm of Purvin &amp; Gertz Inc. said in its weekly analysis.
   The Department of Energy recently made what analysts said was a
substantial downward revision in its demand estimate for January.
The DOE also lowered refinery output but raised inventory estimates
to show a higher level than earlier recorded.
   Demand for February and March also are believed to be lower than
earlier predicted.
   Despite lower refinery capacity, analysts say that detailed
studies indicate that both volume and octane capabilities will be
sufficient to meet demand.

   Exxon Corp. said Wednesday it has created an

take legal action against Exxon employees or directors in
connection with the oil spill off the Alaskan coast.
   Exxon said the committee will consist of three non-employee
directors, including Jess Hay, chairman and chief executive of

   Exxon said the committee has been asked to make a determination

   The March 24 spill involving the supertanker Exxon Valdez fouled
the waters of Prince William Sound, damaged hundreds of miles of
coastline and killed fish and wildlife.
   Exxon said this week that 31 lawsuits have been filed against
the company so far and at least 1,300 claims have been made.

<HEAD>Houghton Mifflin Stock Falls As Bass Cuts Stake</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The price of Houghton Mifflin Co. stock dropped
sharply on Thursday as a group led by Texas investor Robert M. Bass
disclosed it has whittled its stake in the textbook publisher to
1.1 percent.
   The Bass Group said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission that it sold about 575,200 shares on Wednesday and
Thursday at prices ranging from $42.02 to $43.46 a share, leaving
it with 161,300 shares in the company.
   The group said it sold the stock because it appeared to be
``reasonably priced'' and added the group regards the company as
``one of the nation's leading publishers'' and said it is
``exceptionally well-managed.''
   Houghton Mifflin had no comment on the move. ``They've made
their comment,'' said Claudia Regan, a vice president.
   On the New York Stock Exchange, Houghton Mifflin dropped down
$3.25 a share to $39.37{.
   In late January, the Bass Group disclosed it had boosted its
holdings in the Boston-based company to 5.6 percent, sending
Houghton Mifflin's stock sharply higher on speculation that a
takeover effort may be launched. The stock had been trading at
about $38 a share before the disclosure.
   At the time of the January filing, Houghton Mifflin downplayed
the move, saying Bass was a longtime investor in the company. The
company had adopted a poison-pill takeover defense plan in December.
   Houghton Mifflin is a leading educational publisher and also
publishes general interest books and educational and
word-processing software. The company earned $24.1 million, or
$1.70 per share on 1988 revenue of $368.3 million.

<TEXT>
   Pennzoil Co. said Thursday its first-quarter
profit more than doubled in the first quarter due in part to a
sharp gain related to its 1988 legal settlement with Texaco Inc.
   For the three months ended March 31, Pennzoil said its net
earnings rose to $52.5 million, or $1.34 a share, from $11.3
million, or 18 cents a share, in the same period a year ago.
   Revenue rose to $673 million, from $485 million in the same 1988
period.
   The Houston-based energy products company, which received a $3
billion settlement from Texaco in April 1988, also cited
improvements in its sulphur and oil and gas divisions.
   Investment income, drawing from the Texaco settlement, grew from
$6.8 million in the first three months of 1988 to $52.2 million
during the same 1989 period, the company said.
   Pennzoil's sulphur unit, reporting increased prices and volume,
recorded $30.1 million in operating income, compared with $11.9
million in the first quarter of 1988. Sales volume totaled 608
million tons, up from 472 million during the previous year's
quarter.
   Randal B. McDonald, Pennzoil president and chief executive
officer, said lower exploration costs helped boost Pennzoil's oil
and gas income to $23.8 million during the January-March period, up
from $11.6 million in the same 1988 quarter.

   Precision Airlines, its flights
interrupted by the Eastern Airlines strike, plans to resume New
England commuter service as a Northwest Airlines affiliate, a radio
station in Concord, N.H., reported Thursday.
   Precision said it has signed no agreements and will not comment
on any negotiations it is conducting.
   Precision, an independent carrier that flew as Eastern Express,
said Wednesday a U.S. bankruptcy judge in the Eastern Airlines
proceedings approved an agreement between Precision and Eastern to
end their affiliation.
   WJYY of Concord quoted unidentified sources as saying Precision
plans to affiliate with Northwest and at first will fly from
Manchester to Islip, N.Y., Lebanon, N.H., and Boston, and later
will add flights to Burlington, Vt., and Bangor and Portland, Maine.
   Fred Martin, Precision's vice president for marketing, insisted
Thursday that no official of the airline provided such information
to the radio station. He said no affiliation agreement has been
signed.
   Precision began flying as Eastern Express three years ago, but
was forced to suspend service last month because of the Machinists
union strike against Miami-based Eastern.

<HEAD>Unisys Chairman Puts Hopes In New Mainframe Computers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM S. BERGSTROM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Unisys Corp. is poised to overcome a
first-quarter loss sustained during delays in putting a new
computer line on sale, Chairman W. Michael Blumenthal said Thursday.
   Sales of the new 2200 series mainframe computers and expected
gains in defense business _ despite tight military budgets and a
procurement investigation _ should reassure shareholders,
Blumenthal said.
   Unisys recently reported it lost $78.7 million in the first
quarter compared with net income of $149.3 million, or 72 cents a
share, in the first quarter of 1988.
   ``This was essentially an anomaly,'' he told a news conference.
``These products are now reaching the marketplace, and therefore
prospects are considerably brighter.''
   Blumenthal was in Detroit for Unisys' 1989 stockholders meeting.
   Unisys was formed when Burroughs Corp. took over Sperry Corp. in
a $4.8 billion deal in 1986.
   The company said orders for its 1100 series of mainframe
computers had fallen off and customers were still waiting for
shipments of the 2200 series introduced Feb. 21.
   Demand for mainframe computers has been flat, Blumenthal said.
``But that's a problem the entire industry has faced,'' he said.
   Blumenthal said companies may be holding off on major capital
expenditures out of fears of inflation or an impending economic
slowdown.
   The government's procurement investigation and the suspension of
three former Sperry divisions from military contracts also hurt
earnings, Blumenthal said.
   Allegations of overcharges in 1983 in connection with a Sperry
contract to upgrade the Air Force's worldwide computer system led
to a $700,000 cash settlement by Unisys in March and dismissal of
the government's charges.
   Blumenthal said Unisys incurred costs in cooperating with the
investigation, ``and making sure these particular things cannot
happen within the Unisys organization.''
   He said Unisys also hopes for gains, despite tight federal
budgets, through government contracts that can help cut spending
through efficient computer use.
   Unisys can get more business, he said, ``as the government looks
for areas where it can reduce its costs, and our people are a way
to do that.''

<HEAD>Gannett Tells Shareholders USA Today Moving Steadily toward Profitability</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LITKE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gannett Co. Inc.'s flagship USA Today is moving
steadily toward profitability, based on projections of increasing
circulation and higher prices to third-party buyers such as hotels,
company directors told shareholders Thursday.
   The shareholder meeting marked the formal passing of the
corporate baton from Allen Neuharth, founder of USA Today and
retiring chairman and chief executive officer, to successor John J.
Curley.
   Neuharth, who turned 65 last month, said he had been asked
repeatedly during the American Newspaper Publishers Association
convention this week for his feelings about retirement.
   ``I'm ecstatic about it,'' he said.
   Then, taking note of the run-up in Gannett Co. stock in recent
weeks, Neuharth added, ``If I had known that merely by retiring as
chairman, the stock would climb by 15 percent over the last month,
I would have done it earlier.''
   The company is riding a streak of 86 consecutive quarters of
record quarterly profits. Despite that performance, USA Today has
lost about $600 million _ before taxes _ since its September 1982
debut, recording just two quarterly profits during that stretch.
   Thomas Curley, president and chief operating officer of USA
Today, told shareholders he expected USA Today to be profitable in
both the second and fourth quarters of 1989.
   But he still predicted that ``for the full year, we should lose
a little, especially if the economy weakens. ... The goal for 1990
is to open the window of profit.''
   Thomas Curley said the newspaper's profitability would be
bolstered by an increase in the price of USA Today to suppliers who
give the newspapers away, with each increase of one cent worth
about $4 million in revenues.
   He also said circulation had climbed by 8.2 percent in 1988 for
the Friday-weekend edition and 6.1 percent for the remaining four
weekdays.
   John Quinn, who is editor-in-chief of USA Today, said he hoped
the meeting would end the ``dumb comparisons'' being made between
Neuharth and Curley, each of whom he lauded as the ``right man at
the right time.''
   And indeed, Curley proved just as adept at straight talk as
Neuharth while presiding over his first annual meeting and the
company's 22nd since going public.
   When Accuracy in Media's Reed Irvine said that a survey of
business executives revealed that most felt newspapers' coverage of
business and businessmen was biased, Curley replied:
   ``A lot of them (businessmen) are used to adulatory business
coverage by their own press departments and they may get a little
rabbit-eared because they're used to hearing what fine fellows they
are.''

<HEAD>Superbroker Wins Part Of Lawsuit Against PaineWebber</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former ``superbroker'' for
PaineWebber Inc. won a breach of contract and defamation suit
against the securities firm on Thursday, but a jury awarded him
only 18 cents in damages in a verdict that he nevertheless termed a
moral victory.
   Former broker Geoffrey J. Winters had sought $16 million in
damages, but the Bridgeport Superior Court jury also found that he
owed the Wall Street firm money for two promissary notes, plus
attorneys fees resulting from the legal battle, which reduced his
award to just 18 cents if the verdict holds up.
   Winters' attorney said his client achieved a ``moral victory.''
   ``PaineWebber can't treat people like this again,'' said
attorney John H. Chapman. ``...These jurors are now telling them
they have to be ethical.''
   Winters agreed he had secured a moral victory, but declined
further comment.
   Alan R. Spirer, PaineWebber's attorney said he considered
PaineWebber the victor, in light of Winters' reduced damage award.
He also said he would file motions to set aside the verdict and to
reduce the damage award.
   The complicated case had been watched closely on Wall Street,
because it is unusual for brokers to sue their former employers.
   The case began in 1982, when Winters left Lehman Brothers Kuhn
Loeb, now Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., to join PaineWebber. He and
other new employees who produced more than $1 million in annual
commissions were touted as ``superbrokers'' to potential
PaineWebber customers.
   When he joined the firm, Winters was given two, five-year
promissary notes by PaineWebber for $240,000 and $60,000,
respectively. Both were secured by a $300,000 bonus Winters
received from the company.
   On March 23, 1984, PaineWebber fired Winters for alleged willful
misconduct. Winters filed suit in New York state and federal
courts, claiming PaineWebber had hired him only to steal his
multimillion-dollar client base.
   PaineWebber sued him in Bridgeport Superior Court to collect on
the promissary notes. The company also filed a $300,000 lien on
Winters' Greenwich home. Winters attached several counterclaims,
contending he had been defamed and seeking damages.
   The New York lawsuits were put on hold pending the outcome of
the Connecticut case. Spirer said Thursday's verdict also renders
moot the pending lawsuit in New York state court, although Chapman
refused to discuss the matter.
   The Bridgeport jury decided Winters must repay the $300,000 for
the two promissary notes, plus $140,000 in attorney fees, or a
total of $440,000 to PaineWebber.
   The jury awarded Winters $140,000 in damages on his claim that
PaineWebber improperly took possession of Winters' personal files,
preventing him from doing business and causing him damage and
$300,000 on his claim that PaineWebber made false and defamatory
statements about Winters in a Wall Street publication.
   The jury also awarded Winters ``nominal damages'' on three other
counterclaims against the firm, including his breach of contract
complaint.
   Because the relationship between PaineWebber and Winters
occurred in New York, the damages were based on New York state law,
Chapman said. Under New York law, the jury could award only nominal
damages _ or 6 cents per claim _ on the three claims after awarding
Winters $140,000 on the other damage claim, Chapman said.
   Judge Dennis F. Harrigan rejected PaineWebber's request that he
direct the jury to reject all counterclaims.

<TEXT>
   Loral Corp. said Thursday it had completed the
$455 million sale of two divisions to a group led by Loral
executives and an investment bank.
   Sold were the Aircraft Braking Systems division based in Akron,
Ohio, and the Engineered Fabrics division based in Rockmart, Ga.
Loral acquired the units when it bought Goodyear Aerospace Corp.
from Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. in 1987.
   The group was led by Bernard Schwartz, Loral's chairman and
chief executive, and Shearson Lehman Hutton Holdings Inc. It
offered $425 million on March 27 but had to raise its offer after a
second, unidentified bidder emerged.
   The new offer is about $5 million more than the competing one,
Loral said. The bids were evaluated by a group of outside directors
and the firm of Lazard Freres &amp; Co.
   The sale helps Loral narrow down to its core business of
high-tech electronics, particularly defense electronics, while
raising money to pay off the debt from the Goodyear purchase, Loral
said.
   The Aircraft Braking Systems division has about 1,540 employees
and the Engineered Fabrics division has about 610. Their combined
sales are about $300 million. Loral said they were profitable but
required heavy investment.
   The $455 million purchase price is made up of $425 million in
cash and $30 million in notes that are convertible into 15 percent
of the stock in the buyout group, which is called Opus Acquisition
Corp.

<TEXT>
   Campeau Corp., the Canadian real estate and retailing concern
that owns strings of U.S. department stores, is planning a major
realignment in senior management positions, a spokeswoman said
Thursday.
   Spokeswoman Carol Sanger said Campeau President and Chief
Operating Officer James T. Roddyand Senior Vice President Carolyn
Buck Luce have resigned.
   Details of the proposed management reshuffling are to be
presented to Campeau's board of directors at a meeting scheduled
for Friday in Toronto, where Campeau is based. Sanger declined to
disclose details of the plan or to comment on whether further
resignations are expected.
   She characterized the intended management changes as part of an
evolutionary process, not a corporate upheaval.
   The company also is scheduled to release its financial results
on Friday, including sales and earnings for its U.S. merchandising
operations, among which are Federated Department Stores Inc.,
operator of Bloomingdale's, and Allied Stores Corp.
   Campeau owns nine department store companies: Jordan Marsh, The
Bon, Maas Brothers and Stern's from Allied; and Bloomingdale's,
Burdine's, Lazarus, Abraham &amp; Straus and Rich's-Goldsmith's from
Federated. It also owns Ralphs, a Southern California supermarket
chain spun off from Federated.
   Campeau acquired Federated a year ago after a two-month fight
that included a bidding war with rival retailer R.H. Macy &amp; Co.
Inc. The takeover cost Campeau $6.7 billion.
   Allied Stores was brought under Campeau's corporate umbrella in
1986 in a $3.4 billion takeover.

<TEXT>
   Mexico, trying to get $7 billion in help this
year, will receive a $250 million loan from the World Bank, the
bank announced Thursday.
   The loan is to be used for investment in the Mexican textiles,
auto parts and flowers industries.
   It is to be repaid in 17 years, including five years of grace
during which only interest will be due, at a variable rate now 7.65
percent a year.
   Mexico is the second largest debtor in the Third World with a
debt of about $107 billion. It is looking for help to compensate
for the billions it must pay out every year as interest and
principal.
   Last Friday, it was announced that commercial banks were being
asked to postpone until 1990 about $1.175 billion in payments of
principal due this year. A committee representing the banks backed
the request.
   Negotiations between the Mexican government and the commercial
banks on a broader financial package are continuing in New York.
   The staff of the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank's
sister organization, reached an agreement with Mexican authorities
that would provide $3.6 billion. This is subject to approval by the
151 governments in the fund, some of which _ notably Britain and
West Germany _ have expressed doubts about how some of the money
would be applied under the debt-relief proposal of Treasury
Secretary Nicholas F. Brady.
   A decision is expected at the end of May or early in June.
   Also under negotiation are three more loans from the World Bank
totaling $1.5 billion. The bank is the biggest source of aid loans
to Third World countries.

<HEAD>Broad Money Supply Rises</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The two broadest measures of the nation's money
supply rose n the week ended April 17, the Federal Reserve Board
reported Thursday.
   The Fed said the measure known as M2 rose to a seasonally
adjusted $3,087.1 billion from $3,083.6 billion the previous week.
   An even broader measure, M3, rose to a seasonally adjusted
$3,971.1 billion from $3,965.6 billion.
   The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, fell to a
seasonally adjusted $781.6 billion from $782.0 billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply
measures.
   The Fed in February reaffirmed a provisional target for 1989 of
3 percent to 7 percent growth in M2 and 3.5 percent to 7.5 percent
growth in M3. The Fed has not set a target for M1 growth since
early 1987.
   For the latest 13 weeks, M2 averaged $3,075.3 billion, a 1.9
percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous
13 weeks. M3 averaged $3,945.7 billion, up 3.8 percent, while M1
fell 1.0 percent to an average of $785.6 billion.
   In other reports:
   _The Federal Reserve said bank borrowings from the Federal
Reserve System at the discount window, excluding extended credit,
averaged $476 million a day in the week ended Wednesday, down from
$997 million the previous week.
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that the
monetary base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank
reserves held at Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and
in circulation, was $288.4 billion in the two-week period ended
Wednesday, up from $288.0 billion two weeks earlier.

<HEAD>U.S. Shoe Appalled At Sale's Failure</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Officials of United States Shoe Corp. say they
were stunned when Merrill Lynch Capital Partners Inc. pulled out of
its promise to buy the company's footwear division, but an analyst
says this gives other bidders a chance to make offers.
   The market apparently is looking at the failure of the proposed
$422.5 million sale as bad news, said Robert Byrne of the Advest
Inc. securities firm in Cincinnati. U.S. Shoe stock fell $1 a share
to $16.75 in consolidated New York Stock Exchange trading.
   ``My personal opinion is that maybe it's not bad news,'' Byrne
said. ``It means that somebody else might buy them. The stock has
been as high as 27 and it's trading down near its low. It certainly
would be a better buy down around where it is now.''
   U.S. Shoe, a Cincinnati-based shoe, apparel and eyewear company,
said Wednesday that Merrill Lynch does not intend to consummate the
previously announced agreement.
   Merrill Lynch and a group of management officials from the
footwear division announced on Feb. 27 that they had agreed to buy
the footwear group and U.S. Shoe's Cincinnati headquarters building
for $422.5 million in cash. The deal would have given U.S. Shoe the
right to buy as much as 17.5 percent of the purchasing
corporation's stock.
   Merrill Lynch, a New York-based buyout firm, decided that
certain conditions and obligations of the purchase agreement had
not been satisfied, U.S. Shoe said without elaborating.
   Philip G. Barach, U.S. Shoe chairman and chief executive
officer, said his company was surprised and disappointed.
   ``We disagree with their position and we believe that we have a
binding agreement to sell our footwear division. We shall continue
to explore our options with respect to the agreement,'' Barach said.
   He said U.S. Shoe already conducted a thorough auction process
for the division before reaching the deal with Capital Partners.
Therefore, Barach said, ``We do not intend to seek out potential
buyers and would rather operate this proven business.''
   The collapse of the sale agreement means U.S. Shoe will not
increase its annual dividend from 46 cents to $1 per share, as
previously had been announced.
   Jerome Fisher, chairman of the Fisher Camuto Group in Stamford,
Conn., said his company would be willing to pay more than the
proposed $422.5 million sale price, but was refused the financial
information he needed before making a bid. U.S. Shoe officials said
they were afraid that a deal with Fisher Camuto, which is a shoe
importer, would violate antitrust laws.

<HEAD>Union Pacific Announces Buyback</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BETHLEHEM, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Union Pacific Corp. will buy back up to
14.5 million shares of common stock in a $1 billion repurchase plan
and sell its real-estate subsidiary, the company announced Thursday.
   ``These actions are designed to enhance shareholder value,''
chief executive officer Drew Lewis said in a statement.
   But Standard and Poor's Corp. said in a statement from New York
that the announcement had ``negative implications'' for the
company's long-term debt, and it was placing the bond and
commercial paper issues on CreditWatch.
   The Bethlehem-based holding company has about $2 billion in
long-term debt, and its Omaha, Neb.-based railroad subsidiary has
$900 million, S&amp;P said.
   Union Pacific spokesman Harvey S. Turner declined comment on the
S&amp;P statement, issued after the stock markets closed Thursday.
   The company said its board of directors had authorized the
buyback offer to begin Friday and expire at midnight May 25. The
board also has authorized spending up to $528 million to buy back
additional shares in open market or other transactions after the
cash self-tender offer expires, the company said.
   Under the buyback plan, each of Union Pacific's 70,000
shareholders will be invited to name a price between $66 and $73
per share. The company will choose a price and buy up to 14.5
million shares tendered at or below that price.
   The offer is not conditioned on a minimum number of shares being
tendered.
   Analysts said the move appeared to be aimed at increasing
shareholder value, but disagreed on whether it might be a defensive
move against a possible takeover attempt.
   ``Takeover targets in the past have certainly included companies
with a diversified base,'' said Robert L. Decker, an analyst with
Duff &amp; Phelps in Chicago, who added he knew of no potential suitors.
   Union Pacific's subsidiaries include a major Western railroad,
trucking, real estate, natural resources and hazardous waste
disposal.
   ``I don't think it's a major takeover target,'' said Andrew
Geller, transportation analyst for Provident National Bank in
Philadelphia. Union Pacific had been trying to build its stock
price in part because of an incentive plan for top executives, he
said.
   Union Pacific Realty, has been based in Denver, but is scheduled
to move to new headquarters in Dallas by June 1, Turner said. It
has holdings in California, suburban Chicago, Washington, D.C.; Las
Vegas, Nev.; Denver and Houston.

<TEXT>
   State Commerce Commissioner Michael Hatch late
Thursday blocked oil billionaire Marvin Davis' $2.7 billion tender
offer for Northwest Airlines in Minnesota.
   The suspension order blocks the estimated 1,900 shareholders in
the state from selling their 1.3 million shares to Davis.
   Hatch had given Davis the option of asking for another hearing
on the issue, which would have been held Thursday night, but Davis
did not request one by the 5 p.m. deadline, according to Lisa
Rotenberg, a spokesperson for the commissioner.
   In a related development Thursday, key legislators' questions
about the constitutionality of a proposed anti-takeover bill aimed
at placing roadblocks in the way of suitors for Northwest delayed a
vote on the measure by the Senate Judiciary Committee.
   Separately, NWA Inc. Chairman Steven Rothmeier said a
management-led buyout of Northwest is not in the works, but there
are as many as four friendly suitors interested in buying the
airline.
   ``There are a couple of friendly investors out there who could
do something significant for our shareholders,'' Rothmeier said at
his first news conference since the carrier became the target of a
hostile $2.7 billion takeover bid by oil mogul Marvin Davis.
``There are two very strong, friendly indications.''
   Rothmeier would not identify the suitors, but said he considers
a previously identified group led by Los Angeles investor Al
Checchi to be a potential ``white knight.'' Checchi's group, which
includes former NWA Inc. director Gary Wilson, holds a 4.9 percent
stake in the company.
   Wilson is a former Marriott Corp. executive and Rothmeier is a
friend of Willard Marriott, the company's chairman, said Alan
Muncaster, a Northwest spokesman.
   NWA shares jumped $2.37{ a share to $102.37{ in consolidated New
York Stock Exchange trading, remaining above Davis' $90-a-share
buyout proposal.
   Rothmeier said management is not pursuing a leveraged buyout and
has not hired an adviser to explore one, although such a
transaction has not be ruled out. In a leveraged buyout, investors
acquire a company mainly with borrowed funds that are repaid with
money raised by the target company's cash flow or the sale of its
assets.
   Ten to 15 groups have shown interest in buying or investing in
the airline and the NWA board has said it would consider all
serious offers. Non-public information about the airline will be
available beginning next week to groups who have signed a
confidentiality agreement.
   Rothmeier said the board would like to make a final decision as
soon as possible.
   Rothmeier repeated an earlier statement that a successful deal
with friendly suitors was contingent on a closed contract with the
airline's 5,000 pilots. Rothmeier has urged the pilots to expedite
negotiations, but union negotiators have declined.
   ``An open contract is an invitation to hostile money,''
Rothmeier said.
   If a hostile bidder acquires the airline and opens negotiations
with the pilots, the next offer ``will look like a TWA contract or
a Continental Airlines contract,'' Rothmeier said. Pilots at those
two carriers had to accept concessionary contracts after the
airlines were acquired.
   If the pilots reject such an offer and strike, the new
management would be inclined to say, ``Fine. I liquidate,''
Rothmeier said.
   Jim Halvorson, a spokesman for the Air Line Pilots Association,
said the statements by Rothmeier were intended to pressure the
pilots into concessions.
   Davis has launched a proxy fight to unseat the NWA board at its
May 15 annual meeting, but Rothmeier discounted Davis' chances of
winning.
   ``Based on the proposal he has out there today, I don't think
he's got a lot of influence in the shareholder vote,'' Rothmeier
said.
   The $90 a share Davis offer, which includes less than 10 percent
equity, would hurt the carrier by loading it with debt, Rothmeier
said. He also disagreed with Davis' contentions that he could
operate the airline profitably with the minimal changes he has
proposed _ especially in an economic downturn.
   Rothmeier also said the value of NWA's Tokyo real estate has
been exaggerated. Davis has said he would consider refinancing or
selling the real estate, which analysts have said could bring up to
$500 million. But Rothmeier said the Japanese government could slap
a tax of up to 70 percent on the sale and must approve the sale
price.

<HEAD>Pratt &amp; Whitney Gets Engine Orders from Egyptian, French Airlines</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EAST HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pratt &amp; Whitney has received orders
and options worth up to $215 million for new jet engines from
airlines in Egypt and France, the company announced Thursday.
   EgyptAir, that country's national airline, and Euralair, a
French charter carrier, placed orders for 24 Pratt &amp; Whitney
engines to power the airlines' newly-ordered Airbus A300-600R and
A330 aircraft, the company said.
   EgyptAir ordered 16 high-thrust PW4158 engines worth $130
million for seven new A300-600R aircraft. The airline has nine of
the planes on order, with options on three more. The planes will be
delivered in the spring of 1990.
   Paris-based Euralair ordered five PW4164 engines for $53 million
for two Airbus A330 aircraft, with options for three more engines
worth an additional $32 million. Deliveries of the aircraft will
begin in 1994.
   The Egyptian and French orders follow Wednesday's announcement
of a $1.4 billion order from United Airlines for Pratt's PW2000
engines and spare parts for 120 new Boeing 757 twin-engine jets.
   The United order was the second-largest in Pratt &amp; Whitney's
history, and brought the value of its commercial engine contracts
to $6 billion for 1989. The figure is already $1 billion higher
than Pratt &amp; Whitney earned in 1988, one of its best years.
   ``This definitely looks like (Pratt's) best year in terms of
orders,'' said David S. Gardner, an industry analyst with Nomura
Research Institute in New York. ``So far they have exceeded last
year, and this year has barely started.''

   The House Banking Committee voted Thursday to
make savings and loan owners put nearly $13 billion more of their
own money at risk as the price for a $90 billion federal bailout
but gave them 3{ more years than President Bush wants to do it.
   Eleven Republicans joined all but four Democrats in a 36-15 vote
to delay until January 1995 the June 1991 deadline that Bush had
proposed for S&amp;Ls to come up with 3 percent ``hard cash'' capital _
or $3 for every $100 they lend.
   ``Without real capital _ hard capital _ the taxpayers have no
protection'' from further raids on federal deposit insurance funds
by imprudent S&amp;L operators, said the committee's chairman, Rep.
Henry Gonzalez, D-Texas.
   Action on several weakening amendments was postponed until next
week. Nonetheless, administration officials hailed Thursday's vote
_ which doubles the capital requirements of a bill approved by the
Senate last week _ a major victory for Bush's plan.
   ``Requiring S&amp;Ls to put their own capital at risk ahead of the
taxpayers' money is the only way to prevent in the future the
unsound business practices that contributed to the current
crisis,'' said Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady.
   Assistant Treasury Secretary David Mullins told reporters
afterward that the panel's recognition of the need for a 3 percent
layer of protection between S&amp;L loans that could go sour and
federal insurance funds was more important than the timetable for
achieving it.
   ``We're happy to have that number up on the board now,'' he said.
   The committee later weakened the requirement slightly on a 26-24
vote on an amendment by Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., that would
allow S&amp;Ls to continue counting as capital their past direct
investments in subsidiaries engaged in real estate, insurance or
other businesses.
   But under the amendment, double leveraging of those investments
_ in what Mullins described as effectively a pyramid scheme _ to
support massive quantities of new lending would no longer be
allowed.
   Such direct investments by S&amp;Ls using little or none of their
own hard cash capital to support skyrocketing loan growth rates _
particularly in Texas, Florida and California _ have been blamed as
a major contributor to the thrift crisis.
   Through such schemes, the administration and others have argued,
a portion of the industry was able to lend hundreds of billions of
federally insured deposits for risky and often fraudulent real
estate and other ventures.
   Including interest, the taxpayer cost of backing up the federal
insurance guarantees to depositors whose money was lost is expected
to be well over $200 billion over the next 30 years under Bush's
bailout plan.
   Opponents of the plan said many of the nation's thrifts would be
forced out of business or into mergers by rapidly imposing stricter
capital standards. That, they argue, would require another taxpayer
bailout in the near future.
   ``If we force institutions by definition ... to double their
capital in two years, ... then it will not be the private sector
that puts it in; it may well be the government who puts it in,''
said Rep. John Hiler, R-Ind.
   Throgh an amendment by Rep. Bruce Vento, D-Minn., the committee
adopted a new capital requirement that the administration has been
pushing since late last week.
   Effectively, it would require S&amp;L owners to show by 1995 that
they have $3 of ``tangible'' capital in the form of cash or stock
of their own at risk for every $100 they lend. Otherwise, they
would be put under a broad measure of government controls.
   Vento's amendment slightly altered an administration-endorsed
version by Gonzalez and Rep. Chalmers Wylie of Ohio, the
committee's ranking Republican. It would have required $2.25 in
capital for each $100 of loans on an S&amp;L's books, with Bush's June
1991 deadline.
   The new version would give S&amp;L owners an additional 19 months to
reach the $2.25 plateau. It would also extend until January 1995
the required ``tangible'' capital level asked by the administration
and Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan.
   The administration had praised the Senate's action last week to
require S&amp;L owners to put up $1.50 in capital for each $100 in
loans they write. But it also immediately sought more in the form
of an amendment to the House version, vowing to ``take the case to
the taxpayers'' if its new demand was not met.
   Opponents, however, said the new infusions of cash investments
being demanded as a layer of protection between S&amp;L lending
practices and the government's deposit insurance funds would drive
600 to 700 moderately healthy thrifts out of business.
   ``Our choice is simple,'' said Rep. Frank Annunzio, D-Ill. ``Do
we save the S&amp;L industry ... for the American people who want a
home ... or do we sell it out.''
   But Rep. Toby Roth, R-Wis., countered that any institution that
cannot raise its level of capital to $2.25 for every $100 in loans
on their books ``should not be in the business.''
   ``If we don't strengthen the capital requirement, this is going
to be a real wimpout,'' he told his colleagues. ``In fact the
definition of a wimp is going to become someone who serves on the
House Banking Committee.''
   Annunzio was the primary author of an amendment approved two
weeks ago that would require thrift owners within a year to show
they have $1.50 in ``tangible'' capital such as cash or stock
easily convertible to cash for every $100 they lend.
   While that has been characterized as both toughening and
weakening Bush's original proposal, the same figure was adopted by
the Senate but with fewer accounting loopholes that would prevent
federal regulators from recovering all that amount in the event of
an S&amp;L's failure.
   Gonzalez likened ``good will'' exemptions from hard cash, stock
or other equity capital requirements that the government has
granted S&amp;Ls over the last eight years to ``a soft ice-cream cone
in the July sun.''
   ``Good will provides nothing if the institution goes down,'' he
said. ``This entire exercise is a sham unless we change the way the
savings and loans operate. We cannot in good conscience require the
taxpayers to pay out billions of dollars and at the same time tell
them they must bear all the future risks.''
   Wylie said Brady had told him Thursday that Bush ``will take
their case to the taxpayers prior to a vote on the House floor'' if
the amendment was not adopted.
   According to the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, some 2,586 of the
remaining thrifts nationwide have some form of cash or tangible net
worth that could be tapped before government insurance funds were
needed if there was a run on deposits.
   But 323 of them with outstanding loans of more than $400 billion
have below the 1.5 percent, or $1.50, standard and another 478 are
now below the 2.25 percent, or $2.25, tangible capital level,
according to the U.S. League of Savings Institutions, the
industry's biggest trade organization.
   Jim Grohl, a league vice president, said the $1.50 capital
requirement would force the 323 solvent thrifts now below that
standard to come up with a total of $9.2 billion in new capital.
   The $2.25 standard, he said, would require the 801 institutions
with less than that now to raise a total of $12.8 billion over the
next two years.
   ``The solvent institutions earned only $3.4 billion last year,''
he said. ``Since 1980 and during some pretty good times, the
industry has been able to raise only $20 billion in new capital. A
lot of them just aren't going to make it.''

<HEAD>Delta Earnings Soar, UAL's Fall in First Quarter</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: RECASTS lead, ADDS 3 grafs to UPDATE with USAir earnings and
to CLARIFY that UAL was profitable on a continuing-operations basis.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>

   First-quarter profits surged at Delta Air Lines
and USAir's parent company, while the parent of United Airlines
said Thursday its first-quarter profit on continuing operations
also increased.
   Delta said its strong first quarter was only partially a result
of the strike that virtually grounded rival Eastern Airlines.
   Delta said good economic conditions, continuing benefits from a
merger with Western Air Lines and growth in domestic and
international operations also contributed to the increase.
   Delta said earnings for the first quarter jumped to $85 million,
or $1.73 a share, from $56.1 million, or $1.15 a share, in the same
period of 1988.
   First-quarter revenue rose 19 percent to $2.04 billion.
   ``The key to the increased earnings was the 20 percent growth in
passenger revenues,'' said Thomas J. Roeck, senior vice president
for finance and chief financial officer of Delta.
   ``The strike against a major competitor during the month of
March resulted in increased revenue passenger miles,'' he said,
``but traffic growth was strong in January and February prior to
the strike, and in many markets not affected by the strike.''
   He said passenger traffic increased 13 percent in Atlanta, one
of the areas most affected by the Eastern strike.
   ``Yet traffic for the first three months of the year was up 8
percent in Dallas-Fort Worth, 37 percent in Honolulu, 15 percent in
Los Angeles and 10 percent in Salt Lake City _ all markets where
Eastern is not a competitor,'' Roeck said.
   For the nine months ended March 31, Delta earned $270.1 million,
or $5.49 a share, an increase of 33 percent over the same period in
the previous year.
   Nine-month revenue rose to $5.78 billion from $5.04 billion a
year earlier.
   At Chicago-based UAL Corp., parent of United Airlines, profit
for the first quarter was down sharply due to a one-time after-tax
gain of $548 million in last year's first quarter from the sale of
its Westin hotel unit.
   Profit for the first quarter totaled $65.4 million, or $3.03 per
share, down from $576.9 million, or $12.02 per share, in 1988's
first quarter.
   But comparing continuing operations, mainly the airline, UAL's
profit rose sharply in the first quarter to $65.4 million compared
with the year-ago profit of $27.9 million.
   The per-share earnings are not comparable because the average
number of common shares outstanding used in calculating the 1989
figure was 21.6 million, compared with 47.9 million for the first
quarter of 1988. The difference is due to UAL's purchase of 35.5
million shares of its common stock in March 1988.
   Revenue for the first quarter totaled $2.3 billion, up from
$2.06 billion in the 1988 quarter.
   UAL said passenger miles on United planes were up only slightly
but the company's yield per passenger increased 18 percent, largely
because of higher air fares.
   USAir Group Inc. reported earnings of $15.5 million, or 35 cents
a share, in the first quarter, compared with a loss of $18.8
million a year earlier.
   USAir had revenues of $1.48 billion, up 18 percent from $1.25
billion a year earlier. Traffic on USAir was up 34 percent in the
period and 8 percent on Piedmont, which is also owned by the
Arlington, Va.-based airline holding company.
