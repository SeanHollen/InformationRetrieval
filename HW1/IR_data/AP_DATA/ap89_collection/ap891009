   Some might think a television show about
home renovation would be as exciting as watching paint dry. But
PBS' ``This Old House'' has long since proved that Americans love
to watch other people fix up fixer-uppers.
   Now ``This Old House'' has this new host: Steve Thomas, an
eclectic blend of Thor Heyerdahl, Ralph Waldo Emerson and Robert
Redford.
   PBS officials hope that Thomas, 36, an expert sailor, carpenter,
world traveler and writer, will dispel the whiff of scandal that
hovered over the show when its original host, Bob Vila, left over a
conflict of interest.
   The popular Vila began as co-host of the show with master
carpenter Norm Abram 11 years ago. He left after last season when
an underwriter withdrew funding in a dispute over Vila's commercial
endorsements.
   The show is produced at WGBH-TV in Boston and is broadcast more
than 500 times a week by 315 PBS stations across the country,
reaching 15 million viewers and standing as public television's
highest-rated half-hour show.
   The new season of ``This Old House'' premiered in some parts of
the country last weekend, and will be seen in other places later
this week.
   Vila's departure prompted a flurry of more than 400 videotapes
and resumes from people vying for the job. About half the
applicants were television professionals. Others had little more
than rudimentary carpentry credentials and a pickup truck. A
concert pianist and a brain surgeon were among those interested.
   But the man who won the job never applied. Thomas, who had
almost no on-camera television experience, was in northwest Alaska
researching his new book on the Arctic during the search for Vila's
successor.
   He had returned to the 1836 Colonial revival house he shares
with his wife and 3-year-old son on Boston's North Shore and was in
the middle of his own renovation project _ constructing skylights _
when he got a call from WGBH publicist Daphne Noyes.
   Noyes was calling about Thomas' film ``The Last Navigator,''
which aired on PBS stations in July. But during the phone call, she
mentioned that Vila's job was open and suggested Thomas apply for
the job.
   Ten days and one screen test later, Thomas _ who combines
Heyerdahl's sailing zeal with Emerson's philosophical self-reliance
and Redford's telegenic good looks _ had the job.
   Thomas, the grandson of a missionary who worked with Eskimos in
isolated Point Hope, Alaska, appears to have inherited the hardy
stock of his forebears.
   Since graduating from Evergreen State College in Olympia, Wash.,
Thomas has built boats, worked construction, skippered ships across
the Atlantic and Pacific, studied ancient celestial navigation with
a master navigator, written a book and helped produce a PBS film.
   His latest project is a book about the Arctic region where his
father was born called ``The Wilderness of Ice and Mind.''
   But Thomas is fairly modest about his accomplishments.
   ``Basically, I'm a bum,'' he said in a recent interview in
Concord, where he and Abram will be dismantling an 1835 barn for
most of this year's show, turning it into a single-family home.
``I've done a bunch of different stuff. There are those who would
say I've never had a regular job.''
   Thomas has supported himself since college by avoiding the
office and desk grind. He grew up in Southern California, where he
learned to sail and surf early. He also learned home renovation
firsthand from his father, who fixed up houses and sold them.
   After college, he sailed and raced extensively around the world.
During a 1979 voyage between the Galapagos and the Marquesas
Islands in the remote Pacific without electronic navigation
instruments, Thomas lost the nautical equivalent of an odometer and
had to rely on his eyes to measure the speed of the boat.
   ``I found I could do it accurately,'' he recalled. ``I decided I
wanted to become completely self-reliant.''
   His desire to learn ancient navigation led him to a master
navigator in Micronesia who spoke only Satawalese. Thomas learned
the language enough to understand the navigator during a yearlong
apprenticeship.
   He later wrote ``The Last Navigator'' about the experience. It
became a segment for PBS' ``Adventure'' series.
   Thomas said he spent a weekend considering the ``This Old
House'' job _ and whether or not ``they'd even want me for it.''
   Once he was hired, Thomas said he stuck close to the show's
creator and producer, Russell Morash, and operated on ``fear and
adrenaline.'' He has done eight shows so far and said he has grown
more comfortable in front of the camera.
   Thomas said Morash talked about a ``10-year commitment and that
sounded fine to me.'' He calls the job, with its July to March
shooting schedule, ideal for a writer and craftsman.
   ``I have a tremendous respect and admiration for true
craftsmanship, the way a person unites his craft with the rest of
his life. It's pretty amazing you can communicate something you
feel deeply about _ and that's part of this job.''

   Nancy Fife never doubted her husband had
been scarred in mind and body by his Viet Cong captors, that he was
a tarnished and troubled war hero.
   The night nearly 20 years ago, when her sneakers seemed to drive
Robert Fife berserk, was all the proof she needed. Fife told her
later that his captors used to wear sneakers when they came to his
bamboo cage to beat him and urinate on him, and that the enemy
soldier he strangled when he escaped also was wearing canvas shoes.
   Then there was the manuscript her husband left when he died this
summer at the age of 46 of self-inflicted carbon monoxide poisoning
_ 449 pages of vivid Vietnam experiences.
   But Fife had never been to Vietnam, let alone been a hero.
   Misled by Fife, his therapist, Dr. Corydon Hammond, had
concluded that he suffered from post-traumatic stress syndrome and
was ``very much a casualty of the Vietnam War.'' A letter Hammond
wrote after Fife's death included a general account of what he
believed was his patient's Navy war experience _ 15 days of torment
as a prisoner of war after the USS Ranger-based F-4 fighter on
which Fife was navigator was shot down in early 1966.
   ``He was clearly depressed, guilt-ridden, angry, alienated from
people and viewed the world in a very negative manner as a result
of his military service experiences, particularly as a prisoner of
war,'' Hammond wrote.
   But Fife's heroic identity was adopted to cover a lifetime of
failure.
   His image, maintained through 23 years of marriage, was
shattered only when his widow tried to have his name included on
the state's Vietnam War memorial, using the letter from Hammond as
part of her evidence.
   The Utah Vietnam Era Veterans Memorial Committee decided last
month after some debate to place Fife's name on the granite and
marble structure, to be dedicated Saturday.
   Fife's would have been the last of 390 names on the memorial.
But while an artisan was preparing to engrave Fife's name, an
Associated Press reporter who had searched unsuccessfully for
veterans who served with the dead hero told Mrs. Fife that her
husband had lied.
   ``I feel like I've been raped,'' Mrs. Fife said after being told
of the deception revealed by Navy records. After a great deal of
anguish, she decided to tell the truth to her 21-year-old son and
her 19-year-old daughter.
   ``Intellectually I know I have the right to be angry,'' she
said, ``but even with all of this I first need to understand it
all.''
   Fife didn't usually talk much about Vietnam, but his wife had
accompanied him to his first session with Hammond in 1986, when he
used the old fiction to try to justify his life.
   Fife had acquired a certificate, purportedly from the USS Ranger
Committee, listing the medals he said he had burned at the time to
protest bad treatment of Vietnam veterans. They included the Navy
Cross, the service's highest award for valor.
   Lt. J.G. Robert J. Fife, after 130 missions over enemy
territory, was ``one of only four naval aviators to escape from
enemy prison camps,'' according to the certificate, which appeared
to be signed by Admiral Thomas H. Moorer, retired chief of naval
operations.
   At the reporter's request, Jeannie Kirk, head of the Navy's
Awards and Special Projects Branch, tracked down Fife's real Navy
records.
   They showed he enlisted in September 1965 and was discharged
eight months later as medically unfit because of bones broken in
his right foot during childhood that hadn't mended properly.
   His only medal was the Defense Service Award _ given to everyone.
   Fife wanted to be remembered as the hero in his manuscript, not
as a man obsessed by the circumstances of his birth. Fife never
knew his father and blamed his mother for making him ``a bastard,''
said a sister, Lynda Turcsanski.
   His wife, who met him in the months following his brief naval
service, knew him as a pornography addict who spent hours alone
with his erotic trove.
   Friends and relatives knew Fife as unreliable, angry, a dreamer,
a failed businessman who gambled away $172,000 of a partner's
money, a sometime truck driver, a would-be writer.
   Hammond, co-director of the sex and marital therapy clinic at
the University of Utah, said he was not entirely surprised to learn
Fife was no hero.
   Assuming the identity of a Vietnam veteran was assuming a
disability that would excuse his deficiencies and gain him sympathy
and understanding, Hammond said.
   ``He was what we call personality disorder, meaning very
nonconforming, rebellious, somewhat anti-social,'' Hammond said.
``I suspect the manuscript may have been a sort of last-ditch
effort at salvaging a little bit of self-esteem.''

   A first-term state representative and
physician is in the center of Florida's abortion storm this week
because he's the only legislator who performs abortions, making him
a lightning rod for protests.
   Ben Graber even gets hate mail.
   ``They need something to marshal their forces around,'' he said
of abortion opponents. The obstetrician-gynecologist's Pompano
Beach women's clinic drew a raucous demonstration Saturday, three
days before the state Legislature was to begin a special session on
abortion called by Gov. Bob Martinez.
   ``They were frustrated by the (Florida) Supreme Court decision.
They decided to make me the target, an ideal situation with the
legislative session coming up,'' Graber said Monday.
   The state Supreme Court last week cited the state privacy law to
strike down a 1988 statute requiring minors to get parental consent
for abortion, uphold a woman's unrestricted right to abortion in
the first trimester, and emphasize individual privacy rights in
abortion decision-making.
   The governor acted within weeks of the U.S. Supreme Court's July
3 ruling upholding Missouri state restrictions on abortions, making
Florida the first state since then to call a session devoted to
abortion.
   At Saturday's demonstration, Graber said several of his
patients, none there for abortions, were jostled by a 200-strong
crowd and others were scared away. Graber says he performs two or
three abortions a week and only as part of his practice.
   The Rev. Pat Mahoney, a South Florida coordinator for Operation
Rescue, an anti-abortion group that demonstrates at clinics, was
arrested and charged with assault on a police officer, obstructing
justice without violence and trepassing.
   Graber called Operation Rescue ``a terrorist organization'' and
said he will seek a restraining order against the group and damages.
   His office has been picketed before. But the latest protest was
perhaps the most strident, he said.
   Graber, among many legislators who opposes holding the special
session, said his mail has gone in recent weeks from evenly split
to mostly anti-abortion.
   ``There have been more gory pictures (of fetuses) and more hate
mail,'' said Graber, a German-born Jew offended by packets with
pictures of Hitler and fetuses that contend aborting fetuses is
comparable to the Holocaust.
   ``Someone wrote: `It's too bad Hitler didn't finish off your
family,''' he said.
   Thousands of activists on both sides of the abortion issue are
flocking here this week but Graber is confident legislators will be
protected by Capitol and local police, who have set up command
posts and video monitors and trained a 40-member riot squad.
   Being in the middle of demonstrations isn't the role Graber
wants to play.
   ``I'd like to be there to cut through the propaganda, be
available to ask questions and answer questions, and make sure the
facts come out in an intelligent manner,'' Graber said.
   Last month, he circulated ``A Legislator's Guide to Abortion
Issues.'' Graber said his 27-page handbook has been positively
received, although anti-abortion forces say he shouldn't
necessarily be considered an expert.
   Said state Rep. Tom Banjanin: ``I think every member of the
Legislature is very knowledgeable on this issue. I think abortions
are the murder of unborn children.''
   ``I question whether he can approach this issue objectively,
considering that he has a profit motive involved in what can come
out of this session,'' added Jon Johnson, political director for
Florida Right To Life.
   Graber, 41, in practice for 12 years, said he initially opposed
abortions, which were illegal when he entered medical school at
Texas Tech University.
   He said abortions are only a small part of his practice and that
many are performed on older women whose health could be jeopardized
by pregnancy.
   Graber, married father of daughters ages 18, 17 and 12 years,
has proposed a statewide study panel.
   ``Everything's not black-and-white on this issue,'' he said.
``Now we're talking about a three-day session where we're going to
solve all these complicated questions. It's unrealistic.''

<HEAD>Opera by Rock Drummer Opening in Cleveland</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KRISTI UMBREIT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CLEVELAND (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Cleveland Opera opens its season today not
with the works of Wagner or Puccini but with a tale of the Crusades
written by Stewart Copeland, former drummer for the rock group The
Police.
   ``Holy Blood and Crescent Moon'' is bona fide opera, a love
story with arias, choruses, grandiose sets and sweeping gestures,
drawn from Copeland's research and observations on Holy Land
history and current situation in the Middle East.
   Copeland, who spent six years with The Police before going on to
score movies and television shows, said Monday he doesn't put
himself in the same league as the masters but did use the qualities
found in traditional opera.
   ``The music is definitely very brooding,'' he said. ``It's very
bombastic. I use the orchestra to its fullest.''
   The opera, which took four years to write, is the result of
Copeland making good on a flip remark during a 1984 press
conference after he had written music for a ballet to Shakespeare's
King Lear for the San Francisco Ballet.
   When asked when he would write another ballet, he said it would
be ``after I finish my opera.''
   The son of Cleveland Opera General Manager David Bamberger heard
that remark and urged his father to commission Copeland, who had
ventured from rock music to write scores for the movie
``Rumblefish'' and the TV series ``The Equalizer.''
   Copeland, 37, said he knew little about opera when he agreed to
write one, and he had to learn to love the dissonant voices and
grand drama.
   Copeland, whose father headed the Middle East office of the CIA
and who grew up in the region, said elements of the same story are
in the war-wracked Middle East of recent years
   It tells the tale of Edmund, prince of the Franks, and Dahlia,
daughter of a Palestinian ruler, who help each other despite the
wars their people wage in the name of the land.

<HEAD>Confucius Is Man Of The Hour On 2540th Birthday</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   China's Communist government is holding a big
bash this year for the 2540th birthday of Confucius, the
philosopher once reviled for his reactionary ideas.
   The old sage, while still taken to task as a father of Chinese
feudalism, has now entered the party pantheon as a thinker who
embodied such socialist virtues as harmony, stability and obedience.
   New Communist Party General Secretary Jiang Zemin, in a meeting
with Confucian scholars Sunday, described Confucius (551-479 B.C.)
as a ``great ancient thinker of China.''
   The official Xinhua News Agency quoted Jiang as adding, ``it is
necessary to select the essence while discarding the dross from his
thought. The good side of his thought, in particular, should be
used to educate the younger generation in helping them inherit and
carry forward fine national traditions.''
   Some 300 scholars from 20 nations are holding a symposium on
Confucian thought in Beijing and Confucius' birthplace of Qufu, 300
miles to the south. It is being co-sponsored by the U.N. Education,
Science and Culture Organization.
   An exhibition on Confucius' life and work also opened at the
Capital Museum, a former Confucian temple. Sacrificial rites were
observed, the first time Beijing has staged a large-scale ceremony
in memory of Confucius since the Communist takeover in 1949.
   Qufu is also holding its first Confucius Cultural Festival to
mark the Sept. 28 birth of the sage whose ideas on filial piety and
social order still wield considerable influence in such Asian
countries as South Korea, Singapore and Japan.
   Much of the hoopla has been part of China's efforts to revive
its flagging tourist industry and develop Qufu as a tourist town.
But it also reflects the new appraisal of the old thinker.
   The Confucian tenets of loyalty, stability, sacrificing oneself
for the social good and obedience to one's masters have won favor
from the current Communist government, which is now seeking to
reassert control after crushing the pro-democracy movement this
spring.
   Confucianism, which through Chinese history gained religious
status with its own temples, was often been a target of Chinese
progressives.
   Leaders of the May 4th Movement of 1919, China's first
student-led campaign for democratic reform, said it represented
agrarian feudal values, denigrated women and showed excessive
respect for precedence, creating an obstacle to progress.
   Mao Tse-tung's revolutionaries, with their determination to
overturn traditional class order, rejected Confucius while seizing
the same ``mandate of heaven'' the scholar once bestowed on the
imperial family.
   In 1973 the Cultural Revolution government launched a massive
anti-Confucius, anti-Lin Biao campaign, linking Lin, Mao's
heir-apparent who died in a plane crash after failing to
assassinate Mao in 1971, to Confucius' reactionary ideology.
   The movement assailed those trying to restore ``feudalism,
capitalism and revisionism'' and accused Confucius of advocating
the establishment of a slave society.
   After the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution ended, Confucius was
rehabilitated.
   ``For centuries, people have either exalted and glorified him,
or disparaged and belittled him,'' the official China Daily said
Monday in an article on the ``profound influence'' of Confucian
ideas on contemporary China.
   ``But none can add to or detract from his position in Chinese
history as an outstanding thinker, statesman, educator and
classicist, deserving to be called a cultural giant of the world.''

says.
   ``We just didn't seem very happy anymore,'' Susanna Hoffs said

``Eternal Flame.''
   ``The last few years were very emotionally draining. After nine
years, we'd given so much to each other that it had become like a
marriage _ a long marriage,'' she said of the band, whose latest
album is ``Everything.'' ``It got to the point where we just didn't
have that `band' feeling anymore.''
   At a meeting three weeks ago, Ms. Hoffs, bassist Michael Steele,
guitarist Vicki Peterson and drummer Debbi Peterson, agreed to go
their seperate ways, at least for now, the lead singer said. Their
last public performance was Sept. 2 at the Redwood Amphitheatre in

   Paul Newman is still trim at 64, but
fans may notice he looks a little thickset in his new movie, ``Fat
Man and Little Boy.''
   The blue-eyed actor wore padding for the role of Gen. Leslie R.
Groves, the man who brought together the scientists who developed
the atomic bomb. At first Newman wore the padding just to appease
director Roland Joffe.
   ``But as the filming went on I realized it was working,'' Newman
told reporters after a Kansas City screening Sunday. ``They say the
average powerhouse executive is over 6 feet tall and weighs about
180 pounds. I think size and heft contribute something to their
ability to bulldoze things through, and that certainly was a
quality in Groves.''
   Newman said he was a gunner on a bomber off the coast of Japan
during World War II when he learned about the bomb.
   ``All I knew was that there had been a big explosion,'' he said.
``I was just a guy in a war, and I didn't have any idea of what it
was all about, of what the implications were.''

<TEXT>
   An unusual autumn rise in retail gasoline
prices has slowed nearly to a halt because of abundant oil supplies
and volume discounts to sellers, an industry analyst said.
   The biweekly Lundberg Survey of 12,000 gasoline stations
nationwide shows the average price, including taxes, for all grades
of gasoline was $109.56 a gallon _ up 0.13 cent a gallon from two
weeks earlier.
   The usual pattern of rising spring and summer prices, with fall
reductions based on slower consumption, was turned on its head this
year, analyst Trilby Lundberg said Sunday.
   ``They rose in spring, fell in summer and rose in the fall. At
any rate, the situation seems to be returning to normal,'' she said.
   Rising insurance and other costs to retailers have made it
important for them to sell in high volume, something oil companies
are pushing by offering volume discounts, Ms. Lundberg said.
   At self-service stations, the latest Lundberg Survey shows
regular leaded at 96.87 cents a gallon, regular unleaded at 98.49
cents and premium unleaded at $1.16.
   At full-service pumps, regular unleaded was $1.26 a gallon,
regular unleaded was $1.27 and premium unleaded was $1.40.

   Larry Davidson lavished months of attention
on one prickly vine in hopes of growing the Great Pumpkin, but was
disappointed when plants he gave less water and manure produced
greater gourds.
   ``I spend so much time pampering one plant and it doesn't
cooperate,'' grumbled the owner of Larry Davidson &amp; Sons Giant
Pumpkins.
   He had sheltered his favored seedling with a tent, warmed it
with a space heater, encouraged it with a grow light, dumped 1,600
gallons of water on it and monitored it with a thermostat.
   The chosen seed turned into a 250-pound pumpkin, but others on
Davidson's eight-acre farm grew larger.
   Davidson, who claims to have the largest selection of giant
pumpkins for sale in the Midwest, says it's not the first time he's
been thwarted in his efforts to nurture the biggest pumpkin in the
world.
   One year he paid $5 apiece for seeds from a whopper Nova Scotia
parent weighing 644 pounds. But the offspring ``turned out to be
some sort of mutants, and none of them was over 100 pounds.''
   Davidson's biggest pumpkin ever, which weighed 347 pounds, grew
on its own one year where a cow yard drains manure and water.
   ``They're never in any place you'd expect them to grow,'' he
said.
   The world record pumpkin was a 671-pound gourd raised by Robert
Gancarz of Jacobstown, N.J., in 1986.
   Davidson plans to travel to Elk Grove Village, Ill., today for
this year's World Pumpkin Weigh-Off, sponsored by the World Pumpkin
Confederation. The event links points around the world by telephone
conference call to find the biggest gourd.

   The Indigo Girls say their brand of
folk-rock music isn't necessarily part of a return-to-roots
movement among pop performers.
   ``I don't know if we're big enough to be part of a trend,'' Amy
Ray said in a recent interview. ``I think once every 15 years
acoustic music gets popular again. But we never thought of acoustic
music not being popular.''
   Ray and her partner, Emily Saliers, have been getting
unaccustomed attention since their debut album, ``Indigo Girls,''
went gold two weeks ago.
   The childhood friends from Decatur, Ga., began collaborating
when they were in high school and became the Indigo Girls while
students at Emory University in Atlanta.
   Ray said her listening tastes lean more toward rock 'n' roll,
while Saliers favors the acoustic sound.

   Nearly five centuries after Christopher
Columbus set sail, scientists still debate whether European
explorers unleashed the scourge of syphilis on the Americas. A
study says it might have been the other way around.
   Research by two University of Massachusetts anthropologists
cites studies of skeletal remains that they say show forms of
syphilis existed in the New World before Columbus and his crew
landed.
   In contrast, the researchers said studies from the pre-1492 Old
World show almost no evidence of syphilis.
   Doctoral candidate Brenda J. Baker and Professor George J.
Armelagos base part of their conclusions on an apparent epidemic of
syphilis in Europe in the 1500s.
   Their research was presented in an article, ``The Origin and
Antiquity of Syphilis,'' which appeared in a recent issue of
Current Anthropology.
   An opposing theory holds that venereal syphilis was present in
Europe before it was transported by the explorers to America, but
at the time the disease was not distinguished from leprosy.
   Another theory suggests the disease has occurred independently
in both continents.
   The Massachusetts researchers cite one case of a skull showing
signs of syphilis from a London cemetery. But they note the
cemetery was used between 1197 and 1537, and it is impossible to
date the bone exactly.
   Another case from Norway could be pre-Columbian, the researchers
note, raising the possibility that Norse explorers brought the
disease back to their country. Explorers led by Leif Ericson are
acknowledged to have landed in Greenland a little more than 500
years before Columbus crossed the Atlantic.
   Syphilis is detected by such marks as lesions on bones and marks
on skulls, Baker said. It is usually transmitted sexually and, if
untreated, it can lead to the degeneration of bones, heart and
nerve tissue.
   Several skeletons marked by syphilis have been excavated in
Australia but the dating is uncertain, the study said. A handful of
possibly pre-Columbian syphilitic bones have been found in
southeast Asia, but that is compared to hundreds of discoveries in
the Americas, Baker said.
   Whether a European epidemic of syphilis occurred after the
sailors' return isn't entirely clear. Baker and Armelagos conclude
it did after reviewing documents, studies of bones and numerous
ordinances passed throughout Europe in the late 1490s concerning
the disease. Opposing theorists say the outbreak merely reflected
the recognition that syphilis was distinct from leprosy.
   The various explanations of the origin of syphilis have
fascinated scientists for two reasons _ sex and politics, says Al
B. Wesolowsky, managing editor of the Journal of Field Archeology
at Boston University.
   ``First, syphilis is a venereal disease and so anything
connected with sex often has an interest in and of its own,'' he
said. The question also has political implications in light of a
growing awareness that Native Americans see 1492 as an invasion
that led to their exploitation and devastation by imported diseases
such as smallpox and tuberculosis, he said.
   Gary Kimble, executive director of the New York-based
Association on American Indian Affairs, said the disease could have
been circulated from the Middle East to Europe and from there to
the Americas.
   But he professed little interest in the debate, and said his
agency is working on the more pressing issue of halting excavation
and public display of Native Americans' bones.
   Kimble said a bigger issue than the origin of syphilis is the
way Columbus' travels have been characterized.
   ``The conclusions of the Incan and pre-Incan civilizations,
their importance and their sophistication has really been
minimized,'' he said. The Incas dominated in Peru until the Spanish
conquest.
   Kimble said there were an estimated 30 million Indians in the
Northern Hemisphere in 1492, and just 400,000 in 1900.
   ``That's the story of Columbus,'' he said.

   Along a dimly lit East Berlin thoroughfare
apartment dwellers wave sparklers, cheer and applaud from
balconies, urging on thousands of people demonstrating for
democratic reform.
   In a crowded, smoke-filled bar, a young man shouts ``Happy
birthday police state'' and his companions assail the repressive
policies of the hard-line Communist government.
   They jeer at weekend celebrations marking the state's 40th
anniversary.
   In the most dramatic show of public dissatisfaction in more than
three decades, East Germans have sent a clear message to the aging
leadership: they want reform and momentum for change is growing.
   At least 50,000 East Germans gave up hope that the orthodox
Communist government was capable of change and have fled West since
mid-September in the largest such exodus since the Berlin Wall was
built in 1961.
   For many left behind, anger over the government's intolerance of
change and dissent came into full force as authorities trumpeted
four decades of achievements in elaborate ceremonies.
   Public discontent translated into massive street protests in
East Berlin and at least five provincial cities on a scale that
hadn't been seen since a 1953 workers' revolt was crushed by Soviet
tanks.
   ``They (East Germany's leaders) have ignored and underestimated
just how many people are fed up with this lousy system,'' said a
30-year-old East German woman who asked not to be identified
because she feared reprisal.
   Hope for change has taken on new urgency as democratic reform
sweeps the Soviet Union, Poland and Hungary. East Germans hope
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev can help bring change to this
country of 16.6 million.
   But East German leaders have rejected the need for change and
routinely suppress fledgling opposition groups. Prominent
opposition activists are frequently expelled to West Germany.
   Open dissent has traditionally been suppressed swiftly and
brutally by security forces, but the weekend crushing of street
protests was the most violent in recent memory.
   ``The only people who are satisfied here are people who reap
party privileges,'' one man said.
   The Communist Party controls most aspects of everyday life and
although East Germans enjoy a higher standard of living than their
East bloc neighbors, the atmosphere is clouded by gloom and a sense
of powerlessness.
   Many complain of the severe restrictions imposed on travel to
the West. Even within the East bloc, Czechoslovakia was the only
country East Germans could travel to freely. Then, last week, that
border was closed.
   The mass emigration of East Germans that helped stir the recent
protests is a principal topic of conversation in East Berlin.
   ``It's not easy to give up everything and leave friends and
family behind,'' said a 24-year-old waitress.
   Others weigh the achievements in some spheres against life in a
repressive state.
   ``Most East Germans would say that they are proud of many of the
social benefits socialism has brought to the people,'' said a
27-year-old university student, referring to free day-care and
medical treatment.
   ``But a joyless, restricted life is the price we're paying for
it.''
   Those who have decided to stay and work for change are buoyed by
new opposition groups and the spontaneous support for the
pro-democracy demonstrations.
   ``I still have hope,'' said a 35-year-old East Berlin man who
said he was fired from an adminstrative job after openly defending
a human rights group. ``This is only the beginning.''

   NASA prepared to start the countdown
for the space shuttle Atlantis today despite the promise of
anti-nuclear activists to sit on the launch pad if necessary to
block a payload that carries radioactive plutonium.
   Pending a federal judge's approval, Atlantis is to lift off at
1:29 p.m. Thursday with five astronauts who are to dispatch the
nuclear-powered Galileo spacecraft to explore the planet Jupiter.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration decided to
begin the count on schedule this morning even though a decision is
pending on a lawsuit by three citizens' groups seeking a temporary
restraining order to halt the launch. The groups contend that an
explosion on liftoff could spread cancer-causing plutonium
particles over a large area of east-central Florida.
   NASA officials say the two nuclear-powered generators aboard
Galileo have been thoroughly tested and that flying them poses
minimal health and environmental risks.
   U.S. District Judge Oliver Gasch scheduled oral arguments on the
suit for Tuesday in Washington.
   This is the first time anyone has gone to court to stop a space
launch.
   The space agency said it could stop the countdown at the 11-hour
mark for several days to await the judge's decision, if necessary.
   The activists have said that if they lose in court, they will
attempt to block the flight by infiltrating the launch area
Thursday.
   ``We are going to attempt to enter the launch area and sit on
the launch pad,'' said Bruce Gagnon, coordinator for the Florida
Coalition for Peace and Justice, one of the groups that filed the
suit.
   More than 200 security guards armed with M-16 assault rifles and
semiautomatic 9mm pistols will patrol the Kennedy Space Center to
stop any infiltrators, and the center also will be guarded by
helicopters and boats.
   ``They indicated to us and to the press an intent to do some
back-country-type activities to try to stop the launch,'' said Gary
Wistrand, deputy director of the space center's security office.
``We are postured to try to prevent that.''
   There is only a 10-minute launch period available on Thursday,
and NASA is concerned the time could be consumed if protesters
penetrate the launch danger zone with a boat, plane or on foot in
the final minutes of the countdown.
   The astronauts who will fly the mission were to arrive here this
afternoon from their training base in Houston. All five said they
are not concerned about flying with plutonium.
   ``I have absolutely no qualms about the devices,'' said
commander Donald Williams.
   The generators, each containing 24.7 pounds of radioactive
plutonium-238 dioxide, were installed Sunday in the Galileo probe
stored in Atlantis' cargo bay.
   Officials said without nuclear power, spacecraft could not
function at distant planets like Jupiter because they are too far
away to draw energy from the sun.
   In a brief filed last week, the citizens' groups said the
government underestimated or covered up the danger of plutonium
contamination from any shuttle explosion like the one that
destroyed the shuttle Challenger in 1986.
   NASA responded that the organizations were spreading a ``tale of
horrors,'' and that tests show the generators would survive a
Challenger-like explosion.
   The agency said similar generators have flown on 22 U.S. space
vehicles, including five manned Apollo moon missions, and that in
three instances the well-protected devices survived severe
accidents _ two rocket blowups and a fiery re-entry through Earth's
atmosphere.
   The probability of a release of plutonium in a launching
accident is less than 1 in 2,500, NASA said. The opponents put the
odds at 1 in 430.

<HEAD>High Court to Weigh Modification of Miranda Ruling in Illinois Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A case involving an unwitting jailhouse
confession by a murder suspect could change the scope of the U.S.
Supreme Court's Miranda ruling on the rights of criminal suspects.
   The high court last week agreed to review a ruling by an
Illinois appellate court. The state court said the confession
should be suppressed because it was made before the suspect was
advised of his right to remain silent and have an attorney, both
guaranteed under the 1966 Miranda ruling.
   Lloyd Perkins, 24, thought he was confiding in two inmates in a
county jail in 1986 when he allegedly admitted to a drug-related
slaying. But one of the ``inmates'' was an undercover police
officer, planted in jail to quiz Perkins.
   Prosecutors say the confession is the cornerstone of their
murder case against Perkins, who could face the death penalty if
convicted.
   ``We can't win without it,'' said John Baricevic, state's
attorney in St. Clair County.
   But the appellate court, in a 1988 ruling, declared that
Perkins' statements ``were not given through a knowing and
intelligent waiver of his rights, but were in fact the questionable
product of an intentional subversion of those rights.''
   The court rejected the prosecutors' argument that Miranda
applies only in those situations where a figure of authority
directly interrogates a suspect.
   ``There is no authority in these circumstances for the police to
do indirectly what they may not do directly,'' the court said. The
Illinois Supreme Court earlier this year refused to hear the case.
   Defense attorney Dan Evers said he doesn't think the U.S.
Supreme Court's ruling is likely to have a widespread impact.
``Nobody has ever tried to any great extent having undercover cops
in jail,'' he said.
   But Baricevic said that could change with a favorable Supreme
Court ruling. He said law-enforcement officials have tended to back
away from such investigative techniques when they believe they
already have a strong case against a defendant and don't want to
jeopardize it.
   St. Clair County authorities had no suspects in the November
1984 killing of Richard Stephenson until early 1986. Then Donald
Charlton, an inmate at the Graham Correctional Facility, told
police that Perkins had admitted to killing someone in the East St.
Louis area two years earlier. At the time, Perkins was the prison
on a theft charge.
   Authorities obtained a court order for Charlton's release from
prison to assist in their investigation.
   In 1986, police planted undercover officer John Parisi and
Charlton in the Montgomery County Jail as escaped convicts; Perkins
was at that jail awaiting trial on an unrelated charge.
   Charlton renewed his acquaintance with Perkins and introduced
him to Parisi, and the three began plotting an escape, according to
prosecutors.
   Police said Perkins told Parisi that a man had paid him $5,000
to cripple Stephenson because Stephenson owed the man money for
drugs and had been having an affair with the man's wife. Court
documents didn't identify the man who allegedly hired Perkins.
   Prosecutors say the confession should be allowed as evidence
because Perkins could not have thought he was undergoing coercive
police questioning at the time.
   Perkins is currently serving a 30-year sentence in the Menard
Correctional Center on an unrelated aggravated battery conviction.
   The Supreme Court ruled in 1980 that law enforcement officials
cannot hire jailhouse informants to induce criminal defendants in
custody to make incriminating statements.
   The justices in that ruling relied on their own 1964 decision _
handed down two years before Miranda _ that barred government
agents from eliciting incriminating information from defendants
entitled to a lawyer's help during interrogation.

<HEAD>Mayor Praised for Organizing Relief Efforts After Hugo</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr. was somber as
the 135-mph winds of Hurricane Hugo roared outside, wrenching the
tin roof off Charleston's antebellum City Hall.
   ``All we can do now is pray,'' he said quietly to a handful of
staff and reporters gathered in his candlelit office to ride out
the storm.
   From that dark hour, the 46-year-old mayor emerged as a symbol
of the determination with which residents are digging out from the
Sept. 21 hurricane, the worst storm to hit South Carolina in a
century.
   He organized a relief effort which brought tons of supplies and
hundreds of thousands of dollars to Charleston, much of which was
sent to storm-ravaged areas miles from the city.
   He also imposed a curfew to prevent looting and took quick steps
to prevent price gouging.
   ``He was there the entire time. He was in the shelters and he
was always there with the people,'' said Susie Crosby, a paralegal.
   Sara Joyner, an administrative secretary at a law firm, agreed.
``He was totally in charge,'' she said.
   Riley worked 18-hour days through the clean-up effort and
fielded hundreds of questions daily from the media. He was sharply
critical of the federal response to the disaster, blasting the
Federal Emergency Management Agency for what he said was an
inadequate response.
   FEMA officials blasted Riley back, and Mark Chambers, a
spokesman for Gov. Carroll Campbell, defended FEMA's efforts.
``FEMA is providing everything the state of South Carolina needs.
We're talking about one of the most devastating storms in recent
history. It's being done,'' he said.
   That storm has mostly passed. Now, the mayor is spending much of
his time urging tourists to return to the 319-year-old city. He
said the city has bounced back.
   In an interview last week, he wore a T-shirt proclaiming
``Charleston, S.C., Going Strong.'' Scattered around room were
cards and letters from people moved by Charleston's plight.
   Riley, who has served as mayor for more than a decade, had urged
residents a day before Hugo struck to evacuate low-lying areas. He
directed his staff to contact mayors of cities hit by hurricanes in
recent years to pick their minds about preparations.
   Hurricane Hugo toppled dozens of buildings in the city and
damaged about 80 percent of the roofs. But Riley said the miracle
is that so few lives were lost _ only one in the Charleston.
Seventeen other deaths across the state were attributed to the
storm.
   ``This hurricane had blood on its mind,'' Riley said.
   Throughout the ordeal, Riley said his most enduring impression
of the storm was the courage of his fellow Charlestonians.
   ``People who lost homes say they're lucky to be alive. People
who lost a roof say they're lucky to have a house. The people are
courageous, and thankful and spirited,'' the mayor said.

   Six climbers were found dead in the northern Japan
Alps today after the season's first snow and two others from the
same group died later after being evacuated by helicopter, police
said.
   The eight _ six men and two women _ were members of a 10-member
party from western Kyoto and neighboring towns who started a climb
Saturday and planned to return today, said Toyama Prefectural
police.
   The climbers, who ranged in age from the late 40s to 60s, may
have died of exposure after getting caught in a sudden snowstorm in
light clothing, local press reports said.
   It was the most people killed in a mountaineering accident in
Japoan since March 1982, when 12 climbers were killed in an
avalanche in the central Japan Alps.
   A local police officer said six climbers were found dead when
rangers arrived this morning in mountains near Mount Masago, a
9,438-foot peak in western Japan.
   Two others found wandering near a ridgeline were conscious when
the rangers arrived but died at a hospital later after being
evacuated by helicopter, said the officer, who spoke on condition
of anonymity.
   He said rangers found two other members of the group wandering
near Mount Masago. One was taken by a police helicopter to a
hospital in Toyama, 160 miles west of Tokyo, and the other was
under treatment at a nearby mountain hut. Their condition was not
immediately known.
   The Asahi Shimbun newspaper quoted Kazuhiro Nomura, one of the
two rescued, as saying one of the group's members fell ill Sunday
afternoon during the hike to Mt. Masago.
   They were caught in season's first snow, the police officer said.

   Churches around the country can help
South Carolina rebuild by adopting a family victimized by Hurricane
Hugo, Gov. Carroll Campbell said.
   ``This long-term recovery process is going to take long-term
support,'' Campbell told about 300 members of the Citadel Square
Baptist Church in downtown Charleston Sunday.
   ``Many families have lost everything. They are not going to
bounce back from those circumstances,'' he said.
   In South Carolina, 24 counties and 1.8 million people were
affected as Hugo rolled through the state Sept. 21, killing 18 and
causing damage estimated at up to $5 billion.
   Campbell has held several news conferences since the storm, but
Sunday was the first time he spoke about the storm in person to a
formal gathering of Charleston residents.
   Services at the 134-year-old church in downtown Charleston,
which itself suffered some $250,000 in roof, window and other
damage, were taped for broadcast on the American Christian
Television System.
   Campbell used the opportunity to promote the Adopt-A-Family
program announced last week as a means of linking individual
congregations with families affected by the hurricane.
   He urged all willing churches to contact their South Carolina
counterparts, which in turn would put them in touch with troubled
families.
   The churches are needed, the Republican governor said, to
provide ``spiritual, material and moral support`` for up to a year.
   Campbell's wife, Iris, who conceived the plan, said church
leaders are supportive. But she said many congregations would
consider the program for the first time Sunday and it was too early
to tell how many congregations will participate.
   ``We'll be back,'' Campbell told his audience. ``With the spirit
now in this state, with the help of America and with the help of
God, we'll rebuild, and we'll reestablish and we will endure.''
   Meanwhile, about 3,000 of South Carolina Electric &amp; Gas' 132,000
Charleston-area customers remained without power Sunday, said
company spokesman Bill Lide.

   The dollar eased slightly against the Japanese yen
Monday, while share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange gained
ground.
   The dollar closed at 142.23 yen, down 0.22 yen from Friday's
close of 142.45 yen. After opening at 141.60 yen, the currency
moved in a range of 141.60-142.28 yen.
   On the stock market, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected
issues, a 313.64-point loser Friday, won back 167.00 points, or
0.47 percent, to close at 35,376.35.
   Currency dealers said the dollar's slump followed a U.S. Labor
Department report Friday that the nation's unemployment rate rose
to 5.3 percent in Semptember from 5.2 percent in both July and
August.
   ``The market now is a bit concerned about a possible move'' by
the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to lower its federal fund
rates, said a dealer with the Bank of Tokyo on condition of
anonymity.
   Another dealer at Daiichi Kangyo Bank said: ``Now that the
incentive to buy the dollar is calming down it is uncertain whether
the Bank of Japan will continue to give upward pressure on interest
rates. Either way, the dollar is expected to remain bullish'' in
the long run.
   Securities dealers said investors were reacting favorably to the
strengthening yen early Monday.
   ``The environment is sound, but with a national holiday the next
day, we can't really expect much of market activities today,'' said
a dealer at a major Japanese securities firm, requesting anonymity.
   Banks, government offices, foreign exchanges and stock markets
and many businesses will be closed Tuesday, Oct.10, for Sports Day,
a national holiday in Japan.

<HEAD>Police Find Body Of Official; Justice Minister Takes Office</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Police found the bullet-riddled body of
the Medellin army commander's private secretary stashed in a car
just hours after the president swore in a new justice minister and
two other Cabinet officers.
   Nury Velasquez de Vasquez was kidnapped Friday in Medellin,
Colombia's cocaine center, and her body was found Sunday 10 miles
to the northwest, in Marinilla. No group claimed responsibility for
the slaying.
   The Medellin army brigade has been active in confiscating
properties allegedly belonging to traffickers. The confiscations
are part of the government's 2-month-old crackdown on the country's
cocaine barons.
   Colombia's new justice minister, Roberto Salazar Manrique, is
the ninth to serve under President Virgilio Barco. He was sworn in
along with Interior Minister Carlos Lemos Simmonds and
Communications Minister Enrique Danies Rincones.
   Salazar, a graduate of Notre Dame University, replaces Monica de
Greiff, 32, who resigned after death threats from drug traffickers
during the 70 days she served in office.
   Shortly after taking office, Salazar told reporters he did not
fear traffickers, who are thought to have killed former Justice
Minister Rodrigo Lara Bonilla in 1984.
   He reiterated his pledge to carry out ``firmly and fairly'' the
extradition of Colombian drug suspects to the United States, where
many face trafficking and money-laundering charges.
   In Colombia, drug barons have operated with relative impunity by
paying off or intimidating judges.
   The new justice minister faces the difficult task of pushing
forward the unprecedented government crackdown, which Barco
declared a day after traffickers assassinated the leading
presidential contender.
   In retaliation, traffickers declared war on the government.
Since mid-August, 148 bombings and arson attacks have killed 10
people and injured 164 in Bogota, the capital, and Medellin.
   In commencing the crackdown, Barco issued emergency decrees
allowing the extradition of cocaine barons and the seizure of their
property.
   He has said he will not negotiate with traffickers, who want to
hold talks with the government on its new extradition policy.
   But in newspaper interviews published Sunday, a former interior
minister said he carried messages from the Medellin Cartel _ the
world's largest drug trafficking organization _ to a top aide to
Barco.
   The El Tiempo newspaper quoted Joaquin Vallejo as saying that
although there were no direct negotiations, the president's general
secretary, German Montoya, did not discourage indirect contacts
with traffickers.
   Vallejo said Montoya, who apparently acted on orders from Barco,
was willing to consider negotiations if the United States agreed to
participate. U.S. government opposition made talks impossible,
Vallejo said.
   In a communique, Montoya said his decision to meet with Vallejo
was a personal one and that he told the former interior minister a
dialogue between the government and the cartel was impossible.
   Also Sunday, an explosion and fire killed seven people and
injured eight on a Bogota bus. Police initially said they thought
it was caused by an incendiary bomb but later said that theory was
in question.
   The radio network Caracol quoted a policeman at the scene as
saying the fire originated from a five-gallon plastic container
filled with gasoline that had been carried by a passenger.
   Three children were among the victims, who struggled in vain to
climb out of the burning bus, police said.

   Wildlife specialists have squared
off for a bitter fight over how to keep Africa's endangered
elephant population from vanishing forever into ivory piano keys
and chess pieces.
   Delegates from more than 100 countries will meet through Oct. 20
at the biennial conference of the Convention on International Trade
in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora. There were strategy
sessions Sunday, but the conference formally opens today.
   Although they will also consider the smooth-coated otter, the
salmon-crested cockatoo and a Noah's Ark of other species,
attention is focused on pachyderms and their valuable ivory.
   By some reckoning, the great lumbering African elephant, for
many an unmatchable symbol of the wild, will survive mainly in zoos
by the turn of the century.
   ``When we talk about halving the population in 10 years, we're
talking about disaster,'' Iain Douglas-Hamilton, a widely respected
expert, said in an interview from Kenya.
   David Western of Wildlife Conservation International, who
commissioned the last census, said: ``Numbers are dropping so fast
elephants may be exterminated in most areas within 20 or 30 years.''
   Overall, he said, just more than 600,000 remain in Africa,
compared to estimates ranging from 1.3 million to 4 million a
decade ago. Each year, poachers kill at least 70,000, often
spraying gunfire at females and calves along with the few old
tuskers left.
   In Kenya alone, fewer than 17,000 are left of the 165,000
elephants counted in 1970.
   The convention's rulings become non-legally binding agreements
that rely on international pressure for enforcement. A convention
member may abstain from a resolution, but risks being branded an
environmental bad guy.
   Delegates must find common ground between the East African
demand for an ivory ban, backed by the United States and Western
Europe, and southern Africa's push for trade in culled tusks.
   Zimbabwe, South Africa and Botswana argue that careful
management has increased their herds and that ivory finances
anti-poaching measures.
   ``We have a very healthy elephant population that must be culled
or it will simply destroy its own environment,'' Bosman Olivier of
South Africa's Department for Environmental Affairs said in
Johannesburg.
   Zimbabwe earns $9 million a year by selling ivory from herds
estimated at 52,000.
   ``You don't ban something valuable, you protect it,'' said
Ingrid Schroeder of the Save Endangered African Wildlife, which
works in Zimbabwe.
   William Nduku, Zimbabwe's director of parks and wildlife said,
``It's not fair to treat Africa as if it was a small country.''
   But a broad coalition of experts and environmentalists,
including Greenpeace and the Humane Society of the United States,
say that exceptions to a ban leave doors wide open to abuse.
   ``These arguments are based on a pack of lies: the numbers, the
level of poaching and the ability to control trade,'' said Craig
Van Note of the Washington-based Monitor Consortium.
   Elephants and poachers ignore orders, experts say, and trade in
wildlife products is as hard to control as drug trafficking.
Documents are easy to falsify.
   For example, Burundi lost its last elephant, an old bull, years
ago, but officials there have managed to export up to 100 tons per
year of ivory.
   In 1986, the convention granted a blanket amnesty to 89 tons of
ivory in Burundi as the start of an African quota system. Since
then, convention officials admit another 87 tons of ivory _ the
tusks of nearly 15,000 elephants _ have appeared in the nation.
   The ban lobby is countered by well-funded traders, mostly based
in Hong Kong, who fear an end to a billion-dollar industry in
carvings, jewelry and personalized name stamps used widely in Japan.
   African elephants fall under the convention's Appendix Two for
threatened species. Controlled trade is allowed in that category.
Shifting them to Appendix One, endangered species, would mean a ban.
   Eugene Lapointe, secretary-general of the convention, has
recommended a split-listing placing elephants on Appendix One but
allowing those countries with controlled legal trade to continue.
   He said a total ban might force some member countries to declare
reservations, allowing them to bypass convention guidelines.
   Western said he favors a ban but with accommodation for southern
Africa, under strict control. He is working on a method of tracing
tusks based on genetic ``fingerprinting.''
   But many specialists express concern that complex exceptions
could lead to the end of elephants in the wild.
   Experts note the southern Africa group includes Mozambique and
Angola, where lingering civil wars have decimated wildlife.
Mozambican rebels and Zambian poachers frequently penetrate Zambian
reserves.
   Cynthia Moss, author of ``Elephant Memories,'' said, ``Zambia is
wearing blinders. They cannot stop the poaching.''
   Van Note testified before the U.S. Congress last year that
poaching is rampant in parts of southern Africa. A few recent
incidents suggest serious problems.
   Last month, South African newspapers reported a plane that
crashed on takeoff from an Angola rebel camp was overloaded with
ivory. The Portuguese pilot, Joaquim Augusto, owned a truck found
earlier in Namibia with 7 tons of tusks.
   The plane was carrying three Portuguese legislators, including
Joao Soares, son of President Mario Soares, who had visited the
headquarters of the National Union for the Total Independence of
Angola, or UNITA. Soares was badly injured.
   Last year, after U.S. groups accused Pretoria of helping UNITA
finance its rebellion by trafficking ivory, a South African board
of inquiry denied any large-scale military involvement. But the
board said the army did help UNITA transport tusks from 1976 to
1979.
   Two South African army officers were among six people indicted
last year in Connecticut on charges of smuggling rhino horn, skins
of endangered animals and assault rifles into the United States.

<HEAD>Voters Rejects Plans Intended to Increase More Black Judges</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN SAYRE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A plan designed to elect more black judges
has failed in part because of voter concern over a grandfather
clause that would have protected the jobs of mostly white
incumbents, analysts said.
   Bill Quigley, an attorney for blacks who challenged the current
election systems, said Sunday voters didn't support the proposals
because ``there are ... people in the state not interested in
providing equal opportunity to black candidates.''
   ``In addition,'' he said, ``those `no' votes were joined by
people who are interested in giving opportunity to black
candidates, but are not interested in giving special opportunities
to white, male incumbents.''
   Two proposed constitutional amendments _ one dealing with the
Louisiana Supreme Court and another covering district and appellate
judges _ were turned down overwhelmingly in every parish.
   The proposals received the most negative votes among 13
constitutional amendments decided Saturday. The Supreme Court plan
was rejected by 69 percent of the voters, while 70 percent opposed
the other plan. In heavily black Orleans Parish, the propositions
failed by 3-1 margins. The secretary of state said only 31 percent
of the registered voters cast ballots.
   There were no major campaigns either for or against the
propositions.
   A couple of other items on the ballot fared better.
   Voters overwhelmingly approved a 4-cent boost in gasoline taxes
to finance a $1.4 billion highway improvement program; a special
fund for coastal restoration projects; and a tough property
confiscation measure aimed at drug dealers.
   The judicial propositions were drawn up by the Legislature in
response to two suits alleging that the current election system for
judges illegally dilutes black voting strength.
   Voter rejection probably will result in federal courts carving
out new plans, Quigley said.
   Gov. Buddy Roemer said Sunday he would meet with judges in hopes
that the system can be revised without federal intervention.
   Currently, there are no black Supreme Court justices. There is
one black among the state's 52 appellate court judges and five
black district judges out of 192.
   U.S. District Judge John Parker of Baton Rouge ordered a new
system for district and appellate court judges. Although U.S.
District Judge Charles Schwartz of New Orleans upheld the current
Supreme Court system, the decision is being appealed.
   Under the Legislature's plan, additional district and appellate
judgeships would have been carved from election districts. Although
the judges would be elected on a subdistrict basis, they would have
served the entire district.
   Also, 35 district and appellate judges who would be displaced by
the new plans could opt for senior status, under which they would
keep their jobs at full pay for eight to 10 years.
   ``I think the creation of senior judges was instrumental'' in
the defeat, said Ed Renwick, a veteran Louisiana political analyst.
``The people aren't going to fund that in an era where the funds
aren't available (for) the basics.''
   According to legislative estimates, the plans would have cost an
additional $5.5 million over the next two years.

<HEAD>Ballots Printed For Riveredge, But No One Lives There</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CLEVELAND (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Voter turnout isn't likely to be very good in
Riveredge Township next month. Ballots will be printed and a
polling place has been designated _ but no one lives there anymore.
   ``Unless we hear from the courts or some other governmental body
that it no longer exists, we still maintain it as a voting place,''
said Laura Jones, spokeswoman for the Cuyahoga County Board of
Elections.
   The township is adjacent to Cleveland Hopkins International
Airport and once was the site of a 256-home trailer park. The last
resident left in 1986.
   ``I lived there, my parents lived there, and my grandparents
lived there, but there isn't any town there anymore,'' said Jack
Ullrich, who now lives in Cleveland.
   The ballot will have four spots _ three for township trustees
and one for township clerk _ where the words ``No candidate filed
for this position'' will be printed.
   Ms. Jones said election records showed the township has seven
registered voters, all of whom either have died or moved away
without notifying the board since 1985 _ the last time someone in
Riveredge actually voted.
   ``It is bizzare, but we have to go through the motions,'' she
told The (Cleveland) Plain Dealer.
   Ms. Jones said the cost of holding the election will be minimal.
   ``We've put the polling place in conjunction with a Cleveland
precinct, so we don't have to hire separate booth officials for
Riveredge,'' she said. ``Provided anybody shows up, they will of
course take care of the voters, but we kind of figure that
Cleveland precinct can handle it.''
   Although Riveredge is empty, it's far from a dead issue.
Cleveland and the suburb of Fairview Park are battling in the
courts to get control of the ghost township.
   Fairview Park would like to build a high-tech office park there.
Cleveland hopes to extend a runway at Hopkins onto Riveredge's
land. Both sides would like the approximately $270,000 in income
tax revenue generated at the NASA Lewis Research Center, which
rests within Riveredge's boundaries.
   Last week, the 8th Ohio District Court of Appeals voided an
annexation proceeding undertaken by Fairview Park last year,
throwing the 6-year-old case back to Cuyahoga County Common Pleas
Court.
   Riveredge was little more than several scattered homes, a few
small shops and the trailer park in 1983 when neighboring Cleveland
announced plans to expand a runway at Hopkins.
   Fairview Park opposed the plan, which would bring more air
traffic over the western suburbs, and it offered annexation to
Riveredge. But residents voted against that offer in 1984.
   Most residents began moving out after Cleveland bought the
privately owned trailer park in May 1984 and offered residents
money to relocate.

<HEAD>Dollar Down, Stocks Up In Tokyo</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar fell slightly against the Japanese yen
today, contributing to a gain by the Tokyo Stock Exchange's main
index.
   The dollar closed at 142.23 yen, down 0.22 yen from its close of
142.45 yen last Friday, when it rose 1.40 yen. The dollar opened
today at 141.60 yen, its low for the day, and ranged as high as
142.28 yen.
   Currency dealers said the dollar's decline followed a Washington
Labor Department report on Friday that the U.S. unemployment rate
rose to 5.3 percent in September from 5.2 percent in July and
August.
   They said this might encourage the Federal Reserve Board to
lower interest rates, which would tend to make the dollar less
attractive to foreign investors.
   But a dealer at Daiichi Kangyo Bank said the dollar was expected
to keep its strength in the long run.
   ``Now that the incentive to buy the dollar is calming down, it
is uncertain whether the Bank of Japan will continue to put upward
pressure on (Japanese) interest rates,'' said the dealer, on
condition of anonymity.
   He said the announcement of the latest U.S. consumer price index
later this week likely will give the market a direction.
   On the stock market, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected
issues, a 313.64-point loser on Friday, regained 167.00 points, or
0.47 percent, closing at 35,376.35.
   Securities dealers attributed the rebound to the dollar' easing
against the Japanese yen.
   ``Investors were reacting favorably to the strengthening of the
yen today,'' said a dealer at Nikko Securities Co., on condition of
anonymity.
   Another dealer said, ``the environment is sound, but with a
national holiday the next day, we can't really expect much market
activity today.''
   Volume traded on the first section of the exchange, where major
shares are listed, was estimated at 700 million shares.
   Banks, government offices, foreign exchange and stock markets
and many businesses will be closed Tuesday for Sports Day, a
national holiday in Japan.

<HEAD>Logging Truck Hits Hayride Wagon, Killing 12</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   CAP-PELE, New Brunswick (AP) _ A logging truck crashed into a
wagon that was taking relatives at a family reunion on a hayride,
killing 12 people and injuring 45, many of whom were pinned or
crushed by logs, witnesses said.
   Several of those injured in Sunday's crash were in critical
condition and five of the dead were children, according to a
hospital spokesmen in Moncton, 25 miles west of Cormier, where the
accident occurred.
   About 50 people were involved in Sunday's outing, part of a
traditional family reunion in Cormier each Canadian Thanksgiving
weekend. Most were riding on the hay-covered wagon, which was being
towed by a tractor when it was hit.
   Others were traveling behind in two pickup trucks, both of which
were also hit by the logging truck. One tipped over and dumped its
riders into a ditch.
   ``The logs ended up on the people when the truck failed to
negotiate the curve'' on a two-lane highway, said a local resident,
Gerry LeBlanc.
   Edmond Leger, another local resident, said the tractor-trailor
jack-knifed and fell on the hay-covered wagon. He said one man lost
three members of his immediate family.
   ``The worst thing was that it happened only about 100 yards from
the hall where the family reunion was being held,'' said Val Gogen,
who works at a gas station in Cormier.
   Stricken family members, many in tears, stumbled around the
accident site desperately looking for relatives, a police officer
said.
   The accident occurred on Highway 945 near Cap-Pele in the
southeastern part of New Brunswick, an eastern Canadian province.
   Some victims were pinned under the bales of hay. The driver of
the tractor-trailer had to be pried from the wreckage, witnesses
said.
   ``It's a terrible thing because everybody knows everybody around
here,'' said Cecile Cormier, an ambulance worker. ``They celebrate
every year, and I guess ... it was not the right time this year.''
   People on hayrides have been involved in several accidents in
recent years, but none has been as serious.
   In September 1984, four youths died during a hayride near
Bethel, Ontario. A car hit them while they were changing hay wagons.

<HEAD>New Housing Agreement Called An End To Painful Chapter In Race Relations</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   City and civil rights leaders lauded an
anti-discrimination housing settlement, but they disagreed on
Boston's progress in overcoming the racial strife that flared in
the mid-1970s with court-ordered busing.
   The settlement announced last week stemmed from a 1988 suit
filed by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored
People. It alleged that more than 2,000 minority families were
discouraged from applying for housing in predominantly white
developments or were denied such housing.
   The agreement provides up to $2,500 for families who were passed
over. It also affirms a housing plan adopted last year to give
priority to those who were discriminated against in tenant
selection.
   In addition, a ``community benefit'' fund, estimated at
$500,000, will supply grants to encourage integration and
multicultural activities in the city's public housing developments.
   NAACP officials said the settlement was a landmark agreement,
since those who suffered discrimination will receive financial
compensation.
   ``It was designed to show that if you do wrong, you're going to
pay for it,'' said Benjamin Hooks, the national executive director
of the NAACP.
   Mayor Raymond Flynn said the pact would end a painful era.
   ``This is the last barrier that remains that goes back to the
turbulent 1970s and '80s,'' Flynn said. ``Hopefully this will wipe
the slate clean and everyone will be on a level playing field for
housing.''
   But others said the legacy of Boston's racially troubled past,
when the city erupted in violence over school desegregation, was
still alive, just not as obvious.
   ``What you're having is fewer rocks being thrown and there
aren't demonstrations and rhetoric, but underneath it all there
still is the cause,'' said Mel King, a back leader and professor of
community development at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
   Hooks said the root cause for housing inequity ``is pure and
simple racism.''
   He added, ``I'd like to think there was a change of heart, but
that I don't know. But at least in Boston they're willing to uphold
the law.''
   Flynn said much of the housing problems can be blamed on the
failure to implement a policy adopted in 1978 that was intended to
provide open housing for minorities.
   Officials did not follow through on the policy, he said,
``because they could not ensure the safety of minorities moving
into neighborhoods.''
   Just four years earlier, the busing of black students into
predominantly white South Boston prompted protests, rock throwing
and the flight of white students to private schools.
   Dianne Wilkerson, head of the housing committee for the local
NAACP, agreed with city officials who said people's attitudes
toward racial issues seemed to have changed.
   She said under the remedial housing arrangement affirmed in the
settlement, blacks have been moving into predominantly white
housing projects since last year, and ``those people are living a
peaceful existence.''

   Members of a Latvian nationalist movement
have voted nearly unanimously to work to achieve not just autonomy
but outright independence from the Soviet Union.
   Delegates at the second annual congress of the People's Front of
Latvia, voted late Sunday to approve a program aimed at preparing
for independence _ though without specifying just when that might
come.
   There was only one vote against the 126-point program from the
1,074 delegates, who carefully discussed the nuances of each clause
in a debate that stretched into early today.
   The vice chairman of the Latvian state planning commission said
the independence call could create problems in negotiating more
economic freedom from the Kremlin.
   ``There is a direct link between the political situation and
economic negotiations,'' Janis Aboltins said. ``The more radical
the slogans, the more difficult it is for us the day after in the
corridors of power in Moscow.''
   However, Sunday's debate was fairly free of the fiery rhetoric
that would upset Moscow bureaucrats, he said.
   The program calls for human rights, competing political parties
and private business in a free-market economy. It is designed to
build an independent economy and social structure before the
republic secedes.
   On the autonomy clause, the delegates approved a declaration
saying the front's goal ``is to restore the independence of the
Latvian state by creating a democratic parliamentary republic.''
   ``Latvia's social and political life has changed radically,''
the draft said. ``The possibility actually exists that an
independent Latvia can be renewed through non-violent means.''
   The Soviet Union annexed Latvia and its Baltic neighbors
Lithuania and Estonia in 1940. In the past year, movements for
autonomy have gained strength in all three republics, which have
adopted measures calling for greater freedom from the Kremlin.
   Latvia's Parliament has voted itself the right to veto Soviet
laws, made Latvian the official language and restored schools for
ethnic minorities.
   The People's Front has gained the support of a leading
Communist, Latvian Premier Vilnis-Edvins Bresis.
   He told the congress it should strive for ``real power for the
people, with the fate of our native Latvia determined and governed
by the Latvian people.''
   Bresis said he believed the republic's most urgent task is
wresting control of the Latvian economy from Moscow. He did not
explicitly back independence.
   He also warned that Latvia's reforms must not move too far ahead
of countrywide efforts to overhaul the economy and political
system, championed by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   The People's Front claims 300,000 members among the Baltic
republic's 2.7 million people.
   Its program was carefully worded to ensure wide support.
   The congress dropped a direct complaint about the Communist
Party and wording that could have been interpreted as a threat to
voting rights of Russian and other non-Latvian immigrants, who
comprise half of the population.

<HEAD>Jewish Students Attacked By Gang in Brooklyn</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A gang of youths shouthing ethnic slurs set upon
three young Jewish men emerging from a party at a Jewish student
center and beat them severely, leaving two in serious condition,
authorities said.
   The police department's bias unit was investigating the
incident, which took place on the eve of the solemn Jewish holiday
of Yom Kippur, said Sgt. Diane Kubler, a police spokesman.
   The attack prompted an immediate outcry from community leaders.
   ``They came out of a fraternity party and were set upon by about
15 white youths who called them names and then beat the daylights
out of them,'' said city Councilman Noach Dear of Brooklyn.
   ``They were beating up anybody who wasn't of their kind,'' he
said.
   Two Brooklyn College freshmen were beaten just after midnight
Saturday when they emerged from a party at the Hillel House Jewish
student center near the college campus, Kubler SAID. A third man
was beaten when he came upon the gang and told them to stop, Dear
said.
   Dear identified the two students as Joshua Fogel and Steven
Weisburg, both freshmen at the college.
   Mayor Edward I. Koch and Dear visited the students at Kings
County Hospital. Dear said Fogel had a fractured skull and Weisburg
had a ruptured spleen, which was removed, a broken leg and injuries
to one of his knees.
   Police said Weisburg was listed in serious condition. Fogel was
in stable condition. The third victim, Steve Eilat, did not need to
be admitted to the hospital, police said.
   Yom Kippur, the day of atonement for Jews, started at sunset
Sunday.
   Dear said the young men had been told recently by their parents
not to wear their yarmulkes, or religious skullcaps, late at night
because of the possibility of attacks.
   ``It's unbelievable. We're living in a society where you have to
hide your religious beliefs,'' Dear said. ``That reminds me of Nazi
Germany. If I have to hide who I am, this is a terrible society.''
   ``I knew I wasn't supposed to wear the yarmulke, but I thought:
Why not? I'm going to Hillel House, that's my home territory,''
Weisburg said.

<HEAD>Jane's Says Soviet Tanks Have Edge on West</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New weapons and equipment have given the Soviet
Union an edge in tank forces that has allowed it to withdraw
thousands of older tanks from the front line facing NATO, a new
study said today.
   The Soviets no longer need so many tanks because their latest
models are superior in some cases to those of the West in armor,
mobility and firepower said Christopher F. Foss, editor of the
1989-1990 edition of the respected ``Jane's Armor and Artillery.''
   Foss wrote in his foreword to the volume describing the world's
armored vehicles and towed guns that the past year was dominated by
the Soviet decision to withdraw some of its conventional forces
from Eastern Europe without waiting for similar concessions from
NATO.
   He said that what many observers failed to realize was that the
quality of Soviet tanks had become superior.
   ``The introduction of the T-64, T-72 and T-80 main battle tanks
gave the Soviet Union a quantum leap in that they introduced new
tanks with significant improvements in armor, mobility and
firepower over their earlier T-54, T-55 and T-62 tanks,'' Foss said.
   No NATO main battle tank has automatic gun-loading, which all
three new Soviet tanks have, enabling them to carry as few as three
crewmen, the editor said.
   Fire control systems for armored fighting vehicles throughout
the Warsaw Pact have also been improved with a laser rangefinder
replacing optical systems to give gunners a greater chance of
hitting a target on the first shot, he said.
   New armor on Soviet tanks ``has made the vehicles virtually
immune'' to penetration by shells from any NATO tank, Foss said.
   ``The Soviet tank fleet consists of well over 50,000 vehicles of
some five basic types excluding heavy tanks and World War II
vehicles still held in reserve,'' the editor said.

   Most workers who take up an offer of early
retirement from their bosses are happy with their decisions,
according to a new study.
   ``The bottom line of early retirement is that if you're in good
health and have enough financial resources to keep you going,
you're likely to be happy in retirement,'' said Thomas Blank,
associate professor of human development and family relations at
the University of Connecticut.
   Blank and two researchers at Lehigh University in Pennsylvania _
Robert Williamson, a professor of social relations, and Alice
Rinehart, a professor of education _ surveyed 115 recent retirees.
   They had planned to study the problems people had when they took
early retirement _ like alcoholism, depression and boredom _ but
say they had trouble finding anybody who was miserable.
   Fifty percent of those surveyed were very satisfied in
retirement, while 15 percent were dissatisfied. The rest were as
happy as when they held their job.
   The unhappy retirees tended to feel they'd been forced out by an
employer who no longer wanted them, Blank said in a recent
interview.
   The researchers advertised in a Bethlehem, Pa., newspaper for
recent retirees to participate in the survey, and collected data
for three years, from 1986 to 1988. They are continuing to analyze
data and looking for a publisher.
   Ironically, Williamson and Rinehart have retired since the study
began.
   Respondents said the thing they missed most about work was
feeling useful and having a sense of responsibility.
   But Blank said most respondents found other channels for those
needs. About half do volunteer work and 40 percent work part-time,
many as consultants for their former employers.
   The average age of those surveyed was 59. Seventy percent had
planned to retire between the ages of 60 and 65. Most had worked
for the same employer for the last 25 to 30 years in jobs ranging
from high-level managers to administrative assistants.
   Corporations started using early retirement as a way to save
money in the late 1970s and early 1980s when they discovered they
were top-heavy with managers earning hefty salaries, Blank said.
   Since then, a number of states have followed the private
sector's lead.
   Walt McGowan, 62, spent more than two decades in the University
of Connecticut's public relations office. He thought he'd retire at
age 65.
   But the state, struggling to help close an $800 million budget
gap, made McGowan and other workers an offer: If they opted for
early retirement, they'd receive a bonus and medical benefits.
   ``I thought putting all these things together would probably be
to my benefit and to my family's benefit,'' said McGowan, who has
made two picnic tables, redone a bathroom, refinished some
furniture and written long-overdue thank-you notes in the month
since he left work.
   ``I did it _ I left Sept. 1, and I love it,'' he said.

   Police were searching for vandals who
left behind a trail of anti-Semitic and racist graffiti through
several miles of this suburban town.
   ``It's rather sad this could happen in 1989 in a town where we
like to think everyone gets along,'' said Detective Jim Fitzgerald.
   The vandalism occurred late Saturday or early Sunday, the eve of
Yom Kippur, the Jewish Day of Atonement.
   Officer Joseph Collari said vandals spray-painted swastikas and
racial slurs on a downtown building, mailboxes, garages, homes and
cars across a two-to-three-mile stretch of this town west of Boston.
   ``We've had probably 40 to 50 separate complaints come in on
this already,'' Collari said.
   Investigators photographed the graffiti and interviewed
residents Sunday, but had no suspects.

<HEAD>Dispute Looms at Conference on Antarctica's Future</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Atop the agenda for officials from 39 countries
gathered to map Antarctica's future is the question of whether to
leave the vast continent in pristine splendor or mine it for
mineral wealth.
   The biennial review of the 1959 Antarctica Treaty, which opens
today, will also consider issues such as the disposal of hazardous
wastes and controlling the wave of tourists visiting the continent.
   But the question of whether to allow mining on the frozen
continent is expected to be the most vigorously debated.
   Australia and France, whose policies have changed to reflect
growing public concern for the environment, are pitted in the
dispute against countries such as the United States and Japan that
generally favor regulated exploitation.
   In the past 15 months, Australia and France have reversed their
positions on an international convention reached in Wellington, New
Zealand, that would open Antarctica to carefully regulated mining.
Thirty-three of the 39 nations adhering to the Antarctica Treaty
initialed the accord in June 1988.
   ``Mining in Antarctica is not compatible with protection of the
fragile Antarctic environment,'' Premier Michel Rocard of France
and Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke said in a joint statement
issued Aug. 18.
   Because the Wellington Convention required unanimous agreement,
their decision torpedoed the accord for the foreseeable future.
   The decision by France, a country not known for its
environmental policies, was a surprise to many diplomats. But,
French officials said, President Francois Mitterrand has realized
that environmental problems such as global warming and the thinning
of the earth's ozone shield require a global response.
   ``The mounting concern about the environment is indisputable,''
one Foreign Ministry official said in a background briefing. ``We
feel it here in France and our partners undoubtedly feel it as
well.''
   Some countries, such as the United States, fear the collapse of
the Wellington Convention will weaken the good will among nations
that has kept the continent at the foot of the world a place of
peace and scientific cooperation.
   A voluntary moratorium on mineral exploitation remains in place,
and few diplomats said they were worried about a rush to dig and
drill in the absence of the convention.
   To fill the legal void, Australia and France have proposed that
Antarctica be declared a ``wilderness park'' where mining would be
prohibited and other human activity carefully controlled.
   This ambitious proposal, which was to be debated in the
corridors during the 10-day Paris meeting, has the support of
Belgium and India, Australian diplomats said. Italy also has voted
to not sign the minerals convention.
   The U.S. position is shared by New Zealand, Chile and Japan,
which is heavily dependent on foreign oil imports. These countries
say the stringent controls in the mining convention assure the
protection of wildlife, habitat and marine resources.
   ``This agreement establishes environmental principles which are
very important,'' said the State Department's Tucker Scully, head
of the U.S. delegation.
   Besides, he said, ``The U.S. is not a single-interest
constituency. There are economic interests who say, `We are not
interested in mining now, but we cannot exclude the possibility.'
These interests are politically significant.''
   Scully said that deciding Antarctica's future ``on the basis of
emotions rather than facts is a bad precedent.''
   But, environmentalists say, the U.S. position may be in flux.
They point to a resolution introduced last week by Sen. Albert
Gore, D-Tenn., to prevent ratification of the minerals accord.
   ``Congress is responding to a shift in American attitudes'' on
the environment, said James Barnes, director of the Antarctic and
Southern Oceans Coalition. ``I'd say the administration is out of
touch.''
   The U.S. attitude toward development in the Antarctic may be
influenced by the recent oil spill in Alaska that fouled the
state's pristine coastline. Nearly 11 million gallons of oil
spilled from the Exxon Valdez after it ran aground on a reef March
24 shortly after the tanker pulled out of the harbor at Valdez,
Alaska, the southern terminal of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline.
   The United States hopes Australia and France will change their
position on mining in Antarctica. But the two countries have their
own plans.
   ``We will go slowly,'' Rocard told the French news magazine
L'Express in August. ``These ideas have to incubate a little while
for there to be a meeting of the minds.''

<TEXT>
   Two Burmese students who hijacked an
aircraft to demand democracy in their military-ruled country will
be tried in Thailand and not sent back to their homeland, a senior
Thai official said today.
   Deputy Prime Minister Tienchai Sirisunpan told a news conference
that while they faced a maximum penalty of death he expected the
two students, who hijacked a domestic Burmese flight on Friday,
would be dealt with leniently.
   ``We will not send them back to Burma,'' said Tienchai who
persuaded the hijackers to give up peacefully after they diverted
the plane to Thailand, where the 83 people they had held hostage
were released unharmed after more than 10 hours of negotiations.
   Tienchai said the students _ identified as Ye Tin, 21, and Ye
Thi Ha, 25 _ could not request political asylum in Thailand or any
other country until after legal proceedings against them are
completed.
   The students, who initially threatened to blow up the plane with
a homemade explosive, demanded a return of democracy to Burma and
the freeing of all political prisoners.
   Tienchai said the Anti-Terrorist Committee he heads was ``very
sympathetic'' to the two students but added that ``we can't ignore
what they have done.''
   He said the two have been charged with criminal acts related to
hijacking under both Thai law and three international conventions
which Thailand has signed. The deputy prime minster said they would
be handed over by the Thai navy to police in Sattahip on Tuesday.
   Sattahip, located southeast of Bangkok, is near a
navy-controlled air base to which the hijacked plane was flown. The
plane has since returned to Burma.
   A Burmese student rebel group said today that they had received
a letter from the Democratic Fighting Force of Burma, which claimed
responsibility for the hijacking and asked the group to support the
two student hijackers.
   The All Burma Students Democratic Front said it received the
letter on Saturday. The front said the Democratic Fighting Force of
Burma was founded in Rangoon in April but that but little else was
known about it.
   The Front is the major representative of students who fled the
Burmese interior to fight for democracy from camps along the
country's borders.
   It has denied involvement in the hijacking but expressed
sympathy with the hijackers' aims.
   A massive, pro-democracy uprising in Burma was brutally crushed
in September 1988 following months of demonstrations and violence.
A military junta wields martial law in the country today and has in
recent months arrested several thousand dissidents, according to
Western diplomats in Rangoon.

<HEAD>Azerbaijan Rail Strike Reported Despite Ban on Stoppages</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defying a nationwide ban on transport strikes,
Azerbaijani railroad crews stopped desperately needed supplies from
reaching rival Armenia in the latest episode of a dispute over
territory both republics claim.
   Azerbaijani activist Shahin Gadzhiev said,``Our drivers are
striking and demanding guarantees of their safety,'' in response to
gunfire and stoning attacks on trains late Saturday in Armenia.
   About 400 trains with a total of 60,000 cars have been reported
idled on main lines in the southwestern region. There were
conflicting reports over how much food, fuel and building supplies
managed to reach the Armenian republic.
   The republics are feuding over Nagorno-Karabakh, a fertile
predominantly Armenian enclave that has been part of
Moslem-dominated Azerbaijan since 1923.
   Ethnic feuding over the region in the past 19 months has left
117 people dead, thousands injured and more than 2,000 homes and
apartments destroyed, the official news agency Tass said Sunday.
   On Tuesday, the Soviet legislature imposed a temporary ban on
strikes in key sectors such as transportation and energy. The move
followed a warning from President Mikhail S. Gorbachev that
stoppages could ruin the economy and lead to anarchy.
   Lawmakers also ordered security forces to restore rail traffic
between the feuding Caucasus republics. Troops moved in to protect
the trains, and Soviet media said Friday that the two-month
blockade that crippled Armenia was over. Members of the Azerbaijani
People's Front denied that train traffic was halted Sunday.
   ``The trains are running, but the attacks on them are also
continuing,'' Adel Mamedov said in an interview from the
Azerbaijani capital of Baku.
   But Tass reported late Sunday that 37 trains were dispatched
from Azerbaijan to Armenia over the past day and a half, and
``extremist forces are still hindering the normal functioning of
the route.''
   In the Nagorno-Karabakh region, five people were wounded in
clashes, Tass reported Sunday.
   ``Mutual hostility blinds the participants of the conflict with
dark malice and suppresses their reason,'' Tass said.
   Airlifts ``are the only thing preventing mass starvation'' in
Nagorno-Karabakh, which has a predominantly Armenian population of
about 160,000, Tass said.
   Ungathered grape crops rot in the fields, there are armed
attacks against villages, and ambulances don't have enough
gasoline, Tass said.
   Meanwhile, a highway bridge on the outskirts of
Nagorno-Karabakh's capital, Stepanakert, was blown up early
Saturday, the agency said.
   Armenian activist Rafael Popoyan said Sunday that Armenia still
faced food and fuel shortages. He said the few shipments making it
through to Armenia were sabotaged and contained either damaged
materials or cisterns filled with water instead of fuel.
   ``Everything that arrived is no good,'' he said in an interview
from the Armenian capital of Yerevan. ``That the blockade was
stopped at all is a myth.''
   About 80 percent of Armenian rail traffic runs through
Azerbaijan.
   The Azerbaijani blockade has virtually halted reconstruction
work on Armenian areas destroyed by a massive earthquake in
December that left 25,000 dead.
   Gadzhiev accused Armenians of plotting their own blockades on
Azerbaijan.
   He said Saturday's bridge explosion in Nagorno-Karabakh was
aimed at a nearby Azerbaijani village.
   The power supply to part of Azerbaijan also has been interrupted
by unrest in Nagorno-Karabakh, Gadzhiev said from the Azerbaijani
capital of Baku.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The FBI hopes to recruit spies and lure
defectors with advertisements it has placed in a Russian-language
newspaper in the United States.
   The FBI has begun running daily ads in Novoye Russkoye Slovo, or
New Russian Word, asking readers to tell the bureau what they know
about Soviet spies operating here and abroad, The New York Times
reported today.
   ``Replies will be kept in the strictest confidence,'' the ad
states.
   The FBI has received six calls since the first ad ran Friday but
would not disclose what the callers said, the Times said.
   James Fox, director of the New York FBI office, told the Times
the ad is designed to capitalize on the influx of about 150,000
Soviet emigres since 1975. About 50,000 emigres settled in the New
York area.
   The American intelligence community has always presumed that the
Soviet Union smuggled in agents along with the emigres, and the
newspaper ads are aimed at catching those spies, according to the
Times.
   FBI officials also want to collect information about Soviet
criminal gangs that operate in the emigre community, especially in
the Brighton Beach section of Brooklyn, the Times said.
   The ads, which are costing the FBI $300 a day, are scheduled to
run daily for two weeks and then appear intermittently, the FBI
told the paper.
   The Russian-language newspaper, published in New York, has a
circulation of more than 50,000 nationwide, largely in emigre
communities.

   East German authorities tried and sentenced to
jail many of the hundreds of protesters arrested during weekend
anti-government demonstrations in a half-dozen cities, West German
television said today.
   Meanwhile, East Germany began letting Western tourists back into
East Berlin after keeping them out since Thursday during ceremonies
marking the state's 40th anniversary, West Berlin officials said.
   On Sunday, riot police used clubs and dogs to attack thousands
of demonstrators rallying for democratic reform outside an East
Berlin church in a second day of protests against their Communist
government's intransigence.
   The peaceful protesters shouted ``We want freedom'' and ``No
violence,'' as security forces broke up a sit-in after a vigil at
the Protestant Gethsemane Church, beating demonstrators and chasing
them into side streets.
   Police seized between 30 and 100 people, according to Hessische
Rundfunk radio in Frankfurt. Several people were injured.
   The latest arrests came after hundreds were detained in protests
Saturday in East Berlin, Leipzig, Dresden, Jena, Potsdam and
Plauen. Some estimates put the number arrested at more than 1,000
in East Berlin alone.
   ``Many of those arrested have been given summary trials and
sentenced to prison terms of up to six months,'' West Germany's ARD
television said today. It did not give a more precise estimate.
   ARD said demonstrations had also occurred in Karl-Marx Stadt.
   East German officials gave no reports of arrests or injuries.
   As it marks its 40th anniversary, East Germany is in the throes
of the most serious street demonstrations since Soviet tanks and
troops put down a workers' revolt in 1953.
   This time, however, the demonstrators are looking to the Soviet
Union as a model of liberal reform.
   On Sunday, West German television showed Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev saying that many East Germans have ``strong
sympathy'' for his liberalizing of the Soviet political system and
economy.
   He said democratic changes in the Communist world were the main
topic of his talks Saturday with East Germany's 77-year-old
hard-line leader, Erich Honecker. Gorbachev returned to Moscow
Saturday after spending two days in East Berling for anniversary
celebrations.
   Sunday night's violence in East Berlin began when riot police
beat protesters as they left the Church, where about 5,000 people
had gathered for a vigil.
   After negotiations between church officials and police, most
protesters left, but some joined 2,000 others who were staging a
sit-in nearby on Schoenhauser Allee street.
   Police used clubs and trucks with steel-mesh barriers welded to
the front to chase the protesters into side streets, witnesses said.
   One man who watched the violence from his apartment window said,
``It's getting worse and worse. Someday soon, rocks and Molotov
cocktails are going to fly.''
   East Germany's official ADN news agency accused Western news
media of aiding the weekend protests, calling the demonstrators
``troublemakers.''
   Authorities refused to renew the visas of dozens of Western
journalists who were in East Berlin for the anniversary
festivities. Reporters were told to leave the city when their visas
expired at midnight Sunday.
   West Germany's ZDF television network on Sunday showed an
interview that Gorbachev apparently gave Soviet television
immediately after his meeting with Honecker.
   ``After many talks I have the impression that the German
Democratic Republic's citizens, the veterans, the middle-aged and
especially the young, have strong sympathy for our perestroika
policy,'' he said referring to the Soviet Union's reform program.
``These are fiery fans, there is strong support.''
   East Germans are considering ``what to change and improve, not
only in the economy and in social respects, but also in the
political and societal institutions,'' Gorbachev was quoted as
saying.
   Gorbachev's reform policies have made him popular among many
East Germans. Protesters chanted his name and called for his
support during his visit.
   The anniversary celebrations were to illustrate the success of
Communism in East Germany, which despite being a tightly controlled
society is in better economic shape than its East bloc partners.
   Instead, world attention focused on the protests, which were in
part stirred by an exodus of about 50,000 disgruntled East Germans
through Czechoslovakia, Poland and Hungary since Sept. 10, when
Budapest opened its border with Austria.
   Despite the growing unrest and exodus to the West, Honecker
reportedly told Gorbachev he would stick to his conservative course.
   Hundreds of injuries were reported as police swinging truncheons
repeatedly charged demonstrators in the capital Saturday and early
Sunday.
   Police punched, kicked, beat and dragged away the protesters,
roughing up Western journalists as well. At least two Western
reporters were detained in separate incidents for six hours.
   Also Sunday, activists demanding reform said they had formed a
Social Democratic Party to promote a ``rigorous democratization of
state and society.'' The party's charter was signed by 43 people in
Schwante, near Berlin.
   The Communist government recently banned a prominent reform
group, New Forum. The group says its membership has grown from the
original 30 members to more than 11,000.

   While most Michigan residents enjoy the
turning of the fall colors, people in Monroe hold their noses as
the ginkgo tree turns rank.
   The ginkgo dates back 200 million years to the era of dinosaurs.
And, residents say, every fall it smells like it.
   ``It smells just like a baby's dirty pants. Really!'' said Marie
McNairn, a member of the Friends of Dorsch Library. ``I smelled it
for years.''
   Since 1865, a ginkgo has been standing in front of the Dorsch
library in this town 30 miles southwest of Detroit.
   The female tree, which originates from eastern China, bears an
edible fruit whose hull emits a strong odor into the fall air.
   Monroe's annual Ginkgo Mania festival, which began last week,
includes a contest to determine what day the Dorsch tree's leaves
will fall. Ginkgoes shed their leaves in a matter of hours.
   Robert Peven, a Monroe County Planning Department employee by
day but a ginkgo maniac by night, tried to write a poem about the
ginkgo but gave up after realizing the only rhyming word is stinko.
   Instead, he found a passage in a Japanese poetry anthology and
read it at a meeting of the Dorsch Friends Club:
   ``Treading the fallen leaves of the ginkgo tree, the boy comes
down the mount.''
   Maxine Lahti, one of 18 in attendance, concluded: ``There's just
so much that can be said about a ginkgo tree!''

   With Rickey Henderson running the show, the
Oakland Athletics are returning to baseball's World Series for the
second year in a row.
   The A's beat the Toronto Blue Jays, 4-3, Sunday to win the
American League playoffs in five games.
   Henderson, who began his career with the Athletics and was
traded back to his hometown by the New York Yankees in June, made
the playoff series his personal showcase and was named Most
Valuable Player.
   He reached base in 14 of 23 plate appearances and stole a
postseason series record eight bases. He also hit two home runs, a
triple, a double and scored eight times.
   ``I can't say I surprised myself,'' said Henderson, not known
for his modesty.
   In Sunday's game, Dave Stewart outpitched Dave Stieb for the
second time in the playoffs. That made Oakland became the first
team to win consecutive pennants since the Yankees and Los Angeles
each did it in 1977-78.
   The Athletics will open the World Series at home next Saturday
against San Francisco or Chicago. The Giants beat the Cubs 6-4
Sunday to take a 3-1 lead in the National League playoffs. Game 5
is scheduled for this afternoon.
   If the Giants win, it will set up a cross-bay series, the first
time in 33 years that a metropolitan area monopolized the World
Series. In 1956, the New York Yankees defeated the Brooklyn Dodgers.

<HEAD>Four Charged in Probe Linked With Assassination of IRA Members</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police investigating security
leaks arrested 28 members of the army's Ulster Defense Regiment in
raids on their homes and four were charged with unspecified
firearms offenses.
   The soldiers allegedly leaked files identifying IRA members some
of whom were targeted for assassination by Protestant extremists,
police said.
   Some of those detained in the raids early Sunday were later
released, and it was not clear whether others would be charged.
Police said they found security documents, ammunition and weapons
in the raids.
   The four charged with unspecified firearms offenses were to
appear in court today.
   The Ulster Defense Regiment is part of the British Army and
consists of soldiers who belong overwhelmingly to the Protestant
majority.
   The predominantly Roman Catholic IRA has killed 180 members of
the regiment in its fight to end British rule and unite Northern
Ireland with the Irish Republic.
   Members of the regiment and police officers of the Royal Ulster
Constabulary allegedly colluded with outlawed Protestant groups by
giving them copies of lists of Irish Republican Army suspects.
   Loughlin Maginn, 28, a Catholic father of four who was on one of
the leaked lists, was assassinated Aug. 25 and two members of the
regiment have been charged in his slaying. The killing was claimed
by the Ulster Freedom Fighters, an outlawed Protestant group, which
claimed Maginn was in the IRA.
   Sunday's arrests came after an inquiry by John Stevens, a
regional police chief brought in from England. His probe was
triggered by the Ulster Freedom Fighters giving security details of
Maginn and other persons to the press.
   A British soldier, brought from his base in Dortmund, West
Germany, has already been charged with leaking information.
   Early today, a man was killed by a gunman who pulled up
alongside him in a car and shot him at point-blank range, police
said. The man, whose name was released, was shot in County
Londonderry, the Royal Ulster Constabulary said.
   The victim had no connection with the security forces in
Northern Ireland, said a police spokesman on condition of anonymity.
   In another development, police said they foiled a planned
breakout of IRA prisoners from Belfast's Crumlin Road jail on
Saturday night. They said four pounds of plastic explosives were
found at the prison and a 500-pound bomb was defused on a
construction site outside the facility.
   Rioting in Belfast Saturday night appeared designed to keep
officers busy while the escape proceeded, police said. They said
seven stolen cars were left at the prison with ignition keys inside.
   Brendan Curren, a councilman for Sinn Fein, the legal political
wing of the IRA, was shot and wounded by unidentified gunmen Sunday
night in Lurgan, 20 miles southwest of Belfast.
   Earlier Sunday, police superintendent Alwyn Harris, 51, was
killed by a bomb when he started his car in Lisburn, 10 miles west
of Belfast. No group claimed responsibility.
   The killings brought the Northern Ireland death toll since the
first killings in 1969 to 2,759, according to police count. The
dead include 264 police officers, 597 British Army and Ulster
Defense Regiment and 1,899 civilians.

<HEAD>Fiery Crash 15th This Year For Indian Air Force</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An air force jet plunged to earth and
exploded during an air show after the pilot apparently misjudged
his altitude and tried an extra maneuver. The flier was killed and
dozens of spectators were injured fleeing the fiery wreckage.
   The crash Sunday was the 15th this year for the Indian air
force, which has the world's highest accident rate, defense
statistics show.
   The Mirage 2000 fighter jet crashed at Indian Air Force Day
celebrations. The pilot, Ramesh Bakshi, the 39-year-old commander
of the Mirage squadron, was killed instantly.
   Dozens of panicked spectators suffered sprained ankles, bruises
or broken bones while running toward or away from the giant
fireball.
   Four people were hospitalized in serious condition with burns
over 50 percent of their bodies, military officials said.
   The silver delta-winged aircraft was completing a stunt known as
a ``Vertical Charlie,'' the finale of a 20-minute display of the
air force's supersonic fighters, transport and training aircraft.
   Air Marshal N.C. Suri, vice chief of the air staff, said Bakshi
was only scheduled to perform three rolls but instead attempted a
fourth.
   Unable to complete the roll and pull out of its rapid descent,
the plane hurtled to the ground as 2,000 military and civilian
dignitaries and other guests attending the 57th anniversary watched
in horror, only 300 yards away.
   The plane slammed into the ground and exploded, igniting a huge
fireball as the wreckage bounced through fuel tanks on the ground.
Chunks of burning debris hit several vehicles in the parking lot of
the military section of Palam Airport in western New Delhi.
   Suri said the pilot may have miscalculated his height because
the sky was hazy. When Bakshi started to pull up, the plane was
about 18 feet from the ground, they said.
   In 1987-88 alone, officials reported 46 crashes of Indian air
force jets, most involving the Soviet-made MiG-21 or MiG-27.
Defense officials said that averages 2.4 crashes per 10,000 flying
hours.
   Neighboring Pakistan had a 1.2 average, Britain 0.8 and the
United States 0.65 in the same period, the statistics showed.
   The Mirage is capable of flying up to 1,460 mph hour at an
altitude of 65,600 feet.

<TEXT>
   Americans J. Michael Bishop and Harold
E. Varmus won the Nobel Prize in medicine today for their discovery
of a family of genes that has helped scientists understand how
cancer develops.
   Bishop, 53, and Varmus, 49, work in the Department of
Microbiology and Immunology at the University of California School
of Medicine in San Francisco.
   ``I was stunned,'' said Bishop, who lives in Belvedere, outside
San Francisco.
   Varmus said he was sleeping when he heard the news on the radio.
``I didn't know if it was a false alarm or they got my name
confused, not having talked to anyone directly,'' he said from his
home in San Francisco. ``As we say in science, I needed
confirmation of the information.''
   The 50-member Nobel Assembly of the Karolinska Institute,
Sweden's largest and oldest medical university, cited the
researchers ``for their discovery of the cellular origin of
retroviral oncogenes.''
   Their 1976 work on oncogenes, which control the division and
growth of cells, helped understand how malignant tumors develop,
the citation said.
   The discovery also ``widened our insight into the complicated
signal systems which govern the normal growth of cells,'' the
assembly said.
   Oncogenic virus was discovered as early as 1916, although it was
not known as such until nearly 50 years later.
   Bishop and Varmus ``published the remarkable conclusion that the
oncogene in the virus did not represent a true viral gene but
instead was a normal cellular gene, which the virus had acquired
during replication in the host cell and thereafter carried along,''
the citation said.
   Peter Reichard, chairman of the Nobel Assembly said, ``They have
clarified how cancer genes work.''
   ``The great importance of the discovery is that we have a
completely different view on how cancer can originate, and through
that we hope to be able to use this practically later on,'' he said.
   Varmus called the scientists' work a ``cornerstone in
understanding the genetic mosaic of cancer.''
   ``The basic idea that we helped establish is that cancer has its
origins in genes that normally do us some good. But after they
become abnormal through mutation, they cause a role in cancer.''
   He and Bishop will share a $469,000 cash prize.
   It was the third time the Nobel Prize has been awarded for
research in connection with this field of research. Peyton Rous was
first given the prize after his 1916 discovery of a tumor-inducing
virus, which was then called the Rous virus.
   In 1975, David Baltimore, Renato Dulbecco and Howard Temin were
awarded the prize for discovering the interaction between tumor
viruses and the genetic material of the cells.
   Bishop and Vermus were added to a long list of Americans who
have dominated the medicine prize over the last 20 years. They were
the 30th and 31st U.S. winners since 1969, compared with 19
laureates from all other countries combined.
   Bishop was born in York, Pa. on Feb. 22, 1936, studied at
Gettysburg College and Harvard and worked in the National
Institutes of Health outside Washington. He spent time in Hamburg,
West Germany before moving to the University of California in 1968.
   Varmus came from Oceanside, N.Y., where he was born Dec. 18,
1939. He studied at Amherst College in Massachusetts, and earned
his masters degree at Harvard in 1962, the same year Bishop earned
his medical degree at Harvard. Varmus received a doctorate from
Columbia University in 1966.
   Varmus also worked at the National Institutes of Health as a
clinical associate before becoming a postdoctoral fellow at the
California School of Medicine in 1970.
   The assembly of the Karolinska Institute never announces a list
of candidates for the prize, but officials say about 250 scientists
are considered each year. Many are nominated repeatedly.
   The medicine prize was the first of four Nobel awards being
announced this week. All are worth 3 million Swedish kronor, or
about $469,000. The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences will disclose
the economics prize winner Wednesday, and the laureates for
chemistry and physics Thursday.
   The date for the literature prize has not been announced.
   The Nobel Peace Prize was given Thursday to the Dalai Lama, the
exiled spiritual and political leader of Tibet, for his non-violent
struggle against China's rule of his Himalayan country.
   Last year's medicine prize went to Sir James. W. Black of Great
Britain, and to Americans Gertrude B. Elion and George H. Hitchings.
   They were cited for developing principles leading to new drugs
that have been applied against leukemia, AIDS, heart disease and
other lethal illnesses.
   The prizes were first awarded in 1901 from the estate of Alfred
Nobel, the inventor of dynamite.

   The following is the text of the
citation from the Nobel Assembly announcing the winners of the 1989
Nobel Prize in medicine.
   The Nobel Assembly at the Karolinska Institute has today decided
to award the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for 1989 jointly
to J. Michael Bishop and Harold E. Varmus for their discovery of
``The Cellular Origin of Retroviral Oncogenes.''
   The discovery awarded with this year's Nobel Prize in Physiology
or Medicine concerns the normal growth and division of cells.
Disturbances in one or some of these so-called oncogenes can lead
to transformation of a normal cell into a tumor cell and result in
cancer.
   Michael Bishop and Harold Varmus used an oncogenic retrovirus to
identify the growth-controlling oncogenes in normal cells. In 1976
they published the remarkable conclusion that the oncogene in the
virus did not represent a true viral gene but instead was a normal
cellular gene, which the virus had acquired during replication in
the host cell and thereafter carried along.
   Bishop's and Varmus' discovery of the cellular origin of
retroviral oncogenes has had an extensive influence on the
development of our knowledge about mechanisms for tumor
developement. Until now more than 40 different oncogenes have been
demonstrated. The discovery has also widened our insight into the
complicated signal systems which govern the normal growth of cells.

   Pope John Paul II began a visit to the
world's largest Moslem country today and said Indonesia's tiny
Roman Catholic minority seeks unity with all Indonesians.
   The pope's remarks came amid controversy over a scheduled stop
in East Timor, a predominantly Catholic Portuguese territory
annexed by Indonesia in 1976.
   The pope arrived after a weekend visit to Seoul, South Korea.
The pontiff knelt and kissed the tarmac, wet from a tropical
rainstorm, in the sticky 90 degree heat.
   Soldiers lined the 10-mile motorcade route from the military
airport to the palm tree-ringed presidential palace, where
Indonesia's pro-Western president, Suharto, greeted the pontiff.
There have been several reported threats on the life of the pope
from Moslem extremist groups.
   In a country made up of 13,766 islands and about 200 ethnic and
religious groups, Indonesian governments have stressed the need to
maintain unity.
   John Paul immediately sought to make clear that his visit posed
no threat to unity in this nation of 5 million Catholics and 157
million Moslems.
   During a Mass at a sports stadium, the pope said he came as ``a
friend of every Indonesian in our common humanity and our common
concern for the development and peace of the world in which we
live.''
   He expressed his ``cordial esteem'' to ``our Moslem brothers and
sisters, who are so numerous in this country.''
   ``I extend the hand of sincere and heartfelt friendship in our
common belief in the one God, our creator and merciful lord,'' the
pope said, speaking in English.
   John Paul said Catholic Indonesians were deeply proud of their
country.
   ``We must be fully Catholic and fully Indonesian,'' the pope
said. ``These words are deeply inscribed in the modern history of
the nation.''
   The stop in East Timor, scheduled for Thursday, has drawn
protests from Portugal, but John Paul has said the visit does not
imply Vatican recognition of Indonesia's annexation of the
territory.
   He said last week that skipping the territory would be an
``offense'' to East Timor's Catholics, nearly 80 percent of the
island's 690,000 people.
   The 69-year-old pontiff is to spend five days in Indonesia and
visit four cities in addition to the capital.
   During his two-day visit to South Korea, he encouraged people to
work toward unifying the Korean Peninsula.
   Korea was the first stop on the pope's 10-day Asian tour. He
also is to visit the Indian Ocean island nation of Mauritius before
returning to Rome on Oct. 16.

<TEXT>
   Police said today that two Red Cross
officials kidnapped last week are being held by radical Palestinian
guerrillas led by terrorist mastermind Abu Nidal.
   Nidal's group has denied taking part in the kidnappings.
   ``We have established that Abu Nidal's men carried out the
abduction. We believe the hostages are held in a base east of
Sidon,'' said a police spokesman, who cannot be identified under
standing regulations.
   He said the base was ``between the villages of Majdalyoun and
Bkosta,'' three miles east of Sidon, the provincial capital of
south Lebanon.
   ``The area is controlled exclusively by Abu Nidal's group,'' the
spokesman said.
   Masked gunmen grabbed the two Swiss men, Emmanuel Christen, 32,
and Elio Erriquez, 23, in Sidon on Friday, bundled them into the
trunk of a car and drove off toward the Ein el-Hilweh Palestinian
refugee camp on Sidon's southeastern outskirts.
   The police spokesman said the kidnappers drove through Ein
el-Hilweh to their base east of Sidon. Ein el-Hilweh is controlled
by Yasser Arafat's Palestine Liberation Organization, which is at
odds with Abu Nidals' breakaway faction.
   Asked whether police would attempt to rescue the hostages, the
spokesman said: ``We don't have the necessary force to do that. We
have investigators, but not a strike force.''
   Government and police authority power been severely eroded by 14
years of civil war between Christians and Moslems, leaving power
largely in the hands of militias.
   Asked about Abu Nidal's reported involvement in the abductions,
Roland Sidler, chief delegate of the International Committee of the
Red Cross in south Lebanon, said: ``We have no new information
about our missing colleagues.''
   Abu Nidal's Fatah-Revolutionary Council issued a statement in
Beirut Saturday condemning the abductions and offering to help free
the men, but police and the PLO have said they do not take the
denial seriously.
   Abu Nidal is the nom de guerre of Sabri al-Banna, who broke away
from Arafat's mainstream Fatah faction in 1973. His faction has
been blamed for a score of terrorist attacks, including the
December 1985 attacks on the Rome and Vienna airports.
   Friday's kidnapping prompted the Red Cross to close its
orthopedic center in Sidon, which provided artificial limbs for
civil war and car bomb victims.
   About 50 amputees in wheelchairs and on crutches, all of them
patients at the center, demonstrated outside the building Sunday,
condemning the abductions and demanding the release of Christen and
Erriquez.
   ``We had to close it because our two abducted comrades were the
backbone of the clinic's operations,'' Sidler said.
   PLO spokesmen last week accused Abu Nidal's group of the
kidnappings, linking them to a Shiite Moslem militant, Mohammed
Hariri, who is serving a life sentence in Switzerland for hijacking
an Air Afrique jetliner in 1987 and killing a French passenger.
   Hariri, 22, is reputed to be a member of the Iranian-backed
fundamentalist Hezbollah, or Party of God, which is believed to be
the umbrella for factions holding most of the 18 hostages in
Lebanon.
   Eight of the hostages are Americans. The hostage held longest is
Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press.
   Abu Nidal's group, which is bankrolled by Libya, has a record of
cooperation with Hezbollah.
   After U.S. warplanes bombed Libya's capital April 15, 1986, the
bodies of three Western hostages were found two days later near a
highway in the central Lebanese mountains east of Beirut.
   Beirut newspapers said at the time that the three victims, who
had been held by pro-Iranian militants loyal to Hezbollah, were
turned over to Abu Nidal's group to mete out vengeance for the U.S.
raid.

<HEAD>China Refuses to Accept Illegal Immigrants For First Time</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China for the first time has refused to accept
70 Chinese illegal immigrants being returned from Hong Kong, a
government spokesman said Monday.
   The immigrants were scheduled to be repatriated to the
neighboring Chinese province of Guandong on Sunday, but Chinese
officials refused to accept them at the border checkpoint,
according to the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   He said Hong Kong has begun talks with Chinese officials on the
issue.
   Hong Kong has been sending back all illegal immigrants from
China since 1980. Previously, only those caught at the border were
repatriated.
   More than 12,000 illegal immigrants were repatriated to China
this year, the spokesman said.
   On Wednesday, Beijing criticized Hong Kong for permitting
Chinese swimmer Yang Yang to leave for the United States after he
was released from a detention center under a discretionary section
of the immigration code. He had been arrested Sept. 23 for having
an expired visa.
   The swimmer had unsuccessfully sought political asylum in Hong
Kong, saying he feared Chinese authorities would jail him for
joining in pro-democracy marches in the colony.
   China's official Xinhua News Agency said Hong Kong had set a bad
precedent in the case. It said the action ``will surely adversely
relations between the two sides in other fields. Only the Hong Kong
government should be responsible for all the consequences.''
   Hong Kong reverts to Chinese rule in 1997, and China has
promised it will retain the territory's legal and capitalistic
systems for 50 years after the takeover. Confidence in the colony's
future suffered a setback when Chinese troops crushed a
pro-democracy movement in Beijing in June.

<TEXT>
   The United States spent $375 million
on civilian Pakistani development projects during fiscal 1989, a
U.S. official said Monday.
   The actual new allocation for the year was $265 million, but an
additional $108 million was used from funds Washington had
allocated earlier, said James A. Norris, director of the U.S. Aid
Mission to Pakistan.
   The money in fiscal 1989, which ended Sept. 30, went into
projects including health, population, education, energy and
agriculture, Norris said at a news conference.
   Pakistan is the third-largest recepient of U.S. economic aid
after Israel and Egypt.
   The money was part of a $4.02 billion total aid package the
United States is providing Pakistan over six years that will end in
fiscal 1993.
   Nearly half the total appropriated will go for military
equipment to update Pakistan's armed forces.

   French oceanographer Jacques Cousteau, famed for
his TV documentaries, sank half of a ``Today'' discussion on
Antarctic issues today by refusing to yield his seat to an American
guest awaiting his turn on the show.
   The incident occurred at NBC's facilities in Paris. Delegates of
39 nations are meeting in that city to discuss an Antarctic treaty.
Cousteau is part of the French delegation, which wants the
Antarctic made into a world park.
   Before his appearance, Cousteau, who opposes any Antarctic
development, refused to discuss the Antarctic issue on ``Today''
with R. Tucker Scully, head of the U.S. delegation to the
conference, NBC spokeswoman Peggy Hubble said. The U.S. delegation
favors regulated development of the region.
   However, she said, Cousteau had told NBC officials that he would
leave after his interview so that Scully, awaiting his turn in the
Paris studio, could be interviewed about the U.S. position on the
Antarctic.
   But after ``Today'' news anchor Deborah Norville concluded her
interview of more than two minutes with Cousteau, ``he wouldn't
leave,'' thus blocking Scully's scheduled appearance, Hubble said.
   Viewers didn't see Cousteau staying put. Nor did they see Scully
awaiting his turn.
   ``We're having a little difficulty getting Mr. Scully hooked up
there in Paris,'' Norville told viewers as the off-camera problem,
of which she also seemed unaware, began across the Atlantic.
   After a few seconds, she reported that ``we are having some
difficulty with our feed there in Paris, and we will not be able to
talk with Mr. Scully to get the United States' side.''
   ``Our apologies to him and our apologies to you for not being
able to give you the other side of that discussion. Our thanks,
though, to Capt. Cousteau in Paris.''
   Immediately after a station break, though, Norville was back on
the air, offering ``a little explanation as to how strong the
feelings run on this Antarctic issue. Capt. Cousteau refused to
move over so that we could talk to Mr. Scully, who was sitting
right there, waiting.''
   At that point, co-anchor Jane Pauley smiled and said,
``Deborah's feelings run strong, too.''
   Norville didn't say if Cousteau gave an explanation for his
action.
   Cousteau ``never said why he wasn't leaving,'' Hubble said later.

   Police are playing down speculation that
a serial killer is stalking Oakland's prostitutes, but the slayings
of six women in a little more than two months have spread fear on
the streets.
   ``We're all a little scared,'' said Renee Jackson, who said she
had worked Oakland's streets for 11 years, ``but not scared enough
'cause we're still out here.''
   Police Capt. Jim Hahn said it was too early to talk about a
serial killer, pointing out that about 10 prostitutes are killed in
Oakland each year.
   Still, he admits that six deaths in such a short time is
unusual, and the possibility of a single killer isn't being ruled
out.
   Six young women with police records for prostitution and drugs
have been killed, although there has been no clear pattern to the
deaths.
   One victim was hanged, two were beaten and three were shot.
Three were black, three white. Some of the bodies were naked, some
clothed.
   The naked body of the latest victim, 23-year-old Sharon F.
Frazier, was found hanging from a walnut tree in a neighborhood
park Thursday.
   Police are investigating the Sept. 20 death of a woman in
Brisbane, near San Francisco's Candlestick Park, to determine if it
is connected to the Oakland slayings, said Berry Lewis, a Brisbane
homicide investigator. The victim was a suspected prostitute, he
said.
   One prostitute said she had warned two of the victims about a
man who attacked her on Aug. 31. One of the women died Sept. 20,
and the other died five days later, about two blocks apart.
   The woman, who would not give her name, said she had been raped
and robbed by a customer who claimed he ``hated whores and that all
women are whores.''

<HEAD>Ceausescu Tours Bucharest Markets, Promises Better Food Supplies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Romanian leader Nicolae Ceausescu has
toured poorly stocked markets in Bucharest and promised better food
supplies, a news agency reported Monday.
   Agerpres said Ceausescu, whose unexpected visit of food outlets
in Romania's capital on Sunday came just a day after returning from
celebrations in East Germany, announced improvements in
government-sponsored food programs.
   There has been growing criticism of food shortages in Romania,
as well as recent unofficial calls for Ceausescu to step down.
   ``The programs of good supply to the population should be
extended and developed,'' the report said, without elaborating.
   Under Ceausescu's centralized economy, Romania _ once the
breadbasket of Eastern Europe _ has faced rationing of staples such
as meat, flour, cooking oil and bread, while fresh vegetables and
fruit have been hard to find even in spring and summer.
   Sugar has been rationed to 2.2 pounds per person per month and
cooking oil to one quart per person a month.
   Last month, the government announced that starting Oct. 1, oil
and sugar supplies would be augmented by 20 percent and 15 percent,
respectively.
   Most of Romania's farmland is owned by state collective farms
and only 10 percent is tilled privately in small plots or gardens
around farmers' houses.
   ``The visit and the analysis that followed disclosed the
steadfast preoccupation of the ... leadeship with the ... rhythmic
supply of ... markets ... to the planned extent and at an
appropriate level of quality,'' Agerpres said.
   Delegates to a Romanian Communist Party congress scheduled for
next month have been urged recently to denounce Ceausescu for
incompetence and oust him as party leader.
   Ceausescu, 71, was unanimously proposed by the party's
policy-setting Central Committee in the summer to be re-elected at
the Nov. 20-25 congress.
   Addressing a party meeting of economic experts last week, he
made clear that under his hard-line rule, Romania would never adopt
economic and political reforms under way in Hungary, Poland and the
Soviet Union.
   In an unusually harsh criticism, the government daily Romania
Libera blamed transportation problems, bad organization and
careless administration for the food shortages.
   ``A large crowd was waiting in line at the vegetables counter of
Titan market, although nothing was on sale,'' the newspaper said.
   Asked about the absence of fresh vegetables, market officials
said ``only 19 metric tons of potatoes were delivered out of the
planned 25 tons, while deliveries of carrots, eggplants and greens
remained only on paper.''
   ``Only once we received pears (from state-owned farms) this
summer,'' the officials told Romania Libera.
   ``After you tour 10-15 markets you can conclude that ...
distribution is wrongly done,'' it said.

<HEAD>Pan Am 747 Makes Emergency Landing After Engine Failure</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Pan American World Airways jumbo jet bound
from New York to Madrid made an emergency landing in Newfoundland,
Canada, after one of its four engines failed early today, airline
spokesmen said.
   Flight 156, a Boeing 747, landed at Gander, Newfoundland, about
3:20 a.m. EDT. No one was injured, but hotels were unavailable and
all but two of the 203 passengers spent the night at the terminal
or aboard the airplane.
   Those two chartered a private jet, while the others continued
their trip aboard a substitute 747 that left Gander at 10:30 a.m.,
said Alan Loflin, a spokesman for Pan Am.
   The original flight, with a crew of 17, left John F. Kennedy
International Airport about 9:50 p.m. Sunday. Near Gander ``they
experienced an engine vibration and a stall and the No. 1 engine
was shut down,'' said Elizabeth Manners, a Pan Am spokeswoman.
   While a 747 can fly on three of its four engines, normal
procedure in such cases is to land at the nearest airport. The
pilot declared ``a routine, precautionary emergency'' to gain
priority to land at Gander, Loflin said.
   The plane descended from about 33,000 feet in what Loflin called
``a deliberate descent'' but not a disruptive one. The plane landed
safely and passengers departed by portable stairs, he said.

<TEXT>
   The failed Panamanian coup last week is
forcing U.S. policy-makers to reexamine the restraint that has kept
the United States from intervening more forcefully in smaller
nations.
   For 15 years, concern about becoming bogged down in ``another
Vietnam'' has influenced U.S. leaders' decisions about intervention.
   And President Bush's decision not to openly assist the attempted
coup against Panamanian Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega showed he was
not prepared to risk U.S. lives and prestige in a military
operation that had neither clear public support nor a clear chance
of success.
   Still, Bush's predecessor, President Reagan, armed
anti-Communist guerrillas in Nicaragua and other nations where
leftist governments had come to power following the U.S. withdrawal
from Southeast Asia.
   While members of Congress have welcomed diminished Bush
administration support for Nicaraguan guerrillas, the confused U.S.
response in Panama brought calls from Capitol Hill _ from both
Democrats and Republicans _ for Bush to be bolder.
   ``Failure is the father of about 100 hawks on Capitol Hill now.
Suddenly, everyone is fluttering around the Senate and the House,
saying, `let's use military force,''' said Sen. William Cohen,
R-Maine, a Bush supporter.
   ``I find it ironic that many of the same people who have imposed
some restrictions on the administration by deed or word, suddenly
now want to use American force,'' Cohen said on the ABC-TV program,
``This Week with David Brinkley.''
   ``I think it is an opportunity for all of us to finally lay it
out: Do the American people by virtue of the Congress, really
support the use of force to take out Noriega either overtly or
covertly? We've got to know that,'' said Cohen, the vice chairman
of the Senate Intelligence Committee.
   Another Republican, Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., however,
called the administration's handling of the coup ``an incredible
stain on us'' and said White House statements were a ``weak-kneed
explanation for failure.''
   And Democratic Sen. David Boren of Oklahoma, chairman of the
Intelligence Committee, said, ``I don't think it's right for this
country, for a great country, to go out and encourage people to
take action, put their lives on the line, to imply by encouraging
them to take that action that we're going to help them, and not be
there.''
   A poll released by Newsweek magazine over the weekend showed
support for Bush's approach. While 60 percent of those polled
thought it ``very important ... to the United States that General
Noriega give up power in Panama,'' 45 percent said U.S. involvement
was ``just about right.'' Thirty percent said America played ``not
enough'' of a role in the coup attempt and 9 percent said ``too
much.''
   The poll of 750 people, conducted last Thursday and Friday, had
a 4 percent margin of error.
   The issue is broader than whether the United States should use
force against Noriega, say administration officials as well as
lawmakers who criticized Bush.
   Should the United States intervene militarily in other nations
after the Kremlin withdrew its army from Afghanistan and signaled
that it would not block democratic moves under way in such Soviet
bloc countries as Poland or Hungary?
   Or, as formulated by one of Bush's most outspoken critics, Sen.
Sam Nunn, D-Ga., what would U.S. allies think if the administration
had used troops from American military bases in Panama to topple
Noriega?
   ``International considerations come into play here. We can't
have ... tunnel vision on Panama,'' said Nunn, the chairman of the
Senate Armed Services Committee.
   ``We cannot ignore the repercussions,'' of using a U.S. base for
aiding or launching a coup, said Nunn, referring to lease renewal
negotiations for two key American military installations in the
Philippines.
   ``What we do in countries where we have bases has a direct
bearing'' on such negotiations, Nunn said last week.
   The disclosure on Sunday that Bush aides had been laying plans
for covert action to grab Noriega during the coup clouded the U.S.
position.
   The administration, said Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, ``has
not ruled out the use of military force'' against Noriega.
   But U.S. involvement in a coup against Noriega would set off
alarm bells all over Latin America, including among American allies
in the war on drugs, Cheney said on the CBS-TV program, ``Face the
Nation.''
   ``If you are actively involved and using U.S. military force to
topple governments of Latin America, you're going to have a lot of
trouble getting the Colombians and Peruvians and Bolivians and
others to agree to have military training teams, for example,''
said Cheney.
   ``The way that you use the military effectively in Latin America
is to help the Latin Americans help themselves, not use U.S.
military forces to topple Latin American governments.''

   Despite a string of record profits, hundreds
of commercial banks and the government insurance fund that
guarantees their deposits are far less healthy than they seem,
analysts say.
   The warnings are making members of Congress nervous just two
months after they enacted a $50 billion, three-year bailout of the
savings and loan industry.
   Legislators remember all too well the reassurances they heard
from regulators and industry executives while the S&amp;L business was
crumbling, and how quickly hints of trouble mushroomed into the
most dire financial crisis since the Depression.
   Two well-known banking economists, Robert E. Litan of the
Brookings Institution, a liberal think tank, and R. Dan Brumbaugh
Jr. of Stanford University, report that commercial banks, though
better off as a whole than S&amp;Ls, may be heading for trouble
themselves.
   Litan, appearing before the Senate Banking Committee last week,
warned that about two-thirds of the reserves in the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp.'s bank fund will be needed for banks that are weak
or already insolvent.
   At the end of June, the FDIC's bank reserves totaled $14.5
billion. But Litan and Brumbaugh say their analysis of bank data
through March shows that $9.5 billion of that is needed to cover
losses at banks that are insolvent or close to it, leaving only a
thin $5 billion layer of protection before taxpayers would be
called on to bail out the fund.
   A post-Depression record of 221 banks failed last year. So far
this year, 167 have closed or required government assistance to
stay open _ 116 in Texas.
   FDIC Chairman L. William Seidman says he expects failures for
all of 1989 to be slightly below last year and to decline further
in 1990.
   However, a study by analyst William C. Ferguson of Irving,
Texas, casts doubt o that. He said that 443 banks of 13,000
nationwide have been losing money consistently from 1987 through
the first quarter of this year.
   ``In spite of the high reported earnings of the banking industry
(overall), the picture is not as rosy as it seems,'' Ferguson said.
``If present earnings trends for these (443) banks continue, this
group will run out of capital by late 1990 or early 1991.''
   The banking industry disputes its critics.
   ``Skeptics make a living peddling a different tune,'' Nebraska
banker C.G. Holthus, president-elect of the American Bankers
Association, told a House subcommittee. ``We think they're
exaggerating the problem.''
   By many measures, commercial banks, unlike savings and loans,
are flourishing.
   Banks earned a record six-month profit of $14.3 billion in the
first half of 1989, on top of the record annual profit of $25.1
billion last year. And their three most pressing problems have all
eased:
   _The nation's largest banks have added to their loss reserves,
putting them in a better position to withstand a deterioration of
shaky Third World debtor nations to repay the banks' loans.
   _The string of Midwestern bank failures has subsided with the
recovery of the farm economy.
   _The economies of Texas and other oil-producing states, where
most of the failures are concentrated now, appear to have bottomed
out.
   Moreover, the savings and loan bailout bill passed this summer
nearly doubles the insurance premium paid by banks. That will
provide an added $1.5 billion a year to help the fund recover from
its first-ever loss in 1988.
   ``Simply put, the condition of commercial banks is not a thrift
crisis in sheep's clothing,'' said James J. McDermott Jr. of Keefe,
Bruyette &amp; Woods Inc., an analyst who expresses more optimism than
some of his colleagues.
   Replied Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa., ``I'm not sure I'm reassured.
... It's a little bit like saying the United States is better off
than Bangladesh.''
   On the House side, Rep. Frank Annunzio, D-Ill., has been voicing
similar worries and last week asked Congress' auditing arm, the
General Accounting Office, to conduct a comprehensive study of the
deposit insurance fund and the condition of banking.
   ``Although federal regulators paint a rosy picture of the
industry, certain industry experts cast doubt on this assessment. I
am deeply troubled over the concerns raised by these experts,'' he
said in a letter requesting the study.
   The analysts identify two areas as the likely causes of the next
banking crisis: large banks' growing involvement in financing
leveraged corporate buyouts and community banks' decision to follow
thrifts into real estate lending.
   Bank real estate loans have soared 75 percent from $364 billion
in 1984 to $636 billion in 1988, according to consultant Alex
Sheshunoff of Austin, Texas. Softening property values in
northeastern states are particularly ominous.
   ``Real estate lending has become the Achilles heel of banking,''
he said. `` ... Some of the growth unfortunately financed
speculative excesses which will take time to absorb.''

<TEXT>
   Hundreds of students returned to campus
Monday when the American University of Beirut reopened after being
closed for six months, its longest shutdown since the sectarian
civil war began 14 years ago.
   ``The whole family's back,'' said Radwan Mawlawi, spokesman for
AUB, the alma mater of the Arab world's elite and once the most
admired university in the Middle East.
   The cafeteria was packed with students, who hugged each other
and renewed friendships. Others jammed the campus post office,
checking their accumulated mail.
   Mawlawi said the campus was hit several times by artillery fire,
causing ``extensive damage ...that has now been repaired.''
   ``Everything's in place. The faculty and students are here,'' he
said. Syrian troops and Lebanese police in red berets checked
student ID cards at the three gates of the tree-lined campus
overlooking the Mediterranean in Moslem west Beirut.
   ``Beirut's life is throbbing again now that the university has
reopened,'' said a policeman who strolled through the campus.
   It was not known how many of the 5,000 students returned on
Monday. Ghada Sheib, a Shiite Moslem architecture student, said:
``I'm very happy to be back. Let's hope it'll last.''
   Many students and other residents of Beirut share her doubts
about the durability of a cease-fire that began Sept. 22. The
truce, arranged by the Arab League, stopped an artillery war that
began March 8 between the Christian army units of Gen. Michel Aoun
and a Moslem alliance led by Syrian soldiers.
   More than 900 people were killed and nearly 3,000 wounded in the
artillery battles, among the most savage of the civil war.
   Closure of the university, founded 123 years ago by Protestant
missionary Daniel Bliss of New England, made it impossible for
students to take examinations.
   ``I hope this semester won't be interrupted, because I have to
begin my master's degree next semester,'' said Ghada Kahtan, 27, an
agricultural student.
   Ms. Khatan, a Sunni Moslem, has endured many interruptions in
her education because of the war, in which more than 150,000
Lebanese have been killed. ``I hope I'll graduate this time,'' she
said. ``Let's hope this cease-fire's genuine.''
   Marleen de Tavernier, a 29-year-old Belgian doctor studying
public health, said: ``I've been waiting for this day. I only need
two more months to finish my master's.''
   The reopening coincided with resumption of classes at scores of
schools that were forced to close because of the shelling.
Education officials estimated 800,000 children university students
and returned to school Monday.
   American Univerersity of Beirut has produced at least three
Lebanese presidents, 10 prime ministers, more than 100 Cabinet
ministers and ambassadors, and several guerrilla leaders. It is
chartered under the laws of New York state.
   The 400-bed university hospital, Lebanon's largest, stayed open
through the fighting. Its doctors and interns treated about about
80 percent of the casualties in west Beirut, often working while
shells from Christian artillery exploded around the building.
   Terrorism swept the university after the civil war began in
1975. President David Dodge, a grandson of Bliss, the founder, was
kidnapped on the campus in 1982 and freed a year later.
   A gunman killed another president, Malcolm Kerr, outside his
office on Jan. 18, 1984. Several U.S. and British staff members
were abducted.
   Frederic P. Herter, an American who now is president, has not
set foot on campus since taking up the post in March 1987 because
of a U.S. government ban on travel to Lebanon.
   Herter, 68, presided over a meeting of trustees in Amman,

   A cyst removed from President Bush's right
middle finger was non-cancerous, as had been expected, a spokesman
said today.
   The cyst, which had bothered Bush for several years, was removed
during surgery Friday at Walter Reed Army Medical Center and was
tested to make sure it was not cancerous.
   ``The pathology report is (that it is) benign,'' said a press
aide, Laura Melillo.
   She said Bush was informed of the results today as he was
winding up a three-day weekend at Camp David, the presidential
retreat in Maryland's Catoctin Mountains. Bush had described the
surgery, done under a local anesthetic, as minor but said doctors
had had to cut deeply into the finger, near the bone, to remove the
growth.

<HEAD>Aquino Refuses Compromise on Marcos Burial</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT H. REID</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Corazon Aquino said Monday
she would not compromise her refusal to let Ferdinand E. Marcos,
her exiled predecessor, be buried in the Philippines.
   A Manila newspaper quoted Imelda Marcos, the former president's
widow, as suggesting terms be negotiated for allowing Marcos to be
buried in Ilocos Norte, his home province. Marcos died Sept. 28 in
Honolulu at age 72.
   Two senators urged Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos to reveal
details of an alleged plot to kill Mrs. Aquino in connection with a
coup by Marcos forces.
   Marcos had lived in exile in Hawaii since a civilian-military
uprising drove him from the country on Feb. 26, 1986, after 20
years in office. Mrs. Aquino cited fears of civil unrest in
refusing to allow the return of the body or Marcos relatives.
   In a statement Monday, she said: ``The position against the
return of the remains of former President Marcos is based on
considerations of national interest and security, so it cannot be
the subject of compromise.''
   Cabinet officials said last week the ban was based in part on
intelligence reports of a plot to assassinate Mrs. Aquino. The
government has not released details, but congressmen briefed on the
contents have warned of a serious threat to stability if Marcos'
body is returned.
   Sen. Ernesto Maceda, chairman of the Senate Defense Committee,
said Ramos should reveal the reports public because of their
seriousness.
   Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile, the former defense minister and an
opposition senator, endorsed Maceda's request, to which the
government did not respond.
   Malaya, a Manila newspaper, quoted Mrs. Marcos as suggesting
discussions about the burial could begin when Mrs. Aquino visits
the United States in November.
   ``I have always been open to this,'' she was quoted as saying.
``We have initiated it and we will not tire to initiate such a move
because of our obsession with what is right.''
   The Supreme Court has asked the government to respond by Friday
to a petition by Marcos supporters asking that the ban on the
body's return be nullified.
   An 8-7 court ruling last month found Marcos to be a security
threat, but loyalists hope the justices will reconsider now that
the former president is dead.
   Mrs. Aquino told a business group Monday forgiving the Marcoses
would undermine public faith in morality.
   ``The spirit of reconciliation has been extended to the blind
forgiveness of those who fronted for the dicatorship and who have
yet to make restitution to the nation,'' she declared.
   ``My critical attitude toward this development has been called
vindictiveness. ... What worries me about this is not so much that
the guilty are escaping censure, but that the millions of innocent
Filipinos will lose faith in the value of morals.''
   Several Manila newspapers reported from Honolulu that Sen.
Joseph Estrada was trying to mediate between the Marcos family and
the government.
   Estrada, who left for Hawaii on Friday, was elected to the
Senate in May 1987 as an opposition member, but later joined the
governing coalition. He is a former actor and served as mayor of
San Juan, a Manila suburb, during the Marcos presidency.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Set to Hear White Rape Convict's Complaint of Jury
Bias</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A white man's claim that a lack of black jurors
denied him a fair trial on charges including rape is among the
cases the U.S. Supreme Court is to consider this week.
   In arguments scheduled Wednesday before the court, Daniel
Holland's lawyers plan to argue that white defendants should be
accorded the same constitutional right granted to blacks to
challenge racial bias during jury selection.
   Prosecutors say race was not an issue and contend that Holland's
case could lead to unworkable quotas for juries.
   An all-white jury in the suburban Des Plaines branch of Cook
County Circuit Court convicted Holland in 1981 on charges of rape,
sexual assault, kidnapping and armed robbery in the abduction of a
17-year-old girl and her boyfriend.
   The victims were driving home from a party when their car had a
flat tire. Holland offered them a ride, then pulled a knife,
threatened the girl and ordered the boyfriend out of the car,
according to court documents.
   Holland then drove to a Des Plaines apartment complex, raped the
girl several times and took about $60 before fleeing, the documents
show.
   He was arrested later that morning and tried by a jury selected
from a pool of about 40 people, two of whom were black.
   Holland's conviction was overturned on other grounds by the
Illinois Appellate Court, but reinstated later by the state Supreme
Court.
   His appeal puts the spotlight on a legal tradition that allows
lawyers to reject a certain number of potential jurors without
giving a reason, using what are called peremptory challenges.
   In Holland's case, prosecutors dimissed the two blacks and eight
other people without a reason, but said race was not an issue.
   Prosecutors are barred from using peremptory challenges to
exclude blacks from juries for racial reasons under a 1986 Supreme
Court decision. But the high court has held that only minorities
have a right to challenge racial bias during jury selection.
   ``White defendants have no comparable weapon to fight racial
bigotry,'' Donald Honchell, an attorney for Holland, wrote in
arguments filed with the U.S. Supreme Court. ``There can be no
image of a fair jury in the eyes of the community if the process of
selecting it sanctions discrimination.''
   Inge Fryklund, supervisor of criminal appeals for the state's
attorney's office, contends that Holland's lawyers are trying to
twist the constitutional right to an impartial jury into a mandate
that all juries be representative of communities from which they
are selected.
   That would be ``unsound, unworkable and unnecessary,'' Ms.
Fryklund argues.

<HEAD>Government Begins Telephone Switchover</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY ARNOLD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government is switching to a new
long-distance telephone network designed to provide 1.3 million
federal workers with state-of-the-art voice, data and video
communications.
   The move, which officials say will save taxpayers hundreds of
millions of dollars, comes after five years of study, wrangling and
complaints by losing bidders.
   The changeover began during the long Columbus Day weekend at 31
government buildings nationwide. Ultimately, more than 1,300
locations in 90 federal agencies will be tied to the network when
it is fully installed in mid-1990.
   The General Services Administration is overseeing the mammoth
switchover with the two prime contractors that won a fierce bidding
war for the project, American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. and US
Sprint Communications Co.
   Known as FTS2000, for the Federal Telecommunications System
2000, the contract may be worth as much as $25 billion over 10
years to AT&amp;T and Sprint.
   GSA estimates FTS2000 will save taxpayers between $15 million
and $20 million a month for regular telephone service _ or as much
as half of the government's $400 million annual phone bill.
   ``The government's phone bill is going to be going down
substantially, beginning this weekend,'' Michael Corrigan, GSA
deputy commissioner for telecommunications services, said in a
recent interview.
   AT&amp;T says a five-minute call between Washington and San
Francisco will cost about 70 cents under FTS2000, compared with
$1.40 on AT&amp;T's regular long-distance service or $1.35 on the
government's existing network.
   FTS2000 replaces a phone system that AT&amp;T installed in 1963. The
old network provided only voice commmunications and low-speed data
transmission.
   When FTS2000 is fully in place, federal employees will be able
to communicate with new speed and efficiency over crystal-clear,
digital fiber-optic phone lines that transmit information on beams
of laser light.
   AT&amp;T and Sprint are banking on federal agencies buying
additional services such as videoconferencing, high-speed facsimile
service or systems to link large numbers of computers.
   FTS2000 is a 10-year, fixed-rate contract that gives the
government special low rates to use Sprint's existing public
network and new AT&amp;T lines essentially dedicated to FTS2000,
Corrigan said.
   Under the contract, which Congress began considering in 1984 and
GSA awarded in December, AT&amp;T will serve 60 percent of federal
government and Sprint 40 percent. The two companies will re-bid for
40 percent of the other's share of the contract during the fourth
and seventh years of the agreement.
   MCI Communications Corp., the nation's No. 2 long-distance
company behind AT&amp;T, lost the bidding and has battled in court and
at the Federal Communications Commission to overturn the contract.
   MCI claimed that AT&amp;T's FTS2000 prices discriminated against
AT&amp;T's regular customers and that the prices were below AT&amp;T's
costs.
   The FCC rejected MCI's claims.
   The new system will make it easier for the government to protect
secrets by using fiber-optic cable, which are buried in the ground.
Because they don't use electromagnetic signals, they can't be
``tapped'' by normal means.

<HEAD>Museum Reveals Van Gogh Deal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Museum of Modern Art agreed to sell two
Picassos, a Monet, a Renoir and three other paintings from its
permanent collection to get Vincent van Gogh's portrait of the
postman Joseph Roulin, The New York Times reported Monday.
   The portrait, painted in 1888-89, arrived at the museum from a
bank vault in Zurich on July 31. Now, details of the deal that
brought it here have been made public.
   For much of this century, the painting was in the B. Mayer
collection in Zurich. It was bought in 1987 by the most recent
owners and placed in the bank vault.
   Christopher Burge, president of Christie's in New York,
estimated recently that ``Roulin'' would be worth roughly the same
at auction as van Gogh's ``Irises,'' which brought $53.9 million in
1987.
   Kirk Varnedoe, director of painting and sculpture at the Modern,
told the Times the museum got ``Roulin'' for substantially less
than that because the unidentified owners wanted it to hang in a
museum. Still, he said, the price was ``not a raging fire-sale
bargain.''
   At first, Varnedoe said, museum officials didn't think they
could afford the van Gogh. But ``because of changes in the art
market, pictures we had available were worth more than we had
thought they were worth, and so it now seemed possible.''
   In August, the museum, in exchange for ``Roulin,'' gave four
paintings and an undisclosed amount of cash to Swiss dealers Thomas
Ammann and Ernst Beyeler, who represented the owners.
   The dealers received a Monet titled ``Corona (Water Lilies),''
from around 1920; Renoir's ``Reclining Nude,'' 1902; Wassily
Kandinsky's ``Autumn Landscape, Murnau,'' 1908; and Picasso's
``Striped Bodice,'' September 1943.
   To reimburse the Modern for the cash it paid _ and, Varnedoe
hopes, provide some extra profits, as well _ three other paintings
will be sold at auction on Nov. 15 at Sotheby's in New York.
   They are Giorgio de Chirico's ``Evangelical Still Life,'' 1916,
which has a presale estimate of $2 million to $3 million; Piet
Mondrian's ``Blue Facade (Composition 9),'' 1913-14, estimated at
$3 million to $4 million; and Picasso's ``Studio in a Painted
Frame,'' April 1956, estimated at $2 million to $3 million.
   The donors of the works granted permission to sell them.
   Varnedoe said the paintings that were relinquished had mostly
languished in storage for years and were not considered crucial
representations of the collection. Even so, he said, the van Gogh
merited a considerable sacrifice.
   ``We feel van Gogh's portraits are the starting point for a
whole vein of 20th-century art,'' said Varnedoe. ``They had
influence on Matisse and many others, the whole concept of
revealing a personality not by appearance but color had a profound
influence, and we were not telling this part of the story of modern
art without the portrait. It was a missing chapter.''

<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's top educator has announced
the beginning of a nationwide study of American Indian schooling
that he hopes will help change decades of disappointing academic
performance.
   ``You may say, `We've been studying this problem for 200 years.
Why another study?''' Secretary of Education Lauro Cavazos said
Sunday. ``But you have to start thinking about what we don't know.
Just by calling attention to it, hopefully, we can bring America to
focus on this problem.
   ``With luck, maybe, by the turn of the century, we'll start
turning the corner.''
   Cavazos spoke at the kickoff meeting of the National Indian
Education Association's 21st annual conference, scheduled through
Thursday. About 1,400 American Indian educators from across the
nation are attending.
   Cavazos said the study is vital because the nation has no
comprehensive statistics on American Indian school achievement. But
what is known is enough to suggest that a need for extra attention,
he said.
   He noted a 90 percent unemployment rate on some Indian
reservations and a school dropout rate double the national average
of 25 percent. He said 75 percent of the American Indian students
who make it to college fail to finish.
   Cavazos titled the study ``Indian Nations at Risk,'' borrowing
from the 1983 ``A Nation at Risk'' report on the country's ailing
public education system.

   NATO Secretary-General Manfred Woerner said Monday
the Western allies must use aid to support political change in
Poland and Hungary, which he called test cases of the alliance's
strategy.
   ``The windows have been opened in the closed societies of
Eastern Europe, the allies do not intend to let them slam shut
again,'' Woerner said in a speech to the North Atlantic Assembly, a
consultative organization of legislators from NATO countries.
   He said the flight of 50,000 East Germans to the West, the
decision to give Hungary's Communist Party a new name and platform,
strikes by Soviet miners and the ``joy of the Poles as they greet
their first non-Communist prime minister in 40 years'' demonstrate
that the peoples of the East have not become accustomed to their
political leadership.
   ``Even if the alliance does not have responsibility for specific
aid programs, only NATO can harmonize and coordinate the efforts of
the member nations as a whole on these herculean tasks; only NATO
brings the combined resources of North American and Western Europe
to bear on them,'' Woerner said.
   He said the aid efforts should concentrate on Poland and Hungary
because they are taking steps to move closer to democracy and give
reform a chance.
   ``Poland and Hungary are the two test cases,'' said Woerner.
``If reform fails, the lessons will not be lost on the hardliners
in Czechoslovakia and East Germany. But if reform succeeds, that
success will generate irresistible presures for similar change
throughout Eastern Europe.''
   He said NATO should use its limited influence to support change
by backing Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and others in
their reforms promoting more openness, pluralism, human rights and
human contact.
   ``The postwar period has come to an end. We are seeing the
profound transformation of the European political and security
structure. This offers us opportunites which we should and will not
miss,'' said Woerner.
   But he cautioned the Western allies against making unilateral
moves that he said weaken the alliance.
   ``I will not hide my concern at a tendency that I observe today
in most of our member nations which are starting to unilaterally
reduce their defense efforts,'' said Woerner. ``It is wrong and
it's dangerous.''
   The Soviet response to allied proposals at the conventional arms
talks in Vienna has been encouraging, he said, but the Warsaw Pact
retains an overwhelming superiority in conventional arms.
   NATO must base its security on Soviet and Warsaw Pact potential,
not on announced intentions, said Woerner.

   A light snow fell on Mount Etna on Monday
as streams of fiery orange lava flowed down the side of Europe's
most active volcano.
   The lava surging from the volcano's crater and fissures had
slowed considerably from last week, said Giovanni Fazzetta of the
International Institute of Vulcanology in Catania.
   The lava was far from villages near the volcano on the southern
Italian island of Sicily, and authorities said no one was in danger.
   Earth tremors that rocked the area last week had nearly ceased,
Fazzetta said.
   Over the weekend, the flaming lava burned dozens of trees in its
path. Farmers harvested their apples early to save them from damage.
   Snow began falling Sunday evening and continued Monday morning.
   Mount Etna has been erupting since Sept. 11. While the
government has said the situation is not dangerous, it sent
prefabricated housing to the area in case evacuations become
necessary.

   Jury selection began Monday for the trial of the
first of a series of lawsuits filed by former patients who allege
they were victims of sexual abuse and battery at camps for troubled
children.
   The first lawsuit, with five plaintiffs, is being heard in
Fulton County Superior Court, where more than 100 potential jurors
were given questionnaires to fill out Monday. Attorneys estimate
the trial could take a month or longer.
   In all, eight lawsuits were filed by 120 plaintiffs who allege
they were abused while patients at Anneewakee's campuses in Douglas
County and Rockmart, Ga., and Carrabelle, Fla. The lawsuits name a
total of 31 defendants.
   The non-profit Anneewakee program, which provides long-term care
and wilderness-based therapy for teen-agers with psychological
problems, has treated hundreds of patients since it was founded 27
years ago.
   Allegations of abuse of patients surfaced in 1986.
   Anneewakee founder Louis J. Poetter, 69, pleaded guilty last
year to 19 counts of sodomy and one count of simple battery against
boys treated in the program. He was sentenced to eight years in
prison.
   In the wake of the scandal, Anneewakee was placed under the
management of the Hospital Corporation of America, with leadership
from a new board of trustees.
   Because of the number of people involved in the lawsuits, the
old Fulton County Commission meeting room in the county's
governmental complex has been pressed into service as a courtroom.

<HEAD>China Acknowledges Worsening Drug Problem</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police acknowledged Monday that farmers have been
found growing opium poppies in the southwestern border areas, and
that drug addiction has become a problem in the region.
   Liu Wen, director of criminal investigation in the Ministry of
Public Security, said he did not know the number of addicts, and
all poppy crops found have been eradicated.
   Both problems were byproducts of a growing transit trade in
drugs from southeast Asia, through southern China to Hong Kong and
Macao, he said.
   Liu spoke at a news conference at the end of a five-day
conference on drug law enforcement in Asia, organized by Interpol.
The meeting, closed to reporters, was ``an important conference of
practical significance,'' Liu said.
   He said the 79 delegates from 32 countries and regions adopted a
10-point resolution calling on their governments to make anti-drug
efforts a top priority and strengthen international cooperation,
including financial assistance for underdeveloped countries
fighting drug trafficking.
   They also called on Interpol to study the possiblity of setting
up a drug law enforcement training center in Asia.
   Interpol officials said China's drug problem remains relatively
small. But Yuan Yongyuan, deputy director of criminal
investigation, said the number of drug trafficking cases discovered
in 1988 reached 268, up from just 56 the year before. He said
police seized 525 pounds of opium in 1988, nearly double the 1987
amount, and 365 pounds of heroin, nearly four times the 1987 amount.
   Partial figures for 1989 showed continued increase, he said.
   ``After eliminating drugs for 30 years, many people (in China)
are not prepared and are not paying enough attention _ including
police and customs officials,'' he said. ``They cannot recognize
heroin and opium.''
   Opium addiction was one of China's most serious social problems
in the early part of the century. After taking power in 1949, the
Communists executed drug traffickers and ``re-educated'' users. For
decades the government said drug abuse had been wiped out.
   Yuan blamed its re-emergence on China's increased foreign
contacts since 1978, and especially the relaxed policy on allowing
Hong Kong residents to enter the mainland.
   Hong Kong residents have been convicted in several drug
smuggling cases in recent years. One was executed in February after
being convicted of recruiting three mainland Chinese in a smuggling
scheme. Opium and heroin are brought into southern China's Yunnan
province from Burma, Thailand and Laos, and on to Canton and Hong
Kong for sale to the West.
   Most of the conference participants were from Asia and the
Middle East. The only Western countries to attend were Colombia and
Chile.

<HEAD>U.N. Officials Worried By Escalating Political Violence</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   United Nations officials will urge
rival political leaders to halt ``vicious mob behavior'' by
supporters that resulted in two deaths and scores of injuries over
the weekend, a U.N. spokesman said Monday.
   The violence, which included hand grenade attacks, was the most
extensive since the campaign for next month's pre-independence
elections began in July.
   Clashes followed separate rallies held in far-northern Namibia
by the South-West Africa People's Organization and its leading
rival, the Democratic Turnhalle Alliance.
   SWAPO, favored to win the most votes in the Nov. 7-11 election,
waged a 23-year guerrilla war against South African rule of
Namibia. Its membership is overwhelmingly black and it advocates
socialist economic policies.
   The Democratic Turnhalle Alliance is multiracial, participated
in a South African-installed territorial government, and advocates
a capitalist economy.
   Fred Eckhard, spokesman for the U.N. contingent that is
overseeing the independence process, said U.N. Special
Representative Martti Ahtisaari would discuss the violence Tuesday
with leaders of the two parties.
   Ahtisaari ``was dismayed at the vicious mob behavior,'' Eckhard
said. ``He continues to monitor closely the disturbing trend in the
north.''
   Authorities said two people were killed and about 60 injured in
hand grenade attacks and clashes in and around the northern town of
Oshakati. The fighting broke out folliwng a mass rally Saturday
addressed by SWAPO President Sam Nujoma.
   South Africa has ruled Namibia since World War I, but agreed
last year to grant independence as part of a regional treaty also
calling for the withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola, Namibia's
northern neighbor.
   The elections in November are for seats in an assembly that will
draft a constitution for an independent Namibia. No date for
independence has been set.

   Five alpine passes remained closed Monday after an
early snowfall over the weekend, officials said.
   The Nufenen, Grimsel, Furka, Susten and Klausen passes in
central and eastern Switzerland remained closed to road traffic
following the storm, the Swiss Touring Club said.
   The Gotthard pass was closed temporarily after receiving 8
inches of snow Saturday, but was open again Monday.
   The snowstorm left 14 mountain climbers stranded in three alpine
huts in the Bernese Oberland region of central Switzerland on
Sunday, said emergency rescue service spokesman Marco Azzoni.
   Snow fell at altitudes as low as 2,400 feet in some parts of
Switzerland. Some winter resorts in eastern Switzerland reported
being snowed in.
   The Swiss meteorological service said cold temperatures were
expected to continue in Switzerland at least until Wednesday.

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Roh Tae-woo, who meets with
President Bush next week, said Monday he hopes for stronger ties
with the United States, and he scolded dissidents for their
anti-American attitude.
   Roh said anti-American acts such as flag-burnings and violent
protests have contributed to anti-Korean sentiments in the United
States, and he urged ``the small number of extreme radicals to
change their attitude.''
   ``I have reports that American feelings inside and outside the
government towards our country are worsening as some (South Korean)
forces have shown fierce anti-American sentiments and also
committed violent acts,'' he said in a weekly nationwide radio
address.
   Radical students and dissidents, a small but vocal minority,
have staged demonstrations demanding the withdrawal of 43,000 U.S.
troops stationed in South Korea. Radicals allege Roh is a puppet of
Washington and have called for his ouster.
   Some U.S. congressmen have proposed cutting U.S. troops strength
in South Korea, saying Seoul can afford its own defense. Bush and
Roh have said the troops would remain as long as both sides feel
they are needed.
   Roh is scheduled to visit Washington Oct. 16-18 to talk with
Bush and address a joint session of Congress on topics ranging from
bilaterial security issues to U.S. demand for a larger access to
the Korean market.
   Roh said he planned to discuss ``the direction in which our
country and the United States can advance as cooperative partners
toward common ideals.''
   Roh said trade frictions between the two countries and
controversy over the U.S. miltiary presence reflect South Korea's
growing economy and new sense of nationalism.
   South Korea's trade surplus with the United States, which buys
about 35 percent of Korea's exports, stood at $8.6 billion last
year.
   He said friction over U.S. demands for Korea to open its markets
and to appreciate its won currency against the dollar have fueled
the anti-American sentiment.
   Roh said the United States, like any other county, is seeking
its national interest. He said huge U.S. trade deficits are a
factor threatening the stability of the world economy and South
Korea's economy, heavily dependent on exports, could suffer if the
world economy falls into trouble.
   He said, however, that this does not mean South Korea should
comply with all U.S. requests in opening its markets. Washington
has threatened to retaliate if Seoul refuses to increase beef
imports and complained that Korea failed to protect American
intellectual property rights.
   He said the U.S. military presence helps maintain peace and
stability in East Asia and deters an invasion from communist North
Korea.

<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Members of Hungary's revamped ruling
party today adopted a manifesto pledging to bring democracy to the
nation and then chose the head of the defunct Communist Party as
their leader.
   Delegates told reporters they chose Rezsoe Nyers as president of
the Hungarian Socialist Party after key reformists reluctantly
shelved their reservations to avoid a possible split within the
party.
   Nyers, who is considered a moderate, will lead the party during
the campaign for the first free national elections in 41 years.
   The selection was expected to exacerbate anxieties among some
reformists who want a clean break from the past and who worry that
the new party will not differ substantially from its predecessor.
   Tension was reported following a decision by delegates Sunday to
continue allowing party politics in the workplace. It has been a
common practice for communists to hold meetings and conduct
political courses for employees in the workplace.
   Reformers associate it with the indoctrination practices of
traditional Marxist-Leninist communist parties.
   Along with Nyers, the top candidates to lead the new party were
Premier Miklos Nemeth and Imre Pozsgay, both reformers. Unlike
Nyers, they supported keeping politics separate from the workplace.
   Nyers was chairman of the Hungarian Socialist Workers Party, or
Communist Party, which was disbanded Saturday at the congress and
replaced by the Socialist Party. Founding documents describe the
new party as one with Euro-Communist and Socialist leanings,
committed to a free market economy and a parliamentary democracy.
   In a vote today earlier taken by a show of hands, delegates
overwhelmingly approved a manifesto calling for ``a constitutional
state based on a multiparty system, where the source of power is
the will of the people expressed in free elections.''
   The Socialist Party was described as ``an organization in the
Marxist spirit ... totally committed to democracy.''
   
   All members of the old party are automatically members of the
new one and can continue to remain so by stating their agreement
with its democratic principles.
   The document creating the Socialist Party said it supports the
concept of private and state property and ``the development of a
... multiparty parliamentary democracy.''
   The move was the latest of a number of bold reforms in Hungary,
which with Poland is in the forefront of democratic reform in the
East bloc.
   But the initial euphoria of reformers seeking to create a party
with wide popular appeal was dampened when the congress endorsed
keeping politics in the workplace.
   Of about 1,200 delegates present for Sunday's balloting just 107
_ including Pozsgay, Nemeth and Foreign Minister Gyula Horn _ voted
against the measure. There were 34 abstentions.
   Free national elections are to be held by June, and the
Socialist Party will remain in power at least until then.
   But the new tensions could create a conflict between the party
and the government, which Nemeth leads.
   A source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Nyers and
Nemeth ``aren't talking to each other.''
   Even before the workplace vote, Deputy Premier Peter Medgyessy
had urged the new party to stop interfering in government business
pending the national elections.
   In other developments Sunday:
   _ A ranking Communist conservative, former Politburo member
Janos Berecz, defied Saturday's decision by the congress to create
a new party. He said the old party should should continue to exist
until the rank and file decides on its fate.
   Robert Ribanszki, another opponent of change, said he planned to
organize a plebiscite among the party's 720,000 members.
   _ Officials at the congress said the hard-line Communist East
Berlin leadership _ embittered over Hungary's decision to allow
East Germans free passage to the West _ had expressed its
congratulations at the party's transformation.
   Spokesman Emil Kimmel refused to elaborate, telling reporters
the text of the East German message would be published today, along
with one from Romania, a Soviet bloc country that has previously
condemned Hungarian reforms.
   He also did not say whether the Soviets had sent congratulations.

<TEXT>
   Harold E. Varmus says his first reaction
was disbelief when he was awakened by a radio interviewer this
morning and told he had shared the 1989 Nobel Prize in medicine.
   ``I didn't know if it was a false alarm or they got my name
confused, not having talked to anyone directly,'' said Varmus, 49.
``As we say in science, I needed confirmation of the information.''
   He and J. Michael Bishop, 53, a colleague at the University of
California School of Medicine in San Francisco, won the Nobel for
their discovery of the cellular origin of retroviral oncogenes.
   Their 1976 work on oncogenes, which control the growth of cells,
helped explain how malignant tumors develop, the Nobel citation
said.
   Bishop said he was ``stunned'' by the news and called his
situation this morning ``surreal.''
   Later, at a news conference at UC San Francisco, Bishop declined
to speculate about the proximity of a cancer cure.
   ``That's an imponderable at the moment ...,'' he said.
``Certainly we have a better image of what's wrong with the cancer
cell at the moment.''
   Varmus said he didn't think at the time that his work would lead
to the prize.
   ``I don't go to work thinking about the Nobel Prize,'' Varmus
said. ``I go to work thinking about the next experiment.''
   ``Obviously, in the last few years when you look back and see
that it had an impact in the field, then it becomes a
possibility,'' he said. ``But it's a possibility surrounded by the
incredible work of others who would also be deserving of it.''
   There has been so much work in related fields in recent years
that ``I was beginning to think we had gotten lost in the
blizzard,'' Varmus said at the news conference.
   He called the original work published in 1976 a ``cornerstone in
understanding the genetic mosaic of cancer''
   ``The basic idea that we helped establish is that cancer has its
origins in genes that normally do us some good,'' he said. ``But
after they become abnormal through mutation, they cause a role in
cancer.''
   ``We have the seeds of cancer in our own genetic dowry,'' Bishop
said, adding that even so, it doesn't mean that cancer is always
inherited.
   The award includes a $469,000 cash prize to be split by the two.
Does Varmus have any spending plans? ``I need a new compact disc
player,'' he responded, adding that his wife is lobbying for a
built-in dishwasher.
   Both Varmus, who wore blue jeans to the news conference, and
Bishop, who was dressed in a suit and tie, said immediate plans
included attending the fifth game of the National League pennant
race beween the San Francisco Giants and Chicago Cubs.
   ``We're off to the game _ just got tickets,'' Bishop said.
    Earlier, Varmus had showed how much he is a baseball fan by
quizzing Associated Press photographer Paul Sakuma, one of the
journalists gathered at his doorstep, when he leared Sakuma had
just come from photographing the Oakland A's return from Toronto.
He interrupted his interviews and asked Sakuma: ``Hey, what do you
think of (Jose) Canseco?''
   But he also showed his enthusiasm for his research, saying he
hoped the publicity would give the public ``some feeling for the
excitement and the beauty of understanding how cells work and the
hope that we think _ we hope _ we generate by beginning to
understand in very specific terms what goes wrong when a cell
becomes a cancer cell.''
   Bishop was born in York, Pa. on Feb. 22, 1936, studied at
Gettysburg College and Harvard and worked in the National
Institutes of Health outside Washington. He spent time in Hamburg,
West Germany, before moving to the University of California in 1968.
   He said he was 30 years old before he decided what direction to
take with his medical career, and credited a general practitioner
in rural Pennsylvania who ``took me under his wing.''
   Varmus came from Oceanside, N.Y., where he was born Dec. 18,
1939. He studied at Amherst College in Massachusetts, and earned
his master's degree at Harvard in 1962, the same year Bishop earned
his medical degree at Harvard. Varmus received a medical degree
from Columbia University in 1966.
   Varmus also worked at the National Institutes of Health as a
clinical associate before becoming a postdoctoral fellow at the
California School of Medicine in 1970.
   He said he abandoned plans to become an English professor after
considering the advice given to writer Gertrude Stein ``that
medicine opened all doors.''

   The lines are being drawn in Congress for
coming battles over animal-protection bills.
   On one side is Rep. Vin Weber, R-Minn., who says Congress needs
a ``common-sense voice'' to combat the efforts of animal-rights
activists.
   Weber recently started recruiting like-minded collegues to join
a group he tentatively calls the Animal Welfare Caucus.
   ``I think we have a broad concern that the use of animals for
legitimate purposes ... is being unfairly projected to the general
public and vilified to the general public in a way that ulitimately
could have an impact on the quality of life of a lot of people,''
said Weber.
   On the other side is Annette Lantos, wife of Rep. Tom Lantos,
D-Calif. She is helping him and Rep. Robert Smith, R-N.H., organize
the Congressional Friends of Animals, which has already sponsored a
tour of an Army laboratory in San Francisco.
   Weber has enlisted three other House members so far, including
Rep. Charles Stenholm, D-Texas, chairman of the House Agriculture
livestock subcommittee.
   Weber's opponents have received responses from 15 colleagues to
a ``Dear Colleague'' letter announcing the new group and expect to
sign up 30 to 40, Mrs. Lantos said.
   The caucuses plan to serve as forums for debate and
clearinghousses of information on a mounting number of bills facing
Congress.
   Among the bills several that would make it illegal to break into
laboratories and destroy documents.
   Other bills would set size requirements for veal-calf crates,
prohibit certain lethal testing of laboratory animals and require
special labels on cans of tuna that were caught in nets that
endanger dolphins.
   Still another bill would allow someone to sue the government on
behalf of an animal to make the Agriculture Department enforce the
Animal Welfare Act.
   But Weber said that consumers and many members of Congress don't
realize the impact the animal-rights movement could have on farming
and medical research.
   ``I don't think the average animal lover wants to stop research
that may be vital to finding a cure for Alzheimer's disease,'' he
said.
   Weber says he is concerned that the animal-rights movement will
try to write livestock protections into the 1990 farm bill.
   But the growing number of animal-protection bills reflects the
rising public concern about animal rights, said Betsy Dribben,
director of government relations for the Humane Society of the
United States.
   Congressional offices routinely have a worker assigned to animal
issues, where a few years ago they had none, she said.
   ``There's a growing wealth of legislation addressing animal
protection issues because the public is concerned,'' she said.
``Members of Congress are hearing from their constituents.''

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Actress Susan Dey, who portrays a woman who dies
needlessly of cervical cancer in a new TV movie, says the role
changed her attitude toward health care.
   ``It made me more positive about participating in it,'' she said
in the November Redbook. ``No offense to doctors, but I've never
liked them. They give bad news. Before I made this movie, if I felt
pain, I'd just sit and suffer.''
   The ``L.A. Law'' star says she once ignored a tumor in her
breast for a year ``until the pain got so bad that I couldn't lift
my arm.'' The problem turned out to be a benign cyst that was
removed.
   But she says she changed her mind after portraying the real-life
story of a woman who didn't learn about her condition until it was
too late, although doctors had warning signs.
   The movie, ``I Love You Perfect,'' should ``make an impact,''
she said. ``It will make women aware that there is a need for the
medical profession in their lives, but that they must participate
in their own health care and not just allow other people to take
over.''

<TEXT>
   Seven-year-old Jamie Fiske, who as an infant
received a liver transplant after her father's impassioned appeal
for a donor, underwent surgery today to remove her spleen.
   ``She's in the recovery room now doing very well,'' Dr. John
Najarian said after the three-hour operation at University of
Minnesota Hospital. The girl was listed in critical but stable
condition after the operation.
   Najarian said the spleen was seven or eight times normal size
for a child Jamie's age. He also said her liver ``is perfectly
normal.''
   ``Hopefully, she'll do well and be out of here in a week's
time,'' he said. ``It's hard to predict.''
   It was the first surgery for Jamie since her 1982 liver
transplant, which also took place at University of Minnesota
Hospital, said Jamie's father, Charles Fiske of Bridgewater, Mass.
At the time, she was one of the youngest liver transplant
recipients.
   Jamie was born Nov. 26, 1981, with biliary atresia, a condition
in which the liver's bile ducts are blocked. Months later, the
Fiskes learned that only a liver transplant could save her life.
   She underwent a liver transplant after her father, then a
hospital administrator, made an emotional appeal for a donor during
a convention at the American Academy of Pediatricians. The
nationally televised plea, including Fiske singing, ``Please don't
take my sunshine away,'' resulted in the offer a few days later
from a family in Utah whose 11-month-old son was killed in an
accident.
   On Saturday, Fiske said: ``We've been in worse places and
times.''
   Still, he said, ``It's major surgery for her, given the fact she
had a liver transplant. What's giving us confidence is that we're
coming back to an institution that knows her. The doctors have seen
her grow up.''
   The Minneapolis hospital sent an air ambulance Thursday to
Massachusetts to pick up Jamie and her father. Jamie, who is listed
in stable condition, has suffered three bouts of internal bleeding
this fall, and her doctors think an enlarged spleen may be
responsible, Fiske said.
   But Jamie's mind isn't on her impending surgery, Fiske said.
She's worried about whether she will be able to dress up as the
Queen of Hearts for Halloween, he said.
   ``She said to me today, `What about Halloween? Will I be back in
Boston for Halloween?'''
   He said doctors have estimated Jamie will be in the hospital for
about 10 days. Fiske said he hopes to have Jamie home in
Bridgewater, 35 miles south of Boston, by Halloween.
   Doctors don't believe Jamie's current problem is related to the
liver transplant, Fiske said in a news conference Saturday.
   Her spleen began to enlarge one year after her transplant, but
doctors said there had been no complications with it until now,
Fiske said. Her current problems began in her first week of second
grade this fall, when she suffered flu-like symptoms. She was
hospitalized for tests and doctors found she lost a large amount of
blood.
   When a spleen enlarges, blood vessels must find alternate routes
around the organ, bulge and are likely to tear. That's what doctors
believe has happened in this case, Fiske said.

<HEAD>Elderly Man Charged With Killing Ailing Wife Commits Suicide</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HALLANDALE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An 80-year-old man charged with
murdering his ailing wife of 55 years killed himself a few days
before he was to face a competency hearing, officials said.
   Joseph Motchan drank a mixture of sleeping pills, alcohol and
bleach, police said, and left behind a one-sentence note that said:
``I cannot live without her.''
   A friend found his body Sunday morning.
   Motchan, of Hallandale, had survived another suicide attempt
last month. He was to face a competency hearing Tuesday before
being tried on second-degree murder charges in the July 8 slaying
of his 79-year-old wife, Gertrude.
   ``He couldn't bring her back, so he decided to join her,'' said
the friend, Dr. Reuben Kallman.
   Motchan had claimed he did not remember stabbing his wife in the
heart and beating her in the head with a hammer, as police said he
had done.
   But in a tape-recorded confession after his arrest, Motchan told
police ``Well, I murdered her.''
   ``I see these elderly people in wheelchairs,'' he added, ``and
you have to pay like four or five, six hundred dollars a week to
wheel you around, you know. You'd probably have to find cheaper
quarters or deplete the few dollars we have.''
   Motchan's wife suffered from arthritis, osteoporosis and
Alzheimer's disease, but police said she was not terminally ill.
   Motchan was released from the Broward County Jail on $25,000
bail Aug. 11.
   On Sept. 14, he took an overdose of prescription pills and was
hospitalized under a state law used to detain people for
psychological treatment if they are deemed dangerous to themselves
or others.
   But two weeks ago, doctors said he was ready to return home. And
as late as Friday, Motchan was in good spirits, said Arthur
Stillman, one of two psychiatrists who treated him.
   Motchan had only seven Valium pills left Friday, the doctor said.
   ``Seven pills, or whatever he had left after Friday, wouldn't
kill anyone,'' Stillman said. ``It couldn't even kill a child,
probably not even with the alcohol.
   ``But the Clorox, my God. That's just horrible.''
   Stillman said the bleach could burn through a victim's throat
and stomach.

<HEAD>French Researcher Says He Should Have Been Honored</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Nobel-Medicine, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A French researcher who worked for the two
Americans honored Monday with the Nobel Prize for medicine said he
did the work on their project and should have at least shared the
award.
   ``I am very disappointed,'' said Dr. Dominique Stehelin, a
director of research for the National Center for Scientific
Research at the Pasteur Institute in Lille. ``I find all that very
unfair and rotten.''
   J. Michael Bishop and Harold E. Varmus won the Nobel Prize in
medicine for their discovery of a family of genes that has helped
scientists understand how cancer develops. Bishop and Varmus work
in the Department of Microbiology and Immunology at the University
of California School of Medicine in San Francisco.
   The 50-member Nobel Assembly of the Karolinska Institute in
Sweden cited the researchers ``for their discovery of the cellular
origin of retroviral oncogenes.''
   In 1976, Bishop and Varmus ``published the remarkable conclusion
that the oncogene in the virus did not represent a true viral gene,
but instead was a normal cellular gene,'' the citation said.
   Cancer viruses cause cancer with the help of animal genes that
have become incorporated into the viruses. The animal genes
normally help control the regular growth of cells. But when the
genes become part of viruses, they can trigger the uncontrolled
cell growth that typifies cancer tumors.
   ``I did the work all by myself, from A to Z,'' Stehelin told the
French news agency Agence France-Presse. ``I spent three years in
their San Francisco lab, from 1972 to 1975, at a time when nobody
other than me was working on the subject and I am not even
associated in this distinction (the Nobel).''
   Stehelin said he was the first and principal signer of the first
article in the scientific magazine Nature in 1976 on the discovery
of a cellular gene, which is at the origin of the emergence of a
cancer.
   ``A year after my depart from San Francisco, where I was alone,
without even a technician, two-thirds of the people in the
microbiology and immunology laboratory were working on oncogenes,''
Stehelin said.
   ``This work belongs to me,'' he said, ``and I don't know why the
scientific community refuses to attribute the discovery to me.
Undoubtedly because working in Lille is judged less prestigious
than being a researcher in San Francisco.''

<HEAD>Arts Endowment Shaken by Controversy Over `Obscene' Art</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Updates with weekend Senate action, subbing 8th graf, Approved

<TEXT>
   The National Endowment for the Arts, shaken by
a conservative furor over subsidizing ``obscene art,'' is getting a
new chairman this week who promises to strike a balance between
freewheeling artistic freedom and respect for the public's trust.
   ``We are not the nation's official pornographer, and it's
important that the country know that,'' said John E. Frohnmayer, a
47-year-old lawyer from Portland, Ore., who takes command of the
beleaguered arts endowment Tuesday.
   Nonetheless, some members of the cultural community are
expressing fear that the bitter controversy over the endowment's
role in financing controversial art might undermine future support
for bold, innovative _ and unpopular _ artistic ventures.
   The worst political crisis in the NEA's 24-year history began
earlier this year when conservative members of Congress were
outraged to discover that $45,000 in endowment funds had been used
to support two exhibitions they found offensive.
   One featured works by the late photographer Robert Mapplethorpe
that included homosexual and sadomasochistic themes and pictures of
nude children. The other show, by artist Andres Serrano, featured a
photograph of a crucifix submerged in a container of urine.
   In a surprise move, Jesse Helms, R-N.C., won Senate approval of
his sweeping proposal to prohibit spending federal funds on
``obscene and indecent'' art or any work that ``denigrates, debases
or reviles'' anybody on the basis of race, creed, sex, handicap,
age or national origin.
   His amendment to the arts endowment's $171 million
appropriations bill caused a furor in the arts community, and
House-Senate negotiators finally produced a compromise last week
that contains a watered-down version of the Helms proposal.
   The legislation, awaiting action by President Bush, would bar
government financing of works that ``may be obscene'' and lack
``serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value'' _ the
Supreme Court's 1973 guideline on obscenity.
   The NEA chairman, however, would retain authority to make final
decisions on the artistic merit of grant applications.
   Also, the bill earmarks $250,000 for a 12-member commission to
study the NEA's grant-making process to determine whether new
standards should be adopted governing federal subsidies for
controversial art.
   ``It's certainly going to put a chill in the air, because the
endowment is being asked not only to judge artistic quality but to
act as a moral watchdog,'' said Martin Friedman, director of the
Walker Art Center in Minneapolis.
   Hoping to avoid becoming embroiled in the controversy,
Washington's Corcoran Gallery of Art canceled plans to display the
traveling Mapplethorpe exhibition last July, but the move backfired
disastrously.
   The venerable museum suffered artist boycotts, the resignation
of the museum's chief curator, loss of a $1.5 million bequest from
artist Lowell Nesbitt, a plunge in staff morale and a tarnishing of
the Corcoran's reputation as a showcase for contemporary American
art. The Corcoran trustees are studying how to repair the damage,
including whether director Christina Orr-Cahall should be fired.
   Frohnmayer, vacationing in Oregon late last week, said in a
telephone interview that he intends to shift public attention from
the Mapplethorpe-Serrano controversy to the endowment's largely
overlooked ``good works'' in underwriting artistic excellence.
   ``We have a very fine line to walk here between continuing
artistic freedom and maintaining the public trust, when you're
using taxpayer dollars,'' said Frohnmayer, a former chairman of the
Oregon State Arts Commission.
   He rejects any notion that he'll be coming to Washington as a
government censor. But he intends to find out ``how we got into
this controversy in the first place, and to make sure we avoid a
similar controversy in the future.''
   Frohnmayer said he specifically will take steps to ensure
greater NEA control over grants to local arts institutions that
currently dispense the money to artists at their discretion.
   The Mapplethorpe exhibition was organized by the University of
Pennsylvania's Institute for Contemporary Art in Philadelphia and
partially financed by an NEA grant. Serrano's works were
underwritten by endowment funds awarded to the Southeastern Center
for Contemporary Art in Winston-Salem, N.C.
   Frohnmayer will succeed Frank Hodsoll, who departed in February,
as chairman of the independent federal agency, which dispensed $156
million last year to about 800 artists and 3,800 arts institutions,
from major symphony orchestras and opera companies to poets, folk
artists and small-town theater companies.
   Grants are awarded after an exhaustive selection process
involving ``peer panel review'' of applicants by fellow artists.
These panels' recommendations are subject to approval by the NEA
chairman and the National Council on the Arts, the endowment's
independent, presidentially appointed advisory body.
   Besides putting the government's imprimatur on cultural
endeavors of the highest quality, endowment officials say, the
matching grants serve as a catalyst for private financial support
of the arts. They estimate that every federal dollar spent in NEA
grants has yielded more than $5 in contributions from individuals,
corporations and foundations.
   The endowment is no stranger to political controversy. It has
weathered recurring congressional hearings on its grant-making
process. It rebuffed allegations by conservative lawmakers a few
years ago that it was subsidizing ``pornographic poetry'' and
wasting taxpayers' money on projects to design a new bathtub and
make clothing from sheet metal.
   But Livingston L. Biddle, who drafted the legislation that
created the arts endowment in 1965 and served as NEA chairman under
President Carter, said ``there has been nothing in my experience
like the firestorm that erupted'' over Mapplethorpe and Serrano.
   Biddle is confident the Helms controversy won't inhibit the
endowment's nurturing of artistic freedom, but he sees an
affirmation of John Milton's warning that freedom involves
responsibility.
   ``What has emerged is a cautionary signal to the endowment that
it must be alert to difficulties that could arise from the
extremely controversial,'' said Biddle.
   ``We're all pretty worried about censorship,'' said Deborah
Butterfield, a Bozeman, Mont., sculptor who serves on an endowment
oversight panel on the visual arts.
   ``I think it's vital to preserve the voices that threaten people
like Mr. Helms,'' she said. ``The purpose of art is to make people
look at things in a different way, to solve problems in a creative
way. That is not necessarily comfortable for those in power.''
   Richard Andrews, director of the University of Washington's
Henry Art Gallery in Seattle, said the ``really diabolical effect
of the Helms amendment'' will be its inhibiting influence on
artists rather than endowment bureaucrats.
   In closing House debate on the issue last week, Rep. Fred
Grandy, R-Iowa, himself a former actor on television's ``The Love
Boat,'' said he hoped his colleagues weren't getting into the
business of defining ``what is good taste and what is bad taste''
in the arts.
   Grandy noted mischievously that the current production of a
local, NEA-supported theater includes what he called ``transvestism
and implied lesbian love.''
   The play, he said, is Shakespeare's ``Twelfth Night,'' appearing
at the Folger Shakespeare Theater.

<HEAD>Head of Solidarity Caucus Urges Faster Pace of Changes</HEAD>

   Solidarity's parliamentary leader Monday
urged faster changes in the mass media and ``depoliticizing'' the
army and police.
   ``The state, which was monopolized by one party, now is becoming
the property of the nation,'' said Bronislaw Geremek, assessing the
record of change 100 days after the seating of the first freely
elected parliament in Poland's postwar history and the coming to
power of a Solidarity-led government last month.
   Geremek, chairman of the Citizens Parliamentary Club that
comprises 161 parliament deputies and 98 senators from Solidarity,
said that although changes enacted so far are on a ``historic
scale,'' they still are ``too little compared to what society
wants.''
   Geremek and Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki _ the East bloc's
first non-Communist government leader _ are longtime co-activists
in the Solidarity movement. But the parliamentary leader appeared
willing to criticize Mazowiecki's government in some areas.
   For instance, he said not enough changes have been made in state
television and radio. Mazowiecki's appointee to head the state
Radio-Television Committee, Andrzej Drawicz, has been on the job
for two weeks.
   ``We have the right to expect acceleration of the process ... of
making lies disappear from the radio and television screens,''
Geremek said, apparently dissatisfied that only three newscasters
prominently associated with Communist Party propaganda have been
transferred to off-screen jobs.
   Mazowiecki and Drawicz have stressed they want to avoid ``witch
hunts'' and political purges, demanding only that employees display
competence and loyalty to the new government.
   Geremek said, however, that there still needs to be a
psychological and political ``break'' in the personnel and style of
news presentation.
   He also blamed the government for ``insufficient'' information
on its decisions and explaining its decisions to the public.
   Noting that Mazowiecki had stressed the need for his government
to be led by ``truth,'' Geremek said: ``We think there is still a
lot to be done in this field.''
   Geremek said at a news conference that old habits persist within
the government apparatus ``contrary to the government's
intentions.'' He cited a recent decision to exempt collective farms
from an increase in diesel fuel prices, following the communist
tradition of giving them preferential treatment.
   ``If we don't manage to overcome the routine of the system and
those old, constantly repeated ways of governing, then even the
best programs may turn out to be impossible,'' he said.
   ``The process of freeing the system from one-party monopoly
concerns also ... the army and police,'' Geremek said.
   He noted that Defense Minister Gen. Florian Siwicki and Interior
Minister Gen. Czeslaw Kiszczak, both communists, both agreed to
``the necessity of de-politicizing'' their departments.
   ``Those two great structures of the government should be freed
from the monopoly on one party,'' said Geremek, referring to the
practice of Communist Party committees within the army and police
influencing decision-making.
   Geremek also said a public debate would be launched into whether
judges should remain members of political parties.
   He also said consultations are taking place among parliamentary
groups aimed at early passage of a constitutional amendment
removing the clause that mandates that the Communist Party have the
leading government role.
   The proposed amendment, which already is supported by Communist
Party deputies, could be taken up by the Sejm, the lower house of
parliament, Geremek said.

<HEAD>Italian Fashion Bursts Out in Color</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MILAN, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After many a drab season, Italian designers
are bursting out in color again for the spring and summer of 1990.
   For the new ready-to-wear collections being shown this week,
Milanese designers have looked beyond the city shades of gray,
black and brown to the bright colors of a Mediterranean holiday:
sea blue, pine green, orange, lemon, coral and fuchsia.
   No one is better at the color game than Gianni Versace, who
despite more than 10 years in staid Milan, has never lost the
hot-blooded flare of his native Calabria, in southern Italy.
   Versace, who presented his new collection Sunday evening, went
all out with his palette for next year's warmer weather, combining
a multitude of shades into beautiful silk prints for skirts, pants,
jackets and dresses alike. His gaily printed jump suits in posh
silk fabric are sure to be a big hit this summer.
   The daring shape of his clothes _ his skirts are known to be so
short and tight they barely cover the hips _ and his penchant for
theatrical styles has made him a favorite both in Hollywood and
among rock stars.
   His new collection is not as sexy as past seasons, but there is
enough gold and glitz to satisfy even the most demanding
entertainer.
   Not only are his styles vivid, but they are adorned with
hundreds of gold balls, tassels and colorful crystals. As if that
weren't enough he sticks on a fringe here and there, and decorates
his shoes with gold studs.
   It is a strong statement, but Versace's exquisite tailoring and
artisitic sense keep it on this side of a fashion circus.
   Among the new styles: high waisted silk pants with one leg slit
up to the hip, mini lingerie dresses in bright shades of teffeta,
bra tops and bustiers encrusted in colorful crystals, silk printed
lapels on man tailored jackets, fringed piano shawls to drape over
the shoulders or tie around the hips.
   Another champion of a colorful spring-summer 1990 was Missoni,
whose new show presented at the Milan trade fair Monday combines
checks and polka dots in carefree silk sun dresses and pinafores to
be worn over crisp white linen dresses.
   For next season, his famous sweaters will be in zig-zag crochet.
The new Missoni jacket is hip length and reversible, with one side
in quilted fabric and the other a bulky striped knit.
   Also Monday, Keith Varty for Byblos chose a summer palette of
rich browns, which appeared in floral prints and solids mixed with
white, sienna, amethyst ruby and violet.
   The bright shades were to be found in the naval theme which ran
throughout the collection with its gaily colored nautical flags,
gold braiding, exaggerated emblems, and bold red and blue stripes.

<HEAD>Plan to Control Ivory Sales is not Working</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A meeting on wildlife trade opened
Monday with the admission that a plan to control ivory sales is not
working and African elephant populations are suffering an alarming
decline.
   Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands told 800 delegates and
observers at a 10-day session of the Convention on International
Trade in Endangered Species that supporters of the ivory quota
system ``must admit that it has failed to control the illegal ivory
trade.''
   Bernhard, president of the World Wide Fund for Nature, warned
delegates of alarming census reports. ``You must give benefit of
the doubt to the survival of the species,'' he said.
   The convention issued an infractions report detailing how
African countries, especially Zaire and Gabon, had flouted
non-ivory wildlife trade restrictions.
   The report also singled out Argentina, Spain, Japan and
Thailand, among others, for failing to comply with convention
regulations on other species. It mentioned only the most flagrant
abuses, it said, indicating widespread problems in policing
international trade.
   A separate report dealt with ivory, the heart of the wildlife
trade issue.
   Delegates from 103 convention nations must decide whether to
leave elephants under their present designation as threatened
species or list them as an endangered species, which would force a
ban on ivory trade.
   Ivory fetches more than $150 a pound on world markets.
   The United States, Canada and the 12-nation European Economic
Community halted imports in June.
   Zimbabwe, South Africa and Botswana argue that careful
management has increased their elephant herds and entitles them to
sell tusks to finance their game reserves. Zimbabwe says it earns
$9 million a year by selling ivory from herds estimated at 52,000.
   But East African states say herds have been reduced
continent-wide from 1.3 million in a decade to just more than
600,000 and can only be protected by a ban that applies to the
entire continent.
   In July, Kenya burned 2,500 poached ivory tusks worth $3 million
to draw attention to the slaughter of elephants across the
continent. Kenya's population had declined from 65,000 in the 1970s
to about 17,000 today.
   Environmentalists say poachers kill at least 70,000 elephants a
year and that poorer nations such as Kenya and do not have the
resources to stop well-armed poachers, many of whom come from
neighboring countries.
   Connie Harriman, a U.S. assistant secretary of the interior and
head of the American delegation, said a partial ban would ``create
a loophole which would allow continued illegal trade. We have no
flexibility.''
   Other delegates agreed, suggesting that Eastern Africa might
muster the required two-thirds majority to change the elephants'
status to endangered.
   But others rallied around Southern Africa. ``We must respect the
Africans' wishes,'' said Kiyohiko Arafune of the Japanese
delegation, which favors limited ivory trade.
   Convention Secretary-General Eugene Lapointe suggested a split
listing that would ban trade where elephant populations are at risk
but allow quotas for South Africa, Zimbabwe and Botswana.
   The World Wide Fund for Nature and the International Union for
the Conservation of Nature backed a ban but left room for maneuver.
   ``We would support a split listing with a moratorium to gain
time,'' said Tom Milliken of TRAFFIC, an enforcement group
associated with the conservation groups. ``The alternative is to
back Southern Africa to the wall, so they file reservations and
open the door to abuse.''
   The convention's rulings are non-legally binding agreements that
rely on international pressure for enforcement. Convention members
are allowed to file a so-called reservation to bypass guidelines
for an individual species.
   The position of the conservation groups was met by anger from a
range of other environmentalist groups, mostly from the United
States, that have lobbied for an immediate ban.
   ``We should stand together on what is necessary and let
governments do the compromising,'' said Sue Lieberman of the Humane
Society of the United States. ``It's incredible when official U.S.
and British positions are stronger than some environmentalists'.''
   Greenpeace spokesman Andrew Davis said: ``The compromise
approach has meant the death of hundreds of thousands of African
elephants. ``Only a total ban with a really concerted effort to
shut down the markets can save the elephants.''
   Simon Lyster, head of the World Wide Fund for Nature's 19-person
delegation, said: ``Our objective is a total ban but we are not
wedded to the mechanism.''
   He blamed individual nations for a gross failure to enforce
regulation and said the convention lacked the resources to fulfill
its mandate. Lyster also said that even a total ban would not be
enough.
   ``We must make the wearing of ivory, using of ivory, as socially
unacceptable as wearing a cheetah-skin coat,'' he said.

<HEAD>Anti-Apartheid Leaders Say President Must Take Bold Steps</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President F.W. de Klerk must
present plans this week for the swift abolition of apartheid or
face intensified international pressure, three anti-apartheid
church leaders said Monday.
   The clergymen _ Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the Rev. Allan
Boesak and the Rev. Frank Chikane _ are scheduled to meet with de
Klerk in Pretoria on Wednesday. It will be de Klerk's first meeting
with prominent anti-apartheid leaders since he took office in
mid-August.
   The church leaders said Boesak, president of the World Alliance
of Reformed Churches, will attend the summit of Commonwealth
leaders Oct. 18 in Malaysia, and Chikane, general secretary of the
South African Council of Churches, will travel soon to Canada.
   ``Before they go, we want to hear from Mr. de Klerk personally
his response to the demands of our people, whether he persists in
his refusal to talk to the African National Congress, and what
concrete steps he intends to take within the next six months to
abolish apartheid and introduce a non-racial democracy,'' their
statement said.
   De Klerk has offered to negotiate a new consitution in five
years that would extend political rights to the black majority, but
he has vowed not to negotiate with leaders of the outlawed ANC
guerrilla movement until they renounce violence.
   Also Sunday, government television reported that Tutu's son,
Trevor Tutu, was arrested after he threatened to ``activate a
device'' on an aircraft.
   Tutu was returning to Johannesburg and asked to get off the
plane as it made a brief stop in the southern city of East London,
the South African Broadcasting Corp. reported.
   When he was refused permission, he allegedly pushed crew members
out of his way and went into the terminal building, then threatened
to ``activate a device'' in his luggage, the report said.
   In August, the 32-year-old Tutu was given an 18-month suspended
sentence for making a false bomb threat at Johannesburg's airport.
At that time, Tutu said he deliberately courted arrest as part of a
publicity stunt for his advertising agency.
   Tutu also has been convicted of five additional charges stemming
from two other confrontations with police.
   His father has not commented on his legal troubles.

   The countdown for this week's
planned launch of space shuttle Atlantis began Monday as NASA
headed for a court showdown with anti-nuclear activists seeking to
stop the flight because of its plutonium-powered payload.
   If a federal judge approves, Atlantis is to blast off at 1:29
p.m. Thursday with five astronauts who are to dispatch the Galileo
spacecraft with its nuclear generators on the start of a six-year
journey to Jupiter.
   A band of 25 protesters demonstrated Monday at the Kennedy Space
Center, played out a mock death scene, and vowed that if they are
turned down by the court, they will sit on the launch pad if
necessary to halt the launch.
   Attorneys for the space agency and three citizens' groups are to
present oral arguments Tuesday before U.S. District Judge Oliver
Gasch in Washington.
   The launch opponents contend that an explosion on liftoff could
spread cancer-causing plutonium over a large area of east-central
Florida.
   NASA officials argue the two nuclear generators aboard the
Galileo spacecraft have been thoroughly tested and that flying them
poses minimal health and environmental risks. Similar devices have
flown on 22 other U.S. spacecraft without a problem.
   ``We're going to count down to a launch on Thursday unless we
are told to stop,'' NASA test director Ron Phelps said Monday as
the countdown got under way. He described Atlantis as in ``terrific
shape.''
   The astronauts assigned to the mission flew here Monday from
their training base in Houston for final flight preparations. All
five have said they are not worried about the plutonium in the
cargo bay.
   ``My family is going to be down there watching the launch, as
well as other people that I love, and so I'm not concerned about
it; I feel it's safe,'' said Ellen Baker, one of the crew members.
   The others are commander Donald Williams, pilot Mike McCulley,
Franklin Chang-Diaz and Shannon Lucid.
   The protesters began their demonstration Monday with a mock
countdown that ended with a woman spreading in the air dust-like
particles representing plutonium. The participants all fell to the
ground in make-believe death.
   ``We're going to attempt to put people of the launch pad if the
court doesn't prevent the launch,'' Bruce Gagnon, one of the
protest leaders, told reporters.
   Gagnon would not disclose how the demonstraters would breach
security to reach the pad, but he said the effort, to be made
``Wednesday or Thursday, or both,'' would be non-violent. He is
coordinator for the Florida Coalition for Peace and Justice, one of
the three groups that sued.
   More than 200 security guards armed with M-16 assault rifles and
semiautomatic 9mm pistols will patrol the 140,000-acre space center
to stop infiltrators, and the center also will be guarded by
helicopters and boats.
   But there is only a 10-minute launch window available on
Thursday, and NASA is concerned the time would be consumed if
protesters penetrate the launch danger zone with a boat, plane or
on foot in the final minutes of the countdown.

<HEAD>Soviet Legislature Passes First Strike Law</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Legislators on Monday gave Soviet workers the
legal right to strike, the first such measure in the nation's
history.
   Following a daylong debate, the Supreme Soviet legislature
passed the complex measure that bans strikes by workers in almost a
dozen sectors, but also provides other workers with a legal
framework under which to strike.
   The Soviet Union's need for a such a labor law became urgent
this summer, when hundreds of thousands of coal miners went on
strike for better working conditions and political change.
   Stoppages based on ethnic conflicts also have become
commonplace, with thousands of Russian workers in Moldavia and
Estonia walking out recently to protest laws they viewed as
disciminatory.
   Although they were not expressly forbidden by Soviet law, the
few strikes that broke out in recent years were brutally
suppressed. President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms opened the
door to louder labor demands, and he backed the law that will
provide labor conflicts a legal framework.
   Only 12 Supreme Soviet deputies of more than 400 voted against
the strike bill, with 10 members abstaining, Tass reported.
   The news agency said the law prohibits strikes that ``create a
threat to people's lives and health,'' as well as work stoppages by
workers in railroads, public transportation, civil aviation,
communications, energy, defense, government bodies, law enforcement
and round-the-clock production industries.
   It also forbids strikes ``connected with the putting forth of
demands for a violent overthrow or change of the government or
social system, and also demands involving the violation of ethnic
or racial equality,'' Tass said.
   In order to hold a legal strike, a union must first give a
``conciliatory commission'' made up of representatives of both
labor and management five days to attempt to resolve the dispute.
If that fails, the sides must give arbitration seven days to work
things out. Only then, with all other options exhausted, does it
have the right to strike.
   Deputies to the Supreme Soviet, the Soviet legislature that was
a mere rubber stamp until Gorbachev's reforms gave it real power,
contested many of the law's provisions Monday and voted on some 50
proposed amendments.
   Human rights activist Andrei D. Sakharov called for some type of
acceptable political strike to be written into the law, but his
proposal was defeated on a procedural technicality, Tass reported.
   Several deputies complained that too many sectors were
prohibited from striking. Under the new law, those sectors can
appeal to the Supreme Soviet with their complaints.
   The law comes on the heels of an emergency measure passed by the
Supreme Soviet on Oct. 3 banning strikes until the general law
could be passed.
   The coal strikes last summer, which paralyzed much of the
country's crucial coal industry and were stemmed only after the
government conceded on virtually all the miners' demands, appeared
to be the greatest crisis Gorbachev had faced in more than four
years.
   Although he expressed sympathy for the miners, he has said
repeatedly such strikes could lead to anarchy and an economic crash
for the Soviet Union.

<TEXT>
   Bahamanian Prime Minister Lynden Pindling, at
odds with NBC over allegations about drug smuggling, has canceled a
Wednesday appearance on the network's ``Today'' show to discuss the
libel lawsuit he dropped.
   Pindling on Friday accused the network of violating an agreement
by announcing earlier in the day that he had dropped his lawsuit,
filed in Toronto in 1984, against NBC and correspondent Brian Ross.
   The $4 million lawsuit, which also named as defendants 16
Canadian cable and communications companies, stemmed from ``NBC
Nightly News'' broadcasts in 1983 and 1984 about a cocaine cartel
NBC said was operating in the Bahamas.
   The broadcasts quoted U.S. authorities as saying the cocaine
operation was protected by payoffs to Bahamanian officials.
   Pindling, whom NBC said repeatedly declined requests for
interviews before dropping his lawsuit, has denied NBC's
allegations that he was among those officials.
   In a statement Friday in which he said Pindling received neither
money nor an apology from NBC for the broadcasts, NBC News
President Michael Gartner said NBC was delighted that Pindling
dropped his lawsuit.
   ``This is a complete vindication of our journalism,'' he said.
   Pindling later charged that NBC's statements violated a
confidentiality agreement on the lawsuit and distorted the terms
under which it was dropped. NBC denied both accusations Friday and
again Monday.
   Pindling may reinstate the Canadian court lawsuit, and a lawsuit
in U.S. courts ``hasn't been ruled out,'' his spokesman, William
Kalis, said Monday.
   Pindling was to appear on ``Today'' ``to discuss in general
terms the (Friday) settlement,'' Kalis said from Nassau. But he
canceled ``when NBC abrogated the settlement,'' he said.
   In an interview made before Friday's developments and broadcast
Sunday on CBS' ``60 Minutes,'' Pindling said he first sued NBC in
his own country's courts and ``won the case by default'' because
NBC didn't respond.
   Kalis said no money was awarded in that case.
   After that, Pindling said in the CBS broadcast, ``I decided to
sue in a neutral jurisdiction,'' referring to Canada.
   The matter of reinstating Pindling's lawsuit is being discussed
by his attorneys, Kalis said. But because Monday was a holiday _
Thanksgiving _ in Canada, he said, ``there probably won't be a
decision until tomorrow.''

   A cyst removed from President Bush's right
middle finger was benign, a spokeswoman said Monday.
   The results of the pathological examination were relayed to Bush
as he concluded a three-day weekend at Camp David, the presidential
retreat in Maryland's Catoctin Mountains.
   Returning to the White House, Bush sported a white bandage on
his finger. He smilingly declined to talk with reporters.
   The cyst was removed during a 25-minute surgical procedure
Friday at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, with Bush receiving a
local anesthetic.
   ``The pathology report is (that it is) benign,'' said press aide
Laura Melillo. Physicians had said earlier they did not believe the
growth was cancerous.
   The eight stitches required to close the 1{-inch incision are
expected to remain in place for two weeks. Bush, who is
left-handed, also was told to wear a finger splint for two to three
weeks.
   The growth, measuring one centimeter in diamater, had bothered
Bush for several years.

<TEXT>
   Arab League mediators struggled Monday
to salvage a peace plan aimed at ending Lebanon's civil war, and
one of the Lebanese lawmakers gathered for negotiations said they
were making headway.
   Saeb Salam, a Sunni Moslem, said the three-man Arab League
committee was trying ``to devise a mechanism that would guarantee''
implementation of the peace plan.
   Lebanon's 33 Christian and 30 Moslem parliament members have
been meeting in this Saudi resort since Sept. 30 to try to end
their nation's 14-year-old war.
   Hard-line Christian deputies who owe allegiance to Maronite
Catholic leader Gen. Michel Aoun are demanding guarantees that
Syria pull out its 40,000 troops from Lebanon before they will
cooperate.
   The demand has blocked parliament sessions for four days, and
the Arab League committee sought help from Arab and other powers,
including the United States, the Soviet Union and France.
   ``The contacts of the tripartite committee are moving very
well,'' Salam told reporters in Taif.
   The members of the committee are King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, King
Hassan II of Morocco and President Chadli Bendjedid of Algeria.
   Salam did not elaborate but said the deputies and the mediators
were ``doing everything to make the conference succeed.''
   The 87-year-old deputy declared tearfully that ``I affirm to my
brothers in Lebanon that success is inevitable and failure is
forbidden.''
   Moslem legislators who support the Syrians want more power in
Lebanon's Christian-dominated government.
   Under the peace plan presented by the Arab mediators,
sectarianism would be abolished gradually as law and order were
restored.
   Syrian forces in Beirut would be withdrawn over two years and
relocated in the Bekaa Valley in eastern Lebanon; a full pullout
would follow a security pact between Beirut and Damascus.
   The Christians want the Syrians out within six months, but many
Moslems insist there can be no withdrawal until the Maronites agree
to surrender some of the power they have held since Lebanon's
independence from France in 1943.
   Under an unwritten covenant, the president has always been a
Maronite Catholic, the prime minister a Sunni Moslem and the
parliament speaker a Shiite.
   At independence, the Christians were considered the majority,
but Moslems now make up an estimated 55 percent of the 4 million
population.
   In Beirut, the An-Nahar newspaper reported that the Arab League
committee was pressing the Lebanese legislators to meet deadlines
it has set for elections.
   The daily said the committee proposed Oct. 25 as the date for a
parliament session in Beirut to elect a speaker, with another
session soon afterward to endorse reforms agreed to in Taif.
   Parliament would reconvene Nov. 5 to elect a new president, the
newspaper said.
   The latest round of fighting in Lebanon began in March when Aoun
launched a ``war of liberation'' against the Syrians. Six months of
fierce artillery battles killed more than 900 people before a
cease-fire brokered by the Arab League took hold Sept. 22.
   The Syrian troops moved into Lebanon in 1976, the year after the
civil war broke out, under an Arab League peacekeeping mandate.
   Aoun alleges the Syrians lost their mandate by openly siding
with the Moslems.

<TEXT>
   President Ranasinghe Premadasa has
invited the Red Cross to send officials to Sri Lanka to help ease
the conflict between Sinhalese rebels and the government, an
official statement said Monday.
   A statement issued by the presidential secretariat said the Red
Cross officials will help trace missing persons, visit detention
centers and provide relief to people affected by violence.
   The invitation follows charges by human rights groups that
pro-government vigilante organizations are responsible for a wave
of killings, mostly of young Sinhalese men believed to be
sympathizers of radicals.
   The government has denied the charges and blames the radicals
for most of the 5,000 deaths reported since the Sinhalese extremist
movement began in July 1987.
   In its latest violence report Monday, the government reported 43
killings. The victims included 16 young Sinhalese men found dead in
the spot where the People's Liberation Front, a Sinhalese extremist
group, ambushed an army patrol last week.
   The government blamed ``vigilantes,'' who they said were
outraged by attacks on government troops, for the 16 killings.
   Officials also blamed vigilantes for killing three men whose
bodies were found Monday at Moratuwa, 11 miles south of Colombo.
   All 19 victims died of gunshot wounds, military officials said.
They estimated the victims' ages at between 18 and 30.
   Thirteen Sinhalese extremists were shot and killed during a
series of government operations in the past 24 hours against the
People's Liberation Front in central and southern Sri Lanka, the
government said.
   The communique, issued by the government's information
department, said large quantities or arms and ammunition were
recovered in the operations.
   Members of the Sinhalese front killed 11 civilians in the past
24 hours, the military officials said. They said most of the
victims were officials or supporters of the government.
   The front has been attacking the Sinhalese-dominated government
for two years, since the government agreed to an accord designed to
give greater autonomy to Sri Lanka's Tamil minority.
   The People's Liberation Front espouses Marxism but increasingly
has taken up a banner of ultranationalism for the Sinhalese, who
are mostly Buddhists and comprise 75 percent of the country's 16
million people.
   Tamils, who account for 18 percent of the population, are mainly
Hindus, and began fighting six years ago for an independent
homeland.
   Predominantly Hindu India, spurred by its own Tamil minority,
tried to broker an agreement to end Sinhalese-Tamil violence but
instead got bogged down in its own war with Tamil guerrillas when
it tried to disarm them.

   Film canisters with hundreds of negatives of eye
retinas were found and returned to the photographer Monday, ending
a two-day search after they were stolen from a car, police said.
   Recovery of the canisters, which were in a briefcase stolen from
the photographer's car, means patients won't have to have the
photographs retaken, said a spokeswoman from the Massachusetts Eye
and Ear Infirmary.
   The photographer had told police thieves broke into her car and
took the radio and her briefcase Saturday morning.
   Joan Burke of Boston found the canisters near her driveway, said
Officer Denise Schoener.
   Burke called the photographer, Christine Kiernan, Schoener said.
Police are still investigating the robbery, because not all the
missing items have been found.
   Hospital spokewoman Regina Kilfoyle said the film had been
developed and was in fine condition.
   The pictures are made by injecting dye into the body, which
causes small veins in the eye to glow fluorescently, making it
easier to diagnose problems.

<TEXT>
   The United States will continue producing new
chemical weapons over a 10-year period even if it signs an
international treaty to abolish all poison gas stockpiles, an
administration official said Monday.
   The text of the treaty being negotiated by about 40 nations in
Geneva proposes that all production be stopped immediately and that
the plants be rendered inoperable.
   However, the administration will seek modifications to ensure
that it can keep its stockpiles up to date even as it scales them
down, said the official, who declined to be identified.
   President Bush, in a Sept. 25 speech to the United Nations, said
that once a global treaty is signed the United States will destroy
98 percent of its chemical weapons over an eight-year period, if
the Soviet Union takes idetical action.
   Bush said the remaining stockpiles would be destroyed over the
next two years, if ``all nations capable of building chemical
weapons sign that total ban treaty.''
   The U.S. stockpile consists of ``unitary'' weapons, many of
which are leaking and deemed unsafe, and newer ``binary'' weapons
that use two components to make them lethal.
   Congress has instructed the administration to destroy the
unitary weapons as the newer binary weapons are produced.
   ``You don't want to get eight years down the road and have only
unitary, leaking old weapons left,'' the official said. ``As long
as you're going to have any, you ought to try to make sure the ones
you have are as safe as possible.''
   The official said the U.S. intention of continuing to produce
the weapons during the phaseout period was made known to Soviet
Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze during talks last month in
Wyoming with Secretary of State James A. Baker III.

   A rundown Lutheran Church in a shabby section of
East Berlin has become the rallying point for once-disparate
opposition groups aiming for historic reforms in their communist
homeland.
   Outside Gethsemane Church, there were violent clashes in recent
days as police moved in to crush peaceful protests for democratic
reform. Public support for change has swelled in the city and other
parts of East Germany in recent weeks.
   Nationwide protests the past three days have been the largest
since 1953, when Soviet tanks helped put down a popular uprising.
   The wave of unrest came as the communist government held
elaborately choreographed state ceremonies marking the nation's
40th anniversary.
   Like St. Brygida's Church in Gdansk, which became the focal
point of Solidarity activities in Poland, the weathered 19th
century Gethsemane Church is a magnet for activists to discuss
strategy and political platforms.
   ``We come here because we want peaceful change and because there
is nowhere else where we can find sanctuary,'' said an East Berlin
human rights activist in her 20s.
   The church became the center for dissidents after protesters
began a vigil and fast last week for imprisoned activists.
   When police charge protesters to disperse them, hundreds flee to
the legal sanctuary of the fenced-in church grounds.
   Scores of others often spend the night inside, fearing they will
be arrested if they attempt to leave.
   Although the Lutheran Church in East Germany has long pursued an
uneasy policy of coexistence with the state, it has also provided a
haven for independent human rights and ecology groups.
   Its leadership has urged the government to enter into a dialogue
with dissident groups, and many pastors have become increasing
vocal in their criticism of the hardline leadership's rejection of
reforms.
   Thousands of supporters stream to the red-brick Gethsemane
Church each day to hold rallies and to learn of the latest
developments from the growing opposition network around the country.
   Hundreds of candles glitter at the entrance to show solidarity
with those arrested and imprisoned in demonstrations across the
country.
   Banners calling for peace and freedom flap from the church's
scaffolded steeple. Pastors scurry about, helping with logistics
and urging those assembled to avoid violence.
   Activists standing on the chipped concrete steps pass plastic
buckets around to collect donations for opposition causes.
   Hardline communist authorities have deployed hundreds of
security officials surrounding the church to prevent groups from
heading to main thoroughfares. They fear the daily rallies will
snowball into mass demonstrations like those that erupted over last
weekend.
   Uniformed police officers check the identity papers of those
attempting to reach the church.
   The area has been declared off-limits to Western television
crews and news photographers since Sunday. Western reporters were
refused access again Monday.
   East Germany's opposition movement has long been plagued by
intense government suppression. Security officials routinely
harrass its members, and emerging leaders have been frequently
expelled to West Germany.
   The groups have been fractious and small and, until recently,
were only able to achieve a loose countrywide network. Many began
as ecological and peace discussion groups.
   But the groups have become increasing bolder, buoyed by reforms
in the Soviet Union, Poland and Hungary.
   Growing frustration over the government's intransigence to
change and the recent exodus of tens of thousands of East Germans
to West Germany has also spurred many pro-democracy supporters to
broader public activism.
   Last week, seven pro-democracy and rights groups signed a joint
declaration saying they would work together so that ``all East
Germans have the right to exercise their political rights.''
   ``We have a duty to demand from the state and party leadership
that they restore the people's confidence in the government,'' said
Werner Fischer, a founder of one of East Germany's oldest human
rights groups.

   Two University of California cancer
researchers won the Nobel Prize in medicine Monday and immediately
reaped the perquisites of success: box seats at the National League
baseball playoffs.
   ``We're off to the game _ just got tickets,'' a jubilant J.
Michael Bishop said shortly after he and Harold E. Varmus learned
that they had won this year's prize.
   The 50-member Nobel Assembly of the Karolinska Institute,
Sweden's largest and oldest medical university, cited Bishop and
Varmus for their discovery that cancer genes in certain viruses are
altered forms of normal animal genes.
   The research helped scientists understand how cancer begins, and
it ``widened our insight into the complicated signal systems which
govern the normal growth of cells,'' the assembly said.
   Varmus called the research a ``cornerstone in understanding the
genetic mosaic of cancer.''
   ``The basic idea that we helped establish is that cancer has its
origins in genes that normally do us some good. But after they
become abnormal through mutation, they cause a role in cancer,'' he
said.
   The two scienists are colleagues at the University of California
School of Medicine in San Francisco. They originally published
their prize-winning findings in 1976.
   Bishop said winning the award was ``surreal,'' while Varmus it
was startling when the telephone began ringing at 4 a.m.
   ``We just assumed one of the grandparents had some trouble, so
we were frightened,'' he said.
   But his alarm quickly turned to exultation, especially when the
$469,000 award _ to be split between the two _ began paying off in
unexpected ways.
   When reporters swarmed to his home early in the morning, Varmus
had said he only wished he could use the Nobel money to buy tickets
to the sold-out championship game between the San Francisco Giants
and the Chicago Cubs at Candlestick Park.
   A short time later, he received four free tickets compliments of
the San Francisco Examiner, U.C. spokesman Robert Sanders said.
Bishop already had his own tickets.
   At a news conference at the University of California Medical
Center, Bishop and Varmus were optimistic about the practical
applications of their work, how it helps understand the nature of
cancer and possibly some aspects of the AIDS virus.
   But they were cautious about forecasting a cancer cure in the
foreseeable future.
   ``This is just another step in what's a long journey,'' Bishop
said. ``It's very difficult to predict when a full view of the
cancer cell will be at hand.''
   Although Varmus stressed that he and Bishop ``stand on the
shoulders of those who came before us,'' at least one scientist
said he resented carrying their weight.
   Dr. Dominique Stehelin, a French researcher who carried out
experiments overseen by Bishop and Varmus at San Francisco in the
1970s, said it was ``very unfair and rotten'' that he wasn't
included in the prize.
   ``I did the work all by myself, from A to Z,'' Stehelin told the
French news agency Agence France-Presse.
   Bishop and Varmus called Stehelin's work ``crucial'' to their
research, but referred questions about the prize to the Nobel
committee.
   ``We didn't nominate each other,'' Varmus said.
   ``You may know you're in the running, but nevertheless, there
are a lot of other good people in there too. ... It's a shock,''
said Varmus, dressed casually in blue jeans and a red and white
striped shirt, and a light beard that was apparently the result of
a hasty shaving job.
   Varmus, 49, who once hoped to become an English professor, said
he abandoned his studies of 17th century literature to attend
medical school. He said he switched fields after learning that
writer Gertrude Stein had enrolled at Johns Hopkins Medical School
after being told that ``medicine opens all doors.''
   Gradually, he discovered he enjoyed being in the laboratory more
than the clinic, and his research career began, he said.
   ``My mother died of breast cancer, but I don't know if that in
itself caused me to study the cause of cancer. ... There's hardly
anybody in this room who is not touched by cancer somehow,'' Varmus
said.
   Bishop, 53, said he was interested in science in high school,
and decided to become a doctor. But he said that ``by the time I
finished college, I wasn't so sure I wanted to be a doctor.''
   It was a rural Pennsylvania general practioner, Robert Kough,
who became his mentor and convinced him that his calling was in
medical research.
   Both Bishop and Varmus said they plan to return to the lab, and
they don't expect their lives to be dramatically altered by the
Nobel Prize.
   ``I like my life the way it is, and I hope it stays that way,''
Varmus said. ``The danger is you're supposed to be smarter today
than you were yesterday, and I'm not.''

   Pope John Paul II began a visit to the
world's most populous Moslem nation Monday with a message of
friendship and assurances that his Roman Catholic flock was loyal
to Indonesia.
   In an atmosphere of controversy over a scheduled stop in East
Timor, a predominantly Catholic former Portuguese territory annexed
by Indonesia in 1976, John Paul sought to make clear that Catholics
were no threat to the archipelago's unity.
   ``I have come as a friend to all Indonesians, with a great
respect for all the people of this dynamic nation,'' he said.
   A tropical rainstorm drenched the city of nearly 8 million as
the pope arrived after a 7-hour flight from Seoul, South Korea.
John Paul knelt and kissed the wet tarmac in sticky, 90-degree heat.
   Soldiers lined the 10-mile motorcade route from the military
airport to the presidential palace, set in a ring of palm trees. He
was greeted by President Suharto, Indonesia's pro-Western leader.
   There have been reports of several threats to the pontiff's life
by Moslem extremists in this nation of 13,766 islands and about 200
ethnic and religious groups. John Paul sought to make clear that
his visit, and the 5 million Catholics among Indonesia's 157
million Moslems, pose no threat.
   During a Mass at a sports stadium built by the Soviets under
President Sukarno, who led Indonesia to independence from the
Netherlands in 1949, John Paul expressed ``cordial esteem'' to
``our Moslem brothers and sisters, who are so numerous in this
country.''
   ``I extend the hand of sincere and heartfelt friendship in our
common belief in the one God, our creator and merciful Lord,'' he
said, speaking in English.
   John Paul said Catholic Indonesians were deeply proud of their
country.
   ``We must be fully Catholic and fully Indonesian,'' he said.
``These words are deeply inscribed in the modern history of the
nation.''
   In an exchange of speeches with Suharto at an evening reception,
the pope touched lightly on the issue of human rights, stressing
that respect for individual rights is essential for the unity of a
nation.
   Suharto said, ``Men should seek to share identical things and
not to aggravate differences among them.''
   Portugal has criticized the stop in East Timor, scheduled for
Thursday, but John Paul says the visit does not imply Vatican
recognition of the Indonesian takeover.
   He told reporters on the trip from Seoul that skipping the
island would be an ``offense'' to East Timor's Catholics, who the
Vatican says number nearly 80 percent of the 690,000 people.
   The pope is scheduled to leave Indonesia on Saturday for the
island nation of Mauritius in the Indian Ocean, and return to Rome
two days later.

<HEAD>Real Estate Firm With Ties to HUD Closing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A real estate investment firm will close and
absorb a $675,000 loss rather than continue an association with its
manager _ a former federal housing official linked to recent
scandals at the department, New York Newsday reported Monday.
   Eagle Capital Ltd. is shutting down, but Joseph Monticciolo,
former New York regional administrator for HUD, will go to work at
other companies of the firm's founder, the newspaper quoted Eagle's
lawyer as saying.
   ``The partners just don't want to be involved in a situation
that has attracted so much publicity,'' lawyer Arnold Biegen said.
``These people are all prominent, respected businessmen. They have
fine reputations. They want to keep them that way.''
   Monticciolo, Housing and Urban Development regional
administrator from 1981 to 1988, testified in July before a House
subcommittee investigating allegations of mismanagement and
favoritism at HUD.
   Monticciolo testified that he earmarked large sums of HUD money
for developers who later became partners at Eagle Capital. ``I made
recommendations to Washington that ultimately benefited people who
are now partners of mine,'' he said.
   Eagle Capital paid Monticciolo $125,000 a year and gave him a 15
percent interest in the firm. Closing the firm is costing the nine
investors $675,000, Biegen said.
   Monticciolo's home telephone number in Woodbury is not listed.
Telephone calls to Monticciolo's investment firm, Woodbury
Associates Inc., went unanswered Monday, Yom Kippur and the day
Columbus Day was celebrated in New York.
   Biegen was not at his law office Monday and could not be reached
at home, said Michael Shef, another lawyer in the office. Eagle
Capital had an office in Manhattan, but there was no telephone
directory listing.
   Monticciolo will be transferred to the payroll of ``shopping
center companies'' owned by Eagle founder Sheldon Goldstein, Biegen
told Newsday. The newspaper did not say what Monticciolo's new
duties will be.
   Eagle Capital is canceling six consulting contracts with
developers who deal with HUD, Biegen told Newsday.
   Newsday said six people who later became partners in Eagle
Capital were part of an investment group that bought seven
apartment buildings from HUD in 1983 for $10.9 million, putting up
only $550,000.
   Goldstein headed a small investment group that made a profit of
about $17 million in a HUD deal while Monticciolo was with HUD.

<HEAD>Machinists Ask for Union Support as Boeing Strike Enters Day 6</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM COUR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Striking Boeing Machinists met with 25 other
labor unions Monday to ask for their support while their six-day
walkout against the airplane manufacturer dragged on with no signs
of new contract talks.
   ``We're here to brief the other unions to what our strike is all
about ... so we'll be prepared for monetary support and those types
of things if hardship needs arise,'' said Tom Baker, president of
the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers,
Local 751.
   The strike is affecting Boeing plants in the Seattle area;
Wichita, Kan.; Portland, Ore.; and several other sites.
   In Wichita, where Boeing Military Airplanes has its
headquarters, hundreds of strikers rallied Monday before joining
pickets for a peaceful show of force at plant gates. There was a
similar rally in Everett, Wash., where the popular 747s and 767s
are built.
   One Wichita hourly employee who has been crossing picket lines
reported his car was vandalized during the weekend. Local strike
coordinator Ray Briggs said the union doesn't sanction property
damage or injury and that there is no proof the vandalism happened
because of the strike.
   Baker dismissed the Teamsters' decision to cross picket lines,
saying that wouldn't affect the 57,800 striking Machinists' ability
to halt production at the world's largest commercial jet builder.
   Boeing officials were in a meeting Monday and did not
immediately return telephone calls from The Associated Press.
Federal mediator Doug Hammond left a recording on his answering
machine saying no talks were scheduled.
   Boeing has delivered two planes since the strike began
Wednesday. Before the strike, Boeing was committed to delivering 57
jets before the end of the year. Five consecutive years of record
orders have given the company a backlog that stretches into the
late 1990s.
   That backlog and the steady stream of overtime which employees
have been asked to work were behind Machinists' demand for better
wages and less overtime.
   Boeing earned $356 million on sales of $9.07 billion for the
first half of 1989, and had profits of $614 million on sales of
$16.96 billion in 1988.
   Boeing's offer featured an immediate wage hike of 4 percent with
3 percent raises in both 1990 and 1991, and annual bonuses of 8
percent of a worker's gross earnings this year and 3 percent in
1990. Mandatory overtime would be reduced from 200 hours per
quarter to 160 hours and the cost-of-living formula would be
improved to account for virtually all inflation.
   Boeing said a machinist in a middle skill grade, such as an
engine mechanic, could see pay go from $34,389 this year to $43,138
in 1992, counting seniority and cost-of-living increases, but
excluding $13,000 in bonuses and any overtime.
   The Machinists, who have seen bonuses but no increases in their
base wage for six years, said that was not enough.
   ``They need airplanes delivered and we want to get back and
deliver them. But we want our fair share and that's what we're
atempting to get,'' Baker said.
   It is the Machinists' first strike against Boeing since a 45-day
walkout in 1977.
   What happens at Boeing could affect labor talks at other
aerospace plants. Talks have been extended in a Machinists contract
that expired Sunday with Lockheed Corp. in Marietta, Ga. The
union's contract with McDonnell Douglas expires Oct. 22.

<HEAD>Drifter Pleads Guilty, Tells Authorities Where Body is Located</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MARINETTE, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An unemployed drifter pleaded guilty
Monday to kidnapping an 11-year-old girl and told authorities he
accidentally killed her nearly 2{ years ago and buried her in
Georgia.
   The plea by Charles Blassingame, 43, averted a trial scheduled
to begin Monday, but a prosecutor said more charges are possible in
the July 1987 disappearance of Tammy Lynn Maciulis.
   District Attorney Tim Duket said he does not believe
Blassingame's account of the child's death.
   ``The prosecution reserves the right to charge him with
first-degree or second-degree murder ... if in fact he takes us to
the body and through scientific or forensic evidence it can be
proven the death was not of an accidental nature,'' Duket said.
   Lawyers said the plea agreement calls for Blassingame to serve
25 years in prison on the kidnapping charge. If the body is not
located, Blassingame has agreed to plead guilty to an extortion
charge involving an unrelated incident and will serve an additional
six years in prison.
   Circuit Judge John Hoffmann accepted the agreement but delayed
sentencing until authorities search for the body. Blassingame
agreed to accompany officials to Georgia for the search, officials
said.
   Blassingame told authorities he accidentally struck and killed
Tammy with his car, then placed her body in a duffel bag, drove to
Georgia and buried her in woods near Dalton, Ga.
   The agreement was reached during negotiations over the weekend
between the defendant, defense attorney Royce Finne, Duket and
Marinette Police Chief Patrick Ravet, who said he, Lt. Jeff Skorik,
Blassingame and Finne will fly to Georgia on Tuesday to search for
Tammy's body.
   Authorities said they consulted with Tammy's mother, Phyllis
Nicklaus, and she had no objections to the plea agreement.
   Tammy Lynn disappeared from her mother's Marinette apartment in
July 1987, touching off a nationwide search.
   Blassingame was originally charged with kidnapping, enticing a
minor for immoral purposes, and attempted second-degree sexual
assault, but the latter two counts were dropped in the plea
bargain. The attempted sex assault charge was for an incident
involving a teen-age neighbor of the Maciulis family, authorities
said.
   According to authorities, at the time of Tammy's disappearance
she and her mother and sister were living at the same apartment
complex where Blassingame was living with a woman.
   Blassingame said he was driving out of town when he discovered
Tammy in the back seat of his car.
   He said Tammy asked him to drive her to her father's home near
Chicago. Blassingame said that because he had a criminal record, he
became scared and told her to return home.
   He said that when he turned his car around, she was standing in
the way and was struck, and stopped breathing.
   Blassingame said he dumped clothing out of a duffel bag, put her
body in it and headed south.
   Finne, the defense attorney, said Blassingame's plea was
appropriate.
   ``The defendant faces strong evidence of conviction and he
legally acknowledges the strength of the state's case, but not
necessarily beyond a reasonable doubt,'' he said.
   Duket said the agreement was also in the best interest of the
state because the case was based mostly on circumstantial evidence.
   ``I am happy with the agreement. I am happy the defendant will
do a significant amount of prison time, but I am disappointed out
case wasn't strong enough to proceed to trial without any
reservations.''

<TEXT>
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa will visit
the United States, Canada and Venezuela next month and will address
a joint session of Congress on Nov. 15.
   The trip, from Nov. 12 to 20, will be his first to North America
and the longest foreign journey of his life.
   Sen. Andrzej Celinski, a Solidarity activist who returned from
the United States on Sunday after fixing Walesa's schedule, said on
Monday the 1983 Nobel laureate will meet trade union and political
leaders in all three countries.
   Walesa's visit will include a big outdoor rally at City Hall in
Chicago, a city with an ethnic Polish population second only to
Warsaw.
   Walesa, 46, leaves Poland on Nov. 11 for Toronto, where he will
meet with Polish-Canadians and trade union officials.
   He travels to Ottawa on Nov. 13 to meet with Canadian government
leaders, and arrives in Washington that evening to meet with Lane
Kirkland, president of the AFL-CIO.
   On Nov. 14, he will attend the annual AFL-CIO convention and
dine at the Capitol that evening as guest of Senate Republican
leader Robert Dole.
   Walesa addresses Congress on Nov. 15. He has said he will remind
Congress of Poland's contributions to American independence since
the Revolutionary War, and plead for U.S. support for Poland now in
its hour of need.
   Also that day, he is scheduled to receive the Robert F. Kennedy
human rights award.
   On Nov. 16, Walesa begins two days in New York. He will attend a
dinner there of the International Rescue Committee, meet with Labor
Secretary Elizabeth Dole, have talks with Jewish leaders and visit
the offices of the U.S. Polish-language daily Nowy Dziennik. On the
night of Nov. 17, he is to have dinner with one of the best-known
U.S. capitalists, publisher Malcolm Forbes.
   Walesa goes to Chicago on Nov. 18. Besides the City Hall rally,
he is to meet there with members of Congress and business leaders.
   Walesa closes out his U.S. visit on Nov. 19 with a stop in
Philadelphia, where his wife Danuta visited in July and accepted a
Freedom Prize in Walesa's name.
   Walesa travels to Caracas, Venezuela, for a meeting on Nov. 20
with the World Labor Confederation and returns to Poland the next
day.
   Walesa's stepfather lived and worked in Jersey City, N.J., until
his death, but Walesa himself has never visited the United States.
The Solidarity leader was not allowed to travel abroad for seven
years following imposition of martial law in Poland in December
1981.
   He made his first foreign trip after the martial law episode in
December 1988, when he went to France, meeting with President
Francois Mitterrand and fellow Nobel Peace laureate Andrei
Sakharov. He since has visited several European countries.
   Walesa also visited Japan in 1981.

<HEAD>Nyers, Named Head of New Hungarian Party, is Veteran Politician</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Hungary, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Reszoe Nyers, who was elected Monday as
president of the new Hungarian Socialist Party, was also chairman
of the now-dissolved Communist Party and is one of the most
experienced politicians and economists in Hungary.
   ``We are breaking ... with the exercise of power along the lines
of the dictatorship of the proletariat,'' Nyers, 66, told delegates
to the congress on Sunday, a day after the new party was
established.
   A printer by trade, Nyers joined the Hungarian Social Democratic
Party early on. After the party merged with the communists in 1948,
he was a party secretary, then studied economics.
   A champion of political reform and an experienced economist who
believes in a ``socialist'' market economy, Nyers was voted into
the Politburo in May 1988.
   It was a stunning political comeback after many years in
political limbo and came as the result of a major reshuffle that
saw longtime party chief Janos Kadar ousted and replaced by Karoly
Grosz.
   ``Whoever is a reform communist or a Euro-communist and accepts
the fact that the party has to be of a socialist (nature) ... can
be a member of a new kind of Socialist Party,'' Nyers was quoted as
saying Sunday, making it clear most communists can join it.
   Nyers' history of managing economic and financial affairs dates
to 1960 when he became finance minister, a job he held until 1962.
   As a member of the party's ruling Politburo, Nyers became known
as the father of the pioneering economic reforms that gave
Hungarians the highest living standards in Eastern Europe in the
late 1960s and early 1970s.
   But in 1974, Nyers was dropped from the Politburo and stripped
of his economics post as Kadar put a brake on reforms that
apparently alarmed Leonid I. Brezhnev, who then was in power in
Moscow.
   Nyers' vast experience was the reason for his appointment last
November as special economics minister to steer Hungary through a
period of austerity.
   Now, he will have to steer the new party through a period of
political transition and help it compete in the first multiparty
elections next year.

   A teen-ager was in custody Monday for allegedly
shooting his father to death during a dispute over mowing the lawn.
   The 17-year-old boy's name was not released because of his age,
and investigators were considering charges, said Sgt. Mike Diaz of
the Metro-Dade police homicide squad.
   James Hines, 47, died within minutes of the shooting Sunday.
   Police said Hines had told his son to mow the lawn about noon,
then took a nap.
   When the father awoke just before 4 p.m., he found the lawn
uncut and confronted his son with a stick, Diaz said.
   The father hit the son with the stick, and the boy allegedly
produced a handgun and fired, killing Hines with one shot to the
torso, Diaz said.
   It was not known where the boy got the gun, the officer said.

<HEAD>Queen's 21st Cousin Says She's Pregnant and Parents Cut Her Off</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 23-year-old cousin of Queen Elizabeth II says
she is pregnant and her parents cut off her funds, instructing her
to have an abortion or marry her boyfriend immediately, the
newspaper Today said Monday.
   It quoted Marina Ogilvy as saying she had written a letter to
the queen asking her to intervene with the young woman's parents,
Princess Alexandra and Sir Angus Ogilvy.
   Alexandra, sister of the Duke of Kent, is the queen's first
cousin. Marina Ogilvy is 24th in line to the throne.
   The Ogilvys issued a brief statement saying they loved their
daughter, they had not cut her off and she always was welcome at
home. A spokesman for Buckingham Palace, when asked if the royal
family would have a statement, replied: ``None whatsoever.''
   Marina Ogilvy is a pianist who won a place at London's respected
Guildhall School of Music, but recently turned it down. She worked
as a survival course instructor in 1987, once worked in the
complaints department of a London store and has a diploma in
cooking.
   She generally has avoided the public eye and made clear her
desire to live a more independent life than many royal family
members do.
   Today quoted Miss Ogilvy as saying she and her boyfriend, Paul
Mowatt, 26, want to marry after the baby is born. The newspaper did
not say when the baby was due.
   She and Mowatt live with his parents in Kingston, on the
outskirts of London.
   David Montgomery, editor of Today, said the newspaper was
contributing to the couple's daily expenses.
   He said he had ``absolutely no doubts'' about the report, which
was a rare public airing of a private royal dispute. ``I can say
100 percent that her story is true and we reported it 100 percent
accurately,'' Montgomery said.
   As quoted in Today, Miss Ogilvie said her parents stopped her
monthly allowance of $450 and denied her access to trust funds.
   She was quoted as saying that, when she asked her father, ``
`What comes first, queen and country, or your own daughter?' he
responded: `Queen and country.'''
   Today quoted her as saying she thought her parents tried to
trick her into an abortion when she went to her doctor.
   ``We are sure now that the surgery (doctor's office) tried to
fix an abortion and pretend it was a routine examination,'' Miss
Ogilvy was quoted as saying.
   According to the report, she does not dare go home because ``I
am frightened they will try and keep me there against my will.''
   About the letter to the queen, Today quoted Miss Ogilvy as
saying: ``I know she is a wise and caring woman. I just hope she
can help my parents see sense.''
   A statement issued on behalf of Princess Alexandra and her
husband said they ``are concerned at the number of inaccuracies. In
particular, they have not `cut off' their daughter. Marina is
always welcome at her home. They love her very much and feel deeply
for her at this difficult time.''

<HEAD>President Pledges to End Mexican Newsprint Monopoly</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAM ROSSIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MONTERREY, Mexico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Carlos Salinas de Gortari
said Monday he will end a government-controlled monopoly on the
importation and sale of inexpensive newsprint in Mexico.
   The monopoly has been used in past years to retaliate against
newspapers that failed to toe the government or ruling
Institutional Revolutionary Party's line by making it difficult or
expensive for dissidents to buy newsprint elsewhere.
   ``Allow me to announce that, once we sell PIPSA, we will allow
free and total importation of newsprint, and thus avoid a monopoly
by certain groups that could affect freedom of press expression,''
Salinas told 450 members of the Inter-American Press Association
meeting in this northern Mexico city.
   Salinas was greeted with a standing ovation and shouts of
``bravo, bravo!'' when he announced the sale of Productora e
Importadora de Papel, S.A. de C.V., popularly known by its Spanish
initials of PIPSA, which is jointly owned by the government and
long-established newspapers.
   Salinas did not give any deadline for the sale in his speech at
the opening session of IAPA's 45th annual general assembly in this
Nuevo Leon state capital, about 150 miles south of Laredo, Texas.
   IAPA has about 1,300 members in the United States, Canada, Latin
America and the Caribbean.
   PIPSA was founded by President Lazaro Cardenas in 1935 when
world prices of newsprint skyrocketed and Mexican publishers were
hard pressed for money.
   It imported newsprint duty-free and distributed it among
affiliated newspapers, virtually all of which were sympathetic to
the Institutional Revolutionary Party.
   When PIPSA's charter expired in 1965, the members voted to renew
it for another 30 years.
   But Salinas has been pressing for the monopoly's dissolution
since he took office Dec. 1, as part of a campaign to cut
government subsidies and encourage competition in the free market
and greater press freedom in Mexico.
   Many established publishers said they favored continuing PIPSA
when Salinas first announced publicly that his administration was
in favor of reopening the newsprint market.
   But many more _ especially provincial newspapers _ said they
were all for it.
   ``It's a magnificent measure,'' Jose Healy, executive editor of
El Imparcial of northwestern Sonora state, said in an interview. He
said PIPSA ``has been a weapon that the government can use at any
moment.''
   Without subsidized newsprint some papers can find it difficult
to survive, especially in the saturated Mexico City market.
   In his speech, Salinas said his administration will follow a
policy of ``strict respect for freedom of expression'' and
``provide maximum security'' for Mexican journalists.
   ``A modern government accepts criticism,'' Salinas said, adding
that such criticism spurs administrations to correct or improve
their policies.
   A total of 29 Mexican journalists were slain during President
Miguel de la Madrid's six-year administration that preceded Salinas.
   Government spokesmen said most of the killings were common
crimes, involving disputes or hold-ups, but journalists have
insisted they had political motives.
   The only case brought to trial so far is that of Manuel Buendia,
a front-page columnist for the newspaper Excelsior. He was shot on
a Mexico City street in May 1984 and his assassination remained a
mystery until a federal security chief and an agent were arrested
last June.
   Prosecutors say Buendia was shot because he had uncovered a
federal security official's role in drug trafficking.
   Several others were also arrested and are on trial as
conspirators in the case, but there is continued speculation that a
coverup has concealed the roles of high-ranking de la Madrid
administration officials.
   Advances and setbacks in press freedom in Latin America were
among the major topics for discussion by the association on Monday.
   Eduardo Ulibarri, vice president of the association's Press
Freedom and Information Committee singled out Colombia and Panama
as ``the two most critical cases this year.''

   What was on Christopher Columbus' mind when
he made his momentous discovery of America in 1492?
   Food, television and rock 'n' roll, according to youngsters
asked to write essays for Columbus Day.
   ``The first thing Columbus did was to build a house to live in
and he went to get food,'' wrote Chris Kubiak, one of the
fourth-graders assigned the task at Buffalo Lincoln Academy.
   ``He fixed his boat because he hit it on the way over to land.

   The students were asked to describe what Columbus might have
said when he spotted the new world.
   Nichelle Hodge offered these hasty remarks: ``I'm in such a
hurry to find some food. It's quiet when the ladies aren't around,
because they yell too much. But I like the ladies very much!''
   Bruce Schwertfeger thought Columbus might have suggested: ``If
this is America, let's listen to rock 'n' roll and watch People's
Court!''

   Dogs, gerbils _ and even a ferret _ got
special prayers and their owners sang ``Bless the Beasts and the
Children'' during a special service organized by animal welfare
groups.
   ``I've done a lot of unusual things. This is one of them,'' Rev.
Tom Young said of the service Sunday for about 30 animals at a city
park.
   Two other ministers also participated in the service, organized
in celebration of the Oct. 4 feast day of St. Francis, the patron
saint of nature and animals.
   ``They were mostly dogs and some gerbils,'' said Young, a
Presbyterian minister. ``There also was one ferret.''
   Young said the service was a ``recognition of the fact that the
animals are a part of God's creation ...''
   Kathy Boland of Charleston brought Ragamuffin, her toy fox
terrier.
   ``He's getting old,'' she said. ``I feel this blessing will
help.''

   The city transit system has found a way to
get car-crazed commuters out of their automobiles _ offer free bus
rides.
   Ridership on city buses has risen about 44 percent since Oct. 1,
when the three-month, ride-for-free program began. The bus fare is
usually 50 cents.
   ``We're very pleased. We've had so many extra riders that we've
put extra buses on the road just to handle the overcapacity,'' said
Liz Cohen, a transit spokeswoman.
   Usually, about 50,000 people a day ride city buses. The number
rose as high as 76,000 daily in the program's first week.

<HEAD>Dogs Quarantined After Fatal Attack on Elderly Woman</HEAD>

   Authorities on Monday quarantined
three mixed-breed dogs that attacked and killed a 73-year-old woman
as she picked up a newspaper in her front yard.
   A neighbor used a baseball bat to run off the dogs, but Frances
Fletcher died shortly after the attack Sunday.
   The state attorney's office Monday was considering criminal
charges against Sidney Bodie and Scherrie Laramore, neighbors who
owned the dogs, Jacksonville sheriff's spokesman Asa Higgs said.
   The three dogs _ one of them pregnant _ were held in the county
pound.
   ``We're holding them until we get word from the state,'' said
John Hartley, animal control supervisor. ``Under normal
circumstances, they would be held in quarantine for 10 days to
determine if they had rabies, then released to their owners.''
   The county would hold on to the dogs if charges were filed
against their owners, Hartley said.
   County officials initially identified the animals as English
bulldogs _ a small, pug-nosed breed _ arousing the ire of owners
and breeders of the dogs, who contend they are not as aggressive as
pit bulls.
   Hartley said Monday that animal control officials were not sure
of the breed.
   ``We're saying they're mixed bulldogs,'' Hartley said. ``It
could be English and pit. They've got a little bit of everything.''
   Other experts disputed the identification.
   ``It was told to me that they were English bulldogs, but they
were definitely not,'' said Phil Snyder, executive director of the
Jacksonville Humane Society. ``They look like pit bull terriers, or
mixed-breed pit bulls.''

<HEAD>Trinity Theater Tells Patrons: Pay What You Can Afford</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At a time when the price of theater
tickets is soaring beyond the reach of many, Trinity Repertory
Theater will try a one-night experiment Tuesday of letting patrons
pay what they will.
   ``The objective is is to give everyone an opportunity to come to
the theater,'' said E. Timothy Langan, managing director of the
theater company.
   The normal ticket price for the preview performance of Maxim
Gorky's ``Summerfolk'' _ a story Langan described as one about the
Russian Empire's version of yuppies before the 1917 revolution _ is
$24. Based on similar experiments in Baltimore and San Diego,
Langan said he expected people would be willing to pay $3 to $4.
   ``But that's OK,'' he said. ``The whole purpose of this is for
someone to be comfortable in coming to the theater.''
   Patrons can pay as little as they want _ the only rule is no
freebies, he said. But Langan wouldn't mind if someone decided the
theater really was worth more than $24 a ticket.
   Award-winning theaters like Trinity, which started in a church
25 years ago, face pressures to mount increasingly expensive
productions.
   ``I think that some people have perceived that we've become less
affordable,'' Langan said. ``But there is a great pressure to
produce quality shows, and then the discussion gets into money and
then there's pressure on ticket prices.''
   With a large artistic community centered at the Rhode Island
School of Design and Brown University, Langan said he expected many
of those taking advantage of the name-your-own-price offer would be
close to the starving artist stereotype.
   Trinity has set aside $5,000 from a grant to cover projected
losses. The theater and its new artistic director, Anne Bogart,
hope to find sponsors for similar nights, but already it must seek
outside helpto meet regular expenses because even the $24 regular
price for weekday performances doesn't make ends meet, Langan said.
   Only weekend theatergoers, who pay $30, actually cover the costs
of the 550-seat theater, he said. Trinity, with student and other
discounts, averages about $20 a ticket.

<HEAD>Soldiers Dispatched to Help Clear Hurricane Debris</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRUCE SMITH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Army arrived Monday to help clear
away mountains of tinder-dry debris, damaged furniture and
destroyed appliances that litter lawns and homes devastated by
Hurricane Hugo.
   In central South Carolina, landfills are overflowing with trash
from hurricane cleanup efforts, and officials searched for
temporary dumps.
   Charleston Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr. said he hoped much of the
debris in his city could be cleared in two weeks, but Army officers
were not as optimistic.
   ``We could have people cleaning up for the next six months,''
said Lt. Col. Jim Scott, district engineer for the Army Corps of
Engineers, which is coordinating the effort.
   No one knows how much debris may be strewn along streets and
highways, but Riley said 1,000 truck loads a day are moved out of
Charleston alone.
   About 250 engineers and soldiers from Fort Stewart, Ga., arrived
Monday equipped with 13 front-end loaders and 40 dump trucks for a
weeklong assignment. They were scheduled to hit the streets of
Charleston, Berkeley and Dorchester counties Tuesday to begin work.
   The Corps of Engineers will arrange with private contractors to
complete the cleanup.
   Last week, the same troops cleared roads in rural areas and
helped build sand dunes to protect erosion-scarred beaches along a
60-mile stretch of the coast known as the Grand Strand.
   ``These kids have been on a tour of the state nonstop,'' said
Army spokesman Capt. Mike Wilbur.
   Across South Carolina, 24 counties and 1.8 million people were
affected when Hugo rolled through the state Sept. 21, killing 18
and causing an estimated $4 billion to $5 billion in damage. In
North Carolina, Hugo killed seven people and caused an estimated
$725 million in damage.
   Brown leaves, broken limbs and logs from felled trees still line
streets and boulevards throughout the region known as the
Lowcountry. In places, branches are piled so high they block the
view of houses from the street.
   In low-lying areas and on the coastal barrier islands flooded by
the storm, damaged refrigerators, washing machines and clothes
dryers litter the landscape. In Charleston, lumber and sections of
metal roofing clutter sidewalks.
   The federal government agreed last week to pay for removing the
debris, saving state and local governments as much as $50 million.
   ``Our goal is that we would want to have and expect everything
to be picked up within two weeks,'' before cooler, dry weather
turns the debris into a fire hazard, the mayor said.
   In the inland counties of Sumter, Lee and Clarendon, landfills
near capacity before the storm are overflowing with garbage and
debris, fallen trees and food that spoiled during widespread power
outages.
   ``The county landfill ... had a thimbleful of space to begin
with,'' Lee County Administrator Barry Hickman said. ``We're in big
trouble now.''
   Tons of debris also caused problems in North Carolina. ``It's
just everywhere,'' said Al Sharp, county manager of Lincoln County,
N.C., northwest of Charlotte.
   Meanwhile, 6,048 federally supported storm cleanup jobs are
still available, said Paul Hall, the disaster coordinating officer
for the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
   Some 270,000 people lost jobs because of the storm, ``but very
few people have shown an interest in accepting those jobs,'' Hall
said. He said the positions pay more than the minimum wage, but he
did not know how much.
   Sam Pike, director of the state Employment and Security
Commission's Charleston office, said he believed hurricane victims
are still more concerned with securing electricity, food and
housing than with temporary jobs.
   The American Red Cross announced that only two emergency
shelters housing 199 people remained in operation in South
Carolina. At one point, 453 shelters housed 87,230 people in North
Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia and Tennessee.
   The number of meals the agency is serving has also dropped. On
Sunday, 9,216 meals were served, down from 13,909 meals served
Saturday, spokeswoman Georgeanne McDaniel said.

   Penny Lernoux, a prize-winning journalist
and author noted for books on the role of the Catholic Church in
Latin America, has died. She was 49.
   Ms. Lernoux died of cancer Sunday at Northern Westchester
Hospital Center in Mount Kisco, according to Sister Elizabeth Roach
of the Maryknoll Sisters.
   Ms. Lernoux had lived in South America since 1962, the past 20
years in Bogota, Colombia. Recently, she had been staying at the
convent, working on a book about the Maryknoll Sisters.
   Her 1980 book, ``Cry of the People,'' received acclaim for its
depiction of the struggle for human rights in Latin America and the
church's involvement.
   Ms. Lernoux, a graduate of the University of Southern
California, worked for the Copley News Service from 1964 through
1976 in Caracas, Venezuela, Buenos Aires and Bogota.
   Since 1976, she worked as a free-lance writer. ``Cry of the
People'' received Columbia University's Maria Moors Cabot award and
the Sidney Hillman Foundation Book Award.
   This year, she published ``People of God: The Struggle for World
Catholicism,'' which criticized the Vatican and praised the
emergence of a ``new kind of church'' that is sensitive to the
millions of poor Catholics in Latin America.
   ``As a Catholic observer who has lived in the Third World for
nearly 30 years,'' she wrote, ``I have followed developments in the
church, at times in despair but mostly with optimism.
   ``The hope that a new church of the poor has given to the
impoverished masses of Latin America is, in my opinion, the most
significant political development in the region in recent decades.
That church has also given me new faith.''
   Among the awards she received were two citations from the
Overseas Press Club of America, in 1969 and 1970, and the Tom
Wallace Inter-American Press Association award in 1973. She also
wrote for Harper's, The Nation and the National Catholic Reporter.
   She is survived by her husband, Denis Nahum, and their daughter,
Angela, both of Bogota; her parents, Beatrice Campeau Lernoux and
Maurice Lernoux of Hemet, Calif.; and a sister, Lisa Lernoux of San
Diego.
   A funeral Mass was scheduled Wednesday, at the Maryknoll Sisters
Center in Ossining.

<HEAD>Antarctica Meeting Opens With Calls for Nature Reserve</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SYDNEY RUBIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Premier Michel Rocard opened an international
conference about Antarctica on Monday by urging that the continent
be preserved as a wilderness and site of scientific research.
   The proposal joined France with many environmental groups
opposed to the view of the United States, which seeks controlled
use of the remote continent's vast mineral resources.
   ``The Antarctic is at the heart of the debate on the
environment,'' Rocard told delegates from 39 nations which signed
the 1959 Antarctic Treaty.
   Delegates to the 10-day Paris meeting will review the treaty,
which preserved the vast, icy continent as a place for peaceful
scientific cooperation.
   Representatives of the World Wide Fund for Nature and the
Antarctic and Southern Oceans Coalition, an umbrella group of 200
environmental groups, said Monday negotiations should be held on
establishing the first World Park, or international wilderness
reserve, on the continent's 5.5 million square miles.
   Rocard and Bob Hawke, prime minister of Australia, announced in
August they would sponsor a proposal to designate Antarctica a
protected, international wilderness park. Such a reserve would
permanently ban mineral exploitation and control all forms of human
activity on the continent, which is twice the size of Australia and
almost entirely encased in ice.
   The French premier said the proposal is rooted in a fundamental
belief in the ``right of future generations to inherit from us a
planet that is still fit to live in.'' It has gained support from
Belgium, Italy, India and other countries.
   Leading the other side are the United States, New Zealand, Japan
and Chile, which back the Wellington Convention, a 1988 accord that
is six nations short of the required unanimous approval of the 39
Antarctic Treaty members. It seeks to protect the environment by
allowing mineral exploitation under strict controls.
   Its supporters argue that a legal framework regulating mining is
better than the voluntary moratorium that has existed until now.
The minerals accord also ``establishes environmental principles
which are very important,'' said Tucker Scully, head of the U.S.
delegation, in an interview before the conference.
   However, Rocard told delegates that Antarctica's ``purity is
such that it is an irreplaceable site for observing the ozone layer
and the changes taking place in the atmosphere.''
   In August, a New Zealand team reported the ozone hole over
Antarctica was much larger than previously believed. Their work
raised questions about whether the world's protective ozone layer
was disintegrating more rapidly than believed earlier, exposing
human beings to dangerous radiation.
   Rocard called on delegates to hold a special meeting next year
to ``work on a comprehensive program for protecting Antarctica
which, in my view, should take the form of a nature reserve.''
   At a news conference after Rocard's speech, Jacques Cousteau,
the French underwater explorer, said President Francois Mitterrand
had asked him to help develop the French position on Antarctica.
   Cousteau, who has collected more than 1 million signatures on a
petition to declare Antarctica a world park, said the United States
was ``wasting its time defending a lost cause'' in arguing for
mineral exploitation.
   Earlier in the day, at Paris studios of the American network
NBC, Cousteau refused to yield his seat to Scully, preventing the
U.S. delegate from presenting the American view on the ``Today''
show.
   During their meetings, the delegates will discuss controlling
hazardous waste, extending areas designated for special protection,
and developing a plan for dealing with oil spills.

   Following is the English-language text of the account on Monday
by the official Soviet news agency Tass, distributed in New York,
of what Tass reported was an alien landing in the Soviet Union. It
bore the following headline:
   `Confirmed UFO Landing in Voronezh, Witnesses Frightened.
   VORONEZH _ Scientists have confirmed that an unidentified flying
object recently landed in a park in the Russian city of Voronezh.
   They have also identified the landing site and found traces of
aliens who made a short promenade about the park.
   Aliens visited the place after dark, at least three times,
locals report.
   A large shining ball or disk was seen hovering above the park,
it then landed, a hatch opened and one, two or three creatures
similar to humans and a small robot came out.
   The aliens were three or even four meters tall (just under 10
feet to slightly more than 13 feet high), but with very small
heads, witnesses say.
   They walked near the ball or disc and then disappeared inside.
Onlookers were overwhelmed with a fear which lasted for several
days.
   ``We identified the landing site by means of biolocation,''
Genrikh Silanov, head of the Voronezh Geophysical Laboratory said
in an interview.
   ``We detected a circle 20 meters in diameter. Four
4-to-5-centimeter deep dents, each with a diameter of 14 to 16
centimeters were clearly visible. They are situated in the four
points of a rhomb. We found two mysterious pieces of rock.''
   (A centimeter is 0.4 inches and one meter equals 3.3 feet).
   ``At first glance they looked like sandstone of a deep-red
color. However, mineralogical analysis has shown that the substance
cannot be found on Earth. However, additional tests are needed to
reach a more definite conclusion.''
   Silanov used biolocation to trace the earthly trails of the
aliens.
   Witnesses were not informed about the experiment, but the route
along which the aliens walked as described by the onlookers and the
one established scientifically coincided.
   Many also claim to have seen a banana-shaped object in the sky
and a characteristic illuminated sign, as described in the U.S.
Saga magazine.
   It is unlikely that residents of Voronezh could have read the
magazine.'

<HEAD>UN Says Namibian Police Not Cooperating Fully with Monitors</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Namibian police withhold information and
deny U.N. officials the right to visit people in detention,
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar said Monday in a report
to the Security Council.
   He also said the South-West African police force, known as
SWAPOL, was delaying investigations.
   ``In many cases they have proceeded very slowly and there is a
risk that some of them, including some serious cases of homicide,
will not be completed within the transition period, with the result
that important and crucial evidence may thus be lost,'' he said.
   About 1,000 U.N. police monitors are in Namibia and 500 more are
being sent to supervise SWAPOL, trained by South Africa, during a
one-year period in which the territory is to gain independence.
   The foreign ministers of Burundi, Uganda and Mali spoke out
against South Africa on Monday, the beginning of the third week of
General Assembly debate.
   Foreign Minister Cyprien Mbonimpa of Burundi said free elections
scheduled for November in Namibia give hope the General Assembly
can welcome it as an independent nation next year. Namibians are to
choose an assembly to write a constitution and organize the first
independent government in the territory of 1.3 million people.
   Paul Kawanga Ssemogerere of Uganda said elements of the Namibian
police ``and other South African agents'' threaten the South-West
Africa People's Organization, the Namibian nationalist party known
as SWAPO.
   Anton Lubowski, SWAPO's legal advisor, was assassinated outside
his Windhoek residence in September and an Irishman who entered the
territory from South Africa has been detained.
   N'golo Traore, foreign minister of Mali, said Lubowski's death
was the result of ``sordid plots'' by South African racists.
   Perez de Cuellar's report said there was no arrangement for U.N.
monitors to visit detainees at police stations and monitors were
not allowed to attend interrogations of SWAPOL members accused of
offenses.
   ``On occasion,'' SWAPOL has failed to inform U.N. monitors of
its schedule of patrols, making it difficult for supervisors from
the U.N. Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG) to accompany them, the
report said.
   The secretary-general added: ``Nor has SWAPOL always shared with
UNTAG information relevant to the security situation in Namibia,
though it has often made unsubstantiated allegations of imminent
infiltration by SWAPO combatants from southern Angola.''
   SWAPO, a guerrilla group as well as a political party, has
fought South African occupation of Namibia since 1966.
   More than 1,000 SWAPO fighters crossed into northern Namibia
from Angola on April 1, prompting days of skirmishes with Namibian
police and South African troops. Hundreds of guerrillas and dozens
of soldiers and police were reported killed.
   On two occasions since, South Africa has raised false alarms of
impending SWAPO invasions.
   ``It is clearly important that security information should be
shared with UNTAG, in order to prevent any recurrence of disturbing
terrorist incidents which have taken place in recent weeks,
including a murderous attack on UNTAG locations at Outjo on Aug. 10
and the assassination of a leading official of SWAPO in Windhoek
(Lubowski) on Sept. 12,'' Perez de Cuellar reported.
   He said he had increased the number of police monitors from 500
to 1,500 since April ``in order to deal with complaints received
from Namibians who do not wish to address themselves directly'' to
the police.

   An attacker pulled up in a car
and fatally shot a 28-year-old man in another vehicle Monday,
police reported. The outlawed IRA claimed responsibility.
   Police said Thomas Gibson was shot several times as he sat in
his car in the village of Kilrea. They said the gunman opened fire
at point-blank range from a car that pulled up alongside Gibson's.
   The Irish Republican Army claimed responsibility in a statement
delivered to news organizations. It said Gibson worked for the
Ulster Volunteer Force, an outlawed Protestant paramilitary group
that frequently is an IRA target.
   Downtown Radio, a Belfast station, said the Protestant group
denied Gibson was a member. Police said he was not connected with
security forces.
   The IRA is waging a guerrilla campaign to drive the British from
Protestant-dominated Northern Ireland and unite it with the Irish
Republic, which is overwhelmingly Roman Catholic.

   An electrician repairing a sign on the roof
of a medical office building fell 12 stories Monday, crashing
through a skylight and hitting a person before landing on a table
in a coffee shop.
   ``There were some ladies screaming downstairs pretty bad,'' said
Oscar Gallegos, who works in the building and saw the fall. ``It
was chaotic. There were people all over. There were doctors and
nurses all over.''
   Electrician Troy Livingston was in critical condition at St.
Luke's Lutheran Hospital and the person he struck, who was not
identified, was in guarded condition, hospital spokesman Walter
Baker said.
   Livingston and another electrician had just finished fixing an
electric sign on the building's roof when he fell, tumbling eight
stories outside before crashing through an atrium skylight on the
fourth floor, police Sgt. Pat Kilough said.
   The skylight was above an enclosed courtyard area of the
building that extended from the fourth floor to the first floor.
   The person Livingston struck was sitting on a bench on the
second floor, waiting for X-rays. After Livingston struck the
person, Livingston landed on a table in the first-floor coffee shop.
   There were people in the coffee shop, but no one was injured,
police said.
   Livingston, employed by Outdoor Lighting Services, is in his
20s, but company spokesman Rick Garcia said he did not know his
exact age.

<HEAD>Pinochet Retires Deputy Army Commander, 11 Other Generals</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Augusto Pinochet reduced the
number of army generals by five Monday, two months before elections
for a civilian government to replace his military regime.
   He retired 12 generals, including deputy army commander Jorge
Zincke, and promoted seven officers to general rank. Chosen to
replace Zincke was Gen. Jorge Lucar Figueroa, now barracks
commander for Santiago, the capital.
   Gen. Pinochet's changes were part of an annual restructuring of
the army leadership.
   Since losing a referendum Oct. 5, 1988, on extending his rule to
1997, Pinochet has reduced the number of generals from 56 to 43.
Pinochet has been army commander since shortly before the uprising
in September 1973 that ousted President Salvador Allende, an avowed
Marxist who died in the coup.
   The referendum defeat obliged Pinochet to schedule the December
elections for a civilian government to be inaugurated March 11.
   Reduction in the number of top officers appears designed to help
ease the military's departure from major government posts and its
return to the barracks.
   Pinochet, 73, has said he will remain as army commander under
the new government. The 1980 constitution, written by his
administration, allows him and the navy, air force and national
police commanders to keep their jobs until 1998.

of Fame star dedicated to actress Bette Davis, who died last week
in France.
   Ana Martinez-Holler of the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce placed
the floral tribute and sign ``In memory of Bette Davis'' on the
sidewalk.
   On Sunday, a lawyer for Miss Davis said a funeral will be held
some time this month on the West Coast. The screen legend died of
breast cancer at the American Hospital in Paris. She was 81.
   Her body will be flown to Los Angeles this week, lawyer Harold
Schiff said.
   He said he and her son, Michael Merrill, planned to arrange a
``very private funeral and a memorial service in a week or two.''

<HEAD>Boy Killed in Accidental Shooting; May Involve New Law</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PALATKA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 9-year-old accidentally shot and fatally
wounded a playmate in what could be the first case involving a new
law making adults responsible for letting loaded guns fall into the
hands of children.
   Scott Carlton, 12, of nearby San Mateo, was shot in the abdomen
Sunday, police said.
   The boys had been playing in the 9-year-old's bedroom when the
younger boy took a .22-caliber rifle down from a gun rack to show
it to Scott, said Putnam County sheriff's Capt. Dick Schauland.
   Schauland said the 9-year-old was holding the gun when it fired.
   Scott was rushed to the emergency room at Putnam Community
Hospital, and then flown to University Hospital in Jacksonville,
where he died.
   Schauland said the detective investigating the incident, Al
Bryant, conferred with the State Attorney's office Monday to decide
whether to file charges against the 9-year-old's parents. No
decision was expected before Tuesday.
   The new gun-safety law, which took effect Oct. 1, was passed
during a special legislative session last summer after a series of
shootings, several of them fatal, by children playing with guns.
   The law requires gun owners to take reasonable precautions to
keep loaded weapons in their homes and businesses out of the hands
of children 15 and younger, such as using a trigger lock or keeping
the weapon in a locked box.
   If a child shoots someone as a result of a careless gun owner,
the adult could be charged with a felony, punishable by up to five
years in prison and a $5,000 fine. A gun owner faces a misdemeanor
and up to 60 days in jail and a $500 fine if a minor threatens
someone with a gun or displays it in public.
   There are exceptions for hunting and target-shooting accidents
and for incidents involving guns taken illegally.

   Unseasonably low temperatures chilled the upper Great Lakes
states and much of the lower Ohio Valley on Monday, breaking 13
low-temperature records for the date and tying one.
   The low of 28 at Detroit erased a record on the books since 1876
and the low of 30 at Dayton, Ohio, toppled a mark that had stood
since 1889. Indianapolis' low of 30 tied the record set 1876.
   Other records were 25 at Flint, Mich.; 26 at Fort Wayne, Ind.;
23 at Grand Rapids, Mich.; 35 at Greer, S.C.; 23 at Jackson, Mich.;
23 at Lansing, Mich.; 29 at Mansfield, Ohio; 20 at Marquette,
Mich.; 27 at South Bend, Ind.; 25 at Toledo, Ohio, and 25 at
Traverse City, Mich.
   Monday's lowest reading for the Lower 48 states was 15 at
Gunnison, Colo.
   Warnings for frost or freezing temperatures were posted
overnight into Tuesday morning over sections of inland southeastern
New York state, the mountains of western Pennsylvania, southern
Maryland, much of inland Virginia, the District of Columbia area,
southeastern West Virginia, much of western and northern North
Carolina, and the mountains of South Carolina.
   Tuesday morning in the mountains of northern Georgia was
expected to be the coldest so far this season.
   Showers were scattered over the southern half of the Florida
Peninsula, light rain was scattered over central New York state,
and showers reached from central Minnesota into northwestern
Wisconsin.
   However, no significant rainfall was reported during the six
hours up to 2 p.m. EDT.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 34 at
Hibbing, Minn., to 102 at Palm Springs, Calif.

   The flight engineer on Delta Flight 1141, which
crashed on takeoff and killed 14 people in 1988, says he did his
job right, and the National Transportation Safety Board agrees. But
he can't find work.
   Delta fired Steven Judd and the former Navy pilot says he hasn't
been able to get a job with another airline since the crash at
Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport.
   ``I feel that I do need to say something, that I did my job that
day,'' Judd, 32, said in interviews published Monday.
   Judd was the only member of the plane's three-man flight crew
found blameless by the NTSB when it ruled on the accident's cause
last month.
   The board found that ``inadequate cockpit discipline'' by Capt.
Larry Davis and first officer C. Wilson Kirkland resulted in them
failing to properly set the wing flaps before takeoff.
   The board also blamed a faulty takeoff-warning system that would
have alerted the crew to the misaligned flaps, which produce added
lift during takeoff and landing.
   A cockpit recording showed the crew and a flight attendant had
talked about non-business matters during the 30 minutes before
takeoff, but Judd played a small role in the chatter, mainly
sticking to his duties.
   ``The way the media basically said: The crew did this. The crew
said that. The crew joked about this. The crew forgot this. It
hurt,'' Judd said. ``When I felt all along that I had done my job.''
   In July, Delta fired all three members of the flight crew and
stands by the decision despite the NTSB finding. The crew intends
to appeal, a process that could take several years.
   Judd has applied for jobs at other major airlines, but none
called him back, he said.
   ``I'm pretty confident that if I'm not reinstated (by Delta), my
airline career is ruined,'' Judd said.
   Shortly after the accident, Judd's commander at the Dallas Naval
Air Station in Grand Prairie said he could come back any time, Judd
said. Three months later, he accepted. He flies on a reserve status
about 40 hours per week, shuttling cargo or passengers.

   Four East German refugees were sent home
after they entered Poland, a pro-Solidarity newspaper said Monday.
An Interior Ministry spokesman said he could not confirm the report.
   The number of refugees registered with the West German Embassy
in Warsaw reached about 500 on Monday, the official news agency PAP
reported.
   If the report on the deportations was true, it would seem to
violate assurances reportedly given West Germany by the
non-Communist foreign minister, Krzysztof Skubiszewski, that no
East German on Polish territory would be sent home against his will.
   Henryk Wozniakowski, deputy government spokesman, said it
appeared such incidents had occurred. He said the matter was being
brought to the attention of Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki.
   Wozniakowski said returning refugees to East Germany could be
justified on purely legal grounds, but he expected Mazowiecki would
take a ``human rights'' approach.
   Gazeta Wyborcza, the pro-Solidarity paper, said the four East
Germans were asked for their documents at Szczecin in northwestern
Poland, and were sent back when they could not produce the exit
permits issued by East German authorities to legal travelers to
Poland.
   Interior Ministry spokesman Andrzej Sadlinski said Monday that,
as far as he knew, border troops returned to East Germany only
those people apprehended in the border zone while still trying to
enter Poland.
   Asked about the Gazeta Wyborcza report, he said: ``I personally
have not heard of such incidents.''
   Solidarity parliamentary leader Bronislaw Geremek, asked if
Poland should give a right of asylum to all East Germans fleeing
their country, said ``the same values and freedoms we fight for
should be present in Polish foreign policy.''
   Geremek said he supported the previously employed solution to
the question of refugees in Poland. Two East German trains carrying
more than 1,400 refugees were allowed to leave Poland last week for
West Germany.
   ``Human rights and international conventions'' governing free
movement of refugees should be the first consideration, Geremek
said.
   Since the last train left Thursday night, up to 400 new refugees
have reached the West German Embassy in Poland, including about 40
new arrivals Monday.
   Roman Catholic church groups, charitable organizations and the
Polish Red Cross are helping care for the refugees, PAP reported.
   ``By providing accomodation, food and clothers, if needed, we
are granting strictly humanitarian aid,'' the Red Cross general
secretary, Izabela Gutfeter, told the agency. She said it was
cooperating with the West German Red Cross.
   Government spokeswoman Malgorzata Niezabitowska said Friday that
407 East Germans trying to enter Poland illegally were turned back
at the border by Polish border guards.
   Unlike Czechoslovakia, Poland has not demanded that the East
Germans in Warsaw remain on West German embassy grounds. It even
has helped shelter them in vacation hotels on the outskirts of
Warsaw.

   President Francois Mitterrand of
France was overcome by 90-degree heat Monday at a welcoming
ceremony at the capital's airport, French officials said.
   A French Embassy spokeswoman said the president ``felt
indisposed because of the heat'' but that he ``was all right''
after having rested.
   During the ceremony at Maiquetia airport, the 72-year-old
president slumped heavily against a wall in the hot weather, and
officials rushed to offer the French leader a chair, witnesses said.
   The ceremony was cut short, and Mitterrand left the airport
immediately for downtown. However, he kept up scheduled activities
later in the day, including a meeting with President Carlos Andres
Perez.
   In Guadeloupe in the morning, Mitterrand told victims of
Hurricane Hugo the French Parliament will consider subsidies to
those who lost their homes when Hugo slammed into the
French-governed Caribbean island three weeks ago.
   Mitterrand came to Venezuela on a 48-hour state visit with his
wife, Danielle. He was scheduled to leave for Quito, Ecuador, on
Wednesday.

<HEAD>Police Search for Attackers of Jewish Students</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VIRGINIA BYRNE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Investigators spent Monday's solemn Jewish
holiday of Yom Kippur canvassing a neighborhood where three Jewish
college students were severely beaten by up to 20 young people who
shouted anti-Semitic slurs.
   No arrests had been made in the case, but Inspector Paul
Sanderson said, ``We have good leads.''
   ``What's holding us back at this point is that it is a high
Jewish holiday,'' said Sanderson, commanding officer of the police
department's Bias Incident Investigating Squad. ``The people who
could assist us are not available.''
   The attackers were described as white men in their late teens
and early 20s.
   The attack in the heavily Jewish Midwood section was the most
vicious of the 107 anti-Semitic incidents reported in the city so
far this year, said Sanderson.
   ``What you're talking about is two teen-agers, one of whom had
his skull fractured, the other of whom has a broken leg. These are
certainly serious injuries,'' Sanderson said. The third student
refused treatment.
   The three Brooklyn College students were attacked with fists,
feet and beer bottles early Sunday when they emerged from a party
at the Hillel House Jewish student center, said police Sgt. Diane
Kubler.
   Some witnesses told police the gang had come from a nearby bar,
known as a gathering place for area toughs.
   The motive for the attack appeared to be ethnic hatred, police
said. ``If you're looking for logic, forget about it,'' said a
police source who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   During the first nine months of this year, there were 107
reported bias crimes against synagogues, Jewish people, yeshivas
and Jewish businesses and residences, compared to 105 reports of
similar crimes during the same period last year, Sanderson said.
   One of the students was in critical but stable condition with a
ruptured spleen, broken leg and knee injuries, said Kings County
Hospital administrator Robert Epps. A second was in fair condition
at Downstate Medical Center with a skull fracture, said
administrator Brenda Goss.

   Israeli soldiers opened fire Monday on masked
Arabs who were marching with outlawed Palestinian flags in the West
Bank town of Nablus, killing one of them.
   It was the second fatal shooting in as many days in Nablus, the
West Bank's largest town, and occurred during an army curfew
imposed on the 120,000 residents.
   Earlier Monday, three soldiers were injured when an assailant
hurled a firebomb at their patrol in Nablus, the army said. One
soldier suffered moderate wounds, and two sustained minor injuries,
the army said.
   Also Monday, a 5-year-old Palestinian girl, Ulfat Nassar, was
shot in the head when Israeli troops clashed with stone-throwing
Arab demonstrators in the Tulkarem refugee camp northwest of Nablus.
   Doctors at Rafidya Hospital in Nablus said she was in
``extremely critical condition.''
   In an interview broadcast Sunday by Israel television, Lt. Gen.
Dan Shomron, the army chief of staff, said the army could not end
the 22-month-old Palestinian uprising by itself.
   ``No doubt that this type of popular uprising, no matter where
it occurs, happens from motivation that is impossible to end in one
action,'' he said. ``It is a long process. There is no such thing
as a military solution.''
   The violence came as Jews marked Yom Kippur, the Day of
Atonement, with fasting and prayers. The holiday, Judaism's
holiest, ended at sundown.
   Shops and businesses were closed in Arab east Jerusalem and in
the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip to mark the start of the 23rd
month of the Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation.
   The general strike was to continue Tuesday, the fourth and final
day of a series of closures called by the underground leadership of
the uprising in sympathy with residents of the town of Beit Sahour.
   Israeli soldiers and tax collectors have raided shops and homes
in Beit Sahour, near Bethlehem, for more than two weeks because of
an Arab boycott of taxes. Residents say more than $750,000 worth of
furniture and machinery has been confiscated.
   In Nablus, about a dozen Palestinian men were marching near the
Najar University campus when an army patrol spotted them and gave
chase, the army said.
   Witnesses said when the demonstrators failed to stop, the
soldiers opened fire, killing one of the Palestinians. The army
identified the victim as Nidal El-Habash, 22.
   Earlier, the army spokesman's office earlier confirmed soldiers
shot and killed a masked Palestinian on Sunday who was among a
group demonstrating in the Nablus central market.
   The spokesman, who cannot be identified by name under military
rules, said some of the Palestinians were armed with swords or
knives. He said troops opened fire when the Palestinians failed to
respond to shouts and warning shots.
   Arab reports identified man killed Sunday as Ghassan Hudhud, 32.
   The latest deaths raised to 587 the number of Palestinians
killed since Arabs launched their uprising in December 1987 against
Israeli rule in the territories. Another 127 Palestinians have been
killed by fellow Arabs, most on suspicion of collaborating with
Israel. Forty Israelis have died.
   Nablus residents said that after the Sunday shooting, Israeli
troops fired tear-gas to quell disturbances.
   There were reports that a 75-year-old Palestinian man, Ahmad
Serwan, died after a tear gas shell landed outside his home.
   Dr. Asem Abu Shamma, a volunteer with the Red Crescent in
Nablus, said Serwan suffered from asthma and that the death
appeared to be the result of tear gas inhalation.
   The army spokesman's office said it had no reports of tear gas
being fired by the army but was checking.
   In the Gaza Strip on Monday, six Palestinian were shot and
wounded by Israeli troops in scattered stone-throwing clashes,
hospitals reported. The army had no casualty reports from Gaza
because of the holiday.

   Solidarity's shipyard workers have built
lots of vessels over the years, but they finally will have one they
can call their own.
   The state Polish Shipping Co. announced Monday it plans to name
a ship under construction ``Solidarnosc'' in honor of the formerly
banned trade union led by Lech Walesa that won legal status again
this year, the state PAP news agency said.
   The ship is scheduled to be completed by December 1991, said the
shipping monopoly, based in Szczecin.
   The proposal for the name came from Solidarity members at the
shipping company, PAP said.
   Union members first applied to name a ship Solidarnosc in
December 1980. But ``due to developments in December 1981, the idea
did not come off,'' said PAP in reference to the imposition of
martial law and subsequent ban on Solidarity.
   Solidarity was legalized again in April and Poland's new prime
minister, Tadeusz Mazowiecki, is a Solidarity activist.

   Gov. Bob Martinez refused to concede
defeat Monday on the eve of the nation's first legislative action
on abortion since a U.S. Supreme Court decision, despite
predictions that nothing will be done.
   ``I do believe that the debate has already caused victory in my
mind in the sense that we're now looking at it (the fetus) as part
of the human race,'' Martinez told reporters as a few anti-abortion
pickets walked outside the Capitol.
   The governor called a special session beginning Tuesday to
consider restrictions on abortions as a result of the U.S. Supreme
Court's July 3 ruling upholding Missouri state restrictions on
abortions.
   Thousands of activists on both sides of the issue flocked to the
city for the session, and security was tight Monday.
   Martinez's proposals include requiring viability tests if women
20 weeks pregnant seek abortions; banning the use of public
recources for abortions; expanding the regulations abortion clinics
must abide by and requiring physicians to tell women seeking
abortions about the development of their fetuses.
   Legislative leaders have said all summer that there's little
chance of any of the governor's objectives making it through
committees. And the anti-abortion movement suffered a defeat last
week when the state Supreme Court struck down a 1988 parental
consent law, ruling it violated a privacy clause in the state
Constitution.
   The heads of key committees have said new abortion regulations
would not make it to the floor.
   Senate President Bob Crawford said he had assured anti-abortion
forces only that proposals for greater regulations would get a fair
hearing, not that they would go to the floor.
   A couple of lawmakers have had body guards assigned to them,
according to Crawford.
   Earlier Monday, a national pro-choice official accused Martinez
of ``playing politics'' with women's lives.
   ``Tomorrow will be judgment day in Tallahassee,'' said Kate
Michelman, executive director of the National Abortion Rights
Action League. ``What happens here will resonate in every corner of
this nation.''
   ``For Governor Martinez, this special session will be a crashing
disappointment and a major political embarrassment,'' Ms. Michelman
said in an address to the Florida Abortion Council.
   Her comments were echoed at a news conference later by Patricia
Ireland, executive vice president of the National Organization for
Women, and Eleanor Smeal, president of the Feminist Majority. They
called the legislative an exercise in futility.
   Smeal criticized Martinez, a Roman Catholic, for attempting to
impose his religious views on abortion on the rest of the state.

   Tens of thousands of demonstrators marched and
shouted ``We Need Freedom!'' in Leipzig on Monday during the
largest pro-democracy rally in East Germany since a 1953 workers'
uprising, witnesses said.
   Protesters also held a vigil in East Berlin to demand democratic
reforms after a weekend of demonstrations across this hard-line
Communist nation.
   On Saturday and Sunday, clashes broke out between police and
demonstrators with hundreds arrested, several injuries, and one
death reported by news organizations and witnesses. The government
has issued no official toll.
   Christoph Wonneberger, pastor for the Lukas Lutheran Church in
Leipzig, said ``at least'' 70,000 demonstrators marched in Leipzig
on Monday night.
   Wonneberger said he was surprised by the restraint of police and
paramilitary troops who were deployed nearby.
   ``Even though this demonstration is the largest (since 1953), to
our knowledge it went off completely without violence,'' he said in
a telephone interview with West Germany's ZDF television network.
   In 1953, Soviet forces crushed a workers' uprising.
   Some Leipzig demonstrators even ``began conversations with
paramilitary troops'' after the crowd started dispersing by
mid-evening, Wonneberger said.
   He said, ``I consider this (police restraint) a very hopeful
sign following the violence'' in earlier demonstrations.
   Police clubbed pro-democracy protesters in six East German
cities over the weekend and an opposition leader said that unless
the government eases its policies, violence may increase.
   Before the Leipzig march, officials of the Leipzig Communist
Party promised publicly they would push for an open dialogue
between citizens and the government, church sources said.
   In a public statement, the Leipzig party officials said, ``We
all need a free exchange of ideas about how we should continue
socialism in our nation,'' according to the church sources.
   The country's communist leadership celebrated East Germany's
40th anniversary over the weekend with a visit by Soviet President
Mikhail Gorbachev and declared it would not change its tough stand.
West Germany and other Western countries have also pressed East
Germany in past months to make reforms to stem a wave of refugees
heading to the West.
   In Leipzig on Monday, the protesters marched after attending a
traditional Monday evening prayer service at St. Nicholas Lutheran
Church, witnesses said.
   Throngs of people joined them along the way, they said.
   Among their slogans, the Leipzig protesters on Monday shouted
``Democracy!'' and ``No violence!'' said the witnesses, who spoke
on condition of anonymity.
   A larger number of police officers did not stop the march but
cordoned off the downtown area, the witnesses said. ZDF television
said armored personnel carriers also were seen in the area.
   In East Berlin, several thousand demonstrators gathered in front
of the Lutheran Gethsemane Church for the pro-democracy vigil, West
German media reported. ``Police have shown restraint so far,''
radio and television said.
   Earlier Monday, 18 Lutheran Church leaders issued an appeal in
East Berlin calling on East Germany's government to approve broad
democratic reforms and urging all sides to refrain from violence.
   The Rev. Rainer Eppelmann, an opposition leader and Lutheran
pastor in East Berlin, said Monday on RIAS radio in West Berlin
that the doctrinaire regime must ``talk with the people about their
wishes and needs'' or violence may rise.
   West Germany's ARD television said many of the hundreds arrested
during the weekend protests already had been sentenced to jail
terms of up to six months.
   Church sources said a participant in a demonstration last week
was run over by a train and lost both his legs.
   Saechsische Zeitung, a government daily in Dresden, has said a
person was ``seriously injured'' when thousands of people tried to
board freedom trains that passed through Dresden carrying East
German refugees from Czechoslovakia to the West.
   West Germany's government protested police harassment of
journalists covering the weekend protests. Police broke several
cameras and ordered some photographers and television crews out of
the country.
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl denounced the East German government
Monday as ``rigidly authoritarian.''
   Up to 15,000 pro-democracy activists held a sit-in Sunday
evening in Dresden and thousands of others protested in East
Berlin, Leipzig, Potsdam, Jena, Plauen and Karl-Marx-Stadt over the
weekend. Witnesses said police used dogs and clubs to disperse
peaceful demonstrators.
   Junge Welt, the Communist Party youth newspaper, said the ``gang
of Western news reporters'' stirred up the protests.
   Tens of thousands of East Germans have fled to West Germany in
recent weeks in the largest exodus since the Berlin Wall was built
in 1961. Many of those remaining hope Gorbachev will persuade their
government to undertake political and economic reforms.
   Including legal emigrants, more than 100,000 East Germans have
gone to the West this year. Mary Alice Dorrance Malone, $660, Coatesville,

<HEAD>Protesters Get Their Way: No More `Evil' in Medieval Festival</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A local charitable organization
canceled plans Monday to hold a medieval festival after
fundamentalist Christians protested the ``evil'' implications of
the Friday the 13th event.
   ``For the greater good we thought we would just accommodate
them,'' said William Doyle, an organization volunteer for the
Saratoga Springs chapter of the American Cancer Society.
   The festival, originally intended to feature tarot card and
astrology readings, was changed to a general costume ball.
   ``It's crazy,'' said psychic Ann Fisher, the fair's honorary
chairwoman. ``It's a misinterpretation of the period of history.
We're just trying to do something good. It's a fund-raiser.''
   But protesters said they found more than the date and its
featured events ominous, claiming mystic references in fliers
advertising the festival.
   ``Tarot card readings or fortune-telling or things like that
would bring in spiritual forces that are very dangerous,'' said
Rev. Eric Walton, pastor of the Clifton Park Center Baptist Church,
about 20 miles north of Albany.
   Members of the church also protested such things as Life
magazine's cover featuring a woman wearing a bra.
   Doyle said some protesters also objected to the word medieval,
believing its ending sounded ``evil.''
   The idea of the fair was objectionable, not just the scheduled
events, said Paul Lincoln, chairman of the board of Maranatha
Baptist Church in nearby Ballston Spa.
   ``It sure would, because of the evil spirits. You're getting
into the spirit realm and the devil,'' he said. ``We're certainly
against it.''
   Doyle said he was not sure why the protesters had singled out
Friday's function since similar events held in the area had not
been targeted in the past.
   Pat Brown, organizer of the Medieval Faire at the Cathedral of
All Saints in Albany, also set for Friday, said her organization
had heard no protests.

<HEAD>Papandreou Fails in Bid to Form Greek Government</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PHILIP DOPOULOS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Premier Andreas Papandreou failed
Monday to persuade other leftist forces to join his socialist camp
in a coalition government.
   The collapse of that effort means Greeks face new general
elections in November, only five months after the last voting.
   Papandreou told President Christos Sartzetakis on Monday he had
failed in his three-day presidential mandate for form a new
government.
   Emerging from the presidential palace in Athens, the 70-year-old
Papandreou told reporters he outlined proposals of his Panhellenic
Socialist Movement in a memorandum to the president. However, he
did not elaborate.
   Later in the day, Communist Party chief Harilaos Florakis was
summoned to the presidential palace, but he declined to try to put
together a government.
   The political crisis stems from the elections June 18, when no
party won a majority in parliament. Conservatives and leftists
banded together in an unusual alliance to press forward legal
action against socialist officials accused of corruption, including
Papandreou himself.
   However, the alliance said it would govern only temporarily, and
its government stepped down after three months. Conservative New
Democracy Party leader Constantine Mitsotakis has agreed to remain
caretaker until a new government is formed.
   He too has rejected a presidential mandate to try to form a
government, saying he wanted to ``quickly clear any obstacles to
elections'' on Nov. 5.
   Parliament has accused Papandreou of corruption in connection
with a $210 million embezzlement scandal at the Bank of Crete and
with purported wiretapping of political friends and enemies.
   Lawmakers last month sent Papandreou's case to special courts.
They are scheduled to convene within 60 days to try him along with
several ex-ministers.
   If found guilty, Papandreou could receive up to 20 years in
prison.

   It was a close encounter of the communist kind.
   Towering, tiny-headed humanoids from outer space landed their
UFO in the Russian city of Voronezh and emerged for a promenade
around the park, spreading fear among residents.
   At least that's what the official Tass news agency said Monday.
   Tass, contributing to a string of weird tales that have crept
into the formerly stuffy state-controlled media in recent months,
said in a straight-faced report that Soviet scientists vouched for
the UFO's landing.
   ``Scientists have confirmed that an unidentified flying object
recently landed in a park in the Russian city of Voronezh,'' Tass
said. ``They have also identified the landing site and found traces
of aliens who made a short promenade about the park.''
   A Tass duty officer, contacted Monday evening by telephone,
refused to identify the reporter who sent the dispatch from
Voronezh, but stood by the story. ``It is not April Fool's today,''
he said.
   The Soviet media, unleashed by the Kremlin's policy of glasnost
_ greater openness _ feel free now to hype incredible stories that
seem more at home in the supermarket tabloids of the West. Recent
examples include other accounts of UFOs, sightings of abominable
snowman-type creatures and a tale about a young mystic who goes
into a trance and flies about the cosmos. A rash of mystics and
ESP-artists also have invaded state TV.
   In Buffalo, N.Y., Paul Kurtz, chairman of the Committee for the
Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal, commented:
``We're extremely skeptical of this claim. It's not the first one
(in the Soviet media). There's many. There seems to be a rash of
reports, largely uncorroborated.''
   According to Monday's Tass report, a large shining ball or disk
was seen hovering over the park by Voronezh residents. They saw the
UFO land and up to three creatures similar to humans emerge,
accompanied by a small robot, Tass said.
   ``The aliens were three or even four meters tall (almost 10 feet
to 13 feet), but with very small heads,'' the news agency quoted
witnesses as saying. ``They walked near the ball or disc and then
disappeared inside.''
   The report resembled a story last summer in the daily newspaper
Socialist Industry, which carried an alleged ``close encounter''
between a milkmaid and an alien in Central Russia's Perm region.
   In that report, milkmaid Lyubov Medvedev was quoted as saying
she encountered an alien creature ``resembling a man, but taller
than average with short legs.'' The creature, she said, had ``only
a small knob instead of a head.''
   Stanton Friedman, a consultant who lectures on the topic
``Flying Saucers Are Real'' and has examined Soviet studies of
UFOs, said in Secaucus, N.J., on Monday that Soviet scientists
tended to treat the subject more seriously than American
scientists. Last June, the Soviet publication Soviet Military
Review included an article on ``UFO's and Security.''
   The Tass report, which did not give the date of the purported
``landing'' in Voronezh, said onlookers were ``overwhelmed with a
fear that lasted for several days.''
   Genrikh Silanov, head of the Voronezh Geophysical Laboratory,
told Tass that scientists investigating the UFO report found a
20-yard depression with four deep dents, as well as two pieces of
unidentified rocks.
   ``At first glance, they looked like sandstone of a deep-red
color. However, mineralogical analysis has shown that the substance
cannot be found on Earth,'' Tass quoted Silanov as saying.
``However, additional tests are needed to reach a more definite
conclusion,'' he said.
   Silanov said the landing site and path taken by the aliens was
confirmed using the ``biolocation'' method of tracking. The agency
did not explain what that was.
   Further confirmation came from witnesses in Voronezh, 300 miles
southeast of Moscow, who were not told of the experiments and whose
accounts coincided precisely with the scientific findings, Tass
said.
   In July, Tass deflated a report in Socialist Industry quoting a
UFO specialist, A. Kuzovkin, as saying a 26-foot-wide patch of
burned ground near southern Moscow was probably caused by the
landing of a UFO.
   Not so, Tass reported. Firefighters think a haystack simply
caught fire and scorched the ground.
   Russians have long been fascinated by the weird and the occult,
but formerly they could glean their information only from rumors
and underground copies of everything from palmistry guides to books
on Eastern mysticism.
   The Kremlin's economic reforms, with their emphasis on each
enterprise paying its own way, have also given the official press
more incentive to cater to readers' tastes in order to increase
circulation.
   Kurtz's committee has a UFO subcommittee and has been
investigating the claim made by Tass.
   Kurtz, a professor of philosophy at the State University of New
York at Buffalo, said Monday:
   ``Since the press freedoms in the last year, increasingly it
seems to be open season. Paranormal pandemonium has broken out in
the Soviet Union, not only with UFOs, but faith healers,
astrologers and so on. In a closed society such as the Soviet
Union, you don't get the development of critical reason.''
   He said the account ``has all the characteristics of science
fiction.''
   Kurtz noted that scientist Silanov says the landing was
confirmed by biolocation _ ``As far as we can tell it's a kind of
dowsing. We're very questioning of that. It's hardly a scientific
method of testing whether anything's landed or not.''
   ``If this were true,'' Kurtz remarked, ``I think chairman
(Mikhail) Gorbachev would call a press conference and proudly
announce that, with everybody attempting to get out of the Soviet
Union, at long last here are some extraterrestrials in that Union.''

   Chants of ``We want the A's'' rang out in
Pat O'Shea's Madhatter bar Monday as elated patrons roared with
their fists in the air and hugged strangers after the Giants
clinched a spot in the World Series _ a Bay Bridge Series.
   Excitement was equally intense among Oakland A's fans on the
opposite side of the bay who are anxious for their favorite team to
tackle the men in orange and black.
   ``Everyone was hollering `Bring 'em on! We're ready!''' said
Jerry Figone, owner of the Golden Bear bar on Oakland's Lake
Merritt, where Athletics' fans massed to watch the Giants' victory
over the Chicago Cubs on big-screen TVs, a day after the A's beat
the Toronto Blue Jays.
   ``We really want to play 'em to decide once and for all who's
best,'' he said.
   ``Everybody took a four-hour lunch. From 11 a.m. on we were just
packed,'' said Bobby Ricardo, whose family owns Ricky's, a popular
joint filled with giant screen TVs and dozens of smaller monitors.
   ``Everybody is just amazed that the dream came true; that it's
the A's and Giants,'' he said. ``It's a once in a lifetime thing.
We're all as happy as we could be. No one's going to lose. We've
already won with the Bay Bridge Series.''
   He said A's fans had been rooting for the Giants and vice versa
all weekend.
   The last time a World Series was played in one metropolitan area
was 1956, when the New York Yankees beat the Brooklyn Dodgers in
seven games.
   As soon as the game at Candlestick ended, San Francisco police
reported crowds pouring into North Beach, where Columbus Day
celebrations were under way in the predominantly Italian
neighborhood. Nighttime revelry along North Beach's Broadway is
traditional after a major victory for a San Francisco sports team.
   At O'Shea's on Geary Street, about 150 young people were
ecstatic about the Bay Bridge Series.
   ``If you asked me, in my wildest dreams, if there would be a Bay
Bridge World Series, I'd tell you you're nuts,'' said Dave Stein,
of Los Gatos, who said he has attended Giants games for a decade.
   At the ballpark, fan Gary Stevenson shouted: ``Fantastic!
Incredible!''
   Despite the jubilation, there was no concensus about the outcome.
   ``Heart's going to win the series and the Giants have a lot of
heart,'' said John Hayward of San Francisco at Pat O'Shea's.
   ``The A's in five,'' retorted another fan who added: ``The A's
have the pitching, the A's have Ricky Henderson and the A's have
the power.''
   Kelly Pratt, bartender at Brew Pub on the Green in Fremont, said
the rivalry between A's and Giants fans is going to be ``hard,
maybe impossible to contain, maybe even a little dangerous.
Everybody's getting pretty rowdy.''
   The bar's patrons generally are evenly divided on the teams
because of its location, 20 miles to Oakland and an equal distance
to the South Bay, a tranditional stronghold of Giants fans. He
expects the bar to cordon off areas for each team to keep the fans
separate.
   O'Shea's patrons included at least one lonely Cubs fan, Bill
Hurstik, a former Chicagoan now living in Grand Junction, Colo. He
stood by quietly as the Giants partisans whooped it up.
   ``There's always next year; we'll get another pitcher from
somewhere.''

<HEAD>Timman Holds Draw in Resumed Fourth Game; Leads Speelman 3-2</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GOODMAN</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jan Timman of the Netherlands drew a marathon
116-move battle with Jon Speelman of England in the resumed fourth
round game of the World Chess Championship Candidate semifinal
Monday to retain his one point lead.
   The two had played the fifth game of eight on Sunday and Timman
now leads 3-2. A win scores one point and a draw a half.
   Play was adjourned after six hours play Saturday night when
Speelman sealed his 64th move in a position well known as a
technical draw, but where Speelman could test Timman's defensive
technique for many moves.
   But Timman, well-primed after overnight analysis of the
position, rattled off his moves on Monday until Speelman gave up
and offered a draw on the 116th move.
   The winner of the Candidates' cycle will challenge world
champion Garri Kasparov for his title in a 24-game contest
beginning in October 1990. The winning semifinalists will face off
in the Candidates' final next March.
   In the other semifinal, former world champion Anatoly Karpov
leads fellow Soviet Artur Yusupov 2.5-1.5 after four games.
   The Soviets are one game behind because Yusupov took a timeout
on Sunday postponing his fifth game with Karpov until Tuesday.
   The sixth game between Speelman and Timman is also scheduled for
Tuesday.
   If either match ends in a 4-4 tie, two further games will be
played, followed if necessary by sudden-death tiebreakers.

   Leftist guerrillas killed a political
candidate's driver Monday and insurgents from another group
kidnapped a rancher in the country's latest outbreak of rebel
attacks, authorities said.
   Police said three Maoist Shining Path rebels killed the
chauffeur of the mayoral candidate Monday in Concepcion, 120 miles
east of Lima.
   They said the candidate, Richard Muller of the center-right
Fredemo Party, was not in his car when the rebels sprayed it with
gunfire. A bodyguard was also wounded, authorities said.
   Shining Path rebels have assassinated 50 mayors the past five
years. They are now seeking to disrupt municipal elections
scheduled for Nov. 12.
   The group began its armed insurgency against Peru's elected
government in 1980.
   Authorities also said rebels of the pro-Cuban Tupac Amaru
Revolutionary Movement kidnapped rancher Oswaldo Zender from his
home after setting fire to the Iscozasin town hall, about 140 miles
northeast of Lima.
   The rebels left a note for Zender's family demanding $100,000 in
ransom.
   The Tupac Amaru group operates separately from the Shining Path.
It took up arms in 1984 and has mostly engaged in urban attacks
against government and business targets.
   The government says more than 15,000 people have died during
nine years of rebel violence.

   Floods from Typhoon Angela drowned at
least 45 people and left 50 others missing in coastal villages
north of Manila, officials said Monday.
   The Red Cross and the Office of Civil Defense said the
casualties occurred last week in Gonzaga, 250 miles north of
Manila, and nearby Santa Ana.
   Twenty-six drowned in Gonzaga and 19 in Santa Ana, officials
said. The 50 missing were scattered in communities along the
northern coast of Luzon, the main Philippine island.
   Casualty reports from typhoons often take days to reach Manila
because of the country's poor communications system.
   Typhoon Angela swept across the mountainous northern coast
Friday with winds up to 108 mph before entering the South China Sea.
   On Monday, the storm was reported to be in the Paracel islands
headed toward Vietnam.

   The Foreign Office on Monday rejected a Chinese
official's accusation that Britain is conniving with activists in
Hong Kong to overthrow China's government.
   The Chinese army's attacks on pro-democracy students in June,
which left hundreds dead, ``are the cause of the loss of confidence
in Hong Kong,'' said a Foreign Office spokesman.
   The British colony is scheduled to revert to Chinese rule in
1997.
   ``As for the view that we have connived at acts of sabotage in
an attempt to overthrow the Chinese government, that is quite
wrong,'' said the spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   ``The people of Hong Kong attach great importance to democratic
freedoms, under their own legal system,'' he said. ``Equally it is
important that such freedoms are used with a sense of
responsibility.
   ``There is no evidence that Hong Kong is used as a base for
activities against the Chinese government. The democratic freedoms
of Hong Kong must be preserved.''
   Ke Zaishuo, who heads China's delegation to a Chinese-British
liaison committee on Hong Kong, on Sunday accused Britain of
adopting an ``attitude of connivance'' toward alleged efforts in
Hong Kong to overthrow the Communist government. He did not
elaborate on the charge.
   The official Xinhua News Agency also quoted Ke as saying Britain
had ``unshirkable responsibility'' for widespread fears in Hong
Kong about the Chinese takeover that have triggered mass efforts to
emigrate.
   Hundreds of thousands of Hong Kong residents have protested the
army attack in Beijing, and several groups have been formed to work
for democratic change in China. China has called the groups
subversive but Hong Kong's British-appointed governor has refused
to ban them.

   The stench of rotting rats drove a
group of public defenders from their office trailer in February and
they're still homeless because no one will rent them space.
   The attorneys say landlords near South Orange County Municipal
Court don't want them as tenants because they don't want a steady
stream of criminal defendants in their buildings.
   ``Most of the people seem to have the idea that with us come the
riffraff of Orange County. That's just not the case,'' said Bob
Goss, the senior deputy public defender who shut down the old
offices because of the stink.
   The court's presiding judge, Pamela Iles, said the public
defenders' clientele is by and large not dangerous.
   ``They are indigent and they deserve attorneys just like people
with money,'' she said.
   The defenders represent 350 people a month. They have long
needed more space, but the crunch became a crisis when a county
pest extermination effort left the old trailer's walls and floors
filled with decaying rat remains.
   For the time being, the defenders work out of a tiny temporary
trailer and a meeting room at a library down the hill from the
court. Files and law books are stored at the courthouse.
   ``At this point the rats are starting to look good,'' said Carl
Holmes, the county's chief deputy public defender.
   The solution appears to be a plan to add a two-story building at
South Court. Susan Novak, an analyst for the county administrative
office, will pitch the idea to the county Board of Supervisors in
several weeks.

<HEAD>Furor in Colombia Over Reports President Contacted Drug Cartels</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STAN YARBRO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Colombia was in an uproar Monday over
whether President Virgilio Barco explored a possible truce with the
cocaine cartels, even as new raids were reported in Barco's
declared war on drug traffickers.
   Authorities raided five cocaine laboratories along the Rosario
River in southwestern Narino state, arrested eight people and
destroyed a ton of coca leaves used to make the drug, the national
radio chain Caracol reported, citing the commander of the state's
antinarcotics police as its source.
   Police also reportedly seized weapons as well as coca seeds and
chemicals used in processing cocaine.
   With the president's credibility at stake in his war on drugs,
former Interior Minister Joaquin Vallejo confirmed in published
reports Sunday that he acted as a go-between in truce negotiations
between the Medellin cartel and Barco's government.
   The Bogota daily La Prensa on Saturday revealed Vallejo's role
in the alleged negotiations and the 76-year-old Vallejo confirmed
that role in interviews published Sunday by Bogota newspapers El
Tiempo and El Espectador.
   Vallejo reportedly said there were never any direct negotiations
and the subject was approached only through intermediaries.
   He was quoted as saying the government did not discourage the
contacts that started in September 1988 and ended almost a year
later.
   The contact roles were played by a Medellin lawyer representing
the traffickers; Vallejo as the messenger; and Barco's general
secretary, German Montoya, who fielded the messages, Vallejo was
quoted as saying.
   Montoya had said such negotiations would be possible only if the
United States and other cocaine-consuming countries agreed to
participate, the papers quoted Vallejo as saying.
   They quoted Vallejo as saying the U.S. government's strong
opposition to any dealings with the drug lords made direct
negotiations impossible.
   ``Since the program of President Bush has been to fight drugs
militarily, the Colombian government had big problems convincing
the administration to accept the arrangement,'' Vallejo said,
according to El Tiempo.
   ``This is going to generate a huge national debate,'' El
Espectador quoted Fabio Valencia, an opposition Conservative Party
senator, as saying. ``It seems to me that the government continues
to handle matters with a double morality.''
   Montoya said in a communique Saturday night that he had not
negotiated with traffickers and vehemently denied the La Prensa
account. He said his decision to meet with Vallejo was a personal
one and that he told Vallejo negotiations with the drug traffickers
was not possible.
   Memos and other documents about the purported contacts were
delivered to La Prensa by Alvaro Leyva, a Conservative Party
senator.
   He was quoted as saying in an interview published Sunday in El
Espectador that he wondered if the Barco administration ``tricked
everyone'' by negotiating with traffickers while maintaining a
hard-line public stance against them.
   Barco unleashed a campaign against traffickers Aug. 19, one day
after Sen. Luis Carlos Galan, a leading presidential candidate, was
killed, ostensibly by hitmen hired by drug traffickers.
   Barco has said repeatedly since the crackdown began that he will
never negotiate with the drug lords.
   Traffickers reacted to the government declaration of war against
them with a bombing campaign.

   Rock star Billy Idol rampaged through
the suites of three luxury hotels in Thailand during a recent visit

   Idol also reportedly trashed rooms in two Bangkok hotels during
his September vacation in Thailand, according to Chanis and another
hotel manager.
   Chanis said officials at the Royal Cliff tried to stop Idol, but
a friend insisted he be left alone. The friend ``assured us that
Idol would pay for the damages in full,'' the manager said.
   Idol later shelled out $11,200 for damage to his three-bedroom
suite, which included a smashed television set, shattered sliding
windows and hacked teakwood furniture, according to Chanis.
   He also paid $3,200 for damages to Bangkok's Oriental Hotel and
$6,000 for damages to the Royal Orchid Sheraton in Bangkok,
according to Chanis and a spokesman for the Oriental.
   The singer's New York publicist, Ellen Golden, said in a
telephone interview late Monday, ``We've decided that we will no
longer comment on these stories about Billy Idol. They are always
exaggerated.''
   Asked if she could confirm the story and that Idol was in
Bangkok during September, the publicist said she would not go
beyond her comment.

   The pumpkin-growing world crowned a new
champion Monday _ a record 755-pounder that measures more than 12
feet around.
   The entry of a retired agriculture agent from Canada, Gordon
Thomson, was 84 pounds heavier than the previous record of 671
pounds set in 1986 at the international World Pumpkin Weigh-Off.
   ``It acted like No. 1 from the time it started,'' Thomson said.
   Thomson of Hemmingford, Quebec, said he owes his success to
quality seed, a lot of luck and ``good Holstein cow manure.''
   ``If you're used to agriculture and you're used to growing
things you can see when you've got something different,'' said
Thomson, who retired four years ago from the Canadian Ministry of
Agriculture.
   Thomson brought his pumpkin to Collins from Canada in the bed of
a pickup truck. It tipped the scales at 755 pounds, measuring 151.5
inches in circumference. Thomson won $3,000.
   Organizers of the seventh-annual event said no pumpkin weighing
more than 700 pounds had been recorded before Thomson's winner.
   The Collins-based World Pumpkin Confederation, a group of
growers and other pumpkin enthusiasts, is host for the competition.
Volunteers from the group help weigh pumpkins in Collins and take
telephone calls during the event from weigh stations in 21 other
spots in the United States, Canada, Belgium, Australia and England.
   Thomson's pumpkin was not the only record-breaker at the
competition.
   Leonard Stelpflug of Honeoye Falls, N.Y., had the winning squash
at 743 pounds, and Waddell Estep of Donaldson, Ark., grew the
largest watermelon at 227.5 pounds. Each received $1,000.

   The ruling Hungarian communist party
that earlier changed its name and embraced democratic aspirations
elected the centrist leader of the old party on Monday to head a
slate of reformers in the new one.
   Rezsoe Nyers, president of the Hungarian Socialist Party, told
reporters Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev was the first to
congratulate him.
   ``Gorbachev conducts very fast diplomacy,'' a tired but elated
Nyers said. ``They gave me his telegram within two hours of my
election.''
   He was named president in closed session after key reformists
reluctantly shelved some of their reservations about him to avoid a
possible split.
   Spokesman Emil Kimmel told state TV the congress also elected a
25-member National Steering Committee, the new party's executive
leadership and successor of the communist party Politburo.
   Delegates said reformists Imre Pozsgay and Premier Miklos
Nemeth, members of the old party's collective leadership, were
among the 25. They were not picked as deputies to Nyers, however,
in a new indication of resistance to too much radical reformist
influence.
   The new party's statutes provide for two vice presidents, but
Nyers told reporters, ``The congress could not agree on choices for
these positions.''
   A copy of the Steering Committee list given to The Associated
Press contained names of reformers only, including some former
Politburo members such as Foreign Minister Gyula Horn.
   Missing were Politburo members considered less enthusiatic about
reform, including party spokesman Janos Barabas.
   Politburo member Karoly Grosz, the most conservative of the old
party's collective leadership, also was not elected to the Steering
Committee, but said beforehand he would not seek a senior post.
   The clearly reformist makeup of the executive body was expected
to gratify some liberals unhappy with the choice of Nyers, former
chairman of the communist party.
   Delegate Gyoergy Kerekes said Nyers won the support of 86
percent of those present, and Barabas said from 70 to 80 percent
voted for the Steering Committee list.
   The congress opened Friday and ended early Tuesday with the more
than 1,200 delegates approving the following resolutions _ all
watered-down versions of what radical reformers wanted:
   _Start of discussions in Parliament about the fate of
party-controlled assets accrued illegally during its predecessor's
41 years in power.
   _Informal support of the largely volunteer Workers' Militia, now
facing dissolution, if it decides to give up its paramilitary
character and become an emergency aid organization during fires,
floods and other catastrophes.
   _Declaration of Oct. 23, start of the 1956 anti-Stalinist
uprising, as a Day of National Reconciliation.
   On Saturday, the congress laid the Socialist Workers (Communist)
Party to rest and founded the Hungarian Socialist Party in a vote
without parallel in the Soviet bloc. That opens the way for
Hungary's first free national elections in 41 years.
   Founding documents described the new party as having
Euro-Communist and democratic Socialist leanings, committed to a
free market economy and a parliamentary democracy.
   But in an attempt to compromise, the congress rejected radical
reformers' demands that die-hard Marxists be expressly shut out. It
instead stipulated that all accepting the new party's orientation
in writing could become members.
   The new party's formation was the latest bold reform in Hungary,
whose democratic strivings have placed it, along with Poland, in
the vanguard of change in the Soviet bloc.
   In the show-of-hands vote, delegates overwhelmingly approved
strivings for ``a constitutional state based on a multiparty
system, where the source of power is the will of the people
expressed in free elections.''
   The party was described as ``an organization in the Marxist
spirit ... totally committed to democracy.''
   Despite this, reformist delegates have expressed worry that the
new party did not differ enough from its predecessor, and the
choice of Nyers was expected to heighten anxieties among some
wanting a clean break with the past.
   Serious ideological rifts emerged among the three leading
candidates in the collective leadership prior to the secret vote.
   But Nemeth, said earlier to be siding with Pozsgay against
Nyers, told reporters as he went into the congress hall for the
vote that ``the danger of a split has been averted.''
   Pozsgay also emphasized the will to compromise in an interview
after the vote for Nyers. ``Everybody agrees on the basics, and one
thing I can tell you is that the reformers are in the majority,''
he said.
   Nyers repeated after the election that there would be no purge.
   The congress on Sunday voted to continue party politics at
factories and work shops.
   The conservative Marxist Unity Platform issued a statement
Monday saying the old party remained functional and urging true
communists not to join the new one.

<HEAD>German Parts Could Be Used in Libyan Missiles, Prosecutor Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MUNICH, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The West German company Globe-Sat
has been fined for selling valve control parts to Libya that could
be used to build missiles, Munich chief state prosecutor Heinz
Stocker said Monday.
   He said the Munich-based firm appealed the fine, which followed
a ruling this year that the shipments violated West German export
laws.
   Stocker called the fine ``large'' but declined to give a figure.
No date has been set for the appeal hearing, he said.
   Stocker was asked about a report in the British weekly Sunday
Correspondent. It said about 100 West German engineers are helping
Libya build a missile capable of carrying chemical warheads and
with a range of 300 to 450 miles in a camp about 60 miles from the
Saharan oasis of Sabha.
   Stocker told The Associated Press the possibility of illegal
German involvement has been under investigation since last spring.
He would not elaborate.
   The Sunday Correspondent said radical Libyan leader Moammar
Gadhafi ultimately wants to develop a missile with a 1,000-mile
range that would allow him to threaten Israel.
   Involvement of West German firms in a Libyan chemical plant
embarrassed the government of Chancellor Helmut Kohl this year when
charges surfaced in the United States that the plant was meant to
produce chemical arms.
   Libya claims the Rabta plant, 60 miles south of Tripoli, is
intended to make pharmaceutical products.

   A federal jury Monday convicted a man on
19 counts for the planting of 13 bombs in nearby Salem, a plot
prosecutors said was rooted in his lifelong rivalry with a state
legislator.
   The U.S. District Court jury deliberated just over three hours
before returning the guilty verdicts against John M. Hubbard III.
   Hubbard's attorney, Paul J. Watts, unexpectedly rested his case
Monday afternoon without calling witnesses.
   Hubbard, 32, of Salem, was charged with 29 counts including
conspiracy, illegal possession of dynamite, 14 counts of making
bombs and 13 counts of attempting to destroy bridges and buildings
used in interstate commerce. No bombs actually exploded.
   Hubbard began to weep before the jury returned to the courtroom
and his family members cried as the verdicts were announced.
   ``We love you and still believe in you,'' Hubbard's mother, Opal
Kramer, told her son as he was led out of the courtroom.
   Hubbard turned to her and said, ``Let the world know.''
   On his way out of the courthouse, Hubbard told reporters, ``I
know I'm innocent; God knows I'm innocent.''
   Watts said he was not certain whether the case will be appealed.
No sentencing date was set. Hubbard has been in custody since his
arrest in May.
   Jerry Conrad, 42, one of Hubbard's co-workers at a Salem
factory, was convicted on all 29 counts following a trial last
month. Salem in in south-central Indiana, about 30 miles northwest
of Louisville.
   In closing arguments Monday, Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert
Stanley Powell described Hubbard as a ``guerrilla fighter in his
own mind.''
   ``He wanted the thrill of being able to see the fear and the
panic on people's faces about the bombs and the chaos he had
created in Salem,'' said Powell.
   Powell said Hubbard was motivated by his lifelong rivalry and
hatred for state Rep. Frank Newkirk Jr, a Democrat from Salem. ``He
resented him for a lifetime of accomplishments that he thought
Frank Newkirk Jr. had that Mr. Hubbard didn't,'' Powell said.
   But Watts contended it was absurd to suggest Hubbard would plant
a bomb within 150 feet of his own house and then return home to his
wife and children to ``wait to be blown off the face of the earth
because he didn't get a part in a school play in high school.''
   Watts said the government's case was based entirely on
circumstantial evidence, much of it provided by ``purchased
testimony.''
   Government witnesses included a paid informant, who was a
convicted felon, and an inmate who met Hubbard when both were at
the Marion County Jail.
   Watts told jurors Hubbard had continued to deny involvement in
the bomb case. He characterized any boastful statements Hubbard
made as ``the meanderings of a drunk. That's pretty clear.''
   The defense attorney described Hubbard as a ``gun nut who loads
his own ammunition, who has weird politics. We know he exaggerates;
we know that when he's drunk, he lies,'' Watts said.

   The Pentagon eventually will replace the
military editors of the armed services newspaper Stars and Stripes
with civilians, a Defense Department spokesman said Monday.
   The development follows a recommendation made last year in a
study by General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of
Congress that said it found evidence of censorship and improper
management at the government-run daily.
   ``When the current military editors retire, it is our intention
to put civilians in there,'' Defense Department spokesman Pete
Williams said in an interview.
   Williams, who said he couldn't give a specific time for the
change, said the Pentagon also was ``looking into'' the possible
financial and editorial consolidation of the newspaper's two
editions.
   A Pentagon source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
switch was expected to occur within several years.
   Both the European and Pacific editions of Stars and Stripes,
originally designed to serve as a hometown paper for U.S. forces
overseas, have been plagued in recent years by allegations of
censorship and employee harassment.
   A Pentagon-appointed ombudsman has been in the Pacific for two
weeks looking into the allegations. Philip M. Foisie, formerly of
The Washington Post, was named to the new ombudsman position last
summer.
   The GAO, assisted by the Society of Professional Journalists,
reported last year that it found evidence of censorship and
improper management. The agency also said the editor-in-chief
should be a civilian with solid journalism credentials.
   The House Armed Services Committee, in the defense authorization
bill report for fiscal 1990, agreed that the editor should have
solid journalistic credentials but stopped short of calling for a
civilian.
   The GAO investigation was launched last year at the request of
then-Sen. William Proxmire, D-Wis.
   ``The good news is for the thousands of military personnel and
their dependents overseas, because the credibility of one of their
primary sources of news will be greatly enhanced,'' said Paul
McMasters, national freedom of information chairman for the Society
of Professional Journalists and deputy editorial director for USA
Today.
   ``They were trying to serve two masters and it was an impossible
duty,'' McMasters said about the military editors.
   Williams said a national accounting firm is, at the request of
the GAO and Congress, studying whether the financial consolidation
would be beneficial.
   ``We want to do what is best for the paper. ... We take any
allegations of censorship very seriously,'' said Williams, the
assistant secretary of defense for public affairs.
   Defense Department regulations prohibit censorship ``unless the
military chain of command determines that the information would
affect military security or the health and welfare of the troops,''
Williams said.
   ``Censorship is not allowed just because some news is
embarrassing. The rules are very clear.''
   The allegations of censorship and harassment of employees who
complained to Congress have caught the attention of several
lawmakers, including Rep. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., who last month
called the problem an ``intolerable situation.''
   Although frequently referred to as one newspaper, the Stars and
Stripes is published in separate editions by largely autonomous
bureaus in West Germany and Japan.
   The papers are staffed by military as well as civilian
journalists, but both papers are led by an officer who holds the
title commander and editor-in-chief. Those officers report to the
heads of the European and Pacific Commands.

   George Strait was voted entertainer of
the year and Ricky Van Shelton and Kathy Mattea won top vocalist
honors Monday night at the 23rd annual Country Music Association
awards show.
   Strait won the top honor at the Grand Ole Opry House, breaking a
two-year hold on the award by Hank Williams Jr.
   ``I'm so excited. I've wanted this for so long,'' Strait said.
``I truly believe audiences go away entertained.''
   Strait, a former Texas trail boss, is known for hits such as
``All My Ex's Live in Texas'' and ``Does Fort Worth Ever Cross Your
Mind.'' His selection as entertainer of the year left country star
Randy Travis without an award for the third year Travis was
nominated.
   Shelton, a former pipefitter, was chosen top male vocalist for
his recent hit records ``From a Jack to a King'' and ``Hole in My
Pocket.''
   ``I thank God he gave me a voice instead of big feet,'' Shelton
said.
   Mattea, a former tour guide at the Country Music Hall of Fame,
won top female vocalist on the heels of her No. 1 record, ``Come
From the Heart.''
   ``I've always liked to do this, because I liked the doing of
it,'' she said as her voice choked with emotion.
   Williams, son of a country music legend, was the night's only
double winner. He won best video for ``There's a Tear in My Beer''
and vocal event of the year for integrating his voice with his
father's on the same song. The vocal event of the year is presented
to two performers who do not normally sing together.
   The late Keith Whitley, 33, who died of an accidental alcohol
overdose in May, won single of the year for his hit ``I'm No
Stranger to the Rain.'' His award was accepted by his widow, singer
Lorrie Morgan.
   ``Five months ago on this date, I lost the world's greatest
husband, and country music, in my eyes, lost the world's greatest
singer,'' she said.
   The mother-daughter team the Judds won duo of the year, making
it the fifth consecutive year they won either duo of the year or
group of the year.
   ``I think as time goes by, we appreciate it more every day,''
daughter Wynonna Judd. ``Music isn't just a living, it's our life.''
   Singer Hank Thompson and music publishers Jack Stapp and Cliffie
Stone were chosen for the Country Music Hall of Fame.
   Other winners included: the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band's ``Will the
Circle Be Unbroken Vol. II'' for top album; Highway 101 for group
of the year for the second year in a row; fiddler Johnny Gimble for
musician of the year; ``Chiseled in Stone'' by Max D. Barnes and
Vern Gosdin for song of the year, a songwriters' award; and Clint
Black for the Horizon award, given for career advancement to an
artist who has never won a CMA award.
   Singers Anne Murray and Kenny Rogers were hosts of the
nationally televised two-hour show on CBS.

   The first entertainer of the year was Eddy Arnold in 1967.
   Winners were chosen by the 5,469 voting members of the CMA,
mostly singers, musicians, songwriters, record company employees
and disc jockeys. The Hall of Fame honorees were selected by an
anonmyous panel.

and chasing them into side streets.
   Witnesses reported many injuries and arrests.

   A day after casting off Communist
doctrine and embracing democracy with a new platform and name
change, the ruling Socialist Party's leadership voted
overwhelmingly to keep a presence in the workplace.
   The vote Sunday during a historic party congress angered
reformers who seek to draw a clear line between the old
Marxist-Leninist party and its successor, which professes to aspire
to multiparty democracy.
   On Saturday, delegates voted to disband the ruling Communist
Party, an event unprecedented in the Warsaw Pact.
   Of the approximately 1,200 delegates present for Sunday's
balloting just 107 _ including Premier Miklos Nemeth and Foreign
Minister Gyula Horn _ voted against the workplace measure, with 34
abstentions.

   The Bush administration was preparing for
covert action to grab Panamanian leader Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega
near the end of an uprising last week but dropped the plans as the
coup fizzled, top officials say.
   The officials, in televised interviews Sunday, fended off
congressional criticism that they acted in confusion and hesitation
last Tuesday during the coup attempt.
   The Panama Defense Forces rebels refused a U.S. request to
surrender Noriega to face drug charges in the United States, and
President Bush ordered the military to plan on using covert force
to grab the Panamanian strongman, said Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney, Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Brent Scowcroft,
the White House national security adviser.
   ``The message that was sent was that if there were an
opportunity to do this, without risking bloodshed and significant
loss of American life, and to do so without open military
involvement, then he was free to go ahead, the commander on the
ground was free to go ahead,'' Baker said on the NBC-TV program,
``Meet the Press.''

   A Senate stalemate that centers on President
Bush's capital gains cut is taking on a new wrinkle as liberal
Democrats seek to ensure expansion of tax credits for low-income
working parents.
   Leaders face an Oct. 16 deadline as they try to negotiate their
way out of the hangup. Unless Congress completes work by then on a
deficit-reduction plan of spending cuts and tax increases,
automatic across-the-board reductions will be triggered in most
federal spending programs.
   Senate Democratic and Republican leaders spent all of Saturday
and half of Sunday looking for a solution. They agreed only to
resume their efforts Tuesday.
   ``We don't have an agreement yet but everybody in there today
thought we should get one,'' Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of
Kansas told reporters.

   Cocaine prices went up in parts of the United
States as Colombia cracked down on drug traffickers, but it's too
soon to predict whether recent U.S. seizures will force the cost up
even further, law enforcement officials say.
   Miami has shown the greatest price increase, going from $9,000
to $10,000 for a kilo of cocaine before the crackdown to $20,000
today, according to Metro-Dade Police Detective George Reyes.
   Along the Mexican border in southern Texas, the price of a kilo
recently jumped to $14,000 to $15,000 after remaining steady for
about a year at $11,000 to $12,000, said Armando Ramirez, the Drug
Enforcement Administration's resident agent in charge of the
Brownsville office.
   In Los Angeles, Sgt. Tim Beard of the County Sheriff's Office
says cocaine prices range from $10,000 a kilo, for someone buying
10 kilos or more, to $15,000 for a novice buyer. At the same time,
Steve Georges of the DEA in Los Angeles says the per-kilo price is
$14,000 to $15,000, an increase of $1,000 to $2,000 from a year ago.

   Many college students don't know when the
Civil War occurred or what the Magna Carta was, according to a
Gallup Poll being cited in a call for colleges and universities to
revise curricula.
   Too many students are graduating from college without knowing
``basic landmarks of history and thought,'' Lynne V. Cheney,
chairwoman of the National Endowment for the Humanities, said in
releasing the poll Sunday.
   Part of the problem is that upon entering college, students
``often find few requirements in place and a plethora of
offerings,'' she said.
   Cheney issued a new report that offers colleges and universities
a study plan of 50 hours in five basic areas of knowledge,
including foreign language, mathematics, science and civilization.

   The Communist Party has changed its
name and embraced democratic aspirations, but its members on Monday
retained the head of the old party in a compromise vote.
   Delegates to the closed session said Rezsoe Nyers was chosen as
head of the Hungarian Socialist Party's collective presidency after
dissatisfied reformers reluctantly agreed to support him.
   Hours before beginning the closed session, the party congress
adopted a manifesto pledging commitment to democracy and a break
with the Marxist-Leninist orientation of its Communist predecessor.
   Despite the stated commitment to democracy, reformist delegates
have expressed concern that the new party does not differ
sufficiently from its predecessor. The choice of Nyers to continue
as leader was expected to increase the anxiety of some who wanted a

   Two University of California cancer
researchers won the Nobel Prize in medicine Monday and immediately
reaped the perquisites of success: box seats at the National League
baseball playoffs.
   ``We're off to the game _ just got tickets,'' a jubilant J.
Michael Bishop said shortly after he and Harold E. Varmus learned
that they had won this year's prize.
   The 50-member Nobel Assembly of the Karolinska Institute,
Sweden's largest and oldest medical university, cited Bishop and
Varmus for their discovery that cancer genes in certain viruses are
altered forms of normal animal genes.
   The research helped scientists understand how cancer begins, and
it ``widened our insight into the complicated signal systems which
govern the normal growth of cells,'' the assembly said.

   The operator of the Rocky Flats nuclear arms
plant knew as early as 1984 that dangerous amounts of radioactive
plutonium may have accumulated in building air ducts but failed to
act on the information, a former employee said Monday.
   James Stone, a utility design engineer at the site from 1980 to
1986, said he raised the probability of such plutonium deposits _
and the safety hazard they would pose _ with Rockwell International
Corp., which operates the plant near Denver under an Energy
Department contract.
   ``They said we cannot afford to clean it,'' Stone said in a
telephone interview.
   Stone's suspicion of a buildup of plutonium residue in the
ventilation system at Rocky Flats was borne out by a team of
independent investigators who disclosed in a report to the Energy
Department last week that such plutonium deposits raised ``a real
possibility'' of an accidental nuclear chain reaction at Rocky
Flats.

   Metromedia Co. Chairman John Werner Kluge is
worth an estimated $5.2 billion, but he had to back into first
place on Forbes magazine's annual list of the 400 richest Americans.
   Kluge displaced Sam Walton, head of the Wal-Mart stores discount
chain, who divided his $9 billion fortune among himself and his
four children and ended a four-year reign as Forbes's wealthiest
person.
   Among other notables on the list released Monday, developer
Donald Trump compounded his already considerable fortune and
financiers Michael Milken and Carl Icahn joined the billionaires
club.
   Overall, Forbes' richest are worth an estimated total of about
$269 billion, up nearly $50 billion from the previous year, a 22
percent increase that substantially outpaced last year's 4.4
percent inflation rate.

   Some might think a television show about
home renovation would be as exciting as watching paint dry. But
PBS' ``This Old House'' has long since proved that Americans love
to watch other people fix up fixer-uppers.
   Now ``This Old House'' has this new host: Steve Thomas, an
eclectic blend of Thor Heyerdahl, Ralph Waldo Emerson and Robert
Redford.
   PBS officials hope that Thomas, 36, an expert sailor, carpenter,
world traveler and writer, will dispel the whiff of scandal that
hovered over the show when its original host, Bob Vila, left over a
conflict of interest.
   The popular Vila began as co-host of the show with master
carpenter Norm Abram 11 years ago. He left after last season when
an underwriter withdrew funding in a dispute over Vila's commercial
endorsements.

<TEXT>
   It's been three years, two No. 1 hits and 3
million albums since Simply Red entered the American pop music
scene, but lead singer Mick ``Red'' Hucknall says the audience here
still doesn't fully grasp the music of his group.
   The band that fills sports arenas elsewhere in the world plays
the smallish Palladium in Los Angeles and the moderate Warfield
Theater in San Francisco. Hucknall blames narrow-minded radio
programming.
   ``Radio stations everywhere else in the world are very eclectic
in their musical choice and taste,'' said the 29-year-old
red-haired singer and songwriter. ``They play a whole mash of
different types of music. In America, our music doesn't suit their
programming.
   ``I stil maintain that the public doesn't get a hold on it.
We're perceived as a slow-ballad band.''
   Simply Red's American hits, ``If You Don't Know Me by Now,'' and
``Holding Back the Years,'' are showcases for Hucknall's stunning,
soulful vocals. But they tell only half the story.
   The music of the six-man ensemble bears little resemblance to
most contemporary music. Simply Red tackles everything from jazz to
soul to pop to reggae and does it extremely well. And Hucknall's
voice has been compared to everyone from Phoebe Snow to Neil Young
to David Ruffin. The band _ a collection of musicians with
backgrounds ranging from pub performer to church organist _ prides
itself on working under its own set of rules, far removed from the
middle of the road.
   It's repertoire is filled with funked-up dance songs, some with
a left-wing political twist. But Hucknall, who still lives in
blue-collar Manchester, England, where he grew up, finds pop music
and politics a natural combination.
   ``I'm not stupid, and the whole world is full of things that are
important,'' Hucknall said in a telephone interview from Los
Angeles, a few weeks before the band was to play two sold-out shows
in San Francisco. ``I'm trying to reach out to people who don't
believe everything they read. The world doesn't revolve around the
United States or Britain.
   ``If I do write about love, I write the way I feel about it
rather than how the rest of the world and public convention would
have me feel.''
   But Hucknall, whose first gig was singing at a wedding when he
was 6, is more famous for his vocal range than his political views.
Critics have a field day speculating on his soul influences _ Sam
Cooke and James Brown are two of the favorite guesses _ but he
traces his style to the band Burning Spear and singer Lee Parry.
   The anti-Thatcherism, he said, comes from four lean years in
Manchester spent scraping by as a deejay. Hucknall said he decided
his poverty was due partly to his career choice and partly to
government policies.
   The road to success wasn't easy for Hucknall, who started
assembling the band in 1984. Hucknall, who lent his wide-ranging
vocal talents to a punk band called the Frantic Elevators for three
years until 1981, was forced to fire some friends as he put
together Simply Red.
   Simply Red, as Hucknall points out, is not simply ``Red.''
Drummer Chris Joyce and bassist Tony Bowers joined on from the band
Durutti Column; guitarist Sylvan Richardson was a local jazz player
from the Manchester pubs; keyboardist Fritz McIntyre learned his
trade in his father's church; and trumpeter Tim Kellett was
clasically trained at a British music academy.
   The band is currently in the midst of a world tour that has
taken them to five continents over six months to promote the new
album, ``A New Flame.''
   Weary of life on the road, Hucknall plans to return to
Manchester soon and enjoy a home he bought last year.
   ``I'm taking a year out to do nothing,'' he said. ``I enjoyed it
for awhile, but four years is beginning to be a bit of a drag.''

<HEAD>Japanese Ministry Puts Brakes on Borrowing Words from English</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY THORSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Among the world's languages, Japanese is one of the
most eager borrowers of foreign words. But one arm of the
bureaucracy is putting on the brakes. Very gently.
   Please, not ``konseputo'' _ how the Japanese pronounce
``concept.'' Use ``kihonteki kangaekata'' (basic idea) instead.
   And no more ``masuta puran'' (master plan), says the Ministry of
Health and Welfare. Let's say ``kihon keikaku'' (basic plan) and
more Japanese people will understand.
   But the ministry's list of English words to be avoided in
official documents is accompanied by a list of acceptable ones.
   It wouldn't do in France, where the Commissariat General de la
Langue Francaise battles against the ``Franglais'' that results
from unapproved cohabitation with English.
   If the commissariat ordered ``un bulldozer'' to be pushed aside
for ``bouteur,'' the French certainly would never agree with the
Japanese ministry's acceptance of ``homu herupa'' for ``home
helper'' _ people who help the elderly at home. The Japanese, by
the way, would translate the French word ``bouteur'' as
``burudoza.''
   The Ministry of Health and Welfare issued guidelines on foreign
words this past summer because Junichiro Koizumi, the minister at
the time, felt that many ordinary people would not understand some
of the foreign words used in the ministry's jargon, said Masato
Shibata, a senior planning officer.
   The ministry wants to help people, but ``if they don't
understand what we're saying, then they don't get help,'' Shibata
said.
   Borrowed words are written in the katakana script, one of three
scripts in the complex Japanese writing system. Used like italics,
katakana is an angular script in which each symbol is a syllable. A
rounded-looking script called hiragana also uses a symbol for each
syllable.
   Though every Japanese word could be written in those two
scripts, there is also kanji, or Chinese-style characters. One must
know 2,000 or so kanji to be able to read a Japanese newspaper,
while the katakana and hiragana scripts have about 50 symbols each.
   In contrast to its wildly rich writing system, spoken Japanese
has fewer sounds than English and European languages _ no L, no TH,
no V, a weak F, a low number of consonant combinations. So foreign
words often are barely recognizable when adopted into Japanese.
``Needs,'' for instance, is one of the words rejected by the
Ministry of Health. It is written in katakana as either ``needo''
or ``neezu.'' Suggested alternatives are juyo (demand) and yobo
(request).
   But Japanese people have been borrowing foreign words for
centuries, and many are in common use.
   Shirt is ``waishatsu'' _ actually from ``white shirt'' _ and it
will be found on the laundry list next to the ``terebi'' (TV) on
the ``teiburu'' (table) at your ``hoteru'' (hotel).
   Not all borrowed words retain their original shape or meaning.
   ``Handoru'' comes from ``handle'' but means steering wheel.
   ``Rihabiri'' is a shortened ``rehabilitation.''
   Japanese people think of such imports as katakana words because
that is the way they're written, said Tatsuo Miyajima, a department
head at the National Language Research Institute in the Ministry of
Education.
   ``Bureaucrats are fond of katakana words, but not so much as
people in advertising, sports and high-technology areas. When they
speak Japanese, they use English words. They know the Japanese
words, but it's easier to use English words.''
   Miyajima added that many people think foreign words are used too
much, but the proliferation continues, especially from American
English.
   He said his institute refrains from taking a position for or
against borrowed words.
   English is another great borrower of foreign words, he noted,
``and that makes the language more powerful, so why shouldn't we
have foreign words.''

<TEXT>
   The bowler hat, enduring symbol of the Englishman,
is catching the fancy of Americans.
   Although it has been disappearing from London's financial
district where it once was common, exports of bowlers are growing,
particularly to the United States, experts say.
   ``There's been a marked increase in the number being sold to
Americans,'' said Richard Stephenson, managing director of the
Picadilly hatters James Lock and Co.
   There is also demand from France, where gray bowlers are worn to
the horse races, and from Australia and Africa.
   Overall sales are 25 percent higher than in the mid-1980s, with
most of the growth coming from foreign sales, Stephenson said.
   ``We are selling more,'' said Derek Bedford, managing director
of Christy and Co., Britain's biggest hat maker.
   In Britain today, however, bowler-wearers are viewed by some as
mildly eccentric.
   David Green, an 89-year-old insurance underwriter, explained why
he has worn one for 65 years.
   ``They are smart. It used to be when people dressed smartly the
proper thing to wear was a bowler. I've just kept on with it.''
   Bowlers also are good to grow geraniums in, he said.
   Bedford attributes the recent upturn to increased demand for
bowlers as riding hats and as women's fashion head wear.
   ``We have seen some sort of designer ranges in very strong
colors with holes cut in them and bells sewed on them,'' Bedford
said. ``You do see some very odd derivatives.''
   Bowlers cost $113 to $139 each, and Americans are not buying
them as a gimmick or for souvenirs, Stephenson said.
   ``The vast majority are buying this with every intention of
wearing it.'' But Bedford said, ``We are really finding in the home
market things quieter than we would like.''
   Made of rabbit fur hardened with shellac, bowlers still are
handcrafted through 47 steps over the course of eight weeks,
Bedford said.
   The hats date back to 1850, when William Coke, a Norfolk farmer,
asked James Lock to make a hard hat that would protect his
gamekeepers from overhead branches while they rode their horses.
   Lock designed a close-fitting domed hat and had it made by
London hatters Thomas and William Bowler.
   According to bowler lore, Coke tried out the hat by jumping on
it.
   James Lock has sold the hard hats ever since, calling them Cokes
after the first customer. But the Bowler brothers also branched out
on their own, and their name stuck.
   In the United States, the hat became known as a derby because it
was worn to the Kentucky Derby horse race.
   In 1880s Britain, it became fashionable to wear a bowler in
town, and it was popular among lawyers, brokers, and bankers.
   ``It's particularly associated with London: the pinstriped suit,
the rolled umbrella and the bowler hat,'' Stephenson said.
   But they also were worn by off-duty army officers and by the
foremen of shipyards and mills in northern England.
   They still are part of the uniform worn on parade by the Orange
Order of Northern Ireland Protestants.
   The Duke of Windsor sometimes wore a bowler, as did Charlie
Chaplin. Winston Churchill wore a square-crowned variation.
   During the 1920s and 1930s, up to a million bowlers were
produced annually in factories around Stockport and Manchester, in
northwest England.
   The bowler went into decline after World War II. The spread of
cars meant people didn't need hats as much to keep warm, and dress
became less formal.
   After the war, Christy bought the failing Stockport factories,
which altogether employed 3,500 people. Christy currently has 350
employees making all kinds of hats, including some 50,000 bowlers a
year.

<TEXT>
   When Alexander the Great founded his capital
on Egypt's Mediterranean coast, he intended it to dominate the
world. It did, but not through military force as he imagined.
   Alexandria dominated through knowledge and culture, and at the
heart of its glory was the greatest library in the history of the
world.
   The Library of Alexandria lasted for hundreds of years after the
conqueror's death in Babylon at age 33 but it disappeared with few
traces early in the Christian era.
   Now, almost 2,000 years later, Egypt is embarking on a project
to restore Alexandria's cultural prominence by creating a new
library as a symbol of where Egypt's been and where it's going.
   ``We want others to see Egypt from the right point of view, as a
country of civilization,'' said Ahmed Fathy Sorour, Egypt's
minister of education, who is heading the project.
   ``We are much more than keepers of the pyramids. We are reviving
the concept of the Alexandria Library ... in order to prove to the
world that Egypt's civilization didn't go away but is a living
tradition.''
   The site is ready and the design chosen for the projected $180
million-complex that officials say will bring new life to an old
but honored city.
   The site is prime Mediterranean seafront, backed by the bustle
of Alexandria's 4 million people. On the horizon is the
10th-century fortress of Qait Bey, built where one of the Seven
Wonders of the Ancient World, the Pharos Lighthouse, purportedly
stood.
   The design by the Norwegian architectural firm Snoehetta is for
the new Alexandria Library to be a sweeping circle of concrete,
steel, glass and stone _a symbol of the sun.
   If an international fund-raising drive now under way succeeds
and the project meets its schedule, the library complex will be
completed by 1995.
   Recapturing ancient glory won't be easy, for few cities have a
more impressive early history than Alexandria's.
   Founded in 331 B.C., it beckoned the greats of its time, who in
turn gave the world a harvest of their best thoughts and
inventions: the pipe organ, the Archimedes screw, the atlas and
12-month, 365-day year, grammar and geography, geometry and
trigonometry, steam and fire engines, coin-operated machines, city
planning, and cataloging.
   From Alexandria came news that the Earth revolved around the
sun. Alexandrian scholars calculated the circumference of the Earth
to within 50 miles and the length of the solar year to within six
minutes.
   Poetry and prose abounded. They emptied from the
Athens-Alexandria axis into ports around the world, Greek becoming
Roman becoming Western heritage.
   Alexandrian culture revolved around an academic complex called
the Moseion, a think tank for Mediterranean intellectuals with the
freedom and the means to create at will. At the heart of the
Moseion was the library.
   Both were thriving by 285 B.C., a half-century before
establishment of a second, even greater Alexandria Library known to
scholars as the daughter library. It eventually contained an
estimated 500,000 volumes, a trove so vast 120 parchment scrolls
were required to catalog it.
   The collection included the 200,000 volumes of the Pergamum
Library, carted away from what is now Turkey by love-smitten Mark
Antony as a gift for Cleopatra.
   Debate continues over the fate of the ancient Alexandria
libraries. Some historians contend they were destroyed during
Jewish revolts of A.D. 115-117. Others say Christians who rioted
against pagan ways in A.D. 391 destroyed them.
   There appears little evidence the institutions survived long
enough to be destroyed by Arab invaders hundreds of years later, as
many early Western scholars wrote.
   Whatever happened, the libraries and records about them were so
thoroughly demolished that nobody knows for certain what they
looked like or even where they stood.
   The idea to revive the Alexandria Library was born in 1974.
University of Alexandria officials saw it as a way to perpetuate a
literary and cultural heritage long associated with their city,
still an educational headquarters for more than 80,000 students.
   They decided the first step would be a new library, but by the
time Hosni Mubarak, Egypt's president, laid the cornerstone June
26, 1988, the library had become an academic and social center. It
was to include a conference center, a planetarium, a scientists'
Hall of Fame, a calligraphy museum and other facilities.
   ``It's unfair for others to look on Egypt only as a developing
country struggling toward its economic development,'' Education
Minister Sorour said. ``The West owes much to other cultures,
including Egypt and later the Arabs.''

<BYLINE>Feminist Groups Launch Brazil's First Pro-Choice Campaign ^By KEN
SILVERSTEIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Feminist groups in traditionally
Roman Catholic Brazil have launched the country's first pro-choice
abortion campaign.
   Though abortion is illegal, except when the mother's life is
endangered due to preganancy or in cases of rape, independent
researchers say 3 million to 5 million clandestine abortions take
place a year.
   That would make Brazil the world's leader, accounting for 4
percent to 7 percent of the World Health Organization's estimate of
roughly 65 million abortions that take place each year.
   Ivany Buzzo, director of the Feminist Health Collective, based
in Sao Paulo, said Brazilian women have been discussing abortion
for more than 10 years but never lobbied for legalization.
   ``Abortion is an extremely delicate issue in Brazil,
particularly with the church's influence,'' said Ms. Buzzo, a
leader of the pro-choice drive.
   About 85 percent of Brazil's 145 million people are listed as
Roman Catholics.
   The pro-choice campaign was officially launched at the 10th
National Feminist Meeting in mid-September.
   The coalition is planning street rallies, a media campaign and
public debates and will lobby Congress in support of a bill
introduced in early September by Rep. Jose Genoino of the
pro-Marxist Workers Party, calling for the legalization of abortion
during the first three months of pregnancy.
   ``Abortion is a human rights and class question,'' Ms. Buzzo
said. ``Everyone knows where the clandestine abortion clinics are,
including the government, so for upper- and middle-class women it's
essentially legal.''
   The average cost of an illegal abortion runs from $200 to $850.
But even $200 is far beyond the means of the majority of women.
   ``It's pure hypocrisy,'' Genoino said. ``Brazil is the world
champion in abortions. But the law forces poor women to risk their
life if they want to terminate their pregnancies.''
   Carmen Barroso, a sociologist with Sao Paulo's Carlos Chagas
Research Foundation, estimated that about 10,000 women die each
year after using crude methods for self-induced abortions, such as
knitting needles.
   His research also indicates that about 200,000 women a year are
admitted to public hospitals due to medical problems stemming from
self-induced abortions.
   Feminist groups also complain that in the case of rape, legal
requirements are so stringent that few Brazilian women are able to
get abortions on those grounds.
   Rape victims need reports from the police and the government's
Legal Medical Institute confirming a rape occurred. A judge then
must authorize the abortion.
   ``By the time all the requirements are met, the child is already
in school,'' Ms. Buzzo said.
   In addition, the Legal Medical Institute won't classify an
attack as rape unless the victim has physical injuries and if sperm
is found in the vagina. If a woman did not ``resist,'' Brazilian
law does not consider rape to have taken place.
   Only 20 percent of the women who go to the institute claiming
they were raped are able to have the crime classified as such, Ms.
Buzzo claimed.
   She said few judges will authorize an abortion even if all
requirements are met because of personal opposition or fear of
negative publicity.
   In 1987, Rio de Janeiro became the first city to pass specific
legislation implementing the legal-abortion law and two public
hospitals were designated to perform abortions on rape victims. The
need for a judge's authorization was dropped.
   But figures from the Rio de Janeiro State Health Department
showed only two women had legal abortions nearly two years after
the law went into effect.
   ``Few women have the courage to admit they were raped,'' said
Dr. Sara Sorreltino, also a member of the Feminist Health
Collective. ``They don't know about the law, or they are unable to
prove the attack took place.''
   Pro-choice supporters don't believe legalization of abortion
will take place any time soon. Genoino estimated that only 50 of
Brazil's 570 congressmen will support his bill.
   But Ms. Buzzo contended, ``A democratic society must grant women
the right to bear a child or not. It's going to be a struggle, but
ultimately we'll win.''

   Today's Highlight in History:
   Twenty-five years ago, on Oct. 15, 1964, it was announced that
Soviet leader Nikita S. Khrushchev had been removed from office. He
was succeeded as premier by Alexei N. Kosygin and as Communist
Party secretary by Leonid I. Brezhnev.
   On this date:
   In 1860, eleven-year-old Grace Bedell of Westfield, N.Y., wrote
a letter to presidential candidate Abraham Lincoln, suggesting he
would look better if he grew a beard.
   In 1914, the Clayton Antitrust Act was passed.
   In 1917, Mata Hari, a Dutch dancer who had spied for the
Germans, was executed by a firing squad outside Paris.
   In 1928, the Graf Zeppelin, a German dirigible, landed in
Lakehurst, N.J., on its first commercial flight across the Atlantic.
   In 1937, the Ernest Hemingway novel, ``To Have and Have Not,''
was published.
   In 1939, New York Municipal Airport, later renamed LaGuardia
Airport, was dedicated.

executed.
   In 1946, Nazi war criminal Hermann Goering poisoned himself one
day before he was to be executed.
   In 1951, the television situation comedy ``I Love Lucy,''
starring Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz, premiered on CBS.
   In 1966, President Lyndon Johnson signed a bill creating the
Department of Transportation.
   In 1969, peace demonstrators staged activities across the
country, including a candlelight march around the White House, as
part of a campaign against the Vietnam War.
   In 1976, in the first debate of its kind, vice presidential
nominees Walter F. Mondale and Bob Dole faced off in Houston.
   Ten years ago: In El Salvador, the military government of Gen.
Carlos Humberto Romero was overthrown by lower-ranking army
officers, forcing Romero to leave the country with other top
officials.
   Five years ago: Three European researchers _ Niels K. Jerne,
Georges J.F. Koehler and Cesar Milstein _ were awarded the Nobel
Prize in medicine for their contributions to the field of
immunology.
   One year ago: The Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the Oakland A's,
5-4, in the World Series opener that featured a dramatic
game-winning home run by an injured Kirk Gibson.
   Today's Birthdays: Economist John Kenneth Galbraith is 81.
Author-historian Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. is 72. Author Mario Puzo
is 69. Chrysler chairman Lee Iacocca is 65. Actress Linda Lavin is
52. Actress-director Penny Marshall is 44. Musician Richard
Carpenter is 43. Tennis player Roscoe Tanner is 38. Singer Tito
Jackson is 36. Britain's Duchess of York (formerly Sarah Ferguson)
is 30.
   Thought for Today: ``We used to do things for posterity, now we
do things for ourselves and leave the bill to posterity.''

<HEAD>Jackson to Stay Visible on TV, in Democratic Campaigns</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This is an off year for Jesse Jackson so his
impact is limited _ he's an issue in one current and one coming
campaign, an indirect factor in a couple more, and national
Democratic rulemakers have just dealt with a problem he left them.
   Now he's announced plans to become a television talk show host
next fall, just when a lot of people think he may be campaigning
for mayor of the District of Columbia.
   Jackson isn't saying yes or no. ``I do not choose to pursue the
hypothetical,'' he said in announcing his television plans last
week. ``I am not running for any office and at this point have no
plans to do so.''
   Jackson said he wants to go on television with the weekly talk
show to break a pattern in which ``fewer and fewer people talk
about more and more and often know less and less.''
   Then, too, the national forum of a syndicated television program
would provide exposure and, in effect, an introduction to voters
the two-time Democratic presidential candidate wouldn't otherwise
reach. And that can only add to the Jackson factor in Democratic
politics.
   Jackson transplanted his Rainbow Coalition political
headquarters from Chicago to Washington this summer, saying he
wanted a base closer to Congress and the rest of the federal
government.
   He registered to vote in the District of Columbia on Aug. 3,
thus qualifying to run for mayor. But he said he would not run
against embattled Mayor Marion S. Barry Jr., his longtime ally in
the civil rights movement. Barry has said he will seek a fourth
term. There will be at least three other Democratic candidates.
   That confronts the charismatic black leader with the kind of
problem that doesn't apply at loftier political levels. His
statements and Barry's put things on hold pending further
maneuvering. But there has been no hold in the speculation, notably
after Democratic National Chairman Ronald H. Brown said he thinks
Jackson will run for mayor and will win. Brown, convention manager
for the Jackson presidential campaign in 1988, said his forecast
wasn't based on inside information or direct word from Jackson.
   Brown also said he doubted anything short of legal proceedings
would keep Barry from running again. Barry has been involved in a
federal investigation into alleged drug dealing by an associate and
former city employee. The mayor has denied any wrongdoing.
   When that puzzle unravels it could have a national impact.
Should Jackson become mayor, it could sideline him in what
otherwise would be an almost certain third campaign for the
Democratic presidential nomination in 1992.
   The Jackson factor also figures in other, more immediate
political competition, notably the contest for mayor of New York.
Republicans have tried to make an issue of Jackson's support for
David N. Dinkins, the black Democrat who won nomination over Mayor
Edward Koch. Despite apologies and peace gestures, Jackson's 1984
description of New York as ``hymietown'' still rankles among Jewish
voters, a vital bloc in a mayoral election there.
   Jackson's headquarters said he has no firm schedule for campaign
appearances in New York, but he is expected to go there for efforts
to register and turn out black voters in Dinkins' behalf.
   In Virginia, where Lt. Gov. L. Douglas Wilder seeks to become
the first black elected governor of any state, Jackson has stayed
out of the campaign. Wilder needs the support of moderate and
conservative Democrats to win. With those vital blocs, Jackson's
involvement would be counterproductive.
   In Cleveland, voters will be choosing between two black
candidates for mayor, and while Jackson's allies backed the man who
led the primary, the challenger is coming on strong after
unexpectedly beating three white candidates to win a spot on the
final ballot.
   At the Democratic National Committee's fall meeting, one
Jackson-sponsored change in the rules on apportionment of
presidential nominating was undone, with another to follow later.
The committee restored the status of its 303 members as uncommitted
delegates to future conventions. Later, with Brown's support, it
plans to revive a requirement that candidates in the 1992 primaries
and caucuses get at least 15 percent of the vote in order to win
committed delegates. Jackson advocates straight proportional
representation.

of her husband in the Afghan army and cost her a career and
ultimately her identity.
   Now she is forced to hide her face behind a veil in public _ in
accordance with the customs of the Islamic fundamentalism that
prevails at the refugee camp.
   In Kabul, the shell-shocked Afghan capital 400 miles away,
another woman, Sadiqqa, vows never to pay that price.
   ``I would rather die,'' the 19-year-old science student at Kabul
University said. ``Putting on a veil amounts to being imprisoned or
kept in a cage. Nothing could be worse.''
   President Najib of Afghanistan has been been playing on those
fears, frequently reminding Afghan women of the fundamentalism of
the Moslem guerrillas trying to overthrow his government.
   Much has happened to change the lives of Afghan women since
civil war broke out 11 years ago, said Esmatee Wardak, chairman of
the All Women's Council of Afghanistan in Kabul.
   ``When the men went to war, the women started working in
factories and offices, as painters and carpenters. In short, they
got their first taste of freedom. These are the women who would
have a difficult time under the fundamentalists,'' said Mrs.
Wardak, one of two women with Cabinet-rank in Najib's government.
   The women's rights movement took root in Afghanistan in 1919,
the year it declared its independence.
   When Sharifa was 3 years old in 1959, King Zahir Shah decreed
that women no longer had to wear the chadri, the tent-like pleated
garment with a mesh opening over the eyes.
   Encouraged by her family and particularly her father, Sharifa
said, she wore Western clothes, graduated from Kabul University and
went to work as an accountant in a government office.
   That changed with the war.
   When her husband was drafted into the Afghan army nearly four
years ago, Sharifa took their small son and daughter across the
mountains to western Pakistan, where they have lived in a two-room
mud hut furnished with ragged pillows on the floor and decorated
with pictures from magazines pasted on the walls. She said she
doesn't know if her husband is dead or alive.
   In Pakistan she and a few others like her were suddenly
surrounded and alienated by Afghan women with traditional ideas,
women with whom they had little contact back home.
   Envied or ostracized by the others, Sharifa and those like her
complain of the narrowness of their lives and of the hard times
imposed by the mullahs, the religious leaders who roam the camp
searching for wrongdoing.
   The slightest infringement is reported to the mullahs. And since
she is dependent on them for food and other necessities, her
children will suffer for her misdemeanors.
   Sharifa said she is obedient because of her 9-year-old son and
10-year-old daughter. Soon the daughter will be forced to wear a
veil in public.
   ``Right now, she's as free as she'll ever be in her life,''
Sharifa said. ``Soon she will lose that freedom and have to join
the other women.''
   But there is no way out until the war ends.
   ``Sometimes I wonder if I'll ever return home,'' she said. ``I
won't go back if the fundamentalists come to power. I will not stay
under this veil and be hounded by the mullahs. I want to be happy
again.''
   On the Kabul University campus, with Western rock music blaring
from a portable stereo, Sadiqqa and her friends discuss the plight
of women like Sharifa who are forced to abandon their ambitions and
modern lifestyles for what they call ``Gulbuddin's medieval
fortress.'' Gulbuddin Hekmatyar is a Moslem guerrilla leader.
   ``If you're married, you're a wife. Otherwise, you are just a
woman,'' said Sadiqqa, dressed in tight Western blue jeans, a blue
T-shirt with sequin appliques and her long black hair pulled back
in a ponytail.
   ``Islam isn't against women working, but Islam's interpretations
are always done by men. That's the problem.''
   Those fears were heightened last year when the guerrilla leaders
drafted a constitution stating women must be kept in purdah, the
practice of wearing the veiled costume.
   Although the constitution was later abandoned, many leaders in
the seven-party guerrilla alliance still say they would not want
women to vote in an election of a new Afghan government.
   But the war has made Afghan women on both sides of the border
more assertive and determined.
   ``I am a Moslem but I will never, ever again wear a chadri,''
said Mrs. Wardak, one of four women elected to the Parliament in
1964 when Afghan women were given the right to vote.
   ``Islamic law does not require it and now there are many women
like me who will fight anyone who tried to put us back under the
veil. We will defend our rights.''
   Mrs. Wardak was wearing a white suit with pink scarf tied around
her neck the day she was interviewed in her Kabul office.
   She said Afghan society has become much more dependent on women
during the decade-long struggle between the government and the
mujahedeen, or Islamic holy warriors. The war has left one-third of
the country's 15 million people dead, living in exile or in refugee
camps along the border.
   Moslem women in general have a long tradition of fighting for
their beliefs and their countries, dating back to the Prophet
Mohammad's wife, Aisha, who went to battle beside her husband on a
camel. Afghan women have a long history of being on the front
lines, including fighting the British during three wars in the 19th
century.
   Today is no exception, said Mrs. Wardak, who earned a master's
degree in education at Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill.
More than 8,000 women have enlisted in the armed forces, training
as pilots and paratroopers and fighting side-by-side with male
soldiers, she said.
   ``Men present themselves as intrepid and heroic, telling how
they have suffered by going to war,'' she said. ``Women have
suffered a lot since the revolution. They have lost husbands and
fathers, sons and brothers.''
   Women will be essential in rebuilding Afghanistan once the
conflict ends, Mrs. Wardak added.
   ``We are a backward country. How can a society improve without
the participation of women, especially at this stage of development
in the world? It's impossible.''

<HEAD>Heyerdahl, at 75, Exploring Ruins Predating Incas in Peru</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUG MELLGREN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>OSLO, Norway (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At age 75, Thor Heyerdahl is digging in a
remote area near the coast of Peru for treasures left by a
civilization be believes is older and more advanced than the
celebrated Incas of the Andes.
   More than 40 years earlier, Heyerdahl set sail from the same
Peruvian coast for Polynesia on the Kon-Tiki, the primitive wooden
raft that first carried him to fame.
   Heyerdahl is exploring a sprawling complex called the Tucume
pyramids, which he believes were built by ancient seafarers who
reached the new world on fragile rafts like Kon-Tiki about the time
of Christ or before.
   ``This is the greatest archeological find of the century. ...
It's the most exciting project of my life,'' a trim Heyerdahl said
in an interview while in Norway recently to celebrate his birthday
at his boyhood home in Larvik, a southern town of 38,000 people.
   Heyerdahl said he was introduced to the Tucume find by the
Peruvian archaeologist Walter Alva.
   Work on the 26-pyramid complex began last year, but ``an area of
this size is not studied in one man's lifetime,'' Heyerdahl said.
``It will take generations.''
   The find, he said, may cast doubt on current theories about the
settlers of ancient America.
   The pyramids were made of adobe, a material most often used in
those times in distant Mesopotamia, the region near what now is
Iraq, he said.
   He added that he is certain he will find a treasure of gold and
artifacts when he opens the ancient tombs.
   The complex in northwest Peru is linked to the sea by a 12-mile
system of canals big enough for rafts like Kon-Tiki to sail
through, he said. The canals once were filled in but later dredged
out for irrigation channels.
   ``One of the first utensils we found was a small steering oar
from a small balsa raft,'' Heyerdahl said.
   Seashells and stones from distant parts of South America found
there also indicate that the builders of Tucume were an ancient
race of sailors, he said.
   Spanish explorers found the coastal complex in the 1500s, but
they continued into the Andes in search of Inca treasure ``and
Tucome was forgotten by the world,'' Heyerdahl said.
   Oral histories of coastal dwellers recorded by the Spaniards
told of fleets of rafts that brought King Nymlap at least 2,000
years ago. Legend has it that his grandson, Kala, started work on
the pyramids, Heyerdahl said.
   ``I could only prove that balsa rafts were seaworthy and could
sail,'' he said of his 101-day, 4,300-mile voyage on the Kon-Tiki
in 1947. ``Here we have the final proof that they did sail and they
did navigate in the open ocean.''
   Heyerdahl set out on Kon-Tiki in an attempt to prove his theory
that prehistoric civilizations reached the Americas from across the
Pacific on rafts carried by ocean currents.
   He said he and his researchers had not yet determined when the
people who built Tucume arrived in Peru. But he added that the find
predates the Incas and even the Chimo, a tribe vanquished by the
Incas about 1100 A.D.
   ``By the time we finish excavation we will be able to say when
it all started,'' he said.
   ``The Incas were to South America what the Romans were in
Europe. They were not the founders of culture. They were the
military power that took over what others had created.''
   Though the origins are obscure, Heyerdahl said, it is clear the
Tucume civilization was wiped out.
   ``There are many lessons in the past and one lesson is that not
one civilization has been eternal,'' he said.

   Consider the advantages of pedal power:
inexpensive and pollution-free. There are twice as many bicycles as
there are automobiles, yet much of the world is curiously
ambivalent toward them. Are they relics of another century or are
they the wave of the future?
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>By JOHN BARBOUR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Newsfeatures Writer</BYLINE>

   Here they come, thousands at a time steering quietly down the
streets of Amsterdam and Beijing, or a file of humped silhouettes
etched against the mountain-ocean sunset of California.
   Here they come, bicycles and their riders, caught by the dawn's
early light or the headlight's glare, pumping legs, determined
faces, wheeling to work, wheeling home, or just determined to stay
fit.
   Bicycles. There are 800 million in all, 88 million in the United
States, 300 million in China, a very personal, pollution-free mode
of transportation.
   The question is: Are they relics of another century, or are they
the wave of the future?
   The competition is the automobile, 400 million in the world. No
one in his right mind would say it's an even fight.
   But the Worldwatch Institute in Washington, a think tank,
recently published Worldwatch Paper 90 by Marcia D. Lowe with the
title ``The Bicycle. Vehicle For A Small Planet.''
   The message is that bicycles consume less energy per passenger
mile than any other form of transportation, including walking. A
cyclist can cover 3{ miles on the calories in an ear of corn, 10
miles on the 350 calories in a bowl of rice. The average American
car covers 10 miles on about half a gallon of gasoline, or 18,600
calories.
   Bicyclists do not produce smog or acid rain. They do not
endanger the ozone layer and few cyclists are pulled over for DWI.
They do produce sweat, however.
   Marcia Lowe writes that 33 states included bicycle promotion
measures in their plans to comply with the Clean Air Act of 1970.
Los Angeles would make major employers reduce the ratio of
commuting cars to employees. Other Western cities would make
employers provide bicycle parking and shower facilities.
   All of this comes 90 years after the bicycle craze crested in
America. In 1899, with automobiles not yet on the road, and public
transportation in the form of trolleys and electric trains just an
infant enterprise, the United States was selling more than a
million bicycles a year. In a nation of barely 76 million, those
were impressive figures.
   So ubiquitous were those ``safety'' bikes that they altered
American fashions. Knickers kept pants legs out of the way of chain
drives, long Norfolk jackets caught the mud, and women began to
wear shorter skirts and, heaven forfend, bloomers, so they could
ride their bikes. Whole families would go out for weekend bicycle
outings.
   Fred Zahradnik of Bicycling magazine points out that the bicycle
was a vehicle for technology as well as people. The Wright Brothers
were bicycle makers, as were hundreds of other tinkerers of the
late 1800s. Orville and Wilbur experimented with lightweight tubing
that eventually made their airplane design possible. Glen Curtis
worked on bicycles and applied motors to them before he
concentrated on aircraft engine design.
   If one looks into the past, he may find some hints to the
bicycle's future.
   In its heyday, the bike was personalized, individual
transportation. ``It didn't have the upkeep of a horse or the
expense of a carriage,'' Zahradnik says. ``If the roads got bad,
you could pick it up and carry it. It was one of the fastest,
easiest, simplest forms of transportation.''
   And it built roads. It was the complaints of bicyclists in
Washington and state capitals that led to the first modern surge of
road-building. It paved the way for the automobile.
   But, oddly, it wasn't the car that led to the fall of the
bicycle. It was public transportation, steam-powered locomotives
and the electric trolley, which were felled in turn by the car.
   In the late 1800s, a good bike cost about $100, which was
expensive in days when the average income was $8 a week. Today some
are as cheap as $100 or as expensive as $3,000. The United States
makes about 5 million bikes a year and imports another 5 million.
   Americans, however, remain in love with their cars.
   In China, where one person in every 74,000 owns an automobile,
one in four owns a bike. In one study in the northern industrial
city of Tianjin, monitors counted 50,000 bicycles passing one
intersection in an hour.
   Bicycle ownership does not mean bicycle use. Forty-one million
American bikes are owned by children.
   In Britain, one out of every four people owns a bike, yet only
one out of every 33 transport trips are made by bike.
   Writes Worldwatch Institute's Lowe:
   ``The United States has seven times as many bicycles per person
as India, but because one out of every two Americans owns an
automobile _ compared with one out of 500 Indians _ bicycles play a
much more modest role in the U.S. transportation system.''
   The Chinese phenomenon began when the last emperor, Pu Yi, began
pedaling around the Forbidden City in the early 1900s. Today,
China's annual bike sales exceed 40 million.
   ``The rest of the developing world lags far behind in bicycle
transportation,'' says the Worldwatch report. ``In much of Africa
and even more widely in Latin America, the prestige and power of
auto ownership has made governments ignore pedal power and led
citizens to scorn the bicycle as a vehicle for the poor.''
   Oddly, the cost of fuel for Latin American and African cars
contributes to their national debt and their trade deficits. There
are exceptions. In Bogota, the capital of Colombia, the city's
largest bakery replaced most of its trucks with 900 delivery trikes
to supply 60,000 neighborhood shops.

   In Europe, the Netherlands and Denmark have taken steps to make
their roads more friendly for cyclists with the result that
bicycles are used for 20 percent to 30 percent of all urban trips
and up to half in some towns.
   In the Netherlands, a recent system of taxes increased the cost
of buying and driving a car by half. An electronic system will
monitor speedometers and excessive drivers will be taxed
accordingly. At the same time, public transit is being given an
extra $5.7 billion a year.
   In Denmark, officials claim that gasoline prices are the highest
in Europe, thanks to aggressive taxing. And, says the Worldwatch
report, ``the Danish Ministry of Transport describes the 186
percent sales tax on new cars _ compared with 47 percent in the
Netherlands and 5 percent in the United States _as paying for three
cars and getting only one.''
   A British study said that if only 10 percent of car trips of
less than 10 miles were made by bicycle it would cut the country's
fuel consumption by 14 million barrels of oil a year, 2 percent of
annual consumption.
   The ironies abound. Third World governments concentrate on
building roads for cars in their rural areas despite the fact that
their rural citizens do not have cars or trucks. Worldwatch quotes
transportation expert Wilfred Owen as saying, ``Many miles of roads
in poor countries prove more useful for drying beans and peppers
than for moving traffic.''
   And even though bicycle rickshaws are a transportation mainstay
in many Asian countries, and a means of raising the income and
status of poor people, some local governments say they are unsafe
or inhumane. A more likely motive, says Worldwatch, is that the
quaint rickshaws make cities look poor or backward.
   So it comes to pass that in Dhaka in Bangladesh, the government
threatened to phase out rickshaws, even though they employ 140,000
people and account for more than half of the city's passenger miles.
   And in Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia, some 100,000 rickshaws
have been confiscated in the last five years and dumped into the
sea.
   Japan, which makes cars for most of the world, leans heavily on
bicycles and commuter railroads. When railway terminals began to
suffer from bicycle pollution, the government set aside bike
parking lots of which there are now 8,600 with a capacity of 2.4
million bikes. In urban downtowns where land prices are over $7,000
a square foot, they have built bike parking towers.
   In California, the university towns of Davis and Palo Alto vie
for cycling honors. Davis boasts that a quarter of all trips made
by its 44,000 citizens are made by bike. Bike trailers are a common
sight for lugging groceries or children.
   Palo Alto pays its employees 7 cents a mile for all business
travel by bike. It sponsors a city wide ``leave your car at home
day,'' has a bicycle squad in its police force and holds a traffic
school for children who break bicycle laws.
   Some employers in the city of 56,000 have joined the movement.
One offers bike commuters $1 a day for every day they ride to work.
Xerox provides free towel service in the shower room.
   It's been 173 years since the first bike appeared in 1816. A lot
has changed. Bikes have evolved from a crude contraption called the
hobbyhorse, which was propelled by the rider's feet on the ground,
to the enlarged front wheel that covered more ground for each
revolution of the rider's pedals, to chain drives and the safety
bicycle, to today's one-piece lightweight frames.
   Bicycles gave the world ball bearings and pneumatic tires.
   In the late 1800s, bicycle racers were some of the highest paid
athletes in the country, garnering winnings of between $20,000 to
$40,000 a year.
   ``They were like today's superstars,'' says Bicycling's Fred
Zahradnik. ``They traveled the world to race.''
   Thousands flocked to see the six-day bike races on wooden or
concrete tracks. At the turn of the century there were some 200
race tracks in the United States alone.
   One racer was Charles (Mile-a-Minute) Murphy. On June 30, 1899,
he pumped up to 60 mph on a board track making use of the suction
behind a fast locomotive.
   Another, Zahradnik says, was Major Taylor, ``one of the first
great black athletes to emerge in the United States in the late
1800s. He was often turned down by hotels on his world racing
circuit.''
   Bike makers have constantly changed designs to appeal to young
riders. With the balloon tire came Schwinn's Streamliner. There was
the Donald Duck bike by Shelby, sporting a Donald Duck hood
ornament and a quack-quack horn. There was the Huffy Radiobike,
which had a radio in the tank on the crossbars. In the late 1950s
there was Bowden Spacelander and a drag racer called the Schwinn
Orangecrate.
   But now engineers are setting out to improve designs for
practical reasons. Bicycle trailers and three- and four-wheel
designs are increasing the load-carrying capacity.
   The Oxtrike, designed at Oxford University, has a platform and
gears capable of moving heavy cargo. In India, designers are
working on a multipurpose bike that can double as a
non-transportation motor for threshing rice paddies, shelling
peanuts or pumping water.
   It may indeed be that the wheels of the past will power the
future.

   Come along on a ride on a bicycle built for two,
through a scenic area of Italy that has changed little over the
centuries. It's really the best way to see the countryside and meet
the people, but couch potatoes had best spend a while getting in
shape before setting out on a pedal-power tour.

   Imagine days of gliding through scenes
from Roman antiquity on a bicycle, with midmorning stops for
cappuccino, streamside lunches of fresh-baked bread, cheese,
prosciutto and wine and evenings in luxurious villas.
   Thousands of people, young and old, athlete and couch potato,
are finding travel by bicycle an exhilarating way of really seeing
the countryside, talking to people and finding historic or cultural
locales rarely available to those speeding through on
air-conditioned tour buses.
   Many adventurous souls are setting off on bicycle trips on their
own, loading their two-wheelers with clothing, bedrolls and
necessities. Others are letting a tour company make lodging
arrangements, plan an itinerary, schedule meals and provide a van
to haul luggage.
   Bicycle tours are available through most European countries,
most areas of the United States, Central and South America and even
the Soviet Union and China.
   I and my wife chose one of the most experienced biking and
walking tour operators, Butterfield and Robinson of Toronto, and
rode from near Milan, Italy, to Venice on a bicycle built for two,
a French-made 10-speed tandem. You can ship your own bike or the
tour operator will provide custom-made bicycles.
   The American Bicycle Federation says the number of bicyclers in
this country increased from 78 million to 88 million since 1985.
   It is expected the bicycle craze will spurt again now that
American Greg LeMond has won the prestigious Tour de France.
   Several states hold popular cross-state bicycle tours. One of
the most grueling is the Ride the Rockies tour that this year
covered 361 miles and went over 11,990-foot Loveland Pass. Tour
director Paul Balaguer said 3,500 people applied for the tour,
which is limited to 2,000.
   Our Northern Italy group included 23 Americans _ people from all
walks of life from all parts of the United States. Ages ranged from
about 30 to the 60s. Tour operators said the eldest to date had
been a 78-year-old man.
   Some had done nothing more to train for the trip than their
usual tennis or golf game. They also were a little stiff and sore
the first day or two, but that quickly went away. My wife and I had
bicycled about 30 miles on Saturdays and Sundays for two months
before the tour and found the tour a breeze.
   Bicycle helmets and biking gloves are strongly recommended and
an athletic shoe with a firm sole is a good idea. Otherwise,
clothing is left up to the individual. On the tour, attire ranged
from skin-tight bicycling outfits to shorts, T-shirts and slacks. A
lightweight rain jacket is recommended, for chilly mornings and
afternoon showers.
   Our group gathered in the lobby of a Milan hotel and then it was
off by bus to Sirmione, on a peninsula on the southern shore of
Lake Garda, Italy's largest. At the tip, a modern hydrofoil
passenger boat cruised past the ruins of a Roman spa.
   Idling past sidewalk cafes, coffee shops and tourists, the bus
squeezed through a narrow passageway at a historic castle, then
deposited our group at the steps of Villa Cortine, the first of
several luxurious villas where our palates would be pampered at
multicourse meals and our bodies rested in regal suites.
   Our two guides _ Jennifer, a Toronto lawyer, and Nick, whose
future plans include screenwriting in New York _ showed us our
bicycles and gave us an orientation on safety, including the
required wearing of helmets and a caution against braking hard with
only the front brake (it can throw you over the handlebars).
   They discussed the daily routine: breakfast together and then to
the bicycles, which would be checked and ready. The cyclists were
encouraged to set their own pace and see the sights. Some raced off
each morning on optional side trips that saw them travel up to 50
miles in a day. Others stopped to take photographs, visit with the
natives, enjoy a cappuccino or espresso and purchase postcards,
still completing the average 30 miles a day in time for a swim at
the villa.

   Detailed instructions for each day's route were handed out at
breakfast with a caveat that directions are subject to personal
interpretation and ``one person's `bear right at the cross' could
be another's `hard right at the T-intersection.''' And, said the
guides, ``remember _ getting lost is part of the adventure.''
   A sample instruction read ``2 km (kilometers) from the tower,
turn right at intersection following signs for Vaccarolo and San
Pietro, not Solferino. (At this intersection the abandoned Abbey of
San Firgillo can be seen directly in front of you.)''
   Tours are graded by level of difficulty from the Northern Italy
level one (rolling hills and generally level, but with one hill
where we pushed the tandem to the top) to the level four Giro
D'Italia, described as ``a challenging route through the hills of
Tuscany and Umbria ... designed for the enthusiastic and
experienced cyclist.''
   An example of the magnificent villas chosen for touring
bicyclers was the Villa Corner in Cavasagra, built in 1500 and
named for a queen, Caterina Cornaro. The villa was extensively
rebuilt in 1700 by a Palladian architect.
   Today it has manicured grounds, a vineyard, huge pool, spa,
tennis courts and suites the size of some American town houses.
After we finished the tour and went sightseeing in Venice, the room
at our pensione was the size of the walk-in closet in our Villa
Corner suite.
   The tour stayed on side roads with light traffic. Even when the
cyclists pedaled into larger cities such as Verona, they found
Italian motorists to be considerate. Thousands of Italians pedal to
school, to work or to the market, but safety helmets are unknown
and ours brought many curious glances.
   Sights along the way included ancient and modern churches,
centuries-old family estates, more castles than could be counted,
family-operated wineries and a wedding celebration.
   In Verona there was a wine lecture and tasting at the Instituto
Enologico Italiano, a tour of the ancient Roman arena and the opera
house, a visit to the balcony of Romeo and Juliet fame and a walk
through the crowded stalls in the marketplace where we ate
bambolino _ calorie-laden fried dough sprinkled with sugar.
   One day's highlights included a tour of Lugano, one of the
countless small wineries. This one, operated by Luigi Fraccaroli,
produced a delicate white wine, samples of which were offered to
the American cyclists. A tractor arrived, pulling a trailer with
the first day's pickings of the new grape harvest. The tourists
watched as the grapes were crushed.
   On day five, Jennifer and Nick surprised the group with a picnic
feast in the courtyard of an ancient castle on a hilltop outside
the walled city of Soave. They loaded a table with fruits, cheeses,
meats, breads and wines, highlighted by bunches of fresh-picked
wildflowers. A group photograph was taken for posterity.
   After a day's ride, there was a cocktail party where the day's
events were discussed. Then, a sumptuous dinner.
   One evening menu read: crepes, pasta and smoked ham, pasta e
fagioli alla veneta (traditional pasta and beans in a cream soup),
roast beef al Pepe or sole a la Venetian, then choices from a
breathtaking dessert tray, followed by hearty Italian coffee, all
accompanied by fine Italian wines.
   Since it was harvest time, bowls of incredibly sweet grapes were
placed in reception areas and guest rooms.
   All too soon, the bicyclists reached Villa Corner at Cavasagra,
outside Venice, the final destination.
   ``This was my first tour, but I expect we'll do it again,'' said
Jack Blakemore of Greenbrae, Calif.
   Kathy Hillis of Nevada City, Calif., said: ``I loved talking to
all the people. It was really neat to ride down the road and say
`buon giorno' to the villagers.''
   ``It was one unforgettable incident after another,'' said Angelo
Capozzi of Tiburon, Calif.

   When she's not at work, Ann Marie Wells likes
wearing bikinis, off-the-shoulder dresses and slinky long gowns.
She likes men who pick up the check and open doors for her. Does
that sound like a Marine drill instructor, a lady leatherneck
training recruits at a boot camp rocked a year ago by the ``Lesbian
Mafia'' scandals?

   Charging through the boondocks with a
50-pound pack on her back, rappelling from a 45-foot tower, or
crawling under barbed wire to the chatter of machine guns may seem
a long way from Bergdorf's, but Marine drill instructor Ann Marie
Wells doesn't think her chosen career is bizarre.
   ``Shoot, when women first voted that was considered bizarre,''
she says in a demure Philadelphia accent reminiscent, like her
upswept strawberry blond hairdo, of a young Katharine Hepburn.
``Mine just happens to be a career a lot of women don't pick. Or
males either, for that matter.''
   Staff Sgt. Wells turned up her voice level and barked an order
at a recruit daydreaming in the shade of a scrawny tree to the
blam-blam lullaby of the adjacent hand grenade course. ``Grab your
war bonnet, Pyle, and double-time back to your squad.''
   ``Aye, aye, Ma'am,'' cried the boot, gathering up her M-16 rifle
and disappearing into the woods while trying to jam the new Kevlar
helmet onto a matted mop of pinned-up curls.
   Platoon 4028 was in its ninth week of boot camp at Parris
Island, three weeks shy of graduation. They were found bivouacked
in pup tents at the edge of an abandoned airstrip, fighting a
guerrilla war against mosquitoes, sand fleas, an occasional rattle
snake and raccoons as big as dogs.
   ``Those raccoons thrive on our MRE's _ meals ready to eat,'' the
D.I. explains.
   Reveille had sounded at 4:45 a.m. A murky blob of a sun,
promising another blistering, humid day, barely pinked the
surrounding marshes when Wells double-timed her 47 charges out to
the infiltration course.
   Two dead rats floating in the ditch before a wall that had to be
scaled added an unscheduled horror to the grueling exercise.
   ``Crawl, use both legs, keep your heels and head down. Low
silhouette on that wall,'' Wells told her recruits between TNT
blasts anointing them with mud.
   In the control tower, synchronizing the detonations so a charge
went off whenever a recruit crept near a sandbag bunker, Gunnery
Sgt. Harvey Sanders spotted one boot more terrified of the dead
rodents than the live explosives. She bounded out of the ditch and
over the wall like an Olympic hurdler.
   ``You're dead,'' he rasped over the loudspeaker in a deep
Kentucky drawl. ``You didn't check for booby traps. Now somebody's
got to go to your Mommy and Daddy's home and tell them you're dead
because you didn't listen.''
   Since the Marine Corps a decade ago mustered out demeaning
obscenities and an occasional busted lip as too negative an
approach to molding character, drill instructors have resorted to a
lingua franca rich in morbid humor and inelegant variations just a
tad shy of the scatological.
   ``Camouflaged cussing,'' as one of them called it, has made
trash an all-purpose word, as when a D.I. bellows, ``Don't give me
any of that trash'' or ``Pick up your trash and move out'' or
``Plunge those gun barrels 15 times. Get all that trash out of
there.''
   All prospective women Marines go through boot camp at the Parris
Island Recruit Depot under female instructors who work side-by-side
with male instructors. Their training is as rugged as males
undergo, except that women spend an extra week honing combat skills
because they will not be going on to advanced infantry training.
   ``They claim we women will not be going to war, and will only be
used in support, but I don't know anyone who believes that,'' Wells
said as her sweat-soaked, mud-caked recruits hurried off to the
last of the three hot showers allotted during their 10 days in the
field. ``We teach 'em to be aggressive and to know how to defend
themselves. If it ever comes down to it, they're going to fight.''
   Recruits rarely wear makeup in the field, except facial paint
for combat maneuvers. But Marines of both sexes slosh on a
particular brand of bath oil in the belief that it fends off the
low country's voracious insects.
   ``They don't completely surrender their femininity,'' observed
Wells, looking feminine in her utility field cap, polished combat
boots and a wide shiny black belt _ the sign of a senior D.I. _
hugging a Meryl Streep figure in crisply starched ``cammies,''
camouflaged fatigues.
   Female boots can make appointments at the beauty parlor, while
men get those flattops on a barbershop assembly line. ``They can
wear their hair any way they want, as long as it doesn't fall below
the shoulder,'' Wells says.
   Female instructors never fancied the ``Smokey,'' the
broad-brimmed felt hat that their male counterparts tilt over their
eyes.
   Instead, the distinguishing mark of their profession is a
braided scarlet cord or ``pogey rope'' draped over the left
shoulder. On parade, both sexes expertly brandish a ceremonial
sword.
   How did an admittedly ``shy, quiet kind of kid'' from a Roman
Catholic high school in northeast Philadelphia wind up swinging on
a rope like Tarzan's Jane across a murky pond and bellowing ``Roll
over like a dead roach with your feet in the air'' at recruits who
fail to don a gas mask in nine seconds?
   ``The nuns back at St. Hubert's would never believe it,'' says
Wells, who turns 24 this month. ``I didn't feel like going on to
college, but I didn't want to do anything ordinary. So I joined
up.'' Good at sports, she breezed through boot camp, became a coach
on the rifle range, went to radio school, then spent 9{ weeks at
Parris Island's co-ed drill instructors school.
   ``The most strenuous course in the corps,'' proclaims 1st Sgt.
Larry Carson of New Orleans, the top NCO at the D.I. school. ``But
lady leathernecks don't get any breaks around here. When I look
down that line, I don't see males or females. I just see Marines.''

   In the courtyard beyond his window, Staff Sgt. Marie Price of
Chicago, the first female instructor at the D.I. school, was
drilling men and women D.I. candidates in the bombastic basics of
issuing commands.
   ``Their voices may sound different, but they got to be loud,''
mused the first sergeant. ``These women come to hate me as much as
the men, but after they leave here they have a change of heart.
Some even invite me to their weddings.''
   Recruits may doubt it, but a drill instructor's heart is capable
of a meltdown leading to matrimony. Sometimes they marry other
drill instructors.
   ``And that's total war,'' laughs D.I. Sandra Love of Charlotte,
N.C., one of Wells's cohorts who has undergone an interesting
change in nomenclature.
   Before her divorce, she was Sgt. Nails and gloried in the mock
initials H.A., for ``Hard As Nails.'' Her modest boast is ``never
having met a recruit I couldn't handle, but I know my day is
coming.''
   In her knife defense class, Sgt. Love sent a recruit sprawling
and nimbly missed staightening her Orphan Annie curls with a combat
boot to the cadence cry of ``grab, smash, hook, twist and stomp.''
   ``Nothing I like better than seeing Marines slamming hard on the
deck,'' says the close combat instructor, identified by the skull
and crossed bayonets on his T-shirt. ``The female of the Marine
species is way deadlier than the male.''
   The scene was a far cry from a decade ago when women recruits
were taught how to pour tea and were required to wear girdles.
   As D.I., Wells receives a $260 increment to her staff sergeant's
basic pay of $1,325 a month. Her working hours from reveille at
4:45 a.m. to Taps at 8:45 p.m. leave ``little time for romance,''
she says, while donning a MOPP (mission orientation protective
posture) suit to lead her platoon into ``the house of pain,'' the
gas chamber. ``When we're not working we're sleeping.''
   Ashore, as Marines call being away from the depot in Navy lingo,
the D.I. enjoys being a young woman. ``I still wear my hair long.
People don't even know I'm a Marine. I love wearing bikinis,
off-the-shoulder dresses and slinky long gowns.
   ``I like men picking up the dinner check _ that's survival _ and
opening the door for you. Hey, I'm no brute.''
   D.I. Wells has never been in a situation where she had to employ
her martial arts skill. ``But stuff has sure happened to a lot of
my recruits. They've been raped or mugged or something, and they
wish they'd known then how to defend themselves.''
   Almost every new batch of recruits arriving at Fourth Battalion,
the women's recruit unit, includes at least one undetected
pregnancy, several college graduates, a number of kids fleeing
inner-city violence or small-town boredom, a couple of ``Jane
Wayne'' over-achievers, and always the platoon comic.
   ``Comedians help relieve tension, as long as their jokes aren't
aimed at us,'' Wells says. ``We tell recruits when to laugh and
when not to.''
   All recruits have to test drug-free, and 99 percent are high
school graduates. Although boot-type ``shock incarceration''
programs are being tested at prisons in a dozen states, few come to
Parris Island straight from the criminal court docket. ``The old
days of four in the corps or 10 in the pen are gone,'' says Gunnery
Sgt. Sanders. ``Hey, we're choosy now.''
   Drill instructors off duty swap stories about the ``yo-yos'' who
march to a different cadence count under the platoon guide-on. ``We
get the female Gomer Pyles and the Pvt. Benjamins,'' Wells says.
``They do some funny things.
   ``The Pvt. Benjamins are the best _ the pretty ones with the
long fingernails. We call them powderpuffs. They've been babied all
their lives. We make them earn their keep.''
   Parris Island graduates 19,000 new Marines a year, 1,800 of them
women. Both sexes have the same drop-out rate, about 15 percent.
   ``Mental stress washes out more of them than the physical
demands,'' Wells says. ``You can always build someone up, but some
can't cope with having to do a couple of things at the same time in
a hurry.''
   Her outstanding recruit this time around is Pvt. Ramona Racquet,
from Blossvale, N.Y., who stands 4-foot-9, wears a size 2{ shoe,
totes a pack half her weight and outscored all the males on the
rifle range. ``I call her my mini-recruit,'' Wells says. ``Her feet
always hurt. They can't find boots to fit her, but she's proof that
women can do it all.''
   Parris Island is just beginning to rebound from its ``Lesbian
Mafia'' headlines of a year ago when three women Marines were
jailed and 14 others were administratively discharged for
homosexual liaisons that included drill instructors and recruits.
   Now it is facing another social problem of our times: single
parents. ``We get single parents, both men and women, signing up
for D.I. school,'' Carson says. ``I got a gut feeling there's just
no way a D.I. can make a good single parent.''
   Down the road, a decade or so from now, Wells sees herself in a
more sedate career: ``I'd like to be a housewife, with a couple of
kids, but I'd have to do something else. I'm not much at sitting
around the back yard.''
   Does she worry that her D.I. past might make her more of
martinet than a mother, bullying, even brutalizing her kids like
the Marine parent in the movie ``The Great Santini''?
   ``Who me?'' she asks, those big gray eyes widening in shock.
``No way. Shoot, the way I treat my recruits, why I'm so nice to
them, they abuse me more than I abuse them.''

   Three toxic waste sites in a town of 30,000 may
not be a record, but it certainly has got the attention of the
townspeople of Jacksonville, Ark., regardless of which side they
are on. One side is screaming about the stink and the sickness, the
other wants to paint a cheerier picture.

   Don Bailey remembers hunting swamp
rabbits as a boy down by the town dump, how the frisky rabbits
would jump when you sneaked up and run for half a mile. They made
good eating.
   He also remembers swimming in nearby Lake Dupree, always curious
about the wind-whipped orange foam that lathered its banks.
   Bailey is now 39. He is so ill he can't work, has lost all
feeling in one arm, and his brother and sister also have strange
allergies and ailments the doctors can't seem to correct.
   Today the dump has a chain-link fence around it with a red sign
that says ``KEEP OUT. HAZARDOUS WASTE AREA.'' As for the rabbits,
Bailey remembers when their always reliable numbers began to
dwindle and you had to walk up and kick one to get it to move.
   ``I killed one, took it home, cut it open and it was yellow as a
lemon inside,'' he recalls. ``It stank.''
   Jacksonville, a town of 30,000 just north of Little Rock, is the
location of three toxic waste sites on the Environmental Protection
Agency's ``priority'' list _ Super Fund sites.
   Thousands of drums containing waste byproducts of now-banned
herbicides sit on a covered concrete slab where four chemical
companies operated for 40 years.
   For more than 10 years, since the EPA first started
investigating, some of the towns citizens have been raising a stink
of their own. They fear they are being poisoned by dioxin.
   Among 1,194 priority cleanup sites across America (out of more
than 30,000 non-priority sites) three may not seem like many, but
these citizens feel that in a town this size it is quite a
distinction, though dubious, and 10 years is a long time to wait to
get it cleaned up.
   ``This town is a chemical soup,'' says Claudett Hazlett, ``and
I'm angry about it.''
   Ms. Hazlett is Don Bailey's sister, which would explain her
anger, not to mention her own constant headaches and back problems.
She is also vice president of a group called People Against a
Chemically Contaminated Environment.
   On the other hand, Jacksonville boosters say that the town has
confronted its problem and is supporting a cleanup, and that
notoriety hurts the town's image.
   ``We are left with a legacy that requires remediation,'' says
state Rep. Mike Wilson. ``Fortunately that contamination is
confined to a very small area that affects no one that we can see.
There's a lot of sex appeal for the media in dead-baby stories.''
   Wilson is spokesman for a group called Jacksonville People With
Pride.
   A third group, Jacksonville People With Pride Cleanup Coalition,
was awarded three EPA grants of $50,000 to hire technical advisers
to monitor cleanup at all three sites: Reasor-Hill Chemical Corp.
and successors Hercules Powder Co., Transvaal Inc. and Vertac
Chemical Corp.
   That's when the dispute boiled over. Ms. Hazlett's group,
furious, told the EPA that Hercules was a member of the opposition
group, People With Pride. The government, she maintained, would be
paying a transgressor to monitor the cleanup.
   EPA withdrew the grants.
   Wilson acknowledges Hercules was a member of People With Pride
and People With Pride Cleanup Coalition has many of the same
members, but he says Hercules was not one of them.
   ``Since we had told EPA from the very beginning that Hercules
was a contributor to Jacksonville People With Pride and they knew
it, I can't understand why they changed their mind,'' says Wilson.
``Now that they have changed their mind we are going to find out
why.''

   With the grants up for grabs, enter a fourth group: the
Jacksonville Environmental Network, which encompasses Ms. Hazlett's
group and others who are angry. That group has applied for the
grants and has vowed to oppose any attempt by the coalition group
to try again for the money by ``sanitizing'' its membership.
   At least, says Ms. Hazlett, the EPA's withdrawal of the grants
should inspire people nationwide to fight regulatory decisions.
   The president of the coalition, Ruby Brown, says the group did
indeed intend to use the technical advisers to play down publicity
about the contamination, but Wilson says that is not so.
   ``We have got a proven record,'' Wilson says. ``The big picture
in all this is not whether we or someone else receives a grant. The
purpose of the grant is to educate and inform, and we are doing
that anyway. The big picture is solving the problem, and that is
cleaning up this chemical contamination.''
   Meanwhile, those barrels of toxic waste remain.
   MRK, an incineration frim in Zachary, La., received a contract
in July to do a trial burn next March at the 93-acre Vertac site.
If tests go well, it could start incinerating 2.5 million tons an
hour a month later, says Richard Merritt of the Arkansas Department
of Pollution Control and Ecology.
   Vertac, which began as a World War II ordnance plant, produced
the herbicide known as Agent Orange. To incinerate about 28,000
barrels of the ingredients of that herbicide would take about six
months, Merrill estimates. If the EPA judges the ash to be
non-hazardous, it will be put in drums and buried in a landfill.
   Wilson says there is no medical evidence to link the chemicals
and the illnesses, which Ms. Hazlett concedes _ for now.
   Even if the chemicals are burned and buried, she says, it won't
slow her crusade. She says her group plans to make a door-to-door
health survey to document community illnesses.
   She has her own, and her brother, Don Bailey, has his, and
Bailey says he had a friend who worked at Vertac and died of
cancer. Bailey says his friend told him the company sent home a
letter telling his family to wash his clothes separately.
   But Bailey, a slight, bearded man with a useless arm, hands that
tremble, asthma, allergies and chronic headaches, says no one ever
warned him about swimming in the lake with the orange foam or of
eating the rabbits and the fish he brought home for the family
table.
   ``They were doing this to people and they knew about it and they
didn't tell the people about it,'' he says.
   But when he opened up a rabbit and it stank, didn't he suspect?
   ``It didn't dawn on people what was what,'' he says. After all,
those companies provided good jobs for good pay.
   The only other big employer in Jacksonville is an Air Force base.
   Only retribution against the polluters, it seems, will satisfy
Ms. Hazlett.
   ``Don's life is ruined,'' she says. ``His future is gone. And a
multibillion-dollar industry is reaping the profits at the expense
of somebody like this.
   ``I think it's time our government officials stood up and took a
stand and said, `That's enough.'''

   To satisfy the growing demand for lumber at the
end of World War II, loggers began cutting down all the trees in
large sections of forest and replanting the area with trees of a
commercially desirable species. That practice, called
clear-cutting, has persisted to this day, even in publicly owned
national forests. There is one notable exception, the Shawnee
National Forest in Illinois.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>By PAUL DE LA GARZA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CARBONDALE, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New restrictions on the way loggers
harvest timber in the vast Shawnee National Forest in southern
Illinois has given environmentalists hope that others will follow
suit.
   A Shawnee management plan that went into effect last year bans
almost all clear-cutting, the chopping down of all trees regardless
of their age in tracts of 20 to 40 acres, instead of selective
cutting of individual trees.
   ``What happened in the Shawnee is nationally significant because
it's never happened before,'' says Jim Bensman of the Sierra Club.
``Now you can say: `Look at the Shawnee. If they can do it, why
can't we?'''
   But the U.S. Forest Service, which manages 156 national forests,
is not rushing into a nationwide ban on clear-cutting.
   ``Our management philosophy,'' explains F. Dale Robertson,
Forest Service chief, ``is to let these things be worked out
locally as it has been done in the Shawnee. We want to be at peace
with the local people.''
   Some heated words were exchanged in the battle of the Shawnee, a
262,000-acre forest of oak and hickory bounded on the east by the
Ohio River and on the west by the Mississippi River.
   Joe Glisson of the grassroots organization Regional Association
of Concerned Environmentalists called his opposition ``bumbling
idiots.'' Charles Daugherty, president of the Illinois Wood
Products Association, called Glisson's group ``meddlesome folks''
and troublemakers.
   Somewhere in the middle was the U.S. Forest Service.
   Environmentalists say clear-cutting causes erosion, degrades
water quality, reduces the wildlife habitat and leaves an ugly
landscape of stumps and ruffled underbrush.
   But the Forest Service, while conceding clear-cutting adversely
affects some wildlife, maintains it's the best method of caring for
and cultivating forests.
   Clearcuts, the agency argues, emulate natural disasters such as
fires, which rejuvenate timber stands. The large cuts allow
sunshine to saturate the forest, enhancing growth.
   The practice also benefits some game animals such as deer and
wild turkey, the Forest Service says.
   The agency reminds critics that federal law requires it to
maintain timber for America's use and that without logging roads
the public would have no access to the forest.
   Len Carey, an agency spokesman in Washington, likens
clear-cutting to harvesting corn.
   ``What about clear-cutting in the cornfields? Isn't that what we
do? Grow the corn and cut it down?''
   The National Forest Products Association points out that the
timber industry nationally employs 1.3 million people with an
annual payroll of $29.6 billion.
   ``We're not the bad guys,'' Daugherty says. ``We're who make the
jobs.''
   Chopping individual trees was the predominant method of logging
before World War II. After the war, the Forest Service approved
stepped-up clear-cutting to satisfy the growing demand for lumber.
   The goal of clear-cutting is twofold: the immediate sale of a
large quantity of timber and the replacement of the natural forest
with even-aged stands of trees of the commercially preferred
species.
   Of the 11 billion to 12 billion board feet cut annually from the
191 million acres of federal forest land, about half is harvested
by clear-cutting, says the Forest Service's Dick Fitzgerald in
Washington.
   But the Wilderness Society puts the figure closer to 75 percent.
   The Shawnee dispute is rooted in the National Forest Management
Act of 1976, which required national forests to devise 50-year
management plans.
   The act also required that clear-cutting only be used when found
to be the ``optimum method'' of tree harvesting.
   In November 1986, the Shawnee approved its forest plan.
   Four appeals were filed by environmental groups.
   The original draft of the plan emphasized clear-cutting as the
preferred method of harvest and placed annual hardwood harvest
levels at 12.6 million board feet. A typical 30-foot tree yields
about 1,000 board feet.
   On Aug. 15, 1988, after mediated talks, the agency agreed to
alter its forest plan, eliminating clear-cutting almost entirely.
   All but one appellant, the Association of Concerned
Environmentalists, agreed to drop their appeals.
   Forest Service officials and environmentalists say that while
management plans in other national forests limit clear-cutting,
none comes close to the Shawnee.
   According to environmentalists, many of the ecological problems
linked to clear-cutting are reduced by using individual tree
selection or group selection _ smaller cuts in the forest.
   Leon Minckler, a consultant on environmental forestry in
Virginia and a 33-year veteran of the Forest Service, conducted a
20-year experiment in group selection on the Kaskaskia Experimental
Forest in southern Illinois.
   He believes it works.
   ``The Forest Service has in almost no cases shown that
clear-cutting is the optimum method,'' Minckler says. ``It might be
the optimum method for the logger. It's not optimum for the
forest.''
   Minckler says the Forest Service balks at group selection
because it's time-consuming and costs more money. Foresters must
examine each tree to determine if it's ready for the mill.
   The agency contends alternatives are unproven, albeit Minckler's
research found that under group selection the forest remains highly
diversified, providing a wide range of habitat for wildlife.
   But the Forest Service said more acreage is affected by group
selection and its smaller cuts in order to get the same harvest
volume as clear-cutting.
   The Regional Association of Concerned Environmentalists, unlike
the Sierra Club, opposes all clear-cutting, except for the
elimination of diseased timber stands _ a position that riles the
timber industry.
   Rich Hoppie of the Wilderness Society called the Shawnee
clear-cutting ban ``a small step.''
   ``We want to see it done more,'' he said, ``but we have no
expectations that the Forest Service will do so willingly.''

   With all the talk of drugs and hard living, of
sex and sudden stardom, it's hard to imagine innocence in the
record business. But here it is, a handsome, clean-living young man
who has made music his life.

   Singer Kevin Paige is tall, dark, blue-eyed and
handsome with a pearly smile. At 23, he is a budding star and
photogenic. Trouble is, he's not all that fond of picture-taking
sessions and he's trying to get used to offstage celebrity.
   ``Being on stage is the coolest thing,'' he says. ``That's when
I feel comfortable.''
   As many journalists seem to want to photograph Paige in fashion
layouts as want to talk about his music. His reaction: ``I hate
picture taking. I can't stand it.'' Then, quickly following his
self-instruction to be cooperative, he adds: ``Not that I don't
like them doing it. I feel weird.''
   His first single, ``Don't Shut Me Out,'' from his first album,
``Kevin Paige,'' is climbing Billboard's best-selling chart,
getting played on radio and shown on MTV. Chrysalis Records is
ready with a second single release, ``Anything I Want.''
   ``It's an upbeat, dance-type thing like the first one, but it's
more of a statement song,'' Paige says. ``It's about my drive to do
something in music and nobody is going to tell me what approach I'm
going to take.''
   His first show after the album came out was an outdoor date in
Cape Cod, where ``Don't Shut Me Out'' was being played on the local
radio station.
   When he came offstage, he says, ``All these teen-agers started
trying to get autographs. That was the first experience of that
sort I'd ever had. They were mobbing around me, pushing things in
my face, saying, `Sign this.' It was funny. I was laughing the
whole time. They probably wonder what I was laughing about.
   ``They were 8 to 17 or 18, and some ladies, actually.''
   ``I don't date much,'' Paige says. ``I did in high school, but I
was always practicing. I was definitely committed to trying to be a
musician, not a husband. Now I'm not home to date, which is kind of
bad.''
   Paige, who neither smokes nor drinks, has lived his music.
   He grew up in Memphis, Tenn., listening to rhythm 'n' blues on
the radio.
   ``I guess I was about 10 when I started beating on a snare
drum,'' he says. ``That's when I knew I was going to be a
musician.'' He didn't think then about being a singer.
   When he was 13, his mother would drive the youngest of her nine
children to clubs in a black area of Memphis where he'd play drums
in a black band. She'd wait for him and drive him home.
   ``I was trying the other day to analyze what I really like about
rhythm 'n' blues,'' Paige says. ``It's the soul and emotion that's
put into it. But that's what any kind of music is when you think
about it.''
   Paige's father, who has a doctorate and taught voice at a
Memphis college, would have liked him to go to college, if only to
have something solid to fall back on.
   But, Paige says, ``My idea was, how could I make it good if I
wasn't really committed to doing it. The day after I graduated from
high school I immediately hit the road. That's how I made my money,
touring the college fraternity circuit all around the South in a
band, non-stop, for a couple of years.''
   After he quit the band, Paige made a tape of songs he'd written
and performed and sent it to record companies. ``Nobody got back to
me. I thought: `That's not going to work. I'd better go up there
myself.' I've got friends in Memphis who are recording people. They
said it was pretty hopeless to do that.''
   But he wrote some better songs, performed them better and in
1987 arrived in New York _ with two sisters who came on vacation.
He brought a new tape that he took to 20 record companies. ``I came
knowing nobody. I knew it was going to be pretty scary. I knew they
probably weren't going to listen to it.''
   Most didn't. But two did, and one had a good reaction. Chrysalis
phoned him a month later. ``They obviously saw something, some
talent they could develop.''
   Paige wrote nine of his album's 10 songs, all but one after
Chrysalis signed him. Making the record, he played almost all the
instruments on it, overdubbing. ``I played all the synthesizers and
piano, bass guitar, rhythm guitar, all the drums that are on there.
Most of the drums are machines. I programmed them. I like doing
that.
   ``Making the record was a blast. Trying to promote your record
is hard. Once the record is out, it's like school is back in
session. The record company has got you going somewhere different
every day.''
   Asked what he thinks is his strongest quality, he says being
nice.
   ``People like working with you when you're not an arrogant rock
'n' roller,'' he says. ``The guy who signed me was patient with me
when I was developing songs. If I had had an attitude problem or an
ego, who has time for that?''
   Paige and his band will tour. ``I didn't just hire people,'' he
says. ``The band is all my friends and they're really great
musicians, too. It's a cool situation to be in.
   ``If the single gets enough success, we'll pick up somebody's
tour and open for them. If we don't pick up one, we'll go out on
our own in small clubs.''

   For more than 60 years, ``Show Boat'' has been a
part of William Hammerstein's life.
   He remembers being taken by his father to the old Ziegfeld
Theater where he would stand in the wings beside the stage
manager's desk to watch the musical about Cap'n Andy Hawks, his
daughter, Magnolia, gambler Gaylord Ravenal, Joe, the black
stevedore, and all the others aboard a Mississippi River showboat
called the Cotton Blossom.
   He also recalls sitting in Helen Morgan's dressing room and
gazing at the star's pet goldfish.
   ``She was very nice to me, and I was only 9 or 10 years old at
the time,'' says Hammerstein of the woman who became a Broadway
legend after she sang ``Can't Help Lovin' Dat Man'' and ``Bill'' in
the musical.
   ``But what impressed me the most about the show was Cap'n Andy's
play within the play. It was a little vaudeville piece and a lot of
fun. And of course, I remember `Ol' Man River.' In those days, they
had 16 male singers. That was a lot of sound.''
   Nearly 20 years after the musical's premiere, Hammerstein stood
in the same place backstage at the Ziegfeld and watched the show
again, this time as stage manager of the 1946 revival.
   Today, he's still watching over the show, having directed it in
various revivals all over the country since then. Most recently, he
served as production consultant for an opulent three-hour revival
of the musical taped last summer at the Paper Mill Playhouse in New
Jersey for public television's Great Performances and scheduled for
viewing Friday in most cities.
   Hammerstein is the oldest son of Oscar Hammerstein II, the man
who wrote the book and lyrics _ Jerome Kern did the music _ for
what many people consider the greatest American musical.
   ``I think I'm the only living person who remembers most of the
productions of `Show Boat' and was closely connected with them,''
says the 70-year-old Hammerstein. During his career, he has
produced television specials, worked for various Broadway producers
such as Leland Hayward, and directors such as Joshua Logan and
Garson Kanin, and supervised many other Hammerstein properties.
   The new television production of ``Show Boat'' stars Eddie
Bracken as Cap'n Andy, Rebecca Baxter as Magnolia, Richard White as
Ravenal and Shelly Burch as the doomed Julie LaVerne, the role
originated by Miss Morgan. It's a cast drawn from a wide range of
backgrounds, including opera, Broadway and television.
   ``They're all wonderful,'' Hammerstein says. ``Richard White is
the best Ravenal I've ever seen. What he has that none of the
others did is a kind of humorous approach to the character. He
takes the role seriously. He's amused with Magnolia when he first
meets her and then that amusement becomes affection.
   ``I also love Rebecca Baxter,'' he adds. ``She's young, fresh
and innocent and then in the second act, she takes command, like
she should, as a mature woman.
   ``But the role of Cap'n Andy is the spoke of the wheel. He's the
dynamo, the propeller of the showboat. He holds it together. He's
the most important element in the musical, and Eddie understood
that completely.''
   ``Show Boat'' has had several major revivals in New York over
the years, the last being a version done by the Houston Grand Opera
at the Gershwin Theater in 1983.
   And last year there was renewed interest in the musical with the
release of a complete recording of the show by musical theater
historian and conductor John McGlinn. The recording of more than
three hours of material contains nearly every song written for
``Show Boat,'' both stage and movie versions.
   Hammerstein applauds McGlinn's effort but says a stage version
of ``Show Boat'' with all the cut material reinstated is unwise and
unnecessary.
   ``John has done a great service by doing that record for
students of the theater,'' Hammerstein says. ``But when people of
talent and experience write songs for musical shows and then go on
the road, the idea is to make the show better and better. In the
course of doing that, they will frequently remove some material and
add others.
   ``To suddenly say, `Here are all the songs that were cut from
the show. Aren't they wonderful?' Well, some of them are wonderful,
but they don't belong in the show.''
   The new television version virtually follows the original
staging, says Hammerstein, except for the addition of ``Ah Still
Suits Me,'' a comic duet for Joe and his wife, Queenie. The song
was added to the 1936 movie version for Paul Robeson, who played
Joe.
   Hammerstein is a passionate champion of ``Show Boat.'' It began,
he says, the great age of American musicals, an era that later saw
``Oklahoma!'' and ``Carousel,'' written by his father and Richard
Rodgers. That era continued with Lerner and Loew's ``My Fair Lady''
and may have ended with ``Fiddler on the Roof'' by Jerry Bock and
Sheldon Harnick.
   ``I think `Show Boat' has qualities about it that are lasting,
like some of the great operas,'' he says. ``There was a period when
the French wrote great operas, there was a period when the Italians
wrote great operas, and I think the same thing happened with the
American musical. It came into its own in the 1930s and developed
during the 1940s and 1950s, and in the '60s the musical sort of
faded out.''

   Esther Smith, the girl who sings about ``The Boy
Next Door'' in ``Meet Me in St. Louis,'' was one of the most
sought-after roles of the new Broadway season. And one of the most
difficult to cast.
   ``Impossible to cast,'' insists Jay Binder, a top Broadway
casting agent and the man who helped put the performers on stage in
``Rumors'' and ``Jerome Robbins' Broadway,'' two of last season's
biggest hits.
   ``You have to find someone to play a role that was created
expressly for Judy Garland,'' says Binder, referring to the
legendary singer who was Esther in the memorable 1945 film version.
   ``What you have to do is not even try,'' he says. ``You have to
find someone who can play Esther and not Judy Garland.''
   Louis Burke, producer and director of the lavish musical, goes a
step further.
   ``I was looking for somebody who had her own personality that
would make us forget Garland,'' he says.
   During a 15-month, cross-country expedition, Burke and Binder
saw some 2,500 actresses. They had to listen to what seemed like
never-ending renditions of ``The Boy Next Door,'' ``Have Yourself a
Merry Little Christmas'' and ``The Trolley Song,'' the show's
best-known numbers.
   ``Today, if I hear `The Trolley Song,' I recoil in horror,''
Binder sighs.
   Among the first performers to audition back in June 1988 was a
former Junior Miss runner-up named Donna Kane, best known to New
York audiences as pert, tap-dancing little Ruby in the 1985 revival
of ``Dames at Sea.'' She didn't know it then, but she was Burke's
first choice for the role.
   ``The very first day I saw her, I knew there was a magic there
that was pretty extraordinary,'' Burke says now. ``That was my gut
reaction.
   ``And Donna actually was quite clever. She wore a very lovely
white lace dress with a blue sash around her waist that seemed to
fit the character. It impresses me when people prepare themselves
for auditions.''
   But Burke and Binder felt they had to continue the search,
looking at everyone who wanted to audition. So Kane didn't meet
again with Burke until February, when she auditioned twice more
with a series of different actors being considered for other roles
in the musical.
   ``You do everything over again,'' Kane says now. ``I sang the
same songs. I worked on a few more scenes. I was matched up with
different boys next door, sisters, mothers and fathers.''
   When it finally looked as if the show would arrive late last
season, financial problems forced its postponement until this fall.
   Kane went off to do ``Show Boat'' with the Minnesota Opera and a
successful concert of Rodgers and Hart's ``Babes in Arms'' at
Lincoln Center. When she returned to ``Meet Me in St. Louis,''
there was a fourth audition at the Neil Simon Theater and then a
final audition with Jason Workman, the actor chosen to play John
Truitt, the boy next door.
   ``Sometimes I thought it was really going to happen,'' she
recalls. ``And other times, I would say, `No, you can't count on
things until it is definite.'''
   It became definite only in late summer. Burke picked her to
appear in the musical with George Hearn and Charlotte Moore, who
play her parents, Milo O'Shea, who is her grandfather, and Betty
Garrett, who plays the Irish cook Katie.
   The stage version of ``Meet Me in St. Louis,'' on view at
Broadway's Gershwin Theater, has been trumpeted as a family show,
an old-fashioned American musical, something Broadway hasn't had
for a while. Its songwriters, Hugh Martin and Ralph Blane, have
expanded on their original movie score, adding 10 new songs.
   ``They definitely don't write music like this any more,'' Kane
says. ``The songs have melodies that are not only catchy and
memorable but emotional, too.
   ``There's a whole new bridge section to `The Boy Next Door'
which will be a surprise to people,'' she says. ``And there's a new
duet that Esther and the boy next door sing called `You Are for
Loving.' It's a beautiful melody, with a wonderful counterpoint.''
   ``Meet Me in St. Louis'' is Kane's first chance to originate a
role on Broadway. She had come to New York in 1984 after graduating
from Mount Holyoke as a political science major, but she had two
summers of stock in Vermont while in college.
   ``It's helped me in the theater to have a liberal arts
education,'' she says. ``As an actor, you have to analyze the text
critically. Besides, you can't just focus on the performing arts.''
   Her first job in New York was in a small musical called
``Madison Avenue,'' for which she answered an ad in the trade
papers. The job called for a Seven Sisters graduate and she fit the
bill.
   Next came ``Dames at Sea,'' which kept her occupied for nearly a
year. After that, there were productions of shows like ``My One and
Only'' in suburban New York and New Jersey.
   Kane wasn't idle while she waited for word from Burke and
Binder. She performed in a show in Boston, went on tour with
``Grease'' and moved to England for four months with her husband,
Mark Staples, an oil trader.
   Born in Beacon, N.Y., she was raised on Long Island and New
Jersey. Her parents were in education, not show business.
   ``My grandfather was a singer on the radio in the 1930s and
'40s,'' she says. ``I have his legacy, a piano, which is one of my
most cherished possessions.''
   The best advice Kane ever got from a voice teacher was when she
was 8 years old. The teacher told her mother, ``She's not doing
anything wrong. Leave her alone.''
   ``I was fortunate that I never had a style or technique imposed
on me,'' she says now.
   She doesn't worry about the comparisons to Judy Garland.
   ``I have not watched the movie on purpose during the rehearsal
process,'' she says. ``Growing up, I'd seen it many times, of
course. Some people in the cast have watched the film, others
haven't. But we're not trying to compare ourselves to it.
   ``I'm just trying to concentrate on the character of Esther, not
who played it. She's a very honest and very sincere person and to
be able to produce that vocally as well as act it out is just
great.''

   Campaigning is under way for
Brazil's first presidential election by popular vote in 29 years,
but candidates are concentrating more on clean government than the
country's perilous economic problems.
   On Nov. 15, about 82 million voters will be eligible to pick a
successor to Jose Sarney, the first civilian president since a
military coup in 1964 routed the left-leaning populist Joao
Goulart. Sarney took office as a result of a vote by an electoral
college.
   About 73 percent of the electorate _ Brazilians under the age of
47 _ will be voting directly for a president for the first time in
their lives. Also for the first time, Brazilians as young as 16
will be allowed to vote; about 3.3 million 16- and 17-year-olds
have registered but they are not required by law to vote as are
those 18 and over.
   Brazil is seen by many here and abroad as a nation teetering on
the edge of economic, financial and social chaos and which way it
goes depends heavily on the outcome of the election.
   ``There is a profound revolt against the political, economic and
social system that hasn't been able to meet the people's
expectations,'' said Helio Jaguaribe, director of the Institute of
Political and Social Studies in Rio de Janeiro.
   ``This is the last chance for finding a rational solution. If
the next government cannot deal adequately with this built-up
crisis, the tendency is for the country to degenerate into chaos
and hyperinflation and to become ungovernable.''
   The last presidential election in 1960 saw the election of Janio
Quadros, who served just eight months before resigning in August
1961 and setting off a chain of events that led to the 1964
military takeover.
   Since that time, Brazil has become the Western world's
eighth-largest economy. But its foreign debt has soared from $2
billion to $110 billion _ the largest in the Third World. Its
annual inflation rate has soared to 1,200 percent and the minimum
wage has eroded to the equivalent of $17.50 a week.
   Many Brazilians are dissatisfied with Sarney, a 59-year-old
rancher and poet who has headed the civilian government since a
military regime stepped aside in 1985.
   His leadership is blamed for the soaring inflation and
corruption, which indisputably in Brazilian minds has hit almost
every level of his administration.
   But popular resentment runs deeper.
   ``The powerful sense of opposition in this election is not so
much against Sarney himself as against parties, politicians and the
whole political establishment,'' Jaguaribe said.
   As a result, the candidates focus on change and clean
government. Issues such as how to repay the foreign debt have
become secondary.
   ``I want to rebuild this country stone by stone, brick by
brick,'' front-runner Fernando Collor de Mello said in a recent
campaign speech. Other candidates have made similar promises in
generalized terms.
   Twenty-two candidates are on the ballot.
   Collor de Mello, former governor of the poor northeastern state
of Alagoas and one of Sarney's harshest critics, gained national
attention by firing state employees with exorbitant salaries,
popularly known as ``maharajas.'' Riding a new wave of popularity,
he formed the center-right National Reconstruction Party in 1988
and entered the presidential race.
   ``I will get rid of the `maharajas' of the financial system and
build a new Brazil without inflation, without maharajas and without
corruption,'' he told a recent rally.
   However, Collor de Mello's standing in the polls skidded from 44
percent in August to 34 percent in early October, after the press
published charges of shady financial dealings and political
cronyism in his own administration in Alagoas.
   His closest challenger is Leonel Brizola of the center-left
Democratic Labor Party, a former governor of Rio de Janeiro state
and a backer in the 1960s of Joao Goulart. Because of his
associatons with Goulart, who is now dead, Brizola fled into exile
after the military coup but returned under a 1979 amnesty. He still
faces opposition within the armed forces.
   ``Brizola as president means change,'' he said in a campaign
speech. ``It will be the beginning of the end for the present
economic model of colonial capitalism, which was imposed by the
right and, recently, shoved down our throats by the dictatorship.''
   He scored 14 percent in October's polls.
   Other major candidates:
   _Luis Inacio Lula da Silva of the Marxist-oriented Workers
Party: A congressman and former metalworkers union leader, he says
he would redistribute land and wealth, proposes a suspension of
payments on the foreign debt and calls for an audit of how the
borrowed money was spent. A front-runner early on, the October
polls gave him 9 percent of the vote.
   _Paulo Maluf of the rightist Social Democratic Party: A
millionaire businessman and former governor of Sao Paulo, Maluf
promises law-and-order and public works. He had the backing of the
military in his unsuccessful contest in the electoral college vote
for president in 1985. Polls gave him 8 percent of the vote.
   _Guilherme Afif Domingos of the right-of-center Liberal Party: A
wealthy businessman, banker and congressman from Sao Paulo, Afif
promotes an image as the enlightened pro-business candidate. He
rose sharply in the October polls to 7 percent and gained
nationwide media attention.
   _Ulysses Guimaraes of the Brazilian Democratic Labor Party: The
speaker of Brazil's House of Representatives under Sarney,
Guimaraes for years led the opposition to the military regime. But
his close association with Sarney has hurt his popularity. The
polls gave him 4 percent.
   _Roberto Freire of the Brazilian Communist Party: A congressman
from the northeastern sugar-growing state of Pernambuco, Freire is
an admirer of the policies of Italy's Communist Party, the largest
in the West. But his now-legal party still frightens large numbers
of Brazilians. Polls in October gave him just 1 percent.
   Because Brazil is so large, with population centers widely
scattered, television and radio are playing vital roles in the
campaign. The government has ordered all TV and radio stations to
carry twice-a-day, 70-minute shows devoted to the candidates and
their campaigns.
   About 100 million of Brazil's 145 million people have access to
television and the candidates are concentrating heavily on that
audience.
   The result so far has been mostly vague campaign promises: more
and better housing, schools, transportation and food production _
with few candidates saying specifically how they would bring about
such improvements.
   Few candidates explain in any detail how they would deal with
the economy.
   Collor de Mello says he would cut inflation by ending waste and
by ``privatizing'' government property. But the only government
property he has proposed selling are government mansions in
Brasilia, the capital, now used rent-free by Cabinet ministers.
   The new president is due to take office March 15 for a five-year
term.
   However, Sarney is under pressure to step down soon after the
election, following the example of neighboring Argentina. There,
the outgoing President Raul Alfonsin, scheduled to leave office in
December, handed the presidency to the Peronist Carlos Menem in
July.

   Zaw Ye says he fled to the jungle after
being beaten by soldiers with truncheons in Rangoon and seeing a
young woman who tried to help him pinned to the ground and killed
by a bayonet thrust through her temple.
   Also at the demonstration in the Burmese capital, he said,
another woman student near him was struck in the head and as she
reeled a second blow popped one of her eyes out.
   Zaw Ye and other students then came to a conclusion: ``We
realized that no peaceful protests, debates or strikes would work.
The only course is to resort to arms.''
   He and his companions slipped from Rangoon after that
demonstration in July and joined nearly 5,000 others who had
escaped earlier.
   They are pledged to fight Burma's military government until
democracy is won.
   But democracy appears to have become a distant glimmer for the
millions of Burmese who marched in the streets last year and faced
the blazing guns of soldiers who finally put down the uprising in
September 1988.
   Since then a 17-member junta, the State Law and Order
Restoration Council, has wielded power. It has promised elections
next May and is allowing more than 200 political parties to form,
but it simultaneously has arrested several thousand dissidents and
silenced the main opposition leaders.
   After the council took power, the first wave of about 10,000
protesters, leaving wives and families behind, sought the
protection of ethnic minority rebels along Burma's rugged borders
with Thailand, India and China.
   About half of them returned, however, enticed by a government
promise of amnesty and unable to put up with disease, malnutrition
and other hardships. But the border movement did not falter as some
had predicted.
   The military council initially tried to make amends with an
angry population and refurbish its brutal image internationally. It
allowed the daughter of national hero Aung San to campaign and draw
huge crowds.
   But in late July when protests broke out and speeches by Aung
San's daughter Suu Kyi grew increasingly strident, the military
struck again. She was placed under house arrest and martial law was
tightened. The United States charged that political detainees were
being tortured.
   A second wave of dissidents fled to the frontiers, describing
Rangoon as a prison where people feared the military intelligence
and the nighttime knock on the door.
   The release of Suu Kyi was one of the demands of two
pro-democracy students who hijacked an Burmese airliner to Thailand
with 83 others on board Oct. 6. The students surrendered to Thai
authorities after the Burmese ambassador in Thailand rejected their
demands for a return to democracy.
   Today, the All Burma Students' Democratic Front claims a
membership of more than 4,800 students, young professionals,
Buddhist monks and others at 24 border camps. Compared to a year
ago, they appear to be tougher and better organized but also
largely forgotten by the rest of the world.
   ``We have a rough journey ahead of us,'' said the front's
general secretary, Than Win.
   Some students contrast their own status to that of students who
fled military repression in China in June. The Chinese are given
scholarships at U.S. and other universities and international
platforms to voice their protests. The few Burmese students who
tried have had difficulties entering the United States, and
recently Thailand, eager for economic deals with the Burmese
government, expelled those who had crossed into its territory.
   Life is marginal at camps like the one here at Mawke, a base for
260 students who fight alongside the Karen National Union, one of
many ethnic rebel armies struggling for greater autonomy in Burma.
   Set in a forest near the Thai frontier, the camp is a collection
of crudely fashioned thatch huts, offering little protection from
monsoon rains. Two sleepers must sometimes share one blanket and
there are few mosquito nets. Leaders say 75 percent of the student
soldiers have suffered from malaria; each can obtain only about
$3.50 worth of food rations a month.
   The Karen-trained students at Mawke have only about 100 weapons
of assorted makes and the ammunition they carry most likely would
run out in about 10 minutes of combat. They acknowledge they could
not face a main force Burmese unit without Karen help.
   Student leaders emphasize propaganda work in villages deeper
inside Burma where they claim to be warmly received. Units pass out
leaflets, give talks, entertain and help villagers clear trails,
dig latrines and build small schools.
   An hour's walk from Mawke, the student front has built a school
for its own members. Opened Aug. 1 as the ``Jungle University,''
its staff of teachers and doctors who fled with the students
teaches political science, English, Thai, basic medicine,
agriculture and other subjects.
   The students hope the U.S. Congress will pass legislation that
would provide them up to $2.25 million worth of assistance to
supplement the meager funds they now receive from various Burmese
exile groups and other private donors.
   The United States and much of the inernational community have
shunned Burma politically since last year but the military
government has been able to attract some investors by opening the
country to foreign businessmen for the first time in a quarter
century.
   Critics charge that much of the badly needed foreign currency
being earned goes to buy weapons for the fight against the ethnic
minorities with whom the students are allied.
   Although one Western diplomat based in Rangoon said that ``the
students have been wrecked or driven to the border into
irrelevance,'' other analysts give more balanced assessments and
the student front sees itself at the forefront of the pro-democracy
fight.
   The front's chairman, Htun Aung Kyaw, said that despite the
sweeping arrests of dissidents, the border camps can maintain links
with underground, anti-government cells in Burma. Their own ranks,
he said, could easily be swelled from the interior but this is
discouraged because the camps could not cope with an influx.
   ``We are young, brave and we are not selfish,'' the chairman
added in an interview. ``Students are the only ones the people
trust. We give the people inside courage and can tell the outside
world what is happening in our country.''
   Students have traditionally been at the cutting edge of Burmese
politics and the front hopes to endow itself with the aura of
future leadership.
   Last February, 30 student leaders met to seal their pledge to
end authoritarian rule by drinking drops of their own blood mixed
in a silver cup.
   It was the same ritual Burma's nearly legendary ``Thirty
Comrades'' went through during World War II when they pledged to
liberate the country from the British.

<TEXT>
   
   ``Old Gringo''
   
   Movie-making in the grand tradition returns with ``Old Gringo,''
a richly textured adventure of revolution and passion. It is graced
with a truly magnificent performance by Gregory Peck as the
tormented author-reporter Ambrose Bierce. Unfortunately, the film
is flawed by the ambivalence of a major character and an ending
that dissipates the dramatic values.
   What happened to Bierce, who disappeared during the 1916 Mexican
revolution? The distinguished Mexican author Carlos Fuentes
speculated in his novel ``Gringo Viejo,'' and Aida Bortnik and Luis
Puenzo elaborated on his fable in their screenplay. The story is
fiercely ironic and novelistic, but strangely constructed as a
screen entertainment.
   Most of the excitement is contained in the first third of the
film. Thereafter, it bogs down in a romantic triangle that is
resolved anticlimactically.
   The characters are drawn in bold colors. Jane Fonda is a
Washington spinster who breaks away from her mother's firm control
to work as schoolmarm for rich Mexican landowners. Peck is the
fiery iconoclast Bierce, so depressed by the failure of his
literary career that he courts death amid the violence of the
revolution. A bold lieutenant of Pancho Villa, Jimmy Smits (``L.A.
Law'') is a fearless leader of the peasant uprising.
   Fonda arrives at the landowners' compound to find it under siege
by the peasant army, the owners having fled. She stays on, in
sympathy with the peasants' cause and awed by the powerful
personalities of the revolutionary leader and the sardonic
journalist. Both seek her virginity, Peck hesitantly, Smits with
passion.
   Luis Puenzo, whose admirable Argentine-made ``The Official
Story'' won the 1986 Academy Award as best foreign language film,
deftly interprets the human relationships. He also handles action
with skill; the siege of the compound is worthy of John Ford. But
it happens early in the movie.
   The rest of the film is devoted to the moral dilemma of the
revolutionary. The bastard son of the landowner, he struggles like
a rough-hewn Hamlet over whether to claim his heritage or join
Villa as ordered. When he finally makes up his mind, he reacts with
senseless violence.
   The best element of ``Old Gringo'' is Peck in the title role. It
is fascinating to watch an old pro in the peak of form, playing a
character who befits his stature. Jane Fonda, whose company made
the film, registers strongly after she abandons her wide-eyed
wonder. Jimmy Smits, despite his character's indecision,
establishes himself as a big-screen star.
   The Columbia Pictures' release was produced by Lois Bonfiglio,
with David Wisnievitz as executive producer. Rating is R for
language, violence and a bedroom scene. Running time: 119 minutes.

   ``Thelonious Monk: Straight, No Chaser''
   
   Thelonious Sphere Monk lived up to his name. He practiced
ascetism in his spareness with words and notes.
   A documentary about the jazz composer and pianist _ ``Thelonious
Monk: Straight, No Chaser'' _ respects that spareness by focusing
on Monk's legacy to American music, the joy he took in creating a
new kind of jazz.
   This is no artsy movie filled with chitchat about Monk and how
he was such a mysterious character and how he revolutionized jazz
and all that. It doesn't dispel all of the mystery his persona
projected, but it does allow us to listen to a lot of his music and
to realize his genius.
   If Monk wasn't much interested in making small talk or even
communicating with those around him, it's clear he was absorbed in
his musical world.
   ``I mean it is hard work to play those 88'' piano keys, Monk
tells some reporter type who asks a dumb question about whether the
piano has enough keys.
   As a documentary, ``Straight, No Chaser'' (also the name of a
famous Monk tune) suffers from a lack of good footage. The early
years are shown in a succession of stills that don't tell much
except that Monk was a revolutionary who wore suits and ties.
   However, it's sheer pleasure to watch and listen to duo piano
performances by Tommy Flanagan and Barry Harris that underline the
beauty of Monk's music.
   Tenor saxophonist Charlie Rouse, who played with Monk for more
than a decade, says that ``Thelonius was like a founder. ... he
laid down the foundation'' of modern jazz, called bebop in the
beginning.
   Fortunately, in 1967 West German television commissioned
documentary filmmaker Michael Blackwood to do a cinema verite
special on Monk. The 14 hours of film from that one-time broadcast
forms the basis of much of the film; unfortunately, too much of
that footage is shots of Monk and his family and fellow musicians
in airports and hotels.
   To the stock footage, co-producers Charlotte Zwerin (who also
directed) and Bruce Ricker added interviews with Monk's longtime
associate, tenor saxophonist Charlie Rouse; his son, Thelonius Monk
Jr.; and his longtime manager, Harry Colomby. Clint Eastwood, a
lifelong jazz lover, is executive producer for the Warner Bros.
release. Rated PG-13.

   ``Checking Out'' (Virgin Vision. VHS-Beta, $89.95. Rated R)
   
   Ray Macklin is perfectly healthy but obsessed with the certainty
he's about to die. His pursuit of an illness to cure makes
``Checking Out'' very funny and very strange, just right for a
night at home.
   Jeff Daniels, with his classic good looks, is wonderful as
Macklin, whose life is thrown off kilter when his jokester pal
drops dead at a barbecue just before telling the punchline.
   Macklin's maudlin attitude hits his wife, Jenny (Melanie
Mayron), whom he virtually ignores except to tell her not to use
salt, and his boss (Michael Tucker), who suddenly is faced with a
crazed employee.
   The boss tries to calm Macklin with such words of wisdom about
his friend's death as: ``It's the hotel of life. You check out and
they come and make up the room.''
   When Macklin actually faces death, he imagines a heaven that
looks like a tacky beach resort and offers all the freedom of a
strict grammar school.
   Jokes about death pervade the movie, and if they are a bit
off-putting at the start, they become endearing and actually in the
end serve to celebrate the joy of life.
   The acting is fine, with everyone treating the bizarre material
as if it was most ordinary. Careful viewers can catch David Byrne
of the Talking Heads in a small role as a bartender.
   ``Checking Out'' was written by Joe Eszterhas (``Flashdance''
and ``Jagged Edge'') and directed by David Leland (``Wish You Were
Here'').

   ``Say Anything'' (CBS-Fox Video. VHS-Beta, $89.98. Rated PG-13)
   
   In ``Say Anything,'' a pair of blushing teen-agers fall ... oh,
don't say it, ummm, well ... really? No? Really? Oh, I'm so happy!
I love you, too!
   It's that kind of movie. It's predictable. But it's tender. And
it accurately captures those awkward, lovely, painful moments of
being both in love and a teen-ager.
   The story centers on Lloyd (John Cusack), a likeable guy who is
a little low on ambition, and Diane Court (Ione Skye), school
valedictorian, hyper-achiever and a striking beauty. Lloyd's pals
call her ``a brain, a brain trapped in the body of a game show
hostess.''
   The romance would flourish if weren't for Diane's
over-protective father. When dad asks about Lloyd's goal in life,
Lloyd says point-blank that it's to spend as much time possible
with his daughter.
   Cameron Crowe, who wrote ``Fast Times at Ridgemont High,'' makes
his directing debut with ``Say Anything'' and wonderfully captures
off-beat and witty nuances of teen tribulations.
   There is, for instance, Lloyd's friend who wrote 65 songs about
her boyfiend Joe _ who dumped her. In another scene, Lloyd gets an
earful of advice from the boys hanging out a convenience store
parking lot. That leads Lloyd to ask them why, if they know so much
about women, are they at a Gas-n-Sip on a Saturday night.
   The big flaw is an annoying competitive sub-plot concerning
Diane's father, who is in trouble with the Internal Revenue
Service. It nags on the main plot of the struggling romance like a
bad habit.
   But love endures and this charming film overcomes its plot
problems to leave viewers feeling warm and fuzzy, but hardly
surprised.

   ``Raw Like Sushi'' (Virgin) _ Neneh Cherry
   
   In the post-Madonna era, dance-oriented female singers seem a
dime a dozen. But newcomer Neneh Cherry seems to have the talent to
stand out in the crowd.
   The young London-based singer's ``Raw Like Sushi'' is a fresh
mix of pop, rap and house music with a bravado sure to appeal to
girls growing up in a changing world.
   The debut album has a shimmering urban sound, firmly
contemporary but avoiding the cliches that are rife in this genre.
Cherry samples a variety of ``found sounds,'' such as Malcolm
McLaren's ``Buffalo Girls'' on her own ``Buffalo Stance'' and
Stevie Wonder's ``Living for the City.''
   Cherry, herself a mother, sternly defends the rights of children
on ``The Next Generation.'' She calls on fathers to stand up for
their parental responsibilities and society to fix crumbling school
systems.
   ``What's this sitting on my lap?'' she asks. ``It's the next
generation.''
   ``Buffalo Stance'' is already a hit and ``Kisses on the Wind''
is high on the charts now, both deservedly so. ``Manchild,'' a
ballad with a combination of singing and rapping, and the
tough-minded ``Heart'' are both noteworthy.
   Cherry is a serviceable singer but an even better rapper, with a
sassy style.
   If she's not yet ready to challenge Madonna for her crown, at
least Cherry can keep the blond one company on the charts for
awhile.

   Missa Prolationum, Marian Motets by Johannes Ockeghem; The
Hilliard Ensemble (EMI)
   
   Little is known about Johannes Ockeghem, 1420-1477. He spent
much of his adult life serving the kings of France, and achieved a
lofty reputation among musicians of the day and in later centuries.
Ockeghem's total known output consists of 20 chansons, 12 masses,
three partial masses and a handful of motets.
   He also came to have the reputation of dry academician because
of his mastery of composition. The beauty of this Mass shows
clearly the opposite, especially with the feeling interpretation by
the Hilliard Ensemble, made up of two altos, three tenors, a
baritone and two basses.
   The Missa Prolationum, perhaps Ockeghem's greatest work, is a
landmark: the first mass to use a canon, or successively repeated
melody, in all its parts. Paired, or individual, voices sing the
same melody but in different meters and intervals.
   In the bigger picture of music history, Ockeghem represents a
new kind of musical thinking, a departure from the idea of a basic
melody around which music is constructed, and a move towards using
an idea-generating theme that unifies an entire piece's development.
   The performance here is just right. The atmosphere is
other-worldly and serene, but not cold. The singers are absolutely
precise in their joint entrances and phrase-endings. Chords burst
forth like a flood of light through a cathedral's rose window, and
solo voices weave a tapestry of sound. One minor caveat: Perhaps
because of the recording conditions, sybillant consonants seem to
jump out of the texture, creating a distracting effect.

   The San Diego Museum of Art will have the
largest collection of Imperial eggs on exhibit since the Russian
Revolution of 1917 as part of the Soviet Arts Festival.
   The ornate, jewel-encrusted eggs, crafted by Peter Carl Faberge,
are coming to San Diego from all over the world: the Forbes
magazine collection, Queen Elizabeth II, the New Orleans Museum of
Art, the Cleveland Museum of Art. Eight eggs from the Kremlin's
Armory Museum have never before been exhibited in the United States.
   The only egg based in San Diego is the diamond-studded Pine Cone
Egg, on loan from John Kroc, owner of the San Diego Padres and
widow of the founder of the McDonald's hamburger chain.
   The Faberge eggs mirrored the excess of the Russian Imperial
Court. The first egg was commissioned by Czar Alexander III who
gave it to his wife, Marie Feodorovna on Easter morning in 1885.
The white egg opened to reveal a golden yolk, a gold chicken and a
ruby egg.
   About 55 Imperial eggs were made until 1916, but only 43 are
known to still exist.
   Quilts, scrimshaw and decoys were once considered homey
additions to everyday life. Now they're known as folk art.
   Decorative figures, weathervanes, whirligigs, farm tools,
architecture, toys, household goods and trade signs help make the
folk art exhibit at the New York Historical Society a treat and
celebrates the craftsmanship and genius of our ancestors.
   The show, ``An American Sampler: Folk Art From the Shelburne
Museum,'' features more than 120 works from the Vermont museum's
Americana collection, and runs through Jan. 7.
   Oct. 15 marks the official opening of Meseo Chicano, billed as
Arizona's first Hispanic museum. Founded by Chicanos Por La Causa,
a community development corporation, the new museum opens with
``Arte, Sweat and Tears.'' The show features work of Arizona
Hispanic artists and of Mexican painter Jose Luis Cuevas and runs
through Jan. 15.

   They come from different backgrounds a
generation apart, but Gregory Peck and Jimmy Smits have one thing
in common: They both suffer stage fright.
   Peck gets stage fright after 45 years in films?
   ``I always do,'' confesses the 73-year-old star who portrays the
iconoclastic author Ambrose Bierce in ``Old Gringo,'' co-starring
with Jane Fonda and Smits.
   ``When I went down to rehearse in Mexico, I was playing catchup,
because originally Burt Lancaster was to play the role. They were
already rehearsing, and Jane knew all of her lines backwards,
forwards and sideways, while I was carrying a script in my hand.
When we first rehearsed a scene, she embraced me. Her tears were
flowing, and I was trying to hold onto my script,'' Peck said.
   ``Jane was totally into the scene, and I was about 8,000 miles
behind. I had a bit of stage fright the first day or two. That
happens with every movie. Nothing unusual about that.''
   Smits, 33, had more reason to be nervous. He was making the leap
from TV's ``L.A. Law'' to a $24 million epic with two screen
legends.
   ``I would be lying to you if I said I wasn't nervous the first
couple of days of shooting,'' he said.
   ``Besides the fact that I was working with Jane Fonda and
Gregory Peck, on the first couple of days I was involved in an
exterior scene that had 150 extras. I was on a horse, carrying a
rifle and I spoke in two different languages. It was an exercise in
shifting lots of gears at the same time.
   ``I went home that first night and I cried a little bit, because
I didn't think I was up to spec. But they liked what I did.''
   Peck speaks well of his young co-star: ``Jimmy is well-trained
and schooled, holds a master's degree from Cornell (University) in
fine arts, has worked with Joe Papp, has done Shakespeare in the
Park, has done the classics. He's studied voice, he's studied
movement, he's a trained young artist. He's ready for bigger
things. He's wonderful in `L.A. Law,' but he's going to be a movie
star.''
   Peck grew up in idyllic La Jolla, Calif., the lonely son of a
divorced druggist. He became interested in acting while studying
pre-med at the University of California, Berkeley. He later went
East to study at the Neighborhood Playhouse. After a few stage
roles, he was signed to contracts with Fox, MGM, Selznick and RKO
and became an instant star. A host of memorable roles followed,
``To Kill a Mocking Bird'' winning him the Academy Award in 1962.
   Peck's film roles have been sparse in recent years, but he
welcomed the challenge of playing the enigmatic Bierce, who wrote
``The Devil's Dictionary.''
   ``He was pretty much a misanthrope,'' the actor said. ``I think
that he had great love for his family and treated them badly and
knew that he had. I think he had great remorse about the shambles
of his personal life. Also, he was disappointed and disillusioned
by the failure of his 12-volume collected works.
   ``It was in that rather gloomy mood that he decided first to go
on a nostalgic tour of the Civil War battlefields in Tennessee
where he fought as a young man; he was born in 1840. Then on to El
Paso, and he decided, `Well, it's not to late for excitement.' He
decided to join the Pancho Villa revolution. He got as far as
Chihuahua, bought a white horse and set off across the desert in
search of a band of revolutionaries. He disappeared from the face
of the Earth.''
   ``Old Gringo'' is based on the Carlos Fuentes novel that
fictionizes Bierce's fate. The director is Argentine Luis Puenzo,
whose ``The Official Story'' won an Oscar.
   Peck has no plans to heat up his film career.
   ``I'm working as much as I like,'' he commented. ``I don't want
to do, if I can avoid it, anything mediocre. It's kind of unseemly
at my age to come out in a turkey. So I'm just going to sit back.
   ``My wife and I are globetrotters; we get around a lot. I've had
fun the last couple of weeks. At the house I've had a stonemason, a
painter, a plumber who's got to come back ... also a tree surgeon.
I like that kind of thing: nest-building.
   ``I've got four kids who are all doing interesting things,'' he
said. ``One son is a banker and a free-fall parachute jumper,
another is making a documentary right now in Afghanistan and
Vietnam. My daughter is appearing with the Martha Graham dance
company in New York and my son Anthony has just sold a screenplay
to Fox. I follow all of them with great interest, and it's probably
the most fun I have.''
   Smits came from a different background. He was born in
Manhattan, son of a Puerto Rican mother and a father from Suriname.
He was one of three children of a family of ``lower-middle-class
laborers.''
   ``We moved around a lot when I was young,'' he recalled. ``That
had something to do with my becoming an actor. I didn't have a lot
of lasting friendships. I played a lot by myself. I made-believe a
lot. I think that was where the (acting) germ was planted. Along
the way there were people who influenced me to continue my
education if I was interested in theater.
   ``The fascinating thing is that in acting on any given day you
can be a king or a beggar. I found that I could channel my energy
into research. I was never a very good student, but when it related
to a role, I could spend hours in the library researching 18th
century England or Mexico.''
   Besides New York plays, Smits appeared in the films ``Running
Scared'' and ``The Believers,'' then was cast as the dedicated
lawyer Victor Sifuentes in ``L.A. Law.'' That, he admitted,
accelerated his career.
   ``In terms of notoriety and success as an actor, most
definitely,'' he said. ``I had been working a lot off-Broadway and
in regional theater, but `L.A. Law' was really a turning point, and
a good one.''

<HEAD>The Artists: Met Soprano Opts for Motherhood</HEAD>

   Metropolitan Opera soprano Dawn Upshaw's next
production will be a baby.
   She once watched a TV program in which baritone Robert Merrill
interviewed renowned sopranos who have sung ``Tosca'' and recalls
that several said they decided not to have children because it
would interrupt their careers.
   But Upshaw, who is married to musicologist Michael Nott, always
wanted a family and is expecting her baby in November. ``I think
that has always been first and will always come first. I'm not
really as eager to get out there to do as much as I can and sing in
every country.''
   She thinks maybe in 10 years she'll even stop traveling to sing
and start teaching.
   Though her husband travels with her, visiting libraries and
writing wherever they are, they're both ready to go home after six
or seven weeks away from their apartment near Lincoln Center.
   Without trying too hard to sing abroad, though, Upshaw receives
engagements. She sang Pamina in ``The Magic Flute'' with the
Netherlands Opera last fall and was engaged for her debut in
Frankfurt and Vienna next fall, singing Pamina. ``I'm glad to get
to these two cities,'' Upshaw says. ``They're important opera
houses. It'll be easy traveling with a baby. I want to take
advantage of traveling while it's easier.''
   Her last long performing trip was seven weeks in
Aix-en-Provence, France, singing Despina in ``Cosi fan tutti.'' She
also sang Pamina, while six months pregnant.
   ``By that time I was feeling a fair amount of movement,'' she
said. ``At one point I was sort of thrown down on the floor as I
was singing Pamina. I supported myself well with my hands on the
way down. I had to lie there several seconds. The baby would always
kick. `Get off of me!'''
   A month later she sang Susanna in ``The Marrige of Figaro'' at
Wolftrap in Virginia.
   ``It's her wedding day. She's not supposed to be pregnant,''
Upshaw says. So the company padded her into general plumpness. In
September she went to the Midwest to sing a concert with the
Minnesota Orchestra, a recital at Illinois Wesleyan University in
Bloomington, Ill., her alma mater, and at a friend's wedding.
   After college, where she concentrated on concert and recital
work more than opera, her teacher (and father of her now husband),
David Nott, suggested she audition for New York voice teacher Ellen
Faull. She did and entered the Manhattan School of Music as a Faull
pupil.
   ``I still study with her. I can take anything to her that I'm
concerned about and trust her opinion probably more than my own,''
Upshaw said.
   Faull's suggestion was that Upshaw enter the Metropolitan Opera
Auditions for Young Singers so that one of the judges, who runs the
Met's young artists development program, would hear her. The
strategy worked. In the 1984-85 season, Upshaw was taken into the
program, which yearly puts half a dozen fledgling singers on the
Met stage in small roles, training them for major parts.
   Upshaw's Met debut was as Countess Ceprano in ``Rigoletto.''
   ``She's a flirt who has about two lines. She flirts with the
Duke a little bit in the opening scene. Then her husband comes in
and she's sent home.''
   She sang five roles that season and remembers best one
performance as the fifth serving woman in ``Elektra.''
   ``I loved that music,'' she said. ``I had several pages by
myself. It was really exciting.'' She was ``covering'' that part,
meaning that she went on if the scheduled singer fell ill.
   In her second season she sang Barbarina in ``The Marriage of
Figaro.''
   ``That was an important step forward for me,'' Upshaw said.
``She has a little aria by herself. There was more dramatic work on
stage. It was really my first time spent with (Met artistic
director) James Levine. I think, thanks to Barbarina, he had enough
confidence in me to offer other interesting roles. He brought my
singing to the public a little sooner than it would otherwise have
been brought.''
   The biggest part she has had at the Met was the female lead,
Adina, in ``The Elixir of Love'' two seasons ago.
   ``I was covering Kathy Battle for a run of four,'' Upshaw said.
``She canceled all of them, the first one an hour before it began.
I was singing a smaller part in the opera. I was leaving the
apartment when I got a phone call saying she was sick and I would
have to go on.
   ``I remember trying to switch gears to the lead. It was really
terrifying. Some people thrive on that sort of thing. Their
adrenaline gets going and they're very animated and comfortable.
Not having ever walked on the set before that night, not having
sung any bit of it with the orchestra _ I don't want to do that
again. I was not loose and carefree. I was definitely stiff and
nervous.
   ``Everything turned out OK, especially by the third or fourth
performance.''
   This season at the Met, Upshaw will sing Zerlina in ``Don
Giovanni,'' starting in March.
   ``I was supposed to sing Despina, too, in January,'' she said.
``I recently pulled out. I wanted to give myself more time after
the baby. They were nice about it. People are very understanding
when it's a baby.''

<HEAD>Music Makers: Confusing Texas</HEAD>

   A Scottish band called ``Texas'' is bound to
cause some confusion. First of all, the group's name comes from the
film ``Paris, Texas,'' not the state.
   Also, their music shows no trace of Scottish roots, drawing
instead on the folk and blues of such Americans as Ry Cooder and
Elmore James.
   That's one reason their debut album, ``Southside,'' took so long
to make. As singer Sharleen Spiteri explained, finding a producer
capable of understanding the viewpoints of four determined young
musicians was nearly impossible.
   ``We had the songs arranged for a long time and we really just
needed someone to get us in the mood,'' said Spiteri, 21, ``but the
producers always wanted to add a few keyboards or even a saxophone.
   ``We just believed in our sound. We were very stubborn. We
welcomed suggestions, but there were too many people. It becomes
the producer and record company on one side, and the band on the
other. It's like a conveyor belt: `OK, this band won't get a record
so we'll go the next band.'''
   Texas, Spiteri explained, is willing to take orders, but only if
you ask nicely. The members prefer sitting down and discussing
ideas, coming to decisions that reflect everyone's input.
   ``It's a lot different from one person,'' Spiteri said. ``With
four people you get different ideas, you get some interesting
conversations. Maybe they'll change my mind on bits and pieces,
maybe I'll change theirs. It's good we are a band that's able to
talk.''
   They know how fortunate they are to just have a record. Growing
up in Glasgow, unemployment was a stubborn fact of life from which
music provided a cherished escape.
   ``I came out of school and luckily enough got a job as a
hairdresser,'' Spiteri said.
   ``I started off with just a Saturday job and then managed to get
full-time work. A lot of people thought because I had such a secure
job, one that a lot of people in Scotland would give their right
arm for, I was crazy to give it up for a career in music.''
   ``My dad's unemployed,'' guitarist Ally McErlaine said.
``Because of the class structure and everything, it's geared to
keeping the working classes down and stopping people from getting
anywhere. You can't get a good job. But for playing in a band, we
didn't have to have any sort of background.''
   Texas was formed in the spring of 1987 when a friend introduced
Spiteri to bassist John McElhone. They quickly wrote ``I Don't Need
a Lover,'' the album's first single, which opens with a slide
guitar influenced by Cooder's soundtrack for ``Paris, Texas.''
   ``A lot of the people think the album's about old
relationships,'' said Spiteri, who cited Linda Ronstadt and Patsy
Cline as influences.
   ```I Don't Want a Lover' is male-female, but it's also about
everything that's happened to us, the high unemployment in
Scotland, the fact a lot of our family and friends are unemployed.''
   Getting a record deal was, surprisingly, the easy part for
Texas, who now had McErlaine and drummer Stuart Kerr aboard. The
band signed with Phonogram in England. But making the album was an
unwelcome lesson in the blues, starting when the young group headed
for America to work with producer Bernard Edwards, the former
bassist for Chic.
   ``It never got very far,'' Spiteri said. ``We worked for a month
and it was still very basic. We came back very upset. We were
thinking how we spent so much money and so much time.''
   They eventually hooked up with Tim Palmer, who had produced
former Led Zeppelin singer Robert Plant among others.
   ``It was quite a relief,'' McErlaine said. ``We were getting on
well and he was bringing more out of it. He just let us do our
thing. There were a lot of battles working with other producers and
we knew we had to try someone else.''
   Everyone contributes to the songs, usually written around a
guitar riff or bass pattern.
   ``Ally will make changes and maybe I'll change something and
from that point we'll rehearse it and see what happens,'' Spiteri
said. ``Over the past 2{ years, all the things that have happened
forced us to put them into the songs. The feelings brought on by
all the producers and studios rubbed off.''
   ``Prayer for You,'' ``Faith'' and ``The Future Is Promises'' all
reflect the group's struggle to make the record. McErlaine called
that spirit a product of their upbringing, the determination to
work hard and not compromise.
   Spiteri talked of ``Prayer for You'' and its words of
encouragement: ``I could never watch you suffer, I could never let
you down. And I hope you soon discover, all the truth that I've now
found.''
   ```Prayer for You' was the last song we wrote for the album,''
the singer recalled. ``It was a very basic acoustic guitar and
vocal that we took it into the studio and jammed on. Everything
came out on it, it was a relief.
   ``Everything was coming to a head at that point. We had people
saying, `Oh God, are they going to do it?' You felt that everybody
was thinking, `Can these people work with anyone else?' All these
people were coming in with ideas. But it's not their record, it's
ours.''

<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Who was Robert Jay Mathews, the white supremacist
who declared war on the United States and led a major terrorist
campaign throughout the American West?
   Kevin Flynn and Gary Gerhardt spent four years tracking his
movements and those of his four dozen followers, and pieced
together a written patchwork quilt that provides some insight into
this group and its activities.
   Their book, ``The Silent Brotherhood,'' published by MacMillan
Inc., is more than a chronology of events that includes the slaying
of Denver radio talk show host Alan Berg in a burst of machine-gun
fire in 1984.
   It explores the underground group's thinking, way of life and
the passions that drove followers to rob armored cars, blow up
churches and take on the U.S. government, which they branded the
``Zionist Occupation Government,'' or ZOG for short.
   It's a tale of bravado and intrigue, murder and passion.
   It also details one of the widest, most expensive criminal
investigations since the Patty Hearst case. By the time it ended,
there were 75 arrests in related cases and five deaths.
   Flynn and Gerhardt, reporters for the Rocky Mountain News, said
the Silent Brotherhood took its name from a poem in a history of
Adolf Hitler's dreaded Wafen SS. The Silent Brotherhood laid
elaborate plans to sabotage dams, water supplies, utilities and
communications lines. Its goal was to transform five Western states
into an Aryan Nation, free of black and Jewish influence.
   To finance their plan, members robbed two banks in Washington
and launched a career of armored car heists that spread to
California.
   They set up a ``doomsday'' assassination squad. If the group was
attacked by authorities, it planned to track and kill statesman
Henry Kissinger, banker David Rockefeller and the heads of the
three television networks, all of whom were perceived as enemies
because they were either Jewish or worked for Jews.
   To prove their resolve, they decided to send a message. On June
18, 1984, they stalked and killed Berg outside his Denver home.
Berg was killed because he was Jewish and because he frequently
attacked group members on his radio program with his acid-tongued
wit.
   The funds from their robberies grew, and included $3.8 million
netted in a bold daylight highway robbery near Ukiah, Calif. This
money was to be shared with other right-wing groups in the United
States, including the Carolina Knights of the KKK in North
Carolina, the Texas Klan, the White Aryan Resistance in California,
and the white supremacist group Aryan Nations.
   The group made a major mistake by leaving behind a gun during a
California heist, and FBI agents tracked Mathews to a home near
Seattle, where he died in a hail of gunfire and flames during a
36-hour standoff.
   The story doesn't end there. In July 1986 at the Aryan World
Congress, Mathews and his followers were honored with medals that
read, ``Should you fall, my friend, another friend will emerge from
the shadows to take your place.''
   In September 1986, a string of bombings took place in Coeur
d'Alene, Idaho, by a group calling itself the Silent Brotherhood
Strike Force II.
   Among those who provided information to the authors were Bruce
Pierce, now serving time in an Illinois prison, who was convicted
in November 1987 of violating Alan Berg's civil rights by killing
him, and Zillah Craig, Mathew's lover who is now raising his
daughter.
   The book is remarkable for its details on groups that pride
themselves on secrecy. However, it still fails to resolve the one
central question, ``Why did they do it?''
   The authors attempt to explain it as part of the ``mountain
man'' mystique and frontier spirit of the Old West, but that fails
to explain the vast allure of groups such as these in the South,
with deep roots in the Civil War.
   Flynn and Gerhardt acknowledge they are not psychologists, but
say they wanted to provide some insight into why racists belong to
such groups.
   ``It's simplistic and easy to put these guys in a jar on a shelf
called nuts and not worry about it,'' Gerhardt said. ``These were
real people not a whole lot different than we are. The difference
is how they carried it out.''
   Flynn said all supremacist groups have several things in common,
such as a charismatic leader, what they view as a superpatriotic
attitude and a shared goal of restoring the United States, not
destroying it.
   In the end, the best clue to the thinking of such groups comes
from Mathews himself, who cheated the FBI out of a chance for
interrogation by choosing death.
   Shortly before he died, Mathews gathered the group together and
asked them to sign a declaration of war against society:
   ``We, the following, being of sound mind and under no duress, do
hereby sign this document of our own free will, stating
forthrightly and without fear that we declare ourselves to be in
full and unrelenting state of war with those forces seeking and
consciously promoting the destruction of our faith and our race.''
   While facing dozens of heavily armed agents, holed up in a house
with a small armory, Mathews was asked what it would take for him
to surrender.
   ``I want parts of eastern Washington, Idaho and Montana set
aside as an Aryan homeland,'' he said.
   In his suicide note, Mathews could only muse as to why the white
FBI agents could turn against one of their own race. It serves as
an epitaph for his paramilitary organization, betrayed in the end
to federal agents by two of his own men.
   ``White men killing white men, Saxon killing Dane;
   ``When will it end? The Aryan's bane?''

<HEAD>Dollar Mostly Lower, Pound Drops, Gold Little Changed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar was mostly lower in early European
trading today, but gained more than 2 cents against the British
pound.
   Gold prices were little changed.
   Currency dealers said trading was quiet because of the Columbus
Day holiday in the United States, and because Canadian financial
institutions were closed for that country's Thanksgiving holiday.
   Dealers said the market is trying to find new direction after
European interest rate hikes, central bank interventions and
weaker-than-expected September U.S. job figures all failed to take
the dollar much lower.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar fell 0.22 yen to a closing 142.23 yen. Later, in
London, it was quoted at 142.65 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Friday's
rates, included: 1.8862 West German marks, down from 1.8880; 1.6450
Swiss francs, up from 1.6435; 6.3955 French francs, down from
6.4035; 2.1333 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1350; 1,378.38 Italian
lire, down from 1,380.25; 1.1750 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1760.
   In London, the pound fell. It cost $1.5815 to buy one pound,
compared with $1.6030 late Friday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $363.50 a troy ounce,
compared with late Friday's $363.25. At midmorning, the city's five
major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $362.95.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $363.00, up from $362.80 late
Friday.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $5.13 a troy
ounce, down from Friday's $5.14.
   Financial institutions in Hong Kong were closed today because of
the Chinese Chung Yeung or Grave Sweeping Festival.

   IBM is offering early retirement to 1,000 of its
employees; Borden's plan to reorganize its dairy operations will
cost 7,000 jobs, and the megabuyout of RJR Nabisco will result in
more than 1,600 layoffs.
   Business optimism appears to be dimming, and manufacturers are
becoming more aggressive in cutting costs and people. But a
relatively steady unemployment rate _ which has fluctuated between
5.1 percent and 5.3 percent since April _ means somebody is hiring.
   The question is, who?
   Steven Haugen, an economist with the Bureau of Labor Statistics,
says job growth is concentrated in the service sector, that broad,
amorphous category covering everything from data processing to
theme parks to the neighborhood beauty parlor. Experts say this
sector is creating upwards of 1.5 million jobs a year.
   ``Services is very labor intensive, so it's sucking up all the
workers,'' said John Hekman, a senior economist at the Claremont
Economics Institute in Claremont, Calif.
   In September alone, when the loss of 103,000 manufacturing jobs
inched the unemployment rate up 0.1 percent to 5.3 percent, service
industries added 317,000 jobs. A closer look, however, shows
teachers returning to their classrooms and the ending of a
telephone workers strike were responsible for much of the job
increase.
   But economists point to health care providers, temporary help
agencies, hotels and the entertainment industry as being among the
most consistent ``net adders'' of employees.
   The health care industry is growing at just under 10 percent a
year, said Geoffrey Fenton, a spokesman for Baxter International, a
major medical supplies manufacturer in Deerfield, Ill.
   Baxter added 2,400 jobs in 1988, and Fenton said the payroll
continues to grow this year. Revenue grew 10 percent last year, and
sales were up significantly so far this year, he said.
   Orders to the 6,000 to 7,000 hospitals Baxter supplies are
increasing as an aging population requires more medical care. But
the fastest growing area of new business for Baxter lies in the
sale of ``alternate-site'' products, like intravenous solutions and
dialysis items used at home and in nursing homes. Overall
outpatient care is growing at the rate of about 20 percent
annually, said Hekman.
   On the temporary help scene, Manpower Inc. Chief Executive
Mitchell Fromstein characterized growth as ``meteoric'' over the
last five years. Since the beginning of this year, Fromstein said
Manpower's permanent staff has increased by 1,000 employees.
   ``We're increasing the number of offices we operate by 10
percent a year, and we will do at least that going forward,'' he
said from the company's headquarters in Milwaukee.
   ``We're adding more offices because we can do more business,''
said Fromstein, who noted that the number of people employed
temporarily has tripled since 1982.
   On the entertainment and recreation front, the theme park
business is hot. Walt Disney Co. has added about 4,000 people to
its payroll with the opening of three new attractions at Disney
World in Orlando, Fla. _ Disney-MGM Studios, Typhoon Lagoon water
park and a nighttime entertainment section, said spokesman Erwin
Okun.
   In addition to hiring people to staff the new attractions, Okun
said, increased attendance _ bolstered by an influx of foreign
tourists flush with cash thanks to favorable exchange rates _ has
spurred Disney to create new jobs.
   MCA Inc. is investing $600 million in a Universal Studios movie
park that will compete directly with Disney when it opens in the
spring.
   On the West Coast, MGM Grand Inc. announced plans this month to
build a $700 million movie theme park in Las Vegas that will employ
7,000 people when it opens, tentatively in late 1992.
   The lodging industry is also expanding nationwide. In the 12
months ended in June, 60,000 new hotel jobs had been created,
Hekman said.
   Hyatt Corp., the Chicago-based hotel chain, is adding 3,000
positions this year because of expansion and acquisitions, said
spokeswoman Carrie Reckert.
   Although the loss of manufacturing jobs concerns many
economists, in part because service sector jobs tend to pay less
than industrial work, others don't see this as a severe problem.
They say the manufacturing process has become more efficient and
fewer workers are required.
   ``We shouldn't be concerned if manufacturing is not growing
because we're having a 5 percent (annual) increase in output per
worker,'' Hekman said.
   But the service sector has shown very little productivity gains,
``so as the economy grows, we're moving people out of
high-productivity areas and moving them into the services,'' he
said.

   The largest decline in payrolls at auto plants

   Share prices were lower at midday Monday, as
investors were unnerved by weakness in the pound just days after

<TEXT>
   The Anglo-French consortium which is building the
31-mile rail tunnel under the English Channel said Monday it will
cost substantially more to build the link between England and
France.
   The consortium Eurotunnel said the tunnel would cost 7 billion
pounds, (about $11 billion), or 44 percent more than predicted two
years ago, largely because of higher than anticipated costs for
rail cars.
   Eurotunnel Co-chairman Alastair Morton said last week that the
group would have to raise more funds to meet the higher costs, and
that it was embroiled in a cost dispute with its major contractor
Transmanche-Link, which was pegging costs between 5 percent and 10
percent higher.
   Morton said Monday he was sure those difficulties would be
sorted out and that talks with TML were polite and constructive,
contrary to weekend reports that suggested otherwise.
   ``There is no longer a question of should the project be built.
It's going ahead,'' the co-chairman said. ``We would never request
government assistance and their answer would be `no' anyway.''
   Eurotunnel said it raised its revenue projections by 7 percent
for the year 2003 to 819.5 million pounds, or $1.29 billion, from
768.4 million pounds and by 8 percent for the year 2013 to 997.4
million pounds from 923.1 million pounds.
   Eurotunnel shares, which have fallen sharply since the higher
costs were announced, were off 33 pence, or 52 cents, at 535 pence
on London's Stock Exchange Monday morning.
   Morton said the proposed British Rail high-speed rail link
joining London with the tunnel needed to be completed ``as quickly
as possible'' to avoid serious congestion on existing networks.
   On the tunnel work itself, Eurotunnel reported that the boring
machines had ``not yet reached satisfactory production rate,'' but
that modifications were being made.
   Working from both sides of the channel, workers have dug about
half of a service tunnel, but construction of two other tunnels,
which will carry trains in opposite directions, has a long way to
go. Eurotunnel says it will complete the project by mid-1993.

<HEAD>Iraq Says It Won't Boost Oil Exports Unless OPEC Pact Collapses</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A top Iraqi oil official said his
country's new extra production capacity will be used only if OPEC
agreements collapse, the Middle East Economic Survey reported
Monday.
   Ramzi Salman, head of the State Oil Marketing Organization, told
the weekly newsletter that Iraq's new oil capacity ``will help to
make people think twice before violating the agreement.''
   ``A year ago we did not have that flexibility or that potential,
but now we have it and should there be a political decision to use
it, we can use it,'' Salman said.
   He said Iraq could now export more than 4 million barrels a day,
well over its Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries daily
quota of 2.92 million barrels for the last quarter of this year.
   Export capacity ``will be developed to bigger volumes and I
don't think producing 4 million barrels is a problem,'' he said.
   He stressed Iraq's continued commitment to the OPEC agreements
and its desire for firm oil prices, adding: ``We are not interested
in lower prices ... revenue maximization is the objective.''
   The comments by Salman were carried in an interview published by
the Nicosia-based newsletter.
   His warning came at a time when the cartel's 13 member nations
are exceeding their production limits under the OPEC agreement.
   The International Energy Agency said in its monthly Oil Market
Report last week that OPEC pumped about 22.3 million barrels of
crude a day in September, the same as in August, while the
production ceiling was set at 19.5 million.
   The cartel has decided to boost production by 1 million barrels
a day for the last quarter of the year, raising its overall stated
production to 20.5 million. This is still nearly 2 million lower
that the actual August-September production level.
   The average price of oil has hovered around $16.82 a barrel, as
monitored by OPEC in the last week of September, compared to OPEC's
target of $18.
   Iraq's increased export capacity followed the completion of a
second phase of a pipeline across Saudi Arabia to the Red Sea port
of Yanbu, raising the line's capacity to 1.65 million barrels a day.
   That is in addition to a pipeline through Turkey to the
Mediterranean that also can carry 1.65 million barrels a day, and
the reopening of the Al Bakr terminal on the Persian Gulf.
   The terminal was damaged during the eight-year war with Iran but
50 percent of its original capacity has been restored and it now
can handle at least 800,000 barrels a day, Salman said.

<TEXT>
   Economists are increasingly wary of federal
government economic data, says Walter J. Williams, an independent
analyst with a specialty in forecasting interest rates for
institutional clients.
   Querying 113 of his brethren at a meeting of the National
Association of Business Economists recently, he found 72 percent of
them weren't happy with the quality of data. Many said it was
deteriorating.
   It's worth noting, ``and perhaps a little frightening,'' he
observes, that the greatest skepticism was directed at numbers that
generally are given the most weight by financial decision-makers.
   He says that because he found his colleagues especially
skeptical about the Bureau of Economic Analysis, which issues the
gross national product figures, and the Bureau of the Census, whose
numbers include retail sales.
   He did not offer the example that follows, but it probably
serves as well as any to illustrate what he is talking about.
   The illustration relates to economic conditions during mid-year
1986, when much of the country was experiencing economic problems.
   On July 22 of that year the government reported that
second-quarter GNP had grown at a 1.1 percent rate, down sharply
from a first-quarter rate of just under 4 percent. The economy was
still expanding, it said, but sluggishly.
   One year later, on July 24, 1987, the report was revised to show
a gain of only 0.6 percent. After still another revision, on July
27, 1988, the tiny 0.6 percent growth was turned into an 0.8
percent decline.
   The revisions continued. On July 27, 1989, a full percentage
point was added to the 0.8 percent decline, making for a
substantial, 1.8 percent shrinkage of gross national product for
the second quarter of 1986.
   It wasn't the only revision. GNP for the third quarter of 1986,
initially reported as growth of 1.4 percent, also was revised
downward. It became 1 percent in 1988, and only 0.8 percent in the
1989 revision.
   Should the pattern of downward revisions continue next year, in
the summer of 1990, it will mean that way back in 1986, the United
States economy was in recession. Two back-to-back quarters of GNP
shrinkage defines recession.
   One critic of the government's GNP numbers doubts that it will
take place. Albert Sindlinger, a pioneer in economic measurements,
says ``It would be very embarrassing in 1990 to tell America it had
a recession four years earlier.''
   He has a special interest in the changing numbers because, based
on data he had assembled and distributed to clients at the time, 31
states making up 49.5 percent of the U.S. population were in
recession in the second quarter of 1986.
   The recession states _ associated with minerals, heavy industry,
farming, oil and lumber _ knew they were in recession, he said. But
much of the country had no idea. In the national numbers, coastal
booms offset the negatives.
   More than embarrassing in all this is the fact that important
personal, business and governmental business was affected by the
incorrect government numbers.
   Decisions are made within seconds of the initial announcements.
Once made, those decisions forever skew the economy's path. They
cannot be revised.
   There may be no easy way to correct the problem. Perhaps most of
the revisions made in economic data result from additional
information unavailable earlier. Economic information must be
timely; it is perishable.
   Economists interviewed by Williams, who operates under the name
American Business Econometrics, seemed to suggest that personnel
improvements might help. Eighty-two percent of them agreed that
insufficient funding and staffing were causes of poor quality. More
than half cited data-gathering techniques.
   A Washington environment that often leads to political-economic
clashes was all but absolved of blame. Relatively few economists,
said Williams, believe the quality of federal numbers is damaged by
political manipulation.

   Telerate Inc., which delivers computerized
financial information, said Monday its third-quarter earnings
dropped 17.4 percent compared with a year earlier despite a 14.3
percent increase in revenue.
   Separately, Telerate said it is in negotiations to buy the 50
percent stake that its partner American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.
owns in the joint venture Global Transactions Services Co.
   Telerate and AT&amp;T began the venture in 1987 to develop an
electronic service for foreign-exchange transactions. The service
was recently launched.
   Telerate is also expected to reply on Tuesday to an
$18-per-share, or $576 million, offer from Dow Jones &amp; Co. for the
33.8 percent stake in Telerate that Dow Jones does not already own.
The offer, announced last month, values the entire company at
nearly $1.71 billion.
   In its earnings report, Telerate said it had net income of $19.5
million, or 21 cents per share, in the three months ended Sept. 30
compared with $23.6 million, or 25 cents per share, a year earlier.
   Third-quarter revenue rose to $127.8 million from $112.3 million
a year earlier.
   Subscriptions to the company's services continue to grow
although its U.S. business has been hurt by problems in the thrift
industry, which is among its groups of customers, said Neil S.
Hirsch, president and chief executive of Telerate.
   He said earnings were depressed in the third quarter by costs of
introduction of the foreign exchange trading service from Global
Transactions.
   Expenses will continue at a relatively high level through the
balance of 1989, Hirsch said, and should continue to affect
earnings for the rest of the year, but should moderate later as the
service generates more revenue.

   Share prices fell sharply Monday on London's Stock
Exchange in reaction to the pound's weakness and fears that the
recent hike in British interest rates could lead to a recession.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index fell 30.5
points, or 1.3 percent, to close at 2,247.0, its lowest close since
July 10.
   The index declined throughout the day after opening at its
session high of 2,262.8. The index closed only marginally above the
day's low of 2,242.6.
   The Financial Times 30-share index ended 34.9 points lower at
1,822.9. The Financial Times 500-share index fell 18.94 points to
close at 1,250.43.
   Volume came to 424 million shares, down from Friday's 505.5
million shares.
   Dealers pointed to sterling's drop below 3.0 West German marks
early in the day as the key factor in the market's decline. The
weakness in sterling exacerbated the market's concerns over rising
British interest rates, which now stand at 15 percent, and chances
for recession.
   But dealers attributed part of the price declines to
profit-taking, and said institutions were actively buying the more
recession-proof stocks.

equity interests in South African companies as part of its
continuing restructuring.
   The oil and steel concern withheld the identify of the buyers
and the sale price.
   USX last week said it was offering to sell the natural gas and
oil reserves of its Texas Oil &amp; Gas Corp. subsidiary, a move that
follows changes in its steel, transportation and diversified
busiesses.
   Shareholders submitted a resolution earlier this year that USX
sell its holdings in the racially segregated nation. They withdrew
the resolution after management said sale negotiations were under
way.
   USX held a 21 percent stake in Associated Manganese Mines of
South Africa Ltd., 45 percent in Feralloys Ltd. and 46 percent in
Prieska Copper Mines Ltd. The companies produce iron ore, manganese
ore, chrome ore, zinc concentrates and ferroalloys.
   The company said it formerly used minerals from the companies
but no longer finds them essential as a supplier. USX had no
operations or employees in South Africa.
   USX had net income $756 million on sales of $17 billion in 1988.

<TEXT>
   Centel Corp. announced Monday it has reached an
agreement to purchase the cellular telephone franchise serving the
Aiken, S.C., and Augusta, Ga., area from Pond Branch Telephone Co.
   Terms of the agreement with Pond Branch, based near Aiken, were
not disclosed. The transaction is subject to the minority
shareholder's right of refusal, which may be exercised within 30
days. Completion of the deal is subject to approval by state and
federal regulators.
   Aiken-Augusta, on the South Carolina-Georgia border, has a
population of 406,000 and is located between two other Centel
cellular markets, in Greenville-Spartansburg-Anderson and
Charleston.
   Centel provides cellular service to 41 markets nationwide,
second only to McCaw Communications of Kirkland, Wash.
Chicago-based Centel is the 10th-largest cellular phone company in
terms of customers served, said spokesman William K. White.
   The company said it will have operating control of 46 markets
and interests in 14 others after acquisitions are completed in
Aiken-Augusta; Dothan, Ala.; Laredo, Texas; Petersburg-Colonial
Heights, Va.; and Sioux City, Iowa.
   In addition to its cellular operations, Centel _ which had 1988
revenues of $1.09 billion _ provides local exchange telephone
service through more than 1.5 million access lines in nine states
and supplies electrical service to nearly 136,000 customers in two
states.
   The company recently announced the sale of four of its cable
television operations and has reached definitive agreements to sell
its remaining properties. Centel also is seeking bids for its
business systems operation, which markets, designs and installs
advanced telecommunications and data systems and has more than
18,000 customers.

   Grain and soybean futures prices closed lower
Monday on the Chicago Board of Trade as traders reacted to word the
weekend saw the biggest harvest of the season.
   November and January soybeans drifted to contract lows in light
trading, reflecting the harvest news.
   Adding pressure to prices was speculation by traders that the
U.S. Department of Agriculture's crop report due out Thursday will
contain an upward revision of the crop production estimate, said
William Biedermann, an analyst with Allendale Inc. in Chicago.
   Corn prices were pressured by the belief there will be little
additional business from the Soviet Union. The USDA announced late
Friday that the Soviets have purchased 1.1 million metric tons of
corn.
   There is little prospect of more business from the Soviet Union,
Biedermann said.
   Wheat prices were undermined by the dashing of rumors that the
Soviets would buy U.S. wheat. It appears the Soviets would instead
try to rely on domestic production, analysts said.
   The absence of many traders because of the Yom Kippur and
Columbus Day holidays tended to depress prices, according to
analysts.
   At the close, wheat was 3{ cents to 5\ cents lower with the
contract for delivery in December at $4.06\ a bushel; corn was 3
cents to 4\ cents lower with December at $2.35 a bushel; oats were

   The Manville Corp. board on Monday approved a $65

   In February, Manville acquired the exclusive North American

technology. NEG is a leading manufacturer of technical glass
products for a wide range of industries.
   ``We have the technology, the financial resources and the
dedication of our employees to provide our customers with the

A. Kashnow, vice president and general manager of the Denver-based
company's mats, fiber and reinforcements division.
   Manville is the world's largest producer of fiber glass mats and
a leading producer of fiber glass insulation and continuous
filament glass fibers.

   Oil futures prices finished higher in light
holiday trading Monday, led by a seasonal push in heating oil.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the November contract for
domestic heating oil rose 0.59 cent to close at 58.77 cents a
gallon.
   Unleaded gasoline for November delivery climbed to 54.99 cents a
gallon, up 0.19 cent from Friday's close. Contracts for later
delivery of both refined products posted smaller gains.
   West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of crude oil, rose
15 cents to settle at $20.02 a 42-gallon barrel. The contract
closed at $19.87 on Friday, down 9 cents from the previous session.
The December crude contract closed up 17 cents at $19.85 a barrel.
   Traders said prices moved in a narrow range throughout the
session in what might have been the lightest trading day this year.
Three holidays combined to keep trading volume thin _ Columbus Day,
Yom Kippur and Canada's Thanksgiving Day holiday.
   ``It's very quiet,'' said Jack Unger, energy broker with Merrill
Lynch Energy Futures.
   Brendan Dolan, trader with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., said
heating oil helped push the market higher, despite the thin volume.
   ``It moved up on seasonal factors,'' Dolan said. ``It will
probably continue to move the market out.''

<HEAD>Joint Pharmaceutical Venture Agrees To Buy Antacid Producer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A joint venture between two major American
pharmaceutical companies has agreed to buy the over-the-counter
medicine business of a British concern's U.S. subsidiary for about
$450 million, it was announced Monday.
   Johnson &amp; Johnson-Merck Consumer Pharmaceuticals Co. announced
the agreement in principle to buy the over-the counter medicines
business of ICI Americas, the maker of Mylanta antacid and Mylicon
anti-gas products.
   With the acquisition of ICI Americas' over-the-counter business,
Johnson &amp; Johnson-Merck, a joint venture formed in March and based
in Fort Washington, Pa., would become the 14th largest firm in the
United States' over-the-counter medicines market, said John
Doorley, a Merck spokesman.
   ICI Americas is a subsidiary of Imperial Chemical Industries PLC
of Great Britain.
   Johnson &amp; Johnson-Merck says it wants to develop
non-prescription products, mainly from Merck's prescription
medicines, and seek new products outside the two companies. Mylanta
and Mylicon would be the venture's first marketed products.
   F. Robert Kniffin, a spokesman for Johnson &amp; Johnson, said the
venture hoped to sign a final agreement by the end of the year.
Kniffin said ICI Americas would receive cash, other obligations and
U.S. rights to Merck's anti-depressant, Elavil, together worth more
than $450 million.
   Doorley said Johnson &amp; Johnson and Merck would make equal
contributions, but that Merck's cash contribution would be less
because it was giving up rights to Elavil. He would not discuss the
amount of cash involved.

   The dollar turned narrowly mixed Monday in thin
holiday trading.
   Gold prices were lower.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery closed at $363.10 a troy ounce, down 60 cents from Friday.
Republic National Bank of New York quoted a late bid for gold at
$362.50 an ounce, off 75 cents.
   Currency dealers said trading was subdued and abbreviated
because of the Columbus Day and Yom Kippur holidays. The markets in
Hong Kong also closed for a holiday, while trading in Japan slowed
on the eve of a holiday there.
   Taking the spotlight Monday was the British pound, which sunk
below 3 West German marks in Europe for the first time in 18
months, despite last week's rise in base lending rates in line with
similar rate hikes across Europe.
   Some London dealers said they were worried that the British
government's anti-inflation strategy might tilt the nation's
economy into a recession.
   ``There are no positives for the pound,'' said Jeremy Hale, a
senior economist at Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. ``Recession is now the
center of concern.''
   The pound closed at $1.5775 in London, down from $1.6030 Friday.
Sterling fetched $1.5775 in New York, lower than $1.6055 on Friday.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar fell 0.22 Japanese yen to a closing 142.23 yen.
It traded at 142.80 yen in London, and at 142.85 yen in New York,
up from 142.35 yen on Friday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday's
rates, included: 1.8875 West German marks, down from 1.8885; 1.6485
Swiss francs, up from 1.6420; 6.3995 French francs, down from
6.4050; 1.17525 Canadian dollars, unchanged; and 1,383.25 Italian
lire, unchanged.
   Late dollar rates in Europe compared with Friday included:
1.8865 West German marks, down from 1.8880; 1.6457 Swiss francs, up
from 1.6435; 6.4005 French francs, down from 6.4035; 2.1310 Dutch
guilders, down from 2.1350; 1.1749 Canadian dollars, down from
1.1760; and 1,384.00 Italian lire, up from 1,380.25.
   Gold fell in London to a late bid price of $362.75 an ounce from
$363.25 Friday, but it was unchanged in Zurich at $362.80 an ounce.
   Silver prices declined. On the New York Comex, silver bullion
for current delivery fell to $5.050 a troy ounce from $5.117
Friday. Silver fell in London to $5.09 an ounce from $5.14.

<HEAD>MGM-UA, Qintex Continue Talks Over Stalled Takeover</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Lead prospects uncertain</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Representatives from MGM-UA
Communications Co. and Australia's Qintex Group continued
discussions Monday in an attempt to get Qintex's stalled $1.5
billion takeover bid for MGM-UA back on track.
   The deal was placed in jeopardy last week when MGM-UA revealed
that Qintex failed to make a scheduled $50 million down payment.
   Qintex, an Australian resorts and entertainment company, was to
have delivered the irrevocable letter of credit for $50 million by
Sept. 22, one week after Qintex outbid media mogul Rupert Murdoch
for MGM-UA by $100 million.
   Daniel Saks, a spokesman for Qintex, said negotiations over the
letter of credit had taken place over the weekend and continued
Monday.
   He said the talks involved a renegotiation of the letter of
credit, which is in essence a non-refundable deposit. But Saks
described as inaccurate a report Monday in the Wall Street Journal,
which said MGM-UA was seeking to increase the amount of the letter
of credit to $100 million.
   MGM-UA spokeswoman Mary Hardy said she was unable to make any
statement beyond that contained in the company's announcement
Thursday of the missed deadline.
   MGM-UA chairman Jeffrey C. Barbakow was off for the holiday, a
secretary said. Kevin Wallace, Qintex's chief financial officer,
was also out of the office for the day, his secretary said.
   The protracted negotiations rekindled speculation that Qintex
might be unable to afford the planned purchase. Qintex officials
have said repeatedly that its financing will come in part from a
group of 10 Asian and European investors, none of whom have been
identified publicly.
   In a release issued late Thursday, MGM-UA said the Qintex letter
of credit had yet to arrive. It added that the companies were
talking about modifying their merger agreement concerning
``appropriate security'' from Qintex.
   No change was contemplated in the merger price, the MGM-UA
statement said.
   Earlier last week, Qintex Chairman Christopher C. Skase assured
the Brisbane Stock Exchange that Qintex had ``arranged the
security'' for the $50 million letter of credit. MGM-UA said Qintex
had advised it that security had been posted in a bank.
   Jeffrey Logsdon, an analyst at the investment firm of Crowell,
Weedon and Co., said last month that a major studio needs $300
million in capital each year to sustain production and
distribution. Logsdon said Qintex needs to accumulate two years of
operating capital, or $600 million, on top of the $1.5 billion
purchase price.
   In buying MGM-UA, Qintex will also assume $400 million of MGM-UA
junk-bond debt. Including Logsdon's production estimates, that
would mean that Qintex will end up spending $2.5 billion to acquire
and operate MGM-UA.

<HEAD>Soybean Prices Plunge Due to Good Harvest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HERBERT G. McCANN</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices closed lower Monday as traders
reacted to news that the weekend saw near perfect harvesting
conditions.
   On other markets, cotton prices were sharply lower, precious
metals drifted lower, livestock and pork futures were mixed, energy
futures were higher and coffee prices continued to drift lower.
   Trading on the nation's commodity exchanges was thin due to the
Yom Kippur and Columbus Day holiday.
   Wheat settled 3{ cents to 5\ cents lower with the contract for
delivery in December at $4.06\ a bushel; corn was 2{ cents to 4
cents lower with December at $2.35 a bushel; oats were 3 cents to
3{ cents lower with December at $1.40{ a bushel; and soybeans were
7\ cents to 11} cents lower with November at $5.56} a bushel.
   November and January soybeans drifted to contract lows in light
trading at the Chicago Board of Trade, reflecting the harvest news.
   Adding pressure to prices was the expectation that the U.S.
Department of Agriculture's crop report due out Thursday will have
an upward revision of the crop production estimate, said William
Biedermann, an analyst with Allendale Inc. in Chicago.
   Corn prices were pressured by the belief there will be little
additional business from the Soviet Union. The USDA announced late
Friday that the Soviets have purchased 1.1 million metric tons of
corn.
   There is little prospect of more business from the Soviet Union,
Biedermann said.
   Wheat prices were undermined by a spillover effect from soybeans
and a lack of export demand.
   Cotton prices closed sharply lower on New York's Cotton Exchange
as moderating weather conditions in the delta cotton-growing region
prompted profit-taking by commission houses.
   Weather forecasts had indicated that temperatures would drop
below freezing in crop-growing areas over the weekend. However,
temperatures remained above freezing.
   Cotton was .41 cent to 1.47 cents lower with October at 74.53
cents a pound.
   Precious metal prices were lower on New York's Commodity
Exchange as the dollar showed strength against other major
currencies.
   Gold was 60 cents to $1 lower with October at $363.10 a troy
ounce; silver was 6.7 cents to 8.7 cents lower with October at
$5.05 a troy ounce.
   Oil futures prices finished higher on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, led by a seasonal push in heating oil.
   Traders said prices moved in a narrow range throughout the
session in what might have been the lightest trading day this year.
   West Texas Intermediate was 15 cents to 17 cents higher with
November at $20.02 a barrel; heating oil was .35 cent to .59 ent
higher with November at 58.77 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was
.05 cent to .19 cent higher with November at 54.99 cents a gallon.
   Coffee prices continued their decline on New York's Coffee,
Sugar &amp; Cocoa Exchange as the market reacts to the failure last
week of the International Coffee Organization to come up with a
price support agreement.
   Prices also were driven down by the abundance of coffee
supplies, said Kim Badenhop, an analyst with Merrill Lynch Capital
Markets Inc in New York.
   Coffee was 1.45 cents to 1.76 cents lower with December at 68.72
cents a pound.
   Livestock futures closed mostly lower and pork futures were
mixed in light trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Cattle futures were underpinned by firmer cash prices, but that
firmness was undermined somewhat by lower beef cut-out prices.
   Pork futures were helped by lighter than anticipated movement to
market of hogs, analysts said.
   Live cattle were .10 cent lower to .28 cent higher with October
at 71.95 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .22 cent lower to .08
cent higher with October at 82.75 a pound; hogs were .02 cent lower
to .60 cent higher with October at 46.60 cents a pound; and frozen
pork bellies were .47 cent to .58 cent lower with February at 46.57
cents a pound.

<HEAD>USAir Stock Rises After Published Report</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   USAir Group Inc. stock climbed in heavy
trading Monday after a published report said a major stockholder,
Steinhardt Partners, was buying more shares and looking into other
options aimed at raising the company's stock price.
   Michael H. Steinhardt, a New York money manager whose firm owns
8.3 percent of the Arlington, Va., based USAir Group, has hired
Wall Street investment banker Wertheim Schroder &amp; Co. to explore
ways to raise the price of the stock, USA Today's Dan Dorfman
reported Monday.
   The newspaper said Steinhardt apparently thinks the stock is
undervalued.
   Two calls to Steinhardt Partners were not returned Monday.
   USAir Group was the most active issue traded on the New York
Stock Exchange on Monday, rising $3.62{ a share to $52.25 on volume
of 1.65 million shares.
   After the stock market closed, USAir said a softening of revenue
and increased expenses will cause significantly lower operating
results for the company in both the third and fourth quarters.
   Expenses are higher than expected because of labor costs and
onetime costs related to its recent merger with Piedmont Airlines,
Chairman Edwin I. Colodny said. In addition, he said Hurricane Hugo
disrupted the USAir system in the Southeast.
   USAir spokeswoman Susan Young said the company had no comment on
the news story about Steinhardt Partners. ``That is a speculative
kind of thing,'' she said.
   Increasing services to overseas markets, selling off a stake in
the business to a foreign investor or a recapitalization plan
involving large stockholder dividends are among the options
Steinhardt is studying, USA Today said.
   The newspaper also said that although there were no takeover
plans, Steinhardt had not ruled out a takeover bid.
   USAir has already girded for possible takeover battles. In
August, in what was described as a friendly deal, the company sold
$358 million worth of a new preferred stock to Berkshire Hathaway,
a firm led by billionaire investor Warren Buffett. That stock could
be converted to at least a 12 percent stake in the company in two
years, according to the deal.
   USAir has also set up an employee stock plan and has boosted its
stock buyback program. Under the buyback program the company hopes
to have about 20 percent of its stock in friendly hands by mid-1990.

<HEAD>Dow Jones' Profit Down 9.9 Percent in Third Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dow Jones &amp; Co. Inc. on Monday reported a 9.9
percent decline in third-quarter profit, reflecting continued
weakness in financial advertising in its publications and a drop in
net income at a key affiliate.
   The business publishing company said its profit fell to $28.8
million, or 29 cents a share, in the three months ended Sept. 30
from $32 million, or 33 cents a share, in the same period a year
earlier.
   The decline occurred despite a 5.3 percent increase in revenue
to $404.1 million from $383.7 million in the third quarter of 1988.
   Dow Jones attributed the profit decline partly to continued
weakness in advertising at its flagship publication The Wall Street
Journal and its weekly financial newspaper, Barron's. In addition,
the company said, its bottom line was hurt by a 17.6 percent drop
in net income at Telerate Inc., an electronic financial data
service that is 67 percent owned by Dow Jones.
   Profits at Telerate, like Dow Jones a publicly traded company,
tumbled to $19.5 million, or 21 cents a share, from $23.6 million,
or 25 cents a share, in the third quarter of 1988. Most of the loss
came from startup costs for its new foreign-exchange trading
service.
   Separately Monday, Telerate said it is in negotiations to buy
the 50 percent stake that its partner American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph Co. owns in the joint venture Global Transactions
Services Co. Telerate and AT&amp;T began the venture in 1987 to develop
an electronic service for foreign-exchange transactions.
   Telerate is expected to reply on Tuesday to an $18-a-share, or
$576 million, offer from Dow Jones for the remainder of Telerate
that it doesn't already own. The offer, announced last month,
values the entire company at nearly $1.71 billion.
   Dow Jones' net income for the first nine months of the year
jumped 49.7 percent to $277.2 million, or $2.75 a share, from
$185.1 million, or $1.92 a share, in the year-earlier period. The
latest nine-month period included an after-tax gain of $164.1
million, or $1.63 a share, from the sale in January of Dow Jones'
interest in Continental Cablevision Inc.
   In the first nine months of 1988, Dow Jones had an after-tax
gain of $68 million, or 71 cents a share, mainly from the sale of
its book-publishing subsidiary.
   Revenue for the first three quarters rose 4.9 percent to $1.25
billion from $1.19 billion a year earlier.

<HEAD>Judge Rejects Motion To Dismiss Lawsuit Over Top-Secret Contract</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A state judge has refused to block a
lawsuit against General Dynamics Corp., which claimed it was immune
from the suit under national security laws.
   Stamford Superior Court Judge Nicholas A. Cioffi said in his
decision, which was filed Friday and released Monday, that only the
federal government _ not a private party _ could invoke national
security privileges to protect itself from lawsuits.
   Norden Systems, a subsidiary of Hartford-based United
Technologies Corp., sued General Dynamics in April after Norden was
dropped from a top-secret program to develop a new generation of
Navy jet fighters.
   General Dynamics, based in St. Louis, is the prime contractor
for the $4 billion Advanced Tactical Aircraft program. It had
awarded a $114 million subcontract to Norden in January 1988 to
develop an in-air radar system for the jet fighter.
   General Dynamics said it canceled the contract because it was
dissatisfied with Norden's work.
   Norden, based in Norwalk, claims it is owed at least $39 million
for the work it did on the radar system. It also claims its
reputation was damaged by the cancellation and that hundreds of
jobs also were eliminated as a result.
   Norden is seeking damages in excess of $15,000 in its lawsuit.
Under Connecticut law, plaintiffs can only specify ranges of
damages they are seeking, not a specific amount.
   General Dynamics argued in court last month that it can't be
sued because the contract dispute involves a top-secret project.
Company attorney Herbert Fenster of Washington, D.C., said that to
defend itself General Dynamics would have to publicly release
top-secret documents. Fenster said the release of such documents
would compromise national security.
   Norden contends it can prove its case without using top-secret
documents.
   General Dynamics' also argued that the Superior Court lacks
jurisdiction over the matter. Cioffi also rejected that claim,
saying: ``This court does have subject matter jurisdiction to
entertain the instant case which is a contract action.''
   Fenster wasn't in his office Monday and couldn't be reached for
a comment, according to a secretary.
   Norden spokesman Scott Brinckerhoff said, ``We're pleased that
this obstacle has been removed and the case can go forward.''
   The Navy has not intervened in the dispute. It has asked only
that national secrets not be disclosed.

   Stock prices kept their recent run of record
highs going Monday with a small advance in slow holiday trading.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 5.89 to 2,791.41,
hitting a new closing high for the fifth consecutive session.
   Advancing issues slightly outnumbered declines in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 705 up, 657
down and 546 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 86.81 million
shares, down from 172.52 million Friday and the lightest total
since a 68.87 million-share day on July 3, which was a session
sandwiched between a weekend and Independence Day.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 106.27 million shares.
   A quiet day had been expected in the absence of many market
participants for the Columbus Day and Yom Kippur holidays.
   Analysts said those traders who were on hand were apparently
taking a moment to pause and reappraise the outlook for the economy
and interest rates.
   Recent evidence of only sluggish growth in the economy, and a
strong dollar in foreign exchange, have prompted talk of increasing
prospects for an easier Federal Reserve credit policy.
   But many observers have cautioned that the Fed is likely to act
only cautiously and gradually, in keeping with the style of
Chairman Alan Greenspan.
   Computer and technology issues continued their rebound of the
past couple of sessions from a selloff that followed an earnings
disappointment at International Business Machines.
   IBM rose 1} to 109\; Compaq Computer 6 to 104|; Digital
Equipment 1~ to 93{, and Hewlett-Packard 1[ to 51\. Walt Disney was
also jumping, up 6\ at 134[.
   Other gainers among the blue chips included Philip Morris, up }
at 179]; Exxon, up \ at 45|; USX, up [ at 38|, Procter &amp; Gamble, up
2} at 131}, and DuPont, up 1{ at 122.
   Airline stocks were mostly higher on a continued flow of
takeover news and speculation. AMR, being sought by investor Donald
Trump, gained ~ to 104|; USAir jumped 3| to 52\, and Delta Air
Lines was up 1} at 81}.
   Abbott Laboratories picked up | to 67|, traded at new 52-week
highs. The company reported third-quarter earnings of 88 cents a
share, up from 76 cents in the comparable period a year ago.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $9.16 billion, or 0.26
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained .40 to 199.34.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 1.27 to 410.49, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was up 1.02 at 359.80.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
climbed 2.09 to 485.73. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 396.52, up .59.

<DATELINE>DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soichiro Honda, the founder of the
Japanese automaker that bears his name, dropped by the Henry Ford
Museum on Monday and recalled the day he first saw an automobile _
a Model T he chased down a Japanese road when he was 6.
   ``Every time that Ford car stopped, it left a little bit of an
oil slick underneath and I smelled that oil slick, I enjoyed it
thoroughly and I still remember very vividly the kind of enjoyment
I had by smelling that oil slick,'' the 82-year-old Honda said.
   In addition to the museum visit, where he received a plaque,
Honda was in the Detroit area to be inducted Tuesday into the
Automotive Hall of Fame.
   He talked to reporters in front of a 1983 Honda Accord with a
serial number 001, the first car to be made at the company's
Marysville, Ohio, assembly plant.
   His company was followed by other Japanese automakers in
establishing assembly plants in the United States. Toyota Motor
Corp., Mazda Motor Corp. and Nissan Motor Corp. each have wholly
owned plants on U.S. soil.
   Mitsubishi Motors Corp. is linked with Chrysler Corp. in a joint
venture and Fuji Heavy Industries Inc. and Isuzu Motors Ltd. own a
plant to make Subaru cars and Isuzu trucks.
   Later this year, Honda begins production at its second U.S.
plant, in East Liberty, Ohio. Honda will make Civic and Accord cars
at the two plants.
   But Honda has steered clear of linking itself with a U.S.
automaker. It has a production agreement with the British automaker
Austin Rover, maker of Sterling cars for the U.S. market.
   The company's founder declined to speculate on whether the
company would join forces with any other company in the United
States. ``That never happened during my generation and I cannot
answer what is going to happen in the future,'' he said.
   Honda began his auto career in a Tokyo repair shop at the age of
16. In the 1930s he became involved in racing and in 1937, he
formed a small piston ring company.
   He formed Honda Motor Co. in 1948 and began producing bicycles.
The company entered the auto industry in 1963 and became a U.S.
manufacturer just less than 20 years later.
   Honda has no formal role with the company he founded. ``I
retired from Honda Motor Company 16 years ago. I'm currently
unemployed.''
   Yet his passion for cars and the way they work continues.
   ``What I would really like to do even today is mess up my hands
and work in grease,'' he said.

<HEAD>Hospital Management Company Accepts Lower Offer</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   American Medical International Inc.
on Monday accepted an investment group's reduced buyout offer that
values the company at $3 billion, including the assumption of $1.31
billion in debt.
   The investment group, IMA Holdings Corp., which includes
Chicago's Pritzker family and First Boston Corp., last week
withdrew an offer of $3.35 billion for the hospital management
company, saying it would be unable to finance the original tender
offer as expected.
   Under the revised deal, it agreed to pay $26.50 a share in cash
for about 86 percent of American Medical's stock, and securities
for the remainder.
   The original plan had called for IMA Holdings to pay $28 a share
in cash for about 94 percent of American Medical's stock, and
securities for the rest.
   The revised agreement expires Oct. 25.
   American Medical said that until the tender offer expires, it is
reserving itself the option of soliciting, working out and
accepting a better deal for its shareholders.

<TEXT>
   Walt Disney Co. stock shot up $6.25 to
close at $134.12{ a share Monday in composite trading, more than
double the price of a year ago.
   Disney spokesman Thomas Deegan declined to comment, but analysts
attributed the jump to heavy demand in Europe for newly issued
shares of stock in Euro Disneyland, the theme park Disney is
developing outside Paris.
   On Oct. 10, 1988, Disney stock traded at $66.37{ per share, its
high for that year.
   Almost all the news about Disney has been good lately.
   The company reported such heavy demand at its new movie-theme
park in Florida that Michael Eisner, Disney's chairman and chief
executive officer, decided to double the park's size.
   Although Disney was not expected to be a force in this past
summer's record-setting movie season, the studio's ``Dead Poets
Society'' and ``Honey, I Shrunk the Kids'' were both hits.
   Disney also is expanding its empire to include an independent
television station, KHJ in Los Angeles, and is in discussions to
launch a record label.

   The New York-based investment firm Clayton &amp;
Dubilier Inc. said Monday it will buy Houston-based A.P.S. Inc., an

   Ryder System Inc. will record a $57 million
after-tax charge in the third quarter, resulting in a loss for the
quarter, the transportation and aircraft services company said
Monday.
   The charge includes an adjustment for higher-than-expected
workers' compensation loss reserves, staff and facility reduction
costs, and a loss caused by the the bankruptcy filing of Braniff
Airlines, which had an aircraft maintenance contract with Ryder,
the company said.
   Also included in the charge are a write-down of the carrying
value of unprofitable small businesses in Ryder's Vehicle Leasing &amp;
Services division, anticipated losses from the disposal of surplus
vehicles in that division, and a slow-moving parts inventory in
Ryder's aviation services operation.
   ``We are still dealing with the problems of margin and cost
pressures in the Vehicle Leasing &amp; Services Division and lower auto
production affecting the Automotive Carrier Division,'' said
Ryder's chairman, president and chief executive officer, M. Anthony
Burns.
   Ryder is expected to report the quarterly loss and revenue
figures shortly.
   For 1988's third quarter, Ryder earned $55.2 million on revenue
of $1.26 billion. Revenue for the 12 months ended June 30 totaled
$5.1 billion.
   The company also announced Monday the sale of most of its
Insurance Management Services division to Skandia International
Insurance Corp. of Stockholm, Sweden.
   The sale price was not disclosed. The deal is expected to close
by year's end, Burns said.
   ``The Insurance Management Services division has been a
profitable part of Ryder System,'' Burns said. ``However, Ryder's
strategy in the future will be to concentrate on our transportation
businesses.''
   Miami-based Ryder operates in three areas: motor vehicle
leasing, new-car transportation and aviation services.

<DATELINE>SYDNEY, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. said Monday
it will close its Australian interbank foreign exchange, financial
futures and stock brokerage activities.
   The New York-based investment house said the restructuring is
part of a shakeout among Australian stock brokerages and
foreign-exchange institutions, which are ``suffering from
continuing increased competition and shrinking profit margins.''
   An increase in the number of foreign commercial banks,
investment banks and brokerages here has exacerbated the
competition for business in the financial industry.
   ``It was decided we would be far better to focus our resources
in the areas in which we can provide the most added value to
clients from a local base and to move out of the Australian
interbank foreign exchange market and Australian-sourced broking
areas,'' Ken Allen, chairman of Shearson's Australian operations,
said in a statement Monday.
   Allen said the refocusing follows a review of Shearson's
worldwide operations.
   ``We will service the foreign exchange, U.S. equity and
financial futures requirements of our institutional clients from
our major locations in New York, Tokyo and London,'' Allen said.
``(That) appears to be the most appropriate course of action given
the preference of larger institutions to look for advice directly
from the offshore capital markets.''
   The company said about 20 sales and trading employees will be
offered a severance package or relocation.
   Shearson, which is majority owned by American Express Co.,
started business in Australia in 1987.
