   The charismatic country lawyer who
restored democracy to Argentina looked miserable when he admitted on
national television that the economic crisis was forcing him out of
office early.
   President Raul Alfonsin had often said that his fondest wish was
to finish his six-year term and complete the country's first
transfer of power between elected presidents since 1928.
   Instead, he found himself telling the nation Monday evening, ``No
president has the right to ask people to continue to sacrifice if
his conscience tells him he can temper it by an action of his own.''
   A few minutes later, after several nervous coughs and sips of
water, he said he would step down on June 30 instead of on Dec. 10,
when his term ends.
   President-elect Carlos Menem, whose Peronist Party swept national
elections on May 14, said Tuesday he would take over.
   ``I would say Alfonsin is a bitter man,'' Juan Manuel Casella, an
adviser and friend, said in an interview.
   ``He feels he has been treated unjustly,'' said Casella, the
governing Radical Civic Union's losing candidate for vice president
in the elections. ``I think he will get over it quickly, but that's
how he feels now.''
   Hopes were high when Alfonsin, 62, was elected in October 1983 to
replace a brutal military dictatorship. His campaign theme was,
``With democracy there will be food, health and education.''
   More than five years later, inflation has soared beyond 1,000
percent and the local currency has lost 94 percent of its value
against the dollar since February. The decline in real wages
prompted hungry people earlier this month to loot supermarkets in
this huge, fertile country that has more cattle and sheep than
people. At least 14 people died in the rioting.
   ``The worst thing Alfonsin did was destroy morale,'' said Diana
Mondino, a 30-year-old economist and teacher. ``Young people think
they have no future, and they have reason to think that.''
   Alfonsin opened university enrollment to anyone without admission
requirements, and ``destroyed public education'' in the process, she
said, noting also that teachers' pay has been cut to the point where
many of the best have left the field.
   Human rights, environmental and religious groups say Alfonsin has
been indifferent to their concerns. The Peronists, citing scandals
in the customs office and national mortgage bank, claim his
administration is rife with corruption.
   Alfonsin privately admits he made mistakes. He should have tried
to sell off money-losing state-run businesses earlier than he did,
he has told colleagues, and put a higher priority on balancing the
budget.
   Supporters say Alfonsin consolidated democracy but was confronted
by factors beyond his control.
   World prices for Argentina's farm exports nosedived in the
mid-1980s and restricted the country's ability to raise money for
investment and make payments on its $60 billion foreign debt.
   Right from the start, the Peronists controlled a majority of
provincial legislatures and seats in the national Senate, and
Alfonsin rarely was able to forge a truly bipartisian policy.
   The 4-million-member General Labor Confederation mounted 13
general strikes. Factions of the armed forces, seeking an end to
trials of officers accused of human rights abuses during the 1976-83
dictatorship, staged three barracks revolts.
   ``These things explain why we weren't allowed to finish things as
we liked,'' said deputy Cesar Jaroslavsky of Alfonsin's party. ``We
couldn't do more. We lacked the power to do more.''
   If Alfonsin is going out under a cloud rather than a rainbow, he
is not moving far from center stage. He will remain president of
Argentina's second-biggest party and a fixture on the political
scene.
   ``You can't count him out,'' said a foreign political observer on
condition of anonoymity. ``He's intelligent, dedicated, principled.
He's a brilliant public speaker who touches people's hearts. By no
means have we seen the last of Raul Alfonsin.''

<HEAD>Government Permits Joint U.S.-Canadanian Low-Level Training Flights</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OTTAWA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal government has approved two routes for
joint U.S.-Canadian low-level bomber training flights over
northwestern Canada, Defense Minister Bill McKnight said Wednesday.
   McKnight told the House of Commons the flights will begin this
fall over northern Saskatchewan, Alberta, British Columbia and over
part of the Northwest Territories.
   He said the flights were approved at the request of North
American Aerospace Defense Command, the joint U.S.-Canada air
defense network known as NORAD, and are necessary for the defense of
North America.
   Talking to reporters outside the Commons, he said the training
will not be on a scale comparable to that in Labrador, where
low-level flights have generated a bitter battle with the Innu
Indians, who say their way of life is being destroyed by noise.
   The flights in western Canada will involve up to 25 planes per
day, four days a year, with the first flights this fall. The planes
would be unarmed and will not fly faster than the speed of sound.
   However, a spokesman for the Assembly of First Nations said he
was not aware of any consultation with natives about the flights.
   ``It's news to us to say there's been consultation, I don't know
who he's been consulting,'' said Harry Allen, vice-chief for the
Northwest Territories, in an interview.
   Allen said native Americans oppose military training flights in
western Canada for the same reasons they oppose them in Labrador.
   ``It's disruption of the way of life, it has an impact on wild
game, and those issues are common right across the northern
regions,'' he said.
   McKnight said an environmental impact study of the flights had
been conducted by a private firm and the study has been reviewed by
a branch of the Federal Environmental Assessment Review Office,
which approved the plan.

<HEAD>Five Feared Dead After Fishing Boat Sinks</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Five seamen were feared dead after their fishing
boat capsized north of Britain in rough seas between the Orkney and
Shetland islands.
   All the men lived in or near the Scottish fishing port of
Fraserburgh, which was in mourning after the coast guard said all
realistic chances of the men's survival had passed.
   The 70-foot Majestic capsized in rough seas Tuesday morning while
out trawling with a sister vessel, the Mystic.
   A coast guard helicopter plucked four men from the sea, two
crewmen from the Majestic and two from the Mystic who had dived in
to try to help their friends.
   The body of one crewman was recovered shortly afterward and two
inflatable lifeboats were found to be empty.
   A dozen fishing boats, several helicopters and an airplane took
part in a search, which lasted for six hours.
   The Majestic went down where the Atlantic Ocean and North Sea
converge, a spot where seas are rough and the currents unpredictable.
   One of the survivors from the Majestic, William Bruce, said the
vessel sank after its nets became entangled in an obstruction,
possibly a wreck, on the seabed. ``She went down in a matter of
minutes,'' Bruce said.

   China eagerly awaits them, but foreign businessmen
who return in coming weeks will bring a new wariness about their
prospects.
   ``A lot of people really believed in the China dream,'' a Western
economic specialist said Tuesday, but since the government sent
soldiers to crush pro-democracy protests, ``the vision of the future
is harder to believe in.''
   Thousands of businessmen fled Beijing after the military
crackdown June 3-4 and days of random shooting that followed.
   Most Americans left and some joint ventures with U.S. companies
closed either totally or partially immediately after the military
assault on the students in Tiananmen Square.
   A Chinese employee at the Babcock and Wilcox machinery plant said
it was closed for five days and still was not in full operation. All
the Americans left the country.
   Americans involved in all but four of about 200 joint operations
were evacuated. Nearly all the approximately 3,000 Japanese
businessmen and their families left China.
   China hopes all the foreigners will return. ``I expect all will
be back very soon, since security is now no problem for them,'' said
Zheng Tuobin, minister of foreign economic relations and trade.
   He said the foreigners had suffered in the past month because of
``sabotage from ruffians'' and apologized for ``inconvenience''
caused by domestic unrest.
   Zheng and other Chinese officials, including senior leader Deng
Xiaoping, gave assurances China would continue the active promotion
of foreign investment.
   U.S. officials said they expected many businessmen to return next
week, ``barring further shooting or ugly anti-American
demonstrations.''
   Japanese sources said trading companies were eager to resume
operations but were being restrained by their government, which
sought to avoid giving the impression of business as usual at a time
of political repression.
   The foreign economic expert, speaking privately, said business as
usual was impossible while soldiers were in the streets and
protesters were being arrested.
   Few companies will leave China, he said, but some will reduce
their staff and new investment will be postponed.
   Because they viewed future prospects as bright, foreign companies
in the past endured time-consuming contract talks, arbitrary
regulations, complex customs procedures, Communist Party
interference and excessive foreign exchange controls.
   According to the foreign expert, ``There's a lot to suggest it
might get worse under the new government.''
   Some analysts say the violent crackdown may have shattered
confidence in China's stability and commitment to reform for years
to come.
   Among businessmen, ``the perception is that China has the
potential to have even more violent incidents down the road,'' said
Robert C. Broadfoot, managing director in Hong Kong of Risk
Consultancy Ltd.
   ``We have been harboring illusions with regard to China,'' said
Miron Mushkat, director and chief economist of Baring Securities
Ltd. in Hong Kong. ``This will be a sobering reminder that doing
business in China can be a hazardous business.''
   Hong Kong, a British colony, is scheduled to revert to China in
1997.
   Since China opened its doors to economic modernization in 1979,
companies from about 40 countries have invested the equivalent of
$12 billion and established 10,000 joint operations.
   In the first four months of 1989, China approved 2,000 new
operations with pledged investment of $2.45 billion.
   Mushkat said the leadership probably would neglect the economy in
coming weeks to focus on cementing political power.
   Even before the turmoil, potential investors were being dissuaded
by a government austerity program meant to curb 30 percent annual
inflation and excessive growth. The economic slowdown dried up
credit and halted price reforms and other measures needed to make
the economy more efficient.
   At the government level, the European Economic Community and
Canada are considering economic sanctions if China continues
reprisals against protesters. Japanese dailies have said Japan, the
main source of development aid for China, is reluctant to resume
assistance to a repressive government.
   Malaysia, which inaugurated flights to China only last week, has
abruptly suspended the new route and Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew of
Singapore, whose small nation has actively invested in China, warned
of ``people resentful, reforms stalled and the economy stagnant.''
   ``Because of her size, such a China could create problems for
herself and her neighbors in Asia,'' Lee said.
   Wu Ganmei, executive director of the non-governmental China
Association of Science and Technology, said: ``The open door will be
affected temporarily; I'm concerned,'' but expressed hope the
businessmen would return.
   ``We don't want to talk about politics,'' she said. ``We're doing
business.'' Her association organizes joint business seminars for
foreigners and Chinese.

<TEXT>
   Every time Budapest residents pass a
kiosk or street stall these days, a new book or article about Imre
Nagy and the failed revolt he led against Stalinism in 1956 seems to
have hit the stands.
   The outpouring of literature, accompanied by lapel pins,
postcards and large photographs showing the bespectacled face of
Nagy, represents a national catharsis over the short-lived revolt.
It was crushed by Soviet tanks and rarely discussed in public for
almost 33 years.
   ``It's as if more than 32 years of collective amnesia have
suddenly lifted,'' a Western diplomat said on condition of
anonymity. ``Even the people who were on the side of putting down
the revolt now suddenly remember where they were and what they did,
and are speaking about it.''
   The ruling Communist Party, which under former General Secretary
Janos Kadar executed Nagy and his associates in 1958, has
rehabilitated Nagy in all but name.
   The party praised him in a May 31 statement as a symbol of
communist reform and a ``significant figure'' in Hungarian history.
Ten days later, the supreme prosecutor applied for the legal
rehabilitation of Nagy and nine of his associates, saying they were
unjustly imprisoned, unfairly tried and illegally executed.
   Nagy and his associates were buried in unmarked graves in a
corner of a Budapest cemetery, but they will be reburied on June 16
in an elaborate, nationally televised ceremony.
   Tens of thousands of Hungarians, including emigres returning for
the occasion, are expected to jam Budapest's Heroes' Square for
ceremonies.
   In a move much joked about by Budapest's increasingly outspoken
media, authorities have even removed a giant nearby statue of Soviet
founder Vladimir I. Lenin, but insist this is only because it
urgently needs repair.
   Some Hungarians are tempted to see parallels between Nagy's
reburial and the reburial early in October 1956 of former foreign
minister Laszlo Rajk, executed in a Communist Party purge in 1949.
   Then, as now, upheaval in Poland and a revision of Stalinist
history in the Soviet Union helped unsettle Hungary. The crowds at
Rajk's funeral on Oct. 6, 1956, became the emotional force behind
the uprising from Oct. 23 to Nov. 4.
   Historian Ferenc Toekei, a member of the party's Central
Committee and one of four people investigating the events of 1956
for the party, said in an interview that ``history never repeats
itself.''
   ``It is simply unimaginable that in the foreseeable future we
could expect an armed uprising,'' he said.
   Emotions over 1956 clearly play a part in today's politics,
however.
   They began rising to the surface in January, when radical
Politburo reformer Imre Pozsgay said on national radio that the 1956
revolt was a ``popular uprising,'' not a counterrevolution as the
party had branded it for 32 years.
   The startling announcement led to a flood of reminiscences about
the revolt and its leaders by historians and surviving relatives.
   The growing number of newspaper articles, journals and books
about 1956 and its unsung heroes culminated this month in the first
officially sanctioned edition of the memoirs of Cardinal Joszef
Mindszenty. He was freed from prison in the revolt but forced to
take refuge in the U.S. Legation for years afterward.
   Popular feeling over 1956 is behind reformers such as Pozsgay,
helping them bend the Communist Party's policies in the direction of
more change and undermining centrists such as communist leader
Karoly Grosz.
   In May, the party signaled how far it had moved in the 12 months
since Grosz succeeded Kadar as general secretary.
   Kadar, who took power as the Soviet tanks rolled into Hungary in
1956, was unceremoniously stripped of the honorary party presidency
he was given last year and lost his seat on the Central Committee,
which criticized mistakes during his long rule.
   Kadar's departure left unanswered questions about his exact role
in ending the 1956 revolt.
   Toekei says the facts will emerge now that historians rather than
politicians are examining archives and interpreting their materials.
   A similar process is under way in the Soviet Union, where the
sheer scale of Stalinist terror and the weight of 70 years of
silence add to the emotion of new discoveries.
   Toekei said it had nonetheless proved difficult to get all the
necessary documents about 1956 from the Soviets. Perhaps because of
Moscow's current preoccupation with its own history and problems,
papers from Kremlin archives are only ``trickling in,'' he said.

   For engineers who dream of graceful steel and
concrete bridges from here to there, plenty of rivers are still to
be crossed _ as well as many interesting bays, creeks and even
gullies.
   ``Little boys and girls play with toys and hope to grow up to
build bridges _ and we do it now. Can you feel the self-satisfaction
here?'' said Herbert M. Mandel, a bridge designer who is chairman of
the sixth annual International Bridge Conference.
   Nearly 1,000 of the world's bridge engineers are meeting for
three days to catch up on the latest in bridge design, construction
techniques and materials.
   Engineers at the conference readily admitted they often dream of
designing one bridge that will inspire travelers and stand the test
of time.
   ``We're always looking for that next bridge and hope to make
something special. We put up monuments. Even a small bridge is a
monument,'' said Mandel, a Pittsburgh-area engineer who designed the
Newport suspension bridge across Rhode Island's Narragansett Bay.
   They also fretted that computers are being used to turn out
identical, dull bridges instead of helping designers with
innumerable technical calculations on beautiful bridges.
   ``The typical highway crossing doesn't have to be unique, but it
shouldn't be ugly, either,'' Mandell said. ``It needs to be
pleasing.''
   As for standing the test of time, Mandell said most designers
expect an average bridge to last 50 years _ much more with proper
maintenance.
   ``As a general principle, a bridge cannot last forever,'' Mandell
said, ``but we don't know how long they'll last.''
   Participants at the conference advanced their study of modern
cable-stayed bridges, pioneered in Europe in the 1950s but
relatively new to the United States. Cable-stayed bridges are
shorter variations of suspension bridges with cables emanating like
an inverted fan from single, center towers.
   ``Aesthetically, they're just outstanding,'' Mandel said.
``They're a work of art and we have to look at our bridges as works
of art. We have to have bridges we're proud to look at.''
   America's most spectacular cable-stayed bridge is the 2-year-old
Sunshine Skyway across the shipping channel of Tampa Bay.
   ``Surely, cable-stayed bridges are here to stay,'' said Blair
Birdsall, a renowned senior bridge engineer from Allendale, N.J.
``But the suspension bridge will always reign over very long spans.''
   Birdsall predicted suspension bridges with 10,000-foot main
spans. The Humber bridge at Hull, England, is the world's longest
with a main span of 4,626 feet. Second is the Verrazano-Narrows
Bridge across Lower New York Bay, at 4,260 feet, and third is San
Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge, 60 feet shorter.
   Engineers at the meeting talked excitedly about the latest in
big-bridge building, the massive Honshu-Shikoku Bridge Project,
which is to link the Japanese islands of Honshu and Shikoku with
three separate causeways of multiple bridges.
   The first causeway, the Kojima-Sakaide Route, opened 14 months
ago with three suspension bridges _ the longest is the world's
fifth-longest _ two cable-stayed bridges, a truss bridge, a land
tunnel and viaducts over more than 8 miles.
   The engineers honored the project's designer, Tsutumu Yamane of
Tokyo. Yamane, in turn, remembered John A. Roebling, the
19th-century American engineer who designed the Brooklyn Bridge,
which opened in 1883 and was the first modern suspension bridge.
   ``Our work is in many ways based on established work of Mr.
Roebling and his Brooklyn Bridge,'' Yamane said. ``It's amazing that
a bridge built more than 100 years ago is still standing with all
that traffic.''

   Calling the arrests of hundreds of
pro-democracy demonstrators in China ``very disturbing,'' the State
Department said Tuesday it will begin granting visas for temporary
visits to the United States for Chinese who want to leave the
country.
   It wasn't immediately clear whether the officials who have been
cracking down on dissenters and other pro-democracy forces in China
will permit those who apply for the U.S. visas to leave.
   Nonetheless, department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said the
U.S. Embassy in Beijing and the consulate in Shanghai will begin
issuing so-called non-immigrant visas, which would permit short
visits to the United States.
   Students sought by the police were unlikely to apply because they
would expose themselves to arrest. Also, they would need the
approval of their schools to get the temporary visas.
   ``The detention or arrest of people for exercising their basic
human rights of freedom of expression and free association is
contrary to internationally recognized standards,'' the spokeswoman
said.
   Noting that Chinese news media have reported the arrests of
hundreds of sons in its continued crackdown of the pro-democracy
movement, Ms. Tutwiler said, ``These arrests are very disturbing.''
   She called on the authorities to respond to the dissidents with
dialogue instead of repression.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III, meanwhile, was presented
with a list of possible sanctions that could be imposed against
China.
   Baker also held his second session with Chinese Ambassador Han Xu
in three days, apparently to discuss the touchy case of Chinese
dissident Fang Lizhi and his wife, Li Shuxian, who have taken refuge
in the U.S. Embassy in Beijing.
   The U.S. action has enraged Chinese officials, who have issued an
arrest warrant for Fang and his wife.
   Ms. Tutwiler refused to provide details or to characterize the
session, which took place Monday. She said the meeting was requested
by the Chinese envoy.
   Baker was believed to be exploring ways to arrange safe passage
from China for Fang, the country's best known dissident, and his
wife. But U.S. officials, concerned about the couple's welfare,
declined to discuss the case.
   Baker, according to a report Tuesday in Hearst Newspapers, on
Saturday proposed to the ambassador that Fang and his wife be
permitted to leave the embassy, and China, for a third country. A
department spokeswoman Tuesday night declined to comment on the
report.
   Asked about the options presented to Baker, Ms. Tutwiler called
them ``a laundry list of possible options should the need arise.''
The secretary had not discussed the options with President Bush, she
said.
   The president imposed military aid and sales to China for the
bloody massacre of pro-democracy protestors and said he reserved the
option of taking other punitive steps.
   Chinese troops have been posted near the U.S. embassy in Beijing,
apparently an effort to prevent anyone from following Fang's example.
   However, Ms. Tutwiler said she was ``not aware of any harassment
of people standing in line.''
   Meanwhile, AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland denounced a
government-controlled labor organization in China for its support of
the violent crackdown on student and other pro-democracy
demonstrators.
   ``By all accounts, the All-China Federation of Labor has sided
with the government against the workers who took to the streets,''
Kirkland said. ``The AFL-CIO has long refused contacts with this
state-controlled labor front.
   ``Its shameful behavior in the current crisis vindicates our
contention that, like its counterparts in other Communist countries,
it does not represent the interests of workers but serves as an
instrument of the Communist Party and the government.''
   Kirkland also called on American businesses to halt all
operations in China until the government makes ``progress toward the
democratic principles that inspired hundreds of thousands of workers
and students to risk their lives.''

   State and federal prisons, already straining to
meet the court-ordered medical needs of record numbers of inmates,
face the costly new problem of geriatrics. The growing population of
those graying behind bars requires long-term care, special diets and
treatment for failing eyes and teeth. Some prisons have geriatric
units, but as one New Jersey corrections official says, ``We know
how to run prisons. We don't know how to run old-age homes.'' The
last of a three-part series, ``Medicine Behind Bars,'' looks at
elderly care in prisons.

   Augustus Bass has had seven heart attacks and
a stroke. He has arthritis, high blood pressure and recurring chest
pains. The 67-year-old man is also locked up in prison, serving 5-15
years for manslaughter.
   ``This is a good place to bring you to let you die,'' said Bass,
his close-cropped beard and thinning hair flecked with gray. ``If
you have a heart attack in prison, you're up the creek without a
paddle.
   ``It's pretty depressing to be old and in prison,'' said Bass,
who limps about with a cane. ``Every time you get a pain in your
chest, you don't know if it's the last time. I just don't want to
die in here. You'd just be another number gone.''
   Bass is 2{ years into his sentence at Kansas' Norton Correctional
Facility, where prison officials are building a geriatric unit to
care for the special medical needs of elderly inmates.
   Nationwide, the number of graying prisoners is growing, due to a
rising prison population and the introduction of nonparole and
mandatory sentences in the mid-1970s. And they are beginning to pose
costly health care problems.
   As of last summer, 18,801 prisoners were older than 55, a 50
percent increase in four years, according to a tally by the American
Correctional Association. Florida expects its elderly population to
grow by 129 percent in 11 years.
   These elderly inmates, still a fraction of the 627,402 total
prisoners, may have chronic heart, liver, lung and kidney
conditions. Some suffer from cancer, diabetes, strokes, Alzheimer's
disease, high blood pressure, arthritis and the effects of years of
alcohol and drug abuse.
   They may need foods free of salt and sugar, not the starchy fare
served in mess halls now. They require hearing aids, eye glasses and
dentures. They may need ramps and elevators for their canes and
wheelchairs. Or they may need an extra blanket in winter or a firmer
mattress for their frail backs.
   ``Prisons were not designed for older people,'' said Julia Hall,
a social psychologist at Drexel University specializing in aging and
criminals. ``Nobody is brutalizing them or purposely neglecting
them, but nobody is prepared to care for them and it is costly.''
   Kansas, where the elderly prison population doubled in six years,
has 153 inmates over 55, including 31 who are past 65.
   A geriatric unit is being built at a former state tuberculosis
hospital and mental unit surrounded by farm fields, four miles
outside this prairie town of 3,400 residents.
   The unit will be more like a college dorm than a prison
cellblock. Outer doors, including one leading to the chapel, have
wheelchair ramps.
   Cells are converted hospital rooms and close with wooden doors
rather than steel bars. Inmates, all medium- or minimum-security
prisoners, will have keys to their rooms.
   Prison staff will be specially trained to be more sensitive to
older inmates' needs. A gym and basketball court would presumably
get little use, so the recreation room will have board games. Each
cell has a cable TV hookup to accommodate inmates too infirm to work.
   ``It's been a neglected population. Older people have more
medical problems,'' said Louis Bruce, director of the Norton prison.
``When you get older, you don't see as well, you don't hear as well
and you just can't get around as well.''
   Corrections officials also want to separate them from young,
bullying inmates who might harm them.
   ``They can't fend for themselves. They just become easy prey.
They're pretty fair game,'' said Jay Shelton, assistant prison
director.
   Richard Baker, 66, came to the Norton prison to serve his
1-to-5-year sentence for driving without a license after a drunken
driving conviction. He has emphysema, arthritis and a heart
condition, and he was given a cane after twice falling down steps at
the prison reception center in Topeka.
   ``I don't have any trouble getting down steps. Getting up them is
a different story,'' the white-haired Baker, dressed in prison
denim, said with a laugh.
   But he promptly stopped his joking. ``I don't think the public or
the institution sympathizes with us. The attitude is `let him die.'
If you did the crime, do the time,'' he said. ``I stay to myself. I
stay in my room and play solitary. I don't mix with crowds. I stay
away from excitement.''
   Ernest Smith, 57, serving 4 to 20 years for possession of
marijuana, said, ``Prison is a place called hell. For the elderly,
it's even worse. Everything hurts more in prison. Every emotion is
intensified.''
   The indignities are manifold. Elderly inmates who need
painkillers, medications and sleeping pills must queue up two or
three times a day for single doses _ individual prescriptions in
bottles might encourage black market trade.
   Canes are given to lame or unsteady inmates only under special
conditions, for fear they could become weapons or vehicles for
smuggling contraband. Even wheelchairs are searched.
   ``We know how to run prisons. We don't know how to run old-age
homes,'' said Bud Walsh, an executive assistant in the New Jersey
Department of Corrections.
   His state, where the elderly inmate count is expected to increase
fivefold in 11 years, is considering adding a geriatric unit. One
study projects that 9 of 10 prisoners now in their 30s will be older
than 50 before they get their first chance at parole or release.
   ``The biggest complaint from elderly inmates is their medical
problems aren't being addressed fast enough,'' Walsh said. ``We
really don't do preventive medicine. We don't have the staff and the
facilities. The regular prison unit is not equipped to handle the
kinds of problems geriatric inmates present. And the medical costs
may be astronomical.''
   The average cost putting someone behind bars for a year is
$23,000, but the tab for an elderly inmate triples, mainly because
of health needs, according to Larry Fultz of the Maryland Parole
Commission.
   Money goes for such expensive operations as heart bypass surgery,
procedures like kidney dialysis or long-term medications for high
blood pressure and enphysema.
   At the Eastern State Correctional Facility near Philadelphia,
inmates formed the Concerned Seniors Group. They meet Thursday
evenings to discuss health care and other issues of concern.
   ``It's a sad way to end a life,'' said Drexel's Hall, who helped
organize the group. ``They have such a sense of despair and
depression. They feel their lives have been totally wasted.''

<HEAD>Japanese Put Away More Than $5 Trillion In Personal Savings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japanese personal savings rose to $5.04 trillion at
the end of fiscal 1988, an average of $126,000 per household and up
11.4 percent over the previous year, the Bank of Japan said in a
report today.
   It was the third consecutive year that personal savings,
deposited at banks or postal offices and held in stocks, bonds and
insurance, posted such a double-digit increase, said an official of
the central bank.
   ``An increase in household incomes, thanks to the nation's
booming economy, is contributing to a continued increase in
savings,'' said the official, who spoke anonymously.
   The official said an international comparison of savings was not
available due to changes in exchange rates, but said Japan's total
personal savings is the second largest in the world after the United
States, which has twice as many people.
   Other bank officials said they anticipated no change in the trend
of Japanese putting away money for years to come.
   Numerous surveys say the head's of Japan's 40 million households
save to prepare for illness and disaster, or for retirement and
education fees for children.
   The United States has suggested that Japanese should save less
and buy more imports to cut the nation's massive trade surplus,
which totaled $78.8 billion last year, up from $76.16 billion in
1987, according to Japanese figures.

<TEXT>
   The Detroit Pistons swept away Los
Angeles' decade of dominance and ended a 41-year title drought
Tuesday night, beating the Lakers 105-97 to win the National
Basketball Association championship.
   Most Valuable Player Joe Dumars, who averaged 27.3 points in the
finals, scored 23 points to help give the Pistons a 4-0 sweep of the
Lakers, who were going for their third consecutive championship and
sixth in the 1980s.
   The Lakers went into the finals with an 11-0 playoff record and
hopes of becoming the first team to make it through the postseason
with a perfect record.
   Instead, it was Detroit that dominated, giving the Pistons their
first title since the franchise started in 1948 in Fort Wayne, Ind.
   James Worthy led the Lakers with a career-high 40 points, but no
one else had more than 13 for the two-time defending champions.
Besides Dumars, Laimbeer had 16, Vinnie Johnson and Thomas 14 for
Detroit and James Edwards had all of his 13 in the fourth quarter.
   The Pistons finished with a 15-2 postseason record, second only
in league history to Philadelphia's 12-1 in 1983, when the 76ers
also swept the Lakers in the finals.
   That year, Los Angeles was plagued by injuries, a problem they
also had this year with starting guards Magic Johnson and Byron
Scott both sidelined.
   The loss by the Lakers marked the end of 42-year-old Kareem
Abdul-Jabbar's 20-year NBA career. The all-time leading scorer
finished with seven points after scoring 24 points in Game 3.

<HEAD>Dukakis Signs Bill For University To Take Over School District</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An unprecedented plan by Boston University to take
over the Chelsea public schools became law Tuesday as Gov. Michael
S. Dukakis signed a bill that offered new hope to the troubled
district, but raised union opposition.
   Chelsea, a city just northeast of Boston with one of the most
troubled school systems in Massachusetts, will receive new school
buildings, an infusion of money and the academic clout of BU. In
exchange the school committee will turn over management control of
the schools to the university for a decade.
   ``I want this effort to succeed. I think we all do,'' Dukakis
said. ``We're taking a step which will make it possible for it to
succeed.''
   The legislation calls for an oversight committee to ensure that
the university abides by state laws on public disclosure and open
meetings even though the contract between the university and Chelsea
exempts the university from extensive scrutiny.
   Both teachers and national union officials worried the agreement
would allow decisions about salaries and work rules behind closed
doors. The Chelsea teachers union has a pending lawsuit over public
disclosure and Hispanic parents on Tuesday challenged the plan
because they feel they were left out of the process.
   Chelsea, with 3,500 students, has a 17 percent drop-out rate, one
of the highest rates in the state. The teen pregnancy rate of 14
percent is the highest in the state and nearly half the city's
households earn less than $10,000 per year.
   Over the next decade, the university plans to provide innovative
education programs such as early childhood education, nutritional
counseling and mid-career teacher re-training.
   The university will also replace or upgrade buildings and infuse
$3 million per year to Chelsea's current $12 million school budget.

<TEXT>
   Leapin' Lizards! Little Orphan Annie is coming
back to Broadway in an all-new musical that picks up where the
original ``Annie'' left off.
   The show is called ``Annie 2'' and will arrive on Broadway next
March after tryouts in Washington and Boston.
   ``This story is not really as much a sequel as it is a
continuation,'' says Martin Charnin, lyricist and director of the
original ``Annie.'' He will perform the same duties for the new
musical.
   ``The first time we were telling the story about Annie's quest,
her need to find her parents,'' Charnin says. ``Now she's got Daddy
Warbucks and there is a different need _ to be protected from Miss
Hannigan.''
   Miss Hannigan, played in the original show by Dorothy Loudon, is
the villainous matron of the orphanage. The first musical ends with
her imprisonment and the adoption of Annie by the wealthy Daddy
Warbucks.
   ``In `Annie 2,' which takes place six weeks after the original,
Miss Hannigan is still in prison,'' Charnin says. ``Her one dream is
to wreak havoc on Annie and get revenge. She succeeds in doing just
that. But there are many other complications that will keep you on
the edge of your seat, I hope.''
   Its subtitle, of course, is ``Miss Hannigan's Revenge.''
   Miss Loudon will appear in the sequel but the rest of the cast
has not been set. Charnin and other members of the original
production team _ composer Charles Strouse and book writer Thomas
Meehan _ will audition little girls for the title role and for the
orphans in September in New York. They also will be looking for a
new dog to play Sandy, Annie's faithful canine companion.
   According to Charnin, the team is looking for girls under
4-foot-6 with ``good, rich voices and who can really dance,
especially tap.''
   The original ``Annie,'' based on the famous Harold Gray comic
strip, opened in New York in April 1977 and ran for nearly six years.
   Rehearsals for the new show begin in October, with a first
performance Dec. 14 at Washington's Kennedy Center Opera House where
the musical will play seven weeks, says Charnin. It will play Boston
for four weeks before coming to Broadway on March 8, 1990.
   The original ``Annie'' was budgeted at $800,000. ``Annie 2'' will
have a budget of $6 million to $7 million, says Lewis Allen, one of
the producers.

   Two more diplomats attached to the Chinese
consulate here may be considering asking for political asylum
because they don't want to inform on Chinese students, according to
a published report.
   The pair, a husband and wife who work in the education section of
the Consulate of the People's Republic of China, are staying with
friends in the San Francisco Bay area, despite being due back in
Beijing this week, according to a report in Wednesday editions of
the San Francisco Chronicle.
   Quoting sources close to the couple, who were not identified, the
paper said the diplomats had been expected to inform on Chinese
students engaged in U.S. protests here over the June 4 massacre of
demonstrators in Tiananmen Square.
   ``They don't want to provide a blacklist,'' said a friend of the
couple who was identified only as a student leader at nearby
Stanford University.
   Wang Shaohua, a spokesman for the consulate, denied the couple
might be considering defection.
   He said they left the consulate last week to ``live in a friend's
home'' for ``some time.'' He added that their move was ``quite a bit
unusual'' because the travel of communist consulate officials in the
United States is restricted.
   The newspaper said there were no documents on file at the State
Department about the couple's move, as would normally be required.
   Two other Chinese diplomats from the consulate sought FBI
protection Saturday night after announcing at a City Hall rally that
they planned to defect because of the Beijing government's
propaganda campaign, which claims no students were killed in the
crackdown on the country's pro-democracy movement.
   The Chinese government says nearly 300 people were killed, mostly
soldiers. However, Chinese witnesses and Western intelligence said
the toll could be as high as 3,000, most of them civilians.
   Zhou Li-ming, 26, vice consul for cultural affairs, and Zhang
Li-ming, 25, vice consul for overseas affairs, told the FBI that
they wanted to seek political asylum in the United States. They have
since gone into hiding and are reportedly reconsidering their
actions.
   The district office of the Immigration annd Naturalization
Service did not immediately return a phone call Tuesday night. An
FBI spokesman said the agency had not been contacted by any other
diplomats seeking asylum.

<HEAD>Brazil Sours on Alcohol Fuel, Says It Can't Afford Subsidies</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   At a time President Bush has urged
Americans help reduce air pollution by building cars that run on
alcohol, Brazil is ending a similar experiment because it has proven
so costly.
   Brazil in 1975 launched its Pro-Alcohol program and created
millions of alcohol-powered cars in the world's first large-scale
test of the fuel.
   The leaders of this oil-importing country believed the program
could mean not just greater energy independence but also big
savings. Alcohol is made from sugar cane, of which Brazil is a
leading producer.
   Today, however, the government is urging a return to
old-fashioned, polluting, gasoline engines.
   Burdened with a huge foreign debt and 1,000 percent inflation,
Brazil says it simply cannot afford to subsidize the $40-a-barrel
fuel.
   ``Pro-Alcohol is ... inflationary and consumes as much energy as
it produces,'' said Joao Augusto Gurgel, a longtime critic and the
owner of the Gurgel auto plant.
   In announcing measures to combat air pollution, Bush on Monday
offered incentives to the U.S. auto industry to build cars that run
on cleaner-burning fuels such as alcohol and natural gas.
   When Brazil's alcohol program started, alcohol was simply mixed
with gasoline at 22 percent to make gasohol.
   In 1979, the program got more ambitious. The first 2,271
pure-alcohol cars were produced. To compensate for poor mileage, the
government made alcohol 35 percent cheaper than gasoline and offered
tax breaks on the new cars.
   The incentives worked. Sales of alcohol cars shot up from 0.3
percent of total sales in 1979 to 28.5 percent the next year.
   By 1985, alcohol cars accounted for 96 percent of all autos sold.
Today, 3.7 million of Brazil's 12.9 million vehicles run on pure
alcohol.
   The alcohol industry grew with it. Distilleries today produce 3.2
billion gallons of alcohol a year, five times more than a decade ago.
   One of the benefits was less air pollution. Alcohol cars produce
half the carbon monoxide of gasoline-powered ones and no harmful
hydrocarbons.
   But Petrobras, the government oil monopoly, said it has spent
$649 million on alcohol subsidies since 1981.
   Worse, when it raised alcohol prices, the government had to raise
gasoline prices too to keep the 35 percent spread. The
merry-go-round of price increases added to inflation.
   Also, offshore oil fields were discovered in Brazil that made the
country less dependent on imports. Brazil now produces about 600,000
barrels a day, or about 55 percent of its oil needs.
   In May, world sugar prices rose, and many Brazilian cane growers
sold their harvests for sugar instead of alcohol. Service stations
in some cities simply ran out of the fuel.
   ``It was like we were on the Titanic approaching an iceberg, but
nobody believed it would hit _ and it did,'' said Petrobras
President Carlos Sant'Anna.
   The government immediately reduced the amount of alcohol in
gasohol to 18 percent and urged automakers to cut the number of
pure-alcohol cars produced to 50 percent of the total.
   Sales of alcohol cars slumped last month and owners of such
vehicles have lined up at mechanics to convert to gasoline.
   ``It was a shock for the market. Consumers felt cheated,'' said
Marcelo Bairao, spokesman for the Syndicate of Car Dealers and
Distributors in Sao Paulo state.
   The move back to gasoline will worsen air pollution in big
cities, environmentalists warn.
   ``The quality of air has improved. Now we're breathing better air
because there is less carbon monoxide, which is the principal
pollutant,'' said Alfred Szwarc, manager of the Vehicle Pollution
Control Department of Cetesb, Sao Paulo's environmental protection
agency.
   Szwarc said that despite other sources of pollution, such as the
widespread burning of the Amazon rain forest, the Pro-Alcohol
program has improved the air primarily in urban centers.
   Still, Brazil doesn't plan to abandon the alcohol program. And it
has its defenders.
   ``Just because we don't need it now, doesn't mean we should kill
it,'' said Luiz Avelar Scheuer, director of the local subsidiary of
Mercedez Benz. ``When a baby stops drinking milk, you don't get rid
of the cow. You could need butter later.''

   Interdiction efforts aren't keeping drugs out
of the United States. Federal agencies say they will, someday. But a
congressional researcher says that even if the borders were sealed,
the American people still would face a drug plague.
   What's a government to do?
   William J. Bennett, director of the Office of National Drug
Control Policy, says the United States must keep up the interdiction
pressure on all fronts _ air, land and sea.
   But as Bennett works on a national strategy for combating drug
abuse and the violence spawned by drug trafficking, he also is
accepting that much more must be done on prevention, education and
treatment.
   ``You don't abandon interdiction just because drugs are somehow
getting through,'' said Bennett spokesman Don Hamilton. ``You have
to do what you can to make the lives of traffickers more difficult.
...
   ``The whole strategy consists of doing everything, doing
everything smarter and everything better,'' Hamilton said.
   A report by the General Accounting Office, the research branch of
Congress, says drugs were found on only 10 percent of the planes
targeted for inspection through aerial interdiction, and that half
of those were ``controlled'' deliveries in which intelligence agents
knew in advance that the planes were bringing in drugs.
   Arnold P. Jones of the GAO stressed during testimony last week
before the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations that,
despite all interdiction efforts, the drug supply in the United
States is increasing, illustrated by an increase in purity of drugs
sold on the street, a decrease in price, and a hike in drug-related
emergency room treatments.
   Enforcement officials acknowledge that huge amounts of drugs are
still getting through, but say the interdiction efforts have other
benefits.
   Coast Guard Lt. Cmdr. James G. Simpson says that even if aerial
interdiction's success rate were just one out of 20 planes, ``that's
a great record.''
   For years, Simpson said, the Coast Guard ``putzed around the
Caribbean with two or three ships, and we came up with huge seizures
of marijuana. Eventually we put a lot of equipment down there and
seizures dropped.''
   Simpson said he views decreased seizures not as a failure but as
success, indicating that the drug traffickers have had to use other
routes that possibly cost more and pose more problems, such as using
individual overland couriers or hiding the drugs in cargo containers.
   Dick Weart of the U.S. Customs Service said a system of radar
balloons along the souther border is only partially completed, but
already ``land-border crossing seizures are up 500 to 600 percent.
More and more, we're getting containers with 5,000, 6,000, 7,000
pound loads.
   ``This indicates to me that they're moving toward less desirable
means of transporting their product,'' Weart said, explaining that
such modes are less desirable ``because they can't control it from
beginning to end like they can on a small plane.''
   But some say interdiction, no matter how dramatic some seizures
may seem, ultimately won't work, not only because foreign drug
traffickers will continue to get around barriers but because
domestic producers will fill any otherwise unmet demand.
   The head of the Senate investigations subcommittee, Sen. Sam
Nunn, D-Ga., and other panel members are frustrated by a lack of
information and direction on the issue, said a source on the
subcommittee staff.
   ``If we keep forcing them elsewhere, where does it end? Where
will they go next? Are you willing to seal off all the borders of
the United States?'' said the source, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   ``Even if you manage to seal a complete border around the United
States, what will that accomplish? ... We've had people tell us that
if the borders were sealed, within three days domestic labs will be
producing synthetic cocaine.''
   Hamilton of Bennett's office agreed that ``our salvation in the
drug war will not be hermetically sealed borders.'' He said that
while he was unaware of synthetic cocaine, domestic producers meet
U.S. demand for methamphetamine and PCP and provide 25 percent to 35
percent of the marijuana consumed here. In fact, marijuana is being
exported from this country, he said.
   ``There would be a drug problem in the United States even if the
border were sealed,'' Hamilton said. ``While some people do have a
drug of choice, many people simply want to get high.''
   Changing that, through drug abuse prevention, education and
treatment, will take a long time and won't be as headline-grabbing
as the seizure of mounds of cocaine or piles of drug money.
   ``Changing the behavior of people is a long-term process,'' Jones
said. ``I personally believe that to look for the light at the end
of the tunnel during the course of any administration does not do
justice to the enormity of the problem.''

<HEAD>Dixon Says No Connection Between Committee Job, Wife's Business</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House ethics committee chairman Julian Dixon
says there was no connection between his wife's share of a lucrative
Los Angeles airport concession and the $170,000 in legal fees his
committee paid the president of the Los Angeles Board of Airport
Commissioners.
   Dixon confirmed on Tuesday that the ethics committee hired
Johnnie L. Cochran, head of the airport board, three months after
the companies in which Mrs. Dixon has an interest were awarded the
concession to operate the airport stores.
   Dixon, D-Calif., said the two actions were unrelated.
   ``There was no connection,'' he said. ``I want to make this as
strong as I can ... no connection between the hiring and Mrs.
Dixon's business. I have never discussed with Johnnie Cochran
anything about Betty Dixon's business.''
   Cochran, a Los Angeles attorney, was paid $170,000 in 1986 and
1987 for legal work he did for the ethics committee which was then
looking into the personal finances of then-Rep. Fernand St Germain,
D-R.I., Dixon said.
   Dixon recently gained national exposure when he presided over the
ethics committee's investigation of Jim Wright, who resigned as
House speaker after the panel charged him with 69 violations of
House rules.
   Among other things, the committee said Wright's wife accepted
improper gifts from a wealthy Texas businessman, allegations Wright
denied.
   Dixon said Cochran, an ``outstanding lawyer,'' was hired by the
ethics panel ``based on his qualifications and the qualifications of
his law firm.''
   Cochran said he didn't know Mrs. Dixon was part of the airport's
duty-free concession until about a year ago.
   ``At no time did Julian and I ever talk about it'' until recent
weeks, said Cochran.
   Dixon amended his 1986 financial disclosure form on Monday,
showing that his wife paid between $5,000 and $15,000 for an
investment in two minority companies that have yielded dividends
totaling more than $150,000 in 1987 and 1988. The companies help
operate the duty-free and gift shops at the Los Angeles
International Airport.
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., said Tuesday that he
doesn't know of anything improper in Mrs. Dixon's business
arrangement.
   Foley, who recently succeeded Wright as the ranking Democrat in
the House, made his comments Tuesday in response to questions about
Dixon's handling of his financial disclosure forms.
   ``As far as I know, there is no impropriety of any kind, and the
refiling is in accordance with the rules,'' Foley said.
   Two months after the House committee retained Cochran on Feb. 5,
1986, the Los Angeles airport board awarded a concession to run
seven duty-free stores at the airport to a joint venture headed by
Duty Free Shoppers Inc. of San Francisco.
   At that time _ April 1986 _ Cochran was president of the airport
board. He is no longer president, but remains on the five-member
board.
   In July 1986, Mrs. Dixon bought a 12 percent interest in two
companies in the joint venture _ Mir Kanon Inc., listed as a
minority enterprise, and Peideau Inc., listed as a female-run
business.
   California state records show that the two companies had
identical boards of directors as of September 1988.
   City policies required that minority and female-run businesses be
part of any concession handed out by the airport. Airport officials
now are examining the contracts to make sure they meet the intent of
the city's minority contracting policy.
   Duty Free Shoppers said Mir Kanon and Peideau make up 32 percent
of the concession for the seven duty-free shops, and 18 percent of
the concession for the 18 gift and news shops at the international
airport, the third-busiest in the world.

   A man armed with a rifle killed three
residents then shot himself to death in a domestic dispute Tuesday
night, authorities said.
   Ettrie Lavon Gaskins, 48, died at McLeod Regional Medical Center
``apparently of self-inflicted gunshot wounds,'' said hospital
spokesman Eston Clark.
   Gaskins was at his home when he reportedly argued with his
step-daughter about taking her sick child to a doctor, said Florence
County Sheriff William C. Barnes.
   The argument moved to a neighbor's trailer across the street,
where Gaskins became enraged and shot and killed three residents of
the trailer _ Mrs. Bobbie Ledbetter, her son Robert Ledbetter and
her daughter Wanda Ledbetter, the sheriff said.
   Another son, Richard Ledbetter, 19, was in critical condition at
McLeod with multiple gunshot wounds, said Clark. Gaskins and Richard
Ledbetter were the only victims brought to McLeod, Clark said.
   Gaskins' wife also suffered a seizure following the 10:15 p.m.
shootings, Barnes said. Her name, location and condition were not
immediately available.

<HEAD>Conservative Re-elected President of Southern Baptists</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRIGGS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A conservative was re-elected president of the
Southern Baptist Convention, dashing moderates' hopes that an
election outside the Bible Belt would help their candidate.
   Jerry Vines, the pastor of First Baptist Church of Jacksonville,
Fla., won 56.5 percent of the vote Tuesday in defeating his moderate
challenger, Daniel Vestal, pastor of Dunwoody Baptist Church in
suburban Atlanta.
   ``I'm just convinced the joy bells are going to begin ringing in
the Southern Baptist Convention,'' said Vines, who continued a
conservative resurgence in the nation's largest Protestant
denomination.
   Vines received 10,754 votes to 8,248 for Vestal. It was the 11th
straight victory for conservative candidates since 1979.
   Vestal said he was disappointed, but already considering another
run for the presidency at next year's convention in New Orleans.
   ``I fear a kind of militant partisanship in this denominatiion,''
he said.
   But Vines said the appointment Tuesday of Richard Jackson, a
Phoenix pastor who opposed Vines for the presidency last year, to
the Home Mission Board was part of his effort to bring a `kinder,
gentler denomination to pass.''
   More than 20,000 delegates registered for the three-day
convention that opened Tuesday morning.
   Moderates, who came within 700 votes of defeating Vines last
year, had hoped the convention site would help their cause. Some
conservatives stayed home in protest of the convention being held in
a city with legalized gambling.
   Hal Lane, editor of Southern Baptist Issues, a conservative
publication based in South Carolina, said Vines' victory ``was
extremely important, almost critical, because we had a site
offensive to so many conservatives. It was a year we felt could have
gone either way.''
   Conservatives counted on the power of the incumbency. No
incumbent president seeking a second one-year term has lost in
recent years.
   Stan Hastey, executive director of the Southern Baptist Alliance,
a moderate group, said the election ``continues the losing streak,
without demoralizing moderates.''
   But Richard Land, executive director of the Christian Life
Commission, said the string of conservative victories should force
moderates ``to rethink their thesis, which is that the real Southern
Baptist Convention has not been heard from.''
   Both Vines and Vestal believe the Bible is without error, but
their different approaches to doctrinal issues reflected the
divisions within the 14.8 million-member denomination.
   Vestal said conservatives have run roughshod over the central
Baptist belief in the priesthood of the believer, or that Christians
are able to interpret the Bible for themselves.
   But Vines and other conservatives contend there is a need to set
stricter parameters on theological teachings to preserve
denominational unity on central tenants of faith.
   Moderates have shown increasing strength in recent years, winning
elections at the state level in Texas, Georgia, North Carolina,
South Carolina, Virginia and Tennessee.
   The Southern Baptist Convention more than doubled in size in the
past 25 years to surpass a declining United Methodist Church as the
nation's largest Protestant denomination, but has grown by barely
more than half a percent each of the last two years, the lowest
growth rate since 1937.

   A granite marker will soon join the tree
President Bush planted near the state Capitol in April.
   The Capitol Grounds Planning Commission gave permission Tuesday
for the 3-foot plaque to be cemented near the tree, making it the
first raised marker to be allowed on the land immediately adjacent
to the North Dakota Capitol.
   Bush planted the 12-foot American elm in honor of North Dakota's
centennial on April 24 in a ceremony that attracted an estimated
10,000 people.
   The tree, a descendant of a tree planted by John Quincy Adams,
had been uprooted from the White House grounds. But tests later
confirmed it carried leaf-eating gypsy moths and had to be sprayed.

<HEAD>Mexico's President Promises To `Make Life Impossible For Drug Traffickers'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD HERZFELDER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Carlos Salinas de Gortari promises
to ``make life impossible for drug traffickers'' because of their
corrosive effect on society, but says Mexico cannot be expected to
halt the drug trade by itself.
   ``It worries me that it (drug use and drug trafficking) doesn't
show signs of diminishing as a world trend,'' Salinas said during an
interview Tuesday with executives and members of The Associated
Press.
   On other issues, Salinas emphasized the importance of ongoing
negotiations to reduce Mexico's $107.4 billion foreign debt, denied
opposition claims that his Institutional Revolutionary Party plans
to steal July 2 state elections and said political solutions are
needed in Central America.
   ``I would have liked to have gone faster on the debt front,''
said Salinas, who spoke in English. He said debt reduction talks
were difficult because ``banks look at their balance sheets and we
have to respond to social pressures.''
   He said he expected the complex negotiations to take ``weeks,
maybe months,'' but said Mexico must resume economic growth to feed
its population, raise living standards and create jobs. ``There is
not much time,'' he said.
   Salinas said Mexicans have lost 50 percent of their buying power
in the years of austerity since the oil boom ended in 1982. He said
he feared a turn to more radical solutions if his program for
opening up the economy and encouraging the free market and private
investment does not work.
   ``Populists will always present solutions without costs,'' said
Salinas.
   Mexico will spend about $16 billion this year to service its
foreign debt. Economic analysts have said a debt agreement must be
reached before Mexico runs out of foreign exchange, and some have
said they expected a pact within two weeks.
   Drug trafficking and corruption that protects traffickers are a
major bone of contention in U.S.-Mexico relations. Mexicans believe
the real problem is immense demand in the United States and say they
are pleased the United States is beginning to do something about it.
   ``We will not end drug trafficking by fighting it in Mexico,''
said Salinas, calling for an international effort to combat the
problem.
   Salinas said the drug trade and corruption are threats to
Mexico's national security and that drug use is a danger to
Mexicans' health.
   ``If we don't stop it now it will have a corrosive effect on our
social relations,'' Salinas said. ``We don't want our children to be
tied in the web of drugs.''
   Later in the day, the federal attorney general's office announced
the seizure of more than four tons of cocaine and the arrests of 28
people in a two-state operation it described as the country's
biggest drug haul since Salinas took office.
   In the interview's most emotional moment, Salinas described how
he recently inspected several historic artifacts that had been
stolen from the Museum of Anthropology and recovered.
   ``I was able for the first and last time in my life to touch
them,'' he said, ``and it's really something that goes deep into
your skin.''
   He said the artifacts were a symbol of the continuity of Mexican
culture in the modern world.
   ``We've taken this step of opening the economy because we have a
strong culture,'' he said. ``When you come from a civilization that
was able to build and create with such tremendous artistic ability
and devotion, you can open yourself with confidence.''
   Salinas said his greatest accomplishment since taking office Dec.
1 has been to foster a positive attitude among Mexicans.
   ``I find today Mexicans are willing to make the added effort that
is required for change in our country because they know it will mean
an improvement,'' said Salinas, who despite a weak electoral mandate
has taken a series of bold strokes against corruption and economic
inefficiency.
   He said political solutions are needed in Central America, adding
that those countries too need to grow and ``growth won't come with
military tension.'' He said Central American economic problems might
result in increased migration to both Mexico and the United States.
   Salinas said Mexico would stick to its principles of
non-intervention and respect for self-determination with regard to
Panama, although he remains critical of Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega's rule.
   On other issues, he said his administration is pushing for a more
open relationship between church and state and plans to increase
investment in education. ``Without education, growth will not be
permanent,'' he said.
   Salinas said political opponents on the left and right who claim
elections continue to be unfair ``are not looking at the present.
It's more rhetoric than something we have in reality.''

<HEAD>Marilyn Monroe Double Found Dead in Similar Circumstances as Actress</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHATHAM, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 24-eyar-old British model who made a
career out of impersonating Marilyn Monroe has been found dead in
circumstances similar to the death of the Hollywood actress.
   A lodger found the nude body of Kay Kent dead on her bed Monday
night in a row house in this town 34 miles southeast of London,
authorities said. Sleeping tablets were found near the body.
   Miss Kent earned $90,000 a year, mostly from TV and restaurant
and store advertising, by serving as a double for the film star.
   Ms. Monroe was found dead in her bungalow near Hollywood in 1962
with an empty bottle of sleeping tablets beside her.
   Authorities said a half-empty bottle of vodka and photographs of
Ms. Monroe also were scattered across the bed. Stills of the
actress, books about her and Ms. Monroe's voice recordings filled
the room.
   Her brother, Jay, 27, told a reporter: ``She was so involved in
her Marilyn image that she couldn't help herself from dying just
like her idol.''
   ``I don't know why she killed herself. She had hundreds of people
around her. Maybe she died of loneliness,'' he said.
   Miss Kent left a note for a childhood sweetheart, Dean Hammond, a
28-year-old rock singer, that began: ``Dear Dean, I love you so very
much.''
   Relatives said Tuesday the remainder of the note was so scrawled
they could not read the words, except for the final ``Love Kay.''
   They said they were certain the model killed herself.
   Miss Kent was a well-known face in the British tabloids and on
TV. Her mother had died three months ago and then her relationship
with Hammond broke up.

<HEAD>Rescue Team Recovers Seven Bodies, Find Four Other Victims of Crash</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONOKAA, Hawaii (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rescue workers descended down ropes from a
helicopter to recover the bodies of seven of the 11 people who died
when a sightseeing plane crashed into a steep valley wall.
   County firefighters and national park rangers found the bodies of
the other four passengers, but the recovery was suspended at
nightfall Tuesday. They planned to return to the remote site this
morning.
   The twin-engine Beechcraft slammed into an 1,800-foot high wall
at the back of Waipio Valley on Hawaii Island, shortly after taking
off Sunday from Hilo Airport en route to Kahului on the island of
Maui. There were no survivors.
   The wreckage of the plane was spread over a 300-foot-long,
fire-scarred swath in the thick vegetation. It was found just after
dawn Tuesday by helicopters that tracked the signal from the plane's
emergency locator transmitter.
   Heavy rains and low clouds had prevented aircraft from searching
the area Monday.
   ``Most of it was all disintegrated,'' said Hawaii County Deputy
Fire Chief Edward Bumatay. ``The biggest part they could find was
the engine down in the bottom of the valley.''
   The bodies were taken Tuesday night to Hilo Hospital, where work
was to begin on identification, said Bruce Butts, operations officer
for the county Civil Defense Agency.
   Eight of the 10 passengers were identified late Tuesday as Peter
Spillane and Ann Herbert, both of Sydney, Australia; Jack Merle and
Shirley Merle of Russellville, Ark.; a Ms. Statler of Blue Mound,
Ill.; Sylvie Martel and Nicole Beland of Canada; and Robert Wren,
61, an English professor at the University of Houston.
   Two women whose names were withheld pending the notification of
their families were from Torrance, Calif., and New York City, said
T.C. Campbell, operations manager for Scenic Air Tours Hawaii, the
carrier.
   The plane's pilot, Pascal Meric, 28, of Honolulu, had about 4,000
hours flying experience, said Doug Rogers, chief pilot for Scenic
Air Tours.
   The crash was the first in the company's nine-year history.
   A National Transportation Safety Board team was expected to begin
an investigation today into the cause of the crash.
   It was Hawaii's fourth major airline accident in two years.
   In December 1987, a twin-engine Panorama Air Tours plane with
eight people aboard disappeared during a flight from Honolulu to
Molokai Island.
   In April 1988, a flight attendant died and dozens were injured
when the front third of the top section of an Aloha Airlines jet's
passenger cabin blew away in flight.
   In February, nine passengers were hurled to their deaths when a
cargo door and a huge chunk of fuselage tore off a United Airlines
jumbo jet some 100 miles south of Honolulu.

<HEAD>Crime Spiraling Under Gorbachev Reforms, Officials Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAREY GOLDBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gangs taking advantage of relaxed controls under
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reform programs have contributed to
a 32 percent rise in the Soviet crime rate since January, officials
say.
   Gorbachev has acknowledged that the restructuring he initiated
since coming to power four years ago could lead to more crime.
   Maj. Gen. Anatoly Smirnov of the Interior Ministry told a Moscow
news conference Tuesday that ``the relaxation of discipline'' and
shortages in basic commodities had fueled an increase in murder and
other serious crimes.
   Official figures show street crime increased over the same
five-month period in 1988 by 83 percent, property crimes by 53
percent and murder by 26 percent, Smirnov said.
   Nine Soviet policemen were killed in clashes with criminals in
May alone.
   Shortages that have worsened steadily under economic experiments
begun in recent years have created a demand for stolen goods that
spurs robbers on, according to the Smirnov.
   He said the country's rail, air and river transport systems have
become increasingly crime-ridden, especially with robbery and
mugging.
   The ministry also noticed a ``rise in the aggressiveness of
certain citizens,'' the general said.
   One crime-fighting experiment has shown good results, Smirnov
said. In the Russian city of Gorky, where two policemen were
murdered this winter and residents were afraid to leave home at
night, creation of workers' militias to back up police cut the crime
rate's growth by 38 percent.
   Gorbachev told Communist Party leaders in a speech this spring
that they should keep in mind that ``any extension of democracy and
humanization of life should go parallel with an uncompromising
struggle against criminal elements.''
   Police Col. Alexander Gurov estimated that more than a dozen
major crime networks exist in the U.S.S.R., but he said Tuesday that
there was no organization there on the scale of the Cosa Nostra, a
reference to organized crime in the United States.
   ``The Cosa Nostra would go broke within a week here,'' Gurov
said. ``The bureaucracy would smother it'' because the bribes it
would have to pay to get offices and basic supplies would prove
prohibitive.
   Police Col. Gennady Chebotarev said Tuesday that organized crime
got its start in the massive ``shadow economy'' of theft,
embezzlement and unofficial wheeling-and-dealing that has thrived
since the 1970's.
   More than 1,000 organized crime groups are uncovered every year,
often groups of more than 100 people _ frequently former athletes _
who stake out territory and demand protection money, Chebotarev said.
   He said organized groups of criminals have also begun to foster
ties with international crime, particularly with computer imports,
antiques, gold and jewels. Computers are in heavy demand in the
Soviet Union, and speculators can make huge profits by buying and
selling even relatively cheap computers.

<HEAD>Human Rights Group: Guatemala Death Squads Keep Killing Under Civil
Rule</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Despite Guatemala's pledge to end political
killings, the military and police keep operating death, torture and
abduction squads, Amnesty International said today.
   The London-based human rights organization said it has reports of
222 people who have disappeared since President Vinicio Cerezo's
civil administration in 1986 took over after 20 years of military
rule.
   ``Although the number of abuses decreased initially, there has
been a resurgence of abductions, `disappearances' and extra-judicial
executions in the past 18 months,'' the report said.
   It added that many of the abuses, which include murder and
mutilation, are carried out by ``police and military agents both
while in uniform and while in plain clothes in the guise of the
so-called death squads.''
   Cerezo, a centrist Christian Democrat, took power pledging to end
political killings, intimidation and other abuses of previous
military governments.
   An Amnesty International spokeswoman said Cerezo, who put down an
attempted military coup last month, was not apparently directly
involved in the death squads, but his government failed to
investigate the killings.
   ``We know that the army is running some of these squads,'' said
researcher Tracey Ulltveit-Moe, who drew up the report. ``There may
be some government officials involved, but we don't think to the
same extent as when there was military rule.''
   She said Cerezo has become ``a useful front for the military ...
he has been more successful in convincing some potential donors that
the police and military have cleaned up their act.''
   Wealth is concentrated with a military-backed business and
landowning minority. The impoverished majority are mainly Mayan
Indian peasants.
   The report said peasants, labor unionists, clergy, academics and
students _ usually people the government saw as left-wing _ ``have
been singled out particularly'' by the men in white ``death vans.''
   Among the victims cited in the report were a labor unionist and a
law student whose bodies were found on the outskirts of Guatemala
City in March 1988 with their hands cut off, apparently to prevent
identification.
   Power union official Manuel de Jesus Lopez Morales and student
Jose Derick Calderon Figueroa had been abducted separately 10 days
earlier, the report said.
   Another victim, former economics student Ana Paniagua, was
grabbed by armed men in plainclothes before terrified witnesses in
February 1988, beaten up and taken away in a white van, said the
report.
   Her body was found two days later with stab wounds and her throat
slashed, it said.
   Charging that Cerezo failed to investigate, the report said that
in March 1988 a judge due to try treasury police agents linked to
the ``death van murders'' was kidnapped and held hostage for 52
hours.
   ``Those arrested ... were later released `for lack of
evidence,''' said Amnesty International.
   It said Cerezo has not replied to its letters urging
investigations of the reported abuses.

   The dollar, which soared this week to 22-month
highs, today declined slightly against the Japanese yen, while share
prices rebounded from their downswing of recent sessions.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which lost
241.97 points the previous day, rose 189.44 points, or 0.57 percent,
closing today's trading at 33,402.99.
   The index fell nearly 30 points in the morning session, but rose
in the afternoon as investors bought issues related to environmental
protection following news that the United States has decided on
tougher environmental policies.
   The dollar closed at 148.05 yen, down 0.65 yen from Tuesday's
close of 148.70 yen. The currency opened at 148.20 and ranged
between 147.65 yen and 148.40 yen. It had gained 4.90 yen on Monday
and 0.30 yen on Tuesday.
   While the market awaited announcement of the Japanese wholesale
price index and U.S. trade figures, the dollar edged down following
comments by the central bank governor and news that the Finance
Ministry had requested restrictions on investment in dollar bonds,
said Toru Kanai, a foreign exchange analyst with New Japan
Securities Co.
   Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita said the dollar's current
strength might lead to higher Japanese prices if it is prolonged,
but that the central bank does not anticipate the dollar will
maintain its current high levels very long.
   He told a regular news conference that the dollar's strength ``is
clearly overdone'' and that Japan would continue cooperation with
other Group of Seven industrialized nations to check the U.S.
currency's rise.
   He said large-scale intervention Tuesday by the U.S. Federal
Reserve indicated it also saw the dollar as too strong.
   Kanai said, ``The Bank of Japan reportedly intervened in the
market today, but it didn't affect today's trading at all.'' The
central bank does not comment on its monetary activities.
   Japanese investors' demand for the dollar is still strong, Kanai
said, and the ``majority of market players seem to be trying to
raise the dollar to the 150-yen mark, or even higher.''
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, Nomura Securities analyst Masahiro
Umemori said trading was thin because many investors were cautiously
awaiting major economic indicators, but the market's recent
downtrend has halted.
   The Japanese wholesale price index for May was to be Friday, and
U.S. trade figures for April were to announced Thursday.
   Trading was thin, with first section volume estimated at 450
million shares, down from Tuesday's 500 million.

   Ramon Salcido appeared to implicate
himself in the slayings of his wife, two daughters and four others
in a telephone conversation, a newspaper reported.
   Salcido, who is awaiting trial on charges of murder, did not
directly admit to the slayings in a call to The Press Democrat of
Santa Rosa on Tuesday night, the newspaper said.
   ``I want to tell all these people, sometimes you do things when
you're on drugs and alcohol. It wasn't me who did that, it was the
drugs,'' the newspaper quoted him as saying in today's editions.
   Former associates of Salcido have told reporters that he was out
drinking and using cocaine the night before the April 14 killings.
   In a subdued voice, the 28-year-old former winery worker said he
has no hope for himself but wants it known that he is not the killer
described as ``deranged'' by the local sheriff.
   ``I can accept the death penalty because I love my family,''
Salcido said in a call from Sonoma County Jail. ``I trust my Lord.''
   Salcido is charged with the deaths of his wife and two daughters;
his mother-in-law; his wife's two sisters; and his former supervisor
at Grand Cru winery. Sonoma County District Attorney Gene Tunney has
said he will seek the death penalty.
   Salcido was captured in Mexico. He confessed to the killings on
television there and videotape of the confession was played in the
United States.
   But the newspaper reported that Salcido claimed he was forced to
confess, although he said he doesn't remember what he said.
   ``Nothing was true,'' he was quoted as saying. ``They beat me up,
held a gun to my head. They beat up my face and head. I was nervous
all the time.''
   Videotape and photos of Salcido taken after his arrest and during
his televised interviews in Mexico showed no sign of facial injuries.
   Salcido previously called The Press Democrat on May 22 to thank
the person who found his surviving daughter, Carmina, whose throat
had been cut, and to say that a letter was on its way to the
newspaper.
   The letter was seized at the jail by sheriff's deputies at the
order of the district attorney's office because of concerns that it
violated a court gag order forbidding everyone connected with the
case _ including Salcido _ from discussing it with the media.
   It was not immediately clear whether Salcido's telephone call
violated the order. Editors at The Press Democrat said they could
not immediately comment on the question.
   Salcido, kept in an isolation cell under a 24-hour suicide watch,
also complained about his life in jail.
   ``I want to live like other people'' in the jail, he said. ``I'm
a normal person.''
   Salcido said he spends most of his time reading the Bible,
newspapers and books and praying.

<TEXT>
   This exclusive oceanfront community
dropped a plan to put surveillance cameras on four bridges into town
after the police chief said the crime-fighting idea was unworkable.
   ``We can't continue to build fortresses and barriers around
ourselves,'' Police Chief Joseph Terlizzese said Tuesday, before the
Town Council voted to abandon the idea. ``Next thing you know, we'll
be building machine-gun nests.''
   In his report, Terlizzese said it was questionable whether the
pictures would be good enough to identify drivers of vehicles.
   Besides, Terlizzese said, crime in Palm Beach is not that bad.
Last year, the city's crime rate dropped 12.5 percent, he said.
   ``We're doing extremely well considering that some of our targets
are more attractive than those in neighboring communities _ without
mentioning names,'' the police chief said.
   Palm Beach, where developer Donald Trump and the Kennedy clan
have homes, lies across Lake Worth from West Palm Beach, which
includes high-crime areas.
   The cameras, which would cost between $250,000 and $500,000, were
suggested by a resident.

   The dollar today eased in early European trading,
and foreign currency dealers attributed it to aggressive dollar
sales by the U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banks on Tuesday.
   Gold prices rose.
   Dealers said the market was quiet while waiting for several U.S.
economic indicators that can determine the dollar's near-term
course, particularly April's trade figures to be released Thursday.
   ``We're trading in a narrow range and there isn't any trend,''
said a trader at a large Frankfurt bank.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar finished down 0.65 yen at 148.05. Later, in London, it
was quoted at 148.50 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Tuesday:
   _2.0200 West German marks, down from 2.0260
   _1.7475 Swiss francs, down from 1.7520
   _6.8633 French francs, down from 6.8675
   _2.2713 Dutch guilders, down from 2.2758
   _1,462.50 Italian lire, up from 1,459.25
   _1.1990 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2007
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost
$1.5202 to buy one pound, compared with $1.5162 late Tuesday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $361.75 a troy ounce,
compared with late Tuesday's $359.50. At midmorning, the city's five
major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $361.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $361.60, up from $358.75 late
Tuesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose 74 cents to close at a bid
$362.40.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $5.25 a troy ounce,
up from Tuesday's $5.20.

<TEXT>
   Mikhail S. Gorbachev, buoyed by an
outpouring of goodwill and a new friendship pact with West Germany,
flew to this high-tech stronghold today in search of expertise to
advance his reforms.
   The Soviet leader and his wife, Raisa, were greeted upon arrival
at Echterdingen airport by Badem-Wuerttemberg state's popular
governor, Lothar Spaeth, rumored to be a challenger to Chancellor
Helmut Kohl in next year's federal elections.
   Gorbachev was to tour a high-technology exhibit at Stuttgart
University and meet with the political and industrial leaders of
Baden-Wuerttemberg, one of West Germany's most prosperous states.
   On Tuesday, he appealed for close integration of the West German
and Soviet economies to make the countries' improving relations
``more quake-resistant.''
   Addressing West German business leaders at the Cologne Stock
Exchange, the Soviet president challenged them to invest in large
Soviet projects rather than ``trifles.''
   West Germany is the Soviet Union's largest Western trading
partner, but Gorbachev said the level of trade is small compared to
the possibilities.
   He also called on the West to lift restrictions on
high-technology transfers. Gorbachev is seeking advanced Western
technology and know-how to rebuild Soviet industry and keep his
promise that reform will bring average Soviets a better life.
   West Germany's most powerful banker has warned that it could take
up to two decades to reform the Soviet economy, which is plagued by
consumer shortages and shoddy goods.
   ``But precisely because it will take so long, there is a need to
start immediately and steadfastly pursue the reform efforts,''
Deutsche Bank chairman Alfred Herrhausen said in a television
interview Monday night.
   His four-day visit, which ends Thursday, has been marked by a
desire on both sides for a fresh start in Soviet-German relations
and cooperation between the historical adversaries in pursuit of
European unity.
   Gorbachev, who is immensely popular among West Germans, has been
greeted by cheering crowds of thousands during the visit.
   While the Soviet Union clearly hopes the summit will yield deeper
economic ties with West Germany and other Western nations, officials
on both sides have stressed that they are part of a broad strategy
endorsed on Tuesday.
   The document spells out common objectives for improving security
and ensuring peace, and it stresses other nations should not fear
closer ties between Moscow and Bonn.
   It proclaims their desire for ``a common European home in which
the United States and Canada have their place'' and where all
nations exist in ``peaceful competition with one another.''
   In an address at a state dinner at Augustusburg Castle outside
Bonn, Gorbachev predicted, ``Our cooperation can serve as a catalyst
for new relations between the whole of East and West.''
   Government spokesman Hans Klein described the declaration signed
by Gorbachev and Chancellor Helmut Kohl as a ``turning point'' in
Soviet-West German relations.
   The declaration reiterates the aim of cutting strategic nuclear
weapons by 50 percent and completely eliminating chemical weapons.
   The accord also states support for the 1972 Anti-Ballistic
Missile Treaty signed by both superpowers, which is seen by the
Soviets and West Germans as a ban on development of the ``Star
Wars'' space defense advocated by former President Reagan.
   It carefully avoids reference to the main point of contention in
arms control between NATO and the Warsaw Pact, the issue of how to
go about reducing short-range nuclear weapons.
   Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov, at a news
briefing with Klein, said Gorbachev had deemed the declaration the
reward of ``a long path of searching over many years.''
   Eleven agreements were signed by ministers from both countries
during the ceremony at Kohl's office Tuesday.
   They included establishing a ``hot line'' between Moscow and
Bonn, as well as new declarations on human rights, and cultural and
student exchanges.

   Fran Allison, the warmhearted foil for two
goofy puppets in TV's ``Kukla, Fran and Ollie'' show and pioneer for
some of today's most popular children's programs, has died at the
age of 81.
   Death was blamed on bone marrow failure, an inability to produce
sufficient numbers of white and red blood cells, said Sherman Oaks
Community Hospital spokeswoman Johna Rogovin.
   ``Fran was a bridge character between the audience and the puppet
characters,'' Muppets creator Jim Henson said of Miss Allison, who
died Tuesday.
   ``You have a person who takes those characters as real, and that
helps make the characters more believable,'' said Henson, who called
the ``Kukla, Fran &amp; Ollie'' show ``my major influence in terms of
puppetry.''
   ``We have continued to use that technique,'' Henson said of the
realism Miss Allison brought to the show.
   She worked as a singer and radio personality in shows originating
from Chicago during the 1930s and '40s, and was well known for her
role as the gossipy Aunt Fanny on ``Don McNeill's Breakfast Club.''
   The actress joined Burr Tillstrom's popular puppet show,
originally known as ``Junior Jamboree,'' when it began on local
television in Chicago in 1947.
   ``It was a delight working with him from the very first moment,''
Miss Allison recalled after Tillstrom died in 1985.
   The program, featuring Tillstrom's ``Kuklapolitan Players,''
emerged from the early age of television to become one of TV's
longest-running children's programs.
   ``Kukla, Fran &amp; Ollie'' ran nationally from 1948 to 1957 and
later appeared on public television and in syndication during the
1960s and '70s, going off the air for good in 1976.
   Miss Allison co-starred with a bald, gentle clown named Kukla and
an exuberant bucktoothed serpent, Oliver J. Dragon.
   She essentially played herself, a Chicago singer and actress who
appeared in front of the puppet stage, and whose concern, joy and
infinite patience for her co-stars enthralled millions of young
viewers.
   ``She was so honest, I think that was what made it work so
well,'' said Jon Stone, a ``Sesame Street'' creator and producer at
the Children's Television Workshop. ``She took the puppets at face
value.''
   Peggy Charren, president of Action for Children's Television,
said she is beginning a June 20 seminar on children's television at
the Museum of Broadcasting in New York with clips from the show.
   ``I am using it as an example of the concern that the broadcast
industry used to have for children and their families,'' Ms. Charren
said. ``It was one of those wonderful ideas that happens rarely,
when something that appeals to children also appeals to adults.''
   Miss Allison was born in LaPorte City, Iowa, in 1907, said her
niece, Nan Calvin.
   She is survived by her brother, Lynn Allison. Her husband of 35
years, Archie Levington, died in 1978.
   A memorial is scheduled Saturday in suburban Sherman Oaks with
burial to follow in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, Ms. Calvin said.

<TEXT>
   Showers drenched much of the South today, with thunderstorms
hovering over Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas and Tennessee after a
violent night of weather that included lightning, hail, damaging
winds and a tornado.
   The thunderstorms lingered ahead of a slow moving cold front
curving through the south-central United States.
   In southwest Texas, a thunderstorm spawned a tornado northeast of
Sanderson late Tuesday evening; another storm whipped up winds in
Pecos County, overturning a car in Sheffield.
   Also in Texas, golfball-sized hail pounded northeast Reklaw, and
Overton was hit with 1-inch hail. Lightning started a house fire in
Price, as well as an oil tank fire in Rusk County.
   In Louisiana, storm winds gusted to 49 mph at Shreveport; and
trees were downed by the stiff winds west of Bellevue. Two inches of
rain fell on Blanchard in 30 minutes, causing some lowland flooding.
   Showers and thunderstorms swept over much of south-central and
eastern Texas early today. Showers and thunderstorms also extended
from northern Louisiana and southern Arkansas to western Tennessee.
   Earlier, thunderstorms in eastern Texas dumped 5 inches of rain
at New London, and 4{ inches of rain at Henderson. Flooding was
reported around Karnack after it was deluged by 3{ inches of rain.
   Elsewhere around the country, a few showers and thunderstorms
were moving along a cold front crossing the central Plains region
and the middle Mississippi Valley. Showers also edged ahead of a
cold front nearing the northern Pacific Coast.
   Dense fog blanketed parts of eastern Wisconsin and northeastern
Ohio early today. But much of the southeastern United States enjoyed
clear skies.
   Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms for much of
the Atlantic Coast states across the Great Lakes region, the Ohio
and Tennessee valleys, the Gulf Coast states, the Mississippi Valley
and the southern Plains to New Mexico; numerous showers and
thunderstorms over the upper Ohio Valley; and showers along the
Pacific Northwest.
   High temperatures were forecast in the 50s and 60s from the upper
Mississippi Valley to the Great Lakes region; in the 60s over the
northern and central Great Plains, eastern New England, and along
the Pacific Coast; reaching the 90s over the south Atlantic coastal
states, eastern portions of the Gulf Coast region, extreme southern
Texas and interior valleys of California; 100 along the Rio Grande
Valley of southwest Texas, with 110 temperatures in the desert
Southwest; and in the 70s and 80s across much of the rest of the
nation.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 38
degrees at Gillette, Wyo., to 93 degrees at Phoenix, Ariz.

   Authorities arrested the former chief of a
federal police agency in the 1984 slaying of a crusading newspaper
columnist. Gunshots and tear gas were fired before he gave up, a
domestic news service said today.
   Police exchanged gunfire with Jose Antonio Zorrilla Perez outside
his home and one officer was wounded, the Excelsior news service
reported.
   Authorities had issued a warrant Sunday for Zorrilla's arrest in
the fatal shooting of Manuel Buendia, a vocal critic of corruption
in government. No formal charges or details on a court hearing had
been announced by early today.
   Police called for reinforcements and soon more than 70 uniformed
officers and about 50 vehicles surrounded the residence.
   Local news reports said District Attorney Ignacios Morales
Lechuga arrived about a half hour later and the men talked inside
the residence before Zorrilla gave up.
   Morales Lechuga said in a statement that he met with Zorrilla and
drove him to Morales' office, where he was arrested. He did not
mention the confrontation.
   The government news agency Notimex said Juventino Prado, a
commander with the Mexico City Police Department's intelligence
division and a former lieutenant under Zorrilla, was hospitalized on
Tuesday with a nervous breakdown.
   According to investigators in the case, Prado accompanied
Zorrilla when he arrived at the scene within minutes of the May 30,
1984, shooting, Notimex said.
   From 1981 to mid-1984, the 49-year-old Zorrilla headed the
Federal Security Department, a now defunct agency that was similiar
to the FBI.
   In an interview on television Monday night, Morales Lechuga had
identified Buendia as the ``intellectual author'' of the slaying.
Authorities have refused to comment on a possible motive.
   Lechuga has said officials have identified the person who pulled
the trigger, but that naming the gunman would hurt the
investigation. No other arrests have been mentioned in the case.
   Authorities on Sunday began a nationwide manhunt for Zorrilla and
brought in Interpol, the international police agency.
   Buendia, a front-page columnist for the newspaper Excelsior and
the author of several books that tackled sensitive targets like
official corruption, drug and weapons trafficking and the CIA, was
gunned down in a downtown parking garage.
   Zorrilla has long been suspected of concealing evidence and
intimidating witnesses.
   In May, Proceso magazine published an extensive report on the
case that said the Union of Democratic Journalists had evidence that
Zorrilla's agents had been following Buendia for more than three
months before his death.
   Zorrilla met with Buendia three times in the month before the
slaying, including the night before the fatal shooting, Proceso said.
   Authorities declined to say what motive Zorrilla might have had
for wanting to have Buendia killed.
   Zorrilla has also been mentioned in news reports in connection
with the deaths of three policemen and an investigator.
   He was suspended from the security post in mid-1984 and the
governing Institutional Revolutionary Party dropped him as a
congressional candidate in 1985 amid reports that he was under
investigation.
   Before taking over the Federal Security Department, Zorrilla was
a former congressman and private secretary to Fernando Gutierrez
Barrios, deputy interior secretary at the time. Gutierrez Barrios is
now interior secretary. There has been intense pressure on the
government to solve the murder of Buendia, one of more than a score
of journalists slain between 1982 and 1988.

<HEAD>Lawsuits Filed By Winners in Kraft's Game</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Winners of a Kraft contest who feel the
food giant is trying to give them the dodge instead of a Dodge have
filed at least two class-action lawsuits against the company.
   At least 100 people wound up with winning game pieces for what
was supposed to be a ``one and only'' grand prize, a $17,000 Dodge
Caravan, in Kraft's ``Ready to Roll'' contest.
   ``We've declared the game null and void. We're still evaluating
what our next step will be,'' Kathy Knuth, spokeswoman for Kraft
General Foods Group of Philip Morris Cos., said Tuesday at the
company's suburban Chicago offices.
   But Tuesday, at least two lawsuits were filed on behalf of the
winners in Cook County Circuit Court.
   ``It's their mistake. They should have to pay for it. It's real
simple,'' said attorney Burton Weinstein, of Baskin, Server, Berke &amp;
Weinstein, one of the law firms that filed suit.
   The contest's prizes were 8,000 free packages of cheese; 500
skateboards; 100 bicycles; and, at odds of 15 million-to-1, a 1990
Dodge Caravan.
   The game required consumers to match left halves of a pictured
van contained in inserts in specially marked packages of Kraft
Singles cheese, with right halves appearing on coupons in Sunday
newspaper advertising in the Chicago and Houston areas.
   But due to a printing error, it looks like nearly everybody won a
prize and at least a hundred people won the car.
   ``We're telling people who've matched the pieces to go ahead and
mail them in, but we don't know what we'll do,'' Ms. Knuth said.
``Obviously we feel very badly about the situation.''
   If Kraft wants to blame the printing company for the foul up,
then Kraft should sue the printing company, Weinstein said in a
telephone interview. But Kraft still is obligated to compensate the
contest winners, he said.
   Ms. Knuth declined to reveal any details about the promotion,
other than to argue that the company cannot be held liable for the
error.
   ``It is so obviously unintentional,'' she said.
   The company ordered packages of the cheese slices removed from
grocery store shelves.
   The Illinois attorney general's office fielded at least 50 calls
from angry customers, said spokeswoman Therese McMahon.

   Four tons of marijuana disguised as cans of
pickled jalapeno peppers were seized by federal agents, who arrested
eight men.
   ``I guess you could say Customs picked pot packed in pickled
peppers,'' said Joan Baran, a U.S. Customs Service spokeswoman.
   The shipment originated in Costa Rica and went through Newark,
N.J., as 6-pound cans of Del Campo brand pickled jalapeno peppers,
authorities said.
   Customs agents discovered the marijuana, which has a wholesale
value of about $6.5 million. On Monday, an agent posing as a truck
driver delivered the marijuana to a warehouse in Brooklyn.
   About two hours later, federal drug agents, armed with warrants,
searched the warehouse and arrested four men. Four other suspects
were arrested Monday and Tuesday.
   The eight are Colombians who live in the New York City area and
are between the ages of 25 and 32.
   The suspects were charged with conspiring to import, distribute
and possess marijuana and face 10 years to life in jail if
convicted, authorities said.

<HEAD>West Germans Indict IRA Suspects in British Bombings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   West Germany announced the
indictment today of two suspected IRA members for the bombings of
two British military bases that injured 46 people.
   Chief Federal Prosecutor Kurt Rebmann identified the suspects as
Terence Gerard McGeough and Gerard Thomas Hanratty, who have been
imprisoned in West Germany since their arrest in August 1988.
   Shortly after they were caught, Britain's Independent Television
News said that McGeough may have been a top arms buyer for the Irish
Republican Army and that he was suspected of organizing arms
shipments from Libya.
   Col. Moammar Gadhafi's radical North African government
reportedly has backed the IRA for several years.
   Rebmann said in a statement that both men had been charged with
attempted murder and ``other crimes'' that were not specified.
   The attacks were the March 1987 bombing of the British Army of
the Rhine headquarters in Moenchengladbach that injured 36 people
and the July 1988 bombing of a British barracks in Duisburg-Wanheim
that injured 10 soldiers.
   Rebmann said the men are suspected of belonging to the
``terrorist organization `Provisional Irish Republican Army
(PIRA).'' The PIRA is generally referred to simply as the IRA, as
Rebmann noted in his statement.
   ``The terrorist activities of the PIRA are not limited to Great
Britain and Northern Ireland,'' Rebmann said. ``The PIRA has much
more, right from the beginning, carried out attacks also on the
European continent against British military members and military
installations.''
   McGeough and Hanratty, both 30, were arrested after a series of
attacks against British targets in Western Europe.
   The mainly Roman Catholic IRA is fighting to end British rule in
predominantly Protestant Northern Ireland to unite it with the 95
percent Roman Catholic Irish republic under socialist rule.

   The Soviet Union today joined the United States and
Vietnam in opposing calls for forcible repatriation of Vietnamese
boat people from their refuge in other Southeast Asian states.
   But other nations at the two-day U.N. Conference on Indochinese
Refugees _ including Britain, China, Thailand, the Philippines and
the Netherlands _ support such a policy.
   The conference is expected to formally endorse measures designed
to deter the mounting number of Vietnamese fleeing economic problems
rather than political persecution.
   The plan will introduce screening procedures in the countries of
first refuge to determine whether new arrivals can claim political
asylum and refugee status and are thus eligible for resettlement. It
call for the return of all ``non-refugees'' to their homeland.
   On the first day of the conference Monday, attended by 60
countries, Hong Kong Gov. Sir David Wilson, backed by Britain, had
urged quick mandatory repatriation of all boat people denied refugee
status.
   ``The consequences for Hong Kong are appalling,'' said Wilson.
``Our resources have been overwhelmed.''
   Wilson disputed assertions that mandatory repatriation was
inhumane.
   ``The real inhumanity is to encourage people to leave Vietnam
with women and children in unsafe boats in the hope of getting to
destinations on the far side of the world which they will never
reach because the doors are closed,'' he said.
   With 43,000 boat people, Hong Kong has by far the largest number
of Vietnamese in any territory in the region.
   British Foreign Minister Sir Geoffrey Howe said the influx has
put an ``intolerable'' burden on Hong Kong and caused a ``major
humanitarian crisis'' in the British colony, already one of the most
densely populated places in the world.
   Soviet chief delegate Genrikh V. Kireev told the conference
today, ``Repatriation of refugees should be carried out only on the
voluntary basis,'' echoing statements made Tuesday by U.S. Deputy
Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger and Foreign Minister Nguyen
Co Thach of Vietnam.
   The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, Jean-Pierre Hocke, says
if the conference approves the plan, the number of boat people
returning voluntarily should rise.
   Vietnam has given assurances to the U.N. agency that no punitive
action will be taken against these returnees. It has said it will
not accept those returned against their will.
   Since March, only 143 boat people have voluntarily returned, a
fraction of the number who arrive daily in the region's coastal
states. The Hong Kong branch of the Oxfam relief agency has
supported the governor's call for mandatory action, saying voluntary
repatriation does not work.
   The draft plan before the conference, while making clear all
non-refugees should return, makes no explicit recommendation how
this should be done.
   The number of boat people declined in the early 1980's but the
exodus has accelerated again. Nearly 90,000 Vietnamese, three times
the 1986 total, now live in refugee camps.
   Another 100,000 refugees from Cambodia and Laos also live in
camps.
   Wilson said screening procedures instituted by Hong Kong last
year, and expected to be adopted under the U.N. plan, showed most
new arrivals do not qualify for refugee status.
   ``Their reasons for leaving Vietnam are essentially economic,''
he said, making them ineligible for resettlement in third countries,
specifically in North America, where most hope to go.
   The United States has accepted 900,000 of the 1.5 million
Indochinese who fled their homes since the Vietnam War ended in
April 1975.
   Eagleburger announced the United States is prepared to resettle
22,000 of the 55,000 Vietnamese who arrived in Southeast Asian
nations before any screening procedures were instituted. He also
said the United States anticipates accepting up to half of all new
arrivals granted refugee status.

   A 10-year-old whose hand was crushed in last
year's Soviet earthquake was able to wave goodbye to the United
States after a four-month stay in which surgeons grafted two toes
onto the end of his arm.
   Karen Kocharian, who underwent surgery at Children's Hospital of
Philadelphia, had arrived here with little more than a swollen ball
of tissue at the end of his right arm.
   ``I'm going to miss him,'' said occupational therapist Dore
DiBerardino, ``but he's promised to write to me'' as part of his
therapy.
   Another child from Soviet Armenia, 14-year-old Harotyoun
Sarkissian, left with his father on the same flight Tuesday from
Philadelphia. Harotyoun, who like Karen is from the city of
Leninakan, was fitted at Shriners Hospital for Crippled Children for
a prosthesis for his missing left arm. He also underwent leg surgery.
   The two were part of a group of 37 brought to the United States
for treatment by the non-profit medical-aid organization Project
Hope. The Dec. 7 earthquake left an estimated 25,000 dead and about
500,000 homeless.
   Doctors transplanted two toes from Karen's left foot onto the
stump of his arm. Next year, Dr. Lee Osterman will travel to Armenia
and separate Karen's two new digits, which are enclosed in a ball of
flesh.
   Karen and his father, Sarkis, spent their final days here
shopping for souvenirs, said Alice Ohanian, who put them up in her
suburban home.
   The Kocharians bought a videocassette recorder and a car radio,
as well as blue jeans for Karen's mother, grandfather, brother and
uncle.
   Karen said he will miss the Ohanian family's Corvette and Trans
Am.
   A third Armenian, 14-year-old Anik Meloyan, came to the airport
to see the Kocharians and Sarkissians off.
   ``She wishes she were going also,'' said the girl's host, Vicki
Nazaria.
   Anik received treatment for a fractured, infected leg and is
scheduled to leave later this month.

   A tearful judge took a toddler away from the couple
who raised her from infancy and placed her in state custody after
prosecutors said the husband and wife had bought her for $1,100, a
plane ticket and a box of candy.
   The judge also denied a custody plea by 17-month-old Crystal's
maternal grandparents, who began a nationwide search for the girl
after learning their unwed daughter had given her up for adoption.
   ``I did not buy this baby,'' Richard DeMetro said after Monday's
hearing, during which Circuit Judge Frederick Barad ordered him and
his wife, Judy Williams DeMetro, to hand the sleeping girl over to a
social worker.
   ``It is a very sad case because it is obvious the child was taken
care of by the DeMetros as if she were their own child,'' the judge
said.
   But he added, ``Children are not to be bought.''
   The couple sobbed as they handed the baby over.
   Prosecutors have filed illegal-adoption and baby-selling charges
against the couple.
   Investigators said Camara Ann Heistand gave birth to the girl
after checking into a hospital under a false name to avoid adoption
procedures and conceal the sale.
   Richard DeMetro testified that he fathered the baby with Ms.
Heistand. But Ms. Heistand testified that she met the DeMetros two
weeks before the birth after an introduction by a fortune teller.
   After Crystal's birth, the DeMetros gave Ms. Heistand $1,100 in
$100 bills, clothing, a box of candy and a plane ticket, said Morton
Laitner, an attorney for the state Health and Rehabilitative
Services Department.
   Crystal will remain in state care for up to a year while the
criminal case and the matter of her custody are resolved, Laitner
said.
   The DeMetros said they will appeal. Ms. Heistand's parents, Chad
and Carol Dornsife, plan to try to adopt Crystal.

<TEXT>
   Local governments need to come up with billions
of dollars to repair or replace three-fourths of county bridges and
upgrade at least 1.7 million miles of roads, according to a national
survey.
   The survey, released Tuesday by the National Association of
Counties, indicated that about 165,000 bridges need repair or
replacement.
   In four states _ Alabama, Arkansas, Missouri and Texas _ more
than 90 percent of county bridges were listed as defective. All but
three states _ Oregon, Idaho and Arizona _ had more than half of
their bridges needing repair.
   One county official, frustrated over pressure to keep a faulty
bridge open, gave in but posted it for a load limit of ``zero,'' and
another suggested local bake sales to raise funds for bridge repair,
said Norman Walzer, a co-author of the report on county highways for
the National Association of Counties.
   Walzer, economics department chairman at Western Illinois
University, described the frustration of local officials trying to
pay the increasing cost of road and bridge repair as federal and
state assistance continues to decline.
   ``There are some hard times out there,'' he said, adding that
some of the nation's 3,000 counties have been forced to cut back on
spending for roads and bridges in a day when a new road grader can
cost as much as some counties' total annual road budget.
   Walzer said county road supervisers who responded to the survey
indicated that about one-fourth of the nation's roads are viewed as
``less than barely adequate'' by the engineers who have to maintain
them.
   Walzer said some defective bridges become more of a hazard as
rural populations change.
   ``A family moves in with a couple of children, and then you've
got a nine-ton school bus crossing the bridge,'' he said.
   The study says 1.7 million miles of county roads were not built
for today's level of use, and the nearly 165,000 substandard bridges
need to be rehabilitated or replaced at an average cost of between
$110,000 and $140,000 each.
   At that rate, the total bill for county governments could exceed
$20 billion for bridges alone. Just under half the nation's nearly
half-million bridges are the responsibility of county or town
governments.
   ``Traditional sources of revenue, such as the property tax, are
inadequate to meet the urgent need for repair and replacement of
county roads and bridges,'' said John Thomas, association executive
director. He said more federal aid is needed for county roads.
   The county association also urges local governments to seek the
authority to raise funds for roads and bridges by adding to the
gasoline tax and opposes any use of gasoline tax revenue for
non-highway purposes, Thomas said.
   The 350-page state-by-state report by Walzer and fellow Western
Illinois economist Claudia McFadden, titled ``Linking America,''
said counties or town governments spent $11.69 billion on highways
in 1987, including $5.8 billion for maintenance and traffic services
and $3.8 billion on capital expenditures.
   The state share of county road funding declined from 40.6 percent
in 1977 to 30.2 percent in 1986, and federal funding from 8.7
percent to 5.4 percent, the report said. It said this has forced
counties to increase borrowing, from 6 percent in 1977 to 13.3
percent in 1986.
   The report divides county bridges into three categories: those
with a greater than 80 sufficiency rating which do not need repair;
those with a 50 to 80 rating, which can be rehabilitated without
replacement; and those with less than 50 which need either extensive
repair or must be replaced.
   The sufficiency ratings are given in biennial inspections
reported to the Federal Highway Administration. Data compiled for
the survey showed that 44.6 percent of the bridges fall in the worst
category, 30.4 percent need some repair and 25 percent are rated as
not needing repair or replacement.
   States with the most bridges in the worst category were Missouri,
75.9 percent; Texas, 70.1 percent; Oklahoma, 68.3 percent; Arkansas,
63.3 percent; and Alabama and Mississippi, both 60.4 percent.
   States with the fewest bridges needing possible replacement were
Washington, with 9.6 percent; Oregon, 10.5 percent; and Illinois, 13
percent.

<TEXT>
   President Bush vetoed the bill increasing the
minimum wage less than 20 minutes after it arrived at the White
House _ all with the stroke of his pen somewhere in the sky between
Wyoming and Nebraska.
   ``This may be the first faxed veto in history,'' White House
chief of staff John Sununu joked Tuesday in Wyoming a few hours
before Bush vetoed the measure aboard Air Force One.
   It turned out no facsimile machine was involved.
   Bush had taken a prepared copy of the veto message with him on
his two-day trip. At 1:39 p.m. EDT the president was notified by the
White House that the measure had arrived. Sixteen minutes later the
White House had a message back from the president: the veto message
was signed, affix a stamp of the president's signature to a
duplicate left at the White House and deliver it to Congress.
   It arrived there at 2:38 p.m., just as Democratic leaders
prepared for a news conference at which they planned to urge Bush
one last time not the veto the measure.
   Word of the veto quickly swept the Capitol, followed by questions
by reporters from news organizations that had reporters traveling
with Bush.
   First an aide to Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., scrambled to a
phone, then an aide to Rep. Augustus Hawkins, D-Calif. Neither could
find out for sure if the measure had been vetoed.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell arrived and, outside a
room full of reporters, told Kennedy he believed the measure had
been vetoed already but was not certain.
   ``I can't believe it,'' said Kennedy, who nonetheless took a seat
and began rewriting his prepared remarks.
   By the time House Speaker Thomas S. Foley arrived the suspense
was over.
   The veto message had made its way to the House, where the clerk
was reading it into the record.
   ``No,'' Mitchell said bluntly when asked if the speed of the veto
surprised him.
   Foley, a 24-year House veteran, said it ``probably been the
quickest veto of any bill in my memory.''

<HEAD>Former Washington Post Managing Editor Dies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Howard Simons, the Washington Post
managing editor who directed the newspaper's coverage of the
Watergate scandal and made a second career nurturing journalistic
talent at Harvard University, has died at age 60.
   Simons died of pancreatic cancer at a hospice in Jacksonville
Beach, Fla., said Harvard spokesman Peter Costa.
   The disease last month forced him to take leave from his position
as curator of the Nieman Foundation, a fellowship program in which
mid-career journalists pursue a year of unrestricted study at
Harvard.
   Simons was a Nieman fellow in 1958 and joined the Post in 1961 as
a science reporter.
   As managing editor from 1971 to 1984 he ran a newsroom that grew
from 400 to 550 people and gained a national reputation for
investigative reporting.
   On Watergate, Simons was ``the day-to-day agitator, the one who
ran around the newsroom inspiring, shouting, directing, insisting
that we not abandon our inquiry, whatever the level of denials or
denunciations,'' said reporter Bob Woodward, who with Carl Bernstein
helped break the Watergate scandal.
   ``He filled an essential and even an heroic role at the Post,''
said Katherine Graham, chairman of The Washington Post Co.
   Simons was known for his ardent defense of the First Amendment
and for his advocacy of hard news over soft features.
   Born in Albany, N.Y., where his father immigrated from Poland, he
graduated from Union College in Schenectady, N.Y., in 1951 and
received a master's degree in journalism from Columbia University in
1952.
   He worked for Science Service, a Washington news agency, and was
a free-lance writer before joining the Post.
   He wrote five books, including the spy thriller ``The Landing,''
which he wrote with journalist Haynes Johnson, and ``Jewish Times,''
an oral history of the American Jewish experience.
   In the wake of Simons' leave from Harvard, Bill Kovach, former
editor of the Journal and Constitution in Atlanta, was named acting
Nieman curator.
   Simons is survived by his wife, Florence, and four daughters.
   No services were planned.

   Six Israeli warplanes blasted a
Palestinian guerrilla base today in Syrian-controlled hills above
Beirut, wounding at least four fighters in two bombing runs.
   The base is operated by guerrillas of the Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine, one of nine factions of the Palestine
Liberation Organization.
   A statement by the Israeli military command indicated, however,
that it was not the intended target and that the air force meant to
bomb another PLO base.
   Meanwhile, Syrian and Christian gunners traded rocket and
artillery fire in and around Beirut amid reports that Christian army
commander Gen. Michel Aoun had rejected a Syrian proposal for
halting the confrontation.
   Police said three people were killed, including a sergeant
serving with Aoun's troops.
   The casualties raised the overall toll to 370 people killed and
1,441 wounded since the fighting broke out on March 8.
   The guerrilla base bombed by the Israelis is located in pine
woods just outside Bshamoun, a tiny Druse village about eight miles
southeast of Beirut. Many of the trees caught fire after the planes,
diving from clear skies, dropped at least 10 bombs on the
guerrillas' position.
   Palls of smoke could be seen rising from the area as guerrillas
fired their AK-47 rifles into the air to warn away reporters and
photographers.
   ``They've raided our base,'' shouted one angry fighter, wearing a
red headband. ``I'll shoot whoever approaches the area.''
   Four ambulances sped into the base, each carried one wounded
guerrilla to Kamal Jumblatt Hospital in Choueifat, a nearby Druse
town, the rescuers said.
   Police said two planes first dropped four rockets on the base at
11:50 a.m. Four more jets swept low over the base 20 minutes later
and dropped six more bombs.
   A guerrilla, who identified himself only as Ayman, said: ``We
didn't even hear the jets roaring overhead. We realized we were
under attack when the first two planes fired four rockets.''
   A police spokesman said the jets dropped 250-pound bombs.
   The statement by the Israeli military command said the planes
raided a base of the Syrian-based Palestine Liberation Front, a tiny
PLO faction founded by the late Talaat Yacoub, who had split from
the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine in the mid-1970s.
   The Israeli army said the air raid was in retaliation for a May
28 barrage of Soviet-made Katyusha rockets that hit the northern
town of Metullah, injuring an 8-month-old baby. The attack was
accompanied by an unsuccessful infiltration attempt.
   Both the PLO factions claimed responsibility.
   The Popular Front, led by George Habash, is a Marxist group based
in Damascus, Syria, and the second-largest of the PLO factions.
   Loud explosions echoed across Beirut during the bombing attack,
the seventh by Israel jets into Lebanon this year.
   The police spokesman said the planes released scarlet balloons to
deflect heat-seeking missiles. But guerrilla defenders did not
deploy such weapons, he said, speaking on anonymity in line with
standing regulations.
   Guerrillas opened up with twin-barelled 23mm anti-aircraft guns
but scored no hits, he said.
   By police count, six people were killed and 49 wounded in the six
previous Israeli air attacks.
   A lone Israeli helicopter gunship rocketed Iranian-backed
guerrillas in southern Lebanon last Wednesday wounding three members
of the Shiite Moslem Hezbollah, or Party of God.
   Lakhdar Ibrahimi of Algeria, assistant secretary-general of the
Arab League, was in Moslem west Beirut today to meet with acting
Prime Minister Salim Hoss, a Sunni Moslem who heads one of two
cabinets competing to run the country.
   The other government is run by Gen. Aoun, a Maronite Catholic.
   The prestigious daily newspaper An-Nahar said the latest round of
fighting in Lebanon's 14-year-old civil war intensified after Aoun
rejected a Syrian proposal for the formation of a ``security
committee'' representing various Lebanese factions to oversee
implementation of a cease-fire.
   An-Nahar said Aoun insisted on the creation of a
``Lebanese-Syrian security committee,'' arguing that the
confrontation was between Syrian and Lebanese forces and not among
Lebanese factions.

   China today accused an Associated Press reporter
and the Voice of America bureau chief of violating martial law
restrictions and gave them three days to leave the country.
   The reporters are John Pomfret of The Associated Press, and the
Voice of America's Beijing bureau chief, Alan Pessin.
   The British Broadcasting Corp. in Beijing initially reported that
Brian Barron, its Far Eastern correspondent for television, also was
ordered out, but later said ``it was just a mistake.''
   ``We thought he had been. But we're assured it isn't him. The
American networks, the wires and ourselves all seem to have made the
same translation error. It is not Brian Barron. We do not know who
it is,'' said a BBC spokesman in London, commenting anonymously.
   Police called in Pomfret and Pessin this afternoon. According to
Pomfret, police said he met with the leaders of student
organizations that led seven weeks of pro-democracy protests.
   ``Pomfret used his journalism credentials for illegal activities
and used illegal methods to get state secrets,'' the Beijing
television news accused. ``He protected the leaders of student
groups and exchanged information with them.''
   The government ordered martial law in parts of Beijing on May 20
and placed restrictions on foreign correspondents in a bid to
prevent them from interviewing student protesters. But the measures
have not been strongly enforced.
   In New York, the expulsion of Pomfret was criticized by Louis D.
Boccardi, president and general manager of The Associated Press.
   ``We deplore and have protested in the strongest terms to the
Chinese government this unwarranted assault on fair and factual
reporting,'' Boccardi said.
   ``John Pomfret is a journalist, not a participant, and even those
who have issued this order must surely understand that.''
   Pomfret, 30, has worked for The AP since 1986 and has been based
in Beijing since 1988. He studied in China from 1980-82 and speaks
fluent Chinese.
   ``I did my job as a journalist and I worked hard,'' Pomfret said.
``It's a shame that these are the results I get.''
   Pessin, 33, said police accused him of engaging in reporting
aimed at distorting facts, spreading rumors and instigating turmoil
and counterrevolutionary rebellion.
   ``The only motive we have is to tell the truth as best we can.
Governments do not always like that,'' he said.

   A court stenographer has been charged with
leaking secret grand jury testimony to her husband, a defendant in a
Mafia heroin case.
   Deborah Casmer-Ryers told her husband, Robert Ryers, about an FBI
agent's testimony about the Mafia in 1988, and Ryers told a mob
associate who secretly was cooperating with the FBI, federal
authorities charged Tuesday.
   The testimony focused on brothers Giuseppe and Giovanni Gambino,
accused of participating in the so-called Pizza Connection, which
smuggled cocaine and heroin into the United States in wine bottles
and through pizza parlors and a nightclub.
   Ryers, the Gambino brothers _ who are nephews of the late mob
boss Carlo Gambino _ and four others go on trial July 19.
   Ronald Cole, an attorney with the Philadelphia Organized Crime
Strike Force, said Casmer-Ryers was the court reporter for the
testimony of Steven Salvo, an FBI language analyst and witness
against the Gambinos.
   Casmer-Ryers was charged with criminal contempt and faces an
indeterminate sentence.
   Her lawyer, Donald Manno, declined to comment Tuesday.

   The Foreign Ministry summoned Turkey's ambassador
today to complain about that nation's decision to allow a Soviet
defector to fly to the United States rather than be extradited to
the Soviet Union.
   Soviet Air Force Capt. Alexander Zuyev took a MiG-29 fighter on
May 20 after a shootout with a sentry at Tskhakaya airport, north of
the Black Sea resort city of Batumi, and flew across the border to
Turkey, the Soviets have said.
   Turkey returned the plane to the Soviet Union the next day but
rejected Kremlin appeals to extradite Zuyev, who requested asylum in
the United States.
   Washington agreed to the request and Zuyev was permitted to fly
to the United States on Friday.
   The Foreign Ministry released a statement, carried by the
official Tass news agency, that was read to Ambassador Volkan Vural
of Turkey.
   ``The actions by the Turkish side toward criminal Zuyev cannot be
perceived in the Soviet Union other than running counter to the
spirit of good neighborliness in Soviet-Turkish relations,'' the
statement said.
   According to the Soviets, Zuyev, banned from flying for health
reasons, shot and wounded an airport sentry before escaping in the
plane.
   ``The judgement by the Turkish court, which ruled that Zuyev
committed his action for political reasons and ruled out the chance
of his extradition and moreover, punishment, and also the
confirmation of this decision at a higher level is grossly at odds
with international legal principles,'' the statement said.
   The Foreign Ministry noted that Turkey signed the 1948 Universal
Declaration of Human Rights and the 1967 U.N. declaration on
territorial refuge.
   ``We had every right to expect from the Turkish side an
implementation of the principle of an unconditional extradition of
terrorists,'' the statement said.
   The was no indication that the Soviet Union intended to take
further action against Turkey.
   The Soviet ambassador to Turkey, Albert Cernishev, said last week
that authorities would now ask the United States to extradite Zuyev.

   Congressional calls for a Justice Department
investigation of a federal housing program have intestified in the
wake of a former official's refusal to answer questions about
favoritism and mismanagement in the project.
   Deborah Gore Dean, onetime executive assistant to former Housing
Secretary Samuel Pierce, refused Tuesday to respond to a House
subcommittee's questions about her role in the program.
   Dean invoked her constitutional right against self-incrimination
in declining to discuss her involvement in selection of projects for
funding under the Department of Housing and Urban Development's
Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation Program.
   Several congressional committees have been examining the program
after HUD's inspector general found that a number of former Reagan
administration officials had reaped large profits from it as
contractors or consultants.
   Dean said she has been unable to obtain HUD records ``which would
enable me to give accurate testimony that would be complete and
truthful.''
   ``I respectfully have decided to decline to answer any questions
posed by the subcommittee at this time on the basis of the rights
guaranteed to me under the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution,''
she said.
   HUD Secretary Jack Kemp suspended the housing rehabilitation
program in April as the inspector general had recommended, but he
reinstated funding on June 1 after developing new guidelines and
regulations.
   Dean, the sole witness to appear under subpeona before the House
Government Operations subcommittee on employment and housing, was
accompanied by two attorneys, Charles Leeper and former U.S.
Attorney for the District of Columbia Joseph diGenova.
   Panel chairman Tom Lantos, D-Calif., told Dean he and the
subcommittee would assist her in obtaining the documents she needed.
   But Rep. Bruce Morrison, D-Conn., questioned whether the
extensive list of documents requested by Dean, including all of
Pierce's phone logs and appointment records between January 1984 and
December 1988, was reasonable.
   Pierce testified last month that those records no longer exist.
   Morrison also questioned whether Dean was implying that her
answers to the panel ``would be incriminating.''
   Reminding Morrison that the Fifth Amendment was designed to
protect the innocent, Leeper said the Supreme Court has found it
sufficient to refuse to answer inquiries ``where any answer may or
could expose that witness to prosecution''
   Morrison said ``there's no suggestion of guilt. ... However the
fact that any witness would feel the threat of this investigation
turning into a criminal investigation ... I would hope that this
would suggest to the Justice Department that there may be criminal
wrongdoing.''
   The inspector general said he found no evidence of criminal
wrongdoing in his audit of the program. However, his report has been
referred to the Justice Department for further review.
   Morrison's Republican colleague from Connecticut, Rep.
Christopher Shays, wondered aloud whether Dean had requested
specific documents or if she had asked for such a long list of items
``to make her testimony here never to occur.''
   ``I find it absolutely astounding ... that the very person who
was at the center of this was not investigated,'' Shays added.
   Earlier, Silvio DeBartolomeis, a former HUD deputy assistant
secretary, said he viewed Dean ``as the final decision-maker'' in
the department on the rehabilitation program.
   DeBartolomeis said he had told Dean of his concern that there was
possible political influence on the program's selection process. In
one instance, he said, he ``left town'' to avoid signing documents
approving funding for two projects.
   But he said he subsequently was ordered to sign the documents by
Dean.

   Riot police fired tear gas at 1,000
striking taxi drivers who were protesting government measures that
more than doubled the price of gasoline and devalued the currency by
52 percent.
   No injuries were reported in Tuesday's incident, although police
arrested one cab driver and charged him with ``instigating
disobedience.''
   The austerity measures by the leftist Sandinista government were
aimed at combating inflation, which was 15.5 percent last month. The
cost of living rose 20,000 percent last year.
   Earlier Tuesday, President Daniel Ortega announced pay raises of
up to 50 percent for public employees and accused businessmen of
fueling inflation by speculating in dollars.
   Cabbies from Managua and three other major cities _ Leon, Granada
and Masaya _ stopped working Tuesday to protest the measures.
   Authorities gave the 1,000 cabbies gathered in the capital at a
corner gasoline station 30 minutes to disperse. Police said the
gathering was illegal because the drivers did not have the required
permit.
   The ``Black Berets,'' specially trained riot police, blocked
roads leading to the station and a half hour later lobbed six
tear-gas grenades in the yard.
   The drivers refused to disperse, instead singing the Nicaraguan
national anthem with raised fists while dabbing teary eyes.
   The cabbies told police, ``We are poor people, just like you,''
and ``We can't be accused of anything except trying to earn a
living.''
   On Monday, Ortega ordered a 52 percent devaluation of the cordoba
against the dollar, the highest this year.
   Prices immediately rose for everything, from food and
transportation to clothing, services and entertainment.
   Food prices doubled and markets emptied. Cab drivers doubled
their fares but found few takers.
   Ortega said Tuesday that Nicaragua, traditionally a food exporter
to the rest of Central America, will have to import basic foods such
as tomatoes, onions, bananas and cabbages in June and July to make
up for domestic shortages.
   To stimulate production, the government has been giving financial
incentives to agricultural producers, who began their seasonal
plantings in May but have been plagued by a drought.

   The deranged fan who stabbed Theresa
Saldana won't get out of prison for at least nine months, but that's
still too soon, says the actress.
   The state Board of Prison Terms on Tuesday extended Arthur
Jackson's parole date from Thursday to March 15, 1990, for breaking
windows and disobeying orders in prison. He has served seven years
of a 12-year sentence for attempted murder.
   The Scottish drifter, who has vowed in letters to Miss Saldana to
complete his ``divine mission'' to kill her, had earned time off for
good behavior and had been scheduled for early release from the
California Medical Facility.
   Miss Saldana, who is six months pregnant, said, ``I am
temporarily relieved and I'm glad we can have the baby and not be
worried about a release date around the time of my baby due date.''
   However, she expressed dismay that the man who tried to kill her
in front of her West Hollywood apartment in 1982 would ever be freed.
   ``It's very confusing,'' she said. ``Everyone tells me `Just have
him committed.' Everyone feels that will be the solution. Looking at
it logically, that would be the solution. I just don't understand.''
   Last week, Los Angeles District Attorney Ira Reiner charged
Jackson with making death threats from prison, and he could face
nearly eight more years if convicted.
   ``Somebody who is sitting in a prison cell and making threats is
hardly entitled to time off for good behavior,'' Reiner said.
   ``It is unfortunate that the law under which Jackson was
sentenced allows an individual with his atrocious record to have any
hope of ever being paroled,'' Gov. George Deukmajian said.
   Jackson, 53, has been diagnosed a chronic paranoid schizophrenic,
said Dr. V. Meenakshi, the prison's chief psychologist.
   ``If you look at it in the way the courts look at it legally,
then no, he's not dangerous in legal terms,'' the doctor said. ``But
he's dangerous in psychiatric terms.''

<TEXT>
   Ax-wielding Palestinians today wounded an
Israeli truck driver and a Palestinian in separate attacks on
employees of the Israeli military in the occupied Gaza Strip, army
and Arab reports said.
   Both men were reported in stable condition.
   Also today, Israeli warplanes bombed a Palestinian guerrilla base
south of the Lebanese capital of Beirut in retaliation for a rocket
attack on an Israeli border settlement two weeks ago, the army said.
   The base belonged to the Syrian-based Palestine Liberation Front
founded by the late Talat Yacoub. There was no immediate report of
casualties. It was the sixth Israeli air raid in Lebanon this year
and the second near war-torn Beirut.
   In another development, Israeli media reported that the army is
seeking permission to deport Palestinians from the occupied lands
without waiting for the completion of lengthy appeals.
   The United States has denounced the expulsions, saying they
violate international human rights conventions that bar deportations
from occupied territories.
   The Israeli truck driver was attacked by a group of ax-wielding
Palestinians as he delivered fuel to a gas station outside the
village of Beit Lahiya in northern Gaza Strip, the army said. The
army blocked people from leaving or entering the village after the
attack.
   The victim, 27-year-old Sami Daluya, was conscious and in stable
condition after suffering a fractured skull, said Nili Nir, a
spokeswoman for Barzilai Hospital in Ashkelon.
   Daluya is a civilian army employee from the nearby coastal city
of Ashdod, Ms. Nir said.
   In the southern Gaza Strip town of Rafah, dozens of masked
Palestinians armed with axes and clubs attacked 20-year-old Hisham
Mustafa Abu Dahi, who works as a cleaner for the Israeli military
government, the army and Palestinian reports said.
   The attackers dropped the victim off at a Rafah school. He was
taken to Nasser Hospital in nearby Khan Yunis.
   Leaders of the 18-month-old uprising have ordered Palestinians
working for the military government to resign and called on
militants to attack those who ignore such orders. Scores of
Palestinian police and military government employees have quit their
jobs in response to the threats.
   At least 516 palestinians have died and more than 10,000 have
been wounded since the uprising began in December, 1987. Twenty-two
Israelis have also been killed.
   The request to change policy on deportations was made by the
armed forces chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron, before
Parliament's Defense and Foreign Affairs Committee.
   ``We need to cut short the lengthy procedures involved,'' Shomron
was quoted as telling the committee on Tuesday in explaining the
need for the change.
   Under the proposal, the appeal could be considered after the
deportation, and if the Supreme Court decided in favor of the
deportee, he would be allowed to return.
   Since the start of the uprising, Israel has deported 45
Palestinian activists to southern Lebanon.
   Another 13 Palestinians have been ordered deported, with the
latest orders issued in August 1988. Of these cases, some are still
under appeal while in others, the army has delayed the deportations.
   The Supreme Court has never overturned a deportation order.

   Pizza baron Tom Monaghan, who spent part
of his childhood in a Catholic orphanage, is trimming his work hours
to devote more time to philanthropic causes.
   ``I love the day-to-day work at Domino's, but I want to serve the
church more,'' said Monaghan, 52, who attended a seminary in Grand
Rapids. ``I always wanted to be a priest.''
   Monaghan, founder of Domino's Pizza Inc., said he resigned as
president of the fast-food empire to spend about 15 percent less
time on company business.
   Day-to-day responsibilities shift to David Black, 40, who becomes
president after eight years as vice president of operations.
   Monaghan will remain chairman and chief executive officer, he
said Monday.
   Monaghan's philanthropic organization, Domino's Pizza Foundation,
supports a Roman Catholic missionary priest in Honduras, where
Monaghan has sent dentists, doctors and medical supplies.
   Monaghan founded Domino's in 1960. Last year, Domino's had
earnings of $6.1 million on sales of $2.3 billion.

<HEAD>Washington Supermarket Chain Testing Rebates</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Starting this fall, Giant Food Inc. will begin
testing a computerized ``frequent buyer'' program which will offer
regular shoppers cash rebates on certain merchandise.
   The program is being put together by a subsidiary of Citicorp,
the New York banking giant. Giant, which is based in Landover, Md.,
is among several supermarket chains across the nation that will test
the program.
   Safeway Stores Inc., Giant's major competitor in the Washington
market, is planning to test a similar program in the Denver area.
However, so far, the company hasn't announced plans to match Giant's
program here.
   Giant officials have declined to identify the three suburban
Washington stores where the program will be tested for four to five
months beginning Oct. 1. People living near the stores will be
invited to apply for membership cards in the program, which is
called ``Reward America.''
   Checkers will electronically scan the cards at Giant checkout
counters. Data on the shoppers' purchases will be entered in a
computer system. Customers will be sent monthly statements tallying
their purchases of the roughly 100 products to be included in the
program. When they satisfy a specific purchase requirement, they
will receive rebate vouchers that can be redeemed at Giant stores
for cash.
   For example, a customer may be offered rebates after they buy
four cans of a specific brand of coffee during a three-month period.
Once that requirement is met, the shopper would receive a rebate
voucher worth at least $1.
   ``We see some significant applications from the retailers' and
manufacturers' point of view,'' said Bill Ahearn, a spokesman for
Citicorp. Citicorp POS Information Systems Inc. in Stamford, Conn.,
which is designing the program.
   Citicorp hopes to profit by selling the data it collects to
grocery manufacturers and retailers. Manufacturers could use the
information to see what households use their products and send them
coupons and other promotional material.

   Former state Attorney General J. Marshall
Coleman won a narrow victory in Virginia's first GOP gubernatorial
primary in 40 years, setting up a fall battle against Democrat L.
Douglas Wilder.
   ``With your work and commitment, we're going to take back the
Statehouse in 1990,'' Coleman, 47, told supporters Tuesday night
after edging former U.S. Sen. Paul S. Trible Jr.
   Wilder, 58, the state's lieutenant governor, called himself the
underdog in his bid to become the nation's first elected black
governor. He welcomed the chance to run against Coleman and said he
hoped the fall campaign would not be dominated by personal attacks,
as the Republican primary race was.
   ``Nobody in Virginia needs to be told what kind of campaign was
run,'' said Wilder, who was nominated by his party on Saturday.
``People don't like negative campaigns, and they will reject one in
November.''
   Coleman called Wilder ``a worthy opponent. I look forward to very
productive dialogue in the next few months.''
   Coleman had 147,610 votes, or 37 percent, to Trible's 140,061
votes, or 35 percent. U.S. Rep. Stanford E. Parris trailed with
112,409 votes, or 28 percent.
   Trible and Parris pledged to support Coleman, who lost the 1981
governor's race to Democrat Charles S. Robb, now a U.S. senator.
   The turnout of 400,000 was considerably greater than expected for
the $10 million race, the state's first GOP gubernatorial primary
since 1949. Only 235,000 voters turned out for the GOP's March 1988
Super Tuesday presidential primary.
   Trible led in the polls until the final week, claiming to be the
most electable candidate. A poll last week showed Trible would beat
Wilder 49 percent to 42 percent; Coleman and Parris also led Wilder,
but by lesser margins.
   By law, Gov. Gerald L. Baliles cannot succeed himself.
   Meanwhile, in Jersey City, N.J., City Council President Glenn
Cunningham lost a bid to become the city's first black mayor after a
campaign marked by charges of racism.
   Former Mayor Gerald McCann defeated Cunningham 30,169 to 24,249.
Turnout was light.
   McCann, 39, denied in the campaign that his supporters showed
white voters a 1970s photograph of Cunningham wearing his hair in an
Afro style. Cunningham, a 43-year-old police captain, was accused of
attack advertising for trying to portray McCann, a wealthy
accountant, as anti-tenant and pro-developer.
   In Virginia, none of the candidates played up the racial aspect
of a possible victory by Wilder, a grandson of slaves who had to
leave the state to go to law school because of segregation.
   The nation has not had a black governor since Reconstruction and
has never actually elected one; Lt. Gov. Pinckney Pinchback of
Louisiana became acting governor in 1872-73 after Gov. Henry
Warmouth was removed from office.

   Howard Simons, the Washington Post
managing editor who directed the newspaper's coverage of the
Watergate scandal and made a second career nurturing journalistic
talent at Harvard University, has died at age 60.
   Simons died Tuesday of pancreatic cancer at a hospice in
Jacksonville Beach, Fla., said Harvard spokesman Peter Costa.
   The disease last month forced him to take leave from his position
as curator of the Nieman Foundation, a fellowship program in which
mid-career journalists pursue a year of unrestricted study at
Harvard.
   Simons was a Nieman fellow in 1958 and joined the Post in 1961 as
a science reporter.
   As managing editor from 1971 to 1984 he ran a newsroom that grew
from 400 to 550 people and gained a national reputation for
investigative reporting.
   On Watergate, Simons was ``the day-to-day agitator, the one who
ran around the newsroom inspiring, shouting, directing, insisting
that we not abandon our inquiry, whatever the level of denials or
denunciations,'' said reporter Bob Woodward, who with Carl Bernstein
helped break the Watergate scandal.
   ``He filled an essential and even an heroic role at the Post,''
said Katharine Graham, chairman of The Washington Post Co.
   Simons was known for his ardent defense of the First Amendment
and for his advocacy of hard news over soft features.
   Born in Albany, N.Y., where his father immigrated from Poland, he
graduated from Union College in Schenectady, N.Y., in 1951 and
received a master's degree in journalism from Columbia University in
1952.
   He worked for Science Service, a Washington news agency, and was
a free-lance writer before joining the Post.
   He wrote five books, including the spy thriller ``The Landing,''
which he wrote with journalist Haynes Johnson, and ``Jewish Times,''
an oral history of the American Jewish experience.
   In the wake of Simons' leave from Harvard, Bill Kovach, former
editor of the Journal and Constitution in Atlanta, was named acting
Nieman curator.
   Simons is survived by his wife, Florence, and four daughters.
   No services were planned.

   A blob that seemed to drop out of the sky
into this Florida Keys town had everybody asking the same question _
What is it?
   The tannish blob about two feet in diameter plopped behind
gardener Angelo Rosario last weekend while he was planting a tree.
   The blob splattered, and Rosario poked it.
   The blob bubbled.
   Police were called and the blob, which hardened into a foamlike
solid, was taken into custody Sunday.
   Sheriff's Capt. Robert Wilkerson, a bomb technician and hazardous
chemical expert, said Tuesday the blob was nothing more than foam
insulation from an aerosol can.
   ``It took me about one second to figure it out,'' Wilkinson said.
``Kids must have got it and threw it in the air, or it was dumped by
a construction crew from a passing truck. When it hardens, it's like
a Frisbee. There's no way it fell from the sky.''

<HEAD>Woman Who Took Husband's Bar Exam Portrayed As Abused Wife</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS 12th graf pvs, `The fraud ...' to ADD that Lamb never was

<TEXT>
   Their marriage was made in law school. And
when Morgan Lamb failed his state bar exam, he sent his pregnant
lawyer wife masquerading as a man to take the test for him. She
passed.
   Now, the California Supreme Court is considering whether to
disbar Laura Beth Lamb, who scored ninth highest on the exam, then
was rushed to the hospital to deliver her baby.
   The State Bar says she should be disbarred for undermining the
exam process and foisting on the public an unqualified lawyer, her
ex-husband.
   Her lawyer, Tom Low, implored the court Tuesday to choose a
suspension rather than disbarment. He said his client was an abused
wife who participated in fraud to save her life and the life of her
child.
   Low said that Lamb, who owned a gun, had threatened to kill his
wife, the fetus and himself.
   ``There is not one shred of evidence that Laura Lamb is an evil
person or an unethical person,'' Low argued. ``She became
overwhelmed. She thought that her baby would die. She thought she
would die.''
   During her pregnancy, Mrs. Lamb, a diabetic, suffered from
hypertension, kidney failure and complications that threatened her
with blindness, Low said.
   She took the three-day bar exam for her husband in July 1985
while seven months pregnant. Then, she was rushed to the hospital
and placed in intensive care until the birth of her daughter 10 days
later, he said.
   ``It's astonishing to me,'' said Chief Justice Malcolm Lucas,
``that she was able to pass the bar and get the ninth highest
grade.''
   Attorney Diane Yu, representing the State Bar, argued that Mrs.
Lamb participated in a ``premeditated, deliberate plot.''
   ``She had the brains in the family,'' said Ms. Yu, ``and she took
the exam and scored ninth. It was brilliantly executed. She also was
an outstanding actress.''
   The State Bar was tipped off anonymously as the test was being
graded. Mrs. Lamb's husband never was admitted to the bar and never
practiced law.
   The fraud was disclosed by an anonymous tip to the state bar.
   Mrs. Lamb, now 33, met her husband at University of California,
Los Angeles, law school and they married after graduation, Low told
the justices.
   Mrs. Lamb passed her bar exam and became an attorney for the
Securities and Exchange Commission in January 1984. Her husband took
the exam in February 1985 and failed. He became abusive and violent
toward her and asked her to take the exam for him, Low said.
   ``She refused numerous times. When she was so beaten down because
she had nowhere to go, she gave in,'' Low said.
   The bar alleges that in June 1985, Mrs. Lamb cut her hair and
dressed in men's clothes, then went to have a bar identification
photo taken, signing her husband's name and deliberately smudging
her thumbprint. She took the exam a month later.
   Low noted that although Mrs. Lamb wore a man's shirt, bar
examiners could have seen that she was pregnant.
   He said Lamb abandoned his wife after the baby was born and they
have since divorced.
   Mrs. Lamb pleaded no contest in March 1987 to felony charges of
deception and impersonation. The charges later were reduced to
misdemeanors. She was fined $2,500 and placed on probation, which
has ended.
   She is continuing therapy, Low said, and works as a legal
secretary and researcher while raising her daughter.
   Mrs. Lamb stopped practicing law voluntarily in 1986 and was
placed on inactive status in May 1988 after a bar hearing panel
recommended disbarment.
   Mrs. Lamb's lawyers are asking for her suspension for ``a
reasonable period'' rather than disbarment.
   A suspended lawyer is reinstated automatically when the
designated period ends. A disbarred lawyer can apply for readmission
after five years but must prove moral fitness to resume practice.
   Last year, Lamb was given three years probation and ordered to
perform 500 hours of community service for forgery and false
impersonation.

<TEXT>
   Five accidental shootings of children by
children since June 1 prompted Gov. Bob Martinez to add gun safety
to the agenda today in calling a special session of the Legislature.
   Martinez had already planned to call lawmakers back to the
capital to take up a $2.2 billion turnpike expansion plan. The
special session announced today will take place Monday through
Wednesday next week.
   The five shootings have left two children dead and one near death
today. In each case, children found guns around the house and shot
themselves or others.
   A proposal sponsored by Rep. Harry Jennings would make it a
misdemeanor to leave a gun within reach of a child and a felony
carrying up to five years in prison if the child died or was
permanently maimed.
   ``No one in this world is more curious than a child, and nothing
is more tragic when that natural curiosity result sin a child being
hurt or killed,'' Martinez said.
   ``If we can pass legislation that makes just one parent act more
carefully, that saves just one child from tragedy, our efforts will
be worthwhile.''
   Martinez also wants to build toll roads near most of the state's
largest cities, including a 91-mile beltway around Orlando.

   Here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers throughout

   June 13
   Bangor (Maine) Daily News on James Watt's consultant fees:
   When a historian writes the chapter about the influence peddlers
of Washington and their frenzied feeding during the 1980s, James
Watt's strip-mining consultant fees for a low-income housing project
will be the perfect case in point.
   James Watt, king of the urban tenements! Did you ever dream you'd
hear those two topics _ Watt and urban housing _ mentioned in the
same sentence? Not unless Watt was ordering the destruction of a
housing project to mine a vein of some valuable mineral.
   But the former Interior Secretary during the first Reagan
administration _ who became a sort of environmental Emperor Nero in
the view of his enemies _ has gone free-lance, performing some
offshore drilling of the Washington money beds, to make his mark in
the housing field as a ``consultant.''
   To be specific, Watt consulted a few times by telephone with
Samuel Skinner, the secretary of Housing and Urban Development, and
Skinner's helpers in the bureaucracy that is now under the command
of former U.S. Rep. Jack Kemp. The contractor for whom Watt used his
name paid him $169,000 for the trouble.
   Watt earned more than $400,000 all told as a housing specialist _
although he had no background in housing and never inspected any of
the projects.

   Charleston (W.Va.) Daily Mail on honoraria for members of
Congress:
   There was only one point worth remembering in former House
Speaker Jim Wright's smarmy, hectoring sayonara speech to the House.
...
   Wright tried to make the case that some of the House's rules on
income and outside earnings are subject to varying interpretations.
   That's easy enough to fix. The way to do it is to write clear
rules of conduct that every House member can understand.
   The first step in clarifying these rules is to eliminate
honoraria outright. The practice of allowing congressmen to take
speaking fees from special interests seeking legislation subjects
every congressman _ even the honest ones _ to skepticism and
disrespect.
   In fact, why doesn't Congress simply end its soul-searching and
ethical squirming by limiting its members to the salary that comes
with the job? Even Jim Wright could understand that rule.

   Burlington County Times, Willingboro, N.J., on a drug giveaway:
   Probably some skeptic suspected G.D. Searle &amp; Co. of a publicity
gimmick a year ago when it announced it would offer heart drugs free
of charge to the poor.
   Nationwide, the company has issued 200,000 certificates for a
month's supply of heart medicine, with thousands of physicians and
pharmacies participating and about 65,000 patients receiving Searle
products.
   Now the company is broadening the program to include its newest
product, Cyototec, a gastric-ulcer prevention drug for arthritis
patients.
   These policies rate applause not just for the service they
provide but for the example they set.
   If the medical needs of the poor and those with no medical
insurance are to be addressed adequately, private hospitals and
medical firms have to increase their charitable commitment; the task
is too big and costly to leave to government alone.
   Searle's drug program is ... essential if we're to help the
medically indigent without draining the public treasury.

   The Leaf-Chronicle, Clarksville, Tenn., on Thomas Foley as House
speaker:
   Thomas Foley has the unenviable task of trying to get the House
in order.
   The 60-year-old Democrat from Washington was recently elected
speaker of the House. Known as a negotiator and a consensus-builder,
... Foley will need all of the political skills that he has acquired
over the years if he hopes to restore some semblance of normalcy to
the lower chamber of Congress.
   The House is reeling from partisan political attacks and ethical
investigations of both Democrats and Republicans. ... Foley succeeds
Jim Wright of Texas, who resigned the post and his seat after a
House ethics panel brought charges against him.
   The speaker said that he hopes to quickly ``restore a mood of
conciliation, reconciliation and cooperation between the two
parties.'' He also said that revising House ethics rules and
campaign laws will be a top priority.
   A new era of leadership should not mean that the ethics charges
against current members of the House be swept aside. Still, one
would hope that all of the allegations could be resolved in a timely
fashion so that the legislators could get back to the business they
were elected to do _ making the nation's laws.

   The Duluth (Minn.) News-Tribune on the GOP memo about Foley:
   Mark Goodin is jobless today, but leaves behind him at the
Republican National Committee what has become an increasingly
valuable political commodity: Deniability.
   Goodin was ousted as committee communications director when a
storm broke over his memo smearing House Speaker Thomas Foley with
insinuations of homosexuality.
   So Goodin goes, but Lee Atwater, Republican National Committee
chairman, gets to deny having anything to do with the nefarious
memo. He apologizes to Foley, but keeps his job. And his patron,
President George Bush, expresses ``disgust'' at the memo, and life
goes on in the White House as he denies finding such actions
acceptable.
   Perhaps this outrage will be so soundly rejected by
proper-thinking Republicans that the party's hatchet men will be put
on a tight leash _ or asked to join Goodin in the search for honest
work. And perhaps the incident will convince Democratic gut-fighters
these negative attacks have gone too far.
   This doesn't mean questions of political ethics should stop being
asked. They just should be asked in an honest, straightforward
manner.

   The Greenville (S.C.) News on the GOP memo about Foley:
   Lee Atwater, the Republican Party's national chairman, said he
had no prior knowledge of a memo dripping with innuendo about newly
elected House Speaker Tom Foley.
   But in the end it does not matter whether the GOP chairman knew
about the memo, authored by Atwater aide Mark Goodin, because it was
a perfect expression of Atwater-style politics.
   In fact, it has been reported that Atwater's first response to
Goodin's mischief was that it wasn't ``out of bounds.'' The memo
came from Goodin's desk, but the ultimate inspiration for it is
clear.
   Goodin resigned his post as communications director for the
Republican National Committee, which means only that both he and
Atwater got off too easily.
   But Goodin was a small potato in the foul-tasting political stew
Atwater has been cooking since entering politics. This whole episode
is not about Goodin's bush league indiscretion; it's about Lee
Atwater's standards of political conduct. ...
   A fervent hope is that this episode will mark the beginning of
the end of Atwater's politics of sleaze.
   White House Chief of Staff John Sununu described the memo as
``wrong not because it damages our relationship with the Democrats.
It's wrong because it's wrong.'' Sununu said both he and President
Bush had reprimanded Atwater. But the president needs to go much
further than he did. ...
   If he continues to support Atwater as leader of the party, he
will share responsibility for Atwater's activities. Bush is too
decent and too capable a person to need what Atwater has to offer,
and the GOP doesn't need it either.

   The Seattle Times on AIDS:
   As the reports at the past week's international conference in
Montreal make clear, the search for effective defenses against AIDS
continues to be a maddeningly slow proposition.
   More and more, the acquired immune deficiency syndrome is
assuming a strong resemblance to cancer. With no magic bullets
likely to be found anytime soon, AIDS increasingly is regarded as a
disease that is here to stay. Breakthroughs toward improved
treatment and even cures most likely will occur one plodding,
methodical step at a time.
   Many of the data presented at Montreal were a repeat of
information already made public in numerous reports in scientific
journals. A striking exception was the presentation by Dr. Jonas
Salk, the polio-vaccine pioneer, on the research he's been doing
with colleagues at the National Institutes of Health and at the
University of Southern California.
   Salk expressed restrained optimism that an experimental vaccine
he has developed eventually could immunize people already infected
with HIV, the AIDS virus, against developing the disease itself. ...
   Members of Salk's team told The New York Times they did not want
to ``raise false hopes.'' Still, amid the years of frustration and
bleak despair over the incurability of AIDS _ despite billions of
dollars in research spending _ the Salk report afforded at least one
very welcome bright spot.

   OK, fellow Americans, it comes down to this. Yes, you are willing

   In Vermont, the answer seems to be yes. ... The Vermont
Legislature has passed a bill that would halt the sale or
registration of vehicles equipped with air-conditioners that use
chlorofluorocarbon, a coolant know to eat the earth's protective
ozone layer. ..
   Ah, but does Vermont's commendable social conscience come too
easily? Even in the depths of July, the temperature then averages a
mild 70 degrees (and) ... only about half of Vermont drivers bother
to buy cars (equipped with air conditioners).

sticky, huh?

cancer, eye disease, plant and animal deaths, food chain disruptions

reactors:
   The Bush administration's plan to build two new military
(nuclear) reactors in South Carolina and Idaho should be shelved.
   Defense Department officials, used to crying ``national defense''
at the drop of a hat, believe we need additional reactor-generated
tritium, a radioactive gas, for nuclear warheads. We need to have
more than enough, they argue, because unilateral disarmament is
otherwise inevitable.
   But the idea of spending $6.8 billion over the next 10 years to
put up the reactors, considering the safety problems with the rest
of this country's reactors, makes absolutely no sense.
   We don't need more tritium. We instead need Defense Department
officials who don't use ``national security'' jargon as an excuse to
ask for anything under the sun _ including $6.8 billion nuclear
reactors.

   President Bush today praised the efforts of
Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries to bring peace to strife-torn
Lebanon.
   Bush, meeting with visiting Saudi Arabian Foreign Minister Prince
Saud Al-Faisal, said: ``They are engaged in a mission that comes
with the greatest of intentions and met with the strong,
enthusiastic support of the United States, as they try to be helpful
in bringing peace to Lebanon.''
   The meeting, scheduled for a half-hour, lasted more than 75
minutes. Saud emerged from the White House to tell reporters: ``I
shall convey to our leaders when I get back that we have the full
support of the United States government in this regard, and this is
something we are very pleased with.''
   He said Bush gave ``a very positive response to the preparation
that has happened so far.''
   ``We agree on the objective and we agree that the machinery that
we are following now is a good machinery that requires support of
all actors on the Lebanese question,'' said Saud.
   The Saudi official told the president, ``We're going to work very
hard on this.''
   Reporters, on hand to witness the opening of the Oval Office
meeting, overheard Bush reply, ``I think the kingdom (Saudi Arabia)
in such a key role and such a respect level, that perhaps your
active involvement will make the difference.''
   ``All communities in this country are concerned about it, as I'm
sure you know from your knowledge of the States,'' Bush told the
Princeton-educated Saud. ``Then when I was in the Vatican, why they,
His Holiness (Pope John Paul II) expressed a grave concern about
it.''
   ``So the fact that you all are taking this initiative is most
appreciated by everybody. So we'll see what happens,'' the president
said.
   When reporters asked about the initiative, Bush replied:
   ``I'm anxious to visit with the foreign minister of Saudi Arabia
on that. But they are engaged in a mission that comes with the
greatest of intentions and met with the strong, enthusiastic support
of the United States, as they try to be helpful in bringing peace to
Lebanon. That's something we're all very much concerned about.''
   The Arab League has been attempting to negotiate a truce in
Lebanon between Syrian-backed Druze forces and Christian militia.
   Fifteen foreigners are believed being held hostage in Lebanon,
nine of them Americans, including Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press.
   The Arab League, at a summit in Casablanca, Morocco, in late May,
appointed Saudi Arabia's King Fahd and two other leaders to
spearhead efforts to negotiate peace between the warring Moslems and
Christians in Lebanon.
   The league gave Fahd, King Hassan II of Morocco and Algeria's
President Chadli Bendjedid six months to pursue the settlement.
   They were charged to supervise a cease-fire, reconvene Lebanon's
parliament, arrange the appointment of a president and amend the
constitution to provide a better political balance between the
feuding Moslems and Christians.
   The league's peace overture envisions a pullout of Syrian troops
from Lebanon.

   The Senate Agriculture Committee unanimously
passed a rural development program today after Senate leaders agreed
to tackle drought relief next month.
   The insistence Tuesday by Senate Republican leader Bob Dole of
Kansas that the Senate pass drought relief for winter wheat farmers
in his state and elsewhere before rural development had threatened
to cripple both pieces of legislation, Democratic committee members
today.
   However, committee Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., and the panel's
ranking Republican, Sen. Richard Lugar of Indiana, announced they
had agreed to move forward with the rural development bill and act
on drought relief July 19.
   ``I think everything has been accomplished,'' Leahy said. ``I
think we have guaranteed we will have a feasible rural development
bill on the floor.''
   Lugar said: ``We've agreed that we're going to work for passage
of these two bills.''
   Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, has promised that the
Senate would act on the rural development program this summer and
send it to the House, which does not have any similar legislation.
   Dole had argued in a committee meeting Tuesday that quick action
on drought relief for winter wheat should take precedence over rural
development legislation.
   Kansas winter wheat farmers have been wiped out by the early
spring drought, said Dole, who has sponsored a bill extending terms
of 1988 drought relief to crops planted in 1988 for harvest this
year, namely winter wheat.
   ``In my state, rural development means drought relief,'' Dole
said.
   Winter wheat crop losses in Kansas, the hardest hit of all the
states, have been estimated to be $1.6 billion, said Dole.
   However, Dole's objections threatened to scuttle both pieces of
legislation, because some senators were objecting to provisions in
the rural development bill. Other farm-state lawmakers, including
Sen. Kent Conrad, D-N.D., did not want to pass a drought-relief bill
before it was known how extensive the dry weather would be this year.
   Conrad's state was devastated by drought last year and experts
are still concerned about dry soil conditions in the upper Midwest.
   The 132-page rural development legislation would provide $100
million in federal seed money for revolving loan funds as well as
$200 million to improve education, health services, communications
and utilities in rural areas to encourage business expansion.
   Leahy said drought relief legislation would be discussed July 13
with a committee vote July 19.
   Rural development is a high priority as Congress moves toward
designing the 1990 omnibus farm bill. A House subcommittee has been
holding hearings to gather information on the needs in communities
rapidly losing population because of depressed economic conditions.
   Leahy said he wants the Senate bill to move quickly so the House
would have time to work with it this year. But he has been opposed
to passing any drought relief bill until it is clear whether spring
crops have been damaged.

   Queen Elizabeth II conferred an honorary knighthood
on former President Reagan today, the highest honor Britain can give
a foreigner.
   ``I feel greatly honored,'' Reagan said as he left Buckingham
Palace holding the insignia of the knighthood: a star, badge and
crimson silk sash. ``I can't say how proud I am.''
   The queen, standing alongside Reagan, warned him jokingly,
``Don't drop them.''
   Buckingham Palace announced the award as Reagan and his wife,
Nancy, lunched with the queen and her husband Prince Philip on the
fourth day of his British visit.
   The palace said the queen made Reagan an Honorary Knight Grand
Cross of the Most Honorable Order of the Bath, an order established
in 1725 that recognizes services to Britain.
   Reagan is the 58th American to receive an honorary knighthood. It
is the highest honor Britain bestows on Americans, but only Britons
can use the title ``Sir.''
   The Reagans arrived in a four-car motorcade at a private entrance
to the palace and were greeted on the steps in brilliant sunshine by
Prince Philip.
   The queen met them inside for the lunch, which was attended by
just the two couples.
   The Reagans, on their first visit to Britain since leaving the
White House in January, arrived Sunday and are due to leave for
Paris on Thursday.
   Burke's Peerage, which chronicles the British aristocracy, said
earlier that Reagan had accepted the offer of an honorary
knighthood. Buckingham Palace previously had refused to confirm or
deny its intentions.
   On Tuesday night, the Reagans dined with Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher. Guests included British actors Peter Ustinov and Richard
Todd and best-selling novelist Frederick Forsyth at what a Thatcher
aide called ``a jolly evening.''
   Earlier in the day, Reagan addressed The English Speaking Union
in the Guildhall, the 1,000-year-old seat of London city government,
where he spoke as president 13 months ago.
   Reagan said Soviet Leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev was possibly his
country's only hope for change, and ``we should take the risk'' of
believing he is serious about arms control.
   Of China, the former U.S. president said: ``The Chinese
government hasn't learned something very elementary: You can't
massacre an idea. You cannot run tanks over hope. You cannot riddle
a people's yearning with bullets.''
   Several members of Mrs. Thatcher's governing Conservative Party
had recommended a high honor for Reagan.
   Harold Brooks-Baker, publishing director of Burke's Peerage, said
Monday that Reagan was offered a knighthood ``because of his special
contribution to the British government under Mrs. Thatcher. He
helped Mrs. Thatcher in the Falklands War and in many different
ways.''
   The United States provided naval intelligence, communications
facilities and political support to Britain during its 1982 war
against Argentina over the Falkland Islands in the south Atlantic.
   Most British honors are made on the recommendation of the prime
minister and formally awarded by the queen. Buckingham Palace said
awards to foreign officials must be recommended by the Foreign
Office.
   The Order of the Bath is one of the highest orders of chivalry
and had its origins in the knights appointed at the coronations of
Saxon kings.
   Reagan's defense secretary, Caspar Weinberger, was awarded an
honorary knighthood in February 1988, but in a lower order, that of
the British Empire.
   Other Americans who have received honorary knighthoods include
President Eisenhower, former Secretary of State Dean Rusk,
philanthropists Paul Mellon and John Paul Getty II, actors Douglas
Fairbanks Jr. and Sidney Poitier, former U.S. Sen. William
Fulbright, D-Ark., and food magnate Henry J. Heinz II.

   After starting their first atomic chain
reaction, officials at the long-delayed Seabrook plant said they
know how Thomas Edison must have felt when he lit the first electric
light bulb in 1879.
   ``We certainly haven't reinvented the light bulb,'' Seabrook's
top executive, Edward Brown, said Tuesday. ``But we believe there is
great significance in our success.
   ``Have we changed history? Some people are saying so,'' Brown
said. ``Seabrook Station has faced one of the longest, most
convoluted licensing processes that any commercial nuclear power
plant has ever encountered in this world.''
   The plant symbolizes the troubled state of the nation's nuclear
power industry. Seabrook's owners originally planned two reactors at
a cost of $973 million, the first to start commercial operation 10
years ago. But repeated regulatory delays drove the first reactor's
pricetag up to $6 billion and forced cancellation of the second
reactor, 25 percent complete.
   The plant also became a focus of anti-nuclear activism. Protests
since construction began in 1976 have resulted in more than 3,200
arrests, including 734 arrests in two days of civil disobedience
earlier this month.
   Despite its woes, the seaside plant was completed in July 1986
and last month won its low-power testing license, which allows it to
conduct tests at up to 5 percent of full power.
   Three faulty safety valves set back the start of fission by about
a week, but at 5:23 p.m. Tuesday, Seabrook operators started a chain
reaction in the plant's 100 tons of uranium fuel.
   Operators plan to conduct tests for about seven days at power
levels ranging from a fraction of 1 percent to 3 percent of capacity.
   Tests continued smoothly today at 0.01 percent of power, plant
spokesman Ron Sher said. The reactor was at up to 1 percent during
the night as operators tested properties of the uranium fuel, Sher
said.
   On Tuesday, about 30 Seabrook workers broke into applause and
shook hands when told the reactor had split its first atoms.
   ``We have crossed the threshold,'' said Joseph Grillo, the
operations manager. ``We are in the homestretch toward full-power
operation, and everyone here is excited about it.''
   Still unresolved is whether Seabrook will ever operate
commercially. It must win federal approval for evacuation plans for
crowded beaches and communities up to 10 miles away _ including six
communities in Massachusetts, which refuses to cooperate.
   Seabrook has developed its own evacuation plans for
Massachusetts, and Nuclear Regualtory Commission licensing board
hearings on them are expected to finish later this month. Seabrook
officials hope to win a commercial license this fall.
   Plant foes, led by Massachusetts Attorney General James Shannon,
have promised to fight to the U.S. Supreme Court if necessary to
block a commercial license.
   But Brown, president of Seabrook operator New Hampshire Yankee,
was confident the plant would run commercially.
   ``The opposition also said they were going to take us to court on
the low-power license. They didn't win,'' Brown said.
   ``It's inevitable this plant is going to operate, and we'd be
much better off if (Massachusetts) would participate in emergency
planning.''
   Seabrook's owners also may have to prove they are financially
qualified to run the plant commercially. Lead owner Public Service
Co. of New Hampshire is under federal bankruptcy protection, and
some of the other 11 New England utilities with stakes in the plant
also face financial problems.

   The death toll from a gas explosion that engulfed
two trains on the Trans-Siberian Railroad has surpassed 600, and
more people are dying daily, a newspaper reported today.
   The daily Sotsialisticheskaya Industriya quoted Deputy Prosecutor
Vladimir Kravtsev as saying the bodies of 379 passengers killed in
the June 4 blast have been recovered.
   In addition, a government commission investigating the accident
has declared dead 228 people who were known to have been aboard the
trains but who cannot be located.
   That makes the total number of dead 607, as compared to the
previous official toll of 400.
   Kravtsev said 1,284 passengers had been aboard the trains when a
spark from the railway's electrical line ignited a highly flammable
mixture of benzene and propane-butane gas that leeline about a haaked from
a
piplf-mile away.
   The trains, traveling in opposite directions between Siberia's
largest city, Novosibirsk, and the Black Sea resort city of Adler,
had made unscheduled stops in a valley in the Ural Mountains about
750 miles southeast of Moscow.
   One train was carrying schoolchildren to vacation camps in the
southern Soviet Union.
   A total of 334 victims are hospitalized in grave condition, and
eight of them died Tuesday alone, the newspaper reported.

   Authorities today announced the arrest of two of
21 student leaders wanted for roles in the pro-democracy movement
and ordered two Western reporters expelled for their reporting on
the martial law crackdown.
   Given three days to leave were John Pomfret of The Associated
Press and Voice of America bureau chief Alan Pessin.
   The British Broadcasting Corp. in Beijing initially reported that
Brian Barron, its Far Eastern TV correspondent also was ordered out,
but later said ``it was just a mistake.''
   The expulsion order came as authorities intensified criticism of
the United States and pressed on with a nationwide clampdown on
dissent that has already netted more than 1,000 arrests.
   Communist authorities have criticized VOA, whose short-wave
broadcasts are an important source of information for Chinese, as
spreading ``distortions.'' They have also condemned Washington for
sheltering Chinese dissident Fang Lizhi and his wife, Li Shuxian, at
the U.S. Embassy.
   U.S. diplomats in China t were wounded. It said about 100 civilians
were killed and nearly 1,000 injured.
   The figures were lower than those given last week by a government
spokesman, who said nearly 300 people were killed, including many
soldiers. Chinese witnesses and Western intelligence estimates say
about 3,000 people were killed, most of them civilians.
   The government crackdown on dissent continued unabated, with
national television announcing the arrest of two student leaders of
the seven-week movement for a freer society.
   National television said one of 21 student leaders of the
pro-democracy movement, Zhou Fengsuo, was arrested in the central
city of Xian after being turned in by his sister and her husband,
who works at an air force academy.
   Pictures of Zhou, a 22-year-old physics student at Qinghua
University in Beijing, and the other activists were flashed on
television Tuesday and today and appeared in today's newspapers with
appeals for people to turn them in.
   The evening television news showed Zhou sitting in a police
station being questioned.
   A later report said Xiong Yan, 24, a graduate student of law at
Beijing University, also was arrested but gave no details. He also
was shown being questioned.
   Television also reported that Fang Ke, a member of the
independent student union that led the protests, surrendered to
police in the central Chinese city of Wuhan. It identified Fang as a
philosophy student at People's University in Beijing.
   Authorities have ordered all students and workers active in the
squashed pro-democracy movement to turn themselves in.
   Among them were Wu'er Kaixi, a Beijing Normal University student
who in a televised meeting in May told Premier Li Peng to ``stop
beating around the bush'' because China faced a political crisis.''
   The government accused the 21 of ``inciting and organizing
counter-revolutionary rebellion in Beijing'' during the movement for
a dialogue with the government, free speech and an end to official
corruption.
   Beijing Radio said 32 people, including workers, were arrested
while trying to flee from the capital's railway station. Troops and
police have set up checkpoints at the railway station and have been
inspecting bags and identification papers.
   The People's Daily editorial continued to attack both Fang and
the United States for sheltering him. ``Some foreigners who are
hostile to China praise them (Fang and Li) and make them out to be
`democracy fighters.' In so doing, they can't but dream of using
Fang Lizhi and others to throw China into chaos,'' it said.
   The Xinhua report claimed that student protesters had received
funds and materials from ``overseas reactionary political forces,''
but did not specify the sources. Student groups in the West and Hong
Kong had openly sent donations to the students.
   Xinhua also attacked a 33-foot-tall statue modeled on the U.S.
Statue of Liberty that the students erected in Tiananmen Square, as
``an attempt to stir up worship of American-style `freedom and
democracy.'''
   The offensive against foreign criticism was begun Tuesday by
Premier Li, who accused ``a small number of nations'' of using
China's political troubles to ``spread all kinds of rumors, stir up
anti-China sentiments and put pressure on us.''
   Almost all Western countries have condemned China's violent
suppression of the student movement and warned of economic sanctions
if human rights abuses continue. The Bush administration has cut off
military aid and sales to China.
   There were unconfirmed reports that the party Central Committee
would hold a plenary session soon to officially remove party chief
Zhao Ziyang from office. He has not been seen in public since May
19, the day before martial law was declared in Beijing.

   A chlorine gas container exploded at a water supply
station near the Siberian city of Khabarovsk, releasing a cloud of
toxic gas that forced scores of people to seek treatment, Tass said
Wednesday. At least 27 were hospitalized.
   Civil defense teams, firefighters and army specialists managed to
halt the gas leak, which occurred Tuesday, the official news agency
said.
   A large number of vacationers, mostly children, were near the
site on the Amur River at the time, and 70 were brought to the
hospital, Tass said. Of those, 27 were admitted and four were in
serious condition, it added.
   The complex provides water to Khabarovsk, a city of about 500,000
people located 3,600 miles east of Moscow, Tass said.
   Authorities set up a commission to investigate the accident, Tass
said.

<HEAD>Holocaust Survivor Sentenced to 3 Years For Acid Attack</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A court Wednesday sentenced a 71-year-old
Holocaust survivor to three years in prison for hurling acid in the
face of an Israeli lawyer who represents convicted Nazi war criminal
John Demjanjuk.
   Yisrael Yehezkieli also was sentenced to two years' probation and
ordered to pay $11,000 in compensation to victim Yoram Sheftel, said
a clerk of the Jerusalem District Court.
   Israel radio quoted Yehezkieli as saying after the sentencing
that he did not regret the attack and that he would appeal.
   Yehezkieli was convicted in March of aggravated assault, a charge
that carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.
   The acid attack occurred during the December 1988 funeral of
another Demjanjuk attorney, Dov Eitan, who had committed suicide.
   Sheftel suffered eye damage from the acid. As a result, the
appeal of Demjanjuk's conviction and death penalty has been
postponed until November.
   Demjanjuk, a 69-year-old Ohio autoworker born in the Ukraine, was
sentenced to death in April 1988 for crimes against humanity and
crimes against the Jewish people.
   He was convicted after the court established he was ``Ivan the
Terrible,'' a Nazi guard who operated the gas chambers at the
Treblinka death camp in German-occupied Poland during World War II.
Demjanjuk says he is a victim of mistaken identity.
   About 850,000 Jews were killed in Treblinka, including most
members of Yehezkieli's family.
   Yehezkieli attended most of the 14-month trial and several times
was ordered out of the courtroom for disrupting the proceedings.

<TEXT>
   Cardinal Joseph Malula, a leading Roman
Catholic prelate in Africa who fought for church rights in Zaire,
died Wednesday at the age of 71.
   Malula died in Louvain, Belgium, after a long illness.
   Malula, a native of the former Belgian Congo, was appointed
archbishop of Kinshasa, the capital, in 1964. Five years later, Pope
Paul VI elevated him to cardinal.
   In the early 1970s, President Mobutu Sese Seko launched an
Africanization program that tried to sharply curtail the power of
the church. Baptismal names were banned, teaching of religion was
abolished in all schools and Catholic bishops were barred from
holding meetings or traveling around the country.
   Malula protested, was denounced by Mobutu, and went into exile in
Rome.
   The restrictions proved unpopular and were gradually lifted.
Malula returned to the country and the church and state began a
reconciliation.
   Pope John Paul II, who has twice visited Zaire, sent a condolence
message to the church in Zaire praising the cardinal's long service
to the church.
   Malula's death reduced the number of cardinals under the age of
80 _ those eligible to vote in the election of a pope _ to 117.

   The Indianapolis Star on China:
   The United States is right to ignore Chinese communist demands to
turn over astrophysicist Fang Lizhi, who with his wife has been
granted refuge in the U.S. Embassy at Beijing.
   Fang, although he remained aloof from the demonstrations in May,
had made a personal enemy of chief communist Deng Xiaoping earlier
when he criticized Marxism and the Chinese leadership publicly. That
led to his expulsion from the Communist Party in 1987.
   A government campaign to cast Fang as the organizer of an effort
to overthrow the communist leadership is one of many harsh steps now
being taken against students and others who demonstrated peacefully
for greater personal and press freedom. The action is exposing the
government's true colors. ...
   At present the totalitarians in China have the upper hand. But
their time may be running out.
   The United States should intensify its Voice of America
broadcasts to mainland China and step up its criticism of the brutal
military suppression of peaceful students whose only crime was
seeking the freedoms now enjoyed by most of the non-communist world.

   Albuquerque (N.M.) Journal on China:
   President Bush, who originally sought to keep the door open to
normal relations with China through the vicious military crackdown
on the student uprising, is pursuing a lost cause.
   Normalcy _ at least the normalcy of a China with a slowly
liberalizing government responsive to the will of the people _ no
longer exists in China. Any vestige was suspended in Beijing the
night the 27th Army opened fire on civilians in Tiananmen Square,
and has been put to rout across the nation since then.
   The aging, hard-line Communist leaders waging a campaign of
terror against their own people do not deserve continued tolerance
from the United States. ...
   There can be no business and cultural relations with a government
with as much blood on its hands and repression in its plans as the
terrorist government of Deng, Li and Yang.

struggle in Beijing was also refreshing. ...
   At times ... Bush has seemed overcautious without reason. But

   Medellin, Colombia, is a sophisticated city of one million people
high in an Andean valley. It is Colombia's chief commercial and
manufacturing center, is home to the University of Antioquia and the
National School of Mines, has a medical center that has successfully
done eight human heart transplants _ and is being violently
depopulated at the rate of 10 murders per day.
   That ... makes Medellin the homicide capital of the world,
excluding war-zones like Beirut. This is because Medellin has become
the world's cocaine production capital. ...
   Smart Americans do not go there: they are automatically presumed
by the locals to be Drug Enforcement Administration agents. The DEA,

habit of turning up dead, and tongueless. ...

   The Phoenix Gazette on the Polish elections:
   Following the example of Soviet voters who crossed the names of
party candidates off their ballots in recent elections ... Polish
voters overwhelmingly rejected a special, uncontested slate of 35
prominent Communist Party officials.
   The communist government of Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski has conceded
Poland's freest elections in four decades to Solidarity by a
landslide.
   Unfortunately, post-election euphoria is likely to be
short-lived. Solidarity leader Lech Walesa told his supporters:
``Our political victories will mean nothing if we don't improve the
economy.''
   Walesa has succeeded in legalizing Solidarity and in giving it a
voice in the government, but the union will also share in the blame
if economic reforms fail. ...
   In the future, Walesa's most difficult task might not be holding
the government to its promises, but keeping the support of impatient

   The Register-Guard, Eugene, Ore., on saving elephants:
   Poachers are killing Africa's elephants at such a rate that the
world's largest land animals will be extinct within 20 years.
   The best way to protect the elephants is to put the poachers out
of business. And the best way to do that is to shut down the world
market for ivory.
   President Bush did his part ... by banning ivory imports; other
nations should follow.
   Marine mammals ... are the source of part of the world's ivory,
but most of it comes from elephant tusks. Ten years ago there were
an estimated 1.5 million elephants in Africa. Now there are about
500,000. Organized poachers are killing 200 to 300 a day.
   Last year the United States imported $32.2 million worth of
ivory, or 10 to 15 percent of the world's total. Bush's decision to
ban imports closes the door to a significant segment of the market.
   A drop in demand would tend to push world prices down, thereby
reducing poachers' incentives.
   Other nations should quickly impose bans of their own.

<TEXT>
   With 10 million copies sold
worldwide, Mikhail S. Gorbachev's book ``Perestroika'' is a runaway
hit _and a source of revenue for the communist nation.
   The West German publishers of the Soviet president's book said
Wednesday they alone have sold 700,000 copies, grossing $1.5 million
thus far.
   ``Gorbachev gets about 10 percent of that,'' said Peter Schaper,
business manager of Droemer-Knauer Publishers, which published the
book in West Germany.
   Gorbachev has said that part of the proceeds from the book are to
be given to the Communist Party in the Soviet Union, with the rest
used for social projects, such as aid to the victims of the
earthquake in Armenia.
   Schaper, in an interview with Saarland state radio, estimated
that 10 million copies have been sold worldwide.
   Schaper said he had no figures on Soviet proceeds from worldwide
sales of the book, although an estimate of $5 million to $7.5 millon
was reasonable.
   ``Perestroika,'' which outlines the Kremlin leader's course for
reform, has been on the bestseller lists in West Germany since it
went on sale last year for about $20.
   Schaper said 100,000 copies of the paperback version have also
been sold in West Germany, although it only recently arrived at
bookstores.
   Gorbachev arrived in West Germany for a four-day official visit
on Monday, and has received tumultuous receptions everywhere he has
gone.

   A chemical attack on the 500-year-old Treaty
Oak has nature-lovers gathering under its boughs to pray for the
ailing tree.
   Mayor Pro Tem Sally Shipman called the poisoning ``an insult to
every generation of Texans,'' and the company that manufactures the
chemical has offered a $10,000 reward for the conviction of the
vandals.
   ``People feel very strongly about this part of our heritage. ...
You will find people in Austin that have said, `I've got to go sit
with the tree a while.' It makes them feel like they're trying,''
Ms. Shipman said Tuesday.
   Officials have roped off the area, and someone tied a banner
urging, ``Get well soon.''
   The tree is nearly 50 feet tall and its trunk has a diameter of
52 inches. Legend has it Stephen F. Austin signed a treaty with the
Indians under its branches, but historians say there is little
foundation for the belief.
   Vandals poured the herbicide Velpar, made by the Du Pont Co. near
Houston, around the base of the oak several months ago. The poison
has turned patches of leaves brown.
   ``I think it's just one of those things where we have to wait and
see. We've done all the treatments that we can do,'' said John
Giedraitis, city forester. ``Now it's really up to the tree.''
   Giedraitis said he proposed to his wife under the tree.

   Vice President Dan Quayle declared
today there is a consensus among Central American allies for U.S.
positions on Nicaragua and Panama and said he warned Salvadoran
rightists not to cause ``any embarrassment'' to newly elected
President Alfredo Cristiani.
   In a news conference this morning on the last day of his
three-day swing through Central America, Quayle also won support
from Costa Rican President Oscar Arias for his denunciation of the
preparations in leftist Nicaragua for elections next February.
   Arias told reporters that so far, ``having fair and open
elections .. is not possible,'' with the election laws that have
been put in place to deal with candidate access to the media.
   `They will have to meet at least a minimum standard so as to be
considered legitimate,'' Arias said.
   Quayle, asked about his meeting Tuesday with Roberto D'Aubuisson
and other members of the rightist Arena party in San Salvador, said
he was firm in telling them not to interfere with Cristiani's
moderate approach.
   `I made it very clear our position on human rights. I made it
very clear to them I did not want to see any embarrassment of
Cristiani,'' he said.
   Quayle's press secretary, David Beckwith, told reporters earlier
that D'Aubuisson nodded when the vice president pulled him aside and
made the demand. The four other Arena politicians present said
Cristiani ``would be vigilant'' and punish anyone who committed
violations, Beckwith said.
   D'Aubuisson and Arena have denied links to squads that engage in
political torture and executions. Cristiani has pledged commitment
to human rights as well, but concerns have been voiced by
congressional critics that Cristiani's election might spark a rise
in such activity.
   Quayle was completing his whirlwind tour of Central America today
after his talks with Arias on Nicaragua and Panama. The vice
president has visited Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador and Costa
Rica.
   ``I have been on a mission of peace and democracy,'' he told
reporters on arrival at the San Jose airport Tuesday evening before
he headed to a reception hosted by Arias. ``I look forward to
meeting with the author of Esquipulas II, President Arias.''
   Esquipulas II refers to the 1987 regional peace accord signed by
the five Central American presidents. It called for a cessation of
Nicaragua's civil war, democratic elections there, disarmament of
the Contra rebels, amnesty for them, and a ban on aid to insurgent
movements by the signatory countries.
   In El Salvador, Quayle also met with leftist politicians Ruben
Zamora and Guillermo Ungo and urged them to sever ties with the
Marxist-led guerrillas who have fought the government since 1979,
Beckwith said. They did not agree to do so, and likewise refused
Quayle's plea that they tell the rebels to lay down their arms, he
said.
   During his three-day trip, Quayle has kept up a stream of
criticism against Nicaragua, the one Central American country he is
not visiting.
   On Tuesday he heatedly accused Nicaragua's Sandinista government
of shipping a large cache of weapons to the Salvadoran guerrillas in
violation of the Esquipulas accord.
   He viewed the assorted assault rifles, anti-tank rockets and
other weapons and ammunition displayed in the Defense Ministry
courtyard.
   Quayle said they were of Soviet bloc and Cuban manufacture and
were shipped thorough Nicaragua.
   ``Nicaragua is visibly displayed right here,'' he said. ``They
are weapons that are made to try to kill democracy here in El
Salvador.''
   Although the United States is backing the diplomatic approach
leading to free elections in Nicaragua next February, Quayle voiced
doubts a fair election will occur.
   ``Right now Nicaragua is in violation of the Esquipulas II
agreement,'' he said at a news conference. ``You have to be somewhat
skeptical'' about the Sandinistas following through on other
promises they have made to allow democratic reforms.

   Activists will unveil a replica of the ``Goddess
of Democracy'' that was erected in Beijing to show that soldiers and
tanks cannot crush the passion for democracy, a spokesman said
Wednesday.
   Chinese students erected the goddess, modeled on the Statue of
Liberty, in Tiananmen Square to symbolize their movement for greater
freedom.
   The communist government branded it an insult to China, and a
tank smashed it on the morning of June 4 as troops drove students
from the square and crushed their movement.
   Chinese students also erected a likeness of the statue at Fudan
University in Shanghai. Authorities tore that statue down Monday as
the government pressed its campaign of nationwide arrests to stamp
out the democracy movement.
   A group of Hong Kong artists studied news photographs of the
goddess and fashioned a 33-foot likeness from plastic foam.
   A pro-democracy rally is planned for Sunday when ``the Statue of
Democracy and Freedom'' goes up in Victoria Park, said Kwong
Wai-lap, a spokesman for the artists.
   ``We believe freedom and democracy can never been crushed by
military force and slaughter,'' Kwong said Wednesday.
   He said about 20 artists carved the statue. Another 40 students
from the Academy for Performing Arts, the Chinese University of Hong
Kong and the Hong Kong Polytechnic worked on the project, which took
a week to complete.
   Since the Chinese crackdown on demonsrators, supporters of the
students have erected replicas of the goddess statue in parks in
Washington and in Taipei, Taiwan, whose government lost a war to the
communists on the Chinese mainland in 1949.
   The crackdown provoked widespread fear and anger among Hong
Kong's 5.5 million people, who will be under Chinese rule when
Britain returns to the colony to China in 1997.
   Hong Kong residents have held huge rallies, donated money for the
Chinese students and flooded China with letters, phone calls and
fascimiles supporting the movement for democracy. Some reportedly
have been arrested while joining protests there.
   Szeto Wah, a lawmaker speaking for the Hong Kong Alliance in
Support of the Patriotic Democratic Movement in China, said the
group is collecting a list of names of the dead and injured in hopes
of helping their families.
   On Tuesday, a group of lawyers opened telephone hot lines to
collect witness accounts of the military crackdown to challenge
denials in the official Chinese media. The accounts will be sent to
the U.N. Human Rights Commission and the European Human Rights
Commission, a spokeswoman said.
   The Chinese government says nearly 300 people were killed, most
of them soldiers, in the crackdown. Chinese witnesses and Western
intelligence reports say the toll could be as high as 3,000, and
that most of the dead were unarmed civilians.

<HEAD>Boston University Moves Quickly After Takeover Bill is Signed</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Boston University intends to start overhauling
Chelsea's troubled school system immediately despite lawsuits from
teachers and parents.
   After Gov. Michael S. Dukakis on Tuesday signed a bill turning
management of the schools over to BU for a decade, Dean of Education
Peter Greer hurried to the airport for a fund-raising meeting in
Vermont to help pay for improvements.
   ``We've been waiting so long, it doesn't seem possible that it's
happened,'' Greer said. ``We want a good start.''
   The unprecedented takeover of a public school system by a private
university is likely to be watched closely by other colleges and
school districts around the country.
   Chelsea, a poor, largely Spanish-speaking city just outside
Boston, expects to receive about $3 million per year through BU. Its
schools, none built later than 1917, will be renovated or replaced,
and the university will retrain teachers.
   By fall, Greer said, innovative nutritional counseling and early
childhood education prgrams will be in place in the 3,300-student
district.
   The legislation calls for a committee to make sure BU abides by
state open-meeting and public-records laws.
   Teachers have expressed concern that the agreement will allow
personnel decisions to be made in private, and their union has sued
to challenge the plan.
   Hispanic parents also sued, alleging that they were left out of
the planning. They referred to the BU plan as a ``hostile takeover.''
   More than half of Chelsea's students are Hispanic.
   The district has one of the highest dropout rates in the state at
17 percent. The teen pregnancy rate of 14 percent is the highest in
the state, and nearly half the city's households earn less than
$10,000 per year.
   Chelsea Mayor John Brennan defended the BU plan, saying, ``This
will save generations of children to come from being dropouts.''

   Highlights of West German-Soviet
economic relations:
   _ West Germany is the Soviet Union's largest Western trading
partner, with a trade turnover that has ranged from $7.5 billion to
$12.5 billion in the past decade. The two nations traded $8 billion
in goods last year, about 58 percent of which were West German
exports.
   _ West Germany mostly ships heavy machinery to the Soviet Union,
while imports from the Soviet Union are mostly made up of raw
materials like oil, natural gas and timber.
   _ West German exports to the Soviet Union surged 20 percent last
year, a jump that industry analysts attribute to increased business
opportunities created by Gorbachev's domestic economic reforms.
Still, only about 1.5 percent of West Germany's total exports go to
the Soviet Union.
   _ West German companies have forged 70 joint ventures in the
Soviet Union, ranging from machine-tool manufacturing to the
production of consumer goods.
   _ The two nations signed 12 co-production agreements in 1988,
bringing the number of such agreements to 30. Another 30 are under
negotiation.
   _ In 1988, a consortium of nine West German banks approved a
record $1.53 billion line of credit to the Soviet Union for use in
improving the nation's consumer products industry. However, the
credits are tied to specific projects and only about one-third of
the funds have been borrowed to date.
   _ The Soviet Union and West Germany have signed agreements to
ease capital investment restrictions and to encourage additional
joint ventures and business exchanges.

   Israeli warplanes attacked a forest air
raid shelter filled with Palestinian guerrillas Wednesday, killing
four and wounding nine, police reported.
   They said members of four pro-Syrian guerrilla organizations
regularly evacuated nearby bases during the day in case of Israeli
raids and went to the camouflaged hideout in hills southeast of
Beirut.
   ``The Israelis raided them in their shelter,'' a police spokesman
said.
   Police also reported three people killed in artillery exchanges
between Syrian and Christian forces in and around Beirut.
   That raised the casualties in 13 weeks of artillery duels to 370
killed and 1,441 wounded. The shooting began March 8 between
Christian army units led by Gen. Michel Aoun and a Moslem alliance
of Syrian soldiers and Druse militiamen.
   Six Israeli warplanes fired 10 rockets during two passes at the
Palestinian shelter in pine woods just outside Bshamoun, a hilltop
village eight miles southeast of Beirut, ``reducing it to ashes,''
the police spokesman said.
   He said it was used by the Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine, Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine,
Palestine Popular Struggle front and Palestine Liberation Front, all
PLO factions with headquarters in Damascus, Syria.
   Flames and smoke rose from the woods after the raid. Guerrillas
fired automatic weapons into the air to warn journalists away.
   ``They've raided our base!'' one shouted. ``I'll shoot whoever
approaches the area.''
   Four ambulances raced along dusty trails into the woods to
retrieve the wounded. Rescuers said they were taken to the Kamal
Jumblatt hospital in Choueifat, a nearby Druse town.
   A statement by the Israeli military command said the air raid,
the seventh in Lebanon this year, was in retaliation for a rocket
attack May 28 that killed an 8-month-old child in Metullah, northern
Israel.
   Six people were killed and 49 wounded in the six previous Israeli
air attacks, according to police reports.
   Wednesday's shelling followed reports that Aoun had rejected
Syrian terms for ending the artillery battle and observing a
cease-fire the Arab League proclaimed in April.
   Syria has 40,000 soldiers in Lebanon under a peacekeeping mandate
issued by the league in 1976, the year after Lebanon's sectarian
civil war began. Aoun describes the Syrian soldiers as an occupation
army and has declared a ``war of liberation'' to drive them out.
   An-Nahar, a respected Beirut newspaper, said Aoun rejected a
Syrian proposal for a ``security committee' of the various Lebanese
factions to oversee implementation of a truce.
   It said Aoun insisted on a ``Lebanese-Syrian security committee''
on grounds the confrontation was between Syrian and Lebanese
soldiers, not among Lebanese factions.
   Syria's proposal was relayed by Lakhdar Ibrahimi, assistant
secretary-general of the Arab League, representing King Fahd of
Saudi Arabia, King Hassan II of Morocco and President Chadli
Bendjedid of Algeria.
   An Arab summit in in Casablanca last month appointed the three
leaders to find a settlement of the Lebanese civil war within six
months.

   Mayor Raymond Flynn will present the 1989
Grassroots Peace Award to a chapter of the national organization
Jobs with Peace, which claims to be the only grass-roots peace
network in the country.
   Jobs with Peace advocates shifting 25 percent of the military
budget to what they call human needs: affordable housing, the
environment, health care and education. The group organizes in
low-income neighborhoods.
   The $10,000 award will be made Thursday to the Pittsburgh chapter
of the group at City Hall.
   Pittsburgh Jobs with Peace mobilized a low-income, predominantly
black area of Pittsburgh to increase their political activism. The
group is credited with defeating Pittsburgh's at-large election
system, which members say served to exclude blacks and other
low-income people from the City Council.
   The group has 15,000 members nationwide. Its advisory board
includes the Rev. Jesse Jackson and Gov. Michael S. Dukakis.
Dukakis' involvement in the group was attacked during the
presidential campaign.

   An argument over whether to take a sick
baby to the doctor set a man off on a shooting spree that left four
people dead and one person critically wounded, authorities said
today.
   The gunman, Ettrie Lavon Gaskins, 48, died at McLeod Regional
Medical Center after shooting himself with a rifle, said hospital
spokesman Eston Clark.
   Gaskins on Tuesday night had argued with his stepdaughter about
taking her child to a doctor, said Sheriff William C. Barnes.
   ``The baby was sick and she wanted to take (the child) to the
doctor and he didn't want her to,'' Barnes said. ``It's a very
tragic situation that all stemmed from a domestic dispute.''
   The argument moved to a trailer across the street, where Gaskins
killed Bobbie Ledbetter, 49, her son Robert, 25, and daughter Wanda,
28, then shot himself, the sheriff said.
   Barnes said Gaskins' 42-year-old wife, Ella Mae, suffered a
seizure after the shootings. She was listed in good condition today
at Bruce Hospital.
   Richard Ledbetter, 19, another son of Mrs. Ledbetter's, was in
critical condition today at McLeod with multiple gunshot wounds,
Clark said.
   Florence is about 75 miles from Columbia.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Helmets are absolutely necessary for children
on bicycles, a consumer safety group said Wednesday, while warning
that seemingly innocuous toys like balloons and water slides can
pose serious dangers.
   ``Kids and balloons just don't go together,'' said Ann Brown,
chairman of the Consumer Affairs Committee of Americans for
Democratic Action.
   Among the top causes of death among children is inhaling pieces
of balloons, which can obstruct the windpipe and choke a child,
explained Brown at an outdoor news conference called to discuss the
safety of summer toys.
   The committee, which has held a similar pre-Christmas event for
several years, decided to add a summer version this year to deal
with the many seasonal toys on sale.
   Children are out of school and more on their own at this time of
year, meaning that parental supervision is less available to prevent
mishaps, Brown commented.
   With bike riding popular, she urged making sure that helmets are
worn to protect all riders from accidental head injury. ``It is the
most important thing,'' she said.
   Backyard gym and swing sets are popular too, and Brown encouraged
parents to make sure these are securely anchored and have no exposed
metal to cut or pinch children.
   Recently popular water slides can pose a hazard to children, she
added.
   These slides are plastic sheets that children wet with a hose and
then slide on. Brown said the slides, sold by many companies, can
lead to injuries from slips and falls and also from the sharp anchor
stakes used to hold them down.
   Other hazards cited included chemical light sticks that can
irritate children's eyes if the chemical spills out and motorized
toy cars that reach speeds of up to five miles per hour, a rate
Brown said is dangerous for occupants aged 3 to 5.
   The committee also found some safe and fun toys that it
recommended. They included:
   _Sand Factory by Fisher-Price, a series of tubes, shapes, shovels
and funnels for sand play, especially at the beach.
   _Waterbarrow by Fisher-Price, a plastic toy wheelbarrow with
water tank and hose for sprinkling flowers ``and oneself.''
   _Weekender by Fisher-Price, a lightweight suitcase for children.
   _Grow With Me Picnic Table by Fisher-Price, a heavy gauge,
durable plastic table with attached benches.
   _Big Teeter-Totter by Little Tikes, a sturdy board that can take
up to 80 pounds yet is lightweight.
   _Scoots by Playskool, a plastic scooter for 3- and 4-year olds.
Training wheels can be attached if needed.
   _Splatter Up by Worlds of Wonder, a water toy that uses pressure
from a hose to shoot a plastic ball into the air on command,
allowing a budding major leaguer to swing away with a plastic bat.

<HEAD>Police Arrest 60 Striking Doctors</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police on Wednesday arrested at least 60
doctors staging a three-day nationwide strike at state-run hospitals
for higher pay.
   Several hundred interns in state hospitals and clinics went on
strike Monday for the second time in seven months, demanding pay
raises and better working conditions.
   Police said they would detain all others who refused to work.
Under Zimbabwean law, people working in essential services are
banned from striking and face jail terms of up to 10 years.
   On Tuesday, Cabinet minister for public services, Chris Andersen,
warned strikers would be prosecuted if they didn't end the walkout
Wednesday.
   Only emergency cases were being treated by senior doctors and
army medical teams in state hospitals, officials said.
   In Zimbabwe's second-largest city of Bulawayo, 54 doctors filed
peacefully into police vehicles at Mpilo Hospital, hospital
officials said.
   The doctors apparently were waiting to be arrested when police
arrived, said Mpilo medical superintendent Naboth Chaibva.
   In the eastern border city of Mutare, four striking doctors were
arrested.
   In Harare, only two were arrested. They presented themselves to
police at Parirenyatwa Hospital, the capital's largest, and said:
``We have come.'' They climbed into a police car and declared, ``We
are now under arrest.''
   Police said other strikers in Harare dispersed after a morning
meeting and were being sought.
   Health Minister Felix Muchemwa said he drafted a new offer for
the doctors, but did not release its details. He said the offer
would be presented to the doctors when they return to work.
   Andrew Cakana, president of the Hospital Doctors Association,
said strikers were being asked to determine whether they should end
their strike.
   But he said the doctors, who earn an average of $300 a month,
were not simply seeking better terms for themselves; they also want
immediate measures to prevent the breakdown of state health services.
   There are no catheters in state hospitals and there is a
widespread shortage of basic drugs, Cakana said. The only coronary
unit at a government hospital was closed because there were no
specially trained nurses, he said.
   At Harare Hospital, there are only three respirators for 60
births a day, and doctors constantly must decide which babies should
live and which should die, Cakana said.
   There also is a shortage of surgical gloves, and four doctors
recently died of AIDS, evidently after being infected by patients
during surgery, Cakana said.

<HEAD>Senate Passes Bill Ending Price Controls on Natural Gas</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate voted 82-17 today to end 35 years of
federal controls on natural gas prices, a move supporters said would
help increase supplies without boosting prices.
   The House passed a nearly identical bill in April.
   President Bush has expressed strong support for natural gas
decontrol, which he calls crucial to giving necessary incentives to
gas drillers and producers.
   The legislation would lift the price controls on Jan. 1, 1993. It
would complete a price decontrol process that began in 1978 with the
Natural Gas Policy Act, which removed price limits on certain kinds
of gas while also establishing two dozen categories of gas, each
with a ceiling price.
   Energy experts have said removal of the remaining price controls
is likely to have little, if any, immediate effect on prices because
most gas still under controls already is selling in the open market
for less than the ceiling price.
   Many analysts predict, however, that natural gas prices will rise
early in the 1990s.
   Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla., said in debate before today's vote
that complete decontrol would benefit both the energy industry and
consumers.
   ``We should allow the market to determine the price of natural
gas, not members of the Senate, not members of Congress,'' he said.
   Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, the chief opponent of the
legislation, said consumers would be hurt because gas producers and
pipelines would be free to raise prices without limit.
   ``The gas producers want to ride that rocket just as far as it
will take them,'' he said before the vote.

   A group calling itself Soldiers of Justice
declared today that will release Belgian hostage Jan Cools following
an appeal from Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi. It gave no date.
   The group said in a typewritten statement the decision also
resulted from negotiations undertaken by Fatah-Revolutionary
Council, the radical Palestinian guerrilla faction headed by
terrorist leader Abu Nidal.
   ``We hope this goodwill gesture by our organization will awaken
the conscience of Western nations to support the causes of the
oppressed, especially the people of Palestine, who are subjected to
daily killings and destruction,'' the statement said.
   The statement was delivered to the Beirut office of a Western
news agency.
   Cools, a doctor working for the Norwegian charity NORWAC, was
kidnapped May 21, 1988, near the Palestinian refugee camp of
Rashidiyeh, where he worked, on the outskirts of Lebanon's southern
port of Tyre.
   There was no way to authenticate the statement.
   Fifteen Western hostages are being held in Lebanon, including
nine Americans.

<HEAD>Not Even Sealing Borders Would Stem Tide of Drugs</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As the Bush administration seeks $1.3 billion
in 1990 to strengthen efforts to keep illegal drugs out of the
United States, some officials say that even sealing the nation's
borders would not end America's drug plague.
   A congressional researcher says more drugs than ever are flooding
the country despite border interdiction programs, but federal
agencies handling such efforts say they will stem the flow _ in time.
   A source on the staff of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on
Investigations says, ``We've had people tell us that if the borders
were sealed, within three days, domestic labs will be producing
synthetic cocaine.''
   Domestic producers already supply U.S. demand for methamphetamine
and PCP as well as 25 percent to 35 percent of the marijuana
consumed in this country, says a spokesman for William J. Bennett,
director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy.
   In fact, spokesman Don Hamilton said, marijuana is being exported
from the United States.
   Bush's proposed drug-fighting budget for fiscal 1990 would
provide $3.9 billion for law enforcement, including $1.3 billion for
drug interdiction efforts, $969 million for drug-use prevention
programs and $661 million for treatment.
   The Bush budget would allot 70.6 percent of those funds to law
enforcement efforts, 17.5 percent to prevention and 11.9 percent to
treatment.
   In 1989, by contrast, $3.35 billion was allocated for law
enforcement, $681 million for prevention and $534 million for
treatment.
   There are widely divergent views on how effective interdiction
efforts have been and Bennett has heard them all as he puts together
a national strategy to curb drug abuse and the violence spawned by
drug trafficking.
   While he believes the United States must keep up the interdiction
pressure, he also accepts that much more must be done on prevention,
education and treatment.
   ``You don't abandon interdiction just because drugs are somehow
getting through,'' said Hamilton. ``You have to do what you can to
make the lives of traffickers more difficult.''
   But he adds that ``we have to realize that our salvation in the
drug war will not be hermetically sealed borders.
   ``There would be a drug problem in the United States even if the
border were sealed. While some people do have a drug of choice, many
people simply want to get high.''
   Arnold P. Jones of the General Accounting Office, a congressional
research office, stressed in testimony last week before the Senate
investigations subcommittee that, despite all attempts at
interdiction, drug supply in the United States is increasing. That
is illustrated, he said, by an increase in the purity of drugs sold
on the street, a decrease in their price and a hike in drug-related
emergency room treatments.
   Coast Guard Lt. Cmdr. James G. Simpson says that even if the
aerial interdiction success rate were just one out of 20 planes,
half what it is now, that would still be ``a great record.''
   To denigrate a success rate of 10 percent or even 5 percent
reflects, he said, ``an incredibly naive understanding of the
problem.''
   For years, Simpson said, the Coast Guard had only two or three
ships looking for illicit drugs making their way across the
Caribbean.
   ``We came up with huge seizures of marijuana. Eventually we put a
lot of equipment down there and seizures dropped.''
   Fewer seizures indicate success, not failure, Simpson said,
because they mean drug traffickers have had to try alternate routes
that may cost them more and give them more trouble, such as using
overland couriers or hiding the drugs in cargo containers.
   Dick Weart of the Customs Service says that while a system of
radar balloons along the southern border is only partially
completed, where they are in place, ``Land-border crossing seizures
are up 500 to 600 percent. More and more, we're getting containers
with 5,000-, 6,000-, 7,000-pound loads.
   But some observers say interdiction won't work, no matter how
dramatic seizures may be, not only because foreign traffickers will
continue to get around barriers but because domestic producers will
fill otherwise unmet demands.
   Ultimately, the only way to win the war against drugs, they say,
is through drug-use prevention, education and treatment programs.
Such efforts won't bear fruit quickly, they say.
   ``Changing the behavior of people is a long-term process,'' said
the GAO's Jones. ``I personally believe that to look for the light
at the end of the tunnel during the course of any administration
does not do justice to the enormity of the problem.''

   A man faces up to life in prison for
raping his stepdaughter 17 years ago _ a crime that went unreported
until last year.
   Rubin McGahee, 47 was convicted Tuesday of forcing the victim,
now 25, to perform oral sex. Sentencing was set for June 30.
   The victim, a third-grader in 1972, was told by a counselor at
the time not to tell, according to testimony. She broke her silence
last year at the urging of a psychiatrist at a hospital where she
was being treated for depression.
   McGahee was arrested in October. There is no statute of
limitation on cases involving sexual abuse of a child.
   ``1972 was the dark ages as far as this goes. You didn't even
talk about incest,'' said Assistant State Attorney Audrey Moran.
   McGahee was charged under 1972 rape laws that prosecutors said
were broad enough to include oral sex.

   Princess Diana showed at a charity film premiere
that she hangs on to her clothes and isn't afraid to wear them again
and again.
   The wife of Prince Charles, the heir to British throne, turned up
Tuesday night for the latest James Bond movie in the stunning
off-one-shoulder white and gold dress she wore to the premiere of
another Bond movie in 1983.
   The figure-hugging sequined gown was first worn by the princess
in public during her tour of Australia with the prince earlier that
year. She donned it again during a visit to the National Gallery in
Washington in November 1985.
   In the new Bond adventure, ``License to Kill,'' the secret agent
is played for the second time by Timothy Dalton.

months in prison for causing serious injuries to three people while
driving drunk.
   Van Nuys Superior Court Judge Richard G. Kolostian on Tuesday
also ordered Swofford, 55, to pay a $390 fine and $9,600 in
restitution to George Charouhas and his two sons for injuries they
suffered during a collision last Dec. 17.
   Charouhas and his son Paul, 11, had multiple fractures, and
Steven, 6, suffered a broken leg.
   Prosecutors said Swofford was seen staggering to his car from a
bar just before the wreck.
   Swofford, who pleaded no contest to felony drunken driving, said
in his probation report he wished he had been killed in the crash.
He said he has been attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings since
his arrest.
   Swofford also has appeared in the television shows ``Switch,''
``The Adventures of Ellery Queen'' and in the miniseries ``Rich Man,

   Pornographic-movie star Harry Reems faces
federal charges of failure to file income tax returns despite
accumulated earnings of more than $80,000.
   A grand jury indicted Reems on Tuesday under his true name,
Herbert Streicher. Reems, 41, was described in a release from the
U.S. attorney's office as a former Malibu resident who now lives in
Utah. A hometown was not given.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Ronni MacLaren said the indictment
charges that Reems failed to file income tax returns for 1982, 1984,
and 1985. During that time, Reems starred in several X-rated videos

   Felony drunken driving charges
against actor David Keith, who played Oliver North in the recent
television miniseries ``Guts and Glory,'' have been reduced to a
misdemeanor count.
   Keith was arrested for investigation of felony drunk driving
after his speeding car hit another car on May 20. The actor's blood
alcohol level was found to be more than .18 percent, almost double
the state's level for drunken driving.
   The charges against the 35-year-old actor were reduced to a
misdemeanor driving under the influence count because the other
driver allegedly made an illegal U-turn and there were no serious
injuries, Elden Fox, a spokesman for the district attorney's office,
said Tuesday.
   Keith's acting credits include ``An Officer and a Gentleman'' and
``Lords of Discipline.''

   About 300 boat people from southern Vietnam
pressed demands Wednesday for transfer to another camp, complaining
of threats and attacks by refugees from the communist heartland of
northern Vietnam.
   Groups of southerners left the Bowring refugee camp starting
Monday and sat and slept outside the San Yick camp, where they asked
to be let in.
   The group swelled to about 300 people on Wednesday and some
carried all their belongings with them, a Corrections Department
spokesman said.
   The southerners said northerners over the weekend had beaten a
southern man who required hospitalization.
   ``They claimed they were threatened there,'' said the spokesman,
who cannot be identified under agency regulations. ``There are
always disputes between northern and southern Vietnamese in the
camp.''
   He said department officials had tried to persuade the
southerners to return to Bowring and apply for transfer through
normal channels.
   The northern Vietnamese sailed from areas of their homeland that
have been under communist rule since 1954. Others came from what
once was South Vietnam, where a U.S.-backed government was toppled
by communist forces in April 1975. The two regions have remained
divided economically since the war.
   Most of the Vietnamese at Bowring are northerners. Southerners
make up the majority at San Yick, a converted factory that the
international community condemned as unfit for human habitation
until Hong Kong improved conditions.
   More than 18,000 Vietnamese have arrived in Hong Kong since Jan.
1, compared to about 10,500 for the same period last year.
Facilities are overwhelmed with a total of about 30,000 Vietnamese,
and hundreds arrive daily.
   Along with conflicts inside the camps, the government of this
tiny British colony has had to contend with the increasing
resentment of the Vietnamese by Hong Kong people, particularly those
who live near the camps.
   On Tuesday, more than 200 residents of the Yuen Long community
protested government plans to open a detention center there to
accommodate new arrivals.
   The marching protesters blocked a road leading to the Sek Kong
military airfield, where the government plans to erect of cluster of
tents on the runway to house the Vietnamese. The airfield is about
12 miles northwest of Hong Kong's city center.
   David Ford, deputy to the governor of Hong Kong, said Tuesday
that officials planned to open the center by the end of the week.
   A year ago, Hong Kong adopted a screening policy to separate
newly arriving Vietnamese into two groups: those fleeing political
persecution and thus eligible for resettlement in the West, and
those fleeing because of poverty or other reasons. These refugees
must be returned to Vietnam, as are illegal immigrants from other
countries, according to Hong Kong officials and residents.
   Vietnam's Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach rejected that position
on Tuesday at an international conference on refugees in Geneva.

   An independent group on Wednesday called
for the removal of the red star, a symbol of communist authority,
from state and public buildings, the official MTI news agency said.
   A Budapest chapter of the Federation of Young Democrats said in a
statement released through the agency it had appealed to parliament
for the elimination of the emblem, as the red star was unfit to
adorn ``our state buildings as a sole symbol.''
   It said the current practice was contrary to the need for a
pluralistic society.
   Hungary's ruling Communist Party and leaders of the opposition,
including the Federation of Young Democrats, began historic
negotiations Tuesday on multiparty elections that could set the
stage for the first coalition leadership since the communists
consolidated power in 1948.
   The federation said it was necessary to remove the emblem of an
``ideology which has lost its monopolistic position,'' and offered
community work from its members to pay for the costs of taking off
the stars.

   House Democrats today elected Richard Gephardt
majority leader and William Gray whip as they sought to recover from
the ethics turmoil that brought down two of their top three
officials.
   Gephardt, who failed last year in a bid for the party's
presidential nomination, defeated Rep. Ed Jenkins of Georgia in a
secret ballot by a vote of 181-76.
   In the whip race, Gray, of Pennsylvania, received 134 votes while
Rep. David Bonior of Michigan got 97 and Rep. Beryl Anthony of
Arkansas got 30.
   Gray's election put him in the highest House leadership post ever
attained by a black member.
   ``I think we've got to get the House back on track,'' Gephardt
told reporters. ``We've got to be able to assert and pass a
substantive agenda,'' he said, specifically mentioning a savings and
loan industry bailout, addressing the nation's budget problems,
clean air legislation, day care and parental leave, and ethics
reform.
   In selecting Gephardt, Democrats turned to a figure with lots of
television experience, a populist message honed on the presidential
campaign trail and _ perhaps most important in Washington's current
ethics climate _ a personal background already well-scoured by the
media and found clean.
   With Tom Foley of Washington as the new House speaker, the top
echelon now represents ``a new generation of Democratic
leadership,'' said Rep. Jim Slattery, D-Kan.
   ``These people obtained their political experience in the 60s and
70s. We have come dangerously close to being perceived as the party
of the status quo. They recognize how important it is for the party
to be projecting a positive image of change,'' Slattery said.
   Foley told reporters that Democrats are ``satisfied that this is
a leadership team that can represent the party and our caucus, but
more importantly, the country.''
   Foley said it had been hard ``to choose between people of great
ability and talent and commitment to the party'' but said he felt
comfortable about the competition because ``we knew we were going to
have great leaders to serve the caucus.''
   Gephardt said he hoped to ``reassert an agenda for progress in
this country.''
   Gephardt, of Missouri, has ``all the qualities of leadership,''
said Rep. Marvin Leath, D-Texas, who had supported Jenkins. ``He's
the best listener in the world, and a natural consensus builder.''
   In a nominating speech for Gephardt, Rep. David Obey, D-Wis.,
alluded to ethics attacks on Democrats by Rep. Newt Gingrich, R-Ga.
``In this era of Newtspeak, we need to confront crass with class,''
Obey said, according to one staff member present.
   Gephardt's relatively easy win came in large measure because of
his ability to listen and seek consensus, demonstrated over 12 years
in Congress, his reputation as a legislative strategist, and his
campaign work last year on behalf of many Democrats.
   Gray, the chairman of the Democratic caucus, was the early
favorite in the whip race but had been hampered by reports the FBI
was investigating whether there was a no-work ``ghost employee'' on
his staff. The Justice Department said this week that Gray himself
is not a target of the probe, and Gray's attorney, Abbe Lowell, said
the congressman met last week with FBI agents and will continue to
cooperate.
   ``I think when all is said and done, they will also end up
confirming that there has been nothing wrong done in my office, past
or present,'' Gray said.
   The 259 members of the caucus, the organization of all House
Democrats, met behind closed doors to fill the jobs by secret ballot.
   Foley moved up from majority leader last week to become speaker
after Jim Wright, D-Texas, stepped down over ethics allegations.
Democratic whip Tony Coelho, D-Calif., is leaving Congress on
Thursday because of questions about his financial dealings.
   The leadership shakeup marks what Obey called ``the moving of a
new generation of political power into this place.'' The new team
will be more telegenic, more pragmatic, more interested in
bipartisan consensus than its predecessors.
   But it may also lack some of the taste for partisan infighting
seen in Wright and, particularly, in Coelho.
   ``I felt I was on the starting team, and was one of the stars,''
Coelho said. ``But you remove one of the starters, and the team
adjusts. Somebody's going to do the political work, because it needs
to be done, and there's recognition for it, and the caucus is going
to demand it.''
   Gephardt offered campaign-honed media savvy to the visible No. 2
job.
   ``It raises the stature of the House,'' Coelho said. ``It in
effect makes House members bigger players on the national scene.''
   Gephardt has told supporters he is putting aside presidential
ambitions and is instead putting himself into the long-term track to
be speaker.
   Jenkins, a popular insider who is a member of the tax-writing
Ways and Means Committee, won sympathy for his call for greater
representation for the party's conservative Southern wing, and there
was talk of creation of a special post for someone from that group.
   ``After we've seen the caucus elections, ... we'll have a chance
to examine whether any appointments might be made that would provide
some additional balance in the leadership,'' said Foley.

<HEAD>Sales Up Sharply; Inventories Rise Modestly</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Business sales rose 1.7 percent in April, their
steepest gain since March 1988 and far outpacing a 0.6 percent jump
in inventories, the government said Wednesday.
   Analysts expect sales to soften but say they see no sign of any
dangerous buildup in stockpiles.
   ``We find very little evidence of any excess stocks and I think
that's good news for the economy because it lessens the risk of
recession as we move forward,'' said economist Lawrence Chimerine of
the WEFA Group in Bala Cynwyd, Pa.
   Rising inventories, if not accompanied by increased sales, could
threaten a recession by prompting manufacturers to cut back
production until excess stocks are sold.
   But the ratio of inventories to sales dropped in April to 1.49,
meaning it would take 1.49 months to exhaust inventories at the
April sales pace.
   Neither Chimerine nor Bruce Steinberg, senior economist for
Merrill Lynch, consider that a troublesome level.
   ``So far in this business cycle, inventory behavior has been
encouraging in that it has not become excessive,'' Steinberg said.
``Whether that continues to be the case remains to be seen but, at
least at this point, there really aren't any serious areas of
excess.''
   The Commerce Department reported that sales rose to a seasonally
adjusted $516.3 billion in April after holding steady in March. The
gain was the steepest since sales rose 1.8 percent in March 1988.
   Inventories on shelves and backlots climbed to a seasonally
adjusted $769.8 billion after a 0.3 percent rise a month earlier,
the department said. That was the highest since a 0.8 percent gain
in January.
   Steinberg said much of the sales gain was price-related and,
added, ``I wouldn't read too much into the sales number.''
   Inflation has been a concern of the Federal Reserve Board, which,
until this month, was forcing interest rates up in an attempt to
slow the economy and restrain price increases.
   Chimerine also said he expects the pace of sales to slow in
coming months. He noted that an advance report on May retail sales,
released by the Commerce Department Tuesday, showed a weak 0.1
percent gain.
   Retail inventories registered the strongest increase in April, up
0.8 percent, the department said, while the retail sales category
showed the weakest gain, up 1.0 percent.
   Manufacturing inventories, which represent 47 percent of the
total, were up 0.6 percent, while wholesale inventories rose 0.1
percent.
   Manufacturers led April sales gains with a 2.4 percent increase,
followed by a 1.3 percent increase by wholesalers.

   Organizers of an event in memory of people who
have died of AIDS defended their plans to release 10,000
helium-filled balloons despite the danger the balloons may pose to
some marine life.
   ``We believe that the pathos evoked by the release of these
balloons ... makes it a very worthwhile event,'' said Karin
Schwartz, an executive board member of the Heritage of Pride,
organizer of the June 25 gay and lesbian pride parade down Fifth
Avenue in Manhattan.
   But in the past few years, scientists have warned of the danger
posed by balloons _ especially metallic Mylar balloons _ to marine
life.
   ``They eventually pop, and they land in the ocean,'' said Louis
E. Garibaldi, director of the New York Aquarium. There, the silvery
coating washes off, leaving a clear plastic bladder that some whales
and turtles mistake for jellyfish.
   ``They eat it and they're not able to digest it,'' he said.
   There have been several reported incidents of marine animals
washing ashore, dead from swallowing Mylar balloons, but ``there is
no real way of knowing what the magnitude of these mortalities is,''
Garibaldi said.
   Schwartz said Tuesday that her organization has been working with
concerned groups for months and made changes in this year's release.
   The organization will use only natural latex balloons.
   According to Garibaldi, the danger from latex balloons is much
lower because they are much smaller when deflated than Mylar
balloons, are colored, not clear, and break down naturally.

<TEXT>
   American harpsichordist Scott Ross has died at his
home in southern France at the age of 38.
   Ross, who died Tuesday, had been suffering from acquired immune
deficiency syndrome, according to his recording company, Erato.
   Known as a rigorous musicologist and an inspired performer, Ross
recorded 555 sonatas by Domenico Scarlatti on 34 compact discs,
which an Erato spokesman said was the world's biggest set of compact
disc recordings.
   Jacques Lonchampt, the music critic of the respected French daily
Le Monde, described Ross as a ``poet ... a winged virtuoso'' who
brought forth ``an endless flow of sound, like a fountain gushing
from all around.''
   Ross was born in Pittsburgh and gave his first piano recital at
age 5. At 12, following the death of his father, he and his mother
moved to France, where he studied the harpsichord and the organ at
the Nice and Paris conservatories.
   In 1971, he won the International Bruges Competition and began a
career as a concert performer.
   He is to be buried Thursday at his home in Assas, near
Montpellier in southern France.

<TEXT>
   Fort Union, a trading post that dominated the
economy of the northern Plains until the Army dismantled it more
than a century ago, is being rebuilt as a tribute to the fur traders
who helped shape the region.
   Crews have been working for four years on the multimillion-dollar
restoration project undertaken by the National Park Service. Most of
the work will be finished later this summer, while North Dakota and
Montana mark their centennials.
   Located near the North Dakota-Montana border _ the modern parking
lot will cross the border _ the fort was a headquarters for fur
traders of the mid-1800s.
   ``Fort Union ... is the place where the story of the Upper
Missouri fur trade is told,'' says Paul L. Hedren, superintendent of
the 430-acre Fort Union National Historic Site.
   Fort Union was built in 1829 near the confluence of the
Yellowstone and Missouri rivers by John Jacob Astor's powerful
American Fur Company.
   Jean Pierre DeSmet, an early missionary, once described it as the
``vastest and finest of the forts the American Fur Company has on
the Missouri.''
   Assiniboin, Cree, Crow, Blackfeet and Sioux Indians peacefully
co-existed with Fort Union's traders for a generation before the
great Indian Wars broke out in the West.
   Guests of the fort during that time read like an early frontier
Who's Who: John James Audubon, the famous American naturalist and
artist; DeSmet, the Roman Catholic missionary who worked among
American Indians; and George Catlin, an artist known for his
paintings of Native Americans.
   The civilian fort was dismantled in the late 1860s by the U.S.
Army after the American Fur Company went out of business. The Army
used some of the doors and windows for its nearby Fort Buford.
   Nothing was left of the trading post and the reconstruction
depends on paintings and early photographs for design and detail.
   ``We want visitors to the fort to capture the spirit of what it
was like to live and trade here in the 1800s,'' Hedren said. ``We've
taken pains to be faithful to its original appearance as much as we
can.''
   The centerpiece of Fort Union is the colorful Bourgeois House.
The house, once the center of social activity, was finished in 1987
and now contains museum exhibits and administrative offices.
   The walls of the fort itself began going up this spring.
   Modern construction techniques will ensure the walls don't
collapse as they were inclined to do during the fort's heyday. The
new walls are underpinned with concrete and steel and the fort's two
bastions, which housed cannons, are being built of concrete blocks
that will be faced with native stone.
   ``We're opting to build a fort that should last a whole lot
longer than its original 38 years,'' Hedren said.
   Work also has begun on an Indian trade house, which sat just
inside the fort's front gate.
   The park service will use the basement of the trade house to
store artifacts discovered at the site. Hedren estimates more than 3
million objects have been uncovered since work began, and crews
still are finding beads and arrowheads.
   Hedren hopes the fort will attract 45,000 visitors this year and
as many as 65,000 annually within a couple of years.
   The price tag for the work done so far is about $4 million,
Hedren said. About $3.3 million has come from federal channels and
nearly $500,000 from supporters called Friends of Fort Union.
   An Aug. 12 dedication is expected to attract a number of
dignitaries, including Lord Astor of Hever, England, a direct
descendant of John Jacob Astor.
   ``Fort Union probably has more bearing on history between the
(west) coast and St. Louis than anything else,'' says Ed Leppien, a
board member of the Friends of Fort Union. ``It's almost a forgotten
item in the history of our country.''

<HEAD>Troubled Air Force Plan Drops Fuel Tank Near Desert Town; None Hurt</HEAD>

   An Air Force plane with engine trouble
dropped an external fuel tank and rocket flares on the outskirts of
town, but no one was injured and there was no damage, authorities
said.
   The pilot of the OV-10 observation craft landed safely after
jettisoning the tank and rockets Tuesday in an open area of desert
near a housing development under construction, said Sgt. Jorge
Caballero, spokesman at nearby George Air Force Base.
   Two explosions rocked the area several hours later, while an Air
Force recovery and investigation team was on the scene. Asked if the
rockets or tank were purposely detonated for safety, a base
spokeswoman, Staff Sgt. Sarah Hood, said she hadn't been told.
   The local office of the San Bernardino County Sheriff's
Department was told only that the Air Force was in charge at the
scene, said Sgt. David Dicus.
   Children at the Village School were briefly called inside from
recess as a precaution, but never were in danger, as the spot where
the pods fell is out of sight of the public elementary school, said
principal Karren Fechner.
   ``They were no sooner inside than it was all over,'' Ms. Fechner
said.
   The OV-10, a twin-engine, propeller-driven forward observer
plane, was on a training flight about six miles from the air base in
the Mojave Desert, 70 miles northeast of Los Angeles, Caballero said.

   Tiananmen Square was unguarded by tanks Wednesday
for the first time in 11 days, but banners supporting the army and
wreaths honoring soldiers who died in the military crackdown
appeared around Beijing.
   Dozens of armored vehicles had been deployed in support of the
military occupation of the square ever since troops of the People's
Liberation Army swept away thousands of pro-democracy students from
the area early June 4.
   A line of more than 36 tanks and armored personnel carriers was
parked Tuesday along the northern edge of the square in front of the
imperial palace. Another dozen tanks were positioned at the southern
end of the square, behind guarded lines of barbed wire.
   Those armored vehicle were gone Wednesday, leaving just 20
canvas-covered armored personnel carriers hidden behind the Qianmen
gate at the southern entrance to the square.
   The removal of tanks was the latest move to reduce the military
presence in and around the square, which is the symbolic center of
power in China. Although Tiananmen remained closed to pedestrians
and guarded by a perimeter of martial law soldiers, traffic now
flows on the four streets that surround the 100-acre square.
   The number of soldiers stationed along Changan Avenue, the main
east-west thoroughfare in Beijing, also appeared to thin Wednesday,
with troops no longer at several positions they had occupied for
more than a week.
   Even the troop transports that continued to rumble through the
city seemed less menacing, with soldiers no longer manning machine
guns placed atop the cabs of the trucks or pointing automatic rifles
at bystanders.
   But the People's Liberation Army made its presence felt in other,
more subtle, ways in Beijing.
   Several banners have appeared downtown that read, ``Respect to
the PLA.''
   At least two locations near major intersections were set aside
for wreaths to honor the soldiers who died in the military attack on
pro-democracy demonstrators.
   The official Xinhua News Agency reported Wednesday that nearly
100 soldiers and police died and thousands were wounded in the
fighting. Western intelligence sources have said up to 3,000 people
died, primarily unarmed students and civilians.
   Dozens of plastic wreaths adorned a pedestrian bridge over a
major road in the Chongwenmen district southeast of Tiananmen.
Several armed soldiers guarded the wreaths, which they said were
sent mainly from Beijing citizens.
   A crowd of dozens of curious onlookers gathered below the bridge
as a Chinese TV crew photographed two elderly woman descending the
steps after placing wreaths.
   ``The soldiers were just following orders,'' said one man in the
crowd.
   Much larger groups of residents earlier had gathered in front of
major universities, where wreaths and mourning banners had been
placed to honor the students killed by the soldiers. Those memorials
were removed by authorities several days ago.

<HEAD>Town Council Drops Bridge Surveillance Plan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Town Council decided against putting
surveillance cameras on the bridges into this posh island community
after the police chief questioned whether they would help fight
crime.
   ``We can't continue to build fortresses and barriers around
ourselves,'' Chief Joseph Terlizzese said before the council voted
Tuesday. ``Next thing you know, we'll be building machine-gun
nests.''
   Terlizzese also told the council he doubted the cameras would
have sufficient resolution to identify drivers.
   Besides, he said, crime in Palm Beach is not that bad. Last year,
the town's crime rate dropped 12.5 percent, he said, adding that a
special motorcycle patrol team would be more effective than cameras.
   ``The cameras on the bridges are the emperor's new clothes,''
said council member Hermine Wiener.
   But Mayor Yvelyne Marix insisted the plan could work.
   ``For a very small amount of money (the cameras) could be of
assistance if the drawbacks could be solved,'' Marix said.
   Palm Beach, where developer Donald Trump and the Kennedy clan
have spacious homes, lies across Lake Worth from West Palm Beach,
which has high-crime areas.
   More than 40 residents turned out in support of the plan when it
was discussed in April.
   But others recalled the negative national publicity the town
received about a law requiring blue-collar workers to carry
identification cards, declared unconstitutional by a federal judge
in 1985.
   ``This type of situation might work against us in our public
image,'' Phillip Radlauer said then. ``We've been taking a terrible
beating as an elitist community.''
   The cameras, which would cost $250,000 to $500,000 to install,
were the suggestion of resident Robert Oreck. He urged the Council
unsuccessfully in March to approve a $3,000 consultant's fee for a
security firm to draw up a proposal for the system.
   Federal investigators last week identified the firm's owner, Mark
Golden, as one of two men who sold weapons to members of a Colombian
drug cartel for the assassination of a rival drug dealer.

   A Titan 4, America's newest, most
powerful rocket, blasted off on its maiden flight today, reportedly
sending into space a $180 million satellite designed to provide
instant alert of a missile attack.
   It was the most expensive unmanned space mission ever by the
United States, with the $220 million rocket, a $45 million satellite
booster stage and other costs raising the total pricetag to close to
half a billion dollars.
   The 20-story-tall booster barreled off its launch pad at 9:18
a.m. and spewed a long tail of fire and smoke from its twin
solid-fuel boosters as it dashed out over the Atlantic Ocean.
   Ten minutes after liftoff, Lt. Col. Ron Rand, the Air Force
launch commentator, reported the rocket had successfully drilled its
secret payload into space.
   ``This is an important milestone for the Air Force because its
the first Titan 4, our new heavy lift launch booster, which will
give us assured access to space for our critical heavy national
security payloads,'' Rand said.
   The Titan 4 will be the workhorse as the Pentagon assembles a
stable of rockets to solve a post-Challenger crisis that has left
about 40 vital reconnaissance and other military payloads
languishing in storage for want of a launch vehicle.
   The Titan 4 can hoist 39,000-pound payloads to an orbit 150 to
300 miles high or propel 10,000-pound packages to stationary orbits
23,000 miles up. It replaces the Titan 34D booster, only one of
which remains to be launched.
   The United States once had a more powerful rocket, the Saturn 5
that launched Apollo astronauts to the moon, but it was discontinued
after the lunar program. It could send a 240,000-pound payload into
orbit.
   The space shuttle, by comparison, can lift 55,000 pounds into
orbit.
   The new Soviet Energia rocket, the world's largest rocket, has
nearly the power of the Saturn 5.
   The Air Force said only that the big rocket was boosting a
classified payload.
   However, it has been widely reported that the rocket carried an
advanced missile warning satellite.
   ``The satellite is the first of a new class that uses an infrared
telescope to detect an all-out nuclear missile attack on the United
States within a minute of launch,'' said John Pike, associate
director of space policy for the Federation of American Scientists.
   This quick alert would give the president and military units 15
minutes to prepare for a submarine missile attack from the Atlantic
or Pacific Oceans or 30 minutes for a land-based strike from within
Soviet borders, he said.
   ``That would give bombers enough time to become airborne, enough
time to mobilize our own nuclear forces and enough time to get the
president into an airborne command post,'' Pike said.
   The new satellite offers about the same warning time as older
ones, but without such errors as mistaking sunlight glinting off
clouds for missile exhaust, Pike said.
   The 2{-ton satellite also will provide intelligence on routine
Soviet and Chinese missile test firings and will be able to detect
the exhaust heat from military aircraft when they fly with their
afterburners on for extra speed.
   Pike said nine of the new satellites will be launched over the
next several years into orbits 22,300 miles high to replace aging,
earlier models.
   The first of the new rockets had waited a long time for its
maiden flight. It was moved to the launch pad more than a year ago,
on May 15, 1988, to be readied for a liftoff last October. But
technical problems caused delay after delay, stretching into months
and adding millions of dollars to the cost.
   Martin Marietta Denver Aerospace is building 23 Titan 4s for the
Air Force for $5.1 billion. The two are negotiating another contract
for an additional 26 rockets.
   Pentagon officials decided after Challenger exploded in 1986 that
they were relying too heavily on the space shuttle for vital
military payloads. They more than doubled the number of Titan 4s on
order and authorized development of two new smaller rockets, the
Delta 2 and Atlas 2.
   The first two Delta 2's launched navigation satellites in
February and on Saturday.

   President Bush, declaring ``enough is enough,''
urged leaders of Congress today to strip special interest amendments
from the savings and loan rescue bill and make the thrifts inject
real capital into the bailout.
   ``I think that every American citizen has every right in the
world to be disturbed and shocked about this situation,'' Bush said
at a Cabinet Room session with House and Senate leaders.
   The House today was taking up the $157 billion rescue plan while
S&amp;L lobbyists scrambled to weaken provisions the administration
demanded in exchange for the bailout.
   The industry, aided by a group composed mostly of Republican
lawmakers, is seeking continuation of ``supervisory good will'' _ an
accounting practice that allows S&amp;L owners to count as capital the
losses of failed institutions they acquired in the early 1980s.
   Thumping his hand on the table, the president declared, ``In my
view, it is time for the American public and our administration to
say that enough is enough and to earnestly ask for the support of
the Congress.''
   He said it was costing taxpayers $10 million more each day that
Congress delays acting on the legislation.
   ``Now, some of the smaller _ or the weaker I would say _ S&amp;Ls are
demanding the right to continue to treat good will as capital, even
though good will has no tangible value,'' he said. He said the
result could be up to $600 billion in loans ``without one dollar in
real capital for decades to come.''
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley told Bush that just 15 amendments
would be considered, down from the 107 that members wanted. Foley
promised the president that by week's end ``there'll be a strong
bill from the House of Representatives.''
   The Senate has already passed a bill to Bush's liking. Senate
Minority Leader Bob Dole of Kansas said he was heartened by Foley's
remarks.
   ``It seems to me it's sort of a timebomb that might go off one of
these days unless we have a very strong piece of legislation,
stripped of all the special interests amendments, and knock out the
good will wherever you can,'' said Dole. ``There isn't much good
will for S&amp;LS, I find, around. Most of the people have been taken
for a ride long enough.''
   Leading the S&amp;L lobbyists' fight is a group composed mostly of
Republican lawmakers who have bolted from the administration on the
issue.
   ``There's a heck of a campaign going on,'' said Rep. Chalmers
Wylie of Ohio, the ranking Republican on the House Banking Committee
and one of only about a dozen of the GOP's 175 House members
supporting Bush on the issue.
   ``The U.S. League (of Savings Institutions, the biggest S&amp;L trade
group) has someone in today from nearly everybody's district working
it,'' Wylie said.
   Good will allows an exemption from federal regulations that
require owners of S&amp;Ls to put $3 of their own money at risk for
every $100 they lend. It was adopted by regulators _ with Congress'
concurrence _ in the early 1980s as a way of postponing for several
years the current S&amp;L crisis.
   More than two-thirds of the nation's 2,938 S&amp;Ls can do without
the exemptions. But, if the exemptions are phased out, about 450 of
the nation's 2,938 thrifts would have to raise more than $6 billion
in new capital by 1995 or be placed under government control.
   William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.,
which insures deposits in commercial banks, said this morning on
NBC's ``Today'' program, that he agreed with an estimate that the
overall bailout could cost about $300 billion over 30 years,
including interest payments.
   Seidman said he also agreed with Bush that S&amp;Ls must be required
to put up some of their own capital. ``I think it would be a
disastrous mistake to pass a bill which doesn't require the owners
to have real money in the business ... That is certainly a key
factor in preventing this from happening again,'' he said.
   The administration and other critics contend ``good will'' and
other ``smoke and mirror'' accounting practices encouraged many S&amp;Ls
to gamble federally insured deposits on ever-riskier loans,
mushrooming their losses tenfold when the loans turned bad.
   In an effort to fulfill Bush's promise that ``never again'' will
taxpayers be asked to pay for such losses, the administration has
been waging a four-month campaign to close the ``good will'' and
similar loopholes.
   Over the objection of most of its Republicans, the House Banking
Committee complied, writing a bill two months ago phasing out by
1995 the use of some $19.7 billion in ``good will'' on S&amp;L books now
counted as capital.

   A 60-nation conference endorsed plans to curb the
mounting flow of refugees from Vietnam, but made no decision
Wednesday on how to deal with those who leave for economic rather
than political reasons.
   Britain and its colony Hong Kong, the destination of most ``boat
people'' go, pressed for an agreement that all who cannot prove they
are threatened with political persecution be returned to Vietnam.
   An increase in the rate of illegal emigration from Vietnam has
pushed the total population of Southeast Asian refugee camps to
nearly 90,000, almost three times the total in 1986. Most new
arrivals flee their homeland because of economic hardship.
   Vietnam and the United States, joined Wednesday by the Soviet
Union, have opposed mandatory repatriation. Foreign Minister Nguyen
Co Thach of Vietnam reiterated at a news conference that his country
will not accept anyone returned against his will.
   Hong Kong's governor, Sir David Wilson, governor of Hong Kong,
told the delegates forced repatriation of all but political refugees
was a ``humane course'' to deal with the action.
   Sir Geoffrey Howe, the British foreign secretary, said the 43,000
boat people now in Hong Kong had caused a ``major humanitarian
crisis'' in the colony, which already is among the most densely
populated places in the world.
   A ``Comprehensive Plan of Action,'' adopted by consensus at the
end of the two-day conference, provides for screening new arrivals
to determine whether they are political refugees. Hong Kong has been
screening since June 1988 and several other nations began in March.
   The plan recommends efforts to encourage the voluntary return of
those who are refused political refugee status. Only 143 have agreed
to repatriation so far, despite formal assurances by Vietnam that
there will be no reprisals.
   If voluntary repatriation does not make ``sufficient progress .
.. in reasonable time, alternatives recognized as being acceptable
under international practice would be examined,'' says the six-page
plan.
   It relies on an ``international media campaign'' to publicize
dangers and disadvantages facing boat people, including attacks by
pirates, and the benefits of legal emigration programs.
   An appeal in the plan for expanded refugee resettlement programs
drew immediate responses from several countries, which pledged to
give new homes in the next three years to at least 53,500 of the
55,000 ``long-staying'' refugees _ those who arrived before
screening began.
   Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger said the United
States would take 22,000 and also anticipated accepting ``up to 50
percent'' of later arrivals classes as political refugees.
   The United States has received 900,000 of the 1.5 million people
who have fled Vietnam since the war ended in April 1975. Eagleburger
said it also has contributed more than $500 million to the support
of refugees and spent billions on resettlement costs.
   In response, Thach said at his news conference: ``We have to look
back at the origin of the refugee problem ... 40 years of warfare
against Vietnam. The U.S. delegation tells us that half a billion
dollars were spent to support the refugees. But more than $300
billion were spent to kill Vietnamese.''
   A statement from the U.S. delegation Wednesday said Vietnam had
agreed to resume talks on letting Vietnamese detained in
re-education camps move to the United States.
   One session was held in Hanoi in July 1988, but Vietnam suspended
negotiations the next month. The U.S. statement said talks would
resume in July, with the date and place to be announced later.
   Thach said Vietnam had released 94,000 inmates of re-education
camps in the past 10 years and 120 still are detained.
   All were interned for having links to the United States or the
former South Vietnamese regime.
   More than 10,000 former inmates have applied to emigrate to the
United States with their families _ a total of 50,000 people, a U.S.
official said on condition of anonymity.

   A judge today refused to declare a mistrial in the
perjury trial of former Rep. Pat Swindall, ruling that a question
asked of a witness by the prosecutor had not tainted the jury.
   Defense attorneys requested the mistrial after prosecutor Craig
Gillen asked defense witness Bobby Lee Cook, a lawyer, about what
motivates defendants to take the stand.
   Swindall lawyer Thomas Thrash immediately objected, charging that
the prosecutor had planted in the jurors' minds the idea that the
former congressman had something to hide if he did not testify.
   U.S. District Judge Richard Freeman stopped the trial, saying,
``After 17 days, I'll salvage this if I can, but I don't know if I
can.''
   After a brief recess, however, Freeman ruled that a mistrial was
not necessary. He instructed the jurors that it was of no concern to
them whether Swindall testified, and he said Swindall has the legal
right not to do so.
   Swindall, a 38-year-old Republican who served two terms in
Congress before being defeated in November, is charged with nine
counts of lying to a federal grand jury about an $850,000 loan deal.
He could receive up to 45 years in prison.
   Defense attorneys have called more than two dozen witnesses in
three days this week, but Swindall was not among them.
   Prosecutors have charged that Swindall lied in 1988 when he
denied being told by a federal agent posing as a money launderer
that some of the loan money might have come from drug trafficking.

   A World War II incendiary bomb that washed up
on shore exploded when a firefighter mistook it for a distress flare
and struck it with a pickax. A sheriff's deputy was seriously
injured.
   St. Lucie County Deputy Cameron Bates remained hospitalized
Wednesday with burns and a shattered knee. The firefighter, Lt. Bob
Wright, suffered burns on his right arm.
   The M-74 bomb, 2 feet long and 2 inches thick, was found by a
beachgoer Monday on Hutchinson Island about two miles south of the
St. Lucie Nuclear Power Plant. Military ordnance often has been
found along Hutchinson Island, which was used as a training area for
the Normandy invasion.
   ``(Wright) wanted me to try and fire a round into it to break it
open to get the phosphorus out so it would burn,'' Bates said.
   Bates said he refused after consulting with his superior.
   The firefighter struck the bomb twice with the pickax before it
exploded, sheriff's bomb technician Harvey Sharpe said. Bates was
walking away when it exploded.
   ``I heard a bang and I got sprayed with stuff all over,'' Bates
said. ``I thought it was sand until I looked down and my uniform was
burning up.''
   Wright said his supervisors instructed him not to comment on the
incident.
   The St. Lucie County-Fort Pierce Fire District launched an
informal investigation Tuesday, saying it appears the firefighter
made a mistake, according to a statement.

   A congressional push for drought relief for

about such aid, Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter said Wednesday.
   ``In my judgment, some of the present drought proposals are, at
best, on the margin of acceptability to the American public,''
Yeutter said.
   The Senate Agriculture Committee, meanwhile, unanimously approved
a rural development program and agreed to take up drought relief on
July 19.
   Senate Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas had argued before the
committee on Tuesday that quick action on drought relief for winter
wheat farmers should come before rural development legislation.
   Large areas of the Great Plains and western Corn Belt have still
not recovered from the devastating 1988 drought. The winter wheat
crop in Kansas, for example, is down by more than a third from last
year.
   Yeutter, in an interview with reporters, said that ``we have not
officially embraced any drought legislation'' and will ``give an
official response when the time comes.''
   Yeutter said he preferred Dole's drought-relief bill over a
broader version in the House, which he described as ``too
open-ended, with far too much taxpayer exposure and vulnerability.''
   Further, he said the House bill is ``far too subject to attack by
the general public'' because of its costs and other features.
Yeutter said the Dole bill ``is far more acceptable in that regard.''
   Dole's drought bill would extend terms of last year's drought
relief to crops planted in 1988 for harvest in 1989, mostly winter
wheat, which is normally Kansas' biggest crop.
   The House bill, which was approved by the agriculture committee
on May 25, is basically an extension of the $3.9 billion 1988
drought relief law. Under it, if farmers qualified, they could get
federal aid for any affected crop or livestock operation.
   Yeutter said there are limits on measures the federal government
can or should take to remove risk from the nation's agriculture.
   ``We are already covering price risk in agriculture in a very
significant way through a variety of programs,'' he said. `` We are
already covering income risks to agriculture in a very significant
way through a variety of programs, including deficiency payments
(subsidies).''
   Yeutter added: ``If we're now also to cover weather risks in a
very significant way, one must wonder just what additional role
government should take up on behalf of American agriculture _ and at
what cost.''
   Already, he said, there are ``multibillion-dollar price tags''
for the price support and income protection under federal crop
programs.
   ``It seems to me at some point in time, as an industry, we're
likely to experience a taxpayer rebellion, and we ought to be
careful to ensure that we can persuasively defend these programs to
the American public,'' Yeutter said.
   The Dole drought bill ``is obviously more attractive'' than the
House bill because it is limited mostly to winter wheat, he said.
``That, at least, limits the (cost) exposure to the American
taxpayer and confines it to a segment of our economy that has really
been damaged.''

<HEAD>Travel Agency Fined for Booking Tours to Vietnam</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A travel agency was fined $50,000 in
federal court Wednesday for illegally booking tours to Vietnam.
   U.S. District Judge T.F. Gilroy Daly also ordered Linblad Travel
Inc. to forfeit $25,000 it collected for the tours and ordered it to
make restitution of $4,410 to the government for the cost of a
ticket bought by an undercover Customs agent.
   The Westport company had faced a maximum penalty of $500,000 for
one count of violating a federal regulation. The regulation
prohibits tour operators and travel agents from arranging, promoting
or facilitating group or individual tours to countries designated by
the Trading with the Enemy Act.
   Under the regulation, an individual can approach a U.S. travel
agent for information about flights to Vietnam, Kampuchea or North
Korea. But a travel agent can't solicit the business and can't
arrange the flight.
   Lars-Eric Lindblad, president and chief executive officer of the
company, said he advertised the tours in a travel club mailing last
year as an act of civil disobedience to test the federal regulation.
Lindblad called the regulation ``indecent and certainly unjust.''
   Lindblad and his employees also had faced individual fines and
possible prison terms before a plea bargain was reached.
   U.S. Attorney Stanley A. Twardy Jr. said the agreement was
reached because federal prosecutors didn't believe they could win
prison terms for those charged.
   ``I thought this was a very fair disposition of the matter,'' he
said.
   Lindblad had planned to challenge the regulation all the way to
the U.S. Supreme Court, if necessary. But he said the costs became
too much.

   A planned tribute to activist Abbie Hoffman on
Saturday also will help establish a fund for causes supported by the
late Yippie founder, sponsors say.
   ``A man who led such an extraordinary life will be commemorated
by just a few of the thousands who knew, admired and loved him,''
said Abby Hirsch, one of the organizers.
   Among those expected at the memorial at a Manhattan nightclub are
author Norman Mailer, poet Allen Ginsberg, singer Buster Poindexter
and musician Wavy Gravy, and activists Daniel Ellsberg, Paul
Krassner, Amy Carter and surviving members of the Chicago Seven.
Hoffman's three children also are expected.
   Kris Kristofferson has written a song to be performed at the
event, said Ms. Hirsch. It also will feature a video, directed by
John Avildsen (``Rocky,'' ``The Karate Kid'') tracing Hoffman's
career.
   The event will be titled ``No Regrets: A Tribute to Abbie
Hoffman.'' In Hoffman's final public speech, to students at
Vanderbilt University, he detailed his activism over the past 30
years and ended, ``I regret nothing.''
   Hoffman committed suicide April 12 at his New Hope, Pa., home
with an overdose of phenobarbital. He was 52.
   Memorials already have been held in Pennsylvania, Massachusetts
and California for the man who led anti-war protests at the 1968
Democratic convention in Chicago and tossed dollar bills onto the
floor of the New York Stock Exchange.
   The memorial Saturday will be the start of the Abbie Hoffman
Activist Foundation, which its founders say will fund ``David vs.
Goliath-type projects _ the little person against big institutions.''
   Tickets are free, but sponsors are asking for contributions to
the foundation.

   A hotel has offered to pay for moving
Adolf Hitler's yacht from the sensitive coral reef where it was
mistakenly sunk earlier this month, officials announced Wednesday.
   The yacht, the Ostwind, was supposed to become an artificial reef
in 250 feet of water. It was sunk June 4 as part of a commemoration
of the ``Voyage of the Damned,'' in which the Coast Guard in 1939
turned away a ship carrying more than 900 Jews fleeing Nazi
persecution.
   But instead, the 85-foot Ostwind wound up in 25 feet of water
about a mile away from the intended site, creating a hazard in a
shipping lane and threatening a live coral reef.
   City Commissioner Abe Resnick, who helped organize the Ostwind's
sinking, announced the owner and manager of the Fontainebleau Hilton
Hotel had offered to pay an estimated $10,000 to move the Ostwind.
   ``We certainly do not want this yacht to be part of an
environmental problem, especially because Hitler was the first great
threat to the world's environment in the 20th century,'' said
Resnick, a survivor of the Holocaust.
   The Army Corps of Engineers had threatened to move the yacht and
bill Resnick for the costs.
   Resnick said the Ostwind will be moved to the site originally
intended, not far from where the Coast Guard turned away the S.S.
St. Louis. The ship was forced to return to Europe, where more than
two-thirds of the passengers died in the Holocaust.
   The Ostwind was commissioned by Hitler and used by Nazi
officials, although Hitler apparently only used the vessel once or
twice. It eventually fell into disrepair after World War II and was
bought by a Jacksonville marina owner.

   Chinese seeking to join spouses in the
United States besieged the U.S. Consulate on Wednesday for visas,
and many were turned away because of a limited number of
applications.
   The United States reopened its visa offices at its consulate in
Shanghai and its embassy in Beijing after closing them following the
military crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators June 3-4.
   About 200 people clamored to be let into the consulate on
Wednesday after officials handed out the 100 student visa
applications for the day. Many held up passports and letters from
husbands and wives as Chinese staff members repeatedly told them
their applications would not be accepted for the time being.
   A reporter outside the consulate was surrounded by dozens of
Chinese who asked him to carry messages inside.
   ``My husband has been gone for more than a year. My life is not
normal. I want to see him,'' said a statistics administrator whose
husband is studying at the University of Hawaii.
   ``I really want to have children but how can I if I can't even
see him?'' she asked. ``It's so cruel. We don't even have the right
to have a family.''
   Several people said they had heard on the U.S. government-funded
radio, Voice of America, that the consulate would accept
applications.
   Consul Dan Keller said his office will begin taking applications
from Chinese whose spouses are in the United States in two or three
days, but that more than half probably would be rejected.
   ``We get students who are barely getting by with the help of
their sponsors,'' he said. ``If we get a spouse who says he or she
just wants to go over there and sit around, we're not inclined to
give it a high priority. We'll give them (visas) to people in
established programs who are financed.''
   The U.S. government does not allow foreign students or their
spouses to work, but suspects that most spouses try to find jobs
illegally to earn money and that many couples plan to remain in the
United States permanently.
   More than 1,000 people have been arrested nationwide since the
military crackdown. The arrests have created a climate of fear and
many Chinese want to leave the country.
   While the consulate's office was closed last week, staff members
helped evacuate Americans amid massive pro-democracy demonstrations
in the city of 12 million.
   ``We're still clearing up inquiries regarding welfare and
whereabouts of U.S. citizens,'' Keller said.
   Despite the extra work, one consulate official said diplomats
were making extra efforts to extend help to Chinese.
   ``You can taste the sympathy in the air,'' said the diplomat, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The scene was calmer at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, where a
stampede had been expected but only about 200 people showed up,
apparently because plainclothes police were watching.
   ``I just came here to look. I don't even have a passport yet,''
said one woman who said she has been accepted for a master's degree
at the University of Wisconsin. ``There are a lot of police here.''
   About a dozen Western reporters conducted interviews. On several
occasions after the interviews ended, men who looked like police
approached the Chinese.
   ``What did you talk about?'' one man asked a woman.

<TEXT>
   Voters in five European Economic
Community nations will pick candidates Thursday for the 518-member
European Parliament, which enjoys a growing voice in EEC affairs.
   Voters in the other seven EEC countries go to the polls Sunday.
   Elections will be held Thursday in Britain, Denmark, Ireland, the
Netherlands and Spain. But ballots will be counted only after voters
choose among candidates in West Germany, Luxembourg, France, Italy,
Portugal, Belgium and Greece.
   In all, 7,126 candidates are vying for seats in the 518-member
assembly. They represent 178 parties across the political spectrum.
   Pre-election polls say Socialists and Christian Democrats, who
hold 166 and 112 seats respectively in the outgoing assembly, will
remain the largest factions, and might even make gains.
   Green Party candidates are expected to do well in West Germany,
the Netherlands, France, Belgium, Spain and Portugal and win
substantially more than the 20 seats they held previously.
   In Ireland, Luxembourg and Greece, voting for the European
Parliament coincides with national legislative elections.
   But even in countries where no general election is planned soon,
campaigning for the European elections has focused largely on
domestic issues.
   In Britain, the opposition Labor party has turned the elections
into a referendum on Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's 10 years in
office, rather than on its views of European integration.
   In Italy, campaigns also took on a domestic tinge and vote
results will affect the makeup of the next coalition government.
Italy's 48th postwar government collapsed last month.
   And in Spain, which joined the EEC in 1986, the campaign is
widely seen as a warm-up for general elections that must be held by
1991.
   Issues such as the EEC single market project, under which
Europe's internal borders will disappear by Dec. 31, 1992, have
barely been explained to voters who seem confused about what the
parliament is and what it does.
   The assembly is one of three institutions directly involved in
the EEC's lawmaking process.
   But unlike the EEC Commission and the Council of Ministers, both
of which are based in Brussels, the parliament straddles three
nations: its committees meet in Brussels, its headoffice is in
Luxembourg and its plenary sessions are held monthly in Strasbourg,
France.
   While the parliament lacks a high profile, it gained additional
powers on July 1, 1987, forcing the EEC Commission and the Council
of Ministers to pay more attention to the parliament's views.
   The parliament must now be consulted on any single market issues
involving the environment, research and technology, occupational
health and safety and certain measures to harmonize laws among
nations.
   It must also approve some EEC treaties with other countries and
applications for EEC membership. It can amend or reject the EEC's
annual budget, fire the 17-member EEC executive Commission or delay
an opinion on draft EEC legislation to keep it from taking effect.
   The parliament also plays a growing role in international
affairs. Former President Ronald Reagan, Argentine President Raul
Alfonsin, King Hussein of Jordan, PLO leader Yasser Arafat and Pope
John Paul II have addressed the body in recent years.
   The parliament cannot, however, initiate EEC legislation.
   The outgoing parliament comprises eight political ``groups,''
representing 79 political parties sitting in alignments of the
right, center and left.

<HEAD>German Scholar Defends `Ulysses' Edition</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TED DUNCOMBE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A West German scholar whose critical text of
James Joyce's ``Ulysses'' claims to correct 5,000 ommissions,
transpositions and other errors defended his book against charges it
is riddled with errors.
   And Hans Walter Gabler predicted his book will withstand the
attacks and remain the standard text for years to come.
   Gabler said he is eager to answer criticism by primary detractor
John Kidd, director of Boston University's James Joyce Research
Center, who claims it has so many errors it should be pulled.
   ``I've been waiting for four years, but I'm still waiting,''
Gabler said after a lecture this week during the 1989 James Joyce
Conference, a gathering of about 400 scholars and enthusiasts of the
Irish novelist continuing through Friday.
   The wait is nearly over for Gabler and scholars who helped him in
the 1984 edition which they said corrected errors in earlier
editions dating to the 1922 original, which Joyce himself knew was
full of errors. The book initially was banned in Great Britain and
the United States as obscene.
   The New York-based Bibliographical Society of America is about to
publish what Kidd describes as a listing of more errors ``than have
ever before been documented in one scholar's work.'' He has
previously discussed only some of his objections to the Gabler book.
   The essay will appear in a quarterly journal, ``Proceedings of
the Bibliographical Society of America,'' due out in late June.
   Kidd ``has made all sorts of statements that he has not
substantiated,'' said Gabler, a professor at the University of
Munich. ``I ought to be able to clear these allegations out of the
way. After all, I've put my cards on the table. He hasn't.''
   Also waiting is a committee of four experts headed by G. Thomas
Tanselle, vice president of the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial
Foundation in New York. It was assembled at the request of Jason
Epstein, editorial director of Random House, publisher of Gabler's
book, the only version of ``Ulysses'' sold in the United States.
   ``That essay is to be, as it were, the brief for the
prosecution,'' said committee member Denis Donoghue, Henry James
professor of letters at New York University. ``And on the basis of
Gabler's reply to that, we are to make recommendations as to what,
if anything, is to be done'' with Gabler's book.
   Some scholars believe Kidd, who skipped the Philadelphia
conference after sharing a podium with Gabler in Miami in February,
has overstated whatever errors the text contains.
   ``I think what he (Gabler) has so far been accused of getting
wrong relates to a very small number of decisions out of what are
millions of decisions in what is one of the most complex pieces of
fictional development that exists in this century,'' said Arnold
Goldman, a professor at the University of Kent in Canterbury,
England.
   Gabler demonstrated how he and his team edited ``Ulysses.''
   About 50 people compared photocopies of Joyce's birdlike scrawl,
a typewritten version and Gabler's text.
   Pointing to the handwritten copy _ from a partial manuscript of
``Ulysses'' in Philadelphia's Rosenbach Museum and Library _ Gabler
noted Joyce already had revised sections.
   After originally writing ``Mawkish pulp her mouth had mumbled
sweetsour spittle,'' Joyce inserted two words to say ``sweetsour of
her spittle.''
   In the typewritten text, not typed by Joyce, the sentence ended,
``sweet and sour with spittle.''
   Such changes could have been a typist's errors or could have been
Joycean revisions, indicating an intermediary manuscript had
existed, Gabler said.
   Gabler's edition opts for ``sweetsour of her spittle,'' but
includes ``sweet and sour with spittle'' in brackets.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev visited this
prosperous industrial city Wednesday for a look at the robots and
other technological wonders needed to modernize the Soviet economy.
   Thousands of people cheered the Soviet president and his wife,
Raisa, when they arrived at the former royal castle to meet with
businessmen and Gov. Lothar Spaeth of prosperous Baden-Wuerttemberg
state.
   About 5,000 people gathered in the vast castle square despite
high temperatures and humidity, a crush of security agents, and the
bustle of horse-drawn carriages and palace guards in medieval garb.
   Several older well-wishers were overcome by the heat and taken
away by emergency medical crews.
   Security has been extremely tight during the four-day Gorbachev
visit, which ends Thursday. Helicopters hover above his motorcade
and the routes are cleared of traffic to allow unhindered passage.
   West Germans have provided an enthusiastic welcome in spite of
it, however, and Gorbachev has expressed his appreciation often.
   ``This has really pleased all the Soviet people,'' he told
Spaeth, and said he had spoken with Kremlin officials by telephone
on the flight from Bonn.
   Not since President John F. Kennedy's visit in 1961 have West
Germans given a foreign statesman such a jubilant welcome.
   Spaeth, a popular Christian Democrat, accompanied the visitors to
Stuttgart University for a tour of its technology exhibit.
   Gorbachev showed great interest in an electronically programmed
knitting machine, which produced a six-foot banner from a card
bearing his and Spaeth's signatures on the Soviet flag and
Baden-Wuerttemberg crest.
   ``I thank you for this. It was a good lesson for us on the
cooperation of science and production,' Gorbachev said in brief
remarks after the tour.
   He mingled with industrialists, chatting about the prospects for
broadening economic cooperation.
   When the head of the Daimler-Benz aviation and automotive works
introduced himself, Gorbachev smiled and declared: ``Yes, we've
heard about you.''
   Edzard Reuter replied that his corporation was interested in
joint ventures to produce aircraft and motor vehicles.
   In talks with businessmen at the castle, Gorbachev said the
reception he received from West Germans ``is evidence of the great
changes in our relations.''
   He was told that about 20 new co-production projects were nearly
ready for signing.
   Otto Lambsdorff, a former economics minister, said the two
countries ``could not be satisfied'' with the state of their
business relations and Gorbachev must introduce price reforms and
other unpopular measures to boost competitiveness.
   ``These are hard steps, but the Soviet economy must go through
this valley of tears if it wants to see light at the end of the
tunnel,'' he said in a radio interview.
   Lambsdorff leads the Free Democratic Party, the junior partner in
the government coalition wih Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian
Democrats.
   While Gorbachev discussed the application of new technology to
Soviet industry, his wife visited a working-class family to talk
about daily life in West Germany. She spoke privately with Iona and
Josef Goetz, then posed for pictures with them.
   The Gorbachevs' visit to Stuttgart ran nearly two hours longer
than scheduled, delaying a private dinner with Kohl in Bonn.

   An award given annually for two decades
to a teacher who promotes racial harmony in this ethnically diverse
community wasn't given this year.
   Letters to 900 teachers seeking nominations drew only one
response, not enough to satisfy the local B'nai B'rith chapter that
sponsors the award.
   ``We didn't feel that rubber-stamp approval was enough,'' said
Stephen Glassman, the chapter president. ``There was not a choice to
be made this year.''
   Glassman said local educators once nominated about eight
candidates a year for the Philip A. Bronspiegel Award, established
in 1972 in memory of his efforts during a 30-year teaching career to
encourage tolerance among children.
   But in recent years, Glassman said, nominations had dwindled.
Last year B'nai B'rith received two nominations.
   ``The award will be kept alive, though,'' he said.
   Superintendent Constantine T. Nanopoulos said the award had long
been a source of pride for educators.
   Barbara Aguiar, president of the New Bedford Teacher's
Association, said she had nothing to say about what the award
symbolizes for the teaching community or about the lack of response
this year.
   Isadore Eisner, a past president of the local B'nai B'rith
chapter, said the group was very disturbed by the apparent lack of
teacher interest and was prepared to fight to keep Bronspiegel's
memory alive.
   ``We've got to make sure this doesn't happen again,'' Eisner
said. ``Mr. Bronspiegel stood for brotherhood, for understanding,
for every man being equal to the other.''
   About 70 percent of New Bedford's 100,000 residents are members
of ethnic or minority groups.
   Mario Teixeira, who ed that the community was given a Presidential
award for educational excellence in 1983.
   ``Visitors who came down here (to give the award) were very
impressed with the pride students took in their background and how
we recognized and supported that pride,'' he said.

   Queen Elizabeth II made Ronald Reagan a knight
Wednesday, but without the kneeling and dubbing because the
knighthood is an honorary one given foreigners, who cannot be called
``Sir.''
   The Buckingham Palace announcement ended days of speculation
about whether the former president, whose easy manner and
conservative ardor made him a firm friend of Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher, would receive the highest honor for non-Britons. Honors to
foreigners are recommended by the government.
   Reagan told reporters outside the palace: ``I feel greatly
honored.''
   He emerged from lunch with the queen with a box containing the
insignia of an honorary Knight Grand Cross of the Most Honorable
Order of the Bath, one of the highest orders of chivalry.
   Elizabeth accompanied the Reagans to their car to say goodbye,
and jokingly warned Reagan: ``Don't drop them.''
   With his wife, Nancy, beaming beside him, he responded: ``I can't
say how proud I am to receive it.''
   ``Sir'' is a title reserved for Britons, but at dinner parties
Reagan can sit closer to the queen than unknighted former
presidents. He also can use the initials ``G.C.B.'' after his name.
   In a statement, Reagan said the award was ``not a personal
achievement as much it is as a splendid recognition'' of
Anglo-American friendship.
   ``Ours is a bond which grows every day and one which is a
tremendous source of pride for me,'' he said.
   Reagan said he believed the special Anglo-British relationship
``is the compass by which the rest of the world charts its course.''
   The Reagans arrived Sunday for a private visit and dined with
Mrs. Thatcher Tuesday night. They fly to Paris on Thursday.
   ``The queen has been pleased to approve a recommendation ... that
the honorable Ronald Reagan be appointed an honorary Knight Grand
Cross of the Most Honorable Order of the Bath,'' the palace
announcement said.
   Queen Elizabeth made the presentation after lunch in her private
dining room, where she rarely entertains foreigners. The Reagans
were the only guests of the monarch and her husband, Prince Philip.
   Unlike Britons receiving knighthoods, Reagan did not have to
kneel and be tapped on the shoulder by the royal sword. Instead, the
queen handed him the order's insignia: a star, badge and broad
ribbon of crimson silk.
   Reagan was the 58th American given an honorary knighthood, and
the first since World War II to receive the Order of the Bath, which
has its origins in knights appointed at the coronations of Saxon
kings.
   The name comes from the symbolic bath taken by medieval
candidates for knighthood. Admission to the order recognizes
``conspicuous service'' to Britain.
   Honorary GCBs include former President Dwight D. Eisenhower, the
Allied supreme commander in World War II; Gen. George C. Marshall,
author of the Marshall Plan; Gen. Douglas MacArthur, and Adm.
Chester Nimitz.
   Caspar Weinberger, defense secretary in the Reagan
administration, got the title in February 1988, but in the lower
Order of the British Empire.
   Other American honorary knights include philanthropist John Paul
Getty II, Henry Ford III, former Secretary of State Dean Rusk and
actors Douglas Fairbanks Jr. and Sidney Poitier.
   During an interview on Independent Television News, Reagan
praised Mrs. Thatcher, his staunchest ally during eight years in
office.
   ``She is magnificent,'' he said. ``Believe me, seeing her there
among all heads of state I can tell you they feel the same way. She
has great respect throughout the world.''
   In an address Tuesday to the English Speaking Union, Reagan spoke
of a world in which communist countries were accepting the supremacy
of capitalism and democracy, and he developed the theme in the
interview.
   ``We are seeing some of the leading communist nations indicate
that their system, at the least, has some great flaws,'' he said.
   He recalled visiting China and finding the government had let
people open shops.
   ``In other words, what they were saying to them was `Use
capitalism, go into private business for yourselves,''' Reagan said.

<HEAD>33 House Members Want Cut in Star Wars Spending</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thirty-three House members are urging a cut in
Star Wars spending to $3.1 billion from the $4.9 billion proposed by
President Bush, and they want the money spent on conventional arms.
   ``This year's declining defense budget is strangling us, and the
future looks worse,'' said one sponsor of the proposal, Rep. Charles
Bennett, D-Fla., a member of the House Armed Services Committee.
   Bennett initiated the proposal, along with Rep. Tom Ridge, R-Pa.
   Last year, the House passed a proposal by the same two
legislators for a $3.5 billion cap on spending for the Strategic
Defense Initiative, or SDI, as Star Wars is formally known. The
Senate and House later agreed on a spending level of $4.1 billion.
   ``Many experts have told us that $3 billion is plenty for
vigorous SDI research,'' Bennett said in a statement.
   The research program is intended to allow policy-makers to decide
by the mid-1990's whether to deploy space-based anti-missile
defenses. The Soviet Union says some proposed research would violate
the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, which bans space-based
anti-missiles defenses.
   Other Republicans joining the initiative were Reps. Christopher
Shays of Connecticut, Fred Gandy of Iowa, and Bill Green and Frank
Horton, both of New York.

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Last-minute preparations were made Wednesday for
the grand opening of a new and enlarged Underground Atlanta, an
effort to erase downtown Atlanta's reputation of being devoid of fun.
   ``There's some painting, cleanup, they're vacuuming and
dusting,'' said John L'Abate, a public relations staffer for the
project. ``Some merchants are still bringing stuff in, the
restaurants are finishing their training (and) making sure the
refrigerators are stocked.''
   The $142 million retail and entertainment complex officially
opens at noon Thursday. Ceremonies, which will continue through the
weekend, follow a three-year overhaul of the underground by The
Rouse Company.
   Officials expected several thousand people to attend the opening
and hoped that larger crowds will come out on the weekend.
   The original Underground Atlanta, located completely beneath
downtown street viaducts, opened in 1969. Under the perception that
it was riddled with crime, it closed in 1982.
   The new version is on and around the original site, on downtown's
south side, just a few blocks from the city's high-rise hotel
district. It's three times bigger than the old Underground and will
include 22 restaurants and nightclubs, as well as nearly 100
retailers.
   Backers hope that, in addition to changing downtown Atlanta's
image, the underground attraction will entertain residents and
visitors, while downtown businesses hope people visiting Underground
will spend some money in their stores.

<HEAD>Outcry Over Report Militia May Get Plastic Bullets</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The army disclosed Wednesday the
Ulster Defense Regiment, a mostly Protestant militia in Northern
Ireland, may be armed with guns that fire plastic bullets.
   The report provoked outcry from Roman Catholic leaders, who said
the regiment is seen as a sectarian force and want it disbanded.
   An army spokesman, reacting to a newspaper report, said:
``Operational use of plastic bullet gun, on a strictly limited
basis, to the UDR is an option which has been under consideration
for some time.''
   Only 3 percent of the force's 6,300 full-time and part-time
soldiers are Catholic. The army says that when the force was founded
in 1970 it was 18 percent Catholic, but that intimidation by the
Irish Republican Army drove out many Catholics.
   The predominantly Catholic IRA targets Catholic recruits as
traitors in its war to rid Northern Ireland of British rule.
   Brian Feeney of Social Democratic and Labor Party, Northern
Ireland's main Catholic party, said arming the Ulster Defense
Regiment with plastic bullets would be ``stupid and provocative.''
   He said the Ulster Defense Regiment was perceived by Catholics as
``a sectarian force,'' and giving them plastic bullets ``will simply
increase the hostility.''
   The army spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said:
``Experience has shown that plastic bullet rounds can be an
effective but relatively safe means of responding when lives are
threatened.''
   Plastic bullets are a crowd-control weapon to stun and injure,
but they can kill when fired from close range. They are used in
Northern Ireland by the army and the Royal Ulster Constabulary, the
province's 85 percent Protestant police force.
   About 15 people, all but one of them Catholic, have been killed
and 400 injured by plastic bullets since the outbreak of Northern
Ireland's present round of troubles in 1969.

   Three children from a poor neighborhood of
Trenton, N.J., met with Pope John Paul II on Wednesday as a reward
for their good grades and leadership qualities.
   ``He told me, `Drink in as much as you can with your eyes,'''
said Lakeisha Gayles after the meeting, which took place following
the pope's weekly general audience.
   Lakeisha, 12, is from Sacred Heart School in Trenton, as are her
companions on the trip to Rome, Elvin Montero, 14, and Sarah
DeGregory, 13 and Lakeisha Gayles, 12.
   The meeting was arranged with the help of Helen Boehm, a Trenton
resident and a benefactor of the school.
   She presented the pope with a porcelain bust of the Madonna and
Child, while the children brought rosaries and other gifts from the
classmates for the pope to bless.
   ``These children have gone beyond the disadvantages of living in
a high drug rate area,'' said Mrs. Boehm.
   ``So many people would love to have had this experience ... and
we had it!'' said Lakeisha.

<TEXT>
   French President Francois Mitterrand
arrived Wednesday for a three-day visit expected to focus on
increasing economic cooperation between this hard-pressed communist
country and Western Europe.
   Mitterrand was greeted at Warsaw Military Airport by Polish
leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, Prime Minister Mieczyslaw F.
Rakowski and other government officials and the diplomatic corps.
   After reviewing a military honor guard in a brief welcoming
ceremony broadcast live on state TV, Mitterrand and Jaruzelski
departed for private talks.
   Mitterrand met Cardinal Jozef Glemp, the leader of Poland's
powerful Roman Catholic Church, at the French ambassador's
residence. No details of their talk were released.
   The French president is to be the guest of honor at a state
dinner Thursday night and plans visits to Gdansk, Krakow and the
former concentration camp at Auschwitz in southern Poland before his
departure Friday.
   Besides meeting Jaruzelski and Glemp, Mitterrand plans talks with
Solidarity leader Lech Walesa. He also will meet students at
Jagiellonian University in Krakow.
   The visit is the first by a French head of state since the
December 1981 imposition of martial law to crush the independent
Solidarity movement. It is one of a series of meetings between
Jaruzelski and Western leaders marking the emergence of Poland from
the diplomatic isolation that followed the martial law period.
   Authorities resumed talks with the Solidarity-led opposition this
year, restored Solidarity's legal status and held the country's most
democratic elections since World War II.
   Last weekend, Jaruzelski met in Britain with Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher and is to meet with President Bush in Poland for
two days next month.
   Political liberalizations in Poland have been accompanied by
pleas to the West for economic assistance as the country struggles
with a $39 billion foreign debt, inflation approaching 100 percent
this year, frequent consumer shortages and deteriorating industry.
   Mitterrand, who visited Czechoslovakia in December as part of a
stepped-up French diplomatic effort in the Soviet bloc, was expected
to sign an agreement rescheduling part of Poland's debt to France
and discuss other ways to encourage political reform through
economic aid.

<DATELINE>PALO ALTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some cities bar skateboarders, but Palo
Alto just passed a law authorizing skateboards on most of its
streets.
   About 20 cities in California have ordinances barring
skateboarders from shopping malls, parking lots and streets. Palo
Alto touts its new law as the first such pro-skateboard legislation
in the state.
   City Council voted 6-2 on Monday to allow skateboards on all but
25 of the city's busiest streets.
   ``I see it as potentially model legislation,'' said Tom Terrell,
a skateboard advocate who last fall prompted the city to re-examine
its skateboard rules.
   Terrell submitted 300 signatures seeking to have skateboarders
treated the same as bicyclists.
   ``Palo Alto is setting a pro-skateboard example at a time when
some towns are banning them outright,'' said Terrell.
   Under the law, skateboarders may use residential streets and some
major thoroughfares if they obey basic rules of the road that apply
to bicyclists. Skateboarders who travel at night will be required to
wear a reflective device. But, unlike bicyclists, they will not have
to have lights or brakes.
   Final passage of the ordinance is expected this summer.

   Here are the state rankings in the 10th annual
Manufacturing Climates Study released Wednesday by the accounting
firm Grant Thornton.
   The states are divided into two categories, high manufacturing
and low manufacturing.
   High-manufacturing states contributed more than 2 percent of the
value of manufacturing shipments in the United States over the last
four years and have 16.43 percent or more of their work forces in
manufacturing.
   The state rankings were based on 21 factors that were narrowed to
five categories: state and local fiscal policies; unemployment
benefits and workers' compensation levels; labor costs; energy costs
and work hours lost because of strikes; and quality of life.
   The states are listed from best to worst:

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh was not
informed but should have been before FBI agents tried to interview
Rep. William H. Gray III in connection with an investigation, a
spokesman said Wednesday.
   Two Philadelphia-based FBI agents traveled to Washington on
Memorial Day to interview the Pennsylvania Democrat, who was elected
House Democratic whip on Wednesday.
   The Justice Department has been reported to be investigating
allegations of a no-show employee on Gray's payroll. The department,
in an unusual statement reacting to leaks about the investigation,
said Monday night that Gray was not a target of the probe and was
cooperating.
   Thornburgh's press secretary, David Runkel, said Wednesday the
attorney general has a policy requiring that he be notified before
federal law enforcement agents contact members of Congress or other
high government officials about an investigation.
   Without going into the Gray matter, chief FBI spokesman Milton
Ahlerich said the FBI does not ``go out and contact nationally
elected officials on an investigative matter without the highest or
very high-level approvals within the headquarters of the FBI.''
   Such a policy is never violated, Ahlerich said.
   ``Normally there is close coordination'' between the FBI and the
Justice Department's criminal division, Ahlerich said.
   While there is no FBI procedure requiring notification of the
attorney general in such cases, ``that is the practice and that is
the wish of the attorney general and that is certainly
appropriate,'' the FBI spokesman said.
   ``I fully appreciate his management style of being apprised of
those kinds of matters. We work very hard do to that,'' Ahlerich
said.
   Runkel said he did not know whether any official in the Justice
Department's criminal division had been informed before Gray was
contacted.
   More broadly, Justice Department guidelines require the approval
of the attorney general before a preliminary inquiry involving a
public official is launched by the FBI.
   Despite the apparent procedural lapse and unauthorized news leaks
about the probe, Runkel said Thornburgh believed the investigation
was being conducted properly by the FBI and the U.S. attorney's
office in Philadelphia.
   The spokesman said Monday night's statement was issued because
the leaks ``had unfairly characterized the status of the matter.''
   Runkel said 10 FBI agents had been temporarily assigned to
Washington from other field offices to assist the Justice
Department's investigation of the leaks.

<TEXT>
   Gov. Bob Martinez asked lawmakers
Wednesday for a law that would punish people who leave firearms
within reach of children.
   ``The concern I would have as a parent is that my child is
visiting a neighbor, and that neighbor hasn't taken the same
precautions and my child is killed or hurt in someone's home,''
Martinez said at a news conference to call the state's legislators
to a three-day special session beginning Monday.
   Lawmakers persuaded Martinez to include the gun-safety measure in
the special session, which is primarily aimed at passing a turnpike
expansion bill, after the accidental shootings of five Florida
youngsters since June 1. In each case, children found guns and shot
either themselves or other children. Two died.
   The latest victim, 4-year-old Silvio Pierre, remained in critical
condition Wednesday at a Tampa hospital. He found his father's
.25-caliber pistol under a couch while playing Sunday.
   ``By public policy we can make a sound statement that we hope and
we pray that people who own weapons place them in a secure positon
so children cannot gain access to them,'' said Martinez. He said he
kept a gun in his home when he lived in Tampa, but said it was
safely stored.
   Marion Hammer, director of the state arm of the National Rifle
Association, attacked the proposal.
   ``Putting grief-stricken parents in jail will do nothing to
prevent future tragedies,'' she said. ``If it's to be a revenge
mechanism for parents who have not properly taught children not to
touch guns outside of their homes, that will be what it will
probably do most.''
   ``I think it's political games,'' she added. ``The governor is
putting in the call so he can stand back and say, `I did something.'
We all know he's done nothing. If he wanted to do something he could
call for education on gun safety.''
   Under a proposal by state Rep. Harry Jennings, it would be a
misdemeanor to leave a firearm accessible to a child. The offense
would be a felony with a maximum five-year prison term if the person
who left the gun accessible was negligent and a child died or was
permanently maimed.
   Jennings' measure was passed by the House during the recent
regular session, but the Senate didn't take it up.
   His bill would require that guns be secured with a trigger lock
or kept in a locked container.
   ``I think if we did nothing else other than pass the gun bill, it
would be worth the trip,'' Senate President Bob Crawford said
Wednesday in a telephone interview.

   Chinese students working in this country for the
democracy movement in their homeland find dwindling support among
classmates and face increasing odds that they can't go home again.
   ``Everybody is afraid of going back to China because you land
yourself in jail,'' said Ding Xueliang, 36, a Harvard University
student active in the democracy movement-in-exile. ``That's equal to
suicide.''
   Ding, a sociologist, said he isn't worried about the personal
consequences of his political work.
   ``We'll continue to speak out,'' Ding said. ``It could cause more
trouble, but our moral obligation is to help our friends in China.''
   Cheng Mo, a 26-year-old mathematician studying at Brandeis
University, said concern for their safety and a loss of enthusiasm
has shrunk to three the original core of half-dozen students working
the hot line at the China Information Center at the Walker
Ecumenical Exchange in suburban Newton.
   The hot line is expanding with a donation of more phone lines and
facsimile machines to collect and disseminate information about
events in China.
   ``There is a concern here, but I think we're all committed to
it,'' Cheng said Wednesday. ``It's our responsibility to keep the
democratic movement alive. I just feel I have to do it.''
   Cheng added he believes there is no escaping the eye of Chinese
authorities, even behind the ivy covered walls of U.S. academia.
   ``The Chinese government are doing something here,'' Cheng said.
``Monday in Harvard there was a meeting (of students) ... and over
the night all these posters were gone. (The posters were) not
cleaned up by janitors.''
   Gong Xiaoxia, 33, who is working on her doctorate in sociology at
Harvard, said she is concerned for her husband, whose research will
require him to return to China for one year.
   Ms. Gong refused to disclose her husband's name or his field of
research. But she said he just returned from six months in China,
including four weeks in Tiananmen Square with the protesters. She
feels torn between ambition and fear at the prospect of his return
to China, she said.
   ``My husband has a long project. That's very important to our
personal career. I'm so worried about that,'' Ms. Gong said.
   But, she said, ``Since so many people have already died in China,
how can I (be) concerned (with) myself so much?''

   Joseph Hazelwood, the former Exxon skipper whose
tanker ran aground and caused the biggest oil spill in U.S. history,
was heckled aboard an airline flight by passengers who videotaped
him and called him ``a real jerk.''
   Alaska Airlines spokesman Lou Cancelmi said airport police were
asked to meet the plane and ensure peace when the flight from
Anchorage arrived Tuesday night in Seattle.
   ``My understanding is that some folks on board were taking video
pictures of him,'' said Cancelmi.
   Hazelwood was on the first leg of his trip back to New York with
two attorneys, one of whom asked the passengers to stop the
videotaping, which they did, Cancelmi said.
   The plane carried about 35 passengers and was not crowded, he
said.
   A passenger aboard Flight 102 told The Seattle Times he saw a man
he believed to be Hazelwood and asked the flight attendants whether
they knew they had ``a real jerk'' on the plane.
   He then walked past Hazelwood and called him a jerk, and other
passengers took up the heckling with more names and jeers, the
passenger said.
   The passenger, who was not identified by the Times, said the
heckling ``cooled down'' when flight attendants asked them to stop.
   One of Hazelwood's traveling companions asked the flight crew to
have security standing by when the plane landed, and the flight crew
complied with the request, Cancelmi said.
   ``As far as we were concerned, there was no situation on board
that warranted anything of the sort,'' Cancelmi said.
   ``No doubt there are strong feelings felt in Alaska (about
Hazelwood), but it apparently did not manifest itself in people
shouting or screaming at him or anything of that sort,'' he said.
   A spokeswoman for Port of Seattle police said three officers were
sent to the terminal to ``keep the peace'' when the flight landed at
8:44 p.m.
   Hazelwood left the plane last, without incident, Cancelmi said.
   Hazelwood, 42, of Huntington, N.Y., had been in Anchorage to
plead innocent Monday to state felony charges of criminal mischief
in the March 24 oil spill, in which nearly 11 million gallons of
crude oil escaped into Prince William Sound from the Exxon Valdez.
   Hazelwood earlier pleaded innocent to separate misdemeanor
charges. A June 20 trial date was set for both sets of charges, said
Dick Madson, a Fairbanks, Alaska, attorney representing Hazelwood.

<HEAD>Negotiations Resume Over Doubling of Fuel Prices</HEAD>

   Striking cab drivers resumed talks with
the Sandinista government Wednesday over the doubling of gasoline
prices, a day after riot police fired tear gas to disperse 1,000
drivers holding a meeting.
   Only a few cabs were on the streets Wednesday, and those defying
the strike order faced union sanctions.
   On Tuesday, the drivers rejected an offer by the leftist
government so sell gas for four days at the old price of 88 cents a
gallon. Taxi drivers presented a list of seven demands to the
government, including freezing fuel prices.
   Union leaders met again with Transportation Minister Mauricio
Valenzuela and other government officials Wednesday.
   As part of anti-inflation measures, the government on Monday
increased the price of gasoline to the equivalent of $1.86 a gallon,
a 110 percent increase. It also devalued the cordoba by 52.5
percent, from 9,500 cordobas to 20,000 cordobas per dollar.
   ``We have put up with a lot because of our goodwill, and we
recognize the situation the country is in,'' said Manuel Jerez of
the 19th of July taxi union. ``But that doesn't mean that we're
going to starve our families.''
   About 200 riot police fired tear gas Tuesday night into a packed
gas station yard that serves as serves as a taxi union headquarters.
Cabbies at first refused to leave, singing the Nicaraguan national
anthem with raised fists and eyes teary eyes from gas fumes.
   They dispersed after their leaders told them the strike would
continue indefinitely. The leaders also told strikers to avoid
confrontations with the police, who said the gathering of about
1,000 cabbies was illegal.
   Each devaluation of Nicaragua's currency, the cordoba, brings
higher fuel prices, which raise most other prices, from food to
public transportation to services. Monday's devaluation was the 20th
and highest of the year.
   Last year inflation was a record 20,000 percent. In January, the
government introduced austerity measures to check hyperinflation and
last month the cost of living rose 15 percent.
   But the austerity measures included cuts in government
investments and subsidies, and they brought on a recession that has
eaten into workers' salaries.

   Oklahoma Natural Gas Co. workers on
Wednesday checked out hundreds of reported gas leaks after an
equipment malfunction sent strong-smelling gas throughout the
Oklahoma City area.
   A lightning strike Tuesday morning at ONG's Edmond storage
facility caused a machine called an ``odorizer'' to malfunction,
company spokesman Don Sherry said.
   The machine normally drips minute quantities of the chemical
mercaptan into natural gas to give it a familiar, pungent smell. But
Sherry said the machinery instead dumped about nine gallons of the
chemical into an inactive gas line.
   The gas line was re-activated Tuesday night, and the
chemical-laden gas began moving through the ONG distribution system,
he said.
   The chemical is non-toxic, Sherry said.
   ``There's no harm, but it's very pungent, especially in these
quantities,'' Sherry said.
   The utility had about 1,200 leak calls pending at one time
Wednesday, compared to 100 normally, Sherry said.
   ``Of course we have to investigate each one. We're not going to
take any chances. But it's taking much longer to respond to calls,''
he said. ``We've been trying to get the word out that in all
probability what they're smelling is that mercaptan.''

<HEAD>`Motor Voter' Bill Clears Senate Committee Hurdle</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate Rules Committee, split along party
lines, approved a package Wednesday that would require states to
allow voters to register for federal elections through the mail and
when they apply for drivers licenses.
   ``I hate to see it come down to a partisan effort,'' Committee
Chairman Wendell Ford, D-Ky., said as the bill was approved 6-3.
   Democrats were in favor, saying the measure would prompt more
Americans to go to the polls. Fewer than 50 percent of eligible
Americans voted in November.
   Senate Republicans, however, were critical of the measure with
Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, leading the attack.
   ``Rides roughshod over the rights of small states,'' said
Stevens. ``It's going to be very badly received in the West and I
would warn most people from the West to stay away from it.''
   Ford scoffed at that claim. ``If we were running roughshod over
small states, I would be bitterly opposed to it, because my state is
small.''
   The ``motor voter'' bill would apply only to federal elections.
Drivers license applications would automatically register qualified
voters unless they declined by checking a box on the form.
   States would be required to use a uniform application for mail
registration produced by the Federal Election Commission.
Notarization and other forms of authentication would be barred. A
number of government agencies would provide help in filling out
forms.
   Names of voters could not be purged from registration lists for
failure to vote under the Senate measure.
   A House version of the bill that has cleared committee and awaits
floor action includes a purging provision that calls for address
verification to be carried out every two years, using a
non-forwardable postcard or the Postal Service's computerized change
of address system.
   The Senate Rules Committee's bill would not require states that
currently permit registration on election day to change that
practice. But it would bar any state that does not already have such
a provision to adopt it.
   The Senate Judiciary Committee currently is weighing a rival
measure under which states would be required to file a plan with the
attorney general if the percentage of minority registration dropped
below the percentage of non-minority registration.

<HEAD>Yeutter Sees Boon For Farmers in Clean Air Package</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Corn farmers may see a growing market in the
fuel industry during the next decade if Congress goes along with
President Bush's clean air plan, Agriculture Secretary Clayton
Yeutter said Wednesday.
   It's too early to make predictions, he said, but Bush's call for
more cars to use ``neat'' fuels that don't pollute ``should be
perceived as potentially good news'' for farmers.
   Yeutter said the Bush proposal calls for manufacturers to turn
out 500,000 cars a year by 1995 and 1 million a year by 1997 that
are equipped to use alternative fuels.
   During his visit this week to the University of Nebraska, Bush
participated in a demonstration of an automobile using ethanol-based
fuel, and witnessed another using a combination of ethanol and ETBE
_ ethyl tertiary-butyl ether _ a promising alternative to gasoline.
   Ethanol, a fuel-grade alcohol currently processed in the United
States mostly from corn, has held high hopes for many farmers and
energy companies for years. It's production has been heavily
subsidized to make it competitive.
   Yeutter told reporters that ETBE has an ethanol base at the
moment but also could be based on methanol, a rival fuel made from
coal, natural gas and plants.
   ``A lot can happen in the next six or seven years,'' he said.
``We really don't know what might be the fuels of choice at that
time.''
   Yeutter said that during talks within the administration on
reform of the 1970 Clean Air Act, he cautioned against announcing a
specific fuel for the 1995 project and beyond.
   ``Technology that exists today for ethanol or methanol or any
other neat fuel could change dramatically,'' he said.
   Also, Yeutter said, the current technology and methods of
providing ethanol from corn could not compete with gasoline without
federal subsidies.
   ``Whether or not that will be the case by 1995 remains to be
seen,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   President Bush hailed the Arab League's effort
to resolve the crisis in Lebanon, saying Wednesday that the
organization's peace overture has ``strong, enthusiastic'' U.S.
support.
   ``This initiative is most appreciated by everybody,'' Bush told
the visiting Saudi Arabian foreign minister, Prince Saud Al-Faisal.
   The Arab League is attempting to negotiate a truce in Lebanon
between Syrian-backed Druze forces and Christian militia and to spur
major political reforms in the embattled country.
   ``We're going to work very hard on this,'' Saud told Bush.
   The president told reporters, ``They are engaged in a mission
that comes with the greatest of intentions and met with the strong,
enthusiastic support of the United States, as they try to be helpful
in bringing peace to Lebanon.''
   The White House said after the extended meeting that ``the
president welcomed the collective efforts of Saudi Arabia, Morocco
and Algeria, and expressed U.S. support for their mandate to pursue
urgently a political process in Lebanon leading to elections,
reforms and a new national consensus.''
   The league, at its summit meeting in Morocco last month, gave
King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, King Hassan II of Morocco and Algeria's
President Chadli Bendjedid the task of trying to arrange a ceasefire
and lasting political reforms in Lebanon within six months.
   ``They are engaged in a mission that comes with the greatest of
intentions and met with the strong, enthusiastic support of the
United States, as they try to be helpful in bringing peace to
Lebanon,'' Bush said at the outset of the meeting with the Saudi
Arabian foreign minister.
   Saud emerged from the White House to tell reporters, ``I shall
convey to our leaders when I get back that we have the full support
of the United States government in this regard, and this is
something we are very pleased with.''
   Reporters heard Bush telling Saud, ``I think the kingdom (Saudi
Arabia) in such a key role and such a respect level, that perhaps
your active involvement will make the difference.''
   Fifteen foreigners are thought to be held hostage in Lebanon,
nine of them Americans, including Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press.
   Lakhdar Ibrahimi of Algeria, assistant secretary-general of the
Arab League, visited Moslem west Beirut today to meet with acting
Prime Minister Salim Hoss, a Sunni Moslem who heads one of two
cabinets competing to run the country. The other government is run
by Christian army commander Gen. Michel Aoun, a Maronite Catholic.
   Syrian and Christian gunners traded rocket and artillery fire in
and around Beirut amid reports that Aoun had rejected a Syrian
proposal for halting the confrontation.

   The U.S. and Soviet envoys to the United
Nations on Wednesday said the Chinese suppression of pro-democracy
protesters in Beijing should not be taken to the Security Council.
   Soviet envoy Alexander M. Belonogov and U.S. representative
Thomas R. Pickering said taking the military action to the council
might be unwarranted interference in China's internal affairs.
   And the military crackdown in Beijing should not affect China's
recent application to join U.N. observers in the Middle East and
southern Africa, they said.
   Belonogov said China's crackdown poses no threat to international
security and should not be discussed by the United Nations.
   But Pickering, while opposing discussion at this time, did not
rule out that China's human rights performance might be raised later.
   He said the United States has made emphatic statements deploring
the loss of civilian lives and mass arrests in the crackdown on the
pro-democracy movement. The Soviet Union has not criticized China's
action.
   ``These are terribly difficult acts for us to accept,'' Pickering
told a news conference with Belonogov.
   There has been no formal move to raise the issue in the Security
Council, the highest U.N. body overseeing international peace and
security. China is one of the five permanent members of the
15-nation council and as such can kill any resolution.
   The other four permanent members are the United States, the
Soviet Union, Britain and France.

   China has bought another 100,000 metric tons of
U.S. wheat for delivery in the 1989-89 marketing year that began
June 1, the Agriculture Department said Wednesday.
   The latest sales boosted to more than 3.28 million tons the
amount of U.S. wheat China has purchased for the 1989-90 season,
officials said. Last year's sales totaled 8.3 million tons, making
China the leading foreign market for American wheat farmers.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels
of wheat. The 100,000 tons would be about 3.67 million bushels.
   Wheat prices at the farm have averaged around $3.88 per bushel
nationally, according to USDA recent five-day market estimates. That
would make the sale worth about $14 million.

   A Republican call to arms against
``ultra-liberal Senate Democrats'' was unconvincing to at least one
man on the mailing list _ Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, a liberal senator
the GOP has classed with the ``ultras'' for years.
   ``Though I cannot send you any money for your efforts, I can send
you my heartfelt wish that you achieve the same success in 1990 that
the GOP earned in the 1988 Senate race in Ohio,'' Metzenbaum wrote
back.
   He won re-election last year, attributing at least part of his
landslide victory to voter backlash after Republican attacks.
   Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, was one of thousands of people who were sent
the personalized solicitation, said Wendy DeMocker, communications
director for the Republican National Senatorial Committee.
   The fund-raising letter seeks charter members of a ``Republican
Presidential Task Force'' whose mission is ``to elect a Republican
majority to the U.S. Senate in 1990.''
   ``Some of the most outspoken, combative, extremist anti-Bush
Senate Democrats are up for re-election. And the more of these
ultra-liberal Senate Democrats we can replace in the 1990 elections,
the better,'' said the solicitation signed by Sen. Don Nickles,
R-Okla.
   That the solicitation went to Metzenbaum didn't seem to trouble
DeMocker. ``I am sure it happens when the Democrats do mailings,
too,'' she said. ``He should send the $10.''

<HEAD>Rural Development Passes Committee With Accord on Drought Relief</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PHILIP BRASHER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A $300 million rural development program
unanimously passed the Senate Agriculture Committee Wednesday after
Senate leaders agreed to wait until next month to act on drought
relief.
   Democrats had charged that Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole's
insistence on passing drought aid for winter farmers before
approving a rural development bill could have scuttled both measures.
   But committee Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., and the panel's
ranking Republican, Sen. Richard Lugar of Indiana, said they had
agreed to move forward with the rural development bill and act July
19 on drought relief.
   ``I think everybody has been accommodated,'' said Leahy. ``I
think we have virtually guaranteed that we will have a feasible
rural development bill on the floor, one that will have a good
chance of passing. ... We have also guaranteed that we can make a
real try at drought legislation.''
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, has promised the
Senate would act on the rural development program this summer and
send it to the House, which has no similar legislation.
   The rural development package would provide $100 million in
federal seed money for revolving loan funds as well as $200 million
to improve education, health services, communications and utilities
in rural areas to encourage business expansion.
   Dole, of Kansas, had argued in a committee meeting Tuesday that
quick action on drought relief for winter wheat should take
precedence over rural development legislation.
   Kansas winter wheat farmers have been wiped out by the early
spring drought, said Dole, who has sponsored a bill extending terms
of 1988 drought relief to crops planted in 1988 for harvest this
year _ namely winter wheat.
   Winter wheat crop losses in Kansas, the hardest hit of all the
states, have been estimated to be $1.6 billion, said Dole.
   However, it became apparent that neither drought relief nor rural
development could pass without broad support in the Agriculture
Committee, Lugar said. Committee members had been threatening to
sidetrack or delay one bill or the other, he said.
   ``We've essentially agreed that we're all going to work for floor
action on these two things,'' Lugar said.
   Some farm-state lawmakers, such as Sen. Kent Conrad, D-N.D., did
not want to pass a drought relief bill before it was known how
extensive the dry weather would be this year.
   Conrad's state was devastated by drought last year and experts
are still concerned about dry soil conditions in the upper Midwest.
``I was very concerned because we're only going to have one drought
bill,'' Conrad said.
   Leahy said drought relief legislation would be discussed July 13
with a committee vote July 19.
   Rural development is a high priority as Congress moves toward
designing the 1990 omnibus farm bill. A House subcommittee has been
holding hearings to gather information on communities rapidly losing
population because of depressed economic conditions.
   Farm state lawmakers want to make sure the rural development is
funded this year, so the money doesn't come out of the 1990 farm
bill.

   The Capitol plaza was temporarily transformed
into a mint Wednesday as white-gloved legislators manned giant
presses to strike gold and silver coins commemorating the 200th
anniversary of the Congress.
   The festive ``first strike'' ceremony in a flag-bedecked tent
marked the first time since 1792 that U.S. coins have been struck
outside of an official mint.
   Donna Pope, director of the Mint, said the plaza was a fitting
site for a coin foundry, since the Capitol itself has proved to be a
``great white foundry'' in which Congress turned the dream of
democracy into reality.
   ``It's the anniversary of that 200-year triumph that these coins
commemorate and celebrate,'' she said.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady _ invited by Mrs. Pope to test
his ``Midas touch'' _ was the first to step up to one of the
seven-ton presses, don a white glove, and push the ``run'' button.
   Two ``whumps'' later, Brady proudly displayed a $5 gold coin
featuring the Capitol dome on one side and the American eagle from
the Old Senate Chamber on the other.
   At his next stop, a press outfitted to produce the $1 silver
coin, there was an unexplained malfunction and Brady quickly moved
to a backup machine.
   ``It was bound to happen sooner or later,'' quipped Mrs. Pope.
``Now you know why we have four presses and only two coins.''
   Imprinting the silver coin takes three ``whumps'' _ each packing
205 tons of pressure. The coin features the Statue of Freedom from
the Capitol dome and the mace of the House of Representatives, a
staff topped by an eagle astride the world globe.
   Brady was followed to the presses by Treasurer Katherine Ortega,
Mrs. Pope and a string of members of Congress, including Senate
Republican leader Robert Dole of Kansas, who jokingly tried to
pocket the fruits of his labor.
   Rep. Lindy Boggs, D-La., noted that the Constitution gives
Congress the power to coin money, and said this was ``the first time
in history members of Congress have the opportunity to take the
founding fathers literally.''
   The $22 million expected to be raised from sales of the coins
will be used to help restore the Capitol. High on the priority list:
a facelift for ``Freedom,'' the bronze lady who stands atop the
Capitol dome in disrepair, and the installation of marble fountains
built as part of Lady Bird Johnson's beautification program but
which have languished in a warehouse for lack of money to install
them.
   Mrs. Pope said proceeds ``will ensure that for years to come,
that great white foundry, the home of democracy, the house of
Congress will endure.''
   The coins were struck on presses hauled in from Philadelphia just
for the occasion, but bear ``W'' and ``S'' mint marks, since the
bicentennial series will be produced at the West Point and San
Francisco mints.
   Immediately after the first coins were struck, the mints were
telephoned and instructed to ``start the presses'' on production of
the coins, Mrs. Pope said.
   In addition to the gold and silver coins, the Mint also will
issue a half-dollar coin as part of the bicentennial series. That
coin, 92 percent copper, clad in nickel, features a bust of
``Freedom'' and a full view of the Capitol, ringed in stars.
   The special proof and uncirculated quality coins will come from
specially polished dies, have a mirror-like finish, are hand-fed
into the coining press and handled with white gloves, Mrs. Pope said.
   Production will be limited to 1 million $5 gold coins, 3 million
$1 silver coins and 4 million half-dollar coins. Regular prices,
which include a surcharge for the Capitol Preservation Fund, will
range from $6 for an uncirculated half-dollar to $215 for a
proof-quality gold coin. A six-coin set that includes a proof and
uncirculated version of each of the three coins will sell for $480.
   They will be available in August from coin and precious metals
dealers, participating banks and financial institutions.

<TEXT>
   President Bush, declaring ``enough is enough,''
railed Wednesday against a group of House Republicans trying to
weaken the chief reform of his plan to cover $100 billion of savings
and loan losses.
   As the House began debate on the measure, Bush joined the
campaign against industry-sponsored amendments by Reps. Jimmy
Quillen, R-Tenn., and Henry Hyde, R-Ill., to exempt some 450 S&amp;Ls
from having to put up $6 billion in new capital to protect taxpayers
from future losses.
   ``I have a certain sense of obligation to the American public to
get legislation through that is going to protect the people against
the abuses of the past, and to fix it and fix it once and for all,''
Bush said.
   Pounding the table during a Cabinet Room meeting with
congressional leaders, he said, ``Every American citizen has every
right in the world to be disturbed and shocked by this situation.''
   Including interest, the bailout is expected to cost taxpayers
between $157 billion and $200 billion over the next 30 years, or
$600 for every man, woman and child in the country, according to the
General Accounting Office.
   Bush urged the defeat of amendments that would allow some
institutions to count a non-cash accounting entry _ ``supervisory
good will'' _ as at-risk capital for meeting the proposed new
standards.
   ``Some of the small _ or the weaker I would say _ S&amp;Ls are
demanding the right to continue to treat good will as capital, even
though good will has no tangible value,'' Bush said.
   The result, he said, is that those thrifts could lend up to $600
billion in federally insured deposits _ which taxpayers are
ultimately obligated to cover _ ``without one dollar in real capital
for decades to come.''
   ``In my view, it is time for the American public and our
administration to say that enough is enough and to earnestly ask for
the support of the Congress,'' Bush said. ``I think every American
citizen has every right in the world to be disturbed and shocked by
this situation.''
   Both Republican and Democratic House leaders said Bush's remarks
should bolster the case against the ``good will'' amendments, which
have won wide-scale support, particularly among Republicans.
   It was helpful ``to have Presdient Bush step up to the plate, to
use his baseball metaphor, and take a swing at the ball,'' said
House GOP Whip Newt Gingrich of Georgia.
   But even before his remarks, it was doubtful that Quillen and
Hyde had sufficient support for their measures, which are to be
voted on Wednesday in an order that gives supporters of Bush's
proposal a second shot at defeating them if one should pass.
   ``They've structured the capital amendments so that we can't
win,'' said one vehement congressional supporter of the ``good
will'' accounting practices, speaking on the condition of anonymity.
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley called Bush's remarks ``helpful''
but added, ``I think the House is headed toward a very strong bill
in any event.''
   The ``good will'' exemptions totaling more than $20 billion were
granted by federal regulators in the early 1980s as a way of
encouraging healthy S&amp;Ls to take over insolvent thrifts and postpone
for several years the current crisis.
   In effect, the accounting practice allows S&amp;L owners to count as
capital the losses of failed institutions they acquired for as long
as 40 years.
   The Senate reduced the effective life of the exemptions to 25
years, but the House Banking Committee cut their life to just five
years. Bush originally has proposed phasing out the exemptions over
10 years.
   More than two-thirds of the nation's 2,938 S&amp;Ls have well more
than the current capital for meeting Bush's proposed new
requirements without including ``good will'' on their books.
   And about 500 institutions are so helplessly insolvent that they
will be liquidated or merged with other healthy S&amp;Ls under the
bailout proposal.
   Quillen and Hyde are trying to protect the 450 S&amp;Ls who hold
about one-third of the industry's $1.3 trillion in assets and would
have either to raise new capital or shrink in size if the ``good
will'' exemptions are phased out.

<HEAD>Two IRA Suspects Indicted in Attacks on British Military</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Two suspected members of the IRA
have been indicted for attempted murder in two bombing attacks
against British military bases that wounded 46 people in West
Germany, prosecutors said Wednesday.
   Chief Federal Prosecutor Kurt Rebmann said the Irish Republican
Army was responsible for attacks against British military targets
throughout Europe.
   Terence Gerard McGeough and Gerard Thomas Hanratty, both 30 and
both born in Northern Ireland, have been in prison since they were
arrested, heavily armed, near the Dutch border last August.
   Rebmann said the two also were charged with ``other crimes'' not
specified in the written statement sent to news media.
   In the first attack, a car bomb exploded March 23, 1987, outside
a British army mess hall in Rheindahlen near the Dutch border,
wounding 36 people, most of them West Germans. The IRA claimed
responsibility, saying it intended to ``inflict a devastating blow''
on Britain's NATO forces in West Germany.
   Rebmann said McGeough and Hanratty were also charged in the
early-morning bombing of a British army barracks that injured 10
sleeping soldiers on July 13, 1988, in the Wanheim residential
section of Duisburg, about 25 miles from the West German-Dutch
border.
   Police fired 10 shots at the suspected get-away car as it sped
away.
   The IRA was stepping up attacks on British targets on the
Continent at that time, including killing three British airmen in
the Netherlands on May 1, 1988.
   The mainly Roman Catholic IRA is fighting to end British rule in
Protestant-ruled Northern Ireland and unite it with the 95 percent
Roman Catholic Republic of Ireland under socialist rule.
   Rebmann's spokesman, Hans-Juergen Foerster, said Wednesday:
``McGeough and Hanratty are suspected of being members of the IRA,
not ringleaders.''
   He told The Associated Press by telephone he did not know when
the pair will go on trial.

   House Democrats on Wednesday elected Richard
Gephardt of Missouri as majority leader, embracing a ``no problems''
former presidential candidate in an effort to push beyond the ethics
furor that felled two top party leaders.
   The Democrats then chose Rep. William H. Gray III, D-Pa., to be
majority whip, making him the No. 3 Democrat in the House, behind
Speaker Thomas S. Foley and Gephardt, and the highest-ranking black
in Congress.
   Gephardt defeated Georgia conservative Ed Jenkins, 181-76, and
Gray won with 134 votes to 97 votes for David Bonior of Michigan and
30 for Beryl Anthony of Arkansas.
   The two victors, both considered liberals, fill out the new
leadership team Democrats have had to install in midterm because of
the resignations of Speaker Jim Wright of Texas, and Whip Tony
Coelho of California, both following ethics allegations. Foley, of
Washington, was elected speaker last week.
   Shortly after their selection, Gephardt and Gray jopined other
congressional leaders for a White House meeting with President Bush
on the savings and loan bailout bill.
   Bush began the session by congratulating both men, saying ``I
look forward to working with you, arguing with you, working with you
_ and I do mean that.''
   Gephardt accepted the No. 2 post with a call to Democrats to push
aside what he said were Republican attempts to slander the party. A
top GOP official was forced to resign last week after sending out a
statement comparing Foley's voting record to that of a homosexual
congressman _ an episode Democrats contend was an example of typical
Republican tactics.
   ``Some on the other side are committed to the dark side of
politics, smear, innuendo, rumors, cynical media management, the
politics of character assassination,'' Gephardt said. ``But let us
say... that we will win at the ballot box not by the force of our
slurs but the force of our ideas.''
   In the secret ballot, Gray won the whip's post over two rivals
despite news reports that personnel practices in his office were
under investigation by the Justice Department.
   After Wednesday's vote, Gray said he was helped by a statement
from the department that he was not the subject of the federal
probe, and he was grateful for the vote of confidence from his
colleagues.
   Bonior will continue in his role as chief deputy whip and Anthony
as chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.
   Jenkins said in his campaign it was time for the Democratic
leadership to include a representative of the more conservative wing
of the party, and although he didn't win there were assurances that
a Southerner would be installed in an appointed leadership post.
   ``The party has to do more... to expand to include the one-third
of its party that is in the more conservative ranks,'' especially if
it expects to win the White House, he said.
   Gephardt's experience as a presidential candidate will help the
party in the House and nationally, said Rep. Dan Glickman, D-Kan.,
an ally.
   ``He is more on the cutting edge of issues than we've had for
some time,'' Glickman said. And the fact that he survived the 1988
presidential campaign without a hint of dirt in his background gave
``in a sense a kind of a relief that people know he's got no
problems.''
   In a nominating speech for Gephardt, Rep. David Obey, D-Wis.,
alluded to ethics attacks on Democrats by Rep. Newt Gingrich, R-Ga.
``In this era of Newtspeak, we need to confront crass with class,''
Obey said, according to one staff member present.
   Afterward, Gephardt echoed Foley's statement last week that
ethics and campaign reform legislation is a top priority this year.
But he emphasized the theme of economic nationalism that was the
hallmark of his unsuccessful run for the Democratic nomination last
year.
   ``In my humble opinion, America is beginning to be in a state of
decline,'' Gephardt told reporters. ``And we as Democrats have to
lead, even though it's not a crisis. Even though the presidency is
held by a different party. And even though getting our consensus
together on the Democratic side is always difficult to do.''
   Wednesday's election left a vacancy in Gray's former position as
chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, the No. 4 position. The
Democrats will meet later to fill that post which is being contested
by two candidates, Reps. Steny Hoyer, D-Md., and Barbara Kennelly,
D-Conn.

<TEXT>
   Oliver L. North's motion to set aside his three
Iran-Contra convictions was denied Wednesday by the trial judge,
clearing the way for the former White House aide's sentencing next
week.
   U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell, who presided over eight
weeks of testimony in the case, rejected North's last post-trial
motions, including a request for an acquittal judgment or a new
trial on each of the three felony convictions.
   North, scheduled to be sentenced June 23, could face a 10-year
prison term and $750,000 in fines if given the maximum sentences for
his convictions of unlawfully destroying government documents,
aiding and abetting in obstructing Congress and illegally accepting
a gratuity from arms dealer Richard V. Secord.
   Gesell ruled there was ``sufficient proof for the jury to find
... that North was aiding and abetting'' a Reagan administration
effort to conceal from Congress details of the sale of U.S. arms to
Iran.
   The judge also rejected North's contention that prosecutors had
not proven that he was the legal custodian of records he was
convicted of mutilating after the Iran-Contra affair became public
in November, 1986.
   ``There was ample proof that North checked out highly sensitive
Top Secret official documents, asked his secretary to alter these
documents and never returned the originals or acknowledged
alterations,'' Gesell said. ``This is exactly the type of conduct
(the statute) has criminalized for well over a century.''
   ``There was ample proof that North engaged in a deliberate effort
to rewrite what had occurred by attempting to falsify the official
record of the National Security Council,'' the judge said in his
13-page opinion.
   Gesell also rejected North's arguments that he was unfairly
convicted of illegally accepting the installation of a $13,800
security system paid for by Secord outside North's Great Falls, Va.,
home.
   The judge rejected a defense contention that the jury should have
been instructed to consider North's testimony that he accepted the
security system from Secord because no government agency would
protect him following terrorist threats.
   ``Long after North heard of the threat by Abu Nidal, he backdated
letters indicating he was to pay for the system and he concealed the
fact that Secord had actually paid (security consultant Glenn)
Robinette for the system,'' the judge said.
   ``This behavior reflects his realization of wrongdoing, rather
than duress,'' the judge said.
   ``North had a legal alternative to acceptance of the security
system as a gratuity,'' Gesell said. ``He could have paid for it
himself from the funds he admittedly had,'' the judge said,
referring to North's testimony that he kept $15,000 in cash in a
locked box in his closet.
   Prosecutors contended the security system was an illegal gratuity
because Secord was benefiting financially from the sale of U.S. arms
to Iran.
   Gesell disposed of two other defense motions:
   _Dismissing a defense motion for a hearing on an April 22 letter
that NBC News distributed to the homes of jurors requesting
interviews after the verdict. ``There is no rational way that a
juror's natural resentment against this interference with privacy by
the television media could affect the outcome either way,'' said
Gesell, who had rejected the same motion last month.
   _Denying another defense motion, which had been made under seal,
seeking a closed hearing on alleged conduct of a juror. The contents
of the motion were not released.

<HEAD>Panel Agrees to Fund SSC at $200 Million in Fiscal 1990</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A House Appropriations subcommittee voted
Wednesday to spend $200 million to begin construction of the super
collider after President Bush assured the panel chairman that
several foreign countries would share the costs.
   Rep. Tom Bevill, the influential Alabama Democrat who heads the
subcommittee on energy and water, said Energy Secretary James A.
Watkins told him at a White House meeting before the closed vote
that a $1 billion contribution is expected from Japan.
   Bevill earlier this year had insisted he would not agree to fund
the super collider in fiscal 1990 unless the Energy Department
secured firm commitments from foreign countries willing to share the
$4.4 billion cost.
   But on Wednesday, Bevill agreed to a bill that has no
requirements for any level of foreign participation as well as no
restrictions on the $200 million. Initial construction could begin
after Oct. 1, the first day of the new fiscal year.
   ``Watkins assured all of us that they're going to have a good bit
of participation,'' Bevill said.
   Also attending the session were Rep. John Myers of Indiana, the
panel's ranking Republican, White House chief of staff John Sununu
and Budget Director Richard Darman.
   Other potential contributors mentioned by Watkins were Italy and
India, Bevill said. India is the only foreign nation to sign a
commitment to share costs of the particle accelerator and has
promised to contribute $50 million.
   After his meeting with the president, Bevill issued a statement
saying: ``I told him I would put the money in for him, but it may be
difficult to get it approved. It's a good project, but the cost of
it concerns me a great deal. It will be up to Congress to make the
final decision.''
   Under the subcommittee's plan, $110 million would be set aside to
initiate construction at the Ellis County site, including
preparation for tunneling of the 53-mile underground ring for
high-energy physics experiments that scientists hope will help them
understand the fundamental nature of matter. The remaining $90
million would be used for research and development.
   The full committee could vote on the appropriation as early as
next week, said Rep. Jim Chapman. The Senate Appropriations
Committee, however, has yet to vote on the collider and ``we've got
a battle in the Senate to win.''
   Under the House version, the money could be used for detailed
design, construction of power and utility facilities, site
preparations and for support buildings. Also included are funds for
long-lead procurement of such items as tooling and superconducting
materials.

<HEAD>Defense Rests in Former Congressman's Perjury Trial</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After a near brush with a mistrial, testimony
ended Wednesday in the perjury trial of former Rep. Pat Swindall _
without the former congressman taking the witness stand.
   The defense rested on the 17th day of the trial in U.S. District
Court, and prosecutors called only one rebuttal witness. Attorneys
planned to make legal arguments to the judge Thursday, and the jury
was told to return Friday for closing statements.
   Swindall's testimony before a grand jury got him indicted in the
first place. He is accused of nine counts of perjury for lying to a
federal grand jury in February 1988 regarding his 1987 dealings with
an undercover agent posing as a money launderer and with a Swindall
associate, who has since been convicted of money laundering.
   Swindall, a Republican who served two terms in Congress from
Atlanta's eastern suburbs before being defeated last November, faces
10 months to five years in prison on each of the nine perjury counts
if convicted.
   The trial nearly came to a halt after prosecutor Craig Gillen
asked a defense witness, defense lawyer Bobby Lee Cook, a question
regarding the possible motivations of defendants to testify.
   Isn't it correct, Gillen asked, that ``if a defendant were to
testify and he knew certain things ... could help him ... he would
be more prone to testify in that regard?''
   Swindall attorney Tom Thrash immediately asked U.S. District
Judge Richard C. Freeman to declare a mistrial, arguing that the
question planted in the jurors' minds the thought that if Swindall
did not testify, it would be because he had something to hide.
   Freeman _ after fretting ``I'll salvage this if I can'' and
taking a break to study law books _ returned and denied the mistrial
motion.
   He also ordered the jury not to infer anything if Swindall chose
not to testify, as is his right.
   Swindall, whom Freeman has already ordered to stop smirking in
court, got another rebuke from the judge as he nodded his head while
his attorney argued for a mistrial.
   ``Don't you shake your head at me,'' Freeman warned. ``You've got
two lawyers there and I'm going to listen to them, not you.''

<TEXT>
   Eight environmental groups and the state of
Massachusetts filed suit Wednesday seeking to overturn a decision by
federal regulators to streamline the licensing process for
commercial nuclear power plants.
   The streamlining by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission took effect
last month and was aimed at encouraging electric utilities to build
new nuclear stations.
   No new nuclear plants have been ordered since 1978, in part
because of a lengthy licensing process that sometimes has stretched
for 13 years. Lando Zech Jr., the NRC chairman, has said the new
process can cut the licensing time to six years.
   Anti-nuclear groups contend the rule changes unfairly limit
public participation in the NRC licensing process.
   ``The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is attempting to create a
future for the nuclear industry by removing the public's voice in
reactor licensing,'' said Michael Marriotte, executive director of
the Nuclear Information and Resource Service.
   Mariotte's group, which is a party to the suit filed in the U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals in Washington, said the NRC revisions
violate the 1954 Atomic Energy Act, which requires the opportunity
for two public hearings _ one before issuing a construction permit
and another before granting an operating license.
   The NRC, which formally adopted its rule change April 18, says it
adheres to the Atomic Energy Act because it allows the possibility
of a second public hearing, although only under certain
circumstances controlled by the NRC.
   Bills have been introduced in Congress to put the NRC changes on
the statutes but no action appears likely this year.
   Robert Polland of the Union of Concerned Scientists, which also
is a party to the lawsuit, said his group favored efforts to resolve
important licensing issues before the start of plant construction.
But he said the new NRC rule goes too far in trying to settle all
issues before the public is fully aware of a plant builder's plans.
   The other groups joining the lawsuit are Public Citizen, the
Committee to Bridge the Gap, the New England Coalition on Nuclear
Pollution, the Sinnissippi Alliance for the Environment, the Energy
Research Foundation and the Citizens for Responsible Energy.

   Fifty years after the Third Reich killed more
than 6 million Jews, some historians are trying to mitigate the Nazi
brutality, the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith charged
Wednesday.
   In a report on Holocaust revisionism, the league warned that such
scholarship may diminish lessons of the genocide.
   The ``new revisionist trend'' acknowledges that the Holocaust
occurred ``but challenges the well-accepted understanding of the
motives behind it,'' said Abraham H. Foxman, national director of
the league.
   The report cited what it said was the suggestion by Princeton
University Professor Arno J. Mayer that the Jews were killed
``because of the Nazis' belief that Bolshevism was a Jewish
creation.'' It said that view disregards the ``massive
documentation'' that the Nazis acted out of anti-Semitism.
   Mayer, reached in France, where he is on leave from Princeton,
said B'nai B'rith had misstated his position. He said he believes
anti-Semitism was a part of Nazi ideology, but not its core, until
it became dominant ``under very, very specific circumstances''
growing from the war in Eastern Europe.
   ``I do not take the position that Jews were killed because of the
anti-Bolshevism'' he said. ``That is an absolute misstatement.''
   The B'nai B'rith report also cited work by West German historians
Ernst Nolte and Hellmut Diwald, who it said argue that it is unfair
to single out the Nazis because other nations also have committed
genocide.
   Mayer called it ``an outright insult'' to be linked to Nolte and
Diwald.

   A Navy sailor linked to the
investigation of the gun turret explosion that killed 47 men on the
battleship Iowa has been reassigned to Mayport Naval Station, his
lawyer said Wednesday.
   Gunner's Mate 3rd Class Kendall Truitt has been assigned to a
destroyer commander's staff and could report any time Thursday, said
Lt. Cmdr. Tim Taylor, a Navy spokesman at Mayport.
   ``He wants to become a sailor again,'' Miami attorney Ellis Rubin
said in a telephone interview. ``He would like to just put this
behind him.''
   Published reports have said the Navy has investigated the
relationship between Truitt and his friend, Clayton Hartwig, who
died in the April 19 explosion.
   Truitt, named as the sole beneficiary in a $50,000
double-indemnity life insurance policy purchased by Hartwig, was
reportedly under investigation to see if there was a link between
the men in either a murder or suicide plot. Truitt, 21, has
vehemently denied wrongdoing and has said the Navy was seeking a
scapegoat.
   The board of inquiry investigation of the Iowa disaster is
expected to be released soon, and Truitt will have no comment until
then, Rubin said.
   ``I hope it will contain an apology from the Navy for leaking
this false information,'' the attorney said.
   He said he has asked several times but has no assurances that an
apology will be included in the report.
   In a news conference about two weeks ago in Washington, Truitt
suggested the explosion in the Iowa's No. 2 gun turret may have been
caused by inexperienced sailors pushing bags of gunpowder too
quickly into the 16-inch gun's magazine.
   Rubin also suggested that the gunpowder in the bags was volatile
because it was improperly stored and subjected to high temperatures.
The Navy has denied that storage conditions had anything to do with
the explosion.
   The Iowa recently left Norfolk, Va., on June 8 for six months in
the Mediterranean.

<TEXT>
   Unusual cold-air funnel clouds that looked
like tornadoes touched down around Madison on Wednesday, tossing
cars, damaging buildings and snapping utility lines. No injuries
were reported.
   ``They're not as strong as tornadoes. They usually don't touch
down, but there were two reports of touchdowns from this storm,''
said Margaret Mooney of the National Weather Service in Madison.
   Ordinary funnel clouds and tornadoes generally develop during
intense thunderstorms that form along and some distance ahead of a
cold front during warm, humid weather.
   But there were no intense thunderstorms in the area Wednesday and
the weather was relatively cool, so there was less energy to drive
the funnel clouds than would be available to a tornado, she said.
   The distinction was lost on most people who encountered the storm.
   ``We could see it pick up cars and toss them around like a toy,''
said theater manager Richard Lepsch.
   Employees at a car dealership said the windows in their showroom
blew out and dozens of cars were tossed into one another in the lot.
   ``It sounded like we were in a vacuum cleaner,`` said Russell
Foskett, an employee at the lot.
   ``I went over to close the door,'' Foskett said. ``I thought it
was hailing. It was flying glass. The flag pole was at a 45-degree
angle.''
   Lisa Hoger, a switchboard operator at the auto dealership, said
the storm was ``kind of scary. It just happened all of a sudden,
this big gust of wind.''
   Scott Lawver, a salesman, said he looked out a window and, ``all
I saw was a lot of flying junk _ glass and Styrofoam going in a
circle over the building.''
   Lawver estimated 50 to 60 cars were damaged by the funnel cloud,
and some of their windows were popped out.
   A police dispatcher in Sun Prairie said that city was surrounded
by funnel clouds shortly before noon.
   The storm toppled Alice and Leo Bakke's barn and tobacco shed at
Sun Prairie, blocking a county road.
   ``All the windows were blown out'' in the house, Mrs. Bakke said,
``and all my knick-knacks were broken.''
   Most of the funnel clouds did not touch down.
   John Hermanson was driving on Interstate 90 when he saw a ``big
cloud with a little funnel coming out of it. It looked like a snake
dangling out of it.''

<HEAD>Judge Finds No Prosecution Misconduct In `Cotton Club' Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDA DEUTSCH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge ruled Wednesday that prosecutors did
not intentionally withhold evidence in the ``Cotton Club'' murder
case and refused a defense request to strike key testimony.
   Municipal Court Judge Patti Jo McKay, who heard six days of
testimony on the defense claim that prosecutors violated discovery
rules, said she found no evidence of misconduct.
   ``This court finds there has been no violation of the court's
discovery order,'' she said. ``There has been substantial compliance
with the order.''
   The defense claimed prosecutors withheld details of the testimony
of William Rider, former security chief for ``Hustler'' magazine
publisher Larry Flynt.
   Rider, who testified briefly on June 2, implicated two defendants
in the 1983 murder of New York theatrical producer Roy Radin. He
said William Molony Mentzer and Alex Lamota Marti, also former Flynt
bodyguards, confessed to him that they killed Radin.
   Marti and Mentzer are charged with the murder along with Karen
DeLayne Greenberger and Robert Ulmer Lowe, who has agreed to stop
fighting extradition from Maryland.
   Radin who was negotiating with Hollywood producer Robert Evans to
finance the movie, ``The Cotton Club,'' disappeared on May 13, 1983,
and his body was found a month later 65 miles north of Los Angeles.
   The prosecution alleges Mrs. Greenberger hired the Flynt
bodyguards to kill Radin because of a dispute over profits from the
``Cotton Club'' deal and the theft of some cash and cocaine from
Mrs. Greenberger's home.
   Rider's testimony was halted when defense lawyers said the
witness was blurting out things they had never heard before and a
continuance was granted for the defense until Tuesday to prepare for
a new prosecution witness.
   But on the disclosure complaint, Judge McKay found that most of
the disclosures had been available to the defense through videotapes
of his interviews with authorities. Two investigators and Deputy
District Attorney David Conn said they did not take notes on the
star witness' statements during interviews.
   The defense had asked that Rider's testimony be stricken from the
record and that Conn be held in contempt of court and required to
pay the defense's court costs for the week-long hearing.

<HEAD>Afghan Guerrillas Reportedly Agree in Principle on Interim Government</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A spokesman for Iran-based Afghan rebels
announced Wednesday that his group and Afghan guerrillas based in
Pakistan agreed in principle to form an interim government, Iran's
official news agency said.
   The Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in Nicosia, quoted
Ali Jan Zahedi as saying representatives of the groups reached the
accord this month.
   Zahedi said that once ratified, the agreement would supersede the
existing interim government, in which Iran-based rebels are not
represented.
   The U.S.-backed rebels, known as the mujahedeen (Islamic holy
warriors), are split into the Iran-based Shiite Moslem coalition and
the mainstream Sunni Moslem alliance based in Pakistan.
   The Sunni rebels formed the existing interim government soon
after the Soviet troop withdrawal from Afhganistan was completed in
February. They predicted that President Najib's Marxist regime in
Kabul would quickly collapse, but government troops held their
ground and Najib now is calling for a cease-fire and negotiations.
   The Shiite coalition originally boycotted the provisional
government when it was refused all the seats it demanded. The Sunnis
came courting again, however, after suggestions emerged that the
Shiites might cut a separate deal with the Soviets and fragment the
rebel movement.
   Shiites make up 15 percent of Afghanistan's population.
   In recent fighting in Afghanistan, guerrillas said Wednesday that
their artillery attacks forced Afghan officials to close the airport
outside Kandahar, Afghanistan's second-largest city, during day
hours.
   The airport, in Afghanistan's arid south, was closed Tuesday
after heavy fighting between rebels and communist forces, said the
guerrilla-controlled Afghan News Agency based in Pakistan.
   A steady barrage of rocket fire halted government flights, said
the agency, which speaks for Gulbadin Hekmatyar's radical
Hezb-i-Islami rebel group.
   Kandahar lies about 270 miles south of Kabul and is the home of
Afghan royalty.
   Akbar Nakyar, a spokesman for the National Islamic Front of
Afghanistan rebel group, said the latest report reaching Quetta,
Pakistan, was that government aircraft still could make night
landings.
   The Moslem guerrillas began an insurrection after a communist
coup in Afghanistan in 1978. The war has killed at least 1.3 million
people and about 5 million Afghans _ a third of the population _
have fled to neighboring Pakistan and Iran.
   Guerrillas have not been able to capture a major city but have
wide control of the countryside.

<HEAD>Stolen Artifacts Returned To Mexican Museum In Festive Ceremony</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN WRIGHT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 100 stolen artifacts of jade, gold
and stone missing for 3{ years were returned Wednesday to the
archaeology museum in a ceremony where Mexico's leader welcomed the
nation's ``recovered inheritance.''
   President Carlos Salinas de Gortari told members of his Cabinet
and foreign diplomats at the National Museum of Archaeology that
finding the lost treasure amounts to recovering ``a part of our
identity, a part of our pride.''
   Officials said a pair of college dropouts linked to cocaine
dealers looted seven display cases at the museum before dawn on
Christmas Day, 1985.
   Federal police recovered 111 of the 124 stolen items and arrested
a suspected thief and six associates last week. They were charged in
court Monday with theft and damaging national treasures, authorities
said.
   The loot, dating from 500 B.C. to 2,500 B.C., included masks,
jewelry and other artifacts from Mexico's ancient Aztec, Mixteca,
Maya and Zapotec civilizations.
   Salinas praised ``efficient police action.''
   Attorney General Enrique Alvarez del Castillo, whose department
cracked the case, said: ``To intercede for the nation, with
attatchment to the law, is to intercede for our heritage, our
history, and our resources.''
   Salinas and Alvarez promised to beef up security at Mexico's
museums and 150 archaeological zones.
   Museum director Sonia Lombardo gave Salinas and his Cabinet a
tour of the pieces _ now enclosed in glass cases _ in a display
called ``Recovered Inheritance.''
   Investigators got a lead in the case from a suspected drug
trafficker arrested in April at Reynosa, across the border from
McAllen, Texas, Alvarez told reporters Monday.
   Federal agents in Mexico City followed one suspect, Carlos
Perches Trevino, 24, for 45 days before his arrest Friday, Alvarez
said.
   Perches and Ramon Sardina Garcia had staked out the museum for
six months, visiting it more than 50 times to determine which were
the most valuable pieces, he said.
   The pair then jumped the fence, crawled in through an air
conditioning duct and looted seven display cases.
   Officials said investigators were stumped for so long because
they believed professionals executed the daring theft.
   Alvarez said the two men kept the treasure in a closet in
Perches' parents house for more than a year, then took it to the
Pacific resort town of Acapulco.
   There, they met some drug traffickers and tried to interest one,
Salvador Gutierrez, in buying the artifacts. Perches and Sardina
gave him several artifacts in exchange for an unspecified amount of
cocaine but never completed a deal for the entire cache.
   Authorities still are searching for the missing items.
   One of the most important pieces, a restored Zapotec mask of the
bat-god Murcielago from the Monte Alban ruins in southern Mexico,
had come apart and had to be repaired, Alvarez said.

   President Bush's savings and loan bailout is on
its way to a vote in the House over loud but lonely objections from
a few members trying to delete provisions benefiting special
interests.
   Lobbyists for S&amp;Ls and other companies affected by the
legislation have swarmed around the capitol for months and the
732-page bill shows the results in provisions inserted by House
committees to benefit specific firms.
   ``There's pork in there,'' warned Rep. Robert Walker, R-Pa., just
before the House voted 330-95 to adopt rules of debate that will
preclude any consideration of an amendment knocking special-interest
sections from the bill.
   Democrats voted 237-17 to adopt debate procedures crafted by the
Democratic-controlled Rules Committee, while Republicans voted more
narrowly, 93-78, in favor of the rules.
   Walker ticked off a list of companies that succeeded in winning
concessions, including such well-known names as Sears, Roebuck &amp;
Co.; Merrill Lynch, and Chemical Bank.
   One section, according to Walker, exempts Columbia Savings and
Loan Association in Beverly Hills, Calif., from a provision that
would force it to sell off much of its junk bond portfolio, the
largest of any S&amp;L in the nation.
   ``This is wrong. ... This is the Congress of the United States at
its worst,'' complained Rep. Tim Valentine, D-N.C.
   Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, one of the thrift industry's sharpest
critics, pleaded to no avail with Democrats to permit debate of his
amendments, including one to exclude special-interest provisions.
   ``At issue is whether the party of reform in the 1970s has become
the party of the status quo in the 1980s,'' he said. ``... Allow the
reform sentiments of this House to be unshackled.''
   By far the most heavily lobbied part of the bill is a provision
Bush calls the key reform. It would force S&amp;L owners to risk more of
their own money, providing a thicker cushion between loss and the
government deposit insurance fund.
   More than 700 S&amp;Ls are pushing for an accounting break that would
allow many of them to avoid risking any of their own money. Earlier
in the 1980s, regulators granted the accounting break, known as
supervisory good will, to institutions willing to take ailing S&amp;Ls
off the government's hands.
   Rep. James H. Quillen, R-Tenn., has become the industry's
spokesman on the issue. He sported an S&amp;L button on the floor of the
House, reading ``A Deal is a Deal'' and repeated the slogan during
debate.
   The good will institutions lost a series of close votes in House
committees and the bill, as it goes to the floor, forces them to
give up the accounting break in five years.
   However, they'll get another chance. Although the House-adopted
rule fails to permit debate on either Leach's anti-special interest
amendment or another toughening capital requirements even further,
it permits a vote on a Quillen provision allowing S&amp;Ls to keep their
good will for as long as 40 years.
   In case that fails, a vote on another amendment, sponsored by
Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., will be allowed. It would allow S&amp;Ls to
delay having to meet tougher standards for up to 18 months.
   Although the lobbying firepower is tilted heavily in favor of
S&amp;Ls, a few groups are working to bolster the other side.
   Peggy Miller of the Consumer Federation of America was in the
Capitol Wednesday trying to counter the industry's efforts by
handing around a bright pink sheet similar to the slate cards
distributed at polling places by political parties. It listed the
amendments to be debated by the House this week and, for each,
instructed in capital letters ``VOTE YES'' or ``VOTE NO.''

   Rescuers worked to recover the last four
bodies Wednesday from a remote Hawaii Island valley where a tour
airplane crashed, killing 11 people.
   The Scenic Air Tours Hawaii plane slammed into an 1,800-foot high
wall Sunday afternoon at the back of Waipio Valley. There were no
survivors.
   The twin-engine Beechcraft was on a flight from Hilo Airport on
Hawaii Island to Kahului on the island of Maui.
   A three-member National Transportation Safety Board team was to
travel to Hawaii Island to meet with officials in charge of recovery
effort, said Bruce Butts, operations officer for the Hawaii County
Civil Defense Agency.
   Barry Trotter, leader of the NTSB team, said that in addition to
examining the crash site the team would investigate Scenic Air
Tours' crew training procedures and how the company selects its
pilots.
   The plane's pilot, Pascal Meric, 28, of Honolulu, had about 4,000
hours flying experience, said Doug Rogers, chief pilot for Scenic
Air Tours. The crash was the first in the company's nine-year
history.
   Rescue workers descended on ropes from a helicopter to recover
seven bodies Tuesday. Those remains were found upslope from the main
portion of wreckage.
   ``The remains of the others, from what I understand, are in and
around the main wreckage itself, and that wreckage is hanging
precariously on the side of a steep valley wall,'' Butts said.
   Butts said Civil Defense officials, firefighters and national
park rangers were trying to minimize the risk to rescue workers
working to recover the remaining bodies.
   The twin-engine Beechcraft struck a sheer valley wall, and its
wreckage cut a 300-foot-long, fire-scarred swath as it slid downhill
through thick vegetation.
   Hawaii County Police Chief Victor Vierra, who visited the crash
site Tuesday, said the impact left a burn mark ``that was the
perfect outline of the aircraft.''
   The seven bodies were taken to Hilo Hospital, where work was to
begin on identification, Butts said.
   Scenic Air Tours on Wednesday released the name of a ninth
passenger: Delphine Clemenz of Torrance, Calif.
   Eight other passengers were identified as Peter Spillane and Ann
Herbert, both of Sydney, Australia; Jack Merle and Shirley Merle of
Russellville, Ark.; Mary Statler of Blue Mound, Ill.; Sylvie Martel
and Nicole Beland of Canada; and Robert Wren, 61, an English
professor at the University of Houston.
   The name of a New York City woman was being withheld pending
notification of relatives, according to company owner Doris Tom.

<TEXT>
   Citizens of the Baltic republics annexed by the
Soviet Union in 1940 held memorial rallies Wednesday for thousands
of countrymen deported by Josef Stalin, and some used the occasion
to speak out for independence.
   Stalin began deporting Estonians, Latvians and Lithuanians on
June 13-14, 1941. Tens of thousands of the Baltic elite were
reported sent to Siberia on those two days alone.
   Amita Upmine, a member of the Latvian People's Front, said
Lithuanian television broadcast a rally at Domsky Square in Riga at
which speakers called for the independence of Latvia.
   Ms. Upmine quoted one speaker, a member of the Helsinki Watch
Group that monitors international human rights accords, as saying:
``Don't listen to the (Communist) Party! Latvia must be sovereign!''
   She said similar demands were made by a leader of her
organization, a grassroots political group.
   A brief report on the observances by Tass, the official Soviet
news agency, called the deportations illegal and said the meetings
were in memory of ``the repressed'' but did not mention calls for
Latvian independence.
   Last week, the executive body of Latvia's legislature declared
the deportations illegal and designated June 14 ``a memorial day for
those repressed under Stalin,'' said Mikhail Bonden, a reporter in
Riga for the Moscow-based dissident journal Express Chronicle.
   Lithuania took similar action, proclaiming June 14 a day of
``mourning and hope'' for the deportees, said Vytautas Bogysis,
father of a Lithuanian activist of the same name.
   An accompanying statement from the government and Lithuanian
Communist Party called the deportations ``genocide,'' Bogysis said
by telephone from Vilnius, capital of the republic.
   In Washington, President Bush said in a proclamation of June 14
as Baltic Freedom Day that ``the undeniable voice of Baltic people
is being heard.'' Congress also has passed a resolution designating
the special day.
   Activists in all three Baltic republics have demanded for years
that Moscow renounce a secret provision of the 1939 Hitler-Stalin
nonagression pact under which the Soviet Union annexed the Baltics.
   Earlier this month, the new Soviet Congress created a commission
to investigate the agreement.
   By admitting it made a deal with Adolf Hitler, the Kremlin would
acknowledge as lies half a century of assertions that the Baltic
states joined the Soviet Union voluntarily.
   Stalin deported large numbers of people, often entire ethnic
groups, from several regions of the Soviet Union as a means of
crushing real or imagined opposition.
   One Western account says 48,000 members of the Baltic elite were
deported on June 13-14, 1941.
   Many more were sent away in subsequent years and most died, with
fewer than 20 percent returning after Stalin's death in 1953. No
confirmed total of deportations is available, but estimates run into
the hundreds of thousands.
   Last month, representatives of People's Fronts of all three
Baltic republics demanded a trial of Soviet officials blamed for the
deportations and associated political killings.
   A People's Front leader in Riga repeated the demand at
Wednesday's rally, demanding that the Kremlin publish a list of
officials responsible for the deportations, Ms. Upmine said.
   In Vilnius, thousands of people attended a memorial Roman
Catholic Mass in Cathedral Square, said the younger Bogysis, a
member of a Helsinki Watch Group. He said bells throughout the
republic tolled at noon.
   Survivors and others marched on Tuesday to a railroad station
near Vilnius from which deportees left the city and many placed
flowers on the tracks, Bogysis said.
   Flags flew at half staff in Tallinn, capital of Estonia, and a
memorial concert was held at City Hall, said Tonis Avikson of the
Estonian People's Front. Mourners in Tartu, Estonia, laid the
foundation of a monument at a railroad station, he said.

   Vietnam has agreed to reopen talks with U.S.
officials on allowing political prisoners and their families to
emigrate to the United States, the State Department said Wednesday.
   The department said it welcomed the Vietnamese decision. The
talks were suspended last August.
   Vietnam made its intentions known in Geneva during a meeting
between Hanoi's foreign minister, Nguyen Co Thach, and two State
Department officials. No date was set for the resumption of the
discussions.
   At issue is the fate of Vietnamese who were closely identified
with the U.S.-backed government in Saigon, which was defeated by
North Vietnamese forces in 1975. Many have been detained in
re-education centers.
   Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger alluded to the
problem in a speech to the International Conference on Indochinese
Refugees in Geneva on Tuesday.
   He said, ``The world looks to Vietnam to provide full opportunity
for resettlement to those who have been detained in re-education
camps. Nothing the Socialist Republic of Vietnam could do in this
area would be more favorably received by the United States and the
international community.''

   Rabbi Isaac Jacob Weiss, who led the

Wednesday and 30,000 Orthodox Jews escorted the body to the grave.
He was 88.
   Weiss died of a heart attack at Bikur Holim hospital, the
national news service Itim reported.
   He was revered as a scholar and was head of the ultra-Orthodox
rabbinical court in Jerusalem. He was considered an expert on Jewish
religious law and Israeli rabbinical courts rested on many of his
legal judgments.
   A funeral procession well over a mile long slowly made its way
from the ultra-Orthodox neighborhood of Mea Shearim through Arab
east Jerusalem to the ancient Jewish graveyard on the Mount of
Olives, Israel radio said.
   Weiss was born in 1905 in Dolina, now in the Soviet Union, moved
to Hungary and survived the Nazi Holocaust by escaping to Romania.
   After the war, he was appointed head of the rabbinical court in
Manchester, England. Weiss became head of the Jerusalem
ultra-Orthodox court in 1970.

   Television viewers are happy with their cable
programs, a cable executive said Wednesday in urging Congress not to
impose restrictions willy-nilly on a thriving business in which
viewers ``vote every month with their subscription payments.''
   A Kentucky broadcaster, however, joined an Ohio senator in saying
cable growth could threaten the viability of over-the-air free
television.
   John Malone, president of the nation's largest cable TV company,
Tele-Communications Inc., said the government needs to keep a close
eye on media conglomerates because of their size, and a certain
amount of regulation is ``healthy up to a degree.''
   But in an appearance before a Senate subcommittee that is
studying increased concentration of media ownership, Malone rejected
calls for widespread re-regulation of the cable industry and said
Congress should focus on ``specific abuses,'' if they exist.
   There are a dozen or more bills pending in Congress to impose
pricing and other restraints on an industry that essentially was
deregulated under the 1984 Cable Act.
   Lawmakers have expressed concern over sharply higher rates for
cable service since deregulation and over the prospect of more
sporting events going to pay TV.
   Viewership of free, over-the-air television is down, and cable
companies have consolidated their hold on the television business
through acquisitions and investments in programming services _
so-called horizontal and vertical integration.
   Malone acknowledged that prices have risen since the 1984 Act,
but only because local governments had held prices artificially low
for the 10 previous years.
   Even with higher prices, the number of cable subscribers
increased from about 30 million in 1984 to about 45 million today,
he said. Where there was only one cable programming service in 1975,
HBO, there are expected to be 110 by 1990.
   And except for local news coverage, cable viewers consistently
rate cable programming as more diverse and of higher quality than
broadcast television, Malone said.
   ``The growth of the industry I think shows viewers like what they
see. People vote every month with their subscription payments,''
Malone said.
   He said cable TV has the lowest return on investment of nearly
any business and that TCI has never paid a shareholder dividend.
   But when Sen. Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii, chairman of the
communications subcommittee of the Commerce, Science and
Transportation Committee, asked Malone if he were implying that TCI
was a non-profit enterprise, Malone acknowledged that the company's
stock value had increased nearly 900 times since 1977.
   On behalf of free TV, Fred Paxton, president of WPSD-TV, Paducah,
Ky., warned the senators they could ``expect a firestorm of protest
if your constituents wake up some day to find that virtually the
only desirable services they can get are the one they must pay for.''
   He said broadcasters could be thriving by the end of the century,
or they could be weak sisters to cable and tens of millions of
viewers would not be able to afford television service.
   Under the second scenario he foresaw all TV being delivered by
wire, with a half-dozen large companies _ perhaps the Bell telephone
companies _ owning the systems and holding control over local and
national news programs.
   ``I believe it is a whole chain of events triggered by the
emergence of cable television and its deregulation at the federal
and local levels,'' Paxton said.
   He said today the top 20 cable group owners control nearly 70
percent of all cable subscribers, while in 1985 70 percent were
controlled by 50 group owners.
   One of the cable industry's most outspoken critics, Sen. Howard
Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, told the subcommittee that Congress must act to
rein in cable ``before it is too late'' because competition
gradually is being eliminated.
   He said cable TV's prices have ``increased more than any other
single product'' since 1987, and cable companies that produce
programs now are denying those programs to competing delivery
services such as wireless (microwave) cable and satellites.
   He said the proposed merger of Time Inc. and Warner
Communications, which would create the world's largest media
concern, would mean less programming for consumers.

   From Rockefeller Center to Corn Dog on a Stick,
from Yakima, Wash., to Chattanooga, Tenn., the workers in
minimum-wage jobs have the same message for President Bush: $3.35 an
hour is not enough.
   ``That's why New York City has so many homeless: People work hard
and they can't even afford the rent,'' said Amy Hanne, 27, of
Brooklyn, a Rockefeller Center security guard in Manhattan.
   Patricia Zaradic, manager of Corn Dog on a Stick at the Nittany
Mall in State College, about five miles east of Penn State
University's main campus, said, ``It's places like this that raising
the minimum wage would be a big help to a lot of people.''
   Ms. Hanne and Ms. Zaradic were among workers and managers queried
by The Associated Press after Bush's veto of a measure to raise the
current $3.35 hourly minimum to $4.55. The House failed to override
the veto Wednesday.
   Mike Farr, assistant manager of the Off the Record record store
in Yakima, said that although he makes more than the minimum wage an
increase would be ``significant for me. I think it would make the
manager have to move me up to maybe 55 cents over what I'm making
now.''
   Washington is one of several states where the minimum is already
higher than the federal law. Washington's is $3.85, and employees at
the record store start at $4.
   In states such as Washington, Maine and Massachusetts, the AP
survey turned up few establishments that said they were paying the
minimum wage.
   In Boston, restaurants are advertising for employees at $6 or $7
an hour and dishwashers in Chinatown start at $5, according to a
restaurant owner.
   In Chattanooga, however, Linda Gilliam, 43, a grandmother who
works at a Krystal fast-food restaurant and recently got a 10-cent
raise to $4.10 an hour, said, ``You get these ladies that don't have
a good education who come in and they're divorced and have children.
Three-thirty-five an hour. Then they have to go on welfare or food
stamps to help with that, and that's pitiful.''
   Raymond Alian, who owns and manages an Oklahoma City taco
restaurant, said he was glad Bush vetoed the bill.
   ``It would be the people that would hurt, the whole country,''
Alian said. ``This cost is going to be passed on to the people.''
   Alian said he pays his employees $3.50 an hour.
   Jamie Arndt, 21, a University of Minnesota student, said a raise
of $1.20 an hour ``would make a difference, but not a lot of
difference.'' She said tips about double her minimum-wage pay at the
Gingham Kitchen, a tiny neighborhood restaurant in Minneapolis.
   Ms. Arndt also cautioned that a higher minimum might hurt. ``A
lot of employers are stingy and they'll try to get by with the least
amount of workers. It will cause a situation in the workplace where
the workers will be overworked and they'll quit.''
   Kate O'Donnell, 57, a sales clerk at Jenney Lee Bakery in
downtown Pittsburgh, however, said the extra money could make a big
difference to some.
   ``Who can live on $3.35 an hour?'' Ms. O'Donnell asked. ``Even a
couple of bucks would make a big difference when you don't have it.
It all helps.''
   In State College, Nancy Silks said she would have to close one of
her three pet stores and reduce the staff at another if the raise
went into effect. As canaries chirped in the background, Ms. Silks
said, ``Ends are hard enough to meet as it is for a small business
anyway.''
   But Suzanne Gowan, manager of a Burger King restaurant in Newark,
N.J., said a higher wage would limit turnover and attract older
workers.
   ``We get applications from kids 15 and 16 years old, but we need
18-year-olds and older for the night crews,'' she said.
   Vera Kelly, 49, of Queens, who works behind the lunch counter at
Lamston's, a five and ten cents store, in Manhattan, said even $4.55
``still wouldn't support a family. It should be even more than
that.''
   She doubted employers would be forced to lay off people if the
minimum were raised.
   ``You got to have help,'' said Mrs. Kelley. ``You can't cut back
but so far.''

   Vice President Dan Quayle wrapped up his blitz
through Central America on Wednesday, declaring he had forged a
consensus among the region's democracies behind U.S. opposition to
Nicaragua's leftist government and the rule of Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega in Panama.
   Quayle said the U.S.-backed governments of Costa Rica, El
Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras agreed with the Bush administration
stance as regards Nicaragua and Panama. But he conceded that no new
plans had been laid to accomplish U.S. objectives.
   Still, Quayle told reporters traveling home with him on Air Force
Two that he felt his three-day trip had heightened political
pressure on Noriega to step down and on the leftist Nicaragua
government to change its ways.
   Of his one-on-one meetings with the four Central American
presidents, Quayle said:
   `It was very important for them to see my deep convictions about
Nicaragua and Panama. I was very emphatic, very direct and I left no
wiggle room about where the United States was coming from.''
   `What we were able to do is develop ... a genuine consensus on
our strategy on two very important countries.''
   Officials traveling with Quayle said there was general agreement
by the presidents that if an ongoing Organization of American States
mediating effort fails to convince Noreiga to step down, there will
likely be calls for new, unspecified steps against him.
   One official, talking to reporters on the condition of anonymity,
predicted that Latin leaders, acting outside the OAS, would consider
acting jointly against Noriega if the OAS fails to achieve a
solution by the July 19 deadline it has set for its mediation team.
   In the meantime, the U.S. allies are expected to move further in
the political arena, the official said, adding also that Costa Rica
was preparing for the possibility of cutting diplomatic relations
and trade arrangements with Panama if the OAS effort fails.
   The official also said that Cuba was willing to accept Noriega
should he leave Panama, and that administration officials believe
Spain, Venezuela and the Dominican Republic would also take him.
   One enticement for Noriega to step down might be the assurance of
going to a country that has no extradition treaty with the United
States, such as Cuba, so he could avoid having to face drug
trafficking charges in a Florida indictment. President Bush has said
he would not consider dropping the indictment.
   At a San Jose news conference before he left Wednesday for
Washington, Quayle was joined by President Oscar Arias in denouncing
the Sandinista government of Nicaragua for failing to put in place a
structure for free elections next February.
   Under current legislation enacted to govern the election,
``having a fair and open election ... is not possible,'' said Arias.
``With their law on the media, it is impossible,'' he said in
reference to the election law that critics say gives opposition
candidates a disadvantage in terms of media access.
   The Sandinistas ``will have to meet at least a minimum standard
so as to be considered legitimate,'' in their election, he said.
   Quayle said that in his talks throughout the region he found
agreement that Nicaragua is violating terms of the regional
Esquipulas II peace accord signed in 1987 by the five Central
American presidents.

<HEAD>Bush Remains Committed to Affirmative Action</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The White House said Wednesday that President
Bush remains committed to affirmative action programs despite recent
Supreme Court decisions viewed as a setback to helping women and
minorities overcome bias.
   Keeping some distance from the high court rulings, spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater said the cases were still being reviewed by the
Justice Department and ``we have not taken any further position.''
   While promising that the government will abide by the rulings, he
said, ``Nevertheless, the government's policy on affirmative action
remains the same.
   ``The president has spoken out often that he supports affirmative
action in terms of helping blacks and increasing their economic and
social status in this country as well as other minorities,''
Fitzwater said.
   He said ``there are any kinds of mitigating events that occur''
such as Supreme Court rulings, changes in the law and regulatory
decisions.
   ``But the president's basic belief that we should wipe out all
the vestiges of prejudice and racism as it relates to economic
progress remains the same,'' he said.
   On Monday, the court expanded the ability of white men to
challenge court-approved plans giving preferential treatment to
minorities and women in government jobs.
   The court in January ruled that state and local governments
generally may not impose racial quotas for public works projects. On
June 5, the justices erected new barriers for minorities seeking to
prove with statistics that they are relegated to lower paying, less
desirable jobs.
   Asked if Bush would support legislation to bypass the court's
rulings on affirmative action, Fitzwater said, ``We'll have to wait
and see what the reviews indicate ... Right now, we don't have any
proposals to make.''

<HEAD>CPB Proposes National Public TV Summit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which
has been criticized by broadcasters and producers for poor decision
making, political interference and lack of money, on Wednesday
called for a public TV ``summit'' to develop a plan for national
program financing.
   CPB President Donald Ledwig said he had invited participation by
the Public Broadcasting Service and the National Association of
Public Television Stations to develop a program-financing strategy
in preparation for a CPB report that must be submitted to Congress
by Jan. 31, 1990.
   Ledwig made the announcement at the PBS programming and producers
convention in Marco Island, Fla., and said PBS President Bruce
Christensen had accepted his invitation, CPB spokeswoman Jennifer
Grossman said.
   CPB in April released a survey it commissioned in which a
majority of the 80 program producers, public TV station managers and
financing sources interviewed cited three major problem areas: a
need for more money and new sources of funds; a need for better
vision, leadership and coordination; and a need to eliminate
industry infighting and political interference.
   Grossman said CPB had not been surprised by the survey's findings.
   ``When we began our study, we designed it specifically to
pinpoint problems,'' she said. ``I don't think it's fair to say the
study pinpointed problems that surprised us and now we're reacting
to that.''
   Congress, in the Public Telecommunications Act of 1988, ordered
CPB to submit a plan by next January outlining the best way to fund
national public TV programming.
   If Congress accepts the plan, it would go into effect in October
1990.

<TEXT>
   Scores of soldiers from a U.S. Army
construction battalion arrived Wednesday to build the world's
highest airport, near the mining city of Potosi.
   The 160 men joined 90 troopers who arrived in the last few days
with heavy equipment with which to level a hill and extend the
runway at Potosi, 345 miles southeast of La Paz. The hill at the end
of the runway limits the size of aircraft that can land at Potosi.
   Marxist political parties claim the United States plans to
establish a forward base for operations in South America, but the
U.S. Embassy says the only purpose is to build the airport 13,500
feet above sea level in the Andes.
   The soldiers are from the Southern Command in Panama, U.S.
military headquarters for Latin America, and will be here about
three months, returning next year to finish the work, Information
Minister Herman Antelo said.
   In 1650, Potosi was the largest city in the Americas, with a
population of 160,000, renowned for its silver mines, magnificent
colonial architecture and churches glistening with gold.
   It still depends on mining, but depletion of the silver and tin
deposits have made it a poor city of 113,000.
   ``Potosi needed this done, in the hope of expanding its tourist
trade and providing more jobs and revenue to the area,'' said Bruce
Wharton, the embassy information officer.
   ``At the same time, it provides U.S. military engineers the
chance to work at 13,500 feet above sea level and test themselves
and the equipment at that altitude.''

<HEAD>Journalist Says Press Must Counterbalance Concentration Of Power</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By AUSTIN WILSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Concentration of newspaper ownership in fewer
companies is a threat to individual liberty, a Norwegian journalist
said Wednesday, but a U.S. publisher predicted that ``the clock is
not going to be turned back.''
   Gunnar Bodahl-Johansen, secretary of the Norwegian Press
Association, spoke at a working session of the 42nd World Congress
of Newspaper Publishers and the International Federation of
Newspaper Publishers.
   ``In a time with an increasing concentration of power in all
parts of society, and where a diminishing number of companies _ and
persons _ own and manage an increasing part of the public assets, a
free and independent press is of a greater importance than ever
before,'' he said.
   ``Above all, it is the press that must act as a counterbalance to
the concentration of power.
   ``The press is not doing its job in society if it becomes a part
of this power structure,'' he said. ``It is no longer a guarantor of
freedom of speech and pluralism. If individual newspapers become
part of large media monopolies or industrial conglomerates, they may
lose their credibility and legitimacy with their readership.
   ``They may become an instrument for those in power, not an
instrument to monitor their activities.''
   James K. Batten, president and chief executive officer of
Knight-Ridder Inc., responded that group ownership does not
necessarily mean control from afar by people more interested in
profits than community concerns.
   He noted that a survey conducted by the American Society of
Newspaper Editors found a generally positive attitude at newspapers
that were part of chains.
   ``Editors whose papers had been acquired by groups felt strongly
that their newspapers had benefited from the change,'' Batten said.
``They also generally felt free to pursue their own best editorial
and community service instincts without checking those instincts
with their out-of-town owners.''
   ``The clock is not going to be turned back on the concentration
of newspaper ownership. The economic forces that have dictated those
changes are much too powerful, and they will continue to be,'' he
said.
   However, he said, there can be too much of a good thing.
   ``We are hearing a great deal these days about the
internationalization of the media,'' he said. ``Some believe that by
the early years of the 21st century, a handful of global
mega-companies will control the news and entertainment business
worldwide. On that score, I count myself as a watchful skeptic.''
   William B. Ketter of Quincy, Mass., editor of the
90,000-circulation Patriot Ledger, said that four decades ago there
were about 375 group-owned newspapers about even in total
circulation with about 1,200 independently owned papers.
   Today, 143 groups own 1,247 papers with 83 percent of the
country's subscribers, said Ketter, who is chairman of a committee
formed by the American Society of Newspaper Editors to study effects
of media concentration.
   ``The American Society of Newspaper Editors fears that if U.S.
newspapers are suddenly owned by corporations such as Mobil Oil, IBM
or Mitsubishi, the American public and our government may view us as
just another profit-happy business, and the principles of a free
press could suffer,'' he said.

<HEAD>Premier Says Officials Helped Attackers in Uzbek Violence</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov said Wednesday that
government and other officials ``tarnished the party's prestige'' by
providing gasoline, vodka and transport for attackers who killed
Meshki Turks in Soviet Uzbekistan.
   An Interior Ministry official told Tass news agency that some
victims were tortured and their bodies were mutilated in the 10-day
wave of ethnic violence. At least 90 people died. Most victims were
Meshki Turks, a minority of 300,000 people forcibly resettled from
their Soviet Georgia homeland by dictator Josef Stalin in 1944.
   Ryzhkov made his disclosure at a meeting with Communist Party
officials in Andizhan, a regional center northeast of the Fergana
Valley where the arson, shootings and stabbings were committed.
   Tass quoted the Soviet leader as promising the killers and other
attackers will be punished, but ``the communists who tarnished the
party's prestige, the good name of the Uzbek people, bear special
responsibility.''
   Ryzhkov did not name the officials or their titles. But he said
he would like them to see poor conditions at a makeshift camp for
refugees who fled the unrest.
   The weekly Moscow News warned overcrowding and poor sanitation in
the Fergana Valley camp could cause an outbreak of infectious
disease.
   Interior Ministry spokesman Boris Mikhailov told reporters
Tuesday that gangs of extremists, mostly ethnic Uzbeks, burned 548
houses and torched 28 ``buildings of economic importance.''
   Tass on Wednesday quoted an investigator as saying criminals
planned the violence and targeted homes of Meshki Turks for arson.
   ``The tragic events in the Fergana region were well planned and
organized,'' Lt. Gen. V.K. Pankin, an Interior Ministry
investigator, told Tass. ``Houses which were destroyed were studied
carefully long beforehand.''
   He blamed criminals using nationalism as an excuse to create
disorder and destabilization.
   ``Turks were just a pretext for the disturbances,'' Pankin said.
Those responsible, he said, include youths belonging to unofficial
organizations, former police officers dismissed for corruption and a
large number of self-styled intellectuals.
   Tass also quoted Lt. Gen. A. Anikiev, a political officer of the
Interior Ministry, as saying:
   ``There were brutal tortures of the aged and children, violence
against women and sadistic murders of innocent people of Turk, Uzbek
and other nationalities. ... There was even mutilation of bodies.''
   Officials said they began evacuating about 17,000 people from the
refugee camp to Soviet Russia on Tuesday. But Moscow News reported
15,000 people remain, a third of them children, living in deplorable
conditions.
   ``There is the threat of an epidemic. Turks have warned that if
even a single child dies, they will not be responsible for their
actions,'' it said.
   ``Food and wastes are in the water canals and shouts and cries
can be heard everywhere,'' it said.
   Ryzhkov said Tuesday a government commission will examine the
Meshki Turks' request to return to Georgia.

   President Bush, in a proclamation declaring
Baltic Freedom Day, said Wednesday the future for Estonia, Latvia
and Lithuania ``looks brighter today than at any other time'' since
World War II.
   ``The undeniable voice of Baltic people is being heard,'' Bush
said in the proclamation, which follows an earlier congressional
resolution designating June 14 as Baltic Freedom Day.
   The three Baltic states were forcibly annexed by the Soviet Union
in 1940. Bush said the United States will never recognize that
``unilateral incorporation by force of arms.''
   ``Their cultural heritage has been denigrated and suppressed, and
Russification has threatened their survival as distinct ethnic
groups,'' said Bush.
   But, he said, ``half a century of repression has not broken the
spirit of the Baltic peoples. Today their longing and hopes for
liberty remain strong.''
   Hundreds of thousands of Estonians, Latvians and Lithuanians have
taken part in demonstrations ``for freedom and democracy ... for
national autonomy and control over their own affairs,'' said Bush.
   ``The future looks brighter today than at any other time in the
Baltic States' post-war experience,'' said Bush, citing the release
of some political prisoners, restoration of national songs and
languages, and return of church properties.
   ``These are important steps, but justice demands that more be
taken,'' said the president. ``Recent improvements in human rights
practices by the ruling communist countries are not complete, nor
have they been institutionalized.''

   The government Wednesday arrested more student
leaders and supporters of the pro-democracy movement, and it warned
the United States to stop interfering in China's internal affairs.
   It also issued orders to expel two American reporters _ John
Pomfret of The Associated Press and Alan Pessin of the U.S.
government-run Voice of America _ for violating martial law
regulations that banned most news gathering.
   State-run television announced the arrests of two of 21 student
leaders named in a wanted list released Tuesday, and issued a new
circular calling for the arrests of three leaders of an independent
labor union.
   Dozens of people nationwide were shown being led into police
stations, some with their arms wrenched in the air in a posture
called by Chinese ``the airplane position.''
   While the mass arrests continued, the People's Liberation Army
reduced its presence in Beijing and Tiananmen Square was unguarded
by tanks for the first time since the military began cracking down
on the democracy movement 11 days ago.
   Authorities ordered Pomfret and Pessin to leave China within 72
hours.
   The order against Pessin followed a barrage of criticism of VOA
by the official Chinese media as a rumor-monger.
   Pomfret also was accused of having contacts with student leaders
and of obtaining unspecified state secrets.
   Louis D. Boccardi, president and general manager of the AP, said
in New York that he ``protested in the strongest terms to the
Chinese government this unwarranted assault on fair and factual
reporting.''
   In Washington, Chinese Ambassador Hun Xu was summoned to the
State Department and issued a formal protest of the expulsion order.
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said in Washington that
Pomfret and Pessin, were only ``trying to print the truth.''
   Richard Carlson, VOA director, said the action was ``a step
backward for the media in China, which over the past couple of years
has demonstrated some steps forward.''
   The expulsion orders appeared to be part of China's campaign
against the United States for sheltering leading dissident Fang
Lizhi and his wife at the U.S. Embassy after the army opened fire on
pro-democracy protesters June 3-4.
   The military action ended seven weeks of demonstrations by
students and their supporters for a freer society. More than 1,000
people have been arrested since the crackdown began.
   The Communist Party newspaper, the People's Daily, said in a
front-page editorial: ``What kind of people these so-called
`democracy fighters' are and the role that some Americans played is
now all too clear.''
   ``We hope the U.S. side will emphasize the overall situation of
Chinese-American relations ... stop interfering in China's internal
affairs and not do anything to hurt bilateral relations,'' it said.
   Another People's Daily commentary said events showed that ``class
struggle'' continued in China.
   Television reports said two student leaders, Zhou Fengsuo and
Xiong Yan, were arrested. They were among 21 leaders accused of
``inciting and organizing counterrevolutionary rebellion'' whose
names and pictures were flashed repeatedly on TV on Tuesday.
   The reports said Zhou was turned in in Xian by his sister and her
husband, who works at an air force academy there. Zhou, 22, was a
physics student at Qinhua University in Beijing. No details were
given of the arrest of Xiong, 24, a graduate student of law at
Beijing University.
   A Beijing student leader not on the circular, Fang Ke, turned
himself in to police in the central city of Wuhan, the TV report
said. A leader of an independent worker union set up to support the
students was arrested after fleeing to nearby Hebei province, the
report said.
   Beijing Radio said 32 protesters were arrested at the railway
station as they tried to flee Beijing.
   The dozens of tanks that had been in Tiananmen Square disappeared
overnight, and 20 remaining armored personnel carriers were covered
with tarps.
   Tiananmen remained closed to pedestrians and guarded by a
perimeter of martial law soldiers, but traffic now flows on the
streets that surround the 100-yard square.
   Key intersections that had been guarded by soldiers with rifles
also were unguarded, but several banners appeared downtown that
read, ``Respect to the PLA.''
   A Western diplomat said there was no sign any of the troops who
were called into Beijing had left the area. Western experts
variously estimated the troop strength at 150,000 to 300,000.
   The state-run media continued its efforts to convince Chinese
that the army acted only in self-defense and that the worst violence
was committed by citizens who attacked army tanks.
   The official Xinhua News Agency charged that students and workers
distributed knives, iron bars and chains and incited crowds to kill
security forces.
   It said nearly 100 soldiers and police died and that thousands
were injured, while about 100 civilians died and nearly 1,000 were
injured. It did not account for the discrepancy with government
figures issued last week that said nearly 300 people died altogether.
   Chinese witnesses and Western intelligence sources said the death
toll may have been as high as 3,000.
   The U.S. State Department announced Tuesday that it would begin
granting non-immigrant visas to Chinese for short stays in the
United States.
   The U.S. Embassy in Beijing expected a stampede at its visa
office Wednesday but it never happened, apparently because many
Chinese were watched closely by plainclothes police officers. About
200 people gathered outside the office, opened for the first time
since the military crackdown began.
   In Shanghai, the U.S. Consulate was besieged by people seeking
visas to join spouses in the United States. About 200 people
clamored to be let into the consulate after officials handed out the
100 applications that would be accepted Wednesday.

<HEAD>Settlement Reached in Davis Divorce</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rep. Robert Davis, R-Mich., and his wife,
Marty, agreed Wednesday on terms of a divorce, ending a threat of
protracted court action, the congressman said in a statement.
   He said they ``reached an amiable property, child support and
alimony settlement.'' He declined further comment.
   Davis, 56, filed for divorce in April in Otsego County under
Michigan's no-fault divorce law. The law requires a six-month delay
between the filing and divorce, so the earliest the 12-year marriage
could be dissolved would be early October.
   Marty Davis drew attention in 1985 by sending a photograph of
herself in a revealing leotard to a Washington magazine, saying she
did it to show people that not all wives of congressmen are
``cloying Barbie dolls swathed in Ultrasuede.''
   After Davis filed for divorce, his wife, 40, countered with a
support suit in Fairfax County, Va., in which she charged he
``deserted and abandoned'' her.
   Marty Davis said she needed $4,000 a month to support herself and
their 5-year-old daughter. He said he couldn't afford to pay more
until he had paid off $112,000 in joint debts.
   They were separated several times during their marriage.
   After they last split, Davis moved in with a 28-year-old woman,
Brook Ball, who had been hired weeks before on Davis' recommendation
by the House Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee.

<HEAD>Officers Stripped Guns, Sold Police Ammo for Profit, Official Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Police Department delayed investigating
allegations that officers stripped confiscated guns and sold their
parts along with department ammunition at swap meets and gun shows,
a newspaper said Wednesday.
   The matter only came under review after Lt. Jimmie J. Finn, who
once headed the 20-officer firearms and explosives unit, took his
complaint about the unit to the civilian Los Angeles Police
Commission in November 1988, the Los Angeles Times reported.
   Finn, a decorated 23-year police veteran, claimed that his
supervisors refused to investigate his charges in 1987 and 1988 and
instead transferred him to a desk job in the department's research
and planning division, where he still works.
   Police Commission President Robert L. Talcott confirmed
investigators were looking into Finn's charges. ``We are taking them
seriously,'' Talcott said.
   The newspaper quoted two officers, who spoke on condition they
not be identified, as saying they saw evidence that unit members
were selling confiscated gun parts.
   ``I was at one gun show, and there was a table covered with gun
parts,'' said one officer. ``It was evident by the envelopes they
were LAPD confiscations. Somebody was making major bucks.''
   Department officials would not comment on the case, except to say
it was under investigation.
   More than 6,000 confiscated firearms are destroyed each year by
the firearms and explosives unit, which also disposes of bombs found
in the field and test fires confiscated guns for evidence purposes.
   As a cost-saving measure, some guns are stripped and their parts
used to repair the firearms police officers carry on the job.

   ``Five Years Later'' says the title. An evil-looking slime oozes
out of a crack of a Manhattan sidewalk. A baby carriage passes over
the goo and suddenly begins racing through traffic, baby on board.
Obviously, it's a case for _ Ghostbusters.
   But after blowing up that building and being sued by one and all,
they are nearly defunct. One is a TV psychic, one is a college
researcher. The two remaining 'busters are reduced to working kiddie
parties, at which they are roundly booed.
   A promising start for ``Ghostbusters II,'' and the promise holds
for an hour or so. There is a great courtroom scene in which the
ooze turns into a pair of goblins intent on doling out their own
brand of justice.
   The diabolical plot soon develops. A genocidal Carpathian ruler
of several centuries ago seeks a baby to provide him with a new,
malignant life. Directing his plan from a museum portrait, he has
created an underground river of demon-producing slime.
   The entire ``Ghostbusters'' team is back for the replay. Once
again Harold Ramis and Dan Aykroyd have fashioned the script with
great invention, except for the conclusion. With much of Manhattan
covered by the ghostly goop, the solution seems abrupt and
unsatisfying. Anti-slimactic, you might say.
   Hitmaker Ivan Reitman (``Twins'') returns as director-producer
and again he maintains a fine balance between the human and
supernatural actors. He is especially good at handling the repartee
among the four comrades in ghost eradication; it sounds ad lib, and
some of it may be.
   The principals do what you expect of them. Bill Murray is loaded
with sardonic wisecracks (a few too many), Aykroyd is the gung ho
type, Ramis provides an occasional word of wisdom. Too bad that
Ernie Hudson is little more than a token player uninvolved in the
plot.
   Sigourney Weaver is fine in the Fay Wray role. Accountant Rick
Moranis and secretary Annie Potts are back, both wearing glasses as
proof they are dopey. Peter MacNicol virtually steals the picture as
the world-mangling museum curator, Janosz Poha.
   Industrial Light and Magic, with Dennis Muren as visual effects
supervisor, has done some of its best wizardry, particularly in the
devilish ghosts. Randy Edelman's music provides a lively beat
throughout.

<HEAD>Mexico's Former Security Chief Grilled in Journalist's Death</HEAD>

   A former federal security chief linked to
Mexico's most notorious drug runners was seized after a brief
shootout and was grilled on Wednesday about his purported role in
the murder of a crusading reporter.
   Jose Antonio Zorrilla Perez, 47, who was the Mexican equivalent
of FBI director, surrendered after a confrontation with police
outside his home in Mexico City on Tuesday night. No one was hurt.
   He is accused of masterminding the slaying five years ago of
Manuel Buendia, a columnist for the daily Excelsior and author of
hard-hitting books on corruption and illegal sales of drugs and
weapons.
   Buendia was shot in a Mexico City parking garage May 30, 1984.
   Zorrilla has also been linked to the drug traffickers accused in
the 1985 torture-slaying of U.S. drug agent Enrique Camarena Salazar.
   The deputy federal attorney general in charge of narcotics,
Javier Coello Trejo, was at the questioning on Wednesday of Zorrilla
and three other suspects, according to a source at the city attorney
general's office.
   He said the interrogation lasted more than 18 hours.
   ``The triggerman has also been identified. There may be other
arrests soon,'' said the source, who spoke on on anonymity.
   Authorities refused to identify the three other suspects, saying
it could hamper the investigation.
   Criminal Court Judge Roberto Hernandez Martinez issued arrest
warrants after examining 15 volumes of evidence compiled in the
Buendia investigation.
   The business daily El Financiero published exerpts from testimony
taken in the investigation which it said links Zorrilla to Miguel
Angel Felix Gallardo and Rafael Caro Quintero, Mexico's top drug
barons.
   It quoted witnesses as testifying that Zorrilla feared Buendia
would expose Zorrilla connections to the drug trade.
   Mexico City Attorney General Ignacio Morales Lechuga publicly
announced on Sunday night the arrest warrant for Zorrilla, saying
Zorrilla had ordered Buendia's death.
   The government has come under intense pressure to solve the
murder of Buendia, one of 25 journalists slain since 1982.
Suggestions were made of a cover-up involving high government
officials.
   Zorrilla headed the Federal Security Department from 1981 to
mid-1984. Before that he was a congressman and private secretary to
Deputy Interior Secretary Fernando Gutierrez Barrios. Gutierrez
Barrios is now interior secretary, the Cabinet official in charge of
national security.
   The Federal Security Department was dismantled in 1985 because of
corruption in 1985.

   Entertainer Joey Heatherton wept in court
Wednesday as she heatedly denied civil charges that she slapped a
passport office clerk who refused to accept the actress' application.
   Ms. Heatherton claimed that guards at the Rockefeller Center
office almost ruined her career as they dragged her away from the
clerk, Mary Polik, during the July 8, 1985, incident.
   ``They pulled my knee out of its socket,'' Ms. Heatherton, 44,
testified in the trial of a $6 million lawsuit filed against her by
Ms. Polik. ``I said, `Please stop it! I'm a dancer! My leg! It's my
living!' I wanted to get out of there.''
   Ms. Heatherton began sobbing and Justice Irma Vidal Santaella,
hearing the case in trial-level state Supreme Court, ordered a short
recess to allow her to regain her composure.
   Ms. Heatherton was called as Ms. Polik's first witness, a
surprise move that caught the defense off guard. The judge denied a
request by Ms. Heatherton's lawyer, William Kunstler, for a brief
adjournment.
   Ms. Polik, 27, says in her lawsuit that when Ms. Heatherton
approached her window to renew her passport, she told the
singer-dancer-actress that she had the wrong type of passport
photographs and the $35 fee had to be in exact change.
   Ms. Polik says Ms. Heatherton, given special treatment by being
allowed to go ahead of others waiting in line, became enraged
because she couldn't get the business taken care of immediately.
   She said Ms. Heatherton slapped her, pulled out a fistful of her
hair and slammed her head against a plastic partition before
security guards intervened.
   Ms. Polik, who complained of headaches, nausea and blurred vision
after the incident, said she was out of work for 14 months because
of her injuries.
   Ms. Heatherton was acquitted on federal charges of disorderly
conduct and obstructing government administration in the case in
September 1986.
   ```I never touched her,'' Ms. Heatherton said when Ms. Polik's
lawyer, Marie Ng, asked whether the witness had hit the plaintiff.
   Ms. Ng used the word ``battered'' in one of her questions and the
witness replied, ``I never battered anybody in my life.''
   With that, Ms. Ng referred to allegations that Ms. Heatherton had
stabbed her former manager-boyfriend, Gerald Fischer, in Ramapo,
N.Y., in 1985.
   Ms. Heatherton started crying. Kunstler slammed his papers onto a
table and bellowed that Ms. Ng's questioning was ``bad faith and
dirty tactics.'' His objection was sustained, although the judge
warned him to restrain himself.
   A Rockland County grand jury refused to indict Ms. Heatherton in
the alleged stabbing.
   The trial was to resume Friday.

<TEXT>
   A former city policeman known as ``Batman,'' half
of the celebrated ``Batman and Robin'' undercover team, was arrested
Wednesday and charged in a $350,000 insurance scam, federal
authorities said.
   David Greenberg, part of the police duo that made hundreds of
arrests from 1968 to 1972, was charged in federal court in Brooklyn
with forging documents and invoices to cheat an insurance company
after one of his videotape businesses was hit by burglars.
   The law-enforcement exploits of Greenberg and his police partner,
Detective Robert Hantz, known as ``Robin,'' were recounted in the
1973 book and the '74 movie ``The Super Cops.''
   Greenberg quit the Police Department in 1975 and was later
elected to the state Assembly, where he served until he was
convicted in 1978 on federal mail fraud and obstruction charges. He
served 10 months of a two-year sentence.
   Greenberg's brother and business partner, Bruce Greenberg, and
their lawyer, Samuel Konigsberg, were also charged Wednesday.
   According to court papers, after a Dec. 26, 1986, burglary at
Tri-State Video in Brooklyn, the three men fraudulently altered
documents to show that Tri-State had been acquired by another
Greenberg company, Home and Industrial Video of South Lodi, N.J.,
four days before the break-in.
   Under the acquisition, Greenberg argued, Tri-State was covered by
HIV's $500,000 policy with the Chubb Group insurance companies.
   According to the complaint, the Greenbergs inflated the losses,
claiming $350,000 worth of videotapes had been taken.
   Greenberg eventually settled his claim with Chubb for $1,000,
according to the complaint.
   Greenberg, 45, was arrested Wednesday at his home in Bel Air
Beach, Fla., prosecutors said. Bruce Greenberg, 36, of Staten
Island, and Konigsberg, 34, with offices in Manhattan, surrendered.
They were arraigned and freed on $50,000 bond each.
   They are charged with mail fraud and insurance fraud and face 10
years in prison and $500,000 fines each if convicted.
   In 1987, James Brown, 45, a retired policeman who was president
of one of Greenberg's other companies, Video U.S.A., a chain of
video rental stores, was shot to death. The killing has not been
solved. Law-enforcement sources said he was killed shortly before he
was to tell Chubb investigators about the burglary at Tri-State
Video.

<TEXT>
   Putting a different spin on Flag Day, a 7-year-old
atheist Wednesday urged public-school students to refuse to recite
the ``Pledge of Allegiance'' until the words ``under God'' are
excised.
   ``When kids are forced to say, `under God,' it makes them think
that atheists are bad people,'' Ricky Sherman said at a news
conference, reading a statement he wrote on composition paper in
large block letters.
   ``Atheists are good people,'' he said. ``We just know that God is
make believe.''
   Ricky, dressed smartly in a blue blazer, gray-striped shirt,
red-and-blue striped tie and white socks with a picture of Mickey
Mouse at the ankle, then put his right hand over his heart and
recited the pledge without the phrase.
   His father, Rob Sherman, national spokesman for American
Atheists, Inc., stood nearby, beaming.
   ``How can I raise Ricky to be a good little atheist when he's
required to say the words `under God' at the start of each day?''
the elder Sherman asked. He filed a federal lawsuit in October
challenging the constitutionality of an Illinois law requiring
public-school children to recite the pledge.
   Ricky, who just completed first grade at a northwest suburban
public school, does not recite the pledge with his classmates and
Sherman said the boy is frequently taunted.
   ``Tell them what they shout at you on the playground _ `Praise
the Lord,''' Sherman said, prompting his son.
   ``They knock him down on the playground,'' he said. ``But he
doesn't fight back.''
   The pledge first appeared in a Boston magazine, The Youth's
Companion, on Sept. 8, 1892.
   The phrase ``under God'' was inserted in 1954 at the behest of
President Eisenhower, who said that ``in this way we shall
constantly strengthen those spiritual weapons which forever will be
our country's most powerful resource in peace and war.''

<HEAD>Burt Confirmed as Arms Negotiator</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate on Wednesday overwhelmingly approved
the nomination of Ambassador Richard R. Burt to be the chief U.S.
nuclear arms negotiator, rejecting claims by Sen. Jesse Helms,
R-N.C. that Burt is a security risk.
   The vote was 89-10 with Helms and nine other senators voting no.
   Burt, who most recently served as U.S. ambassador to West
Germany, will preside over renewed nuclear missile negotiations with
the Soviet Union, the Strategic Arms Reduction Talks or START talks,
beginning Monday in Geneva.
   In an hour-long debate, Helms, who has delayed action on the
nomination for weeks, contended that the nominee had established ``a
pattern of negligence and repeated violations raising serious
questions of whether Mr. Burt is fit to hold a security clearance.''
   Senior Republicans and Democrats said Helms' allegations could
not be taken seriously.
   ``If my brother had the record Mr. Burt has, I would not vote for
my own brother,'' Helms said. ``Some senators may say he's the
greatest thing since sliced bread, but that seems to me to be
somewhat of a derogation of sliced bread.''
   But other senators, including senior Republicans, said there is
no evidence to prove allegations against the nominee who, they said,
would by his past performance be in a position to serve the United
States with distinction at a crucial and historic juncture of
relations with the Soviet Union.
   ``We have said in the past that it was wrong to pursue
allegations with no evidence to substantiate them,'' said Senate
Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas. ``Rick Burt has undergone
three intensive background investigations and has been confirmed
twice by the Senate for other positions.''
   ``If there is no evidence to back allegations, the president has
the right to his nominee,'' Dole said.
   ``None, none of the allegations, accusations, have risen to the
level'' of being taken seriously, said Sen. Joseph R. Biden, D-Del.,
a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee which voted 16-2
to recommend Burt be confirmed.
   ``In fact, they are all little more than innuendo,'' Biden said.
   ``Here we have an incredibly qualified nominee who is about to
take over a negotiation at one of the most historic moment's of the
nation's history,'' Biden said. ``We need a nominee of Mr. Burt's
insight, intelligence and background.''
   Sen. Orrin G. Hatch, R-Utah, said that he voted in the past
against confirming Burt for other government positions but would
support him now because he has grown on the job and ``proven
himself.''
   ``I have found him honest and forthright,'' Hatch said. ``I think
he is a person of consummate intelligence, ability and capability.''
   Burt, a former reporter for The New York Times, served as
director of the State Department's Bureau of Political Affairs from
1981 to 1983 and as assistant secretary of state for European and
Canadian Affairs from 1983 to 1985, when he became ambassador.
   Helms' allegations included those that Burt had printed allegedly
classified information while working as a reporter; that he had, as
an unmarried government official, dated a reporter who allegedly
printed classified information; that he had once lost a brief case
allegedly containing classified information and that security
officers had discovered a film canister containing marijuana inside
the U.S. embassy in Bonn during Burt's ambassadorship.
   Helms said Burt has said the canister must have been left by a
guest.
   Joining Helms in voting against the nomination were Sens. David
Boren, D-Okla.; Quentin N. Burdick, D-N.D.; Charles E. Grassley,
R-Iowa; Trent Lott, R-Miss.; Connie Mack, R-Fla.; James A. McClure,
R-Idaho; Steve Symms, R-Idaho; Malcolm Wallop, R-Wyo., and William
C. Armstrong, R-Colo.

<HEAD>Security Council Adopts Airline Anti-Terrorism Resolution</HEAD>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States and the Soviet Union
joined with the rest of the Security Council on Wednesday to urge
cooperation in making plastic explosives more detectable as a means
of stopping airline terrorism.
   The council asked all countries to help devise a standard method
of marking plastic or sheet explosives so they can be detected
easily.
   Investigators say plastic explosives were hidden in a cassette
recorder to blow up Pan Am Flight 103 over Scotland in December,
killing 270 people.
   There was no debate on Wednesday's resolution, promoted by the
United States and approved unanimously in the 15-nation council.
   The resolution condemns all acts of unlawful interference with
the security of civil aviation and urges all countries to cooperate
in ``devising and implementing measures to prevent all acts of
terrorism, including those involving explosives.''
   It was the first resolution adopted in June, when the United
States is council chairman for the month. Council resolutions are
considered binding on all 159 U.N. members.
   Five council members have veto power: the United States, the
Soviet Union, China, Britain and France. The other current members
are Algeria, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Ethiopia, Finland, Malaysia,
Nepal, Senegal and Yugoslavia.
   U.S. intelligence sources have suggested Palestinian terrorists
planted the bomb on Flight 103 on behalf of Iran, to avenge the
shooting down of an Iranian jet over the Persian Gulf last July by a
U.S. Navy ship that mistook it for an attacking Iranian warplane.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vietnam has agreed to reopen talks with U.S.
officials on allowing political prisoners and their families to
emigrate to the United States, the State Department said Wednesday.
   The department said it welcomed the Vietnamese decision. The
talks were suspended last August.
   Vietnam made its intentions known in Geneva during a meeting
between Hanoi's foreign minister, Nguyen Co Thach, and two State
Department officials. No date was set for the resumption of the
discussions.
   At issue is the fate of Vietnamese who were closely identified
with the U.S.-backed government in Saigon, which was defeated by
North Vietnamese forces in 1975. Many have been detained in
re-education centers.
   Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger alluded to the
problem in a speech to the International Conference on Indochinese
Refugees in Geneva on Tuesday.
   He said, ``The world looks to Vietnam to provide full opportunity
for resettlement to those who have been detained in re-education
camps. Nothing the Socialist Republic of Vietnam could do in this
area would be more favorably received by the United States and the
international community.''

   Genetic tests are sufficient evidence to justify a
new rape trial for Gary Dotson because the tests show he couldn't
have attacked Cathleen Crowell Webb as he was convicted of doing,
Dotson's attorney said.
   ``The test results conclusively corroborate Cathleen Crowell
Webb's 1985 testimony that the 1977 rape charge was a fabrication
and that Mr. Dotson was arrested, convicted and sentenced for a
crime that never happened,'' attorney Thomas Breen said Tuesday in
asking for a new trial in Circuit Court.
   Dotson was freed on parole in 1985 after Mrs. Webb recanted her
1979 court testimony, but Gov. James R. Thompson refused to pardon
Dotson of the crime. The governor renewed that refusal after Dotson
asked last fall for a pardon based on tests performed by a scientist.
   The scientist, Edward Blake of Forensic Science Associates in
Richmond, Calif., examined Mrs. Webb's semen-stained undergarments
and concluded in August that Dotson couldn't have been among the 5
percent of men whose genetic pattern matched the pattern found in
cells in the stain.
   The stain was a key piece of evidence used to convict Dotson.
   In April, British scientist Alex Jeffreys, a pioneer in genetic
testing with the University of Leicester's genetics department, said
Blake's test proved Dotson innocent.
   ``It is clear that rejection of this evidence by the judiciary
would constitute a gross miscarriage of justice,'' Jeffreys wrote in
a letter to Breen.
   Jeffreys had said earlier the stain was too old to prove Dotson's
guilt or innocence using his own methods.
   Dotson, 32, of south suburban Country Club Hills remains in an
alcoholism treatment center as a condition of his August parole from
prison.
   Since his release in 1985, Dotson has been in a half-dozen
run-ins with the law. He returned to prison in December 1987 and
remained there until August for failing to promply call his parole
officer.

   Chinese students gathered at Vincennes
University on Wednesday to unveil a ``Goddess of Democracy'' statue
honoring their peers killed in Beijing and to stand against the
government's action there.
   ``We cannot find words strong enough to condemn the Chinese
Communist Party,'' said Enoch Poon, 26, a university graduate who
spoke on behalf of the students.
   ``We grieve for those who died, for families who have lost loved
ones, and that China has lost such an elite group of people.''
   An estimated 200 people looked on as Poon thanked Americans for
their ``love, concern and support during this time of turmoil.''
   The Vincennes statue, which stands 16 feet tall on a 6-foot base,
was fashioned after the ``Goddess of Democracy'' built by Chinese
students during demonstrations in Beijing's Tiananmen Square.
   The Tiananmen Square statue, the students' version of the Statue
of Liberty, was destroyed by military troops during the June 3-4
massacre, which Chinese witnesses and Western intelligence say might
have left as many as 3,000 people dead.
   The VU statue was built by the school's art department under the
direction of art professor Andrew Jendrzejewski, who said his first
sketches were made by tracing the image of the Beijing statue on his
television screen.
   Philosophy professor Bernard Verkamp and students, including five
from China, worked on the statue, which took six days to build from
steel, wire and plaster.
   Chang Kui Wu, 37, of Shenzhen came to the United States three
months ago to study at Vincennes, a two-year junior college with
6,000 students, including 10 Chinese who were enrolled for the
spring semester.
   Speaking through an interpreter, he said the statue, which will
stand on campus through Labor Day, represented ``the symbol of the
whole world's fight for freedom and democracy.''

<HEAD>Death Toll from Trans-Siberian Train Explosion Tops 600</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 600 people have died from the mammoth gas
explosion that engulfed two trains on the Trans-Siberian Railroad, a
newspaper reported Wednesday.
   The daily Sotsialisticheskaya Industriya quoted Deputy Prosecutor
Vladimir Kravtsev as saying the bodies of 379 passengers have been
recovered from the site of the June 4 blast in the Ural Mountains.
   In addition, a government commission has declared dead 228 people
who were known to have been aboard the trains but cannot be located.
That increases the toll to 607 dead, compared to a previous official
toll of 400.
   Eight more victims died in the hospital on Tuesday alone, the
newspaper said, leaving 316 people hospitalized in grave condition.
Doctors and medical equipment from several foreign countries have
been sent to help treat victims, most of whom suffered severe burns.
   Kravtsev said 1,284 passengers were aboard the trains when a
spark from the railway's electrical line ignited a highly flammable
mixture of benzine and propane-butane gas leaking from a pipeline a
half-mile away.
   The blast, which occurred about 750 miles southeast of Moscow,
had the force of 10,000 tons of TNT. It blew the trains off the
rails and felled all trees within 2{ miles, Soviet media have said.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and other officials have said
workers in charge of the pipeline noticed a drop in pressure caused
by the leak but increased pressure instead of shutting the line down.

<HEAD>Black Lawyer to be Honored by U.S. Supreme Court</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAVARES, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For 31 years, James Durden has walked a cold
and lonely path as a lawyer in a Southern county once accustomed to
having only one place for a black man in the courtroom: the
defendant's seat.
   On Monday, Durden's dedication in the face of resistance and
humiliation will be honored in a special ceremony at the U.S.
Supreme Court.
   For most of the 31 years since he was admitted to the Florida
Bar, Durden was the only practicing black attorney in central
Florida's Lake County. Even now, the county has only one other black
lawyer, an assistant state attorney.
   Durden is an assistant public defender.
   ``Nobody has seen it as hard as Jimmy Durden has seen it,'' says
his boss, Public Defender Skip Babb. ``He's carried the cross and
the burden virtually by himself for all of these years.''
   Durden, 62, was diagnosed with terminal cancer three years ago.
   When his fellow lawyers and co-workers heard last week that his
condition had worsened, Tavares attorney Richard Boylston wrote each
member of the Supreme Court, explaining Durden's courage and
contributions.
   On Monday, Justice William Brennan called Boylston and asked him
to have Durden in Washington next week. Later, Justices Anthony
Kennedy and Sandra Day O'Connor also called and said they would like
to participate.
   Durden was overcome with emotion when his co-workers told him
Tuesday of the trip to Washington. For the first time since his
diagnosis, he left work early.
   He was too tired and ill to talk to a reporter, but his daughter,
Carolyn, said later, ``We know that he is really happy'' about the
ceremony arranged by members of the Lake County Bar Association.
   Durden has never belabored problems from racism, colleagues say.
   ``Jimmy just doesn't like to talk about those things,'' said
chief assistant public defender Mike Graves. ``He always seems to
want to avoid rehashing what happened in the past. He always wants
to look forward.''

   Cuba revoked permission Wednesday for a plane
carrying 13 Cuban refugees being deported from the United States to
land in Havana, forcing the plane to return to Alabama, the U.S.
Immigration and Naturalization Service announced.
   The Cubans, among the 125,000 refugees who came to the United
States as part of the 1980 Mariel boatlift, were being sent back to
their homeland under a 1984 program under which Cuba agreed to
accept repatriation.
   Soon after the plane took off at 10:25 a.m. EDT from Birmingham,
Ala., Cuba's Foreign Ministry told the U.S. Interests Section in
Havana that clearance for the plane had been withdrawn, according to
a statement by the INS.
   No reason was given and the State Department is trying to
determine why the clearance was revoked, said a State Department
official.
   ``We can't say if it was for some technical reason or a policy
decision,'' said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The 13 Cubans on the plane had been held at the Federal
Correctional Institution near Talladega, Ala., and were returned to
the prison after their plane reversed course and came back.
   Cuban President Fidel Castro agreed in 1984 to accept 2,746
Mariel Cubans deemed undesirables by the United States. The program
was suspended about a year later, but resumed Dec. 2, 1988 with the
deportation of five who had been convicted of crimes in this country.
   Some 400 Mariel Cubans are on a Justice Department list of people
who might face repatriation, and up to 500 more could be deported
once they finish serving prison or jail terms.

<HEAD>Lawsuit Involving Uranium Plant Goes to Jury</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A jury began deliberations Wednesday in a mock
trial designed to encourage settlement of a $300 million lawsuit
that neighbors filed against the former operator of a government
uranium processing plant.
   The plaintiffs say they have suffered emotional distress and that
property values have fallen because of radioactive contamination
from the Feed Materials Production Center plant at Fernald, 18 miles
northwest of Cincinnati.
   The plant processes uranium for nuclear weapons.
   The U.S. Department of Energy, which owns the plant, says the
claims are groundless.
   The plant was operated from 1951 through 1985 by National Lead of
Ohio Inc.
   Energy Department lawyers contend NLO and its parent company,
National Lead Industries Inc., cannot be held liable because the
companies merely carried out orders of the government, which had
told the operators at times to put priority on production, not
environmental concerns.
   The proceeding is called a summary jury trial. The jury's verdict
will not be legally binding, but if there is no settlement the case
is to go to a real trial Aug. 15. The jury began hearing the case
June 5.
   In closing arguments Tuesday, lawyers for the plaintiffs
described the plant's former operators as polluters who disregarded
their neighbors.
   Stanley Chesley, lawyer for about 14,000 residents claiming
damages because of radioactive contamination from the plant, said
the $300 million in damages the plaintiffs want is warranted.
   ``Obviously, that's a lot of money, but there was a lot of
damage,'' Chesley told the jury. ``Can anybody believe people want
to move near a plant that is leaking radioactive waste? Come on ...
If the shoe fits, they've got to wear it.''
   Energy Department lawyer Henry Gill Jr. said NLO hurt nobody.
   The Energy Department estimates that 383,000 pounds of
radioactive uranium oxide dust has been released from faulty
exhaust-air filters since the plant opened in 1951. Government
lawyers say the material has not endangered residents or harmed
property.
   Chesley said the suit seeks $178 million in punitive damages and
the balance in compensatory payments. He said the $178 million
represents the profit National Lead of Ohio Inc. made during the
time it operated the plant.
   The plant has been operated by Westinghouse Materials Co. of Ohio
since 1986.

<HEAD>10,000 Gallon Oil Spill Fouls Manasquan Inlet</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOWELL TOWNSHIP, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Diesel fuel from a 10,000-gallon
storage tank spilled early Wednesday, killing unknown numbers of
wildlife and threatening to spread down the Manasquan River into an
ocean inlet, officials said.
   Crews used absorbent pads and vacuum trucks to clean up the fuel,
but poor weather prevented authorities from gauging how far the
slick would spread, said Rick Fulton, a spokesman for the state
Department of Environmental Protection.
   Fulton said the tank at Johnathan Green Seed Co. in Howell
Township emptied into Bog Brook after a fuel line was left on
overnight. The tank is used to fuel delivery trucks.
   ``Two miles of Bog Brook are impacted. There is a heavy sheen all
the way down to the Manasquan,'' Fulton said. ``We're still
concentrating on getting a massive amount of oil out of there.''
   Fulton said a small amount of fuel reached the Manasquan River
and workers placed 300 feet of floating boom in Bog Brook to try to
prevent further spreading.
   Police were investigating whether someone tampered with the tank
fuel line. Johnathan Green, owner of the company, notified officials
of the spill.
   Fulton said he expected the cleanup to take several days.
   Authorities were concerned that rain forecast for the next two
days could carry the oil beyond containment booms and into Manasquan
Inlet.
   ``We're trying to avoid the brook breaking loose if the water
gets high,'' Fulton said. ``If that occurs, it will have a
substantial impact on the inlet.''

   Two socialist legislators on Wednesday
nominated Chinese student leader Chai Ling for the 1990 Nobel Peace
Prize as a symbol of the democratic movement in China.
   ``Chai Ling stands as a symbol for the brave, non-violent
struggle for democracy and freedom carried out in China by students,
workers and others,'' Kjellbjoerg Lunde and Tora Houg of Norway's
Socialist Left Party said in nominating Ms. Chai.
   ``In a clear way she speaks out about the values which are
fundamental for a democratic society, against the brutal oppression
by the authorities,'' they said, referring to the Chinese
government's crackdown this month on the pro-democracy movement.
   Ms. Chai, a 22-year-old student enrolled at Beijing Normal
University, is wanted by Chinese authorities and reportedly is in
hiding.
   Nominations for this year's peace prize closed in February and
the winner will be announced in October. About 100 individuals and
organizations were proposed.

   The Chinese government on Wednesday accused two
American reporters of violating martial law restrictions in their
reporting on the pro-democracy movement and ordered both to leave
the country within 72 hours.
   John Pomfret of The Associated Press and Alan Pessin of the
U.S.-government funded Voice of America were the first journalists
ordered expelled under the martial law regulations since China moved
to crush the democracy movement 11 days ago.
   The regulations ban foreign reporters from interviewing student
leaders, taking photographs of troops or covering events around
Tiananmen Square, scene of the military crackdown on June 3-4.
   The government earlier had not strongly enforced the measures,
imposed by Premier Li Peng on May 20.
   Vernon Mann, a reporter for Britain's Independent Television News
was under house arrest Wednesday at his hotel in Chengdu after being
arrested Tuesday while filming burned-out buildings and buses, an
ITN spokesman said.
   ``His passport and papers have been confiscated and he has been
ordered to stay in his hotel and `await punishment,' '' added the
spokesman, who spoke anonymously in keeping with British custom.
   Soldiers detained Denis Hiault, Beijing bureau chief of Agence
France-Presse for an hour on Wednesday and confiscated his residence
card. Hiault was accused of photographing troops.
   Last week in Shanghai, an ITN reporter was deported for covering
demonstrations while on a tourist visa.
   The expulsion orders came as the Chinese media continued to
attack the United States for criticizing the military crackdown and
for giving refuge to dissident Fang Lizhi at the U.S. Embassy.
   The United States formally protested the expulsions. White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said in Washington that Pomfret and
Pessin were only ``trying to print the truth.''
   ``Actions such as this _ the harassment of journalists trying to
do their job and attempts to jam VOA broadcasts _ will not succeed
in keeping the truth about what is going on in China from being
heard in that troubled land or throughout the world,'' he said.
   The official Xinhua News Agency said Wednesday nearly 100
soldiers and police died and thousands were injured in the Beijing
confrontation, while about 100 civilians died and nearly 1,000 were
injured. Government figures last week said nearly 300 people died
altogether.
   According to Western intelligence estimates, up to 3,000 unarmed
people were killed by troops.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said the
administration had no plans to take any reciprocal action against
Chinese journalists in the United States.
   The AP also protested the expulsion order to Chinese authorities.
   ``We deplore and have protested in the strongest terms to the
Chinese government this unwarranted assault on fair and factual
reporting,'' said Louis D. Boccardi, president and general manager
of the AP. ``John Pomfret is a journalist, not a participant, and
even those who have issued this order must surely understand that.''
   Pomfret, 30, said police accused him of meeting with the leaders
of student organizations that led the democracy movement and of
illegally receiving state secrets.
   He said that when he asked for clarification of the charges he
was told: ``You yourself know.''
   Pomfret said he also was accused of giving protection to Wu'er
Kaixi, one of the leading student activists now in hiding. Chinese
authorities have charged Wu'er with counterrevolutionary activities.
   Pomfret, who has worked for the AP since 1986 and has been based
in Beijing since 1988, wrote a profile of Wu'er before the martial
law crackdown and interviewed him several times during the
demonstrations.
   ``I did my job as a journalist and I worked hard. It's a shame
that these are the results I get,'' Pomfret said.
   China's official press has accused the VOA of ``rumor-mongering''
and demanded that it ``immediately stop its disgraceful reporting''
on the military crackdown.
   The VOA is a major source of information for millions of Chinese
seeking details of events not provided by China's tightly controlled
domestic press.
   Pessin, 33, said police accused him of engaging in reporting
aimed at distorting facts, spreading rumors and instigating turmoil
and counterrevolutionary rebellion.
   ``The only motive we have is to tell the truth as best we can,''
Pessin said. ``Governments don't always like that.''
   Richard Carlson, director of the VOA, called Beijing's action ``a
step backward for the media in China, which over the past couple of
years has demonstrated some steps forward.''
   Pomfret and Pessin were the first Beijing-based correspondents
ordered to leave China since American and Japanese reporters were
expelled in 1987 following smaller pro-democracy student
demonstrations.
   Shuitsu Henmi, a reporter for Kyodo News Service, and Lawrence
MacDonald, an American working for AFP, were accused of receiving
state secrets from Chinese sources.
   A New York Times reporter, John Burns, was detained and expelled
from China in 1986 for taking a motorcycle trip through a restricted
rural area of southwestern China.

   When the Internal Revenue Service sent Chad
L. Brenner a refund check for $39,541.55, he had two questions:
   ``Can I get a new bike?'' and ``Can I go outside and play?''
   The federal tax refund check sent to 8-year-old Chad was a
mistake, his father, Floyd, said Tuesday.
   But when Brenner walked into the IRS district office in Wheaton,
Md., to return the money, the receptionist looked at the check,
laughed, then told him to take a number.
   ``I waited about an hour and 15 minutes,'' said Brenner, who owns
a commercial decorating company in Rockville. ``When I showed them
the check, they kind of looked at me, saying, `What's the problem?'''
   Chad was not due a refund after paying taxes of $152 on interest
and dividends last year, his father said. Neither the IRS computer
nor the representative at the district office could offer any
explanation of why the check had been issued, he said.
   The representative offered to take the check, Brenner said, ``but
they were so confused over what had happened that I kept it, until
they tell me what's wrong.''
   IRS spokesman Frank Keith said error made in entering data into
the computer, wrongly crediting payments or misplacing decimal
points can lead to mistakes.
   ``But most are caught at the service center before the check is
actually issued,'' Keith said.
   He said Brenner should return the check for cancellation and get
a receipt.
   Brenner thought the IRS should be more grateful that he was
trying to return the money.
   ``Maybe they see a lot of money come their way, but $39,000 is a
lot of money to me.''

<TEXT>
   Democrats and Republicans on the House Foreign
Affairs Committee reached a compromise Wednesday to make it easier
for President Bush to keep military aid flowing to El Salvador.
   At the same time the committee adopted a provision linking aid
for El Salvador to ending civil rights abuses and a demonstrated
``respect for democracy and the rule of law.''
   The legislation, part of a larger foreign aid bill, would make
available up to $85 million a year in foreign military financing to
the Salvadoran government over the next two years.
   The compromise ended one of the last roadblocks preventing action
on the bill authorizing $11.5 billion in foreign aid over the next
two fiscal years. If Congress approves the bill, the money still
would have to be appropriated by separate legislation.
   The committee was expected to approve the measure Thursday,
paving the way for action by the full House.
   Many members of Congress are suspicious of the newly elected
conservative government of El Salvador, some of whose supporters are
alleged to have taken part in so-called ``death squad'' activities
against leftists and political opponents.
   An initial version of the legislation would have permitted aid to
El Salvador to have been cut off by the vote of any one of four of
the congressional foreign affairs and appropriations committees.
   The compromise would permit a presidential veto of a
congressional decision to cut off aid to El Salvador. A two-thirds
vote of both houses is necessary to override such a veto.
   A 51-page amendment to the bill contains a large number of
specific restrictions on aid to El Salvador and other Latin American
nations.
   Among them is a provision preventing $5 million in aid from being
spent until the Salvadoran government has pursued all efforts to
bring to trial those responsible for the killing of 10 peasants in
September 1988 and has taken certain other steps to prosecute
persons involved in alleged death squad activity.
   The legislation requires President Bush to certify every six
months that the government and armed forces of El Salvador are
seeking a fair political settlement to the fighting in the country
and are taking active steps to end human rights abuses and to bring
to justice those involved in political violence including those
responsible for abductions, torture and murder.

   World Bank officers are meeting with Chinese
officials in Beijing to decide when hundreds of millions of dollars
in Bank-financed development projects in strife-torn China dollars
can continue, the Bank's vice president for Asia said Wednesday.
   Vice President Attila Karaosmanoglu described the talks as ``very

   Security concerns prompted the Bank to withdraw its team from
Beijing two weeks ago, he said. Later, a ``core group'' of the
Beijing resident representative and two officials from Washington
headquarters went to China for the meetings, he added.
   Karaosmanoglu said that in evaluating conditions for proceeding
with development work in China, World Bank officers are not
influenced by te politics of the country and focus on purely
economic considerations and the prospects for carrying out the
approved projects.
   ``At this point it is difficult to make any projection, but ... I

<TEXT>
   Unemployment, poverty and the continuing
emigration of the young weigh heavily on the minds of voters, but
Ireland's general election itself is a major issue in Thursday's
national voting.
   Prime Minister Charles Haughey, who has led four minority
governments, called the election in the hope of winning his first
majority.
   Although analysts say Haughey may succeed, his standing and that
of his Fianna Fail party have dropped in opinion polls since he
announced the election.
   ``I feel perfectly confident that I'll be forming a government on
the 29th of June,'' said Alan Dukes, leader of the opposition Fine
Gael party. There is a two-week lag between the election and the
formation of a new government.
   Haughey, using the colorful idiom that is his hallmark, has said
that Dukes and his ally, the Progressive Democratic Party, won't get
within ``an ass' roar'' of victory.
   Fianna Fail was the first choice of 44 percent of the voters in
the Irish Independent newspaper's final poll published Wednesday,
while Fine Gael was chosen by 28 percent and the Progressive
Democrats by 7 percent.
   Fianna Fail has gained none of the undecided vote from a week
earlier, while Fine Gael was up by 1 percentage point and the
leftist Labor Party was up 2 points.
   Sinn Fein, the legal political wing of the outlawed Irish
Republican Army, was one of several other parties sharing 4 percent
support.
   Ireland's system allows voters to list their preferences in
descending order, and these are shuffled around in a complex
tallying system that makes opinion polls unreliable. It's the second
choices that will likely decide whether Haughey gets his majority.
   The point of this election, early in the third year of Haughey's
five-year term, was to produce a Fianna Fail majority. That may have
been a self-defeating aim.
   Richard Sinnott, a lecturer in politics at University College,
Dublin, said Haughey's supporters among farmers and the middle class
were satisfied to have him restrained by having to cooperate with
other parties. Those supporters, Sinnott said, were annoyed by the
early election.
   Jack Jones, chairman of Market Research Bureau of Ireland, which
conducted polls for the Irish Times, said he had believed all along
that ``the circumstances under which the general election was called
would have a key influence on the voting behavior of quite a number
of people, including the ubiquitous floating voter.''
   Haughey's government, elected in 1987, has presided over a drop
in unemployment from 20 percent to 17.5 percent. He has reduced the
standard tax rate from 35 percent to 32 percent, and has imposed
spending cuts to bring the budget deficit below 5 percent of gross
national product, down from 15 percent within the decade.
   Those gains, however, were made with the support of the Fine Gael
opposition, which had advocated similar policies during its
coalition government with the Labor Party that fell two years ago.
   ``What objective does he see as attainable under a possible
Fianna Fail majority government which would not have been attainable
under the arrangement in the outgoing Dail (parliament)?'' asked the
Irish Times after the election was called.
   ``The countercase against Mr. Haughey's request for a clear
mandate will be that he is better for being held in check,'' it said
in an editorial.
   Fianna Fail won 81 seats in the 166-seat Dail in the 1987
election, just short of a majority. Fine Gael won 50, the
Progressive Democrats 14 and Labor 12. Small parties and
independents won the remainder.
   Ireland has not had a majority government since the Fianna Fail
administration of Jack Lynch left office in 1973. No government has
won two consecutive terms since 1969.
   Appearing on state television Tuesday night, Haughey dismissed
the idea that a fifth minority victory would be the end of a career
in which he has become known as the great survivor.
   ``Aw, I have plenty more years,'' said Haughey, 63. ``I may not
have got a majority but no one else did either.''
   Tuesday's appearance was as close as Haughey came to a debate
with Dukes, the lanky 44-year-old economist who took over Fine Gael
in March 1987 in place of former Prime Minister Garret FitzGerald.
It is Dukes' first election as party leader.
   The 2.4 million voters will also be electing Ireland's 15
representatives in the 518-seat European Parliament, but that
campaign has been all but submerged by the general election.

   Actress Zsa Zsa Gabor was handcuffed
and arrested Wednesday after allegedly slapping a policeman who
pulled over her $215,000 Rolls-Royce for expired license tags.
   Miss Gabor was booked for investigation of evading a policeman,
battery on a policeman, driving without a valid license, driving an
unregistered car and driving with an open alcoholic container,
police Lt. James Smith said.
   She was released Wednesday afternoon on her own recognizance.
   Miss Gabor claimed afterward that she struck the officer in
self-defense.
   ``Lots of people stopped and said, `How can you do that to Zsa
Zsa?' This is not a reason to confiscate a $215,000 car and put
handcuffs on me and make me sit in the street,'' the actress told
The Associated Press.
   ``You just cannot drive a Rolls-Royce in Beverly Hills anymore
because they have it in for you.''
   Miss Gabor's white Rolls-Royce Corniche was pulled over at 1:51
p.m. by a motorcycle officer who noticed the expired registration
stickers on the license plates, Smith said.
   ``He obtained her driver's license and noted that was also
expired,'' Smith said. ``He proceeded to run a check on the license
plate and license and she told him she was in a hurry and she left.''
   The officer, with red lights and siren blaring, chased her for
about two blocks before she pulled over. ``As she stepped out of the
vehicle she slapped him. She slapped him in the face,'' the
lieutenant said.
   The officer, whose name wasn't released, then handcuffed Miss
Gabor and she was placed in a police car for transportation to the
Beverly Hills Police Department. Police also impounded the
Rolls-Royce.
   ``I didn't do a damn thing,'' Miss Gabor said afterward. ``He
bodily dragged me out of the car, then I hit him.''
   Miss Gabor said the officer was abusive and profane. ``This man,
he's not normal or he's on dope or something,'' the Hungarian-born
actress said.
   She also said her hands and arms were severely bruised the
incident. ``I was screaming with pain,'' she said.
   In January, police in Atlanta escorted Miss Gabor off a Delta
Airlines flight after she refused to keep her dogs in travel kennels.

<TEXT>
   Indicted U.S. District Judge Robert Aguilar
temporarily gave up most of his official duties Wednesday to fight
racketeering charges that he improperly used his influence to help
felons.
   The district's chief federal judge said he expects Aguilar's last
major ruling, condemning immigration officers' tactics in Northern
California factory raids, to be set aside in a mistrial because
Aguilar is removing himself from the case.
   Aguilar's ruling earlier this month, a victory for immigrants'
rights groups, ``would not bind the new trial judge,'' U.S. District
Judge William Ingram told reporters. ``He or she would have to hear
the evidence again.''
   Ingram also discussed plans to distribute Aguilar's cases to
other judges, including a doubling of his own caseload.
   Aguilar, 58, a 1980 appointee of President Jimmy Carter and the
only full-time federal judge in San Jose, was named Tuesday in an
eight-count indictment that included the first racketeering charge
ever against a federal judge.
   He was accused of intervening with two other judges to seek
favorable treatment for a former Teamster leader convicted of
embezzlement, and for a former law client of Aguilar's who was
convicted of bank fraud in connection with the sale of a casino.
   The judge was also accused of tipping off a self-styled former
Mafia hitman that his telephone was wiretapped, of communicating
with his former secretary while she was a fugitive, and of advising
a lawyer to lie to the grand jury. The charges against Aguilar are
punishable by a total of 55 years in prison.
   Ingram, chief judge of the Northern District of California, told
reporters that Aguilar was voluntarily removing himself from all
current and future cases until his indictment is resolved. The only
exceptions are a current jury trial in a police brutality suit
against the city of San Jose and a few pending motions in civil
cases.
   Aguilar will retain the title of judge and his $89,500-a-year
salary, Ingram said. A federal judge can be removed from office only
through impeachment by Congress.
   Justice Department spokesman Joseph Krovisky broke the
department's silence on the case Wednesday with a brief statement
denying that the prosecution ``was politically motivated or
vengeful.''
   Lawyers for Aguilar have contended the judge was being targeted
as a minority liberal who has issued several important rulings
against the government.

<TEXT>
   A 24-year-old British model who was the
double of Marilyn Monroe and made her living impersonating the late
film goddess has been found dead in similar circumstances to the
death of the actress 27 years ago.
   When the nude body of Kay Kent was found on her bed late Monday
night in a row house in Chatham, 34 miles southeast of London,
sleeping pills and a half-empty bottle of vodka lay near her.
   Photographs of Miss Monroe were scattered across the bed. The
room was full of stills of the actress, books about her and voice
recordings.
   Miss Monroe's body also was nude and on her bed when it was found
at the actress's bungalow near Hollywood on Aug. 5, 1962, next to an
empty bottle of sleeping tablets.
   The Los Angeles district attorney's office later ruled that the
blonde sex symbol died of an overdose of barbiturates and that the
death was either a suicide or an accident.
   Relatives of Miss Kent said Tuesday they were certain the model
killed herself. She left a note for Dean Hammond, a 28-year-old rock
singer who was her sweetheart from childhood, which began: ``Dear
Dean, I love you so very much.''
   The rest was illegible except for the final ``Love Kay,'' her kin
said.
   Her mother died three months ago and then her relationship with
Hammond ended.
   Miss Kent earned $90,000 a year, mostly from TV and restaurant
and store advertising, by impersonating Miss Monroe.
   Her face was often featured in British tabloids and on television.
   Her brother, Jay, 27, told a reporter: ``She was so involved in
her Marilyn image that she couldn't help herself from dying just
like her idol.
   ``I don't know why she killed herself,'' he said. ``She had
hundreds of people around her. Maybe she died of loneliness.''

scientist saying satellite findings misleading. No Pickup</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fire destroyed nearly 50,000 square
miles of Amazon rain forest last year, wiping out a section of land
roughly the size of Louisiana, according to Brazilian satellite
studies released Wednesday.
   However, Brazil's Space Studies Institute said the amount of
forest cleared by farmers and ranchers was not as great as in 1987,
when 80,000 square miles were destroyed.
   Preliminary results of satellite studies showed that 48,400
square miles were set on fire in the Amazon last year, physicist
Marcos da Costa Pereira said by phone from the institute in Sao Jose
dos Campos, 60 miles northeast of Sao Paulo.
   The burned area comprises about 2.42 percent of the 2 million
square miles that is considered the legal Amazon, which is made up
of the Brazilian states of Amapa, Para, Roraima, Maranhao, Goias,
Acre, Rondonia, Mato Grosso and Amazonia.
   Pereira said about 30 percent to 40 percent of the 48,400 square
miles was either virgin rain forest or savannahs. The remaining area
was land that was burned for the second or third time by cattle
ranchers and farmers getting rid of secondary vegetation that had
grown back.
   In both cases, he added, the centuries-old slash-and-burn
technique was used to clear the land to plant crops and create
pastureland.
   He said it was difficult to say how much of the Amazon rain
forest has been devastated in all, ``but I think it's safe to say
that about 12 percent of the entire area has been destroyed over the
past century.''
   Pereira attributed the decline in burned forest to ``political
and economic factors,'' referring to the international pressure on
Brazil to preserve its rain forest.
   Another scientist at the National Institute of Research on the
Amazon in Manaus said the satellite findings can be misleading even
though he agrees a large portion of the rain forest has been
destroyed by fire.
   ``They overestimate the total amount of legal Amazon area
burned,'' said Philip Fearnside, who estimated 8.4 percent of the
legal Amazon rain forest has been destroyed this century.
   Fearnside said among other things, the satellite used to collect
the data is built to study clouds and oceans.
   He said satellite sensors often are ``saturated'' by heat from
fires, causing the satellite to register a large area being burned
even if the fire is confined to a small area.
   ``But the important thing is that a tremendous area of the rain
forest is being burned,'' Fearnside stressed.
   The Amazon accounts for 30 percent of the world's tropical rain
forests.

<HEAD>City to Gay Men: `Rubber Up for Safety'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new city AIDS prevention advertising campaign
urges men who have sex with each other to ``Rubber Up for Safety''
by using latex condoms.
   ``We recognize that this effort will be viewed as controversial,
and that it will engender powerful responses,'' Health Commissioner
Stephen Joseph said Wednesday. ``But we would rather risk public
rejection than lives.''
   The city's major broadcast network affiliates have refused to air
a campaign video spot in which an actor recalls how he and a male
lover agreed on the importance of using a condom to have ``safer
sex.''
   ``We kept making changes and going back to the stations, but in
the end they just said no,'' said Terry Chabrowe of Cappiello &amp;
Chabrowe, the agency that designed the campaign. ``Nobody's come out
and told us why.''
   Councilman Noach Dear of Brooklyn called the campaign ``an insult
to taxpayers. ... The city should not be involved with pornography
and that's all this ad campaign is.''
   The ad campaign includes 30-second video spots and print ads. In
some of the former, an actor _ white, black or Hispanic, depending
on the spot _ recalls a romantic night with another man.
   The print ads are based on double-entendres such as
``Man-to-Man'' in which the letter ``o'' is represented by a picture
of a rolled-up condom. They feature the ``Rubber Up for Safety''
slogan.
   The videos will be distributed free to bars, movie theaters and
discos. Radio spots also will be distributed. The print ads will
appear on posters and be offered to magazines and newspapers.
Response from the latter ``has not been overwhelming,'' Chabrowe
said.
   AIDS is the third-leading cause of death in the city, after heart
disease and cancer. In men between 30 and 44 and women 25 to 39, it
is the No. 1 killer.

   Television stations affiliated with the Fox
Broadcasting Corp. announced on Wednesday the formation of a new
children's television cooperative.
   The Kids Network, due to deliver its first animated series to the
125 Fox stations in September 1990, will pool the resources of the
Fox stations to produce network-quality programming for children age
2-11, said Mike Fisher, chairman of Fox's affiliate board.
   ``With all the Fox affiliates, we will reach 90 percent of the
country,'' Fisher said. ``I think the best way to think of it is
that Fox is going to be the banker and the affiliates end up owning
the programming.''
   The children's network will operate as its own company, with
profits divided among participating affiliates based on their
audience delivery. Fox Broadcasting Corp. will manage promotion,
marketing and program development.
   The move is aimed to free the Fox stations from the costly
practice of buying children's show from television syndicators. The
Kids Network hopes to produce two hours of children's show daily.
   ``We've got at least the top 5 (children's TV) producers standing
in line wanting to put their best foot forward with quality
programming,'' Fisher said. ``We can become really good
broadcasters.''

<HEAD>Evangelizing Southern Baptists Advance on The Strip</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Leads with 13 grafs to UPDATE with number of marchers, quotes

<UNK>By DAVID BRIGGS ^Associated Press Writer</UNK>
<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 200 Southern Baptists, led by a Hollywood
evangelist carrying a 12-foot-long wooden cross, fanned out
Wednesday along The Strip to give gospel tracts to gamblers,
tourists and casino workers.
   ``We're on the way to Caesar's Palace. We've got another place.
That is God's palace. Let's take people there,'' evangelist Arthur
Blessitt said as he led the Southern Baptists from the Las Vegas
Convention Center to the Strip.
   Blessitt's 9-year-old son, Jerusalem, carried a smaller cross as
he walked beside his father.
   The march down the heart of the nation's gambling capital came
after a conference meeting at the midpoint of the three-day Southern
Baptist Convention that has attracted more than 20,000 people.
   ``We want the world to know we're telling people about Jesus,''
said Jay Strack, president of the Conference of Southern Baptist
Evangelists.
   The evangelists planned to distribute 16,000 Gospel tracts along
The Strip of casinos.
   Blessitt, who carried the 80-pound cross in 109-degree heat, said
the march was ``a symbolic statement that the church has got to
reach into its community to the homeless, the hungry and the
hurting.''
   He led the Southern Baptists two miles down The Strip from the
Stardust Hotel to Caesar's Palace, where they held an impromptu
rally amid the casino's lavish reproductions of Roman statuary.
   ``All I know is it's a long way from Mississippi,'' said Bob
Hill, pastor of Calvary Baptist Church in Cleveland, Miss.
   Some tourists, handed gospel tracts, seemed surprised by the
apparition of evangelists in front of the casinos.
   ``The Methodists don't do it,'' said Thelma Moore. Her husband,
Dwain, said the Baptist evangelists were ``a little too pushy'' for
his taste.
   One tourist from Illinois made a confession of faith outside
Caesar's Palace. Chris Martin of Park Forest, Ill., said he was
riding on the bus and got off out of curiousity when he saw the
Baptists.
   After listening to Blessitt, ``I accepted the Lord,'' Martin
said. Asked if he would continue to gamble, Martin replied with a
smile, ``Sure; oh, yeah.''
   Some Southern Baptists already have revised their opinion of the
city.
   R.B. Chandler, pastor of Mount Airy Baptist Church in Maryland,
said, ``The point-blank truth is that everybody in the world is
either born again or not,'' he said as he carried a handful of New
Testaments. ``The idea is hopefully we would catch some people and
tell them about Christ for the first time.''
   ``Sodom and Gomorrah'' was how George Mitchell, the mayor of a
small town in western Colorado and a member of the Rifle Southern
Baptist Church, envisioned Las Vegas.
   But he said Wednesday he discovered average Las Vegans ``seem to
be all God-fearing people.''
   The decision to meet in the nation's gambling capital evoked
controversy within the 14.8 million-member Protestant denomination,
with some Southern Baptists deciding to stay home rather than bring
their families to a city built on the vices they condemn.
   Leaders within the nation's largest Protestant denomination,
which has pledged to evangelize the world by the turn of the
century, decided to emphasize evangelism at this year's convention.
   ``I embrace the old philosophy, if someone gives you a lemon, you
make lemonade,'' said John B. Wright, chairman of the convention's
Committee on Order of Business.
   A series of revivals were held last week in Las Vegas churches,
and nearly 2,000 people participated in a door-to-door
evangelization effort that led to more than 350 confessions of
faith, church officials said.
   The denomination hopes to start up 12 new churches in Las Vegas.
There are about 22,000 Southern Baptists in 71 churches in Nevada.
   Once one of the nation's fastest-growing churches, more than
doubling in size in the past quarter century, the Southern Baptist
Convention has grown barely more than half a percent in each of the
last two years, the lowest growth rate since 1937.
   In convention business Wednesday, delegates defeated a proposal
to reconsider the convention's $350,000 allocation to the Baptist
Joint Committee on Public Affirs. The vote was 6,034 to 5,198.
   The Washington-based committee has been criticized by
conservatives for lobbying against proposals for school prayer and
tuition tax credits on the grounds they violate Baptists' beliefs in
the separation of church and state.

   A Navy atomic submarine headed home after
filming for the movie ``The Hunt for Red October'' snagged a tugboat
tow cable early Wednesday and sent the tug to the ocean bottom,
officials said.
   Dan Rodriguez and Mike Lynk escaped the sinking tug Barcona and
were rescued unhurt, but a third crewman was still missing despite
an extensive daylong search, said Coast Guard Petty Officer 2nd
Class Elizabeth Neely.
   The missing sailor, whose identity was withheld, may have gone
down with the 73-foot tug, which sank in 2,400 feet of water about
10 miles southwest of Long Beach, officials said.
   ``The tug was pulled down very rapidly,'' said Cmdr. Don Parsons,
who was heading the Coast Guard investigation. ``Everything happened
so fast. It sank in less than a minute.
   ``The survivors didn't get out until the tug was already under
water. The last time anyone saw the missing man was when he was seen
going down to the engine room.''
   The USS Houston was being used this week in the Paramount film
production ``The Hunt for Red October,'' based on a book by Tom
Clancy and starring Sean Connery and Sam Neill. Filming had ended
and there were no actors on the submarine at the time of the 4:43
a.m. accident.
   Attempts to reach Mace Neufeld, producer of ``The Hunt for Red
October,'' and the film's unit publicist, Marsha Robertson, were
unsuccessful.
   The tug, operated by Connelly-Pacific Marine, was towing two
empty barges used to haul rock from Santa Catalina Island to the
mainland for waterfront construction, said the company's president
Ralph Larison.
   The 360-foot submarine was returning to its Point Loma home port
at an unknown depth when it hit the submerged towing cable, said
Petty Officer 2nd Class Vicki Evans, spokeswoman for Commander
Submarine Group 5 in San Diego.
   The fast attack submarine, a San Diego-based nuclear vessel with
a crew of 140, wasn't damaged and surfaced after the accident to
help search for the missing tugboat crewman, the Navy said.
   Five minutes after the tug sank, the tugboat My Way notified the
Coast Guard that it had rescued two men from the sinking vessel,
said Neely.
   Parsons said Rodriguez and Lynk, the surviving crewmembers, were
asleep when the submarine struck the tow cable.
   ``One was awakened by the sudden unusual vibration and movement
of the tug and he ran to the wheelhouse,'' said Parsons. ``The man
on watch in the wheelhouse said he didn't know what the problem was
and he went down to the engine room to investigate. On his way down
he woke the other man.
   ``That was the last time anyone saw him.''
   In addition to the submarine and two other Navy vessels, the
Coast Guard dispatched three cutters, a smaller patrol boat and two
helicopters to hunt for the missing crew member.

<HEAD>Junta Passes Democratic Changes, Pinochet To Call Referendum</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The military junta Wednesday approved a
series of democratic constitutional reforms, including dropping a
ban on Marxism.
   The reforms, to be ratified by referendum, are the product of a
recent agreement between the right-wing military government and
opposition political groups.
   Immediately after the four-man junta approved the changes, the
government said President Augusto Pinochet planned to announce the
referendum's date on Thursday. Officials have said the vote will
take place late July or early August.
   Gen. Fernando Matthei, air force commander and a member of the
junta, said the reforms ``ensure a soft, controlled landing in the
transition back to democracy.''
   Presidential and congressional elections to pick a new civilian
government are planned for Dec. 14. Pinochet, commander of the
powerful army, was obliged to schedule the balloting when he lost a
referendum last year on extending his rule to 1997.
   The change in government is scheduled to take place next March 11.
   The junta, whose members include the chiefs of the navy, air
force and national police and an army representative named by
Pinochet, acts as a legislature in the absence of an elected
congress. Pinochet disbanded congress when he seized power in a
bloody 1973 coup.
   The reforms include replacement of a controversial constitutional
clause that ban Marxism. The new text, the government said, does not
ban ideologies and ``ensures in a better way a responsible political
pluralism.''
   Also changed was the makeup of the future senate. The government
refused to strike a clause authorizing it to appoint nine senators,
but it accepted an increase in the total senate membership to 48, up
from 36, thus reducing the voting power of the non-elected bloc.
   Most legal experts say the constitution bars Pinochet, 73, from
seeking relection. On Wednesday, in an informal dialogue with
reporters, he said he would consider running ``if the people ask me
to do so,'' but he did not elaborate.

<TEXT>
   The American Society of Interior Designers
plans to honor an assistant professor for a study confirming what
most women have long suspected: There are too few toilets in women's
restrooms.
   The study by Sandra Rawls, an assistant professor of housing and
interior design at the University of Missouri-Columbia, ``is not
only commendable for its scholarly research but for its practical
application as well,'' the society said.
   The group plans to present Ms. Rawls with an award in Chicago on
Thursday.
   Ms. Rawls and her research team collected data at four sites: a
highway rest area, a sports arena, an airport and a conference
center.
   They used stopwatches to measure the amount of time that 230
males and 224 females spent in the restrooms. They asked the
subjects to fill out confidential questionnaires telling researchers
the number and type of their activities in the restrooms.
   Ms. Rawls, who conducted the study as a doctoral candidate at
Virginia Tech, found men and women did much the same things in
public restrooms, but women took more time to do it.
   Men spent about the same time in the restroom regardless of the
site, but the mean time spent by women varied from site to site, the
study concluded.
   Women were also more likely to have to stand in line than men did.
   The study found the optimal ratio of urinals to toilet seats in
men's facilities is 2-1, and confirmed that women need more toilets
than men do.

<HEAD>Thunderstorms, Tornadoes Over Nation's Midsection</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: LEADS with 5 grafs to UPDATE with severe storms in Washington,

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>

   Intense thunderstorms developed Wednesday in humid, unstable air
from the central Gulf Coast into the Tennessee and Ohio valleys,
generating tornadoes and rainfall that gave Texas' southern tip its
first good soak since September.
   In Washington, D.C., the worst thunderstorm in the local power
company's 93-history tore through the area, felling hundreds of
trees and blacking out scores of thousands of homes. One person was
reported killed in a traffic accident.
   An estimated 120,000 to 150,000 customers in Washington and
suburban Maryland were left without power, said Kevin Case,
spokesman for Potomac Electric Power Co. Complete restoration would
take several days, he said.
   A severe thunderstorm west of Decatur, Ala., spawned a tornado,
high wind blew a roof off a house south of Hillsboro, trees and
power lines were downed south of Berlin and in Limestone County, and
roofs were blown away elsewhere.
   Another twister touched down in the evening in a rural area about
five miles west of Tiffin, Ohio, knocking down a barn, state police
said.
   The storms produced locally heavy rainfall, including more than
3.5 inches in 4 hours at Baton Rouge, La.
   Showers and thunderstorms had subsided across much of Texas after
a night of heavy rain that pushed creeks out of their banks and
flooded roads. Heavier rainfall during the six hours up to 7 a.m.
CDT, 2.32 inches fell at Longview and 2.18 inches fell at San
Antonio.
   Several days of rain and floods have been blamed for three deaths
in Texas.
   Wednesday brought from one-half to nearly 2 inches of rain to the
southern tip of Texas, the best general rain since Hurricane Gilbert
last September, said Doyle Warren, a regional extension worker at
Weslaco. April and May each normally bring 4 to 5 inches of
rainfall, but this year April brought less than 2 inches, and there
was ``nothing in May,'' he said.
   The combination of cold air aloft and a low pressure system over
southern Wisconsin produced showers across sections of that state,
and produced unusual ``cold air funnel clouds,'' the weather service
said. The short-lived cousins of tornadoes formed near the center of
the low pressure system and touched down briefly in the Madison,
damaging automobiles at Madison and a barn in a nearby town.
   Showers and thunderstorms, some producing heavy rain, also were
scattered over the southern and central Appalachians and the Ohio
Valley. During the six hours up to 2 p.m. EDT, Youngstown, Ohio, got
1.94 inches of rain.
   Elsewhere, showers were scattered ahead of a cold front over the
Pacific Northwest.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 45
degrees at Marquette, Mich., to 108 at Needles, Calif. Wednesday's
low in the 48 contiguous states was 30 at South Lake Tahoe, Calif.
   For Thursday, scattered showers and thunderstorms were forecast
from the northern and middle Atlantic Coast across the Great Lakes,
the Ohio and Tennessee valleys to the central and western Gulf
Coast. Scattered showers and a few thunderstorms were forecast
across the Pacific Northwest.
   Highs in the 60s were predicted from much of the upper and middle
Mississippi Valley across the Great Lakes and the northern half of
the lower Ohio Valley into New England, and along the northern and
central Pacific Coast; in the 90s from the southern Atlantic Coast
states into Florida, and from southwestern Texas into inland
California; above 100 over the desert Southwest, inland valleys of
southern California, and near the Big Bend of the Rio Grande in
Texas; and in the 70s and 80s over the remainder of the nation.

<HEAD>Court To Allow Widow To Testify Without Facing Defendant</HEAD>

<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The widow of Prime Minister Olof Palme
on Wednesday won the right to testify in the murder trial of her
husband without facing the man she has accused of the fatal shooting.
   In an unprecedented decision, the District Court granted a list
of conditions set by Lisbeth Palme for her testimony, including
suspension of all tape recording during her appearance on the stand.
   Mrs. Palme said in a petition to the court it was ``a necessary
precondition'' that she be allowed to testify without the defendant,
Carl Gustaf Christer Pettersson, in the room.
   Mrs. Palme has pointed out Pettersson in a videotaped police
lineup as the man she saw an instant after her husband was shot Feb.
28, 1986. Palme was gunned down as the couple was walking home from
a movie.
   ``There is no reason not to believe Lisbeth Palme when she says
that, from fear and other reasons, she would not be able to tell the
truth if Christer Pettersson is present,'' said presiding judge
Carl-Anton Spak, reading a three-page ruling.
   He said Mrs. Palme may confront the defendant later in the trial.
   Mrs. Palme's unusual demands could undermine her credibility, in
a case in which the prosecution already has suffered repeated
setbacks.
   Mrs. Palme, who had been called to take the stand Wednesday,
declined to come to the courthouse until the tribunal replied to her
conditions. The court said it would reschedule her appearance.
   It also granted her request to close an adjoining press room for
an overflow crowd of journalists, but refused to hold a closed-door
session when she testifies.
   In later testimony Wednesday a convicted bank robber, Harri
Miekkalina, recanted the account he gave police that Pettersson's
hatred for Palme could be a motive for the killing.
   He said Pettersson's grudge was against society and the criminal
authorities, but not against Palme personally. ``I have never seen
him show any hatred toward Palme,'' Miekkalina said.
   He was the third witness to back away from evidence given earlier
to police, as outlined in a 3,000-page indictment prepared by the
prosecution. All were friends of Pettersson with criminal records.

   For a week and a half, Chinese students
gathered in a tiny Washington park to glare at their country's
embassy. The park is deserted now except for a 20-foot-tall Statue
of Liberty, the inspiration of 8-year-old Chelsey Primdahl.
   Over the weekend, 2,000 Chinese students gathered there. They are
gone now _ ``it is final exam time, you know,'' said the policeman
on duty _ but in their place, standing watch, is the statue, a
reminder of the ``Goddess of Democracy'' that the People's
Liberation Army smashed when Tiananmen Square was taken back.
   Anyone looking outside the front windows of the embassy couldn't
help but see it.
   Chelsey, the daughter by an earlier marriage of Washingtonian
James Primdahl, comes up from Richmond, Va., to spend every other
weekend with her dad.

   A federal judge charged with racketeering is
accused of doing favors for acquaintances who are felons, including
going to other judges and seeking favorable treatment for them.
   U.S. District Judge Robert Aguilar is the first federal judge
charged with racketeering and the fourth to be accused of crimes in
the last decade.
   A federal grand jury issued an eight-count indictment Tuesday
against Aguilar, 58, a 1980 appointee of President Carter.
Conviction on the charges is punishable by 55 years in prison and $2
million in fines.
   The grand jury also indicted Abe ``The Trigger'' Chapman, a
self-styled former Mafia hitman and longtime acquaintance of
Aguilar's, and Rudy Tham, a convicted embezzler for whom Aguilar
allegedly interceded.

   Their marriage was made in law school. And
when Morgan Lamb failed his state bar exam, he sent his pregnant
lawyer wife masquerading as a man to take the test for him. She
passed.
   Now, the California Supreme Court is considering whether to
disbar Laura Beth Lamb, who scored ninth highest on the exam, then
was rushed to the hospital to deliver her baby.
   The State Bar says she should be disbarred for undermining the
exam process and foisting on the public an unqualified lawyer, her
ex-husband.
   Her lawyer, Tom Low, implored the court Tuesday to choose a
suspension rather than disbarment. He said his client was an abused
wife who participated in fraud to save her life and the life of her
child.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev, buoyed by an
outpouring of goodwill and a new friendship pact with West Germany,
is calling on the West to support his economic reforms with hard
cash.
   On Tuesday, he appealed for close integration of the West German
and Soviet economies to make the countries' improving relations
``more quake-resistant.''
   Addressing West German business leaders at the Cologne Stock
Exchange, the Soviet president challenged them to invest in large
Soviet projects rather than ``trifles.''
   West Germany is the Soviet Union's largest Western trading
partner, but Gorbachev said the level of trade is small compared to
the possibilities.

   The Amish have little use for the prefab
homes, and the manufacturer loses money when its work force shuts
down the plant for midweek weddings and religious holidays.
   But the two in this northern Indiana community have formed a
union beneficial to each.
   The Amish provide about 60 percent of Holly Park Home's 260
workers, who build homes with utilities and conveniences the Amish
would never have in their own. Holly Park, for its part, willingly
shuts down or slows production to accommodate Amish community life.
   ``They're good, honest, hard-working people,'' said company
president Dave O'Connor. ``They show up every Monday morning without
a hangover.''
   The Amish's religious convictions and culture lead them to live
apart from a secular community that depends on electricity and power
machinery.

<HEAD>A Little Inflation Goes A Long Way</HEAD>

   True or false: After a scary brush with runaway
prices in the 1970s, Americans have had to contend with only
``moderate'' inflation in the 1980s.
   If you already owned your home and had nobody to put through
college during this decade, perhaps you answered ``true.''
   But if you happened to dig through your files and compared what
you paid for, say, car insurance in 1981 against what it costs you
now, you might not be so quick to agree.
   In recent years, the reported increase in the consumer price
index has hovered around 4 percent a year. For the first quarter of
1989, it accelerated to an annual rate of more than 6 percent.
   ``This is not moderate inflation by historical standards, only by
the dismal and more recent experience of the 1970s,'' says Paul
Boltz, financial economist at the investment management firm of T.
Rowe Price Associates, in a just-published report entitled ``What's
An Acceptable Rate of Inflation?''
   ``Even excluding food and energy (an analytical favorite of those
who neither eat, drive, nor heat their homes), the inflation trend
is worrisome,'' Boltz observes.
   Over the last 50 years, he says, there have been four distinct
periods, or ``chapters,'' in the story of inflation in this country.
   From 1939 through 1949, the increase in the cost of living
averaged 5.5 percent. This, Boltz notes, ``was considered
astronomical and only acceptable in the context of fighting a global
war.''
   Then came the ``golden'' era of 1949-69, when the inflation rate
averaged just 2.2 percent. ``For millions of Americans who came of
age, started families and bought homes in this era, 2 percent
inflation was moderate and more or less acceptable,'' Boltz says.
   For the ensuing 15 years, prices surged upward at an average rate
of 7.2 percent a year, nearly tripling in the process. Eventually,
this wave forced the Federal Reserve to take severe countermeasures,
bringing on two recessions at the start of the 1980s.
   ``One of the most disheartening aspects of inflation in the 1970s
was the slowness of the electorate to see its odious consequences,''
Boltz says.
   ``The great middle class benefited so heartily from rising house
prices and virtually indexed wages that recognition of inflation's
heavy burden came slowly. However, the toll finally became apparent.
   ``After the recessions of the early '80s, inflation receded. It
has been near 4 percent during the current economic expansion.
   ``It appears to be headed toward 5 percent this year and, if the
expansion continues next year, to 6 percent or even higher in 1990.
   ``Is this moderate? Acceptable? This is uncomfortably close to
the World War II rate and far above the rate of the golden age.''
   For most of the time since 1939, the American public has been
relatively tolerant of inflation. ``However,'' Boltz notes, ``the
bursts of inflation in the '40s and '70s that lifted the average
were definitely unacceptable to the electorate. Voters supported
grim recessions in the '50s and early '80s to bring inflation into
line.
   ``If 5 percent or 6 percent inflation is now considered
`moderate,' then we have forgotten some of the important lessons of
the 1970s.''

<HEAD>Travel Insurance: Needless Expense Or Vacation Aid?</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   Real estate investor Gail Gass had high hopes for
a recent business trip to Bali, but her journey turned into a
nightmare when she suffered severe head injuries in a car crash
there.
   ``I had hired a driver one day and was just beginning to relax .
.. and the last thing I remember after that was waking up in a
hospital,'' recalled the 38-year-old Santa Fe, Calif., woman, still
recuperating from surgery.
   Gass, who'd hoped to start a business on the exotic Indonesian
island, says her life was saved by a $49 travel insurance policy she
bought on a whim a couple of days before her trip. Without that, she
said, she wouldn't have been able to afford the more than $28,000 in
emergency medical transporation expenses to Singapore, where she
received most of her treatment.
   Few people think about travel disasters like hers. But unforseen
events, from medical emergencies to an airline bankruptcy, can
shatter the best-laid plans.
   Travel insurance can provide financial, as well as emotional,
relief. But chosing the right plan can be confusing, because a
number of companies provide coverage on everything from traffic
delays on the way to the airport to emergency transit from remote
parts of the world.
   Standard packages, which cover the length of a trip, usually
include trip cancellation or interruption, loss of luggage or
personal property, accidental death or dismemberment, medical
coverage and transporation to adequate medical facilities. These
usually start at around $20 and are available through a travel agent
or directly from an insurer.
   Additional coverage can be provided. For instance, $5.50 can buy
you $100 of coverage on lost luggage or for trip cancellation, while
year-long medical insurance for the overseas traveler can cost as
much as $2,000.
   Benefits and costs vary.
   For example, Travel Guard International offers for about $50 a
policy covering one person on a trip of up to a week. Coverage
includes $25,000 accidental death insurance, $5,000 for emergency
assistance, $2,500 for medical expenses and $600 for trip
interruption or cancellation.
   Among the major insurers in the $100 million industry are: Travel
Guard International, based in Stevens Point, Wis., the carrier Gail
Gass used; Access America Inc., of New York; Mutual of Omaha
Tele-Trip Co., of Omaha; The Travelers Cos., of Hartford, Conn.; and
WorldCare Travel Assistance Association Inc., of Washington.
   Travelers should shop around for insurance because conditions,
limits, exclusions and costs vary depending on length of trip and
benefits provided. Some policies specifically exclude coverage if a
tour operator defaults, for instance.
   Experts also recommend that travelers first determine what
insurance they already have before buying more.
   ``If you're a normal traveler you probably have more protection
than you're aware of,'' said John Karanik, a senior vice president
for Atlantic Mutual Insurance Cos. of New York. ``You may need to
purchase less than you think.''
   Some credit-card issuers, for instance, provide life insurance on
flights as well as auto and baggage insurance and legal and medical
referrals abroad during trips paid for with the card.
   Also, most homeowners' or renters' policies usually cover losses
to some degree away from the home. And medical policies _ with
Medicare the noted exception _ are extended for care abroad,
although they don't usually include emergency transporation.
   In addition, a number of auto insurance plans are extended to
rental cars in the United States and Canada, but not in foreign
countries.
   In Mexico, for example, it's wise to buy that country's fairly
inexpensive auto insurance at the border before entering, or risk
going to jail if you end up in an accident.
   Melanie Marsh, a spokesperson for the Health Insurance
Association of America, recommends that when going abroad travelers
pack a couple of health insurance claims forms in their suitcases _
just in case.
   ``You have to make sure the claim forms are filled out before you
leave,'' she said. ``If you only have a bill that may not be enough
for insurance companies to reimburse you.
   ``And don't worry if it's written in a foreign language.''
   Of course, there are some situations where travel insurance might
not help.
   Last summer, Richard and Barbara Seltzer of Boston, had to rush
their 13-year-old son, Bobby, to a state-run children's hospital in
Romania after he suffered an asthma attack while competing in a
worldwide junior chess tournament.
   They were staying in a remote village and the next flight out
wasn't for at least another two weeks, so they had to rely on local
doctors.
   ``I sat there watching the cockroaches crawling in and out of the
drawers where they kept the (medical) instruments. It was scarey,''
said Seltzer. ``Even though it wouldn't have helped here ... I'm
going to take a good hard look at it (insurance) on my next trip.''

   ``Star Trek'' fan J.M. Dillard was temporarily
laid off as an English teacher at American University in Washington,
when she decided to write a novel about the Starship Enterprise and
its crew.
   ``I'd seen some of the other books, and I was a big reader of
science fiction,'' she said, ``and I thought, `Well, why not?' .. .
After I finished it I submitted it to the publisher and heard
nothing for 13 months. I figured that was the end of it.''
   But, one day, Dillard got a telephone call from Pocket Books
informing her that ``Mindshadow'' had been accepted.
   Thus, Dillard became part of one of the most successful series in
publishing history and another extension of the 1960s television
series, which was reincarnated as ``Star Trek: The Next
Generation,'' soon to begin its third year as the most popular
dramatic series in syndication.
   To date, Pocket Books has published more than 60 ``Star Trek''
novels, including four hardbacks, and sold an estimated 18 million
books, according to ``Star Trek'' editor David Stern.
   Every one of the novels published since May 1986 has been on the
New York Times best seller list.
   The books have become as successful as virtually everything else
in the ``Star Trek'' venture. The fifth motion picture, ``Star Trek:
The Final Frontier,'' has just opened, with a box office gross of
$17.4 million in the first weekend.
   Paramount Pictures makes the movies, Paramount Television makes
``Star Trek: The Next Generation,'' and Pocket Books is owned by
Paramount Communications Co.
   ``The current books began when `Star Trek' creator Gene
Roddenberry did the novelization for the first movie, `Star Trek:
The Motion Picture' in 1979,'' said Stern. ``Prior to that, Bantam
Books had published about a dozen `Star Trek' novels.''
   The novelization of the latest movie has just reached the book
stores. It's written by Dillard. She's also the author of the latest
hard-cover novel, ``The Lost Years,'' to be published in the fall.
   ``It's a historical piece,'' said Dillard in a telephone
interview from her home in Florida. ``It fills in the gap between
the end of the Enterprise's first five-year mission, marked by the
cancellation of the 1960s series, and the first movie.
   ``It talks about the Enterprise coming home, how Capt. Kirk lost
command of the Enterprise when he was talked into becoming an
admiral and explains why Spock returned to his home planet of
Vulcan.''
   Dillard, who has now written five ``Star Trek'' books, said she
has a free hand in creating the stories as long as they don't
contradict the established history of the ship and crew.
   Stern said the books are written by science-fiction writers,
writers from other fields, and ``Star Trek'' fans.
   D.C. Fontana, who wrote some of the most popular shows of the
original series, wrote ``Vulcan's Glory.'' The book, published in
February, is still on the best-seller list at two major book store
chains. It brought back Capt. Christopher Pike and ``Number One,''
two characters from the original ``Star Trek'' pilot.
   ``I felt that went into an area no one had ever explored
before,'' said Fontana. ``I'd created Spock's parents in the
original series and this book also took Spock back to Vulcan. `Star
Trek' fans want to know everything about every character.
   ``It's the only `Star Trek' novel I've done so far, because I'm
primarily a screenwriter. But I love the great freedom you have to
tell a story. The characters are good, the relationships are good. I
like doing thought-provoking stories with an action background.''
   Books about Spock are particularly popular and are occasionally
suggested by editors Stern and Kevin Ryan. The first hardback,
``Spock's World,'' written by Diane Duane, came about this way.
   ``We suggest certain stories that for budgetary and other reasons
aren't done in the movie or television series,'' said Stern.
```Spock's World' was a centuries-spanning story of the Planet
Vulcan and some history of Spock. We suggested doing the story that
became `The Lost Years.'''
   In addition to the novels, Pocket Books publishes a wide
selection of non-fiction books about ``Star Trek.'' A revised
edition of ``The Star Trek Compendium,'' by Allan Asherman, is being
published in June.
   Next month, they will publish ``Captain's Log: William Shatner's
Personal Account of the Making of `Star Trek V: The Final
Frontier,''' as told to his daughter, Lisabeth Shatner. Shatner, in
addition to playing Capt. James Kirk, co-wrote the movie and was
director.

<HEAD>World Conference Urges Vigorous Evangelism But Respect For Other
Faiths</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   An international, interdenominational conference sees expanded
openings for religious activity in the world and calls on Christians
everywhere to proclaim ``the good news of God's redeeming love.''
   They also were urged to help those struggling for justice and to
share the Earth's resources equitably.
   These points highlighted the message of the 10th World Conference
on Mission and Evangelism, involving about 700 Christians of most
denominnations in 100 countries, including a 48-member Roman
Catholic contingent.
   Sponsored by the World Council of Churches and held about every
nine years, the weeklong meeting that ended June 1 in San Antonio
was the first of its kind in the United States.
   ``Christ is still suffering in many parts of the world,'' the
conference declared, calling for ``solidarity and action'' in behalf
of those in ``anguish and pain.''
   The conference, which got little attention in the American press
while it was going on, also cited ``signs of renewal,'' particularly
the ``new opportunity for religious expression in many socialist
countries.''
   Without naming those countries, the conference added that the
``Holy, Spirit of Truth, Freedom, Communion and Justice is at work
today in different parts of the world.
   ``Communities and even entire nations, in unexpected ways, are
involved in self-examination, repentance, renewal and struggle for
justice, turning to the living God, stressing the infinite value of
human dignity and turning to one another to make peace.''
   Russian Orthodox Archbishop Makarij of Ivanov-Frankovsk told the
conference that for the first time in 70 years, Soviet Christians
``with great joy can proclaim their faith'' in the streets.
   He said bishops have been guest speakers at schools, universities
and political academies to tell about Christianity and have been
invited to answer questions on popular late-night TV talk shows.
   The conference dealt gingerly with some sensitive subjects, such
as relations to other faiths, and proselytism among denominations,
but praised the advances toward Christian unity.
   ``We confess that we are already one in mission because of what
the living God has done to and for us,'' a section report said.
``Our unity is a reality we cannot undo, even if we wished.
   ``We are given to one another as sisters and brothers in the one
household of God.''
   The sponsoring council includes more than 300 Protestant, Eastern
Orthodox, Anglican and national Catholic denominations totaling more
than 400 million, with Roman Catholics also represented in various
units.
   The Vatican appointed 21 of the Catholic participants at the
conference.
   Despite gains toward unity, the Rev. Eugene Stockwell, United
Methodist head of the council's evangelism commission, called
continuing divisions ``a scandal, pure and simple.''
   Concerning relations with other faiths, a section report points
to the tension, saying:
   ``We are committed to Christ and to unequivocal witness to
salvation in him, yet open to others, even to the possiblity that we
may be enriched through our encounter with them.''
   Bishop Leslie Newbigin, retired head of the Church of South
India, observed:
   ``I cannot communicate who Christ is and what he has done unless
I am willing to listen to other people. Real dialogue requires that
we respect the integrity of the other.''
   The Rev. Christopher Duraisingh, director-designate of the
council's evangelism arm, asked if he considers Christ ``the only
way'' to salvation, said:
   In ``Jesus of Nazareth we have been given decisive knowledge of
the love of God. It is incumbent on me to witness to that, so that
all may come to a saving knowledge of Jesus Christ.'' But ``I don't
want to move from the witness stand to the judge's bench'' and use
that affirmation to judge those who don't make it.
   Concerning proselytism among denominations, a section report said
``evangelism sometimes turns into programs for denominational
aggrandizement.
   ``We believe that evangelism that does not promote good
relationships with other Christians in the community must inevitably
come under question. ... All unhealthy competition in mission work
should be avoided as constituting a distorted form of mission.''
   At the same time, the report says some denominations may become
``ingrown and stagnant'' and in such situations other Christians
``may perhaps be privileged to play a catalytic role in renewal.''
   But they can do so, the report adds, only if they identify with
the other faith group and treat it with sensitivity and respect.
   Several sections emphasized the imperative of siding with the
poor and suffering.
   The Rev. Emilio Castro, council general secretary, said, ``It is
from the starting point of the poor that the fabric of God's kingdom
will be woven.''
   On specific political trouble spots, the conference called for
establishment of an independent Palestinian state, urged withdrawal
of Israel from occupied territories, and recommended witholding of
U.S. aid to Israel until Palestinian rights are achieved.

   Whatever happened to Manuel Noriega?
   Not much so far.
   That question and answer carry a lesson in limits.
   Despite U.S. pressure, despite the dispatch of nearly 2,000
troops to join the 11,000 or so already there, despite help from
other nations in trying to get him out, the Panamanian strongman
remains just that.
   Nearly six weeks after the elections his henchmen disrupted and
then disavowed, Noriega still commands the real power in Panama.
President Bush said he is not giving up the U.S. effort to force
Noriega from power and from the country.
   Inevitably, the crisis atmosphere has eased, other issues have
moved past Panama on the agenda, and Noriega persists.
   The regime he dominates tried to erase the elections after the
fact because he didn't like the outcome. His paramilitary squads
beat opposition candidates bloody, in full view of cameras and
therefore the world. The Organization of American States rebuked him.
   For all that, Noriega could not be quickly ousted.
   The United States and the OAS still are trying.
   But the outrage level is down. The OAS mission returned to Panama
this week, seeking to promote negotiations between the government
and the disenfranchised opposition. The OAS decided its mediators
should have another six weeks to seek a solution.
   Vice President Dan Quayle pressed the U.S. campaign on a trip to
Central America this week. ``Our bottom line is that Noriega must
leave, not only from power, but also it is our position that he
should leave the country,'' he said.
   Last time anybody asked Noriega whether he would resign, he
dismissed the question as stupid.
   The difficulty of achieving that outcome in Panama points to the
reasoning behind President Bush's cautious handling of the situation
in China after the savage crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators
in Beijing. The administration can't write scripts in such crises,
not even in tiny Panama, with the leverage of the canal and the U.S.
garrison.
   The major step in what Bush called a prudent response to the
Chinese army assault on demonstrators was a halt in weapons sales
and exports, despite pressure from some corners for tougher
sanctions.
   Bush said he didn't want a break in U.S. relations with China.
``When you see these kids struggling for democracy and freedom, this
would be a bad time for the United States to withdraw and pull back
and leave them to the devices of a leadership that might decide to
crack down further.''
   That's exactly what the Chinese leadership is doing now, but
there is no practical way for the United States to change it.
   Bush said at his June 8 news conference that China and Panama
both are affected by a worldwide yearning for democracy. ``As you
look around the world and you see change, respect for the election
process, I would simply say Panama is not immune,'' he said. ``We're
all traumatized, and properly ... by the terrible excesses of
Tiananmen Square, and I haven't forgotten the brutal beating of
Guilermo Ford in Panama, and the world hasn't forgotten it.'' Ford
was the opposition candidate for vice president of Panama.
   ``It is my fervent hope that ... the Organization of American
States will stay with their mission and will keep working on their
mandate until Mr. Noriega leaves,'' the president said.
   Noriega, commander of the Panama Defense Forces, was indicted by
two U.S. grand juries last year on drug trafficking charges. The
administration has been trying to get him ousted for nearly 18
months, using economic sanctions, withholding canal revenues and
financing the opposition for the aborted May 7 campaign.
   After the election, Bush suggested that the military kick out the
general. ``I would love to see them get him out,'' the president
said. ``They wouldn't need support from the United States to get rid
of Noriega. He's one man and they have a well-trained force.''
   Bush said again last week that the administration has no quarrel
with the Panama Defense Forces, only with Noriega. Quayle carried
that message on his Central American trip.
   The pressure continues. So, for now, does Noriega.

<HEAD>Jews Visiting German Birthplace Recall Nazi Mistreatment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE BOEHMER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>USINGEN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gerald Gunther, now a leading
American law professor, came back to his birthplace still
remembering the Nazi teacher who regularly called him a ``Jewish
pig'' in the 1930s.
   As dozens of other West German towns and cities have done,
Usingen invited its former Jewish residents back a half-century
after they were driven out by Adolf Hitler.
   Gunther, now one of the foremost U.S. experts on constitutional
law, was born in May 1927 in Usingen, about 20 miles north of
Frankfurt. He started school there in 1933, the same year Hitler
came to power and began the harassment of Jews.
   The Nazi insults, particulary when they came from such an
authority figure as a teacher, left an indelible mark, Gunther said,
but at the same time they inspired him to excel.
   ``I was only 6 when Hitler took over in 1933, and I will never
forget the Nazi teacher who put us in the back corner of the
classroom to separate us from the Germans and called us `Jewish
pigs','' Gunther said in an interview.
   ``Because of this Nazi teacher's passion for drilling us with
dates in German history, such as when German kings were born, I
memorized those dates and was always first with my hand up to answer.
   ``When I did that, he would turn his back on me and say to the
German kids, `How is it that this Jewish pig knows the answers, and
you don't.''
   Gunther stood as he talked in front of Usingen's former
Hugenotten church, built in 1702 as a place of worship but used as a
school from 1823 to 1965.
   ``Ironically, I believe my passion for constitutional law and the
division of power (in government) was born in that school because of
the Nazi insults,'' Gunter said.
   He was born Guenther Gutenstein, the son of Otto and Minna
Gutenstein, and fled to the United States with his parents and
brothers in September, 1938. Many of the 90 Jewish residents of
Usingen had already left.
   After arriving in the United States Gunther learned English and
went on to an engineering college. That was followed by university
law courses, and he graduated second in his class from Harvard Law
School.
   Gunther said he changed his name from Gutenstein ``because my
father felt a non-Jewish sounding name would help me get a job in
engineering. But then I got involved in law.''
   He now teaches law at Stanford University in California, where he
lives.
   Gunther is the author of the college textbook ``Constitutional
Law,'' which is used in nearly every U.S. law school.
   Among those welcoming Gunther and 18 other Jews back to their
hometown were an old German school friend, Mrs. Friedel Preiss.
   ``I always remember him as the cute chubby little guy with curly
black hair,'' she said.
   The hair is thin and gray now, but Gunther repaid Mrs. Preiss'
compliment with a kiss on the cheek as they stood near the site of
Usingen's former synagogue where the visiting Jews laid a wreath.
   Mrs. Preiss said German schoolmates were stunned by what the
Nazis did to drive out their Jewish neighbors and friends.
   ``After they left, we always talked at home about them. We always
wondered if they were OK, and where they were,'' she said.
   Also in the group of former residents was Laura Duering, 65, of
San Francisco. Her family name was Rosenberg.
   Mrs. Duering said her family made apple cider and other fruit
spirits in Usingen, which were delivered to restaurants as distant
as Sachsenhausen, a part of Frankfurt.
   ``We had a German driver, Wilhelm Kolte, who was a very good
friend of the family,'' she said. ``He would take the cider into
Sachsenhausen at night, because it became illegal for restaurants to
deal with Jews.''
   She added that after her family had emigrated to the United
States to escape the Nazis, Kolte was drafted into the German army
and taken prisoner in the Soviet Union.
   ``My family wrote a letter to Soviet officials to convince them
Kolte was not a Nazi, and they later set him free,'' she said.
   ``We were lucky because we could leave,'' Mrs. Duering said. ``My
husband Rudolf escaped too, but his mother and father died in
Auschwitz,'' she said, referring to the notorious Nazi concentration
camp in what is now Poland.
   Stefan Kolb, a local high school teacher, initiated the project
to invite Usingen's former residents back home at the city's
expense. Kolb said he had been working on it since 1980, ``after we
decided to study about what happened to our former Jewish residents
as part of a history class.''
   Usingen has a population of about 10,500. The city allocated mark
equivalent of about $70,000 to bring its former Jewish citizens back
home.
   Many of the group of 19 Jews, from Israel, France and the United
States, were in their 70s and accompanied by their spouses and other
family members for the week-long visit.

<HEAD>U.S.-Chinese Church Ties Seen As Lasting Despite Turmoil</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Through delicate diplomacy, the doors gradually
had opened between American and Chinese Christian leaders, but now a
questionmark hovers over those associations.
   So far, contacts between church officials in the two countries
continued, but seemed increasingly uncertain as China's ruling
regime widened its suppression of democratic impulses.
   In the long run, the situation ``cannot do anything to Chinese
and Western Christian relations except deepen the solidarity,'' says
Cynthia McLean, a specialist in the the China program of the
National Council of Churches.
   ``But in the short run, it may become difficult to keep up
contacts we've had if the situation turns anti-Western and
anti-foreign,'' she added in an interview.
   She said mutual expressions of support during the current crisis,
coupled with accumulated trust developed between American and
Chinese church leaders, would make for a long-range strengthening of
ties.
   But for the moment, she said ``we just don't know'' whether
barriers will go up again. ``It's possible, but we hope not.
   ``We've been in touch with people there on an almost daily basis,
and they tell us to go on saying what we need to say and doing what
we can do. So far they haven't been contacted by political
authorities.''
   Some of the estimated more than 200 Americans sent there by U.S.
churches, mostly English teachers, medical personnel or other
experts, are remaining there, while others are pulling out.
   Several U.S. church leaders sent messages of support and prayers,
and a letter was relayed here from Bishop K. H. Ting, president of
the China Christian Council, expressing shock over the bloodshed.
   ``As far as we can gather,'' he said, ``churches in other cities
than Beijing are carrying on unaffected.'' In Beijing, where the
main slaughter by the military occurred, church attendance was
reported reduced to a fraction.
   ``We all feel strongly that, in whatever we do and say, we must
act responsibly _ to the best interest of the church as God guides
us to see,'' Ting wrote. ``We firmly believe God's justice and
democracy will prevail.''
   He had expressed support for the pro-democratic student
demonstrations before the military crackdown, and still did so
afterward in his letter. He also voiced gratitude for concern
expressed by Christians around the world.
   ``We need your prayers, especially for strength and wisdom at
this difficult time,'' he said.
   The Episcopal Church set up a special ``crisis team'' to monitor
developments in China and frame strategy appropriate to events there
and to meet any requests from the Chinese Christians for material
assistance.
   Episcopal Presiding Bishop Edmond L. Browning wrote Ting, voicing
sorrow at the ``suffering and deaths that have occurred in your
beloved country, and adding:
   ``We pledge to you our solidarity and support. We only await your
word to us of the ways in which we may express concretely our
concern.''
   United Methodist Bishop J. Woodrow Hearn, president of the
denomination's Board of Global Ministries, and its general
secretary, the Rev. Randolph Nugent, also voiced dismay at events
there.
   But they pledged continued ``work with the church in China and
all Chinese of good will, to continually build bridges of lasting
peace, justice, freedom and prosperity.''
   Of the church personnel serving in China, most of the 45 Southern
Baptists either had left or planned to do so, with classes not held
for weeks and the spring term ending, Baptist Press said.
   ``We're leaving it up to the teachers to decide whether they will
come out or not,'' says Britt Towery, Hong Kong representative of
Cooperative Services International, through whom the Southern
Baptists were placed.
   Of 26 teachers and others serving there through the National
Council's China program, only one so far was planning to leave, and
that was because of anxieties of U.S. parents, Ms. McLean said.
   She said the building of interchanges with Chinese Christian
leaders had begun slowly and tentatively on their part at first, but
lately had become a confident working partnership.
   ``It was a step-by-step process, largely involving the
development of trust,'' she said.
   There were only about 700,000 Chinese Protestants and 3 million
Catholics when Communism virtually closed the country in 1949 but
the official Protestant total is now 6 million, with unofficial
estimates of more than 50 million.
   When the West first learned of that immense growth of
Christianity during its underground years, Ms. McLean said, ``It was
a shock.'' It also showed the much smaller results of 100 previous
years of foreign missionary work.
   ``Chinese Christians had to prove themselves as Chinese
Christians,'' she said. ``That's what they've done in the last 35
years. Now they're accepted as a legal religion and not a foreign
religion as it was before 1949.''

   The Supreme Court has let stand a lower court's
decision that prohibits prayers before public high school football
games as unconstitutional.
   The Douglas County, Ga., School District had asked a review of a
decision that banned the pre-game invocations, but the high court
rejected the appeal.
   The school district's plan, providing for prayers led by
students, parents or school staffers ``selected without regard to
religion or the lack of religious beliefs,'' had been upheld by a
disrict court.
   But a federal appeals court said that since Douglas County was
mainly Protestant, the likely result would be ``Protestant Christian
invocations,'' and that violated the First Amendment clause against
establishing religion.

   The Southern Baptist Home Mission Board,
criticized for withdrawing co-sponsorship of an annual
Christian-Jewish workshop, says it intends to continue dialogue with
Jews.
   The Rev. Jerry Lewis, the board's president, said it withdrew
support from the National Workshop on Christian Jewish Relations
late last March because two scheduled Southern Baptist speakers were
considered controversial.
   One of them, the Rev. Nancy Hastings Sehested of Memphis, Tenn.,
accused the board _ which bars employing ordained women _ of
``denigration of women ministers'' and underminding interfaith
dialogue.
   The Rev. George Sheridan, ousted by the board last year as an

covenant with Jews, also accused the board of damaging interfaith
relations.

   A record was set by the first annual appeal for
a retirement fund for elderly priests and nuns of religious orders.
Donations amounted to $25,473,623 _ the highest of any appeal ever.
   The results of the nationwide appeal, made in parishes across the
country last Decmember, were announced by organizations of men's and
women's religious orders and the National Conference of Catholic
Bishops.
   Previous highest amount collected in a single Catholic appeal was
$13.4 million for overseas work in 1985. That was about half the
total given to sustain religious priests and nuns in their later
years.
   The special appeal was undertaken after studies last year showed
many orders lacked retirement funds or pensions for aging members.

<HEAD>Dustin Hoffman and Jack Lemmon Hit London Stage</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT WOLF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dustin Hoffman takes on Shakespeare, Jack Lemmon
plays a soldier and New York hits flood London in the British
capital's most American-dominated theatrical summer in ages.
   There's the familiar eclectic mix of crowd-pleasing comedies
alongside classics, and Anthony Lloyd Webber musicals cheek by jowl
with left-wing drama. But there's more American flavor this year,
perhaps in deference to the country that provides one-quarter of
London's tourists at any one time.
   The Academy Award-winning Hoffman will make both his
Shakespearean and his London stage debut at the Phoenix Theater as
Shylock in ``The Merchant of Venice.''
   Peter Hall's efficient if uninspired production got mixed
reviews, as did the 51-year-old Hoffman, whose portrayal of an idiot
savant in the movie ``Rain Man'' won him an Oscar. But the show is
nonetheless the summer's hottest ticket, with a record advance sale
for a nonmusical of over 1.5 million pounds ($2.35 million), and a
top ticket price of 17 pounds 50 ($27.50), steep by London standards.
   Portia is played by Geraldine James (``The Jewel in the Crown'').
Leigh Lawson (``Tess'') is the merchant, Antonio. It opened June 1,
its limited run through Sept. 2 has been extended three weeks and
there is talk of a Broadway engagement in 1990, if Hoffman is
willing.
   For Jack Lemmon, London must represent a balm of sorts, since it
was here in 1986 that his James Tyrone in Eugene O'Neill's ``Long
Day's Journey Into Night'' found the critical and public approval
that eluded it on Broadway.
   Lemmon, 64, returns to the West End Aug. 23 to star in
``Veteran's Day,'' by American playwright Donald Freed, at the
Theater Royal, Haymarket. Co-starring is Michael Gambon (``The
Singing Detective'').
   From Broadway comes the summer's most eagerly awaited musical:
Jerry Zaks' revival of Cole Porter's 1934 ``Anything Goes,'' which
has been running in New York for 20 months.
   The London version opens July 4 at the Prince Edward Theater,
with Elaine Paige _ the original star of ``Cats,'' ``Chess'' and
``Evita'' _ as the stowaway evangelist Reno Sweeney. Howard
McGillin, an alumnus from the Broadway production, repeats his role
as preppy, peppy Billy Crocker.
   It's Zaks' London directorial debut after winning this year's
Tony Award for best director for ``Lend Me a Tenor.''
   Also in from New York is the long-running off-Broadway hit
``Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune,'' Terrence McNally's
two-character play about romance in Manhattan's Hell's Kitchen.
   Brian Cox, the acclaimed Royal Shakespeare Company actor, and
Julie Walters, who was Rita on stage and screen in ``Educating
Rita,'' comprise the London company, which opened June 14 at the
Comedy Theater.
   ``Frankie and Johnny'' joins other recent New York imports
including David Henry Hwang's ``M. Butterfly'' at the Shaftesbury,
with Anthony Hopkins as the French diplomat and G.G. Goei as his
opera diva mistress, and Robert Harling's ``Steel Magnolias'' at the
Lyric, a slick comedy given depth by its star, Rosemary Harris.
   David Mamet's Broadway hit ``Speed-the-Plow'' returns July 18 to
the repertory at the National Theater with Rebecca Pidgeon.
   ``Steel Magnolias'' co-stars Joely Richardson. Her mother,
Vanessa Redgrave, will be next door at the Apollo through Sept. 2 in
``A Madhouse in Goa,'' an overheated vision of the apocalypse by
American writer Martin Sherman (``Bent'').
   Classier fare includes the Garrick's revival of Noel Coward's
rarely seen ``The Vortex,'' starring Maria Aitken as an English
socialite and Rupert Everett as her dissolute son; Alan Bennett's
``Single Spies'' at the Queen's, two one-act plays about English
traitors; and Iris Murdoch's ``The Black Prince,'' at the Aldwych,
starring Ian McDiarmid as a tax assessor obsessed with ``Hamlet.''
   Alan Bates and Felicity Kendal are on hand in a rare example of
West End repertory, even if both productions _ Anton Chekhov's
``Ivanov'' and Shakespeare's ``Much Ado About Nothing'' (Strand,
through July 17) _ are disappointing in different ways.
   More lowbrow entries are the ever-popular Ray Cooney farce ``Run
for Your Wife'' (Whitehall), a fast flop on Broadway this spring; a
new mystery, ``Over My Dead Body'' (Savoy), with Donald Sinden; and
the perennial ``Mousetrap'' (St. Martin's), now in its 36th year.
   Ron Moody, of ``Oliver!'' fame, plays the celebrated sleuth in
``Sherlock Holmes: The Musical'' (Cambridge), while Jeremy Brett
takes the part in ``The Secret of Sherlock Holmes'' (Wyndham's).
   Mystery fans may also enjoy ``The Woman in Black'' (Fortune), a
two-character adaptation of the Susan Hill novel which combines
old-fashioned chills with a sophisticated cat-and-mouse game
involving the nature of role-playing itself.
   Musical devotees have little to choose from beyond the Lloyd
Webber quartet of ``Cats'' (New London), ``Starlight Express''
(Apollo Victoria), ``The Phantom of the Opera'' (Her Majesty's) and
his newest, ``Aspects of Love'' (Prince of Wales).
   Joe Brooks' ``Metropolis'' (Piccadilly), based on the Fritz Lang
film, earned poor reviews in March for virtually everything but its
set, and must draw a sizable tourist trade to survive the summer.
   The most adventurous fare, typically, can be found at Britain's
two largest government-subsidized venues: the Royal Shakespeare
Company, at the Barbican center, and the National on the South Bank
of the River Thames.
   The RSC this year is mounting more Shakespeare than ever: 14 out
of 27 plays. Highlights include John Wood's poignantly manic
Prospero in ``The Tempest'' and a nine-hour marathon, ``The
Plantagenets,'' that conflates four history plays into three.
   Gene Saks, the veteran Broadway director of many Neil Simon
works, makes his RSC directing debut July 20 with a revival of
George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart's ``The Man Who Came to Dinner,''
starring John Wood as Sheridan Whiteside.
   Highlights at the National include two first-rate productions:
Daniel Day-Lewis is an impulsive and impetuous ``Hamlet,'' and
Henrik Ibsen's ``Hedda Gabler'' features Juliet Stevenson as the
emotionally pent-up general's daughter.
   The theater's International '89 series, which brings companies
from around the world to the playhouse, continues June 22 with the
European bow of the Steppenwolf Theater Company of Chicago's
production of ``The Grapes of Wrath.''
   London stages get an added international boost from July 3-30 in
LIFT '89, the fourth London International Festival of Theater,
boasting 153 events from 14 countries.
   Outside London, head for the RSC's home theater in
Stratford-upon-Avon, Shakespeare's birthplace, and Scotland's
Edinburgh Festival, Aug. 12 _ Sept. 3, which this year is focusing
on Spain.

police chief in this Atlanta suburb last year, the first thing he
did was get rid of the traditional six-shot, .38-caliber revolver.
   ``We've just finished our transition to the 9mm Glock
semiautomatic pistol, which can carry up to 20 rounds,'' Simmons
said. ``Now, we're looking at replacing our shotguns with 9mm
carbines.''
   Simmons isn't alone in beefing up his arsenal. More and more
police departments, big and small, are switching to semiautomatic or
fully automatic weapons. Most of the new weapons fire 9mm bullets,
which are slightly smaller than .38-caliber rounds. But
semiautomatics use clips that hold many more bullets than
traditional police arms.
   Simmons said clip-fed pistols and rifles give the police three
things they badly need to combat today's heavily armed criminals:
more firepower, quicker reloading and greater accuracy over longer
distances.
   Simmons came to Marietta from Palm Bay, Fla., where, he says, his
officers ``were outgunned'' in a 1987 shootout at two shopping
centers with a man carrying a semiautomatic rifle with a 30-round
clip.
   ``Two police officers were among the six people killed,'' he
said. ``It appeared one of our officers was fatally wounded while
trying to reload his empty revolver.''
   Simmons, who said Palm Bay was switching to semiautomatic pistols
at the time of the shootout, now has re-armed three departments in
seven years.
   ``I'm either a leader in the field or a jerk, depending upon your
point of view,'' he said.
   The trend goes against other efforts to ban high-firepower
weapons, such as California's recent law against civilian possession
of the AK-47 assault rifle, and it troubles some law enforcement
officials.
   ``It's true the police are facing ever more dangerous weapons,''
said Hubert Williams, director of the Police Foundation, a law
enforcement think tank in Washington. ``However, the police are part
of the civilian population in this country and, to the degree we
increase the type of arms they bear, they become, to that same
degree, a more military-type police force.''
   Simmons feels much the same.
   ``Ideally, we shouldn't need these new weapons,'' he said. ``But
there are so many semiautomatics on the street these days it would
take years to get rid of them, even if we banned them tomorrow.
Meanwhile, we simply can't afford to let ourselves be outgunned when
the shooting starts.''
   Police SWAT teams have used powerful weapons for years, but it's
the cop on the beat who is getting the new 9mm pistols with names
like Glock, Beretta, Ruger, Sig Sauer and Taurus.
   ``These new `nines' with the funny names are where it's at right
now,'' said Dewey Stokes, president of the 198,000-member Fraternal
Order of Police.
   ``We know that many, many of our members have switched over to
`nines,' but we don't know just how many,'' he said. ``We're polling
them in an effort to find out.''
   The National Sheriffs Association is conducting a similar poll of
the nation's 29,000 sheriffs and deputies.
   ``We feel that the wheel gun, or revolver, just isn't adequate
anymore,'' said Bud Meeks, director of the sheriffs association.
   Los Angeles, Washington, D.C., Miami, Boston, Atlanta and
Columbus, Ohio, are among big city police departments converting to
semiautomatic pistols, and Chicago is studying the idea.
   New York decided to stick with six-shot revolvers, but several of
its suburbs have switched.
   ``The movement definitely isn't confined to big cities,'' said
Cheryl Epps of the International Association of Police Chiefs.
   ``While D.C. is going to 9mm, for example, Prince William County,
Virginia, further up the road, also is armed to the teeth with fully
automatic weapons. They're everywhere now,'' she said.
   In Winnetka, Ill., a suburb of Chicago, Police Chief Herbert Timm
created a stir when he proposed putting Uzi machine guns in squad
cars.
   Simmons, here in Marietta, said he also has considered machine
guns.
   ``We feel the shotgun is outdated as a street weapon, given what
we're coming up against,'' he said. ``Just a few days ago, for
example, we answered a routine trouble call and wound up
confiscating an AR-15, the commercial variety of the M-16
semiautomatic rifle.''
   Sgt. Jack Schmida, firearms expert with the Los Angeles Police
Department, said an LAPD officer was killed last year by a gunman
with an AR-15.
   ``The drug dealers usually shoot each other with these weapons,
but they do shoot at us from time to time,'' said Schmida, whose
department will begin Monday to slowly phase in 9mm Berettas by
issuing them to new recruits.
   In Columbus, Ohio, police officers are given a choice.
   ``Our officers can carry a 16-shot, 9mm semiautomatic or a
nine-shot, clip-loaded .45-caliber pistol,'' said Dewey Stokes, a
member of the 1,300-member force.
   ``With the .38s the officer carried a total of 18 rounds,
counting the 12 in his belt and six in the revolver,'' Stokes said.
``Now, with the `nines,' they will carry 48 rounds, and that's a
heckuva difference.''
   In Houston, officers are armed with a variety of pistols.
   ``They buy their own weapon and can carry practically anything
they want,'' said firearms instructor J.W. Walston. ``As a result,
our officers carry a multitude of calibers, everything from 9mm to
.44 Magnums to .45s. However, we do encourage them to not carry
.38s, and we suggest they use hollow point rounds.''
   Many urban police departments have begun using hollow point
bullets, a soft-nosed round that has greater stopping power. It
tends to spread out and produce more wallop from increased tissue
damage.
   Some financially strapped cities can't make make across-the-board
purchases of semiautomatic pistols, which cost from $350 to $550.
But they frequently permit officers to buy their own sidearms.
   That is the case in Stockton, Calif., where a gunman armed with
an AK-47 rifle opened fire on a schoolyard in January, killing five
children and wounding 29 students and a teacher.
   Sgt. Ed Williams, a 24-year veteran of the Stockton force, said
he made the switch and became a big fan of the 9mm pistol.
   ``I'm not a gun nut,'' he said. ``In fact, I wouldn't mind going
to the English method of unarmed police officers, but the switch
from a .38 to a 9mm has greatly improved my accuracy and
confidence.''
   Officers in Walla Walla, Wash., Huntington, W.Va., and Muskogee,
Okla., also may buy their own semiautomatic pistols. In Muskogee,
three-fourths of the 75 officers have switched to 9mm, police Maj.
Rex Eskridge said.
   Like many towns in Florida, where drug trafficking is
particularly heavy, Palm Bay has come to see 9mm weapons as a
necessity.
   ``In addition to the 9mm sidearms, we also provide our officers
with 9mm rifles,'' said Frank McBee, the department's firing range
officer. ``Right now, we're getting five to 10 requests a week from
other law enforcement agencies for information about the rifles. The
requests have come from all around the country; even the FBI has
requested information about them.''

   Ray Nash Jr. considers himself a
no-nonsense police chief, yet he wouldn't dream of going to work
without slipping a pair of nunchakus into his belt.
   ``When I first arrived in this town 18 months ago I was afraid
people would see my `chuks' and wonder `who is this idiot?','' Nash
said.
   Now, however, each of the 33 officers on the town police force
carries a set of ``police chuks,'' a modified version of the martial
arts weapons often seen in grade-B karate movies.
   The switch from nightsticks to nunchakus is one example of how
police officers around the country are experimenting with
alternative weapons to defend themselves against better-armed
criminals.
   ``There was some resistance at first, but once our officers saw
the weapon's capabilities they were soon converted,'' Nash said.
``It's those darn kung fu movies that have given chuks a bad
reputation. Actually, they are a far superior second-level weapon
for a police officer than the traditonal nightstick.''
   He held up his nunchakus, a pair of 14-inch rosewood sticks
attached by a short cord.
   ``With a nightstick or slapjack all you can do is prod or hit
somebody,'' he said. ``But with these chuks I can clamp them on your
wrist or ankle and generate excruciating pain with a minimum of
permanent damage. Used in this manner, they are excellent as a
`come-along' device and give an officer an option to simply hitting
an unruly suspect who refuses to comply with a verbal command.''
   Then, demonstrating the weapon's versatility, he grabbed the end
of one stick and whirled the other piece of wood in a blurry arc.
   ``The chuks can go from 14 to 28 inches in length in a flash and
even strike around corners,'' said Nash. ``I can strike you a
disabling blow to the knee, wrist or elbow. We teach our officers to
always strike below the shoulder, but, if need be, chuks can be used
as an instrument of deadly force.
   ``Our female police officers really like them because you don't
have to be tremendously strong to get a lot of leverage with them,''
he added.
   ``Also,'' he said, ``in addition to being versatile, they're
cheap _ only about $3 a pair. Their only drawback is that they are
harder to control than a nightstick or a side-handle baton. But we
don't allow our officers to carry them unless they've passed a
rigorous training course.''
   Nash said he learned how to use nunchakus in 1982.
   ``I was taught by Joe Hess, who is recognized as the man who has
made police chuks popular in this country,,'' he said.
   Hess, contacted at the University of North Florida law
enforcement institute, said he has introduced the martial arts
weapons to officers from more than 300 police agencies across the
country and several other nations.
   ``I learned about them when I got interested in karate, years
ago,'' he said. ``At the time I was a member of the police force in
Wildwood, N.J. In 1969, we became the first police department in the
country to carry chuks.''
   Hess said one advantage of chuks is that police officers can
carry them anywhere.
   ``If a police officer goes into a restaurant he probably won't
bring in his nightstick or side-handle baton,'' he said. ``But the
chuks fit into your belt and can go anywhere comfortably.''

   Economists tend to get a little squinty eyed
when they look at the big picture of U.S. agriculture. That way they
don't have to focus so much on a drought here, a flood there.
   For example, in the Agriculture Department's recent studies of
the farm economy, assumptions are made that the terrible heat and
drought that devastated crops last summer will not be repeated on so
grand a scale in 1989.
   But much of the 1988 drought area, particularly in the Great
Plains and western Corn Belt, still hasn't recovered fully. That was
evident in last week's USDA report showing a sharply reduced winter
wheat crop.
   The big picture looks substantially better, however.
   What's more, USDA economists assert that, despite the agonies of
1988, farmers generally never before had so much money to spend. Net
cash income, the difference between intake and outgo, was at a
record high of about $57.7 billion last year.
   Analysts say cash income will fall in 1989 but still may be in
the range of $50 billion to $55 billion. A big reason for the
decline, they say, is a surge in expenses resulting from expanded
crop acreage.
   While not all farmers had stored grain to sell last year, the
high prices resulting from drought losses were one of the reasons
for the record net cash income. But not all farmers lost crops
because of heat and drought either.
   So how does the U.S. agricultural sector stack up? One barometer
is the condition of the major credit institutions serving farmers.
   There are four basic groups: the Farm Credit System, a network of
cooperatively owned insitutions overseen by the federal Farm Credit
Administration; commercial banks; life insurance companies, and the
Farmers Home Administration, a USDA agency.
   According to a report in the June issue of Agricultural Outlook
magazine, all except FmHA have recovered greatly from the big
financial crunch of the early 1980s.
   Last year, the report said, loan delinquencies reported by the
Farm Credit System, or FCS, dropped $2 billion to half the level of
two years ago. Life insurance companies showed a drop of $500
million in farm real estate loan delinquencies. Commercial banks saw
both delinquency rates and net loan charge-offs on non-real estate
farm loans decline to levels of the early 1980s.
   ``If farm loan quality continues to improve at last year's pace,
by 1990 farm loans will be near the quality seen before the farm
financial stress began in the early 1980s,'' the report said.
   The improved financial health of farmers and their lenders is
also evident in reduced loan restructuring. In the FCS, for example,
loan restructuring declined by half last year.
   Farmers' use of Chapter 12 bankruptcy also fell sharply in 1988
to 2,035 filings from 6,604 in 1987. The law helps farmers
restructure debt and continue farming.
   The combined farm loan volume reported by the four categories for
1988 was down only $1.4 billion, ``in sharp contrast to the previous
three years,'' when the volume dropped sharply, the report said.
   ``Commercial bank farm loan volume continued to rise in 1988,
with $45 billion outstanding at yearend, nearly 4 percent more than
a year earlier,'' the report said. ``Banks are continuing to gain
market share and now hold the greatest proportion of farm debt.''
   The net income of the FCS rose to $704 million last year,
compared with a net loss of $17 million in 1987, although reductions
in loan-loss reserves and grains from the sale of acquired property
explain much of the rise.
   But the FCS is ``still having problems generating income,'' the
report said. And the system will continue to consolidate its
operations. Last year, the 37 banks in the system merged into 15,
and the number of FCS associations was trimmed to 281 from 377.
   The FmHA has long been considered the government's farm lender of
last resort because it takes on borrowers who have been denied loans
by others. In contrast to the other lenders, FmHA continues to be in
a ``highly stressed'' situation, with 41 percent of its outstanding
loans delinquent as of February, up from 38 percent a year earlier.
   ``However, much of the rise is attributable to reduced loan
volume,'' the report said. ``The dollar amount of delinquencies
changed little from last year. FmHA delinquencies are highest during
the winter because many annual payments come due at yearend. Some
borrowers catch up on late payments by summer.''
   Farm lenders are ``competing keenly for good-quality'' loans, the
report said. Consequently, this benefits farmers by holding down
credit costs. Even so, because of a general rise in interest rates,
farmers faced rising interest rates in 1988 and early 1989.
   ``Despite the strong farm financial recovery, lenders are
concerned about the long-term profitability of farm operations and
farmers' ability to repay loans,'' the report said. ``Increasing
competition for agricultural exports and reduced government (price)
support could erode farmers' profitability.''

<HEAD>Mexico First Country to Get Debt Relief Funds Under Brady Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The World Bank has announced $1.5 billion worth
of loans to Mexico with provisions that up to one-fourth of the
funds can be used to lessen the country's debt burden, a move aimed
at advancing the Bush administration's Third World debt reduction
plan.
   Approval for the loans came Tuesday at a meeting of the bank's
board of directors. The decision means that Mexico becomes the first
country to gain money for debt relief from the 151-nation lending
institution as part of the debt initiative launched by Treasury
Secretary Nicholas Brady.
   World Bank President Barber Conable hailed the decision as a
milestone in the 43-history of the World Bank.
   ``This is the first time, ever, that the bank has made provisions
to finance debt relief for one of its member countries,'' Conable
said at a news conference. ``Today's action signals the bank's
determination to become more involved in solving the problem of
Third World debt, within the framework of the Brady initiative.''
   Brady announced on March 10 a program to encourage commercial
banks to voluntarily forgive a portion of the $1.3 trillion debt
burden being carried by Third World countries.
   The Brady plan envisioned that the World Bank and its sister
organization, the International Monetary Fund, would provide the
bulk of incentives needed for commercial banks to voluntarily write
down their debt.
   But so far the commercial banks have complained that the
resources being discussed by the two international lending
organizations are insufficient to accomplish the scale of debt
relief being demanded by debtor countries.
   The banks and Mexico are currently far apart in their talks on
the matter. Mexico is insisting that its outstanding debt be reduced
by 50 percent while the banks have only offered to reduce the
principal of existing loans by 22 percent.
   World Bank officials said they hoped the loan announcement would
be enough to break a stalemate in debt reduction talks currently
under way in New York between Mexico and its creditor banks.
   Conable said the timing of the World Bank's action was meant to
send a positive message to negotiators so they would know how much
money would be available.
   About $375 million, representing 25 percent of the total package
of loans, would provide Mexico with the funds to negotiate various
methods for reducing its total debt of $107.4 billion, second
largest in the developing world behind the $120.1 billion owed by
Brazil.
   The $375 million would be available, for example, to allow Mexico
to buy back its own loans in the secondary market, where they are
selling at a steep discount from the face value.
   Conable said Venezuela, with $35 billion in debt, the
Philippines, carrying $30.2 billion in debt, and Costa Rica, with
$4.8 billion, would also be early candidates for debt reduction
assistance.
   The administration is hoping to have a successful Mexican debt
package completed in time for Bush's trip to the economic summit of
major industrial nations in Paris on July 14. The hope is that an
agreement with Mexico would serve as a model for debt relief
programs for other heavily indebted countries.

   Sears, Roebuck and Co. is having a hard time
finding a buyer for the Sears Tower for its $1.2 billion asking
price, so the price is coming down, brokers say.
   ``The response has not been what Sears hoped for,'' said Scott
Brandwein, executive vice president of Frain, Camins &amp; Swartchild,
one of Chicago's leading real estate brokers.
   The problem, Brandwein said, is that Sears announced that it
would evacuate most of the 50 lower floors, forcing a new owner to
find many new tenants to replace the lost occupancy.
   Brandwein said the prestige of being in the world's tallest
building starts at the 50th floor and up, not on the lower floors.
   ``If it were the upper floors that were available, the building
could command the premium it always has,'' he said.
   Besides selling its Sears Tower headquarters building, the
company plans to relocate the headquarters of its 6,000-employee
Merchandise Group from the Sears Tower to less expensive quarters,
as yet unannounced.

<HEAD>Japan's Trade Surplus Narrows In May</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan's trade surplus with the United States
narrowed 19 percent last month to $2.76 billion from a revised $3.40
billion a year earlier, the Finance Ministry said Wednesday.
   It was the first decline from year-earlier figures in four months
and likely to be welcomed in both Washington and Tokyo, where trade
tensions have flared again in recent months.
   Officials from the two countries ended two days of trade talks in
Japan Wednesday and reportedly agreed to cooperate in reducing the
trade imbalance.
   Rising imports helped reduce Japan's overall trade surplus to
$3.78 billion in May, down 27 percent from a year earlier and 48
percent below the previous month, the Finance Ministry said.
   In April, the country's trade surplus rose 7.7 percent from the
previous year to $7.30 billion. In May 1988 it was $5.19 billion.
   Ministry officials attributed the smaller-than-expected
unadjusted surplus for May to an increase in the pace of import
growth, which they said resisted the yen's relative weakness against
the dollar compared to its year-earlier level.
   However, the yen's relative weakness tended to shrink the
dollar-based surplus figure, after adjustment from yen, they said.
   Exports in May rose 4.9 percent from the previous year to $21.67
billion, while imports climbed 15.7 percent to $17.89 billion.
   After seasonal adjustment, the May surplus came to $3.61 billion,
down sharply from $6.74 billion in April.
   May exports were calculated using an average exchange rate for
the month of 133.98 yen to one dollar, compared with 124.75 yen in
May 1988. Imports were calculated at an average 133.78 yen, compared
with 124.76 yen a year earlier.
   ``There was an opposite (statistical) effect from the stronger
dollar,'' noted Sanwa Bank Ltd. capital markets economist T. Mizuno.
   A ministry official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
continuing strong domestic demand linked to Japan's healthy economy
had contributed to the rise in imports.
   He said import figures also were boosted by higher world oil
prices. Petroleum prices averaged $18 a barrel in May, compared to
$16.20 a year earlier, he said.
   The percentage of manufactured products in total imports fell to
48.6 percent, the lowest level this year, he said. The level had
been increasing in recent months.
   Exports to the United States rose 3.2 percent from a year earlier
to $7.13 billion, while imports from the United States surged 24.6
percent to $4.37 billion.
   Imports of general food products from the United States rose 23.4
percent to $970.4 million and chemical products increased 46 percent
to $538.8 million.
   Imports of general U.S. machinery products, including
semiconductors and cars, rose 23.3 percent to $1.18 billion. Within
this category, imports of motor vehicles surged 148 percent to $53.2
million.
   Japanese exports of general electrical machinery, including
videotape recorders, video cameras and semiconductors, to the United
States rose 11.9 percent to $1.62 billion. But within this category,
exports of television cameras fell 16.7 percent to $127.6 million.

chief operating officer of Mack Trucks Inc., the companies said.
   Ralph Reins, whose resignation was announced Tuesday, was
replaced by Hubertus von Gruenberg, managing director of ITT's Teves

half of all ITT Automotive's $1.5 billion in revenues last year.
   Teves makes anti-lock braking systems, which pulse brakes
electronically to prevent wheel lockup and skidding. Automakers
increasingly are including the systems as standard equipment in new
cars.
   ITT Automotive, with 79 plants in 12 countries, supplies the

<HEAD>U.S., Japan Agree to Discuss Structural Trade Problems</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japanese and U.S. officials agreed Wednesday that
their nations' economic structures are a key cause of their massive
trade imbalance, news reports said.
   Deputy Cabinet ministers from the two nations agreed that factors
such as Japan's complex distribution system and the United States'
low savings rate and high consumption level made it difficult to
reduce the trade imbalance, Kyodo News Service and the Japan
Broadcasting Corp. (NHK) reported.
   The two sides also discussed how to find a ``mutually
acceptable'' way of dealing with charges by Washington that Japan
maintains unfair barriers against U.S. space satellites, forestry
products and supercomputers, Kyodo said.
   Meanwhile, Japan announced Wednesday that rising imports pushed
its overall trade surplus down 27 percent in May from a year earlier
to $3.78 billion, and its surplus with the United States down 19
percent to $2.76 billion.
   Under the ``Super 301'' clause of the new U.S. trade act, the
U.S. government is required to begin negotiations with ``unfair''
trading nations and can impose penalty tariffs against those that do
not open their markets within 18 months. Japan has said it will
refuse to negotiate under a threat of retaliation.
   The two-day talks, part of a semiannual series of consultations
on economic issues between deputy Cabinet ministers from the two
sides, were the first since new administrations were inaugurated in
both Japan and the United States.
   In the talks, at the hot springs resort town of Ito southwest of
Tokyo, the United States did not ask for any official consultations
under the ``Super 301'' clause, Kyodo said.
   Officials of both countries said the already-scheduled session
was used as a framework to follow up President George Bush's request
for talks about structural barriers to trade.
   The clause has been criticized as protectionist by members of the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which groups
Western industrialized nations.
   ``We are confident that appropriate discussions (related to the
clause) will occur, and the issues will be raised in a mutually
acceptable way,'' Kyodo quoted Undersecretary of State Richard
McCormack, head of the U.S. delegation, as saying after the meeting.
   The two sides agreed to hold future consulations on the
structural impediments to a reduction in the trade imbalance, Kyodo
said.
   The United States has said Japan's multilayered distribution
system makes it difficult to increase exports to Japan, while Japan
has charged that problems in the United States, such as its low
savings rate, high consumption level and massive budget deficit,
have worsened the imbalance.
   In the past, trade negotiations between the two nations often
focused on barriers to individual industries or products rather than
on economic structures.
   Also participating in the trade talks were Deputy U.S. Trade
Representative Linn Williams and J. Michael Farren, assistant
secretary of commerce for international trade.
   The Japanese delegation was led by Michihiko Kunihiro, a deputy
to Prime Minister Sousuke Uno, and included the deputy ministers of
international trade, finance, agriculture, and the Economic Planning
Agency, the reports said.

   Time Inc. stock slipped today in the wake of the
media company's disclosure that it had asked the Federal
Communications Commission to deny a petition by Paramount
Communications Inc. to form a trust that would help Paramount
complete its $10.7 billion hostile tender offer for Time.
   In early dealings today, Time stock fell $2 a share to $178 in
trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
   Time stock traded as high as $182.75 a share on Tuesday before
closing at $180, up $5 a share in activity driven partly by reports
quoting a securities analyst as saying General Electric Co. was a
possible suitor for Time.
   Time is expected to fight an unsolicited $175-a-share cash buyout
bid from Paramount and is trying to preserve a planned stock swap
merger with Warner Communications Inc.
   Paramount has asked permission to create the voting trust to
allow it to purchase Time's shares pending FCC approval of the
transfer of cable television franchises and licenses held by Time's
82-percent-owned cable TV unit, American Television and
Communications Corp.
   Time said in a 46-page motion filed Tuesday with the FCC that
approval of the voting trust violates the Cable Communications
Policy Act of 1984 which gives cities the right to approve cable
franchise transfers.
   ``Paramount would have the (FCC) exercise jurisdiction which it
simply does not have,'' Time argued.
   A spokesman for Paramount called the challenge ``unsound.''
   In relation to unconfirmed rumors that General Electric may be
interested in getting oinvolved in the fight got Time, GE spokesman
Jack Batty said Tuesday that the company does not comment on rumors.
``Our name pops up illogically in connection with a lot of rumors,''
he said.
   Tuesday's advance in Time stock followed a $4.75-a-share jump
Monday, when rumors swept the market that the leveraged buyout firm
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co., the Bass family of Texas or Warner
might offer $215 a share for Time.
   Time remained tight-lipped Tuesday about its plans. Edward Adler,
a Time spokesman, refused to comment on when the company's board
would meet again.
   The directors, who held an informational meeting Sunday, were
expected to meet sometime this week to decide on a course of action.
Time has until June 21 to respond to Paramount's offer.
   Among the options the board was expected to consider were a
recapitalization, a cash tender offer for Warner, a cash tender
offer for Paramount and a continued pursuit of the planned merger
with Warner. Warner could also launch a cash tender offer for Time.
   Time also remained silent about the June 23 meeting at which
shareholders were to vote on the proposed merger with Warner, which
would create the world's largest media company. That meeting was
expected to be postponed.
   Under the Time-Warner proposal, Time shareholders would get a
share in the new company, Time-Warner Inc., for each share they own
while Warner shareholders would get 0.465 share of the new company
for each Warner share.
   In the absence of any concrete developments in the tug of war
over Time, stock speculators have tried to anticipate the next move.
   On Tuesday, Nicholas Heymann, a Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
analyst who follows GE, was reported by one market news service to
have said GE was a possible bidder for Time. Investors, anticipating
a bidding war for the media company, snapped up Time stock.
   GE closed down 75 cents at $53.50 a share on the NYSE. Paramount
shares rose 75 cents to $57.75, while Warner stock fell 25 cents to
$54.50.

<HEAD>Sales Outpace April Inventory Buildup</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Business inventories rose 0.6 percent in April
but the buildup was outpaced by a 1.7 percent increase in sales, the
government said today.
   The Commerce Department said inventories held on shelves and
backlots climbed to a seasonally adjusted $769.8 billion in April
following a 0.3 percent rise in March.
   Business sales, meanwhile, increased to a seasonally adjusted
$516.3 billion after holding steady in March. March sales followed a
0.9 percent plunge in February, the sharpest fall since January 1987.
   The April business activity produced a decrease in the ratio of
inventories to sales. It was 1.49, meaning it would take 1.49 months
to exhaust inventories at the April sales pace. The ratio stood at
1.51 in March and 1.50 in February.
   When not accompanied by increases in sales, rising inventories
could threaten a recession by prompting manufacturers to cut back
production until inventories are sold.
   Inventory accumulation in April was led by a 0.8 percent increase
at the retail level, where sales were the weakest. Manufacturing
inventories, which represent about 47 percent of the total, were up
0.6 percent, while wholesale inventories edged up 0.1 percent.
   Manufacturers led April sales with a 2.4 percent increase,
followed by wholesalers, up 1.3 percent, and retailers, up 1.0
percent. An advance report on retail sales in May, released Tuesday,
showed a weak 0.1 percent gain.

<HEAD>Security Pacific Sells 5 Percent To Mitsui Bank</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Security Pacific Corp. announced it will sell
5 percent of its consumer and commercial finance subsidiary for $100
million to Mitsui Bank Ltd., Japan's seventh-largest bank.
   The sale, announced Tuesday, will offer Security Pacific access
to the Japanese subsidiaries, franchises and distributors in the
United States that are associated with Mitsui's loosely knit
industrial group, or zaibatsu.
   ``Because of the zaibatsu relationship that many of these
companies have with the Mitsui corporate family, it gives us an
access which is, in the parlance of the zaibatsus, a comfortable way
of doing business,'' said Nicholas B. Binkley, vice chairman of
Security Pacific Financial Services System.
   Mitsui Bank, part of Japan's second-largest general trading
group, is associated with diverse manufacturing and energy
companies. It also has longstanding relationships with other major
Japanese corporations that have subsidiaries in the United States.
   The deal was initiated 18 months ago by Kenichi Kamiya, chairman
of Mitsui Bank, and Richard J. Flamson III, chairman and chief
executive of Security Pacific, the United States' fifth-largest
banking company. It is expected to be completed in the fourth
quarter of this year, bank officials said.
   According to terms of the agreement, Mitsui Bank will get a 5
percent equity interest in the consumer and commercial services
group of Security Pacific Financial Services System, which is based
in San Diego.
   Mitsui also has an option to buy another 5 percent on similar
terms.
   The Security Pacific subsidiary, with assets of $12.6 billion,
provides non-collateralized consumer loans through 350 offices in 44
states. The subsidiary also makes commercial loans to finance
product sales.
   The agreement also calls for U.S. and Japanese bankers to conduct
joint business calls on Mitsui customers, Binkley said.

<TEXT>
   The Environmental Protection Agency says
hundreds of industrial plants in 44 states must curb chemical
releases into waterways because the waters nearby are becoming too
contaminated with toxic substances.
   The EPA on Tuesday released a list of nearly 600 stretches of
lakes, rivers and streams that the agency said do not meet state
water quality standards because of chemical emissions from nearby
industrial plants and other facilities.
   Rebecca Hanmer, the EPA's assistant administrator for water, said
that while the poor quality of many of the waterways may be largely
due to chemical runoffs from agriculture or mining operations, in
many cases the industrial releases also are to blame.
   The agency said toxic chemical releases from 879 industrial
plants, city water treatment plants and other facilities are causing
or significantly contributing to violations in water quality
standards in 595 waterways across the country.
   Ms. Hanmer said that in most cases the polluting plants are doing
so legally because the releases are within state permit restrictions.
   The EPA made no estimate on health risks from the industrial
pollution, nor did it provide information on levels of releases into
specific waterways.
   Ms. Hanmer said that while the statistics are worrisome the
agency could not speculate on the health effects on humans. She
noted that the standards being violated are designed to protect
aquatic life and the levels do not necessarily pose a health threat
to humans.
   The EPA has directed states to develop additional ``control
strategies'' that will require the polluters to curb discharges of
toxic chemicals so that the waters meet state standards by mid-1992.
   The EPA said only about 40 percent of the 897 polluters have
submitted plans approved by the EPA to bring the toxic releases into
compliance by 1992. The remainder have either submitted plans that
were rejected or have yet to submit a compliance program, officials
said.
   The EPA report covered 126 toxic chemicals including a variety of
substances believed to cause cancer.
   In addition to industrial facilities, the polluters included a
dozen federal facilities and 240 local water treatment plants that
often discharge pollutants from industrial sources. Among the
polluters are several military bases, Energy Department facilities
and the Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. in Alaska, which has been told
to tighten its controls on dumping contaminated water used as
ballast in oil tankers.
   The greatest concentration of releases stems from plants in the
metal finishing, pulp and paper, and natural gas industries, which
account for more than 40 percent of the industrial polluters cited.
The releases involve a broad range of metals and chemicals including
benzene, mercury, nickel, lead, asbestos, arsenic, cyanide and
dioxin.
   Contamination of waterways by at least some of the 126 toxic
chemicals was found in all but six states: Arizona, North Dakota,
South Dakota, Nebraska, Hawaii and Vermont. The largest numbers of
polluters were found in Pennsylvania, Washington state, Wyoming and
Indiana, although EPA officials said in some cases a state had more
polluters listed because of tougher state standards.

<HEAD>Central Newspapers Plans to Make First Public Stock Offering</HEAD>
<DATELINE>INDIANAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Central Newspapers Inc., which owns
newspapers in Indiana and Arizona, said Wednesday it plans to make
its first public stock offering.
   The company said it would register some of its Class A, or
non-voting, common stock for sale. It would be the first time the
Indianapolis-based company had offered its shares for public sale.
   The stock would be offered to the public exclusively by
individuals and charitable organizations that have received shares
over the years.
   Central Newspapers, a private company with fewer than 200
stockholders, reported revenues last year of almost $418 million and
net income of more than $29 million.
   Its subsidiaries publish eight newspapers in Indiana and Arizona,
including The Arizona Republic, The Phoenix Gazette, The
Indianapolis Star and The Indianapolis News.
   Newspaper executives said the amount of stock to be sold and the
sale price had not been determined.
   ``We expect that shareholders will offer at least $50 million in
value of their Class A common stock,'' said Frank E. Russell,
president of Central Newspapers. ``We are hopeful that this proposed
transaction will be completed in the second half of 1989.''
   The plan, which was approved Tuesday by the company's board, was
first considered more than a year ago when some stockholders
indicated they wanted to sell their stock. It was delayed, however,
because the stock market was declining and there were problems
involved in completing a merger with a holding company that owned 20
percent of Central's voting stock and 24 percent of its non-voting
stock.
   The merger was completed last fall and a wholly owned subsidiary,
Central Shares Inc., was formed.
   Other newspapers published by the company include the Arizona
Businiess Gazette and, in Indiana, The Muncie Star, The Muncie
Evening Press and The Vincennes Sun-Commercial.

   The Baldor Boehm Co. said it plans to

operations to Arkansas, eliminating about 180 jobs in the state.
   Operations at the factory, which makes electric motors for
industrial use, will be moved to a new plant in Clarksville, Ark.,
the company said Tuesday.
   Plant general manager Freeman Bartz said the copany had trouble
finding workers locally with the necessary manufacturing skills.
   Another problem was bringing managers and engineers from the
company's Fort Smith, Ark., headquarters to support operations in
New Milford, he said.
   In a statement given to workers Monday, the company urged
employees to ``stay with us to take care of our customers.''
   Parent company Baldor Electric Co. acquired the former R.A. Boehm
Co. in 1977.
   Baldor, which makes several types of electric motors, employs
2,260 people. It was founded in 1920 and has 12 manufacturing plants
in the United States, plus plants in West Germany and Venezuela.

<TEXT>
   McDonnell Douglas Corp. announced Wednesday at the
Paris Air Show that it has signed a memorandum of understanding with
Britain's Westland Helicopters Ltd. for coproduction of the AH-64
Apache helicopter in Britain.
   The McDonnell Douglas-Westland agreement establishes an equal
work share between the two companies.
   The deal is for maintenance as well as manufacturing and is
contingent on sale of the helicopters to the British Ministry of
Defense for the British Army, according to Rob Mack, a spokesman for
McDonnell Douglas' helicopter division.
   The potential sale, if approved, would be for between 125 and 150
Apaches. The helicopter, when sold to the United States armed
forces, carries a price tag of $10 million.
   John Varde, managing director of Westland Helicopters, told
reporters at a news conference that the Apache is one of several
attack helicopters currently being considered by the British.
   McDonnell denied the announcements were intended to influence the
British government's choice for a new combat helicopter.
   McDonnell Douglas claims that the Apache is world's only combat
helicopter capable of flying and attacking targets in near-zero
visibility conditions.
   Officials of the U.S. aircraft manufacturer said they anticipate
a decision by the British Defense Ministry before the end of 1989.

   Elton Schade, a local Teamsters official who
helped negotiate the first new contract in three years for truck
drivers at Detroit newspapers, died today of a gunshot wound,
officials said. He was 47.
   The body was found about 2:20 a.m. behind Teamsters Local 372,
Detroit Police Sgt. George Anthony said.
   Anthony said police hadn't determined how the shooting occurred,
although local President Tom Minielly said the shot apparently was
self-inflicted.
   Schade was secretary-treasurer of the 550-member local, which
represented drivers and other circulation employees at The Detroit

   ``We're in a state of shock right now. This is the last thing we
thought would happen,'' said Gordon Parker, recording secretary for
the local.
   The union ratified a contract with the newspaper June 7 calling
for a $22-a-week raise. Less than a quarter of the members voted on
the contract, and Schade described the membership as resigned. ``For
now, this was all there was to get,'' he said after the 101-14 vote.

<TEXT>
   Corn and soybean futures prices leaped in early
trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade following a National
Weather Service 30-day forecast for a change to warmer and drier
conditions in the Midwest.
   Wheat and oat futures also advanced.
   The rally, which extends Tuesday's moderate advance, represents
at least a temporary reversal of a five-week trend of falling prices
linked to rainy weather in the Corn Belt, which is still recovering
from last year's disastrous drought.
   ``The next question will be: Does the weather start to turn dry
now,'' said Steve Freed, a grain-market analyst in Chicago with Dean
Witter Reynolds Inc. ``If it does, we'll start to turn higher.''
   The corn market also was supported by reports that private crop
analyst Sparks Commodities had estimated 1989 U.S. corn plantings at
71.7 million acres, significantly below the Agriculture Department's
latest prediction of 73.3 million acres.
   In early trading, wheat was 1 cent to 4 cents higher with the
contract for delivery in July at $3.95\ a bushel; corn was { cent to
7 cents higher with July at $2.57\ a bushel; oats were 4{ cents to
4} cents higher with July at $1.66\ a bushel; soybeans were 9{ cents
to 12 cents higher with July at $7.10{ a bushel.
   Cattle futures were mostly higher while pork futures were mostly
lower in early trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .02 cent lower to .30 cent higher with June at
70.95 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .03 cent to .15 cent higher
with August at 80.90 cents a pound; live hogs were unchanged to .35
cent lower with June at 47.30 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies
were .22 cent to .62 cent lower with July at 33.90 cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures settled mixed on Tuesday.

<TEXT>
   Bell Helicopter Textron Inc. will seek foreign
funding to develop the V-22 Osprey tiltrotor plane if it is dropped
from next year's U.S. defense budget, the company's president said
Wednesday.
   The V-22 Osprey, being developed under a $1.8 billion Pentagon
contract, takes off like a helicopter and can tilt its engines for
fast, level flight, like ordinary airplanes.
   It has been removed from the proposed fiscal 1990 budget by
Secretary of Defense Richard Cheney.
   ``I've been working with this project since I began at Bell
Helicopters 15 years ago, and I'll find some way to bring this
technology to fruition, some mechanism to bring it to production in
some form,'' Bell Helicopter President Jack Horner said at the Paris
Air Show.
   ``There's enough interest in the world. We'll be able to find
someone to assist the funding for development, whether governments,
corporations or banks,'' he said.
   The tiltrotor plane, developed jointly by Fort Worth, Texas-based
Bell Helicopter and Boeing Helicopter, a division of The Boeing Co.
of Seattle, has suffered delays and several technical setbacks the
companies said were being resolved.
   Horner said when the plane goes into production it will create at
least 2,000 new jobs in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, where the
company already employs about 7,500 people.
   At the Paris Air Show, Bell Helicopter and Boeing Helicopter
announced a memorandum of understanding with three European
companies to study market potential for the new technology in NATO
countries.
   The new agreement is with Aeritalia of Italy, British Aerospace
of Great Britain and Dornier of West Germany. Similar accords also
have been signed with C. Itoh and Mitsui of Japan for market studies
of Japanese Defense Agency requirements.

   Norway pumped a record 1.57 million barrels a day in May,
compared with an estimated 1.43 million barrels produced by Britain,
which closed several North Sea fields due to accidents and
maintenance problems, the business newspaper Dagens Naeringsliv said.
   Official figures are to be released in July.
   Oil Ministry spokesman Egil Helle said the 40 percent increase
over the May 1988 production level irritated some members of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, which hopes to
stabilize prices by limiting supplies.
   The increase is due to new fields coming on stream and other
fields producing more than expected.
   Though Norway is not an OPEC member, it has held production at
7.5 percent below capacity since 1987 to cooperate with the oil
cartel. A six-month extension of the limit probably will be approved
this month, Oil Minister Arne Oeien said.
   Only four of the 13 OPEC countries have production quotas
exceeding Norway's in the second half of 1989, the newspaper said.

   Thousands of West Virginia coal miners
today continued a wildcat strike _ hundreds of them in defiance of a
federal judge _ and the walkout spread to Virginia.
   About 650 Westmoreland Coal Co. miners in southwest Virginia
walked off the job this morning, company spokesman Steve Anderson
said.
   The wildcat action began Monday when an estimated 10,000 miners
in West Virginia walked out in support of 1,600 fellow United Mine
Workers who have been on strike in Virginia and West Virginia since
April 5 against Pittston Coal Group, the nation's largest coal
exporter.
   U.S. District Judge Dennis Knapp on Monday and Tuesday issued
back-to-work orders covering 450 UMW members at more than a dozen
West Virginia mines, but many of the workers affected stayed off the
job today.
   ``Everything's the same as it was yesterday,'' said Paul
Kvederis, a spokesman for Consolidation Coal Co., which had about
250 miners out.
   In ordering the miners back to work, the judge said it appears
the union is violating a no-strike clause in its 1988 national
contract. Union officials have insisted that they did not authorize
the walkout. They did not return telephone calls today.
   Some strikers said they will remain off the job until three union
officials are released from the Roanoke, Va., jail, where they are
being held for violating a state judge's order limiting picket-line
activity at Pittston mines. The judge has also imposed $3 million in
fines.
   Roger Caldwell, a UMW field representative, said the walkout is a
result of ``the massive fines the court's putting on us and the
jailing of our people down there and I think they've come to the
point where enough's enough.''
   Caldwell estimated that 98 percent of the miners in Logan and
Mingo counties, the heart of the southern West Virginia coal field,
were on strike Tuesday.
   ``No reason for the unauthorized work stoppage has been
communicated to management,'' said Tom Clarke, a spokesman for
Peabody Holding Co., which reported 2,360 miners off the job. ``Our
policy is not to talk to the miners until they return to work.''

<DATELINE>THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Industrial nations and
non-governmental organizations Wednesday approved a $4.3 billion aid
package for Indonesia this year, but pressed for further economic
reform to guarantee stable growth.
   Total aid pledged by 15 nations including the Netherlands, the
United States and Japan exceeded last year's $4 billion package.
Japan pledged the largest single amount, $1.46 billion. The United
States pledged $90 million.
   Saleh Afiff, Indonesia's minister of state for planning of
national development said the increase reflected ``the donor
nations' confidence in our economic policies and management.''
   The pledges were made at the 32nd annual session of the
Inter-Governmental Group on Indonesia (IGGI), an organization
chaired by the Netherlands, Indonesia's former colonizer.
Non-governmental IGGI members include the World Bank and European
Economic Community.
   Of this year's pledges, about $250 million will be grants and the
rest in loans at interest rates of 2 percent to 7 percent, Afiff
said. He said most of the aid was not tied to any specific projects.
   Dutch Foreign Aid Minister Piet Bukman said with a 5 percent
economic growth rate in Indonesia this year, ``progress has been
sustained.'' But he said further economic reform was necessary.
   ``Further deregulation of foreign trade and better incentives for
private investment will lead to increased competitiveness, which
will create the many jobs needed by Indonesia's rapidly growing
population,'' Bukman said.
   He said an estimated 12 million people were expected to flood
Indonesia's already strained job market in coming years.
   Other IGGI member nations include Australia, Austria, Belgium,
Britain, Canada, Finland, France, West Germany, Italy, New Zealand
and Spain. Other non-governmental members include the Asian
Development Bank and the United Nations Development Program.

   The place where baseball's Harmon
Killebrew once belted home runs is about to become a monstrous
shopping center billed as a combination of Disneyland, Bourbon
Street and the Champs Elysees.
   The $600 million Mall of America, developed by the Ghermezian
brothers of Edmonton, Alberta, will have hundreds of stores, 18
movie theaters and an amusement park.
   ``You won't have to go to New York or Paris or Rome anymore,''
said Nader Ghermezian.
   Groundbreaking ceremonies were held today for the mall, promoted
as the nation's largest enclosed shopping and entertainment complex.
   With 4.2 million square feet, the mall will have nearly as much
floor space as the 110-story Sears Tower in Chicago, the world's
tallest building.
   The suburban Minneapolis mall was originally billed as the
largest in the world, but design cutbacks will leave it 1 million
square feet shy of the Ghermezians' West Edmonton Mall in Canada.
   Four large department stores, including Bloomingdale's, Nordstrom
and Carson Pirie Scott, will anchor the retail portion. Rounding it
off will be 600 to 800 specialty shops, 18 movie theaters, a health
club and dozens of eating and drinking establishments.
   The stores will be built around an amusement area created by
Knott's Berry Farm that will be larger than the Hubert H. Humphrey
Metrodome, the current home of the Minnesota Twins baseball team and
Minnesota Vikings football team.
   The decision in 1978 to build the Metrodome near downtown
Minneapolis paved the way for the mega-mall because Bloomington
officials later bought the defunct Metropolitan Stadium site, where
the Twins and Vikings played.
   A second phase is envisioned to include hotels, but those plans
have not been completed. In addition, Nader Ghermezian said last
week that the developers are considering building a monorail to link
the mall to nearby Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport.
   The developers, who announced the project in 1985, are betting an
average of 100,000 visitors a day will routinely come from up to 400
miles away.
   Former Bloomington Mayor James Lindau said he hasn't always
shared the Ghermezians' optimism.
   ``In May 1987, I thought the deal was dead,'' said Lindau, whose
defeat later that year was widely considered a vote against the
mega-mall.
   The city took a large stake in the project by promising $100
million in public financing and Lindau suffered some embarrassment
when the brothers' grandiose plans _ which initially called for
submarine rides in a huge aqua facility _ began to crumble. There
were long delays for the Ghermezians to raise money, but Melvin
Simon &amp; Associates of Indianapolis joined as co-developer.

   Congressional Democrats today promised a
lengthy fight if they fail in their bid for a quick overturn of
President Bush's swift veto of legislation raising the minimum wage.
   ``We're going to be working in the coming hours to get the votes
necessary and if that's possible we'll override the veto,'' new
Speaker Thomas S. Foley said as the House prepared to meet to
consider the day-old veto.
   ``And if not, we'll be getting ready to send another bill to the
White House,'' said Foley, D-Wash.
   Indeed, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., planned to offer another
bill swiftly if the House override effort failed as expected.
   ``There will be an increase in the minimum wage, if not today,
then soon,'' Kennedy said Tuesday after Bush upstaged congressional
Democrats by vetoing the minimum-wage bill less than an hour after
it was sent to the White House.
   ``All of our efforts now are devoted to overturning the veto and
I would hope that the compelling justice that is at issue in this
case would reach sufficient members so that we are successful,''
said Kennedy, D-Mass. ``If we're not successful on this we will
revisit this issue.''
   Kennedy and other Democratic leaders spoke at a news conference
that had been called as a final attempt to persuade Bush to sign the
measure, which would raise the hourly minimum wage from $3.35 to
$4.55 by October 1991.
   But even as they gathered for the event, word reached Capitol
Hill that Bush had vetoed the bill aboard Air Force One while
traveling in the Midwest.
   ``It is regrettable that this debate must end with a veto,'' Bush
said in a message to Congress accompanying the first veto of his
five-month administration.
   The Democrats, however, said the debate was far from over.
   ``Hope springs eternal,'' was all Foley would say Tuesday when
asked if he had a realistic chance of picking up support from more
than 30 House members overnight _ the additional support Democrats
would need for a two-thirds override margin.
   Even if Foley delivered the votes, more than enough Republican
senators have vowed to side with Bush to sustain the veto.
   Both sides view the battle as a contest for momentum in domestic
policy.
   Perhaps mindful of that, the Democrats made no predictions of
winning the immediate fight but escalated their rhetoric in hopes of
creating a political issue that will help them in the long haul.
   While White House aides joked about the speed of the veto,
Democrats characterized it as a sign of Bush's insensitivity to
minimum wage workers who last got a pay raise in 1981.
   ``It is particularly offensive that the president would do this
in this manner, demonstrating disdain for the poor working people of
this country at the very time he is exerting the maximum effort to
provide a $30,000 a year tax cut to the very wealthiest Americans,''
said Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell.
   ``What the president is saying is `To those who have much we must
give more. To those who have little we must give nothing,'''
Mitchell said. ``We think that's the wrong set of priorities.''
   Bush, however, said the Democrats' bill would hurt those it was
designed to help.
   ``This bill would increase the minimum wage by an excessive
amount and thus stifle the creation of new job opportunities,'' Bush
said in his veto message. Democrats had hoped Bush would at least
make a compromise offer but his veto message left intact his
take-it-or-leave-it stance.
   ``Increasing the minimum wage is not an effective way to help the
poor,'' said Bush, whose offer to boost the floor wage to $4.25 an
hour by January 1992 stemmed from a presidential campaign pledge.
   Bush said his support for even that increase hinged on adding to
the 50-year-old minimum wage law a new provision allowing employers
to pay new hires less than the minimum for six months regardless of
prior work experience.
   Mitchell called that provision ``a significant step backwards in
social justice.'' The Democrats had offered a restrictive provision
allowing new entrants into the job market to be paid a subminimum
for up to two months; Bush said it was inadequate and would not
prevent the massive job losses he argues would result from a higher
minimum wage.
   The Democrats saw it differently.
   ``Not often does any person have the opportunity to help so many
people simply by signing his name,'' Kennedy said. ``President Bush
had that opportunity today and failed.''

   Stock prices rallied Wednesday to end the day
higher as a steady British pound allayed worries of a rise in
British interest rates.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index finished 10.6
points, or 0.5 percent, higher at 2,133.6, its best level of the
day. The index was down as much as 11.5 points in the morning.
   Volume was 467.6 million shares, little changed from 463.8
million shares Tuesday.
   Market players said the pound steadied and British monetary
authorities would wait before signaling an interest rate rise at
least until after Thursday's elections for the European Parliament.
   ``We've got a mild period of leisure until after the European
elections are out of the way,'' said Jeffrey Thompson, chief equity
strategist at the London investment firm Barclays de Zoete Wedd Ltd.
   But he warned the market could be tested once again as soon as
Friday or Monday, as foreign exchange markets react to a series of
key U.S. and British economic indicators due out later in the week.
   The pound's sharp fall Tuesday, particularly against the Deutsche
mark, reignited fears that British interest rates might be pushed
higher to bolster the currency.

   A 19th-century factory that once produced
linseed oil is pumping out ideas today as the home of a new kind of
company, a product consulting firm.
   Style counts at companies such as Innovation &amp; Development Inc.,
which help other companies turn technology into dollars by making
products easier to use and nicer to look at.
   The 14 employees of Innovation &amp; Development work in a zone by
the Hudson River that once pulsed with basic industry. Next door are
empty lots dotted with dead smokestacks as well as new development,
signs of a moribund tract taking on a second life.
   Inside, the mood is relaxed and the decor high-tech. Employees
have the tieless, hip look of younger Madison Avenue advertising
types.
   The testing section is strewn with a bag of golf clubs, a
treadmill, half-dismantled dishwashers, refrigerators and a sink. A
shelf is covered with dozens of shampoo bottles.
   The atmosphere of Innovations &amp; Development reflects the change
in the balance of power from gritty industry to the knowledge
economy, in which know-how and creativity are paramount.
   When Baxter Healthcare Corp. invented a better way to administer
fluids to hospital patients, it turned to Innovations &amp; Development
to help make it a product.
   The firm's designers visited hospitals, did market research,
spoke to nurses, drew sketches and made foam-board models.
   Eventually, they helped Baxter design a device for delivering up
to 10 fluids to a patient through two lines, replacing the tangle of
tubes seen in critical-care wards.
   ``Really, what we did was simplify the plumbing,'' said vice
president Victor A. Siegel.
   Rarely is the know-how of product consultants put into a
completely new widget. Clients don't want that.
   ``In most cases, they're under time pressure, and they're not
interested in a whole lot of pain,'' said Don Gamache, chief
executive of Innotech Corp. of Trumbull, Conn., another firm in the
field.
   There are are nearly 6,750 industrial designers in the United
States, and more than half work independently, the Industrial
Designers Society of America says.
   In 10 years, the society's membership has more than doubled to
2,200 members.
   In an age of ``product parity,'' where soap is soap and there are
a profusion of soaps, Innovation's Siegel says the best way to
identify a new brand in the consumer's mind is to put it in a new
container.
   Syntectics Inc. of Cambridge, Mass., takes a different approach.
An independent outgrowth of consulting giant Arthur D. Little, it
works with company marketers and researchers to create ``an
environment receptive to innovation,'' said senior associate
Josephine Fuller.
   At one problem-solving meeting, Gillette Co. officials pretended
to be strands of hair, and were asked how they felt, Ms. Fuller
said. The role-play was part of a marketing strategy for Silkience
conditioning shampoo.
   At a brainstorming session to come up with vandal-resistant pay
phones for New York Telephone Co., participants thought of
indestructible things in nature. Mount Rushmore inspired phones
built into the sides of buildings.

<TEXT>
   Robert Noyce watched the technology he
helped create slip across the Pacific and is fighting to rekindle
America's brainpower in the war for economic survival.
   Noyce, 61, has come to Texas' capital from Silicon Valley, where
he co-invented the integrated circuit and helped found Intel Corp.,
a giant of the U.S. chip industry.
   Last year, Noyce became the first chief executive of Sematech, a
joint industry-government effort to reclaim U.S. dominance in the
$45 billion semiconductor industry by 1993.
   Noyce's rallying cry is national security, both militarily and
economically.
   In the last 10 years, Japan has almost taken over the
semiconductor business. U.S. market share fell from about 55 percent
to 40 percent from 1984 to 1987, the Commerce Department estimates.
   Chips are the base of the food chain of electronics, the core
elements in everything from supercomputers to coffee makers.
   The idea behind Sematech is to bring together the best brains in
the United States _ whether they work for National Semiconductor
Corp. or Intel, for International Business Machines Corp. or
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. _ to figure out the best,
fastest, cheapest way to make computer chips.
   ``I fundamentally believe that even if Sematech is a failure, it
will still be a success if we continue to push that sort of
program,'' says G. Dan Hutcheson, president of VLSI Research Inc., a
market research company in San Jose, Calif.
   ``Already you see signs, in terms of some of the product
development,'' Hutcheson said. ``Problems are being solved. There's
enormous improvement in yields.
   ``Since Sematech was started, engineers have started calling each
other and talking,'' he said.
   It is this free-flowing exchange of information, so crucial to
learning and science, that Sematech and other consortia are trying
to encourage.
   The obstacle, however, is historical American reluctance to share
knowledge with a competitor for fear that he'll beat you at your own
game.
   There are detractors. Xerox Corp. Chairman David Kearns said his
company had declined to participate because it did not believe the
level of investment justified the possible return.
   ``I applaud the idea of getting together,'' Kearns said, but he
suggested that smaller, two-company combinations would be more
useful because the results could be more easily tailored to the
participants' needs.
   In addition, a Commerce Department study said the U.S. computer
chip industry will remain faced with trade, tax and antitrust issues
regardless of Sematech's performance.
   Although the report recommends Congress spend $100 million on
Sematech next year, it cautions that such cooperative efforts should
be ``treated with care.''
   Electronics is the nation's largest manufacturing employer, with
more than 2.5 million people, largely in California, Massachusetts,
Minnesota, New York and Texas, the American Electronics Association
says.
   Although companies in Europe have teamed up to form consortiums
like Sematech, it is Japan that has taken the lead and where experts
look for guidance.
   Japan is a ``beautiful example'' of a knowledge-based economy,
says Noyce.
   Sematech, an acronym for Semiconductor Manufacturing Technology,
is a consortium of 14 semiconductor makers and users and the U.S.
government that was created in 1987 to find ways to make
semiconductors faster and better than anyone else.
   Already Sematech has built a ``wafer fabrication'' unit and
manufactured its first silicon wafer. The ``wafer fab,'' built in 32
weeks and producing three days ahead of schedule, is itself a major
accomplishment, Noyce said.
   U.S. companies produced about 85 percent of all silicon wafers in
1984 but just over 20 percent in 1987, Commerce Department figures
show. Sematech's aim is to reverse that trend.
   Across town from Sematech is another consortium, Microelectronics
and Computer Corp., where similar work is done on a broader range of
computer research. Eight companies, including Motorola Inc., Digital
Equipment Corp., NCR Corp., Hewlett-Packard Co. and National
Semiconductor, are members of both consortia.
   Experts claim the United States has lost its edge because of too
much attention to immediate profits at the expense of research and
investment.
   ``Up until the last 15 years ... America was riding high, clearly
the highest standard of living in the world,'' Noyce said.
   Noyce notes that the Japanese success was based on cooperation
among competitors, an anathema in American business that Sematech
hopes to change.
   ``We have to overcome our own idea that we're the superior
race,'' said Hutcheson. ``There are other people out there that are
working harder than we are. They're intelligent, they're innovative,
they're doing everything that we did but somehow forgot.''

<HEAD>Iowa Has a Lot Going for it, But Not All Rural Areas Can Cash In</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN P. ROSENFELD</BYLINE>

   A computer chip factory soon will rise
from a corn field in this community of covered bridges, the
birthplace of John Wayne.
   For Winterset, 45 minutes southwest of Des Moines, it's a chance
to exploit Iowa's reputation for a high literacy rate and a
dedicated, dependable work force.
   For areas of Iowa farther from Des Moines and its amenities, a
high-tech solution to rural poverty and depopulation is more
elusive. The Corn Belt is not making a smooth transition to the
knowledge economy.
   Small towns in Iowa and across the Midwest have found that good
schools and a literate work force _ often touted as keys to success
_ are not enough.
   Would-be employers demand access to good transportation, modern
hospitals, sophisticated cultural and recreation attractions,
shopping malls and ample outside professional help, from lawyers to
CPAs.
   Even when small towns succeed in industrial recruitment, they
don't get all the expected economic benefits.
   New professionals who move in often opt to do their major
shopping during weekend excursions to the big city, says David
Forkenbrock, director of the University of Iowa Public Policy Center.
   ``The best way to strengthen the rural economy may be to put a
barrier in the road to prevent people from going to the big city for
cheaper goods,'' Forkenbrock is fond of saying.
   Even if Iowa does everything right, it should anticipate just
modest growth in its personal income, employment and population over
the next 25 years, research consultants say.
   ``Iowa's agricultural history and its existing industry mix make
it unlikely that the state will become known as a high-tech state,''
says a draft report prepared by the SRI International Center for
Economic Competitiveness at Menlo Park, Calif.
   Still, the report says a ``tradition of quality can be the basis
for Iowa's more competitive, more diverse and balanced economy.''
   In Winterset, a community of 4,000 which stands to gain up to 600
jobs, the courtship of EAC Technologies Inc., a maker of control
panels for appliances, was a community affair.
   As the high school band played ``Happy Days Are Here Again,'' a
crowd representing everyone from the farmer in his bib overalls to
the banker in his business suit celebrated the groundbreaking.
   EAC bought the business from Motorola Inc. It is closing plants
in Taiwan and Texas to build in Iowa, where it also will locate its
headquarters and research and development center.
   Iowa's reputation for good schools and an educated work force
that can cope with technological change were strong selling points.
   Iowa has the highest college entrance exam scores among the 28
states where the American College Testing program is dominant. It
ranks fifth in the nation in high school graduation rates.
   ``We need quality out of a dedicated work force that stays with
us,'' said Tom Phillips, the president of EAC.
   Small town schools produce such students because they are forced
by economics to concentrate on the basics, while students often
suffer in the ``smorgasbord'' programs of bigger school systems,
said Dick Manatt, director of the School Improvement Model projects
at Iowa State.
   In small towns, where everyone knows everyone else, there is
strong peer pressure to succed.
   But a trainable, reliable work force would not have been enough
if Winterset weren't close to Des Moines and its shopping centers,
theaters, museums and airport, Phillips said.
   Promises of cooperation from the microprocessor research center
at Iowa State University and of tailor-made employee training from
the Des Moines Area Community College also were selling points.
   Because of such attractions, the area around Des Moines has been
promoting itself as ``the Golden Circle.'' It's one of the few
sectors of the state that grew in population from 1980 to 1987, when
a sour farm economy caused a flight from rural America.
   ``It's pretty tough for a town that's not on the beaten path at
all to make progress,'' says Thomas Pogue, an economist at the
University of Iowa.
   Shenandoah in southwest Iowa points out that residents can get on
the golf course in five minutes or to the doctor's office in three.
But that approach often is not enough, admitted Day Hacke, the
executive vice president of the Shenandoah Development Corp.
   ``If they want something beyond that, they go somewhere else.
From a competitive standpoint you're going to come up short,'' Hacke
said.
   EAC's Phillips says he had to overcome some reservations before
taking Iowa seriously. He was looking forward to building in the
gentler climate of the South and had visions of North Carolina golf
courses when the search began. He said he thought of Iowa as
``farming, flat and not high-tech.''
   The key was that EAC needed a work force that could be relied on
to grasp new techniques and to show up each day and get the job done.
   Iowa fit that bill.

<HEAD>Pressures Build To Restrict Foreign Students At America's Knowledge
Factories</HEAD>

   Katsura Hattori pushed a button, and the
front page of his newspaper, Asahi Shimbun, appeared on a $40,000
prototype television.
   Even the tiny Japanese script was clearly legible on the
fine-grained screen, 10 times more detailed than a normal TV.
   ``Someday,'' Hattori said, ``this may be how a lot of people read
their newspaper in the morning.''
   If so, most of the groundwork will have been done at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, but the first commercial
users probably will be Japanese companies. Over the past four years,
they have handed MIT millions of dollars and sent top employees like
Hattori to help with the research.
   MIT, Harvard, Texas A&amp;M and a handful of other top U.S. schools
are getting enriched by foreign grants and bolstered by foreign
researchers. But critics say the help carries a high price: Donors
are taking ideas and know-how home, draining a national resource.
   ``I don't know why we permit it,'' said Irwin Freest, an engineer
in Massapequa Park, N.Y., who has been campaigning for Congress to
send foreign engineering students packing.
   ``It hurts us, because what they do with their grants, they take
the knowledge back and sell us goods which increases our balance of
trade deficit,'' he said.
   Foreign companies and governments sponsor about $5 million of
research a year at MIT, which has the highest percentage of foreign
students of any U.S. university. One-fifth of its total student body
and one-third of its graduate students are non-U.S. citizens.
   Two miles up the Charles River at Harvard, foreign sources
provide about $11 million a year for research in economics,
agriculture, medicine and other fields. About 6 percent of Harvard's
undergraduates and 17 percent of its graduate students are
foreigners.
   Alarmed by such statistics, Freest and others are calling for a
kind of academic protectionism _ the erection of barriers to the
free flow of students and knowledge across borders.
   They are not alone; similar pressures are building in other
countries, says Dorothy Zinberg, a faculty member at Harvard's
Kennedy School of Government who is preparing a report on the
subject for the National Science Foundation.
   ``Japan and the Netherlands are today the only two countries that
are actively seeking to increase their numbers of foreign
students,'' she said. ``In the U.S., in France, a bit less so in
West Germany, people are very concerned about losing ideas.''
   Zinberg said some U.S. companies are now attaching strings to
their university grants, insisting that no foreigners be allowed to
work on the research they support. In France, she said, educators
are subtly excluding foreigners from certain schools.
   The University of Rochester's graduate business school rescinded
acceptance of an employee of Fuji Photo Film Co. Ltd. after concerns
were raised by hometown Eastman Kodak Co. It later reoffered
admission, but too late.
   Defenders of the open university see a dire threat in this. They
note that most leading universities in the United States have
policies requiring all campus research to be freely publishable and,
therefore, of at least as much benefit to American companies as to
foreign ones.
   They also say many foreign researchers and graduate students stay
in the United States, strengthening the nation's brainpower.
   Most of all, defenders argue that keeping universities open to
all, based only on academic qualifications, is part of the universal
ethic of science. Insulating ourselves, they say, will make us less
competitive, not more.
   ``It's generally seen today that American universities are among
the best in the world,'' said John Shattuck, Harvard's vice
president for public afairs. ``Our whole higher education system is
very attractive ... and its availability to foreign students is an
asset to American society, because they learn American values and
become familiar with Americans, and Americans are enriched by being
exposed to them.''
   Nationally, less than 1 percent of all university research is
paid for by foreign money. But five big research institutions _
Harvard, MIT, Texas A&amp;M, Oregon State University and the University
of Wisconsin _ together receive more than half of all that money, a
kitty estimated at about $75 million a year.
   Experts say there are about 1 million students circulating from
country to country worldwide, and the largest number, about 350,000,
are in the United States. More than half are in science and
technology, creating extraordinary imbalances, such as the fact that
foreigners now earn about 60 percent of the doctoral degrees granted
in engineering by American universities.
   Like any protectionist move, however, attempts to restrict
foreign students or research projects could be met in kind.
   ``If we're not careful,'' Zinberg said, ``we may one day find our
students shut out of foreign universities, because we have shut them
out of ours.''
   The research that foreigners are supporting on American campuses
runs the gamut from studying aircraft turbines at MIT to ocean
drilling at Texas A&amp;M and weather monitoring at the University of
Wisconsin.
   But much of the pressure to cut back the foreign presence comes
from people in a few highly competitive industries, such as
electronics and biotechnology.
   ``Of course, we'd like people to take back skills and knowledge
and apply them in their own countries, especially the Third World
and countries that aren't as fortunate as we are,'' said Frank Lord,
an engineer with GTE in San Carlos, Calif., and chairman of a
manpower committee for the Institute of Electrical and Electronic
Engineers.
   ``But taking valuable technology is another matter, and it's a
hard line to draw.''

<HEAD>Will Research Fall Victim To Debt In Largest LBO?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARC RICE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Now that RJR Nabisco Inc. has to pay $3 billion a
year in interest on takeover debt, skeptics are wondering whether
the research cookies will crumble at the company that makes Oreos.
   People are scrutinizing the record $25 billion leveraged buyout
of RJR Nabisco to see whether the heavy debts involved in this
trendy form of takeover will hurt companies' spending on new
technology.
   Oreos look simple enough, but getting them to screw apart the
same way every time takes advanced engineering and ovens. In the
knowledge economy, technology is built invisibly into the most
unlikely products, from Ritz Bits to Salem Slims Lights, which come
in an eye-catching, beveled box.
   Shortly before the RJR Nabisco battle, the company told
stockholders it had upped research and development spending by 19
percent. It called technology the cornerstone of future growth.
   Since the buyout led by the New York investment firm Kohlberg
Kravis Roberts &amp; Co., RJR's new management says it remains committed
to research and development but won't say what changes, if any, will
be made.
   R&amp;D is less important in RJR Nabisco's businesses than in, say,
computers or pharmaceuticals. Food and tobacco are two of the
lowest-ranking industries in terms of R&amp;D as a percentage of sales,
according to Business Week's R&amp;D Scoreboard last year.
   Still, analysts say, a stunted R&amp;D program could stop the company
from creating a successful smokeless cigarette, a fat-free frozen
dinner, or crumble-proof packaging for cookies.
   So far, there's little hard evidence to document the effect of
big buyouts on research. Contributing to the dearth of information
is that companies involved in large LBOs tend to go private, and
financial figures become scarce.
   But there is a growing perception that companies cut back on
research immediately after a leveraged buyout. If that's so,
debt-financed megadeals could have a big impact on the knowledge
economy.
   ``What's happening in LBOs is that they take on pretty extensive
debt. In the short term they have to make cuts,'' said Fred Allvine,
a professor in the College of Management at Georgia Institute of
Technology.
   ``Very often, they try to cut the fat out of personnel. Then they
look at research and development _ the benefits are hard to measure.
It's one of the intangibles they cut back because LBOs have to be
concerned with payback in the short run.''
   RJR Nabisco spokeswoman Polly Howes said research is ``continuing
to function. There are new products to develop and improvements to
make. But to speculate on what will happen is premature.''
   The company has major research centers at its Nabisco Brands
Inc., Del Monte Corp. and R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. divisions.
   In its 1987 annual report to shareholders, RJR Nabisco called
research and development essential to the future of the company and
said it had spent $204 million on it in 1987. No figures are
available for 1988.
   Much of RJR Nabisco's recent research and development has been in
plant modernization. It also sank about $200 million into the
development of Premier, the so-called smokeless cigarette that
bombed in test marketing last year. The company has said it will
keep working on a smokeless cigarette.
   The Brookings Institution, the National Science Foundation, the
University of California at Berkeley and the University of Chicago
are among the institutions that have conducted studies looking at
leveraged buyouts.
   ``Legitimate economists are all over the map on this,'' said
Margaret Blair, senior research analyst at Brookings in Washington.
   A NSF study said growth in corporate research and development
spending has ``all but disappeared'' in the last five years. The
increase in leveraged buyouts has been a major reason, the study
said.
   It found a 12.8 percent decline in research and development
spending in companies involved in leveraged buyouts. But Melissa
Pollock of the NSF cautioned against sweeping assumptions based on
the study, noting it looked only at eight small deals for one year,
not enough for definitive conclusions.
   A study of leveraged buyouts released earlier this year by
Kohlberg Kravis disputed the notion that research suffers. But the
study also said buyouts should not involve companies that require a
heavy research investment.

   Gideon Gartner was one of the first to
realize that decision-makers in business wanted more than reams of
undigested facts and figures _ they wanted advice from professional
thinkers.
   Gartner quit his stock picker's job at Oppenheimer &amp; Co. a decade
ago and began offering Wall Street-style insights and
recommendations to buyers and sellers of computer equipment.
   Today Gartner Group is on the leading edge of the knowledge
economy. It's considered one of the top computer-industry think
tanks in the country, with a list of 900 clients that includes 49 of
the top 50 in the Fortune 500.
   Annual revenue has been increasing 50 percent a year and is
expected to reach $62 million this year.
   ``We're in the wisdom business,'' says Gartner, an alumnus of
Massachusetts Institute of Technology and International Business
Machines Corp.
   Gartner, 54 and silver-haired, is a native Israeli who combines
courtly European manners with a preference for casual clothes.
   He spurns suits and pads around his modern headquarters
overlooking Long Island Sound in shirt sleeves, stylish slacks and
walking shoes, which he is constantly pitching to colleagues as more
comfortable than their stiff-leather dress shoes.
   Computer companies such as IBM turn to the Gartner Group's stable
of 80 well-paid analysts for insight on what their competitors are
doing.
   Major computer users like American Express Co. and Pepsico Inc.
rely on the Gartner Group for advice on which computers or software
to choose, whether to lease or buy and whether they are about to pay
too much for systems that will soon be obsolete or are about to fall
in price.
   ``We haven't bought any turkeys that I am aware of since we
started using their services,'' said William P. Dean, director of
technological management services at Pepsico.
   Before Gartner came along, computer-industry watchers like
International Data Corp. pretty much restricted themselves to
publishing encyclopedic reports that didn't provide the distilled,
bottom-line advice that top executives needed to make decisions,
said Portia Isaacson Wright of Colorado-based Future Think Inc., who
follows the business information publishing industry.
   The Gartner Group now controls an estimated 60 percent of that
high-priced market, Gideon Gartner says.
   Gartner had the perfect background to turn the $500
million-a-year business of information publishing upside down,
Wright said.
   He spent seven years at IBM, where he designed systems to measure
how Big Blue was faring against competitors, before landing on Wall
Street, where Institutional Investor magazine rated him the top
individual securities analyst in the technology field between 1972
and 1978.
   An opera buff, Gartner abandoned a career as a French horn player
because it was too much of what he called a ``lost-soul career'' to
suit his engineer-father.
   Gartner discovered at MIT that he didn't really want to be an
engineer, so he stayed on to get his master's degree in business
from MIT's Sloan School of Management.
   ``He really is an extraordinary analyst in just about every
sense,'' Wright said. ``He's highly intuitive, in addition to being
real numbers-oriented.''
   One former colleague tells of the time he and three other Gartner
analysts, using company data bases, spent most of the night
calculating the full impact of a recent IBM price cut. They
discovered the next day that Gartner had arrived at nearly the same
figures by himself, doodling on a yellow legal pad on a flight back
from Europe.
   ``Gideon has more good ideas in 15 minutes than most people have
in 15 years,'' said Thomas J. Crotty, Gartner's first employee, now
retired. ``He's always got a new, ingenious thought. Gideon's
biggest problem is that he is not an implementer.''
   Clients pay up to several hundred thousand dollars a year for the
right to attend the Gartner Group's annual conferences, pick its
analysts' brains and peruse any of the 13 analytical bulletins the
company puts out.
   The analysts, most of them industry veterans, cull information
from computer users and sellers and boil it into incisive
assessments during the freewheeling, sometimes heated weekly
meetings.
   Gartner Group was acquired by Saatchi &amp; Saatchi of Great Britain,
the world's largest advertising agency, for $90 million last year.
   Gartner agreed to stay on as chairman through 1991, and as a
part-time consultant another four years beyond that. His plans are
uncertain.
   ``I could become an analyst again ... I do that pretty well,'' he
said.

   Muscular workers welding the hulls of
mammoth ships used to symbolize American business might. No more.
   Only a handful of U.S. shipbuilders are left, and they are kept
afloat by Navy contracts. The rest have fallen victim to low-wage
competitors in South Korea, Taiwan and Brazil and high-tech,
subsidized shipyards in Japan and West Germany.
   In a knowledge-based economy, the United States may get a second
chance to compete for commercial shipbuilding contracts, at least at
the high-tech end of the industry, where American companies can tap
experience gained from building state-of-the-art warships.
   ``It's pretty difficult to compete with Taiwan if all you're
doing is welding steel,'' said Tom Balfour, marketing vice president
for Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Co., the United States'
largest shipyard. ``We'd be strongest on those ships that require a
greater degree of engineering.''
   There is little unskilled work left in building ships for the
Navy, and shipyard workers are constantly retrained to keep up with
changing techniques and new equipment.
   ``The U.S. is building the most sophisticated warships in the
world,'' says Mitch Steller, a maritime consultant in San Diego.
That fact, he said, ``could be an advantage for sophisticated
commercial ships as well.''
   There are limits to the power of knowledge, though. Shipbuilders
say they also need dollars, in the form of government subsidies to
match those received by shipbuilders in Japan and West Germany.
   The Japanese and West Germans supply their shipbuilders with
millions of dollars in low-cost loans, research and development
funding and tax benefits, says the Shipbuilders Council of America
in Washington.
   Ten years ago, the U.S. shipbuilding industry was the fifth
largest, with about 10 percent of the international market. But when
the Reagan administration cut subsidies in 1981, shipbuilding
declined rapidly.
   Today, no commercial ships are built in the United States. In the
years since 1981, 41 shipyards have closed and others are foundering.
   Survivors are the brawn of the business, large Navy contractors
able to afford major investments in equipment and technology. But
even those companies are concerned about the impact of expected cuts
in Navy contracts.
   A recent study by the Commission on Merchant Marine and Defense
in Washington concluded ``there is clear and growing danger to the
national security in the deterioration of America's maritime
industries.''
   ``There's not a maritime country in the world that doesn't
subsidize its shipbuilding,'' Balfour said. ``In a world with no
subsidies, we could compete.''
   The commission calls for government to jump-start the
shipbuilding industry by financing the design and construction of
commercial ships that are also militarily useful and providing
matching funds for capital improvements of shipyards.
   The plan would cost about $13 billion in the next 11 years, but
would add 244 merchant ships to the nation's fleets, create nearly
100,000 jobs, contribute more than $43 billion to the gross national
product and raise $6 billion in federal taxes, the commission
contends.
   The net cost would be less than $6 billion, the commission said
in a report to President Bush, adding that ``the possible costs of
failing to provide adequate sealift would be much greater.''
   Proponents say that without a commercial shipbuilding industry,
the United States does not have enough ships to carry supplies and
troops in wartime.
   They say if the number of shipyards continues to decline, there
will not be a large enough base of facilities, suppliers and trained
workers to meet the country's military shipbuilding needs.
   Edward Hudgins, director of the conservative Heritage
Foundation's Center for International Growth in Washington, disputes
the need to support a domestic shipbuilding industry.
   ``I just don't see why we would need it if we can buy it
somewhere else more cheaply,'' Hudgins said. ``What we're going to
do is destroy our economy and make ourselves less capable of
defending ourselves.''
   ``This whole idea that defense means being self-sufficient in
everything is an absolutely ruinous policy,'' he said. ``These
companies are not looking out for our security, they're looking out
for themselves.''

   When Bill Daugherty worked as a motor inspector
for Republic Steel Corp., he didn't go out of his way to stay near
the bosses.
   ``You really tried to avoid them,'' he said. ``Somebody told you
to do this. You did it in five minutes, then you went and sat down
until somebody told you to do something else.''
   Even though he worked on equipment, Daugherty was forbidden to
install electrical tubing. That was reserved for another craft.
   What was standard operating procedure for a United Steelworkers
member in the early 1980s is now history for those, like Daugherty,
out on the cutting edge of labor-management relations.
   In the emerging knowledge economy, people like Daugherty are
valued as much for their grasp of the big picture as for their grip
on a Phillips screwdriver.
   The 37-year-old L-S Electrogalvanizing Co. employee roams the
plant now repairing anything electrical. He is encouraged to learn
other crafts. The company pays his tuition for technical courses,
and as his skills improve, so does his pay.
   Daugherty can make a dollar per hour above the average industry
wage to around $13 per hour, or around $27,000 per year. Production
bonuses and overtime can push the annual figure to around $40,000.
   Nobody hides from the bosses anymore. Workers step forward with
ideas to improve operations at the sheet steel coating plant, a
60-40 joint venture of LTV Corp. and Sumitomo Metal Industries of
Japan. In fact, employees are paid to meet regularly with their
managers.
   ``If we don't work with our employees to make them happier and
get more work out of them, we're all doomed,'' said LTV Steel Co.
President David Hoag. ``How can you talk about international
competitiveness when people hate their jobs?''
   Companies such as L-S Electrogalvanizing are actually ahead of
the vaunted Japanese in labor relations, Hoag argues.
   Japanese steel companies haven't advanced beyond the quality
circle, an early form of participative management that employees
here dismiss as a glorified suggestion box.
   Sumitomo officials had to be coaxed to accept the partnership
program, Hoag said.
   ``The Japanese are more autocratic than the Americans ever were.
They have a lot of ways of eliciting suggestions, but ... in the end
the talk doesn't mean a thing,'' he said.
   The 65 employees of L-S Electrogalvanizing, who produce top-grade
galvanized sheet for auto body panels, are pioneers in a 4-year-old
venture in industrial democracy. Dawn is breaking on a realm long
shaded by arrogance, mistrust and retribution.
   ``Everybody knows what's going on. Everybody pulls together,''
said John Gresh, 30, who joined the company two years ago.
   Where the United States once monopolized the world's steelmaking
know-how, just about anybody can make steel these days, and just
about everybody is.
   What's harder to come by is smart steel, the kind L-S
Electrogalvanizing produces. It's made on computer-controlled mills
in less time by fewer people. It's freer of defects, more precise in
composition and monotonously true in its dimensions.
   Smart steel is shaping up as the American steel industry's ticket
into the 21st century. U.S. producers are getting smart with better
technology _ new furnaces, continuous casters and rolling mills that
represent the best thinking in metallurgy.
   With innovations as simple as changing the way workers and bosses
talk to one another, companies are tapping a long-sealed repository
of profitable information, the rank-and-file employee.
   At L-S Electrogalvanizing, a lone process coordinator is often
the only manager on hand, and that person helps the 12 others on
duty to operate the highly automated line.
   Parking spaces are first-come, first-served. Locker rooms are
segregated only by sex. There is one dining room, no time clock and
everyone has a key to the tool room.
   ``It's like being among your friends at school. Not one of us
minds doing clean-up because we pride ourselves on our mill,'' Gresh
said.
   Management handed the workers a study estimating the price of a
chemical engineering project at $90,000, and the workers did it for
$5,000, said operations manager Mike Mueller. ``Our people just
recognize a problem and take it on.''
   Joint union-management committees can change anything except the
financial terms of the contract, including training requirements for
new workers and production goals, which bear on bonuses.
   Although decisions are made by consensus, there has never been an
impasse.
   Work rules are few and simple: ``Be there. Be there on time, and
do what you have to do'' to complete your assignment, said Mueller.
   ``Now we wrap coils like it's Christmastime,'' said Wes Humphrey,
the vice president of Steelworkers Local 9126.
   Overall, the workers so respect management that union officials
proposed that the union's superior production bonus plan be extended
to cover process coordinators, the equivalent of front-line foremen.
   ``They work just like us. They eat dirt with us. They should get
the gravy with us,'' Humphrey said.
   Participative management emerged in the 1980 contract talks and
its popularity grew as the industry lost $12 billion from 1982 to
1986 amid plant closings and the elimintion of more than 100,000
jobs.
   LTV Corp. remains under court protection from creditors under
Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code.
   ``I've seen so much heartache and suffering. It was too
disheartening to just look at and not try to do something about
it,'' said Frank Valenta, a union director.

   The two biggest steelmakers in bankruptcy court
are the two that have done the most to involve employees in managing
plants, says a United Steelworkers official overseeing programs to
improve life in the mills.
   USW International Secretary Edgar Ball gives the top marks to LTV
Steel Co. and Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corp., both reorganizing
under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy laws.
   He recognized LTV for supporting labor management participation
teams, which give employees new authority to solve production and
personnel problems.
   ``LTV just worked all out to make that system work and expand
it,'' Ball said in an interview.
   LTV's joint venture in Cleveland with Sumitomo of Japan, L-S
Electrogalvanizing Co., has an even more progressive arrangement in
which workers are largely unsupervised.
   Their freedom, responsibility and authority is unmatched among
major steelmakers and is among the most progressive anywhere, Ball
said.
   He praised Wheeling-Pittsburgh for its modified system of
labor-management teams.
   A mini-board of directors, staffed equally from management and
the union, oversees operations at the plant and department levels.
On the shop floor, task forces do anything from correct malfunctions
to reorganize production.
   Other steel companies have not come as far, Ball said.
   Armco Inc.'s program was rejected by plant and division managers,
he said.
   National Steel Corp. has a partnership program on paper, but it
encountered resistance at the plant level, he said.
   Bethlehem Steel Corp. and USX Corp. have plant-level programs,
some highly successful, but none at the corporate level, and the two
linger near the back of the pack, he said.
   USS-POSCO Industries Inc., the USX joint venture with Pohang of
South Korea, has labor-management participation teams at its
Pittsburg, Calif., plant, but nothing approaching the LTV-Sumitomo
joint venture, said Robert Guadiana, a USW district director for
California.
   Inland and Nippon of Japan are duplicating the LTV-Sumitomo
partnership at a joint venture under construction at New Carlisle,
Ind., 50 miles east of Gary.
   J&amp;L Specialty Products Corp., a stainless and alloy steelmaker
spun off from LTV, is out front in the specialty steel industry,
Ball said.
   A USW local at the company's Detroit plant, despite internal
union criticism for cooperating with management, has boosted
productivity through ad hoc teams. The company is rewarding workers
with profit-sharing payments that boost annual pay to around
$50,000, Ball said.
   Outside steel, Rockwell International Corp. began a cooperative
program with the USW at its New Castle, Pa., axle plant after
announcing plans to close the facility in 1982 and moving one of its
departments to South Carolina.
   ``It worked so well they not only did not shut the plant, but
brought back the department from South Carolina,'' Ball said.
   Aluminum Co. of America negotiated a participative management
program for a Texas plant in 1977, the first such arrangement
involving the USW, Ball said.
   Other programs have been started by Xerox Corp. and the
Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers at a Rochester, N.Y.,
plant, and by Goodyear Tire Co. at a non-union plant in Lawton, Okla.
   Wheeling-Pitt is enjoying harmony in place of bitter relations
under its traditional system.
   ``There's been a vast improvement,'' said John Kohelis, who left
the company's Steubenville, Ohio, rail car repair shop to become a
full-time facilitator, helping teams carry out projects.
   ``There's greater cooperation, better understanding,'' he said.
``We're doing so well we've broken every major production record in
Wheeling-Pittsburgh's history.''
   At its best, participative management can make die-hard union men
gush with enthusiasm.
   ``I don't care what anybody says. If you give the American worker
the education, the equipment and the opportunity, we'll blow anyone
apart. We've got the greatest work ethic of any country in the
world,'' said Tom Zidec, the 35-year-old president of Steelworkers
Local 9126 at the LTV-Sumitomo joint venture, L-S Electrogalvanizing.
   ``Do I sound optimistic?'' he said. ``People tell me I'm too
happy. I don't love this place, but it's a good job. Better than
before.''

   Patents, the guard dogs of innovation, are
gaining strength and attention as America's first line of defense
against purloined corporate ingenuity.
   An unprecedented number of applications are flooding the U.S.
Patent and Trademark Office, which expects more than 156,000 this
year, up 5 percent from last year.
   Courts are siding more often with holders of patents, trademarks
and copyrights, and the phrase ``intellectual property'' has entered
the lexicon of the emerging knowledge-based economy.
   Why all the interest? Because American industry, from steel to
clothing to microwave ovens, is running scared.
   ``If you're the undisputed leader in some technology, patents are
not that important because you pretty much call the shots. That's
what it was like 30 years ago,'' said Michael Blommer, executive
director of the American Intellectual Property Law Association.
   ``But today, the United States has lost its lead in almost every
technology and patents are becoming much more important. That's
really all you have to protect yourself.''
   Some critics say the pendulum has swung too far toward protecting
patent and copyright holders, stifling progress by preventing
inventors from building on what has come before.
   Others say tough patent protection isn't helping the United
States against technology leaders such as Japan and West Germany.
Eight of the top 10 winners of U.S. patents last year were foreign
companies.
   ``Isn't strengthening the patent system also strengthening the
non-residents?'' asked Ogden Webster, director of Eastman Kodak
Co.'s patent law department.
   One winner in the patent battlefield is Corning Inc., formerly
known as Corning Glass Works, where engineers revolutionized
communications in 1970 with their invention of optical fibers.
   These are hair-thin glass fibers that transport voices, pictures
and data on pulses of laser light. Optical-fiber cables crisscross
the country and the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.
   Corning anticipated billions of dollars in revenue from its
invention. However, other companies were eyeing the potential
market, too.
   Six years after the invention, even before much of the world was
convinced of the usefulness of Corning's creation, the company found
itself trying to enforce its patents.
   Corning sued American, Dutch and Japanese competitors. It even
sued the U.S. government for buying fiber from a competitor. From
July 1976 until earlier this year, the company was immersed in
patent enforcement lawsuits.
   The company won numerous settlements, but Sumitomo Electric
Industries Ltd. of Japan remained a holdout. The Japanese company
even built a factory in Research Triangle Park, N.C., to make fibers.
   Corning won a court order in October 1987 forcing Sumitomo to
stop making optical fiber at its North Carolina plant. Sumitomo was
allowed to make cable but had to get the fiber for it from a
competitor.
   The damage portion of the patent infringement trial is pending.
Today, Corning is the dominant producer.
   ``Corning is a believer in the patent system. It's very much a
part of its research activity. To see it working is good,'' said Al
Michaelsen, Corning's chief patent lawyer.
   The Corning experience is one that politicians and government
officials like to hear.
   ``As we look to the future, our ability to compete successfully
is going to depend on our brainpower, not our brawn,'' said Michael
Kirk, assistant commissioner for external affairs at the U.S. Patent
and Trademark Office.
   A report by the U.S. International Trade Commission last year
estimated U.S. companies lose between $43 billion and $61 billion a
year because of inadequate foreign protection of intellectual
property.
   Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand reportedly have begun to cleanse
their reputations as piracy havens, but South Korea is still a major
offender, the commission says.
   Companies must apply for patents in each country where they want
protection. Rules differ. For instance, Italy refuses to grant
patents to new drugs.
   Japan's patent office takes five years on average to issue a
patent, vs. about 1{ years in the United States, says Donald J.
Quigg, U.S. commissioner of patents and trademarks.
   An American inventor awaiting a patent in Japan has little legal
protection and therefore is almost forced to share the technology
with competitors through cross-licensing agreements, Quigg complains.
   It is much easier for Japanese companies to get patents in the
United States. For example, Hitachi Ltd. won more U.S. patents last
year than any American company.
   Kirk is helping negotiate minimum patent standards in trade talks
involving 100 nations and said he is hopeful an agreement can be
reached by the end of 1990.
   In this country, perhaps the biggest development came in 1982
with the creation of a federal appeals court in Washington devoted
solely to intellectual property disputes.
   ``This court has really turned toward lowering the standard of
patentability and upholding patents,'' said Kodak's Webster. He
should know: The court rejected Kodak's appeal of a guilty verdict
in a suit by Polaroid Corp. that forced it out of instant
photography.
   By aggressively enforcing its patent rights, Texas Instruments
Inc. earned almost as much in royalties in 1987 _ $191 million _ as
it did from operations. Last year, royalties accounted for a quarter
of its profits.
   Lotus Development Corp. and Apple Computer Inc. are facing
criticism for heavy-handed protection of patents on the ``look and
feel'' of their products, such as the Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheet.
   To critics, patents protecting ``look and feel'' are the
equivalent of a patent by General Motors Corp. protecting the
arrangement of the steering wheel, brake and gas pedals on a car.
   Reflecting the turmoil, two-thirds of big companies in the United
States, Canada and Europe are enmeshed in litigation over
intellectual property rights, a Conference Board survey estimates.

<HEAD>3M Scientist A Master At ``Hot Swatch'' _ Turning Ideas Into Products</HEAD>

   An inventive college dropout with a knack
for pleasing customers has shown 3M Co. it doesn't take a lab full
of molecule-minded Ph.D.s to blaze trails in technology.
   Frank Marentic earned his science degree on the workbench,
tinkering his way into the automotive design industry and giving 3M
a foothold there with 18 years of creative work in Detroit.
   He also invented a drag-reduction film known as ``Riblets'' that
helped speed Stars &amp; Stripes to victory in the 1986 America's Cup
yacht race _ a public relations dream for the $10.5 billion
diversified manufacturer.
   ``He's the last of a breed,'' said Clem Nelson, vice president of
3M's Automotive Systems Division. ``I don't think 3M will happen to
see another one like him. Everyone we hire today is from the
classroom.''
   Marentic, 57, is cherished by 3M for his ability to create the
``hot swatch,'' a rough handmade sample of an emerging product.
   ``He's got great hands,'' said William Klein, technical director
of the Industrial Tape Division at 3M. ``A lot of people have ideas,
but we need someone to reduce them to practice.''
   Once an idea is reduced to a ``swatch,'' customers can seek
refinements or quickly drop the idea _ cutting development costs by
shortening the gestation process or sparing the company the expense
of making duds.
   Speed and low cost are important even in research, the lifeblood
of the knowledge economy.
   3M, the Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing Co., spends about 6.5
percent of its revenue on research and development, more than the
industry average. Last year it totaled $689 million.
   ``Research and development is an investment, but they only want
to invest a minimum amount of money for a maximum return,'' said
Terry Morris, a senior development engineer at 3M who has worked
under Marentic since he moved back to the company's Maplewood
headquarters in 1983.
   Marentic said he has a practical streak that makes 3M's financial
restraints easier to accept. But even in the leanest years he said
he has been able to cut loose on risky ventures.
   Riblets, for example, was born from an initial $600 to $1,000
expense that allowed Marentic to meet with Navy researchers who had
theorized that a microscopically fine sawtooth surface could reduce
drag and save fuel. Marentic gave the theory life when he suggested
using a plastic adhesive to create the effect instead of the metal
envisioned by the Navy.
   He unsuccessfully tried to apply it to cars during the energy
crisis and was selling the idea to airplane manufacturers when Stars
&amp; Stripes called.
   The 2{ months he spent in Australia to baby-sit the yacht's hull
were one of the crowning achievements of his career and two years
later he received 3M's highest honor _ the Carlton Award for career
contributions in research.
   Riblets hasn't made money for 3M, but Marentic still champions it
as a potential revenue giant because airplane makers are toying with
it.
   ``If I wouldn't have done this I would have gone into music,''
said Marentic, a former trumpet player whose brother, James, is a
professional jazz artist. ``I like the creativity one has in jazz.
What I do is an extension of that.''
   Nelson said Marentic is a rarity because he rose to division
scientist after joining 3M in 1955 as an entry-level technician. He
had found the University of Minnesota boring and quit during his
freshman year, only to be inspired to pursue a scientific career by
his first 3M boss, Dick Drew, the inventor of Scotch tape.
   ```We spent up to 15 percent of our time pursuing things that
were not related to our job function,'' Marentic said. ``We were
allowed to create.''
   In Detroit from 1968 to 1983, Marentic headed a research lab that
gained the respect of automakers for adding decorative touches to
car bodies. One of his first successes was the horseshoe-shaped
stripe on the side of Ford's 1967 Mustang. He struck gold for 3M and
Pontiac by developing a strong, cost-efficient technology to
emblazon the Firebird emblem on the car's hood.
   ``I think GM made about $11 million off that car and we made a
little bit ourselves,'' Marentic said.
   Jeff Janssen, a senior chemist at 3M, said Marentic has a hidden
talent for sales because he gleans information from customers to
find out what they really want.
   But Janssen agreed with others that Marentic's greatest asset is
his practical creativity.
   ``The molecule guys get too hung up on what they can't do,''
Janssen said. ``That doesn't stop Frank.''

<HEAD>University In Detroit's Shadows Joins Knowledge Economy Battle</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM S. BERGSTROM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When prosperity depends on ideas,
higher-learning institutions such as the University of Michigan
become as important as gritty factory towns were during the
Industrial Revolution.
   Corporate research facilities crowding northeast Ann Arbor are
proof that knowledge today equals power and profits, and college
towns aren't placid bystanders in the brains-over-brawn brawl.
   In recessionary chills of years past, manufacturing-heavy
Michigan caught economic pneumonia. When people delayed big
purchases like cars, Michigan shut down. It happened in the last
downturn, pushing the state's jobless rate as high as 17.3 percent
in December 1982.
   Michigan is hoping to use high technology to diversify the
economy and avoid that jobless jolt the next time a recession comes.
At the same time, there's a statewide effort to make Michigan's big
factories more competitive.
   Success will mean other regions look to Michigan for lessons,
state Commerce Director Doug Ross said.
   With the University of Michigan in the lead, Ann Arbor is a major
source of the technology to restore Michigan's manufacturing might.
   Research facilities now dot the university area and form a
40-mile automation alley along Interstate 94 from Ann Arbor to
Detroit. Their success is reflected in state job figures.
   Employment that hovered around 3.5 million jobs in 1982 topped 4
million in 1986 and has ranged around 4.3 million in 1989, the
highest ever recorded in Michigan.
   The number of jobless, which reached 749,000 in December 1982,
has dipped below 300,000 in two months this year, for the first time
since 1978. Seasonally adjusted employment rates from the U.S.
Bureau of Labor Statistics have dropped as low as 6.1 percent.
   The much-maligned rust belt starts with innate advantages, built
up over time and sometimes not appreciated until a company moves,
said J. Downs Herold, who manages the university's industrial
development research program.
   ``What you have here are a lot of little tool and die shops, and
model makers,'' Herold said. ``The amount of expertise that exists
among these places _ in heat-treating, sandblasting, the ability to
bend and mold metals of all types _ that's an infrastructure you
don't just start out and build.''
   It may seem worthwhile at first to move elsewhere _ for lower
labor costs, for example, Herold said. ``But when you need something
special you don't just run down the street and say, `I wonder if
Charlie can do that.' It's probably the same thing if you're out in
California and want to develop a new electronic chip.''
   To add the advanced technology edge, the university's college of
engineering emphasizes research contracts with auto, chemical,
electronics, computer and aerospace companies including General
Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co., Chrysler Corp. and Dow Chemical Co.,
said Robert W. Schneider, director of corporate relations at the
college.
   Students pursue real-world investigations in their area of
interest, and the research provides material for Ph.D. theses.
Sometimes research leads to post-graduate employment.
   One GM project with the college led to a computer software system
that reschedules plant operations in case of an equipment breakdown
to keep turning out the most-needed products.
   GM has similar programs with other schools such as Rensselaer
Polytechnic Institute in Troy, N.Y., Massachusetts Institute of
Technology in Cambridge, Mass., and Stanford University in Palo
Alto, Calif.
   GM assigns experienced engineers, usually with advanced degrees,
to work with the students, said Jim Caie, director of advanced
manufacturing engineering at GM.
   ``We certainly aren't dummies. We are really in most cases on the
cutting edge of technology,'' he said. ``We need to leverage
ourselves as much as possible _ get good people from the
universities helping us. We can't do it all ourselves.''
   The University of Michigan's intellectual properties office has
expanded from one part-time staffer 10 years ago to 10 people today.
Its royalty income from faculty inventions rose 66 percent in 1987
and another 10 percent last year, to $850,000.
   ``What you're finding is that intellectual property issues are
becoming increasingly important in American business,'' said Bob
Gavin, director of the office. ``That is a function of the United
States recognizing that it has to protect its knowledge because that
is the basis of its future economy.''
   Patented items include a fluid that gets thicker or thinner
depending on an electrical charge applied to it.
   Auto companies are vitally interested in how it could be used in
hydraulics, said Frederick H. Reinhart Jr., marketing director of
the intellectual properties office.
   Besides ideas, ``Ann Arbor has also become the home of an awful
lot of new industries where people get an idea and spin something
off,'' said Herold, the university industrial development official.
   In a coup with a ripple effect, the university also helped lure
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's auto emissions laboratory.
   That led to establishment of a string of laboratories by auto
companies, especially importers, that wanted to tinker with cars
failing to meet U.S. emissions requirements without taking them home.

   Chris Peters stretched for words as he
tried to describe how he makes his living.
   ``It's hard to even explain sometimes what you're thinking when
you're writing a program,'' said Peters, a software developer for
Microsoft Corp. ``You're not thinking in English. It's hard even to
describe the thought process.
   ``You actually are the computer at the point you're writing the
program.''
   Whether or not he can articulate it, Peters can do it. He's one
of just 12 computer programmers who work on the Microsoft Excel
spreadsheet program.
   The bookkeeping program is one of Microsoft's key products, its
weapon for capturing market share from Lotus Development Corp.'s
1-2-3, the best-selling spreadsheet program.
   As much as any modern product, software epitomizes what is meant
by the knowledge economy.
   Microsoft and other software companies' physical products are but
a few dollars' worth of magnetic tape or disks, a manual and a
catchy package.
   What people pay for is the computer code, the abstraction of a
physical process such as record-keeping that allows a computer and
its operator to do complex functions in split seconds.
   The raw materials are the ideas of the companies' programmers and
engineers, marketers and managers. It's what their people know and
how well they can express it that brings in the money.
   Founded just 15 years ago by William Gates and Paul Allen,
Microsoft is now the largest company specializing in personal
computer software.
   Gates and Allen also provided an information-age legend: a couple
of college kids who wrote a language program for a computer they
read about in an electronics magazine, and turned that asset into a
corporation worth hundreds of millions of dollars.
   Gates' stock made him the youngest self-made billionaire ever.
   Programmers all over the country, working at the kitchen table or
small offices, still try to emulate Gates. But in the big leagues,
where programs can reach 450,000 lines of computer code, making
software has long since expanded from a one-brain concoction.
   At Microsoft's headquarters in a fir-shaded suburban Seattle
office park, the workfloor for Excel is a long hallway lined with
compact offices. The wing has the atmosphere of graduate student
cubicles in a large university _ if there's a college where students
can afford BMWs.
   Down the hall is a room with pinball and video games. Standard
office decor is mounds of paper and three to six personal computers.
One programmer, Eddy Fries, has turned an old computer monitor into
a tropical fishbowl.
   The flip side of the frisbees and amateur jugglers who come out
on nice days is an intensity where arguments and egos can flare and
work can go on around the clock to make deadlines.
   That's what comes in a company where ``the norm is near-genius
level and not just in smarts but in creativity and everything
else,'' Peters said.
   ``If you love what you're doing and people say, `Oh, but you're
at work all the time.' Well, yeah, right. This is fun, right?''
   Peters, 31, joined the company in 1981 as the 100th employee, and
is now about 40th in seniority in a company that employs about 3,800.
   What keeps him, he said, is that Microsoft and Gates _ himself a
programmer _ treat software writers ``like prima donnas.''
   Stewart Alsop, publisher of the industry newsletter P.C. Letter,
agrees. While Microsoft executives may give speeches about the need
for industry standards, Alsop says that doesn't stop their own
developers from violating the rules if the program demands it.
   ``They focus on the very essentials of software _ does it do what
people want it to do?''
   Microsoft assigns far fewer programmers to a team than do other
software giants. Where Lotus has 12 to more than 30 programmers
working on versions of 1-2-3, Microsoft's 12-member team creates all
three forms of Excel _ for Apple Macintosh, MS-DOS and OS-2
operating systems _ plus foreign translations.
   Although Lotus' teams are larger, Frank Ingari, vice president
for Lotus' personal spreadsheet computer division, agrees you can't
get quality by designing by committee.
   ``No matter how many are on the team you find a small number who
are the actual architects,'' he said.
   Peters said 95 percent of writing the intricate code that makes a
program work is simply an individual programmer staring at a screen,
puzzling it out until the solution comes. ``He'll sit there and
he'll think real hard. And he might walk around the halls _ he might
find some guy and corner him and just talk at him.''
   Hallways are a big deal at Microsoft, Peters said. ``You work
privately but together. It's kind of weird.''
   Though programmers build new features on blocks of code written
before, and may use programs to edit and search code for bugs,
Peters doesn't put much faith in programs that claim to actually
write software.
   ``No, we do it the old-fashioned way. I mean, what kind of junk
would be generated by a machine?''
   In a way, Peters said, writing software is like designing a
building _ bad code is ``an awful bit of carpentry that won't hold
the roof up.'' It's also like mastering a foreign language _ ``it
takes a few years to even know how to read the stuff and know that
it's good.''
   Or maybe, he said, it's like composing music.
   ``The stuff can be very beautiful, and the funny thing, the user
never sees it,'' Peters said. ``You can look at someone's code and
it will flow. There will just be this elegance to it.''

<HEAD>Dollar Ends Higher, Gold Rises</HEAD>

   The dollar ended mostly higher in Europe on
Wednesday on buying before Thursday's release of U.S. trade figures
for April, which were expected to show an improvement.
   Gold prices also rose.
   Dealers said they saw buying interest in the dollar before the
U.S. trade figures, which were expected to show the trade gap
narrowing to $8.2 billion from $8.9 billion in March.
   But dealers said trading conditions were erratic throughout the
day as a spate of rumors swept the currency markets.
   The most pervasive rumor was that Japan's Finance Ministry had
called in some Japanese institutional investors to hold back on
dollar-buying. Though subsequently denied by the ministry, the story
helped the yen.
   Dealers said favorable U.S. trade figures would likely encourage
further dollar buying, perhaps helping the U.S. currency through key
resistance levels.
   In London, it cost $1.5143 to buy one pound, cheaper than $1.5162
late Tuesday.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Tuesday:
2.0290 West German marks, up from 2.0260; 1.7525 Swiss francs, up
from 1.7520; 6.8690 French francs, up from 6.8675; 2.2805 Dutch
guilders, up from 2.2758; 1,464.50 Italian lire, up from 1,459.25;
1.1993 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2007.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar finished down 0.65 yen at 148.05. Later, in London, it
was quoted at 149.10 yen.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid price of $361.75 a troy ounce,
compared with late Tuesday's $359.50.
   In Zurich, gold rose to close at a bid $361.25 compared with
$358.75 late Tuesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose 74 cents to close at a bid
$362.40.
   Silver bullion prices rose on the London market where the metal
was trading at a late bid price of $5.23 a troy ounce, compared with
Tuesday's $5.20.

   John A. Mulheren Jr., aformer associate of jailed
stock speculator Ivan Boesky named in an alleged plot on Boesky's
life, was charged today with conspiracy and securities fraud in a
42-count federal indictment.
   Mulheren, 39, also was charged with mail fraud, keeping
fraudulent records and fraud against the Internal Revenue Service in
connection with a series of criminal arrangements with Boesky.
   Each of the 42 counts against Mulheren is punishable by up to
five years in prison and a $250,000 fine.
   Mulheren pleaded innocent last month to state weapons possession
charges in New Jersey in connection with an alleged plot on Boesky's
life.
   He is free on bond from a previous federal charge of threatening
a witness stemming from the New Jersey case. U.S. Attorney Benito
Romano said the federal charge would be dropped in favor of the
state weapons possession charges.
   A federal grand jury in Manhattan charged that Mulheren
manipulated the price of Gulf &amp; Western Inc. common stock and
engaged in a series of sham purchases and sales to aid Boesky's
attempt to evade taxes and circumvent securities laws. Gulf &amp;
Western has been renamed Paramount Communications Inc.
   The indictment also charged that Boesky provided Mulheren with
inside information in exchange for Mulheren's assistance.
   Mulheren was a general partner and chief trader of Jamie
Securities, a now-defunct Manhattan investment and arbitrage firm.
   Also indicted was Leonard Destefano, a former trader at Jamie. He
was named on three counts of conspiracy, mail fraud and fraudulent
recordkeeping.
   Boesky triggered a series of Wall Street investigations when he
paid $100 million to settle insider trading charges with the
Securities and Exchange Commission in 1986. He is in the second year
of a three-year jail term at a federal prison in Lompoc, Calif.

<HEAD>Martin S. Davis _ Paramount Chief Has Time Inc. In His Gunsights</HEAD>

   Paramount Communications Inc. boss Martin S.
Davis showed with a dramatic offer for Time Inc. that the folks who
gave us the ``Indiana Jones'' movies can jolt the takeover world
with some hair-raising stunts.
   Davis waited until there were 2{ weeks left before Time was to
vanish into an embrace with Warner Communications Inc. before
launching Paramount's unsolicited $10.7 billion tender offer for
Time.
   The bid enraged Time executives, sent Wall Streeters into a
speculative buying frenzy and forced Time shareholders to weigh
where their loyalties lay.
   In a stinging letter, Time's chairman and chief executive, J.
Richard Munro, said Davis' bid ``smacks more of spite than
strategy.''
   ``You've changed the name of your corporation but not its
character: it's still `engulf and devour','' Munro wrote his
counterpart at the company that until only recently had been called
Gulf &amp; Western Inc.
   The move put the normally media-shy Davis in the middle of a
battle for one of the most revered companies in the American media
business. He declined to be interviewed for this story.
   Unlike many entertainment executives, Davis shuns the celebrity
spotlight. He likes riding horses, tinkering with classic cars and
practicing photography, associates say, and lives quietly in
Connecticut's affluent Fairfield County with his second wife, Luella.
   But he can be tough in the boardroom. He was part of a group of
outside directors at RJR Nabsico Inc. who resisted a $17 billion
management-led buyout offer for the company and got shareholders $25
billion instead.
   Davis was born Feb. 5, 1927 in the Bronx. He quit high school but
eventually returned to get his diploma. He started in the
entertainment business as a teen-age office boy for movie mogul
Samuel Goldwyn.
   Later he worked as a publicity agent for the Allied Artists
studio, and joined Paramount Pictures in 1958 as a director of sales
and marketing. He rose to be chief operating officer.
   Gulf &amp; Western acquired Paramount Pictures in 1966 and Davis
moved to the parent company three years later. He was a top
lieutenant to Chairman Charles Bluhdorn.
   Those were the days when conglomerates were fashionable in
corporate America, epitomized by the far-flung corpocracy Bluhdorn
had assembled.
   Gulf &amp; Western owned companies that made cigars, clothes,
bedding, auto parts, hydraulic presses and coin-operated videogames.
It owned sugar-growing operations in the Dominican Republic, a pair
of horse race tracks and a $900 million securities portfolio.
   It also had operations in entertainment, finance and publishing,
and these would form the core of the company after Bluhdorn died of
a heart attack while returning from the Dominican Republic on Feb.
19, 1983.
   The board of directors selected Davis as chief executive over two
other likely successors to Bluhdorn five days later.
   Irwin Schloss, head of the securities firm Marcus Schloss &amp; Co.
Inc. and a Gulf &amp; Western board member for 28 years, said Bluhdorn
had recognized that ``the Street did not appreciate what he had
built and put together'' and had begun the divestment process.
   But Davis accelerated it, presiding over one of the most
extensive corporate dissections ever.
   He liquidated the stock portfolio from March 1983 through 1984.
   In August 1983, the company began selling 50 businesses with
about $1.3 billion in sales that failed to meet Davis' performance
standards. The sales produced about $360 million by 1984.
   Davis sold the sugar-growing business for $200 million in January
1985 and the consumer and electrical products group for about $1
billion that fall. He sold them because they were cyclical, required
substantial capital, or faced intensifying foreign competition.
   Even as the sales were proceeding, Davis began a stock repurchase
program that retired nearly 46 million shares. He bought publishing
companies like the college textbook publisher Prentice-Hall Inc.,
movie theaters. He got the company more heavily involved in cable
and broadcast television.
   The company's stock price is now trading near $60, vs. $9 the day
before Bluhdorn died.
   Its earnings have more than doubled to $384.7 million, or $3.21 a
share, for 1988 compared with $168.6 million, or $1.09 a share, in
1982.
   In April, Davis disclosed plans to sell Associates First Capital
Corp., taking the company out of the financial services business to
concentrate on publishing and entertainment. The sale is expected to
generate $3 billion or more that may be used in the battle for Time.
   Aides said Davis made the choice to stay with publishing and
entertainment because of the long-lasting profit potential of books,
TV and movies.
   Davis points to Paramount's ``Star Trek'' program that enjoyed a
short run on network TV in 1960s, but has spawned books, five
movies, TV syndication revenue and a new syndicated series.
   Securities analysts who follow Paramount had expected Davis to
buy something big following disclosure of plans to sell The
Associates, a step that he has called ``the culmination of a
six-year strategic transformation.''
   They got it with Paramount's $175-a-share bid for Time on June 7,
only 16 days before Time and Warner shareholders were to vote on the
proposed Time Warner merger.
   If Davis succeeds, he'll have a $7.6 billion company bigger than
foreign media giants such as Bertelsmann of Germany, Hachette of
France and News Corp. of Australia.
   The buyout would come at some cost to shareholders. Davis told
securities analysts Paramount would have no earnings for two years
and ``significantly lower'' dividends if the proposed takeover went
through.
   But he said the chance to buy Time represents ``a
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to maximize Paramount Communications'
long-term potential.''

   Grain and soybean futures bounded to a sharply
higher close Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade following a
National Weather Service 30-day forecast for warmer, drier
conditions in the Midwest.
   Some corn and soybean contracts skyrocketed nearly their
permitted daily limits of 10 cents and 30 cents a bushel
respectively, and soybean oil for July delivery soared its daily
limit of $1 per hundredweight before closing with an 86-cents gain
at $21.08.
   Analysts agreed that Tuesday's 30-day forecast was the catalyst
for the rally, which reversed, at least temporarily, a five-week
trend of falling prices.
   ``Obviously, a lot of people in the trade believe the market was
overdone on the down side and were looking for some excuse to buy,''
said Walter Spilka, a grain-market analyst with Smith Barney, Harris
Upham &amp; Co. in New York.
   At the close, wheat was 1 cent to 6\ cents higher with the
contract for delivery in July at $3.98{ a bushel; corn was 3 cents

<TEXT>
   The 12 European Community countries Wednesday
failed to give their final agreement on regulations directing their
future single market for television programs.
   At least five countries, including Germany, Holland and Belgium,
disagreed with the so-called ``television without borders''
directive that was being submitted for final adoption. A new
discussion of the project was scheduled for next month.
   The EC had adopted the draft directive by a majority in a first
reading two months ago, but some European artists and producers have
since expressed concern that the proposal could result in ``the
invasion of American and Japanese TV programs.''
   The initial draft had set the limit of non-European programs
shown on European screens to 40 percent of all programs, but the
ceiling had later been dropped under the pressure of more liberal
countries.

   Consumers are losing confidence in the nation's
financial institutions and their skepticism is rising about the
government's ability to handle the problem and protect their
deposits, according to a survey released Wednesday.
   The survey sponsored by the banking consulting firm Alex
Sheshunoff &amp; Co. also found a widespread belief that the nation's
thrift crisis will raise personal income taxes and push more banks
and S&amp;Ls into foreign ownership.
   Only 67 percent of the people surveyed last week said they
trusted what financial institutions said about their safety and
soundness. A similar survey in March found 84 percent believed what
the institutions told them.
   During the same period, the level of respondents who believed
what the government told them about the safety of financial
institutions fell to 39 percent from 48 percent.
   ``Even Federal Deposit Insurance is questioned; 28 percent polled
worry about losing money in a financial institution even though it
is insured,''said Sheshunoff. That compared with 18 percent in the
March survey.
   The survey was conducted last week in random telephone interviews
with 308 people nationwide and 308 in Texas, California and New
York. The maximum sampling error was plus or minus 5.6 percent.
   Among other survey results:
   _59 percent of the respondents believed troubled thrifts should
be shut down.
   _70 percent blamed bad judgment, not fraud, for the thrift
industry's problems. However, 77 percent said the government has not
been tough enough in its prosecution.
   _84 percent said banks and thrifts should be regulated in the
same way.
   _47 percent said they knew of the Bush Administration's plan,
currently being debated in Congress, to bail out the thrift
industry. However, 48 percent of those who knew about the plan said
they didn't think the plan would solve the industry's problems.
   _78 percent of the respondents said the thrift crisis would
result in foreigners buying more banks and S&amp;Ls, 73 percent said it
would raise personal income taxes, 62 percent said it would limit
business growth and 47 percent said it would cause their home to
decline in value.
   _8 percent named the thrift crisis as the nation's most important
problem, with the federal deficit topping the list at 42 percent,
followed by the trade deficit and congressional ethics problems.
   Although much of the thrift industry's problems have been in the
southwest and Texas, slightly fewer Texans worry about losing money
than the national average: 28 percent nationally compared with 26
percent in Texas.
   ``Texans have had more experience with financial institutions
that have been closed,'' Sheshunoff said. ``This personal experience
may have shown them that they won't lose their money.''
   But at the same time, 13 percent of Texans have withdrawn money
from banks or thrifts due to the problems in financial institutions,
compared with 11 percent elsewhere.

<TEXT>
   A New York buyout firm Wednesday offered up to
$78.2 million for control of Recognition Equipment Inc., a Texas
company that has been the focus of federal investigations into
bid-rigging at the U.S. Postal Service.
   The tender offer by The Prospect Group Inc. is the second time in
six months the company has made an unsolicited bid for REI. The
previous bid of $12.75 per share was rejected by the company as
``highly conditional.''
   Prospect's later offer, to expire at midnight EDT July 12, is for
$11 per share for up to 7.11 million shares, or 81 percent of the
outstanding stock. Prospect already owns 1.43 million shares, or
14.1 percent, of REI.
   The offer is conditional on Prospect receiving enough shares to
gain control; revocation of the company's shareholders rights;
revocation of limitations placed on mergers by the company's bylaws;
and on financing.
   REI had no immediate comment on the bid.
   REI, former Chairman William G. Moore Jr. and former vice
president Robert W. Reedy have been indicted on charges they
conspiring to rig a bid involving U.S. Postal Service procurement
process to win millions of dollars in contracts for automated
mail-sorting equipment.
   A September trial in Washington is set.
   The indictment says the conspiracy involved a plot to replace
Postmaster General Paul N. Carlin, who was viewed as hostile to REI.
   The conspiracy allegedly included Peter E. Voss, former vice
chairman of the Postal Services' Board of Governors, who is now
serving a four-year prison term for kickback and expense account
fraud and is cooperating in the case.
   After the indictment, REI was suspended from bidding on contracts
for the U.S. Army and Postal Service. The Army suspension has been
lifted, but the Postal Service suspension was renewed last week for
another 120 days.
   Prospect, which lost $4.32 million on $22.6 million in revenues
in the first quarter, recently bought Illinois Central
Transportation Co., a rail freight carrier. Its other interests are
in insurance, consumer and services industries.

<HEAD>Delaware Most Attractive for Manufacturing, Survey Says</HEAD>

   A private annual survey rating state manufacturing
climates got a cool reception Wednesday from some critics, who say
it inaccurately forecasts which locales could attract and maintain
big business.
   State officials in California, for example, which got a No. 22
ranking among the nation's 29 top manufacturing states, were
unimpressed with the 10th annual survey by the international
accounting firm Grant Thornton.
   ``You can't compare a major global economic power (California)
with Nebraska, North Dakota or even Wilmington, Delaware,'' said
Tony Quinn, director of research for California's Department of
Commerce.
   In the Thornton survey, released Wednesday, Delaware replaced New
Hampshire as No. 1 in manufacturing climate among
manufacturing-intensive states. New Hampshire fell to No. 3 behind
Virginia.
   Peter Praetz, manager of the survey, said Delaware topped the
list because of its skilled work force, wage levels and government
policies toward manufacturing.
   Among the 21 lower manufacturing-output states, North Dakota was
first in manufacturing climate due to its low labor costs and good
quality of life, followed in order by South Dakota and Nebraska.
   The rankings were based on 21 factors in five categories: state
and local fiscal policies; unemployment benefits and workers'
compensation levels; labor costs; energy costs and work hours lost
because of strikes; and quality of life.
   But Praetz acknowledged that states such as New Hampshire,
Vermont and Mississippi _ which all usually rank high in the survey
and all are in this year's top 10 among high-manufacturing states _
have not become manufacturing giants.
   And some states ranked low on the list, including No. 21 Illinois
and California, have had significant growth in manufacturing in the
past year, he said.
   The survey designated 29 states as ``manufacturing intensive''
because they have exceeded the national average in manufacturing
shipments or workers over the last four years, according to
Thornton's 205-page report. The remaining 21 states have lighter
concentrations of manufacturing under the same criteria, the report
said.
   The survey found New Hampshire had the best government fiscal
policies, and Mississippi had the nation's lowest wages.
   Hawaii and Alaska were included for the first time in the survey,
which carries a $50 pricetag. The states, both in the ``low
manufacturing intensity'' category, were 13th and 19th respectively.
   The report was criticized by Ford Harding of Chicago-based PH&amp;H
Fantus Inc., a consulting firm that finds new locations for offices,
research laboratories and distribution centers.
   ``The study has little if any value,'' Harding said in a
telephone interview from New York. ``Some of the specific statistics
used in the study do have merit.''
   Harding said companies that are trying to relocate have varying
concerns. A company with a lot of capital may be worried about real
estate costs, while a business with a lot of employees may be
interested in labor expenses.
   ``Each company will have a somewhat different mix,'' he said.
``Trying to use something generic defeats what is important to the
company.''
   Quinn said many important elements of the manufacturing climate
in California were overlooked in the Thornton survey _ the fact that
the state graduates 200,000 students a year, has more scientists and
engineers than any other state and is home to a third of the
nation's high-tech manufacturing.
   But Praetz said the study simply was designed to compare states.
   ``One of the main feedbacks we get is it keeps the concerns of
manufacturers available to people,'' he said. ``The study is also
used by state development agencies and manufacturers to look at
conditions in their states and compare them to other states.''

   President Bush told the president of the
European Commission on Wednesday that he supports a plan to create a
single market out of the 12 European Economic Community nations in
1992.
   Bush met with EC President Jacques Delors at the White House.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater issued a statement
saying Bush ``reaffirmed that a stronger Europe means a stronger
America. He also noted that there will be new challenges as the EC
carries out its single-market program.''
   A source said Bush and Delors discussed how Bush plans to use new
powers to protect U.S. trade and American objections to a proposed
European limit to non-European programs on television.
   The statement said Bush reiterated a recent call for the United
States and the community to ``strengthen their dialogue and
cooperation.''
   It said Bush and Delors discussed implications of the 1992
program, international trade, the ``Uruguay round'' of trade talks
among 96 countries, efforts at reform in the Soviet Union and
Eastern Europe, and ``the urgent need to protect the environment.''
   The United States would work with the EEC nations ``to ensure
that U.S. interests are taken fully into account in the 1992
process,'' the statement said.
   The Bush administration has pressed the EEC to allow U.S.
companies to take part in setting standards for European industry.
U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills has complained repeatedly
about the proposed rule on TV programs.
   Congressmen have voiced fears that closer integration of European
business will mean new barriers to U.S. exports, which European
officials have sought to dispel.
   Delors has been repeating the message to members of Congress and
the administration, with visits Wednesday to Treasury Secretary
Nicholas F. Brady and Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan.

   The stock market finished mixed today after a
choppy session in which blue chips drifted in a narrow range.
   Wall Street analysts said share prices were volatile amid anxiety
ahead of several important economic reports and the so-called
``triple witching hour'' that takes place on Friday.
   Gene Jay Seagle, vice president and director of technical
research at Gruntal Financial Inc., said today's swings reflected
investors preparing their holdings before the triple witching hour,
a quarterly occurrence when the last trading takes place in a set of
expiring options and futures on stock indexes.
   Also weighing on investors minds is the release Thursday of
reports on merchandise trade and industrial production. The
following day reports on consumer prices and housing starts are due.
   ``The market at a time like this has a split personality and
doesn't seem to know what direction it wants to go in,'' said Seagle.

   The Soviet Union has more telephone lines than
all other countries except the United States and Japan, according to
a book released Wednesday.
   Bulgaria is the favorite place for Soviets to call, followed by
Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Yugoslavia, Finland,
Italy, West Germany and Mongolia, according to the The World's
Telephones, a 300-page book published annually by American Telephone
&amp; Telegraph Co.
   The book shows that the United States is the most frequently
called country from 25 nations, including Argentina, Australia,
Brazil, Canada, Cuba, Iceland, Israel, Liberia, Mexico, Panama and
the Philippines.
   The most frequently called countries from the United States are
Canada, Mexico, the United Kingdom, West Germany, Japan, France,
Italy, South Korea, Taiwan and the Dominican Republic.
   Cities with the most phone lines are Tokyo, with 5.32 million;
Paris, with 5.17 million; and New York, with 4.52 million.
   The United States is the clear No. 1 nation in phone lines with
118.4 million, followed by Japan with 50 million and the Soviet
Union with 23.7 million, the book says. Figures are as of Jan. 1,
1988, the most recent that are available around the world.
   In the ranking of countries by the number of phone lines per
capita, the tiny Mediterranean principality of Monaco ranks first
with 82.7 lines per 100 people, followed by Sweden, Denmark, the
Channel Islands, Iceland, Liechtenstein and the United States, which
has 48.1 lines per 100 people.
   Japan is farther down the list at 40.8 lines per 100 people. The
Soviet Union has 9.7, and the landlocked African country of Rwanda
brings up the rear with 0.1 phone per 100 people.

last year, and 136 selling days so far this year, compared with 137
selling days in the corresponding period a year earlier.
   Cars and trucks made in the United States by Honda, Nissan,
Toyota, Mazda and Mitsubishi are counted as domestic and appear in

   Early-June sales of domestically made cars and
light trucks crept up 1.1 percent compared with last year after
automakers extended incentives to entice late-spring buyers, the
companies reported Wednesday.
   The eight major automakers said they sold vehicles at an average
daily rate of 34,994 during the June 1-10 period this year compared
with 34,621 during the same time last year. Car sales were up 1.3
percent and truck sales rose 0.7 percent.
   Analyst David Healy of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. of New York
said the sales pace was higher than he expected. But he said
nonetheless that incentives are having a less pronounced effect on
sales.
   ``The surge that you got this time got sales up temporarily,''
Healy said. ``You used to get a spike when these things came out and
now it's a yawn.''
   General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. had new
incentive programs in effect in early June, replacing those that
began in April. But they apparently failed to attract a significant
number of buyers over last year, when sales ran a little below what
proved to be the annual trend.
   Ford's early-June car sales rose, while sales at GM and Chrysler
fell. Conversely, light truck sales rose at GM and Chrysler and fell
at Ford.
   So far this year, car and truck sales by the eight domestic
makers were running 3.3 percent behind the pace of last year, the
second-best sales year on record.
   Ford said its early June car sales were up 5.2 percent, going to
an average rate of 6,834 this year from 6,496 last year. Light truck
sales during the period were 3.9 percent behind last year.
   For the year, Ford's car sales were off 0.8 percent and truck
sales were down 2.9 percent.
   GM said its car sales in early June were 0.7 percent below last
year's, going to a daily rate of 11,113 from 11,191. Truck sales
during the period ran 3.8 percent ahead of last year.
   GM's car sales through June 10 this year were 8.5 percent behind
last year and truck sales were off 1.3 percent.
   Chrysler's average sales of 2,880 cars a day during early June
were down 6.7 percent from last year's 3,087. Chrysler's trucks sold
in early June at a rate 4.6 percent above the 1988 period.
   Chrysler's car sales so far this year were off 13.9 percent but
truck sales were up 0.7 percent.

   Crude and heating oil futures rose Wednesday
after the release of weekly statistics that showed a decline in oil
inventories.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the July contract for West
Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude oil, gained 89
cents to close at $20.23 a barrel. Contracts for delivery after July
showed smaller gains, with the August contract advancing 52 cents to
$18.70 a barrel.
   Among refined products, July heating oil rose 1.07 cents to 45.65
cents a gallon. Contracts for delivery later in the year also
advanced.
   Unleaded gasoline futures, meanwhile, ended the day mixed. The
contract for July delivery remained unchanged at 59.92 cents a
gallon. Contracts for delivery through November declined, while
later contracts rose slightly.
   Analysts attributed the gains in West Texas Intermediate futures
to continued strong demand in the face of tightening supplies and to
technical factors and weekly inventory statistics from the American
Petroleum Institute.
   The API report, released after the close of trading Tuesday,
showed that crude stocks fell 2.9 million barrels last week to
341.94 million barrels.
   The July crude contract also got a boost from buyers anticipating
the contract's expiration next Tuesday, brokers said.
   The API report showed that heating oil inventories fell 423,000
barrels last week, while total gasoline stocks were down 941,000
barrels.
   Analysts said a decline in demand for unleaded gasoline from some
overseas markets helped dampen prices.
   ``Gasoline is under pressure partly because the European market
is amply supplied,'' said Randall Rothenberg, energy broker with
Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.

<HEAD>Corn, Soybean Futures Skyrocket on Drier Outlook</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A forecast for warmer, drier weather in the Midwest sent buyers
swarming back to the grain markets Wednesday, giving corn and
soybean futures prices their biggest one-day boost in nearly 10
months.
   ``It was exciting,'' said Pat O'Connell, an analyst with
Chicago-based Refco Inc. who watched the feverish trading from the
floor of the Chicago Board of Trade.
   On other markets, crude-oil futures surged on supply jitters;
precious metals advanced; and livestock and meat futures were mixed.
   Soybeans for July delivery on the Board of Trade soared the
permitted daily limit of 30 cents a bushel shortly before the close
but finished with a gain of 28{ cents at $7.29{ a bushel. Other
soybean contracts settled 17 cents to 21} cents higher.
   The strongest corn contract, for July 1990 delivery, settled 9\
cents higher, just } cent shy of the daily limit in that market.
Other contracts advanced from 3\ cents to 9 cents with the price for
July 1989 delivery settling at $2.56} a bushel.
   For both commodities, the gains marked the sharpest single-day
rally since last Aug. 24, when the grain markets were reeling from
the worst Midwestern drought in 50 years.
   Wheat settled 1 cent to 6{ cents higher with July at $3.98} a
bushel; oats were 5\ cents to 5} cents higher with July at $1.67\ a
bushel.
   Experts cited a slew of supportive factors, but agreed that the
catalyst for the rally was Tuesday's 30-day National Weather Service
forecast predicting warmer, drier weather in the Corn Belt through
mid-July.
   Corn and soybean prices had been dropping steadily since early
May as spring rains washed away fears of a second year of drought.
   ``Obviously, a lot of people in the trade believe the market was
overdone on the downside and were looking for some excuse to buy,''
said Walter Spilka, a grain-market analyst with Smith Barney, Harris
Upham &amp; Co. in New York.
   Other bullish fundamentals, including signs of strong export
demand and a producer-led attempt to shut down Brazilian soybean
sales as an economic protest, ``just added more fuel to the fire,''
Spilka said.
   A National Weather Service six-to-10-day forecast issued after
Wednesday's close predicted warmer- and drier-than-normal conditions
in the Midwest during the middle of next week.
   Despite the recent rain, soil moisture remains low in some parts
of the Corn Belt, most notably in southern Iowa.
   ``If we continue to jeopardize the crop with these weather
forecasts, we could probably take November beans'' _ now around
$6.45 a bushel _ ``out toward $6.70,'' said O'Connell. ``And who
knows, if the weather gets inflammatory, we could go a lot higher.''
   Crude oil for near-term delivery spurted above $20 a barrel on
the New York Mercantile Exchange on supply jitters linked to
Tuesday's weekly American Petroleum Institute report of a
2.9-million-barrel drawdown in U.S. stocks.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 9 cents to 89 cents
higher with July at $20.23 a barrel; heating oil was .73 cent to
1.07 cents higher with July at 45.65 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .44 cent lower to .02 cent higher with July at 59.92
cents a gallon.
   Gold edged up for the second straight day on New York's Commodity
Exchange, settling 60 cents to 70 cents higher with August at
$367.50 a troy ounce. Silver finished 3 cents to 3.1 cents higher
with July at $5.28 a troy ounce.
   Livestock and meat futures were mixed on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange as traders turned cautious ahead of Friday's monthly
Agriculture Department tally of cattle on feed in the seven largest
producer states.
   Live cattle settled .02 cent lower to .45 cent higher with June
at 71.10 cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged to .37 cent
lower with August at 80.45 cents a pound; live hogs were .35 cent
lower to .13 cent higher with June at 47.30 cents a pound; frozen
pork bellies were .02 cent to .82 cent lower with July at 33.70
cents a pound.

<HEAD>Aeroflot Launches First Major U.S. Marketing Campaign</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserGraphic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Urging Americans to ``come experience glasnost,''
the Soviet national airline Aeroflot is launching its first major
marketing campaign in the United States.
   Aeroflot, the world's largest airline, said Wednesday it
increased its flights from New York and Washington to Moscow from
five a week to eight as of June 5. The Soviets said they also plan
to build about 25 new hotels in the next two years to handle the
increase in foreign tourists.
   To make the plan work, airline officials told a news conference,
Aeroflot also would have to work to improve its reputation for bad
service and inefficiency.
   ``It was difficult or terrible before to reach Aeroflot (by
phone),'' said George Terentiev, commercial manager for Aeroflot in
the United States.
   ``Aeroflot recognizes we have a way to go to earn your
confidence,'' he said. ``Unlike (Donald) Trump, we know it's hard to
build a great airline overnight.''
   Some 125,000 Americans visited the Soviet Union last year, up
from 110,000 in 1987 and 25,000 in 1980, when relations between the
two countries hit a low point, according to Anatoly Matytsin, U.S.
general manager for Intourist, the Soviet tourism organization.
   Aeroflot officials told a news conference they plan to start an
advertising campaign in U.S. travel publications and national
newspapers later this year. The airline has set up a new U.S.
reservation center and a toll-free telephone line for booking
Aeroflot flights and rooms at the Ukraine Hotel in Moscow.
   About a year ago, Aeroflot and Pan Am Corp. started jointly
operating non-stop flights on Boeing 747s between New York and
Moscow. Four of the eight weekly flights now available to Moscow are
operated by the joint venture. The other four, two from New York to
Moscow and two from Washington to Moscow, are run by Aeroflot on
Soviet-made Ilyushin-62 aircraft.
   Round-trip, economy-class tickets from New York to Moscow cost
about $1,000 if purchased at least 21 days in advance. It normally
takes about two weeks to get a Soviet tourist visa.
   Terentiev's joking reference to Trump, the billionaire developer
who purchased Eastern Airlines' Northeast shuttle service,
characterized the atmosphere at Aeroflot's news conference. There,
the Soviets tried to appear both fun and business-minded, possibly
trying to dispel the stereotype of grim, forbidding Soviet
bureaucrats.
   ``We discovered the American marketing concept,'' Terentiev said.
He said Aeroflot was undertaking its new initiative ``in the spirit
of consumer-driven free enterprise and the not-so-gentle prodding of
our leader Mikhail Gorbachev.''
   The Soviets weren't as forthcoming with background facts about
the airline or its marketing. They declined to reveal how much
Aeroflot plans to spend on its U.S. advertising, which is being
handled by Kelley Swofford Advertising of Miami.
   When asked the size of Aeroflot's fleet and the number of
employees, Vladimir Kourkov, the airline's general manager for North
America, shrugged and replied, ``No one really knows.''
   ``Who needs to count?'' Terentiev said.
   Kourkov did say Aeroflot carried 124 million passengers and 3.3
million tons of cargo last year to 3,600 destinations in the Soviet
Union and around the world.
   ``Their marketing awareness has soared with their joint venture''
with Pan Am, said Susan Kelley, president of Kelley Swofford.
   ``Service will be top on their list'' of priorities and a special
effort will be made to attract U.S. business travelers, Ms. Kelley
said.

   The stock market finished mixed Wednesday with
various price measures posting minor changes after a session of
cautious trading.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials meandered around the
2,500 mark all day before closing at 2,503.36, off 0.18.
   In the broader market, losers and gainers ended almost even after
exchanging the lead numerous times. Advancing issues outnumbered
declining ones by 20 issues in nationwide trading of New York Stock
Exchange-listed stocks, with 745 up, 725 down and 517 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 170.54 million
shares, up from 164.87 million in the previous session.
   An attitude of uncertainty prevailed in the market as investors
awaited a series of economic statistics due Thursday and Friday.
   They hope a clearer economic picture will emerge so they can form
judgments about the outlook for interest rates, inflation and the
dollar.
   Reports on merchandise trade and industrial production will be
released Thursday. Release of the Consumer Price Index is scheduled
for Friday.
   Nervousness about the possible impact of the ``triple witching
hour'' on Friday also has lowered the activity level on Wall Street.

   Speculators gave the dollar's early summer rally
a fresh push Wednesday in advance of a government report Thursday on
the U.S. trade deficit.
   The rally gained strength late in the day after wavering in Asian
and European trading. The dollar soared past 2.03 West German marks
in spite of attempts by the Federal Reserve to keep it below that
level through dollar sales.
   ``To be short dollars these days is like committing suicide,''
said Gary Lutnick, a currency trader at Banco di Sicilia in New York.
   Since the end of April the dollar has risen 13 percent against
the Japanese yen, 8 percent against the West German mark and 11
percent against the British pound.
   The rally has broken a long period of relative stability and
brought the dollar back to levels of 1987 and late 1986.
   The strong dollar increases the spending power of Americans'
money but could hurt the economy in the long run by making
American-made goods more expensive in world markets, worsening the
U.S. trade deficit. The dollar's ascent in the early 1980s partly
was blamed for throwing American factory workers out of their jobs.
   Fueling the dollar's rise Wednesday was speculation that the
Commerce Department would report an April merchandise trade deficit
of $6 billion to $8 billion, down from $8.9 billion in March, said
John Lyman, a senior currency dealer for the Bank of Tokyo in New
York.
   It would take more than a year for the full impact of the
dollar's recent rise to show up in deteriorating trade figures.
   Speculators accumulated dollars for their own accounts Wednesday,
hoping they would rise in value because of a favorable trade report,
Lyman said.
   However, the bloated dollar holdings could send the market lower
if the trade deficit turned out to be much larger than expected and
speculators sold the currency.
   In London, the pound fell to $1.5143 from $1.5162 late Tuesday.
Later in New York, sterling fell to $1.5120 from $1.5270 on Tuesday.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar finished down 0.65 yen at 148.05 yen. Later, in London,
the dollar was quoted at 149.10 yen. In New York the dollar rose to
149.45 yen from late Tuesday's 147.75 yen.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Tuesday's
rates, included: 2.0347 West German marks, up from 2.0140; 1.7555
Swiss francs, up from 1.7385; 1.2001 Canadian dollars, up from
1.1997; 6.8945 Frenc francs, up from 6.8270; and 1,470.00 Italian
lire, up from 1,455.00.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Tuesday's
rates, included: 2.0290 West German marks, up from 2.0260; 1.7525
Swiss francs, up from 1.7520; 6.8690 French francs, up from 6.8675;
2.2805 Dutch guilders, up from 2.2758; 1,464.50 Italian lire, up
from 1,459.25; 1.1993 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2007.
   Gold prices rose in most markets, then fell late in the day. In
Hong Kong, gold rose 74 cents a troy ounce to close at a bid of
$362.40.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid of $361.75 an ounce from late
Tuesday's $359.50. In Zurich, gold rose to a bid of $361.25 from
$358.75 late Tuesday.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery rose to $363.80 a troy ounce from $363.10. Later, Republic
National Bank of New York said gold was bid at $361.70 an ounce as
of 4 p.m. EDT, down from $362.20 late Tuesday.
   Silver bullion prices rose on the London market to a late bid of
$5.23 a troy ounce from Tuesday's $5.20. On New York's Comex, silver
bullion for current delivery rose to $5.255 a troy ounce from $5.224
on Tuesday.

<HEAD>Saatchi's Profit Sinks 72 Percent, Considers Sale Of Consultancy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Saatchi &amp; Saatchi PLC, the world's largest
advertising group, said Wednesday its after-tax profit sank 72
percent in the first half of the year because of higher costs and a
sluggish ad market.
   The company also said it was considering selling its consulting
business, which analysts said could fetch between $380 million and
$456 million.
   Saatchi said after-tax profit in the six months ended March 31
fell to 10.6 million pounds, or $16 million, from 37.8 million
pounds in the same period a year earlier.
   Per-share profit came to 1 penny, or 1.5 cents, vs. 22.2 pence a
year earlier.
   The latest results reflected an exceptional loss of 2.9 million
pounds, or $4.4 million, as a result of charges for reorganization
costs, Saatchi said.
   Pre-tax profit fell 57 percent to 22.9 million pounds, or $35
million, from 53.5 million pounds a year earlier.
   Six-month sales rose 8 percent to 2.06 billion pounds, or $3.1
billion, from 1.9 billion pounds a year earlier.
   The company said that costs in the group ``have been growing
ahead of revenues and are too high, particularly in a period of
slower advertising growth.''
   Over the last six months, the company conducted a large-scale
reorganization under which 40 units were merged. During this
process, cost control weakened as managers concentrated on welding
businesses together, Saatchi said.
   Now, the company said it can turn its attention to operational
management and cost control measures.
   Saatchi said it recently received some unsolicited approaches
concerning its consulting unit.
   Although there were good growth prospects in consulting, the
company said it was ``inappropriate under current market conditions
to maintain our aim for world market leadership in this sector.''
   Saatchi said it also would investigate the possibility of
floating the consultancy business as a separate, publicly listed
company.
   Consulting trading profits fell to 7.7 million pounds, or $12
million, during the six months from 8.8 million pounds a year
earlier, while trading profit from the communications unit dipped to
22.3 million pounds, or $34 million, from 41.8 million pounds.
   Trading profit is earnings before taxes and exceptional charges.
   Saatchi said it expects ``a strong recovery'' in the second half
of its fiscal year, but that 1989 would remain ``a tough year.''

<HEAD>Administration To Widen Attack on Forest Product Barriers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LES BLUMENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration has decided to attack
Japanese trade barriers to U.S. forest products on a broader front
than initially indicated, two congressmen said Wednesday.
   Rep. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., and Sen. Bob Packwood, R-Ore., said they
the U.S. Trade Representative's office told them President Bush will
look at a range of Japanese barriers as it considers action that
could lead to sanctions.
   The U.S. forest products industry estimates that exports to Japan
could increase by $1.2 billion if restrictions are lifted.
   Bush announced late last month that Japan was being singled out
for using certain ``technical standards'' to block imports of
American forest products.
   In making the announcement, Bush triggered the so-called ``Super
301'' provisions of last year's trade bill that call for
investigating a foreign country's unfair trade practices.
   The bill also calls for sanctions if the dispute is not resolved
after 18 months of negotiations.
   Packwood, Wyden and others launched a campaign aimed at
convincing U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills that other Japanese
barriers to U.S. wood products should also be reviewed.
   The administration will publish in the Federal Register on Friday
information outlining a broader case against the Japanese on forest
products, the two lawmakers said.
   Among the issues the administration will now consider are:
   _Japanese escalating tariffs in which manufactured products face
higher duties than such imports as raw logs.
   _Japanese building and fire codes such as one that requires the
use of nails that crack American-made plywood.
   _Subsidies, grants and tax provisions aimed at bolstering Japan's
domestic forest products industry.
   _Misclassification for tariff purposes by Japan of such products
as glulam beams and laminated lumber.
   _Internal distribution agreements used by the Japanese to keep
foreign building products out of their market.

<HEAD>Dukakis Supports Curb on Corporate Takeovers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DIAMOND</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Massachusetts Gov. Michael S. Dukakis backed
legislation Wednesday designed to separate ``bad'' corporate
takeovers from ``good'' ones and to force raiders in Massachusetts
to pay some of the social costs of their actions.
   The bill is the product of a study commission that worked over
the past year. In Wednesday's Commerce and Labor committee hearing,
it won the support of both business and labor representatives.
   Massachusetts has been unusually active in hostile takeovers with
recent battles raging over Polaroid Corp., Prime Computer Inc. and
Dunkin' Donuts Inc.
   The proposal calls for a three-year asset freeze to deter
underfinanced and overly leveraged buyouts that rely on the buyout
target's own corporate assets as collateral. Acquiring companies
would have to honor all collective bargaining agreements and pay
severance to laid off workers.
   ``This bill is designed to deter the hostile, debt-financed
takeovers that often lead to major layoffs and the bust-up of
productive companies,'' Dukakis told the committee. ``These
transactions are abuses of the takeover mechanism which do nothing
but make a few speculators rich at the expense of many.''
   Dukakis emphasized that the state does not want to stand in the
way of mergers and takeovers that make companies more efficient and
competitive.
   ``Most takeovers are not bad,'' Dukakis said. ``But abusive and
excessive takeovers which use target assets as collateral for
financing or require massive layoffs to pay debt service are bad.''
   In some recent takeovers, shareholders have been able to sue
corporate directors on grounds that they neglected shareholder
interests in rejecting a buyout.
   A proposal included in the Dukakis bill would allow directors to
consider the short- and long-term interests of employees, customers
and the community as well as that of shareholders.
   Grady Hedgespeth, state secretary of economic affairs and the
co-chairman of the takeover commission, said the provision will
allow companies to be less cautious in deciding to reject a buyout
bid.
   Wallace Whitney, general counsel of Norton Co., a Worcester-based
abrasives manufacturer, said that stockholders should not be the top
priority in takeover fights.
   ``Shareholders are increasingly institutional investors looking
for a quick profit,'' Whitney said. ``It is important to note what
this does not do. It does not entrench management. What it does do
is require a greater balance between competing interests.''
   Among those testifying in support of the bill were Bill Connolly,
chief steward of the Eastern Airlines machinists union, which has
been on strike for more than 100 days.
   ``When Frank Lorenzo took over Eastern it was a friendly merger.
Over the next three years, 13,000 people lost their jobs,'' Connolly
said. ``This bill would have helped alleviate all the suffering all
those employees went through.''

<HEAD>Ex-Trader Indicted for Securities Fraud in Alleged Scheme With Boesky</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Wall Street financier John A. Mulheren
Jr., already accused of plotting to kill Ivan F. Boesky, was charged
Wednesday with engaging in a series of illegal securities fraud
schemes with the jailed stock speculator.
   A 42-count federal indictment charged Mulheren with manipulating
the price of Gulf &amp; Western Inc. common stock to assist Boesky,
whose 1986 guilty plea triggered a series of Wall Street fraud
investigations.
   Mulheren also was accused of plotting a series of sham stock
transactions to help Boesky companies evade taxes and circumvent
securities laws in what prosecutors called ``a classic case of
parking'' securities.
   Specifically, Mulheren, 39, of Rumson, N.J., was charged with
conspiracy, securities fraud, mail fraud and keeping fraudulent
records. He faces a maximum five years in prison and $250,000 fine
on each of the 42 counts.
   Last month, Mulheren pleaded innocent in New Jersey to state
weapons possession charges in connection with an alleged plot on
Boesky's life. Mulheren was arrested in February 1988 near his home
with a loaded semi-automatic rifle local authorities alleged he
planned to use against Boesky.
   He remains free on $20 million bond for a previous federal charge
of threatening a witness stemming from the New Jersey case. Federal
officials have never identified the alleged target, but New Jersey
police have said it was Boesky.
   U.S. Attorney Benito Romano said the federal charge of
threatening a witness would be dropped Friday in favor of the state
weapons possession charges.
   ``We are content, for now, to pursue the securities charges and
have the Monmouth County prosecutors office pursue the state charges
arising from possession of a weapon,'' Romano told a news conference.
   Mulheren's lawyer, Thomas Puccio, said his client ``intends to
plead not guilty and go to trial. This position has been stated on a
number of cases.''
   Puccio added: ``In my view, the charges _ like Ivan Boesky's
credibility _ don't get any better with age.''
   Mulheren was a general partner and chief trader at Jamie
Securities, a now-defunct Manhattan investment and arbitrage firm.
   Also indicted Wednesday was Leonard DeStefano, 32, a former
trader at Jamie. He was named on three counts of conspiracy, mail
fraud and fraudulent recordkeeping.
   Prosecutors said Mulheren aided Boesky because his risk arbitrage
business ``stood to gain from non-public information'' supplied by
Boesky, once one of Wall Street's top speculators in the stock of
takeover targets.
   Boesky paid $100 million to settle insider trading charges with
the SEC in 1986 and pleaded guilty to a single felony count. He is
in the second year of a three-year jail term at a federal prison in
Lompoc, Calif. Boesky's confessions led to a series of major Wall
Street fraud investigations.
   Romano would not divulge what inside information Boesky allegedly
gave Mulheren.
   The indictment charged that in October 1985, Mulheren helped
Boesky manipulate the price of common stock of Gulf &amp; Western, which
has since been renamed Paramount Communications Inc.
   According to the indictment, on Oct. 16, 1985 ,Gulf &amp; Western _
which was in the midst of a 12 million share stock repurchase _
agreed to buy a block of stock from Boesky, but only if the market
price rose to $45 per share. At the time, Gulf &amp; Western's stock was
trading at $44.75.
   The next day, the indictment charged, Mulheren at Boesky's
instigation made several large purchases of Gulf &amp; Western stock
within a six-minute period, driving up the price to $45 per share.
   Seven minutes after the final Mulheren purchase, Gulf &amp; Western
bought 3.4 million shares of its own stock from Boesky and 3.2
million from an unidentified investor for $45 per share.
   The indictment also charged that Mulheren and DeStefano schemed
with employees of Boesky's now-defunct Seemala Corp. to engage in a
series of sham stock transactions, enabling Seemala to evade taxes
and circumvent mimimum capital limits required of broker-dealers by
the Securities and Exchange Commission.
   Romano called the schemes to conceal the stock's true ownership
``a classic case of parking.''
   When stocks are illegally parked to conceal their true ownership,
an investor sells them with an understanding the buyer will return
them, usually at a specified date and price. The ruse is often used
to avoid disclosing a 5 percent stake in a company to conceal
possible takeover interest.
   ``The ultimate objective may be slightly different, but the
concealment aspects are very typical of a parking scheme,'' Romano
said.

<TEXT>
   The Democratic-controlled House failed
Wednesday to override President Bush's veto of legislation to raise
the minimum wage, giving the White House a win in its first
legislative clash with Congress.
   House members voted 247-178 to override, but that was well shy of
the two-thirds needed, so Bush's veto stands. The bill would have
increased the hourly minimum wage from $3.35 to $4.55 by October
1991.
   Defeated but defiant, Democrats moved immediately to renew the
fight, which has taken on political symbolism beyond the partisan
differences over the minimum wage.
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy introduced a bill identical to the one
Bush vetoed, and a leading House Democrat was preparing a revised
bill as well, still out of line with Bush's demands.
   ``The president should understand that this is an issue on which
Congress has just begun to fight,'' said Kennedy.
   Republicans quickly countered the Democrats, introducing a new
minimum-wage proposal of their own that also included a modest
expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit available to families with
young children.
   Bush, the first veto of his administration sustained, said his
offer to raise the minimum to $4.25 an hour by 1992 remained on the
table, provided employers could pay new workers a lower wage for six
months.
   ``The Congress should enact the president's minimum wage proposal
at the earliest opportunity,'' Bush spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said
shortly after the House vote.
   Through Fitzwater, the president said he would not compromise
with congressional Democrats. ``The president's proposal is firm,''
Fitzwater said.
   Equally firm, Democrats said, was their resolve to end the
eight-year freeze in the minimum wage.
   ``I would prefer to work out an acceptable compromise with the
administration,'' said Kennedy, D-Mass. ``But if that is not
possible, we will try to enact a measure that has the support of a
veto-proof majority.''
   Before the House vote, supporters of the vetoed measure pleaded
with conservative Democrats who opposed the measure to switch sides
and join the party's new House leaders in their first major
legislative clash with Bush.
   ``We have a moral obligation and a mission to come here today and
override this veto,'' said Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga. ``The president's
veto of the minimum wage bill sends the wrong message. It is not in
keeping with his promise of a kind and gentle nation.''
   But Republicans defended the veto, saying the Democrats' bill
would result in job losses and thus hurt the working poor it was
designed to help.
   Rep. Robert S. Walker, R-Pa., challenging Democratic assertions
that Bush's veto had proven his loyalty to the rich and
insensitivity to the poor, said a vote to sustain Bush's veto was
``a vote on the side of low-income people.''
   Even as the debate unfolded, both sides prepared for the next
round of the fight.
   Kennedy said he considered his bill a starting point for
negotiations with the administration. But the senator, chairman of
the Labor Committee, said that if Bush refused to give ground he
would ask the panel to move quickly on the measure and send it to
the full Senate early next month.
   In the House, Rep. Augustus Hawkins, D-Calif., was seeking
agreement with other supporters on a revised bill. Chief among the
options being considered by Hawkins was increasing the minimum wage
to $4.25 an hour within two years.
   That would result in a final target in line with Bush's but bring
the minimum wage to the level a year earlier than Bush favors.
   More significantly, however, Hawkins said he was not prepared to
meet Bush's demand for the six-month subminimum, a provision the
president has said must be in any minimum-wage legislation that he
would sign.
   As for the new House Republican proposal, its final minimum-wage
target matched that called for by Bush. It sought the middle ground
in the fight over establishing a new subminimum wage by allowing
employers to pay a lower wage for four months _ two months more than
the Democrats have proposed and two months short of Bush's demand.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eastern Airlines, battling to get airborne again
despite an intractable strike and the shackles of bankruptcy court,
is facing a new and perhaps more insidious problem: allegations of
sloppy maintenance.
   The airline insists these charges are groundless concoctions of
embittered strikers, who have crippled Eastern for nearly four
months.
   But the Federal Aviation Administration is monitoring Eastern's
maintenance situation, an influential congresswoman has expressed
concern to the agency, and sources say a criminal inquiry into the
airline's maintenance record-keeping is underway.
   The sources, who spoke on condition they not be identified, said
the criminal investigation by the FBI and U.S. Attorney's office for
the Eastern district of New York focuses on possibly improper
practices and allegedly falsified records at Eastern's John F.
Kennedy International Airport maintenance facility.
   Early last month, Eastern surrendered its repair station
certificate at Kennedy after the FAA determined the carrier had
failed to properly record and inspect maintenance work.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Charles Gerber said he could neither
confirm nor deny a criminal investigation exists. FBI
representatives did not return calls seeking comment.
   But Ira J. Furman, an attorney and former deputy director of the
National Transportation Safety Board, said he represents a former
Eastern manager at Kennedy who has talked to the FAA, FBI and the
U.S. attorney's office about alleged violations that occurred at
least a year ago.
   Furman said his client has been granted immunity. That seems to
imply the possibility of criminal violations.
   The spotlight of publicity turned on safety could not come at a
worse time for Miami-based Eastern, battered by bad news for years.
The safety question is especially sensitive because it has arisen
periodically.
   Labor strife at Eastern a year before the strike prompted FAA
inspectors to examine its fleet plane-by-plane, though no
abnormalities were found. Special FAA reviews in 1987 resulted in an
$823,000 fine.
   That followed a $9.5 million penalty stemming from earlier
infractions and warnings from the FAA that Eastern's operating
certificate faced revocation if it didn't clean up what examiners
called a long list of deficiences.
   Eastern documents and memos obtained by The Associated Press
depict an airline in which maintenance crews feuded with
supervisors, disaffected mechanics quit and managers ignored pilot
protests of sloppy repairs.
   ``We need parts!,'' Eastern maintenance manager Charles R.
Seymour pleaded in one internal memo in March 1987 to Phil Bohan,
vice president of line maintenance. ``I can assure you that the lack
of parts is seriously affecting our performance and continuing to
erode our manpower.''
   Seymour, director of Eastern's maintenance base in Atlanta until
he quit early this year, also complained to superiors about an
``alarming exodus'' of maintenance staff and other problems in memos
from July 1986 to January 1989.
   In an April 1988 letter, Carlos Diaz, principal maintenance
inspector in the FAA's Miami office, told Edward Upton, Eastern's
vice president of maintenance and engineering, that an informal
inspection of a Miami repair station had revealed ``far-reaching
findings.''
   The deficiencies included failure to separate usable parts from
``condemned'' ones and failure to follow procedures for handling
parts outlined in Eastern's manual, Diaz told Upton.
   ``Management personnel are unfamiliar with repair station
operational procedures'' and ``general housekeeping policy (is) not
being adhered to by Eastern personnel,'' Diaz wrote.
   Rep. Cardiss Collins, D-Ill., chairwoman of the House
subcommittee on Government Activities and Transportation, has
expressed concern to acting FAA Administrator Robert E. Whittington
that shortages of staff and spare parts could be hampering Eastern's
ability to maintain its fleet.
   In a June 1 letter to Whittington, Collins said her
subcommittee's staff had reviewed internal company documents
indicating ``manpower and parts shortages continue to plague the
maintenance function of Eastern.''
   On May 12, the FAA completed a special investigation of
record-keeping at Eastern's maintenance posts in Miami and Atlanta,
to determine if violations of record-keeping rules such as those
found at Kennedy were widespread.
   The three airports are home to Eastern's principal maintenance
facilities. The final report hasn't been submitted to Whittington.
But Jack Barker, FAA spokesman in Atlanta, said the agency told
Eastern informally that the inspection had revealed no
irregularities.
   At the same time, the FAA is continuing a ``special
surveillance'' of Eastern's overall safety, which began when workers
struck the airline March 4, said FAA spokesman Fred Farrar in
Washington.
   Suspension of the Kennedy certificate was for actions that
predated the strike, which pushed Eastern into bankruptcy court.
   When a maintenance certificate is suspended, the airline cannot
work on planes at the facility. It must contract work to others or
ferry planes elsewhere until deficiencies at the facility are
corrected.
   Questions about Eastern's Kennedy operation and maintenance
practices in general are like open sores in the airline's struggle
to sidestep the strikers, hire replacements and woo a skeptical
public back to the ticket counter.
   Unionists accuse the company of ``pencil-whipping,'' a reference
to maintenance supervisors signing off on aircraft repairs that
weren't done.
   They also charge that management, frantically trying to cut costs
and honor flying schedules during the pre-strike months, bullied
mechanics and pilots who complained about serious maintenance
violations.
   ``It all has root in a corporate culture, a corporate attitude,''
Greg Petachenko, an Eastern pilot for 22 years, said in a telephone
interview. ``Their basic tool seems to have been fear and
intimidation ... There's enormous pressure to keep your mouth shut,
do what you're told.''
   Until recently, Eastern paid maintenance supervisors bonuses for
meeting deadlines. The company stresses, however, that supervisors
also received bonuses for meeting training requirements and repair
quality standards.
   For its part, Eastern charges some machinists hid or destroyed
maintenance records at Kennedy, then told the FAA that company
supervisors neglected to have necessary work performed.
   Company representatives discovered records hidden in file
cabinets and stuffed under sofa cushions in union areas at the
airport, said Eastern spokesman Robin Matell.
   ``We've never dispatched an unsafe plane; we have one of the best
safety records in the industry,'' Matell said. He called union
complaints ``a deliberate attempt to drive away our passengers and
weaken the company.''
   The safety questions haven't stopped Frank Lorenzo, chairman of
Eastern's parent Texas Air Corp., from proceeding with a plan to
rebuild Eastern into a smaller carrier and sell around $1.8 billion
of assets.
   The plan must be approved by federal bankruptcy court. But U.S.
Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland already has given Eastern
permission to sell its Northeast shuttle service to developer Donald
Trump for $365 million.
   At the same time, Eastern has been aggressively recruiting new
skilled mechanics to replace strikers. The move complements a more
highly-publicized drive to recruit new pilots.
   The airline recently ran help-wanted advertisements for qualified
mechanics in newspapers in New Orleans, Dallas, Atlanta, Denver,
Miami, Tampa, West Palm Beach and Pensacola. The ads offer
``exciting career opportunities'' and wages of $10 to $18 an hour.
   Before the strike, unionized mechanics at Eastern earned top
hourly pay of $18.83. That compares with $16 at sister Texas Air
carrier Continental, $18.78 at American, $20.05 at United and
Northwest, and $20.10 at Delta and USAir.
   ``We're certainly putting a lot of attention on recruiting
mechanics,'' Matell said.

   A wildcat strike that has idled
thousands of West Virginia coal miners spread in Virginia on
Wednesday as United Mine Workers members ignored a federal judge's
back-to-work orders, company officials said.
   State police reported minor violence at mines in Boone and
Raleigh counties but no arrests as roving bands of pickets continued
to shut down mines.
   About 650 Westmoreland Coal Co. employees at three mines in
western Virginia near the Kentucky line joined a walkout that began
Monday in southern West Virginia.
   It was the first major expansion of the miners' show of support
for 1,600 union members striking in West Virginia and Virginia
against The Pittston Coal Group.
   Westmoreland spokesman Steve Anderson said about 50 Virginia
miners at three small mines staged a walkout Tuesday but were back
to work Wednesday. The miners who went on strike Wednesday had been
at work a day earlier, he said.
   ``We're trying to determine what we can do and want to do and
what the issues are,'' Anderson said.
   He said the company filed complaints with the National Labor
Relations Board in Cincinnati and Winston-Salem, N.C., accusing the
union of committing an unfair labor practice.
   In West Virginia, more than a dozen mines whose operators had
obtained back-to-work orders from U.S. District Judge Dennis Knapp
were among those affected by walkouts.
   ``As of today, they have not gone back to work,'' said Noel
Jones, Island Creek Coal Co.'s director of administrative services.
He said 197 Island Creek employees were off the job in West Virginia.
   ``Everything's the same as it was yesterday,'' Consolidation Coal
Co. spokesman Paul Kvederis said. About 250 Consolidation workers at
the Rowland mine in Raleigh County have ignored a back-to-work order
Knapp issued Monday.
   Altogether, company officials Tuesday had estimated that 10,000
workers were absent.
   Knapp on Wednesday issued more back-to-work orders, applying to
Hobet Coal Co. in Boone County, Kanawha Mining Co. in Kanawha and
Fayette counties, Kelso Coal Co. in Boone County, and High Power
Energy's strip mine in Nicholas County.
   In Charleston-based UMW District 17, where the walkout began, 90
percent of Logan County's 400 mines were idled, state Energy
Department spokeswoman Twila Matheny said Wednesday. In District
17's Region 6, centered in Kanawha County, 35 of 42 mines were shut
down, she said.
   State police reported windows broken at a Westmoreland mine in
Boone County and at New Beckley Mining Co. in Raleigh County.
   ``Of course, there was some rock throwing. There also was some
indication there was some gunfire directed at the fans of the
mine,'' said state police Capt. A.E. Baumgardner. ``They dispersed
after they were asked to unhood.''
   Some striking workers said they will remain off the job until
three union officials are released from the Roanoke, Va., jail,
where they are being held for violating a judge's order limiting
picket-line activity at Pittston mines.
   Union officials did not return phone calls Tuesday or Wednesday,
but they have said they did not authorize the walkouts, which
violate a no-strike clause in the union's 1988 national contract
with the Bituminous Coal Operators Association.
   Pittston, the nation's largest coal exporter, negotiated
independently with the union, and talks broke down over work rules
the company says it needs to compete with foreign suppliers.

   West Point-Pepperell will put plants in
Alabama, Georgia and Texas on seven-day work weeks in an expansion
that is expected to create 330 new jobs.
   The textile company also plans to buy $40 million in new
equipment for its bed products group, Pepperell's parent company,
Chicago-based Farley Inc., announced Wednesday.
   The schedule and equipment moves are to ``meet the growing demand
for quality bed sheeting,'' Farley said.
   The seven-day operations are planned for Pepperell plants in
LaGrange, Ga., Huguley, Ala., and New Braunfels, Texas. The new
schedules, already in effect at some other Pepperell facilities,
will begin in September at the Iselin Mill in New Braunfels and in
July 1990 at the Dunson Mill in LaGrange and the Lanier Mill in
Huguley.
   The new equipment will be installed by July 1990 at the Dunson
and Lanier mills as well as at plants in Lanett and Opelika, Ala.,
the company said.

<HEAD>Court Approves Sale of 15 Eastern Planes to Leasing Company</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal bankruptcy judge on Wednesday approved
strikebound Eastern Airlines' agreement to sell 15 aircraft for
$277.5 million to UAS-Invest Inc. as part of Eastern's downsizing
plan.
   The sale approved by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland
consists of three Boeing 757s, 10 Boeing 727-200s, two Airbus A300s
and six spare engines. UAS-Invest is an affiliate of United Aviation
Services, an aircraft leasing company.
   Eastern sought bankruptcy protection from creditors on March 9,
five days after pilots and flight attendants joined striking ground
workers represented by the Machinists union in a walkout that
virtually grounded the Miami-based airline.
   The jet sale is part of the plan announced in late April by Frank
Lorenzo, chairman of Eastern parent Texas Air Corp., to rebuild
Eastern as a smaller carrier and sell about $1.8 billion of its
assets separately.
   The bankruptcy court recently gave Lorenzo permission to sell
Eastern's profitable Northeast shuttle service to developer Donald
Trump for $365 million, and has approved other sales of aircraft.
   The sale to UAS-Invest leaves Eastern with 213 planes, compared
with its pre-strike fleet of about 255. Lorenzo's downsizing plan
calls for 157 aircraft.
   The pilots union expressed disappointment with Lifland's decision
and called the downsizing plan ``a controlled liquidation''.
   ``The sale of approximately 6 percent of Eastern's remaining
fleet is not consistent with the concerns of the employees,
Eastern's customers, and other parties who want a full restoration
of Eastern operations,'' the union said in a statement.
   Lifland recently directed Eastern to start negotiations with its
creditors on a reorganization plan for the airline. Eastern is
drafting such a proposal, which would be centered on its downsizing
plan and also would address payment of creditors and treatment of
shareholders.
   A buyout plan for Eastern proposed by the unions and Chicago
commodities trader Joseph Ritchie remains under discussion, but
Lifland said the first priority should be talks on the
reorganization scheme.
   The Ritchie plan includes a $100 million equity investment and
$210 million in union wage concessions.

   Weirton Steel Corp., one of the nation's
largest employee-owned companies, went public Wednesday by offering
4 million shares of its common stock for trading on the New York
Stock Exchange.
   The first offering of Weirton Steel stock opened at $14.50 a
share. It closed at $15.12{ in consolidated trading.
   Proceeds from Weirton Steel's stock offering will be used to help
fund a $650 million modernization project.
   Weirton Steel, with about 8,000 employees, produces and sells
flat-rolled and coated carbon steel. In 1988, it reported net income
of $150 million on sales of $1.4 billion, and it shipped about 2.7
million tons of steel.
   Employees had approved a plan in March that reduces their
profit-sharing by up to 50 percent of the company's after-tax income
to allow the public stock sale. The plan guarantees employee control
of the company.
   The shares offered Wednesday were sold by the trustee of the
company's 1984 Employee Stock Ownership Plan. Lazard Freres &amp; Co.,
Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. Inc. and Prudential-Bache Capital Funding are
acting as co-managers of the offering.

<TEXT>
   Nelson Bunker Hunt and William Herbert Hunt,
onetime billionaires, would retain millions of dollars of assets
under liquidation plans they filed Wednesday in federal bankruptcy
court.
   The brothers filed for Chapter 11 protection from their creditors
last year after a Peruvian mining company won a $196 million
judgment against them for their attempt to corner the silver market
in 1979 and 1980.
   The Internal Revenue Service also has multimillion-dollar claims
against the brothers, saying Bunker and his wife, Caroline, owe the
government $600 million while Herbert and his wife, Nancy, owe $300
million.
   Bunker and Caroline Hunt have said they have assets worth about
$240 million to cover debts of more than $1.2 billion; Herbert and
Nancy value their assets at $40 million and debts of $887 million.
   Also Wednesday, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Harold Abramson granted the
brothers' request that 601 silver claims, representing $87.7
million, be dismissed from the bankruptcy proceedings.
   The decision leaves almost 600 claims amounting to about $360
million stemming from the brothers' silver speculation. Included in
that is a reduced $134.6 million judgment in favor of Minepaco S.A.
of Peru.
   In lengthy disclosure statements filed Wednesday with the U.S.
Bankruptcy Court in Dallas, the brothers detail their holdings,
ranging from Bunker Hunt's $10 silver Churchill Commemorative Coin
to Herbert Hunt's oil and gas holdings worth $8.3 million.
   A hearing is scheduled before Abramson on Thursday to discuss the
disclosure statements and the Hunts' proposed reorganization plans.
   Earlier plans, which contained many of the same features but was
less detailed, were vigorously fought by creditors at an April
hearing.
   The holdings detailed in the new plans include Bunker Hunt's
collection of 8,000 Islamic and 2,712 Roman and Greek coins, valued
at $19 million, and Herbert Hunt's $3.5 million collection of
ancient bronze statues and artifacts currently on display at a Fort
Worth museum.
   While the separate liquidation plans filed by the brothers differ
in detail, they both suggest creating a liquidation trust that would
sell their holdings over a six-year period to pay down their debts.
   In both plans, the IRS would get the lion's share of the proceeds.
   However, Herbert Hunt proposes to keep 10 percent of the
liquidation value of his estate, or $7.65 million.
   Bunker Hunt seeks to withhold from the liquidating trust his
Dallas house and furnishings, plus interests in currently
non-producing oil and gas leases, interest in an estate created by
his father, flamboyant oilman H.L. Hunt, and 75 percent of the
proceeds from the sale of his coins and antiquities over $21 million.
   In addition to retaining those, Bunker Hunt's plan would pay him
$7.5 million from the first $150 million of the proceeds from the
liquidation trust and a third of the proceeds over $150 million.

<HEAD>Marvin Davis Extends Tender Offer For Northwest's Parent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oil billionaire Marvin Davis on Wednesday
extended his $2.7 billion tender offer for all outstanding shares of
NWA Inc., the parent of Northwest Airlines.
   The $90-a-share offer had been scheduled to expire at 6 p.m. EDT
Wednesday, but was extended until 6 p.m. Tuesday, June 20, a
spokesman for Davis said. The offer could be further extended, the
spokesman said.
   However, despite the extention, the offer remains on hold pending
the resolution of a competitive bidding process NWA's board of
directors has launched for the airline.
   Davis has been bidding for the nation's fourth-largest airline
since March 28, when he made his $2.7 billion offer directly to the
company's directors.
   He launched the tender offer when the board rejected him. He
later agreed to put the offer on hold in order to participate in the
bidding process, which has included other suitors.
   NWA said the first round of bidding did not yield an adequate
offer. Suitors have until Friday to enhance their offers, which will
be reviewed by a committee of the board of directors.
   Northwest stock has been trading in a range near $109 a share.
   Suitors known to have met the first deadline include Davis; Pan
Am Corp.; an investment group led by Los Angeles-based Alfred
Checchi; Forstmann Little &amp; Co. of New York; MEI Diversified Inc. of
Minneapolis, owned by banker Carl Pohlad; and the International
Association of Machinists, representing 20,000 employees at
Northwest.
   Pan Am is the only suitor to announce publicly that it will
submit a revised bid.

<HEAD>Dollar Sharply Higher, Stocks Plunge</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar was sharply higher against the yen at
late morning Thursday, resulting in a plunge in share prices on the
Tokyo Stock Exchange, dealers said.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, a 189.44-point gainer the
previous day, lost 51.53 points, or 0.15 percent, closing the
morning session at 33,351.53.
   The dollar at late morning was changing hands at 150.35 yen after
opening at 150.30 yen, up 2.25 yen from Wednesday's 148.05-yen
close. The currency moved in the range of 150.30 to 150.65 yen.
   Mitsuhiko Kinugasa, a trader with Daiwa Bank in Tokyo, said the
dollar's surge came ``earlier than the market had expected.''
   He said investors are aggressive in their dollar-buying,
anticipating the release of U.S. trade figures for April by the U.S.
Commerce Deparment, scheduled for later Thursday in Washington.
   Market players predict the U.S. trade deficit will shrink from
its $8.9 billion level in March.
   The Bank of Japan conducted dollar-selling intervention
intermittenly, amounting to $500 million, the Japan Broadcasting
Corporation (NHK) reported. The central bank makes no official
comments on its monetary activities.
   ``No matter how often the Japanese side says the dollar should
stay lower, it has small influence because the United States, the
owner of the currency, doesn't make any moves,'' the Daiwa trader
said. ``Japanese market players have taken this as an indication
that the United States is allowing the dollar's surge for the
moment.''
   Because the United States has failed to reduce its trade deficit
by keeping the dollar lower, the country might be shifting its
policy to using other remedies such as the ``Super 301'' provision
of the U.S. Trade Act, Kinugasa said.
   ``The market sentiment for bullish dollar continues, and
investors are likely to keep buying the currency until they start
selling for profit taking, around the 152-153 yen level,'' he added.
   On the stock exchange, dealers said the dollar's surge against
the yen largely discouraged Japanese participants, especially
institutional investors.
   ``The current stock market has been so much affected by
fluctuations in the foreign exchange,'' said Kazuhiro Nomura, a
dealer with New Japan Securities Co.
   ``There was no buying incentive in today's trading, except for
high-tech issues that are strong when the yen's weak,'' Nomura added.
