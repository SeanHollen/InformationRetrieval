   As pro-democracy demonstrations rocked China,
three U.S. warships arrived Friday in Shanghai for only the second
U.S. Navy port call since the communist government was founded in
1949.
   The goodwill visit came one day after Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev visited Shanghai.
   The warships originally were scheduled to arrive Thursday but
were delayed for one day. Although no official explanation was
given for the delay, the Soviets apparently saw the coincidence of
the port call with Gorbachev's visit as a diplomatic affront.
   The three U.S. vessels sailed up the Huangpu River, common
waters for foreign warships at the turn of the century when foreign
powers dominated Shanghai with gunboat diplomacy. Decorative flags
dotted the masts and sailors lined the rails for a look at China's
largest city.
   More than 200,000 students and workers marched and rallied
through the city of 12 million Friday for the second straight day
in support of larger, related protests in Beijing. About 100,000
were gathered a short distance down the Huangpu River from where
the American vessels docked.
   Barry Matney, a press officer for the Seventh Fleet, said the
command and control ship USS Blueridge, the cruiser USS Sterett and
the guided missile frigate USS Rodney M. Davis will be in Shanghai
until Monday.
   He said the 2,500 naval personnel aboard the ships had been
advised to avoid the demonstrations but were to be granted liberty
to visit the city as scheduled. He said they were to be in uniform
when touring the city.
   He said not many people watched the arrival because most people
were more interested in the demonstrations.
   The first U.S. Navy port call to communist China was in November
1986, when three warships visited the Yellow Sea port of Qingdao.
Last month a Chinese Navy training vessel visited Honolulu in
communist China's first port call in the United States.

   American television coverage of events in
Beijing was disrupted Friday night when Chinese authorities
``pulled the plug'' on live transmissions from Tiananmen Square.
   ``Goodbye from Beijing,'' CNN anchorman Bernard Shaw said as
Cable News Network signed off its broadcasts from the Chinese
capital. It was shortly after 11 a.m. Saturday in Beijing, or 10
p.m. Friday EDT.
   CBS also had its transmissions cut off from the square. NBC was
cut off by virtue of its sharing satellite transmission equipment
with CNN; and ABC said the government had shut down all satellite
feeds from China.
   Later reports via telephone by CNN Anchor Bernard Shaw said
Chinese officials had issued a news blackout that prohibited crews
from videotaping any events in the country related to the
continuing student protests.
   Beijing Mayor Chen Xitong said foreign reporters were forbidden
to ``incite or instigate Chinese to to march'' and could not
conduct interviews or make tapes or videos on the streets or at
government offices, schools, factories and mines.
   ``Any violators will be stopped according to the law,'' the
order said.
   CNN spokesman Steve Haworth said in a telephone interview that
the network was continuing to cover the story of students resuming
a week-old hunger strike in Tiananmen Square in Beijing by live
telephone interviews.
   ``We don't know yet what this order means,'' he said. ``Our
crews cannot move around or even shoot tape, but it's too early to
tell what the impact is.''
   Shaw and Haworth said the crews have not been ordered out of the
country.
   Haworth said that the journalists have 30-day visas and that
crews arrived May 12-14 so ``they're there for a while.''
   Earlier, in a live transmission from the Great Wall Sheraton
Hotel in Beijing, CNN showed a government official writing the
official order _ on a note pad provided by CNN editors _ to shut
down the broadcasts.
   The order came about an hour after martial law was declared in
parts of Beijing, including Tiananmen Square, where hundreds of
thousands of Chinese have been demonstrating for political reforms.
   CNN requested the order in writing because it had legal
agreements with the Chinese government to broadcast from Beijing,
editors said in the live transmission.
   The government official said the agreement had been designed for
coverage of the visit to China of Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev, which ended Friday.
   CBS News broke into the network's season finale broadcast of
``Dallas'' to show anchorman Dan Rather at the network's control
center in Beijing's Hotel Shangri-La as Chinese officials ordered
the network to end its broadcasts.
   Rather reported that Chinese officials ``pulled the plug'' on
live transmissions from Tiananmen Square just after several
helicopters flew over the square. Tape showed Rather preparing to
broadcast from the square, then a screen full of interference.
   He said that when he returned to the control center he was met
by representatives of the government television system saying
they'd been told by the Foreign Ministry to end CBS's broadcasts.
   The written order to CNN said it must shut down the moveable
earth station transmitting its signal to a satellite. Transmission
ceased about four minutes later, after network executives in CNN's
Atlanta headquarters told the staff to obey the letter.
   ``In my 20 years of news reporting I've never seen anything like
this,'' Shaw said before signing off.
   Donna Dees, a spokeswoman for CBS News, said representatives of
the government-run television company were preparing an official
order, similar to CNN's, to put the network off the air.
   After being cut off from Tiananmen Square, CBS was able to
continue with reports from its headquarters at a nearby hotel, but
even that appeared threatened by the impending order, she said.
   ABC had ordered two feeds from China on Friday night using
Chinese television equipment, said spokesman Scott Richardson, but
were apparently caught by the official blackout.
   Bill Baxter, manager of the network desk for NBC News, said the
network shared a satellite with CNN and was unable to get a signal
out of China. He said efforts to book other satellite time were
also stymied by the official blackout.
   Efforts by the Chinese to end live transmissions began at about
8 p.m. EDT, Haworth said. CNN's live China coverage went briefly
off the air at 9:21 p.m. EDT but resumed live coverage several
minutes later.
   Officials then issued a statement that ``we would be live until
they physically unplugged us or issued a written declaration of why
we were to leave, which they did shortly thereafter,'' according to
Haworth.
   Haworth said the shutdown apparently was not due to any specific
coverage by CNN but because the Chinese are ``anxious about
resolving problems in Tiananmen but not on live television.''

   Against a backdrop of political turmoil,
Iran's leaders are grappling with the thorny question of who will
rule the Islamic republic after Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
   The signs are that, because no one has the aging revolutionary
patriarch's charisma or religious authority, no one man will take
his place and that Iran will be led by a council of three to five
members.
   The leadership question was thrown open in April after Khomeini
forced his designated heir, Ayatollah Hussein Ali Montazeri, to
resign following his criticism of Iranian policies.
   Parliament Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani, who is the front-runner
in presidential elections later this year, is likely to be a
candidate for the collective leadership, which would embrace Iran's
various factions.
   Other possible candidates include Ayatollah Ali Meshkini,
radical chairman of the 83-member Assembly of Experts; Ayatollah
Ahmad Jannati, a leading member of the 13-man Council of Guardians;
Chief Justice Ayatollah Musavi Ardebili, a centrist, and Khomeini's
son, Ahmad, who is showing increasing signs of political ambitions
after years in his father's shadow.
   Khomeini, 88 and ailing, has named a 20-man committee of Iran's
leading political, clerical and legal figures to settle the
leadership question and to draft amendments to the December, 1979,
revolutionary constitution, a move that could have far-reaching
political consequences.
   He said the constitution contained ``imperfections and flaws.''
He did not specify them but warned that ``any delay'' in the
amendments ``will result in plagues and bitter consequences for the
country and the revolution.''
   The committee is expected to present its recommendations in
advance of the presidential elections to be held between July 22
and Aug. 22 before incumbent Ali Khamenei's second four-year term
runs out in September. He cannot run for a third term.
   The result of that poll will affect the future course of
Khomeini's decade-old Islamic revolution and the power of the
country's theocracy, which radicals fear is in danger from the
liberalization sought by more moderate leaders.
   This has fueled a radical resurgence in the wake of the Aug. 20
cease-fire in the war with Iraq that has triggered purges of
so-called ``liberals'' and the executions of hundreds of political
dissidents.
   The current swing toward the anti-Western radicals dates from
Feb. 14, when Khomeini issued his death sentence on the British
author Salman Rushdie on grounds that he blasphemed Islam in his
novel, ``The Satanic Verses.''
   But Khomeini in the past has thrown his weight behind one
faction or another every few months in a delicate balancing act
that prevents any group from becoming too powerful.
   Some analysts suspect Khomeini may already be swinging back
toward Rafsanjani's so-called pragmatists.
   One of the constitutional committee's tasks is to decide whether
to scrap or downgrade the post of prime minister and broaden the
executive powers of the presidency.
   Rafsanjani, the only declared candidate for the presidential
election so far, is supported by the hard-pressed middle class, the
powerful ``bazaaris,'' or merchant community, and some of the
conservative religious establishment.
   The populist speaker polled 1.3 million votes in last year's
parliamentary elections, the highest single tally in the ballot.
   Another possible entry in the presidential race is
Prosecutor-General Musavi Khoeiniha, a middle-ranking cleric who
led the militants who stormed the U.S. Embassy in Tehran in
November, 1979.
   The incumbent Khamenei, who backs Rafsanjani, noted that the
leaders who drew up the constitution after Shah Mohammad Reza
Pahlavi was ousted sought to ensure that ``power would be dispersed
and not concentrated, in view of their bitter experience of the
concentration of power under the former regime.''
   The radicals oppose centralizing power. But Ayatollah Abolqassem
Khazari, an influential figure, noted recently: ``Some powers
should be concentrated. ... If the legislative branch is vigilant
... there can be no move toward a dictatorship.''
   The radical revival torpedoed Rafsanjani's efforts to build
bridges with the West to end Iran's isolation and left him
politically exposed.
   But the speaker, who has survived earlier reverses, has in
recent weeks publicly taken a much more radical position,
protecting his flanks from hardline rivals led by Interior Minister
Ali Akbar Mohtashemi.
   How long he will identify with the radicals is open to question.
He has changed positions many times, trimming his sails to the
prevailing political winds until he is able to reassert himself.

   The young doctor moved through rows of
casualties from the artillery battle between Christians and
Moslems. ``I'm so worn out I sometimes lock myself in my room and
cry, just cry,'' he said.
   His name is Pierre, he is 26 and he asked that his surname not
be used because he is a Christian working at the American
University Hospital in Moslem west Beirut.
   It was before the cease-fire negotiated by the Arab League on
May 11 had brought a halt to the artillery war. Shells and rockets
were exploding. Ambulances raced up to the hospital's tree-shaded
entrance.
   ``We go through this almost every day,'' Pierre said. He and the
other interns rushed to aid victims who were carried into the
emergency ward on blood-stained stretchers, many screaming in pain
or terror.
   Within minutes, the long corridors were filled with dead, dying
and the wounded. Doctors and nurses shouted for plasma and bandages.
   ``We try to hold up in front of the patients, but inside we're
really sick and tired of all this,'' Pierre said.
   By the end of his tour, 20 of the new arrivals had been
pronounced dead and 36 had undergone emergency surgery. Eighteen
had wounds light enough to be treated and released.
   Sirens wailed in the distance and Pierre winced, hiw eyes red
from lack of sleep. ``Let's hope it's not more casualties,'' he
said. ``We've had enough.''
   More than 350 people have been killed and nearly 1,400 wounded
in the often indiscriminate artillery and rocket barrages that
began March 8. Most of the casualties have been civilians.
   The hospital compound has been hit many times, once by a 155mm
shell that penetrated the fourth floor but did not explode. Seven
of Beirut's 24 hospitals have been damaged.
   Dr. Najat Daou, who treats wounded children, told of a
13-year-old who staggered into the emergency ward holding her
7-year-old brother under her right arm and said: ``Don't worry
about me. Just please save my brother. He's the only one left.''
   Her left hand was broken when a shell hit their home. It killed
her father, mother and four sisters. She carried her brother more
than a mile to the hospital, but he was dead.

<HEAD>Study: When It Comes To The Pentagon, Most Districts Give More Than
They Get</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pentagon costs most congressional
districts more in taxes than they get back through military
spending but the situation likely will change in the 1990s because
of changing budget priorities, says an economist who studies the
effects of federal spending.
   ``These numbers should look quite different five or six years
from now,'' James R. Anderson said Thursday in releasing a study
that showed 321 of the 435 congressional districts lost money on
the deal.
   ``The patterns are fairly stable over a long period of time, but
I think we are going to see some very significant changes as we go
into the '90's, in part because of base closings but also in part
as we level off and perhaps significantly reduce the military
budget,'' said Anderson, a professor of economics at Michigan State
Uniersity.
   Anderson, a senior fellow of Employment Research Associates of
Lansing, Mich., an independent, non-profit economic consulting firm
that conducted the study, said the findings run counter to
arguments often heard on Capitol Hill.
   ``For years, members of Congress would say that even if they
wanted to, they couldn't vote against military spending because it
meant money coming into their districts,'' Anderson said. ``But we
found that the Pentagon budget isn't a boon to most congressional
districts, it's a drain.''
   The study was based on fiscal year 1987, during which U.S.
military outlays came to $282 billion. An additional $7.1 billion
was spent on military categories of foreign aid.
   For the study, that $289.1 billion was apportioned among the
states and then divided among congressional districts by a formula
designed to take into account income levels as well as population.
   The North Central region of the country was the biggest loser,
with 97 of its 113 districts in the net loss category. In the
Northeast, there were 80 net loss districts and 15 gainers. The
South had 99 net loss districts and 43 that gained. The West was
the closest with 45 districts losing and 40 districts, heavily
concentrated in Southern California, gaining.
   The district with the biggest net gain from military spending,
more than $3 billion, was the 10th District of Virginia, home of
the Pentagon. The biggest net loss, $1.2 billion, was in the 7th
District of Texas, in Houston.
   Anderson said he included prime contracts, military salaries and
wages and retirement pay but not veterans' payments in calculating
defense expenditures and in his formula estimated that about 40
percent of federal taxes go for federal expenditures. He said this
is higher than some other estimates, which run between 26 and 28
percent, because he did not include trust funds dedicated to a
specific project in his total.
   The study said 104 districts registered a net loss of $500
million or more.
   Of these, 19 districts were in New York, 13 in Illinois, 11 in
Texas, eight each in Ohio and Michigan, seven each in Florida and
New Jersey, five in California, four in Pennsylvania, three each in
Missouri, North Carolina and Wisconsin, two in Massachusetts and
one each in Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Indiana, Kansas,
Minnesota, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Oregon, Tennessee and Virginia.
   States registering an overall net gain were Alabama, $6.2
million; Alaska, $310.1 million; Arizona, $1 billion; California,
$2 billion; Colorado, $737.4 million; Connecticut, $115.5 million;
Georgia, $299 million; Hawaii, $1.3 billion; Maine $71.9 million.
   Also, Maryland, $973.9 million; Massachusetts, $1.16 billion;
Mississippi, $552.9 million; Missouri, $2 billion; New Mexico,
$1.47 billion; South Carolina, $1 billion; Utah, $664.3 million;
Virginia, $9.4 billion; and Washington $1 billion.
   The most dramatic change was in Texas, which went from a net
gain in a previous study in 1981 to a loss of $5.26 billion.
   Other losing states were Arkansas, $612.8 million; Delaware,
$459.9 million; Florida, $3 billion; Idaho, $220.7 million;
Illinois, $11.62 billion; Indiana, $2.82 billion; Iowa, $2.19
billion; Kansas, $671.2 million; Kentucky, $1.25 billion;
Louisiana, $1.57 billion; Michigan, $8.33 billion; Minnesota, $2.26
billion.
   Also, Montana, $502.7 million; Nebraska, $942.1 million; Nevada,
$97.9 million; New Hampshire, $395.4 million; New Jersey, $7.57
billion; New York, $13.6 billion; North Carolina, $1.9 billion.
   Also, North Dakota, $237.9 million; Ohio, $5.75 billion;
Oklahoma, $1.18 billion; Oregon, $2.18 billion; Pennsylvania, $7.64
billion; Rhode Island, $346.6 million.
   Also, South Dakota, $357.2 million; Tennessee, $2.2 billion;

   The Toxic Avenger cavorts on the beach,
while in a theater nearby critics weigh the latest entry in the
International Film Festival.
   It is part of the incongruous reality that is Cannes, where
movies like ``Video Demons Do PsychoTown'' or ``The Toxic Avenger:
Part II'' are promoted alongside those competing for the coveted
Golden Palm award.
   The world's most prestigious showplace for film also is the
industry's biggest marketplace, and movies in the official
selection may die an artsy death while those shown in backstreet
theaters go on to blockbuster success.
   ``It's the first encounter of the first degree. The life and
death of a motion picture is decided here,'' said Menahem Golan, a
leading independent Hollywood producer-director in town for the
42nd annual festival.
   Thousands of producers, film makers and distributers from around
the world set up shop for two weeks each year in Cannes. They hawk
their wares in the basement of the Palais des Festivals, in hotel
suites or, for those able to pay for an aloof but powerful
presence, on yachts anchored in the Mediterranean.
   Giant movie banners are strung across the white facade of the
swank Carlton Hotel, which reigns over the Croisette, the
waterfront boulevard. Inside, the lobby is overrun with stands and
the upstairs suites are transformed into office space.
   Having a suite at the Carlton for doing business ``is like
having box seats to a Mets game,'' said Rob Aft, acting
international sales director for Troma, Inc., a small New
York-based company that is becoming a major force in the
exploitation film genre.
   ``We are never going to have an official selection at the
Palais,'' he said. ``But we're known here.''
   Troma is the creator of the Toxic Avenger, a former 98-pound
nerd named Melvin from Tromaville, N.J., who was transformed by
chemical waste into a deformed and hulking hero.
   In the first five days of the 13-day festival, Troma, which
buys, sells and distributes movies, did about $500,000 in business.
Troma President Lloyd Kaufman said he expected to close about $2
million in deals by the festival's end May 23.
   ``Cannes is known for being a fairly conservative, artistic
festival,'' said Aft. ``All the better for Troma,'' he added.
``They make films. We make movies.''
   Golan said that in less than a week, he closed more than $20
million in deals _ pre-sales on 20-film packages to countries like
Spain, Australia, Greece, Belgium, the Netherlands, Portugal and
Peru. He inaugurated his company, 21st Century, with the first
announced deal in the marketplace, worth ``multimillions.''
   The market first sprang up around the festival 29 years ago, and
organizers say it has grown into the world's largest. There are no
official figures on transactions.
   Film critic Roger Ebert says in his book about Cannes, ``Two
Weeks in the Midday Sun,'' that he once came across a man who sold
movies by the pound.
   Golan, whose brassy style _ rainbow suspenders over a T-shirt _
shines like the glitz of Cannes, cannot go unnoticed here.
   He mounted the festival's most aggressive publicity blitz, with
fliers strewn along the Croisette, dozens of daily full-page ads in
the various festival trade journals and a large office on the
ground floor of the Carlton.
   Golan co-founded Cannon Films with his cousin, Yorum Globus, and
produced an eclectic combination of high profile movies and schlock.
   Now, he talks up 21st Century products like ``Phantom of the
Opera'' and ``Mack the Knife,'' an adaptation of the musical ``The
Threepenny Opera.''
   Golan vows he he is ``getting out'' of exploitation movies,
saying, ``I want to associate myself with what is considered the
better product.''
   But 21st Century's repertoire includes ``Caged Fury'' and
``Deceit,'' the latter billed as a sci-fi space comedy about a
nuclear-armed alien sex fiend looking for earthly love.

<HEAD>Lawmakers Propose U.S.-Soviet Talks To End Plutonium Production</HEAD>

   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy is leading a
congressional drive to push the Bush administration into
negotiations with the Soviet Union on a mutual halt to production
of plutonium, a key ingredient in all nuclear weapons.
   Kennedy, D-Mass., on Thursday unveiled a legislative proposal,
introduced in both the House and Senate, that would shut down parts
of the U.S. nuclear weapons complex unless President Bush pursued
such negotiations within six months.
   More than 90 congressmen cosponsored the House bill, and the
Senate version had seven sponsors. More than 20 environmental, arms
control and religious organizations announced their support for the
measure.
   The United States currently is unable to produce any plutonium
because of breakdowns in its weapons production complex, but Bush
has proposed spending several billion dollars to modernize and
expand plutonium production in the 1990s.
   The size of the U.S. plutonium stockpile is classified, but
private experts say there is enough to last for hundreds of years
without further production.
   Kennedy said the unplanned suspension of U.S. plutonium
production gives the administration an opening to counter Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's recent flurry of arms control
initiatives.
   ``We can't let him trot around the globe making it look like
he's the only one interested in arms control,'' said Rep. Ron
Wyden, D-Ore., a cosponsor of the House bill.
   The White House said no one was available to comment on the
legislation.
   The bills say that six months after enactment, Bush would be
prohibited from operating any of the facilities dedicated to
production of plutonium for military purposes unless he certified
one of the following conditions:
   _The Soviets refuse to negotiate a ban on plutonium and highly
enriched uranium.
   _The United States is unable to determine whether the Soviets
have halted production, or
   _The Soviets continue to get plutonium by operating civilian
plants.
   Gorbachev announced in London last month that he would shut down
by the end of the year three reactors that are producing enriched
uranium and plutonium for the Soviet nuclear arsenal. He called the
move a ``major step toward the complete cessation of production of
fissionable materials for use in weapons.''
   The Soviets will still have 11 reactors producing nuclear
weapons materials, according to congressional testimony Wednesday
by Energy Secretary James D. Watkins.

<HEAD>San Francisco Judge Candidate Still in the Running Despite Cranston</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sharp criticism from Sen. Alan Cranston will
not block action on the nomination of San Francisco attorney Vaughn
Walker for a federal judgeship, the chairman of the Senate
Judiciary Committee says.
   ``I have no desire to hold up Walker,'' Judiciary Chairman
Joseph Biden, D-Del., told reporters Thursday following a committee
meeting.
   Cranston has opposed Walker's nomination to the U.S. District
Court in San Francisco, citing the attorney's vigorous defense at a
1988 hearing of a private club that allegedly discriminates against
women. He also says Walker waited too long before he resigned from
the club.
   Biden said Cranston's opposition ``will affect Walker
negatively'' but will not kill the nomination outright as would
have been the case under customs that once prevailed in the Senate.
   Under the Senate's old traditions, a judicial candidate's
home-state senator could torpedo the nomination outright merely by
sending the committee what lawmakers call a ``blue slip'' with a
negative recommendation.
   In that case, all work on the nomination would stop immediately
and the candidate's hopes for becoming a judge would be effectively
dead.
   Biden said the tradition changed in 1978, when Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy, D-Mass., became chairman of the committee. He said Kennedy
believed that no individual senator should have the power to veto a
nominee.
   Biden said he would modify that formula. He said a home-state
senator now can veto a judicial candidate with a blue slip but only
if the administration neglects to consult with lawmakers before
making the nomination. Still, he said other senators should give
due weight to a negative recommendation from a home-state senator.
   He said he has discussed the need for consultations with the
administration officials and received assurances that they will
take place.
   Cranston has submitted a negative blue slip in Walker's case,
citing his defense of San Francisco's Olympic Club and criticizing
Walker for waiting until February to resign. The club does not
allow women to become full-fledged members. It attracted attention
previously when Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy resigned from
it a month before his confirmation hearings.
   Walker's confirmation is being urged by Sen. Pete Wilson,
R-Calif.
   Walker resigned from the Olympic Club in February saying he
enjoyed being a member but that ``unfortunately the club's present
membership practices are wrongly based on a policy of exclusion.''
   He said the club ``has certainly recently demonstrated that
race, ethnicity, religion and other arbitrary factors do not play
as role in club membership.
   ``Nonetheless,'' Walker added, ``I, as a member of the club,
have been disappointed that the club has not taken longer strides
toward making full membership status available to women.''
   Biden said he has not set a hearing date for Walker.
   Meanwhile, the Judiciary Committee sent to the full Senate with
favorable recommendations the four other judicial candidates whose
names currently are on Capitol Hill.
   They are Pamela Ann Rhymer of Los Angeles and Ferdinand F.
Fernandez as judges of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals;
Robert C. Bonner of Pasadena, Calif., as judge of the U.S. District
Court for the Central District of California; and Melinda F. Harmon
of Houston as District Court judge for the Southern District of
Texas.

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, who has
been out of public view since the May 7 elections and resulting
violence led to international calls for his ouster, appeared before
about 1,000 chanting supporters Thursday.
   But the beaming Defense Forces chief, wearing a white
``guayabera'' tropical shirt and gray pants, did not respond to
calls by the United States and the Organization of American States
for him to give up his control of Panama's government.
   He did not address the gathering. When reporters asked how many
years he could continue in power, he laughed and said, ``That's a
good question.''
   Noriega appeared at a rally called ``In support of the National
Liberation Project'' at the government's Atlapa Convention center.
   ``The people united shall never be defeated!'' and ``Noriega,
for sure, hit the Yankees hard!'' chanted the general's admirers as
he waved.
   The government nullified the presidential elections, which the
opposition and government candidates both claimed to have won,
after Noriega supporters beat up the opposition candidates.
   Official media said Thursday the Organization of American States
has neither the right nor authority to negotiate a change in
Panama's government or Noriega's departure.
   U.S. officials in Washington said the Bush administration is
prepared to urge stepped-up pressure on Noriega if he ignores an
OAS call to give up power.
   The Catholic Church in Panama applauded the OAS call.
   ``This is a great step forward,'' said Panamanian Archbishop
Marcos McGrath. ``I'm gratified that the organization has taken
this seriously and that it is bringing to bear its influence,
counsel, exhortations and, to a certain extent, threats.''
   Also Thursday, Luis Anderson, a member of the nine-member
directorate of the Panama Canal Commission since 1983, resigned to
protest what he said was government brutality and violations of
civil rights.
   In his resignation letter to acting President Manuel Solis
Palma, he condemned ``the actions of your government against
civilians and opposition leaders, whose peaceful protests were met
with savage and bestial use of force.''
   Anderson was the second Panamanian member to resign this year.
The directorate comprises five U.S. citizens and four Panamanians.
   At a special meeting Wednesday night in Washington, the OAS
foreign ministers said power should be transferred through
democratic means in Panama. They left the details to a mediation
team consisting of the foriegn ministers of Guatemala, Ecuador and
Trinidad and Tobago.
   Senior U.S. officials met with Latin American diplomats Thursday
to discuss strategy for dealing with Noriega if he refuses to
cooperate with OAS mediators.
   Panamanian Foreign Minister Jorge Ritter promised on Wednesday
that his government will cooperate fully with the mediators, but
there was little expectation in Washington that negotiations will
go smoothly.
   Opposition leaders interpreted the OAS resolution as a demand
for the departure of Noriega, who has commanded the 15,000-member
Defense Forces since 1983 and is de facto ruler of Panama.
   ``It is important to note that the resolution speaks of a
transfer of power and that it insists that Noriega must retire,''
said Ricardo Arias Calderon, opposition candidate for first vice
president in the May 7 election, which the government annulled.
   On the government's Radio Nacional, commentator Rigoberto
Paredes countered that the ministers ``must not come with the
proposal that Noriega leave, because that is an internal Panamanian
affair.''
   He rejected installation of ``a puppet government of the United
States,'' a reference to the opposition coalition, which claims its
candidate Guillermo Endara won the presidential election 3-1.
   Paredes is an influential member of the National Assembly and
former secretary-general of the government Democratic Revolutionary
Party.
   If the foreign ministers visit Panama, he said, their purpose
should be to discuss ``the war of aggression the United States is
waging against us'' and the freeing of Panamanian funds frozen in
U.S. banks since last year.
   Arias Calderon noted that the three-member commission has until
June 6 to file a report. If Noriega does not accept the report, he
said, the stage will be set for more sanctions against Panama by
the United States and other OAS members.
   Those who oppose Noriega in Panama have been unable to keep
sustained pressure on him and U.S. sanctions have not driven him
out. Washington began trying get rid of Noriega after he was
indicted last year on U.S. drug charges he denies.
   The OAS resolution calls for ``full respect for the sovereign
will of the Panamanian people.'' Over objections by Panama and
Nicaragua, language was added blaming Noriega by name for ``grave
events and abuses.''
   The government newspaper La Critica implied the resolution only
passed because the United States promised to pay the $51 million it
owes the OAS before the end of 1989.
   Panamanian opposition leaders had hoped the OAS would impose
sanctions amounting to a diplomatic and political quarantine unless
the government recognized the opposition candidates as winners of
the election.
   The government claimed its candidate, Carlos Duque, had a 2-1
lead over Endara when it stopped the vote count May 10 and
nullified the election.

   Persons who have AIDS will be allowed to enter
the United States to attend conferences, conduct business or
receive medical treatment under new rules being drafted by
immigration authorities.
   Foreigners infected with AIDS or the HIV virus can apply for
30-day visas provided they do not seek to travel to this country as
tourists, the Justice Department said Thursday.
   The new regulations, to be issued shortly by the Immigration and
Naturalization Service, will allow foreigners infected with AIDS to
visit relatives, conduct business, seek medical treatment or attend
conferences, said Justice Department spokesman David Runkel.
   The regulations were drafted after last month's dispute over a
Dutch AIDS patient who was detained by federal authorities in
Minneapolis while en route to an AIDS conference in San Francisco,
Runkel said.
   An immigration judge overruled the INS' refusal to grant Hans
Paul Verhoef, 31, of Rotterdam, a waiver to an exclusion order.
   Verhoef admitted he had AIDS after U.S. Customs Service agents
at the Minneapolis airport found the drug AZT in his baggage.
   The immmigration judge, whose decision was not appealed by the
Justice Department, held that Verhoef was entitled to an exclusion
waiver because he presented only a minimal risk of infecting others.
   During the hearing, Verhoef pledged to follow safe-sex
procedures to avoid infecting others during his visit.
   INS asks foreigners seeking to enter the country to state
whether they have a contagious disease. Congress added AIDS to the
list two years ago.
   AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is a contagious
disease that attacks the body's immune system, rendering it
incapable of resisting other diseases and infections.
   The incurable condition is believed caused by an unusual virus,
now called human immunodeficiency virus or HIV. The virus,
previously termed HTLV-3 or LAV, is spread through contact with
blood or with semen from infected persons.
   The disease is spread most often through sexual contact, needles
or syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood
products, and from infected pregnant women to their offspring.
   The new regulation is expected to be in place before the June 4
start of the 5th International Conference on AIDS in Montreal.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh had been asked by organizers of
the 1990 conference, scheduled for San Francisco, to relax
restrictions so AIDS patiends could attend the meeting next year.
   There was also concern expressed about people traveling through
this country to the Montreal conference this spring, said Urvashi
Vaid, a spokeswoman for the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force.
   The new rules were called ``a ludicrous policy'' by Pat
Christen, policy director for the San Francisco AIDS Foundation,
which has sought to delete AIDS and the HIV virus that causes the
disease from the list of contagions for which aliens can be
excluded.
   ``There is no reason to believe that a tourist poses any more
public health threat than a business person,'' she said. ``People
with HIV infection are not casually contagious and are not going to
go around transmitting the diseease,'' she said.
   ``It's a disease of consenting adults. We don't need to worry
about foreign invaders with this infection.''

   A top official from a space consulting firm is
bucking a trend and moving to the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration to take charge of its troubled space station program.
   Dr. William B. Lenoir, a former astronaut, is taking the post of
associate administrator for space station, which was recently left
vacant by the third resignation in a year.
   Asked about his moving back to a NASA job when others are
fleeing from NASA to industry, Lenoir joked that ``I get the
buy-low, sell-high part wrong all the time.''
   Lenoir flew in 1982 on the fifth flight of the space shuttle and
left NASA in 1984 for the firm of Booz-Allen &amp; Hamilton, Inc.,
which has a role in the space station program. He is a vice
president and a member of the board of the company and manages its
space systems division.
   Richard Truly, who awaits confirmation as administrator of the
agency, said he appointed Lenoir to the space station post because
``it's a program I'm committed to, it's a program I will continue
to fight for and I want to send the best signal that I can that we
are sending in a team of people that can do that.''
   Truly also announced the appointment of Richard Kohrs as
director of the space station, which will be called Freedom. Kohrs,
currently deputy director of the shuttle program, will be
responsible for design, development and future operations of the
station.
   Ray Tanner becomes deputy director of the station program.
   The space station, now in the design stage, faces rough sledding
from a budget-minded Congress this year _ including efforts to kill
the $32 billion program altogether.
   Lenoir told a news conference announcing his appointment the
program ``must turn the corner'' this year with sufficient funding.
   ``I do think that we should do something that presents this
country with a working space station on the time scale that we have
set, or admit that we can't; set it down and pick it up sometime
later,'' Lenoir said.
   Lenoir's new post was most recently held by Thomas L. Moser, who
served as acting associate administrator for space station for less
than a month before announcing his retirement. Moser had succeeded
James B. Odom, who held the job for only a year before resigning.
   In recent months NASA has lost its administrator, James C.
Fletcher; his deputy, Dale C. Myers, and the third-ranking
official, Noel C. Hinners. Hinners said he resigned partly because
of new federal ethics rules that would place strict restrictions on
post-government employment. He has taken a job with Martin
Marietta, a major space contractor.
   Since Hinners' announcement, there have been a spate of
resignations in various government agencies in addition to NASA. On
Tuesday, President Bush signed legislation to postpone the measure
for 60 days, until July 16.
   The new rules would have banned federal contractors from hiring
government officials who have supervised their competitors'
projects.

<TEXT>
   Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman
David S. Ruder, who was expected to be replaced by President Bush,
is resigning after leading the agency through two of its roughest
years.
   The 60-year-old attorney said Thursday he will return to his
teaching post at Northwestern University School of Law in Chicago
by the end of August. The precise timing of his departure will
depend on when Bush appoints a successor.
   Ruder's term expires in June 1991 and he gave no reason for
leaving. But Bush had been widely expected to replace him even
though senior Democrats in Congress were urging Ruder to stay on.
   Had he remained, Ruder faced the possibility of presiding over a
commission that could have been increasingly out of step with his
views.
   Ronald Reagan, a month before leaving the presidency, replaced
Aulana Peters, a Ruder ally, with Mary Schapiro, a former futures
industry lobbyist. The term of Charles C. Cox, another frequent
Ruder ally, has expired and his nomination by Reagan was never
acted on.
   The list of possible successors includes attorney Thomas A.
Russo, a former division director at the Commodities Futures
Trading Commission, and Edward H. Fleischman, who already holds a
seat on the five-member SEC. Also mentioned are Kraft Inc. Chairman
John M. Richman of Chicago and Harvey L. Pitt, former SEC general
counsel.
   White House spokesman B.J. Cooper said the administration was
reviewing the appointment and declined further comment.
   Ruder, known for his professorial manner, took over the SEC in
August 1987 and two months later found himself embroiled in the
aftermath of October 1987 stock market crash, the sharpest one-day
drop in stock prices since World War I.
   Also during his tenure, the seeds of the agency's historic
investigation of insider trading on Wall Street, planted by his
predecessor John S.R. Shad, bore fruit in the largest-ever
securities fraud case, settled for $650 million by Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc.
   Democrats in Congress were at first skeptical of Ruder, whose
scholarly experience in securities regulation included little
background in prosecution.
   However, one opponent, former Sen. William Proxmire of
Wisconsin, who was chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, now
says, ``I was wrong. ... I think he worked out well.''
   Ruder won friends among Democrats on Capitol Hill during the
post-crash debate over market reform for hewing to a somewhat
independent line from the free-market Reagan administration.
   The White House and Treasury Department resisted any attempt to
combine the regulation of stock and futures markets, which are
regulated with a lighter hand by the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission.
   Ruder, alone among top administration officials, argued that
stock and futures markets are closely linked and said his agency
should coordinate regulation of both.
   Also, in the wake of an outcry from small investors who lost
money in the crash, he pushed the securities industry to improve
its system of arbitrating disputes with customers and to take other
steps to restore public confidence.
   ``Ruder believes strongly in regulation,'' Proxmire said. ``He
believes that securities issuers should be vigorously required to
provide information to investors and if they don't they should be
penalized, fined or jailed.
   ``I think the Reagan administration felt that regulation of our
markets was not desirable and that we should have less regulation
rather than more,'' he said.
   Ruder ``exhibited real political courage in ... proposing
much-needed reform,'' said Rep. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., chairman
of the House Energy and Commerce finance subcommittee.
``Unfortunately for the nation (the reforms) were not supported by
the free-market theorists within the administration.''
   However, Roderick M. Hills, chairman of the SEC during the
administration of Gerald Ford, praised Ruder for resisting pressure
from the most ardent regulation advocates.
   ``I thought he brought an unusually scholarly and calm
perspective to one of the more turbulent times in the market's
history. He probably will be respected more for what he didn't do,
rather than for what he did do. Namely, he didn't overreact,''
Hills said.

<TEXT>
   The airline industry and Boeing Co. are
welcoming government orders that will alter the way airlines keep
aging passenger jets safe.
   In a series of ``airworthiness directives'' announced Thursday,
the Federal Aviation Administration said it plans to order 161
modifications on older Boeing 727s, 737s and 747s and will give
airlines up to four years to comply.
   ``We think this is an important step in the right direction and
will further increase the already high levels of safety in the
industry,'' said Stephen Hayes, vice president of the Air Transport
Association, which represents airlines.
   The directives are expected to become law by late summer, after
a period for comment and modification. They would replace a method
of dealing with aging airliners which requires periodic inspections
and replacements only when parts show excessive wear.
   The FAA said its action ``marks a fundamental change in FAA's
philosophy for maintaining the airworthiness of older aircraft.''
   The FAA estimated the cost of modifying the 115 oldest jets at
$142 million. Other airliners would be affected as they age. An
industry group estimates the orders, which have been anticipated
for several months, eventually will cost U.S. and foreign airlines
more than $800 million and affect 1,300 planes.
   A Boeing statement said other countries' aviation agencies are
expected to adopt the orders.
   ``High standards must be maintained to assure the safety of
aging airplanes until economics dictate their retirement,'' said
Ben Cosgrove, a Boeing senior vice president.
   Only a handful of airliners have been retired in the last decade
as traffic throughout the world continues to increase and orders
for new jets are backlogged. The average age of the worldwide fleet
of passenger jets exceeds 13 years, and aviation experts expect it
to steadily increase.
   The new directives will require replacement or strengthening of
part of the fuselage, wings, doors, tail assembly, landing gear and
engine struts of airliners as they age.
   ``Due to the magnitude of the modification program, FAA
anticipates that the work will be staggered over a period of time
and generally coordinated with other scheduled maintenance,'' the
agency said in explaining its decision to give airlines four years
to comply.
   The action was prompted partly by the April 1988 accident over
Hawaii in which a Boeing 737 which had made almost 90,000 flights
lost an 18-foot section of its fuselage. A flight attendant was
killed but the aircraft landed without any other fatalities.
   The new requirements will force airlines to replace aging parts
earlier in a plane's life: 60,000 flights for 727s, 75,000 for 737s
and 20,000 for 747 jumbo jets. The larger aircraft make fewer but
longer flights. Airliners that reach 20 years old would also be
affected even if they have logged fewer flights.
   One requirement for 747s calls for a major modification of the
fuselage shell structure from the nose to the forward main
passenger entry door. The FAA estimates the work on that and 28
other modifications will require 35,000 man hours per airplane.
   For 737s, 58 changes are mandated, requiring more than 14,000
man hours; for 727s, the 74 required modifications will take more
than 17,000 man hours to complete.
   The FAA said the orders would initially affect 67 Boeing 727s,
28 Boeing 737s and 20 Boeing 747s owned by U.S. airlines.
   The FAA action follows guidelines proposed Feb. 28 by a
150-member task force of aviation industry and government experts
set up by the ATA and the Aerospace Industries Association.
   At that time, task force member Clyde Kizer told an interviewer
that ``the aircraft that are out there right now are perfectly
safe. ... This supplies an extra protection margin.''
   Other task forces are examining airliners manufactured by
McDonnell Douglas and other aircraft builders, and the FAA said it
plans to issue similar directives affecting other planes.

<HEAD>Environmental Group Alerts Skinner To Antarctic Fuel Spill</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An environmental group wants Transportation
Secretary Samuel Skinner to look into a four-month-old accident and
fuel spill involving an Argentine Navy supply ship in Antarctica.
   The Environmental Defense Fund says that while the government
pushes cleanup of the Alaskan oil spill, little attention is being
paid to damage and danger from the Bahia Paraiso, which lies
overturned a mile from the U.S. scientific outpost at Palmer
Station, Antarctica.
   Fund lawyer Bruce Manheim, in a letter Thursday to Skinner, said
the Bahia Paraiso ran aground Jan. 28, spilling 170,000 gallons of
diesel fuel. But 70,000 gallons remain, posing a hazard because the
wreck could be crushed by severe ice conditions which are expected
with the onset of the Antarctic winter this month, he said.
   Manheim urged Skinner to determine the likely fate of fuel still
aboard the vessel, contact Argentine authorities to determine if
they plan further action and ``implement measures to eliminate
further pollution from the ship if a grave or imminent threat of
pollution exists.''
   Manheim said that while the Exxon Valdez spill of 11 million
gallons of crude oil on March 24 into Alaska's Prince William Sound
has produced a massive cleanup effort, Argentina ``has essentially
walked away'' from the Bahia Paraiso shipwreck.
   He asked Skinner to consider acting under international
agreements that Manheim said would allow the United States to
protect marine life and U.S. scientific interests on the icy
continent.
   Transportation Department spokesman Bob Marx said Skinner's
office had received the letter but would have no comment until it
could be reviewed.
   ``We'll see what action we could take,'' said Marx.
   Manheim said the spill has killed seals, penguins and other
Antarctic marine life and has destroyed important U.S. studies on
the effects of ozone depletion.
   ``Antarctica's worst environmental disaster has become a
forgotten oil spill,'' he said. ``The situation is bound to get
worse.''
   The Environmental Defense Fund describes itself as a non-profit
organization of scientists, economists, lawyers and others
interested in finding economically viable solutions to
environmental problems.

<HEAD>Departing Pentagon Official Says Stealth Should Be Canned</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A Pentagon official who left his post a week
ago says the stealth bomber program should be scrapped because of
cost overruns and sloppy quality control by the company building
the long-range bomber, according to a published interview.
   Robert B. Costello, former undersecretary of acquisitions, told
The Washington Post in its Friday editions that Northrop Corp.'s
quality controls on development and production of the planes is
``terrible.''
   He said each of the planes will cost at least $600 million each,
but he said development is in such early stages that the Air Force
might not be able to calculate the true costs.
   Northrop's chief executive officer, Thomas V. Jones, defended
the radar-evading aircraft in a speech Wednesday to shareholders,
saying the airplane has achieved ``unprecedented technological
success.''
   Former Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci fought efforts by
Costello to kill the program, the newspaper said. But the new
Pentagon chief, Richard B. Cheney, has recommended slowing
production by at least a year while costs and technical problems
are reviewed.
   The Air Force has spent $15 billion on the stealth and has six
aircraft in various stages of construction. The program calls for
132 aircraft.

<TEXT>
   The trial of a man charged with killing
Prime Minister Olof Palme has been postponed for up to two weeks.
   Prosecutor Solveig Riberdahl said the reason for the delay was
that defense attorneys had not finished reading all 3,000 pages
from the interrogation files of the suspect, Christer Pettersson.
   The trial was originally set to start on May 29.
   Pettersson, who has a previous manslaughter conviction and long
criminal record, has denied killing Palme. Pettersson was arrested
last December after a lengthy investigation.
   The prime minister was shot to death on a main Stockholm street
on Feb. 28, 1986, while walking home from a movie with his wife.

<HEAD>NRC Approves Low-power License For Controversial Nuclear Plant</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CALLAHAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Low-power tests at the $6 billion Seabrook,
N.H., reactor could begin next week now that the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission has removed the final regulatory obstacle a decade after
the plant was scheduled to go on line.
   An emergency court order is the lone remaining hope for
Massachusetts Gov. Michael S. Dukakis and other Seabrook foes in
their struggle to block a 5 percent power testing license.
   The NRC gave its final approval Thursday by refusing to issue a
regulatory stay of the license, the last in a series of agency
hurdles that has delayed low-power operations for three years.
   The commission, as part of its unanimous ruling, said it would
not issue the license for seven days to give a federal appeals
court time to rule on a request by Seabrook critics to prohibit
low-power testing pending further legal reviews. There was no
indication when the court would rule on the request, filed last
week at the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here.
   NRC Chairman Lando W. Zech Jr. said the agency's staff could
issue the license anytime after 4 p.m. next Thursday if the court
does not grant an emergency stay. A license could come sooner if
the court rules against the opponents' petition. No further
commission consideration is necessary to grant the license.
   ``We have reviewed the concerns,'' Zech said after the brief
vote. ``We have determined at this stage low-power license is
appropriate.''
   Zech said a full-power commercial license could be issued as
early as late September.
   Opponents argue it is impossible to safely evacuate the coastal
towns near Seabrook, especially in the summer when beach-goers clog
narrow access roads. The 1,150-megawatt reactor is two miles from
the Massachusetts border, 40 miles north of Boston.
   ``How anyone thinks you can evacuate people from that site in a
nuclear accident is beyond me,'' Dukakis said at the Massachusetts
Statehouse in Boston.
   Critics also say financial problems _ the lead owner has filed
for bankruptcy protection _ and the requisite approval of emergency
evacuation plans will block Seabrook from ever getting a full-power
license. Therefore, they say, low-power tests would only make the
plant more expensive to dismantle, greatly diminish any chance of
converting it to another form of energy production and pose a
danger to neighboring towns.
   Massachusetts Attorney General James Shannon vowed that state
officials are ``in this fight for the long haul. We have months, if
not years, of litigation ahead of us. The commonwealth remains
resolute in its opposition.''
   Seabrook officials say the plant is safe and is badly needed to
meet New England's energy needs into the 21st century. They say
utility-drafted evacuation plans, written after Dukakis refused to
submit plans for the six Massachusetts municipalities near the
plant, are sufficient. Seabrook's evacuation plans include alerting
Massachusetts neighbors by truck- and helicopter-mounted sirens.
   At Seabrook, New Hampshire Yankee President Ed Brown praised the
ruling, which represents the biggest victory for a plant that is
already a decade behind schedule and billions over budget.
   ``We've reached a milestone that many people said would never
come,'' he said.
   Brown expressed confidence Seabrook officials would win in court
and be able to start low-power testing early next month.
   He rejected criticism that the NRC is biased toward the
industry. ``By any stretch of the imagination, any process that
takes 16 years can't be biased in any respect,'' Brown said.
   The battle over Seabrook has raged since the idea of a New
Hampshire atomic plant was first proposed more than 20 years ago.
Seabrook came to symbolize the anti-nuclear power movement of the
1970s.
   Long past its anticipated operation date of 1979 and with its
sister plant abandoned, Seabrook I was finally completed in 1986,
billions of dollars over budget and still needing regulatory
approval.

<HEAD>Look Who's Laughing Now: Buffalo Rated Best for Summer Weather</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DARREN DOPP</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At last, Buffalo is getting its day in the
sun.
   A new report compiled from three decades of weather data is
literally putting this much maligned city in a new light.
   Buffalo recorded the highest percentage of sunshine _ 67 percent
_ of any major Northeast city from June through August. Buffalo
also had the least rain during the period _ 8.69 inches _ and was
the coolest with an average July afternoon temperature of 80
degrees,
   ``People just can't believe it,'' Robert Carr, a spokesman for
the Greater Buffalo Chamber of Commerce, said Thursday. ``They've
got this misconception that all we have is snow.
   ``Sure, we get our snow, but we get our sun, too,'' Carr added.
   Residents have long complained that on the basis of one storm _
the Blizzard of 1977 _ the city has the reputation of a frozen
tundra.
   Buffalo did have the most snow of any large city during the
1970s, according to the weather service. But other, smaller New
York cities such as Syracuse and Watertown, and Caribou, Maine,
received more snow.
   The last three winters in Buffalo have been unusually mild, with
less than 67 inches of snow. The average yearly total is 96.6
inches.
   Carr and other Buffalo residents are hoping that the new report,
which was compiled by meteorologist Stephen McLaughlin using
weather service data, will help change the city's image.
   ``You can't argue with the statistics,'' Carr said.
   Buffalo's 67 percent sunshine _ the equivalent of two sunny days
out of every three _ edges out Boston at 65 percent; New York City,
64 percent; Baltimore and Washington, each 63 percent;
Philadelphia, 62 percent; Albany, 61 percent; and Pittsburgh, 58
percent.
   Lake Erie, the source of much of Buffalo's snow in winter, is
responsible for its pleasant conditions in summer, according to
meteorologist Jerry Pace of the National Weather Service in Buffalo.
   While cold air moving across warm lake waters generates
lake-effect snows in fall and early winter, warm winds across cold
waters dampen the formation of clouds in spring and early summer,
Pace said.
   In addition, cool breezes off the lake keep summer temperatures
down, so that there are few uncomfortably hot days in Buffalo, he
said.

<HEAD>Drug Czar Urges Students To Report Others Drug Use</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CATHERINE WILSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   William Bennett, visiting his first school as the
nation's drug czar, on Thursday urged students to report ``to an
adult you trust'' any friend with a drug problem.
   ``It isn't snitching or betrayal to tell an adult that a friend
of yours is using drugs and needs some help,'' he said. ``It's an
act of true loyalty, true friendship.''
   Bennett, director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy,
spoke to an assembly at W.R. Thomas Junior High in Dade County.
   ``A true friend doesn't stand aside and watch someone he cares
about use drugs. Maybe your friend will be mad at you for a while.
But in the end, your friend will thank you _ and you may save a
life.''
   The school, recognized as one of 47 drug-free schools nationally
for its program to keep students from trying drugs and to
discipline them if they do, is in the heart of a suburban Dade
County zone dubbed Cocaine Alley.
   ``We heard this was a success and this was a success in an area
where there are a lot of drugs,'' Bennett said at a school
assembly, complimenting students on their achievement. ``If we can
do it here, we ought to be able to do it just about anywhere in
America.''
   Bennett, who late Wednesday went on an undercover crack sting
run by Miami police, said later at a news conference that ``there
are at least 50 fronts in this war'' and cutting both drug supply
and demand are essential.
   ``We've got a flood out there and these guys (police) are out
there with their buckets and their pails bailing us out, but we've
got to turn off the spigot, too,'' he said. ``The threat of law
enforcement in America in many places is not credible.''
   Bennett said drug dealers should expect to go to prison, and he
boosted a Bush administration proposal to immediately seize the
cars of dealers to deliver a clear message.
   Bennett, who plays the lead role in the Bush administration's
anti-drug effort but has little more than advisory power, said he
supports a proposed 16 percent drug budget increase but cautions
that the nation can't rely on the federal government for solutions.
   ``You can't buy your way out of this one,'' he said, but added,
``It's not an argument for not spending more money.''

   House Speaker Jim Wright, his support eroding
among fellow Democrats, is hoping a long-shot legal move in his
fight against ethics charges will rescue his political career.
   But even as Wright expressed confidence he could defeat some of
the charges against him in televised proceedings scheduled Tuesday,
those who elected him speaker were growing more pessimistic about
his chances of holding onto the post.
   ``It's time for a leadership change,'' said Rep. Philip Sharp,
D-Ind., one of the few Democrats willing to say publicly what many
were saying in private. Wright, he said, has become too distracted
by his ethics struggle to run the House's business.
   Another mid-level Democrat, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said many have written off Wright's political fortunes and are now
focusing on the need for a legal defense to protect him from
possible Justice Department action.
   Others questioned Wright's strategy of leaning so heavily on a
motion to dismiss the two most serious charges against him _ that
he used bulk sales of his book to evade outside income limits and
that he improperly accepted $145,000 in gifts from a business
partner with a direct interest in legislation.
   Even an ardent supporter said Wright needed some good news.
   ``It's got to quit raining on the speaker,'' said Rep. Charles
Stenholm, D-Texas. ``The constant addition of problems has not been
helpful. Some things have got to break extremely favorably.''
   In asking the ethics committee to dismiss the charges, Wright
was essentially demanding that the panel abandon a legal
interpretation of House rules that it accepted when it voted to
charge him with 69 rules violations.
   The speaker's defense is that the panel stretched the rules when
it charged him by deeming Fort Worth real estate developer George
Mallick to have a direct interest in legislation and by
characterizing his book royalty earnings as disguised speaking fees.
   But one of Wright's eight lawyers, William C. Oldaker,
acknowledged that motions to dismiss charges are routinely denied,
and put chances of winning next week at probably less than 50-50.
   And ethics committee Chairman Julian Dixon, D-Calif., called the
committee's interpretation of the rules ``very well founded.''
   But Wright, appearing briefly before television cameras on
Thursday, expressed optimism that he would prevail. ``We welcome
the opportunity for our case _ and we believe it is very, very
strong _ to be heard before the full public view,'' he said.
   Wright himself will not appear at the hearing. His lawyers will
be allowed to argue their case for dismissing the charges, and
ethics committee outside counsel Richard Phelan will defend the
committee's action. The hearing will be televised on C-SPAN, the
cable TV public affairs network.
   The full ethics committee, made up of six Democrats and six
Republicans, will then decide whether to grant the motion, probably
sometime later in the week, Dixon said.
   Whatever the outcome, any remaining charges would then become
the subject of a trial-like disciplinary hearing before the
committee. Members would be asked to decide whether there is clear
and convincing evidence of the alleged violations.
   Also on Thursday, the ethics committee denied Wright access to
advisory opinions on ethical questions which the panel has given
other House members, saying that to release them would violate
confidentiality the members receiving the opinions expect.
   It also completed taking depositions in its investigation of a
gas drilling venture which netted Wright $170,000 in profit last
year at a time when he needed $100,000 to pay off a bank loan from
a failed nursing home investment.
   The panel interviewed Tom Law, the Fort Worth attorney who
administers the speaker's blind trust. Law said afterward that the
committee had asked ``very probing'' questions, but declined to
elaborate.
   Wright's office denied reports that the Internal Revenue Service
had launched a preliminary criminal investigation of his business
dealings with Mallick.
   In a statement, Wright said Gary Booth, Dallas district director
of the IRS, had denied to the speaker's lawyer that any
investigation was being conducted. An IRS spokeswoman, citing legal
restrictions, said she could not confirm or deny whether Booth had
made such a statement.

   Gen. Ali Saibou, Niger's president the past
18 months, has been named the sole candidate in the first
presidential elections in this West African country in nearly 20
years.
   Saibou was elected as president of the National Movement for a
Society of Development, which was created last year as the first
political party sanctioned since a 1974 military coup. It remains
the only legal party.
   Saibou, 49, is the third president this landlocked nation of 7
million people on the southern edge of the Sahara has had since it
became independent from France in 1960. Hamani Diori, president
from independence until the 1974 coup, was re-elected in 1965 and
1970.
   Saibou was picked by his fellow army officers to succeed Gen.
Seyni Kountche, who led the coup and held power until his death in
November 1987.
   Under Saibou, all political prisoners have been freed and
workers and students have had greater freedom of expression. But he
has ruled out permitting a multiparty system and said the army will
continue being a major factor in the country's politics.
   Elections are scheduled for December, though no date has been
set.

   Actress Kathleen Turner is fighting termination
of her cooperative apartment house lease because she allegedly
sublet her apartment to her sister-in-law without the board's
permission.
   The star of ``Body Heat,'' ``Romancing the Stone'' and ``Peggy
Sue Got Married'' now lives with her husband, Jay Weiss, in a
townhouse in the city's Greenwich Village. After a year of being
unable to find a buyer for her old apartment, they decided to
sublet it and asked the cooperative board's permission.
   Turner said in court papers she got no reply, so a year later
she renewed her request, naming her sister-in-law as a subtenant.
   On May 1, the sister-in-law and her husband moved into Turner's
apartment. On May 2, the board notified Turner she had violated
co-op rules and threatened to terminate her apartment lease. Turner
moved in court to block the eviction. A hearing scheduled for
Thursday was adjourned until June 29.

   American writer Jerzy Kosinski rolled through
the Israeli-annexed Golan Heights in a tank and said the
Palestinian uprising will forge a new political balance in the
Middle East.
   ``The intefadeh (Arabic for uprising) will have to run its
course, and a new balance will have to emerge,'' Kosinski told The
Associated Press after visiting a tank brigade Thursday in the
northern Golan Heights. ``This is history's balancing act. It is a
powerful test for a powerful democracy like Israel.''
   The uprising against Israeli occupation of the West Bank and
Gaza Strip erupted in December 1987 and has claimed at least 482
Palestinian and 21 Israeli lives.
   During his visit, Kosinski sat in the driver's seat of a tank,
then was driven around in the vehicle. The Polish-born author,
who's written ``Being There'' among other novels, said he had not
been that close to a tank since the Soviets invaded Poland.
   ``The tank gave me a feeling of fear,'' he said.

   Best-selling French author Regine Deforges says
there is no chance a French court will rule in favor of Margaret
Mitchell's heirs in their $750,000 plagiarism lawsuit against her.
   ``France is one country in the world where authors are protected
in their right of free expression,'' The Atlanta Constitution
quoted Ms. Deforges as saying Thursday. ``For them, plagiarism does
not exist. If you take an idea from somebody else, that is all it

   Ms. Deforges, 53, said Miss Mitchell's 1936 epic ``Gone With the

   The Trust Co. of Georgia, executors of Miss Mitchell's estate,

Ms. Deforges for ``exploitation and infringement'' of the novel.
   Ms. Deforges' novel is the story of Lea, a French grape grower's

   Hedda Nussbaum, the battered woman who testified
against Joel Steinberg in the death of their illegally adopted
6-year-old daughter, has been released from a psychiatric hospital
and moved to an apartment.
   One of Nussbaum's lawyers, Betty Levinson, said Thursday that
Nussbaum was discharged several weeks ago and is in outpatient
therapy. She attends weekly meetings of a support group for
battered women, Levinson said.
   Steinberg, Nussbaum's former live-in companion, was convicted
earlier this year of manslaughter and sentenced to up to 25 years
in prison in Lisa's death.
   Charges against Nussbaum, who made the cover of Newsweek as the
case got national attention, were dropped after prosecutors
concluded that she had been so severely beaten by Steinberg that
she was unable to aid the child.
   Nussbaum, a former children's book editor, is on disability
insurance until she finds a job, Levinson said. She has also filed
a $3 million suit against Steinberg and sold the TV rights to her
story, reportedly for $100,000.

   If not for the University of Wisconsin, Phil
Hellmuth Jr. might be a businessman today instead of the world's
best poker player.
   Thanks to the university's rejection of his application to
business school, however, Hellmuth is $755,000 richer after
capturing the World Series of Poker.
   ``I was a little disappointed when they didn't take me,'' said
the 24-year-old Hellmuth. ``But now I'm driving a Cadillac and
doing pretty well.''
   Hellmuth became the youngest champion in the tournament's
20-year history Thursday when he used a pair of kings and nines to
beat two-time defending champion Johnny Chan to capture the $10,000
buy-in tournament.
   ``This is the pinaccle of poker here, the world championship,''
said Hellmuth, of Madison, Wis. ``It's just an incredible feeling.''
   Hellmuth outlasted a record field of 177 other players over the
four-day event, taking only 47 minutes to wipe out Chan's last
$630,000 in chips as the two played head-to-head in the final
showdown of the Texas Hold `em tournament at Binion's Horseshoe
Club.
   The end came when Hellmuth, holding a pair of nines in the hole,
put in all his chips after Chan had raised the bet $100,000. Chan,
of Houston, had an Ace and seven of spades when he called with his
last $330,000 in chips.
   ``I had to gamble sometime and I thought that was a good time to
gamble,'' said Chan, who won $302,000 for finishing second. ``If I
threw my hand away, I only had $330,000 left.''
   Both players stood as the dealer turned the ``flop'' of three
common cards, which gave each a pair of kings. A queen and a six on
the final two cards helped neither player and Hellmuth escaped with
the win.
   Hellmuth finished 33rd last year in his first tournament while
Chan picked up his second straight win.
   The win capped a short professional playing career for Hellmuth,
who turned to poker after dropping out of the University of
Wisconsin when he was refused admittance to the business school. He
came to Las Vegas two years ago to try his luck against seasoned
professionals.
   ``My first 10 trips out here I didn't win a thing,'' he said.
``After that, I started to win pretty consistently.''
   The win was watched by Hellmuth's father, Phil Hellmuth Sr., an

<HEAD>House Panel Seeking FSX Compromise</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARTON REPPERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House Foreign Affairs Committee is trying
to work out a compromise between the Bush administration and the
Senate over the FSX fighter deal with Japan, congressional aides
say.
   The effort comes after Secretary of State James A. Baker III
told the House panel that restrictions contained in the Senate
legislation approving the deal could scuttle the $6 billion plan
for joint development and production of the new warplane.
   In a letter to committee Chairman Dante B. Fascell, D-Fla.,
Baker said the Senate measure ``establishes an unacceptable
precedent infringing on the president's constitutional authority
with respect to the conduct of negotiations with foreign powers.''
   ``The conditions stated in the resolution would put the entire
FSX program and our agreement with Japan at risk. It would require
us to reopen negotiations on unnecessary issues,'' Baker told
Fascell.
   The Senate voted 52-47 on Tuesday to defeat a resolution that
would have scrapped the FSX agreement. But it then voted 72-27 _ a
margin that would override a presidential veto _ to adopt the
restriction proposed by Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va.
   The deals calls for General Dynamics to join with Japan's
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries to develop and produce the fighter, an
advanced version of the U.S. F-16, for deployment by Japan in the
late 1990s. General Dynamics has headquarters in St. Louis, but
most of the FSX work would be done at its F-16 plant in Fort Worth,
Texas.
   Richard Bush, a staff member of the House Foreign Affairs
subcommittee on Asian and Pacific affairs, said the panel is trying
to ``modify the Byrd resolution in such a way that the
administration would be willing to accept it and the president
would be prepared to sign it.''
   He said the ``most serious sticking point'' appears to be a
section that would mandate the U.S. position when negotiations are
undertaken with the Japanese several years from now on a memorandum
of understanding, or MOU, to set terms for coproduction of the FSX.
   The Senate-passed resolution stipulates that the coproduction
MOU shall prohibit transfer to Japan of critical jet engine
technology and bar Japan from exporting the FSX or ``any of its
major subcomponents'' to other countries.
   Linda Krueger, an aide to Rep. Mel Levine, D-Calif., an
outspoken opponent of the FSX, said Levine is working with the
Foreign Affairs Committee staff to develop modified language that
wouldn't require renegotiation of the agreement.
   The compromise is expected to be presented to the House
committee when it meets to consider the issue next Tuesday.
   Baker's opposition to the Byrd measure was underscored by
administration officials who testified Thursday before the Asian
and Pacific affairs subcommittee.
   William Clark Jr., acting assistant secretary of state for East
Asian and Pacific affairs, told the panel that if the Senate-passed
restrictions became law, ``it would have a tremendous impact around
the world'' in future U.S. negotiations with other countries.
   ``If I were on the other side of the table negotiating, I would
be very reluctant to put a lot on the line,'' he said.
   Rep. Stephen J. Solarz, D-N.Y., chairman of the subcommittee,
said that regardless of what Congress does now ``this is going to
be an issue in the future'' in case there are any ``major
violations'' by Japan of the terms of the FSX deal.
   But he added that ``I don't want a renegotiation of the
agreement.''

   Former Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos was
in ``very critical'' condition Thursday, suffering from kidney,
cardiac and pulmonary failure, hospital officials said.
   Marcos, 71, suffered acute renal failure and was taken to St.
Francis Medical Center's operating room late Thursday morning for
vascular access surgery, according to Gene Tiwanak, the hospital's
assistant administrator.
   In the 2}-hour surgical procedure, his veins were prepared for
hemodialysis, or the removal of body wastes from his blood by
machine, Tiwanak said.
   Marcos also experienced cardiac and pulmonary failure Thursday,
Tiwanak said.
   ``The prognosis is very poor and his condition is very
critical,'' Tiwanak said.
   Marcos, who was undergoing kidney dialysis, suffered severe
infection, including pneumonia, according to Dr. Azucena Ignacio,
his personal physician and an internist at St. Francis.
   Ignacio said Marcos was being treated with antibiotics and a
heart medication, which she refused to name.
   ``Some medications are working, some are not,'' Ignacio said.
   Marcos family was informed of his worsening condition and that
he was conscious before surgery, and had been conscious on and off
since, she said.
   ``The problem is that his kidneys failed and we had to get him
on dialysis quick,'' Tiwanak said.
   The deposed president, who is also suffering from pneumonia, was
placed on dialysis in the hospital's intensive care unit, Tiwanak
said.
   The procedure was not life-threatening, but the hours following
the surgery would be crucial, considering Marcos' frail health, the
hospital administrator said.
   Earlier, Marcos spokesman Gemmo Trinidad had said Marcos had
only a 2 percent chance of surviving the operation, but Tiwanak
refused to comment on Marcos' prospects.
   Marcos' wife, Imelda, was praying in the hospital chapel with
son Ferdinand Jr., nicknamed ``Bong Bong,'' Trinidad said.
   Asked if the Marcos family had given up hope, Trinidad said,
``No, we have always thought he would live. The thought of him
dying has never entered our minds.''
   Mrs. Marcos left the hospital later in the evening without
discussing the situation with the news media.
   ``I believe the hospital has issued a medical bulletin and
that's all I'm going to say,'' Mrs. Marcos said before getting into
a van.
   ``She's on her way to the house to make one call, one last
appeal'' to Philippine President Corazon Aquino to let Marcos
return home, said Marcos aide Arturo Aruiza, who accompanied Mrs.
Marcos.
   Mrs. Aquino has repeatedly cited national security in rejecting
previous Marcos' requests to return to his homeland.
   Marcos has been hospitalized for heart, kidney and respiratory
ailments since Jan. 15. He was moved to the hospital's intensive
care unit on Monday and lapsed into critical condition the
following day. Before that, he had spent a month in the telemetry
ward, which monitors heart patients.
   The former president and his wife are under U.S. indictment on
charges of diverting more than $100 million from the Philippines
during their 20-year reign. Marcos has been separated from the case
because of health problems, but the case against his wife continues.
   The Marcoses have lived in exile in Hawaii since they were
toppled in a popular uprising in February 1986.
   Marcos has been hospitalized here three times since early
December for pneumonia, bronchial asthma and congestive heart
failure. He last entered the hospital Jan. 15 and underwent a
tracheostomy Feb. 1, after which he lapsed into critical condition.
   He eventually was upgraded to guarded condition and transferred
out of the intensive care unit, but doctors said he was
``chronically ill'' and unlikely to recover.

<TEXT>
   Share prices fell Friday on the
Manila Stock Exchange following rumors that ousted President
Ferdinand Marcos had died in Hawaii, traders said.
   Marcos was reported in critical condition Thursday in a Honolulu
hospital after undergoing emergency surgery. Hospital officials
said the 71-year-old former Philippines leader was suffering from
kidney, cardiac and pulmonary failure.
   There was no immediate reaction from President Corazon Aquino to
Marcos' illness. Mrs. Aquino succeeded Marcos after the 1986
uprising that toppled his administration and forced him into exile
in Hawaii.
   But the Manila Stock Exchange's composite index fell to 1,084.53
from Thursday's close of 1,102.97.
   Traders said rumors of Marcos' death triggered a selling wave
around 11:40 a.m. that continued throughout the session.
   ``It provided a good reason for market participants to take
profits,'' said Edward Lee, president of Citisecurities Inc.
   Manila radio stations, the principal source of news for most
Filipinos, broadcast frequent reports on Marcos' condition
throughout the day.
   In Honolulu, Gene Tiwanak, assistant administrator of St.
Francis' Medical Center, said Marcos also suffered cardiac and
pulmonary failure.
   ``The prognosis is very poor and his condition is very
critical,'' Tiwanak said.
   The deposed president, who is also suffering from pneumonia, was
placed on dialysis in the hospital's intensive care unit, Tiwanak
said.
   Mrs. Aquino has refused to allow Marcos to return from Hawaii,
citing national security reasons. On Thursday, presidential
Executive Secretary Catalino Macaraig said there was no change in
that position.
   On Friday, the Philippine Daily Globe reported from Honolulu
that doctors had told U.S. and Filipino officials that
``progressive and massive organ failure is beginning to take
place.''
   The newspaper, citing unidentified sources, said doctors
believed Marcos could ``fight back'' if his will to live was strong.
   ``If he does fight back and lasts several more days, it won't be
because our diagnosis is wrong,'' the paper quoted doctors as
saying.
   The report appeared before word from Hawaii that Marcos had
undergone surgery.

   Congress should quickly make up its mind about
whether to approve President Bush's plan to proceed with
development of two kinds of land-based nuclear missiles, says the
top Republican on the House Armed Services Committee..
   Rep. Bill Dickinson, R-Ala., asked Defense Secretary Dick Cheney
to seek congressional approval if he intends to use money
designated for deployment of the rail-mobile MX missile to keep the
Midgetman missile program alive for the remainder of fiscal 1989.
   In his new Pentagon budget request for fiscal 1990, Bush calls
for $1.2 million for deployment of the MX and $100 million to
continue research and development of the Midgetman.
   Both weapons are intended to be part of the nation's land-based
arsenal of atomic-tipped missiles, but critics say the efforts to
cut the federal deficit mean both weapons can't be built.

   Helms on Thursday persuaded the Senate Foreign Relations

board.
   Helms, who opposed many of Kissinger's policies during his State

<TEXT>
   It's been two years since Garrison
Keillor came to Denmark to lead the life of a ``tall, silent
person,'' leaving behind Buster the Showdog, Sheila the Christian
Jungle Girl and other inhabitants of Lake Wobegon.
   During that time, he returned to the United States and managed
to put another book on the market. Now he's looking ahead to his
autumnal return to U.S. radio.
   He announced Thursday that his new, two-hour ``American Radio
Company of the Air'' will be produced by Minnesota Public Radio and
distributed by American Public Radio. It will feature Keillor
sketches, monologues and a mixture of American music.
   Keillor still calls Minnesota home, even though he has a place
in Manhattan, and makes frequent trips to his wife Ulla Skaerved's
native Denmark where they also have an apartment.
   His new book, ``We Are Still Married,'' is a potpourri of
letters, poems and stories written during the Reagan years. His
first book was about his fictional hometown, ``LakeWobegon Days.''
His next was ``Leaving Home.''
   More than 4 million people tuned into American Public Radio's
``A Prairie Home Companion,'' Keillor's hit radio show that
celebrated the Norwegian bachelor farmers and others of the quiet,
imaginary little town of Lake Wobegon _ the town that time forgot.
The show started in 1974 and Keillor gave the last broadcast in
June 1987.
   To the end, ``A Prairie Home Companion'' was Keillor's show,
reflecting his diverse and sometimes cornball musical tastes and
his affection for small-town life. After leaving the show, Keillor
felt unsettled and at loose ends.
   ``The worst possible thing is when all your dreams come true.
And mine did, including some I didn't realize I had. But I felt
better about facing up to those things in Minnesota,'' he said in
an interview.
   His old show was broadcast from St. Paul, but the 46-year-old
Keillor staged it in Lake Wobegon, Minn., which became so familiar
that some listeners thought it was a real town.
   The monologues grew from a regional hit show into a national
phenomenon running more than a decade. Keillor's best-selling
``Lake Wobegon Days'' was the book version of his radio humor.
   The radio show made Keillor a nationally known figure. Wider
recognition came after the success of the book, and it generated a
resentment that he said took him by surprise.
   ``If somebody I'd gone to school with, whom I didn't think was
that smart to begin with, had written a book that sold a whole lot
of copies ... I would envy him. I know that I would,'' he said.
   Keillor said he felt forced to give up his home when the local
press took too much interest in his private life. ``It bewildered
me. I had no idea what they were aiming at,'' said Keillor. He felt
hatred directed against him, which was entirely strange to him.
   What bothered him most was that he couldn't see anything funny
about it: ``Usually I can think of something humorous about
something, but I've never been able to write about that. It just
seems so utterly grim.''
   Today, Keillor thinks less about that time, which he calls
awkward, confusing and embarrassing.
   He confessed to escaping the Midwest, first to Europe, then to
New York. ``I fled first to Copenhagen, sort of under the illusion
that I could live over here,'' he said.
   Keillor's move to Denmark was accompanied by much fanfare,
particularly since his humor played on themes of small-town America
and values inherited from the Scandinavian immigrants who settled
his Lake Wobegon. But he had problems working here, and found he
could write more easily in the United States.
   ``I was embarrassed and had to go back to America. I suppose
that was kind of embarrassing, too, to have failed so publicly, to
have planted your flag so publicly and having to pull it out,'' he
said.
   Denmark provided some anonymity, but the humorist feels like a
tourist here, and he cannot foresee adjusting to the Danish scene.
While in Copenhagen, he mixes socially with Danes and with other
Americans, shoots baskets near his home and does occasional
speaking engagements.
   After only a short spell on his first visit to the country, he
was so taken with Denmark that he thought it could be material for
a book. But that feeling of newness has worn off, and he now feels
he'd have trouble writing a few good paragraphs.
   Nonetheless, he has spent a good deal of time over the past
three years in Denmark and plans to continue doing so.
   ``I think it is such an amazing thing to come to another country
and marry someone from another country. It's miraculous,'' he said.
``And then to do it in middle age, to have a passionate romance
when you're 43. I can't wish things were different.''

<HEAD>De la Garza Concerned About Lunch Program, Food Bank Shortages</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   School lunch programs could face milk and
cheese shortages as early as this fall because excesses of dairy
products have been reduced, says the chairman of the House
Agriculture Committee.
   Because Congress passed legislation four years ago to reduce
excess dairy-farm output, surpluses available for government
purchase have been sharply reduced, Rep. Kika de la Garza, D-Texas,
said Thursday.
   ``We had to change the legislation and reduce the expenses of
the government ... and once the surplus stock is reduced then we
don't have enough for the school lunch and commodity distribution
programs for the poor,'' de la Garza said.
   ``Food banks, food for the elderly, Head Start, every place that
gets butter, cheese, non-fat dry milk is being reduced or will have
to be reduced because we don't have the ample surplus,'' he said.
   Jack Parnell, deputy secretary of agriculture, has confirmed
that ``due to reduced surplus production of dairy goods there will
far less milk and other dairy products to distribute to school
districts for use in lunch programs across the nation,'' de la
Garza said.
   A spokeswoman for the Food and Nutrition Service, the
Agriculture Department agency that administers the school lunch
program, agreed there will be less dairy products available next
fall.
   Kelly Shipp, spokeswoman for Agriculture Secretary Clayton
Yeutter, said the milk and cheese in question are ``bonus''
commodities given to schools in addition to what they ordinarily
receive.
   ``The problem is we don't have it,'' she said. ``The stocks (of
non-fat dry milk and cheese) are so low, we have a very limited
amount.''
   De la Garza said the Commodity Credit Corp. purchased 12.3
billion pounds of surplus dairy goods in fiscal 1986 for
distribution to various agencies. The following year purchases
dropped to 5.4 billion pounds.
   According to figures from the Department of Agriculture, the CCC
purchased 9.7 billion pounds in fiscal 1988 and current projections
indicate this year's totals will reach at least 8.2 billion.
   But a USDA official said most of the 7.4 billion pounds of food
purchased to date has been butter. The official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said cheese represents only a fraction of
this year's purchases and not one pound of non-fat dry milk has
been bought since last June.
   The official said USDA can only buy what the dairy industry
offers to sell. This year, because of a strong commercial demand
for non-fat dry milk and cheese, most of the products offered to
the government under the price support program have been butter.
   De la Garza said some commodities may have to be bought on the
open market, but the cost would be about one-third more expensive
than purchasing surplus milk and cheese.

   Dissident Exxon Corp. shareholders
dragged their chairman through a 4-hour, 20-minute annual meeting
on Thursday, challenging him to explain the company's actions in
the nation's worst oil spill.
   Outside, about 250 demonstrators gathered peacefully, listening
to speeches by ecologist Barry Commoner and others. Three dozen
police officers kept them from the entrance of the suburban hotel
35 miles west of New York City where the meeting was held.
   Exxon Chairman Lawrence G. Rawl rejected one suggestion that he
resign from the biggest American oil company and another suggestion
that he put his Exxon shares into a special fund for ensuring oil
tanker safety.
   But he assured stockholders that he and other Exxon management
would be part of major policy changes at the company, including
random drug testing.
   ``I want you to know there's going to be equity,'' Rawl told
about 1,700 Exxon shareholders attending the first annual meeting
since the March 24 spill by the tanker Exxon Valdez. ``We will have
random testing of our people and of senior management, including me.
   Exxon President Lee Raymond said the number of customers who had
returned their Exxon credit cards, apparently in response to the
oil spill, was up to 18,000 out of a total of 7 million.
   ``As we've said before, the board and all of our employees are
profoundly sorry about the impact this major accident has had on
the natural environment and the people who live and work in the
region,'' Rawl told about 2,000 shareholders and others.
   ``The accident itself cannot be undone,'' he said.
   ``In time when the job is done I'm confident that it will be
evident to every fair-minded person that our employees met this
major challenge with a high level of determination and
professionalism.
   ``We're determined to show through deeds that we really care
about the environment and wildlife,'' Rawl said.
   Rawl showed a 15-minute film prepared by Exxon on the March 24
spill by the Exxon Valdez in Alaska's Prince William Sound.
   During a prolonged question-and-answer session afterward, Rawl
rejected a suggestion that he resign, made by Ed Rothschild of the
activist group Citizen Action.
   ``The answer is, no, I won't,'' Rawl said to a mixture of
applause and boos. He said his resignation would distract the
company at a critical time.
   ``Management has to take responsibility,'' said shareholder
Dorothy Braude Edinburg. ``Some heads have to fall.''
   Some shareholders came for the excitement of potential
confrontation between environmentalists and company management. In
fact, the questioning was tough but orderly.
   ``We expected fireworks and didn't see it,'' said shareholder
Herbert Forrest.
   Outside the meeting, Commoner, a former presidential candidate,
told the crowd that the spill points out what he called U.S.
overreliance on fossil fuels.
   ``We are here to pass judgment on a crime against nature and the
American people,'' Commoner said. ``That is the only adequate
description for what Exxon has done in Alaska.''
   One demonstrator, Isabel Byrd of Trenton, N.J., was dressed in
an overstuffed tuxedo, wore a pig's nose and walked on stilts. She
identified herself as a ``pig from Exxon,'' and said her outfit
represented the company's corporate mentality.
   ``We just came to say we don't have to care, because we're
Exxon,'' said Ms. Byrd. ``We're greedy and we're pigs.''
   A federal investigation began this week into the causes of the
spill, which has fouled hundreds of miles of Alaskan waters and
coastline and killed numerous fowl and wildlife.
   Several pension funds with large holdings of Exxon stock
publicized their dissatisfaction earlier this month with the
company's handling of the spill and cleanup. The groups also
demanded changes in what they called Exxon's ``inadequate state of
preparedness'' for dealing with future problems and said thy would
vote their shares against Exxon management if it failed to
adequately address those concerns.
   Alaska pension fund officials said they would withhold their
650,600 shares from voting to underscore the state's concern about
the spill.
   The largest shareholders included pension funds from New York
City, New York State and the California Public Employee Retirement
System, the largest individual U.S. public pension fund.
   Together, the funds own more than 20 million shares of Exxon
stock valued at more than $800 million, amounting to less than 2
percent of the company's total 1.33 billion outstanding common
shares.
   In the final tally at the meeting, 976.6 million shares, or 77.8
percent, were voted in favor of electing the current slate of
directors.
   Among the demands by the institutional shareholders were the
appointment to the board of an environmental expert and the
formation of a committee to review Exxon policies on the
environment and worker safety and health.

   No longer woebegone are those longing for a
fresh dip in Lake Wobegon.
   Garrison Keillor, the folksy humorist and best-selling author
whose radio program ``A Prairie Home Companion'' warmed audiences
for 13 years, announced Thursday he will be back on the radio come
fall after a two-year absence.
   The fictional Minnesota town of Lake Wobegon will be back in his
new show, Keillor said at a news conference following his address
to a public radio conference, but the ``town that time forgot'' has
undergone changes.
   ``A lot of things have happened to Lake Wobegon ... it's hard to
make them into humor,'' he said. ``Times have been hard back there,
as they have been all across the Midwest.''
   His new, two-hour ``American Radio Company of the Air'' will be
produced by Minnesota Public Radio and distributed by American
Public Radio. It will feature Keillor sketches, monologues and a
mixture of American music.
   Keillor, 46, said the music will include Fats Waller, Aaron
Copland, Leonard Bernstein, old hymns and ``all the great things
that every American ought to hear at least twice.''
   His new program will be performed before theater audiences in
New York, St. Paul, Minn., and other cities in 12-show series in
the fall of 1989 and spring 1990. It will be broadcast live
Saturday nights starting Sept. 30.
   Despite estimates that his show had a following of more than 4
million, Keillor said he has about 13,000 true fans while others
``talk about buttermilk biscuits and the `Home on the Prairie
Show.'''
   Minnesota Public Radio spokeswoman Susan Jensen in St. Paul
declined to comment about the differences or similarities between
``Prairie Home'' and the new show. Minnesota Public Radio produced
his old show, which was broadcast from St. Paul.
   Asked what his new show will be like, Keillor replied, ``I can't
wait to find out.''
   Keillor joked that he and Minnesota Public Radio officials
talked about doing a new show ``as a joke and it was one of those
jokes that got out of hand.''
   But he said that when he envisions himself back on stage, ``it's
nothing but wonderful.''
   Two years ago he announced he was leaving his fictional hometown
of Lake Wobegon in order to ``resume the life of a shy person.''
   He abandoned Sheila the Christian Jungle Girl, Norwegian
bachelor farmers and other Lake Wobegon inhabitants in an attempt
to leave an increasing frustration with notoriety and resentment
that accompanied his fame and fortune.
   Keillor also criticized the media for intruding on his privacy
by interviewing his neighbors, photographing his house and printing
his address.
   ``I've always been pleased if people come up and I expect them
to, and I get upset if they don't,'' he said Thursday, adding,
``there's a fine line that a person has to defend. Otherwise your
life becomes weird.''
   After his last broadcast in June 1987, Keillor took up residence
in wife Ulla Skaerved's native Denmark. But he found it hard to
work there.
   ``I suppose that was kind of embarrassing, too, to have failed
so publicly, to have planted your flag so publicly and having to
pull it out,'' he said.
   Now he calls Minnesota home again, but has a place in Manhattan
and plans to retain his Copenhagen apartment.
   ``Home is a spiritual place,'' he said Thursday, ``and in some
ways I feel closer to Minnesota and Lake Wobegon'' living in New
York and Copenhagen.
   ``That's how you get to know your family,'' he quipped. ``By
moving away to a desirable place.''

<HEAD>Western Relief Workers Operate Despite Abductions, Shellings</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   More than 60 Western relief workers are
defying kidnappers and constant shellings to aid Palestinian
refugees and tens of thousands of Lebanese displaced by the
country's 14-year civil war.
   But a recent spate of abductions has raised questions whether
the risks are worth it.
   Some non-governmental aid agencies have withdrawn their
officials in recent weeks after their relief workers, once
considered immune from Lebanon's kidnap gangs, were abducted by
Moslem militants.
   On Thursday, the PLO told four West German relief workers to
leave a Palestinian refugee camp after they refused to say who
kidnapped some of their colleagues.
   Fourteen aid officials _ four Swiss Red Cross officials, four
West Germans, an Irishman, a Swede, a Norwegian, a Briton, a
Belgian and a Syrian _ have been abducted since 1985.
   Most were released after periods ranging from hours to a month.
Three, including a West German kidnapped twice, remain missing,
along with 15 other Western hostages. Longest held of the hostages
is American Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The
Associated Press, who was abducted March 16, 1985.
   But 20 organizations are still functioning, providing badly
needed help to a growing number of homeless people and refugees.
   ``There's no question of us leaving,'' said Francoise Derron,
spokeswoman for the International Committee of the Red Cross
(ICRC), which has 13 Swiss officials in Moslem west Beirut, the
largest foreign relief team in Lebanon.
   Like most aid officials interviewed, she declined to discuss
security arrangements. But, she stressed, ``We're going to continue
our work, especially a big program of aid distribution to the
displaced people.''
   More than 750,000 people have fled Beirut's Christian and Moslem
sectors since fierce artillery and rocket battles broke out March 8
between army commander Gen. Michel Aoun's mainly Christian forces
and an alliance of Syrian troops and Moslem allies.
   Ms. Derron said ICRC teams have distributed blankets, kitchen
sets and food parcels to 61,000 people whose homes were destroyed
by the shelling or who were forced to flee.
   The Red Cross pulled out its 30-strong team Dec. 21 following
death threats from unidentified extremists. But the Geneva-based
organization sent a smaller team back Feb. 7.
   The Swiss Terre Des Hommes group has not replaced three Swiss
workers it withdrew in December after the Red Cross pullout.
   The Belgian-based Medicins Sans Frontieres withdrew its four
Belgian doctors and nurses from west Beirut in December. It
replaced them with two Spanish doctors last month.
   Belgian physician Jan Cools, 32, who worked with the Norwegian
aid group NORWAC, was kidnapped nearly a year ago _ May 21 _ in
south Lebanon.
   A previously unknown group, ``The Soldiers of Justice,'' claimed
it abducted him because he was a spy. He remains missing.
   ``Despite Cools' disappearance, we've never stopped working and
we'll try to continue,'' said NORWAC coordinator Gretha Jensen.
   A West German team working with the ASME-Humanitas group in
Sidon, provincial capital of south Lebanon, have become the most
recent targets for extremists.
   Two of them _ administrator Heinrich Struebig and nurse Petra
Schnitzler _ have been kidnapped twice in the space of two weeks.
They and colleague Markus Quint were first abducted May 4 near
Sidon by unidentified gunmen.
   Struebig and Ms. Schnitzler were freed after a few hours,
apparently to relay a message to Bonn that Quint would be freed if
a Frankfurt court handed down a light sentence on Lebanese Shiite
Moslem Mohammed Ali Hamadi.
   Hamadi, on trial for taking part in the 1985 hijacking of a TWA
jetliner and the slaying of a U.S. Navy diver, was convicted this
week of air piracy and murder and sentenced to life in prison.
   Quint was freed after 11 days in captivity, apparently after
intervention by Shiite leader Nabih Berri.
   Struebig defiantly told reporters last week: ``We won't leave.''
   But he and Ms. Schnitzler were kidnapped again May 16 with
another colleague, 28-year-old male nurse Thomas Kemptner.
   Ms. Schnitzler was freed when Moslem militiamen inadvertently
intercepted her abductor's car. But the two men remain missing.
   While mystery still shrouds these abductions, the Palestine
Liberation Organization accused the Germans of deliberately
concealing their kidnappers' identities and blatantly ignoring
security precautions.
   The PLO, which controls the refugee camps where they work, asked
them get out of south Lebanon and the group said they would leave.
   Unlike most aid officials, the 11 Westerners working for the
U.N. Relief and Works Agency, which cares for Palestinian refugees,
use bulletproof cars and move around protected by heavily armed
Lebanese bodyguards.
   UNRWA spokesman Iman Kasrawi, a Palestinian, said the agency,
which employs 2,700 Palestinians and Lebanese, has no plans to
evacuate its foreign staff.
   Two have been kidnapped and freed. But British writer Alec
Collett, on assignment with UNRWA, was abducted in 1985 and his
kidnappers claimed they killed him.

   Mikhail Gorbachev ended his landmark visit to
China after restoring sanity to Sino-Soviet relations and gaining
new marching mates on the tortuous road to socialist reform.
   The first goal was accomplished Tuesday, when the Soviet leader
met a smiling Deng Xiaoping, China's supreme leader, to normalize
state and party relations after 30 years of hostility.
   ``A long period of mutual alienation is now behind us,''
Gorbachev said later in a speech.
   But the breathtaking scene of 1 million Chinese in the streets
clamoring for democratic reforms added an unexpected dimension to
the first meeting of Chinese and Soviet leaders in three decades.
   More than disrupt the summit schedule, the protests appeared to
elicit an empathy among leaders determined to carry out reform but
beset by critical social problems.
   Gorbachev, while refusing to take sides in China's internal
problems, consoled the Chinese by noting the turmoil he faces from
unrest among various ethnic groups.
   The Soviet leader reasoned that disturbances did not represent a
crisis for socialism but were a natural consequence of the reforms
undertaken by both China and the Soviet Unionn.
   ``Glasnost and the pluralism of views have laid bare problems
which were piling up for decades without solution. Popular
aspirations often run ahead of the reforms,'' he said.
   ``Without democratizing the economy,'' Gorbachev said,
``perestroika (economic reforms) will never succeed.''
   The Chinese seemed of similar opinion. Premier Li Peng, in words
partially meant for domestic consumption, said China will improve
its record on freedom, democracy and human rights.
   Senior leader Deng Xiaoping, the father of China's decade-old
market-oriented economic reforms, agreed with Gorbachev that the
theories of Karl Marx belong to the 19th century and are not always
applicable today.
   The two sides also made it clear that democratic reforms do not
mean multiparty rule. If the party is properly supervised,
Communist Party General Secretary Zhao Ziyang said, ``I believe
that the Chinese citizens can enjoy genuine democracy and freedom''
under one-party rule.
   ``To take into account and harmonize the various interests'' of
the people under one party, Gorbachev added at a news conference,
``we need democracy and glasnost.''
   Gorbachev and the Chinese were in somewhat less accord about the
meaning of ``normalization.'' Gorbachev spoke in glowing terms
about the potentials for trade, cultural and technical exchanges
and close consultations on international affairs.
   He envisioned an ideal world in which the 4,300-mile Sino-Soviet
boundary, heavily militarized since the outbreak of fighting in
1969, becomes a ``border of peace and good-neighborliness'' with
all troops removed.
   Gorbachev also said the Soviet Union, having opened the door to
China, hopes to become an integral member of the Asian community.
He again promoted the concept of a collective security arrangement
among Asians and stressed that ``this is the region where the fate
of our civilization will be played out.''
   The Chinese were generally less positive, emphasizing they will
never return to the relationship of the 1950s when Beijing was
subservient to Moscow and repeating that normal ties will not
affect relations with other countries _ namely the United States.
   Disagreement continued over Cambodia, where Moscow-backed
Vietnamese troops backing the government are to end their 10-year
occupation by the end of September and where Beijing-supported
Khmer Rouge rebels are fighting for control.
   The issue took up the most space in the summit's joint
communique. China reiterated its call for a coalition government
headed by Prince Norodom Sihanouk, a moderate backed by Washington,
while the Soviets said only that the civil war should be settled by
Cambodians.

<HEAD>Veteran Editor of `Jane's Fighting Ships' Dead</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Raymond Blackman, one of the world's leading
experts on foreign navies and veteran editor of the renown military
reference book ``Jane's Fighting Ships,'' has died, his family said
today. He was 78.
   ``Jane's Fighting Ships'' is one of the volumes on military
hardware and other subjects produced annually by the Jane's
publishing house and studied by defense forces around the world.
   Blackman, who edited ``Fighting Ships'' from 1949-73, died
Wednesday. His family gave no cause of death. He lived at
Portsmouth, the home of a major Royal Navy base, on the south coast
of England.
   Born in Portsmouth, he joined the Royal Navy at the age of 16
and served for 10 years, having trained as a naval engineer.
   He then took up journalism and became naval correspondent for
``The Hampshire Telegraph and Post,'' a local newspaper covering
the Portsmouth area.
   He rejoined the Royal Navy at the outbreak of World War II in
1939, working in the mine design department at Portsmouth
developing mines and anti-submarine weapons.
   After the war, he returned to journalism and from 1946 to 1956
was naval correspondent of The Sunday Times, the weekly sister
paper of The Times of London.
   He also wrote for technical publications on naval matters and
broadcast on naval topics. He first became associated with `Jane's
Fighting Ships'' in 1930.
   The Jane's publishing empire was founded by British artist and
journalist Fred Thomas Jane in 1898, when he produced the first
``Jane's Fighting Ships.'' The book was an instant success.
   Jane's says information is gathered for the volumes by
monitoring world publications on the subject, questioning
industrial sources and tapping the expert knowledge and sources of
each editor.
   As editor of ``Jane's Fighting Ships,'' Blackman was constantly
in touch with more than 100 navies around the world and maintained
a network of international contacts who helped confirm details when
official information was lacking.
   Blackman was also the author of ``Modern World Book of Ships''
in 1951, of successive editions of ``The World's Warships'' and of
``Ships of the Royal Navy'' in 1973.
   He was honored by Queen Elizabeth II in 1970 by being made a
Member of the Order of the British Empire.
   He is survived by his wife, a son and a daughter.

   One week after a freight train
careened out of control, killing four people and devastating a
neighborhood, survivor Ramon Esqueda leaned on his crutches and
said goodbye to his ruined home.
   ``I was 20 feet from death,'' he said, speaking in Spanish.
   Esqueda was standing just below the railroad tracks in his back
yard, filling in a hole dug by his dogs, when the Southern Pacific
freight train came roaring down steep Cajon Pass and slammed into
11 homes along the tracks. Two crewmen and two boys in a house died
in the May 12 accident.
   Esqueda escaped by leaping the 6-foot fence he and his family
members had painstakingly erected after moving in just a month
earlier. In making it to safety, he wrenched his back and an ankle.
   Federal investigators have found the braking systems on three of
the train's six locomotives were faulty. The train also apparently
was heavier by about 3,000 tons than the weight given to the crew.
   The Federal Railroad Administration said Thursday that drug and
alcohol tests were negative for the three surviving crewmen and the
two dead trainmen.
   Bulldozers have torn down seven of the most severely damaged
homes. On Thursday, they waited to level Esqueda's house and the
one next door, where Dossie Reed, 71, and her daughter, Tommie
Fowler, 46, watched the movers hired by Southern Pacific to
relocate the family.
   Neither family knew where it would go. Both are being housed in
hotels at the expense of Southern Pacific, which also is buying the
houses, moving residents and storing their goods until they find
new homes.
   ``I liked it here,'' Mrs. Reed said. ``The kids were secure
here. The neighbors was all nice. Catch the kids doing anything _
they'd make them stop.''
   George Greenwood's home was not badly damaged and won't be
purchased by the railroad.
   ``They say the worst is over. The worst has just begun,'' he
said.
   Greenwood's family, including a new grandchild, has refused to
return to the house, and he fears he won't be able to sell now that
the neighborhood has been marked by the accident.
   ``I can't do anything, but exactly what they want me to do _
just stay here and die,'' he said. ``They tore my family up.''
   Esqueda's home was knocked off its foundation by train cars, and
the roof was cracked. Potted rose bushes lay smashed on the ground.
The family recently had finished fixing up the house since moving
from Los Angeles, 50 miles to the west.
   Without irony, Esqueda explained why he chose the neighborhood:
``It's nice and calm.''
   ``After this we're going to live in the middle of the airport,''
said his nephew, Eric Gonzalez, 13. ``And after that in the desert
where they're testing the bombs.''
   Eric, whose mother and two sisters also lived in the house, said
the family was just beginning to enjoy the gray and white stucco
home.
   Now, like Mrs. Reed, 71, they want to stay as far away from
trains as possible.
   ``I'm still afraid,'' she said. ``It seems like I (always) hear
train whistles or hear brakes ... I think this track should be
closed.''
   As the families spoke, the bulldozers roared. Mounds of potash,
spilled from the train cars, was scooped into trucks. Pieces of
rail protruded from the mounds of sandy mineral.
   A lawyer videotaped the work. His chemist assistant took a
sample of the potash. Across the track, sightseers took pictures of
the twisted train cars and mangled locomotives.
   The area where the homes were demolished will be planted with
grass and left vacant to guard against future tragedies.
   By nightfall, investigator William Pugh with the National
Transportation Safety Board reported the area was cleared and
leveled.
   ``It looks like it's almost ready for grass,'' he said.

   The U.S. dollar closed slightly lower against the
Japanese yen Friday, while the Tokyo Stock Exchange regained its
losses of the previous day.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which lost
136.12 points Thursday, gained 144.65 points, or 0.44 percent, to
finish the week at 34,000.98.
   The dollar closed at 138.77 yen, down 0.11 yen from Thursday's
finish of 138.88 yen. Opening lower at 138.55 yen, the currency
moved between 138.15 yen and 138.90 yen.
   Traders said the dollar slipped following its overnight decline
in New York, spurred by coordinated intervention by central banks
in the United States and Europe.
   During morning trading, the Bank of Japan stepped into the
market, selling an estimated $400 million to support the yen,
traders said.
   On the stock exchange, the market's main index suffered a slight
setback in early trading due to speculation over a possible hike in
the nation's key interest rates, but later rebounded on
expectations of higher prices next week, dealers said. It was also
helped by the dollar's slight retreat against the yen, they added.

<TEXT>
   More than 5 million new cases of AIDS could
develop during the next decade, the World Health Organization said
in its longest-term forecast to date.
   The number of people infected by the virus, but not necessarily
having the disease, could quadruple by the end of the century from
the currently estimated 5 to 10 million people, the U.N. agency
said Thursday.
   The projections are ``much worse than what we have experienced
during the 1980's,'' Jonathan Mann, chief of WHO's AIDS program,
told the 166-nation organization's annual meeting.
   About 151,000 cases of acquired immune deficiency syndrome have
been reported to WHO to date, but the agency estimates the actual
worldwide total at about 375,000.
   AIDS is a disease in which a virus attacks the body's immune
system, leaving victims susceptible to a wide variety of infections
and cancers.
   Mann said up to 1 million new AIDS cases and 5 million
infections with the virus could be prevented in the 1990's by
pressing the global campaign for safe practices by high-risk groups.
   AIDS is most often transmitted through sexual contact. Other
means of transmission include transfusions of tainted blood or
blood products, and the sharing of contaminated hypodermic needles
or syringes by drug abusers. AIDS can also be passed from mother to
child at or before birth.

<TEXT>
   The United States has succeeded in
turning Latin American governments against one of their own _
Panamanian strongman Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   The move has given hope to his opponents, with one opposition
leader saying pressure by the Organization of American States could
help topple Noriega by sparking ``an explosion from within'' the
military.
   The OAS action Wednesday to condemn Noriega was an important
victory for the new Bush administration, which inherited former
President Reagan's yearlong confrontation with the tough Panamanian
despot who the U.S. government accuses of drug trafficking and
political repression.
   It is no longer a fight between the northern giant and Noriega,
but between Noriega and his peers, who now consider him a problem
after he threw out the results of the May 7 presidential elections
widely believed won by the opposition.
   In a quick maneuver Wednesday, the United States squeezed a
resolution out of the OAS condemning Noriega for causing the
current political crisis and practically telling him he must
recognize the opposition's electoral victory.
   Foreign ministers from three Latin American countries are to
visit Panama next week to promote conciliation and a national
accord to bring about ``a transfer of power in the shortest
possible time.''
   In diplomatic terms, they are making the general an offer they
know he cannot accept and forcing him to face the alternative _
diplomatic and political sanctions.
   The sanctions would mean almost total isolation from other Latin
countries and most likely additional economic sanctions by the
United States. They could also mean credit restrictions and other
financial curtailments from European and Asian countries already
upset by the heavy-handed way the government annulled an election.
   Noriega says he has become a target of U.S. wrath because he
opposes alleged U.S. designs to maintain control of the Panama
Canal and to keep its military installations in Panama beyond the
year 2000.
   Internally, Noriega has little to worry about from an opposition
that, although powerful in votes, does not have the resources or
will to rebel against a general who retains the loyalty of the
Panamanian Defense Forces, a well-trained and disciplined
organization of 15,000.
   Opposition vice presidential candidate Ricardo Arias admitted
domestic opposition could not oust Noriega. But he expressed hope
that actions such as the OAS resolution would help ``increase the
pressure and create the atmosphere that would result in an
explosion from within.''
   He was referring to the opposition's hopes for a coup d'etat by
disaffected members of the military.
   The United States has done its share to create the
``atmosphere'' by sending 1,900 soldiers to beef up Panama Canal
security and protect ``U.S. lives, interests and property.'' It
also evacuated U.S. dependents from Panama, thus removing millions
of dollars from the local economy.
   The Roman Catholic Church, which also opposes Noriega and
criticized the annullment of the elections, expressed hopes the OAS
action would help solve the problem.
   ``The expression of the OAS will not solve our problems, but it
may lead to the circumstances in which it is easier to solve
them,'' said Panama Archibishop Marcos McGrath.
   But the general still has at least two options.
   He can call for the formation of a constituent assembly to
govern Panama after Sept. 1, when the current government's term
ends, or he can negotiate with the opposition and perhaps try to
divide it.
   Some Noreiga supporters already are asking for talks with the
opposition.
   Some Latin American sources admitted privately they were not
happy with the OAS resolution, which they said could be considered
``interventionist.'' One of the organization's principles prohibits
meddling in members' affairs.
   But for now, the U.S. can stop being the big bully and let its
OAS partners carry on the fight against the Panamanian strongman.

   AIDS is being seen more and more often among drug
abusers, the national Centers for Disease Control reported.
   Homosexual and bisexual men still account for most AIDS cases in
the United States. The CDC reported Thursday that they made up 63
percent of the AIDS cases reported last year. That was down from 70
percent in 1987 and 72 percent in 1985, the CDC said, in an
analysis of AIDS in the United States.
   Meanwhile, the proportion of adult or adolescent men with
intravenous drug abuse as their lone AIDS risk factor jumped from
14 percent in 1987 to 20 percent in 1988.
   The percentage of cases listing both homosexual activity and
drug abuse was 8 percent in 1987, 7 percent in 1988.
   In the agency's latest monthly AIDS statistics, 56,783 of the
nation's 94,280 reported AIDS cases were homosexual or bisexual
men; 18,819 were drug abusers, and 6,620 were both.
   Although 91 percent of the adult AIDS cases reported since 1982
have been males, drug use is a strong factor among the number of
female AIDS cases as well.
   The percentage of drug use among female adult and adolescent
AIDS patients decreased from 60 percent in 1984 to 49 percent in
1987 but rose again to 53 percent last year.
   By the end of 1988, 3,589 heterosexually acquired AIDS cases had
been reported to the CDC. The majority _ 65 percent, or 2,340 _
were in people who reported sex with high-risk partners.
   The agency also noted that blacks and Hispanics still ``have
suffered a disproportionately large share of the burden of AIDS in
the United States.'' U.S. blacks have an AIDS rate of 84 cases per
100,000 people, and Hispanics have a rate of 73 cases per 100,000,
compared to 26 for whites and 14 percent for Asians and Pacific
Islanders.
   ``The racial distribution of cases has remained stable over
time, with few exceptions,'' the CDC said.
   The U.S. Public Health Service has predicted that the United
States will report 365,000 AIDS cases by the end of 1992, with
263,000 patients dead by then. In 1992, a projected 172,000 AIDS
patients are expected to need medical care at a cost of $5 billion
to $13 billion.
   In the CDC's latest monthly statistics, through April, 54,402,
or 58 percent, of 94,280 reported patients have already died. The
actual AIDS fatality rate ``approaches 100 percent within five
years of diagnosis,'' the CDC said, noting some patients' deaths
never are reported to authorities.

<HEAD>Interview: Soviet Leader Earns $22,800 a Year, Loves Walks in Woods</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK J. PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mikhail S. Gorbachev earns the equivalent of
$22,800 a year, loves to walk in the woods and was raised in a
peasant family where he began working at age 13, the official news
agency Tass said.
   The Soviet president did not make any startling revelations
about himself during an interview in a Communist Party publication
that Tass quoted Thursday, but he did provide some details to
Soviets wanting personal information about their leader.
   That kind of information has been kept strictly secret by
previous leaders, but Gorbachev, 58, gradually has been breaking
down the barrier with his policy of glasnost.
   ``Virtually all my time except for several hours needed for
sleep are given to work,'' Gorbachev told the News of the Communist
Party Central Committee, a monthly journal. Gorbachev has led the
Soviet Union for four years.
   ``I try to use my rare rest hours to their fullest,'' he added.
``My interests are varied: reading literature, the theater, music,
film. My favorite form of rest is walking in the forest. But I have
to admit: I manage to do it less and less.''
   Gorbachev said his schedule is a strain not only on himself but
on his family, and he said he valued the support of his wife,
Raisa, as well as that of his daughter, Irina, and her husband,
Anatoly, who are doctors.
   Gorbachev has two granddaughters, Ksenia and Anastasia.
   Like any other member of the ruling Communist Party Politburo,
Gorbachev said he receives a salary of 1,200 rubles (about $1,900)
a month. Candidate members of the Politburo receive 100 rubles
($160) less, he said.
   His salary is about five times the monthly wage of the average
Soviet industrial worker.
   Gorbachev said all the money he has received for his book
``Perestroika and New Thinking,'' 2 million copies of which have
been published in almost 100 countries, went to the party budget or
to several favorite charities. Among them he named the funds to
help victims of earthquakes in Armenia and Tadzhikistan, the Soviet
Culture Fund of which Mrs. Gorbachev is a board member, and for
construction of a new children's park in Moscow.
   Speaking about the technology that keeps him in touch with the
Kremlin when he is traveling, Gorbachev said he first learned about
the Dec. 7 Armenian earthquake that killed 25,000 people in a
telephone call he received from Moscow while on a ferry boat in New
York harbor. He was in New York for a U.S.-Soviet summit meeting.
   Gorbachev has an apartment in Moscow, believed to be in the
Lenin Hills area, and a country house provided by the Soviet
government. ``Not I, not any member of my family has ever owned a
country house anywhere,'' Gorbachev said.
   Gorbachev emphasized his rural roots and said he was proud of
his father Sergei's service in World War II. His father was wounded
in Czechoslovakia during the war, he said.
   Gorbachev said he started doing farm work at age 13 and was
working as a helper on a combine when he was 15.
   The News of the Communist Party Central Committee has become the
party's favorite means of releasing controversial material.
   Several months ago it published the text of former Moscow party
chief Boris N. Yeltsin's 1987 speech warning that a cult of
personality could develop around Gorbachev.
   Less than a month after the speech in October 1987, Yeltsin was
fired as Moscow party chief. But his speech was not published until
early this year.
   In another issue, the journal published for the first time in
the Soviet Union Nikita S. Khrushchev's 1956 ``secret speech''
denouncing dictator Josef Stalin.
   Its circulation is limited. About 650,000 copies are printed for
a country of almost 287 million people.

   What do Vice President Quayle, ``Cousin Brucie''
Morrow, and Malcolm Forbes have in common?
   Paternity, if nothing else.
   The three shared the luncheon dais Thursday with seven others
named Fathers of the Year by the National Father's Day Committee.
   Morrow, host of CBS radio's syndicated ``Cruisin' America with
Cousin Brucie,'' asked the vice president if he could call him
``Cousin Dan,'' ribbed him about getting stuck in traffic caused by
his motorcade and asked if he could deduct the extra $4 cab fare as
a business deduction on next year's income tax.
   ``No,'' Quayle replied.
   Quayle quoted his 14-year-old son, Tucker, as saying, ``Dad,
Father of the Year? That can't be. ... The year's not over yet.''
   The vice president said he solves all the problems around his
house _ ``by letting the kids hear those three little words: ask
your mother.''
   Quayle and his wife, Marilyn, have three children.
   Millionaire-publisher Forbes was asked if his financial status
allowed him to give his five children anything they wanted when
they were growing up.
   ``Not really,'' said Forbes, a motorcycle and hot-air balloon
enthusiast, ``because by the time I was through buying my toys,
there was no money left over for theirs.''
   The other winners were NBC sports commentator Len Berman; Sen.
Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M., New York Mets pitcher Ron Darling; CBS
newscaster Bob Schieffer, New York Knicks coach Rick Pitino, Fox
Television media critic Stewart Klein, and New York City newscaster
Ernie Anastos.

   While state representatives were debating
deer vasectomies and tossing around a plastic urinal, their august
Senate colleagues staged a speed voting contest.
   ``Remember the Mickey Mouse Club had `anything can happen day?'
This is one of them,'' Rep. James Kosteva said Thursday, during the
House's seven-hour budget debate.
   The flying red urinal, normally used by bedridden men,
interrupted Rep. Carl Gnodtke's speech on the tourism potential of
strategically placed portable toilets with ``Say Yes! to Michigan''
stickers on them.
   Rep. Margaret O'Connor proposed an amendment to ensure tax
dollars would not be used for vasectomies to control the deer
population of Detroit's Belle Isle. The amendment lost.
   Meanwhile, Senate leaders challenged the chamber to see how fast
it could approve a series of minor bills.
   The first passed in 40 seconds, not fast enough for Majority
Leader John Engler, a Republican.
   ``We can do better than that,'' he said. ``Everybody's in their
seat. Let's try again.''
   The second bill was launched in 11 seconds, the third in four.
To cheers and applause, the senators mustered the votes for the
final bill in just two seconds.

<HEAD>No PCBs Found By Canada in U.S. Tankers, Testing Scaled Down</HEAD>
<DATELINE>REGINA, Saskatchewan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After a week of testing failed to
uncover any PCBs in U.S. fuels being trucked into this southcentral
Canadian province, environmental officials have scaled down border
checks for the toxic chemical.
   Environment Canada department officials said Thursday they are
reducing the number of roadside inspections at high-traffic border
towns immediately.
   ``The analyses that we've got for Saskatchewan show no PCBs''
said Don Waite, acting manager of environmental protection for the
Saskatchewan branch of the department.
   Bryan Armstrong of Environment Canada's office in Edmonton said
tests on eight Alberta samples and three Manitoba samples also
showed no presence of PCBs. There was no immediate word on whether
testing there will be cut back.
   In Saskatchewan, four staffers were sent last week to North
Portal, a border crossing 140 miles southeast of this provincial
capital. The action followed reports that millions of gallons of
hazardous chemicals had been mixed with fuel in the United States
and shipped illegally to Canada since 1987.
   The investigators stopped all fuel trucks entering the province
and took roadside samples for testing.
   Since May 11, the department has tested 42 samples of gasoline,
diesel fuel and heating oil for the presence of PCBs _
polychlorinated biphenyls _ but so far no traces have been detected.
   PCBs, primarily used as an insulator in electrical equipment,
have been linked with cancer and were banned in Canada in 1977 as
well as in the United States. By illegally mixing PCB-laden wastes
into fuels, expensive disposal fees can be avoided.
   The department said it will continue to perform random spot
checks at North Portal and will consider further tests at gas
stations around the province.
   Armstrong said the problem of illegal shipments appears to be
restricted to central Canada.
   But last week, Andrew Porterfield, a researcher for the
Washington, D.C.-based Center for Investigative Reporting, told a
Vancouver radio station that fuel laced with hazardous wastes has
been brought up through Idaho and illegally dumped in British
Columbia and Alberta.

<TEXT>
   A man convicted in the murder of a
small-town police chief was executed in Georgia's electric chair
despite frantic appeals by lawyers who claimed he was denied a fair
trial because of racism.
   Henry Willis III, 36, was strapped into the electric chair at
the Georgia Diagnostic and Classification Center shortly after 11
p.m Thursday. He was pronounced dead 20 minutes later.
   He was sentenced to death for his part in the Feb. 11, 1976,
slaying of Ray City Police Chief Ed Giddens. The 29-year-old chief
was abducted and shot the day before he was to leave the force to
manage orange groves in Florida.
   The chief's son, Bill Giddens, said he felt relieved after the
execution.
   ``It's a burden that's removed. It's something I've waited on
for years. It's something I never thought would come true,''
Giddens said.
   Willis was the 14th person executed in Georgia and the 109th in
the nation since the U.S. Supreme Court allowed the death penalty
to be reinstated in 1976.
   In their appeals, Willis' attorneys claimed he did not receive a
fair trial because blacks were excluded from the jury that
convicted him.
   The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals delayed the execution for
four hours, but the appeals court and the U.S. Supreme Court agreed
with a lower court judge who said Willis' lawyers had failed to
prove their claims.
   Millard Farmer, Willis' attorney, met with the condemned man
shortly after the Supreme Court ruling. He said Willis appeared
resigned to his fate and deeply regretted the slaying.
   Willis was led into the death chamber by six guards and sat
rigidly in the heavy wooden chair while they strapped him in. He
glanced briefly at Farmer but showed no emotion before a mask was
placed over his face.
   Willis was one of three men convicted in Giddens' death. The
death sentence of another defendant has been stayed by a federal
court. The third defendant was sentenced to life in prison.
   Giddens was abducted after he stopped a car matching one used in
a robbbery. He was taken to a swamp, where he begged for mercy. He
was shot once while running away and again in the face before being
thrown into the swamp, according to testimony.

<HEAD>Soviet Currency Nearly Worthless as Goods Disappear</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The ruble is fast becoming a second-rate currency
in the Soviet Union, with more people insisting on foreign money
for their services or bartering for products in short supply.
   Salaries have been rising but state stores remain so poorly
supplied that a scrap of 1950's-style linoleum is sold by lottery
only. With plenty of rubles around but the nation's hard-pressed
industry producing little, the ruble has less and less purchasing
power.
   The Soviet Union has long been a place where foreign currency is
highly valued, and barter is a common practice. A pack of foreign
cigarettes works better than Soviet cash to convince a taxi driver
to accept a customer, and a bottle of vodka has legendary
persuasive powers.
   But a 60-percent crash since last autumn in the black market
value of the ruble is testimony that the ruble's worth is declining
faster than ever.
   The street rate casually offered to tourists has fallen from 25
cents eight months ago to 10 cents a ruble now _ compared to the
official rate of $1.56. The exchange rate among Soviets themselves
is as little as 6 cents for a ruble.
   The Soviet space agency Glavkosmos recently infuriated Soviet
journalists by selling a seat on a forthcoming space mission to a
Japanese reporter for the hard-currency equivalent of $11.3 million.
   ``Alas, we get our pay in ordinary Soviet rubles, and can't pay
for the flight in convertible currency which Glavkosmos needs so
badly,'' a columnist in Pravda complained.
   Many of the new cooperative private businesses permitted in the
Soviet Union are obtaining permission to collect ``valuta,'' as
hard currency is called in Russian.
   Even the hijackers who recently threatened to blow up a busload
of schoolchildren in Ordzhonikidze if they weren't given a plane to
Israel demanded their ransom in foreign cash.
   In Moscow, foreign companies like Christian Dior are setting up
joint ventures that serve customers only for hard currency. This
has left citizens fuming, especially when plans were announced for
a new pharmacy that would sell life-saving drugs right in their
midst, but only for valuta.
   It is still technically illegal for most Soviets even to possess
foreign money. But clerks even in government hard-currency stores
are increasingly ignoring the origin of customers' hard currency.
   For many Soviets, hard-currency and barter transactions are the
only way to get things they want and need.
   ``We work, but what do we get for it?'' complained one
Muscovite. ``If I want to use my money to buy a TV set, there
aren't any. I have to wait six months.''
   Only 23 of 211 basic food items are readily available in
markets, without using personal connections, ration cards or paying
a bribe, according to a survey reported by economist Vasili
Selyunin in the newspaper Socialisticheskaya Industria.
   That was in April, before sugar rationing started in Moscow and
before salt and matches joined laundry detergent and ordinary soap
on the list of hard-to-find items. Coffee has long disappeared from
the shelves of official stories in Leningrad even that staple of
Russian winters, tea, is missing.
   In the Krasnoyarsk region, 1,850 miles east of Moscow, farmers
have been resorting to old-fashioned barter: meat for boots.
   In Moscow, audio cassettes and videotapes that cost a few
dollars in the West are virtual alternative currencies, worth
multiples of their dollar price.
   Elsewhere on the black market, a leather jacket brings more then
2,000 rubles on the black-market-infested streets around
Leningrad's tourist-clogged palaces, or more than 8 months' pay for
the average Soviet.
   Demand for dollars is also skyrocketing, according to a
Leningrad black-marketeer, because thousands of Soviets are taking
advantage of newly relaxed border controls to travel abroad.
   Some Soviets are seeking inflation hedges in a nation that has
almost none. Newspapers report shoppers lining up in front of
jewelry stores to buy gold that is grossly overpriced by world
standards. Simple gold chains cost $749.
   The few Soviets lucky enough to own their homes _ on land leased
from the state _ are sitting on gold mines. One Lithuanian family
figures the unusally fine 6-room stone house they bought 10 years
ago is now worth more than three times their purchase price.
   There have been calls in the upstart Baltic republics for the
right to create their own currency _ partly as a sign of
independence from Moscow but also because they believe their more
efficient economies will be able to support an internationally
convertible currency.

<TEXT>
   A state lawmaker says he is relieved two men
have been arrested in connection with 13 bombs planted around town
last summer but he may never rest easy again.
   The largest bomb _ 52 sticks of dynamite _ was found under a
stairwell behind state Rep. Frank Newkirk Jr.'s law office.
Although no bombs were found at his home, Newkirk said he always
feared for his wife and their four children.
   ``Every night I still walk around the house with a flashlight to
make sure there's nothing out there,'' he said Thursday. ``That's
probably a habit I'll never end.''
   John M. Hubbard III, a 31-year-old factory worker, and Gerald
Conrad, a 42-year-old co-worker, were arrested Wednesday, accused
of planting explosives targeted at Newkirk, 32, who also is the
mayor's son.
   They were indicted Thursday on federal charges of possession of
stolen dynamite, conspiracy, making bombs and attempting to destroy
roads and buildings in this southern Indiana community of 6,000.
   Hubbard and Conrad are being held in Indianapolis.
   The bombs were planted around Salem, under bridges and behind
buildings. Three of the bombs fizzled; none of the 13 exploded.
   Authorities have declined to speculate on a motive, but a
criminal complaint filed in federal court described Hubbard as a
``lifelong rival'' of Newkirk's.
   Newkirk and Hubbard were in the same Cub Scout pack and competed
for leading roles in high school plays.
   ``If there was a rivalry, it was in John's mind,'' Newkirk said.
``I understand maybe he wanted to achieve some of the things I
had.''
   Newkirk, a Democrat, said the two men disagreed on politics and
sometimes debated issues when they happened to pass on the
sidewalk. ``John believed government was too involved in people's
lives,'' Newkirk said.
   The relationship between Newkirk and Hubbard dates back to their
Scout pack, which was led by Newkirk's father.
   ``My father really liked John,'' the younger Newkirk said.
``John was overweight and I was overweight, too. My father realized
how cruel children can be about things like that, and I think my
father kind of went out of his way to look after John.''
   Newkirk said Hubbard once complained about losing out to Newkirk
in leading roles in high school plays.
   Newkirk, a former deputy prosecutor who was first elected to the
Legislature in 1984, said he became suspicious of Hubbard about two
weeks after the bombs were found.
   He and his wife, Denise, were working in a booth at a county
fair when they ran into Hubbard.
   ``After a while, he began to talk about the bombings,'' Newkirk
said. ``He had a lot of information. He told me where the bombs
were located, what the dynamite would do if it were exposed to fire
and what would have happened if the bombs had gone off.''
   Newkirk took that information to state police.
   Hubbard's mother, Opal Kramer, said Thursday she was not
surprised her son was able to talk specifically about the bombs.
   ``Everybody in town was talking about the bombings,'' said Mrs.
Kramer, who has taught kindergarten in Salem for 23 years. ``The
pictures were very vivid on TV and in the papers.''
   She described her son as a vocal, opinionated, intelligent man
who liked guns but would not harm anyone ``unless he's under the
influence, and I don't know that he would (harm anyone) then.''
   She said Hubbard had been hospitalized for about a month for
alcohol abuse treatment earlier this year.

   Members of a cult linked to 15 deaths on the
U.S. border were formally indicted Thursday on additional charges
of cover-up, according to news reports.
   The Exceslior news service identified those indicted on the
additional charges Thursday as Sara Aldrete Villarreal, who police
have described as the cult's ``godmother''; Omar Francisco Orea
Ochoa; Alvaro de Leon Valdez; Maria del Rocio Cuevas Guerra and
Maria de Lourdes Bueno Lopez.
   They were indicted during a hearing by Francisco Nieto Gonzalez
of Mexico City's 6th Penal Court, Excelsior said.
   Aldrete, 24; Orea, 23, a journalism student at the National
University; and De Leon Valdez, 22, a former ranch laborer, were
indicted Monday by the 58th Penal Court on murder and other related
charges in the shooting death of their cult leader and his
right-hand man.
   De Leon Valdez has publicly confessed to shooting to death cult
leader Adolfo de Jesus Constanzo, 26, and Martin Quintana
Rodriguez, when police closed in on their Mexico City apartment on
May 6.
   Orea also was indicted Monday, along with two others, on murder
charges in the July 17, 1988 slaying of Ramon Baez, a male
transvestite in Mexico City.
   Officials on both sides of the border had sought Aldrete and
Constanzo for questioning in the April discoverty of the first of
15 bodies buried outside the border city of Matamoros.
   Aldrete has testified that some were ritual sacrifices and
others related to drugs.
   Cuevas, 43, and Guera, 29, were charged with helping hide the
cult members from authorites once they arrived in Mexico City after
the first of the bodies were found near the border and have not
been connected with any of the killings..

      MEXICO CITY (AP) _ The government, which historically has stayed
out of other countries' internal affairs, on Thursday defended its
decision to join other Latin American nations in condemning de
facto Panamanian ruler Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   In a statement issued late Thursday, the Mexican foreign
ministry said that the decision ``plainly responds to the
traditional principles that rule Mexico's foreign affairs,
consecretated in our Magna Carta.''
   During a special Wednesday night meeting in Washington, foreign
ministers of the Organization of American States said power should
be transferred through democratic means in Panama.
   They left the details to a mediation team consisting of the
foriegn ministers of Guatemala, Ecuador and Trinidad and Tobago,
who are scheduled to travel to Panama on Monday and submit their
findings by June 6.
   The meeting followed the Panamanian government's annulment of
the May 7 election and post-election violence toward opposition
party candidates.
   Over objections by Panama and Nicaragua, language was added
blaming Noreiga by name for ``grave events and abuses.''
   The Mexican government's statement said that despite the
``profund intitial differences'' between Latin American nations
that marked the OAS meeting, the final resolution ``opened spaces
for negotiation.''
   Although the Panamanian government charges the resolution is the
first step toward foreign intervention, the Mexican government said
it and other countries oppose such intervention.
   ``The Panamanian situation can only be solved by its people,''
the foreign ministry statement said.

   The government has asked the secretary of
national defense to beef up patrol's along the country's southern
border with Guatemala in the wake of border violence reports, the
Excelsior news service said Thursday.
   Still, Excelsior quoted an official statement from the foreign
ministry that denied a report that an armed group from Mexico
attacked the Guatemalan border town of Tecun Uman on April 22.
   It also denied reports that leftist Guatemalan guerrillas are
setting up camps in Mexico along the countries' common border.
   ``The government of the republic, faithful to its traditional
foreign policy position, reiterates that it has not permited, is
permitting or will permit the use of national territory by people
or groups to prepare military activities against the foreign
government,'' Excelsior quoted the statement as saying.
   As a result, the statement said, the government ```has asked the
secretary of national defense to redouble its vigilance on the
border with Guatemala.''

   A small presidential helicopter

Leon on Thursday, causing slight injuries to several journalists
covering President Carlos Salinas de Gortari's visit to the area.
   Although the presidential press office reported no one aboard
the ``Buffalo'' helicopter was injured, local authorities said
several journalists were slightly hurt.
   Jesus Martinez Garcia, a police official in the town of Doctor
Arrollo, just north of here, said the aircraft was taking off for

above ground when heavy winds slammed it back down on the airstrip.
   Martinez said there were some 30 journalists and presidential

<HEAD>Judge Clears Way For Logging, But Blasts Agency's Plans</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A federal judge has lifted the ban on
logging large tracts of virgin forest but chastised the agency that
administers them for failing to plan for the protection of a rare
owl.
   In a major defeat for environmentalists, U.S. District Judge
Helen Frye ruled Thursday against challenges to the Bureau of Land
Management's timber sales plans for the forests of western Oregon.
   Pending any further appeals by the environmentalists, the BLM
said, the ruling clears the way for sale of 337 million board feet
of timber that has been tied up in legal challenges since last
summer.
   Frye said the agency's decision not to update the timber plans
``was arbitrary and capricious in light of the new, significant,
and probably accurate information that the planned logging of
spotted owl habitat raises uncertainty about the ability of the
spotted owl to survive as a species.''
   Nevertheless, her hands were tied by an amendment to a budget
resolution in Congress that prohibits challenges to the agency's
plans, Frye said.
   The amendment was pushed through Congress by Sen. Mark Hatfield,
R-Ore.
   ``At this point, it appears that Sen. Hatfield's legal
shenanigans that placed the BLM above the law have worked,'' said
Andy Kerr, conservation director for the Oregon Natural Resources
Council, a co-plaintiff in the case.
   Frye's ruling lifted an injunction that had prohibited the
logging of old-growth forests within 2.1 miles of spotted owl nests.
   The injunction grew out of a lawsuit brought by the resources
council, the Portland Audubon Society and other environmental
groups.
   Kerr said the groups would appeal the ruling, while pushing for
the listing of the spotted owl under the Engangered Species Act by
the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, which estimates there are 2,000
to 3,000 pairs of the species left in the Northwest.
   Ed Ciliberti, spokesman for the BLM, said his agency would be
unable to proceed with the timber sales until Fry signs a summary
judgment, and said the threatened species recommendation could
force the BLM to reconsider its plans.
   ``I think frankly we're pleased that she's ruled the way she
has,'' he said, ``but I think a substantial statement will have to
wait until our lawyers review the opinion.''
   A timber industry representative said it was too soon for his
side to celebrate.
   ``We need to figure out what the ruling means before we can
start dancing,'' said Jim Geisinger, president of the Northwest
Forestry
   The continuing budget resolution passed by Congress ``prohibits
a judicial challenge to existing timber management plans, but
allows a judicial challenge to particular BLM activities on a
case-by-case, site-specific basis,'' Frye wrote in her 73-page
opinion.
   She noted that the Audubon Society's challenge ``does not seek
judicial review of an activity of the BLM based on site-specific
new information, such as the discovery of a bald eagle nest or an
archaeological `find' or a blow down of timber on a particular sale
location.''
   ``They can't challenge our management plans, they have to
challenge individual sales,'' Ciliberti said.
   Frye had dismissed the lawsuit in April 1988. But last June the
9th Circuit Court of Appeals issued an injunction and as a result,
the BLM had to cut its planned timber offerings for the year by one
third.
   The appeals court returned the case to Frye, who issued a
preliminary injunction Feb. 9 that reaffirmed the logging ban.

<HEAD>Soviet Republics Pass Laws to Gain More Control Over Economies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Legislators in Lithuania and Estonia have passed
laws in defiance of the Kremlin in which the two Baltic republics
will gain more control over their natural resources and
non-military economies.
   The laws approved Thursday in those restive republics take
effect in 1990. Similar measures similar are being considered in
Latvia, the third Baltic republic.
   Lithuania's law includes provisions for printing its own money,
and Estonia's allows limited ownership of private property.
   In Lithuania, the Supreme Soviet also declared the tiny republic
``sovereign,'' an official in Lithuania's Foreign Ministry said.
   The laws fly in the face of recommendations from a Moscow
commission on how much freedom the Soviet Union's 15 republics
should have.
   The commission's proposed law would leave control over energy
and at least half of heavy industry, as well as all defense
production, in the hands of Moscow bureaucrats. It also would
prohibit republics from printing their own money.
   Geidrius Cekuolis, first secretary of the Lithuanian Foreign
Ministry, said in a telephone interview from the capital, Vilnius,
that the republic's law was passed without amendments after several
hours of debate. He did not know the final vote.
   He said the law granting Lithuania general sovereignty passed by
a large margin.
   The law specifies that national Soviet laws are valid in
Lithuania only if they are approved by the Lithuanian parliament,
effectively claiming the republic can veto Kremlin decisions.
   The Estonian Supreme Soviet passed a similar law in November.
Moscow authorities pronounced the law invalid, but the Estonian
parliament stood by its decision and considers the sovereignty law
in force.
   The new Estonian law contradicts the Soviet Constitution on
several points, including its provision allowing limited private
ownership of property. Estonia's prime minister, Indrek Toome, said
in a recent television interview that Estonian authorities will
have to ask Moscow to invalidate some articles of the constitution.
   The Estonian law declares that ``within limits set by the law,
small-scale private property is allowed.'' In a similar vein, the
Lithuanian law provides for ``the economically necessary
introduction of plots of land for perpetual use with the right of
inheritance.''
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has proposed leasing for up to 50
years or more, but the Communist Party leadership has explicitly
rejected private ownership, which is antithetical to communist
ideology.
   The laws specify that foreigners may own property in Estonia and
Lithuania, and they encourage foreign investment and trade.
   In its law, Estonia claims full control over its land, water,
air space, forests and other natural resources. All industry,
except defense-related factories, are to be put under control of
local authorities, according to the law.
   The Lithuanian provision says the republic ``can introduce its
own money system'' with independent banks, and that it can ``if
necessary print its own state obligations, stocks and other
valuable papers.''

<HEAD>Fighting Reported Continuing in Northern Ethiopia</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scattered fighting was reported
today between loyal and mutinous troops in northern Ethiopia in a
rebellion the country's Marxist leader said had been crushed.
   President Mengistu Haile Mariam told the nation on radio and
television late Thursday that the situation in the northernmost
province of Eritrea was ``under full control.''
   But diplomatic sources in the capital said loyal and dissident
units of Ethiopia's 2nd Army clashed today in and around the
provincial capital of Asmara, three days after the mutiny began.
   ``It is not under control,'' said one Western diplomat.
``Obviously, the whole situation is very fluid.''
   The revolt is the most serious challenge to Mengistu's 15-year
rule in Ethiopia, which is the Soviet Union's closest ally in
Africa.
   The diplomat, who like his colleagues spoke only on condition
that he not be identified, said at least six rebellious generals
were killed in the factional fighting, including the 2nd Army's
commander.
   ``I think Mengistu may be getting it in hand,'' he said, ``but I
don't think he's quite as firmly back in the saddle as his
statement last night would indicate.''
   The 150,000-strong 2nd Army, nearly half the country's entire
armed forces, had been considered in full opposition to Mengistu.
Thursday's fighting between rival factions within the unit
represented what the diplomat called ``a dramatic turn.''
   ``It's pretty obvious now that while the insurgents held Asmara,
they did not fully control units outside the (provincial)
capital,'' the diplomat said.
   He said the counterrevolt was led by the 102 Paratroop Brigade,
the 3rd Mechanized Brigade and the 2nd Tank Brigade, all units
based in other Eritrean cities.
   An African diplomat in Addis Ababa said other army units based
outside the capital had been outwardly neutral in the revolt but
now appeared to be swinging toward the government.
   In his first public comment since returning Wednesday from an
abbreviated trip to East Germany, Mengistu blamed the uprising on
``a few generals'' who placed their ``greed and hunger for power''
above the national interest.
   He said Thursday that his ``revolutionary forces will
liquidate'' the mutineers.
   A few hours before the report of fighting within the 2nd Army,
the Eritrean People's Liberation Front (EPLF) declared it was
temporarily suspending its 28-year war of secession to support the
rebellious soldiers.
   The Western diplomat said the factional fighting appeared to
have been caused by ``a backlash against the rapprochement with the
EPLF.''
   The rebels control three-fourths of the countryside in Eritrea,
and the army generally is confined to garrisons in the cities,
including Asmara.
   Mengistu inherited the northern civil war when he and a clique
of army officers deposed Emperor Haile Selassie on Sept. 12, 1974.
   Eritrea is a former Italian colony that was federated with
Ethiopia in 1957 under a U.S.-sponsored U.N. resolution. Haile
Selassie annexed the territory in 1962.

   Rep. Claude D. Pepper was reported as ``pretty

   Pepper, 88, was first hospitalized April 6 for an undisclosed

<TEXT>
   Part of a train carrying spent nuclear fuel
derailed in east London but the incident did not pose any danger to
the public, officials said today.
   The flask of nuclear fuel was not damaged in the Thursday night
incident in Stratford, said Colin Bennett of the Central
Electricity Generating Board, the company responsible for power
stations in England and Wales and owner of the fuel.
   He said the locomotive and the first open carriage, which was
empty, went off the track, but that the carriage carrying the flask
and the last empty carriage were undamaged.
   The fuel was en route from Bradwell nuclear power station in
south England to the Sellafield nuclear power station in north
England for reprocessing, he said.
   A spokesman for British Rail said it appeared vandalism ``was a
contributing factor but the matter is subject to investigation.''
   The driver and the guard on the train were not injured, said the
spokesman, who refused to be named.

   With no end to the walkout that has hobbled
education in the nation's second-largest school system this week,
substitute teacher Chris Farmer keeps smiling at striking teachers,
but ``They don't smile back.''
   And the juniors and seniors who showed up Thursday at his John
Marshall High School classroom were a pretty listless bunch.
   One girl thumbed through ``Bridal Guide'' magazine. A youth read
``Coma,'' a paperback thriller. Three students sat with headphones
in their ears. Several students answered questions from a stack of
``Trivial Pursuit'' game cards.
   ``It's pretty painful, really,'' Farmer said. ``They're a good
group of kids. They just want something to do.''
   The scene was typical of the 600 schools in the Los Angeles
Unified School District, where 2,237 substitutes who crossed the
picket lines for a special daily wage of $167 are coping with the
workload of 22,000 striking teachers.
   Student attendance has declined steadily since the strike began
Monday. Of the 551,759 students enrolled this quarter, 283,620 were
counted Thursday, down from 329,371 on Monday.
   The first formal contract talks in months between the striking
teachers union and the school district took place Thursday. Both
sides agreed not to comment to reporters.
   Farmer, tall and gangly with wire-rimmed glasses, is an
erstwhile substitute teacher who doubles as a contract worker at
the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena. With no current contract
at the lab, he has worked every day since the strike by the United
Teachers-Los Angeles union began.
   Farmer was one of 22 substitute teachers supplementing 17
Marshall faculty members who worked Thursday despite the strike.
The staff normally includes 139 teachers.
   Marshall is an ornate stone building that has been used as a
backdrop for countless movies, commercials and television shows,
including ``Wildcats,'' ``Grease'' and ``Room 222.''
   In 1987, a team from the school won the National Academic
Decathlon, a point of pride for Principal Donald Hahn.
   ``One of the things the substitutes like about Marshall is that
it's a good school,'' said Bill Pitkin, a biology teacher who began
picketing at 5:30 a.m. Thursday.
   His pride in the school was mixed with bitterness about
substitutes whom he views as strikebreakers.
   ``There's one substitute in there who's an exceptional teacher.
... He's taught some of my biology classes. But we won't ever call
for him as a substitute again,'' Pitkin said.
   Teachers, who currently earn salaries of $23,440 to $43,319, are
seeking a 26 percent pay increase over three years. The district is
offering them a 21.5 percent increase over three years.
   A little more than half of Marshall's enrollment of 2,780
students was counted in attendance Thursday. Farmer at first
counted 26 students in his class, although another dozen or so
trickled in over the next two hours and one bored student walked
out.
   There are no science teachers and few math teachers, the
principal said, and many classes are lumped together.
Administrators have scheduled three two-hour classes a day instead
of the usual six one-hour periods.
   The beginning of the strike was chaos, Hahn said, but ``the
longer it goes, the better it's going to be for us because we're
getting more and more teachers each day.''
   Still, the shortage of teachers has all but brought education to
a halt.
   Students enrolled in math analysis, trigonometry and algebra
find themselves in one room listening to a lesson that many find
incomprehensible and others see as too elementary.
   ``It's kindergarten work.'' said senior Alexandra Cervantes, 18.
The substitute teachers, she said, ``are just sitting there,
looking pretty and getting paid a hundred-and-sixty-whatever
dollars a day.''
   Specialized programs also are suffering, said Wanda Fuhrmann, a
striking special education teacher.
   ``The blind students are coming to school, and some are doing
OK, and some are bouncing off the walls,'' she said.
   Farmer tried to keep the students in his class busy by asking
them to write a haiku, a three-line poem of 17 syllables.
   One student responded:
   Turmoil in the air
   One against the other one
   Resolution, come.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar held steady in calm European
trading this morning following a day of erratic trading marked by
central bank intervention.
   Gold prices fell.
   Dealers said the dollar remained well-supported from a
fundamental point of view, with large institutional investors
attracted by relatively high U.S. interest rates that show no signs
of being lowered.
   This dollar-buying would be balanced by profit-taking, they
said, but most agreed that the dollar would be unlikely to drop
sharply in future.
   Some predicted the central banks would intervene if the dollar
hit the 1.9700 German mark level.
   On Thursday, the U.S. unit was boosted by news that the West
German Bundesbank's central bank council had decided to leave its
key interest rates unchanged and by a rise in U.S. consumer prices.
   But a wave of concerted intervention started the dollar on its
downward move to its late levels.
   In London today, the dollar rose against the British pound. It
cost $1.6179 to buy one pound, cheaper than $1.6180 late Thursday.
   Other mid-morning dollar rates in Europe, compared with late
Thursday:
   _1.9692 West German marks, up from 1.9660
   _1.7560 Swiss francs, up from 1.7552
   _6.6665 French francs, up from 6.6490
   _2.2166 Dutch guilders, down from 2.2240
   _1,434.25 Italian lire, down from 1,439.50
   _1.1885 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1927
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell 0.11 yen to close at 138.77 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted at 138.80 yen.
   Gold opened in London at $367.85 a troy ounce, down from $370.75
late Thursday. At mid-morning, London bullion dealers fixed a
recommended price of $366.25.
   In Zurich, gold fell to $366.15, compared with $370.25 late
Thursday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $4.51 to close at $367.22.
   Silver fell on the London market where the metal was trading at
$5.36 a troy ounce, compared with Thursday's $5.43.

<HEAD>Marine Drowns When U.S. Landing Craft Capsizes Off Australia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SYDNEY, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An amphibious landing craft from the
USS Duluth capsized today during naval exercises off northeastern
Australia, drowning a U.S. Marine and injuring two others, the U.S.
Embassy said.
   Fifty-two people, including an Australian, were thrown into the
water when the small craft overturned off Shoalwater Bay, 745 miles
north of Sydney, according to an embassy statement. Australian
defense sources said nine inflatable Zodiac boats carrying five
people each were involved.
   Embassy spokesman Arthur Lefkowitz said Marines from the USS
Duluth, an amphibious transport dock ship, were being put ashore
when the accident occurred.
   ``They were making a landing and apparently the surf was heavier
than they anticipated or the winds were wrong,'' Lefkowitz said.
``Several of the boats overturned in the surf, dumping all the
Marines aboard into the water.''
   The embassy said the military exercises were suspended
temporarily after the accident. The exercises, codenamed ``Valiant
Usher,'' started Monday and involve seven U.S. and Australian ships
and 5,000 Marines and sailors.
   The embassy said helicopters from the Duluth and the USS Bellau
Wood buzzed the accident site, but rough seas and overcast weather
hampered the rescue effort.
   The identity of the dead Marine was witheld pending notification
of relatives, but Lefkowitz said the Marines were based at Camp
Pendleton, in Southern California.
   Australian defense sources said the Marine drowned when the
inflatable craft overturned in rough conditions.
   ``The Americans are dealing with the injured themselves. They
have not told us very much about (it),'' said an official, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Lefkowitz said the Marines were wearing life jackets at the
time. He described the injuries as minor and said the injured
Marines were being treated on board the Duluth. The other U.S.
ships taking part in the exercise are the Belleau Wood, Germantown
and Frederick.
   The Australian vessels were the guided missile destroyer HMAS
Brisbane, the destroyer escort HMAS Torrens and the patol boat HMAS
Townsville.

   Teachers entered their fifth day of a walkout
today demanding a chunk of the state's newly announced tax surplus
in their negotiations with the nation's second-largest school
district.
   Neither the district nor the teachers would discuss with
reporters what progress had been made in talks held Thursday night.
   ``There are going to be some meetings on our side in the morning
and some meetings on their side in the morning and we'll be back
tomorrow,'' United Teachers-Los Angeles President Wayne Johnson
said after the talks at a downtown hotel broke up around midnight.
   More than 22,000 teachers are on strike, with about 11,000
remaining teachers and substitutes crossing picket lines at the
city's 600 schools.
   Only 283,620 of the Los Angeles Unified School District's
551,759 students attended classes Thursday, school officials said.
   A state fact-finder's report this week concluded that no
additional money was available for teachers' salaries beyond the
district's offer of a 21.5 percent raise over three years.
   But confusion over the salary issue arose after Gov. George
Deukmejian announced Wednesday that the state expects to receive an
extra $2.5 billion windfall in unanticipated tax revenues over the
next two years.
   According to the terms of the state's Proposition 98, virtually
all revenue above an expenditure limit is to be given to schools.
   The Los Angeles district reportedly could receive $120 million
to $228 million of that money. But Board of Education President
Roberta Weintraub said the district could not improve its wage
offer because it had no assurances it would get the additional
funds.
   Johnson, encouraged by the windfall report, immediately raised
the union's wage demand from 21 percent over two years to 26
percent over three years, including a 10 percent retroactive boost
for the first year. The teachers have been working without a
contract since September.
   ``It is not acceptable,'' Weintraub said. ``We will not even
consider a 10 (percent first-year raise).''
   ``If they stand firm, the union's strike is going to continue,''
Johnson said. He dismissed the fact-finder report, saying its
author did not know about the extra state money.
   Ms. Weintraub said the district might offer a 24 percent raise
over three years, with 8 percent for each year, ``If we get the
money'' from the windfall.
   The strike is the district's first since a 23-day walkout in
1970.
   Teachers annual salaries range from $23,440 to $43,319, with the
high end of the scale for those with doctorates, 98 extra course
units and 19 years' experience.

   President Corazon Aquino said today
she will not allow Ferdinand Marcos to come home to die and her
government will not permit the ousted president to be buried on
Philippine soil.
   Marcos' wife Imelda appealed today to Mrs. Aquino to ``open her
heart'' and allow the former president to return. Marcos' lawyer
also asked the Philippine Supreme Court to order the return,
pledging the ousted leader would cooperate with the Aquino
administration.
   Marcos was reported in critical condition today in a Honolulu
hospital after undergoing emergency kidney surgery. Hospital
officials said the 71-year-old former Philippine leader was
suffering from renal, cardiac and pulmonary failure.
   In Honolulu, Marcos aide Arturo Aruiza said Imelda had left the
hospital to make a final appeal to Mrs. Aquino to allow her husband
to die in his homeland.
   Mrs. Aquino's daughter, Maria Elena Cruz, said the president had
received no calls from Mrs. Marcos. Mrs. Cruz serves as her
mother's secretary.
   In a statement broadcast today by the pro-Marcos radio station
DZEC, Imelda said she was trying to contact the presidential office
``to make a last appeal to Madam Corazon Aquino to open her heart
and let Ferdinand come home because he is in very serious condition.
   ``This is for reconciliation, this is what's best for the
country,'' Imelda said. ``I'd like to ask our people to pray that
Marcos may continue to live.''
   Mrs. Aquino told reporters earlier that she was sorry to hear
that Marcos' condition had deteriorated ``and I pray that he will
be able to recover.''
   ``I regret to inform Mrs. Marcos, if indeed she is asking me for
reconsideration, because as I have said in the past, much as I
agree that Mr. Marcos has his rights, I still have to consider also
the rights and interests of millions of Filipinos,'' Mrs. Aquino
said.
   ``I have already said in the past that we will not allow his
remains to be brought back here, and we have already taken plans to
avoid any untoward incidents,'' she added.
   Mrs. Aquino succeeded Marcos after the 1986 uprising that
toppled his administration and forced him into exile in Hawaii.
   Today, the Manila Stock Exchange's composite index fell to
1,084.53 from Thursday's close of 1,102.97. Traders said rumors of
Marcos' death triggered a selling wave shortly before noon.
   In Honolulu, Marcos aide Arturo Aruiza said Mrs. Marcos planned
to make one last appeal to Mrs. Aquino to allow her husband to
return home.
   Rafael Ileto, Mrs. Aquino's national security advisor, said
granting such a request was still an option but, ``I doubt very
much that it will be one of the solutions.''
   Ileto, who met with Mrs. Aquino for a half-hour today, said
Marcos no longer posed a threat to the nation but his followers
``can cause disruptions of normal functions.''
   Ileto, a retired vice chief of staff and former Defense
Minister, said the 160,000-member armed forces was capable of
quelling any unrest by Marcos supporters.

   Students at a Taiwanese university pledged
their support today for Chinese students whose hunger strike for
democracy in Beijing has won widespread backing in mainland China.
   ``You are our brothers,'' said a statement signed by all 12,000
students at the National Chengkung University. ``Although you do
not know us personally, please remember that we are with you all
the time.''
   The students at Chengkung, an engineering university, said they
regretted thousands of Chinese students have had ``to treat
themselves in such a harsh way to gain a brighter future'' for
China.
   Student leaders from Chengkung and 19 other Taiwanese
universities were scheduled to meet later today to discuss ways to
support the Chinese students, who began their hunger strike in
Beijing's Tiananmen Square on May 13.
   The hunger strike is the largest show of defiance in 40 years of
Communist rule on the China mainland. The Chinese government today
issued an order effective at midnight forbidding demonstrations.
   On Wednesday, the ruling Nationalist Party said it would provide
support ``through various channels'' to the pro-democracy student
demonstrators. It did not elaborate.
   A major Taiwanese newspaper, The United Daily News, said in a
dispatch from Beijing that the Chinese students have declined any
medical or other assistance from Taiwan to avoid a crackdown on
their movement by Chinese authorities.
   The Nationalists, who fled to Taiwan in 1949 when they lost a
civil war on the mainland, are still technically at war with the
Chinese Communists.
   They continue to reject any official contacts with the
Communists, although they have adopted a more flexible policy the
past two years that allows Taiwanese and Chinese to exchange visits
and trade through third countries.

<HEAD>Government Mulling Over Lifting State of Emergency</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government is considering
lifting the nearly three-year-old national state of emergency when
it expires next month because anti-government protest has subsided,
Information Minister Stoffel van der Merwe said.
   ``The government is considering thoroughly all aspects of the
security system in the country in order to decide whether the
emergency should be reimposed or not,'' he said Thursday on state
television's evening newscast.
   ``The fact that things are fairly normal, there are not so many
people dying in these days, is not necessarily a full conclusion
that we don't need security arrangements.''
   Although van der Merwe made no promises, it appeared significant
that the issue of lifting the emergency was the first item
mentioned on the evening news.
   Van der Merwe has said in the past that when the government
wants to make a significant policy change, it prepares the public
for it by opening discussion on the issue.
   President P.W. Botha declared the national emergency on June 12,
1986, saying regular laws were insufficient to deal with widespread
violence in black townships, protest rallies and unrest against the
government's apartheid laws.
   Under apartheid, the black majority of 28 million has no say in
national affairs, and the 5 million whites control the economy and
have separate housing districts and schools.
   Botha's decrees under the emergency allow police nearly
unrestricted power to detain people indefinitely without charge,
close newspapers, ban meetings, rallies and church services, and
outlaw organizations.
   Individuals also may be prohibited from speaking in public, and
criticism against the government, police and the army can be banned.
   Monitoring groups say at least 30,000 people were detained
without charge under the emergency. Hundreds were freed following a
hunger strike among detainees earlier this year, and an estimated
50 people still are being held.
   Van der Mewe said the government could soften some criticism by
lifting the state of emergency, which has been condemned by
governments and human rights organizations around the world.
   But, he said, ``You cannot afford to let society lapse into
disorder again in order just to avoid criticism.''

<UNK>Fossils 220 Million Years Old, Researcher Says</UNK>
<DATELINE>ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 30 fossilized dinosaur teeth
found near Tucumcari are estimated to be 220 million years old,
meaning the creature was one of the first of its kind to inhabit
the earth.
   ``This is of worldwide importance because it is so rare,'' said
Adrian Hunt, a doctoral candidate at the University of New Mexico.
   Hunt, who made the discoveries during four years of explorations
for the New Mexico Museum of Natural History, said Thursday the
shape of the animal's teeth indicate it was one of the first
dinosaurs on earth.
   He named the animal Revueltosaurus callenderi, after the New
Mexico museum's director, Jon Callender. The first part of the name
referred to a Spanish word for revolution, `revuelta.'
   The discoveries are discussed in a book published this week
titled ``Dawn of the Age of Dinosaurs in the American Southwest,''
edited by Hunt and museum paleontologist Spencer Lucas.
   Lucas said it was the first new genus of dinosaur discovered in
New Mexico since 1923 and the first new dinosaur species found in
the state in nearly 30 years. ``We're breaking a lot of new ground
after a long dry spell,'' he said.
   Found with the teeth were fossils of many early ancestors to
mammals, turtles, crocodiles, flying reptiles and birds, several of
which have yet to be identified, Hunt said.
   Tucumcari is in eastern New Mexico about 30 miles from the Texas
border.
   ``The area is an incredible graveyard of ancient animals,''
Lucas said.
   The authors' conclusions have yet to be reviewed by scientific
peers.
   Their theory is that Revueltosaurus was the ancestor of all the
plant-eating dinosaurs, including stegosaurus. It resembles a
10-foot-long lizard with 3-foot hind legs that permitted it to walk
nearly upright. It had much smaller forelegs.
   The oldest previous North America fossil, also dating back some
220 million years, was unearthed several years ago in west Texas.
   Dinosaur fossils from the same period have been found in Africa
and the Mediterranean.

<TEXT>
   Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega made his
first public appearance since the nullified May 7 elections before
a cheering crowd, but he had nothing to say about his country's
crisis or his future plans.
   Noriega was greeted with roars and chants by the more than 1,200
military, government and party workers who gathered Thursday night,
but he gave no speech and made few comments to reporters.
   ``I'm fine,'' Panama's de facto ruler said repeatedly when asked
how he had held up in the tension-filled weeks since May 7.
   When asked how much longer he could go on, he laughed and said,
``That's a good question.''
   The elections were nullified by a government tribunal even as
international observers said opposition candidate Guillermo Endara
was leading Noriega's handpicked candidate 3-1.
   Noriega, commander of the Panamanian Defense Forces, has been
accused of ordering the beatings of opposition candidates May 10.
   At the rally, Noriega supporters watched a series of traditional
music and dance mixed with anti-American skits, poetry and a
recitation of U.S. interventions in Panama.
   ``With Noriega to the Year 2000,'' signs declared. Members of
the crowd said they were members of the government party or
government workers, or both.
   ``We came voluntarily, we weren't forced,'' said one woman, who
refused to give her name but said she worked in a hospital laundry
in Colon, 50 miles north of Panama City. She said she was bused in
after work.
   She and her friends joined in a chant of ``Noriega, for sure,
hit the Yankees hard!'' which rhymes in Spanish.
   Noriega was pursued by a pack of journalists as he left the
convention center but did little more than smile in reply to
repeated requests for a message to Bush or to the Organization of
American States.
   Bush and the OAS have condemned election fraud and repression,
and the OAS is sending a committee of foreign ministers to report
on the situation in Panama.
   News media run by the Noriega regime denounced Wednesday night's
OAS resolution condemning Noriega.
   In an interview with WBAI Radio early Thursday in New York,
Noriega declared that the United States was persecuting Panama
``because we are black.''
   In other interview comments, Noriega repeated his frequent
assertions that the U.S. Embassy in Panama is misinforming the
White House and that the United States was engaged in aggression.
   Noriega was indicted on drug smuggling and money laundering
charges in Florida in February 1988. Washington and the local
opposition since then have mounted a concerted campaign against him
to no avail.
   Noriega denies the drug accusations. He and his supporters
contend the United States has slandered him as part of a scheme to
renege on its commitments under the 1977 Panama Canal Treaties.
   The pacts oblige Washington to hand over complete control of the
waterway to Panama on Dec. 31, 1999.

   The maker of a ``Spinning Bee'' toy is warning

   Artsana of America asked parents to remove the rubber feet from
the top to prevent children from ingesting them. Removing the feet
does not affect the action of the toy, the company said.
   About 100,000 of the toys have been sold nationwide. They look
like a top with a clear cover and a bee inside. The toys have the
name ``Chicco'' and ``Made in USA'' on the bottom.
   The company is offering a $3 gift certificate, good on the
purchase of another of the company's toys, to parents who mail in
the rubber feet from the Spinning Bee. They should be sent to
Artsana of America-Chicco, 200 Fifth Ave., Room 910, New York, N.Y.

   The legal ordeal is over for a father who
disconnected his comatose son from a respirator and held him until
he died, but the act of desperation reveals a gap in laws dealing
with euthanasia, experts said.
   A grand jury refused Thursday to indict Rudy Linares on a
first-degree murder charge for the April 26 death of his
15-month-old son, Samuel.
   Linares, 23, pulled a .357-caliber Magnum handgun on hospital
staff and kept them at bay while taking his son off a respirator
and cradling the boy in his arms until the severely brain-damaged
toddler died.
   He said he did it ``because I loved my son.'' The child had been
in a coma since August, when he accidentally swallowed a balloon,
cutting off oxygen to his brain.
   Linares pleaded guilty Thursday to a misdemeanor charge of
unlawful use of a weapon and was sentenced by Circuit Judge Robert
Bastone to one year conditional discharge, meaning he will serve no
time in jail.
   Bastone told him to get a psychological evaluation and consider
counseling.
   ``As far as punishment is concerned, I think you have suffered
enough,'' the judge said at a brief hearing.
   ``I'm glad it's more or less behind me now,'' Linares said. ``I
want to thank everybody that sent me cards, letters, their prayers,
moral support.''
   Linares, a house painter from Cicero, had been charged with
murder, but after the grand jury action, the state's attorney's
office said it would not prosecute the charge.
   Authorities say Linares also had unhooked his son's life-support
system during a December visit, but that staff members immediately
re-attached the boy's ventilator and did not notify police.
   Groups that back legislation to support parents and other
relatives in such cases applauded the grand jury's decision.
   ``Everybody is really relieved for Mr. Linares,'' said Fenella
Rouse, legal director for the New York-based Society for the Right
to Die. ``It's the right decision. I'm very glad he'll be able to
get back to some relative privacy.''
   Ms. Rouse said laws and court precedents at the federal and
state levels protect parents and doctors in disconnecting life
support when children are in irreversible comas.
   ``This wasn't a gray area,'' she said.
   Prosecutors, the hospital and Linares' lawyers disagreed.
   Public defender Kevin Smith said Congress and state legislatures
must draft laws to govern such cases.
   ``The criminal courts are not where this should be dealt with,''
he said. ``There should be an orderly way that a family dealing
with a tragedy can end the suffering of a child or another loved
one without being driven to an act of despair like Rudy Linares was
driven.''
   State's Attorney Cecil Partee repeated his pledge to form a
panel of medical, legal and religious representatives to analyze
the issues raised by the case and seek appropriate laws.
   Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center had refused the
family's requests to withdraw life support and welcomed prosecution
for child abuse or murder because the youngster wasn't brain-dead.
   ``Serious questions remain for doctors and nurses as to how best
to protect the rights of both our patients and their family
members,'' the hospital said after the hearing.
   State Rep. Thomas McCracken Jr., who has been involved in
euthanasia issues in the Illinois General Assembly, said no laws to
clarify legal options posed by the Linares case are on the horizon,
and drafting them would be very difficult.
   ``Something needs to be hammered out,'' said McCracken, an
attorney. ``The courts are a bad place to make public policy.''
   Northestern University Law School professor Daniel Polsby
predicted prosecutors would seek charges again if faced with a
similar case.
   ``The one thing that the state's attorney cannot allow to happen
is an open invitation for people to start euthanizing their
relatives,'' Polsby said.

<HEAD>Gun Ban Bill Sent to California Governor</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   State officials and lawmakers said
they hoped California's decision to restrict military-style assault
rifles would lead other states and Congress to follow suit.
   The state Legislature, spurred by the January slayings of five
children in a Stockton schoolyard, sent the governor a bill
Thursday that would make California the first state to virtually
ban sales of rifles such as the one used in that attack.
   Republican Gov. George Deukmejian has agreed to sign the measure
into law.
   ``We are sending ripple effects across the country,'' Attorney
General John Van de Kamp said. ``What is needed in my view is a
national ban ... California on so many issues is on the cutting
edge.''
   ``We have struck a major blow for public safety,'' said Senate
President Pro Tem David Roberti.
   The Legislature approved the bill by votes of 27-11 in the
Senate and 41-35 in the Assembly.
   ``This represents the culmination of a rather lengthy and
grueling process of how we can do something to change the culture
of violence,'' Assemblyman Mike Roos said.
   National Rifle Association spokesman Richard Gardiner threatened
to file a lawsuit against the measure after it takes effect next
year.
   The movement to ban the guns gained public support on Jan. 17,
when deranged drifter Patrick Purdy used a semiautomatic AK-47
rifle to kill five students and wound 29 children and a teacher on
a Stockton playground.
   The legislation is the second half of a two-part package that
would restrict sale and possession of more than 50 models of
assault weapons, including the AK-47.
   Both bills would virtually ban the sale of the affected weapons
after Jan. 1, 1990, but would allow people who legally obtained the
weapons before June 1 of this year to keep the firearms if they
register them with the state.
   It would take a special permit, like those required for machine
guns, to keep an assault weapon obtained after the cutoff date.
   The bills also would increase penalties for crimes committed
using assault weapons.

   The U.S. Supreme Court refused to
reinstate Florida's abortion consent law, clearing the way for a
15-year-old girl and other minors to get abortions without
permission of parents or a judge.
   The high court's action Thursday shifts the issue back to the
Florida Supreme Court, which has said it would review the
constitutionality of the abortion consent law in September.
   ``She can legally have an abortion right now and until the
Florida Supreme Court rules again, that is the law,'' said Jerri
Blair, attorney for the Lake County teen-ager who is 12 weeks
pregnant and has been identified only as T.W.
   Following the U.S. Supreme Court action, the state promptly
moved Thursday to speed up the state Supreme Court's review of the
abortion consent law or allow its enforcement until that review in
September.
   Under the 1988 law, unmarried women younger than 18 must get
permission from parents or a judge before getting abortions.
   ``If the Florida Supreme Court denies the stay, it looks like
the law will be unenforceable,'' said Assistant Attorney General
Jerry Curington.
   In papers filed with the state justices, Curington argued there
is confusion over whether the U.S. Supreme Court's refusal to
reinstate the law means it cannot be enforced statewide.
   Although it was struck down by only one of Florida's five
district appeals courts, a 1976 precedent apparently means it also
cannot be enforced in the other four districts, he wrote.
   Therefore, he argued, the justices should expedite their review
or else keep the law in effect until they rule on the
constitutional issues.
   Ms. Blair, noting that the state Supreme Court already ruled
Tuesday that abortions could proceed without consent, said, ``It
appears fairly ludicrous to bring this up again.''
   The consent requirement was found unconstitutional earlier this
year by the 5th District Court of Appeal in Daytona Beach.
   A lawyer appointed by the judge in T.W.'s case to represent the
fetus obtained an order Tuesday from U.S. Supreme Court Justice
Anthony M. Kennedy blocking an abortion.
   On Thursday, the full federal court lifted Kennedy's order
without comment or recorded dissent. The high court's decision was
strictly procedural and did not rule on the merits or
constitutionality of the law.
   But Kennedy's order sparked widespread speculation about his
views on abortion.
   He is considered to hold a pivotal vote in a Missouri case
asking the justices to reverse or curtail the court's 1973 decision
in Roe vs. Wade legalizing abortion. A decision in that case is
expected by late June.
   But lawyers on both sides warned Thursday against reading too
much significance into Kennedy's earlier order.
   ``I don't believe his action lends any real insight into his
views on Roe vs. Wade,'' said James Bopp of the National Right to
Life Committee. ``It shows he takes the Supreme Court cases on
parental involvement seriously but beyond that, I don't think you
can say much more.''
   Charlene Carres, an American Civil Liberties Union lawyer in
Tallahassee, said the court's action vindicates the ACLU's
``initial impression that this was not any kind of sign that
Justice Kennedy would necessarily be an anti-choice vote in the
(Missouri) case.''

   Showers and thunderstorms lingered in much of the South and
Midwest today, and rescuers in New Jersey used an Army vehicle
designed for fording rivers in wartime to evacuate residents from
flooded areas.
   Heavier rainfall during the 6 hours ending at 2 a.m. EDT
included more than 5 inches at Fort Myers, Fla., nearly 2 inches at
Biloxi, Miss., and 1} inches at Baton Rouge, La.
   In northern New Jersey, rescuers used rowboats, canoes and even
an old World War II amphibious vehicle Thursday to help evacuate
Passaic County residents from their homes as the Passaic River
remained at flood levels. More than 600 people have been displaced
by flooding, emergency officials said.
   Rain still fell in parts of Louisiana today, where state police
said roads, highways and ferry services were closed in 13 parishes
late Thursday night because of flooding. The closures were along a
250-mile stretch extending from Shreveport in northwest Louisiana
to the capital city of Baton Rouge.
   In south Louisiana, St. Landry Parish sheriff's deputies said
lightning probably started a house fire early Thursday that left
two children dead near Opelousas.
   Twisters in East and West Baton Rouge, St. Landry, Iberville and
Lafayette parishes downed trees and power lines and damaged
buildings Thursday. At least four homes were destroyed in East
Feliciana Parish, said Sheriff Randy Maglone.
   Skies in Oklahoma began clearing today as the violent storms
that claimed at least one life and spawned as many as four
tornadoes in northeast Oklahoma on Thursday moved out of the state.
   Authorities said a teen-ager drowned Wednesday when he was swept
into Duck Pond Creek while trying to cross it during heavy rains
about six miles north of Elmwood in western Oklahoma.
   Tornadoes ravaged much of the northeastern area of the state
Thursday afternoon, damaging as many as 40 homes and injuring one
person.
   On Thursday, torrential rains dumped nearly a foot of water on
the Houston area, overwhelming drainage bayous and turning some
low-lying subdivisions into huge lakes. Residents of about 100
homes fled by boat when Greens Bayou overcame its banks.
   Four tornadoes touched down in Arkansas Thursday night,
destroying several homes and downing power lines. Four tornadoes
also were reported in Kansas Thursday.
   Heavy rain and thunderstorms drenched much of Mississippi, with
several areas in the southern part of the state reporting 3 to 7
inches of rain. In Brookhaven, more than 6 inches fell from 3:30 to
8:30 p.m. Rainfall of up to 8 inches was common south of Fort
Myers, Fla.
   Showers and thunderstorms also hit northwest Tennessee, western
Kentucky, southern and central Missouri, central Iowa, eastern
Minnesota, northern Wisconsin and upper Michigan. Showers were
scattered over eastern Montana.
   Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms extending
from the central and eastern Gulf Coast across much of the
Mississippi and Ohio valleys into the upper Great Lakes; showers
and some thunderstorms across the northern Rockies and the northern
Plains; snow showers in parts of Montana; and rain showers across
northwest Washington state.
   Predicted highs: 40s in parts of Montana; 50s and 60s in the
northern Pacific Coast and the eastern slopes of the northern and
central Rockies; 90s in the desert Southwest and the western third
of Texas; and 70s or 80s across much of the rest of the nation.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 24
degrees at Yellowstone, Wyo., to 85 at Laredo, Texas.

<HEAD>Scientist Rebuts Periodic Volcano Theory</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A government scientist says his detailed new
analysis disproves the theory that volcanoes are more likely to
erupt at certain times of the year.
   Historically, volcanoes have erupted slightly more often in some
months than others, leading to disputes over whether the variation
was enough to constitute a periodic pattern.
   Richard B. Stothers concluded that it isn't in a report in the
May issue of Geophysical Research Letters, published by the
American Geophysical Union.
   Stothers, of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's
Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., compared the dates
of recorded strong volcanic eruptions between 1500 and 1980.
   During that time 265 eruptions were recorded in the first half
of each calendar year and 236 in the last six months, a difference
Stothers said is not statistically significant.
   Breaking down the eruptions by month and area, Stothers did find
some clustering, but this was explainable, he concluded.
   For example, nearly all eruptions south of 50 degrees south
latitude occurred between November and April.
   This is almost certainly because that is summer in that part of
the world, the time of year the nearly uninhabited region is most
often visited by outsiders who would record eruptions, Stothers
said.
   No similar pattern was seen in the far north, where residents
are always present to notice eruptions.
   Stother's monthly analysis found a peak average of 52 eruptions
in February between the years 1500 and 1980 and a minimum of 36
eruptions in the months of April and December during that period.
   The average number of eruptions in other months fell in between
those two, a variation within the range that statisticians would
expect to occur in a random sample.
   Stother's analysis rebuts several studies done in the late 1800s
and early in this century that indicated a seasonality to volcanic
eruptions.
   At least one 1917 report speculated that eruptions would cluster
around the equinoxes in the spring and fall as a result of changes
in the angle of the sun.
   Periodic springtime eruptions of some volcanoes have been
associated with melting snow seeping into the ground and reacting
with molton lava below the ground, scientists have suggested.
   But seasonality occurring at individual volcanoes disappears
when they are averaged in with many others around the world,
according to Stother's analysis.

<HEAD>State Supreme Court Forces Justice off Bench Because of Age</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first black woman to sit on the
Pennsylvania Supreme Court has been stripped of her office and
$91,000 salary by her colleagues because of her age.
   The high court split 4-2 on Thursday, with Chief Justice Robert
N.C. Nix registering what he called ``a most vociferous dissent.''
   Justice Juanita Kidd Stout was forced off the bench retroactive
to her 70th birthday on March 6. She had not participated in any
new cases since then. The state Constitution requires judges to
retire at 70, but Stout's attorney argued she was exempt, because
she was appointed, not elected.
   Justice Nicholas Papadakos, writing for the majority, said
appointed judges should not be exempt.
   ``We do not believe that the equal protection clause (of the
federal Constitution) confers any greater rights upon appointed
judges than upon elected or retained judges,'' Papadakos said in
agreeing with state Attorney General Ernest Preate Jr., who brought
the lawsuit.
   ``There is no question that Justice Stout is widely recognized
as an outstanding judge and justice,'' Preate said. ``The position
that I argued is simply that the Constitution must apply to
everyone, including Supreme Court justices.''
   Gov. Robert P. Casey appointed Stout in February 1988 to fill a
vacancy expected to last only a year. Her term was extended when
the court canceled judicial elections in 1988 on a technicality.
   The court then ordered Casey to extend her appointment to Jan.
2, 1990, but did not address the age question.
   Nix, who shared his office with Stout, said the majority's
opinion would hurt the judicial system.
   ``Many highly qualified former judges who have surpassed the age
of 70, are, by the majority's decision, prevented from filling
vacancies in our court system on an interim basis,'' he said.
   ``If there is a sadness to today's decision, it is that this
court, which traces its existence back to 1681, has only had two
female justices, both of whom assumed office by appointments to
fill a vacancy.''
   Nix held out the hope that Stout could become the first person
appointed as a senior justice _ a retired judge who continues to
work to ease court backlogs _ to the Supreme Court

<HEAD>EDs: Subs 10th graf, Secretary of, to restore dropped matter</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Broke, demoralized and ignored, the
Organization of American States needed a spirit-nourishing issue.
Manuel Antonio Noriega may have provided it.
   The OAS has been unable to accomplish much of anything this
decade. One of the organization's principal aims is to keep the
peace, but it has been on the periphery of the continuing bloodshed
in Central America and was irrelevant at the time of the
British-Argentine war in 1982 over the Falkland Islands and the
U.S.-led invasion of Grenada a year later.
   At one point several years ago, an OAS official said the
organization was so feckless that it was unable to agree on a
resolution commemorating the upcoming 500th anniversary of the
discovery of America.
   But for the OAS, Noriega has been heaven-sent. The organization,
which seemed paralyzed by factionalism, was able to close ranks
against the Panamanian leader Wednesday night.
   With only Panama and Nicaragua dissenting, OAS foreign ministers
agreed to blame Noriega for ``the grave events and abuses'' that
have occurred since the May 7 national elections in Panama.
   International organizations normally are loathe to single out
leaders of member states for criticism but the scenes of opposition
candidates and ordinary citizens being bludgeoned by government
agents turned stomachs from one end of the hemisphere to the other.
It was time for the OAS to drop its genteel guard.
   The foreign ministers approved a resolution which not only held
Noriega personally responsible for the bloodshed, but also
appointed a mediating team to take steps aimed at ensuring a
``transfer of power'' in Panama.
   That is quite a departure for an organization which normally has
as its highest principle the right of member states to be spared
outside intervention.
   Noriega, of course, will put his own spin on the resolution. He
is expected to tell the mediators that he is a soldier for
democracy who wanted nothing more than to see a ``transfer of
power'' resulting from the May 7 elections. On that basis,
Noriega's foreign minister was able to go along with the resolution
Wednesday night.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III has shown interest in
reviving the OAS. He is planning to appoint one of the State
Department's most accomplished Latin American hands, Luigi Einaudi,
as U.S. ambassador to the OAS.
   But Baker didn't take office soon enough to head off the layoffs
earlier this year of 300 OAS employees, about 30 percent of the
total. That step was largely brought on by U.S. arrearages
amounting to more than $50 million. More layoffs are expected next
month.
   The OAS heyday was the 1960s. It was the Cold War era and U.S.
administrations were able to forge an anti-communist consensus with
rightist dictators and hawkish democratic governments which
dominated the hemisphere at the time.
   Cuban President Fidel Castro was everybody's villain. The OAS
expelled him from its ranks a few years after his revolution and,
25 summers ago, the organization slapped a mandatory economic and
diplomatic embargo against Cuba.
   In 1965, the United States invaded the Dominican Republic, a
seeming violation of the OAS charter. But OAS nations, albeit
reluctantly, gave their blessing to the U.S. action rather than
siding with the target of the invasion.
   With the demise of rightist dictatorships in Latin America and
their replacement by elected governments, the anti-communist
consensus in the hemisphere has unraveled.
   Never has Latin America been more democratic or less willing to
go along with Washington's policies. Support for President Reagan's
Central America policies in the hemisphere was virtually invisible.
   The special session on Noriega recalled the time 10 years when
the OAS decided to move against Nicaraguan President Anastasio
Somoza. A month after the OAS foreign ministers called for Somoza's
resignation, he fled to Paraguay.
   Now the question is whether the OAS stand against Noriega will
contribute to a similar result.
   One of the OAS mediators who will sit down with Noriega next
week is Ecuadoran Foreign Minister Diego Cordovez, the principal
architect of the agreement that led to the withdrawal of Soviet
troops from Afghanistan starting a year ago.
   If Cordovez was able to get more than 100,000 Russian troops
out, surely he can do the same with one Panamanian. Or can he?

   Here are brief sketches of China's top leaders.
   Deng Xiaoping, 84, is the most powerful leader in China even
though the highest ranking position he holds is chairman of the
Central Military Commission of the ruling Communist Party.
   Deng was purged twice by radicals during the 1966-76 Cultural
Revolution and then staged a comeback that turned China around.
   He transformed a country dominated by ideological battles into
one with pragmatic, market-oriented economic policies.
   Living standards have improved for millions of Chinese but the
modernization drive has led to serious problems of inflation and
corruption.
   Deng wears a hearing aid and smokes heavily but is not known to
have any serious health problem. There have been persistent rumors
he will retire soon from all his offices.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Zhao Ziyang, 69, general secretary of the Chinese Communist
Party since 1987, has been the nation's leading advocate of rapid
economic reforms.
   As governor of Sichuan province in the late 1970s he led the
country in successful experiments in restoring family farming.
   In 1980 Deng brought him to Beijing and he was quickly named
premier. He held that post until 1987 when he became party chief
following the ouster of fellow reformist Hu Yaobang who was blamed
for student unrest.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Li Peng, 60, premier since April 1988. An electric engineer, he
studied in the Soviet Union in the 1950s and represents the
technocrats now filling many government offices.
   He has opposed Zhao's moves in market-oriented reforms, saying
he supports the plan but prefers a more cautious pace. Last
September, after the inflation rate exceeded 30 percent, Li called
for a two-year economic slowdown.

<TEXT>
   Yang Shangkun, 81, became China's president, or head of state,
in April 1988.
   Yang, a career military man, was active in Red Army campaigns in
the 1930s and 1940s and was appointed permanent vice chairman of
the Central Military Commission in 1982. He backed Deng's 1985
decision to end the wartime footing of the army and reduce the
force of more than 4 million soldiers by 1 million.
   The post of president is largely ceremonial but Yang does have
influence because of his close ties to Deng and his seat on the
17-member party Politburo.

<TEXT>
   An Israeli soldier and three
Palestinians were killed today in the first gun battle between
troops and Arab villagers since the start of the 17-month uprising
against Israel's occupation.
   The soldiers opened fire on the Palestinians, who had allegedly
killed a suspected Israeli collaborator in the past, authorities
said.
   Seven soldiers were wounded, including a high-ranking Israeli
officer in critical condition after he was wounded in the head,
said an army spokeswoman who was not identified under military
regulations. The soldier was killed by a grenade thrown by the
Palestinians, officials said.
   The clash brought to 487 the number of Palestinians killed in
the uprising. It also raised to 22 the number of Israelis who have
died in the violence, including eight soldiers.
   Also today, troops arrested about 100 Palestinian activists in
the Gaza Strip, including Sheih Ahmed Yassin, 52, the spiritual
leader of the Moslem fundamentalist movement Hamas, Arab reports
said. Hamas, Arabic for zeal, is a principal group coordinating the
uprising.
   In the West Bank village of Surif, the army blew up two homes of
Palestinians allegedly involved in attacks on soldiers, the army
said. Western nations have condemned house demolitions because they
are usually carried out before a suspect has been charged or tried.
   The incident occurred in Beit Aula, a village of 1,500 residents
about 15 miles southwest of Jerusalem. Troops blocked access to
Beit Aula, stopping journalists at the nearby village of Halhoul.
   Maj. Gen. Amram Mitzna, the army commander of the West Bank,
denied the gun battle marked a new phase in the uprising.
   ``I don't think this is a turning point,'' he said.
   Mitzna said the Palestinians were affiliated with the Fatah
faction headed by Yasser Arafat, leader of the Palestine Liberation
Organization.
   Mitzna said the incident began when an alleged Palestinian
collaborator from the West Bank village of Nuba near Beit Aula
called the army for help, saying he was being attacked by fellow
villagers.
   Troops responding to the call passed through Beit Aula, and
``unexpectedly met a suspect car,'' Mitzna told reporters.
   ``There was a chase, and they (soldiers) opened fire. The result
was three of the group (Palestinians) were killed, and one of our
soldiers was killed, and another one was wounded very seriously,''
Mitzna said.
   The Israeli soldier driving the lead jeep was killed by a hand
grenade, an army spokesman said. The battalion commander, a
lieutenant colonel, was critically wounded in the grenade blast.
   ``I was in a vehicle behind the lead jeep. I opened fire ... and
shot the terrorist in the front seat,'' a soldier involved in the
firefight, identified only as Capt. Rafi, told Israel radio. ``I
then saw another terrorist in the back seat holding an M-16 rifle
who was also firing. I reloaded and continued firing.''
   Mitzna said the three Palestinian victims were wanted by
authorities. ``They acted mainly against villagers who helped
Israeli authorities, and those who opposed the rule of the
intefadeh (Arabic for uprising),'' he said.
   An army spokesman said the Palestinians had killed one suspected
collaborator.
   An army spokeswoman said the three Palestinians had an
American-made M-16 assault rifle, an Israeli Uzi submachine gun and
a pistol.
   Today's Israeli victim was the fourth soldier shot to death
during the uprising, but he was the first to die in a full-scale
gun battle. The other four soldier's deaths came from stonings and
stabbings.
   Underground leaders of the uprising have urged Palestinians not
to use guns, saying such an escalation would only bring strong
retribution by Israel.
   Beit Aula has a long history of disputes between residents and
alleged collaborators.

   Gov. Roy Romer's state airplane was pressed into
service as an air ambulance to transport an injured peregrine
falcon to a bird clinic.
   The governor's pilot, Lt. Lloyd White, was asked if he could
carry the falcon from Lamar to Denver on Thursday, said Bryant
Will, district manager of the Colorado Division of Wildlife.
   ``No problem,'' White told Will. ``It will be nice to have a
real aviator fly with me.''
   The falcon, which had a cut on its right shoulder, was captured
Wednesday by falconer Dale Eddleman, Will said. The falcon could
have suffered the injury by hitting a fence or telephone wire.
   ``The peregrine hadn't eaten for so long it was too weak and too
hungry to be wary as Eddleman walked up and captured it by hand,''
Will said.
   The bird was taken to the Birds of Prey Rehabilitation
Foundation in Broomfield. The governor's plane was needed when a
flight by a local flying service was canceled.

<TEXT>
   Iran has filed suit against the
United States in the World Court over the loss of 290 lives in the
downing of an Iranian jetliner last year, a court official said
today.
   Tehran has asked the court to rule that ``the United States is
responsible to pay compensation to the Islamic Republic to the
amount to be determined by the court ... for the injuries suffered
by the Islamic Republic and the bereaved families,'' the official
quoted Iran's submission to the court.
   Iran filed its application at the court on Wednesday, said the
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity in line with court
practice.
   It was not clear whether the Bush administration was planning to
take part in the proceedings. The U.S. Embassy in the Hague
declined comment.
   The case involves the downing of an Iranian Airbus jet by the
USS Vincennes on July 3, 1988. All 290 passengers and crew of the
plane died in the incident, which occurred after the Airbus was
erroneously identified as an Iranian fighter plane by the
Vincennes' crew.
   President Reagan said at the time that the families of the
victims would be compensated as an ``expression of grief'' but that
no other reparations would be made. The former administration said
the unspecified compensation would go to families and not the
government of Iran.
   But recently, Bush administration officials said they cannot
compensate the families until their receive more information from
Iran about the victims.
   The World Court, officially known as the International Court of
Justice, is the judicial branch of the United Nations. It has no
enforcement powers and depends on voluntary adherence to its
rulings.
   In documents filed at the court's registry, Iran also asked the
court to quash a March 17 decision by the International Civil
Aviation Organization, which deplored the incident but did not
blame the U.S. government, the court official told The Associated
Press.
   The court is considering when to begin proceedings in the case,
which pits the United States against Iran in the World Court for
the second time since 1979.
   In that year, the Carter Administration filed suit against Iran
over the fate of 55 American diplomats held hostage at the U.S.
Embassy in Tehran. The court ruled in favor of the U.S. government,
ordering Iran to immediately release the hostages.
   The Iranian government ignored the court ruling but later freed
the hostages in January 1980 after an elaborate deal was reached
with Washington.
   The United States withdrew from proceedings in the other major
World Court case in which it was involved earlier in the decade. In
1984, Nicaragua sought a halt to U.S. support for the Contra rebels
and the court sided with the leftist Sandinista government two
years later.
   Only days before that complaint was filed, the Reagan
administration canceled its acceptance of World Court jurisdiction
in Central American affairs.
   Of the more than 150 U.N. member nations, only 49 have accepted
the court's authority as compulsory in settling conflicts between
states. The United States is one of them, with the exception of
Central American disputes.

   Pan Am, whose Flight 103 was bombed
over Lockerbie on Dec. 21, is throwing a party to make up for the
Christmas cheer the town missed because of the disaster, an
organizer said.
   Community spokesman Alex McElroy said Thursday the idea came
from New Jersey schoolboy Ed Blaus, of Sicklerville, who will be
attending the American-style barbecue June 3 with his parents and
three brothers.
   Others expected at the party are Disney characters Mickey and
Minnie Mouse, folk and rock bands, a football coach and a bagpipe
player.
   ``Ed's Party,'' as the event is being called, will be held on
Lockerbie's soccer ground and 6,500 people from the southern
Scottish town and surrounding district are invited, McElroy said.
   The disaster killed all 259 people on the New York-bound jet and
11 people on the ground in Lockerbie. Investigators have determined
a terrorist bomb wsa to blame.
   ``Ed's idea was to provide some form of event to provide for the
lack of a Christmas time in Lockerbie,'' McElroy said. ``The
community of Lockerbie will be happy to met Ed and are looking
forward to the day.''

<HEAD>Korean Dissidents to Appeal to Amesty Over Student's Death</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dissident leaders said today they will
ask Amnesty International to intervene if the government refuses to
perform a new autopsy on a radical student they claim was killed by
police.
   Dissidents charge the government is trying to cover up police
involvement in the death of 24-year-old Lee Chol-kyu, whose body
was found in a reservoir near the southern city of Kwangju on May
10.
   Lee's death has inflamed radicals and heightened tension in
Kwangju, a stronghold of anti-government sentiment where thousands
of dissidents and radical students have staged anti-government
protests for the past eight days. The protests there and around
Korea are to mark the annniversary of a 1980 civil uprising in
Kwangju that left at least 192 people dead.
   Anti-government rallies to mark the uprising were expected to
continue through the weekend, and police units were on top alert.
   ``Oust the Roh Tae-woo regime which tortured Lee to death,''
yelled 400 students at the National Polytechnic University in Seoul
who marched through the streets today. About 400 riot police
followed but did not intervene.
   The United National Democratic Movement, the nation's leading
dissident group, said that if the government does not conduct a
second autopsy it will ask doctors from Amnesty International to do
so.
   The government has said a second autopsy is unnecessary, but
dissidents want an independent investigation to check their charges
of torture and police involvement.
   The government says troopers chased Lee when he was stopped at a
roadblock but deny police were responsible for the death. Officials
say an autopsy performed earlier this week indicates Lee drowned,
and they speculate he slipped and fell into the reservoir while
running away from police.
   ``How could it be drowning as the government claims?'' Lee's
mother, Hwang Jung-ja, said today during an emotional meeting with
the provincial police director in Kwangju, according to Yonhap, the
South Korean news agency.
   Yonhap said Lee's mother, accompanied by 30 women who are
mothers of political prisoners, visited director Paik Hyung-jo at
his office to protest the government's ruling that Lee drowned and
demand a police investigation.
   In Seoul, relatives of victims of the nine-day Kwangju uprising
called today for an end to political exploitation and demanded the
government provide compensation to families of those killed.
   ``We have suffered enough, mentally and physically,'' said Park
Chan-bong, spokesman for the Family Association of Victims of
Kwangju's Pro-Democracy Movement. ``We must not be exploited
anymore for political purposes.''
   Roh was a senior army general when townspeople and students
seized a government armory in Kwangju May 18, 1980 and took control
of the city. Troops were sent in to suppress the uprising nine days
later after talks failed.
   Government reports said 192 people were killed and hundreds
injured in the uprising. Opposition groups claims the government
covered up many more deaths.
   Dissidents and radical students have been calling for the
overthrow of the Roh government, but they lack public support
because of their violent tactics and extremist views.

   The parents of kidnapped Belgian physician
Jan Cools today pleaded with his captors to free their son or
``give us at least a sign'' from him.
   Cools' parents were in Sidon to try to gain their son's release.
He was kidnapped May 21, 1988. The 32-year-old doctor was working
for the Norwegian humanitarian agency, Norwac, when he disappeared
after leaving his base in the Rashidiyeh Palestinian refugee camp.
   ``We appeal to the Lebanese and Palestinian peoples and groups
to release Jan,'' Paul Cools told a news conference. His wife,
Louisa, fought back tears as she addressed the captors: ``We want
to ask you to give us at least a sign of Jan.''
   A previously unknown group calling itself Soldiers of Justice
claimed it kidnapped Cools, and it branded him a spy.
   Also today, Beirut's Ash-Shiraa magazine said the ``file of the
foreign hostages held in Lebanon is now in the hands of Ahmad
Khomeini,'' son of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini of Iran.
   In a brief, unattributed report, the magazine said Ahmad
Khomeini ``has recently summoned several officials of Hezbollah to
discuss this issue.'' It said Khomeini had taken charge of the
hostage issue from Parliament Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani and
Ayatollah Hussein-Ali Montazeri, who was forced to resign last
month because of his criticism of Khomeini's policies.
   The fundamentalist Shiite Moslem Hezbollah, or Party of God, is
believed to be the umbrella for pro-Iranian factions that hold most
of the 15 foreigners held hostage in Lebanon.
   The hostage held longest is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March 16,
1985.
   Two West German relief workers also reportedly were kidnapped in
Sidon on Tuesday, but no group has claimed to hold them.

   A dissident poet and another activist
were arrested today on charges they violated a national security
law by attempting to contact communist North Korea, prosecutors
said.
   Ko Un, the poet, and Lee Jae-oh, a leader of a dissident
alliance, sought private talks in the border town of Panmunjom with
North Koreans on national reunification, the prosecutors said. The
capitalist South bans contacts with the North on reunfication and
other issues.
   Also today, South Korea's Foreign Minister Choi Ho-joong urged
the United States to show restraint in diplomatic contacts with
North Korea. U.S. diplomats met this week in Beijing with North
Korean diplomats for the fourth time since Washington lifted its
ban on talks with the communist government.
   Ko, 56, was accused of attempting to take six literary figures
to the border truce village in March to meet with North Korean
counterparts for talks on reuniting two countries that have been
divided since 1945.
   Lee, chairman of the Committee of the Fatherland of the United
National Democratic Movement, also was accused of trying to hold
separate talks in Panmunjom with North Korea's Communist Party
panel on unification.
   Lee, 45, was charged with conspiring to plan the Rev. Moon
Ik-hwan's recent secret visit to Pyongyang, the communist capital.
Moon, adviser to the United National Democratic Movement, was
arrested April 13 upon return from Pyongyang.
   Foreign Minister Choi said today the United States should
improve relations with North Korea only if its allies, China and
the Soviet Union, take similar measures in relations with the South.
   ``Our government has been notified afterward about contact
between the United States and North Korea,'' Choi said.
   North Korea wants the U.S. to withdraw its troops, stationed in
the South under a mutual defense pact since the 1950-53 Korean War.

<HEAD>Scientists, Victims Argue Use of Holocaust Experiment Data</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KARREN MILLS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Data from experiments on prisoners in Nazi
concentration camps should be available for use in research if
lives could be saved, a hypothermia researcher says.
   Researchers currently have to dig through archives for the
material.
   ``The value of human life is great, and if we have the means to
save life _ even if the data is suspect _ we should use it,'' Dr.
Robert Pozos said Thursday at an international conference on the
meaning of the Holocaust for bioethics.
   The public must be educated about what went on in the camps as
the data were being gathered ``so they can understand and make
their own decisions,'' Pozos said.
   The suggestion that the data be used drew angry reaction from
three Holocaust survivors who participated in a panel reaction to
Pozos' address.
   ``This is an issue fraught with much emotion,'' said Pozos, vice
president for minority affairs at the University of Washington and
former director of the Hypothermia Research Laboratory at the
University of Minnesota-Duluth.
   ``It is very difficult, even for me, to disassociate what
happened to the people at Dachau, Buchenwald and other
concentration camps with the data that was gathered,'' he said.
   Pozos said his research could benefit from experiments done by
the Nazis. So far he has refrained from using the data and did not
make clear whether he would use it.
   He said 80 to 90 prisoners died in cold-water immersion
experiments conducted at Dachau, where non-consenting prisoners
were placed in brutally cold water to see what would happen to
Luftwaffe pilots if they were shot down.
   Information from the experiments still useful to today's
scientists includes data showing that rapid rewarming with warm
water is effective only for severely hypothermic patients and that
body-to-body rewarming is ineffective.
   Data showing the head and neck are especially vulnerable to cold
have been used in designing hypothermia suits, Pozos said, and
other experiments provided the basis for using lowered body
temperature during cardiac surgery.
   ``The situation is one which I think good might come from
evil,'' Pozos said.
   ``The experiments, the tortures we're talking about are the very
tortures that killed my sister, the tortures that were done to
me,'' said Susan Seiler Vigorito, a teacher of Judaic studies from
Cleveland, Ohio, and a survivor of the experiments conducted on
twins by Dr. Josef Mengele at Auschwitz.
   ``The real issue is the method. The method is as much a part of
the data as the data itself. The data doesn't tell us anything
about the evil of the Holocaust,'' she argued.

   Soul singer James Brown was back in his
South Carolina prison cell today after spending a day in New York
testifying before a grand jury, a prison spokesman said.
   Brown was taken to Albany, N.Y., from the State Park
Correctional Center on Wednesday and was returned to South Carolina

Francis X. Archibald said.
   Authorities would not say whom the grand jury was investigating.
But the New York Post reported today that it was probing a possible
tax evasion case against the Rev. Al Sharpton, a black activist.
   Brown, known as the ``godfather of soul,'' is serving a six-year
sentence for aggravated assault and failing to stop for police
during a car chase across the Georgia-South Caroina border in
September.
   Sharpton has long been an associate of Brown's and has lobbied
to have the singer released.

<HEAD>Taiwanese Politician Burns Himself to Death at Dissident's Funeral</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A member of Taiwan's main opposition party
burned himself to death today in front of thousands of people
attending a memorial service for a dissident publisher who
committed suicide to avoid arrest.
   Several of the nearly 10,000 people attending the service
outside the president's office said Chan Yih-hua lit bottles of
gasoline strapped to his waist under a black mourning vest and was
engulfed in flames.
   Police fired water cannons as mourners extinguished the flames
with jackets and umbrellas. Chan was taken to a hospital where he
was pronouced dead.
   There were no clashes between the police and mourners.
   More than 3,000 mourners remained outside the building tonight
for a sit-in in rain as thousands of riot police watched behind
shields.
   The mourners, including college students and church members,
urged President Lee Teng-hui to allow freedom of speech for those
advocating an independent Taiwan and for the release all political
prisoners.
   The memorial service, which began Friday, marked the largest
demonstration on this island since Taiwan lifted 38 years of
martial law in 1987.
   An unidentified man standing beside Chan was also burned and was
hospitalized in serious condition, officials said.
   Chan, in his thirties, was a member of the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party, which was formed three years ago.
   Party officials said Chan was an admirer of Cheng Nan-jung, 42,
publisher of the Freedom Era weekly, who was accused of publishing
seditious articles in his magazine. Cheng died in a fire April 7
after battling police with firebombs from an apartment to avoid
arrest.
   Cheng's relatives and police said the publisher committed
suicide, and his friends said he had vowed to burn himself to death
to avoid arrest.
   Cheng's coffin was taken on a two-hour funeral procession
through Taipei streets by 2,000 supporters before the memorial
service outside the Presidential Office Building. The crowd later
swelled to nearly 10,000 people.
   Riot police erected barbed-wire barricades outside the
Presidential Office Building to prevent the mourners from getting
too close to the building.
   Police said the procession was illegal because demonstrations
are not permitted in the vicinity of th Presidential Office
Building.
   After Chan's self-immolation, a Protestant priest, Kao
Chun-ming, led the crowd in singing hymns and a Taiwanese folk song
``We Are All (Native) Taiwanese.'' The crowd also shouted slogans
of ``Taiwan Needs Independence.''
   The mourners included Chen Wan-chen, a dissident Taiwan
journalist who has lived in exile in the United States for 10 years
and who has been banned from returning because she has advocated an
independent Taiwan. Dissidents said she slipped back into the
country last week from the Phillipines.
   Opposition legislator Hsu Jong-shu said both Cheng and Chan had
died for press freedom and political liberalization, and she
promised to campaign to achieve their objectives.
   The Nationalists, who fled to Taiwan in 1949 after losing a
civil war in China, continue to maintain they are the legitimate
government of all China and that Taiwan is a Chinese province.
   Taiwan and China are opposed to an independent Taiwan, and China
indicated it would use force to prevent the establishment of an
independent Taiwan.

<HEAD>TV Reports Congressman Arrested For Child Molestation 35 Years Ago</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Rep. Donald Lukens, facing trial
Monday on charges he had sex with a teen-ager, was arrested for
investigation of child molestation 35 years ago in Michigan but was
never charged, an aide said.
   Lukens denied the accusations in both cases.
   ``It wasn't true 35 years ago, and it's not true now,'' Bill
Jarrell, Lukens' press secretary in Washington, said Thursday.
   Lukens, an Ohio Republican, faces trial in Franklin County
Juvenile Court in Columbus on a misdemeanor charge stemming from an
alleged sexual relationship with a Columbus teen-ager.
   A Michigan televison station on Wednesday revealed the child
molestation investigation of 1954.
   Lukens could not be reached for comment today. A message was
left at his home. Reached Thursday night by The Columbus Dispatch,
he declined to comment, other than to say: ``It was no case.''
   Detroit television station WJBK reported that Lukens was
arrested by police at a boarding house in Royal Oak, Mich., on May
9, 1954, on suspicion of sexually molesting a young girl. Lukens
was a salesman at the time.
   The case was dropped when the child's parents refused to press
charges, the station quoted unidentified police sources as saying.
The age and identity of the girl were not known.
   Donald Brown, a former Oakland County, Mich., prosecutor who
handled the case, told WJBK the child's parents did not want their
daughter to testify at a trial.
   ``The young girl and her parents adamantly refused to sign a
complaint and follow through with the testimony,'' Brown said.
   Lt. Don Novak of the Royal Oak, Mich., police department
confirmed that a person was arrested at a suburban Detroit boarding
house on May 9, 1954, for investigation of child molestation. He
refused to identify the person arrested, citing advice of the city
attorney.
   Lukens, 57 and divorced, was indicted by a Franklin County grand
jury Feb. 23 on a misdemeanor charge of contributing to the
unruliness and delinquency of a child. The charge alleges that
Lukens had sex with a 16-year-old girl in November.
   Lukens has denied the charge and said he was set up by the girl.
He said she was seeking money.

<HEAD>All Yellowstone Fires Will Be Fought, Park Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Every fire that starts in
Yellowstone National Park this year will be fought, a park
spokeswoman said today.
   The announcment extends a moratorium of the ``let it burn''
policy that had been due to expire by midsummer. The moratorium is
now in effect through the summer and fall fire season, said
Yellowstone spokeswoman Joan Anzelmo.
   The ``let it burn'' policy, adopted in 1972, allowed all
naturally caused fires that did not threaten life or property to
burn without intervention. Fires caused by humans were fought.
   The policy came under widespread criticism last year after both
man-caused and lightning-strike fires burned sections of nearly
half of the 2.2 million-acre national park. The fires were
exacerbated by drought and high wind.
   Anzelmo said heavy snow this winter and wet spring conditions do
not compare to last year's low snowpack and dry spring. ``We should
be moving into the early summer with a lot of moisture on the
ground,'' she said.
   Although lightning fires started as early as June last year,
Anzelmo said this summer will be too wet for early fires. She said
park officials expected a normal fire season this year.
   ``In a normal season, it usually is the late summer or early
fall before conditions are dry enough for lighting strike fires,''
she said.
   But when they do start, they will be fought, she added.

<TEXT>
   President Bush summoned his top
defense advisers to his seaside home today to discuss NATO's
nuclear arsenal as his spokesman indicated arms issues dividing the
alliance remain ``subject to discussion.''
   Bush met with Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, Joint Chiefs of
Staff Chief Adm. William Crowe and other military advisers in
advance of a weekend meeting with French President Francois
Mitterrand, said presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   ``The SNF (short-range nuclear forces) issue of course is one
that's under cosndiration right now and is driving the meeting,''
Fitzwater told reporters.
   The Bush administration wants to upgrade NATO's nuclear weapons
while West Germany has called for early U.S.-Soviet talks on
reducing the nuclear arsenal in Europe _ talks the United States
has rejected. The flap threatens to disrupt the NATO summit in
Brussels later this month.
   Fitzwater said he did not know if a compromise could be struck
before the NATO meeting.
   At the same time, Fitzwater denied that comments by Mitterrand
the day before in Paris urging a go-slow approach on modernizing
NATO's nuclear forces were in conflict with the U.S. stance.
   ``President Mitterrand's comments yesterday indicate that his
position is very similar to ours. (He) shares our general concern
about the strength of the NATO alliance,'' Fitzwater said.
   ``I'm sure all of that is subject to disscussion,'' he said.
   Fitzwater dismissed news accounts suggesting Mitterrand's party
was unhappy with accomodations in Kennebunkport.
   ``As far as I know, the accomodations are satisfactory to the
French delegation. The discussions of accommodations have gone
quite well. We don't have any problems,'' he said.
   The New York Daily News, in today's editions, quoted
unidentified souces as saying Mitterrand was unhappy with the size
of the bed and the height of the toilet in the house in
Kennebunkport where he and his wife will be staying. The house,
owned by Bush's mother, is next to the president's home. The
article also said that Barbara Bush was upset about the
Mitterrand's visit, claiming it to be disruptive.
   Bush on Thursday told a Rochester audience, ``We're having the
president of the French Republic come to our hourse. So first she
(Mrs. Bush) bawled me out about that ... because the house has been
closed all winter.''
   Fitzwater said today that the Bushes had decided to restrict
press coverage of the Mitterrand visit within the oceanside
compound.
   ``The family feels their home is their private residence and
should not be used for publicity purposes. They want to keep it
pesonal, and I think that's reasonable,'' he said.
   Bush arrived here Thursday, and immediately took his powerboat
for a spin. His motor got hung up on lobster pot lines and he had
to hang overboard to untangle.
   At one point, the president was almost upside down, with Secret
Service agents holding onto his thighs as he worked to unsnarl his
propeller.
   ``Had to lift up the prop to free the line,'' Bush later told
reporters.
   Bush was out for several hours at the wheel of his 28-foot
Cigarette speedboat, crashing through the waves of the open
Atlantic. It was the first time Bush has been out on the boat as
president, and he was accompanied by several Coast Guard vessels
that stood guard.
   Bush and Mitterrand are to meet on Saturday for a session that
aides said would focus on the NATO summit in Brussels later this
month.
   Bush has invited Mitterrand to visit with him for the weekend,
and was to take the French leader with him to Boston on Sunday,
where Bush was to give the commencement address at Boston
University.
   High on the agenda of a planned Saturday work session between
the two presidents will likely be the issue of short-range missiles
in western Europe.
   The French leader has voiced general support for Bush's
opposition to a West German call for early negotiations with the
Soviets for eliminating tactical nuclear weapons in Europe.
   However, while reiterating that it was still too early for such
talks to begin, Mitterrand said in Paris on Thursday that the NATO
allies should allow ``time for reflection'' and give conventional
disarmament talks a chance before deciding to modernize U.S.
short-range missiles in Europe.
   The decision to update Lance missiles stationed in West Germany
_ which the United States has proposed _ will not become urgent
until about 1992, Mitterrand told a news conference.
   He said he hoped the issue of short-range missiles, which has
split NATO, could be dealt with calmly at the Brussels meetings of
the alliance.
   ``If we have to modernize, then let's do it,'' he said. ''But
how do we know it's necessary?''
   Still, the French president said he thought ``the time has not
come, far from it,'' for a ``zero option'' eliminating all
short-range missiles from Europe.
   France, which is a member of NATO but not part of its integrated
military command, has already decided to modernize and extend the
range of its own short-range nuclear missiles.

   Foreign Minister Moshe Arens said today Israel
has asked the United States to lead an international campaign to
raise $2 billion for rehabilitating Palestinian refugee camps in
the Israeli-occupied territories.
   Arens said the Israeli request was included in a letter from
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir to President Bush. The foreign
minister outlined the proposal, as well as an Israeli plan for
elections among the 1.7 million Palestinians, to Vice President Dan
Quayle today.
   Quayle ``endorsed the plan in principle but said he wanted to
hear more details,'' said vice presidential spokesman David
Beckwith.
   Disclosure of the Israeli request appeared designed to shift
some of the emphasis away from the controversial election proposal
that is part of a four-point plan adopted earlier this week by
Israel's Cabinet and parliament.
   The plan, formulated under international pressure for Israel to
resolve the 17-month uprising in which nearly 500 Palestinians have
been killed, also calls for an Egyptian-Israeli-American summit
meeting to lend impetus to the initiative and for some 20 Arab
states at war with Israel to talk peace.
   Arens told reporters at a breakfast meeting that Israel already
had raised the refugee rehabilitation proposal with Japan and he
will ask the European Economic Community for its help when he meets
with the group in Brussels next week. Money from oil-rich Arab
states would also be welcome, he said.
   Israel is hoping that by building new housing and providing
employment opportunities for the 300,000 Palestinians it estimates
live in camps, it will alleviate some of the bitterness that
spawned the Palestinian uprising against the 21-year Israeli
occupation, he said.
   Arens said that in meetings Thursday with Secretary of State
James A. Baker III and National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft he
had emphasized that the whole Israeli package must have unqualified
U.S. support that would then generate its acceptance in the Arab
world.
   ``We feel it's now the turn of the United States at bat to
declare wholehearted and unreserved support for this initiative,''
Arens said.
   Arens told U.S. officials that now was not the time to discuss
details of the election proposal, such as which Palestinians would
be allowed to participate and whether Israel would agree to
international supervision.
   ``I hope I was successful in convincing my interlocuters here''
of that view, he said.
   Details could be worked out later but Israel accepts the
principle there must be free and democratic elections, he said.
``Israel is not Panama and Shamir is not (Panamanian Gen. Manuel
Antonio) Noriega,'' he said.
   Arens said Baker ``promised to go to bat and do what he can to
further this initiative.''
   But a U.S. official, speaking Thursday on condition of
anonymity, said that while the Israeli plan is a good start, it
raises many questions. The official said the United States has been
``looking at what opportunities it affords and what questions
remain to be answered.''
   Baker told Arens the next step will be for Israel to start talks
with Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip to discuss
details for the elections and the conditions that would be
acceptable to each side, said the U.S. official.
   Israeli sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, say the
United States is pressing Israel to give answers to several
questions raised by Baker in a letter to Israeli Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir last week regarding the election blueprint.
   Arens said he had urged the Bush administration to grant
``wholehearted and unreserved American support for this peace
initiative.'' Such support, he said, ``has a good chance of
enlisting support among other countries throughout the world, and
eliciting a positive reaction from the Arab world, and that is a
necessary precondition for this thing to really take off.''
   The plan envisions balloting to elect Palestinians who would
negotiate with Israel for limited self-rule in the West Bank and
Gaza. Following several years of self-rule, Israel would then
engage in talks on the future of the lands which it captured from
Egypt and Jordan in the 1967 war.
   The plan excludes any participation by representatives of the
PLO, and Egyptian leader Hosni Mubarak and Jordan's King Hussein
have said they would not accept it unless the Palestine Liberation
Organization approves.

   Phu Dorje, a Sherpa who guided a
U.S.-Mexico expedition this week that put the first Mexican atop
Mount Everest, fell to his death during the descent, according to a
report received here Friday.
   Dorje, 26, slipped and fell to his death at the 28,044-foot
level Tuesday, the same day he and another Sherpa, Dawa Norbo, had
reached the 29,028-foot summit along with Ricardo Torres Nava, 34,
of Mexico City, the report from the expedition's base camp said.
   The expedition was led by Walter McConnell, 57, of Wharton,
N.J., had launched their successful summit bid from their assault
camp at 26,950 feet.
   On the descent, they reached the south summit 270 feet below the
main summit, and Dorje told the others that ``he would go ahead''
and asked them to come down ``slower and carefully,'' the report
said. He was killed shortly after that.
   Dorje was on his second conquest of Everest. He had climbed it
last autumn along with a U.S. expedition from the Pacific Northwest.

<TEXT>
   Dissident groups are blaming the
United States for the bloody suppression of a 1980 uprising, using
the deep political wounds it left to demand the fall of the South
Korean government and inflame anti-Americanism.
   Dissidents routinely attack the United States for meddling in
Korean affairs, charging that Washington has controlled a
succession of authoritarian governments in Seoul. One of the most
frequent accusations is of alleged U.S. involvement in the Kwangju
uprising in which hundreds were killed and wounded.
   Radical students in Kwangju claim tanks and troops from U.S.
forces based in South Korea took part in putting down the May 1980
uprising by students and townspeople.
   ``I have seen videotapes of the American tanks and soldiers in
Kwangju,'' said Lim Chong-soo, who was 11 during the nine-day
uprising. Posters put up in Kwangju to mark the anniversary alleged
that U.S. troops helped South Korean units that shot students and
townspeople.
   U.S. troops were not involved in Kwangju, but the belief is
spreading among some students despite a lack of evidence and
denials by U.S. and Korean officials.
   ``Drive out the Yankees!'' chanted crowds of up to 100,000
protesters who marched in Kwangju on Thursday to mark the
anniversary. The crowds applauded wildly as dissident leaders
blamed the United States for what happened.
   The uprising continues to haunt South Korean politics, with many
in the opposition contending the nation cannot have political peace
until the men responsible are punished and all the facts of the
incident exposed.
   Some U.S. and South Korean officials and other observers worry
the battle over Kwangju may add to anti-Americanism that is strong
among some Koreans, especially students and farmers.
Anti-Americanism is inspired by growing national pride, trade
friction and a sense that Washington treats South Korea as a lackey
despite its growing strength and importance.
   Dissident leaders, who do not claim U.S. troops were involved,
contend the United States helped direct the suppression of the
uprising. They contend the United States encouraged former
President Chun Doo-hwan, Roh Tae-woo and other senior generals to
suppress the uprising and take control of the government.
   ``The United States ... controlled the Kwangju massacre,'' the
dissident alliance, the United National Democratic Movement, said
in an open letter to President Bush when he came to Seoul in
February.
   The dissidents, who have staged violent anti-government rallies
and labor strikes in recent months, are demanding the overthrow of
Roh, who is now president, and the expulsion of the 43,000 U.S.
troops based in South Korea. Roh won elections in late 1987 and
replaced Chun at the end of his seven-year term.
   ``TheAmerican troops must leave Korea. We cannot have peace
until they go,'' Lim said as other students nodded in agreement.
   South Korean troops put down the uprising that began after
townspeople and students seized a government armory and said they
were opposing the efforts of generals to take control of the
government. The government says 192 people were killed and about
800 wounded, dissidents say the death toll was about 2,000.
   Many older people in Kwangju who lived through the uprising say
U.S. troops were not involved. They worry about how the idea of
U.S. complicity is growing among some young people and the growing
radicalism of some students.
   Park Chan-bong, whose 17-year-old son was killed in the
uprising, said, ``Most Kwangju people do not agree with these
allegations that the United States is responsible for the
massacre.''
   Taxi driver Yang Young-ko, 40, agreed that U.S. troops and
officials were not involved, but he said there is a feeling among
residents that the United States could have done more to prevent
the bloodshed.
   ``The United States as a big brother should have used its power
to stop the military government from killing all those people,'' he
said
   The dissidents' claim about U.S. involvement in Kwangju center
on charges that U.S. commanders allowed South Korean generals to
move troops to Kwangju and the U.S. government supported the
generals' seizure of power. Most South Korean troops are under the
command of a U.S. general as part of the alliance between the two
nations against communist North Korea.
   The U.S. government repeatedly has denied any involvement in the
uprising. U.S. officials say it was a South Korean affair and
Korean generals and officials acted on their own without consulting
U.S. counterparts.
   ``This is a Korean show and Americans have no role in it. The
American role was insignificant,'' said a senior U.S. official, who
declined to be identified further.
   But the uprising is one of several factors creating
anti-Americanism and troubling the close alliance between
Washington and Seoul, the official said.
   ``In terms of a target, the U.S. is like an elephant in a
bathtub,'' he said.

<HEAD>Baltics Call on Moscow to Renounce Wartime Pact with Germany</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The legislatures of two Baltic republics appealed
to Moscow to renounce a 1939 pact with Nazi Germany under which
Josef Stalin absorbed their once-independent states into the Soviet
Union, Tass said Friday.
   The Supreme Soviets of Lithuania and Estonia took the action
Thursday, according to the official news agency. The republics on
the same day declared for themselves far more independence than
Moscow intends to allow.
   The measures may force a confrontation with the Kremlin.
   The two republics asked the Kremlin to renounce the
Molotov-Ribbentrop pact that divided Eastern Europe into Soviet and
German spheres of influence.
   Lithuania asked the new Congress of People's Deputies, which
meets for the first time May 25, to condemn the treaty and ``to
pronounce it unlawful and null and void from the moment it was
signed,'' Tass said.
   Estonia's legislature also declared the pact violated
international law and asked that it be nullified, Tass said.
   The Soviet Union maintains the pact was necessary to forestall a
Nazi attack and give the Soviets time to prepare for war with Adolf
Hitler, whose forces attacked the Soviet Union in June 1941.
   Nullification of the pact would strengthen claims by the Baltic
republics for greater independence, toward which they have been
striving for the past year.
   Besides claiming greater economic autonomy, Lithuania also today
followed Estonia's example and declared its ``sovereignty'' from
Moscow.
   The law specifies that national Soviet laws are valid in
Lithuania only if they are also approved by the Lithuanian
parliament, effectively claiming the republic can veto Kremlin
decisions.
   The Estonian Supreme Soviet passed a similar law in November.
The Kremlin pronounced the law invalid, but Estonia still considers
it to be in force.
   Lithuania's economic law includes provisions for printing its
own money, and Estonia's would allow limited private property. Both
republics' economic plans gave them control over virtually all
industry on their territory and declare them the sole masters of
their natural resources.
   But a Moscow commission headed by non-voting Politburo member
Yuri Maslyukov wants Kremlin control over energy and at least half
of heavy industry, as well as all defense production in the area.
It also prohibits republics from printing their own money.

   The Iran-Contra book that Majority Leader
George J. Mitchell wrote with a fellow senator brought him $22,500
in royalties last year, but he remained one of the Senate's least
wealthy members.
   Mitchells annual financial disclosure form, among the 100 filed
by all senators and released today, showed that making speeches was
more lucrative than helping write a book. Mitchell, D-Maine, earned
$42,500 in speeches, above the limit, but gave $8,000 of that to
charity, which brought him into compliance.
   His co-author on the book ``Men of Zeal'' _ fellow Maine senator
William Cohen, a Republican _ reported that he received $25,763,
and that included royalties from a a spy novel he co-wrote years
ago with former Sen. Gary Hart, D-Colo.
   The annual disclosure forms of income in 1988, showed that in
many cases the chief providers of speaking fees and free trips were
the groups interested in legislation before the committees on which
the senator sits.
   For instance, Wyche Fowler of Georgia, a Democrat on the
Agriculture Committee, earned $28,000 for speeches and $16,000 came
from agriculture, food, beverage and tobacco interests. Bennett
Johnson of Louisiana received $10,000 from energy groups. He sits
on the Energy Committee.
   But speaking fees weren't the only pluses for being a senator.
Trips figure largely in many senators' lives. Among many that
Johnston listed was one to Alaska, paid for in part by Alaskan Oil
and Gas and Conoco.
   Both Oregon senators, Republicans Bob Packwood and Mark
Hatfield, accepted free trips to the Far East with their wives,
from different sources. Thomas Daschle, D-S.C., took four
expense-paid trips with his wife that included Puerto Rico and the
Kentucky Derby.
   Albert Gore of Tennessee, a presidential candidate in 1988,
received a round trip for himself and his wife to Acapulco, Mexico,
paid for by the Lomas Financial Group of Dallas. Gore listed
$26,800 in honoraria; $16,000 of that came from food, beverage and
tobacco groups.
   Even the richest among the senators accepted speaking fees. In
the case of John Heinz of Pennsyvlania, a Republican whose pickle
and ketchup fortune is between $11.3 million to $13.6 million and
more, all $10,000 in honoraria went to food banks.
   Some surprising facts came to light with the disclosure forms.
Slade Gorton of Washington, a Republican restored to the Senate
after a two-year absence, owned stock in the Exxon Corp. He has
been an outspoken critic of the oil giant's handling of the Alaska
oil spill.
   The Mitchell-Cohen book, subtitled ``A Candid Inside Story of
the Iran-Contra Hearings,'' focuses on the joint House-Senate
committee hearings that played to a television audience of millions
in the summer of 1987.
   In a Senate noted for its millionaire members, Mitchell is one
of the paupers. He lists assets of less than $16,000.
   The disclosure forms list assets and liabilities only in ranges.
   Mitchell's counterpart, Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas,
earned $116,090 to $132,272, of which $99,500 was his Senate
salary. He made $36,000 for speeches but he gave $31,750 of that to
charity.
   The two Senate leaders earn $10,000 a year more in salary than
the other senators but they, too, may keep honoraria equaling only
40 percent of salary. That amount is $35,800 in the case of all but
Robert Byrd, D-Va., who was last year's majority leader, and Dole.
   Each senator must list the source of honoraria. Dole's breakdown
showed $6,000 from groups interested in finance, $10,000 from
health groups, $4,000 from transportation groups. He reported his
assets between $292,295 and $691,277 and no liabilities.
   Dole said he received gifts worth nearly $5,000, including a set
of lithographs portraying the heritage and history of Armenian life
and a crystal magnolia for his wife, Elizabeth, who is now
President Bush's labor secretary.
   The chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Sam Nunn of
Georgia, reported receiving $46,950 from speech-making and he gave
$11,686 to charity, to get under the limit. Of the honoraria,
$10,000 was from the defense industry, with which his committee
deals.
   The disclosure form shows Nunn, a Democrat, is probably a
millionaire. He lists his assets in the range of $942,015 to
$1,195,000 plus.
   The usual list of the richest senators got a new member in 1989,
Sen. Herbert Kohl, a Wisconsin Democrat. Kohl, who owns the
Milwaukee Bucks of the National Basketball Association, listed
assets in the range of $19.4 million to $27.7 million or more.
   After his election last November, his investments were
transferred to a blind trust.
   The other senators with big bucks include those with the
best-known names, John D. Rockefeller IV, D-W.Va., an heir to the
vast oil fortune; Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., and Heinz.
   John C. Danforth, R-Mo., grandson of the man who founded the
Ralston-Purina company, listed assets of $7.8 million to $13
million or more and returned to the list, as did William Armstrong,
R-Colo., and Alan J. Dixon, D-Ill. Not returning is Lowell Weicker,
R-Conn., who was defeated for re-election.
   The disclosure rules ask each senator to declare assets,
liabilities, earned and unearned income; amounts given to charity
and money received for speeches and articles _ called honoraria.
Contributions to charity usually represent money the senator has to
give away because of limits.
   Assets include anything of value such as real estate, stocks,
bonds, and trust _ but not the senator's home or property owned
solely by the senator's spouse and children.

   Deposed Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos
was in very critical condition today following kidney, cardiac and
pulmonary failure, hospital officials said.
   His successor, Corazon Aquino, said she would not permit Marcos
to return to the Philippines to die despite an appeal from Marcos'
wife, Imelda. She said today that the government also wouldn't
allow him to be buried in his homeland.
   Marcos, 71, who has been hospitalized for more than four months,
suffered kidney failure Thursday morning and underwent surgery to
prepare him for kidney dialysis, said Gene Tiwanak, assistant
administrator at St. Francis Medical Center.
   The former president also suffered cardiac and pulmonary failure
and had pneumonia and other severe infections, said Dr. Azucena
Ignacio, an internist at St. Francis and one of Marcos' personal
physicians.
   Marcos' fever rose this morning, Mrs. Marcos told reporters as
she left the hospital to go home and make telephone calls. She
planned to return later.
   The former president appeared to be responding to treatment but
was still in very critical condition, a hospital source told The
Associated Press.
   ``The doctors fear for his life, that he could go anytime,''
Mrs. Marcos said in a telephone interview from her home. She said
she had been trying repeatedly to get through to Malacanang Palace
to appeal to Mrs. Aquino personally to let her husband ``go home to
his fatherland as his dying wish.''
   She said if the United States granted them permission to return
to the Philippines, it ``would show a humanitarian and a kinder and
gentler America.'' The Marcoses cannot leave the island of Oahu
without U.S. permission.
   When told by reporters earlier that Mrs. Aquino had announced
her decision to bar Marcos from returning, Mrs. Marcos said, ``We
are aware, but I am a believer and I am an optimist. I know
miracles can happen.''
   Marcos was lapsing in and out of consciousness after the
operation, said a hospital source who asked not to be identified.
   Marcos was being treated with antibiotics and heart medication,
Ignacio said. ``Some medications are working, some are not,'' he
said.
   Mrs. Marcos and their son, Ferdinand Jr., spent part of Thursday
praying in the hospital chapel, and about 70 supporters attended a
prayer service for Marcos in the evening.
   Marcos' sister, Fortuna Barba, was also at the hospital, and the
couple's daughter, Irene Araneta, was coming to Honolulu from her
home in Woodside, Calif., said Joe Lazo, president of Friends of
Marcos.
   The Marcoses have lived in exile in Hawaii since they were
toppled in a February 1986 popular uprising that ended two decades
of rule and brought Mrs. Aquino to power. Mrs. Aquino has
repeatedly cited national security in rejecting previous requests
from Marcos to return to his homeland.
   Mrs. Aquino said today in Manila that she was sorry to hear that
Marcos' condition had deteriorated ``and I pray that he will be
able to recover.''
   ``I regret to inform Mrs. Marcos, if indeed she is asking me for
reconsideration, because as I have said in the past, much as I
agree that Mr. Marcos has his rights, I still have to consider also
the rights and interests of millions of Filipinos,'' Mrs. Aquino
said.
   ``I have already said in the past that we will not allow his
remains to be brought back here,'' she added.
   Mrs. Aquino's national security adviser, Rafael Ileto, had said
earlier that Cabinet officials would meet next week to discuss,
among other things, whether to allow Marcos to be buried on
Philippine soil.
   Share prices fell today on the Manila Stock Excange following
rumors that Marcos had died, traders said.
   Marcos entered the hospital Jan. 15 with heart, kidney and
respiratory ailments. He lapsed into critical condition Tuesday,
one day after he was moved into the intensive care unit.
   It was the third time Marcos has been hospitalized since early
December, when he was admitted for pneumonia, bronchial asthma and
congestive heart failure.
   The Marcoses are facing federal racketeering charges for
allegedly looting more than $100 million from the Philippines to
buy art and real estate in New York. Marcos has been separated from
the case because of his ill health. Mrs. Marcos is free on $5
million bail.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tips generated from a network anti-crime program
led to the arrest of a fugitive convicted of stealing more than $16
million in the largest theft of Medicaid funds since the program
began 22 years ago.
   Sheldon Weinberg, 64, was arrested Wednesday night in
Scottsdale, Ariz., just hours after he was featured on NBC-TV's
``Unsolved Mysteries.''
   An anonymous caller, one of hundreds of viewers who phoned in
tips, gave the FBI Weinberg's alias and address at a
garden-apartment complex.
   Weinberg and his two sons, who had operated a Brooklyn health
clinic, were convicted Nov. 30, 1988, of stealing more than $16
million from Medicaid between 1980-87.
   ``It is fitting indeed that ordinary citizens, whose millions of
stolen tax dollars directly financed Sheldon Weinberg's obscenely
lavish lifestyle ... should be the instrument of his ultimate
downfall,'' said Deputy Attorney General Edward J. Kuriansky.
   Kuriansky said Weinberg had used the money he defrauded from
Medicaid to finance an $18,000-a-month apartment in Manhattan's
Trump Tower, a $5 million lakefront mansion in Boca Raton, Fla.,
yachts and a fleet of custom cars.
   ``This reverse Robin Hood has finally gotten his just
desserts,'' he said.
   At the trial in state Supreme Court, prosecutors charged that
Weinberg and his sons falsely billed Medicaid by submitting phony
reimbursement claims for about 400,000 phony patients.
   Weinberg failed to appear at his Jan. 10 sentencing this year
and has been the target of a nationwide search since then.
   Following extradition proceedings in Arizona, Weinberg will be
returned to New York to begin serving a seven-to-21-year prison
term that was imposed in absentia.

   Premier Ciriaco De Mita resigned today after
repeated sniping by the Socialists, his main partner in the
13-month-old coalition government.
   De Mita turned in his resignation as head of Italy's 48th
postwar government to President Francesco Cossiga.
   The president asked De Mita to stay on in a caretaker capacity.
The political negotiations aimed at forming a new coalition could
take weeks.
   De Mita, a Christian Democrat, announced his resignation after
an urgent Cabinet meeting requested by his main political foe,
Bettino Craxi, a former premier who leads the Socialists. Craxi
called the Cabinet meeting to discuss what he called a ``political
and government crisis.''
   Earlier today, in a closing speech at the Socialist convention
in Milan, Craxi said a ``political and procedural clarification''
about the five-party coalition government was needed immediately.
   The Socialists and Christian Democrats have been squabbling for
weeks over a variety of issues, with Craxi and fellow party members
accusing De Mita of failing to take a leadership role. The
government, which took office in April 1988, also includes the
small Republican, Social Democrat and Liberal Parties.
   Craxi and his aides have made no secret that the Socialist
leader would like o regain the premiership.
   The Socialists are Italy's third largest party but have great
weight in forming a government. That is because no party has a
majority and the Christian Democrats, who have dominated all
governments since the end of World War II, refuse to bring the
Communists, Italy's second largest party, into the Cabinet.

<HEAD>Candidate for Civil Rights Post Already Working at Justice Department</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   William Lucas is working for the Justice
Department as a $284-a-day consultant while awaiting Senate
confirmation as assistant attorney general for civil rights, the
department said Friday.
   Lucas, whose nomination is opposed by some civil rights groups
who question his professional qualifications, is studying the
Justice Department's role in training law enforcement officials to
be sensitive about civil-rights issues and report potential
violations, said David Runkel, chief Justice Department spokesman.
   The $284 per-day consulting agreement, which took effect March
20, is a common arrangement for Bush administration officials
awaiting Senate action on their nominations, Runkel said.
   Lucas, who garnered more than half his 1988 earnings as a
consultant for the Republican National Committee, continued to work
for the GOP until February, Runkel said.
   The Justice Department consulting contract was negotiated with
Lucas after he stopped working for the Republican Party, Runkel
said. Lucas generally works five days a week as a consultant but is
not paid for the days he spends paying calls on senators who will
vote on his nomination, Runkel said.
   The $284 daily rate is equivalent to an annual salary of $73,840.
   Runkel dismissed suggestions that Lucas was given the contract
simply to tide him over during the Senate conformation proceedings.
   Besides benefiting the department, Runkel said, the study will
help Lucas get ``more deeply involved in what's going on in the
civil rights division,'' Runkel said.
   ``There is a need to do it or it wouldn't be done,'' Runkel said
of the study.
   Lucas will submit a report to the Justice Department following
his review of: training and manpower resources of federal law
enforcement agencies on civil rights, the role the department plays
in training local law enforcement officials.
   The study will also focus on how the Justice Department can
improve the reporting of civil rights violations by state and local
police and obtaining local cooperation in investigating such
complaints, according to the contract he signed with the department.
   No date has been set for Lucas' confirmation hearing by the
Senate Judiciary Committee. The panel's chairman, Sen. Joseph R.
Biden Jr., D-Del., said Thursday he wanted to determine the scope
of the committee staff's investigation before setting a date.
   The major issue being raised by civil rights groups opposing
Lucas is his lack of legal experience, particularly on civil rights.
   On his Senate questionnaire, Lucas said he has never tried a
legal case in court since he entered private legal practice in
Detroit two years ago.
   Before that, Lucas, a former FBI agent and New York City police
officer, served as sheriff and chief executive of Wayne County,
Mich.
   A black Republican who ran unsuccessfully for Michigan governor
in 1986, Lucas had been a lifelong Democrat before joining the GOP
in 1985.
   His financial disclosure form showed that last year Lucas earned
$65,000 as a GOP consultant studying ways to recruit blacks into
the Republican Party. He earned $53,000 as a lawyer last year and
was paid $7,500 as a corporate director.

<TEXT>
   Some of Ronald Reagan's greatest admirers are in
Japan, and the former president will visit them in October for a
week of speeches and other events.
   Two of Reagan's friends, however, appear to be sidelined by the
Recruit influence-peddling scandal, which has touched the top ranks
of Japanese politics.
   Reagan and former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone called each
other Yasu and Ron, but Nakasone's office said he had no plans to
see his friend during the visit. His successor Noboru Takeshita,
who also was on a first-name basis with Reagan, has said he will
resign because of the scandal.
   Takeshita and Nakasone are under fire for benefiting from
cut-price unlisted shares in a subsidiary of Recruit Co. that
soared in value when offered on the market. Executives of the
company face trial on charges of bribing other government officials.
   There have been reports of a bidding war to sponsor events
during the Reagan visit.
   New York Times columnist William Safire said he was told the
former president's fee for the week would be about $2 million. He
did not give the source of the information.
   Japanese companies involved have denied the report and Reagan's
office in California declined comment. Mark Weinberg, a Reagan
spokesman, said the fees ``were a private matter.''
   Charles Z. Wick, former director of the U.S. Information Agency
director, helped arrange the visit.
   ``I feel quite certain, as do many other people in Japan and the
United States, that President Reagan's visit ... will serve a
number of constructive purposes for both countries,'' he said.
   While Reagan was in office, Nakasone and Takeshita invited him
to visit Japan. Takeshita made a side trip to California last
winter, after visiting Washington, to renew the invitation and
thank Reagan for the generally good U.S.-Japanese relations during
his eight-year tenure.
   An official Japanese government invitation was sent after Reagan
indicated he could make the trip in October. A Foreign Ministry
official said some details of the visit had yet to be arranged.
   Hideo Sato, professor of international relations at Tsukuba
University, said the Japanese feel some nostalgia for Reagan now
that President Bush has taken over.
   ``During Reagan's administration, there was a feeling that
things were going well, that he supported a free economy, but with
Bush things have changed dramatically,'' he said.
   ``The U.S. goverment's trade council has come to endorse managed
trade and the negotiators have become much more result-oriented. .
.. Now people feel that U.S.-Japan relations may be breaking down.''
   Fujisankei Communications Group, a media conglomerate with
newspaper and television interests, will be the main sponsor of
``Reagan Week,'' which is to begin about Oct. 19. Spokesman Makoto
Matsui said the group plans several speeches and events, but that
details were not yet available.
   When asked about the fee, he said it was ``a private matter''
but the figure of $2 million was not accurate.
   Shuwa Corp., also said to have been a bidder, denied Safire's
comment that it ``reportedly offered $5 million.'' Shuwa has
extensive real estate interests in the United States.

<HEAD>Northern Irish Voters Move From Extremes</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with more election results. No pickup.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Voters edged away from Northern
Ireland's militant extremes and boosted moderates today on both
sides of the communal divide, according to nearly complete returns
from local elections.
   With all but 20 of the 566 council seats counted nationwide, the
gap between moderate and radical parties widened, with moderates
ahead 2-to-1 in both the Protestant and Roman Catholic camps.
   On the Catholic side, the larger Social Democratic Labor Party
was showing the best election performance in its 20-year history,
winning 120 seats compared to 101 in the last election in 1985. It
had gained 3 percent to hold 20.8 percent of the total vote.
   Sinn Fein, the political backer of the militant Irish Republican
Army won 11 percent of the total vote, down slightly from the 11.7
percent it had in the last election. The party was weaker in rural
areas and was expected to lose 15 of its 59 council seats.
   But in west Belfast, Sinn Fein's traditional stronghold, the
party was 3.1 percent stronger and rose to an 18.7 percent share.
Though the Social Democrats increased their Belfast vote by 1.8
percent, Sinn Fein remained the capital's largest party and the
council stayed protestant controlled.
   The shift toward moderates appeared more pronounced on the
Protestant side, where Rev. Ian Paisley's hard-line Democratic
Unionist Party slumped by 6.3 percent and shed about 30 seats to
105.
   The larger, more moderate Official Unionists gained 2.1 percent
and was expected to finish with about 190 seats.
   Local elections matter little since the British government runs
most of the province's affairs. But they are watched closely for
pointers to the relative strengths of moderates and hardliners, and
any gain for Sinn Fein would sound alarm bells in London and Dublin.
   ``It does look as though there has been some move away from the
extremes,'' said Tom King, the Cabinet minister who runs Northern
Ireland.
   But Sinn Fein's Alex Maskey, re-elected in Belfast, said the
vote in the capital endorsed his party's campaign to rid Northern
Ireland of British rule. But the 51-seat Belfast council remained
firmly in Protestant control.
   Among the more spectacular results were the Social Democratic
and Labor Party's 7.8-percent gain in Londonderry, another IRA
redoubt, and Sinn Fein's 4.7-percent slide in Enniskillen, scene of
a November 1987 IRA bombing that killed 11 Protestants and still
arouses abhorrent memories.
   In Paisley's home town of Ballymena, his party lost 11 percent
and three seats.
   Paisley said his voters were apathetic because they believe the
British government is interested only in the balance of power
concerning the IRA.
   The Protestant parties are deeply embittered by a 1985
Anglo-Irish Agreement giving the Irish government a say in Northern
Ireland's affairs. They see Ireland as a hostile,
Catholic-dominated state intent on dissolving their union with
Britain.
   Strong personalities proved able to override doctrinal divides.
   In Larne, popular Catholic priest Pat Buckley promised to serve
all sectors of the community and won handsomely on a largely
Protestant vote.
   In Magherafelt, social worker Mary McSorley romped home as an
independent. She had been kicked out of the Social Democratic and
Labor Party for affronting Irish nationalists by accepting a medal
from Queen Elizabeth II.
   Other mold-breakers were five self-styled Conservatives who
pledged to attract mainland British parties into the province. They
argue this would strip Ulster politics of their sectarian character
and move them onto conventional left-right lines.
   Overall, a pattern emerged of an electorate either indifferent _
turnout was down 4 percent _ or wanting moderate Protestants and
Catholics to work together.

   A suspended driver drove a bus
through three plate glass windows at a garage station, and fled by
catching another bus, officials say.
   The driver, Rene Rose, 27, had been suspended Wednesday, said
Thomas Sturgess, director of communications for the Bi-State
Development Agency, a transit and economic development agency in
the St. Louis metropolitan area, including parts of Illinois.
   Ms. Rose stopped a bus shortly after midnight on Thursday and
forced the driver to take it to the garage where the buses are
stationed, he said.
   ``She then got in the driver's seat and drove through the plate
glass windows,'' Sturgess said. No one was hurt.
   The bus drove through two saplings spaced about 8 feet apart,
crashed through the windows and became wedged in the garage's
lounge and snack bar, the Belleville News-Democrat reported.
   ``She was in the building for a while, but ran out and caught
another bus to another location'' where police captured her,
Sturgess said.
   She was being held on charges of resisting arrest and traffic
violations, said Officer Willie Haire of the East St. Louis Police.
   Sturgess estimated that the building sustained less than $20,000
damage. He declined to say whether the company would try to recover
the cost of the repairs from Ms. Rose.
   ``There's a possibility she will be fired,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov was criticized Thursday
as ``ecologically illiterate'' by a Soviet parliamentarian who said
his possible replacement will be debated when the new congress
meets next week.
   The extraordinary criticism of the Soviet head of government,
who also sits on the ruling Communist Party Politburo, came at a
news conference on Soviet diplomatic initiatives to promote world
cooperation on environmental protection.
   The remarks by Alexei V. Yablokov heralded a battle between
Ryzhkov and environmental activists elected to the 2,250-seat
Congress of People's Deputies when it convenes its first session
May 25 to elect the Soviet premier, president and other officials.
   ``We have serious reproaches to make to Comrade Ryzhkov,
chairman of the Council of Ministers,'' said Yablokov, who also is
a corresponding member of the Soviet Academy of Sciences. ``He's
ecologically illiterate, and this issue will be discussed at the
Congress of People's Deputies, and we'll discuss whether he should
remain as chairman of the Council of Ministers.''
   Other speakers, including Deputy Foreign Minister Vladimir F.
Petrovsky, State Environmental Committee chairman Fedor T. Morgun
and State Hydrometeorology Committee chairman Yuri A. Izrael _ all
Ryzhkov subordinates _ vigorously defended his ecology record.
   ``A lot of sinful decisions were made several years ago,''
Morgun said. ``But what is being done now in the Council of
Ministers and by General Secretary (Mikhail S.) Gorbachev and
Chairman Ryzhkov, well, I know their approach is very strict to the
ecological problem.''
   But Yablokov charged that Ryzhkov, 59, had made several bad
decisions since he was appointed head of government in September
1985.
   He gave only one example: the approval Ryzhkov allegedly gave at
a Dec. 3 Council of Ministers meeting for construction of a
five-plant chemical complex in western Siberia before an
environmental impact survey or technical study had been made.
   Yablokov said his fellow lawmakers should advance an alternative
to the economic development program being pursued by Ryzhkov's
government, which some environmentalists contend is causing
nationwide ecological ruin.
   ``Even now proposals are made that something has to be done with
the economy, and we should probably come forward with an alternate
program for economic development, and not only the program that
Comrade Ryzhkov proposes,'' said Yablokov, 56, a biologist elected
to the congress by Moscow-based scientific research institutes.
   Speaking later to Western reporters, Yablokov said that in more
than 100 Soviet cities, the air is now 10 times more polluted than
health regulations allow, water in rivers like the Volga is too
polluted to drink, and many foods are laced with chemicals that
make them harmful.
   ``This is of great concern to us, and maybe Ryzhkov does not
have this information available, but we do, and we are all
witnesses of the situation,'' he said.
   The lawmaker-scientist predicted Ryzkhov would be re-elected by
the congress, but not before he was given a ``dressing-down'' by
enviromentalist deputies.
   The man occupying the No. 2 Soviet protocol position behind
Gorbachev is a surprising candidate for controversy. The
ex-director of a huge machine-building plant in the Urals, Ryzhkov
was regarded as a faceless technocrat until he took control of a
high-profile Politburo commission overseeing relief efforts for
victims of the December earthquake in Armenia.
   His popularity soared in Armenia, and when the party's Central
Committee met in March to elect 100 deputies to the congress,
Ryzhkov outscored Gorbachev. Twelve of the 641 party officials
voting opposed Gorbachev's election, while only 10 objected to
Ryzhkov.
   The congress, whose members were chosen in the Soviet Union's
first multicandidate elections in more than 70 years, is expected
to become the battleground for diverse causes as environmentalists,
Baltic nationalists and other activists demand reforms.
   Yablokov said the parliament should become the ``supreme power''
in the country, and revealed that 39 of the 41 deputies elected in
Moscow met Thursday to draft common resolutions to submit to the
congress on critical issues.
   Andrei D. Sakharov, 1975 Nobel Peace laureate and human rights
activist, wrote a resolution on Soviet interethnic relations; a
group of economists wrote another one on economic reforms; and
Yablokov said he was the author of the proposed resolution on
ecology.

<HEAD>Fake Narcotics Signs Come Down</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A sheriff has decided to take down
fake signs warning of a narcotics inspection on Interstate 95 after
widespread publicity made it less likely drug couriers would be
fooled into making telltale U-turns.
   State Transportation Secretary Kaye Henderson said last week
that Sheriff Bob Vogel and Volusia County would be liable for any
accident caused by the signs.
   Melvin Stack, a legal adviser to the sheriff, said Wednesday
that Henderson's warning was not the reason Vogel had the signs
taken down. They were removed temporarily because they weren't
serving their purpose anymore after national news reports disclosed
they were fake, Stack said.
   ``In all probability, this will be put on the back burner for a
while until the drug dealers forget about it,'' Stack said.
   ``The Department of Transportation has been giving Sheriff Vogel
a hard time about placement of signs on I-95,'' he said. ``I say
they should get their own house in order and take care of the roads
around here. Stay out of the law enforcement area. That's what we
elected the sheriff for.''

<TEXT>
   The military has imposed virtual
censorship on all news about army activity, and threatened to take
legal action against non-abiding publications.
   A statement issued by the army and published in Thursday's
edition of the military magazine Al-Guwat Al-Musalaha said that
revealing activities of the armed forces or publishing information
about the southern rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army would ``be
firmly met with.''
   It charged some newspapers with not obtaining prior official
verification for army information, and of quoting SPLA radio
broadcasts. The statement did not identify the newspapers involved,
but said they were used by the rebels to ``demoralize the armed
forces and the citizens in general.''
   The ban came as the SPLA has been winning victories in its
six-year civil war against the government in Khartoum.
   The military had issued a similar statement in a milder form in
January, but enforced it in only one case. Mohammed Medani Tawfik,
editor-in-chief of Al-Rai was detained for one month in February
for publishing a report on the fall of the southern town of Nasir
to the SPLA forces. The government later confirmed the rebel
takeover of Nasir.
   The SPLA, which took up arms against the government in demand of
economic and social reforms for the south, controls most of the
southern countryside.

   An Olympic weightlifting champion won a seat in
the new Soviet parliament as Moscow finished choosing its more than
20 deputies just a week before the first session, according to
results released Friday.
   Weightlifter Yuri Vlasov won a run-off election with Viktor
Shinkaretsky in Moscow's Lyublinsky district with 66.75 percent of
the vote, according to statistics published by in the official
daily Vechernaya Moskva.
   Run-off elections in the Lyublinsky district and two other
districts in Moscow were held Thursday after repeat elections were
held on May 14.
   In the Kuntsevsky district, assistant editor Valentin Logunov of
the newspaper Moskovskaya Pravda won 60.4 percent of the vote in
his race against Afghanistan war hero Alexander Rutskoy. In the
Proletarsky region, watch factory director Alexander Samsonov won a
seat.
   Repeat elections were held in almost 200 districts across the
Soviet Union where voters were presented with a choice of only one
or two candidates in the first round of elections March 26, and
rejected them.
   In the repeat elections May 14, voters had a choice of an
average of six candidates.
   Among those elected in the repeat balloting was criminal
investigator Nikolai Ivanov in Leningrad. Ivanov said in an
election-eve TV debate that the names of Politburo member Yegor K.
Ligachev and other top officials had come up in his investigation
of corruption.
   Officials have called Ivanov's statement a provocation and
demanded an investigation of it.

   Elvis has been sighted again _ this time
as a candidate for the Onondaga County Legislature.
   Elvis Presley imitator E. Wendell Conley, 30, of Syracuse on
Thursday won the Onondaga County Democratic Committee's blessing to
campaign for the local government seat in the November election.
It's Conley's first try for elective office.
   He's been impersonating the King for the last four years and has
been delivering ``Elvisgrams'' for a year.
   He gets people all shook up at parties, in offices and anywhere
else people will pay him to help them remember the rock 'n' roll
legend.
   ``I've always been a big fan of Elvis,'' said Conley, who
admitted to taking some ribbing from committee members about his
job.
   In addition to Elvis impersonations, Conley is also a
professional musician and clown and runs a business that offers
balloons for all occasions.

   Residents of this rural hamlet are thinking
about putting in the modern convenience of telephones, but when
they got together to talk about it they had to meet in the old-time
glow of kerosene lanterns.
   A passing storm Wednesday knocked out electrical power _ itself
an innovation that arrived in Starkey just 17 years ago.
   The blackout didn't stop Bob Hald of Telephone Utilities of
Eastern Oregon Inc. from preaching the virtues of the company's
plan to bring phone signals in by microwave to the Starkey Trading
Post and from there to the community's 60 homes by buried cable.
   The community, last in Union County without phones, would have
service as complete as that in any big city, financed by government
money, Hald said: ``Whatever they have in Los Angeles, you can have
here.''
   Wes Delve called it ``a darn good deal,'' but not everyone at
the meeting was thrilled with the idea.
   Murial Wherley, 56, said she had a phone when she lived in
nearby La Grande and doesn't miss it.
   ``We love it without a phone,'' she said. ``If we wanted a
phone, we would have stayed in town.''

   Grandma may have known best after all. After
three years of research, microbiology professor Byron Murray thinks
she knew what she was talking about when she said garlic helps to
fight the common cold.
   Garlic may not be an all-purpose cure, but it kills cold-causing
viruses, at least in a laboratory dish, Murray, a microbiology
professor at Brigham Young University, has found.
   The active chemical in garlic also wipes out viruses that cause
herpes and upper respiratory infections, as well as some bacteria
and fungi, he said.
   The garlic component that thwarts these organisms is allicin, he
said Thursday at the American Society for Microbiology's annual
meeting here.
   Murray isn't sure yet of its structure or how it works, but he
said he has seen it immobilize 90 percent of a virus in a
laboratory dish within 30 minutes.
   The professor doesn't hold with the old recommendation of
wearing garlic in a bag around the neck. He suggests people take
garlic in pill form.
   ``There's a long and historic tale of garlic, going back to
medieval times,'' Murray said. ``There's a good scientific basis.
There are a number of companies that make garlic pills, but we're
doing more definitive anti-viral work with allicin and other garlic
compounds.''

   A Korean-born businessman accused of trying
to export nerve gas bombs to Iran was found guilty of conspiracy
today, but was acquitted of trying to export the gas.
   Juwhan Yun did not react when the verdict was announced. His
wife prayed silently to herself, as she had throughout the trial.
   Yun faces up to five years in prison for the conviction. The
other charge would have added an additional 10 years. Yun's
attorney, Stephen Dratch, said that under new sentencing
guidelines, Yun probably would face about 2{ years.
   Sentencing is set for July 13.
   Dratch said he would ask U.S. District Judge H. Lee Sarokin to
set the guilty verdict aside.
   U.S. Attorney Samuel A. Alito Jr. praised the verdict and
rejected the defense's argument of entrapment, saying that an
undercover operation is virtually the only way to enforce weapons
export laws.
   ``(Yun) was looking for a source of arms,'' Alito said.
   Yun was arrested Jan. 12 at U.S. Customs offices near Newark
International Airport at what he thought was to be a meeting with
an undercover agent posing as an arms dealer. He had called off the
deal for the nerve gas the night before his arrest.
   Yun was convicted of conspiring to export arms without a
license. The verdict came on the third day of deliberations.
   Dratch had argued during the nearly three-week trial that Yun
was entrapped by a slick undercover agent. He maintained that the
agent used economic coercion to entrap Yun.
   Olinsky told jurors that Yun was motivated by greed and chose on
his own to negotiate for the nerve gas sarin.
   Under Sarokin's instructions, the jury had to find that the
government proved decisively that Yun was not entrapped in order to
convict.

<HEAD>Government Sends Troops Into Capital to End Unrest</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: New thruout to ADD details of announcement, students saying
they'll resume hunger strike. No pickup.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The government on Saturday sent army troops into
Beijing to end more than a month of student demonstrations that
have shaken the communist leadership. The move amounted to
imposition of martial law.
   After the announcement, students said they would resume a hunger
strike in central Tiananmen Square, which they had called off hours
earlier. They vowed to remain in the square to press their demands
for democratic reforms.
   Premier Li Peng made the announcement in front of an audience of
several thousand at the Great Hall of the People, the national seat
of government.
   President Yang Shangkun attended, but Communist Party General
Secretary Zhao Ziyang was not seen in the national television
broadcast of the speech. Sources said Zhao, who opposed a
crackdown, offered to resign Friday.
   Li said students were not trying to disrupt social order but
that a few were taking advantage of the situation to create turmoil.
   The usually soft-spoken premier raised his voice and
occasionally waved his fist as he demanded the students end their
protests, which have evolved into the biggest show of defiance in
China's 40 years of communist rule.
   The party, government and military leaders in the audience,
mostly elderly, clapped perfunctorily. Many had grim expressions.
   President Yang, speaking next, said: ``Beijing has been in a
state of anarchy. I completely support Li Peng's report.... If the
situation were to continue, our capital would no longer be a
capital.''
   He said troops had come from outside Beijing to restore order.
However, both Yang and Li said the action was not directed against
the students.
   Beijing residents said troops were poised on a main street near
the city center and that some were entering downtown by subway. A
student who ran to central Tiananmen Square from the west said he
saw 10 to 15 army trucks immobilized in the street by residents.
   No troops had arrived in the square more than an hour after Li's
announcement, which was broadcast on national television.
   Protesters in the square drowned out the broadcast for several
minutes by singing ``The Internationale,'' the song of the world
communist movement. They then began chanting, ``Li Peng, step
down!''
   Yang said the troops were sent in to protect important
ministries and key installations.
   ``The Liberation Army is here to protect Beijing society, its
people and its future. We were forced to send the Liberation Army
into the city.'' he said.
   Li described the situation in Beijing as ``anarchic and
chaotic.''
   ``We have been reasonable for more than one month. In the world
there's no government like that,'' he said. ``The Communist Party
will resolutely deal with all turmoil and not allow it to interfere
with society.''
   Li claimed that ``a handful of persons'' seeking to overthrow
the government ``are using the hunger strikers as hostages to
coerce and force the party and the government to yield to their
political demands. In this regard, they have no iota of humanism.''
   ``It has become more and more clear that the very few people who
attempt to create turmoil want to reach their political goals _
negating the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the
socialist system and violating the constitution,'' he said.
   Upon hearing the broadcast, people swarmed toward Tiananmen
Square, where about 100,000 people already were gathered. Thousands
were clustered on nearby streets.
   The students vowed to remain until the government meets their
demands, which include a dialogue on political reforms, press
freedom, and an end to official corruption. They called on
classmates to remain passive if troops tried to force them out.
   ``Tonight we have to stay here for the future of China,'' said a
student from the central city of Hangzhou.
   ``I thought we were close to victory. Now I see it's far away,''
said another.
   About 3,000 students began a hunger strike in the square on
Saturday and agreed late Friday to end it, but they revoked that
decision after Li's announcement.
   Communist Party chief Zhao, accompanied by Li, visited some of
the strikers before dawn, boarding buses where they had sought
shelter from a rainstorm.
   ``I came too late, too late. I should be criticized by you,''
strikers quoted Zhao as saying. Students of Beijing Normal
University said Zhao had tears in his eyes as he spoke to them and
autographed their hats and shirts.
   He said the ``problems you have raised will eventually be
resolved,'' but he made no concrete offer, the students said.
   ``He was very sincere, he was sympathetic and understanding,''
said Chen Hong, a 22-year-old math major, who spoke with difficulty
through cracked lips.
   The students said Li stayed a few minutes and said little.
   Two sources said Zhao offered to resign after his four fellow
members on the Standing Committee of the Politburo, the party's
highest decision-making body, rejected his proposal that they reach
an agreement with the protesters.
   The committee said the matter would have to be considered by a
larger party body, either the entire Politburo or the Central
Committee.
   Tens of thousands of people arrived by train from across China
today to parade around Tiananmen. Many young people and workers
marched along with truckloads of uniformed police and army and navy
cadets.
   Messages were chalked on walls throughout the city criticizing
senior leader Deng Xiaoping. The prestigious Chinese Academy of
Social Sciences took up the call for Deng to retire by stretching a
banner across a driveway of the Great Hall of the People, which
faces Tiananmen Square.
   Deng, 84, reportedly wanted to crack down on the students when
they began their protests in mid-April but was unable to because of
their large numbers and strong public support.

   They are both principals of tough urban middle
schools. They both won national education awards this year. They
also happen to be married.
   ``There's a wicked rivalry,'' said Thomas P. O'Neill, a 1989
Reader's Digest American Hero in Education. ``That makes us better
principals because we have twice as many ideas.''
   His wife and fellow principal, Mary Grassa O'Neill, claimed a
top honor from the U.S. Department of Education.
   ``I think it carries over to the staff,'' Grassa O'Neill said.
   ``Initially, we didn't think about it at all,'' she said. But
then the Timilty School, headed by Grassa O'Neill, and her
husband's Solomon Lewenberg Middle School began vying for the same
first-place finishes in test scores and the same grant money and
students.
   When Boston school test scores were released recently, Timilty
School staff members were chagrined to place second in reading to
Lewenberg. But they took comfort in the fact that their average in
all subjects put them ahead of Lewenberg, Grassa O'Neill said.
   ``I always tell the staff that Timilty is the best school
compared to all the others,'' O'Neill joked.
   Students seem to enjoy the principal connection.
   Thursday, as the O'Neills toured a Timilty classroom, a student
in the front of the class whispered, ``Is that your husband?'' When
Grassa O'Neill nodded ``Yes,'' heads all over the classroom whipped
in O'Neill's direction.
   Both O'Neills command schools in high-crime areas and have to
cope with the daily realities of inner-city school life. A security
officer monitors visitors at Timilty, a precaution Grassa O'Neill
said is taken at most inner-city schools.
   The O'Neills national awards didn't involve direct, head-to-head
competition.
   Grassa O'Neill's school was one of 218 singled out for
excellence by the U.S. Department of Education. Schools were
nominated by the state and then subjected to intensive, on-site
visits. The award reflected the performance of the entire school,
right down to the custodians, Grassa O'Neill said.
   O'Neill and his school were nominated for their efforts in
turning Lewenberg around. Once on the brink of closure, it not only
has the highest reading scores of all 22 Boston middle schools but
has seen its retention rate soar from the third lowest to the third
highest.
   Reader's Digest gave O'Neill $5,000 and the school $10,000.
Grassa O'Neill didn't get any money, but she will be honored this
fall at a ceremony in the White House Rose Garden.
   Both found out about their awards in April and were
``terrifically excited,'' they said. But Grassa O'Neill's
excitement was tinged with sadness because she found out at the
same time that five of her teachers were being laid off as part of
a citywide budget crunch.
   The couple met in 1969 as English teachers at a middle school.
They married in 1975 and have 4-year-old twins.
   ``Two of everything,'' O'Neill laughed.
   In 1984, Thomas was appointed principal of Solomon Lewenberg.
One year later, Grassa O'Neill got the top post at Timilty.
   The O'Neills said they don't have their eyes on the
superintendent's office just yet, because they're fully occupied
with their present posts.
   ``I think the biggest challenge is trying to keep everybody
motivated all the time. Sometimes that's tough,'' Grassa O'Neill
said.
   ``That as well as the sort of awesome responsbility that running
a school can be on some days,'' O'Neill said.

   A homeless man accused of raping and murdering a
pregnant doctor at a hospital in January changed his plea Friday to
innocent by reason of insanity.
   Steven Smith, 23, had pleaded innocent to an indictment charging
him with the murder of Dr. Kathryn Hinnant in her Bellevue Hospital
office-laboratory late Jan. 7.
   ``We now admit he committed the crime,'' said Smith's lawyer,
Marvyn Kornberg. ``But we say he did not know what he was doing
because he did not have the mental capacity to form the intent to
commit the crime.''
   Smith, arrested Jan. 9 at a men's shelter, originally had said
he helped an accomplice named John strangle the 33-year-old woman
while robbing her. He claimed it was John alone who raped her.
   Kornberg said lab tests show that semen and some of the blood at
the scene came from Smith. The lawyer said this shows there was no
``John'' and therefore Smith is delusional.
   State Supreme Court Justice James Leff scheduled hearings for
June 21.

   A storm that slammed into the Army's Fort
Hood, Texas, base last weekend caused at least $600 million in
damage and possibly more, the Army said today.
   The service, releasing a preliminary damage estimate, said
repairs to almost 200 helicopters would cost an estimated $585
million and repairs to buildings and other facilities an estimated
$15 million.
   ``Detailed, exact cost repair figures are not available,'' said
Lt. Col. John Chapla, an Army spokesman at the Pentagon. ``But our
preliminary estimate now is that it will take about $600 million to
repair the damage identified so far.''
   The powerful storm, packing winds of 95 miles an hour, ravaged
the area May 13. Although there were no fatalities, the storm
forced 25 military families from their quarters; damaged about 200
military helicopters and damaged at least 20 percent of the fort's
buildings.
   The damage occurred even though the Army said 49 percent of the
fort's helicopters had been placed inside hangars as the storm
approached and the rest secured and tied down.
   Especially hard hit was the Army's new fleet of AH-64 attack
helicopters. Fort Hood is home to the Apache Training Brigade, and
the damage forced the base to downgrade its state of aviation
readiness.
   About 100 of the fort's 150 Apaches were damaged, each built at
a cost of $13.4 million. Of the 100, 30 to 35 were ``extensively
damaged,'' according to the Army.
   Chapla said today that the Army had not developed a timetable
for repairs nor did it know how the repairs would be financed.

<HEAD>Kansas Teen-Ager Wins National Geography Bee</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A teen-ager who attends a six-student church
school in Great Bend, Kan., walked away Friday with the
championship of the first National Geography Bee and a $25,000
college scholarship.
   Jack Staddon, 6-foot-6 and 15 years old, correctly named a flat
intermountain area in the central Andes to defeat Michael Shannon,
14, of Reading, Mass. The answer was altiplano.
   Shannon, finishing second, will receive a $15,000 scholarship,
while Kieu Luu, the third-place winner from Landover, Md., won a
$10,000 scholarship. The money will be put into interest-bearing
accounts until the winners go to college.
   Some 15,000 to 20,000 schools in 55 states and territories
participated in preliminary rounds of the bee, sponsored by the
National Geographic Society and open to students in grades 4-8. The
55 state and territorial winners, aged 10 to 15, were in Washington
this week for semifinals and the 10 top winners competed Friday.
   Moderator Alex Trebek, host of the long-running TV trivia quiz
show, ``Jeopardy,'' used maps and slides in questioning contestants
on everything from Zanzibar's most profitable 19th century trading
commodity (cloves) to the two points connected by the Alaskan
pipeline (Valdez and Prudhoe Bay).
   Staddon said he studied geography trivia cards and read through
a college geography book in preparation for the contest.
   Nevertheless, with competitors allowed to miss only two
questions before being eliminated, he blew his first question in
both the final and semifinal rounds.
   On Thursday, shown a slide of the Grand Canyon, Staddon missed
its location by a state or two. ``I said Utah,'' he recalled with a
rueful grin. It is actually in Arizona.
   And on Friday, asked by Trebek to identify an unusual
modernistic building, he replied after a long pause, ``New York. I
don't know.'' The correct answer was the Sydney Opera House.
   ``I had no idea what that was,'' Staddon said, laughing, after
winning the bee. ``I remember reading about that in my book but I
had no idea what it looked like. If I had to do this again I would
concentrate more on the pictures rather than on maps.''
   Staddon said there are two third-graders, two seventh-graders, a
first-grader and an eighth-grader (himself) at the Great Bend
Seventh Day Adventist Elementary School he attends. He said he
wants to follow in the footsteps of his father and become a church
pastor.
   The National Geography Bee, set to become an annual event, is
part of a campaign by the National Geographic Society to improve
geography education. The group also sponsors teacher workshops and
various other programs for students.
   The initiative was launched after an international Gallup Poll
comissioned by the society in 1988 showed that Americans ranked
among the bottom third in geographic knowledge. Those aged 18-24
came in last.
   The geography bee was modeled on a New Jersey bee where Sen.
Bill Bradley, D-N.J., was the host. ``I never thought I'd
appreciate a theft but I certainly appreciate this one,'' Bradley
said before the finals began.
   ``I hope we're beginning a tradition here,'' said Trebek. ``I
hope I'll be asked to do this again for many, many years to come.''

   Zhao Ziyang, in his first known rebellion against
his mentor, senior leader Deng Xiaoping, has chosen to resign as
head of the world's largest Communist Party rather than endorse a
crackdown on students demonstrating for democracy, sources said.
   As of Friday night, Zhao's resignation offer had yet to be
decided on by his colleagues in the party, the Chinese sources said.
   However, his failure to appear with Premier Li Peng and other
top party and government leaders when it was announced the military
would move in to end the student unrest appeared to make Zhao's
break with the leadership irrevocable.
   His rebellion contrasts with the fate of his predecessor, Hu
Yaobang, who was forced to step down in January 1987 after failing
to crack down on earlier nationwide student protests. It was Hu's
death April 15 that triggered the new student movement.
   Zhao, 69, tried repeatedly in recent weeks to defuse mounting
tensions between authorities suspicious of any unofficial political
activity and students demanding a free press, an end to official
corruption and other reforms.
   He reportedly sent representatives to campus to talk to students
after their marches drew hundreds of thousands of cheering
residents into the streets.
   Zhao was the first top-level official to endorse student calls
for dialogue after the party mouthpiece, the People's Daily,
condemned the student movement as a ``planned conspiracy'' aimed at
overthrowing the government.
   He spoke April 27 as 150,000 students and supporters marched
triumphantly through Beijing streets to Tiananmen Square in the
first display of the widespread public support for their movement.
   Deng reportedly issued orders to stop that march, but the crowds
of citizens who swarmed to screen the students from police and
soldiers made it impossible without bloodshed.
   Zhao used the student movement to trot out of the closet
proposals for political reform that had been largely shelved since
last summer. Worsening economic problems, including inflation
running at an annual rate of near 30 percent, had weakened his hand
and strengthened the position of officials such as Premier Li who
favored moving more slowly on both economic and political reforms.
   After students began their hunger strike in the square a week
ago, only Zhao impressed the fasters as sincere in his pleas for
them to stop and his promises that authorities were trying to
implement reforms.
   However, the students said he spoke only as an individual and
not for the government.
   Zhao was born in October 1919 to a landowning family in central
China's Henan province. He joined the Communist Party in 1938, and
headed the party committee in his native county for most of the
1937-45 China-Japan war.
   Unlike the previous generation of party leaders, he did not take
part in the 1934-35 Long March, the 7,700-mile trek from
Nationalist government troops in eastern China to the northwest.
   After the communist victory in 1949, Zhao spent most of his
career in regional government and party posts. He was purged during
the 1966-76 far leftist Cultural Revolution, as was Deng, but was
rehabilitated in the 1970s.
   He gained national prominence as party secretary and governor of
Deng's home province, Sichuan, where he implemented Deng's policies
of dismantling communes and allowing private plots and bonuses for
extra work.
   Deng brought Zhao to Beijing as vice premier in 1980. He became
premier six months later, replacing Hua Guofeng. He was made acting
party secretary in January 1987 after fellow reformer Hu Yaobang
was forced to resign.
   Zhao was confirmed in the post at an October 1987 party
conference in which his keynote speech emphasized increasing
production over ideological issues. He also announced Deng's theory
that China was in a ``primary stage'' of socialism, during which
time private ownership of businesses was permissible.
   At the same congress, a new party Politburo Standing Committee
was constituted, made up of Zhao, Premier Li Peng, Yao Yilin, Qiao
Shi and Hu Qili.
   By putting Li and Yao _ relative conservatives _ on the Standing
Committee with liberal-leaning Zhao and Hu Qili, Deng may have been
trying to prevent either faction from becoming powerful enough to
discard him. Qiao, a pragmatist, was the swing vote.
   The set-up made Deng an essential arbiter between the two
factions _ a role he apparently relished.
   In the end, Zhao's failure to win over the conservatives in the
Standing Committee, and Deng's adamant refusal to compromise with
the students, may have forced Zhao to step down.

   North Korea said Friday it will pay a bonus to all
workers, technicians and office employees in June before the 13th
World Festival of Youth and Students opens in Pyongyang in July.
   The bonus of 100 percent of regular monthly wages would be paid
under a decree adopted Thursday by the Central People's Committee,
according to official Korean Central News Agency, monitored in
Tokyo.
   The bonus will be paid ``in appreciation of the feats performed
by the working class and other laboring people in the past 200-day
campaigns,'' the report said.
   The youth festival with an anti-imperialist theme will be held
in the North Korean capital July 1-8. Officials say 30,000 people
from more than 170 countries are expected for the festival, a major
political, cultural and sports event involving mostly communist and
Third World nations.

   A new generation of college students has
discovered something old _ ballroom dancing _ and in the best
intercollegiate tradition they're turning it into a competition.
   ``You get to dance in someone else's arms and you get to get
dressed up. It's something we never did,'' said Lara Manzione, 19,
president of Brown University's Ballroom Dance Club. ``Other
generations grew up with it, but it's new for us.''
   The competition in Newport this weekend will pit students from
14 Ivy League and other Northeastern colleges against one another
doing the fox trot, cha-cha and tango.
   Manzione, a sophomore, and her partner will be one of
approximately 30 student couples from schools such as Brown,
Princeton, Dartmouth, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the
University of Massachusetts and the University of Connecticut
competing at the festival. There also will be an adult competition;
in all, some 100 couples are slated to take part in the fest.
   The collegiate dance craze began at the Ivy League schools, but
has filtered through to other campuses, said Skip Jones, president
of Friends of Ballroom Dancing, which is sponsoring the festival.
   Nearly 30 colleges in the United States have ballroom dance
clubs, about half in the Northeast, he said. Brown started its club
this year and already has 60 members, said Manzione.
   ``In the last three years, interest in ballroom dancing has
tripled,'' said Jones, who is also the United States Amateur
Ballroom Dance Association's New England college coordinator.
   ``I think what is happening to ballroom dancing in general is
that the younger generation sees rock has reached its peak and is
starting to fade,'' said Jones. ``In particular, the yuppie crowd
is starting to attend charity balls and discover that their music
isn't there.''
   A renewed interest in formal weddings also has prompted some to
take dance lessons, he said.
   Joe Bouthillier, a social dancing teacher for Brown's physical
education department, said musical styles play an important role.
   ``What's going to make a big difference is if we get a change in
(popular) music,'' he said. Still, he said, he uses music by
contemporary artists in his classes, including Sade, the Miami
Sound Machine, Lionel Richie and Stevie Wonder.
   Brown will begin offering lessons in competitive dance next
year, he said. Competitive dancing ``is the same dances and the
same steps they would use as if social dancing except for a lot
more structured,'' he said.
   Manzione said the dance association has offered used gowns,
complete with sequins and feathers, for the students to wear at the
competitions. The used dresses sell for about $80, while new
outfits cost $200 to $500.
   Does the revived interest among young people signal a return to
old times?
   ``We're well on our way,'' Jones said.

   A Czechoslovak human rights activist
arrested in a pro-democracy demonstration at Prague's May Day
parade was released from jail Friday, apparently in poor health due
to a hunger strike, an emigre source said.
   Stanislav Devaty was released following a decision by the
regional court in Brno. He was to stay in the intensive care unit
of a Prague hospital until Monday when he will be transferred to a
hospital in Gottwaldov, where he lives.
   The London-based Palach Press news publishing organization said
several criminal proceedings against Devaty were combined and will
be handled by authorities in Brno.
   The charges against Devaty, 37, were not dropped, and he will
stand trial when he recovers, according to Palach Press, quoting
dissident sources in Prague.
   Before his release was known, The Committee for the Defense of
Stanislav Devaty reportedly wrote a letter to Premier Ladislav
Adamec asking him to release the activist or be held responsible
for his death.
   An urgent appeal also was sent to the premier by the preparatory
committee of the Club for Socialist Reconstruction, Obroda.
   Devaty was charged with violating public order and could face up
to five years in jail if convicted.
   He and fellow protesters were among at least 76 people detained
on May Day when at least 600 people demonstrated on Prague's
Wenceslas Square for more democracy and the release of political
prisoners.
   Another activist, Stanislav Pitas, was sentenced to 10 months in
prison on a charge of assaulting a policeman. Palach Press said the
charge was fabricated, but did not give other details.

   President Corazon Aquino on Friday
refused to allow Ferdinand Marcos to return home to die and said
her government won't permit him to be buried here despite ``a last
appeal'' from his wife.
   The 71-year-old Marcos was in critical condition Friday in a
Honolulu hospital after emergency kidney surgery. Hospital
officials said the ousted leader was suffering from renal, cardiac
and pulmonary failure.
   Marcos' wife, Imelda, broadcast an appeal Friday to Mrs. Aquino
to allow her husband to die in his homeland, and his supporters
threatened mass protests if the request is rejected.
   But Mrs. Aquino refused to withdraw her ban on Marcos, and the
Philippine Supreme Court rejected a petition from the former
president's lawyer, Juan David, to order the return. Marcos has
lived in Hawaii since he was ousted three years ago in a popular
uprising that propelled Mrs. Aquino to power.
   ``I would like first of all to convey to the family of Mr.
Marcos that I do pray that he will still recover from this latest
critical illness,'' Mrs. Aquino said. ``I regret very much it is
not possible for us to allow him to return.''
   She said she has ``said in the past that we will not allow his
remains to be brought back here, and we have already taken plans to
avoid any untoward incidents.''
   Mrs. Aquino, whose government has survived six coup attempts,
has cited national security in refusing previous requests.
   In a statement broadcast by a pro-Marcos radio station, Mrs.
Marcos said she has tried to telephone Mrs. Aquino from Hawaii but
was told the president was busy.
   Maria Elena Cruz, Mrs. Aquino's daughter and personal secretary,
said the president received no calls from Mrs. Marcos.
   Mrs. Marcos said she was trying to contact the president ``to
make a last appeal to Madame Corazon Aquino to open her heart and
let Ferdinand come home because he is in very serious condition.''
   ``My countrymen, I am appealing to each and every one of you to
pray that, hopefully, Mrs. Aquino will know that bringing home
Marcos will bring true reconciliation, true peace and unity for our
country,'' Mrs. Marcos said. ``This is what's best for the
country.''
   Mrs. Aquino had said earlier: ``I regret to inform Mrs. Marcos,
if indeed she is asking me for reconsideration, because as I have
said in the past, much as I agree that Mr. Marcos has his rights, I
still have to consider also the rights and interests of millions of
Filipinos.''
   When told of Mrs. Aquino's statement, Mrs. Marcos said ``We are
aware, but I am a believer and I am an optimist. I know miracles
can happen.''
   Marcos supporters, meanwhile, announced they would hold rallies
Saturday to pray for his recovery. Pro-Marcos leaders warned the
former president's death in exile would trigger demonstrations.
   ``We expect tactical alliances in this nationwide mass action,''
said pro-Marcos lawyer Oliver Lozano. ``We refer to the tactical
alliances of the military, labor sector and student sector.''
   But the chief of staff, Gen. Renato de Villa, said the armed
forces would accept Mrs. Aquino's decision and was prepared to
block any attempts by the opposition to foment trouble.
   ``We will do everything in our power to see to it that law and
order prevail,'' de Villa told reporters. ``We will follow any
decision by the executive branch.''

   The condition of Rep. Claude D. Pepper, the

him as ``in very serious condition.''
   Pepper, the 88-year-old chairman of the House Rules Committee,
has been hospitalized since April 6 with an undisclosed stomach
ailment.
   ``He's pretty weak, but he's not in pain or anything,'' said Bob
Smith, a friend and aide to the Florida Democrat.
   Pepper's office issued a statement saying, ``Congressman Claude
Pepper's condition has worsened overnight. He continues to rest
comfortably at Walter Reed Army Medical Center.''
   Pepper, of Miami, recently received treatment at the Johns
Hopkins University Hospital in Baltimore but was transferred back

<HEAD>Jury Finds Businessman Guilty Of Conspiracy in Nerve Gas Dealings</HEAD>

   A Korean-American businessman was convicted
Friday of conspiring to export deadly nerve gas bombs to Iran.
   The jury, however, acquitted Juwhan Yun, 48, of Short Hills of
attempting to send the gas _ 500 quarter-ton boms of the nerve gas
overseas. No such gas was in Yun's possession, but he discussed the
deal with an undercover agent.
   Yun did not react when the verdict was announced early on the
third day of deliberations. His wife prayed silently and later
sobbed outside the courtroom.
   U.S. District Judge H. Lee Sarokin set sentencing for July 13.
Yun could receive up to five years in prison.
   ``The last chapter hasn't been written,'' said Yun's attorney,
Stephen Dratch. ``It appears the verdict very well may have been
inconsistent'' because the government's evidence was directed at
both charges, he said.
   Dratch said he would ask Sarokin to set the guilty verdict aside.
   U.S. Attorney Samuel A. Alito Jr. said he was pleased by the
verdict and that Justice, military and FBI officials were
considering further charges.
   In pretrial hearings, prosecutors said classified documents were
found at the Summit office of Yun's import-export business, and
that Yun maintained contacts at U.S. military bases and with
officials in the Chinese, Yugoslav and South Korean militaries.
Alito declined to give further details.
   Dratch countered that he and his client ``don't know what
they're talking about.'' He said he has yet to see the allegedly
classified documents.
   During the nearly three-week trial, Dratch argued that Yun was
entrapped by an undercover agent from the Customs Service posing as
an arms dealer. He maintained that the agent used economic coercion
to entrap Yun.
   Alito said entrapment was the usual defense argument when people
are caught in such stings. ``Without doing these undercover
operations, it's virtually impossible to enforce the arms export
laws,'' he said.
   Sarokin had instructed jurors that in order to convict they had
to find that the government proved decisively that Yun was not
entrapped.
   The prosecution and defense agreed that Yun contacted the
undercover agent while looking for legal ammunition, discussed
buying a type of nerve gas called sarin for Iran and called off the
deal Jan. 11.
   That was the day before he was arrested at customs offices near
Newark International Airport at what he thought was to be a meeting
with customs official Richard Kennan.
   The prosecution, however, argued to jurors that Yun only
temporarily called off the deal and intended to renew it.
   Yun said he had no intention of shipping anything illegal and
only discussed the illegal deals to secure the 105mm and 106mm
ammunition.

<HEAD>Mengistu Crushes Coup Attempt; Most Generals Killed</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Mengistu Haile Mariam
appeared to regain control in Ethiopia on Friday as a four-day
revolt by mutinous soldiers faded under the guns of loyalist troops.
   Nearly the entire high command of this Marxist government has
been killed, a Western diplomat said, in an attempted coup led by
generals humiliated in a string of recent defeats against rebels in
northern Ethiopia.
   ``If we move into a `night of the long knives,' it (the high
command) will be gutted even more,'' the diplomat said, ``There'll
be a certain amount of retribution.''
   Despite reports of continued scattered fighting, the government
confidently said it has thoroughly smashed the rebellion.
   Briefing foreign ambassadors in the capital Friday, Foreign
Minister Berhanu Bayih said the revolt ``was crushed at the center
here in Addis Ababa'' within hours Tuesday evening.
   Lingering resistance was stamped out Thursday when loyal
soldiers of the 2nd Army killed their ``commander and his
collaborators'' in Asmara, Ethiopia's second-largest city and
capital of the northernmost province of Eritrea.
   ``It was a very self-confident briefing by the minister,'' said
a Western diplomat. ``I think Mengistu has got back in the saddle.
   ``He has shown a degree of efficiency and ruthlessness that
might have surprised some,'' the diplomat said on condition of
anonymity.
   But the envoy noted the ``military situation in the north is
going to be substantially eroded.''
   Mengistu's troops have been fighting secessionist rebels in
Eritrea and another rebel group seeking autonomy for the
neighboring province of Tigre.
   But they have consistently lost ground to the rebels, despite
massive military aid from the Soviet Union, which counts Ethiopia
as its staunchest African ally.
   ``The high command was virtually gutted,'' the diplomat said of
the reported deaths of at least eight rebellious generals and the
country's defense minister, who was killed by the mutineers. Six
dissident generals are said to have been killed in the Asmara
fighting.
   Mengistu, in a radio and TV broadcast to the nation Thursday
night, promised his ``revolutionary forces will liquidate'' his
enemies.
   Plotters had ``committed treason by attempting to join hands
with secessionist and rebel movements in northern Ethiopia,'' the
president said.
   The tide turned for the mutineers Thursday when three loyal
units of the 2nd Army moved on Asmara from neighboring towns,
recapturing the radio station and killing the army's commander,
Maj. Gen. Denissie Bulto, according to Berhanu.
   The counterrevolt came only hours after the rebel Eritrean
People's Liberation Front announced it was calling a two-week
cease-fire to boost the dissidents' chances of ousting Mengistu.
   In a clandestine radio broadcast, the rebels said their leaders
had met with 2nd Army commanders to discuss ``the best way to
intensify the struggle against ... the common enemy.''
   One Western diplomat speculated that the fighting within the 2nd
Army may have been ``a backlash against the rapprochement with the
EPLF.''
   The foreign minister said the coup leaders flew elite
paratroopers to Addis Ababa from Asmara, basing half at the
international airport and the rest at an old airport converted to a
military compound on the outskirts of the city.
   On Tuesday, five of the ringleaders met at the Defense Ministry,
Berhanu said, shortly after some of them had seen Mengistu off on a
state visit to East Germany.
   As they were meeting, Berhanu said, the defense minister, Maj.
Gen. Haile Giorgis Habte Mariam, ``courageously confronted the
plotters and was killed by one of them.''
   Two of the coup leaders, both generals, were killed in a
subsequent gunfight at the Defense Ministry, a third was captured
Thursday in Addis Ababa and troops still are hunting for two more,
Berhanu said.
   He said the rebel paratroopers at the international airport
surrendered without resistance Wednesday, but those at the old
airport put up a 45-minute fight before they too gave up.
   Mengistu abandoned his visit to East Germany and returned him
Wednesday night to crush the coup attempt.
   With a clique of fellow army officers, Mengistu seized power
after ousting Emperor Haile Selassie in a Sept. 12, 1974
revolution. He inherited the northern insurrections from Selassie,
who annexed Eritrea in 1962.

<HEAD>Storm Damage to Army Helicopters Estimated at $600 Million</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Storm damage to helicopters and buildings at
the Army's Fort Hood in Texas will cost at least $600 million to
repair, the service said Friday.
   The Army said it had so far pegged last week's storm damage to
almost 200 helicopters at $585 million. Damage to buildings and
other facilities was put at $15 million.
   ``Detailed, exact cost repair figures are not available,'' said
Lt. Col. John Chapla, an Army spokesman who provided the
preliminary estimate.
   The storm, packing heavy rain and winds of 95 miles per hour,
ravaged the area on May 13. Although there were no fatalities, the
storm forced 25 military families from their quarters and damaged
the helicopters and at least 20 percent of the fort's buildings.
   The damage occurred even though the Army said about half the
helicopters had been placed inside hangars as the storm approached
and the remainder were tied down.
   Especially hard hit was the Army's new fleet of AH-64 attack
helicopters. Fort Hood is home to the Apache Training Brigade, and
the damage forced the base to downgrade its state of aviation
readiness.
   About 100 of the fort's 150 Apaches were damaged to some extent,
and 30 or more were ``extensively damaged,'' according to the Army.
   Each Apache, made by McDonnell Douglas Helicopter in Mesa,
Ariz., costs about $13.4 million new. It is designed to replace the
Vietnam War-era AH-1 Cobra as the nation's premiere tank-killer and
battlefield helicopter. It can carry laser-homing Hellfire missiles
or Hydra 70 rockets and has a 30mm chain gun.
   While the Apache fleet was hardest hit, other choppers damaged
by the storm included UH-60 Blackhawk transports, UH-1 Huey
transports, OH-58 observation copters, AH-1 Cobra attack copters
and CH-47 transports.
   Chapla said the Army had no timetable for repairs, nor did it
know where the money would come from. Some discussions have been
held on Capitol Hill about a supplemental appropriation, but those
talks are in a very preliminary stage, Chapla said.
   ``We also don't have a whole lot of experience in storm-damage
repair. We have experience in crash repairs and repairs of war
damage. Fixing all of these aircraft is not going to be a quick
thing,'' he said.
   The spokesman said the dollar estimates could climb since ``just
determining everything that's wrong is going to take time.''

   The Agriculture Department attempted Friday to
answer that not-so-ancient question: which came first, chicken or
beef? There's a bone of contention.
   Forecasts have put U.S. per capita beef consumption at the
lowest level since the early 1960s. Poultry consumption, which was
less than half of beef in 1966, is expected to rival beef this year.
   Not necessarily true, says USDA economist Judith Putnam in a new
issue of National Food Review, quarterly magazine published by the
department's Economic Research Service.
   For some years, statistics watchers have seen poultry
consumption overtake and then pass annual beef consumption by
American consumers. There have been many reasons, including prices,
shifts in diet preferences and health concerns about red meat.
   In 1987, it happened. For the first time, according to the
department, per capita consumption of poultry exceeded that of beef
_ 77.8 pounds to 73.4 unds for the year.
   The gap widened even further in 1988, with total poultry
estimated at 80.3 pounds per capita against 72.7 pounds for beef.
And the forecast for 1989 shows poultry at 84.4 pounds and beef at
69.9 pounds.
   But those estimates are on the basis of retail cuts, Putnam
said. And those include bones. Take away the bones and the figures
change.
   According to the boneless basis shown in her report, beef has
never lost the lead in the annual race for first place in the
palates of consumers. In 1987, for example, boneless beef led
boneless poultry _ which includes chicken and turkey _ by 69.2
pounds to 55.3 pounds.
   Last year, beef led poultry 68.6 pounds to 57.1 pounds per
capita, and the outlook for 1989 is beef leading poultry 65.9 to 60
pounds.
   Regardless of how its sliced, boned or not, the figures do show
something else: per capita consumption of poultry is increasing
while beef is declining.
   Total red meat consumption is something else. At an expected
135.4 pounds of retail weight, per capita consumption of beef,
veal, lamb and pork, leads total poultry's 84.4 pounds. On a
boneless basis, red meat is expected to be ahead 112.4 to 60 pounds.
   Per capita consumption of fish and shell fish, without bones,
was put at 15.4 pounds in 1989, unchanged since 1986. No boneless
figures for fish were included.

<HEAD>No PCB-Tainted Fuel Found in Random Checks</HEAD>

   No evidence of fuel contaminated by PCBs has been
found in a week of spot checks of oil tanker trucks entering Canada
from the United States, officials said, but they'll expand tests to
include other toxic waste.
   Canada's Environment Department ordered the random testing May
12, alerted by reports in the Globe and Mail newspaper that
solvents, waste oil and the polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs,
have been mixed into fuels illegally and sold in western New York
and Canada. It said the practice had been going on for four years.
   Jack Trip, chairman of the newly created federal task force on
tainted fuels, was quoted by the Globe and Mail on Friday as saying
about 40 federal inspectors will continue inspections ``for a
considerable amount of time. ... It will be on the basis of spot
checks. We won't be at the border 24 hours a day.''.
   Samples will be analyzed for substances other than PCBs ``in the
order of weeks, if not days,'' Trip said.
   An Environment Department spokesman said its officers had
analyzed 360 samples.
   ``Nothing has been found so far,'' said spokesman K. Shikaze.
   This week the department restricted oil tanker trucks to
entering Canada at 31 of 125 border crossings to control the entry
of any tainted products.
   The Globe and Mail report quoted unidentified law enforcement
sources and unnamed participants in what it said was lucrative
illicit trafficking.
   PCBs were used primarily as a coolant in electrical
transformers, but have been banned in northern America because they
have been linked with cancer.
   Lawbreakers could avoid expensive disposal fees for PCBs and
other hazardous substances and boost profits by diluting fuel.

<TEXT>
   The message that seems to have
emerged from Northern Ireland's latest election is that peace is a
long way off, and people would like to get on with their lives in
the meantime.
   As the lengthy vote count wound up Friday night, a small but
consistent shrinking was evident on the extremes of both sides of
the religious divide, and a strengthening of the center.
   But there were also enough quirks and surprises to show that for
many ordinary voters, there are more immediate issues than one's
national allegiances or the church one attends.
   Northern Ireland averages nearly one election a year, and rarely
do they make a difference. The Protestants vote for Protestant
parties, Roman Catholics for Catholic parties.
   The latest election, to choose the 26 district councils,
contained no huge surprises.
   The Protestants, who outnumber Catholics 3-2, got most of the
councils. The main change was a slump of 6 percent for the Rev. Ian
Paisley's hard-line Democratic Unionists.
   At the other end, Sinn Fein, the Irish Republican Army's
political backer, lost some ground to the larger, more moderate
Social Democratic and Labor Party, which turned in its best local
election performance ever.
   Sinn Fein's losses were in the countryside. In the Catholic
ghettoes of Belfast, its bastion, the Sinn Fein vote held firm
against SDLP advances, and it remains the largest Catholic party in
a capital once again under Protestant government.
   The party leaders gathered in TV studios to discuss the outcome,
and engaged instead in a strident dialogue of the deaf.
   Paisley and James Molyneux, the two Protestant party leaders,
stuck firmly to basics: the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement had to go
before there could be any progress.
   SDLP leader John Hume retorted that the agreement was here to
stay, and he would brook no attempt to put it on ice.
   There was no hint of compromise.
   Protestants revile the agreement because it gives the Irish
government a say in the running of Northern Ireland, and most
Protestants regard Ireland as a foreign country bent on dissolving
Northern Ireland's union with Britain.
   Paisley argued that the British government's refusal to listen
to Protestant views on the agreement made voters apathetic and led
to his party's slump.
   But his critics said it was his disruptive anti-agreement
tactics, and the paralysis they brought to local government, that
hurt him most.
   ``People were most concerned about the day-to-day issues _ cuts
in housing, attempts to interfere with the health service, social
security,'' said Hume. He attributed the SDLP's successes to the
fact that ``Those are the issues we fought the election on.''
   The election handed out many small victories that pointed to an
electorate yearning for normalcy.
   In Larne, for instance, The Rev. Pat Buckley, a popular Catholic
priest, was elected on a largely Protestant vote. Buckley promised
to work for the community on the bread-and-butter issues, and his
religion clearly made no difference.
   In Magherafelt, Mary McSorley was elected as an independent,
after she was expelled from the SDLP for affronting Irish
nationalist sensibilities by accepting an honor from Queen
Elizabeth II.
   The voters clearly admired her social work, which won her the
award, and she was not only elected but holds the balance of power
on the council.
   In Londonderry, an IRA stronghold, Protestant Ken Kerr defeated
a machine-picked candidate with his promise to talk to Catholic
adversaries. ``We have to start talking to people,'' he said. ``All
around the world we're seen as intransigent bigots, and we're not.
But we have to prove it.''
   Sinn Fein's worst setback was in Fermanagh, the only district it
captured outright in the 1985 local election. It lost half its
seats.
   Fermanagh happens to be where an IRA bomb killed 11 Protestants
in November 1987, and Sinn Fein's reputation was badly tarnished.
   The Protestant Unionists now in charge of Fermanagh have long
advocated cooperation with the SDLP.
   That is already happening in neighboring Dungannon, where
Unionist and SDLP councilors are in alliance to shut out the
militants on both sides.
   Analyst Paul Arthur said Fermanagh voters had looked at
Dungannon ``and taken that on board. That's the sort of thing they
want to see.''
   ``It gives you some hope for the future,'' said a local SDLP
leader, Austin Currie.
   ``There was a time when you only had to mention Dungannon and
you thought of divisiveness, bigotry and discrimination,'' he said.
``I'd like to think that there may be a lesson for Northern Ireland
as a whole _ that if people are given leadership they are prepared
to follow the path of partnership and responsibility-sharing.''

<TEXT>
   The government and opposition parties
Friday tentatively agreed that former president Chun Doo-hwan would
testify on alleged corruption and human rights abuse under his rule.
   Ruling party officials indicated Chun would testify once before
the National Assembly. Before that happens, however, they said
unspecified conditions must be met by the opposition.
   There was no immediate comment from Chun, who lives in exile in
a remote temple, and it was not known when he might testify.
   The agreement, considered a major breakthrough, could help
settle a year-long dispute over the legacies of Chun's
authoritarian rule.
   Chun, who left office in February, in November apologized to the
nation. But the three main opposition parties have called for a
full accounting and said that he and top lieutenants should be
prosecuted for wrongdoing.
   Dissidents and radical students have staged demonstrations to
demand Chun and his associates be punished.
   Forty-seven people, including 13 members of Chun's family, have
been charged with embezzlement and abuse of power but Chun himself
has not been touched.President Roh Tae-woo has asked the nation to
pardon Chun.
   Among other abuses, many South Koreans accuse Chun of having
crushed a civil uprising in the city of Kwangju in 1980 that
resulted in 192 deaths. Chun was a senior army general when armed
protesters opposing a declaration of martial law seized the
southern provincial capital.
   Chun took power with military backing a few months after the
uprising.
   Roh, one of Chun's key allies, has introduced broad reforms
since he took office in February 1988. But dissidents charge Roh
has failed to fully address past wrongdoings, a key factor in their
demands for his resignation.
   In Kwangju Friday, anti-government protests marking the
anniversary of the nine-day uprising continued, with thousands of
protesters marching to demand the overthrow of Roh's government.
   The protesters also accused the government of covering up
alleged police involvement in the death of Lee Chol-kyu, a
dissident student whose body was found in a reservoir near Kwangju
on May 10.
   Dissidents said Friday they would appeal to Amnesty
International if the government refuses to perform a new autopsy on
Lee's body. Dissidents have demanded an independent investigation
into the cause of his death.
   In Seoul, relatives of victims of the Kwangju uprising called
Friday for an end to political exploitation of the incident and
demanded the government provide compensation to families of those
killed.
   ``We have suffered enough, mentally and physically,'' Park
Chan-bong, who heads the Family Association of Victims of Kwangju's
Pro-Democracy Movement. ``We must not be exploited any more for
political purposes,'' Park said. He claimed his group represents
the majority of relatives of victims killed in the 1980 uprising,
and they feel their loss of loved ones is being exploited by
``political games.''
   ``Our efforts should not be used for any political groups trying
to promote their cause,'' Park said.
   Dissidents and radical students lack public support in their
calls for Roh's overthrow because of their violent tactics and
extremist views.

   The nation's top comedy writers will be
invited to participate in an annual festival of funny plays in the
hometown of the late actress Lucille Ball, city officials said
Friday.
   The Lucille Ball Festival of New Comedy is meant to be a living
tribute to the red-haired queen of television comedy, Mayor Steven
Carlson said.
   She had given the project her blessing before her death last
month at age 77, and had planned to visit Jamestown for the first
time in more than 30 years on Friday to get a key to the city and
give the festival a sendoff, officials said.
   Five giant photographs of Lucy adorned City Hall and a high
school band played her television theme song as Carlson announced
the creation of the festival.
   Carlson said the festival would commission up to three plays per
year and arrange for them to be premiered at Jamestown's Reg Lenna
Civic Center.
   ``This memorial to Lucy, unlike a building bearing her name, has
a future as lively as she was,'' said Carlson. ``Just as she was on
the cutting edge of comedy for her time, this festival is going to
keep on breaking new comedy ground.''
   Organizers hope to establish a repertory company to perform the
plays, and to hold the first festival sometime next year.
   Carlson said Miss Ball and her husband, Gary Morton, had
reviewed plans for the festival and were excited about the project.
   Miss Ball died of a ruptured aorta April 26 while recovering
from earlier emergency heart surgery.
   She was born Aug. 6, 1911, in Jamestown, about 60 miles south of
Buffalo, and grew up in nearby Celoron. She went on to star in
movies and the television series ``I Love Lucy.''
   Although Miss Ball had not visited the community since 1956, she
kept in touch with childhood friends and supported local causes.

   Eight Palestinians were
reported killed Friday and a soldier was slain in the first
encounter with armed guerrillas of the 17-month-old uprising
against Israeli occupation.
   The deaths brought to 492 the number of Palestinians killed
since the rebellion began Dec. 8, 1987. Twenty-two Israelis have
been killed, including six other soldiers.
   It was the highest death toll since April 16, 1988, when 14
Palestinians died in a day of widespread clashes after the
assassination in Tunis of Khalil Wazir, the PLO military chief
known as Abu Jihad.
   The army sergeant and three members of a guerrilla squad were
killed by a grenade blast and automatic weapons fire in Beit Aula,
an isolated mountain village in the West Bank, the army said. A
lieutenant colonel was seriously wounded and six other soldiers
were slightly or moderately wounded, it said.
   Maj. Gen. Amram Mitzna, the West Bank commander, said the
Palestinians were wanted for attacking Palestinians suspected of
collaborating with Israel and killing one. The Fatah-Uprising Group
led by Abu Mousa issued a statement in Damascus, Syria, saying the
guerrillas were its members.
   In the occupied Gaza Strip, Israeli troops killed five
Palestinians and wounded at least 11 in clashes with stone throwers
at the Rafah and Jebalya refugee camps, Arab hospital officials
said.
   They said those killed were a youth of 17 at Jebalya; the dead
at Rafah were a 50-year-old woman, and men aged 20, 22 and 30.
   Arab reporters said the trouble started when residents went out
to buy food in defiance of curfew. They said the camp has been
under curfew for most of the past two weeks.
   Ten Palestinians were reported wounded in confrontations with
soldiers elsewhere in the West Bank and Gaza.
   Soldiers renewed a curfew Friday on all 700,000 residents of the
Gaza Strip and Arab reports said more than 100 Palestinian
activists were arrested. Gaza had been under curfew since Monday,
but the order was lifted Thursday in some areas.
   Among those reported arrested was Sheik Ahmed Yassin, 52,
spiritual leader of the Moslem fundamentalist group Hamas. The
organization, whose name means zeal in Arabic, is among the
uprising's main coordinators.
   An army spokesman said grenade shrapnel killed Sgt. Itzhak
Revah, 25, and critically wounded Lt. Col. David Valkad at Beit
Aula.
   He said the Palestinians fired automatic weapons and threw a
grenade during the battle in the village 15 miles southwest of
Jerusalem. Soldiers sealed the area, stopping foreign journalists
at the nearby village of Halhoul.
   Israel radio said soldiers later blew up the homes of the three
guerrillas slain in the encounter. It said the houses were in Idna
and Nuba, villages nearby.
   Earlier Friday, the army said it demolished the homes of two
other Palestinians accused of attacking soldiers Surif, a West Bank
village.
   The battle in Beit Aula began after an alleged collaborator from
Nuba called the army, said Palestinians were firing at his house
and asked for help, Mitzna said. The general said soldiers
responding to the call passed through Beit Aula and ``unexpectedly
met a suspect car.''
   ``There was a chase and (the soldiers) opened fire,'' he told
reporters. ``The result was three of the group were killed and one
of our soldiers was killed, and another one was wounded very
seriously.''
   Revah was the first soldier killed in a gun battle since the
uprising began. Underground leaders of the uprising have urged
Palestinians not to use guns.
   Maj. Zeev Erlich, 35, who was hospitalized with shrapnel wounds
in the legs, said some of the soldiers were hit by automatic
weapons fire.
   ``When their car stopped ... we approached and fired on the
three,'' he said.
   ``At a certain stage, after they already laid on the ground and
we were done firing on them, apparently one of them fired a
grenade. The grenade exploded behind me and several others. It hurt
us in the back with shrapnel.'' Another soldier, identified only as
Capt. Rafi, said on Israel radio: ``I was in a vehicle behind the
lead jeep. I opened fire ... and shot the terrorist in the front
seat. I saw another terrorist in the back seat holding an M-16
rifle who was also firing. I reloaded and continued firing.''

   Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe Arens urged the
United States Friday to promote his government's peace initiative
and to head an international fund-raising drive for $2 billion to
rehabilitate Palestinian refugees in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   U.S. officials said that although the United States will do what
it can, many questions remain about the Israeli proposals and the
next steps must be up to the Israelis and Palestinians themselves.
   Arens presented his government's newly adopted four-point
initiative to Vice President Dan Quayle after discussing it a day
earlier with Secretary of State James A. Baker III.
   Quayle ``endorsed the plan in principle but said he wanted to
hear more details,'' said vice presidential spokesman David
Beckwith. The spokesman said Arens and Quayle did not discuss the
fund-raising request or specifics of the Israeli proposal to hold
elections among the 1.7 million Palestinians of the occupied West
Bank and Gaza.
   Arens reiterated Friday that he had sought to convince Baker and
other U.S. officials that details of the plan, being sought by the
United States and Arab countries, should be discussed only once its
implementation begins.
   Discussing details endangers acceptance of the plan, he said.
The United States can assure its allies that regardless of the
details, Israel accepts the principle that there must be free and
democratic elections, he said. ``Israel is not Panama and Shamir is
not (Panamanian Gen. Manuel Antonio) Noriega,'' Arens said.
   ``I hope I was successful in convincing my interlocuters here''
of that view, he added.
   The important thing now is for the United States to fully
endorse the proposal in principle and push for its acceptance with
Arab and non-Arab states, Arens told reporters.
   ``We feel it's now the turn of the United States at bat to
declare wholehearted and unreserved support for this initiative,''
Arens said.
   But Baker told Arens that while the United States ``would
continue our efforts'' to advance peace, ``we believe that the
parties must bear the major responsibility to ensure movement
forward in the process,'' said State Department spokesman Richard
Boucher.
   ``Much work needs to be done, but this proposal is certainly a
good start in the right direction,'' he added.
   Boucher declined to discuss elements of the plan, which includes
the rehabilitation of some 300,000 Palestinians living in refugee
camps.
   The United States views the elections as the centerpiece of the
Israeli plan. But Arens appeared to be trying to shift some of the
emphasis away from the controversial election proposal to the
rehabilitation idea.
   Arens said he had brought a letter from Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir to President Bush asking the United States to spearhead an
international campaign to raise an estimated $2 billion to provide
new housing, education and jobs for the Palestinian refugees.
   Israel has also raised the refugee rehabilitation proposal with
Japan and Arens will ask the European Economic Community for its
help when he meets with the group in Brussels next week, he said.
Oil-rich Arab states, which in the past have refused to provide
financing for such projects, could also take part if they want, he
added.
   Arens said he views the rehabilitation plan as a concrete
response to the frustrations that spawned an 18-month Palestinian
uprising, in which almost 500 Palestinians have been killed.
   The proposed elections would let Palestinians elect
representatives who would negotiate with the Israelis for self-rule.
   But the proposal does not answer some of the question which the
Arabs view as most pressing, such as whether the PLO will be given
a role in elections and whether international supervision will be
allowed.

   The Agriculture Department attempted Friday to
answer that not-so-ancient question: which comes first, chicken or
beef? There's a bone of contention.
   Forecasts have put U.S. per capita beef consumption at the
lowest level since the early 1960s. Poultry consumption, which was
less than half of beef in 1966, is expected to rival beef this year.
   Not necessarily true, says USDA economist Judith Putnam in a new
issue of National Food Review, quarterly magazine published by the
department's Economic Research Service.
   For some years, statistics watchers have seen poultry
consumption overtake and then pass annual beef consumption by
American consumers. There have been many reasons, including prices,
shifts in diet preferences and health concerns about red meat.
   In 1987, it happened. For the first time, according to the
department, per capita consumption of poultry exceeded that of beef
_ 77.8 pounds to 73.4 pounds for the year.
   The gap widened even further in 1988, with total poultry
estimated at 80.3 pounds per capita against 72.7 pounds for beef.
And the forecast for 1989 shows poultry at 84.4 pounds and beef at
69.9 pounds.
   But those estimates are on the basis of retail cuts, Putnam
said. And those include bones. Take away the bones and the figures
change.
   According to the boneless basis shown in her report, beef has
never lost the lead in the annual race for first place in the
palates of consumers. In 1987, for example, boneless beef led
boneless poultry _ which includes chicken and turkey _ by 69.2
pounds to 55.3 pounds.
   Last year, beef led poultry 68.6 pounds to 57.1 pounds per
capita, and the outlook for 1989 is beef leading poultry 65.9 to 60
pounds.
   Regardless of how its sliced, boned or not, the figures do show
something else: per capita consumption of poultry is increasing
while beef is declining.
   Total red meat consumption is something else. At an expected
135.4 pounds of retail weight, per capita consumption of beef,
veal, lamb and pork, leads total poultry's 84.4 pounds. On a
boneless basis, red meat is expected to be ahead 112.4 to 60 pounds.
   Per capita consumption of fish and shell fish, without bones,
was put at 15.4 pounds in 1989, unchanged since 1986. No boneless
figures for fish were included.

   The U.S. and West German governments ``made
progress'' toward bridging their differences in two days of talks
over NATO short-range nuclear missiles, West German Defense
Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said today.
   ``The overall discussions were very, very encouraging,''
Stoltenberg said after concluding a second round of meetings with
Secretary of State James A. Baker III and before a session with
Vice President Dan Quayle.
   The defense minister declined to go into detail on whether the
two sides had reached agreement until he reports back to his
government in Bonn, but as he sat down to talks with Quayle, he
said:
   ``We work for a common position, so we have to argue and try to
come together. And we made progress.''
   Baker and Stoltenberg were working towards a ``gentleman's
agreement'' on the missile dilemma prior to a critical NATO meeting
in Brussels, but no final accord was due, and the U.S.-German
discussions were expected to continue next week, said a diplomatic
source close to the discussions.
   After their talks Baker left for President Bush's retreat in
Kennebunkport, Maine, for meetings touching on the NATO problem and
sessions with French President Francois Mitterrand on Saturday.
   The defense minister, after the meeting with Quayle, was
returning to Bonn for talks Sunday with Chancellor Helmut Kohl, the
diplomatic source said.
   The State Department meeting, the second in as many days between
Baker and Stoltenberg, took place as a senior government source in
Bonn reported the two sides had reached a compromise on the knotty
problem.
   The U.S. government has agreed to support the concept of
negotiations to reduce short-range missiles based in Europe in
return for West German assurances at next week's NATO summit that
the talks would not be aimed at total elimination of those weapons,
the source said.
   The government official said West Germany would go along with
the rest of the alliance at its May 29-30 summit on a statement of
unity that would make it clear NATO does not yet seek the
elimination of short-range nuclear weapons, only reductions.
   The short-range upgrade project, known as ``modernization,'' has
been shelved until at least 1991, the official said.
   The diplomatic source, who spoke on condition he not be named,
said Stoltenberg's aim was to indicate a ``new flexibility'' on
Bonn's part and sound the American side out about the timing of
possible U.S.-Soviet negotiations involving the short-range weapons.
   The United States has steadfastly balked at the notion of
starting such talks, fearing they could lead to stripping Europe of
all short-range nuclear weapons and leave the West vulnerable to
the superior conventional Warsaw Pact forces.
   Stoltenberg was to suggest a possible link between a reduction
of Soviet conventional forces in Europe with the start of
negotiations on reducing the number of short-range nuclear weapons.
The negotiations might not begin until there is ``significant
progress'' toward reductions by the Soviets and its allies, said
the diplomatic source.
   One proposal would be to form a high-level NATO study group,
which would define the ``significant progress'' necessary before
any U.S.-Soviet talks on short-range missiles could convene, the
source said.
   An administration official, speaking on the condition he not be
identified, said the West German proposals would be studied closely.
   ``We'll take a look at what they're trying to sell. But what do
they mean by significant progress? We have to define it,'' the
official said.
   The West Germans also oppose a U.S.-British effort to more than
triple the range of existing Lance missiles to just below 300
miles. The U.S.-built Lance now can hit targets from about 75
miles, and most of the 88 launchers and 700 single-warhead missiles
are based in West Germany.
   That opposition stems from the fact that the Lance is designed
for battlefield use, and if fired from a launcher in West Germany
most probably would strike East and West German territory.
   A group of West German parliament members visiting Washington
shared Stoltenberg's prediction that some agreement in the missile
dispute will be reached prior to the NATO summit.
   ``There's a new flexibility on both sides. The chances we will
reach an agreement are not 100 percent, but given the political
will, there's a good chance we will reach an agreement,'' said
Volcker Ruehe, the deputy majority leader in parliament, in a
meeting with reporters.
   Ruehe and three other parliament members said they were pleased
with the reception they received from officials the State
Department, the National Security Council and on Capitol Hill
during their three-day visit.
   As for U.S. opposition to any negotiations on the short-range
weapons, Ruehe said he'd ``never met anybody who's said they'd
never negotiate (on short-range weapons). ... The question is the
speed of the negotiations.''
   In any case, Ruehe said the West German could not make any
decisions about deploying a modernized version of the weapons until
after Kohl's government faces national elections in the fall of
1990.

<HEAD>Top Commission Finds Evidence of `Gross' Abuses of Power</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK J. PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A top-level commission Friday found evidence of
``gross violations'' of law by two anti-corruption crusaders and
turned them over to the national prosecutor's office for
investigation.
   The report by a commission that included Minister of Justice
Alexander Sukharev and KGB chief Vladimir Kruchkov brought to a
head the dispute that started a week ago when one of the
investigators said the names of Politburo member Yegor K. Ligachev
and other top officials had come up in their inquiry.
   ``This kind of accusation, not based on any kind of objective
evidence, is a gross violation of the honor and dignity of the
individuals, which is protected by law,'' said the commission,
which was formed by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, the
country's highest executive body.
   It said complaints and evidence from defendants as well as other
investigators and government officials accused investigators Telman
Gdlyan and Nikolai Ivanov of threatening defendants, inducing them
to implicate others, arresting their relatives without evidence,
holding suspects for months without questioning or charges, and
carelessly handling valuables the seized.
   The commission said accusations against Gdlyan and Ivanov ``have
a serious basis.''
   It said it was acting on accusations made by the KGB, the
Justice Ministry, the Supreme Court and other top national bodies.
   Gdlyan has been removed as head of an investigation of
corruption in the republic of Uzbekistan that he has headed since
September 1983, and the accusations were turned over to the Soviet
Procurator General's Office for ``careful verification,'' it said.
   Ivanov said in a pre-election debate broadcast May 5 on
Leningrad TV that the names of Ligachev, former Politburo member
Mikhail S. Solomentsev and other top officials had come up in his
corruption investigation. Two days later, he won 61 percent of the
vote in a race with more than two dozen candidates for a
parliamentary seat representing all of Moscow.
   Ligachev and Solomentsev released statements denying any
wrongdoing and labelling Ivanov's statement a political
provocation. They demanded an investigation of the claims be
carried out, and that the results be made public.
   Ligachev is considered by many a conservative counterforce to
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev on the Politburo and a potential
rival to the Soviet leader. He is particularly unpopular among
radical reformers. Solomentsev retired from the Politburo in
September.
   Gdlyan won a parliamentary seat March 26 with about 87 percent
of the vote in a Moscow district. Both men have become famous
throughout the country for their investigation of corruption in
Uzbekistan that led to convictions of top local officials and led
to Yuri Churbanov, the son-in-law of former President Leonid I.
Brezhnev.
   Churbanov was convicted of taking bribes in December and
sentenced to 12 year in a labor camp.
   The commission's statement was read on the evening TV news
program ``Vremya,'' ensuring that millions of Soviets would hear it.
   The investigators have said repeatedly they are trying to widen
their investigation to include corruption in the Kremlin itself,
but are running into resistance from highly placed officials.
   The commission accused them of ignoring the Uzbekistan
investigation. It said Gdlyan had been in Uzbekistan only three
days this year while Ivanov had not been there at all.
   It said that the investigators' ``accusatory style of work'' and
``provocative method of obtaining evidence'' had damaged President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's drive to strengthen the Soviet Union's
system of law.
   Gorbachev, a lawyer, has said respect for the law must be
increased to avoid the systematic disregard that characterized the
purges of the Stalin years.
   A popular editor on Wednesday likened the corruption crusade to
a Soviet version of the Watergate scandal.
   Gdlyan also is under scrutiny for his handling of an
investigation of a well-known Estonian scientist Johannes Hint, who
was jailed in 1983 on corruption charges and later died in jail.
   The Soviet Supreme Court this month vindicated Hint and several
other co-defendants, and told the Procurator General's Office to
review whether Gdlyan should keep his job as a top criminal
investigator.

<HEAD>Youngest Person on North Pole Wants to Inspire Harlem Kids</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EDITH M. LEDERER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The youngest person to walk to the North Pole said
Friday he wants to inspire kids in places like Harlem, where he
grew up, to believe in themselves and accomplish their dreams.
   Darryl Roberts suffered frostbite, blisters and pain for most of
the 56-day journey, but he said he never thought of giving up
``because I believe so much in being able to go back and tell these
kids the story _ hoping that it will inspire them.''
   Five days after he set foot _ or more appropriately skis _ on
the Pole, the 23-year-old instructor in outdoor education was in
balmy London with the seven other members of the Arctic team to
meet Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
   The group walked 480 miles from Cape Aldrich, the northernmost
point in Canada, and encountered huge ice walls, numerous cracks in
the ice and temperatures as low as minus 67.
   The message they delivered to Mrs. Thatcher is one Roberts said
he wants to get across to American youngsters: The pollution
dangers facing the arctic are symptomatic of environmental dangers
facing the world and young people must take responsibility for the
planet they will inherit.
   Roberts said, however, ``I think I have to start with helping
them to develop greater self-esteem, greater self-confidence,
because when you do that, you want better things around you and you
work toward that.''
   Wearing sandals because of a blister on his heel, and still
sporting a few patches of the frostbite, Roberts said he has
learned many things from the first international walk to the North
Pole.
   ``One of the things I learned is that regardless of language
barriers, skin color differences, cultural differences, when human
beings get together with a common goal in mind ... they can get
that thing done, regardless of how difficult the conditions,'' he
said.
   ``That's exactly what we wanted to prove to the world _ that
world powers like the Soviet Union and the United States can
cooperate.
   ``Let's not count how many more missiles the other guy's got.
Let's get together on some of these world pollution problems and
solve them because we can,'' he said.
   As a child in the New York City neighborhood of Harlem, Roberts
said, ``I always knew that there was something more outside of
where I was living.''
   Helped by an ambitious mother, he said, he was able to attend a
private high school. He spent a year at Northeastern University in
Boston studying engineering before dropping out to teach at Outward
Bound, an organization that offers wilderness experiences.
   British explorer Robert Swan, the expedition leader who became
the first person to walk to the North and South poles, said he
selected the young man because ``I wanted Darryl to represent a
group of youngsters in America who no one really seems to be able
to get through to and people that maybe have lost hope.''
   He said ``Darryl proved that you can do anything if you really
try and you keep going.''
   Roberts said it was Swan's enormous moral support and the
physical support of Soviet physician Mikhail Malachov that helped
him through an extremely difficult trip.
   What was his feeling when he finally reached the Pole?
   ``I was so relieved that ... I wouldn't have to feel the pain
anymore and I was almost wrapped in tears because my feet were
killing me,'' he said.
   ``Second was the elation that the entire team had gotten there
together ... and that was true to one of our objectives of
international cooperation.''
   When Roberts returns to New York next week, he hopes to start
lecturing and he would like to meet President Bush. But his future
still is uncertain.
   ``This was an incredible risk,'' he said. ``I think I'm going to
do something a little more relaxed from now on.''

<HEAD>Boren Advised White House Not to Name Gregg to Top CIA Post</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. David Boren, D-Okla., said Friday that he
advised the White House not to name Donald Gregg to a top CIA post
because ``he had become somewhat controversial during the
Iran-Contra hearings.''
   When George Bush was vice president, Gregg was his national
security adviser. President Bush has since nominated Gregg to
become U.S. ambassador to South Korea, and the nomination is stuck
in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
   Boren, chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said he
acted because he believed ``that the agency, because of the nature
of its work, did not need additional controversy at this time.''
   ``It in no way means that I feel that Mr. Gregg should be
automatically disqualified for other government positions,'' Boren
said.
   ``My personal opinion that he should not be named to a CIA post
was simply based upon my view that he had become somewhat
controversial during the Iran-Contra hearings,'' Boren said.
   Bush's nomination of Gregg to be ambassador to South Korea is
stalled in the Foreign Relations Committee because of Gregg's
relationships to key figures in the Iran-Contra affair.
   He also faces allegations that he may have been involved
personally in the illegal resupply of military aid to the
Nicaraguan Contra rebels at a time when that was forbidden by
Congress.
   Boren said his committee has never held formal discussions about
Gregg's qualifications to serve in any post in government.
   He added that Gregg's nomination as ambassador has not prompted
him to reopen the Iran-Contra investigation.
   ``No one should draw the conclusion that I would support the
reopening of the Iran-Contra investigation by the Congress on a
major scale,'' Boren said. ``The Congress has other problems to
confront. The Iran-Contra matter is now appropriately in the
courts.''
   Boren said that other than helping to resolve problems about
some of the documents related to the original congressional probe,
``I would personally be opposed to reopening the investigation on a
major scale and have to this point seen no evidence which would
justify it.''
   Boren said he is not privy to any information regarding Gregg
other than what already has been made public.
   Gregg's nomination is opposed by Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif.,
who has repeatedly asked the White House to withdraw it.
   Cranston has vowed to hold additional hearings to probe Gregg's
links to the Iran-Contra affair, warning that the results might be
embarrassing to both Gregg and the president.
   Cranston says he is considering calling other witnesses to
obtain their testimony under oath but has made no decisions.
   Gregg has told Senate supporters he had sought to be named to a
post for which Senate confirmation is needed in order to force the
issue, confront the suspicions about his role, and give himself an
oportunity to clear his name.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. and British embassies Friday
advised their citizens to leave Lebanon, and the leading Beirut
newspaper predicted a Syrian assault on the Christian enclave
defended by Gen. Michel Aoun's army units.
   The U.S. Embassy said it was ``not in a position to arrange
transportation of citizens from Lebanon,'' but Americans were
``strongly advised to depart Lebanon immediately ... because of the
threat posed by the security situation.''
   An American official at the embassy, speaking on condition he
not be named, said there were ``several hundred Americans in
Lebanon, most of them dual nationals.'' He refused to be more
specific.
   Sixteen embassy employees were evacuated to Cyprus on Feb. 17
during battles between Aoun and the Lebanese Forces, the main
Christian militia. That left about 25 in Lebanon.
   Christian radio stations broadcast a statement from the British
Embassy advising the 99 remaining Britons to leave Lebanon ``before
the sea shuttle service ... stops anew.''
   Ferry service between Lebanon and Cyprus, suspended during the
heaviest fighting of the past two months, resumed last week.
   Since March 8, Beirut has been devastated by artillery duels
between the Aoun forces and a Moslem alliance of Syrian troops and
Druse militiamen that have killed 359 people and wounded 1,393 by
police count. Most of the casualties have been civilians.
   The U.S. Embassy did not explain its timing, but the warning
coincided with a prediction by the daily An-Nahar that the Syrians
would attack to try to oust Aoun, who heads the Christian Cabinet
in Lebanon's divided government and commands about 20,000 men.
   Syria has 40,000 soldiers in Lebanon under a 1976 peacekeeping
mandate from the Arab League and has become the country's main
power broker during 14 years of civil war.
   A spokesman for Aoun's command said Christian troops were
exchanging machine gun fire and rocket-propelled grenades with
Syrians and their allies at Souk el-Gharb southeast of Beirut.
   No casualties were reported, but ``they fire on us and we fire
on them. This hasn't stopped despite the Arab League-sponsored
cease-fire,'' the spokesman said by telephone, on condition of
anonymity.
   An-Nahar analyst Sarkis Naaoum said Syria ``will not permit''
the Arab League to work out a settlement leaving Aoun in charge in
the 310-square-mile enclave north and east of Beirut where most of
Lebanon's Christians live.
   Repeated efforts by the Arab League to implement a truce it
called April 28 have failed, mainly because the Syrians and Druse
continue shelling the Christian coastline to keep Aoun from
receiving supplies by sea.
   Naaoum quoted ``information recently received in east Beirut,''
the Christian sector, in saying Syria also ``would not allow the
emergency Arab summit conference, due in Morocco next week, to
become an arena for confronting its policy in Lebanon or
criticizing it.''
   ``The practical translation of these two Syrian stands would be
a serious military escalation different in power and size from the
flareup recently experienced,'' the analyst wrote. ``The main aim
of the operation would be to bring Aoun down, either by
overthrowing him or by forcing him to step down.'' He said Syria's
plan included ``destructive bombardment'' of military facilities in
the Christian enclave and a major offensive by its own soldiers or
militia allies.
   Aoun's troops and the Lebanese Forces militia would unite
against such an offensive, said Naaoum, a well-connected analyst
whose columns usually are taken seriously by Arab and Western
diplomats.
   As he described the military plan, the main assault would be
directed at Aoun's heavily fortified lines in Souk el-Gharb, seven
miles southeast of Beirut.
   The strategically located mountain resort commands a network of
mountain roads leading to the presidential palace at Baabda. Aoun
and his family have lived in the palace since President Amin
Gemayel, at the end of his six-year term last September, appointed
the general to lead a Christian government.
   Gemayel acted when Parliament could not agree on a successor.
Moslems swore allegiance to Salim Hoss, a Sunni Moslem who was
premier under Gemayel, and the army also split into Christian and
Moslem commands.
   An-Nahar and other Lebanese newspapers reported earlier in the
week that two Syrian MiG-17 jet fighters flew low over the
Christian enclave Monday on an apparent reconnaissance mission.

   Senators made extra money last year selling
hay, pitching jokes, collecting pensions, writing books and making
speeches _ lots of speeches. But none had to rely solely on a
Senate salary.
   According to financial disclosure statements made public Friday,
perhaps one-third of the 100 senators are millionaires and most
others are wealthy.
   Most have impressive investments.
   And most routinely accepted speaking fees and travel
reimbursements from special-interest groups.
   Here's how some senators supplemented their $89,500 Senate
paychecks last year:
   _Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., earned $15,000 as a lecturer at C.W.
Post College in Long Island, N.Y.
   _Donald Riegle, D-Mich., made 21 speeches at $1,000 apiece to
Washington Campus, a nonprofit educational organization that
conducts seminars.
   _Paul Simon, D-Ill., reported $3,042 in residuals from four
appearances on ``Saturday Night Live.''
   _Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, grossed $65,000 from five farms but
after subtracting expenses was left with only $6,000.
   _Dale Bumpers, D-Ark., reaped $1,760 selling hay off his farm.
   _Bennett Johnston, D-La., who heads the Senate Energy Committee,
pocketed $377 in oil-well royalties.
   _Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell, D-Maine, earned
$22,500 in royalties from ``Men of Zeal,'' a book he wrote with his
Maine colleague, Republican Sen. William Cohen, which reflected
their service on the Senate committee that investigated the
Iran-Contra affair.
   _Cohen listed $25,763 in royalties, including some still coming
in from a novel he co-authored with ex-Sen. Gary Hart.
   _Alan Cranston, D-Calif., received $62,906 in pension from his
service as a California state official and $18,246 in Social
Security benefits.
   _Robert Kerrey, D-Neb., who lost a leg in the Vietnam war,
reported $18,972 from a Navy pension.
   Almost all the 95 senators who filed the required statements
(five were granted extensions) reported receiving honoraria _ which
usually were fees for making speeches to schools, churches and
special-interest groups.
   Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, listed $46,950 in such fees, including $10,000 from
elements of the defense industry. Under the rules, he could keep
only $35,800, so he gave $11,686 to charity.
   Richard Lugar of Indiana, senior Republican on the Agriculture
Committee and former chairman of Foreign Relations, picked up
$72,950 for speaking and turned over $37,189 to charity. His
audiences ranged from the National Pork Producers Council to the
National Association of Arab Americans.
   Wendell Ford of Kentucky, a senior member of the Commerce
Committee, reported $28,500 for speeches, many of them to regulated
groups, including the alcohol and tobacco industries that are
economic powers in his home state.
   Jake Garn, R-Utah, former chairman of the Banking Committee, was
a favorite speaker at financial and banking meetings. He was paid
$37,700 and gave $2,000 to charity.
   Tom Daschle, D-S.D., a freshman who serves on the Finance
Committee, accepted five expense-paid trips, four of them with his
wife. They included stops in Puerto Rico, in Louisville for the
Kentucky Derby, in Fort Lauderdale and Miami.
   Jesse Helms, R-N.C., and his wife accepted a free five-day trip
to Paris in connection with American Airlines' launching non-stop
service from Nashville to Paris.
   Wyche Fowler, D-Ga., was reimbursed by non-government interests
for trips to Cuba, San Francisco and Fayetteville, Ark.
   Not everything senators touched turned to gold last year.
Freshman Herbert Kohl, a multimillionaire, did well with his bakery
stock but his Milwaukee Bucks National Basketball Association
franchise lost $95,000, although it generated revenues of $12.1
million.
   In most cases, it is next to impossible to tell a senator's
financial condition from the disclosure statements. Items of
income, assets and liabilities are listed in broad brackets. Thus,
$6,000 interest earned shows up with a value of $5,001 to $15,000.
A $10 million gain from a property sale would be listed only as
worth $250,001 and up.
   Some of the wealthiest senators have assets in trusts. So, the
statement of Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., gives no clue that he has
an interest in trusts worth tens of millions of dollars. He has no
liabilities.
   Similarly, the extensive wealth of Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va., is
tied up in trusts.
   When trusts are excluded, Kohl could be the richest senator,
with assets of up to nearly $28 million and liabilities of less
than $2 million. John C. Danforth, R-Mo., whose grandfather founded
Ralston Purina, lists assets of up to $13 million and no
liabilities.
   John Heinz, R-Pa., whose family started and still owns a large
block of H.J. Heinz Co., the ketchup-and-pickle giant, reported
assets of at least $11.2 million and perhaps $13.6 million, with
liabilities of about $1 million.
   Nancy L. Kassebaum, R-Kan., who owns real estate and a Wichita
radio station, listed assets of up to $4 million with maximum
liabilities of under $1.5 million.
   Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., one of the poorer members, said she
owns shares in a gold fund, but took pains to add the fund has no
investments in South Africa.
   Gifts worth nearly $5,000 were reported by Republican Leader Bob
Dole of Kansas. They included seven lithographs, a dozen silk ties
worth $240, a hand-tailored suit valued at $600, two cases of
champagne worth $888 and a $200 pencil drawing of himself.
   Phil Gramm, R-Texas, reported receiving a gift of steaks worth
$240. Simon, the Illinois senator whose bowtie is a trademark,
accepted a bowtie quilt of unknown value. Carl Levin, D-Mich., said
his wife won two airline tickets worth $1,858 in a raffle. Arlen
Specter, R-Pa., said his assets include a 1976 Jaguar, which he
valued at under $5,000.
   Among the assets listed by Pete Domenici, R-N.M.: a mausoleum
crypt worth less than $5,000.

   Two former television news executives
apologized publicly and were sentenced to probation Friday after
pleading no contest to breaking into computer news files of a
competing station in what a prosecutor called the first case of its
kind.
   Hillsborough Circuit Judge Edward Ward agreed to withhold a
finding of guilt if Terry Cole and Michael Shapiro successfully
complete five years' probation and 250 hours of community service.
   During probation, the former employees of WTSP must take part in
annual industry seminars to warn others, especially journalism
students, how to ``avoid the pitfalls of a tremendous desire to
succeed.''
   Cole and Shapiro, both 33, expressed remorse for raiding the
files of CBS affiliate WTVT between last November and January. At
the time, Cole was news director at the ABC affiliate and Shapiro
was assistant news director.
   Before switching to WTSP, Shapiro had been an assignment manager
at WTVT and helped set up security for that station's newsroom
computer, including passwords and identification codes.
   To gain a competitive edge, prosecutors said, the pair broke
into WTVT's computer files containing stories, budgets, contracts
and plans of news operations.
   Shapiro was arrested in February, and Cole, his boss, was
arrested in April. Both men subsequently were fired by WTSP.
   The judge said the case involved a violation of trust and
confidence and crossed the line on ethics.
   ``The court is not going to close any more doors in your face,''
Ward said. ``I feel you men have earned a chance ... to have
society attempt to forgive you.''
   The judge sentenced each to one year probation on a single
conspiracy count and five years on 15 other computer-related theft
charges. He ordered the terms to run concurrently.
   Ward followed state sentencing guidelines but warned the
defendants, both first-time offenders, that he had the right to
exceed the guidelines and send them to prison for 22 months.
   Assistant State Attorney Chris Hoyer said it was the first
computer theft case involving the news business that he knew of in
the country.
   ``They knew what they were doing,'' Hoyer said at the 90-minute
hearing.
   Shapiro said: ``I'm extremely sorry about what happened. People
were hurt by it at the stations. My career has been ended. ... I
accept responsiblity.''
   ``I made a mistake,'' Cole said. ``I allowed something to happen
that should not have happened. I've ruined my career. I've lost the
respect of my colleagues. ... I don't know what else to say except
I'm sorry.''
   Greg Jones, a WTVT attorney, said the proceedings ``ought to
send a pretty clear message to anyone who thinks it makes sense to
compete by cheating.''
   He would not comment on the prospect of a civil suit.

<HEAD>Collapse of Agreement on Mail-Order Tax Measure Triggers Dispute</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An agreement among lobbyists for state and
local governments on a bill allowing sales taxes to be collected
from mail-order buyers has collapsed, triggering a sharp dispute
Friday among groups representing the nation's mayors and governors.
   At issue is the bill sponsored by Rep. Jack Brooks, D-Texas,
chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, that would override a
22-year-old Supreme Court decision that permits customers to escape
sales taxes on purchases from big out-of-state mail order houses.
   Groups representing local governments want the bill to include
provisions guaranteeing that states, which would collect the taxes
from the mail-order retailers, will pass along a portion to cities
and counties _ $436 million or more a year out of an estimated $2.4
billion in currently uncollected taxes, according to one estimate.
   But Brooks' bill leaves it to the states to decide whether and
how to pass on money to local governments. And the head of the U.S.
Conference of Mayors angrily charged that the National Governors'
Association had reneged on a signed agreement and agreed to cut the
cities out of the bill.
   ``This is not just a simple little quarrel,'' said J. Thomas
Cochran, executive director of the conference, which represents
mayors of cities of more than 30,000 in population. Instead,
Cochran said, the dispute ``goes to whether or not organizations
will hold their word.''
   ``This is almost personal with me,'' Cochran said. ``I don't
think they think they need us. The governors' association has taken
us for granted for eight years under the Reagan administration.''
   ``This was not just an informal agreement or a bunch of the boys
getting together over drinks,'' he said. ``When we have an
agreement in this town, it must be kept. That's taken seriously in
this town. ... We had a written agreement signed off by elected
officials.''
   Ray Scheppach, executive director of the National Governors'
Association, acknowledged the bill does not match the agreement but
said most states would act on their own to pass along a portion to
cover local sales taxes, if Brooks' bill is passed.
   He said the mayors' position was ``a little bit naive.''
   ``To walk away when you don't get 100 percent of what you want
from word go, I think, is rather unsophisticated,'' he said.
   The agreement was reached last year by the mayors' and
governors' groups, the National Conference of State Legislatures
and two other groups representing elected municipal and county
officials, after Brooks had asked for unanimity among the
government lobbying groups.
   Brooks issued a statement Friday saying his bill was written to
impose ``a minimum of requirements'' and ``flexibility.''
   When Brooks introduced his bill earlier this month, Cochran
wrote to the nation's mayors complaining. ``It is quite simply an
outrage,'' he wrote.
   Cochran called reporters to his office Friday to denounce the
bill and said he was angered by reports quoting anonymous state
officials as saying the mayors were being ``crybabies'' over the
deal. He said the opposition of the mayors would jeopardize the
bill.
   However, Scheppach and a source on Brooks' committee staff, who
insisted on anonymity, expressed doubt the mayors would kill the
bill.
   The real impetus for the bill, they said, comes from retailers
who object to the discount that mail-order competitors are able to
offer consumers by avoiding state and local sales taxes.

   Tiananmen Square, the symbolic center of power in
China, remained the heart of pro-democracy protests Saturday
despite the mobilization of troops to restore order.
   Before dawn Friday, Premier Li Peng and Communist Party chief
Zhao Ziyang visited some of the more than 3,000 students who have
been on a hunger strike in the vast square for a week.
   Li and Zhao boarded two of the several dozen buses parked on the
100-acre square that have sheltered the fasting students. After a
short visit, the leaders left without promising to meet demands the
students have raised for ending the strike, such as an official
dialogue with communist officials broadcast live on TV.
   Throughout the day, student leaders debated their next move.
Ambulances with sirens wailing raced out of the square to take
failing fasters to hospitals for treatment. Rumors of troop
movements swirled through the crowd.
   Tens of thousands of other students, some from provinces as far
away as Inner Mongolia, camped in solidarity with the fasters. Many
wore white headbands and armbands with slogans of support.
   The square was filthy from a week of occupation, with garbage
was piled high in several places and broken bottles strewn across
Tiananmen's stone tiles. Hygiene crews spraying disinfectant wound
through the crowd.
   Trucks carrying banner-waving workers and students constantly
lumbered down the streets surrounding Tiananmen. Other groups
marched through the square to support the fasters.
   By evening, student leaders decided to stay in the square but
stop the hunger strike. The fasting students descended from the
buses, carrying dirty quilts and blankets under their arms, and sat
down nearby.
   About 9:30 p.m., the square's official loudspeaker system began
broadcasting speeches of Li and President Yang Shangkun, who
revealed troops were moved to Beijing to restore order, drowning
out rival student broadcasts.
   Large groups gathered around the dozens of speakers, listening
in the eerie light cast by the square's lampposts. They
occasionally jeered Li and angrily shouted obscenities.
   As the speeches were rebroadcast, the students defiantly sang
the ``Internationale,'' the socialist anthem. The incensed strike
leaders, speaking from a bus _ their makeshift headquarters _
immediately announced the hunger strike would resume and claimed
all students in the square would participate.
   Human chains began forming around the perimeter of the square to
act as a line of defense against any troops. Trucks filled with
supporting workers raced down Beijing's streets toward Tiananmen
early Saturday, and a pack of up to 100 motorcylcists also roared
by.
   As the tension mounted, students remained defiant. ``I'm not
afraid to die,'' shouted one hunger striker who vowed not to eat
until the student demands were met.

<HEAD>Wall St. Experts Say Bush Plan Full of Costly `Window Dressing'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wall Street financial experts on Friday called
President Bush's savings and loan bailout plan a ``banana
republic'' scheme that will cost taxpayers $30 billion to $50
billion more than a Democratic alternative.
   A special task force of the House Budget Committee was told the
extra expense of paying for the bailout through 30-year, off-budget
bonds to preserve the illusion of deficit reduction will likely be
10 times the $3.8 billion to $4.5 billion the administration has
acknowledged.
   ``This is an incredible price to pay for budgetary window
dressing,'' said Bert Ely, who heads a financial consulting firm in
Alexandria, Va. ``Billions of dollars can be saved if the cleanup
is funded for a few years with short-term borrowings until
long-term rates decline.''
   Comptroller General Charles Bowsher, head of the government's
General Accounting Office, agreed with Ely and representatives of
Wall Street investment houses that Bush's S&amp;L plan will tax the
public tens of billions of dollars in unnecessary interest costs.
   The administration has acknowledged taxpayers will have to pay
up to $4.5 billion more over the 30-year life of the private bonds
than if the bailout costs were borrowed directly through the
Treasury.
   Ely, however, estimated that the extra cost of Bush's plan at
$49.7 billion over 30 years, assuming the administration is right
in its assertion that interest rates will drop by more than half
between now and 1995.
   Bush's strategy, he said, ``makes sense only if one believes
that long-term interest rates are at or near their low point.''
   David Jones, chief economist for Aubrey G. Lanston &amp; Co., said
there has been a ``substantial underestimation of the added costs''
in Bush's financing plan.
   Because of the yearly federal deficits, he said, the Treasury
still will have to annually borrow through additional securities
most of the estimated $5 billion in yearly interest payments on the
bonds.
   ``These interest payments, of course, will grow exponentially
over time as long as the federal budget remains in deficit,'' Jones
said.
   If long-term interest rates average a ``more realistic'' 8
percent, he said, the added expense of Bush's plan compared to the
one approved Thursday by the House Ways and Means Committee is
$28.3 billion.
   ``As I was making the calculations, the term banana republic
came up,'' he said. ``There's not much difference (between that and
the United States) if you have to borrow money to pay interest on
debt. That's a sad fiscal state to be in.''
   The task force's hearing was held one day after the House Ways
and Means Committee rejected Bush's proposal and formally voted to
finance the bailout directly and make the $50 billion taxpayer part
of the federal deficit.
   Bush's plan would increase the deficit over the next three years
by only the $3.5 billion in interest costs on the bonds. The
Democratic alternative would swell the deficit by $9.3 billion this
year, $23.3 billion in fisal 1990 and $13.8 billion in fiscal 1991
through direct Treasury borrowing but with lower long-term interest
costs to taxpayers.

   Iran is suing the United States in
the World Court for financial compensation for the 290 people
killed when the USS Vincennes shot down an Iranian airliner, a
court official said Friday.
   Tehran's move came less than a year after the Iran Air jet was
hit by two American missiles and exploded thousands of feet above
the Persian Gulf. All passengers and crew perished in the July 3,
1988, incident.
   Iran's fundamentalist government has asked the court to rule
that ``the government of the United States is responsible to pay
compensation to the Islamic Republic, to the amount to be
determined by the court, as measured by the injuries suffered by
the Islamic Republic and the bereaved families.''
   A copy of Iran's request, which was filed Wednesday, was
obtained by The Associated Press.
   Iran did not provide an estimate of the damage suffered,
according to E. Safavi, a spokesman for the Iranian Embassy in The
Hague.
   At the time of the incident, President Reagan offered
compensation to relatives of the victims, but he ruled out any role
for the Iranian government in settling damage claims.
   It was not immediately known whether the Bush Administration was
planning to take part in the proceedings.
   Thomas Hodges, a spokesman for the U.S. Embassy here, said, ``A
copy of the Iranian application was sent to the secretary of state
in Washington where it is being studied.'' He declined further
comment.
   On Friday, the World Court was considering when to proceed with
the case. Hearings do not begin until arguments have been filed in
writing _ a process that usually takes months.
   The World Court is the judicial branch of the United Nations.
Officially known as the International Court of Justice, it has no
enforcement powers and depends on voluntary adherence to its
rulings.
   The crew of the Vincennes erroneously identified an Iranian
passenger Airbus plane as an Iranian air force F-14 fighter plane
and shot it down.
   Iran's application to the World Court charges the United States
has violated an international treaty on terrorism against airplanes
_ the 1971 Geneva Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts
Against the Safety of Civil Aviation.
   It is the second case in a decade pitting the United States
against Iran at the World Court.
   Ten years ago, the Carter administration filed suit against Iran
over the fate of 55 American diplomats held hostage at the U.S.
Embassy in Tehran _ the affair which made Washington break
relations with Tehran.
   Iran, which did not appear in court, was ordered to immediately
release the hostages. Tehran ignored the ruling. The hostages
ultimately were freed in January 1980 after an elaborate deal was
negotiated with the help of Algeria.
   The United States withdrew from proceedings in the other major
World Court case in which it was involved in 1984, when Nicaragua
sought a halt to U.S. support for the rebels known as Contras.
   Only days before the complaint was filed, the Reagan
administration canceled its acceptance of World Court jurisdiction
in Central American affairs. The court sided with the Sandinista
government two years later.
   Only 49 of the 159 U.N. member nations have accepted the court's
authority as compulsory in settling conflicts between states. The
United States is one of them.

   The Navy declined Friday to say whether
sabotage is under investigation as a possible cause of the April 19
explosion on the battleship Iowa that killed 47 sailors.
   A Virginia newspaper reported that foul play was being looked
into after the sister of a crewman who was killed told authorities
that her brother and a surviving sailor had taken out life
insurance policies naming each other as beneficiary.
   Both policies, taken out more than a year ago, were for $50,000,
with a double-indemnity clause in case of accidental death, the
sister told the Virginian-Pilot and The Ledger-Star of Norfolk. The
newspaper said the sister spoke on condition that her and her
brother's names not be disclosed.
   Officials contacted by the newspaper confirmed that the NIS and
the FBI were questioning the beneficiary.
   But a Navy spokesman at the Pentagon, Lt. Bruce Cole, said
Friday that he had no details on what the NIS was looking into and
did not know if sabotage was a target of the investigation.
   ``In every large accident investigation such as this, it's
standard procedure to ask the Naval Investigative Service to assist
in exploring every possible avenue which might lead to further
understanding of the causes and circumstances of the tragedy,''
Cole said.
   The newspaper also reported that Navy investigators have learned
that the No. 2 gun turret where the explosion occurred was
significantly undermanned and that a number of those working in the
turret lacked required training.
   The turret, one of three on the 887-foot ship, had far fewer
crew members assigned than either of the other two, despite
recommendations from the Iowa's gunnery officer two months before
the explosion that the numbers be increased, according to the
ship's battle bill obtained by the newspaper. The battle bill
defines the positions that are to be manned aboard a ship in
wartime conditions.
   The gun turret should have had 90 people inside to perform the
delicate work of moving gunpowder and shells, according to battle
bill. On the day of the explosion, 58 men were inside the turret.
   ``Normal peacetime ship manning levels are always less than
wartime manning,'' the Navy said in a statement Thursday.
   The newspaper quoted an unidentified senior officer as saying it
would be wrong to assume a link between the explosion and the
manning levels or training levels of those assigned to the turret.
   Some Iowa crewmen familiar with the Navy's investigation told
the newspaper taht a significant number of sailors assigned to
turret No. 2 were inexperienced and had not been qualified in the
equipment's use.
   A number lacked Personal Qualification Standards, or PQS
ratings, a set of requirements that a sailor must complete before
being qualified to stand watch, repair equipment or advance in rank.
   But some of the 11 survivors pointed out that their turret was
rated the best of the three on the ship. The Iowa's commanding
officer, Capt. Fred P. Moosally, has said that the crew of No. 2
turret was his best.
   The explosion occurred during the loading of the center 16-inch
gun as the Iowa was preparing for gunnery practice north of Puerto
Rico.

   Premier Ciriaco De Mita resigned Friday in response
to sniping by Socialist Party rivals in his coalition, creating one
of Italy's periodic government crises a week before President Bush
visits.
   Negotiations to form what would be Italy's 49th postwar
government are expected to take weeks. President Francesco Cossiga
asked De Mita, a Christian Democrat, to stay on as caretaker.
   After giving Cossiga his resignation, De Mita told reporters the
Socialists left him no alternative to resigning.
   Bush is to arrive May 26 on the first stop of a European tour.
Former President Ronald Reagan faced a similar situation in June
1987, arriving in Italy after Premier Bettino Craxi resigned.
   Craxi, who leads the Socialist Party, is De Mita's main foe and
prompted the resignation by challenging the five-party coalition's
viability.
   U.S. Embassy spokesman Mark Dillen, said ``it is too early to
say'' whether there will be a change in Bush's plans, which include
meetings with De Mita and Pope John Paul II.
   Bush's nominee for ambassador to Italy, Michigan businessman
Peter Secchia, also has not yet been confirmed by the Senate.
   Maxwell Rabb, who served eight years, held a farewell party
earlier this week and planned to fly home on Saturday, but reports
are that he will stay for the Bush visit.
   De Mita has led the government for 13 months and the Socialists
have accused him for weeks of not showing leadership.
   In a closing speech Friday at the Socialist convention in Milan,
Craxi demanded a ``political and procedural clarification'' and an
urgent Cabinet meeting. De Mita resigned immediately after that
meeting.
   Besides the Christian Democrats and Socialists, his coalition
includes the small Republican, Social Democrat and Liberal parties.
   Craxi leads Italy's third-largest party, after the Christian
Democrats and Communists, and is trying to regain the premiership.
   He and other Socialist leaders have accused De Mita of failing
to implement the coalition's agenda of political and economic
reform, including reduction of a deficit projected at $90 billion
for this year.

   Though Justin Yu now lives thousands of miles
from his native China, he can't help but feel connected to students
in Beijing who are trying to win political freedoms from a
staunchly Communist government.
   ``I feel like it is happening to me,'' said Yu, president of the
Chinese Language Press Club in New York and a reporter for the
World Journal, the largest Chinese language newspaper in America.
``I wish I could go home and be part of it.''
   Yu, who emigrated to the United States 20 years ago and is now a
naturalized citizen, is one of about 300,000 Chinese in New York,
many of whom are keeping a close watch on developments in Beijing's
Tiananmen Square.
   Some 3,000 students have been on a hunger strike to pressure the
Chinese government into allowing free speech and a free press. Tens
of thousands of other Chinese have held vigils to support the
protesters.
   Developments overseas have been closely monitored and residents
of New York's Chinatown often know what's happened before the rest
of the United States.
   On Friday, while the world was learning that the Chinese
government had sent army troops into Beijing to end the
demonstrations, in what amounted to imposition of martial law,
Samson Ling said he already knew.
   ``We just heard the 27th and 28th armies are moving into
Beijing,'' said Ling, managing editor of China Spring, a monthly
magazine circulated among Chinese students in the United States,
Canada, Hong Kong and Western Europe.
   ``We've already gotten telephone calls from people in Beijing.
... It's a pretty tense time. Now, all we can do is wait and see.''
   In New York, which has the United States' largest Chinese
population outside of San Francisco, student groups, business
people and local Chinatown residents are supporting the students in
Beijing by holding their own demonstrations and raising funds.
   About 1,000 people, mostly students, planned to demonstrate in
front of the Capitol in Washington on Saturday to ask the U.S.
government to support the Chinese students' actions.
   Students from China studying in America also have sent several
thousand dollars to the students in Beijing, according to local
Chinese-American newspapers. Most of the money is to help buy badly
needed telephone, copying and fax machines to help publish fliers
and student newsletters.
   ``Support for the demonstrators is nearly 100 percent from
overseas Chinese,'' said Peter Lee of the Centre Daily News, a
Chinese-American daily.
   ``It's solidified all sorts of people: students; businessmen;
old, established Chinatown residents,'' said Lee. ``Even staunch
pro-Taiwanese have joined forces with pro-communists and agreed to
leave their conflict behind over this issue.''
   ``It's really quite an exciting time, in China and in America,''
said Lee.
   ``This is a great event,'' said Bu Jin, 42, a native of Shanghai
who is studying political science at Columbia University. ``But
people outside of China shouldn't expect the whole communist
government to come tumbling down because of it.''
   ``This movement, as impressive as it is, can hardly be
considered a revolution,'' he said. ``The students are asking so
little, freedom of speech and freedom of press, that's different
from wanting to change the whole system.''
   Yu says he has mixed feelings about events in his homeland.
   ``On one hand, I'm so happy to see there is hope for China's
future. But I'm saddened that students are having to suffer to get
basic rights. We're still having to suffer, after 5,000 years, to
get basic rights that so much of the world has. It's really
depressing.''

<HEAD>Immigration Regional Chief's Job in Jeopardy After Marcos Party</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Marcos</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The top immigration official in Western
states, whose appearance at a party for Ferdinand Marcos
embarrassed the White House, is likely to be replaced, a Justice
Department spokesman said.
   David Runkel, chief spokesman for Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh, on Thursday described Harold Ezell as a
``short-termer'' in the Immigration and Naturalization Service,
which is part of the Justice Department.
   Ezell, 52, said earlier this week that he made an error when he
attended a party given in Honolulu in August by ousted Philippines
leader Marcos and his wife, Imelda.
   After news organizations obtained a homemade videotape of the
party last week, he said he also erred in leading partygoers in a
prayer asking for the couple's safe return to the Philippines,
which would be against President Corazon Aquino's wishes and U.S.
policy.
   The Marcoses have been indicted in New York on charges of
diverting Philippine government money to buy millions of dollars
worth of real estate. Marcos, who has been hospitalized since
January for a variety of ailments, took a turn for the worse this
week and was listed in critical condition Friday.
   ``I would expect there would be a new INS director in that
region as part of bringing in a new management team for the INS,''
Runkel said. He would not elaborate on his statement.
   Ezell said late Thursday he had not been told his resignation
will be accepted. Ezell, who has been Western regional director of
the INS since 1983, has said he would like to continue in the job.
   ``As far as I know, this guy Runkel doesn't make the decision.
It's up to the White House and the attorney general,'' Ezell said.
``If we don't get to continue, I think we've had a big challenge
and done terrific accomplishments.''
   The outspoken Ezell is credited with playing a major role in
implementing the federal immigration amnesty program. Nearly
900,000 of the 1.5 million illegal aliens who applied for amnesty
were in the Western region.
   However, some critics have accused Ezell of focusing too much
attention on himself.
   ``His grandstanding style of operation and his constant grabbing
of headlines did nothing to bring about a better understanding of
the immigration problem,'' said Peter Schey, executive director of
the National Center for Immigrant Rights in Los Angeles.
   Ezell said if he doesn't keep the job he probably will pursue
business opportunities. He denied reports he is interested in
running for Congress.
   ``I've got zero regrets,'' Ezell said of his INS tenure. ``Since
I took this job on, I really don't think there's a major flaw to
hang our heads about. We've gathered a good team of 5,500 people in
the INS region, and they've done a good job.''

<TEXT>
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa and top
union activists and advisers met the interior minister and other
government officials Friday to discuss the political and economic
accords reached last month.
   It was the second meeting of the Arbitration Commission, a group
set up to oversee implementation of the accords reached between
authorities and the opposition April 5.
   Walesa declined to talk to reporters before the start of the
meeting in the parliament building, but the interior minister, Gen.
Czeslaw Kiszczak, said: ``I am sure we assumed the right direction
and this is irreversible no matter if one likes it or not.''
   After the 3{-hour session, Walesa said: ``It is important that
both sides are willing to remove obstacles and understand that they
will occur but have to be reduced.''
   Jozef Slisz, leader of Rural Solidarity, said authorities
accused Solidarity of being confrontational, and Solidarity said
its posters were being torn down.
   A joint communique carried by the official news agency PAP said
authorities criticized the tone of articles in the new opposition
newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza and Solidarity did the same about Trybuna
Ludu, the Communist Party paper.
   The accords resulted in the legalization of Solidarity after a
seven-year ban and provide for partially free elections to the
National Assembly.
   Elections to the Sejm and the newly created Senate _ the East
bloc's first freely elected legislative body _ are set for June 4
with a runoff on June 18.
   The first meeting of the commission was held April 18, one day
after Solidarity was legalized again.
   During those talks, Walesa met with Polish leader Gen. Wojciech
Jaruzelski who issued the December 1981 martial-law decree that
sought to dissolve the independent trade union.
   Among those accompanying Walesa were top adviser Tadeusz
Mazowiecki, Wladyslaw Frasyniuk, the Solidarity leader from the
southwestern city of Wroclaw, Warsaw Solidarity leader Zbigniew
Bujak, and political theorist Jacek Kuron.
   Politburo members Stanislaw Ciosek and Wladyslaw Baka, and
Sports Minister Alexander Kwasniewski were among the
representatives of authorities.

<HEAD>Cavazos Will Promote Local School Plans that Allow Parents to Choose</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos on Friday
announced grants, conferences and other steps his department is
taking to promote state and local plans that let parents choose the
public school their child attends.
   ``I consider choice the cornerstone to restructuring elementary
and secondary education in our country,'' Cavazos said at an
Education Press Association luncheon. ``We must do away with
ineffective conventional arrangements that only block reform.''
   Cavazos said he will personally chair four regional strategy
meetings at which governors, legislators, state education chiefs,
principals, teachers and parents will develop choice strategies for
their states.
   The secretary said he is naming a special adviser to develop
choice initiatives and a task force to evaluate choice programs
around the country. He also said he is directing that choice be a
major priority of grants awarded under the $5.8 million Secretary's
Fund for Innovation in Education.
   Cavazos, President Bush and others contend that giving parents
and students freedom to choose will invigorate schools and assure
that no child is involuntarily subjected to a second-rate
education. They say competition has created top-flight higher
education in the United States and earlier grades will benefit from
the same approach.
   The most ambitious plan is in Minnesota, which offers open
enrollment across district lines, postsecondary options and area
learning centers. Cavazos said the experiment has inspired Iowa and
Arkansas to enact open enrollment legislation and said 21 states
are considering choice programs. Scattered individual districts,
most notably East Harlem, N.Y., also have choice programs.
   At the request of the state of Minnesota, the department will
conduct a three-year evaluation of the impact of its program,
Cavazos said.
   Richard Miller, executive director of the American Association
of School Administrators, accused Cavazos and the Bush
administration of using the choice issue to try to divert attention
from underfunding in programs such as Head Start and Chapter 1, the
major federal effort for disadvantaged children.
   He said open enrollment choice programs can be beneficial to
some schools but charged that Cavazos is dodging real problems with
equity and cost. ``In essence, the secretary's approach would do
the least for those who have the least,'' Miller said.
   The secretary said he is aware of concerns that choice would
create a two-tiered education system, one for the fortunate and the
other for the disadvantaged.
   But he said inequities already exist and choice will enable
parents and students to improve their educational situations.
``Furthermore, armed with the power of choice, parents can force
inferior schools to upgrade or close,'' he said.
   Asked how districts can pay for the added costs of a choice
program, particularly transportation, Cavazos said districts
already are spending an enormous amount of money.
   ``They need to start thinking about where the dollars are going
and redirect those dollars to where they can have the most
impact,'' he said. ``If choice is the goal, they need to address
that transportation issue.''
   Cavazos said his department has published a booklet called
``Choosing a School for Your Child,'' available to parents free of
charge from the Consumer Information Center, Pueblo, Colo., 81009.
   He said two more booklets will be released this summer:
``Parental Choice in Six Nations'' and ``Improving Schools and
Empowering Parents: The White House Workshop on Choice in
Education.''

<HEAD>Baucus Announces He Has Skin Cancer During Ozone Hearing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., was chairing a
hearing on damage to the ozone layer Friday when he announced that
protecting the Earth from the sun's killing rays had suddenly
become very personal.
   Motioning to the back of his neck, he said, ``Three and a half
hours ago, my dermatologist called me up and told me I have basal
cell carcinoma.
   ``It's fine. It could be taken care of,'' he assured witnesses
who had come before his subcommittee on environmental protection.
``But I understand that it is somewhat caused by ultraviolet rays.''
   Basal cell carcinoma, the most common form of skin cancer, comes
primarily from exposure to ultraviolet radiation in sunlight. It
strikes between 300,000 and 400,000 people a year, according to the
American Academy of Dermatology. It can cause disfigurement, but it
does not spread like other cancers and has a 95 percent cure rate.
   Baucus' subcommittee was gathering testimony on legislative
proposals to reduce use of chlorofluorocarbons, known as CFCs,
which poke holes in the ozone layer and let the ultraviolet rays
through.
   CFCs, used in refrigerants and some industrial cleaning
materials, are non-toxic when released, but break apart into other
chemical substances 10 to 100 years later as they slowly build up
and rise into the stratosphere, poking holes in the ozone.
   Witnesses on Friday testified about the pros and cons of
charging fees on excess profits from the production of CFCs, and
the feasibility of using recycling as a way to minimize release of
CFCs during manufacturing.

<TEXT>
   A federal judge Friday temporarily blocked
planned drug tests covering 30 employees in the executive office of
the president and hundreds of workers in the General Services
Administration.
   Responding to three lawsuits, U.S. District Court Judge Louis
Oberdorfer issued a preliminary injunction against the random,
mandatory testing which was to have begun as early as next week.
   He said that the programs may be overly broad and that there is
little evidence in the court record of any drug problem among
employees covered by the programs.
   The judge also temporarily enjoined testing of GSA employees
suspected of using drugs. He said the agency's plan must first be
revised to provide that testing is based on more specific
requirements, ``reasonable, articulable and individualized
suspicion.''
   Oberdorfer, however, did allow random drug testing to proceed
for GSA workers who carry firearms.
   The judge said he believed a majority of the Supreme Court
``would disapprove of the mandatory random testing of the urine of
the broad range of unarmed employees now slated for testing by the
GSA and the EOP.''
   Thirty employees in the executive office of the president sued
President Bush to stop a drug testing plan which covers the Office
of Management and Budget, the U.S. Trade Representative and the
Office of Administration. Drug testing for the executive office of
the president is designed to cover all employees in positions that
are categorized as sensitive.
   Oberdorfer said that none of the 30 who filed the lawsuit has a
White House pass, that all are subjected to thorough FBI checks
before their appointment and that all operate under close
supervision.
   The court record in the lawsuit filed by the executive office of
the president employees indicated five drug abuse problems in the
past 40 months involving workers in that office.
   The judge said that at the 20,000-employee GSA, there is no
evidence that GSA made any systematic study of drug use or its
consequences.
   He noted the agency issued an order last year saying that the
``overwhelming majority'' of its workers have never had trouble
with illegal drugs.
   Some 2,360 GSA employees are covered by the planned drug
testing. One lawsuit there challenged testing in 11 job categories
representing hundreds of employees, ranging from presidential
appointees to civil engineers.
   A GSA official was able to list only 22 cases in five years in
which the agency took action against employees relating to drug
use, Oberdorfer said.

<TEXT>
   Thousands of Georgians marched through the streets
of the capital city of Tbilisi on Friday in memory of 20 people who
died in ethnic unrest on April 9.
   A dissident arrested the day of the clash between protesters and
soldiers charged on Friday that children in several schools later
were poisoned by gas that appeared similar to that used against the
demonstrators.
   The poisonings caused ``a great panic in the city,'' said Zviad
Gamsakhurdia in a telephone interview from Tbilisi.
   He was released from prison on Thursday pending trial.
   Yuri Goldadze, an editor of the official Gruzinform news agency,
said in a telephone interview that ``many thousands'' took part in
Friday's 3{-mile march from the city's medical institute to the
Sion church in Tbilisi's Old Town.
   The march ended with a requiem service. It was held on the 40th
day after the clash, a day of religious significance in the
Georgian Orthodox faith.
   The national evening TV news program ``Vremya'' showed streets
full of people and black-clad mourners crying and holding portraits
of the dead. Young men carried flags of mourning and Georgian
national flags and raised clenchedfists during a moment of silence.
   Among the participants were city and national officials, who
granted permission for the march, Goldadze said.
   He said the march and religious service were ``absolutely
peaceful'' and that the requiem service was shown live on the
Caucasus republic's official television.
   Nineteen people were killed when soldiers moved into a crowd of
pro-independence protesters on Tbilisi's Rustaveli Avenue on April
9. One young man was shot and killed later for violating a curfew.
   The clash was another example of the ethnic unrest that has
upset the Caucasus region and many other areas of the Soviet Union,
but caused a particular outcry because of charges of brutality
against the soldiers. President Mikhail S. Gorbachev called it a
blow to his reform program.
   Witnesses said the soldiers beat protesters with shovels and
Georgian officials said the soldiers used a chemical substance that
had an effect similar to nerve gas on some of the protesters.
   However, Moscow officials said the soldiers only used a chemical
agent similar but stronger than tear gas.
   Gamsakhurdia, a member of the Tbilisi Helsinki Watch Committee,
said a report was broadcast on official TV that some children had
been poisoned again recently by gas, and that officials were
investigating.
   He said children from schools No. 55, 53 and 101 were poisoned,
and all schools in the city were closed a week ahead of schedule to
avoid more cases. An undetermined number of children were being
treated for poisoning, he said.
   Protests began in Tbilisi in early April against demands by the
Abkhazian minority in northwest Georgia to have their area
transferred to the Russian republic. But many banners supporting
complete independence for Georgia soon appeared among the
demonstrators.
   The republic's Communist Party chief, Dzhumber Patiashvili, took
responsibility for the violence and resigned.
   Gamsakhurdia, a protest organizer, was arrested the same day
soldiers broke it up. He said he faces charges of violating social
order by organizing protests from last September through April, and
faces up to three years in prison if convicted.
   Also released were Mirab Kostava of the St. Ilya Society, Irakly
Tereteli of the Party of National Independence and Georgy Chanturia
of the National Democratic Party of Georgia, he said.
   All face the same charges, he said.

   Three British climbers were killed in a
fall on Mount McKinley, the National Park Service said Friday.
   Spokesman John Quinley said their bodies were found at the
15,000-foot level of North America's tallest peak shortly after
noon Thursday. He said they apparently fell about 3,000 feet.
   Quinley identified the climbers as Chris Massey, 39, of Reading,
England; John Lang, 45, of Chorley, England; and Julian Dixon, 37,
of Cambria. He said Massey was the team leader.
   The trio last was seen at the 18,000-foot level of the
20,320-foot peak Wednesday afternoon by a team of park rangers.
Quinley said the rangers decided to descend because of poor
visibility and winds gusting to 45 mph.
   Quinley said the rangers were unable to persuade the British
group to turn back. But at some point Wednesday night, the team
apparently started back down to their camp at 16,000 feet, he said.
   Thursday morning, climbers at the medical research camp at the
14,200-foot level spotted what they thought was a body at the
bottom of a steep gully known as the Orient Express, Quinley said.
   Ranger Roger Robinson, medical camp personnel and private
climbers investigated and found the bodies, he said. The bodies
were taken down to the medical camp, and will be taken off the
mountain later, Quinley said.
   Earlier this year, three Japanese climbers were killed while
trying to make a winter ascent of the mountain.
   Quinley said there are almost 400 climbers on the mountain. May
and June are the most popular months for McKinley expeditions
because weather conditions are most favorable.

   Policymakers at the Federal Reserve in March
voted to hold interest rates steady unless the slowing of economic
growth proved inadequate to restrain inflation, according to
minutes of the meeting released Friday.
   The Federal Open Market Committee, noting early signs of a
slackening in economic growth, voted 11-1 at its March 28 meeting
to leave rates unchanged initially.
   But most members felt monetary policy ``should be adjusted more
readily and promptly toward greater restraint than toward ease,''
the minutes said.
   The committee, which meets in secret eight times a year, sets
monetary policy for the Federal Reserve, whose main job is to fight
inflation.
   In March 1988, the Fed began to gradually push interest rates
upward in an attempt to cool the economy and thus curb inflation.
Since then, short-term rates have risen three percentage points and
economic growth has shown signs of softening.
   Most analysts believe the Fed is holding off on further
tightening of credit while it analyzes how the economic slowdown
will affect inflation.
   Price increases have been sharp so far this year. The Consumer
Price Index rose at an annual rate of 6.6 percent over the first
four months of 1989, up from the 4.4 percent price increases
registered in 1987 and 1988.
   FOMC members in March found recent price increases to be
``disappointing, if not entirely unexpected'' but many wanted ``to
wait for evidence to accumulate on the possible need for a further
tightening of policy,'' the minutes said.
   Some members felt ``the current slowing of the expansion might
be inadequate to restrain inflationary pressures,'' the minutes
said.
   Since the March meeting, signs of a slowdown have become more
pronounced and analysts believe the Fed is unlikely to push rates
higher.
   The FOMC met again this week but minutes of that meeting will
not be released until after the committee's next meeting in early
July. The committee is made up of the seven Federal Reserve
governors and the presidents of five of its 12 regional banks.
   The committee issues directives that govern the open market
operations of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Through the
purchase of government securities from banks, the central bank
influences the amount of reserves the banks have to make loans from
and thus the price of those loans _ interest rates.
   The committee's March directive to the New York bank said the
FOMC ``seeks to maintain the existing degree of pressure on reserve
positions.''
   However, it added that ``somewhat greater reserve restraint
would, or slightly lesser reserve restraint might, be acceptable.''
In Fed parlance, the word ``would'' carries stronger implications
than does ``might.''
   The lone dissenter from the March vote was Fed Gov. Martha
Seger, who opposed the tilt toward further increases in interest
rates, according to the minutes.
   Ms. Seger earlier this month told a group of home builders that
with the recent softening in economic growth, ``we need to be very
wary of slipping over the edge into recession.''
   A growing number of private economists have expressed concern
that the Fed's anti-inflation campaign could have the unintended
effect of causing a recession. The latest survey of 50 leading
economists by the Blue Chip Economic Indicators newsletter found
that two-thirds expect a recession to begin this year or in 1990.

   The Hungarian Helsinki Committee held
its founding session Friday and said it wants to probe human rights
violations in Hungary and elsewhere in the Soviet bloc.
   The meeting was attended by Karl Johannes von Schwarzenberg,
president of the Vienna-based International Helsinki Federation for
Human Rights, said group member Ferenc Koeszeg.
   Participants approved the statutes and elected a 16-member
steering committee, including Koeszeg, a representative of the
League of Free Democrats, and Rudolf Joo of the Hungarian
Democratic Forum.
   In addition to monitoring the Hungarian situation, ``the HHC
would like to send observers to neighboring countries to
investigate circumstances of human rights violations'' there, a
16-page founding document said.
   ``What the government and the police are doing with the
dissidents in Czechoslovakia, with Georgians and Armenians in the
Soviet Union, with Albanians in Yugoslavia and with every citizen
in Romania is in profound contraction with the principles of
Helsinki,'' the document said.
   All European countries except Albania, as well as the United
States and Canada, signed the 1975 Helsinki final act on human
rights and approved additional rights provisions agreed upon at
Helsinki follow-up conferences.
   The founding statement also said, ``We are convinced that there
is still a great deal to be done in the area of human rights (in
Hungary).
   ``The machinery of coercion is still intact, the penal code
still allows the prosecution and jailing of people on political
grounds. The police are empowered to hold people without access to
the courts and to restrict their freedom,'' it added.
   The committee also said it would try to oversee parliamentary
and local elections with the goal of free balloting and the
development of a multiparty system.

<HEAD>Aronson Says Press Reports May Have Overstated Gorbachev's Pledge</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bernard Aronson, President Bush's choice to
run Latin American policy in the State Department, said Friday that
some press reports may have overstated Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's apparent pledge to end Soviet military aid to Nicaragua.
   ``It's not clear in what manner military aid will be reduced, if
at all,'' Aronson said at his confirmation hearings before the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
   ``My impression is that some of the press reports about it have
been a little more ambitious about what it contains than what it
may contain,'' Aronson said.
   The nominee declined to characterize the contents of a Gorbachev
letter on the subject to Bush, saying that had to be left to the
president.
   He did say that Secretary of State James A. Baker III ``very
much wants to test Soviet intentions'' in the region, especially on
the issues of Soviet aid to Nicaragua and Cuba.
   ``They have an opportunity to demonstrate that in an area of the
world that is very important to the United States that they want a
new beginning,'' Aronson said.
   Aronson was asked by Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., chairman of
the panel's Latin American subcommittee, what he thought of White
House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater's characterization of Gorbachev as
``a drugstore cowboy,' out to score propaganda points.
   ``I think that as a general rule it is wise to conduct our
diplomacy based on a discussion of issues,'' Aronson said, avoiding
a direct reply.
   Dodd pressed the question and Aronson drew laughter when he
replied: ``Don't ask me to start my tenure at the State Department
by criticizing the spokesman at the White House.''
   Aronson, nominated to be assistant secretary of state for Latin
American affairs, opened his testimony by pledging bipartisan
cooperation with the Democratic-controlled Congress.
   Aronson's predecessor, Elliot Abrams, presided over Latin
American policy in the Reagan administration. Abrams' impassioned
advocacy of U.S. military support for the Nicaraguan Contra rebels
was controversial and he had a stormy relationship with Congress.
   ``If I am confirmed I'll bring with me a strong belief in
consultations,'' Aronson said. ``At the end of the day we need to
come together as Democrats and Republicans to form a bipartisan
foreign policy.''
   ``I'm not looking to go off to the State Department and make
policy by myself,'' he said.
   Dodd told the nominee he had been concerned about the nomination
``because of your lack of experience in Latin America.'' But he
added: ``Your responses today have reduced my skepticism ... I'm
going to take you at your word on consultations.''
   Questions spanned the Latin American horizon and included these
issues and countries:
   _Should the United States move to normal relations with Cuba?
   Aronson said that if Cuba is interested in normalizing relations
it should stop arming leftist guerrillas in El Salvador and stop
abusing the rights of its own citizens. Failure to take such steps
would ``stand in the way of a major normalization,'' Aronson said.
   _Nicaragua: If the Sandinista government negotiates rules which
provide a ``level playing field'' for the national elections
scheduled for Feb. 25, 1990, the United States might consider
easing some of its current sanctions.
   _El Salvador: As the newly elected right-wing government takes
office, the United States should insist on ``real progress toward
human rights, a respect for a free judiciary and the rule of law.''
   _Panama: The recent election in which thugs allied to the
country's military leader, Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, beat
opposition candidates ``makes old-style Chicago politics look like
a picnic. ... I think it's important General Noriega understand
that the United States is not going to raise these concerns and
then if the issue is not resolved go back to business as usual.''
   _The decision by the Organization of American States to condemn
the conduct of the Panamanian elections and call for Noriega's
removal: Aronson said that ``it sends a signal that democracy is
threatened and that the democratic community in Latin America and
the Caribbean cares.''
   _The Panama Canal treaties: ``I strongly support the Panama
Canal treaties. Just as the treaties were a proud symbol of
friendship between the American and Panamanian peoples, the
abrogation of the treaties would be seen as a rejection of that
friendship and a return to an earlier relationship. I do not think
it would be a wise or responsible act,'' Aronson said.
   _On democratic governments: Aronson said that ``we never get
into trouble when we defend democracies and we often get in trouble
when we do not.''

<TEXT>
   The Florida Supreme Court took no
action Friday on a state request for a quick decision on the
validity of an abortion consent law challenged successfully in
lower courts by lawyers for a 15-year-old girl.
   ``They are not going to have any ruling today on that motion,''
said Supreme Court clerk Sid White. ``Possibly Monday.''
   The girl's attorney said that barring action by the state
Supreme Court, her client was free to end her pregnancy, which was
in its 12th week, without the consent of her parents or a judge.
Lawyer Jerri Blair would not say if the girl, identified only as
T.W. of Lake County, had obtained an abortion.
   The U.S. Supreme Court refused Thursday to reinstate Florida's
abortion consent law, clearing the way for the girl and other
single minors to get abortions without consent until the state
Supreme Court deals with the matter.
   The state attorney general's office has moved to speed up the
state Supreme Court justices' review, scheduled for September, of
the validity of the 1988 law or allow enforcement in the meantime.
But the court took no action on that request Friday.
   In papers filed with the court, Assistant Attorney General Jerry
Curington argued there is confusion over whether the law is invalid
statewide.
   Although the law was struck down by only one of Florida's five
district courts of appeal, in Daytona Beach, a 1976 precedent
apparently means it cannot be enforced in the other four districts
either, he wrote.
   Therefore, Curington argued, the justices should expedite their
review or keep the law in effect until they rule on the
constitutional issues.

   Lumber jutting from a moving freight
train slammed into the engine cab of a passing Amtrak train Friday,
killing the engineer, police said.
   The force of the collision pulverized the lumber and instantly
killed engineer P.L. Sylvester, 59, of Kirkville, said police Capt.
Robert Dewey.
   ``Ultimately, when you add the speeds of both trains you're
talking about 90 miles an hour of impact,'' Dewey said.
   The accident occurred about 4:30 a.m., minutes after Amtrak's
Lakeshore Limited, bound for Chicago, left downtown Rochester with
about 350 passengers.
   Two other Amtrak crew members in the cab were not injured, said
Amtrak spokeswoman Sue Martin.
   Police had not determined how the load of 2-by-6 lumber broke
loose from its steel bands. Boards jutted out nearly 10 feet, but
the crew of the Conrail freight train may have been unaware of it,
Dewey said. The lumber was on the ninth car from the end of a
95-car train.
   The Amtrak train remained at the accident site for 2{ hours
before proceeding under power of a Conrail engine.

   A member of the opposition party burned
himself to death outside the president's office Friday during a
memorial rally by 10,000 people for a dissident publisher who
committed suicide to avoid arrest.
   Witnesses said Chan Yih-hua was engulfed in flames when he lit
bottles of gasoline strapped to his waist under a black mourning
vest.
   Riot police doused the area with water cannons. Several mourners
helped extinguish the flames with jackets and umbrellas and took
Chan to a nearby hospital, where he was pronounced dead.
   Chan, in his thirties, was a member of the Democratic
Progressive Party formed three years ago, primarily by native
Taiwanese, to oppose the governing Nationalists.
   Party officials said Chan admired Cheng Nan-jung, 42-year-old
publisher of the weekly Freedom Era, who was accused of printing
seditious articles calling for permanent separation from China.
   The Nationalists, who fled from the mainland to Taiwan in 1949
after losing a civil war to the Communists, still claim to be the
legitimate government of all China.
   Cheng died in an apartment fire April 7 after hurling firebombs
at police who had come to arrest him.
   Relatives and police said Cheng committed suicide. Friends said
he had vowed to burn himself to death and become the first martyr
of the Taiwan independence movement.
   More than 3,000 mourners, many wearing black vests printed with
``Establish New Nation,'' remained outside the presidential office
building Friday night for a sit-in in the rain. Thousands of riot
police watched.
   The demonstration was the largest on the island since Taiwan
lifted 38 years of martial law in 1987.
   Mourners, including college students and church members, urged
President Lee Teng-hui to allow freedom of speech, including
advocacy of an independent Taiwan, and release all political
prisoners.
   Police said the mourners dispersed shortly after midnight,
ending a demonstration that had lasted 11 hours.
   Cheng's coffin was taken on a two-hour funeral procession
through Taipei by 2,000 supporters before the memorial service.
Riot police erected barbed-wire barricades to keep the crowd away
from the building.

<HEAD>Use of Nazi Research Data Has Occurred, Ethicist Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Debate over whether to use research by Nazi
scientists on unwilling death camp prisoners is moot because much
of the information already has been used, the organizer of an
international conference on ethics said Friday.
   ``It's wrong to say that the question is whether we should look
at this data. The fact of the matter is that we have looked at it _
and looked at it pretty hard,'' said Arthur Caplan, director of the
University of Minnesota Center for Biomedical Ethics.
   ``Americans have cited it more than 20 times in professional
journals. British military physicians talked about it in the '60s.
In fact, it was used several times here at the conference'' when
scientists described the research and its findings, Caplan said in
an interview after the three-day conference ended.
   He cited the work of Dr. Robert Pozos, an expert on hypothermia
who has gained widespread attention in scientific circles for his
claim that Nazi research should not be wasted even if the means
used to obtain it were despicable.
   Pozos conceded in an interview Friday that Nazi research was
used in his presentation at the conference, the Meaning of the
Holocaust for Bioethics.
   ``That's fair. I'd take it a step further and say this whole
conference was in a sense a use of that data,'' Pozos said.
   Pozos told the scientists Thursday night, ``The value of human
life is great and if we have the means to save human life _ even if
the data is suspect _ we should use it.''
   A professor of physiology and biophysics at the University of
Washington, Pozos cited tests in which 80 to 90 prisoners at Dachau
were dunked in freezing water, sometimes to their deaths, to help
Nazi researchers design protective gear for Luftwaffe pilots who
might be shot down over water.
   ``Physiologically, the data still is valid and has value today
in terms of describing acute cold stress in water,'' Pozos said.
``The situation is one in which I think good might come from evil.''
   Asked if he felt guilt about using the data, Pozos said, ``I
don't feel comfortable with it. The discussion troubles me. I have
very strong mixed emotions about it. It wakes me up at three in the
morning.
   ``But the question is not whether to use the data. It's how to
address the fact that it is being used and how that fact should be
acknowledged.''
   The conference, which Caplan said drew 225 scientists,
ethicists, theologians and Holocaust survivors from eight
countries, also included discussions on the propriety of using Nazi
analogies when discussing abortion and on the relationship between
medicine and Naziism.
   Eva Kor, of Terre Haute, Ind., a survivor of Dr. Josef Mengele's
experiments on twins at Auschwitz, told a panel discussion at the
conference Thursday night that she was appalled by the idea that
scientists might use the data.
   Kor and her sister, Miriam, spent 10 months in Auschwitz when
they were 9 years old. Of their family, only the twin sisters
survived.
   ``I learned the soap I washed with for two years was made out of
human fat,'' Kor said. ``I had nightmares for years later that the
soap I washed with was made from my own parents.''
   Velvl Greene, another panel member who is director of the
Jakobovits Center for Jewish Medical Ethics at Ben Gurion
University in Beer Sheva, Israel, said he was ``sickened and
appalled'' by the straightforward manner in which Pozos appealed
for use of the Nazi data.
   But Greene said he agreed the data should be made available if
it would save lives.
   ``It is not a question of can we use the data, but how best can
we use the data as a memorial,'' he said. ``Maybe by memorializing
it, we will never mitigate it but we will remember.''

<HEAD>Compromise Plan on Short-Range Missile Dispute Reported</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-US-Germany, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROL J. WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A senior West German official said
Friday that Washington and Bonn have worked out a formula for a
face-saving compromise in the dispute over NATO's short-range
nuclear missiles.
   Under the compromise, discussed during the Washington visit of
West German Defense Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg, the U.S.
administration would accept the idea of negotiations with the
Kremlin if West Germany makes clear it does not seek a ``third
zero'' _ immediate elimination of short-range weapons.
   The reported agreement is mostly symbolic, as no date has been
proposed for the start of superpower talks on the missiles and the
talks remain conditional on an unspecified improvement in the
East-West balance of conventional arms, the source said.
   But West Germany and the United States have been arguing over
the issue of short-range missiles for months, and the Washington
talks appear to have found a common position for the two allies to
take with them to the NATO summit in Brussels on May 29-30.
   ``It is no longer disputed that there should be negotiations on
short-range weapons,'' said the Bonn official, familiar with
Stoltenberg's talks in Washington. ``But they (the talks) should be
prepared carefully and in relation to conventional reductions.''
   The official's explanation of the agreement suggested that U.S.
and West German officials had backed down from their previous
positions.
   Stoltenberg flew to Washington Wednesday to meet with U.S.
Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney.
   The West German defense minister, appointed only a month ago,
was reported to have taken with him a new plan for resolving the
dispute that has separated Bonn and Washington and caused a rift
within the NATO alliance.
   Stoltenberg was to propose a link between a reduction of Soviet
troops and tanks in Europe and the start of short-range
negotiations. The Bonn official said that proposal was accepted in
principle by the U.S. officials Stoltenberg met with.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has begun withdrawing
50,000 troops and 5,000 tanks from Eastern Europe and has announced
that the Kremlin will unilaterally cut its short-range nuclear
arsenal by 500 warheads.
   However, U.S. officials have said both gestures fall short of
what is needed to warrant revision of NATO defense policy.
   Baker told reporters in Washington earlier this week that he
considered short-range negotiations ``a mistake'' under the current
circumstances.
   Washington contends NATO should stand by its ``flexible
response'' doctrine, or retention of some nuclear weapons in Europe
for use in repelling a potential attack by the East bloc's superior
conventional forces.
   But as both military blocs have begun dismantling their
intermediate-range nuclear missiles under the 1987 INF treaty, the
burden of hosting a nuclear option has shifted to West Germany,
where most of NATO's short-range systems are deployed.
   Of the 88 short-range Lance missile launchers stationed in
Central Europe by NATO, 76 are in West Germany.
   Bonn has refused to go along with a NATO plan to upgrade the
Lance missiles, which have a range of about 75 miles, with new
rockets capable of reaching targets as far away as 300 miles until
the superpowers take some interim steps to reduce the weapons they
have deployed in Europe.
   NATO's plan is widely opposed in West Germany for fear it will
damage improving relations with Eastern Europe and chances for
further progress on arms control progress.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze threatened during a
visit to Bonn last weekend that the Kremlin might halt destruction
of its SS-23s, one of the missiles being removed under the INF
agreement, if NATO goes ahead with the modernization project.
   It was not immediately clear whether the compromise reportedly
worked out by Stoltenberg and U.S. officials on Thursday would be
acceptable to other members of the 16-nation NATO alliance, or even
if the junior political parties in Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
coalition would go along.

   Last year's drought may have reduced wheat

grain, the Agriculture Department said Friday.
   A report by the department's grain inspection service said 57
percent of the samples of wheat from the 1988 crop were graded U.S.
No. 1, up from 49 percent in 1987. The agency said the average
moisture content of 1988 wheat also was lower than in 1987, while
the protein content of the grain was up.

   Fire gutted a home in this far south
suburb of Chicago on Friday, killing a mother and five of her
children all under age 6, officials said.
   ``I saw flames coming out of the bedroom window and the front
window, and the front door just fell right off,'' said neighbor
Kelly McNamara. ``It was an aluminum door and it just melted right
off.''
   The mother and two boys were found dead on the floor of the
living room in their modest four-bedroom frame home, said Police
Chief James Wade. Three other children, found in a bedroom in the
center of the house, suffered severe smoke inhalation and were
pronounced dead at a hospital, Wade said.
   The victims were Christine Ireland, 27, and her children,
Nicole, 5; Thomas, 4; James 3; Robert, 1{; and Michael, 5 months,
Wade said.
   Mrs. Ireland's husband, Thomas, 33, was at work when the fire
broke out about 10 a.m., and the couple's only surviving child,
Jamie, 7, was in school, Wade said.
   The cause of the fire was under investigation, but foul play was
not suspected, Wade said.

<HEAD>Soviet Foreign Minister Criticizes Bush Speech</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze said in an
interview released Friday that he was amazed by the ``old
ideological film'' on President Bush's address a week ago on
U.S.-Soviet relations.
   His comments in the Communist Party daily Pravda, transmitted by
the Tass news agency, were the first high-level reaction to Bush's
May 12 speech at Texas A&amp;M University.
   ``The speech of President Bush at the Texas university, I admit,
amazed me,'' Shevardnadze said. ``It amazed me with its tone, I
would even say with its somehow old ideological film and in places
with its didactic inclination.
   ``It seemed to us that our political dialogue already had
crossed into a new category, freed from the blinders of ideological
rhetoric, that we may carry it out without empty polemic cliches.''
   The minister, just back from the Soviet-Chinese summit in
Beijing with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, said it was
``completely incomprehensible'' to the Soviets why Bush said the
Soviet Union had yielded to Washington's appeals to renew
negotiations on strategic nuclear weapons.
   He said Moscow had long been pressing to restart the talks, but
the Bush administration delayed while it conducted a review of its
arms control policy.
   Still, Shevardnadze said he found some ``correct, positive
thoughts'' in the statements of Bush and Secretary of State James
A. Baker III, who visited Moscow last week.
   And he added, ``We will judge U.S. policies not by their words,
but by their deeds.''
   Both sides said at the end of Baker's two-day visit on May 11
that the new U.S. administration got off to a good start in its
relationship with the Soviet Union.
   They said they would resume negotiations on strategic weapons in
June.
   Gorbachev told Baker the Soviet Union will withdraw unilaterally
500 short-range nuclear warheads from East Europe this year, but
Baker rejected the negotiations the Kremlin sought to remove all
such weapons on both sides.
   Baker said the Soviets still have an overwhelming advantage in
the weapons that must be reduced further before negotiations can
begin.
   The warheads are at the heart of a dispute in the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization. The United States and Britain want to
modernize and extend the range of NATO's Lance missiles. West
Germany leads a group of NATO countries that want to start
negotiations with the Soviet Union on removing them.
   In response to a question, Shevardnadze denied that Moscow was
trying to put pressure on NATO.
   He reiterated that the Soviet Union wants to begin negotiations
to remove the missiles. ``Our position on this question derives
from common sense, and there is nothing threatening in it,''
Shevardnadze said.

<HEAD>Oil Lobby Steps Up Defense of Exxon's Cleanup Effort</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The main lobbying group for the major U.S. oil
companies, seeking to blunt public criticism of Exxon Corp.'s
handling of the Alaska oil spill, said Friday the company should
not be faulted for the slow pace of cleanup.
   ``The cleanup moves slowly because it is based upon
environmental and ecological considerations,'' said Charles J.
DiBona, president of the American Petroleum Institute.
   DiBona earlier this week toured Prince William Sound, where
nearly 11 million gallons of crude oil spilled from the Exxon
Valdez supertanker on March 24 in the worst oil spill in U.S.
history.
   He said six of the 88 miles of shoreline hit with the heaviest
amounts of oil have been cleaned up. A total of 364 miles of
beaches was affected by the spill.
   In a bid to deflect some of the criticism from Exxon, DiBona
repeatedly stressed that the company was committed to spending as
much money as necessary to clean the spill completely, even if it
had to return to the scene next spring.
   A Transportation Department official, meanwhile, said a report
to President Bush on the government and industry response to the
spill was ``critical of everybody'' for a ``wholly insufficient''
job of reacting to the accident.
   DiBona sought to portray Exxon's effort as being especially
sensitive to the possibility that the cleanup itself could do
further damage to the area's wildlife.
   He said Exxon crews were engaged in a ``particularly arduous''
cleanup on the north side of Smith Island and other areas where the
seasonal seal birthing, or pupping, is approaching.
   ``Slow progress cleaning the first several thousand feet of
shoreline has discouraged some, but the slowness is the result of
the special considerations associated with these efforts,'' DiBona
said, adding that ``the cleanup needed to be especially rigorous
because of concerns for seal pupping.''
   He said ``progress clearly will accelerate'' once work proceeds
beyond the next few weeks.
   DiBona also downplayed the effects of the spill on fish and
birds in the area.
   ``There is no evidence of a major fish kill,'' he said, adding
that most migratory birds were not hurt by the oil because they
were in an area east of the spill.

<HEAD>Soviet Official Says Post-Chernobyl Safety Changes Nearly Ready</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A broad overhaul of Soviet civilian nuclear
safety standards, triggered by the 1986 Chernobyl disaster, will be
completed this summer, a senior Soviet official said Friday.
   The revised ``General Safety Rule'' will include new safety
requirements that correspond to standards set by the International
Atomic Energy Agency, said Vadim M. Malyshev, chairman of the State
Committee on Supervision of Nuclear Power Safety.
   ``Some of the requirements are even higher'' than the
international rules, he added.
   Malyshev spoke in an interview with two American reporters
following talks with his U.S. counterpart, Lando W. Zech Jr.,
chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
   A five-man Soviet delegation of nuclear regulatory officials
visited the Calvert Cliffs nuclear plant in Maryland on Wednesday
and is scheduled to tour the Indian Point nuclear station and the
Brookhaven National Laboratory, both in New York, next week.
   U.S. regulators visited Soviet nuclear facilities last August.
   Malyshev and Zech announced after their meeting at NRC
headquarters that they had approved plans for an exchange of
nuclear safety inspectors as part of a broad cooperation agreement
signed in April 1988.
   A two-person team of Soviet inspectors will spend about seven
weeks at the Catawba nuclear station near Rock Hill, S.C., and an
American team will spend a similar period at the Zaporoshye nuclear
facility southeast of Kiev in the Ukraine.
   Each side will study the other's inspection techniques and
operator safety procedures.
   Malyshev, speaking through an interpreter, said a broad review
of safety standards was undertaken following the April 1986
Chernobyl accident in the northern Ukraine that killed at least 31
people and released a cloud of radiation that eventually circled
the globe. It was the worst nuclear accident in history.
   Malyshev did not give specific examples of changes in Soviet
safety standards, but he said a ``revised and re-edited'' set of
rules would be ready by June or July.
   The Soviet official took issue with a report earlier this month
that the local Communist Party chief in Kiev was complaining of
declining attention to safety at Chernobyl, where reactors not
involved in the accident are still operating.
   ``I think that is incorrect,'' Malyshev said. ``I feel the level
of requirements has been raised and the safety culture, as it's
called, has become significantly higher.''
   Malyshev also said safety regulators were studying when and
whether to decommission about 12 old-generation civilian nuclear
plants. The Soviets have a total of 45 civilian nuclear reactors.
   ``We think the closest possible date for decommissioning those
would be sometime before the year 2005, but it may well be
considerably earlier than that,'' he said.
   He cited two reactors already picked for decommissioning: the
No. 2 unit at the Beloyarskiy station, situated in the Ural
Mountains near the city of Sverdlovsk, and the No. 2 unit at the
Novovoronezhskiy station, near the city of Voronezh in the Russian
republic.

<HEAD>Ruling Party Adopts Political Reform Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TETSUO JIMBO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The governing Liberal Democratic Party adopted a
political reform plan Friday in hopes of repairing a reputation
left in tatters by a bribery and influence-peddling scandal.
   The plan, proposed to Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita on
Thursday, would put lower limits on some political donations,
reduce the number of parliament seats and require all legislators
to disclose their assets. Only Cabinet members now are required to
reveal their wealth.
   It also would require Cabinet members and party officials to
leave their party factions, said Masaharu Gotoda, former chief
Cabinet secretary and chairman of the party Political Reform
Committee.
   Five factions dominate the party, each with a leader who aspires
to be prime minister. The factions are blamed for much of Japan's
big-money politics because the power balance among them is
determined largely by their financial strength.
   In a scandal that began last summer and has reached the top of
politics and business, the Recruit Co. is accused of of trying to
buy favors with large donations and insider stock deals that
benefited about 160 politicians, bureaucrats and business
executives.
   Gotoda described the reform plan to reporters as
``forward-looking'' and said, ``The most important thing is how to
implement it.
   ``Similar scandals have been repeated every 10 years or so, and
this proposal is also intended to eliminate the root of such
scandals,'' he said.
   The reforms now go to the parliament as legislation and are
expected to be enacted by November.
   Provisaions include a ban on speculating with political funds,
requiring that the funds be in government bonds or deposited in
banks, a ban on fund-raising parties by Cabinet members, which are
a common way to dodge limits on political donations, and reducing
the need for campaign money by gradually lowering the number of
parliament seats from 512 to 471.
   Analysts said they found some willingness in the party to make
the changes necessary to regain public confidence, but many
remained skeptical of its ability to abandon the old practices.
   Koichi Kishimoto, a prominent critic of politics, said the party
includes people ``whose prime concern is how to cling to their
power.''
   This is the most serious crisis to date for the Liberal
Democrats, who have governed Japan since 1955.
   Party leaders, including Takeshita and his predecessor, Yasuhiro
Nakasone, took Recruit money and Takeshita admitting to accepting
the equivalent of $1.1 million in various forms. The prime minister
has said he will resign soon.

   At Taffy's luncheonette, as elsewhere
in the small towns of northeastern Massachusetts, there was an air
of resignation Friday _ the look that hangs over a town that just
lost in the semifinals against the team from the big city.
   That prevailing wind resulted from a Nuclear Regulatory
Commission decision Thursday to allow low-power testing at the
nearby Seabrook, N.H., nuclear power plant. It's an important first
step to a full-power license, and a defeat for those who for two
decades have fought the plant's opening.
   Betty, a customer who would give her opinion but not her last
name, summed up: ``There's too much money involved in it, and money
talks.''
   ``We've known from almost Day 1 that at some point this would
happen,'' said Norma Beit, chairperson of Citizens Within the
10-Mile Radius, an anti-Seabrook group. ``We've always known it
(NRC) was a kangaroo court, and it has been.''
   Still, many in this coastal region say they aren't ready to
surrender.
   For one thing, Seabrook's opponents insist the federal courts,
not the NRC, will have the final say in whether Seabrook ever puts
out even a watt of electricity. The NRC put its decision on hold to
allow for a possible court appeal. If that fails, low-power testing
could begin in a week.
   The administration of Gov. Michael S. Dukakis and the citizens
groups opposed to Seabrook argue that it would be impossible to
evacuate the region during a nuclear accident, particularly during
the summer months when thousands jam the narrow roads leading to
the beaches.
   ``The geography of the area and the availability of
transportation resources are key,'' said Tom Moughan of Amesbury.
``Also, there are the dramatic wind shifts. A change in the
direction of a radiation plume can blow it as far as Haverhill
within a matter of minutes.''
   ``I don't know how they let them start building without a full
evacuation plan,'' said Bob Goldthwaite, manager of Atkinson's
Lumber in Newburyport. ``It's difficult to get a safe evacuation
plan. Look at Chernobyl _ we saw the cloud over here. ... How far
can you run?''
   Arguments like that one are now being made before the NRC's
Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, which since March has been
holding hearings in Boston on the evacuation plan for Massachusetts
communities within 10 miles of the plant. The plan was developed by
New Hampshire Yankee, operator of the facility, after Massachusetts
officials refused.
   Seabrook officials say the plant is safe and is badly needed to
meet New England's energy needs into the 21st century. They argue
that their evacuation plan, which includes alerting the plant's
Massachusetts neighbors by sirens mounted on trucks and
helicopters, is sufficient.
   The evacuation plan must be approved before the plant is
licensed to run at full power. But state officials say that if the
panel approves the plan, they will appeal to a higher court.
   Ingrid Sanborn, a resident of West Newbury for 23 years, did not
attend the first protests against Seabrook in the early days. She
said she chose instead to work through the system, attending
meetings in New Hampshire and Massachusetts, and becoming
increasingly discouraged with what she saw.
   She predicted residents would not give up.
   ``The people in this area,'' Sanborn said, ``will go to whatever
length they have to.''

   The Agriculture Department said Friday it has
approved a permit for the University of Kentucky to conduct a field
test of tobacco containing a mouse liver gene that regulates the
concentration of heavy metals.
   Eventually, officials said, the research could lead to a
reduction in disease by making it possible to keep soil-borne toxic
metals largely in the uneaten roots of leafy vegetables.
   ``Heavy metals have been implicated in many disease processes
and can be consumed by humans when eating leafy vegetables like
spinach or lettuce,'' said Larry B. Slagle, acting administrator of
the department's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service.
   Tobacco can be used as a ``model crop'' to help understand
genetically engineered traits before transferring them to other
plant species, he said.
   The mouse liver gene instructs the plant to make a protein
called metallothionein, which binds tightly to heavy metals such as
cadmium, mercury and copper. In greenhouse tests, University of
Kentucky scientists found that the protein lowered the level of
cadmium on tobacco leaves by about a fourth.
   Slagle said the field trials will be in Lexington, Ky.,
beginning in late May and continuing through the summer.

   A top Solidarity leader cautioned Friday that
Poland could face a violent social upheaval despite the new
political arrangement in that country.
   ``The real danger to the new Polish policy is not the resistance
of hardliners but the economic situation,'' said Bronislaw Geremek,
a historian who has served for nine years as a top adviser to Lech
Walesa and is emerging as a senior statesman of the Polish
opposition.
   Geremek met Friday with Vice President Dan Quayle and with
Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger, and addressed a
seminar at the Wilson Center of the Smithsonian Institution.
   Speaking at the Wilson center, Geremek warmly praised a speech
on Polish affairs given by President Bush last month in which the
president pledged economic assistance if the government carries
through with economic reforms.
   ``The direction was very good. In President Bush's speech, we
found the enunciation of a general policy,'' said Geremek.
   Poland's Communist authorities have re-legalized Solidarity,
which they outlawed and tried to crush under martial law from 1981
through 1983. And they have agreed to elections next month in which
Solidarity and other opposition groups will be able to put forward
candidates for the first time.
   Under the agreement, a coalition consisting of the communists
and allied parties is guaranteed a majority in the Sejm, or lower
house of parliament, but no quotas are set for a newly created
Senate.
   Equally important, the agreement sets no quotas for Communist
domination under elections scheduled four years hence, and it
allows Solidarity to publish its own mass-circulation newspaper for
the first time since the declaration of martial law in December
1981.
   ``We signed the agreement because we felt that an explosion of
political unrest in Poland could destroy a political deal,''
Geremek told the Wilson Center seminar.
   ``The urgency is not overstated. And I am not sure that we have
obtained a comprehension of that from the government side,'' he
said.
   Communist officials have said they signed the agreement to widen
political support for an economic reform program they have been
pushing unsuccessfully for years.
   ``The existance of strong trade unions is a danger to economic
reforms,'' said Geremek, referring not so much to Solidarity, which
has agreed to work for the reforms, but to official unions that
have been pushing for higher wages.
   ``At the end of the year, the deterioration of the economic life
of Poland could destroy what could be a national rebirth,'' he
said. ``We have a situation in which Solidarity, having gained
tremendous moral authority, may have the ability to prevent that
explosion.''
   Geremek forecast a Poland in which Communist authorities enjoy
increasingly less power, but which would not withdraw from the
Soviet-led defensive alliance, a step that prompted the invasion of
Hungary in 1956.

<HEAD>Proxmire Issues First Golden Fleece Award as a Private Citizen</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Sen. William Proxmire, D-Wis., who
waged a running battle against government waste and extravagance
during his 31-year Senate career, on Friday issued his first Golden
Fleece award as a private citizen.
   His target: multi-million dollar spending to help educate
doctors by the Public Health Service of the Department of Health
and Human Services.
   Proxmire's point: Physicians make more money as a class than
virtually any other group of Americans and can easily afford to
finance their own educations, even if they have to go into debt.
   James Brown, a spokesman for HHS's Public Health Service, said
Proxmire's reference to the program he was harpooning was too vague
to ascertain which one he meant.
   ``It's difficult to respond to this because we don't have
specifics,'' Brown said. ``There are a number of programs (in which
money is spent to educate doctors) so it is impossible to determine
which he means.''
   Although Proxmire said the program he wants eliminated costs
$100 million a year, Brown said he was not sure of the figure.
   For example, Brown said, one program dating back to the 1970s
provides special training for new doctors to become primary care
physicians. This year, $59 million will be spent on the program.
   ``This is a program this administration and the previous one
have tried to eliminate, but the Congress keeps putting the money
back in,'' Brown said.
   The administration wants to cut the program ``because it has
already accomplished what we wanted to do _ getting doctors into
the primary care areas,'' he said.
   Proxmire said he believed that program was the one to which his
award pertained and said both Congress and the administration
should share the blame for wasteful spending.
   He said the executive branch should have taken a stronger stand
and insisted the money be taken out of the budget.
   ``If they (the administration) had made their case with
sufficient force, if they had publicly said this is a waste of
taxpayers' money, there's no question Congress would have had to
react and eliminate it,'' Proxmire said.
   At a news conference at the National Press Club, Proxmire said
American doctors represent ``the world's best compensated
occupation.''
   There is no shortage of doctors to justify subsidizing their
educations, he said. Proxmire pointed out that while there were 142
doctors for every 100,000 Americans in 1950, that ratio has
increased to 233 per 100,000.
   ``Doctors are increasing 60 percent faster than the population
at large,'' the former senator said.
   And he says that's not surprising. ``A profession that pays the
average practitioner _ and I mean average _ $120,000 a year will
not not lack for new practitioners,'' he said. ``So what we have is
$100 million of your tax money spent for nothing.''
   Proxmire issued his non-senatorial Golden Fleece in a small
burst of self promotion.
   He is starting a nationwide weekly column syndicated by United
Features in which he will tell the country what he thinks about
subsidizing the education of doctors, as well as other issues.
   The column will be Proxmire's first newspaper job since he was
fired as a reporter by the Madison, Wis., Capitol Times in 1949, he
says.
   Since then he has run his own publishing company, served in the
Senate and issued more than 150 Golden Fleece awards in a series
that was unbroken from March 1975 to last December when he retired
from the Senate.
   Previous targets include Transporation Department officials who
spent $10,000 to inspect the transportation system at Disney World,
and government studies of why people fall in love and why prisoners
want to escape from jail.

<HEAD>``Mississippi Burning'' Quietly Opens, Closes in Town Portrayed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``Mississippi Burning'' has closed
after a quiet, five-day run in the town portrayed in the movie
about the deaths of three civil rights workers.
   The film had been scheduled to open May 24 at the Ellis Theatre,
several months after its national premiere.
   ``I found out it was the last week of schools and graduation so
I moved it up'' to May 10-14, Shelly Steiger, whose family has
owned Philadelphia's only theater for more than 35 years, said
Friday.
   Steiger said the five-day run was ``the way I play all my
pictures.'' He said he never considered extending the time because
it would not pay off in a town of about 7,000 people.
   Attendance was better than average, Steiger said, although he
could not provide figures. ``Most came to see it out of curiosity I
think,'' he said.
   Steiger suggested that many who wanted to see the film had done
so in Meridian, 40 miles to the southeast, where the movie opened
Jan. 27 and ran for eight weeks.
   Monty Royal, manager of R&amp;S Cinema in Meridian, said the movie
was the year's biggest money maker for his theater in the city
where federal trials of those accused in the civil rights murders
were held.
   ``Most people were very understanding of the fact that Hollywood
made a movie that was entertaining,'' Royal said. ``Generally,
everybody that I saw said it was one of the better movies that they
had seen and they did think the atmosphere that was played in the
movie was indicative of the times.''
   ``Mississippi Burning'' is a fictionalized account of the
federal investigation into the murders of James Chaney, Andrew
Goodman and Michael Schwerner in Neshoba County. Their bodies were
found in an earthen dam near Philadelphia six weeks after their
deaths on June 21, 1964.
   The Orion Pictures release was praised by critics and won an
Academy Award for best cinematography. The movie was harshly
criticized by people involved in the civil rights movement,
particularly blacks who said it gave the FBI too much credit.
   Steiger said he observed little reaction from Philadelphia
audiences.
   ``It was just a very quiet crowd. They had very few comments,''
he said. ``Those who said anything said it was overblown; so much
of it didn't happen.''
   Stanley Dearman, publisher of the weekly Neshoba Democrat
newspaper, agreed, saying, ``It's just not being talked about very
much.''
   Dearman added that he was disappointed that Steiger had
``slipped (the movie) in and slipped it out.
   ``I would have loved to have been able to interview people
exiting the movie to get their reaction,'' said Dearman, who said
he was out of town when ``Mississippi Burning'' opened.
   Steiger said the movie was advertised on the two local radio
stations as usual.

   Communist officials in Slovenia
said Friday that Yugoslavia's most liberal republic needs an
independent news agency, the official Tanjug news agency reported.
   The Slovenian news agency would compete with Tanjug and would
help in ``making the news reporting more objective,'' an official
of the republic's Socialist Alliance, a Communist-led mass
organization, was quoted as saying.
   The Belgrade-based Tanjug is now the only news agency in
Yugoslavia.
   The northern republic of Slovenia, whose leadership advocates
regional autonomy, greater democracy and closer ties with the West,
has long been at odds with the republic of Serbia, where officials
favor greater central control and a stronger federal government.
   Slovenian officials claim the Serbian press, including Tanjug,
is conducting a ``media war'' against democratic processes in
Slovenia.
   The founding of the Slovenian news agency would ``help in
avoiding biased and unobjective informing of the public,''
Slovenian officials reportedly said, adding that the competition
``would also be good for Tanjug.''
   In another development, Slovenia's official youth organization
demanded a retrial of four people sentenced to jail by a military
court, Tanjug reported.
   Three Slovenian journalists from the outspoken Mladina youth
weekly and an army sergeant-major were sentenced last July to jail
terms ranging from 10 months to four years on charges of possesing
a classified document.
   The action sparked a wave of public protests in Slovenia, which
culminated with a rally of about 30,000 people in the regional
capital, Ljubljana, on May 8.
   The protesters claimed the charges and closed trial were rigged
by the military to punish the journalists for publishing numerous
articles sharply criticizing the armed forces.
   The youth organization also demanded that the defendants be
allowed to get civilian legal counsel instead of the military
attorneys stipulated by army regulations.
   Under Yugoslav law, official requests by such organs must be
taken into consideration by the regional authorities.

   Unseasonably high temperatures crept to 90 degrees Friday
afternoon in portions of New York and interior New England, while
southern and western Texas wilted under another day of heat and
humidity.
   In the northern Rockies, however, afternoon temperatures were
near the freezing mark in Yellowstone National Park and several
inches of snow accompanied by high winds fell overnight on some of
the higher mountains. Dixie, Idaho, reported 9 inches of snow and 4
inches fell at Lolo Pass, Mont.
   Temperatures fell into the teens in some of the higher
elevations of the Northwest.
   In extreme southern Texas, temperatures neared 100 degrees. San
Antonio recorded a high of 97 to break the record of 96 set for the
date in 1939.
   At Beeville, a temperature of 99 degrees and a relative humidity
of 45 percent brought the heat index to 112 degrees.
   The cooling effect of the Gulf of Mexico, however, kept Port
Aransas, Texas, at a comfortable 80 degrees.
   The cold waters of the Atlantic Ocean likewise kept eastern
Boston in the 50s through mid-afternoon, while a short distance
inland temperatures were in the 70s and 80s.
   Burlington, Vt., hit 91 degrees, breaking the city's record of
90 degrees for the date set in 1971.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. CDT ranged from 33
degrees at Yellowstone, Wyo., to 100 degrees at Laredo, Texas.
   A low pressure system approaching the Mississippi Valley spread
showers and thunderstorms eastward into the Ohio Valley and
southern Appalachians. Thunderstorms produced small-size hail in
the St. Louis area.
   Rain was scattered from Michigan to Minnesota and Iowa and along
the cold front over the Dakotas, while afternoon thunderstorms
developed along the central Gulf Coast.
   Heavier rainfall during the six hours ending at 1 p.m. CDT
included .73 of an inch at St. Louis, .54 at Rockford, Ill., .32 at
South Bend, Ind., and .31 at Grand Forks, N.D.
   A large area of clear skies stretched from California across the
intermountain region and the central and southern Rockies to the
southern half of the Great Plains.
   The forecast for Saturday called for showers and thunderstorms
from the Great Lakes across the Ohio and Tennessee valleys to the
Gulf Coast, over the southern Plains and along the eastern slopes
of the central and southern Rockies. Scattered showers were
forecast across the Dakotas and the Pacific Northwest, and gusty
winds were expected to continue over the northern Rockies and
northern Plains.
   High temperatures were expected in the 60s from the Pacific
Northwest across the northern Rockies to the Dakotas; in the 90s in
Florida and from Texas to the interior valleys of California; and
up to 100 degrees along the Rio Grande Valley of Texas and in the
desert Southwest. Temperatures were expected in the 70s and 80s
across most of the rest of the nation.

   John F. Kennedy Jr. got his law degree Friday
from New York University.
   ``I'm very happy it's over,'' Kennedy said as he posed for
photographs with his mother, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, and his
sister, Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg.
   ``I'm looking forward to taking the bar this summer and
following in my sister's footsteps,'' said Kennedy, who will work
in the Manhattan district attorney's office.
   His 31-year-old sister graduated from Columbia University Law
School last year and was notified earlier this month that she
passed the state bar examination on her first try.
   Kennedy, 28, was among 713 graduates honored during a ceremony
at the Felt Forum. Asked how he would celebrate, he replied with a
grin, ``I can't tell you that.''
   Young Kennedy and his sister are the children of the late
President John F. Kennedy.

   The Red Army pulled out an additional
54 tanks and 600 soldiers from Hungary on Friday in a ceremony
highlighted by a military parade, an army band and a Soviet trooper
singing a patriotic song in Hungarian.
   The Soviets withdrew 31 tanks from Kiszkunhalasz base in
southern Hungary on April 25, the first step in a partial Soviet
pullout from East Europe announced by President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev last December.
   The plan calls for the Soviet army to be reduced by 500,000 men
by the end of 1990.
   About 62,000 Soviet soldiers are stationed in Hungary. The
Soviets have promised to withdraw 10,000 servicemen, 450 tanks,
3,000 vehicles and more than 200 artillery pieces by the end of
next year.
   From Sarbogard base, about 50 miles south of Budapest, the T-64
tanks of the 141st Tank Regiment of the 13th Guards Tank Division
moved out Friday.
   A Soviet artillery unit, now positioned near the Austrian
border, will occupy this military base. Officials have said the
idea is to create a 100- kilometer (62-mile) zone of confidence
along the border with neutral Austria.
   Hungarian Young Pioneers rushed up to departing soldiers,
handing them flowers and red Pioneer kerchiefs.
   Janos Sabatkai, a local Communist Party secretary of Sarbogard
village, praised the Soviet troops for their help in time of need _
helping out at harvest time or when natural calamity struck.
   He added, ``There were undesirable things that happened as
well'' during the Soviet soldiers' stay, but did not elaborate.
   Lt. Gen. Yuri Vodolazov, first deputy commander of the departing
tank division, stressed that the Soviet troop cuts were unilateral.
   He said these troops will be demobilized when they get home,
adding: ``No one should mistake this move. We are prepared,
together with the Hungarian people's army, to defend socialist
unity. We hope the NATO countries will follow suit.''

<TEXT>
   National park and forest
managers have taken too narrow a view in forming policies such as
the suspended practice of allowing forest fires caused by nature to
burn, an expert said Friday.
   ``The key point is the parks can no longer be considered
ecological or social islands,'' University of Washington professor
James Agee told the Greater Yellowstone Coalition.
   ``They are tied to surrounding areas, for better or for worse.
The park manager who thinks he is ... independent of surrounding
lands is living in a fantasy land.''
   Agee said the goal in any future policies should not be to allow
natural fires to burn for their own sake, but to achieve natural
changes in landscapes.
   Agee, a fire resource management expert, was a featured speaker
at the influential private environmental group's first annual
meeting since last summer's devastating fires burned sections of
nearly half of the 2.2 million-acre national park. The coalition
claims a membership of 3,100 individuals and 60 organizations
nationwide.
   When the Yellowstone fires were raging out of control in July,
the Interior Department suspended a ``let burn'' policy adopted in
1972 under which naturally caused forest fires were allowed to burn
unless they threatened lives or structures.
   Yellowstone spokeswoman Joan Anzelmo confirmed Friday that
lightning-caused fires will be fought in the park this summer.
   Agee said fire management policies in the future will have to be
based on the ``ecosystem'' concept, applying policies to areas in a
region with similar ecologies.
   ``We can no longer rely on the myth of natural regulation,''
said the chairman of the University of Washington's Division of
Forest Resource Management. ``These are not closed systems.''
   Changes in the world's climate also will have to be considered,
Agee said, and current policies are ``not sufficient to the task.''
   ``We must look at a network of land managed for multiple
goals,'' he said. ``We must recognize that the boundaries of the
parks are permeable barriers.''
   And any policy must reflect the impact of man and his role in
natural processes, Agee said.
   Agee's comments followed welcoming statements by Jim Schmitt,
executive vice president of the coalition board, who said ignorance
among politicians, the media and the public were to blame for the
criticism heard about the management of the fires last summer.

<HEAD>North Prosecutors Say They Didn't Rely on Immunized Testimony</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETE YOST</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oliver North's prosecutors said Friday they
gathered their evidence independently from the former White House
aide's immunized congressional testimony given in 1987.
   The government made the assertion in a federal court filing
urging rejection of North's request for a post-trial hearing on the
issue.
   In his testimony on Capitol Hill, North detailed many of the
activities for which he was later accused of crimes, including the
three felonies for which he was ultimately convicted.
   Under a 1972 Supreme Court ruling, the office of independent
counsel Lawrence Walsh is required to show that its evidence wasn't
derived from North's immunized testimony.
   North's lawyers are seeking the hearing in an attempt to get the
case against him dismissed. They have said the grand jury that
indicted him and the jury that convicted him might have been
tainted by exposure to his immunized testimony.
   But prosecutor David Zornow's response said the government
demonstrated before and during the trial that its evidence had been
collected without taint from North's 1987 testimony.
   Zornow said the allegation that the juries may have been tainted
was ``speculation'' that was ``unfounded and irrelevant.''
   ``The thorough inquiry which the court has already made on the
grand jury issue more than sufficiently discharges any supervisory
duties that the court may have,'' the prosecution asserted.
   The prosecution also said the court and lawyers conducted a
``searching'' questioning of jurors in the North case before trial
regarding any possible exposure to North's congressional testimony.
   The ex-National Security Council aide was found guilty May 4 of
aiding and abetting an obstruction of Congress, altering and
destroying classified documents and accepting an illegal gratuity.
   North also is asking U.S. District Court Judge Gerhard A. Gesell
to require that each member of the prosecution team be subjected to
questioning at a hearing on possible taint from North's immunized
testimony.
   ``The government demonstrated before trial the extensive
procedures adopted by independent counsel to insulate his staff,
including the three associate counsels who tried the case,'' said
Zornow.

<HEAD>Pig Carcass Study Could Help Police Find Buried Bodies</HEAD>

<DATELINE>AURORA, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Law enforcement officials and scientists
from across the nation met here Friday to learn more about finding
buried bodies by using an unusual study of buried pig carcasses.
   ``Pigs come closest to humans in bone structure, blood type,''
said Kim Castellano, an investigator with the Douglas County
sheriff's office.
   Her agency and the Arapahoe County sheriff's office began the
buried pig carcass study last fall, dubbing the project PIGS for
``Pigs In the Ground Study.''
   On Friday, the Rocky Mountain Division of the International
Association of Identification opened a two-day conference that drew
140 law enforcement officials and scientists.
   ``This is groundbreaking research. No one has really studied the
effects on buried bodies for law enforcement purposes,'' said Steve
Adams, president of the Rocky Mountain division and a detective
with the Aurora Police Department.
   Volunteer scientists and law enforcement personnel have been
studying pig burial sites at the Highlands Ranch Law Enforcement
Training Facility since last September.
   Investigators said they have observed changes at the sites such
as different plants growing around the graves. They have collected
insects that appear at the sites _ above and below ground _ and
gases emitted from the ground.
   The study has employed bloodhounds, aerial photography and
infrared sensing devices, too, during what may become a five-year
project, officials said.
   The idea of using buried pigs was developed last summer.
Investigators from the Arapahoe and Douglas County sheriff's
departments and the Colorado Bureau of Investigation found
themselves talking about how difficult and expensive it is to
search for hidden bodies.
   The immediate results of the innovative study have been so
dramatic that the Rocky Mountain division has attracted its largest
conference audience ever, said Tom Griffin of the CBI.
   ``This is the most unusual conference in law enforcement I've
ever seen with one effort,'' said Douglas County Sheriff Steve
Zotos.
   ``The main thing that surprised me was the accuracy of the
bloodhounds'' in locating the pig carcasses, said Castellano.
``They went right to the pigs.''
   Conferees have come from as far away as Fairbanks, Alaska, and
Illinois and Texas and represent all branches of law enforcement
from local police department to the FBI, organizers said.
   The research project also has brought in entomologists,
botanists, anthropologists, geologists, archeologists and
geophysicists.
   After a concluding panel discussion Saturday, the conferees were
expected to go out to the actual burial sites to study firsthand
the clues and observe the changes in the areas.

<TEXT>
   A 17-year-old British math prodigy has
accepted a one-year post as a visiting lecturer at Harvard
University, becoming one of the youngest Ivy League faculty members
ever, Harvard officials said Friday.
   Ruth J. Lawrence was taught by her father in their home in
Huddersfield, England, and had never been to school before she
entered Oxford University at age 11 in 1983.
   She graduated from the prestigious British university just two
years later, at age 13, and expects to receive a doctorate in
mathematics there this year.
   ``She's a very pleasant, well-balanced person, happy to talk
about various topics and not particularly aggressive or
particularly shy,'' said Vaughan Jones, a professor of mathematics
at the University of California at Berkeley.
   Lawrence was courted by several leading American universities,
including Berkeley and the Institute for Advanced Studies at
Princeton University in New Jersey, before she accepted Harvard's
offer.
   Jones, who has visited Lawrence in England, said she is a
vegetarian and likes bicycling on a tandem bike with her father, a
computer consultant.
   While at Oxford, she earned a reputation as ``the best
undergraduate ever in math there,'' Jones added.
   Harvard officials said she will arrive in the fall and spend her
first semester in Cambridge doing research, free of teaching
responsibilities. In the spring, she is scheduled to lead a
graduate seminar on knot theory, an area of theoretical mathematics
dealing with knots and similar curved, three dimensional objects.
   Keith Ramsey, a graduate student in math at Harvard, said
students and faculty are curious to hear the British wunderkind.
   ``There's been a lot of attention given to the fact that she's a
teen-ager, but I think that most of the interest we have is, in
fact, going to be in what she does, rather than in her being a
prodigy,'' he said.
   Harvard officials said they believed Lawrence would be the
youngest woman faculty member in the Ivy League.
   Iris Milotsky, a spokeswoman for the American Association of
University Professors in Washington, said a handful of child
prodigies previously have taught at top universities.
   ``It's certainly unusual, but not unprecedented,'' she said.
   One of the most famous of the prodigies was Cotton Mather, who
entered Harvard at the age of 12 and received his degree three
years later, in 1678.

<HEAD>Report Says Palestinian Allegedly Executed by Israeli Soldiers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Amnesty International said Friday that witnesses
alleged that Israeli soldiers summarily executed a Palestinian
activist in a West Bank village in February.
   The London-based human rights organization demanded that Israeli
authorities urgently investigate the death of Atwah Lufti Umar
Hirzallah, 26, in Deir Abziye near Ramallah.
   It said the Jerusalem Post quoted unidentified Israeli military
sources on March 1 as saying people trying to block a road hurled
rocks at a passing military patrol and soldiers fired, killing
Hirzallah, because they feared their lives were endangered.
   Amnesty said witnesses gave this account in sworn statements:
   Hirzallah and four others walked into Deir Abziye around 9 p.m.
on Feb. 27 after taking home to a nearby village a friend who was
wounded in earlier clashes with Israeli soldiers.
   The five were stopped by two Israeli soldiers who had been
waiting concealed behind a wall and were ordered to raise their
hands.
   One soldier turned a flashlight on them, then focused it on
Hirzallah, and the other soldier shot Hirzallah with an M16 rifle
at almost point-blank range.
   The soldiers told the others to sit on the ground and villagers
later were allowed to take Hirzallah to Ramallah Hospital, where he
was pronounced dead.
   The victim's family was ordered to bury the body within hours.
   Amnesty said it telexed Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir on April
28 saying it was ready to turn over the statements to an impartial
inquiry authority if assurances were given that the witnesses would
not be endangered. It said no response was received.
   The statement said Amnesty previously requested investigations
into the killings of Palestinians during the 17-month-old uprising
against Israeli occupation in the West Bank and Gaza Strip and
``this is the first time it has expressed fears of one being the
result of a deliberate extrajudicial execution.''

   Belgium decided to recall its
ambassador in Romania on Friday, one day after a leading Belgian
politician was beaten when he tried to meet with a Romanian
dissident.
   Gerard Deprez, chairman of the Belgian Christian Democratic
Party and a member of the European Parliament, tried twice Thursday
evening to meet in Kluj, Romania, with Donia Cornea, a leading
dissident who is under virtual house arrest, party spokesmen said
on condition of anonymity.
   The fate of Mrs. Cornea, who has been harrassed for a year by
Romanian authorities, was widely publicized in the West last year
by Belgian television.
   Deprez was first stopped by a dozen plainclothesmen, the sources
said. When he tried a second time, he was beaten by policemen who
took his money, they added.
   Belgian Foreign Minister Leo Tindemans Friday decided to recall
the Belgian ambassador in Bucharest and summoned the Romanian
ambassador to a meeting on Monday.
   Deprez gave up trying to meet with Mrs. Cornea and returned to
Bucharest, from where he will fly back to Brussels Saturday, his
party said.
   The Paris-based Romanian League of Human Rights reported Friday
that Dan Sempeleanu, a Romanian professor of English, was severely
beaten during 18 hours of detention after he tried to meet with
Mrs. Cornea on April 12.
   Sempeleanu reportedly signed a recent letter to President
Nicolae Ceausescu protesting a major village destruction program
which is to set aside new agricultural land for state farms, said
league member Mihnea Berindei in a telephone call from Paris.
   Berindei also said three workers from Sarnesti near Brasov met
with a similar fate when they tried to meet with Mrs. Cornea on May
1. He said the three, who also signed the letter to Ceausescu, are
believed to be still under arrest.

   Two people were injured in an

approaching Dar es Salaam Thursday that there was ``an attempt to
hijack the plane by unidentified persons.''
   ``However, it is believed the hijackers were overpowered by
security guards inside the plane,'' Uhuru said.
   It said Tanzanian explosive experts found a hand grenade when
they searched the plane.
   The newspaper made no mention of whether the attempted hijack
took place in Tanzanian, Zambian or Angolan airspace or if the
Aeroflot flight was scheduled.
   Uhuru quoted witnesses as saying two injured, one seriously,
were taken to the hospital in Dar es Salaam when the jet landed.

<HEAD>Britain Plans to Restrict Cross-Ownership in Media</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government outlined proposals Friday to limit
cross-ownership of newspapers and broadcast outlets in an attempt
to prevent control from falling into a few hands.
   Home Secretary Douglas Hurd said owners of national newspapers
would be prohibited from having more than a 20 percent stake in any
independent television station, new radio stations and the
satellite channels directly awarded by the government.
   The ownership restrictions could hamper the expansion plans of
Britain's biggest media investors, notably Rupert Murdoch's News
Corp. and publisher Robert Maxwell. Both already own major
newspapers.
   Murdoch's company also controls Britain's only satellite
station, Sky Television.
   Maxwell's interests include holdings in cable television and a
planned satellite station. He also has expressed his intention to
bid for a new television license the government plans to offer.
   Owners would not be forced to sell properties they now hold,
said a spokeswoman for the Home Office, who was not identified in
accordance with British practice.
   Under the proposals, regional and local newspapers would be
limited to a 20 percent share of any regional TV and radio licenses
in their geographic areas.
   The same 20 percent limit would be placed on cross-interests
between direct broadcast satellite companies, independent TV and
national radio license holders.
   In a written response to a question in the House of Parliament,
Hurd said the proposed controls underscored the government's
determination that ownership in the independent broadcasting sector
should remain ``widely spread, and that unhealthy concentrations of
ownership and excessive cross-media ownership should be prevented.''
   A comprehensive broadcasting bill including the proposals will
be presented to Parliament late this year.

   Energy Secretary James D. Watkins said Friday
he was adding a new supervisory office at the troubled Savannah
River nuclear weapons plant in South Carolina to improve the
department's oversight of the aging complex.
   Watkins announced the establishment of a Special Projects
Office, starting June 1, at Savannah River. Its director, whom he
did not identify, will report directly to the assistant secretary
for defense programs at department headquarters.
   The director will be charged with keeping headquarters informed
of all matters relating to the restart of Savannah River's nuclear
reactors, which are being overhauled.
   Watkins also said the manager of the existing department office
at Savannah River would report to the assistant secretary for
defense instead of to a headquarters official who is not directly
responsible for defense programs.
   ``Establishment of direct line management responsibility is
essential to assure the successful accomplishment of major DOE
programs, including the Savannah River restart effort,'' Watkins
said in a written statement.
   The three Savannah River reactors, which make a gas used in
nuclear warheads, have been shut down for safety reasons since last
spring. Watkins has said he intends to get them running again by
early next year.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Two peasants were killed and nine
homes destroyed in confrontations with soldiers during a land
dispute in northern Haiti, radio stations reported Friday.
   Radio Haiti Inter said soldiers trying to settle a disagreement
over land in Grand Bois, 50 miles north of the capital, fought with
rock-throwing peasants Tuesday, killing a youth named Regis Charlo
and wounding three people.
   It said the soldiers had responded to a call for help from
Charite Joseph, an alleged member of the former Duvalier family
dictatorship's Tontons Macoutes militia, who was involved in the
dispute.
   The station said peasants retaliated by beheading Joseph's
mother, Ginette Dor, with a machete and burning down three houses
belonging to a local sheriff.
   On Wednesday, 30 soldiers from the garrison in nearby St. Marc
went to Grand Bois and burned down six houses belonging to
peasants, the reports said.
   Radio Soleil, the Roman Catholic station, said Joseph inherited
the land from Zacharie Delva, an infamous voodoo priest and
spiritual adviser to Francois ``Papa Doc'' Duvalier, who ruled
Haiti from 1957 until his death in 1971.
   Peasants have disputed Joseph's title to the land since the
family dictatorship ended with the flight of President Jean-Claude
Duvalier, the dictator's son, in February 1986.

   Representatives of at least 22,000 striking
teachers and school officials negotiated for a second day Friday as
the first week of the walkout ended with high absenteeism and
wasted cafeteria food.
   Only 259,120 students in the nation's second largest school
district came to class Friday out of a total enrollment of 551,759,
said district spokesman Shel Erlich. The week started with 329,000
students reporting.
   A total of 11,113 credentialed teachers showed up Friday,
including 8,660 regular teachers and 2,453 substitutes. Normally
there are 26,250 teachers.
   The United Teachers-Los Angeles union and the Los Angeles
Unified School District continued talks under a news blackout
imposed by a state mediator.
   ``At this point I'm cautiously optimistic that maybe we can move
forward. I hope those hopes are not dashed this afternoon at the
meeting,'' said UTLA President Wayne Johnson at a downtown rally
that drew about 2,000 strikers.
   With student attendance nearly cut in half, cafeteria workers
face a nearly impossible game of guessing how much food to prepare
each day. The result has been considerable waste.
   Only 112 of the district's 573 school kitchens have signed up
for a program to donate unused food to various agencies, said Carol
Noelting, deputy director of the food services branch.
   ``We did another mailing to the schools recently, to see if we
could drum up more business,'' she said.
   The UTLA represents 22,000 of the district's 32,000 teachers,
counselors, nurses and librarians.
   Some strikers have applied in the adjacent districts of
Alhambra, Arcadia, La Canada, and South Pasadena, but none have
been hired.
   Since the disclosure Wednesday that the state will enjoy a $2.5
billion tax surplus over the next two years, several wage offers
have been made.
   Johnson said he was confident some of the surplus would go to
the Los Angeles school district under Proposition 98, which
designates for public schools virtually all surplus funds above a
certain expenditure limit.
   He said the union would like a three-year contract with a 26
percent raise, including a 10 percent raise the first year.
   The district said it could not sweeten its 21.5 percent offer
over three years until it was sure it had the funds, but offered a
contingency wage package of 24 percent over three years if it did
receive some of the money.
   The strike is the district's first since a 23-day walkout in
1970.
   Currently, teachers annually earn from $23,440 in beginning pay
to $43,319 to those with doctorates, 98 extra course units and 19
years' experience.
   Administrators' salaries start at $37,000 for program
coordinators and $95,600 for associate superintendents. Britton
earns $141,000 as superintendent.

<HEAD>Fugitive In Medicaid Fraud Waives Extradition</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A fugitive captured in Arizona after his case
was depicted on the national TV program ``Unsolved Mysteries''
waived extradition Friday to New York, where he will go to prison
for a $16 million Medicaid fraud.
   Sheldon Weinberg, 64, was being returned to New York by agents
of the state special prosecutor for nursing homes, health and
social services, authorities said.
   Weinberg was arrested Wednesday night in Scottsdale, Ariz., just
hours after his case was detailed on the NBC program. Hundreds of
viewers phoned in tips, and a caller gave the FBI Weinberg's alias
and address at a garden-apartment complex.
   Weinberg and his two sons were convicted Nov. 30, 1988, of
defrauding the health care program of more than $16 million from
1980 to 1987, which was the largest such theft in the 22 years of
the Medicaid program.
   Weinberg, free on $250,000 bail, didn't show up at his Jan. 10
sentencing, prompting a nationwide manhunt. He was sentenced in
absentia to seven to 21 years in prison, and will have to serve
that term in addition to any sentence imposed for fleeing justice.
   Deputy Attorney General Edward J. Kuriansky, the special
prosecutor, said Weinberg used money from false Medicaid billings
to finance an $18,000-a-month apartment in Manhattan's Trump Tower,
a $5 million lakefront mansion in Boca Raton, Fla., yachts and a
fleet of custom cars.
   Medicaid is a government program to pay for health care for poor
people.

<HEAD>US Official Sees Some Hope for Angola Settlement</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An eight-nation African summit meeting this
week has produced the first hopes of a greater willingness by the
Angolan government to enter into serious peace negotiations with
U.S.-backed rebels, a Bush administration official said Friday.
   But a representative of the rebel group here said he saw no
change in the Angolan government's position.
   Although details of the meeting remain sketchy, the U.S.
official said Angolan President Eduardo Dos Santos for the first
time expressed support for the concept of ``reconciliation'' with
the UNITA rebels.
   ``Reconciliation can only come in the context of negotiation,''
said the official, asking not to be identified. He noted that
Angola's Marxist government has steadfastly refused to engage in
such talks with the anti-communist insurgents.
   UNITA's longstanding policy has been to promote negotiations
leading to national reconciliation and ultimately to free,
multi-party elections.
   The summit meeting, held last Tuesday in the Angolan capital of
Luanda, marked a departure from the Angolan government's prior
insistence that neighboring countries not have a role in seeking a
solution to the country's destructive, 14-year-old civil war.
   At one point, the official, speaking to a small group of
reporters, alluded to the possibility of a ``breakthrough'' in the
Angola deadlock but acknowledged that State Department information
on the details of the Angolan government's position was thin.
   Last December, the United States brokered an agreement that
calls for independence and black majority rule in Namibia coupled
with the withdrawal of Cuban forces in Angola over a 27-month
period.
   U.S. officials have been encouraging Angola to open serious
negotiations with UNITA sooner rather than later because the
country's negotiating position will weaken as the number of Cuban
troops declines.
   According to official estimates, the Cuban presence has dropped
by about 8,000 since the agreement was signed five months ago. The
total now is believed to be about 44,000.
   Apprised of the U.S. official's position, a local UNITA
representative, Jardo Mukeilia said, ``I don't necessarily share
his optimism.''
   The Angolan government is still insisting the UNITA rebels lay
down their arms and then reintegrate into Angolan society as part
of a national reconstruction effort, he said.
   He added that Dos Santos referred to ``reconciliation in the
context of amnesty and clemency,'' and not as the result of a
negotiating process.
   In addition to Angola, the nations attending the Luanda meeting
were Zambia, Zimbabwe, Zaire, the Congo, Gabon, Mozambique and Sao
Tome y Principe.

<HEAD>Independence Plan for Namibia to Proceed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hostilities have ceased between
South African troops and guerrillas, clearing the way for the
independence plan for Namibia to proceed, a three-nation commission
said Friday.
   Representatives of South Africa, Angola and Cuba, joined by
Soviet and American observers, said they had received confirmation
``that South African forces were again confined to base and that a
de facto cessation of hostilities existed in the northern area of
Namibia.''
   The statement, issued at a meeting in Cahama, Angola, said,
``additional measures to avoid further interruption of the peace
process'' were discussed.
   It said Angola and the U.N. Transition Assistance Group informed
the commission that guerrillas of the South-West African People's
Organization in Angola ``were confined to bases north of the 16th
parallel under UNTAG monitoring.''
   The commission recommended resumption of the U.N.-sponsored plan
to have elections in Namibia, also known as South-West Africa, in
November.
   The independence process was interrupted April 1, the day it
started, when South Africa reported hundreds of guerrillas had
crossed into Namibia from Angola. Namibian officials said 316
guerrillas and 27 security force members were killed in the
fighting as South African troops left their bases to engage the
rebels.
   SWAPO leaders recalled their guerrillas to Angola, but South
Africa demanded assurances that they would be restricted to their
bases.
   That assurance was given Friday by Martti Ahtisaari, the U.N.
special representative for Namibia, and Louis Pienaar, the South
African-appointed territorial administrator who will run Namibia
until a new government is installed.
   Under the U.N. plan the guerrillas and thousands of other
Namibians who fled the territory during the rebels' 23-year battle
for independence will be allowed to return, unarmed, to participate
in the elections.
   Angola, South Africa and Cuba reached agreement late last year
on the independence accord that includes the withdrawal of Cuban
troops in Angola to support the Marxist government.
   South Africa has administered Namibia since World War I.

   Robert Webber, a prolific character actor
whose face was as recognizable as his name was unknown, has died
from Lou Gehrig's disease. He was 64, and had been ill since last
fall.
   Featured in hundreds of television episodes and dozens of
feature films, Webber most recently played roles including Cybill
Shepherd's father in ``Moonlighting'' and the prosecutor in the
1987 Barbra Streisand film ``Nuts.''
   He died Wednesday at his home, his agent, Mary Oreck, said
Friday. Lou Gehrig's disease, or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, is
a progressive degeneration of the nerve cells that govern muscular
movement.
   The sharp-featured, silver-haired actor, who often played
tainted businessmen and elegant crooks, said he had appeared in
more than 400 television roles when he stopped counting them in the
early 1960s.
   Webber was a well-known presence in television shows such as
``The Rockford Files,'' ``Cannon,'' ``Kojak,'' ``The Streets of San
Francisco,'' ``McCloud,'' ``Barnaby Jones,'' ``Quincy'' and
``Mannix.''
   His film credits included ``Twelve Angry Men,'' ``Harper,''
``The Dirty Dozen,'' ``Revenge of the Pink Panther,'' ``10,''
``Private Benjamin'' and ``S.O.B.''
   Born in Santa Ana, Webber was the son of a merchant seaman and
made his first stage appearance in a Oakland school play in 1941.
After serving in the Marine Corps during World War II, he was given
a screen test by Universal, but a studio executive advised him to
continue his theater work.
   Following 2{ years in summer stock, Webber made his debut on
Broadway with a nine-line part in ``Two Blind Mice'' in 1948. He
subsequently replaced Richard Basehart in ``Goodbye My Fancy,''
opposite Madeline Carroll.
   His first film appearance came in 1951 as a gangster in
``Highway 301.'' Later that decade, Webber was seen in ``The Philco
Playhouse,'' ``The Hallmark Hall of Fame'' and ``Robert Montgomery
Presents'' and the plays ``No Time for Sergeants,'' ``Orpheus
Descending,'' ``Wonderful Town'' an ``A Loss of Roses.''
   He co-starred as the glib Juror No. 12 with Henry Fonda, Lee J.
Cobb and Jack Klugman in 1957's ``Twelve Angry Men,'' and then
appeared in the television shows ``The Rifleman,'' ``Maverick,''
``The Dick Powell Show,'' ``Alfred Hitchcock Presents,'' ``Route
66,'' ``The Defenders,'' ``Naked City,'' ``Ben Casey,'' ``The
Fugitive'' and ``The Outer Limits.''
   In the 1960s, he starred in the movies ``The Stripper,'' ``The
Sandpiper,'' ``Harper'' and ``The Dirty Dozen.''
   His film roles also included ``The Great White Hope,'' ``Casey's
Shadow,'' ``Dollars,'' ``Midway,'' ``The Choirboys,'' ``Sunday
Lovers,'' ``Wrong is Right'' and ``Wild Geese II.''
   Webber is survived by his wife, Del, and father, Robert. Funeral
arrangements were private.

   The manager of a credit union accused of
diverting as much as $39 million in funds to his own use was
arrested Friday on charges of fraud and violation of federal income
tax laws.
   Lawrence E. King, 44, was charged in a 40-count federal
indictment before U.S. Magistrate Richard Kopf. King's wife, Alice,
was also arrested on charges of violating federal income tax law.
   Both were released without bond and ordered to report to court
May 23.
   The National Credit Union Administration shut down Franklin
Community Federal Credit Union in November, alleging in civil
lawsuits that as much as $39 million was missing from its coffers
and accusing King of taking the money.
   Losses at the credit union were estimated Friday at $41.8
million.
   King, 44, who is black, has denied any wrongdoing and said he is
the victim of racial discrimination.
   The indictment opened Friday named King in on charges of
conspiracy, mail fraud, wire fraud, bank fraud, credit union
embezzlement, making false entries in credit union records and
filing false tax returns.
   The indictment accused Mrs. King, 42, of 12 counts for alleged
conspiracy, wire fraud and bank fraud.
   Also indicted were Noel Seltzer, Larry J. Murphy and Robert
Morley, all former development officers of the credit union and the
Consumer Services Organization, of which King was president.
   All three were charged with two counts each of filing false tax
returns, and Morley additionally was charged with one count of
perjury before the federal grand jury.
   The Omaha World-Herald said among those who testified before the
grand jury was E. Thomas Harvey Jr., who supervised Franklin's
accounting department. Harvey was not named in the indictment.

   Two men of Arab origin were arraigned
on Friday on charges of complicity in four terrorist bombings in
Scandinavia and Holland.
   Swedish Television said the men were linked to the Syrian-based
Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command. An
official statement said the two were about 35 years old, but did
not identify them by name.
   An announcement by Chief Prosecutor Stefan Karlmark said police
were questioning the two in relation to two bomb attacks in
Denmark, one in Sweden and one in Amsterdam in 1985-86.
   The bombing of a Northwest Orient Airline office in Copenhagen
in May 1985 killed one person, the statement said.
   The two were among 15 people rounded up by security police
Thursday. A police statement said 10 were released after
questioning and three others were held over in robbery
investigations.
   The PFLP-GC organization is a major supect in the bombing of Pan
American Flight 103 over Scotland last December, which killed 270
people. The police statement made no reference to that attack.

   Burmese troops on Friday shelled a
rebel stronghold in the offensive to crush a 40-year-old insurgency
in eastern Karen state, a Thai border patrol officer reported.
   He said soldiers peppered the Kaw Moo Ra camp rebel camp, just
across the Moei River from Thailand, with mortar shells.
   The officer, speaking with the condition he not be identified,
estimated that about 1,200 Karen guerrillas are defending the camp
against about 3,000 soldiers.
   Government forces began shelling Kaw Moo Ra on Thursday, two
days after overrunning the major rebel base of Wangkha, 1{ miles to
the south.
   Wangkha was the fifth Karen strongold to be captured by army
units since the government launched an offensive in December.
   A government spokesman told a news conference Friday in Rangoon,
the Burmese capital, that at least 43 rebels were killed in the
battle for Wangkha. He said 35 soldiers were killed and 95 wounded.
   The Burmese government has said 600 guerrillas and 177 soldiers
perished in the battle for Maela _ the last camp to fall before
Wangkha.
   The five captured camps are in a 75-mile arc hugging the border
along Thailand's Mae Sot district.
   Kaw Moo Ra is 140 miles east of Rangoon and across the border
from the Thai town of Mae Sot.
   Thai officials say the government offensive has disrupted the
cross-border black market trade that provided the Karens with funds
for their insurgency. The Karen National Union has an estimated
4,000 combatants and is the largest of a dozen ethnic groups
battling the Burmese government.
   Karens began their revolt in 1949, a year after Burma achieved
independence from Great Britain, saying the government reneged on
its promise of more autonomy for ethnic minorities.
   The Karen rebels gained unexpected support when thousands of
students joined them after the bloody crackdown by the government
on student-led campaigns for democracy.
   On Thursday, Burmese government spokesman Kyaw Sann said 3,056
students have returned home from border areas and legal action
would be taken against those who remained with the rebels.

<HEAD>Group Urges Boost in Defense Spending</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KOZO MIZOGUCHI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A large industrial organization is urging the
government to more than double its spending on defense-related
research and development.
   Cricis claim the suggestion by the Federation of Economic
Organizations, known as Keidanren, is aimed at making the nation a
military power.
   In a report submitted to the Defense Agency, Keidanren said the
share of research and development expenditures in the defense
budget ``should be increased to more than 5 percent, the minimum
share allotted ... in major Western advanced countries.''
   A Defense Agency official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said Friday the federation's suggestion would be considered in
preparing the new defense plan. The current five-year plan totaling
$76.5 billion ends in 1990.
   In the defense budget for fiscal 1989, which began April 1, $595
million was allotted for research and development. That is 2.1
percent of the total defense budget, which is expected to be
approved later this month.
   The United States earmarked 12.3 percent of its defense budget
to research and development in 1988. That would be about 104 times
the amount spent by Japan.
   Britain spent 11.7 percent of its defense budget on research and
West Germany 5.4 percent, according to Defense Agency figures.
   Keidanren's suggestion was not made in connection with the joint
U.S.-Japan project to co-produce Japan's next generation jet
fighter known as the FSX, according to Masao Kanamori, who led the
federation's 80-member committee that compiled the report.
   The FSX project was approved Tuesday after long debate by the
U.S. Senate with an amendment insisting the United States be given
more than 40 percent of the production work. Some congressmen
criticized the project as a giveaway of U.S. technology.
   The congressional debate led some Japanese to question Japan's
reliance on U.S. technology for its defense.
   Japan originally wanted to produce the FSX on its own but agreed
to joint production under U.S. pressure.
   Most of Japan's defense-related hardware, including its F-15
jets, is produced by Japanese manufacturers under license from the
original U.S. makers.
   Keidanren officials want Japan to develop its own defense
technology.
   ``A one-sided flow of technology is not good,'' Kanamori told
reporters recently. He is the chairman of Mitsubishi Heavy
Industries Ltd., Japan's leading defense contractor.
   In its report Keidanren called on the government to accelerate
construction of large-scale facilities that ``exceed private-sector
capabilities'' such as wind tunnels used in tests for aircraft
engines and missile ranges.
   There is no testing range for long-distance missiles in Japan,
and Defense Agency personnel conduct missile training at a U.S.
Army facility near El Paso, Texas.
   ``Japan's commercial technology is outstanding and now they
(Japanese businesses) are challenging military technology,'' said
Haruo Fujii, a commentator on military affairs. ``Japan may rely on
U.S. technology during the next 10 to 20 years, but Japanese
industry wants this country to become a military power that
requires no dependence on Americans.''
   Under the present five-year plan Japan's self-defense capability
is to be raised to enable its armed forces to repulse a ``limited,
small-scale'' attack. Japan's 240,000-member Self-Defense Forces is
the only customer for its military industry. Arms exports are
banned, although Japan can transfer defense technology to the
United States under an accord.
   Japan's constitution, drafted by U.S. occupation forces after
World War II, renounces war. The issue of a military buildup is
sensitive in Japan and in other Asian countries seized by Japanese
forces during the war.

   Former Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos was
said to be responding to treatment Friday for kidney, heart and
lung failure, pneumonia and bacterial infections but hospital
officials said he remained in critical condition.
   ``His condition is episodic,'' said Gene Tiwanak, assistant
administrator of St. Francis Medical Center. ``It rises and falls,
and in this case he is rallying.''
   Marcos remained on kidney dialysis and a respirator in the
hospital's intensive care unit, and is drifting in and out of
consciousness, Tiwanak said. His prognosis is still very poor, he
said.
   ``It is very serious, but he's hanging on,'' Imelda Marcos, wife
of the 71-year-old deposed leader, told reporters with a smile as
she arrived at the hospital Friday afternoon and was escorted into
the hospital chapel.
   Earlier in the day, Mrs. Marcos told reporters that her
husband's fever was rising, and she said in a telephone interview
from her home that doctors fear for Marcos' life and that he could
``go any time.''
   However, a hospital source who spoke on condition of anonymity
told The Associated Press that Marcos was responding to treatment.
   Art Aruiza, a top Marcos aide, said Marcos was sleeping most of
the time and ``is better, well, not as bad as it was yesterday.''
   Marcos has been hospitalized for more than four months but his
condition worsened this week.
   He was lapsing in and out of consciousness following a surgical
procedure Thursday to prepare him for kidney dialysis, said Dr.
Azucena Ignacio, one of Marcos' attending physicians.
   Mrs. Marcos was at the hospital early Friday but returned home.
She planned to return later in the day.
   Marcos' son, Ferdinand Jr., and sister, Fortuna Barba, also were
at the hospital. The couple's daughter, Irene Araneta, was heading
to Hawaii on Friday from her home in Woodside, Calif., said Joe
Lazo, a family friend.
   Mrs. Marcos made a public appeal to Philippine President Corazon
Aquino to allow Marcos to return to his homeland to die.
   Mrs. Aquino said she would not allow Marcos to return and would
not permit him to be buried on Philippine soil, out of concern his
presence would spark unrest.
   ``Much as I agree that Mr. Marcos has his rights, I still have
to consider also the rights and interests of millions of
Filipinos,'' said Mrs. Aquino, who succeeded Marcos following a
popular uprising in February 1986.
   ``I'm confident that sooner or later, the Filipino people will
allow him to come home because there is no reason not to,'' said
Mrs. Marcos when she emerged from the hospital chapel, clutching a
rosary in her hands.
   Tomas ``Buddy'' Gomez, Philippine consul general in Honolulu,
acknowledged that Marcos is ill, but said reports on his condition
have been exaggerated.
   ``There is an obvious element of exaggeration and orchestration
here,'' he said.
   Report of Marcos' condition were released in Manila by a
pro-Marcos radio station before the hospital released information
in Honolulu, Gomez said.
   Marcos has been hospitalized since Jan. 15. He was returned to
the intensive care unit on Monday and lapsed into critical
condition Tuesday. It was the third time he had been hospitalized
since early December.
   The Marcoses are under federal indictment, accused of stealing
more than $100 million from the Philippine treasury to buy art and
real estate in New York. In April a judge ruled that Marcos was too
ill to stand trial, but Mrs. Marcos remains charged. She is free on
$5 million bail.
   The couple have lived in exile in Hawaii since fleeing the
Philippines in February 1986.

<HEAD>Ex-Defense Official Says Stealth Program Should End</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pentagon's former chief of procurement
said he argued unsuccessfully to end the B-2 stealth bomber program
because of rising cost and concerns about quality and management.
   ``I have serious and grave concerns,'' said Robert B. Costello,
who last week stepped down from his Pentagon post. ``The quality
issues on the B-2 are a significant concern to me.''
   However, he said, the Joint Chiefs of Staff insisted the B-2 was
the only program that could penetrate Soviet air defenses and put
targets at risk.
   He also said he had more than one heated meeting with Thomas V.
Jones, chairman of Los Angeles-based Northrop Corp., the plane's
principal contractor. Costello, former undersecretary of
acquisitions, said that Northrop's quality controls on development
and production of the planes is ``terrible,'' The Washington Post
reported in its Friday editions.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and Deputy Secretary of Defense
Donald Atwood are scheduled to visit Northrop next Friday to
examine the bomber.
   Jones and other Northrop officials vigorously defend the bomber.
Jones has called it ``an extraordinary new aircraft system.''
   The Northrop chairman told his company's annual shareholders
meeting Wednesday that the B-2's ``unprecedented technical
successes'' will eventually be realized.
   Former Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci fought efforts by
Costello to kill the program, the Post said. But his successor,
Cheney, has delayed full-scale production of the bomber by a year
and critics are calling for a longer delay to allow more time for
testing.
   Its first flight is scheduled for this summer, about 18 months
behind schedule.
   Unidentified members of Costello's staff told the Los Angeles
Times that a confidential internal cost analysis shows the price
for the bombers has soared to $750 million per aircraft, the
newspaper reported Friday.
   Jones estimated the cost at $265 million per plane, a price that

   The doctor who arranged for a baby boy to be
given to Joel Steinberg and who pleaded guilty to illegally placing
a baby for adoption lost his state medical license Friday.
   Peter J. Sarosi's license was revoked because of his role in
placing the boy with Steinberg, who was convicted of manslaughter
in the death of another illegally adopted child, 6-year-old Lisa,
said Emlyn Griffith, chairman of the sttate Board of Regents'
Committee on Professional Practice.
   The board, which oversees professional licensing in the state,
voted 14-0 to revoke Sarosi's license, Griffith said.
   Sarosi, 36, may apply for reinstatement after one year. He did
not return calls, but a woman in his office said he has been seeing
patients all week.
   The doctor pleaded guilty in January to ``illegally placing a
child out for adoption,'' a misdemeanor punishable by up to a year
in jail. He admitted he delivered a boy born June 21, 1986, to
Nicole Smigiel, an unwed Long Island teen-ager, and illegally gave
the infant to Steinberg two days later.
   In sentencing Sarosi, Criminal Court Judge John Stackhouse
called him a ``highly respected and beloved physician.'' He put him
on three years probation, ordered him to do 100 hours of community
service, and fined him $1,000.
   Sarosi was gynecologist and fertility doctor for Hedda Nussabum,
Steinberg's live-in companion. She testified at Steinberg's trial
for Lisa's death that she had trouble conceiving so Steinberg
arranged with Sarosi to get a baby boy.
   The boy, called ``Mitchell'' by Steinberg, was found tied to a
playpen, drinking spoiled milk and wearing a soiled diaper when
police and paramedics arrived at Steinberg's apartment Nov. 5,
1987, to find Lisa unconscious.
   The toddler was returned to his mother and renamed Travis
Christian Smigiel. Lisa died a few days later of injuries the jury
decided were inflicted by Steinberg.

   West German Defense Minister Gerhard
Stoltenberg, ending two days of talks with Secretary of State James
A. Baker III, said the two had ``made progress'' in forging a
common stance on the future of NATO's short-range nuclear missiles.
   ``The overall discussions were very, very encouraging,'' the
defense minister said hours after a senior West German government
source said in Bonn that the United States and West Germany had
agreed in principle on a compromise.
   ``The Germans gave Secretary Baker a proposal on the short-range
nuclear forces issue,'' said a senior White House official. ``We
made a numer of changes and suggestions. Late today, the United
States returned a paper to the Germans with a number of explicit
conditions to consider. No responses have yet been received. As far
as we know, we do not have an agreement.''
   But the official said, ``It's fair to say there's been progress.
We are exchanging papers and studying specific language.''
   Asked if they expected to reach a compromise before a critical
NATO summit meeting opens May 29, the official said, ``Obviously,
we'd like to do that.''
   Stoltenberg, talking with reporters before a meeting with Vice
President Dan Quayle, declined to comment on whether there was an
agreement in principle on the issue, which has threatened to split
the alliance 10 days before the NATO summit meeting.
   Pressed on whether he and Baker had made progress, Stoltenberg
said:
   ``We work for a common position, so we have to argue and try to
come together. And we made progress.''
   One Washington diplomatic source close to the discussions said
Baker and Stoltenberg were trying to come to a ``gentleman's
agreement'' on the missile dilemma before the 16-nation NATO summit
meeting in Brussels May 29-30.
   But that source said no final agreement was expected to emerge
from the Baker-Stoltenberg discussions as both men wished to
consult with their superiors about their talks.
   At the State Department, Baker huddled with the defense minister
for an hour in an unusual one-on-one session before allowing other
officials to enter. It was their second round of talks in as many
days.
   The West Germans have insisted that the United States take the
Soviet Union up on its proposal to open talks on the arsenals of
short-range nuclear weapons maintained by NATO and the Warsaw Pact.
   The Bush administration has balked, saying such negotiations
would be a mistake because they would lead to the elimination of
the nuclear weapons NATO needs in the face of the Warsaw Pact's
superiority in conventional arms.
   Stoltenberg came to Washington to indicate that his government
was prepared to be more flexible about the timing of such
negotiations and that Bonn favored a compromise delaying formal
talks on the short-range missiles until there is significant
progress in cutting back the Soviet bloc's conventional forces.
   Stoltenberg was leaving Friday for Bonn and a meeting Sunday
with Chancellor Helmut Kohl, one source said.
   Baker flew to President Bush's retreat in Kennebunkport, Maine,
where the chief executive has summoned his top arms control
advisers to discuss NATO's nuclear arsenal.
   The president was also preparing a welcome for French President
Francois Mitterrand at the seaside retreat Saturday.
   The two leaders are expected to discuss the missile matter.
Mitterrand has spoken out against the elimination of the
short-range weapons, but has also said a NATO decision on replacing
the aging weapons need not be made before 1992.
   Earlier, the West German government source said in Bonn that the
United States had agreed to support the concept of negotiations to
reduce short-range missiles in return for West German assurances at
the NATO summit that the talks would not be aimed at removing all
such weapons.
   The Bonn source said West Germany would go along with the rest
of the alliance on a statement of unity that would make it clear
NATO does not yet seek the elimination of short-range nuclear
weapons, only reductions.
   The project to extend the range of the short-range NATO missiles
has been shelved until at least 1991, the official said.
   The United States and Britain have pressed NATO to move ahead
with updating its Lance short-range missiles and have said no talks
on the weapons should be agreed to until a conventional balance is
achieved with the Warsaw Pact.
   Most of the 88 Lance launchers and their 700 single-warhead
rockets are based in West Germany. With a present range of about 75
miles, they are considered battlefield weapons and are designed to
be put to use primarily on German territory.

   A cartoonist who draws a Hustler
magazine comic feature titled ``Chester the Molester'' was arrested
for investigation of molesting a teen-age girl, police said Friday.
   Police arrested Dwaine Tinsley, 43, at his home Thursday after
the girl told officers that she had been sexually molested, said
Lt. Bob Klamser. He declined to give the victim's age, although he
said she allegedly was molested for several years.
   The girl talked to police Wednesday. By Thursday, officers had a
search warrant and arrested Tinsley and searched his home in this
city about 40 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles.
   Klamser refused to talk about the search or say what evidence,
if any, had been seized.
   Tinsley was booked for investigation of child molestation and
bail was set at $100,000. He remained in custody Friday afternoon
and arraignment was scheduled for Monday.
   Tinsley has worked as cartoon and humor editor for LSP Inc., the
parent company of Hustler magazine and other publications, said
editorial director Tim Conaway.
   Conaway confirmed that Tinsley draws the ``Chester the
Molester'' cartoon, which depicts a lecherous character and his
attraction to young girls.
   Hustler is the sexually explicit magazine founded by
controversial publisher Larry Flynt.

   A bus tumbled 90 feet down an embankment
and landed upside down in a river in the Andes mountains Friday,
killing at least 50 people and injuring about 11, police said.
   Authorities said the 52-seat bus, overloaded with extra
passengers picked up along the way, had left Lima on a route taking
it through winding mountain roads to the city of Huancayo, 140
miles east.
   Officials with the Republican Guard, the police unit sent to the
disaster site, said that only passengers crammed into the aisle
were known to have survived.
   Passenger Nelly Suarez said the accident occurred when the
driver slammed on his brakes to avoid a pile of construction
material blocking a bridge over the Mantaro River.
   The bus never made it to the bridge, falling off the embankment
and landing upside down in the water.
   Mrs. Suarez escaped with minor injuries but her husband and
9-month-old baby were killed. The family got on the bus just
outside Lima and had to stand in the aisle.
   State official Abilio Fernandez said after visiting the accident
site that construction materials had been left at both ends of the
bridge to close it off while it was being repaired.
   Army and police rescue crews were called in. The injured were
sent to a hospital in nearby Jauja.

   An 80-year-old woman who has been picketing
in front of a courthouse for two years won the support of the local
NAACP chapter Friday in her bid to free her grandson from prison.
   Morgan Miller, 31, has been in prison for five years for an
armed robbery he contends he did not commit, and his case should be
reopened, said Lee Williams, local director of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
   Williams said he has read transcripts of the trial and looked
into the case. He said he was ``appalled'' at the number of
inconsistencies, including the fact that another man had confessed
to the robbery.
   ``This case was pushed through the court system without regard
to the facts. The system needs to right itself. I'm really
convinced he's innocent,'' Williams said.
   Williams said he has asked the national organization to
investigate the case and to hire Charles Carter, a lawyer who
helped free Lenell Jeter from a Texas jail. Jeter, a computer
programmer, was wrongly convicted of robbing a fast-food
restaurant, a judge ruled.
   Williams said the Miller case was brought to his attention by
Reaber Brown, who has been picketing twice a week for two years in
front of the Lucas County Courthouse. Ms. Brown sold her house to
pay for her grandson's legal fees.
   Lucas County Prosecutor Anthony Pizza said his office ``welcomes
anybody to look at the facts of the case. We have no problems with
that.''
   ``I feel sorry for his grandmother, but I commend her for her
persistence,'' Pizza said. ``But there isn't much more that can be
done at this point.''
   Miller was convicted of aggravated robbery and assault in 1984
in connection with the Dec. 14, 1983, robbery of a fast-food
restaurant in which a Toledo police officer was shot and wounded.
   Miller was sentenced to 20 to 40 years in prison and is in the
Lebanon Correctional Institution.
   Williams said a number of points were ignored during the trial.
He said Miller, a professional musician, had no police record.
   Miller is physicially similar to Joseph Clark, who allegedly
confessed to the holdup. Clark is on death row for two murders.
   Miller was identified by a witness from a group of men in which
he was the only black.
   Miller also said he was at the restaurant with a friend, who was
home on leave from the Navy, earlier the night it was robbed. When
Miller went on trial, the friend was supposed to testify, but did
not receive notice about the trial until several days after it had
ended.
   Pizza said Clark confessed to the holdup and later recanted the
story.
   According to an affidavit obtained by The Associated Press, two
prisoners who were in the same Lucas County jail cell with Clark on
April 24, 1984, said Clark bragged about several fast-food
restaurant robberies and shooting a Toledo police officer. The men
said one of the robberies was the one in which Miller was convicted.
   The 6th Ohio District Court of Appeals has upheld Miller's
conviction. Williams said he would want Miller to be retried or
Gov. Richard Celeste to grant Miller clemency.
   ``This young man has had a means of living and had not been in
trouble before. He became a victim of the system. We want to
correct that. He should not be in jail,'' Williams said.

<TEXT>
   President Bush met with top military
advisers at his seaside home Friday to review plans for a NATO
summit threatened by discord and to discuss strategy for arms talks
with the Soviet Union.
   As talks were under way in Washington to ease the NATO crisis,
Bush met at his vacation retreat with Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney, Joint Chiefs Chairman Adm. William Crowe, national security
adviser Brent Scowcroft and other aides. White House press
secretary Marlin Fitzwater said no final decisions would be
announced Friday from the meeting.
   Under cloudy skies and in chilly weather, Bush and his advisers
posed for pictures in front of the wind-swept sea wall near his
home but did not comment on their talks.
   The session came on the eve of the arrival here of French
President Francois Mitterrand, who generally backs Bush on the NATO
dispute.
   Mitterrand and his wife Danielle will spend the night in a guest
home on Bush's compound, located on a rocky point jutting out into
the Atlantic Ocean.
   NATO's harmony has been shaken by a dispute largely between the
United States and West Germany.
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, facing domestic pressure for
disarmament, has called for East-West negotiations soon on reducing
short-range nuclear weapons.
   Bush has rejected the idea, arguing Western Europe needs the
weapons to compensate for the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact's large
advantage in troops, tanks and other conventional forces.
   ``The SNF (short-range nuclear forces) issue of course is one
that's under consideration right now and is driving the meeting''
of Bush and his advisers, Fitzwater said.
   He said he did not know if a compromise could be struck before
the NATO meeting opening May 29.
   In Washington, Secretary of State James A. Baker III held a
second day of talks with West Germany defense minister Gerhard
Stoltenberg to try to resolve the dispute.
   Baker flew to Kennebunkport and joined Bush, Scowcroft and John
Curley, the U.S. ambassador to France, for a game of golf. Mugging
for cameras on the 18th hole, Bush admonished photographers to be
quiet.
   As the president prepared to swing, a baby cried. Bush stopped
and theatrically said, ``Please, this is very important. We're two
down.''
   White House chief of staff John Sununu also was to fly here
Friday.
   The West Germans also oppose a U.S.-British effort to more than
triple the range of existing Lance missiles to just below 300
miles. The aging, U.S.-built Lance now can hit targets from about
75 miles, and most of the 88 launchers and 700 single-warhead
missiles are based in West Germany.
   Mitterrand, at a news conference Thursday before leaving Paris,
spoke out against elimination of the short-range nuclear weapons
but said NATO did not have to decide about modernizing the weapons
until 1992.
   Fitzwater denied that Mitterand's comments urging a go-slow
approach on modernizing NATO's nuclear forces were in conflict with
the U.S. stance.
   ``President Mitterrand's comments yesterday indicate that his
position is very similar to ours. (He) shares our general concern
about the strength of the NATO alliance,'' Fitzwater said.
   Aside from the NATO flap, Bush and the military advisors
discussed details of a defense strategy review dealing with
strategic nuclear weapons and arms control.
   Fitzwater said Bush would disclose some findings of the review
in a speech Wednesday at the U.S. Coast Guard Academy. ``And so
they need to make some ... final judgments before that address
occurs,'' he said.
   The review also will put in place the groundwork for the
resumption of strategic arms talks between the United States and
Soviet Union.
   Fitzwater also brushed aside reports that Mitterrand's party was
unhappy with his accommodations in Kennebunkport.
   ``As far as I know, the accommodations are satisfactory to the
French delegation. The discussions of accommodations have gone
quite well. We don't have any problems,'' he said.
   The New York Daily News quoted unidentified sources as saying
Mitterrand was unhappy with the size of the bed and the height of
the toilet in the house where he'll say. The house, owned by Bush's
mother, Dorothy Walker Bush, is next to the president's home.
   The article also said that Barbara Bush was upset about the
Mitterrand's visit, claiming it to be disruptive.
   Fitzwater said the Bushes had decided to restrict press coverage
of the Mitterrand visit within the oceanside compound.
   ``The family feels their home is their private residence and
should not be used for publicity purposes. They want to keep it
personal, and I think that's reasonable,'' he said.
   Bush plans to travel to Greenwich, Conn., on Sunday to visit his
ailing 87-year-old mother, a White House aide said Friday.
   ``He's just coming in to see her, and then he's leaving,'' said
John Meserve, the press aide.
   The president's mother was released from Greenwich Hospital May
11 after four days of treatment for a blood clot in her right leg,
the hospital said.

   The Rev. Jim Sandmire, an influential
leader of San Francisco's gay community for the last two decades,
has died from complications of AIDS. He was 59.
   Sandmire, who died May 12, was founder and pastor of the Golden

Municipal Election Committee of Los Angeles, the first gay
political action committee in the country.
   Born in Miami, Okla., Sandmire graduated from Harvard with a
business degree and held a master's degree in political science
from the University of California at Berkeley.
   Sandmire's son, Dean, died of AIDS-related causes at the age of
34 a few years ago. Sandmire is survived by his longtime companion,
Jack Hubbs; a daughter, Kim, of Dallas; a son, James of Salt Lake
City; his father, James E. Sandmire Sr. of Miami, Okla.; three
sisters; and one grandson.
   Sandmire is to be honored in a memorial service and reception

among fellow Democrats, is hoping a long-shot legal move in his
fight against ethics charges will rescue his political career.
   But even as Wright expressed confidence he could defeat some of
the charges against him in televised proceedings scheduled Tuesday,
those who elected him speaker were growing more pessimistic about
his chances of holding onto the post.
   ``It's time for a leadership change,'' said Rep. Philip Sharp,
D-Ind., one of the few Democrats willing to say publicly what many
were saying in private. Wright, he said, has become too distracted
by his ethics struggle to run the House's business.
   Another mid-level Democrat, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said many have written off Wright's political fortunes and are now
focusing on the need for a legal defense to protect him from
possible Justice Department action.

   The legal ordeal is over for a father who
disconnected his comatose son from a respirator and held him until
he died, but the act of desperation reveals a gap in laws dealing
with euthanasia, experts said.
   A grand jury refused Thursday to indict Rudy Linares on a
first-degree murder charge for the April 26 death of his
15-month-old son, Samuel.
   Linares, 23, pulled a .357-Magnum caliber handgun on hospital
staff and kept them at bay while taking his son off a respirator
and cradling the boy in his arms until the severely brain-damaged
toddler died.
   He said he did it ``because I loved my son.'' The child had been
in a coma since August, when he accidentally swallowed a balloon,
cutting off oxygen to his brain.

   No longer woebegone are those longing for a
fresh dip in Lake Wobegon.
   Garrison Keillor, the folksy humorist and best-selling author
whose radio program ``A Prairie Home Companion'' warmed audiences
for 13 years, announced Thursday he will be back on the radio come
fall after a two-year absence.
   The fictional Minnesota town of Lake Wobegon will be back in his
new show, Keillor said at a news conference following his address
to a public radio conference, but the ``town that time forgot'' has
undergone changes.
   ``A lot of things have happened to Lake Wobegon ... it's hard to
make them into humor,'' he said. ``Times have been hard back there,
as they have been all across the Midwest.''

   Country Joe McDonald, whose rock band Country Joe
and the Fish appeared at the Woodstock festival, remembers how
strained his life was growing up in a communist family.
   Joan Sokoloff, a 48-year-old therapist, grew up in Boston in the
1950s. But she might as well have spent her childhood on another
planet. While other children were watching ``Father Knows Best,''
Sokoloff, the daughter of communists, was contemplating world
change.
   ``I couldn't care less if they were investigated as communists
or not,'' said McDonald, who grew up in Southern California. ``All
I cared about was when I went to a Cub Scout meeting or went to
play baseball. ... I didn't feel comfortable anymore.''
   Said Sokoloff: ``They (my parents) always used to say that the
revolution is just around the corner. So there was always a sense
that we were working toward something imminent.''
   McDonald and Sokoloff are two of five so-called ``red diaper
babies,'' the children of communists, who appear in ``Children of
the Left,'' a new documentary by filmmaker Eric Stange. The
60-minute film traces the evolution of children raised as
communists who are now adults in a conservative America.
   The topic is a hot one. ``Loyalties _ a Son's Memoir,'' a new
book by former Washington Post investigative reporter Carl
Bernstein, is the story of Bernstein's childhood in a communist
family.
   Bernstein writes about the conflicting legacy left by communist
parents. His story is woven out of what he says are the torn
loyalties and lasting repercussions of a communist childhood.
   Stange found that communist parents left a mixed legacy. Some of
their children remained communists. One became a Reagan
conservative. But almost all remain political and most vote.
   Stange, 35, a former reporter and editor for the Boston Herald,
had made one previous documentary, ``The Pitch of Grief,'' when he
decided to make a film about the children of communists. He knew
several as friends and found out about others through them. A
network exists among them as adults, he said, formed from childhood
when communist families often sent their children to the same
progressive summer camps and schools.
   But Stange said that even now, many who grew up in communist
households were still hesitant going public about the experience.
   ``The penalties were too great in the '50s,'' he said.
   Stange spoke to 50 former ``red diaper babies,'' interviewed 15
on tape and culled five for his film. The term ``red diaper
babies'' has several rumored origins. One is that communist parents
in the '20s were so poor that they used the red flags they received
in return for their party dues to diaper their babies.
   ``I found an incredible mixture of pride and anger,'' he said.
``It was a way of looking at the world that was much more open and
diverse and worldly than what most American kids were getting.''
   The film, which premiered last month in Cambridge, and was
co-produced with the Newton Television Foundation, will also be
shown at New York's Public Theater this month and in Los Angeles in
June.
   The stories that unfold on camera are generally happy ones.
Though they participated in one of the most tumultuous periods in
American history, Stange's subjects recall their childhoods with
more pleasure than pain.
   Eugene Dennis Jr., son of the former general secretary in the
American Communist Party, was a longshoreman for many years and is
now a historian. In the film, tears come to his eyes as he recalls
how ``safe'' he felt, held in the arms of singer-actor-writer Paul
Robeson at one point during the worst of the communist witch hunts
in the '50s.
   David Horowitz, the son of public schoolteachers in New York,
edited the leftist magazine Ramparts in the '60s. He has since
become a best-selling author of biographies with David Collier and
a conservative Republican. Richard Healey, whose mother was a
high-ranking communist leader in Southern California, edits an
anti-nuclear magazine.
   The film uses archival footage to trace the relatively swift
downfall of the Communist Party in the United States, which had
formed in 1919 and enjoyed peak years in the '30s and early '40s.
   ``Children of the Left'' also outlines the turmoil that marked
the party's rapid decline, beginning with the Red Scare initiated
in the '50s by the House Committee on Un-American Activities,
chaired by Sen. Joseph McCarthy, the execution of Julius and Ethel
Rosenberg in 1953 and revelations in 1956 that Soviet leader Josef
Stalin was a murderous dictator.
   Several of the subjects of the film recall their parents were
jailed regularly. Joan Sokoloff remembers the day one of her
mother's arrests made the front page of the Boston Globe, her
struggle to overcome her own embarrassment and her eventual pride
in her parents' work.
   Healey recalls his childhood years at Communist Party meetings
and picnics as ``the happiest moments of my life.''
   ``Growing up with ideals like that, with a world view of wanting
a better life for people, it was still a very rich way of life,''
said Sokoloff.

   The brown-robed nun moves from shrub to
shrub, carefully watering a well-tended row of plants along the
edge of a broad lawn. In the middle stands a 23-foot wooden cross.
   But the serenity of the scene vanishes just a few feet behind
her.
   There stand the gray barbed-wire-topped fence and square guard
towers of Auschwitz, headquarters of a Nazi concentration camp
complex where 4 million people died from 1940 to 1945.
   And the peaceful hollowed-out lawn with the flowers and the
cross where the nun works is in fact a former gravel pit where
political prisoners were gunned down by their Nazi executioners in
1940-41.
   The 14 nuns of the Barefoot Carmelite monastery built in a
former Nazi storehouse on the Auschwitz camp perimeter are not
answering questions these days. Reporters are politely turned away
at the gate.
   They are at the center of an international controversy.
   Their very presence at the camp is deeply offensive to Jews who
resent Christian religious symbols at the place that was the main
engine of Hitler's ``final solution,'' the site of death for an
estimated 2.5 million people whose only crime was being Jewish.
   Calls for the nuns removal were repeated by Jewish leaders in
Western Europe, Israel and the United States this spring, after the
Roman Catholic Church missed a February deadline for moving the
sisters to an interfaith prayer and education center to be built at
an undetermined site farther from the camp.
   The agreement to move the nuns and build the prayer center
within two years was signed in Geneva on Feb. 22, 1987, at a
meeting of 18 Jewish and Roman Catholic leaders, and the removal of
the convent was to be carried out by the archbishop of Krakow,
Cardinal Franciszek Macharski.
   But now a Polish newspaper is waging a campaign to keep the nuns
at the cloister they founded in 1984, and the issue is gaining
support from some residents who argue that the nuns are not harming
anyone.
   The newspaper Slowo Powszechne (Universal Word), the organ of
the pro-government lay Catholic group PAX, published an open letter
assailing the plans to move the nuns.
   The letter, accusing the ``Jewish side'' of ``illegal demands .
.. to ruthlessly carry out an illegal eviction,'' says that the
nuns should stay because the building they occupy is not actually
within the camp. Also, it argues, the main killing site for Jews
was not in Auschwitz itself but at the much-larger subsidiary camp,
Birkenenau, about a mile away.
   But Krzysztof Sliwinski, a Catholic journalist for the liberal
church weekly Tygodnik Powszechny, maintained such arguments are
disingenuous.
   ``Although it isn't on the strict grounds, it is just two or
three meters beyond the fence,'' he said. ``Symbolically, it is in
the camp.''
   Sliwinski said he does not expect the Slowo Powszechne campaign
to alter the plans to move the convent, which were confirmed by the
church episcopate earlier this year. But he sees the controversy as
symptomatic of the wider problems in Catholic-Jewish relations in
Poland.
   ``Here there is a sort of unresolved tension between Catholics
and Jews,'' he said. The relationship is characterized by ``deep
misunderstandings, resentments and mutual ignorance.''
   Poland is overwhelmingly Catholic and Poles have difficulty
imagining why anyone would object to the nuns being next to the
camp where so many people were killed _ including Roman Catholic
priests and nuns and tens of thousands of non-Jewish Poles.
   Sliwinski said that one aspect of the problem is that after the
decision was made to move the monastery, it was never properly
explained to the people.
   Jews number barely 10,000 people in Poland and are virtually
invisible in social life. The Nazis killed 3 million of the
country's 3.4 million Jews and most of the survivors emigrated _
the last wave after a communist anti-Semitic purge in 1968.
   At the convent itself, a theater before World War II, there are
no outward signs that the nuns are planning to move. They have
planted their garden for another year and workmen moving in and out
apparently are making improvements inside. A ``Way of the Cross''
with 13 stations has been put next to the camp's walls.
   The church hierarchy still says it intends to move the nuns but
said in a bishops' statement it had run into to ``difficulties.''
   ``The difficulties ... are not a manifestation of ill will,''
the statement said. ``In part, they result from administrative
formalities, in part from the history of Oswiecim itself, from its
significance and the symbolic meaning of this place for the Polish
nation.
   ``As Oswiecim is for Jews a symbol of Shoah (remembrance), for
Poles it remains the place of bloody martyrdom of the Polish nation.
   ``For us Poles, both the construction of the center, as well as
the presence of the Carmelite nuns there, in the spirit of the
agreement signed Feb. 22, 1987, in Geneva have a great significance
for the future.''
   Church spokesmen were reluctant to discuss the dispute further.
The Rev. Stanislaw Dadat, of the Krakow curia, said only that
arrangements were being made to secure land about 350 yards from
the camp for the interfaith center and to gather building materials.
   The Polish government says it is not involved in the dispute.
   ``We are not a side in the conflict but would like to see it
solved so that both sides (Catholics and Jews) are satisfied,''
said Edward Kotowski of the state Office of Religious Affairs. ``We
think that both sides which reached an agreement should stick to
it.''

   The submarine USS Squalus lay on the
Atlantic floor, and in the forward torpedo room Gerald McLees and
his shipmates sat quietly, conserving oxygen and hoping that
someone would realize their routine test dive had gone tragically
wrong.
   Shortly before, as the crew of 59 had prepared to test the
boat's ability to submerge within 60 seconds while running at high
speed, ``Everything was normal,'' said McLees, recalling the
sinking 50 years ago Tuesday. He was then a 25-year-old chief
electricians mate.
   As the sub's trial run began 13 miles off the New Hampshire
coast, a panel of green lights indicated that all the hull openings
were closed, and the captain, Lt. Oliver Naquin, gave the order to
dive.
   Suddenly, water began pouring into the engine rooms.
   Apparently, 31-inch-wide valves used to draw air in when the sub
was on the surface had opened without tripping warning indicators
in the control room. An inquiry later identified the cause as a
mechanical malfunction.
   ``My reaction was to get everything shut off,'' said Allen Carl
Bryson, who at the time was a 21-year-old machinists' mate second
class. ``If there was any panic, it was all in the end. We didn't
have time for things like that.''
   McLees and Bryson and their shipmates worked to seal off their
forward battery compartment. But water was not the only menace they
faced as the sub tilted, bow up, and descended.
   Chief Electrician's Mate Lawrence Gainer noticed that seawater
had shorted out one of the ship's two batteries, creating a rapid
voltage drain.
   He wedged himself into a narrow crawl space to shut off the
power.
   ``It was two big switches he had to pull. When he pulled one of
them ... it threw such an arc that the arc didn't break until he
pulled the other one,'' McLees said.
   The light seared his eyes, damaging them permanently _ but
Gainer probably saved the boat, Bryson said.
   Even so, the trouble was just beginning for the Squalus. Before
its ordeal was over, 26 of the 59 crewmen would be lost. The rest
credited their survival to the first non-test use of a special
rescue chamber.
   Naquin's submarine now without light or communications, he
ordered Bryson to herd crewmen forward as chlorine gas formed from
a seawater reaction in the battery compartment.
   Petty Officer 3rd Class Lloyd Maness was on watch near a
critical hatch between the control room and the sub's rapidly
flooding rear compartments, according to a 1988 article in the
journal Naval History. As Maness strained to close the 200-pound
hatch, he heard panicked voices calling, ``Keep it open! Keep it
open!'' writer Carl La Vo recounted.
   ``Five men staggered uphill, half-swimming to safety. Maness
then pulled the steel door shut. Behind it, no one would survive,''
La Vo wrote.
   The lack of power kept the crew from signaling the Portsmouth
Naval Shipyard in Kittery, Maine, but authorities realized there
was trouble when the Squalus failed to send a surfacing message one
hour after it announced it was starting its dive.
   The Squalus sent a buoy to the surface with a telephone line
attached and periodically fired red smoke rockets.
   The Sculpin, the Squalus' sister ship, was dispatched from
Portsmouth, and lookouts spotted the smoke rockets.
   Some 240 feet below, the Squalus crew was cheered by the sudden
churning of the Sculpin's engines. ``We knew somebody had spotted
us, anyway,'' McLees said.
   But it was 23 hours after the sinking before the submarine
tender Falcon arrived from New London, Conn., carrying the McCann
rescue chamber, a nine-ton diving bell that would be lowered to a
hatch on the sub and used to bring up survivors.
   McLees was one of the first to ride up; Bryson and Naquin were
in the last group.
   With Navy divers John Mihalowski and William Badders inside, the
bell made a final descent for the hazardous mission of opening a
hatch to check for survivors in rear compartments. The two found
water ``right up to the neck of the hatch,'' concluding that
``there couldn't possibly be any life down there,'' Badders, now
dead, told a Naval Institute interviewer in 1971.
   Mihalowski and Badders received the Medal of Honor for their
role in the rescue.
   Relief changed to sorrow as the survivors returned to the
shipyard.
   McLees, single at the time, watched other men joyfully reunited
with their wives on the pier.
   ``Of course, there were some there, their husbands didn't come
back,'' he said.
   McLees returned to the Squalus less than a year later after the
boat was salvaged and rechristened the Sailfish. He served aboard
during seven World War II patrols in the Pacific.
   The Sailfish was decommissioned at Portsmouth on Oct. 27, 1945.
Its conning tower was placed in a park at the shipyard, which holds
an annual memorial service.

<HEAD>Soft Landing?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Directing the economy isn't like guiding a
spaceship, yet a lot of investors are making the comparison. They
are looking for an economic soft landing from the long expansion of
the 1980s.
   Convinced it can be done, they are putting their money on the
line, bidding up stock prices and creating a great deal of
excitement about the possibility of new highs in the market
averages.
   The popular reasoning is that as the economy cools interest
rates will fall, and falling interest rates generally are good for
stocks. Low rates reduce business costs and they attract money that
might have gone into bonds.
   The soft-landing thesis has gained many adherents. Brokers are
calling old customers with new tips. Market letter writers are
talking about 3,000 points on the Dow Jones industrial average.
Business Week magazine declares ``A Soft Landing Will Send the
Market Soaring.'' Stocks are exciting once again.
   What may be missing from the scenario, however, is the most
essential of all the ingredients that make up market prices, and
that is profits.
   An economic cooling might indeed be accompanied by lower
borrowing rates, but won't it mean lower profits, too?
Historically, and logically, that's been the case. And if profits
decline, what will hold prices up?
   While some investors might dwell to their advantage on that
question, others are wondering why we should expect the Federal
Reserve to guide the 77-month-old economic expansion to a gentle,
kind, soft landing.
   That sort of denouement is to be wished for, of course, but
wishing won't make it come. For decades, economic soft landings
have been a dream but hardly an accomplishment. The economy reacts
in ways that cannot be forecast.
   It was popular in the 1960s, for example, to talk about fine
tuning. Those who directed fiscal policy would join with monetary
officials to make the economy dance to a sweet melody in which
every note would be perfect.
   That notion didn't even last the decade. Before the '60s were
done the idea of fine-tuning had been trashed.
   Because the economy was manageable, President Lyndon Johnson had
reasoned, we can make it produce not just butter but guns too. But
the record-high inflation and interest rates that followed
represented a crash for the fine-tuning idea.
   Today, the equivalent of fine tuning is soft landing. Can it be
done? Maybe, if we have managed to assimilate a great deal of
information from the past.
   Meanwhile, what about profits? Can they hold up? Can stock
prices hold?
   The answer to the profits question might come later this year,
when year-to-year comparisons could turn negative. At the moment,
profits compared to a year ago look healthy, but those comparisons
might turn paler in October. It doesn't take losses to make an
investor reconsider _ just a slowing of gains.
   Because the stock market usually anticipates such things, the
possibility of a decline in the growth of profits could have
significance for investors right now.
   Nobody knows whether the stock market is going to soar to the
heavens. But in the next few weeks many investors will be asking
themselves if the economic technicians, like those in the space
program, have the skills for the job.

<HEAD>Concern About Racism Follows Surge in Hong Kong Investment</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Dollar figures are U.S.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Fears that Hong Kong
investors and immigrants will change the placid ways of this scenic
Pacific city have surged into the open with charges of racism not
far behind.
   Mayor Gordon Campbell, who is sponsoring a series of public
forums intended to calm the escalating controversy, said people are
looking for an easy way to explain the rapid changes tied to the
city's growth.
   ``I think there's no question that people are concerned,'' he
said in an interview. ``I think the fears are real ... so let's
shine the light on them.''
   Soaring housing prices and high profile projects in commercial
real estate in the past year have made Asian, specifically Hong
Kong, investment the hottest topic in the area.
   The local newspapers are devoting full pages to letters to the
editor about the issue.
   ``Native Vancouverites will be made to feel like strangers in
their own city as the influx of Asians and their capital freezes
them out,'' wrote one reader to The Province.
   ``This is a golden opportunity to absorb investment and skilled
professionals,'' said another on the same page. ``It is of
paramount importance that British Columbia not just become a
prosperous province, but also maintain a harmonious multicultural
environment for all its inhabitants, old and new.''
   The debate covers a wide range, including the increasing number
of Asian children in neighborhood schools.
   Perhaps no project has attracted as much attention as the $1.6
billion Pacific Place project on the False Creek downtown
waterfront lands where Expo '86 attracted attention to the city.
   Li Ka-Shing, the Hong Kong magnate who is the project's major
financier, purchased the lands from the city for the Canadian
dollar equivalent of $269 million. The government must bear the
substantial cost of removing industrial waste from the site.
   ``There's an old Chinese saying that a big tree gathers the
wind,'' Stanley Kwok, a senior vice president of Concord Pacific
Developments Ltd., said in explaining the attention paid his
company's massive project.
   ``Wherever there's change, one thing will stand out,'' said
Kwok, who has been in Vancouver for 21 years. ``Just like any North
American neighborhood, nobody wants change.''
   About 20 percent of the Vancouver area population of 1.2 million
is of Chinese origin, many of them people whose families have been
in Canada for generations.
   The External Affairs Department in Ottawa has estimated that
investment from Hong Kong will increase sharply to $3.3 billion in
Canada this year from $2 billion in 1988.
   Always in the equation is 1997 when control of Hong Kong goes
back to China from Britain.
   Racism, Mayor Campbell said, ``gets to be a very quick answer.
That's wrong.''
   The heated housing market that sent the average price of a
Vancouver home up by some 45 percent to $181,282 at the end of
March from $127,344 has been hard for Vancouver residents to ignore.
   ``The supply and demand got out of balance, and there was a
major price correction upward,'' said Jerry Jackman, senior vice
president for residential real estate for the large Royal LePage
realtors. ``The finger seemed to be pointed at the Asian investor .
.. and they were absolutely not the culprit.''
   Victor Li, son of Li Ka-shing and another senior vice president
at Concord Pacific, set off a furor in December when he put 216
Vancouver condominiums on sale in Hong Kong without offering them
first in Canada.
   Most sold within hours. Li has promised that it won't happen
again.
   T-shirts started circulating, however, that read: ``Hongcouver,
B.C. `89.'' A charge that they were racist led to them being pulled
off the market.
   Graham Johnson, a sociologist at the University of British
Columbia who has studied Chinese migration extensively, said racism
has been a constant problem in the region since the first Chinese
arrived in 1858 but has boiled over in the past year.
   ``What you have going on is a degree of scapegoating,'' he said.
   Johnson said the change has been the movement of Chinese
immigrants out of traditional ethnic neighborhoods to the affluent
West Side, where the tearing down of modest older properties and
replacement by huge homes became a noticeable trend.
   Johnson said the number of Chinese immigrants has not increased
sharply over past periods, with an estimated 5,000 last year, but
the arrival of affluent immigrants has not taken place to this
extent before.
   ``All of this raises a lot of hackles,'' he said. ``One doesn't
see a very swift solution to some of the problems that we
identify.''

   The temple of the Siwan Oracle, where
the superstitious young conqueror Alexander the Great was told he
was a god, sits in ruin on its hillside perch.
   Shali, a majestic 13th-century fortress that protected Siwans
from medieval Bedouin marauders, is a sandcastle of rubble,
stripped of its glory by neglect and the oasis' infrequent but
devastating desert rains.
   The village silversmith is gone, along with most of the
elaborate jewelry he crafted _ gigantic bangles that jingled from
the oasis' richly costumed women.
   Berber and Sudanese heritage have blended into Siwan life, along
with other tongues and cultures carried over Saharan sands to form
its roots and distinct language.
   So much made Siwa, only 85 miles from Libya, unique in Egypt,
and much of that is gone.
   But much is left.
   As it has for a thousand years, life in Siwa begins before dawn
with the muezzim calling Moslems to prayer from minarets of mosques
scattered through the oasis' date palms and olive groves.
   Then a donkey serenade begins. Hundreds bray, echoing through
the palms, followed by a chorus of roosters.
   Early-morning markets open to the cloppety-clop of donkeys
pulling kerussahs, family carts driven by caftan-wearing men or
boys. Wives and mothers covered head-to-toe in flowing blue
embroidered shawls called milayah sit behind with smaller children.
   Covered kerussahs provide the local taxi service, sharing bumpy
roadways with military trucks and, with increasing frequency,
tourist buses from Cairo.
   Camels never made it big in Siwa. Donkeys are cheaper.
   Until the early 1980s, virtually all sounds and sights in Siwa
would have been familiar to Siwans centuries earlier. But four
years ago a highway became the oasis' umbilical cord to Egypt and
the Arabic language.
   The three-hour, 190-mile drive from Mersa Matrouh on the western
Egyptian coast covers generally the same desert route over which,
2,000 years ago, people from around the Mediterranean _ Alexander
among them _ trekked for more than a week seeking the wisdom of the
famed desert oracle.
   More recently, buyers for chic boutiques in Cairo and Europe
have traveled it, taking with them the best jewelry and handicrafts.
   Siwans have been put on parade for an ever-growing number of
often scantily dressed visitors.
   Television invaded Siwa in 1986, and more than 1,000 sets were
sold the first week. Like their fellow Egyptians, Siwans go to bed
chatting about the latest plot twists of Falcon Crest or Knots
Landing.
   Young Siwans, now heading in increasing numbers for higher
education in Cairo and Alexandria, have far fewer traditions to
remember but many more influences to contemplate.
   But for Siwa's 10,000 inhabitants, the infusion and confusion
hasn't been all bad.
   A year-old U.S. aid project gives them clean water for the first
time. Extracted from salty subterranean pools, the desalinated
water costs 5 piasters (just over 2 cents) a jerrycan, which even
the poor can afford, instead of 75 piasters (30 cents) when water
was trucked from outside.
   Electricity supplies remain uncertain and sporadic, but
Czechoslavakian generators are being installed that promise a
constant power supply.
   One aid project is working to save Siwa's soul.
   More than a year ago, Marc Perron, then Canada's ambassador to
Egypt, asked Siwan officials what his country could do for their
changing oasis. Help us save our heritage, they said.
   ``Everybody talked for years about how to save Siwa, that its
cultural heritage must be saved, but nobody did anything about
it,'' said Heba el-Kholy, fund coordinator at the Canadian Embassy
in Cairo.
   The Canadian project aimed to build a traditional Siwan house in
the old way, using mudbrick and palm trunks and to teach young
women old skills.
   Now nearing completion, the two-story house going up in the
village garden will become a museum dedicated to Siwan culture and
a reservoir for handicrafts.
   Six miles away, in a poor desert village, Khadiga Ismail Sami
has spent the last year teaching five cheerful girls, aged 11 to
15, to embroider bridal scarves in the Siwan way. Siwan girls, who
marry about age 14, must have an extensive bridal trousseau,
including seven elaborate wedding dresses.
   Mrs. Sami is among nine women team leaders, each passing along
her sewing or basket-making artistry to five girls.
   The Canadian project has supplied each of Mrs. Sami's
apprentices material for bridal scarves, which can take several
months to complete.
   Once finished, she has the option of keeping them or selling
them back to the project for 5 Egyptian pounds (about $2) each.
   ``A bride has to have these scarves for her wedding,'' Mrs. Sami
said. ``If she has to buy them ready-made, she will have to pay 75
pounds ($30) for one scarf.''
   Miss el-Kholy, the Canadian co-ordinator, said she considers
both efforts a first step in saving Siwa's unique traditions.
   ``Young girls today prefer watching television to making
handicrafts,'' she said. ``But once we begin selling the products,
and the women can see the results, I believe the traditions won't
die.''

<HEAD>Worries Make Wall Street Happy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The stock market's behavior this year has evoked
an old Wall Street maxim _ when stocks are rising, they ``climb a
wall of worry.''
   The idea has a simple basis in logic. As long as people with
money to invest are worried about the business outlook and
skeptical about market prospects, they keep a lot of their buying
power in reserve.
   This money provides the fuel that keeps a rally going as more
and more investors gradually are converted to the bullish camp.
   Conversely, when fear fades and everyone is content with
business prospects, the market becomes vulnerable to a setback
because everyone already owns stocks.
   The way to invest successfully, then, is to practice ``contrary
opinion'' _ buying when things look darkest and selling in the
bright sunshine.
   Given this simple premise, why isn't everybody who ever invested
in the stock market now living a life of ease?
   Well, one problem is that acting on a contrary-opinion approach
requires going against the human emotions of greed and fear.
   Another arises from the frequent difficulty of gauging the
conventional wisdom that you, as a contrarian, are supposed to be
betting against.
   Such a situation prevails right now on Wall Street. Some
analysts see extreme caution, while others claim to detect outright
complacency.
   ``Several times during the post-crash recovery, worries have
switched from recession to boom, and its associated inflation
acceleration, and back again,'' says Philip Roth, analyst at
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. ``Now we seem to have both worries at
the same time.
   ``In our opinion, we don't have to worry about an important peak
in stocks until concerns about the economy abate.
   ``Only then will a drawdown in cash reserves and excessive
optimism occur, undermining the technical strength of the market.''
   Other analysts, by contrast, contend that the majority of
investors have been lulled into a dangerous confidence that the
Federal Reserve can engineer a ``soft landing'' for the economy,
restraining inflation without causing a recession.
   ``Investors, as is typical late in a trend when enthusiasm
reigns, have assumed that all is for the best _ a slowdown that
would never dream of turning into the teensiest bit of a
recession,'' maintains Justin Mamis, who writes a market commentary
for Cowen &amp; Co. in New York.
   ``In fact, as is beginning to be said, there never has to be a
recession again _ except perhaps in the stocks one doesn't own.
It's not exactly a wall of worry any more.''
   People who seek to go against the prevailing sentiment have
developed scores of statistical yardsticks to try to measure it.
   One of these, calculated by Investors Intelligence of New
Rochelle, N.Y., uses the percentages of 130 investment advisory
services it classifies as bullish, bearish, or on the fence.
   Early this month, the ranks of the bears shrank to 33 percent,
the lowest number since the crash in 1987. Investors Intelligence
describes sentiment as neutral for the short-term.
   But that kind of thing doesn't scare an optimist like Richard
Evans at Dow Theory Forecasts in Hammond, Ind.
   ``While the market's move to new highs has generated some
interest, the level of skepticism on Wall Street remains stubbornly
high,'' he declares.
   There's no big trouble ahead, he says, ``until there is some
greater consensus that a bull market is under way.''

<HEAD>Young Afrikaners Questioning Their Role as Apartheid's Heirs</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Young Afrikaners have begun
questioning their role as apartheid's heirs.
   In recent months, the first anti-apartheid newspaper published
in Afrikaans has doubled its circulation to 8,000 and provided
publicity for a new wave of alternative culture.
   Three anti-establishment Afrikaner rock bands have been drawing
enthusiastic crowds at campuses and theaters during an
unprecedented nationwide tour.
   The movement is small as yet.
   Most Afrikaner children grow up in tight-knit, conservative
families and attend rigid state schools where curriculum is
tailored to fit government ideology. Young white men must serve two
years in the military, prolonging the period in which they are
screened from other ways of thinking.
   ``Afrikaners have a very authoritarian tradition _ children are
meant to be seen and not heard,'' said Max du Preez, editor of the
7-month-old newspaper Vrye Weekblad (Free Weekly). ``This has
retarded the growth of young people. We're all late bloomers.''
   Du Preez's newspaper is aimed both at readers who already have
broken with apartheid and at those who still condone the concept of
white-minority rule under the National Party government.
   ``We have a converting role, a responsibility to stimulate
Afrikaners who are on the verge of breaking away and to provide a
new home for them,'' du Preez, 37, said in an interview. ``It's
been a very lonely place to be, to be an Afrikaner who has broken
with apartheid.''
   It doesn't seem lonely at the boisterous concerts of the Voelvry
(Free Bird) rock `n' roll tour, which succeeded despite being
banned from several places. One of the touring groups is called Die
Swart Gevaar _ ``The Black Menace'' _ and is a phrase used in
describing whites' fears of a black majority takeover.
   Dirk Uys, manager of another group called the Gereformeerde
Blues Band, told one music writer: ``We're bringing home a lot of
those homeless people who have never been able to identify with the
current state of Afrikaans culture.''
   Says the leader of the Blues Band, Johannes Kerkorrel: ``If you
can make a language into rock `n' roll, it can't be an oppressive
language any more.''
   Along with the alternative music movement is an upsurge in
provocative, topical Afrikaans drama, with new works surfacing
regularly from university-based playwrights.
   ``This radical school of dramatists challenges and even
undermines the principles and mores on which Afrikanerdom is
based,'' said The Weekly Mail, an English-language anti-apartheid
newspaper.
   About 60 percent of South Africa's 5 million whites are
Afrikaners, descendants of Dutch and other European settlers who
began arriving here 337 years ago. Only in 1948 did the Afrikaners
take full control of the government, and they proceeded to enact
the harsh segregation laws of apartheid, force millions of blacks
from their homes, and suppress campaigns for black rights.
   Small numbers of Afrikaners have opposed apartheid since the
1960s, and their ranks have grown since the widespread black unrest
of 1984-86, but most remain opposed to black majority rule and
uninterested in learning about other political perspectives.
   Mike Joubert, who last year was president of the student council
at the University of Pretoria, said most of the 22,000 students at
the Afrikaans-language school were preoccupied with academics and
social life and had ``a very strong antipathy toward any kind of
political activity.''
   ``They were very uninformed,'' said Joubert, a nephew of Foreign
Minister Pik Botha. ``They accept anything they read or see on
television.''
   Only a few hundred students were active in either left-wing or
right-wing political groups, said Joubert, who is now in business
school. Many of the others might accept major political reforms but
would need to be led in that direction, he said.
   At the University of Stellenbosch, the most prestigious
Afrikaans university, a slightly more liberal mood prevails. A ban
on the Voelvry tour provoked emotional protests, and there was
widespread support for a group of 18 students who went to Zambia in
April to participate in forums that included members of the
outlawed African National Congress guerrilla movement.
   The Dutch Reformed Church, by far the largest Afrikaner
denomination, has suffered fewer defections of young people than
major Protestant churches in the West, according to Dr. Pierre
Roussouw, a senior church official.
   He said more than 90 percent of the youths who are baptized by
the church complete the process that leads to adult membership.
Services at university chapels are packed, he said.
   ``There are victims of secularization, and we're worried about
that,'' he said. ``But we have much to be thankful for.''
   One of the factors behind the church's strength, said Roussouw,
is Christian National Education, the education system at white
public schools that promotes Afrikaner nationalism,
Calvinist-oriented Bible study, and a white-oriented view of
history.
   The Dutch Reformed Church has repudiated its former endorsement
of apartheid, but Roussouw said it would never abandon its support
of Christian National Education.
   ``We sometimes underestimate the power of the school system.''
said du Preez. ``It's a very potent force _ the history courses,
the language, Bible study, praying for the president, raising the
flag.''
   Most Afrikaners in their 20s and 30s sense that black majority
rule is inevitable, du Preez said, but they have deep worries and
uncertainties about how that change will affect them.
   ``I feel so sad as I look at my people _ they're the most unfree
people in this country,'' he said. ``They're resented by everybody
else. They're angry and afraid and confused.''

<TEXT>
   At the prestigious corner of Friedrichstrasse and
Unter den Linden in East Berlin stands the Soviet-bloc's only hotel
to earn Western recognition as one of the world's most luxurious.
   But the Grand Hotel's 350 plush rooms and apartments are
available only to the carriers of convertible currencies, such as
dollars, and few East Europeans will brave the doormen's steely
stares for a peek at the opulent Art Nouveau lobby.
   Like all businesses in East Germany, the government is the owner
and as such can smooth more than the sheets for its most valued
clients.
   The hotel's shiny black Mercedes limousines are virtually waved
through border controls while other Western travelers are forced to
line up for the lengthy ordeal of passport checks and currency
declarations.
   Hotel staff can settle the details with the Foreign Ministry
later.
   Likewise, with a mere signature, they can they arrange a visa
extension or Western bank transfer _ tasks that through the normal
bureaucracy can take hours.
   The Grand opened in August 1987 and last year earned the
designation by the New York-based Leading Hotels association as one
of the 200 best hotels in the world.
   Its emergence typifies the kind of turnkey business deal East
Germany wants with the West.
   While Soviet, Polish and Hungarian companies have been pressing
for Western cooperation to develop and share new hard-currency
sources, like tourist facilities, East Berlin's authorities are
resistant to sharing control or profit.
   ``We have not been riding this fashionable wave of activity over
joint ventures,'' said the Grand's deputy director, Hartmut Kaske.
``Those countries running hotels and other businesses under joint
ventures with the West do so out of economic necessity. We are not
that weak.''
   Financing for construction of the hotel was arranged by the
Japanese company Kojima, which built the Grand. The East German
government has paid off the loan, and the hotel's profits are
channeled to it as reimbursement.
   Kaske said in an interview the hotel will have paid for itself
within 10 years, although its occupancy rate of less than 40
percent is well below that considered a break-even point for
Western hotels.
   The hotel draws mostly businessmen and prominent visitors with
its rates ranging from the equivalent of $150 a night for the
smallest single room to $2,000 for one of the two penthouse suites.
   All 800 employees are East Germans, who are paid significantly
less than Western workers in similar jobs. The national average for
personal income is about $600 a month, and most consumer service
jobs pay well below the average.
   Gudrun Goslar, the hotel's public relations director, says
exclusivity is part of the Grand's attraction for the Western
businessmen who make up about 80 percent of the guest list.
   ``It would be foolish to condemn what is available here just
because some people can't afford it,'' she remarked during a tour
of the luxury suites with private saunas and hand-made porcelain
lamps.
   East German officials make no apologies over the luxury provided
for the Westerners in contrast with the austere accommodations
available for East Germans.
   ``We built this hotel to be able to offer a good product on the
international market,'' Kaske said. ``We operate on the old
capitalist principle that when the customer is happy, he buys
more.''
   He said much of the initiative to build a luxury hotel in East
Berlin came from the foreign trade officials whose Western
counterparts had complained of poor accommodation.
   While the Grand Hotel is uniquely lavish for a communist
enterprise, with a 340-label wine list and an indoor orange grove
for communing with nature, guests can still find a few reminders of
which side of the border they are sleeping on.
   Dialing direct to Western cities is possible, but the few
international telephone lines available are frequently engaged for
hours.
   Tuxedoed security men stand guard throughout the seven-tier
atrium lobby, but a few hard-currency prostitutes are allowed in to
the polished bars and dimly lit salons.
   Accompanying the full breakfast delivered to rooms on white
linen is an imported exotic flower but a dull morning newspaper,
the Communist Party's Berliner Zeitung.
   A West German businessman who did not want to be named said he
stays at the Grand Hotel several times a year ``because it's the
closest thing to civilization one can find here.''
   He added that the hotel was very comfortable, ``but going
outside is a little like waking up from a good dream.''

   President Bush never cared much for the
100-day test, even though he took it. Now he's closing in on 130
days, which may prove a better grading period.
   That comes a week from tomorrow, the day Bush confronts a
troublesome West German ally at a NATO summit in Brussels. And
that's only one of the first-semester exams coming due soon.
   Among the others:
   _The cracks in his bipartisan courtship of the Democratic
Congress, which passed a $4.55 hourly minimum wage Bush promises to
veto as too high. Congressional approval came by margins short of
the two-thirds needed to override a veto. Democrats said Bush was
using the veto threat to try to prove himself tough.
   _The crisis over Panama, where military boss Manuel Antonio
Noriega so far is resisting domestic opposition, pressure from the
Organization of American States and U.S. demands that he quit or be
kicked out after invalidating an election observers said he rigged
in the first place.
   _The wrangle over Bush's proposals to rescue the tottering
savings and loan system with a federal subsidy, a bill he wanted
passed on a crisis timetable. Some Democrats have demanded the cost
be part of the federal budget, and therefore the deficit, instead
of being handled separately. That also could become a veto issue.
   _The revival, so far low-key, of the Iran-Contra questions Bush
shoved aside during the 1988 campaign. Some Democrats want to
reopen the congressional investigation of the case to explore
disclosures the government made at the trial of Oliver North.
Bush's nomination of a former top aide to be ambassador to South
Korea is being held up by Democrats who say they want answers on
his role in the affair.
   Passing his own judgment on his first hundred days _ because
everybody else was anyhow _ Bush pronounced himself ``off to a good
start, and there's more to come.''
   It's coming fast.
   The president leaves on Friday for a week-long trip to Western
Europe, with the NATO summit meeting the major and most challenging
event. His foreign policy review is done now, and there are issues
that will not wait. At the NATO summit, that will be West Germany's
insistence on prompt negotiations with the Soviet Union on
short-range nuclear weapons.
   The Bush administration is determined to keep those weapons in
place, which means in Germany, as a shield against the overwhelming
Soviet advantage in conventional arms and manpower.
   That's proving a difficult line to hold with continental allies
who see a lessening of the Soviet threat. Bush's spokesman, Marlin
Fitzwater, has called the Soviet peace initiative a series of
``public relations gambits.'' The president and his men have said
repeatedly they are not going to yield on the nuclear weapons
question until the Soviet Union agrees to major, verified cuts in
its conventional forces.
   Nevertheless, Bush has said that western differences can be
worked out and that he looks for a smooth summit in Brussels.
   Some conservatives read into that a possibility that Bush may
waver for the sake of harmony. ``Leadership is not the same as
consensus-building,'' said Burton Pines, senior vice president of
the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank.
   Pines said that, unless Bush sticks to his short-range weapons
in the NATO dispute, the Germans will figure that they hold the
cards because they can fracture the harmony and consensus of the
alliance.
   Even when they like his policies, as in the NATO situation,
conservatives tend to worry about Bush because they see him as a
leader sometimes too given to compromise, too bent on
bipartisanship. His leadership over 100 days, or 130, and probably
over four or eight years, will not satisfy their yearning for the
certainties of Ronald Reagan's conservatism.
   But the more important and general judgment will come on results.
   At the 100-day checkpoint there weren't any; there hadn't been
time, so when Bush summarized what he'd done, it was long on
prospects. He told of his proposals and his agreements with
Congress _ deals that avoided head-on fights on such issues as a
budget resolution and non-military supplies for the Nicaraguan
Contra rebels.
   Now the compelling issues are coming up for action, and some of
them will not yield to compromise or fit bipartisanship.

   With student loan defaults approaching $2
billion, the Education Department is ready to tighten the screws on
schools turning out more than their share of delinquent borrowers.
   New regulations, due by month's end, target what many consider
the crux of the problem: profit-making vocational schools that
survive primarily on student financial aid and have a loan default
rate three times the 12 percent national average.
   These private schools train people in everything from
cosmetology and truck driving to business and commercial art.
Although their students receive only about a quarter of all
federally guaranteed loans, such schools account for 40 percent of
all defaulted loan dollars.
   The regulations, from Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos, will
prescribe a series of increasingly tough actions against schools
depending on their default rates, with those above 35 or 40 percent
in line for the most stringent treatment.
   Former Education Secretary William Bennett favored a
harsher-sounding plan to start automatic proceedings to limit,
suspend or terminate participation by schools with default rates
above 20 percent. Some 2,354 institutions, more than half of them
profit-making vocational schools, fall into that category.
   Education Department officials, citing administrative problems
with the Bennett plan, say the graduated Cavazos approach is
actually stronger medicine.
   ``I can assure you that more of the shoddy schools with default
problems will feel more pain sooner under what Lauro Cavazos is
doing than they would have under the Bennett proposal,'' said
deputy undersecretary Charles Kolb.
   Stories of exploitation and abuse by unscrupulous trade school
operators have been rampant for years, with students routinely
depicted as victims of shady recruiting techniques and shoddy
education.
   Witnesses at congressional and other legislative hearings have
described students incapable of doing the coursework, whether from
low IQs, illiteracy or having virtually no knowledge of English.
Those that can learn sometimes receive little training in the
skills they signed up to study.
   Students often drop out of a program with nothing to show for
their efforts except a debt of $2,500 or more. Even graduates can
find they lack the skills they need to compete in the job market.
   Proprietary school associations protest that their members are
being unjustly tainted by a few bad apples. At the same time,
however, they are moving to tighten accreditation procedures,
upgrade admissions standards and promote loan default management
plans.
   Department officials contend that high default rates are a sign
of bad school management. Career school executives counter that
such rates reflect instead the poor, urban, academically risky
students served by many of their institutions as well as a lack of
diligence on the part of outside loan collectors.
   ``You can have a high default rate and a superb school,'' said
Stephen Blair, president of the National Association of Trade and
Technical Schools and a former loan program official at the
Education Department.
   Another proprietary group, the Association of Independent
Colleges and Schools, argues that if just one at-risk student
succeeds because of a guaranteed student loan, the long-term saving
to society covers the cost of 65 defaults.
   Some 4.4 million students borrowed nearly $12 billion in
guaranteed loans last year to pursue postsecondary education at
colleges, universities and private career schools. Defaults last
year totaled $1.6 billion _ nearly half the annual federal cost of
the program. The default figure is expected to reach $1.8 billion
this year and rise even higher after that.
   Taxpayers are not the only ones shelling out to cover defaults;
lenders are becoming vulnerable as well.
   The most expensive foul-up ever occurred earlier this year in
California when federal guarantees on loans worth $1.4 billion were
voided by a loan servicing company's failure to follow proper
collection procedures. Nine major U.S. and foreign banks sued last
month in an attempt to make the loan trustee, the Bank of America,
take responsibility for their losses, which could reach $650
million.
   In addition to requiring certain steps of schools with soaring
default rates, officials said the department's combination of new
rules, administrative actions and legislative proposals may include:
   _Pro-rata refunds to victimized students.
   _Disclosure of the track records of vocational schools,
including completion and job placement rates, to inform prospective
students, promote competition and alert the department to problem
schools.
   _Mandatory loan counseling for all first-time student borrowers.
   _More stringent requirements to determine if students without
high school diplomas or their equivalent, who are permitted to
borrow money for some programs, can truly benefit from the
coursework.
   _Some way to curb unethical recruitment practices, including
pie-in-the-sky pitches made outside prisoner rehabilitation
programs, welfare offices and drug treatment centers.
   _Incentives for states to institute systems to garnish wages,
thereby avoiding costly litigation against defaulters who have jobs.
   _Tighter monitoring of schools and guarantors by the department,
which is currently investigating and prosecuting a wide range of
abuses.
   The department's inspector general, James B. Thomas Jr.,
recently told Congress that one company, Continental Training
Services Inc., with headquarters in Indianapolis, enrolled students
who were not proficient in English.
   In addition, Thomas said, ``Individuals who had physical
disabilities which would prevent them from driving a truck or from
obtaining a license to do so were enrolled. Individuals were
enrolled who could not get licenses because of prior driving or
criminal records. ...''
   Thomas said employees at Hausman Computer Associates of New York
City ``created high school diplomas for students who were not high
school graduates to make them appear to be eligible for federal
student aid.''
   At La Tee's Beauty School in Chicago, he said, ``time cards,
state inspection records and sign-in sheets are examples of records
falsified to reflect attendance when the `student' was actually
incarcerated, was on a leave of absence or had dropped out of
class.''
   Angelo Aponte, New York City's commissioner of consumer affairs,
told a state legislative committee in March about an auto mechanic
training course that had no cars and little equipment. ``Students
only got a chance to work on cars if a student's car needed
repairs,'' he said.
   Aponte said the education director of the Fortune Society, which
helps ex-prison inmates, told him she met daily with ex-offenders
about to enroll in courses they could not possibly complete.
   ``Why would one admit a third-grade reader into a computer
programming course?'' Aponte quoted her as asking. ``Or tell a man
with a fourth-grade math level that in six months he'll be applying
for a job as an accountant? Why would anyone give potential
students the answers to admissions tests, or tell them they will be
admitted anyway even if they fail the test? And why would anyone
operate a computer programming course without a computer on the
premises?''

   Amway Corp. may have gotten cold feet about
pursuing a takeover of Avon Products Inc. because it decided the
two direct-sales companies wouldn't be a good match, suggests
Avon's Chairman James E. Preston.
   Preston also says he is convinced Avon shareholders and sales
representatives will be better off if Avon remains independent,
permitting management to carry out current plans.
   However, Avon's stock plunged $7.12{ a share to $33 in heavy New
York Stock Exchange Trading Thursday, a day after Amway withdrew
its $2.1 billion bid.
   During an interview Thursday, Preston said Amway's decision to
withdraw the $39-a-share takeover proposal hours after Avon's board
unanimously rejected the offer, may have been prompted by second
thoughts about the feasibility of joining the two companies.
   Preston supplied copies of letters sent to him by sales reps
disturbed by the prospect of having Amway as a corporate parent.
   Several of the letters were addressed to Amway's co-founders
Richard DeVos and Jay Van Andel and denounced the way Amway
distributors do business. Van Andel is chairman of the privately
held company and DeVos is president.
   One of the correspondents, Avon representative Constance M.
Wendt of Jacksonville, Fla., told the Amway executives: ``Our
prayers are for a continued strong, united family _ the Avon family
and Avon traditions known to our loyal consumers for the past 104
years of service ...''
   The letters were described by Preston as just a sample of the
huge amount of correspondence Avon received since Amway, an Ada,
Mich.-based direct-selling concern, started making takeover
advances.
   Amway's statement that it would operate its own distributor
network separately from Avon's direct-sales business if it
prevailed in its takeover attempt apparently did not alleviate the
concerns, Preston said.
   In a survey Avon conducted, nearly half of Avon's sales reps,
which operate independently and aren't Avon employees, said they
would cease selling for Avon if Amway acquired control of the
company.
   Preston said Avon's worldwide image as a beauty products company
would be impaired by a linkage with Amway.
   Meanwhile, Preston said Avon will step up efforts to improve its
balance sheet. The emphasis will be placed on reducing costs, which
have been averaging 53 percent of sales. The goal is to shave the
percentage to 47 percent by 1990.
   As an example of where costs would be trimmed, he said the use
of ``premiums'' to attract customers would be scaled back or
discontinued in Avon's direct-selling operation. These premiums are
items that companies give away to customers when they make a
purchase, such as a free tote bag for buying a certain amount of
makeup.
   He said any possible expansion of Avon's lines will be aimed at
complimenting the company's primary focus on beauty products.
``People don't want to buy their fragrance from a company that
sells dog food or toilet brushes,'' he said.
   In a letter to shareholders Thursday, Avon forecasted sales from
direct selling will grow by 7 percent to 8 percent this year.
   Sales in its retail operation, which consists of some of the
country's top-selling fragrances such as Giogio and Red, will grow
faster. These Avon scents are sold at department stores and other
retail outlets, not by Avon's independent sales force.
   Preston said in the interview that numerous parties, which he
did not name, have expressed interest in acquiring Avon's retail
fragrance business. Amway said it would have sold it off if it took
over Avon.
   Preston, who also is Avon's chief executive officer, said he is
thrilled by the strong performance of the prestige fragrance
business and has no intention of selling it.
   Avon has been restructuring and the process is to be completed
this year with the divestiture of its remaining businesses in the
health care services field. The company lost $404.5 million in 1988
due to losses on discontinued operations. Sales totaled $3.06
billion last year.

<HEAD>Eastern Union Says Future Trump Pilots Don't Have To Honor Strike</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Reversing their earlier position, pilots union
leaders at strike-torn Eastern Airlines said 170 Eastern pilots can
go to work for the company's Northeast shuttle if it is sold to
developer Donald Trump.
   The pilots, who already have been hired for the planned Trump
Shuttle, had said they planned to defy union leadership's earlier
position directing them not to work for Trump until the Eastern
strike was over.
   Trump's agreement to buy the business for $365 million from
Eastern parent Texas Air Corp. still must be approved by the
federal bankruptcy court.
   The Master Executive Council of the Air Line Pilots Association
at Eastern had asked its pilots not to work for Trump or receive
further training for the Trump shuttle as long as the strike
against Eastern continued.
   After a meeting Thursday with Trump Shuttle officials, the
pilots' leadership decided prospective Trump pilots would be
approved to start training, said Dan Ashby, a spokesman for ALPA in
New York.
   In an earlier message to pilots, Jack Bavis, the head of the
Eastern pilots union, had directed that ``no pilot, including those
who have accepted employment with the Trump Shuttle, will engage in
any training of any kind until the strike is over or until the
(Master Executive Council) endorses another course of action.''
   Eastern's unions have opposed a sale of the profitable New
York-Washington-Boston shuttle and other Eastern assets.
   The company has been in bankruptcy court protection from
creditors since March 9, five days after the start of a Machinists
union strike that was joined by Eastern's pilots and flight
attendants unions and virtually grounded the airline.
   In a letter dated May 2 to Henry Duffy, national president of
ALPA, pilot Bill Sanford said ``the Trump pilots have to question
whether the association is working toward our best interest at
Trump. If the (Master Executive Council) continues to interfere in
our business and ALPA continues to ignore us, then a reassessment
and further examination of our alternatives will obviously have to
be explored.''
   In recent weeks, other prospective Trump pilots have sent a
flurry of similar letters to Trump, Duffy and U.S. Bankruptcy Judge
Burton R. Lifland, who is overseeing Eastern's Chapter 11
proceeding. Copies of some of the letters were obtained by The
Associated Press.
   Trump Shuttle management already has signed labor agreements
with pilots and flight attendants.
   America West Airlines, which has made a competing, higher offer
for the shuttle, has said it mainly would use its own employees to
operate the service although Eastern workers would be eligible to
apply for jobs. America West, a regional carrier based in Phoenix,
Ariz., is non-union.
   The company has offered to pay $415 million for the Eastern
shuttle and $336 million for 10 Boeing 757s.
   In addition to the 170 Eastern pilots already hired, another 40
or so pilots have been hired for the Trump Shuttle from other
carriers and elsewhere. Before the strike, Eastern's shuttle was
its only profitable operation. Since then, it has been running
nearly at full schedule but with skimpy passenger loads as many
passengers have defected to Pan Am Corp.'s rival service.
   Eastern said earlier this week that its share of the shuttle
market, split with Pan Am, has dropped to around 23 percent from 53
percent in December of last year.

<HEAD>MTV Plans to Launch New Comedy Network in Early 1990</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Cable TV programmers are promising viewers yocks
around the clock with a pair of new all-comedy networks.
   MTV Networks, the Viacom Inc. subsidiary that pioneered
all-music programming on cable television in the early 1980s, said
Thursday it plans to launch a cable channel devoted to comedy
programming early next year.
   That service would compete with one from Home Box Office unit of
Time Inc., which disclosed earlier this week it expects to start
the first all-comedy cable network this fall.
   And there may be others. Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc.,
the movie and television programmer, reportedly is considering
starting a comedy channel with Cox Cable Communications, a cable
system operator based in Atlanta.
   David Andersen, spokesman for Cox Cable, said while Cox has
discussed the possibility of teaming up with Columbia Pictures on a
comedy channel, those discussions are ``very preliminary.''
   Columbia Pictures had no comment on the matter, a spokesman said.
   ``Nobody has a corner on the concept,'' said Larry Gerbrandt, an
analyst for Paul Kagan Associates, a media research firm based in
Carmel, Calif.
   But he said cable operators may find the concept appealing
because they need new programming services in their efforts to sign
up more subscribers.
   Rob Stengel, senior vice president for programming at
Continental Cablevision Inc. in Boston, said he hasn't seen
specifics on either proposed comedy channel but said the concept
``makes a lot of sense.''
   ``There is high-intensity consumer interest in comedy,'' he said.
   Continental Cablevision is the third-largest cable system
operator in the nation with about 2.5 million subscribers.
   Stengel said he is not certain many cable operators or
subscribers would be interested in a channel ``that is just a
dumping ground for a lot of old sitcoms or things that have been on
network TV.''
   But he said a service that offers ``new material, new concepts
and new forms'' of comedy could be a valuable addition to a
system's basic service.
   Both MTV Networks and Home Box Office plan to offer their comedy
channels as parts of the basic cable service rather than as a pay
service that customers would have to pay an extra fee to get. Both
channels will carry advertising.
   MTV Networks plans to call its comedy channel the ``HA TV Comedy
Network'' and said it has been developing it for 18 months.
   Tom Freston, chairman and chief executive of MTV Networks, said
he planned to offer cable operators and programmers a chance to buy
a stake in the service, a feature that he called ``a unique slant.''
   Barry Kluger, a spokesman for MTV Networks, said another
difference would be that HA TV Comedy would specialize in offering
longer programs such as original situation comedies and movies.
   Home Box Office's plans call for comedy hosts to make liberal
use of short clips from comedy shows, movies and performances in
their shows.
   Freston noted that MTV has gained a lot of experience over the
years with three basic cable services _ Nickelodeon launched in
1979, MTV: Music Television in 1981 and VH-1: Video Hits One in
1985.
   Home Box Office is the leading pay TV programer with its HBO and
Cinemax services.

<HEAD>Fast-Food Giant Hires Two New York Ad Agencies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Burger King Corp., in an attempt to boost sluggish
sales and improve the focus of its advertising, has awarded most of
its $215 million account to two New York agencies.
   ``The concept of a dual-agency partnership allows for
synergizing some of the best minds in the advertising business,''
said Gary Langstaff, Burger King's executive vice president of
marketing.
   The fast-food giant's new management Thursday hailed the
unorthodox strategy, although some analysts speculated the two
agencies _ D'Arcy Masius Benton &amp; Bowles and Saatchi &amp; Saatchi _
could end up grappling for control of the account.
   ``I'm skeptical as to whether two agencies can put Burger King's
interest first over their own individual interests,'' said John
McMillin, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities in New York.
   D'Arcy will focus on Burger King's image, and Saatchi &amp; Saatchi
will concentrate on promotions and products, according to
restaurant executives.
   The agencies are expected to devise a marketing plan by Jan. 1,
Langstaff said. He said he won't know how the account will be
divided until they submit their plans.
   ``There's a lot to be done. There's been a lot of negative stuff
written,'' said Edward J. Wax, chief executive officer of Saatchi &amp;
Saatchi, who called the two-agency approach fascinating. ``It's a
big challenge. But we're excited.''
   His agency in the past has handled Wendy's and Arby's, Wax said,
and experienced executives from those accounts will work on Burger
King.
   Miami-based Burger King, taken over as part of Britain-based
conglomerate Grand Metropolitan's January acquisition of Pillsbury
Co., will continue working with several other advertising and
promotional agencies on special projects.
   The Pillsbury subsidiary had sales of $5.4 billion from 5,800
restaurants during fiscal 1988.
   Burger King fired N.W. Ayer Inc., which came up with the ``We do
it like you'd do it'' theme, as its national ad agency last month
after the campaign was criticized as ineffective. Ayer will stay on
through mid-August.
   Ayer was hired in September 1987 as Burger King ended an 11-year
association with J. Walter Thompson of New York. Thompson created
the highly criticized campaign featuring a search for Herb, a nerd
who had never been to a Burger King.
   Subsequent campaigns from Thompson that used the themes ``This
is a Burger King Town'' and ``The Best Food for Fast Times'' failed
to make a significant impression with fast-food customers.
   Langstaff, hired in April after three years with Hardee's, said
Burger King must carve out its own niche and develop its own image
to differentiate itself ``from the big boys,'' meaning McDonald's.

   If Sen. Patrick J. Leahy, D-Vt., has his way,
the Agriculture Department will either send its proposal to
streamline meat inspection back to the drawing board or see
Congress do it through legislation.
   ``If producers of food have learned anything from the Alar and
other scares the last two months, (it is that) this is not the time
to do anything to give the suggestion of less safety in food,''
Leahy said Thursday.
   Putting off final decisions on the plans is not enough, he said.
The department should ``just withdraw them'' and start over.
   Leahy commented a day after consumer and labor organizations
charged that a streamlined inspection system proposed by the
department for cattle carcasses at packing houses could result in
more contamination of the beef supply.
   Under the proposal, federal inspectors at 40 to 50 of the
largest slaughter plants, accounting for about 80 percent of the
nation's beef, would rely more on company workers to keep hair,
mud, excreta and other contaminants from the beef supply.
   One result would be to speed up the lines of carcasses moving
along the inspection route, leaving inspectors less time to check
for abcesses, tumors and other abnormalities.
   Leahy said the nation's food supply is now safe, but that if the
USDA ``takes this step, I'm not sure we can guarantee it.''
   The chairman said in a telephone interview that, in his 15 years
in the Senate, he had never seen a time when ``people are more
concerned about food safety than they are now. For decent
inspection of all types, people are willing to pay the tiny amount
extra that it costs.''
   Leahy said he has been pressing the USDA for more than two years
to make changes in its meat and poultry inspection system and to
modify some of the proposals it has under consideration.
   If changes aren't made by the department, he said, ``Congress is
going to do it legislatively'' when it writes the 1990 farm bill.
   Department officials say they won't decide whether to proceed
with the proposed inspection revisions until they review public
comments submitted after the proposal was made Dec. 1.
   The meatpacking industry, led by the American Meat Institute,
wants the plan reviewed by a scientific panel before it is finally
approved to ensure that meat safety would not be diminished.
   A separate but equally controversial department proposal
announced last November would reduce the number of federal
inspectors at plants that turn out chicken soup, hot dogs and other
processed meat and poultry items.
   One goal of this ``risk-based'' system would be to use computers
and other technology to replace some of the day-by-day surveillance
by federal inspectors in processing plants with good records.
   The proposed program would ease up on ``good'' plants and allow
a certain degree of self-policing. But those with poor inspection
records would be subject to closer supervision.
   Leahy said both proposals ``ought to be withdrawn and sent back
totally to the drawing boards,'' although he added that some
aspects of each may make a lot of sense and perhaps should be
reconsidered.
   Have the Agriculture Department and Secretary Clayton Yeutter
gotten Leahy's message?
   ``I hope they have,'' he said. ``Because, administratively, the
department could take all the steps necessary to assure safety and
quality. If they are unwilling to do it administratively, then I
can guarantee the Congress is going to do it legislatively.''

   A report by the Agriculture Department says
the value of U.S. agricultural exports to the Soviet Union may
climb to a record level this calendar year.
   Substantially larger corn sales and much higher wheat prices are
expected to push the U.S. farm export value to the Soviet Union
``well above'' last year's $2.25 billion, the department's Economic
Research Service said Thursday in its preliminary report.
   Exports in 1988 were nearly 2{ times the value of shipments in
1987 and were exceeded only in 1979 and 1984, the report said.
Furthermore, the United States this year may expand its share of
Soviet grain imports from about 30 percent in 1987 and 45 percent
in 1988.
   ``Last year, the USSR took 12 percent of the value of all U.S.
grain and feed exports, and the U.S. share of all Soviet
agricultural imports was an estimated 14 percent,'' the report said.
   Analysts said Soviet agricultural imports from all foreign
sources in 1989 may climb 10 percent above last year's level,
estimated at $16.5 billion.
   ``Grain probably will replace sugar as the leading Soviet
agricultural import in 1989,'' the report said.
   Soviet planners ``remain committed to a high degree of
self-sufficiency in food,'' and their policies primarily emphasize
``increasing supplies rather than controlling demand,'' it said.

yen, the U.S. currency ranged between 138.15 and 138.90 yen during
the day.
   ``The dollar's rising momentum took a respite today,'' said
Noburu Yokohashi of the Foreign Exchange Fund Department at
Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank.
   But Yokohashi predicted the dollar next week would approach the
140-yen level, which he said the market considers an important
psychological barrier.
   During morning trading, the Bank of Japan sold an estimated $400
million to support the yen, traders said. The nation's central bank
does not customarily comment on its market interventions.
   Finance Minister Tatsuo Maruyama told a news conference today
there was ``no reason at the moment for Japan to change its
monetary stance,'' despite speculation the central bank may be on
the verge of hiking its official discount rate to counter the
rising dollar.
   Maruyama attributed the dollar's continued strength against the
yen to ``moves by speculators'' and said such activities must be
countered by intervention in currency markets.
   On the stock exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected
issues, which lost 136.12 points Thursday, gained 145.63 points or
0.43 percent to finish the week at 34,001.96. Volume on the first
section was an estimated 750 million shares, up from Thursday's 600
million.
   ``Trading on the stock market was inactive because of the lack
of fresh incentives and the approaching weekend holiday,'' said
Kinji Ishizuka of Daiwa Securities Co.
   He said the decline in the dollar against the yen had helped
boost stock prices.

<HEAD>Idaho Bans Use of Alar on Apples</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOISE, Idaho (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Idaho has effectively banned the use of Alar
on apples, becoming the first state to restrict the use of the
suspected cancer-causing chemical.
   ``Even though there is no conclusive evidence of the health risk
associated with Alar, the continuing controversy is threatening our
world-class product,'' Gov. Cecil Andrus said Thursday. ``That is
simply unacceptable.''
   Spokesmen for Idaho's $26 million apple industry estimated
growers have lost more than $1 million this season because
consumers are concerned about the health risks of Alar. Idaho
produces about 3 million bushels of apples per year.
   Andrus said the Idaho Apple Commission asked him to restrict the
use of Alar by signing an emergency order requiring anyone who has
Alar to report to the Department of Agriculture the amount on hand.
   A permit must be obtained before it can be used, and growers
marketing any apples treated with Alar must notify the state.
   State Agriculture Director Richard Rush said it amounted to a
ban on Alar for food production.
   Larry Link, executive director of the Apple Commission, said
most Idaho growers have stopped using the chemical anyway. It
normally is applied to apples through the end of June to produce
uniform ripening.
   Four U.S. senators said they would ask Congress to ban the use
of Alar on apples.
   Derl I. Derr, president of the International Apple Institute,
has said growers are already planning to eliminate the chemical,
which is produced by Uniroyal, Inc.

<HEAD>Ford Chairman Says Air Bags To Be Standard In Nine Models</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nine lines of Ford Motor Co. cars will
have supplemental air bags as standard equipment in the 1990 model
year, Chairman Donald E. Petersen disclosed this week.
   The Tempo and Topaz, which are produced at a Ford Motor plant in
nearby Claycomo, are not among the nine lines. But Ford would offer
air bags as options on them instead, Petersen announced Thursday.
   Petersen, who was in Kansas City to receive the Midwest Research
Institute's Trustee Citation for his leadership and emphasis on
quality, did not specify which nine lines would be outfitted with
the air bags.
   About 500 people attended the annual dinner of the non-profit
independent organization, which does research for government,
private business, associations and individuals.
   In his speech, Petersen also stressed the importance of quality
in all facets of customer and community relations. He gave as an
example Ford's recent decision to shift the site for its new paint
shop at Claycomo to the east to distance it from homes of nearby
residents.
   ``The change was not without some financial cost to Ford,'' he
said. ``But it was worth it.''
   In an interview after the award presentation, Petersen said
workers at Ford's Claycomo plant have shown marked improvement in
productivity over the years.
   Nine years ago in a visit to Kansas City, Petersen, who was then
president of Ford, chastised employees at Claycomo for absenteeism
and poor productivity.
   ``Claycomo has become an excellent example of the tremendous
progress we're making in developing a real sense of teamwork,''
Petersen said.

<HEAD>Merrill Lynch Choses Lakewood Center Site</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LAKEWOOD, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. Inc. will open a
regional operations center in Lakewood, eventually creating 900 new
jobs within the New York-based financial services giant.
   Data-processsing and bookkeeping functions for customer accounts
will be housed at the new facility, on a 13.9 acre site in the
Academy Park office complex.
   Company officials outlined the proposal at a news conference
Thursday in Gov. Roy Romer's office.
   Merrill Lynch has agreed to buy the 207,000-square-foot Denver
Service Center building from Manville Corp. to house the operations
center, but the purchase has not yet been completed. The company
will gut and remodel the building.
   An incentive package of $1.24 million in grants and loans was
given to Merrill Lynch by the Colorado Office of Economic
Development, the Greater Denver Chamber of Commerce and the City of
Lakewood.
   Merrill Lynch will open the facility late this year or in early
1990 and will employ 350 by next year. The operation will reach a
full employment level of 1,020 including the present 120 within
three years, said Mario Nigro, senior vice prsident.
   The majority of the jobs will be entry-level clerical positions.
But Nigro said the center will also hire skilled technicians and
profesionals. The operations center will include ``a fairly
involved legal operation,'' Nigro said. Some 600 to 700 employees
will be hired locally. The rest will relocate from other regional
operations centers.
   Landing Merrill Lynch is ``a very significant event in our
economic history,'' Romer said. It marks the biggest economic
development coup, in terms of jobs, since U S West selected Boulder
in 1987 for its research laboratory and a potential 1,500 jobs.
   Colorado's economic development blueprint targets the financial
services industry, Romer said. Landing Merrill Lynch will enhance
Colorado's ability to get the kinds of companies it wants, he said.
   ``Lakewood took a very aggressive posture with merill Lynch once
they decided on Colorado as the site for their regional
operation,'' said John Mullins, director of Lakewood's Department
of Economic Development.
   ``What we brought to the table was job training funds, in
addition to those provided by the state, in the amount of
$160,000.'' The city also is contributing $150,000 of a $500,000
loan the state is making to the New York-based brokerage.
   Earlier this year, American Express got $80,000 in job training
funds from the city when it moved operations to Lakewood, Mullins
said.

   The stock market staged a broad advance today,
extending its recent rally as interest rates fell.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 13.93 to 2,484.05
in the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by nearly 5 to 2 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 692 up, 269

   Interest rates declined in the credit markets this morning.
Prices of long-term government bonds, which move in the opposite
direction from interest rates, posted gains ranging to more than $5
for each $1,000 in face value.
   That served to reinforce spreading hopes on Wall Street that the
Federal Reserve would succeed in its effort to engineer a ``soft
landing'' for the economy _ restraining inflation without causing a
recession.
   Analysts said the market also seemed to be benefiting from a
sort of bandwagon effect.
   The recent gains in the market, they noted, have put pressure on
money managers who have been holding large cash reserves to try to
catch up with the performance of their fully invested competitors.

<TEXT>
   The oil companies and the governments who are
supposed to clean up after spills did a ``wholly insufficient'' job
of responding to the Alaska oil spill, says a report sent to
President Bush.
   It was the strongest criticism yet leveled in the wake of the
disaster that spilled 11 million gallons of oil into Alaska's
pristine Prince William Sound after the tanker Exxon Valdez hit a
clearly marked reef.
   The 37-page report sent to Bush on Thursday was ``critical of
everybody,'' said a Department of Transportation official.
``Critical of the state, of Alyeska (pipeline company), Exxon, the
federal government.''
   ``In view of the fact that everything had been going so well for
so many years, I think everybody got a little complacent,'' said
the source, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The report was prepared by Transportation Secretary Samuel
Skinner and William K. Reilly, administrator of the Environmental
Protection Agency. They visited Alaska five days after the March 24
accident.
   While the report criticized all agencies and companies, it also
noted that even if had better safeguards had been in place, the
largest oil spill in U.S. history was too enormous to contain, the
source said.
   Skinner ``has indicated that there is no technology available
today that could really have coped with that amount of oil in that
period of time in that particular climactic condition,'' the source
said.
   ``It escaped in such an incredible hurry, so fast, that even if
the equipment had been in place, it wouldn't have been enough,'' he
said.
   During their trip to Alaska, Skinner and Reilly directed efforts
by the National Response Team, a group of 14 agencies that
participated in the cleanup, to prepare a report assessing damage
and cleanup efforts. Results of the report were reported in today's
editions of The Washington Post.
   The review noted that although six contingency plans were
available to cope with accidents, their implementation was not
coordinated or organized.
   Exxon's shipping subsidiary, which owns the Exxon Valdez, had a
voluntary plan but ``no specific details,'' the report said.
   Cleanup technologies were ``primitive'' and more research should
done in that area, the report said.
   Alyeska Pipeline Service Co., which operates the Trans-Alaska
pipeline and the shipping terminal in Valdez, had a plan in place
to break up crude oil with chemical dispersants. But it failed to
take into account that the dispersants were stored in Arizona and
would take several hours to reach Alaska, the report said.
   ``Alyeska was not prepared to respond to this spill,'' it said,
according to the source.
   The report recommended that Congress pass laws ensuring that
operators of oil tankers create a fund large enough to pay for
cleanups. It noted that existing oil spill funds would have been
rapidly depleted ``if Exxon had not voluntarily assumed financial
and cleanup responsibility for the spill.''
   Earlier this week, Skinner proposed legislation to increase oil
spill liability and compensation. The bill would require a fund of
at least $500 million, financed by a 1.3-cent-per-barrel oil
industry surcharge.
   White House officials could provide no details about the report.
``I know nothing about a report,'' a spokesman said.
   Also Thursday, Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., accused the
nation's oil companies of taking advantage of the spill to raise
gasoline prices.
   ``I suspect foul play. I say that candidly,'' D'Amato said at a
news conference in his Capitol Hill office. ``I suspect an
opportunity psychologically that the oil companies felt that they
could increase their prices.''
   The senator released copies of a letter he sent to Energy
Secretary James Watkins asking for ``an expeditious and thorough
investigation and evaluation'' of the nationwide gasoline price
increases since the spill.
   Gasoline prices climbed an average of 11.2 percent in April, the
fastest rate on record, from 97.4 cents to $1.098 per gallon.

<HEAD>Congress Finishes 1990 Budget, But Stalls Over 1989 Veterans' Money</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Subs 6th graf, Senate Minority, to expand on Dole comment about
Senate's action</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Congress is finished with the $1.17 trillion
federal budget for 1990 in uncommonly early fashion, but a
House-Senate spat is delaying money needed this year for veterans
until at least next week.
   The Senate gave final approval to next year's spending plan
Thursday on a 63-37 vote. A majority of Democrats and Republicans
voted for the plan, and it was the earliest lawmakers have disposed
of their guide for subsequent spending and taxing bills since 1978.
   But things did not go quite as smoothly with the veterans'
money, which lawmakers have been hoping to provide before they go
home for the upcoming Memorial Day recess.
   On a voice vote, the House provided $1.2 billion for the
Department of Veterans Affairs to help see the agency through the
Sept. 30 end of the 1989 fiscal year. The money would be for
compensation payments, health care, and other programs.
   The Senate, on its own voice vote, only provided the agency with
enough money to see it through June 15, estimated to be about $75
million.
   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., said the Senate action
``assures America's veterans that we've acted responsibly'' to
provide some funds while the differences with the House are ironed
out.
   Because Congress cannot send bills to the president for his
signature unless both chambers approve identical measures, the
discrepancy meant final action is not possible until the House
returns to the capital next week.
   The Senate left town Thursday evening until May 31, meaning that
if the House refuses to adopt the Senate's bill, the veterans'
money will be unavailable at least until then.
   The department and GOP lawmakers have said delays in providing
the money will mean diminished care for veterans at hospitals and
clinics. Democrats have said that without the money, service
cutbacks would not occur for several weeks.
   By providing only a piece of the veterans' money, the Senate
left the potential for a must-pass bill _ future legislation
containing the rest of the veterans' funds _ to which other
programs favored by senators can eventually be attached.
   Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Robert Byrd, D-W.Va.,
said there are ``many, many programs'' that need extra money this
year. He cited $6.6 million he would like for a program that gives
subsidies to air carriers that serve remote communities.
   The veterans money had been held up in the House for several
weeks because it was part of a multi-billion-dollar package
providing money for many programs this year. Hours of bargaining
among party leaders resulted in the veterans' funds being split off
and considered separately.
   An $822 million chunk of the original measure was for anti-drug
programs, which Democrats said was needed immediately and
Republicans said could wait until next year. Lawmakers plan to
resume their dueling on that issue next week.
   Congress' work on the 1990 budget proved predictably
uncontentious because the plan merely ratified a deficit-reduction
deal shaped last month between President Bush and congressional
leaders.
   That pact achieved a claimed $28 billion in savings, cutting the
projected deficit to $99.7 billion _ just within the Gramm-Rudman
balanced-budget law's 1990 target of $100 billion.
   That agreement allowed Bush to honor his campaign pledge of ``no
new taxes,'' and Democrats to shield domestic programs from
spending slashes. This preserved political priorities, but even
supporters admitted it limited their ability to shrink the deficit.
   ``For fiscal year 1990, there simply is no broad consensus in
this body in favor of higher taxes or deeper spending cuts,'' said
Senate Budget Committee Chairman James Sasser, D-Tenn.
   The budget would pour additional money next year into domestic
efforts for space, health, education and low-income assistance. It
restrains the growth of defense spending to below the inflation
rate, limiting it to $299.2 billion.
   Additional tax receipts of $5.8 billion would have to be
collected. Other savings would come from paring the growth of
Medicare by $2.3 billion, selling $5.7 billion worth of federal
assets, and raising government fees by $2.7 billion.
   About 15 percent of federal spending next year _ $181 billion _
would go to pay interest on the national debt, which is projected
to grow to $2.8 trillion this summer.
   The budget does not require the president's signature.

<HEAD>Preate Objections Off Base, USAir Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   USAir is defending plans to purchase eight
Eastern Airlines gates at Philadelphia International Airport
against charges by the state attorney general that the deal would
create a ``near monopoly'' in Pennsylvania.
   ``The objections raised by the Pennsylvania Attorney General are
based on an erroneous and simplistic assessment of competition in
the passenger air transportation markets served from
Philadelphia,'' USAir said in comments filed Thursday with the
federal bankruptcy court in New York overseeing Eastern's financial
troubles.
   Attorney General Ernie Preate moved to block the deal earlier
this month after USAir said it would spend $70 million to buy the
gates from Eastern, which filed for bankruptcy protection in March
after being grounded by a labor strike.
   In a petition filed with the court, Preate said USAir may be
trying to dominate air service in Pennsylvania by purchasing the
gates. By dominating the market, USAir could raise fares, he said.
   The purchase would give USAir the majority of gates at the
state's two largest airports, Philadelphia and Greater Pittsburgh
International.
   ``Pennsylvania consumers already enjoy unrestricted air fares
that are lower than fares offered by other major airlines in
markets of comparable distance,'' said Randall Malin, USAir's
executive vice president for marketing.
   ``The attorney general also ignored the fact that a recent U.S.
Department of Transportation study concluded that USAir's average
fares at Pittsburgh actually decreased by 6 percent between the
first half of 1985 and the first half of 1988,'' he said.
   USAir cited its unrestricted fare of $108 one way for the
185-mile flight from Pittsburgh to Harrisburg. Fares charged by
other airlines on trips of similar distance range from $168 to $194.
   USAir also said its $126 one-way unrestricted fare from
Pittsburgh to Philadelphia is more than 40 percent cheaper than
fares charged by other airlines on similar trips.
   The purchase of eight Eastern gates at Philadelphia would
increase USAir's total at the airport by only four, to 19, because
USAir plans to dispose of four Piedmont gates. The Piedmont gates
are on a concourse separate from the one used by USAir.
   Piedmont and USAir plan to merge Aug. 5.
   The Eastern gates on an adjacent concourse would be more
convenient to passengers, USAir said. The additional gates also
would allow for new service for Philadelphia passengers, the
company said.
   USAir also said there is ample space for other airlines to
expand their service at Philadelphia. Eleven gates will be
available when a new terminal is completed in 1991.
   USAir operates nine daily departures from each of its
Philadelphia gates, while seven other major airlines average only
four departures from their gates.
   The attorney general's office will respond at a bankruptcy court
hearing expected to occur no earlier than June 7, said Jack Lewis,
a Preate spokesman.

   Grain and soybean prices opened lower this
morning on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Soybean prices were down on disappointing export sales figures.
Prices also were pressured by overnight rain and forecasts of more
precipitation over the weekend.
   Analysts also blamed the drop in corn prices on the rain. They
also attributed the loss to the quiet export market.
   The weather also forced down wheat prices. However, there is
concern the heavy rains reported in parts of the central plains
will cause the loss of crops.
   Prices may be helped by the purchase yesterday of 200-thousand

   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which closed Thursday
at a new post-crash high, climbed 22.55 to 2,492.67 by noontime on
Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by more than 2 to 1 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 952 up, 398

   Interest rates declined in the credit markets this morning.
Prices of long-term government bonds, which move in the opposite
direction from interest rates, posted gains ranging to more than $5

   That served to reinforce spreading hopes on Wall Street that the
Federal Reserve would succeed in its effort to engineer a ``soft
landing'' for the economy _ restraining inflation without causing a
recession.
   Analysts said the market also seemed to be benefiting from a
sort of bandwagon effect.
   The recent gains in the market, they noted, have put pressure on
money managers who have been holding large cash reserves to try to
catch up with the performance of their fully invested competitors.

<TEXT>
   The first of the new Boeing 747-400 jumbo
passenger jets destined for the European market has been christened
in ceremonies at The Boeing Co.'s widebody aircraft assembly plant
here.
   At the same time, a Dutch government aviation official said
Thursday that major stumbling blocks in the way of delivery of more
of the planes were resolved.
   ``We have reached a basic agreement in broad terms,'' said
Henrik Wolleswinkel, director of the Netherlands Department of
Civil Aviatibly a matter of days or weeks until we
have a fon. ``It's probainal agreement.''
   Wolleswinkel characterized the talks as ``very fruitful.''
   The 747-400, one of 13 purchased by Dutch flag carrier KLM,
landed today at Amsterdam's Schiphol airport after an eventless
ferry flight from Seattle.
   Present at the Boeing facility for Thursday's christening were
Jean Young, wife of Andrew Young, mayor of Atlanta; Loek
Vanameyden, deputy president of KLM Airlines; and Phil Condit,
executive vice president of Boeing Commercial Airplanes. Mrs. Young
poured champagne over the jet's bow, christening the new blue and
white 747 ``the City of Atlanta.''
   Wolleswinkel said there will be a meeting to work out the
details of the agreement, but most of the work to be done is of a
tech
   Asked about the reports, a spokesman for No. 10 Downing St., the
prime minister's offices, said, ``We're not saying anything about
it at all because it's a personal matter. That's as far as it
goes.''
   Several tabloids warned readers not to attempt such a treatment
themselves.
   The Daily Express reported it had discovered the Indian woman
who was not identified in Vanity Fair. It identified her as a woman
named Veronique who lived in a three-story Victorian semi-detached
house in Shepherd's Bush, west London.
   One of Britain's more serious newspapers, The Guardian, quoted
from the Vanity Fair profile, calling it in a headline a ``Shock
Revelation On The Source of Mrs. T's Vigor.''

<TEXT>
   Two major accounting firms, Arthur Young &amp; Co.
and Ernst &amp; Whinney, have agreed in principle to a merger that they
say would form the world's largest accounting agency, the companies
announced today.
   In statements issued in London and New York, the companies
confirmed they have reached an agreement to join their worldwide
practices into a new firm called Ernst &amp; Young.
   The partnerships of both organizations will begin voting on the
proposed merger in June, the companies said. The announcement said
it was expected that the firms will begin joint opertation as soon
as practical after the vote.
   In a joint statement, the firms said their respective chairmen,
William L. Gladstone of Arthur Young and Ray J. Groves of Ernst &amp;
Whinney, would become co-chief executives of the combined firm
which will be based in New York. Young is now based in New York and
Ernst &amp; Whinney is in Cleveland.
   ``The combining of our two organizations will give us unrivaled
professional service capabilities to meet and anticipate needs of
clients of all sizes at the local level and in the global economy
into the final decade of the century and beyond,'' the London
statement said.
   ``We are a good match of skills, specialities and cultures which
we are confident will be integrated effectively,'' it said.
   At a news conference in New York, Gladstone and Groves said they
did not expect to lay off employees or to lose clients due to
conflicts as a result of the merger.
   Gladstone said he expects the combined firm will have more
employees a year from now than the firms have separately today.
   ``Most of what we do is serve clients,'' Groves said. ``That
doesn't change when you put two firms together.''
   A merger would unite the world's fourth- and fifth-largest
accounting firms, creating the No. 1 firm with a combined $4.3
billion in revenue, the firms stated. That would surpass world
accounting leader KMPG-Peat Marwick, which had $3.9 billion in
revenue last year.
   Ernst &amp; Whinney had $2.2 billion in revenue last year, while
Arthur Young had $2.1 billion. Domestically, the joined firms would
have $2.02 billion in revenue, just ahead of Chicago-based Arthur
Andersen &amp; Co.'s $1.71 billion.
   The combined firms also would have 6,100 partners and about
70,000 employees working in 100 countries, the statement said. In
the United States, the combined operation would have 2,105 partners
and 25,391 total employees.
   A report in Bowman's Accounting Report, an Atlanta newsletter,
said international partners met last week and details were hammered
out Monday at a secret meeting at Arthur Young headquarters in New
York as security guards stood outside.
   The newsletter said rumors of the merger had circulated for
months. It said the greatest threat to the combination would be
competition among partners in Canada and England, where both firms
have strong practices.
   Arthur Bowman, editor of Bowman's Accounting Report, said the
merger was being taken because of the firms' relative positions in
the middle of the pack of Big Eight accounting firms. He also
predicted mergers by smaller accounting firms that need to stay
competitive.
   ``The major emphasis here is both firms are slow growers
relative to the other Big Eight,'' Bowman said in a telephone
interview. ``It also creates a lot of pressure on the firms at the
bottom of the Big Eight to do something.''

<HEAD>Growers Say Western Montana Cherry Crop is Total Loss</HEAD>
<DATELINE>POLSON, Mont. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The harsh Montana winter may have dealt a
permanent blow to the state's western cherry industry, growers say.
   ``It's very grim,'' said Polson grower Corky Morehead, head of
Treasure State Cherries. ``It's a loss of $5 (million) or $6
million'' to the local economy.
   There are virtually no cherry blossoms on the trees. And while
some trees are beginning to leaf, the leaves are few and scattered,
raising fears of permanent damage.
   ``My concern is for the health of the trees,'' said Robert
McClain of Yellow Bay, president of the Flathead Lake Cherry
Growers Association.
   Morehead said that if tree losses are heavy, ``I don't think
we'll ever see the cherry industry the way it has been.''
   Growers have been saying for weeks that the crop had been badly
damaged. But until now, they had hoped that trees in protected
locations might still blossom and yield partial crops.
   But Howard Thomas, a Finley Point grower, said that while he's
seeing a few blossoms, it amounts to two or three blossoms where
``we should see two or three thousand.''
   The damage occurred Jan. 31 and in subsequent days, when an
arctic front followed a January thaw. Temperatures plummeted 50
degrees in a few hours, freezing and splitting trees that had begun
to lose winter dormancy.
   In addition to the damage to sweet cherries, most apricots were
killed, along with peaches and nectarines. Recent mild winters had
encouraged growers to cultivate those crops.

<HEAD>Lawsuit in Failed Effort to Build Disney Attraction</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Plans for a South American pavilion at Walt
Disney World's Epcot Center were derailed by prospective partners
from Paraguay, according to a damage suit filed in Orlando by an
Argentinian company.
   The Circuit Court lawsuit, seeking $35 million in damages from
five Paraguayans, said the failure of the investors to put up $2
million for shares in the venture caused the company to forfeit its
license to operate the pavilion at Disney.
   The suit was filed by the Florida subsidiary of Eskantorp S.A.,
a development company based in Buenos Aires, which said it entered
into preliminary agreement with Disney in 1985 as a developer and
sponsor of the tourist site.
   Walt Disney World officials would not comment on the suit
Friday, saying they had not seen it.
   Epcot's World Showcase section includes 11 foreign-themed
pavilions, usually subsidized by the countries involved and
investors from those nations.
   Eskantorp said company officials met many times with senior
officials of the Paraguayan government, and Gen. Guillermo Clebsch,
chief of military forces at that time, had agreed that the
government would be an investor in the pavilion.
   Clebsch and four Paraguayan investors agreed to acquire 10
percent of the oustanding shares of Eskantorp for $2 million to pay
for the initial planning of the pavilion, Escantorp said in court
documents. Escantorp then entered into an agreement with the
Orlando-area tourist resort.
   However, the Paraguayans then backed out, causing Eskantorp to
forfeit its right to go through with the venture, the suit said.
   John Boudet, a lawyer in Orlando for Eskantorp, said the Buenos
Aires developer ``has made an effort to bring in some new
investors'' that would allow it to go ahead with the development,
but efforts have not been successful.
   The $35 million sought in damages represents the value of the
license over 25 years, Boudet said.
   ``Another way of looking at it is that it's 25 years worth of
lost profits'' to Eskantorp, the lawyer said.

<TEXT>
   A barge normally equipped with cleanup
gear was unloaded for repairs at the time the Exxon Valdez ran
aground, and it took workers 10 hours to reload it, oil industry
officials testified today.
   After workers loaded the barge with 25 tons of equipment,
including booms, a skimmer and other cleanup gear, it took 3{ hours
to get it to the stricken tanker, said Lawrence Schier, Alyeska
Pipeline Service Co.'s marine manager.
   An investigator asked Schier how much oil would had been removed
from Prince William Sound if the loaded barge had been docked at
Bligh Reef when the ship ran aground March 24, spilling 10.9
million gallons of crude oil.
   ``I can't respond to that,'' he said.
   On Thursday, Alaska's environmental commissioner said the Exxon
Valdez disaster proved the oil industry couldn't fulfill its
promise to contain and remove a massive oil spill quickly in Prince
William Sound.
   But an Exxon Corp. executive told federal investigators that it
was impossible to stop the spread of the crude that gushed out of
the tanker.
   ``I don't think there was a power on Earth that could have
removed it from the water,'' Exxon Shipping Co. President Frank
Iarossi said.
   Iarossi and Commissioner Dennis Kelso testified in the third day
of hearings before a National Transportation Safety Board panel.
The hearings into the spill's cause continue today and are
scheduled to conclude Saturday.
   At Exxon's annual shareholders meeting in Parsippany, N.J., on
Thursday, environmentalists lashed out at Exxon Corp. by calling
for the oil company's chairman to resign and for senior executives
to forgo bonuses to help pay for the nation's worst oil spill.
   Chairman Lawrence G. Rawl tried for hours to deflect criticism,
repeating earlier public apologies and pledging to clean hundreds
of miles of waters and oil-soaked beaches. He also showed a short
film on the cleanup effort to allay concerns the company is failing
to do enough.
   State and industry officials at the hearings in Alaska took
turns Thursday blaming each other for making matters worse in their
response to the disaster.
   Kelso said Exxon and Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. failed to meet
deadlines to get equipment to the spill site, as required in their
contingency plan.
   Alyeska, a consortium of oil companies that owns and operates
the trans-Alaska oil pipeline and the Valdez terminal, is
responsible for initially responding with booms and cleanup gear to
spills within the sound.
   ``If the powers that were present, Alyeska and Exxon, did what
they had committed to do in the plan, it would be a very different
situation today,'' Kelso testified.
   Iarossi defended Exxon's response, noting his company mobilized
equipment from around the world and got it to the scene quickly
despite logistical problems.
   Even if the required equipment had been ``right around the
corner,'' the spill's vastness made mechanical removal of the oil
impractical, Iarossi said.
   The panel also heard more testimony on alcohol abuse, a central
issue in the disaster. Joseph Hazelwood, the tanker's captain who
had a history of alcohol problems, was fired after he was charged
with operating the Exxon Valdez while drunk. He has pleaded
innocent.
   Iarossi said Exxon ships go through rigorous alcohol and drug
searches involving dogs, trained searchers and occasionally U.S.
Customs Service agents.
   The company's alcohol and drug policy resulted in 55
disciplinary cases among its ship crews over five years, including
34 firings, he said. Five of those cases were appealed by unions
and all five were overturned by arbitrators, who found the policy
too severe.
   Iarossi said ``it was just by chance'' that he heard of
Hazelwood's alcohol problem in May 1985 after the captain completed
a hospital treatment program. Iarossi noted that such employee
information usually is kept confidential.
   After Hazelwood returned to work, he was monitored by two
supervisors who visited him in port twice a month and discussed his
behavior with the crew. ``It was all iced tea and Perrier,''
Iarossi said.

<HEAD>Japan Warns Against Being Named an Unfair Trader in Semiconductors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSAN MOFFAT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japanese trade officials warned that targeting
Japan for sanctions by naming it an unfair trader in semiconductors
would be counterproductive, American officials said Friday.
   In regular consultative meetings Thursday and Friday, Japanese
officials explained plans for expanded purchases of foreign
semiconductors by Japanese companies, including electronics firms
and automobile manufacturers.
   But the U.S. government remains ``highly dissatisfied'' with the
U.S. share of the Japanese semiconductor market, an American trade
official said.
   ``Our dissatisfaction is with the fact that the (foreign) share
of the Japanese market remains at about 10 percent while the
competitiveness of U.S firms would indicate a much higher share,''
said the official, who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity.
   ``Although continuing efforts are being made (by the Japanese
government and companies) and progress is being made, the United
States continues to be highly dissatisfied'' with American market
access, the official said.
   Japanese officials countered that the government is doing its
best to open the semiconductor market, and that Japan would ``react
very strongly'' if it is named an unfair trader in semiconductors.
   ``We are doing affirmative action concerning the penetration of
U.S. semiconductors to the Japanese market,'' said Hidehiko
Nishiyama, deputy director of the Americas-Oceania Division of the
Ministry of International Trade and Industry.
   ``We have been demanding that the U.S. side remove existing
sanctions, so it's unimaginable for us to get additional
sanctions,'' Nishiyama said in a telephone interview.
   Within a few weeks Japan may be named for obstructive trading
practices under the ``Super 301'' provision of the 1988 Omnibus
Trade Act, which requires that the U.S. government study sanctions
against countries that do not remove unfair trade barriers after
negotiations.
   ``The Japanese side expressed the view that the naming of
semiconductors under section 301 would be counterproductive,'' the
U.S. official said.
   Semiconductors are a key issue among the many complaints the
United States has about Japanese trade practices. ``Failure to
implement the market-access provisions of the (1986 U.S.-Japan
semiconductor) agreement is very serious and affects billions of
dollars in sales,'' the U.S. official said.
   However, both the U.S. and Japanese sides described the meetings
as ``constructive.''
   ``There is clearly a commitment (by the Japanese side) to
improve market access for U.S. semiconductor firms,'' the U.S.
official said.
   Both sides apparently did not raise an earlier dispute about
whether the 1986 agreement between the two countries promised the
United States a 20 percent share of the Japanese semiconductor
market by 1991. Officials from both countries ``understand that it
is not constructive to discuss the 20 percent issue,'' Nishiyama
said.
   On the issue of high-definition television, MITI said ``Japanese
firms had indicated a willingness to work with U.S. semiconductor
producers on HDTV projects,'' the U.S. official said.
   The two sides also discussed ``TRON,'' a basic computer design
standard created by a Japanese professor that is intended to make
future computers more compatible and flexible. TRON stands for
``The Real-time Operating System Nucleus.''
   Participation in the development of TRON is open to U.S. firms
and a number are participating, but Japanese companies are ahead in
developing TRON products.
   Because Japanese schools and the semi-private telecommunications
giant Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. are considering the TRON
standard for some future purchases, the U.S. is concerned about
preventing ``government intervention in the marketplace which
creates a trade barrier,'' said another U.S. official, who also
demanded anonymity.

<TEXT>
   The list of Big Eight accounting firms is
shrinking by one, robbing another memorable phrase from a business
lexicon that has already lost the Seven Sisters oil companies and
the BUNCH computer makers.
   Two Big Eight members, Arthur Young &amp; Co. and Ernst &amp; Whinney,
announced Friday they agreed to merge to form the world's largest
accounting agency.
   Traditionalists were swallowing hard at the loss of the
athletic-sounding Big Eight to refer to the nation's biggest
accounting firms.
   ``This has got people buzzing,'' said Arthur Bowman, editor of
Bowman's Accounting Report in Atlanta.
   The phrase Big Eight is dead because no other firm deserves
membership, Bowman said. Big Seven is still hard on the ears, he
said, but then, ``This isn't a football conference.''
   The ever-changing face of corporate America is erasing one handy
phrase after another.
   Seven Sisters ceased to work as a term for the world's largest
oil companies in 1984 when one of them, Gulf Corp., was swallowed
by another, Standard Oil Co. of California, now Chevron Corp.
   The BUNCH is no longer a good acronym for rivals to
International Business Machines Corp., since the B bought the U,
the H got out of computers and the C has shrunk drastically.
   (B was for Burroughs Corp.; U for Univac, later Sperry Corp.; N
for NCR Corp.; C for Control Data Corp.; and H for Honeywell Inc.)
   The Fortune 500 biggest industrial companies and the Forbes 400
richest Americans won't be outdated because they accommodate an
ever-changing membership. The same goes for the Dow Jones average
of 30 industrial stocks.
   The endangered monikers are those with fixed memberships.
   Big Three means less than it once did for automakers and
television networks. The automakers are losing ground to Japanese
auto plants in the United States; the networks face competition
from cable and such would-be ``fourth networks'' as Fox
Broadcasting Cos.
   In banking, the club of about 15 ``money center'' banking
companies in big cities is losing its glorified status because of
the success of such aggressive ``superregional'' institutions as
NCNB Corp. of Charlotte, N.C.
   And lost in history are such terms as Club 17, for a group of
powerful investment banks that were sued unsuccessfully by the
government for antitrust shortly after World War II.
   Big Eight had an unusually long lineage. Bowman said the firms
were identified when the Securities and Exchange Commission was
created in the 1930s, and Fortune magazine popularized the term in
the 1960s. The cutoff point made sense because No. 8 was more than
twice the size of No. 9.
   Two contradictory trends account for the disappearance of
familiar phrases: the pursuit of bigness through mergers and the
defeat of big companies by smaller, nimbler competitors.
   The death of the dinosaurs actually is the more significant
trend, argues Robert Sobel, a professor of business history at
Hofstra University in Hempstead, N.Y.
   ``The tendency today is toward decentralization rather than
centralization,'' he said Friday.

   Share prices surged Friday on the London Stock
Exchange despite new economic figures which could create concern.
   Volume jumped to its best level since late January, buoyed by
strong buying by British and foreign investors and by computerized
trading programs, analysts said. Turnover rose to 856.8 million
shares from 633.2 million traded on Thursday.
   ``There are one or two institutions who feel they've missed out
on this current rally, and we have seen some panic buying,'' one
dealer said.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index rose 27.4
points, or 1.3 percent, to close at 2,204.7, its best level for the
session. It was the key indicator's third straight post-crash high.
   At its lowest, the index was up 3.2 points shortly after the
opening.
   The market's strength came despite a British government report
showing stronger inflation than had been expected. The figures
showed that the country's annual inflation rate rose to 8 percent
in April from 7.9 percent in March.
   The Financial Times 30-share index rose 27.4 points, to 1,837.5
at the close. The Financial Times 500-share index rose 16.58 points
to close at 1,252.24.

   The stock market surged ahead today, making a
run at the 2,500 level in the Dow Jones industrial average with a
push from falling interest rates.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which closed Thursday
at a new post-crash high, climbed 29.70 to 2,499.82 by 3 p.m. on
Wall Street.
   The last time the average closed above 2,500 was Oct. 13, 1987,
when it stood at 2,508.16 six days before the crash on Black Monday.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by more than 2 to 1 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 1,008 up,
488 down and 483 unchanged.
   Interest rates declined in the credit markets today. Prices of
long-term government bonds, which move in the opposite direction
from interest rates, posted gains ranging to more than $5 for each
$1,000 in face value.
   That served to reinforce spreading hopes on Wall Street that the
Federal Reserve would succeed in its effort to engineer a ``soft
landing'' for the economy _ restraining inflation without causing a
recession.
   Analysts said the market also seemed to be benefiting from a
sort of bandwagon effect.
   The recent gains in the market, they noted, have put pressure on
money managers who have been holding large cash reserves to try to
catch up with the performance of their fully invested competitors.
   Gainers among the blue chips included General Electric, up } at
54; American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, up ] at 35{; General Motors, up
] at 42, and McDonald's, up 2[ at 59.
   Avon Products led the active list and dropped | to 32] on top of
a 7[-point slide Thursday, after Amway dropped its hostile
$39-a-share bid for the company.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
1.66 to 178.95. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up .93 at 353.51.

   Miniature porcelain critters decorating an
office window are the only evidence of animals at Avon Products
Inc.'s test laboratory.
   The cosmetics maker has closed the facility at its research and
manufacturing center in Suffern, N.Y. where until early last summer
it squirted beauty potions on rabbits and mice to determine if the
concoctions were safe. Besides disbanding its animal-testing
operation, Avon says it hasn't asked independent laboratories to
test on animals since mid-March and Chairman James E. Preston has
declared the company will discontinue testing permanently.
   It might sound like Avon should win plaudits from animal welfare
activists, but it's about to get a booby prize.
   On June 2, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals plans to
bestow a ``Pinocchio Award'' on the Avon chairman, contending Avon
has lied about its commitment to stopping the use of animals in
product safety tests and has failed to honestly describe past
procedures.
   Avon, recently involved in a nasty tussle repelling unsolicited
takeover advances from Amway Corp., has been receiving lots of
unwanted attention from PETA's operatives. They've picketed
Preston's Connecticut home and are urging an international boycott
of Avon products.
   The Pinocchio award, a 10-foot replica of a nose, is bound to
generate some additional unwelcome publicity.
   The problems confronting Avon are similar to those facing many
companies that have relied on animals for decades to test products
ranging from eye shadow to candy bars.
   But Avon and other cosmetics makers have been targeted by the
anti-animal-testing movement to heighten publicity, even though
they account for only a tiny portion of the animals subjected to
lab experiments.
   Henry Spira, a long-time animal rights activist and head of a
New York-based coalition that once campaigned against Revlon Inc.,
says pointing a finger at beauty peddlers that use eye-blinding
tests on rabbits is an ``optimal'' strategy.
   ``The juxtaposition of the dream of beauty and the nightmare of
the rabbits'' is a perfect protest theme, says Spira.
   Moreover, there is a strong perception that testing cosmetics is
a frivolous reason for maiming or killing animals. Lipstick and
mascara aren't among life's necessities.
   This perception helps evoke more sympathy than if protesters
targeted animal testing in the development of life-saving drugs or
medical treatments.
   Spira doesn't condone PETA's tactics against Avon and applauds
companies for taking steps toward recognizing animal rights. ``It
doesn't make any sense to me to dump on a company that's
responsive,'' says Spira.
   Susan Rich, coordinator of PETA's campaign, doesn't deny that
Avon and other companies have moved away from testing.
   ``We certainly acknowledge the progress that they have made,''
she says, citing the decline in the number of animals used by
industries. Avon, for example, says 2,423 animals were used in
1988, down from 4,063 in 1987 and 14,500 in 1981.
   But she says only constant reminders will keep Avon and other
companies accountable. ``We've not asked these companies to stop
animal testing overnight. But we want them to commit themselves to
timetables.''
   The decision was made to intensify pressure on Avon partly
because, in PETA's view, the company sent confusing signals about
its position.
   Avon chief Preston, in a recent interview, attempted to clarify
where his company stands.
   ``We are not going to authorize, condone or request any
testing,'' he says. However, Avon opposes prohibiting such tests
and has lobbied against legislative bans proposed in several states.
   Part of the reason for this stance may be the rapid
breakthroughs in skin care treatments and beauty formulas.
Suppliers, anxious to market these products, may want to check
their safety quickly. Until non-animal test methods are readily
available, inventors may have no choice but to test on animals.
   Moreover, Preston says some important overseas markets for U.S.
cosmetics require animal tests. Avon doesn't intend to ask
foreigners to change their laws.
   There is no U.S. law that requires cosmetic testing on animals.
But the Food and Drug Administration says it will expect companies
to conduct such tests until alternatives are accepted.
   ``The FDA position is that the use of animal tests by industry
to establish the safety of regulated products is necessary to
minimize the risks from such products to humans,'' the agency said
in a recent policy letter.
   Given these circumstances, Preston says: ``Our position is the
safety of consumers and the international competitiveness of the
American cosmetics industry comes first.''
   For now, Avon and a few U.S. competitors say they are willing to
delay introduction of new products until safety can be determined
through non-animal tests.
   In suspending animal tests last week, Mary Kay Cosmetics became
the latest beauty-products firm to say it may have to delay release
of some items.
   The drive toward alternatives accelerated in January when Noxell
Corp., maker of Noxzema skin creams and Cover Girl cosmetics, said
it was screening many cosmetics by applying them to tissue cultures
in lab dishes instead of squirting them into rabbits' eyes.
   Avon also has replaced this procedure, the so-called Draize eye
irritation test.
   The test, named after a former FDA official, has been widely
used for nearly 50 years. The solution to be tested is injected
into the eyes of rabbits, usually an albino breed because the
absence of natural coloring allows easier observation. Rabbits were
selected because they lack tear ducts that would help wash away the
solution.
   A growing number of companies in the cosmetics, chemical and
pharmaceutical industries are attempting to validate new non-animal
testing methods.
   At labs nationwide, experiments are done with bacteria, cell
cultures, living tissue in test tubes and computer simulations.
   Some labs, like the Johns Hopkins Center for Alternatives to
Animal Testing, were established with financing from companies in
industries in which animal testing has been standard procedure.
   In the end, companies may find that non-animal replacements are
far less expensive and much more accurate than animal tests
developed decades ago. National Testing Corp. of Palm Springs,
Calif., for example, says its Eytex method adopted by Avon is
significantly cheaper than the Draize test.
   Says activist Spira: ``Even if there were no animal movement,
the movement for alternatives would continue on its own.''

   Futures prices of grain and soybeans closed mixed
Friday in light trading on the Chicago Board of Trade as investors
pulled back from the market to see if growing conditions improve
over the weekend.
   Soybean futures were mostly lower due to the uncertain prospects
for more rain next week, analysts said.
   ``What happened in the market was that most people didn't want
to establish new positions until after the weekend,'' said Dale
Gustafson, an analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in Chicago.
``They wanted to see what the rains were like over the weekend.''
   Corn prices closed higher on reports of less-than-expected rain
in the Corn Belt. Corn prices also were supported by reports the
Soviet Union and Mexico may be in the market soon.
   Wheat prices dropped on trader disappointment over a lack of new
purchase orders from the Soviets or China. The market also was
affected by good rains in Missouri, where there were fears of crop
loss because of dryness.
   At the close, wheat was 1 cent to 5 cents lower with the
contract for delivery in May at $4.03\ a bushel; corn was 1\ cents
lower to 1} cents higher with May at $2.74} a bushel; oats were 2{

<HEAD>Boeing Announces Design Changes To Avoid Miswiring, Misplumbing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE TIBBITS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Boeing Commercial Airplanes has made design
changes to prevent wiring and plumbing mistakes such as those found
on 94 Boeing jets in a recent government-ordered inspection,
company officials said Friday.
   Boeing said it was using different-sized fittings, putting the
connections in different locations and using labels and
color-coding to prevent the problems found in jetliner engine and
cargo hold fire detection and extinguishing systems.
   ``No design can be 100 percent foolproof for manufacturing and
maintenance, but the new connections should be very close to it,''
Ben Cosgrove, Commercial Airplanes senior vice president, said in a
news release.
   The Federal Aviation Administration was expected to approve the
changes, Boeing said. Once approved, the new designs will be
incorporated into production lines this fall and were expected to
be available for retrofitting in previously delivered aircraft
shortly thereafter.
   In January, the FAA issued an airworthiness directive requiring
U.S. operators of Boeing jets to inspect for possible miswiring and
misplumbing. Systems were inspected on 1,600 Boeing planes,
including hundreds operated by foreign carriers, and 95
misconnections _ two on one plane _ were found and corrected.
   No accident or emergency resulted from the miswirings or
misplumbings, although Boeing said eight of the misconnections
would have resulted in false information displays to a flight crew.
   The FAA said earlier that in one instance involving a
twin-engine Boeing 757 flown by a foreign carrier, engine fire
control panel modules were reversed so that a fire in the right
engine would indicate a fire in the left, and vice versa.
   ``Probable result is that both engines are shut down from
extinguishant discharge and fuel cut-off actions,'' the FAA
concluded.
   Boeing's problems with miswiring first received attention in the
spring of 1988 when Japan Air Lines complained about misconnections
in a fire suppression system. The complaint was among a number
Boeing received from customers about aircraft quality and the
Seattle-based aerospace company has said it has been attempting in
the past year to improve workmanship.
   The FAA ordered the inspections Jan. 31 after limited directives
turned up problems in 17 aircraft.
   The Jan. 8 crash of a British Midland Airways 737 in Scotland
raised speculation that the pilot may have been deceived by faulty
wiring into shutting down his only good engine. The cause of that
crash, in which 44 people died, is under investigation.
   Crossed wiring was eliminated as a cause by investigators for
Britain's Civil Aviation Administration, Commercial Airplanes
spokeswoman Liz Reese said, ``but now we carry that stigma.''
   Cosgrove said the changes include using different-sized wire and
plumbing connections for different functions.

<TEXT>
   Merger fever broke out Friday at the highest
levels of the accounting profession as Big Eight firms firms Arthur
Young &amp; Co. and Ernst &amp; Whinney proposed combining their worldwide
practices to create the world's largest professional services
organization.
   The two firms said they had agreed in principle to a merger that
would create a $4.3 billion worldwide organization offering
accounting, auditing, tax and consulting services and employing
70,000 people in 100 countries.
   The partners of both firms will begin voting on the proposal in
June, and leaders said they were confident the deal would be
approved.
   The new organization would be called Ernst &amp; Young and the
chairmen of the respective firms, William L. Gladstone of Arthur
Young and Ray J. Groves of Ernst &amp; Whinney, would become its
co-chief executives.
   Gladstone and Groves issued a joint statement saying the merger
``will give us unmatched professional service capabilities to meet
and anticipate our clients' needs worldwide.''
   Gladstone told a news conference the new firm would be able to
serve clients better as they expand in Europe where trade barriers
are coming down.
   He said the merged organization's presence also would be
stronger than the firms are separately in such industries as health
care, manufacturing and high technology, financial services, real
estate, retailing, energy and the media.
   Groves said Ernst &amp; Whinney, for example, has been a leader in
service to hospitals while Arthur Young has been strong in the
biotechnology field. Combining operations, he said, would give the
new concern ``much more depth than we were before.''
   ``It looks like they are trying to lower overhead costs as well
as increase their professional coverage in parts of the country and
the world where they are have weak spots,'' said Donald J. Kirk,
professor of accounting at Columbia University's Graduate School of
Business.
   Kirk, a former chairman of the Financial Accounting Standards
Board, said the merger could prompt other Big Eight firms to
consider mergers. ``We may well see another one or two in the next
few years,'' he said.
   But he said there won't be a quick wave of mergers because of
the cultural differences among accounting firms. ``They are often
quite different in their internal training and attitudes,'' he said.
   Groves and Gladstone said they don't intend to lay off employees
or to lose clients because of conflicts as a result of the merger.
   Groves said the employees would continue doing what they have
been doing, and hopefully would attract more work. Gladstone said
the combined firm will have more employees a year from now than the
firms have separately today.
   They said clients they have spoken with about the deal have
responded positively to their planned merger.
   Gladstone said accounting and auditing firms generally are
sought out for their expertise in a field, such as the media or
energy business, and often count competing companies as clients.
   The clients recognize that their accountant or auditor will not
share their financial secrets with anyone else, he said.
   Among the clients of Ernst &amp; Young would be the soft drink
giants Coca-Cola Co. and Pepsico Inc., oil companies Amerada Hess
Corp., Mobil Corp., Phillips Petroleum Co. and financial companies
American Express Co., PaineWebber Group and TransAmerica Corp.
   The merger of Arthur Young and Ernst &amp; Whinney would top the
previous biggest accounting merger that saw Peat Marwick combine
with KMG Main Hurdman two years ago into a firm called KPMG.
   According to the Atlanta-based newsletter Bowman's Accounting
Report, KPMG was the world's largest accounting firm in at $3.9
billion in world revenue in 1988 while Arthur Andersen was the
biggest U.S. accounting firm at $1.71 billion.
   Ernst &amp; Whinney posted $2.19 billion in world revenue and $1.17
billion in U.S. revenue last year, while Arthur Young had $2.05
billion in world revenue and $843 million in U.S. revenue, Bowman's
stated.

<TEXT>
   Westinghouse Electric Corp. officials said
Friday they were delighted a federal judge in New Jersey has
shifted to arbitration the bulk of the legal allegations made by
the Philippines over a mothballed nuclear reactor.
   Only one of 15 counts, claiming the Philippine people were
harmed by alleged corruption in the contracting of the plant, will
remain in federal court to determine its merits, said Louis
Briskman, deputy general counsel for Westinghouse, the nation's
largest producer of nuclear power plants.
   U.S. District Judge Dickinson R. Debevois in Newark ruled
Thursday that the claims made by the current government of
President Corazon Aquino belong before the International Chamber of
Commerce as specified in the contract Westinghouse entered with the
government when Ferdinand Marcos was president.
   ``This ruling is strong affirmation of the position we've been
taking'' since the suit was filed against Westinghouse and the
project architect-engineer, Burns &amp; Roe Enterprises Inc., said
Nathaniel Woodson, president of the Westinghouse's international
division.
   Attorneys for the Philippines argued the corruption surrounding
the contract was so massive that the federal court should keep the
case and disregard contract provisions specifying arbitration as
the forum for settling disputes.
   The Aquino government claims bribes were paid to the Marcos
government to win the contract, and it filed the suit in an attempt
to void the contract.
   The suit also alleges that the $2.3 billion, 600-megawatt plant
on the Bataan Peninsula, which has been mothballed since its
completion in 1985, is unsafe.
   Briskman said there is no evidence any of the $17 million
Westinghouse paid in fees to contract consultants in the
Philippines went to Marcos as a bribe. He said he was confident of
winning any court case on the remaining count.
   Westinghouse has claims pending before the Chamber of Commerce
in Switzerland seeking $30 million in remaining charges on the
project.

accused the American Stock Exchange of improperly copying its new
stock index-based security, a charge the American exchange promptly
denied.
   The exchanges both began trading the securities _ known as Cash
Index Participations on the Philadelphia exchange and Equity Index
Participations on the Amex _ a week ago after the Securities and
Exchange Commission lifted a ban on them.
   Amex copied parts of the Philadelphia exchange's rules for the
security that were submitted to the SEC, Thomas A. Russo, an
attorney for the Philadelphia exchange, wrote in a letter to Amex
attorneys.
   The Philadelphia Stock Exchange sought SEC approval for the Cash
Index Participation, a security based on the ``basket'' of stocks
represented by the Standard &amp; Poor's Index of 500 stocks, in March
1988.
   Two weeks later, the Amex filed with the SEC seeking approval
for its Equity Index Participation, a similar instrument.
   ``It took me a few months just to get the rules specific,'' said
William W. Uchimoto, the Philadelphia exchange's general counsel.
``I don't think they could develop a product in two weeks that's
identical to ours.''
   In a prepared statement read by Amex spokesman Bob Shabazian,
the exchange said, ``There is no basis to contend infringement of
any purported copyright.''
   The Chicago Board Options Exchange also came out with a similar
product. However, Uchimoto said, because that exchange had not
begun trading its version and was not aggressively promoting it the
Philadelphia exchange decided not to complain.
   If the Amex and the Philadelphia exchange cannot agree on ways
to make the Amex product substantially different, Uchimoto said, he
planned to sue to bar Amex from trading the security.
   He said one change that might satisfy the Philadelphia exchange
would be for the Amex security to be tied to an index other than
the S&amp;P 500.
   The index participation products are based on the current value
of indexes of stocks. Investors receive quarterly cash payments
equal to a proportionate share of any regular cash dividend
declared on the component stocks of the underlying index.
   The complaint came a day after the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals in Chicago denied a request by the Chicago Board of Trade
and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange to temporarily halt trading of
the securities.
   Fearing the securities would cut into their futures business,
the two Chicago exchanges have argued the securities actually are
futures contracts and should be regulated by the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission, rather than the SEC.

<HEAD>Energy Futures Prices Mostly Higher</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Energy futures prices finished higher Friday,
driven up mainly by traders adjusting their holdings before
expiration of the June crude oil contract.
   The June contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
grade of U.S. crude, rose 40 cents to $20.60 a barrel on the New
York Mercantile Exchange. On Thursday, the contract settled up by 7
cents.
   The July crude oil contract slipped 6 cents to $18.74 a barrel.
It will become the near-month contract Tuesday after expiration of
the June contract Monday.
   Jerry Samuels, a broker with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., said
trading in the June contract was particularly hectic in the final
minutes of the session.
   Most of the activity was due to maneuvering by traders ahead of
the weekend and before the final day of trading in the June
contract, he said.
   Uncertainty about what may occur at the June 5 gathering of OPEC
members discouraged crude prices from moving sharply in either
direction, energy traders said.
   At the Vienna meeting, members of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries will review their current output quota of 18.5
million barrels a day. There has been speculation that the ceiling
will be raised.
   Prices of refined petroleum products traded on the Mercantile
Exchange moved slightly higher.
   The June contract for wholesale gasoline, which rose 1.26 cents
on Thursday, settled at 65.19 cents a gallon, up 0.66 cent.
   Wholesale home heating oil for June delivery increased 0.51 cent
to 48.06 cents a gallon. The contract had risen 0.41 cent on
Thursday.

<HEAD>Dollar Rally Resumes; Gold Keeps Falling</HEAD>

<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar's rally resumed Friday despite
containment efforts by central banks and the price of gold
continued tumbling.
   Central banks managed to keep a cap on the dollar through Asian
and European trading but lost control as trading shifted to the
United States.
   Dealers absorbed the dollar sales by the government banks and
came back for more, said Robert Pucciariello, a trader for Union
Bank of Switzerland in New York.
   The U.S. currency closed at its highs of the day but below its
highest point of the week. This week the dollar reached levels not
seen since 1987 against the Japanese yen and since 1986 against the
West German mark.
   Although the dollar's swift rise has captured most of the
attention, the dive in gold has been even swifter.
   Speculative selling of gold accelerated at the end of April when
it fell below $380 a troy ounce, an important level for traders
chart price trends, according to Jeffrey Nichols, president of
American Precious Metals Advisors Inc.
   On Friday, Republic National Bank of New York said gold was bid
at $364.50 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, down sharply from $368.30
late Thursday to a level not seen in nearly three years. A year ago
gold was around $450 an ounce.
   Gold also has been hurt by the rise of the dollar and by an
unexpected increase in the world gold supply, Nichols said. The
volume of gold entering the open market set an annual record last
year and is continuing at high levels this year, he said.
   The Federal Reserve, the Bank of Canada, the Bank of Japan and
several European central banks sold dollars, traders said. West
Germany's Bundesbank apparently did not take part, they said.
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.6190 from $1.6180 late
Thursday. In New York sterling fell to $1.6120 in late trading from
$1.6175 Thursday.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell 0.11 yen to close at 138.77 yen. Later in London,
the dollar was quoted at 138.75 yen. In New York the dollar rose to
139.01 Japanese yen from 138.65 late Thursday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Thursday's rates, included: 1.9770 West German marks, up from
1.9670; 1.7635 Swiss francs, up from 1.7568; 1.1912 Canadian
dollars, down from 1.1927; 6.6905 French francs, up from 6.6585;
and 1,439.00 Italian lire, up from 1,433.00.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Thursday's
rates, included: 1.9695 West German marks, up from 1.9660; 1.7583
Swiss francs, up from 1.7552; 6.6700 French francs, up from 6.6490;
2.2210 Dutch guilders, down from 2.2240; 1,435.00 Italian lire,
down from 1,439.50; 1.1911 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1927.
   Gold fell in London to a late bid of $365.75 a troy ounce, its
lowest level since August 1986, from $370.75 late Thursday. In
Zurich, gold closed at a bid of $365.20, down from $370.25 late
Thursday.
   Earlier in Hong Kong, gold fell $4.51 to close at a bid of
$367.22 a troy ounce.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery fell to $365.70 an ounce from $369.70 Thursday.
   Silver bullion fell on the London market to a late bid of $5.35
a troy ounce from Thursday's $5.43. On New York's Comex, silver
bullion for current delivery fell to $5.229 an ounce from $5.401.

<HEAD>Grains and Soybeans Mixed In Light Trading</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HERBERT G. McCANN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices were mixed
Friday in light trading on the Chicago Board of Trade as investors
retreated from the market to see if growing conditions improve over
the weekend.
   On other markets, precious metals continued sliding, livestock
prices were mixed, meat was higher and energy futures rose in
modest trading.
   Grain and soybean prices mostly were lower due to the uncertain
prospects for rain next week, analysts said.
   Wheat settled 1\ cents to 5 cents lower with the contract for
delivery in May at $4.03\ a bushel; corn was 1\ cents lower to 1}
cents higher with May at $2.74} a bushel; oats were 2{ cents to 4}
cents lower with May at $1.80{ a bushel; soybeans were a { cent
lower to 2\ cents higher with May at $7.39 a bushel.
   ``What happened in the market was that most people didn't want
to establish new positions until after the weekend,'' said Dale
Gustafson, an analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Ind. in Chicago.
``They wanted to see what the rains were like over the weekend.''
   Corn closed higher on reports of less-than-expected rain in the
Corn Belt. Corn prices also were supported by reports the Soviet
Union and Mexico may be in the corn market soon.
   Wheat prices dropped due to trader disappointment over a lack of
new purchase orders from the Soviets or China. The market also was
affected by good rains in Missouri, where there had been fears of
crop loss because of dryness, analysts said.
   Gold and silver prices continued tumbling on New York's
Commodity Exchange. Prices have plunged partly due to the recent
surprising rise of the dollar, which has drawn investors away from
the metals.
   ``The dollar remains strong despite intervention by the central
banks,'' said David Syphen, an analyst with Merrill Lynch Capital
Markets Inc. in New York. ``There is a lot of disinvestment. The
fundamentals on gold and silver don't justify accumulation.''
   Gold was $3.70 to $6.20 lower with May at $365.70 a troy ounce;
silver was 17.2 cents to 21.1 cents lower with May at $5.229 a troy
ounce.
   Livestock prices were mixed and meat futures rose on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange.
   Hog prices rose on lighter-than-expected marketings, said Dale
Benson, an analyst for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago.
   In livestock futures trading, participants continued to look at
the Agriculture Department's cattle-on-feed report, which showed
larger-than-expected April placement of cattle in feed lots. The
increased placements could lead to lower prices later in the year.
   Live cattle were .25 cent lower to .03 cent higher with June at
70.70 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .20 cent lower to .25 cent
higher with May at 76.77 cents a pound; hogs were .08 cent to .60
cent higher with June at 48.72 cents a pound; and frozen pork
bellies were .40 cent to 1.08 cent higher with May at 36.10 cents a
pound.
   Energy futures were higher in light trading on the New York
Mercantile Exchange, with prices driven up during maneuvering by
traders before expiration of contracts for delivery in June.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil was 3 cents lower to 40 cents
higher with June at $20.60 a barrel; heating oil was .22 cent to.51
cent higher with June at 48.06 cents a gallon; and unleaded
gasoline was .16 cent to .66 cent higher with June at 65.19 cents a
gallon.

<HEAD>Digital Equipment Imposes Salary Freeze</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN COOPERMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Digital Equipment Corp., seeking to avoid layoffs
despite a sharp drop in earnings, said Friday it will delay all
salary increases for its 73,500 employees in the United States.
   The salary freeze will go into effect July 2, the beginning of
Digital's fiscal year, and will be re-evaluated in late September
or October, said spokeswoman Nikki Richardson.
   ``Because business is down in the U.S. for Digital as well as
for computers in general, we need to control costs in order to
improve profitability,'' Ms. Richardson said.
   Digital stock closed at $96.625, down 50 cents in composite
trading Friday on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock has sagged
badly since 1987, when it peaked at $199 a share.
   The Maynard-based computer maker reported earnings in the
quarter ending April 1 of $256.4 million, down almost 16 percent
from $305.1 million a year earlier. Operating revenues were $3.12
billion, up 11 percent over the same period of 1988.
   Ms. Richardson said no layoffs or early retirement incentives
are planned. She noted that Digital has never had a layoff in its
31-year history.
   Although there is no written guarantee against layoffs, Digital
and its employees have a tacit covenant of lifetime job security,
said George Colony, president of Forrester Research Inc., a
computer market researcher in Cambridge.
   ``I think it is virtually impossible for Digital to break that
covenant. They cannot do it, and I don't think they should do it. I
think this is a better alternative to layoffs,'' he said.
   Digital imposed a previous salary freeze in 1982, during an
industry downturn, but it was lifted after three months when the
company's sales turned around.
   All U.S. employees will experience the same delay in their
salary increases, regardless of their employment anniversary date,
when salary reviews normally take place, Ms. Richardson said.
   Digital's 52,000 employees working abroad will not be affected
by the freeze because ``demand and profitability remain strong in
the international area for Digital,'' she said.
   Analysts said the root of the U.S. downturn is that sales of
personal computers and groups of PCs linked to so-called local area
networks are cutting into demand for Digital's more expensive
minicomputers.
   If that trend reaches Europe and the Far East, Colony said,
Digital may be forced to take additional cost-cutting measures in
the fall.
   ``We expect the next step will be a redeployment of people from
headquarters out into the field, which would be a de facto layoff,
because people don't want to move from Boston to Oshkosh,'' he said.

<HEAD>Holly Sets Bidding Deadline</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Holly Farms Corp.'s latest deadline for
takeover bids passed Friday, but a lawyer for rival poultry
processor Tyson Foods Inc. indicated his client would refrain from
making an offer.
   ``I wouldn't be holding your breath until we bid,'' Rodman Ward,
a Tyson lawyer in Delaware, said Friday afternoon. He declined
further comment.
   Tyson of Springdale, Ark., has pursued Holly Farms since last
October and has been battling with ConAgra Inc. of Omaha, Neb., for
control of the Memphis-based company.
   The takeover battle, worth about $1 billion, is tied up in a
Delaware court and the legal squabbling will likely continue
regardless of how the bidding goes.
   Court records indicate that Tyson and ConAgra have been
negotiating behind the scenes to settle on a buyer of Holly Farms,
a diversified company heavily involved in fresh fryer sales.
   Ted Bailey, a spokesman for Holly Farms, declined to comment on
the bidding, saying a statement would be made after his company's
board of directors met Saturday in New York.
   ``The board will meet about midday, but I don't have any idea
when we will have anything to say,'' he said.
   The Holly board has voted several times to reject buyout offers
from Tyson. A spokesman for ConAgra failed to return phone calls.
   Tyson has previously offered Holly stockholders $63.50-a-share
for their stock, but the tender offer is conditioned on removal of
an asset purchase agreement between Holly and ConAgra.
   That agreement would let ConAgra buy about a third of Holly
Farms if the company is sold to anyone other than ConAgra.
   Tyson is challenging that agreement in court and has accused
Holly Farms of trying to favor ConAgra as a suitor.
   Holly stockholders voted last month to reject a proposal to
merge Holly Farms with ConAgra. The asset purchase agreement stems
from that merger plan.
   Tyson tried to stop the latest bidding for Holly Farms but
Chancellor Maurice Hartnett of Delaware refused the request.
   Hartnett said, however, that the bidding procedures clearly
favored ConAgra over Tyson.

   Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman
David S. Ruder said Friday he was concerned about the resurgence of
program stock trading, which could herald a return of market
conditions similar to those preceding the 1987 crash.
   One day after announcing his resignation, Ruder also said market
changes since the Oct. 19, 1987 crash _ when the Dow Jones
industrial average plunged 508 points _ could help deter but would
not necessarily prevent another collapse.
   Ruder said he did not believe the stock market was overvalued
now. The Dow industrials closed above 2,500 Friday for the first
time since the crash.
   But Ruder said there would be reason to worry if the Dow hit
3,000, partly because of the increasing use of computerized program
trading strategies that some critics have blamed for increasing
stock market volatility during the time of the crash.
   ``What frankly that I have some concern about is that we have
had a return to the markets of program activity and portfolio
trading, particularly by broker-dealer firms acting as
principals,'' Ruder told the Women's Economic Round Table.
   ``The possibility is we may see a 300- to 600-point large price
rise,'' Ruder said. ``If that would happen then I would be
concerned about a drop to follow that.''
   The New York Stock Exchange defines program trading as
strategies involving the purchase or sale of a group of 15 or more
stocks. Most major firms limited their program trading activity
shortly after the 1987 crash amid escalating public criticism of
the practice, although many recently have increased such operations.
   However, the average daily NYSE volume accounted for by program
trading dipped to 7.6 percent in April after two months of advances.
   Ruder said post-crash defensive measures included better
communication among brokerages and exchanges, automation that has
improved market efficiency and the installation of ``circuit
breaker'' rules at that mandate temporary stock trading halts in
the event of huge price drops.
   ``It's as though we have resurfaced all our highways now and you
can drive 150 miles an hour on them. And the question is what will
happen if everybody drives 150 miles an hour,'' he said.
   Ruder announced Thursday he was resigning to resume teaching at
Northwestern University's law school, probably in the fall. He took
over the SEC, which regulates the nation's securities markets, in
August 1987 and has presided over a turbulent period including the
crash and the government's unprecedented fraud prosecution of the
investment firm Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
   Ruder denied he was leaving because of any policy disagreements
with the Bush administration and said the move was a ``personal
decision that I could not commit to President Bush'' for four years
as chairman.
   ``I believe that it is important that the president have someone
to run the commission who is willing to spend a reasonably long
period of time in the position,'' he told reporters. ``When I asked
myself would I be willing to stay through the presidency of
President Bush my answer was `no.'''
   In other comments, Ruder praised the growth in the market for
junk bonds, high-interest rate securities used to finance dozens of
mergers and corporate expansions.
   ``I think the development of an active market in less than
investment grade debt _ junk bonds _ has been a very positive
phenomenon for our country,'' he said. ``I think that market is
important in the continued financing of our companies and I think
it's beneficial.''
   Junk bond financing used in corporate takeovers has been
criticized as rendering the target companies as vulnerable to
failure during a recession, due to their debt burdens.
   Ruder also defended the SEC's civil suit and settlement of
wide-ranging fraud violations against Drexel.
   ``The actvities we outlined in the Drexel complaint involve
injuries to the public by a major professional brokerage firm,'' he
said. ``And I believe it to be part of my job to prevent
professionals in our society from taking advantage of the public.''

   The stock market swept ahead Friday, surmounting
the 2,500 level in the Dow Jones industrial average with
encouragement from falling interest rates.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 30.98 points to
2,501.10, extending its gain for the week to 61.40 points.
   The last time the average closed above 2,500 was Oct. 13, 1987,
when it stood at 2,508.16 six days before Black Monday.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by nearly 2 to 1 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
1,032 up, 519 down and 461 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board hit a two-month high of
242.41 million shares, up from 177.48 million in the previous
session.
   The total was swelled by computer program-driven activity linked
to a set of expiring options and futures on stock indexes. Analysts
said buying of blue chips in these strategies helped push the Dow
above 2,500 just at the close.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 284.01 million shares.
   Interest rates declined in the credit markets Friday. Prices of
long-term government bonds, which move in the opposite direction
from interest rates, posted gains ranging to more than $5 for each
$1,000 in face value.
   That served to reinforce spreading hopes on Wall Street that the
Federal Reserve would succeed in its effort to engineer a ``soft
landing'' for the economy _ restraining inflation without causing a
recession.
   Analysts said stocks also seemed to be benefiting from a sort of
bandwagon effect.
   The recent gains in the market, they noted, have put pressure on
money managers who have been holding large cash reserves to try to
catch up with the performance of their fully invested competitors.
   Gainers among the blue chips included General Electric, up | at
53~; American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, up \ at 35]; General Motors,
up { at 42[; Coca-Cola, up 1 at 59\, and McDonald's, up 1 at 57~.
   Money-center bank stocks rose on fresh hopes for agreement on a
plan to deal with developing countries' debt problems. Citicorp
gained ~ to 31|; Chemical Banking 1 to 35|, and Manufacturers
Hanover } to 34~.
   Avon Products dropped } to 32\ in active trading on top of a
7[-point slide Thursday, after Amway dropped its hostile
$39-a-share bid for the company.
   Avon said Friday it wouldn't buy back shares that Amway and
investor Irwin Jacobs acquired in the course of mounting their
offer.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $26.88 billion, or
0.86 percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained 1.63 to 178.92.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 3.29 to 368.76, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was up 3.27 at 321.24.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market added
2.24 to 442.05. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 353.83, up 1.25.

   The yield on the government's benchmark 30-year
bond fell Friday to its lowest level in more than a year as credit
markets rallied, partly in response to the stronger dollar.
   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond rose 23-32 point, or more
than $7 for every $1,000 in face value, while its yield fell to
8.70 percent from 8.77 percent late Thursday.
   That was the lowest yield since the 30-year bond delivered 8.68
percent on April 8, 1988.
   Analysts said the dollar's continued strength in foreign
exchange _ which increases the attractiveness of returns on
dollar-denominated investments such as bonds _ and the absence of
selling sentiment in the bond market pushed prices higher.
   ``It seems to have a lot of strength,'' said Robert Chandross,
chief economist with Lloyds Bank PLC in New York. ``It's running on
momentum now.''
   Chandross said the market broke through technical support
levels, triggering further buying in speculation that prices would
be bid even higher.
   ``What you have in the bond market is a huge appetite for
dollar-denominated investments. The stability and strength in U.S.
currency has further encouraged foreign investors to be more active
in the market,'' said Maria F. Ramirez, money market economist for
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
   The dollar resumed a rally Friday despite containment efforts by
central banks. This week the dollar has reached levels not seen
since 1987 against the Japanese yen and since 1986 against the West
German mark.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term
governments rose 3-32 to 3-16 point, intermediate maturities were
up between \ and 7-16 point and long-term issues advanced between }
and 25-32 point, according to Telerate Inc., the financial
information service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Hutton Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, gained 2.99 to 1,148.57.
   In corporate trading, industrials also were higher. Moody's

<HEAD>GM Shareholders Hear Upbeat Message from Chairman</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Higher fuel economy regulations for 1990
model-year cars won't compel General Motors Corp. to cut production
of large models in the immediate future, GM Chairman Roger Smith
said Friday.
   Smith, speaking at a news conference following the company's
annual shareholders' meeting, reiterated statements that an
increase in the corporate average fuel economy standard, which will
be 27.5 miles per gallon for the 1990 model year, could result in
closings of plants making large automobiles.
   However, he said, ``I don't see that happening right now for the
1990 year, as we look forward to it. We have to see how the sales
go.''
   He refused to rule out plant closings in 1990 for other reasons.
   Earlier this week, Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner said
he would not seek a change in the regulation requiring automakers'
fleets to average 27.5 mpg.
   That was a break from the Reagan administration, which granted
appeals from GM and Ford Motor Co. to lower the standard. Chrysler
Corp.'s fleet, which has a larger percentage of smaller, more fuel
efficient cars, has had little trouble meeting the requirements.
   Planning production for the 1990 model year has been under way
for months. GM's Chevrolet Division already is selling its 1990
Lumina sedan.
   Smith also said that in the fall, a committee of the board of
directors would be formed to search for his successor. As
previously reported, Smith will step down as chairman of the
world's largest industrial company July 31, 1990.
   At the news conference and the board meeting earlier in the day,
Smith said there was no heir apparent.
   ``We don't have a crown prince,'' he told shareholders. ``We
have a lot of excellent executives.''
   Smith also told stockholders GM was on the way to a
``reindustrialization'' of itself. By the end of the year, Smith
said, GM will have spent nearly $76 billion on building and
modernizing plants and other facilities.
   ``Today, though we still have much more work to do, we've made
excellent progress,'' Smith said. ``We'll go into the 1990s a far
different company from the one that entered the 1980s.''
   Smith singled out a need for the company to improve its North
American operations. Like No. 2 Ford Motor Co., GM's earnings
during the past several years have been buoyed by European
operations.
   ``We want to increase our North American passenger-car market
penetration,'' Smith said. ``Right now, it isn't where we'd like
it.''
   During the 1980s, GM has watched its share of the entire
automobile market shrink from 46 percent as the decade began to
35.8 percent on March 10. Most of that erosion in market share has
has gone to Ford and overseas automakers.

<HEAD>House Committee Releases Memo Alleging Insider Trading by Amway Execs</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House Energy and Commerce Committee said
Friday it is investigating allegations of insider stock trading by
officials of Amway Corp. before the company offered to buy Avon
Products Inc.
   In a letter, Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., asked the chairman of
the Securities and Exchange Commission, David Ruder, to open his
own probe of the allegations. Ruder said in New York that the SEC
planned to investigate as it does whenever it receives such
allegations.
   Amway, a door-to-door sales business headquartered in Ada,
Mich., on May 10 offered $39 a share in a takeover bid for its
larger rival, Avon. Amway withdrew its $2.1 billion offer Wednesday.
   Dingell's committee released a memorandum it had received from
an unspecified source alleging that Otto Stolz, Amway's executive
vice president, and William Nicholson, Amway's chief operating
officer, apparently intended to profit personally when they
purchased Avon stock in late March and early April before the
takeover bid was announced.
   The memorandum said that Irwin Jacobs, a Minneapolis investor
and a partner of Amway, also purchased stock prior to the takeover
announcement. Jacobs, the memorandum said, was being paid out of
profits from trading in Avon stock before the takeover announcement.
   Federal law forbids trading securities based on information not
available to the general public. Avon shares rose more than $2 per
share immediately after the takeover bid was announced.
   Nicholson said the shares were assigned to the partnership with
Jacobs at cost, the transactions were reported to the SEC, and
there was no personal profit involved.
   ``This is the standard part of the smear campaign of Avon and
its advisors to divert attention from their own performance or
problems,'' Nicholson said.
   Avon said no one was available to comment on Nicholson's
assertion.
   Jacobs said the allegations were ``preposterous, plain and
simple.''
   ``It is strictly politically motivated. We welcome any
government agency that wishes to look into this thing. Our books
are wide open to them,'' he said.
   A spokesman for the House committee, Dennis Fitzgibbons,
declined to discuss the source of the memorandum.
   ``The allegations are sufficiently serious that the chairman had
to ask Ruder and the commission to look at them,'' Fitzgibbons said.
   The memorandum said Stolz purchased 10,000 Avon shares on March
23 and 6,600 shares on March 27, at a value of $356,000.
   Nicholson, the memo said, on April 5 purchased options to buy
40,000 Avon shares at $25 per share, with the options costing
$70,400.
   The memorandum alleged that ``the timing and nature of that
trading is consistent ... with attempts to profit personally from
insider trading, not with any purported agency transaction on
behalf of Amway.''
   Meanwhile, investors continued to unload Avon shares Friday,
although the selloff seemed to be subsiding. Avon stock closed at
$32.25 a share, off 75 cents, in composite New York Stock Exchange
trading.
   Avon stock had reached a 52-week high of $41.25 earlier in the
week amid speculation Amway might raise its offer or another, more
generous bidder might emerge. But, after Amway withdrew its
takeover proposal Wednesday night, Avon shares plunged $7.12{ on
Thursday.
   Takeover-stock speculators were nursing heavy losses on Avon
shares and several of them directed pointed questions at Avon
executives during a meeting with financial analysts in New York on
Friday.
   In a related matter, attorneys for Avon said at least eight
lawsuits have been filed against Avon in New York State Supreme
Court on behalf of several shareholders.
   The suits, most of which were filed since Amway and investment
partner Jacobs announced they had acquired a 10.3 percent stake in
Avon, challenge takeover deterrents Avon has adopted.

<HEAD>Electrolux Plans To Acquire Regina</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MARIETTA, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Electrolux Corp., a leading home-care
products company, said Friday it has agreed to buy the Regina
Company Inc., a New Jersey-based maker of products such as vacuum
cleaners and home whirlpool baths.
   Terms were not disclosed and the transcation was subject to
completing a definitive purchase agreement and approval by a
federal bankruptcy judge.
   Regina, based in Rahway, N.J., filed for reorganization under
Chapter 11 bankruptcy laws April 26.
   Steven Cooper, senior vice president and general counsel for
Electrolux, said Electrolux hoped Regina would provide ``a
different channel for retail distribution.''
   Electrolux, a privately-held company, is primarily a direct
sales organization specializing in home-care products such as water
purification products.
   Cooper said details of the purchase agreement and Electrolux's
plans for personnel at Regina were still sketchy.
   Regina has stated its value at $65 million to $70 million, but
the purchase price was subject to negotiations with the bankruptcy
judge, Cooper said.
   ``We want to finish the negotiations as quickly as possible, but
I really can't say how soon that will be,'' he said.
   Electrolux has listed its annual sales at $400 million. Regina's
last full fiscal year yielded about $160 million, Cooper said.
   Cooper said a bankruptcy attorney for Regina had requested a
hearing to be scheduled within 15 days.
   Officials at Regina's corporate headquarters could not be
reached for comment by telephone Friday because they had left their
offices after business hours.
   Regina's ability to survive as an independent company was put in
doubt on May 4, when a U.S. Bankruptcy Judge William Tuohey in
Newark, N.J., refused to approve a $5 million financing package
worked out between the company and its two largest creditors, Chase
Manhattan Bank and Philadelphia National Bank.
   The agreement was contingent on the banks' ability to combine
the new loan with the company's old debt, amounting to about $25
million.
   The banks also demanded to be put ahead of all other creditors
for repayment.
   Tuohey said he rejected the agreement out of concern for
unsecured creditors, who have total claims of $36 million.

<HEAD>Another United Order Gives Boeing Another Record Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE TIBBITS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Boeing Co. set an industry record for single-year
commercial jetliner orders Friday when United Airlines announced
its fourth major order for Boeing aircraft in two years, a 32-plane
package the airline valued at $3 billion.
   United's firm order for 16 extended-range 767-300ERs and options
for another 16 of the widebody twinjets came just three weeks after
United gave Boeing the largest aircraft order ever with a single
manufacturer, for up to 370 planes valued at as much as $15.74
billion.
   And Stephen M. Wolf, United's chairman and president, said his
company's buying spree isn't over for the year.
   ``A third and major order addressing our widebody needs for both
our growing Pacific service as well as for additional domestic
airplanes will be forthcoming later this year,'' Wolf said from
United's Chicago headquarters.
   With the new orders, Boeing has a backlog of 1,535 jets, which
should guarantee prosperity for the jetmaker well into the
mid-1990s.
   Although a crush of orders from airlines and leasing companies
have raised questions on how well the big three jet manufacturers
can keep up, Boeing officials say they have been planning as best
they can for the new work.
   Wolf said the new 767s are envisioned for both domestic and
trans-Atlantic service, even though United does not yet fly to
Europe.
   In United's configuration, the 767s will carry about 200
passengers and will be able to fly from anywhere in the continental
United States to Western Europe.
   Boeing, which lists dollar figures only for firm orders, priced
the 16 firm 767s at about $1.4 billion.
   With the order, Boeing set an industry record for dollar value
of planes ordered in a calendar year: $30.1 billion for 543
aircraft. That mark, also a company record for new orders for the
fifth year in a row, betters the $29.7 billion for 636 Boeing
planes ordered for all of 1988.
   In the past two years, United, which was formed by Boeing in the
1930s but split off in 1934, has given Boeing about $23.4 billion
in new business, counting aircraft options. United now has on order
every type of commercial jet Boeing makes.
   United's April order was for 120 Boeing 737s twinjets and 60
midsized 757s, plus options for 130 737s and 60 757s.
   In May 1987, United ordered 15 747-400 jumbo jets and 21 737s,
worth a total $2.1 billion, and in April 1988, ordered 30 757s and
took options on 30 more in a deal worth $1.3 billion for the firm
orders.
   ``United has been a good customer for a long time,'' said Boeing
spokeswoman Elizabeth Reese.
   Boeing salesmen also are working on getting the United order for
later this year. ``We'll be showing them what we have in the
salesroom,'' Ms. Reese said.
   Wolf said United would receive its first five 767-300ERs in
1991, two more in 1992, eight in 1993 and one in 1994. Four of the
jets on option are to be delivered in 1994, five in 1995 and seven
in 1996.
   The planes will be powered by Pratt &amp; Whitney engines.
   Boeing and its two major competitors, McDonnell Douglas Corp.
and Europe's Airbus Industrie, have been blessed with a crush of
orders in recent years, due to concerns about older aircraft,
forecasts of continued rapid growth of air travel, and a need for
planes to meet tougher noise standards and to be more economical.
   Boeing and McDonnell Douglas both have suffered delays in
delivering new aircraft, Boeing with its 747-400 jumbo jet and
McDonnell Douglas with its MD-11 widebody. But Boeing officials say
they don't expect delays to spread to other assembly lines.
   Ms. Reese said United's new order was anticipated and ``isn't
going to impact the production line because we plan things like
this in advance.''
   Phil Condit, Boeing Commercial Airplanes executive vice
president, said in a briefing last week that Boeing has
substantially met its revised schedule for delivering the new 747s,
though it has had to negotiate penalties with at least four
customers.
   Condit said those delays were due in great part to overly
ambitious plans to introduce four different variations of the jumbo
jet simultaneously.
   Boeing says it is increasing production rates, from 27 jets a
month to 34 by mid-1990s, and is spending $1.1 billion on capital
improvements this year, including major upgrades at its Renton 737
and 757 plant and at its widebody factory in Everett, Wash.
   Condit said Boeing's production schedules are being planned
years in advance, and that the company is carefully increasing
production so as not overwhelm its own and its suppliers' capacity.
