<HEAD>Suspect In Archbishop Romero's Assassination Released</HEAD>

   A Salvadoran accused of conspiring in the 1980
assassination of Archbishop Oscar Romero was freed on bail Thursday
night after his homeland's high court denied a request for his
extradition, his attorney said.
   Alvaro Saravia had been ordered held by President Jose Napoleon
Duarte's government, which accused him of arranging Romero's
assassination on orders of right-wing legislator Roberto
d'Aubuisson, who denied the allegation.
   ``Saravia telephoned one of my associates at 8:30 tonight and
told him `I'm out,''' said his Miami attorney, Neal Sonnett. Saravia
was released on $10,000 bond pending deportation hearings, he said.
   The Salvadoran Supreme Court ruled last month there wasn't enough
evidence linking Saravia to the murder, and said he would not be
subject to arrest if he were sent home.
   Saravia, a former captain in El Salvador's air force, had been
jailed in Miami since November 1987, when he was arrested for a
traffic violation and authorities found he had been in the country
illegally since 1985.
   The Salvadoran government withdrew its extradition request after
its courts ruled that there were no grounds for arresting him on
charges he had violated his visa, and that the extradition request
itself was illegal.
   Romero, an outspoken critic of right-wing death squads, was shot
by a sniper while saying Mass in San Salvador on March 24, 1980.
   In November 1987, President Jose Napoleon Duarte's government
accused Saravia of arranging the assassination and released the
testimony of Amadeo Garay Reyes, who allegedly drove the sniper to
the church.
   The Supreme Court ruled that Garay's testimony was not credible,
partly because he waited more than seven years to come forward with
his story.
   The court also said Attorney General Giron Flores did not have
the constitutional power to ask the United States to send Saravia
back to El Salvador.
   Flores had directly asked the United States for Saravia's
extradition. The case went to the Supreme Court after Saravia's
attorney requested a hearing.
   Sonnett, who is also representing Panamanian Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega against federal drug charges here, said Saravia had gone
home to his wife, who has been living in Miami.

<HEAD>Prisons Don't Want Cancer Victim Jailed in Sewer Dispute</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Wilburt Siegel, the 73-year-old cancer
victim jailed in a dispute over a sewer hook-up, was freed Thursday
after a state prison and a county jail both refused to accept him as
a prisoner.
   Siegel spent Wednesday night in the Lieber Correctional
Institution in Ridgeville. But he was released after state officials
decided they lacked authority to imprison an inmate for civil
contempt of court.
   Siegel was then sent back to Charleston County, but Sheriff Al
Cannon said the county jail couldn't house him because it is
overcrowded.
   He also said the jail didn't have the medical facilities to treat
Siegel, who suffers from rectal cancer.
   Charleston attorney Gedney Howe then asked for a hearing before
Circuit Judge William Howell, who found Siegel in contempt last
November.
   ``Al Cannon and I came to the same conclusion if he couldn't go
to Lieber, he sure couldn't go to the county jail,'' Howe said.
   Before the hearing, Howe said he and the judge discussed options
in the case and said Howell said a motion to appeal the contempt
order could be considered.
   ``I appealed the judge's opinion which will postpone him (Siegel)
going back to jail,'' Howe said. He said appeals to the state
Supreme Court can take some time and ``hopefully he'll be a free man
for at least several months.''
   ``Judge Howell today looked at a difficult problem and found a
way out that was satisfactory to everybody and was legally
correct,'' Howe said.
   ``We're so weary and thankful and we're just going to go to
bed,'' Siegel's wife Hattie said later from the couple's home.
``It's been a rough day.''
   The contempt order stems from Siegels' refusal to obey an earlier
1986 court order that he connect his James Island home to a sewer
line.
   The Siegels have had a decade-long dispute with the James Island
Public Service District over connecting the sewer.
   They say the tap-in point is too far from their septic tank and
would cost them an additional $2,000 and cause them to destroy
several large pine trees in order to make the connection.
   Francis X. Archibald, a spokesman for the state Department of
Corrections, said the issue arose as to whether Lieber should house
the prisoner after Siegel arrived at the prison Wednesday.
   ``They referred it to the department's legal advisor in Columbia
who researched the matter and he said we lacked the authority'' to
house a prisoner jailed for civil contempt, Archibald said.
   He said the decision was based on an attorney general's opinion
of some years back.
   The Siegel case was later the topic of a discussion between
Corrections Department legal advisor Larry Batson and state Attorney
General Travis Medlock and Medlock concurred in the decision,
Archibald said.
   On Wednesday, Cannon escorted Siegel from the modest James Island
house, which was draped with an American flag and where yellow
ribbons were tied around five large pine trees.
   Siegel said he was going to prison for his principles and that he
had been treated unfairly compared to other residents in the area
who had sewer lines closer to their homes or had not been forced to
hook onto the sewer.

<TEXT>
   South Carolina is home to wealthy cotton
plantations, stately antebellum mansions and a growing share of
America's toxic wastes.
   Now, with a 10-year-old waste landfill's license up for renewal,
a debate is looming over the state's role as the nation's ``septic
tank.''
   ``We have been taken advantage of,'' said state Rep. Harry
Hallman, who resigned in November as chairman of the Department of
Health and Environmental Control to take a seat in the House of
Representatives. He's pushing legislation that would tighten state
control of waste disposal.
   The GSX Chemical Services Inc. landfill in Sumter County is one
of two commercial hazardous waste landfills in the Southeast _ the
other is in Alabama _ and is the tomb for a half-million tons of
chemicals. South Carolina is also home to two hazardous-waste
incinerators and one for infectious waste; the Barnwell low-level
nuclear waste landfill, and the troubled Savannah River Plant that
produces nuclear bomb fuel.
   ``It all plays in. The reason GSX has become an issue is not
because it is the only issue, but because it's a symbolic issue,''
said Democratic state Sen. Phil Leventis, a long-time critic of the
landfill.
   Some 130,000 tons of chemical garbage will be buried at GSX this
year, about 70 percent from industries in more than 30 other states
and Puerto Rico. Two incinerators, in Roebuck and Rock Hill, can
accept a total of 58,920 tons a year of hazardous waste; 75 percent
is from other states. A third can take 36,500 tons of infectious
waste, which comes from 10 states and Canada.
   The Chem-Nuclear Systems Inc. low-level radioactive waste
landfill at Barnwell _ the only one in operation in the nation _
took 900,000 cubic feet of contaminated clothing, tools and other
debris in 1988 and expects the same this year.
   The state produces 85,000 tons of hazardous waste a year,
according to the health department. It has plenty of room for its
neighbors' garbage.
   ``It seems we're a patsy for somebody, doesn't it? It seems that
the federal government has found a place that doesn't resist,'' said
Shelly Green of Sumter, a retired hotel manager and Air Force major.
``It just seems that we're getting more than our share.
   ``I feel that at some point in time, that place will be a real
problem to us, and that we shouldn't be required to take other
states' waste.''
   The 279-acre GSX landfill opened in 1978. Its bottom rests 10
feet above an aquifer and its lip is 400 yards from Lake Marion, one
of the Santee Cooper lakes created in World War II to provide
hydroelectric power to underdeveloped areas and Charleston's
defense-related industries.
   State and company officials say the hard claystone from which the
landfill is carved makes it a natural location. But siting standards
for hazardous waste landfills are only now being drafted and are not
expected before the end of 1989. DHEC has decided not to wait for
the standards to make a decision on the landfill's permit, and
officials say they can be applied retroactively.
   GSX encases its waste in two layers of clay 3 feet and 5 feet
thick, separated by two hard plastic liners and a leak detection
system. The waste is tested on arrival to ensure that it's not
flammable, radioactive, explosive or laced with dioxin, then it is
mixed with concrete and buried.
   ``GSX is doing a good job in doing what they're doing. I think
they're handling it in a safe manner,'' said Gov. Carroll Campbell.
   Some area opponents, however, say constantly changing burial
requirements have made them unwilling participants in a test of
developing technology.
   When federal regulations changed in 1985 from one layer of clay
and plastic to two, earlier burial cells were not retrofitted. And a
monitoring system crucial for detecting leaks has been upgraded from
eight to about 50 wells since 1983.
   ``As technology progresses, we adopt it,'' said GSX Vice
President Roger Davis. ``Certainly nobody's claiming perfection, but
we just do the best we know how to do.''
   Hallman, a Republican who calls South Carolina ``the septic tank
of the nation,'' has organized a bipartisan environmental caucus of
18 state House and Senate members he hopes will push legislation
endorsed by the DHEC board phasing out permanent burial of chemical
waste by 1992 and creating a state-owned disposal site so South
Carolina could refuse out-of-state waste.
   Court rulings have said that prohibitions on out-of-state waste
headed to a private facility interfere with interstate commerce.
   The DHEC board also called for burial fee increases from $13 to
$95 per ton for in-state waste and $18 to $180 per ton for
out-of-state waste. The money would go into an existing state fund
to be used for any cleanup at the site.
   A 1985 DHEC study estimated that cleanup costs would approach $1
billion if all of the landfill's holding cells were breached. The
state requires only $6 million in insurance, though GSX maintains a
$30 million policy.
   House members rank the DHEC proposals second behind the
politically charged issue of auto insurance reform among the biggest
issues facing them this year.
   The proposals will be challenged by manufacturers _ including the
state's biggest industry, textiles _ who use the GSX site
extensively. They say such moves could increase costs and mean the
loss of jobs.
   The South Carolina Textile Manufacturers Association voted in
December to fight. ``Closing of the facility would create more
problems than it would solve and could lead to improper disposal of
hazardous waste in other locations,'' said E. Blair Rice, chairman
of the group's environmental committee.
   A November public hearing on the GSX permit drew a rowdy crowd of
2,000 people, many of whom stayed seven hours to berate DHEC and GSX.
   Carol Boykin, who first opposed the landfill and helped organize
Citizens Asking for a Safe Environment after a 1984 hearing, says it
has mobilized her as she expects SRP and the other environmental
dilemmas to affect others.
   ``We grew up truly believing that government would protect us,''
she said. ``I think we've come to realize that our state and federal
government are not necessarily going to protect us. We're going to
have to protect ourselves.''

<HEAD>Palestinian Uprising Affects Israeli Artists</HEAD>

   The long Palestinian uprising has brought
bitterness to Israeli humor, and the comedian's opener was not meant
to put his audience at ease.
   ``Soldiers in uniform get in with a discount,'' Yonathan Geffen
said, and after a pause: ``Soldiers with clubs get in free.''
   He referred to beatings by soldiers of protesters in the occupied
West Bank and Gaza Strip, where more than 300 Palestinians have been
killed and thousands wounded. Such a joke would have been
unthinkable before the rebellion began Dec. 8, 1987.
   In night clubs, theaters and galleries, artists of various kinds
grapple with questions about the violence of occupation and the
brutalizing effect on Israeli society of the army's handling of the
uprising.
   A satire by nightclub performer Dudu Topaz takes the form of an
army radio report of an incident said to have begun when a young
Palestinian urinated on a soldier's leg.
   The army arrests his entire family and destroys their house, and
an officer declares on the radio: ``The youth was known as a
potential terrorist.''
   A reporter finds the perpetrator, but discovers he is not yet old
enough to talk.
   Performing artists have collided with those who control state-run
radio and television. Topaz was barred from a radio talk show for
two weeks for comments critical of the army.
   Israel television rejected a skit by comedian Tuvia Tzafir that
attacked public apathy by depicting an Israeli family watching TV
while a fire raged outside.
   Lyrics in ``Coexistence With Love,'' a new album by vocalist
Astar Shamir, accuse the government of failing to explore options
for peace while young soldiers do the dirty work of occupation.
   As one of her songs, ``A Moment Before the Storm,'' puts it: ``My
brother isn't a cruel soldier, but he's cold in his soul. He stands
there with his hand on the trigger, but he hates the war. ... Don't
send my brother to the trigger.''
   Ms. Shamir said in an interview: ``When I sat opposite the
television last January, and they started showing me what was
happening, I couldn't sleep nights. I know songs don't change things
and can't move armies, but ... they just came pouring out.''
   Early last year, army radio banned pop singer Si Hyman's song
``Shooting and Crying'' about soldiers who used a bulldozer to bury
four young Palestinians alive in a West Bank village. The victims
survived, and the soldiers were given jail terms of up to a year.
   ``Have we forgotten our children were killed, too?'' Hyman asks
in the chorus, alluding to the Nazi extermination of 6 million Jews.
   In a Jaffa nightclub, Tzafir performs a skit accusing Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir of ignoring opportunities for peace.
   It depicts Shamir visiting an eye doctor and refusing to read a
wall chart that says, ``There are Palestinians,'' and in smaller
letters, ``There is a chance for peace.''
   ``My vision is too good,'' Shamir says. ``I need something to
block all this out.''
   Palestinians have incorporated themes of the uprising into songs
and plays. Words of a protest song reflect the tendency toward
rhetoric: ``With the Molotov (gasoline bomb), with the stones, I
make my revolution. ... With the stones, we get rid of the enemy.''
   An art exhibit at the Hakawati Theatre in Arab east Jerusalem was
a series of portraits of Palestinians killed in the rebellion. The
new play ``Waiting for the Savior'' depicts buffoon-like Israeli
soldiers harassing Palestinians going about their daily lives.
   ``Everything is political,'' said Jamal Ghosheh, director of the
theatre. ``We are talking about our lives. Our lives are political.''
   For Israeli performers, who do active and reserve army duty like
everyone else, it is more complicated.
   At one point in his show, Topaz stopped and said, ``I wonder if I
have the right to do this. I'm laughing at everyone, but I'm
laughing at myself as well, because I, too, am a soldier.''
   The comedian, whose father came here from the Soviet Union, said
in an interview: ``This is not the country I wanted. It's not the
kind of behavior I want. If someone had told my father he was coming
to live in a country that would rule another nation, he never would
have come.''

   Police arrested 10 people and confiscated
$10 million in counterfeit U.S. currency, an Italian news agency
reported.
   The bills were reportedly distributed through central Italy after
being manufactured in Rome, where police seized a printing press.
   Officials in Perugia in Umbria province said five people were
arrested there Tuesday night after police stopped their car and
found $1 million in bogus bills in the trunk.
   The ANSA news agency said the operation involved police in Umbria
and Lazio provinces in central Italy and Campania province in the
south, without specifying exact arrest locations.
   Rome is in Lazio province and Naples in Campania.
   Police began investigating after getting reports that an
unusually large number of U.S. dollars was being used to pay for
goods and services in tourist centers.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Reagan Takes High Road in Farewell Speech</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan took the high road in his
farewell address after two recent attempts to blame some of his
administration's most notable failures on congressional meddling or
the Washington establishment.
   ``Tonight isn't for arguments and I'm going to hold my tongue,''
the president said in his televised message Wednesday night.
   Reagan sounded positive notes reminiscent of earlier speeches
throughout his political career _ the pre-eminent position of ``We
the People'' in the American system, the image of America as a
shining ``city upon a hill,'' the importance of paying more
attention to American history.
   There was no mention of the ``iron triangle'' of members of
Congress, the news media and special interest groups who, in a
speech to political appointees in Washington on Dec. 13, Reagan
claimed had prevented his administration from balancing the federal
budget.
   Nor did he argue, as he did in a speech at the University of
Virginia in Charlottesville Dec. 16, that Congress had perpetuated a
dangerous situation in Central America by its ``on-again, off-again
indecisiveness'' on his program of aid to the anti-communist Contra
rebels.
   There was no mention at all of the Contras, the arms sales to
Iran or the enormous trade deficits that during Reagan's tenure have
turned America into the world's biggest debtor nation.
   Instead, Reagan stuck to the simple, patriotic themes that have
served him so well in his political career.
   ``There is a great tradition of warnings in presidential
farewells, and I've got one that's been on my mind for some time,''
the president said.
   The best-known such warnings are George Washington's caution in
1797 against ``entangling alliances'' and Dwight Eisenhower's
message in 1961 about the excessive influence of ``the
military-industrial complex.''
   Reagan did not come up with a similar catchword. Rather, he asked
a question: ``Are we doing a good enough job teaching our children
what America is and what she represents in the long history of the
world?''
   He didn't give an outright answer to that question, but he made
it pretty clear that he thinks things have gone awry.
   ``Younger parents aren't sure that an unambivalent appreciation
of America is the right thing to teach modern children,'' he said.
``And as for those who create the popular culture, well-grounded
patriotism is no longer the style.
   ``We've got to do a better job of getting across that America is
freedom.''
   It was an inspirational message, unlikely to arouse the kind of
criticism that greeted his attacks on Congress or the ``iron
triangle.''
   Instead of blaming Congress on Wednesday for his failures, he
thanked the people for his successes.
   ``I've had my share of victories in the Congress, but what very
few people noticed is that I never won anything you didn't win for
me,'' he said. ``They never saw my troops; they never saw Reagan's
regiments, the American people.''
   He even modestly differed from the phrase so often used to
describe his skills at exactly what he was doing Wednesday night.
   ``I never thought it was my style or the words I used that made a
difference _ it was the content,'' he said. ``I wasn't a great
communicator, but I communicated great things, and they didn't
spring full blown from my brow, they came from the heart of a great
nation.
   ``My friends, we did it.''
   In foreign affairs, he said he wanted ``the new closeness'' with
the Soviet Union to continue but warned that it can do so ``only as
long as they continue to act in a helpful manner.''
   It was a sentimental speech unlikely to go into history with
those by Eisenhower or Washington as they concluded their
presidencies.
   But it was a speech that celebrated what he called ``common
sense'' and encapsulated his relationship to the people in simple
imagery.
   ``One of the things about the presidency is that you're always
somewhat apart,'' he said. ``You spend a lot of time going by too
fast in a car someone else is driving, and seeing the people through
tinted glass _ the parents holding up a child, and the wave you saw
too late and couldn't return. And so many times I wanted to stop,
and reach out from behind the glass, and connect.''
   Whatever else it was, it was vintage Reagan.

<HEAD>Farmers Union Opposes Decoupling Payments</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Farmers Union says it will wage a
lobbying battle in Congress against a proposal to let farmers
collect federal subsidies without regard to the kind of crops they
produce.
   NFU president Leland Swenson said Wednesday that the idea, known
as ``decoupling,'' would be ``devastating for farmers and rural
communities, endanger the environment and destabilize the position
of Third World farmers.''
   Swenson said at a news conference that decoupling would be a
``short-term welfare program'' and will be opposed vigorously by NFU
lobbyists.
   The idea of decoupling has been around for years but has not had
great support on Capitol Hill. One of the early decisions by the
incoming Bush administration will be whether to embrace decoupling
as a way of containing government farm costs.
   Under some versions of decoupling, federal payments targeted to
farmers would gradually be reduced over four or five years and
perhaps then be eliminated altogether as producers are weaned from
federal crop subsidies.
   The NFU's main rival, the American Farm Bureau Federation, at one
time supported decoupling but since has backed off to give it a
closer look.
   One of the biggest advocates is the Heritage Foundation, a
Washington-based conservative think tank, which recently issued a
report saying that one of the first jobs of the Bush administration
should be to cut subsidies and ``get farmers off the dole.''
   Decoupling, the Heritage report said, would allow federal
payments to farmers to be based on a flat rate and targeted to those
most in need. As it has been for more than half a century, payments
now are pegged to specific kinds of crops and levels of production _
the larger the farm, the larger the subsidy.
   Under decoupling, farmers would simply be given a cash payment
and then be free to grow or not grow any crop they choose.
   ``Planting decisions would then be based on market signals _
consumer demand for a product _ rather than on what is required by
Washington,'' the Heritage report said.
   Charles Grizzle, who wrote the Heritage report, said in a
telephone interview that decoupling makes sense as a way of getting
crop programs away from government subsidies and into a
market-oriented economic environment.
   ``In my judgment, it's a charade now to think that most of the
production that is linked to subsidy payments is being grown for the
marketplace,'' Grizzle said. ``It's a mindset, almost like a
crutch.''
   Swenson, however, called decoupling proposals a ``cop-out'' and
released a report analyzing a decoupling bill introduced by Sen.
Rudy Boschwitz, R-Minn., in 1985 as the Family Farm Protection and
Full Production Act. Swenson said the bill continues to have some
support in Congress, along with backing from big grain companies
such as Cargill Inc.
   ``It's really a cop-out in addressing the real issue of adopting
and implementing a farm program which enhances the market price for
agricultural commodities,'' Swenson said. ``It implies that the
family farm structure of agriculture is not important.''
   The analysis used figures attributed to the Institute for Trade
and Agriculture of St. Paul, Minn., showing that the Boschwitz bill
would reduce federal price support loans sharply for major crops,
including wheat to $1.60 per bushel from $2.06 this year, and corn
to $1.30 per bushel from the 1989 rate of $1.65.
   ``Lowering of world prices, a result of decoupling, would
aggravate the situation of Third World farmers, who are our best
potential customers for U.S. food exports,'' Swenson said.
   The NFU, he said, will draft its own alternative to decoupling to
``assure consumers an adequate and dependable supply of food'' and
``enhance the market price of agricultural commodities.''
   Although Swenson did not disclose details of what NFU's plan
might include, he said it would ``reduce the budget impact of farm
programs'' and allow for continued expansion of agricultural exports.
   The 1988 drought helped siphon off huge stockpiles of U.S. grain,
boosting market prices for wheat to an average of $3.89 per bushel
last month from $2.70 a year earlier. Corn in December, according to
the Agriculture Department, averaged $2.54 per bushel, compared with
the year-earlier mark of $1.72 per bushel.
   Swenson was asked if the NFU would recommend an increase in
federal price supports to as much as current market prices. He
replied, ``Or higher.''
   The Reagan administration for eight years has been committed to a
market-oriented farm policy, less reliance on federal controls and
freer world trade. Those goals are expected to continue under the
Bush administration.
   But Swenson is not convinced at this time that foreign countries
will go along with current U.S. agricultural trade objectives in the
Bush administration any more than they have in the Reagan years.
   ``There isn't such a thing as a free market,'' Swenson said. ``It
doesn't exist, will not exist, either in this country or any other
major exporting country in the world.''

to protest the bloody arrest of their union bosses on weapons and
corruption charges.
   The government continued its crackdown on Joaquin Hernandez
Galicia, leader of the powerful Oil Workers Union. He and about 50
associates have been arrested on fraud, weapons and tax evasion
charges, said a spokesman for the attorney general's office,
Fernando Arias Perez.
   Meanwhile, authorities said two of Hernandez Galicia's bodyguards
_ who were arrested in the sweep _ reported that their boss ordered
the 1983 slaying of a mayor who headed a union local, officials said.
   The attorney general's office said in a statement late Wednesday
that Hernandez Galicia told investigators he purchased scores of
weapons in the United States.
   Hernandez Galicia told investigators the weapons were brought
into Mexico by his ``good friend,'' Jose Cruz Contreras, a former
mayor of Reynosa, the statement said. Cruz Contreras gave the
weapons to Hernandez Galicia on Dec. 10, it said.
   Reynosa, which has a refinery and petrochemicals plant, lies
across the U.S. border from McAllen, Texas. It is a stronghold of
oil workers allied with Hernandez Galicia.
   Strikes by refinery workers broke out Tuesday night after the
arrests began. The union corruption investigation is widely seen as
a challenge to the union by the new administration of President
Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
   Guards were posted at gas stations and refineries and many
motorists, fearing shortages, formed 30- and 40-car lines to fill up
their tanks at stations in Mexico City, Tampico and other cities.
   But petroleum workers began showing up at their jobs later
Wednesday after a union official called for the strikes to end.
   ``They (workers) should report for work. They should forget
marches, work stoppages and rallies because, despite the protest of
the union of the arbitrary arrest of its leaders, we do not want to
affect the industry or the population,'' Victor de Leon, acting
coordinator of the union.
   He said the message was from Salvador Barragan Camacho, the union
secretary-general, who was under arrest at a cardiology hospital on
Wednesday. Barragan reportedly checked into the hospital after the
arrests began.
   Vania Munoz, a spokeswoman for the state-owned oil monoply Pemex,
said production of crude oil and petrochemicals has returned to
normal.
   ``We are all going back to work to show that we do not have any
problem with the company,'' said Daniel Hernandez Trevino, 23, a
worker at the Ciudad Madero refinery in Hernandez Galicia's
hometown, 220 miles northeast of Mexico City on the Gulf of Mexico.
   It was not known how many workers struck Tuesday and how many
returned. Some refineries were harder hit than others.
   About 4,200 of the 6,000 workers had failed to report for early
shifts Wednesday at the Petroleos Mexicanos refinery in Ciudad
Madero, said Carlos Acevedo Cadena, a Petroleos Mexicanos spokesman.
He said production was reduced to ``less than half'' of his
company's daily capacity of 185,000 barrels of gasoline.
   But operations were reported back to normal at the Azcapotzalco
refinery in Mexico City.
   Hernandez Galicia was arrested Tuesday when soldiers blew down
his door with a bazooka rocket in a raid on his home in northeastern
Ciudad Madero city, the Notimex state news agency said.
   One federal agent was killed in the ensuing shootout with
Hernandez Galicia's bodyguards, said Attorney General Enrique
Alvarez del Castillo. He denied the arrest was an attack on the
union, saying: ``It is the prosecution of crime committed by
individuals.''
   Police confiscated 200 Uzi machine guns at the house, Alvarez
said. Numerous weapons also were found at Barragan Camacho's home.
   Two bodyguards of Hernandez Galicia told authorities Wednesday
that he ordered them to take part in the 1983 killing of Oscar
Torres Pancardo, a union local leader and mayor of Poza Rica in
Veracruz state, where an oil refinery is located, a source at the
attorney general's office said on condition of anonymity.
   Hernandez Galicia has had a long-running feud with Salinas, who
took office Dec. 1, and Mario Ramon Beteta, who headed Pemex until
about a year ago when he left to become governor of the state of
Mexico.
   Salinas, then budget and planning secretary, and Beteta had cut
into the lucrative business Hernandez Galicia and the union had
enjoyed through the control of millions of dollars in Pemex
subcontracts.
   Mexico is the world's sixth-largest crude oil producer.
Production from the country's nine refineries is 1.4 million barrels
a day.

<HEAD>Architect of Nixon Privilege Claim Considered for Top Job</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Texas professor who helped mount President
Nixon's unsuccessful attempt to resist a key Watergate subpoena is
being considered for the post of U.S. solicitor general.
   Charles Alan Wright, 61, a civil law expert and scholar who
helped formulate the executive-privilege claim for refusing to
surrender tapes of Oval Office conversations during the Watergate
affair, is one of five or six candidates under consideration for the
job, said a source close to the selection process.
   Also being considered are Judge Ralph K. Winter of the 2nd U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals in New York City and Judge Kenneth Starr of
the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, said
the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   They are among the candidates being considered by President-elect
Bush's transition team in conjunction with Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh.
   Justice Department sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said the appointment, which must be confirmed by the Senate, would
not be made without Thornburgh's consent.
   The job of the department's top legal policy maker and chief
appellate lawyer will be vacated when Solicitor General Charles
Fried leaves office Jan. 20 to return to Harvard University Law
School.
   The solicitor general decides whether the government will appeal
lower court rulings against federal agencies in virtually all cases.
He personally argues many cases before the high court.
   The solicitor general is called the 10th justice in legal circles
because he is traditionally viewed by the high court as a source of
legal guidance.
   Wright, a University of Texas law professor, served as one of
Nixon's lawyers in 1973 and 1974 while the Watergate special
prosecutor was trying to subpoena the White House tapes.
   He helped devise the constitutional argument that as president,
Nixon was immune from judicial subpoena because of executive
privilege
   The Supreme Court ruled 8-0 in 1974 that executive privilege did
not protect Nixon from having to surrender evidence needed in a
criminal case. The decision led to Nixon's resignation.
   The high court ordered Nixon to turn over the tapes, which
contained damaging evidence of White House involvement in the
Watergate cover-up.
   Winter, 53, a former Yale University law professor who took the
bench in 1982, and Starr, a fellow appointee of President Reagan,
are both known as judicial conservatives.
   Starr, who served as counselor to Attorney General William French
Smith from 1981 prior to taking the bench in 1983, had been
mentioned as a possible Supreme Court nominee after his former
colleague on the District of Columbia circuit, Robert Bork, failed
to win Senate confirmation in 1987.
   There is speculation in the Washington legal community that
because of his relative youth, the 42-year-old Starr would be
willing to give up his lifetime judicial appointment to better
position himself for a future nomination to the Supreme Court.
   Starr is an unpredictable conservative, who has not always voted
with the Reagan administration on major cases before the appeals
court here.
   He is viewed by some as a more moderate member of the
conservative wing of the circuit, which also includes Judges James
L. Buckley, Douglas H. Ginsburg, Laurence Silberman, David Sentelle
and Stephen Williams.
   While best known for his role as a defender of executive
privilege during Watergate, Wright has a formidable reputation as a
legal scholar, particularly as an expert on federal court procedure.
   He is the coauthor of a multi-volume standard textbook on the
subject and has argued before the Supreme Court, notably against the
abolition of the death penalty and against lowering the voting age
to 18. He lost both of those cases.
   His position on the death penalty, however, was ultimately
vindicated when the Supreme Court later reinstated capital
punishment.
   A professed conservative Republican, Wright wrote in 1960 that he
supported Nixon's presidential candidacy because: ``I have more
confidence in Dick Nixon the man than in Jack Kennedy the man.''
   But four years later, Wright said he would vote against Barry
Goldwater because he felt the Arizona senator supported a ``slowdown
on civil rights'' and would take a ``harder, more dangerous line on
foreign relations.''

<HEAD>Dairy Worker Receives $160,000 From Father He Never Saw</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   STOCKTON-ON-TEES, England (AP) _ Michael Minns received $160,000
from the father he never knew and thought was killed in World War II.
   Minns, 44, said Wednesday that he grew up believing his soldier
father, James Minns, died in the war, and was astonished when
lawyers tracked him down and told him that for 40 years his father
was in a hospital 50 miles away.
   Minns, a dairy worker and father of four, said he then discovered
his father had not had a visitor in the hospital for 38 years.
   ``I'm heartbroken,'' he said. ``It would have meant a lot to meet
him.''
   Minns, offspring of a wartime romance, was born illegitimate. He
was brought up by his aunt, who died when he was 15.
   He said he only learned his father was a war-stress patient at
St. Nicholas Hospital in Gosforth in northeast England after he died
two years ago.
   ``The news was a considerable shock,'' he said. ``I feel bitter
because certain relatives knew about him and kept it to themselves.''
   ``The money isn't important. If it had been 90 million pounds
($160 million) it wouldn't make up for the fact I've been robbed of
my father.''

<TEXT>
   The AFL-CIO is supporting longtime Democratic
Party activist Ronald H. Brown's bid to be the next party chairman,
giving the Washington attorney labor's influential backing in the
five-man race.
   The AFL-CIO announced the endorsement Wednesday following a
90-minute meeting of president Lane Kirkland and 16 other members of
its national political committee.
   The endorsement was announced in a two-sentence statement that
said Brown was the ``consensus'' choice of those at the meeting.
   It did not list any reason for the endorsement or refer to public
endorsements of another candidate, former Rep. James V. Stanton of
Ohio, by building-trades unions affiliated with AFL-CIO.
   Of the 404 votes on the DNC, 46 are cast by union
representatives. But labor's influence is considered far greater
than those numbers suggest. All five candidates to succeed Paul G.
Kirk Jr. met with AFL-CIO leaders last week in hopes of securing the
endorsement.
   ``This endorsement represents a vote of confidence by the
representatives of the working men and women of this country,''
Brown said in a statement.
   Brown and Richard Weiner, the Michigan state party chairman, are
viewed as the front-runners to replace Kirk. Brown has the support
of many national Democrats, but few if any of them vote. Weiner's
base stems from his role as president of the Assocation of State
Party Chairs.
   The other candidates are former congressmen Jim Jones of Oklahoma
and Michael Barnes of Maryland. All five last week began a series of
joint regional meetings around the country. The DNC will pick a
successor to Kirk next month.
   Brown is a veteran party insider who advised the unsuccessful
presidential campaign of Jesse Jackson.
   Critics of Brown's candidacy argue that his election would
suggest that the party is lining up behind Jackson's liberal stands.
Among such critics is Jones, a moderate who said Wednesday evening
that his ``campaign continues to move forward'' despite the labor
endorsement of Brown.

<BYLINE>Reports U.S. Withheld Documents To Protect Latin American Contacts</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   To avoid identifying several Latin American
government officials as working for the Central Intelligence Agency,
the Reagan administration withheld certain documents from the trial
of Lt. Col. Oliver North, The Miami Herald reported today.
   Quoting unidentified sources close to the Iran-Contra inquiry,
the newspaper says the administration feared that any discussion of
the documents in court might disrupt U.S. intelligence in several
countries.
   One source said some of the withheld documents were declassified
during congressional investigations of the Iran-Contra affair, but
were later reclassified in an effort to limit discussion of the
incidents they describe, the Herald said.
   Special prosecutor Lawrence Walsh asked that the two major
charges against North be dismissed after the Reagan administration
refused to allow certain documents to be used in North's trial. U.S.
District Judge Gerhard Gesell is expected to act on Walsh's request
this week.
   The newspaper said some of its sources are closely tied to
North's defense team while others either worked closely with North
in the past or participated in the 1987 congressional investigation
into the Iran-Contra affair.
   One of the sources is a senior administration official who
advises the State Department and the White House on Central American
security policy, the newspaper said.
   Countries listed in the documents, the sources said, include
Costa Rica, El Salvador, and Venezuela where _ respectively _
North's resupply network aiding the Nicaraguan Contra rebels built
an airstrip, controlled part of an air base and attempted to buy
military aircraft.
   North's activities in these countries were central to Walsh's
legal strategy to show that the former National Security Council
aide conspired to defraud the United States and steal government
property by using the profits from arms sales to Iran to purchase
supplies for the Contras.
   Those are the charges Walsh says he must withdraw.
   In each case, the sources said, Walsh has documentary evidence,
including invoices, receipts and other legal papers, showing
transactions involving Iran arms sales profits and Contra supplies.

   Angolan rebel leader Jonas Savimbi has
President-elect George Bush's assurance of continued U.S. support
until the Angolan government reaches a settlement with him,
according to a published report today.
   The Washington Post reported that the assurance was contained in
a Jan. 6 letter from Bush.
   The vice president also said the incoming Bush administration
will push other governments to work for an agreement between Angola
and Savimbi's UNITA movement, according to the newspaper.
   In the letter, Bush promised to ``continue all appropriate and
effective assistance to UNITA'' until Savimbi's political goals are
reached.
   That means covert military aid, which has cost about $15 million
annually for the past two years, the newspaper said, quoting an
unidentified Bush aide.
   On Dec. 22, Angola, South Africa and Cuba signed an agreement
providing for the phased withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola,
along with the independence of Namibia, the neighboring territory
which is administered by South Africa.
   The United States has no formal ties with the government of
Angola, partly because of the presence of the 50,000 Cuban troops.

<HEAD>Book Reveals Moscow Reversed Order to Run Blockade</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An enraged Nikita Khrushchev instructed Soviet
ships to ignore President Kennedy's naval blockade during the Cuban
missile crisis, but the order was reversed just hours before an
inevitable confrontation, according to a new book.
   James G. Blight and David A. Welch of Harvard University's John
F. Kennedy School of Government say that ``if this order had held,
war between the superpowers would probably have commenced at sea,
shortly after 10 o'clock on Wednesday morning, Oct. 24, 1962,
several hundred miles off the coast of Cuba.''
   Anastas Mikoyan, then Soviet first deputy premier, was the
catalyst for the reversal of Khrushchev's order, according to the
authors. Mikoyan ``preempted Khrushchev's order to run the blockade
and ordered Soviet ships to stop just short of the quarantine
line,'' they say.
   But Blight and Welch said at a news conference Wednesday that it
remains unclear whether Mikoyan reversed or circumvented the
decision on his own or convinced Khrushchev of its perils. Welch
said the order was reversed just hours before Soviet ships reached
U.S. forces.
   The book, ``On the Brink: Americans and Soviets Reexamine the
Cuban Missile Crisis,'' is based largely on two 1987 conferences
sponsored by Harvard _ one that featured top Kennedy advisers and
U.S. scholars and a second in which three Soviets joined the
Americans.
   The book will serve as a backdrop for a third conference
scheduled for Jan. 27-29 in Moscow featuring, for the first time,
Soviet, American and Cuban officials who participated in the crisis,
which was triggered when Soviet troops began installing missiles in
Cuba capable of reaching the United States.
   Secret correspondence between Kennedy and Khrushchev concerning
the missile crisis is expected to be released at the conference,
according to Harvard officials.
   The book said Khrushchev's order to ignore the blockade was
disclosed in a largely unknown work by dissident Soviet historian
Roy Medvedev. The Harvard authors said much of the information has
been confirmed independently by Mikoyan's son, Sergo, who was an
aide to his father during the crisis.
   The authors also conclude that the missiles in Cuba probably did
not have warheads. Their theory that the warheads were blocked by
the quarantine is at odds with a recent disclosure by Aleksander
Alekseev, the former ambassador to Cuba, who said in a recent Soviet
magazine that 42 medium-range missiles were fully operational.
   But the authors suggested that Alekseev, along with others in the
Soviet diplomatic corps, were not receiving accurate information
from Moscow about the missiles.

   It was not the type of ceremonial
presentation that a governor makes every day, but it wasn't in
recognition of the kind of senatorial circumstance that arises every
day, either.
   Gov. Kay Orr made a special trip from her second-floor office
Wednesday to call Sen. Jim McFarland from an Education Committee and
present him with a can opener, bedecked with a big ribbon, ``in case
you ever find yourself locked in the can again.''
   McFarland somehow managed to break a dead-bolt lock on the door
of a small bathroom on the Capitol's eighth floor last week. He was
there for nearly an hour before maintenance workers got clearance to
take the door apart and let him out.
   ``I heard that you had had some difficulty and thought this might
be of some value to you if this unfortunate type of thing happens
again,'' Mrs. Orr said.
   ``Governor, I accept this in the spirit in which it is given and,
believe me, I won't leave home without it,'' McFarland said.

   Skiers and operators of fashionable resorts
in the Alps and Dolomites are facing a severe dry spell that has
left northern Italy snowless and caused sharp losses to the
multimillion-dollar ski industry.
   But in the long term, the dryness may be most damaging to farmers
in the plains. Their national association claimed this week that
this year's harvests of wheat and barley are being jeopardized by
the lack of moisture.
   It also said an expected lowering in river levels may hurt rice
farming in the Po valley this spring.
   ``If it does not snow, and a lot, within this month we will have
no water to submerge 150,000 hectares (370,500 acres) of rice,''
said Bruno Pusterla, a top official of the Italian Agricultural
Confederation. ``In the meantime drought is already causing damage
to seedlings.''
   The latest snowfall on the Italian side of the Alps date back to
early December, when an average of eight inches of fresh snow elated
owners of hotels and ski lifts. Not a single drop of rain or a flake
of snow has since been spotted in northern Italy.
   Dozens of tourists upset by the lack of snow and poor
accommodations protested in Salice d'Ulzio, near the French border,
forcing local authorities to negotiate repayment of a share of their
pre-paid vacations.
   Unusually high temperatures prevented the use of snowmakers,
considered a good defense in case of late winter snowfalls in
resorts such as Sestriere, Courmayeur, Bormio, Madonna di Campiglio
and Selva Val Gardena. Resorts had spent several million dollars to
install batteries of snow-making equipment on Alpine slopes.
   Snow bulletins issued weekly by tourist offices list an
increasing number of closed ski lifts and cable cars. The highest
Alpine ski tracks _ above 6,000 feet _ report no more than 12 to 16
inches.
   The few resorts with favorable ski conditions because of their
shady positions were invaded by thousands of Chrismas holiday skiers
_ quickly spoiling their slopes.
   The unusual high pressure over northern Italy also touched off
several consecutive days of thick fog in the plains, which closed
airports, hampered road traffic and caused pile-ups on highways.
   ``We can only hope that snow comes soon and plentifully, to
salvage a tourist season already compromised,'' says Caterina
Prossliner, who runs a luxury hotel in Val Badia, near the Austrian
border.
   Some international cross-country races scheduled in northern
Italy in mid-January were canceled for lack of snow while World Cup
races early in December were held with some difficulty on artificial
snow.
   Several of the early races of the competition France, Austria and
Switzerland were rescheduled last month. However, the three
neighboring Alpine countries have had some recent snowfalls of 14 to
40 inches.
   Some members of the environmentalist Green Party claim a steady
rise in winter temperatures and the frequent dry spells are the
result of the ``greenhouse effect'', or climactic warming, resulting
from humankind's burning of fossil fuels.
   However, Franca Chlistovsky, who heads the Brera metereologic
institute in Milan, said this winter's dry spell was not exceptional
and several worse years have been registered since 1950.
   ``People have a slippery memory. Certainly winter has begun later
than usual in some recent years, but it lasted longer,'' she
explained.

   ``Desire Under the Elms,'' a new opera based on
Eugene O'Neill's play of the same name, is blessed with a story
perfect for opera _ full of rivalry, greed, sex and violence.
   Soprano Judy Kaye, who won a Tony on Broadway last year, stars in
the New York Opera Repertory Theater production, and is splendid in
the pivotal role of Abbie. But the music composed by Edward Thomas
doesn't have all the power it needs.
   The opera had its first staged presentation Wednesday at the City
Center.
   Operas these days are melodic, minimalist or have a jagged vocal
line that doesn't sound like a melody to most listeners. ``Desire
Under the Elms'' is of the latter kind.
   That's fine and this opera sounds good much of the time. But in
arias expressing emotion for instance, it often sounds bland.
   A lullaby is a departure from the rest of the music. But when a
very dramatic moment comes, that music should also be a departure,
hitting some heights. In ``Desire Under the Elms,'' the drama is
principally carried by the situation and the words being sung.
   Abbie marries elderly Ephraim Cabot (bass Nicholas Solomon),
seduces his son Eben (tenor James Schwisow) and has a baby. Abbie,
Ephraim and Eben each want total ownership of the farm on which they
live. So the stew of sex, love and deception is further stirred by
mistrust of love based on what any one might do to get the farm.
   The orchestral scoring isn't heavy so most of the words could be
understood. The men's voices were good but not big, an appraisal
which extends to Robert Paul Heimann and William Livingston, as two
older sons who leave home before Abbie arrives. Miss Kaye's voice
most nearly filled the house.
   The New York Opera Repertory Theater was founded in 1977 by Leigh
Gibbs Gore, who conducted the opera. It is dedicated to creation and
performance of opera and new music theater.
   Composer Thomas is a native of Chisholm, Minn. Joe Masteroff, who
wrote the book for Broadway's ``She Loves Me'' and ``Cabaret,'' is
making his debut as a librettist.
   ``Desire Under the Elms'' was done in a workshop at the O'Neill
Theater Center's National Music Theater Conference, in its first
year, 1978. It also has had concert performances. The set for this
first staged presentation was a cutaway two-story house by Michael
Anania. Gregg Barnes designed costumes and David Gately directed.
   It will be performed again on Friday and Sunday.

   An undercover police officer took a paddling while
posing as a high school student so he wouldn't miss an opportunity
to make a drug buy, officials said.
   The 25-year-old officer, whose identity is being kept secret, ran
afoul of school law when he was late for classes, said Gene Ward,
principal of W.T. White High School.
   Given the choice of after-school detention and missing a
scheduled drug buy or corporal punishment, the officer submitted to
the spanking, Ward said. An assistant principal administered the
paddling before school officials found out the ``student's'' real
identity, Ward said.
   The drug investigation at W.T. White High resulted 16 arrests,
said police narcotics Lt. Robert Owens.

<TEXT>
   The Department of Housing and Urban
Development's latest list of property identified as suitable for the
homeless includes national parkland, a naval submarine base and a
lock and dam site.
   Those sites are included in a list of 38 pieces of federal
property identified by HUD on Wednesday as suitable for the homeless.
   In announcing the decision, HUD said the new list of 17 buildings
and 21 land sites was being submitted to the General Services
Administration and the Department of Health and Human Services.
   GSA and HHS will oversee a process in which states, local
government units and private non-profit organizations may submit
applications to use the facilities for the homeless.
   Wednesday's action brings to 148 the number of federal properties
_ 65 buildings and 83 land sites _ judged suitable for aiding the
homeless.
   HUD is also reviewing for suitability more than 1,600 unused or
underutilized properties owned by federal landholding agencies. The
department is due to complete this review no later than the end of
February.
   Wednesday's action was taken to meet a deadline set on Dec. 14 by
U.S. District Court Judge Oliver Gasch.
   In Wednesday's announcement, locations containing unused or
underutilized federally owned buildings deemed suitable for homeless
facilities were listed as:
   Clear Air Force Station, Alaska; Hot Springs National Park, Ark.;
Carbondale Mining Technology Center, Carterville, Ill.; GSA Depot,
Watertown, Mass.; Fort Snelling, Minn.; Army Reserve Center,
Springfield, Mo.; Magdalena, N.M.; Tonopah, Nev.; Fire Island
National Seashore, Patchogue, N.Y.; Hammond, Ore.; Aguadilla, Puerto
Rico; GSA Depot, Davisville, R.I.; and Mineral Wells, Texas.
   Locations containing suitable federally owned land were listed as:
   Fort Wainwright annex, Fairbanks, Alaska; Andrews Lock and Dam,
Henry County, Ala.; U.S. Coast Guard Training Center, Petaluma,
Calif.; San Gabriel River Channel, Azusa, Calif.; Denver, Colo.;
Gainesville, Ga.; Andrews Lock and Dam, Early County, Ga.; Kings
Bay, Ga.; Homewood, Ill.; Baton Rouge, La.; Sudbury-Hudson, Mass.;
Andrews Air Force Base, Md.; Camp Butner, N.C.; Gallup Indian
Center, N.M.; Fort Hamilton, Brooklyn, N.Y.; Sandusky, Ohio; Jackson
County, Okla.; Lebanon, Pa.; Amarillo, Texas; and Bardane, W.Va.
   Some locations included more than one piece of property.

   Billionaire entrepreneur Donald Trump
says he can't understand what cartoonist Garry Trudeau is getting at
when he depicts Trump in comic strips.
   ``You know, I did well in school, but for the life of me, I still
can't understand what `Doonesbury' is all about,'' Trump said.
   A recent ``Doonesbury'' shows Trump tossing casino chips from the
deck of the Trump Princess, his luxury yacht, to people on small

   ``They say Trudeau is somewhat clever,'' Trump said in an
interview this week. ``But I'd venture to say that most people are
like me. They don't comprehend what Trudeau's trying to achieve with
`Doonesbury,' either.''
   Trump had kinder words for Trudeau's wife, NBC-TV ``Today'' show
co-anchor Jane Pauley. ``Personally, I think his wife has a lot more
talent than he does,'' Trump said. ``She's interviewed me on the
`Today' show a couple of times and she was very nice,'' Trump said.

and of autism.
   Hoffman, who portrays an autistic savant in the movie, returned
the favor and called the Fresno boy Monday, talking with Brent and
his family for 20 minutes.
   Autism affects brain chemistry and disrupts communication.
   Until Brent saw the film, he hated his autism and refused to even
say the word, according to his mother, Cathy Aden.
   Mrs. Aden said her son ``laughed in all the right places'' and
``blossomed'' after seeing the film.
   Brent's letter to Hoffman said in part: ``I feel good now. People
say autism is OK. I'm free now. This is good, Rain Man.''

   Chancellor Helmut Kohl says he no
longer can rule out the possibility charges may be brought against
West Germany companies reported to have helped Libya build a
suspected chemical weapons factory.
   West German officials have for weeks denied discovering any
evidence supporting U.S. charges that West German firms helped build
the plant in Rabta, 40 miles south of Tripoli.
   But several West German news reports on Wednesday said West
Germany companies played a major role in supplying equipment for and
assisting in the construction of the plant, which Libyan leader Col.
Moammar Gadhafi contends is not a chemical weapons but a
pharmaceutical plant.
   Kohl told a news conference that a team of West German experts
left for Washington Wednesday to discuss the U.S. allegations in
more detail.
   Asked about the new accusations that West German companies were
involved in the Rabta plant, he said: ``All evidence will be
investigated thoroughly. I cannot exclude that there may be some
evidence that could stand up in court.''
   But the West German leader emphasized that his government must
have such evidence ``before action is taken.
   ``The government cannot ground its action on speculation,'' Kohl
said.
   Federal officials already have confirmed that a criminal
investigation has begun against a now-defunct Frankfurt firm, I.B.I.
Engineering, and that investigators had seized company documents.
   But they told The Associated Press that no proof had been yet
found that West German companies were involved in the Libyan plant.
   However, in its evening news report Wednesday, the ARD television
network showed what it said were documents seized by customs
officials that allegedly show transactions between the
Imhausen-Chemie company and Libya.
   The names of I.B.I. and Imhausen could be read on some of the
documents, but the exact nature of the papers was not clear.
   Stern magazine reported in today's editions that I.B.I. was
deeply involved in the Libyan plant along with Imhausen-Chemie of
Lahr and the Hamburg-based Pen Tsao medical material company.
   Imhausen-Chemie and Pen Tsao were cleared in an initial audit
last week.
   All three companies have been named by U.S. officials in their
accusations _delivered privately to Bonn authorities _ that West
German firms aided Libya in building the plant.
   A Finance Ministry official who spoke on condition of anonymity
confirmed Wednesday that I.B.I. was now under investigation.
   He said the West German Customs Service, which is conducting the
investigation, had seized I.B.I. documents as part of the probe.
   Stern magazine said the documents had been in the possession of
Harry B. Meyer of Frankfurt, which it identified as a tax adviser to
I.B.I. owner Ihsan Barbouti, an Iraqi national.
   ``The investigators are looking into whether I.B.I. shipped goods
to Libya and whether they required an export permit,'' said the
official.
   He said a Belgian transport company, Crosslink of Antwerp, was
being probed by Belgian officials and that Bonn had asked
authorities in the neighboring country to assist in the I.B.I.
investigation.
   Stern said many of I.B.I.'s deliveries were carried out by an
unidentified shipper in Antwerp. It named no sources in its report,
but said the material was based on official documents and
first-person reports.
   The Hamburg-based magazine claimed I.B.I. ``to a large extent
organized the total project in the Libyan desert.''
   Stern said federal authorities have confiscated documents showing
that I.B.I., Imhausen-Chemie and Pen Tsao were involved in the
Libyan project.
   It said Imhausen delivered ``everything that is needed to build a
chemical plant'' to I.B.I.
   The magazine alleged that some of the materials were shipped by
Pen Tsao under bills of lading to Hong Kong, but actually delivered
to Libya.
   Libya claims its new plant will produce pharmaceuticals, not
poison gas or other biological weapons. The United States claims it
has evidence to the contrary, and those claims have been supported
by Canada, The Netherlands and Britain, which says it has
independent confirmation.
   The U.S. preoccupation with the Rabta plant led Gadhafi to accuse
the United States of planning an air strike to knock it out.
   On Jan. 4, two U.S. F-14 jet fighters shot down two Libyan
warplanes over the Mediterranean about 600 miles from the plant.
   Washington claimed the downings were provoked by aggressive and
threatening actions by armed Libyan aircraft, while Libya said its
jets were unarmed and on a reconaissance flight over international
waters.

   An astronomer who spotted a strange circle on a
satellite photo of Czechoslovakia believes the object is a
200-mile-wide crater that's too big to identify on Earth.
   Boston University's Michael D. Papagiannis said he believes the
crater was created 100 million years ago when a 50-mile-wide
meteorite slammed into the Earth.
   ``The impact would be the equivalent of 1 trillion Hiroshima
bombs,'' he said Wednesday at the American Astronomical Society's
annual meeting,
   Papagiannis noticed it on a satellite photo taken, and he has
since seen it on other pictures from space.
   He has named it the Praha Basin, because the city of Praha, or
Prague, is near its center. The crater, if it truly is that, covers
most of western Czechoslovakia. It is roughly bounded by Ostined,
Lesny and Liberec in Czechoslovakia and Gmund in Austria.
   Papagiannis said the purported crater is simply too big to be
noticed by people on Earth.

<TEXT>
   Students who participated in a
school-approved tobacco-spitting contest sought to recapture the
days of the Old West, but they also violated state and local
regulations, officials say.
   Six students at Odessa High School in this west Texas city took
part in the after-school event Tuesday as Vice Principal Vance
Horsley and economics teacher Bill Rutherford cheered from the
sidelines.
   The Texas Education Code and school district policy prohibit use
of tobacco products at school-sponsored events.
   State Schools Superintendent Hugh Hayes said Wednesday he was
disappointed to hear about the contest, and would investigate.
   Principal Raymond Starnes said he would talk to the teacher and
administrator who staged the contest, which was part of Western Week
celebrations.
   Rutherford, who is sponsor for the school Student Council, said
he obtained approval for the contest from Horsley and was aware of
district policy banning tobacco use on school property.
   ``We sat around and tried to think of pastime activities
associated with the Old West,'' Rutherford said. ``We were going to
do the cow patty bingo, but we found out from an attorney that
that's considered gambling, so we didn't do it.''
   ``I just thought it was unusual circumstances and wouldn't hurt
anybody,'' Horsley said. ``I know it's a violation. ... I was wrong,
but I hate to see something big made out of something like that.''
   Starnes said he was aware of the contest, but said Rutherford had
been ``instructed to use Tootsie Rolls. I think (Rutherford) was
trying to use prunes, too, but he had some reservations about that.''

<HEAD>Why Thrifts Fail, And Who Pays To Insure Deposits</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More savings and loans failed in 1988 than in
any year since the Depression. This year, taxpayers may be asked to
pick up the cost of rescuing the industry _ and the price could run
into the billions of dollars.
   Here are answers to some commonly asked questions about the
problem.
   Q: How are depositors' savings protected?
   A: The first line of defense when an institution fails is a
government insurance fund, the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance
Corp. (the FSLIC).
   The ultimate backing, if the fund runs out of money, is the
taxpayer. On several occasions Congress, most recently in 1987, has
reaffirmed that the full faith and credit of the federal government
stands behind the deposits.
   Q: Does that mean the government would pay the depositors if the
S&amp;L went out of business?
   A: Yes, as long as the S&amp;L has federal insurance.
   In most cases the insurance fund tries to avoid direct depositor
payoffs. Instead, the government ``rescues'' the institution by
providing new owners with a mixture of cash, promissory notes and
other guarantees to wipe out the old losses.
   The new owners also invest some of their own money and the
institution stays open, usually under a new name. The old managers
lose their jobs, the stockholders lose their investment but
depositors are protected.
   Q: How does the FSLIC work?
   A: The FSLIC guarantees deposit accounts up to $100,000 in nearly
3,000 S&amp;Ls. (Similarly, government insurance also protects savers in
commercial banks through the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC),
while the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) stands behind
credit unions.)
   Q: Where do the insurance funds get their money?
   A: From the institutions whose deposits they insure. S&amp;Ls, for
instance, pay a premium of 21 cents a year for every $100 in
deposits. The FSLIC also has been raising money by selling 30-year
bonds, which will be paid off by the premiums from the industry.
And, it sells property from failed institutions to recover some of
its costs.
   Q: If S&amp;Ls fund the insurance plan, why do people say the public
will end up paying?
   A: The Reagan administration has recently acknowledged that
income from the industry won't be enough to cover savings accounts
in failed S&amp;Ls and, therefore, the public will have to bear much of
the cost. Industry trade groups say healthy institutions will start
going under if they're forced to pay higher premiums.
   Q: How would the public pay?
   A: This is not clear. The Treasury Department is working on a
plan for President-elect Bush. Private analysts believe that in some
manner tax money will be needed.
   The solution could involve a direct appropriation of taxpayer
funds. Or, Congress could authorize regulators to borrow what they
need with the understanding that taxpayer funds will be used to pay
the interest. Or, Congress could impose fees on members of the
public, such as home buyers, who benefit from the S&amp;L system.
   Q: What is the controversy about the 1988 bailouts?
   Keeping a money-losing institution alive means it could continue
to lose money under new owners, eventually making another rescue
necessary.
   The government protects the new owners from losing money on loans
made by the previous owners. Critics think the new owners ought to
share more of the risk as an incentive to manage the loan portfolio
wisely.
   Also, members of Congress are angry because in some cases private
buyers are reaping tax breaks from the deals that are worth more
than they are paying to take possession of failed institutions. They
say regulators ought to have been able to get more cash from the
buyers in exchange for the tax benefits.
   Q: Why do regulators think the bailout approach will ultimately
save money for the taxpayers?
   A: If the government simply shuts down an institution, it has to
spend enormous amounts immediately to pay off depositors _ more
money than the regulators have. Over a period of years, it then
hopes to get back some of it by selling loans and repossessed
property from the failed S&amp;L.
   By rescuing an institution, the government pays only for the
loss, not for the entire amount of insured deposits. And, it gets to
spread out the cost, typically for as long as 10 years.
   Also, most institutions have a certain value as a going concern _
such as a loyal customer base _ that would be destroyed if they were
liquidated. In 1988, new S&amp;L owners pumped $3 billion into the
rescued institutions in exchange for this value.
   In December, regulators ``resolved'' the cases of 75 S&amp;Ls at an
estimated cost of $15.5 billion to the insurance fund and $4 billion
in tax breaks. The ultimate cost of liquidating those S&amp;Ls would
have been $22.8 billion, however, and the insurance fund would have
had to immediately come up with $47 billion in ``up-front cash.''
   Q: How did we get in this fix in the first place?
   A: Inflation and high interest rates in the 1970s and early 1980s
put most S&amp;Ls in a bind. They were forced to pay more to attract
deposits than they were earning on long-term mortgages already on
their books.
   One of the ``solutions'' was to allow savings and loans to expand
beyond traditional mortgage lending and invest in commercial real
estate and other projects, which earn higher rates of return and
require only a short-term commitment by the S&amp;L.
   The new rules attracted a new class of S&amp;L owner, now called
``high-fliers.'' They were particularly prevalent in states with
more liberal S&amp;L rules such as Texas, California and Florida.
   Unfortunately, the new investments made by high-fliers were
riskier. When the Texas economy collapsed because of plummeting oil
prices, borrowers stopped making payments and much of the commercial
real estate serving as collateral was worth only a fraction of its
previous value.
   At the same time S&amp;Ls were entering unfamiliar territory, the
Reagan administration was cutting back on its force of examiners. It
was only in 1985, when regulators arranged to have the examination
force taken off budget, that S&amp;Ls began to be more closely
supervised.
   In some cases outright fraud contributed to the losses. A Justice
Department-led task force, operating in Texas since 1987, has
obtained indictments and convictions of S&amp;L managers.
   Also, throughout the 1980s, Congress, at the urging of industry
lobby groups, consistently refused to provide regulators with enough
money to shut down all failed institutions. The institutions stayed
open and lost even more money. Congress also directed regulators to
``forbear'' from taking action against S&amp;Ls in economically
distressed areas, such as Texas.

<TEXT>
   Five snowmobilers said they survived nearly
three nights in blizzard conditions by huddling in an aspen grove
and melting snow for water after becoming stranded when they ran out
of gas.
   ``There were a few times I thought I might die out there,'' Steve
Brammer, 30, said Wednesday. ``It was the scaredest I've ever been.''
   Searchers located the men by air Tuesday night after they spotted
the fire and flares set off by the men. Neck-deep snow prevented
rescuers from reaching them until early Wednesday, officials said.
   ``Temperatures didn't get too low, but the wind chill was bad,''
said Bingham County Sheriff's Lt. Bill Gordon. ``But they got into
trees, and that protected them from the wind. They had enough
knowledge of winter survival that they stayed together and stayed
put and waited until the weather cleared so they could shoot up some
flares.''
   Brammer, Wayne Hopkins, 44, Bob Miller, 43, Melvin Manning, 54,
and Jason Manning, whose age wasn't available, apparently went off
the main snowmobile trail Sunday evening while on an outing with
eight others, authorities said. They were stranded about 10 miles
outside this small southeast Idaho town.
   The eight others arrived in Bone on Sunday evening and reported
their friends missing.
   ``We never gave up hope,'' said Brammer's wife, Stacie. ``I know
their attitudes and their skills. They're all pretty experienced and
had a lot of knowledge as far as what to do.''

<HEAD>149 Nations Sign Diluted Anti-Chemical Weapons Declaration</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELAINE GANLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An anti-chemical weapons declaration, intentionally
crafted in diluted form to satisfy its 149 signatory nations, should
help accelerate talks on a ban of toxic arms, officials say.
   But the United States and Soviet Union, the only two countries
that admit they possess chemical arms, said Wednesday that the
document produced by the five-day conference had fallen short of
their expectations.
   The chief U.S. delegate, William F. Burns, said Washington would
have preferred that explicit language be put into the declaration to
include sanctions against users of poison gas, nerve gas and other
toxic chemical arms.
   ``If the United States had written this statement, which we did
not, it might have been stronger. This is a consensus document,''
said Burns, who heads the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency.
   Iran, a victim of poison gas in its eight-year war with Iraq, was
among several states that voiced reservations after the
declaration's unanimous endorsement.
   Iraq's use of chemical weapons against Iran and Iraq's Kurdish
minority _ graphic pictures of peasants killed in Iranian villages
heightened concerns last year _ provided a somber backdrop for the
conference, which was formally proposed by President Reagan at the
United Nations in September.
   Iran succeeded in getting a reference to ``recent violations'' of
the protocol in the declaration. But its delegation said it had
hoped for a categorical condemnation of past use of toxic weapons.
   Host France said the conference would give life to languishing
negotiations in Geneva seeking a verifiable ban on chemical arms.
   The non-binding declaration reaffirms the 1925 Geneva Protocol,
which prohibits the use of chemical weapons, and urges negotiators
in Geneva to ``redouble'' efforts to ban the use, production and
stocking of chemical arms.
   The six-point declaration affirms the U.N. role in investigating
chemical weapons use and called for a strenthening of existing
procedures at the United Nations in dealing with such use _ a
reference to enacting sanctions.
   Signers condemned the use of chemical arms, pledging not to use
them.
   Unanimous approval of the final declaration was ``tantamount to
saying the whole international community has taken a posture''
against chemical weapons, said Foreign Minister Roland Dumas of
France, who presided over the conference.
   ``This unanimity will accelerate ... work underway in Geneva,''
he said.
   But the breadth of the declaration, aimed at appeasing all
parties, allowed for a broad interpretation that clearly reflected
five days of haggling.
   Max Friedersdorf, U.S. arms negotiator in Geneva, said it was
``hard to quantify'' how the declaration could speed up negotiations
toward a convention. ``I think it will have an impact on nations.
It's bound to strengthen world opinion on the convention,''
Friedersdorf said.
   ``Until the end of events recently ... there was very little
notice given to what was going on in Geneva. In fact I think the
whole world thought the dreaded scourge of chemical weapons was gone
forever, since World War I.''
   The United States and other Western nations that have nuclear
arms succeeded in blocking efforts led by Arab states to explicitly
link the banning of chemical and nuclear weapons.
   Arab nations said they wanted to reserve the right to possess
chemical weapons to counter what they claim is a nuclear threat from
Israel.
   However, hours before the conference closed, Iraqi Vice Premier
Tariq Aziz announced that Arab states would concede their demand to
link nuclear and chemical weapons bans in order to get a consensus.
   Forty delegations have been holding talks in Geneva on banning
chemical weapons since the early 1980s, but have been stymied by
ways to verify a ban on chemical and biological weapons, which
include odorless, colorless gases made in plants that can be
camoflaged on short notice and laboratory-made toxins derived from
fungi.
   An estimated 20 nations currently have chemical weapons
capabilities.

<HEAD>Court Reviews Texas Case Of Retarded Killer</HEAD>

   The Supreme Court is examining the legal
significance of imposing capital punishment on a convicted murderer
described as having the mind of a child.
   The justices heard 60 minutes of arguments Wednesday on whether
they will allow the execution of Johnny Paul Penry, 32, a convicted
rapist-murderer sentenced to die in Texas. The court is expected to
announce its decision in July.
   Penry is said to have the mental capacity of a 7-year-old and the
social development of a 9-year-old.
   Assistant Attorney General Charles A. Palmer of Texas argued that
executing Penry would not violate the Constitution's ban against
cruel and inhuman punishment.
   ``He knew what he was doing,'' Palmer said. Penry raped Pamela
Moseley Carpenter on Oct. 15, 1979, in Livingston, Texas, then
stabbed her to death. She was 22.
   Palmer recited evidence that Penry killed the woman to prevent
her from identifying him.
   Ms. Carpenter's brother, retired National Football League
placekicker Mark Moseley, was in the courtroom Wednesday and told
reporters afterward, ``It's been nine years of hell for myself and
my family.''
   He said, ``It's not something anyone should have to go through
and I feel that if anything good can come out of it, that may be we
can render a decision that will make it not happen to someone else.''
   Some justices expressed doubts that describing someone as having
the mental capacity of a child has much relevance.
   ``What does it mean to have the mental age of 9?'' asked Justice
Antonin Scalia.
   Palmer said witnesses for Penry testified he functioned mentally
like a 7-year-old and socially like a 9-year-old.
   ``Beyond that I can not help the court,'' Palmer said.
   ``If it's something we don't understand, why allow (such
evidence) to be introduced?'' asked Justice Anthony M. Kennedy.
   Curtis C. Mason, a lawyer representing Penry, spent little time
arguing that all retarded murderers should be spared. Instead, Mason
challenged the Texas death penalty law on narrower grounds.
   Mason said the law prevented the jury from giving full
consideration to evidence in Penry's favor when it determined what
sentence to impose.
   Penry was abused by his parents, attended school only for a few
days in the first grade and was in and out of mental hospitals while
growing up near Houston.
   But Mason said the Texas law would let the jury conclude Penry
``is not fully responsible for the way he is today'' and still vote
to execute him.
   He argued the jury only was permitted to consider whether
evidence of Penry's retardation and mistreatment showed that Penry
had acted ``deliberately with the reasonable expectation that death
would result.''
   While the high court might be reluctant to ban the death penalty
for all retarded killers, it still could overturn the Texas capital
punishment law on the narrower grounds cited by Mason.
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, whose vote could be pivotal in the
case, suggested to Palmer that the Texas law gives convicted
murderers limited hope of winning reprieve from the death penalty.
   She questioned whether the state law allows a juror to vote for
life in prison even if the juror believed the defendant acted with
diminished moral culpability because of his background.
   Palmer replied, ``The jury can say, `My God, this boy's been
treated so badly he didn't act deliberately,''' But he acknowledged
the jury is barred from weighing such mitigating evidence to reject
the death penalty.
   The case has attracted considerable attention because of its
potential impact for all retarded killers.
   The Clearinghouse on Georgia Prisons and Jails, a group opposed
to capital punishment, estimates that from 12 percent to 20 percent
of the more than 2,100 inmates on death rows nationwide function at
below-average intelligence.
   Ms. Carpenter was stabbed repeatedly in the chest with a pair of
scissors she was using to make a Halloween costume for her niece.
She provided a description of her assailant before she died.
   Penry at the time was a part-time delivery man for a local
appliance store. He recently had been paroled from prison, where he
had been sentenced on a rape conviction.
   The court also is considering this year whether the death penalty
should be banned for anyone who commits murder while under 18.
   In other action Wednesday, the court:
   _Gave states sweeping power to protect consumers by barring
utilities from passing on even prudent costs of abandoned nuclear
power plants. The justices, voting 8-1, barred two Pennsylvania
utilities from billing electricity customers for nearly $50 million
invested in four abandoned plants.
   _Lengthened the time union members have to sue their unions over
alleged free-speech violations, reviving a North Carolina man's
lawsuit against his union.

   Here is the prepared text of President Reagan's
farewell address to the nation Wednesday night.
   My fellow Americans, this is the 34th time I'll speak to you from
the Oval Office, and the last.
   We have been together eight years now, and soon it will be time
for me to go. But before I do, I wanted to share some thoughts, some
of which I have been saving for a long time.
   It has been the honor of my life to be your president. So many of
you have written the past few weeks to say thanks, but I could say
as much to you. Nancy and I are grateful for the opportunity you
gave us to serve.
   One of the things about the presidency is that you're always
somewhat apart. You spend a lot of time going by too fast in a car
someone else is driving, and seeing the people through tinted glass
_ the parents holding up a child, and the wave you saw too late and
couldn't return. And so many times I wanted to stop, and reach out
from behind the glass, and connect. And maybe I can do a little of
that tonight.
   People ask how I feel about leaving, and the fact is parting is
``such sweet sorrow.'' The sweet part is California, and the ranch,
and freedom. The sorrow? The goodbyes, of course, and leaving this
beautiful place.
   You know, down the hall and up the stairs from this office is the
part of the White House where the president and his family live.
There are a few favorite windows I have up there that I like to
stand and look out of early in the morning. The view is over the
grounds here to the Washington Monument, and then the Mall, and the
Jefferson Memorial. But on mornings when the humidity is low, you
can see past the Jefferson to the river, the Potomac, and the
Virginia shore. Someone said that's the view Lincoln had when he saw
the smoke rising from the battle of Bull Run. I see more prosaic
things: the grass on the banks, the morning traffic as people make
their way to work, now and then a sailboat on the river.
   I have been thinking a bit at that window. I've been reflecting
on what the past eight years have meant, and mean. And the image
that comes to mind like a refrain is a nautical one _ a small story
about a big ship, and a refugee, and a sailor.
   It was back in the early '80s, at the height of the boat people,
and the sailor was hard at work on the Carrier Midway, which was
patrolling the South China Sea. The sailor, like most American
servicemen, was young, smart, and fiercely observant. The crew spied
on the horizon a leaky little boat _ and crammed inside were
refugees from Indochina hoping to get to America. The Midway sent a
small launch to bring them to the ship, and safety. As the refugees
made their way through the choppy seas, one spied the sailor on
deck, and stood up and called out to him. He yelled, ``Hello
American sailor _ Hello Freedom Man.''

   A small moment with a big meaning, a moment the sailor, who wrote
it in a letter, couldn't get out of his mind. And, when I saw it,
neither could I.
   Because that's what it was to be an American in the 1980s: We
stood, again, for freedom. I know we always have but in the past few
years the world _ again, and in a way, we ourselves _ rediscovered
it.
   It has been quite a journey this decade, and we held together
through some stormy seas. And at the end, together, we are reaching
our destination.
   The fact is, from Grenada to the Washington and Moscow summits,
from the recession of '81 and '82 to the expansion that began in
late '82 and continues to this day, we've made a difference.
   The way I see it, there were two great triumphs, two things that
I'm proudest of. One is the economic recovery, in which the people
of America created _ and filled _ 19 million new jobs. The other is
the recovery of our morale: America is respected again in the world,
and looked to for leadership.
   Something that happened to me a few years ago reflects some of
this. It was back in 1981, and I was attending my first big economic
summit, which was held that year in Canada. The meeting place
rotates among the member countries. The opening meeting was a formal
dinner for the heads of government of the seven industrialized
nations. I sat there like the new kid in school and listened, and it
was all Francois this and Helmut that. They dropped titles and spoke
to one another on a first-name basis. At one point I sort of leaned
in and said, ``My name's Ron.''
   In that same year, we began the actions we felt would ignite an
economic comeback: Cut taxes and regulation, started to cut
spending. Soon the recovery began.
   Two years later another economic summit, with pretty much the
same cast. At the big opening meeting we all got together, and all
of a sudden just for a moment I saw that everyone was looking at me.
Then one of them broke the silence. ``Tell us about the American
miracle,'' he said.
   Back in 1980, when I was running for president, it was all so
different. Some pundits said our programs would result in
catastrophe. Our views on foreign affairs would cause war, our plans
for the economy would cause inflation to soar and bring about
economic collapse. I even remember one highly respected economist
saying, back in 1982, that ``The engines of economic growth have
shut down here and across the globe and they are likely to stay that
way for years to come. . .''
   Well, he _ and the other ``opinion leaders'' _ were wrong. The
fact is, what they called ``radical'' was really ``right;'' what
they called ``dangerous'' was just ``desperately needed.''
   And in all that time I won a nickname _ ``The Great
Communicator.'' But I never thought it was my style or the words I
used that made a difference _ it was the content. I wasn't a great
communicator but I communicate great things, and they didn't spring
full blown from my brow, they came from the heart of a great nation
_ from our experience, our wisdom, and our belief in the principles
that have guided us for two centuries.

   They called it the Reagan Revolution, and I'll accept that, but
for me it always seemed more like the Great Rediscovery: a
rediscovery of our values and our common sense.
   Common sense told us that when you put a big tax on something,
the people will produce less of it. So we cut the people's tax rates
and the people produced more than ever before. The economy bloomed
like a plant that had been cut back and could now grow quicker and
stronger. Our economic program brought about the longest peacetime
expansion in our history: real family income up, the poverty rate
down, entrepreneurship booming and an explosion in research and new
technology. We are exporting more than ever because American
industry became more competitive and at the same time, we summoned
the national will to knock down protectionist walls abroad instead
of erecting them at home.
   Common sense also told us that to preserve the peace we'd have to
become strong again after years of weakness and confusion. So we
rebuilt our defenses _ and this New Year we toasted the new
peacefulness around the globe. Not only have the superpowers
actually begun to reduce their stockpiles of nuclear weapons _ and
hope for even more progress is bright _ but the regional conflicts
that rack the globe are also beginning to cease. The Persian Gulf is
no longer a war zone, the Soviets are leaving Afghanistan, the
Vietnamese are preparing to pull out of Cambodia, and an
American-mediated accord will soon send 50,000 Cuban troops home
from Angola.
   The lesson of all this was, of course, that because we are a
great nation, our challenges seem complex. It will always be this
way. But as long as we remember our first principles and believe in
ourselves, the future will always be ours.
   And something else we learned: Once you begin a great movement,
there's no telling where it will end. We meant to change a nation,
and instead, we changed a world.
   Countries across the globe are turning to free markets and free
speech _ and turning away from the ideologies of the past. For them,
the Great Rediscovery of the 1980s has been that, lo and behold, the
moral way of government is the practical way of government.
Democracy, the profoundly good, is also the profoundly productive.
   When you've got to the point where you can celebrate the
anniversaries of your 39th birthday you can sit back sometimes,
review your life and see it flowing before you. For me there was a
fork in the river, and it was right in the middle of my life.
   I never meant to go into politics; it wasn't my intention when I
was young. But I was raised to believe you had to pay your way for
the blessings bestowed on you. I was happy with my career in the
entertainment world, but I ultimately went into politics because I
wanted to protect something precious.
   Ours was the first revolution in the history of mankind that
truly reversed the course of government, and with three little
words: ``We the People.''
   ``We the People'' tell the government what to do, it doesn't tell
us. ``We the People'' are the driver _ the government is the car.
And we decide where it should go, and by what route, and how fast.
Almost all the world's consitutions are documents in which
governments tell the people what their privileges are. Our
Constitution is a document in which ``We the People'' tell the
government what it is allowed to do. ``We the People'' are free.
   This belief has been the underlying basis for everything I have
tried to do these past eight years.
   But back in the 1960s when I began, it seemed to me that we had
begun reversing the order of things _ that through more and more
rules and regulations and confiscatory taxes, the government was
taking more of our money, more of our options, and more of our
freedom. I went into politics in part to put up my hand and say,
``Stop!'' I was a citizen politician, and it seemed the right thing
for a citizen to do.

   I think we have stopped a lot of what needed stopping. And I hope
we have once again reminded people that man is not free unless
government is limited. There's a clear cause and effect here that is
as neat and predictable as a law of physics: as government expands,
liberty contracts.
   Nothing is less free than pure communism, and yet we have, the
past few years, forged a satsifying new closeness with the Soviet
Union. I've been asked if this isn't a gamble and my answer is no,
because we're basing our actions not on words but deeds.
   The detente of the 1970s was based not on actions but promises.
They'd promise to treat their own people and the people of the world
better, but the gulag was still the gulag, and the state was still
expansionist, and they still waged proxy wars in Africa, Asia, and
Latin America.
   This time, so far, it's different: President Gorbachev has
brought about some internal democratic reforms and begun the
withdrawal from Afghanistan. He has also freed prisoners whose names
I've given him every time we've met.
   But life has a way of reminding you of big things through small
incidents. Once, during the heady days of the Moscow summit, Nancy
and I decided to break off from the entourage one afternoon to visit
the shops on Arbat Street, a little street just off Moscow's main
shopping area.
   Even though our visit was a surprise, every Russian there
immediately recognized us, and called out our names and reached for
our hands. We were just about swept away by the warmth _ you could
almost feel the possibilities in all that joy. But within seconds a
KGB detail pushed their way toward us and began pushing and shoving
the people in the crowd. It was an interesting moment. It reminded
me that while the man on the street in the Soviet Union yearns for
peace, the government is communist _ those who run it are communists
_ and that means we and they view such issues as freedom and human
rights very differently.
   We must keep up our guard _ but we must also continue to work
together to lessen and eliminate tension and mistrust.
   My view is that President Gorbachev is different from previous
Soviet leaders. I think he knows some of the things wrong with his
society and is trying to fix them. We wish him well. And we'll
continue to work to make sure that the Soviet Union that eventually
emerges from this process is a less threatening one.
   What it all boils down to is this: I want the new closeness to
continue. And it will as long as we make it clear that we will
continue to act in a certain way as long as they continue to act in
a helpful manner. If and when they don't _ at first pull your
punches. If they persist, pull the plug.
   It's still trust _ but verify.
   It's still play _ but cut the cards.
   It's still watch closely _ and don't be afraid to see what you
see.

   I've been asked if I have any regrets. I do.
   The deficit is one. I've been talking a great deal about that
lately, but tonight isn't for arguments and I'm going to hold my
tongue.
   But an observation: I've had my share of victories in the
Congress, but what few people noticed is that I never won anything
you didn't win for me. They never saw my troops; they never saw
Reagan's Regiments, the American people. You won every battle with
every call you made and letter you wrote demanding action.
   Well, action is still needed. If we're to finish the job,
Reagan's Regiments will have to become the Bush Brigades. Soon he'll
be the chief, and he'll need you every bit as much as I did.
   Finally, there is a great tradition of warnings in presidential
farewells, and I've got one that's been on my mind for some time.
   But oddly enough it starts with one of the things I'm proudest of
the past eight years: the resurgence of national pride that I called
``the new patriotism.'' This national feeling is good, but it won't
count for much and it won't last unless it's grounded in
thoughtfulness and knowledge.
   An informed patriotism is what we want. And are we doing a good
enough job teaching our children what America is and what she
represents in the long history of the world?
   Those of us who are over 35 or so years of age grew up in a
different America. We were taught, very directly, what it means to
be an American, and we absorbed almost in the air a love of country
and an appreciation of its institutions. If you didn't get these
things from your family you got them from the neighborhood, from the
father down the street who fought in Korea or the family who lost
someone at Anzio. Or you could get a sense of patriotism from
school. And if all else failed you could get a sense of patriotism
from the popular culture. The movies celebrated democratic values
and implicitly reinforced the idea that America was special. TV was
like that too through the mid-'60s.
   But now we're about to enter the '90s, and some things have
changed. Younger parents aren't sure that an unambivalent
appreciation of America is the right thing to teach modern children.
And as for those who create the popular culture, well-grounded
patriotism is no longer in style.
   Our spirit is back, but we haven't reinstitutionalized it. We've
got to do a better job of getting across that America is freedom _
freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom of enterprise _ and
freedom is special and rare. It's fragile; it needs protection.
   We've got to teach history based not on what's in fashion but
what's important: Why the pilgrims came here, who Jimmy Doolittle
was, and what those 30 seconds over Tokyo meant. You know, four
years ago, on the 40th anniversary of D-Day, I read a letter from a
young woman writing to her late father, who'd fought on Omaha Beach.
Her name is Lisa Zanatta Henn, and she said, we will always
remember, we will never forget what the boys of Normandy did. Well,
let's help her keep her word.

   If we forget what we did, we won't know who we are. I am warning
of an eradication of the American memory that could result,
ultimately, in an erosion of the American spirit.
   Let's start with some basics _ more attention to American history
and a greater emphasis on civic ritual. And let me offer lesson No.
1 about America: All great change in America begins at the dinner
table. So tomorrow night in the kitchen I hope the talking begins.
And children, if your parents haven't been teaching you what it
means to be an American, let 'em know and nail 'em on it. That would
be a very American thing to do.
   And that's about all I have to say tonight. Except for one thing.
   The past few days when I've been at that window upstairs I've
thought a bit of the shining ``city upon a hill.'' The phrase comes
from John Winthrop, who wrote it to describe the America he
imagined. What he imagined was important because he was an early
pilgrim _ an early ``Freedom Man.'' He journeyed here on what today
we'd call a little wooden boat; and, like the other pilgrims, he was
looking for a home that would be free.
   I've spoken of the shining city all my political life, but I
don't know if I ever quite communicated what I saw when I said it.
But in my mind it was a tall proud city built on rocks stronger than
oceans, wind-swept, God-blessed, and teeming with people of all
kinds living in harmony and peace _ a city with free ports that
hummed with commerce and creativity, and if there had to be city
walls, the walls had doors and the doors were open to anyone with
the will and the heart to get here.
   That's how I saw it, and see it still.
   And how stands the city on this winter night? More prosperous,
more secure and happier than it was eight years ago. But more than
that: after 200 years, two centuries, she still stands strong and
true on the granite ridge, and her glow has held steady no matter
what storm. And she's still a beacon, still a magnet for all who
must have freedom, for all the pilgrims from all the lost places who
are hurtling through the darkness, toward home.
   We've done our part. And as I ``walk off into the city streets,''
a final word to the men and women of the Reagan Revolution _ the men
and women across America who for eight years did the work that
brought America back:
   My friends, we did it. We weren't just marking time; we made a
difference. We made the city stronger _ we made the city freer _ and
we left her in good hands.

   President-elect Bush and other politicians
should make adult literacy a national priority and commit up to $550
million for promoting it, says a report released today by a
nonpartisan research institute.
   ``The primary need is for leadership,'' says the report, called
``Jump Start: The Federal Role in Adult Literacy'' and issued by the
Southport Institute for Policy Analysis.
   Forrest Chisman, author of the study, said he is encouraged by
President-elect Bush's stated interest in being an ``education
president'' and his wife Barbara's longtime activism in literacy.
   Chisman, director of Southport's Project on Adult Literacy,
recommended new federal spending of $550 million but said even less
would permit ``a quantum leap forward.''
   An estimated 10 percent to 15 percent of U.S. adults, some 20
million to 30 million people, lack basic literacy skills.
   Many are in the work force. Chisman contends this aspect of the
literacy problem has the greatest immediate economic importance and
should receive more attention.
   ``Most public and private programs are not available to people
who are on the job,'' he wrote. ``Almost all federal resources are
targeted on the unemployed or other disadvantaged groups.''
   In an accompanying statement, Mrs. Bush said she hoped the report
would ``lead to a more unified, coherent approach to this major
national concern.''
   Among Chisman's recommendations:
   _A six-month task force to set literacy goals and means of
achieving them, and a Cabinet Council on Adult Literacy to
coordinate federal efforts.
   _Passage of an Adult Basic Skills Act to set up a National Center
for Adult Literacy, establish matching grants for state and local
programs, and create a training program for adult literacy workers.
   _Authorization of basic skills training for the employed under
the Job Training Partnership Act.

<HEAD>73-Year-Old Cancer Patient Imprisoned in Sewer Dispute</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRUCE SMITH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 73-year-old cancer patient says he
decided to go to prison as a matter of principle rather than accept
a solution to a decade-old dispute over a sewer hookup that would
have cost him nothing.
   ``I'm doing this to show my rights to America,'' Wilbert Siegel,
a retired metal worker with rectal cancer, said Wednesday as he was
taken from his modest James Island home near here to begin a
six-month sentence for contempt of court.
   A large American flag decorated Siegel's porch and yellow ribbons
adorned pine trees in his yard as he tearfully kissed his wife,
Hattie, goodbye.
   He was then taken to Lieber Correctional Institution in
Ridgeville.
   ``I'm not scared because I'm going to jail.'' But, he said, ``six
months is a long time for anybody to go to jail, especially on a
charge like this.''
   Siegel was imprisoned for defying a 1986 court order requiring
him to tie his septic tank to a sewer line.
   The problem began in 1979 when the Siegels paid a fee to tap into
the line. When the line was installed, it ended at a corner of their
lot, too far away, according to Siegel, who said he would have had
to spend $2,000 and take down four large trees to make the
connection.
   Siegel said the line should be extended in front of the house,
where a straight 30-foot connection could be made.
   Ray Patterson, chairman of the James Island Public Service
District, said the utility had been willing to extend the line, but
the Siegels would have been billed an additional $200, which they
declined to pay.
   Patterson said it would cost the public utility about $1,200
today to extend the line.
   He said it would cost only $700 to connect to the corner tap, and
that district commissioners offered to come out on their own time
and dig the ditch.
   The utility ``bent over backwards'' to resolve the problem, he
said.
   A Charleston Heights plumber on Tuesday offered to make the
connection for free, but the Siegels declined, saying they didn't
want charity.
   ``What's the difference where the tap is if somebody puts it in
free and you don't have to pay for it?,'' Patterson said.
   He added that the Siegels were ``just looking for publicity and
to get sympathy.''
   Circuit Judge William Howell on Nov. 1 found Siegel in contempt
of the 1986 ruling that he make the connection, and gave him 60 days
to hook up or go to prison.
   Siegel, who'll appear in court again after serving his sentence,
predicted he'll probably be returned to prison.
   ``I have a life sentence for not hooking up to an unequal sewer
line,'' he said.
   He said more than 100 area homes haven't tapped into the system
but that he was the one who was singled out and eventually arrested.
   Patterson said the other homes were being handled one by one.
   The public service district has spent about $40,000 in legal fees
on the matter, including defending a $500,000 federal lawsuit by the
Siegels challenging the utility's right to require the connection,
officials said.
   That lawsuit was dismissed last year.
   It probably will cost more than $6,000 to care for Siegel during
his six-month prison stay, according to state Department of
Corrections spokesman Francis X. Archibald.

   The United States, Britain and France
joined in vetoing a Security Council resolution that ``deplored''
the U.S. Navy's downing of two Libyan military jets over the
Mediterranean on Jan. 4.
   Just hours before Wednesday's vote, U.S. officials said the Navy
had canceled missile tests in the Mediterreanan planned for next
week that Libyan Ambassador Ali A. Treiki had called provocative.
The officials gave no hint the cancellation was linked with the
resolution.
   Libyan officials have claimed for weeks that the United States is
preparing public opinion for a U.S. attack on a factory near Tripoli
that Washington claims has been built for the manufacture of poison
gas.
   U.S. officials said the cancellation of the Jan. 16-17 missile
tests is intended to reduce tensions between the United States and
Libya, which Washington accuses of fostering international terrorism.
   Canada joined the allies Wednesday in voting against the
resolution.
   The vote was 9-4, with the Soviet Union, China, Ethiopia,
Colombia, Malaysia, Algeria, Nepal, Senegal and Yugoslavia voting in
favor. Finland and Brazil abstained.
   As permanent members of the 15-member council, any negative vote
by the United States, Britain or France was enough to kill the
resolution.
   The resolution ``deplores the downing of the two Libyan
reconnaisssance planes'' and asked the Navy to suspend its maneuvers
in international waters off Libya.
   Treiki disclosed the planned missile tests during Security
Council debate Tuesday night after the U.S. 6th Fleet informed
Libyan air traffic controllers so they could divert civilian air
traffic.
   U.S. sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
canceled exercise was to have involved surface-to-air missiles, not
air-to-ground missiles of the type that would be used in any attack
on Libya.
   Deputy U.S. Ambassador Herbert S. Okun announced the cancellation
just before the council began debate, and officials in Washington
confirmed it.
   Okun told the Security Council the American F-14 pilots fired in
self-defense in the Jan. 4 encounter with the Libyan MiG-23s, a
right nations have under the U.N. Charter.
   ``These were not unarmed Libyan reconnaissance aircraft, as this
council has been told. They were highly sophisticated fighter
aircraft, and we have shown the Security Council and the world
photographic proof that they were armed,'' Okun said.
   On Friday, U.S. Ambassador Vernon A. Walters displayed
photographs of one Libyan jet showing shapes resembling missile pods
on its wings and fuselage.
   Libya's deputy ambassador, Ali Sunni Muntasser, said the pictures
were retouched and the planes were unarmed and on reconnaissance
flights.
   Britain agreed that the U.S. pilots acted in self-defense.
British Ambassador Sir Crispin Tickell said the vetoed resolution
was ``couched in the wrong terms and proceeds from wrong
assumptions.''
   Canada's ambassador, Yves Fortier, said the resolution contained
``a one-sided account.'' France's deputy representative, M. Pierre
Brochand, expressed similar sentiments.
   In Washington, U.S officials announced that the Navy will rotate
two aircraft carrier battle groups well away from Libya as one
replaces the other.
   They said the battle group led by the carrier John F. Kennedy,
from which the F-14s flew, would complete its six-month deployment
and be replaced by the carrier Theodore Roosevelt starting late this
week off western Italy.

   Congress is asking for a record $114 million
for its official mailings in 1990, which is, not coincidentally, an
election year.
   The figure is included in President Reagan's proposed budget but
Congress actually draws up its own spending proposal. It is normal
for Congress to about double its mailing costs in election years,
even though campaign materials cannot be sent with taxpayer money.
   For fiscal 1989, Congress has budgeted $60.9 million, according
to budget documents. In the election year of 1988, however,
congressional mailings cost $113.3 million.

   The Federal Reserve Board is asking that
lenders be required to provide home equity loan borrowers with more
information about the cost of such loans.
   Under the rules proposed Wednesday, lenders generally would have
to provide potential borrowers with a written explanation of the
terms and conditions of the loan at the time of loan application and
before any non-refundable fee is collected.
   The disclosures must include a full explanation of how the
interest rate and monthly payments might change and the
circumstances under which immediate repayment of the loan could be
demanded.
   Congress has prohibited lenders from unilaterally changing the
terms of the loan after it has been taken out. The Federal Reserve
rules would allow changes, such as providing a lower monthly payment
over a longer term, provided the borrower agrees to the changes in
writing.

   The Vietnamese government is returning the

let five U.S. teams of experts in the country for a search mission.
   The announcement Wednesday comes less than a month after Vietnam
transferred the largest single group of remains ever to the United

   The repatriation of the 25 remains will occur Jan. 23, with an
American cargo plane flying to Hanoi and transporting the remains to

   The dollar lost ground against the Japanese yen on
Thursday, while share prices closed unchanged on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange.
   The dollar finished at 126.12 yen, down 0.83 yen from Wednesday's
126.95-yen close. The currency, which opened lower at 125.90 yen
after its overnight decline on overseas markets, moved in a range of
125.90-126.22 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, a 136.94-point
gainer for a record 31,143.45 close on Wednesday, finished unchanged
from the previous day's close.
   The U.S. currency's lower opening in Tokyo followed concerted
dollar-selling overnight by the U.S. Federal Reserve and several
European central banks on overseas markets, dealers said.
   Central banks in several European countries including West
Germany, Switzerland, Britain and Italy intervened in exchange
markets Wednesday to brake the dollar's recent rise against their
respective currencies.
   The dollar was firmer due to buying by Japanese investors, a
dealer with a major commercial bank said. They see the dollar's
early January rally as indicating the currency will not fall right
away to the low 120-yen range or below, as had been widely expected,
the dealer said.
   As long as investors do not anticipate the dollar's rapid
decline, their strong appetite for the currency will continue, he
added.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, market players were mainly selling
issues to prevent the index from rising further, as well as to
collect profits after the Nikkei's sharp increase since last
Thursday, said a dealer with Nomura Securities, Japan's largest
brokerage.
   Trading normally slows down after a few days of consecutive
gains, he added.

<HEAD>World Body Ended Last Year $750 Million In Debt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United Nations achieved some of its
most spectacular diplomatic breakthroughs in 1988, and ended the
year more than $750 million in the red because member nations didn't
pay their bills.
   U.N. financial spokesman Fred Eckhard said Wednesday that just 86
of the 159 member nations paid all their dues through the end of
1988, leaving the world body $394.9 million in arrears in the
regular budget and $355.2 million in debt for peacekeeping
operations.
   The United States, the U.N.'s largest contributor, was also the
chief ``deadbeat,'' owing 53.5 percent of the total arrears of both
budgets _ $401.7 million.
   Washington was responsible for about 77 percent of the arrears in
the regular budget, $307.6 million. The Soviet Union owed 2 percent
of the regular budget arrears, $9 million.
   Moscow was responsible for nearly half the arrears in
peacekeeping, $172.1 million, while the United States was
responsible for 26 percent, or $94.1 million.
   The mounting debt exasperated U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez
de Cuellar as the world body embarked on new, costly peacekeeping
ventures.
   U.N. peacekeepers are in charge of monitoring the Soviet
withdrawal from Afghanistan, the Aug. 20 cease-fire between Iran and
Iraq, the Cuban pullout from Angola and South Africa's exit from
Namibia.
   Other peacekeeping missions are possible this year in the Western
Sahara and Cambodia.
   Perez de Cuellar said in December, when he accepted the 1988
Nobel Peace Prize on behalf of U.N. peacekeepers, that the failure
of members to pay dues threatens the work of the United Nations.
   President Reagan has ordered the State Department to devise a
payment schedule for repaying all U.S. arrears;
Undersecretary-General Joseph V. Reed has said the department told
him it would be a three-to-five-year plan.
   Until Reagan ordered the release of $188 million and made the
repayment pledge in September, U.N. officials had predicted the
world body would be unable to meet payrolls by November.
   The Soviet Union has also pledged to repay all its arrears and
has worked out a repayment schedule with the United Nations.
   The total regular budget of the United Nations is about $880
million, of which the United States is assessed one-fourth and the
Soviet Union 11.8 percent.
   In addition to the United States and the Soviet Union, 10 other
nations owe more than $1 million to the regular budget: South
Africa, $33.9 million; Iran, $7.9 million; Argentina, $5.2 million;
Poland, $4.3 million; Romania, $4 million; Yugoslavia, $3.5 million;
Israel, $3.1 million; Libya, $2.8 million; Peru, $1.4 million; and
Hungary, $1.2 million.
   Only Canada, Norway, Finland, Iceland, Sweden and Denmark have
already paid their 1989 dues in full.

   They're heading for the last roundup at the
40-year-old Bar Double-R Ranch. But the trail bosses hope they can
find a new pasture for the only no-cover, no-minimum,
country-western basement nightclub in downtown Chicago.
   An office skyscraper is planned for the site where the Sundowners
trio entertains the crowd, and 30 varieties of chili are served to
the folks who stroll in off Randolph Street.
   The movie theater next door has already been closed, but the
Ranch is still filled with the sounds of guitar picking _ for a few
more weeks.
   If the owners can't find a new location before the wrecking ball
strikes, the Sundowners will have to find a new place to hang their
white Stetsons, and night owls will no longer be able to find a
$3.15 ``chili mac tamale cheese salami bowl'' at 3 a.m.
   However, co-owner Arthur Brown is optimistic he'll find a place
for the Ranch, which has been at its current location since 1978.
   ``Both of its previous sites got torn down, too,'' he said
Wednesday.
   ``They tell us we've got three or four weeks, maybe a bit
longer,'' Brown said. ``We're looking at various sites in the
downtown area. Most of the nightlife seems to be moving to River
North, but I don't think River North is for us.''
   River North, a fashionable neighborhood with loft condominiums
and art deco restaurants, might not be the best place for a club
that has a barbed wire collection behind the bar and ``Bulls'' and
``Heifers'' signs on the restrooms.
   River North's nouvelle sensibilities also might be offended by
the Ranch's menu, which features items such as the ``Jesse James
Steak (A Steal!),'' and the occasional ornery patron.
   When the music's going good and the club is near its 200-patron
capacity, the cook, who calls himself ``Little Bill,'' sometimes has
to double as waiter and calmer of the crowd.
   ``When the parties get a little wild, you might find someone who
wants to pull a little strip show, and I've got to stop them,'' he
explained.
   For singer and guitarist Bob Boyd, 57, the Ranch has been home
since he left Chattanooga, Tenn., 35 years ago.
   ``Don (Walls), Curt (Delaney) and I have been the Sundowners most
of our adult lives,'' Boyd said. ``We do about seven sets on a good
night, mixing in a little blues and a little pop with a lot of C&amp;W.
   ``We keep four big books with a few thousand songs in them up by
the bandstand in case we get an odd request _ the tunes are usually
no problem, but you can forget the words.
   ``Mostly, though, the old songs wear the best. Over the years,
we've had the most requests for Roy Acuff's version of `The Wabash
Cannonball' and old Bob Wills' `San Antonio Rose.'''
   The Sundowners are the only act advertised on the Ranch's
street-level sign, but other entertainers have been known to walk
down the steps and sit in for a set or two. Red Foley, Eddie Arnold,
Gene Autry and Mel Tillis are among those who have dropped in over
the years.
   ``We know most of their songs,'' Boyd said. ``Frankly, being at
it as long as we have, we know most of everybody's songs. When we
don't know a song _ then that's what I'd call an odd request.''

   A kindergarten student brought a loaded automatic
handgun to his school before handing it barrel-first to his teacher,
who was surprised to find it wasn't a toy, authorities said.
   ``Either luck or good fortune was on my side,'' the shaken
teacher, Donald Miller, said through United Federation of Teachers
spokesman Bert Shanas.
   ``I'm just saying a prayer of thanks when I think of what could
have happened to the kids in the cafeteria or myself.''
   The 5-year-old boy, whose name was not released, told school
authorities that ``an unknown man put the gun in his pocket on the
way to school,'' said police spokeswoman Sgt. Diane Kubler.
   Police contacted the boy's mother and were trying to determine
where the gun came from, Board of Education spokesman Frank Sobrino
said.
   The teacher thought the gun was a toy when it was called to his
attention by another child in the cafeteria at a Bronx elementary
school Wednesday morning, Shanas said.
   When Miller asked the boy for it, he handed it over with the
barrel pointed at Miller's stomach, Shanas said. The teacher took it
to the office, where a custodian confirmed it was real, cocked and
loaded.

<HEAD>Dollar Falls Against Yen, Stocks Unchanged</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar fell today against the Japanese yen,
while the Tokyo Stock Exchange's leading index closed unchanged from
the previous day.
   The dollar, which had gained 1.25 yen on Wednesday, fell back by
0.83 yen today, closing at 126.12 yen. It opened today at 125.90
yen, and ranged between 125.90 and 126.22 yen.
   The U.S. currency's sharply lower opening in Tokyo followed
concerted dollar-selling intervention by European and U.S. central
banks on overseas markets overnight, dealers said.
   Central banks in several European countries including West
Germany, Switzerland, Britain and Italy intervened in exchange
markets Wednesday to brake the dollar's recent rise against their
currencies.
   But news of the intervention did not sharply discourage
dollar-buying in Tokyo, as market players expected U.S. monetary
authorities to keep high interest rates, said a dealer with
Mitsubishi Bank, speaking on condition of anonymity. Higher interest
rates make dollar-denominated investments more attractive.
   ``But the current dollar-buying trend will slow down as next
week's U.S. monthly trade report approaches,'' the dealer added.
   Another dealer at a major commercial bank said that as long as
investors do not anticipate a rapid decline in the dollar, their
strong appetite for the currency will continue.
   On the stock exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, which
climbed 136.94 points Wednesday to a record high close of 31,143.45,
finished at the same level today. In the afternoon session, the
index regained the 86.50 points lost in morning trading.
   Dealers said speculative investors' buying interest, targeted on
steel issues Thursday afternoon, helped the market's main barometer
to recover.
   Trading was active, with volume traded on the first section
estimated at 1.2 billion shares.

   A man who spent 20 years trying to
leave Cuba unwittingly deported himself and his family from the
United States for what he thought would be a 20 minute excursion to
the Canadian side of Niagra Falls.
   Three weeks after they left their Miami home on the trip, Carlos
Fajardo, his wife and two adopted children remain stranded in motel
in Canada.
   They set out Dec. 20 on a Christmas quest for snow, which his
adopted children, Yoandys, 12, and Yordalys, 9, had never seen.
   Even though the family lived in the United States for four years,
immigration officials will not allow them back because they are
illegal aliens.
   ``We came for 20 minutes,'' Fajardo said. ``No one told us we
could not go back.''
   Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., has joined the Fajardos' cause by asking
officials to let the family back.
   ``This family has strong ties to the Miami community through
relatives, business and local school attendance,'' Graham said in a
letter to Immigration and Naturalization Service officials. ``It
would be comforting to these people for them to be able to resume
their well-established lives.''
   Fajardo, 39, a small, soft-spoken man who tried for two decades
to leave his native Cuba, said the family drove 1,500 miles in their
truck to Niagara Falls, N.Y., where they checked into a motel and
planned to visit Canada.
   He told Canadian border guards his family wanted to see the
Horseshoe Falls.
   When the family returned, however, U.S. border guards demanded to
proof of their citizenship. All Fajardo had was a Florida driver's
license.
   At first, Fajardo maintained he was a U.S. citizen. Later, he
said he was a resident alien. But immigration officials, after a
search of their records, determined otherwise.
   Benedict Ferro, director of the INS office in Buffalo, said
Fajardo's wife, Bermaida, and her two children entered the United
States illegally in 1985 and Fajardo entered the country illegally
in 1986.
   Fajardo denies entering the country illegally.
   An immigration judge in 1987 denied asylum to Mrs. Fajardo and
the two children. She appealed the decision in August on grounds
that she would face persecution if returned to communist Cuba, but
her appeal was rejected.
   Fajardo's application for asylum was pending when he crossed the
border. His status was officially nullified by leaving the country,
Ferro said.
   Fajardo could reapply, but his wife and children cannot because
they previously provided fraudulent information to immigration
officials, Ferro said.
   ``The family lied and their credibility is about zero at this
point,'' Ferro said.
   Canadian authorities have given the family permission to stay in
Canada until Sunday. What happens to them after that is uncertain.
   Under terms of a bond he posted in order to leave Cuba, Fajardo
agreed not to return to his homeland. He said he left the country in
1984 with only the clothes on his back.
   He achieved relative prosperity in the United States working in
several jobs, including his current one as a boat builder, and said
he owns a home in Miami.
   As he spoke Tuesday, his wife and children sat watching
television in their small motel room. He would occassionally turn to
the boy, Yoandys, to help him answer in English.
   ``We are all very tired,'' he said. ``The children are missing
school ... We want to go home.''
   Now the family is running low on money, said Sister Margaret
Quinn of Fort Erie, Ontario, who has been providing assistance
through the Niagara Refugee Committee.
   She has urged American and Canadian immigration officials to
allow the family to return to the care of their relatives in Miami,
but says the case seems to be closed.
   ``It's really contrary to the whole spirit of international law
and relations to have them walking about without a country,'' she
said. ``This whole thing is really a mess.''

   Black &amp; Decker Inc. says it is voluntarily
recalling two space-saving coffeemakers because they can overheat
and catch fire.
   The recall applies to all Model PDC401 and Model PDC403
Spacemaker Plus Thermal Carafe Coffeemakers bought after July 1988.
   The coffeemakers, which ordinarily hang from underneath kitchen
cabinets, overheat when water does not flow properly from the
reservoir to the heating unit, Black &amp; Decker said.
   Company officials said Wednesday they are aware of ``a few
instances'' of such fires.
   Black &amp; Decker said customers who return the coffeemakers will
get a free substitute plus a full refund or a certificate for a
redesigned model, which is expected to be available in April.
   The toll-free number for instructions on how to return the
coffeemakers is 1-800-833-3396.

<HEAD>Students Protest Proposed Teachers Wage Cuts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An estimated 10,000 students, most of
them high-school age or younger, marched on the Education Ministry
to protest a proposed cut in teachers' pay.
   Some schools let their students off for the mile-long march,
Others counted participation as a classroom exercise in social
science courses. Some students simply cut classes to be there.
   ``Who Will Rule Sweden In 20 Years, Educated People or
Uneducated'' said one placard.
   The rally came a day after Finance Minister Kjell Olof Feldt
presented a budget bill to Parliament that trimmed $27 million, or
about 0.5 percent, off teachers' wages.
   Feldt said teachers' salaries went up last year by more than the
5.6 percent limit set by Parliament.
   The cut was condemned by all five opposition parties, which
threaten to unite to kill the measure.
   Critics say schools are run down, textbooks tattered and torn,
qualified teachers too few and meals in the free school canteens are
tasteless.
   Primary school teachers earn up to $2,000 a month, while the
best-qualified secondary-school teachers earn up to $2,270 a month
after 15 years in the profession.

   A woman accused of drowning her 2-month-old
son, dismembering his body and dumping the remains in two creeks
reportedly told police she couldn't cope ``because he was always
crying,'' authorities said.
   Tanya Dacri, 20, and her husband, Phillip, were being held today
pending an arraignment, authorities said.
   Police divers searching murky Neshaminy Creek in suburban Croydon
on Wednesday found five green plastic bags containing Zachary
Dacri's head, hands and feet, said police Capt. Robert Grasso.
   A search for the torso in Pohopoco Creek near the Lehigh River in
Carbon County about 80 miles to the northwest was called off at
dusk, Grasso said. The search was to resume today.
   Mrs. Dacri is charged with murder, false reports, hindering
apprehension, tampering with evidence, obstruction of justice and
conspiracy in tampering with a corpse, police said. If convicted,
she could be sentenced to death.
   Her husband is charged with obstruction of justice, tampering
with evidence, aiding in a crime and conspiracy in tampering with a
corpse, police said. If convicted, he could be sentenced to up to 22
years in prison, Assistant District Barbara Christie said.
   Grasso said police believe Dacri, 22, did not kill his son but
helped dispose of the body.
   Mrs. Dacri initially told police her baby was kidnapped at a mall
Tuesday, authorities said.
   She later told investigators she drowned Zachary in a bathtub
Saturday, cut the corpse up with a knife Sunday and stuffed the
remains into plastic trash bags, The Philadelphia Inquirer reported
today, quoting unidentified police sources.
   Mrs. Dacri said that she and her husband drove to bridges
crossing the creeks and threw the bags in, the sources said. She
took officers to both locations to show them where to search, the
sources said.
   Police searching a trash container outside the Dacris' apartment
building in northeast Philadelphia found a knife believed to have
been the one used to dismember Zachary, the newspaper said.
   Mrs. Dacri told police she had tried to cope with raising her son
and year-old daughter, Christine, but couldn't ``because he was
always crying,'' the Inquirer said. The daughter has been placed
with a grandparent, police said.
   A homicide detective declined to comment on the newspaper report
early today, saying no supervisor with the authorization to release
such information was on duty.
   Police became suspicious shortly after Mrs. Dacri reported that
two men grabbed Zachary and her purse at a Philadelphia shopping
mall Tuesday, said police Capt. Richard DeLise.
   She told police the kidnappers drove off in a sedan with no
license plate and a third person behind the wheel, and said there
were no witnesses in what is normally a busy area.
   Police said the Dacris lost custody of Christine for eight months
last year following allegations of child abuse. They underwent
counseling before the child was returned to them in September,
authorities said.

<HEAD>Doctor Group Proposes Government-Run Health Insurance For All</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States should abolish private health
insurance and instead provide Canadian-style government coverage for
everyone, a group representing 1,200 doctors proposed today.
   ``Our health care system is failing,'' the group wrote. ``It
denies access to many in need and is expensive, inefficient and
increasingly bureaucratic.''
   They suggested a system modeled on Canada's national health
program that they said would cost no more than the United States'
current mix of public and private coverage.
   ``Every year, as the costs of the current system go up and up and
the number of uninsured people go up and up, that will be a push
toward this fundamental change in our system,'' said Dr. David U.
Himmelstein.
   The proposal was drawn up by the 1,200-member Physicians for a
National Health Program and published in the New England Journal of
Medicine.
   The group's 30-member writing committee was chaired by Dr.
Steffie Woolandler and Himmelstein. The two doctors, based at
Cambridge Hospital in Cambridge, Mass., recently published ``a
Marxist view of current U.S. health policy,'' which also praised the
Canadian system.
   ``There are people of all political stripes involved in writing
this, from the right to the left wing,'' Himmelstein said in an
interview. ``I am clearly one of the left-wing people.''
   A second paper in the journal, written by Alain Enthoven and
Richard Kronick of Stanford Business School, proposed a less drastic
plan for universal health insurance.
   Their program would retain private insurance but require
employers to provide coverage for their workers. Those not covered
at work would contribute through taxes, and poor people's coverage
would be totally subsidized by the government.
   These authors argued that a complete government takeover of
health care financing ``would represent far too radical a change to
be politically feasible in this country.''
   Dr. Arnold S. Relman, the journal's editor, wrote in an editorial
that the ``time has come'' for universal health insurance, but he
did not endorse either plan.
   Himmelstein and Woolhandler argued that ``a single comprehensive
program is necessary both to ensure equal access to care and to
minimize the complexity and expense of billing and administration.''
   Funding for their program would be based on an income tax ``or
other progressive tax.''
   The authors said the cost of extra service would be offset by
lower administrative overhead, making the total cost no more than
the current system.

   Rock Hudson's former homosexual lover said the
actor began losing weight and having night sweats in June 1984, but
it wasn't until a year later that he learned Hudson was stricken
with AIDS.
   ``I was sitting alone in Rock's home. I turned on the television
set: `Rock Hudson had acquired immune deficiency syndrome,''' Marc
Christian told a Superior Court jury Wednesday in his $11 million
lawsuit against Hudson's estate.
   ``I began to sweat. I blacked out. I thought, `Oh my God. I'm a
dead man.'' Harold Rhoden, Christian's attorney, asked him why he
thought he would die.
   ``Because I had very intimate sexual contact with Rock Hudson
(and) he had full-blown AIDS,'' Christian replied.
   Christian, 35, an aspiring musician, is suing the actor's estate
and former secretary, Mark Miller, alleging they didn't tell him
Hudson had acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
   Christian, who said he does not have the sexually transmitted
disease that killed Hudson in 1985, denied defense assertions that
he was publicity-seeking opportunist who filed the lawsuit after he
learned Hudson did not include him in his will.
   Christian, under questioning by Rhoden, said he had no idea
whether he was included in the will.
   The lawsuit also contends Christian should receive compensation
for emotional distress and fear that he had been infected with the
deadly disease.
   Christian said Hudson developed a sore on his neck in June 1984,
which Hudson told him was caused by the sun, and was losing weight.
   ``His skin became very dry. He had scales. He was itching a lot.
He had skin rashes. He began to sweat at night,'' Christian
testified.
   Although he questioned Hudson about the symptoms, Hudson told him
he either was dieting, had the flu or gallstone problems, and Miller
told him the actor was anorexic, Christian said.
   Christian said he believed Hudson and continued to have
unprotected sexual intercourse with him until February 1985, when
Hudson lost interest in sex. Christian said he has been celibate
since then.
   It wasn't until he heard a July 1985 television news broadcast
that Hudson had AIDS that Christian learned his lover had the fatal
disease, he said.
   Christian said Miller called him from Paris, where Hudson had
collapsed, to see how he was taking the news.
   According to Christian, Miller said Hudson told him to ``do
anything you can for the kid, I may have killed him.''

<HEAD>Up To 30 Political Prisoners Held In Hospitals, Activists Claim</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANN IMSE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As many as 30 political prisoners are being held in
psychiatric hospitals despite claims by President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev that the Soviet Union no longer has political detainees,
activists say.
   The Soviet leader told the United Nations last month that ``no
persons convicted for their political or religious beliefs in places
of confinement'' are being held in his country.
   But the activists told a news conference in a cramped apartment
the names of three people they say are political prisoners in
psychiatric hospitals. Two other men at Wednesday's news conference
said they were former political prisoners and have been released in
the past six months.
   The U.S. State Department has credited the Soviets with
``significant progress'' in its treatment of political prisoners,
saying it has freed all those held under laws limiting expressions
of political and religious beliefs. But a U.S. official has said it
still has questions about 30 prisoners who are considered criminal
violators by the Soviets.
   A delegation of American psychiatrists is expected to arrive in
Moscow in late February to visit alleged political prisoners being
held in psychiatric hospitals, according to U.S. Embassy spokesman
Mike Hurley. He said the group expects to see about 20 patients.
   Alexander Novikov, 27, who said he was hospitalized as a
schizophrenic after distributing ``leaflets on democratic rights,''
said he personally met seven other political prisoners at the
Chernitovskaya Hospital near Leningrad, where he was held until
October. He said none seemed mentally disturbed to him.
   Through them, he said he learned of 20 political prisoners at
that institution alone.
   ``The doctors are sadists,'' said Novikov, whose complexion was
still white from his years of confinement. ``These hospitals don't
have a medical function, they have a criminal, punishment function.''
   ``And this is in the time of glasnost, perestroika and
democratization, in the time of Gorbachev,'' said activist Alexander
Podrabinik.
   Last year, Soviet officials announced that a new law made it
illegal to commit a patently healthy person to a psychiatric
institution.
   Valeri Senderov, who served several years in the Perm labor camp
for anti-Soviet propaganda, said ``hundreds of people are still
sitting in custody for political reasons.''
   Podrabinik said they believe 20 to 30 political prisoners remain
in the psychiatric hospitals, but he knows the names of only a few.
   The most recent to be imprisoned is Anatoly Ilchenko, sent to a
psychiatric hospital Dec. 23 in Nikolaev, near Odessa, he said.
   Ilchenko was working with a human rights group in the Ukraine
when he was called into a hospital allegedly to discuss his pension
benefits on Dec. 23, Podrabinik said.
   ``The doctor demanded the names of people he'd been meeting in
Odessa and Lvov, and said he was engaging in anti-Soviet
propaganda,'' Podrabinik said.
   Ilchenko was placed in a psychiatric institution, injected with
drugs, and remains there today, Podrabinik said.
   Ilchenko had been forced into a psychiatric hospital once before,
where electric shock treatments ``left him in terrible condition,''
said Podrabinik, who is a medical assistant by profession.
   Others political prisoners still held are Vladimir Vasiliev, who
has been imprisoned for more than a decade, and Vyatislav
Cherkassian, Podrabinik said.
   Cherkassian is a member of Pamyat, a right-wing extremist
organization that blames the Soviet Union's problems on Jews,
foreigners and Freemasons. Podrabinik said he had no wish to stand
up for the organization, but added, ``It is wrong that someone
should be hospitalized even for chauvinist ideas.''
   ``There have been cases where people were quite normal, and they
were turned into psychiatric cases by the pressure'' of the forced
treatment, Novikov said.
   Anatoly Makhinya said he was placed in a psychiatric hospital for
two years for publishing a philosophy manuscript in the underground
press. The 50-year-old man from the Krasnodar region said he was
transferred last summer from the mental institution to a regular
hospital, and released in October.

<TEXT>
   Thousands of copies of a fake front page of
The Arizona Daily Star declaring the United States at war in El
Salvador were placed in the newspaper's vending machines throughout
Tucson, authorities said.
   Police were investigating Wednesday's hoax, and Executive Editor
Steve Auslander said the morning newspaper would pursue a civil
complaint alleging copyright violation against anyone caught.
   Charges of misdemeanor theft of service and trespassing could be
brought against anyone involved, said police Lt. Brice Fuller.
   The mock front page contained a headline reading, ``U.S. at war
in El Salvador _ 70,000 killed.'' Another headline stating, ``Rebels
seize initiative in El Salvador,'' ran above stories condemning
Reagan administration policies toward the Central American country.
   The mockup used type faces and design resembling those of the
Star, but the phony front page was only about two-thirds the size of
the real one.
   No group was mentioned in the stories and no one called the Star
to claim responsibility, said Managing Editor John Peck.
   ``The content is a clear political bias,'' Peck said of the phony
stories. ``The ironic thing to me is that of the papers they could
have chosen in the state of Arizona, they happened to choose the one
paper which consistently does editorialize against ... the
administration's policies in Central and Latin America,'' he said.
   Larry Martin, circulation director for the publishing company
jointly owned by the parent companies of the Star and the evening
Tucson Citizen, estimated that 3,000 to 5,000 bogus copies were
placed in as many as 600 Star vending machines.
   The Star has a daily circulation of about 87,000.
   Martin said the fakes were inserted in the machines after 5 a.m.,
when newspaper employees finish delivering copies to the 1,150
machines in Tucson.
   ``We found them in machines virtually all over the city,'' Martin
said.
   He said some of the mockups were placed in stacks atop the real
newspapers and others were placed between individual newspapers.

   The commander of next month's
planned shuttle mission says he is confident the flight will prove
that NASA's manned space flight program is back on schedule and here
to stay.
   ``We're quite proud to be flying the third flight since the
(Challenger) accident,'' Navy Capt. Michael Coats said during the
final preflight news conference Wednesday.
   ``We're very anxious to show that we're back in space on a
routine, regular basis.''
   Flying with Coats will be pilot John Blaha and mission
specialists Robert Springer, James Buchli and James Bagian. Buchli
flew aboard Discovery in January 1983 and is the only other shuttle
veteran on the five-day mission scheduled to begin Feb. 23.
   The mission, Coats said, will initiate a busy year in which seven
shuttle flights are planned, including the first two designed to
dispatch probes to the planets _ Magellan to Venus in April and
Galileo to Jupiter in October.
   Discovery also flew on a mission last fall that was the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration's first since the Challenger
explosion of January 1986.
   The shuttle Atlantis was the next to fly. It returned last month
from a secret Department of Defense flight with severe damage to
about 200 of the 28,000 tiles that protect it from re-entry heat. It
was the worst tile damage ever sustained by a shuttle.
   Two small cracks also were found in a bearing unit within a
high-pressure engine turbopump during a post-flight inspection.
   But Coats, who flew aboard Discovery in August 1984, said
Wednesday he is certain both problems will be resolved in time to
meet the February launch.
   ``The engine problem is probably unique to that engine,'' Coats
said, adding that engineers are looking at Discovery's engines and
have spare turbopumps available.
   Engineers believe the cracks were caused by moisture that somehow
penetrated the housing around the bearing.
   Coats said it appeared that Atlantis' tiles were damaged during
liftoff by insulation falling off the nose cone of one of the solid
fuel booster rockets.
   ``But we're also reassured because despite all the damage
Atlantis' tiles took, it survived,'' he said. ``I have a lot of
confidence the tiles will see us home just fine.''
   Discovery's main objective is to deploy a sophisticated tracking
and data relay satellite. It completes a network that will allow
ground controllers to communicate with shuttle astronauts and other
unmanned satellites.
   Several scientific and medical experiments also will be conducted
during the mission, and the crew will use a powerful IMAX camera to
photograph damage to the planet caused by nature and man.
   Volcanoes in Nicaragua and Indonesia, deforestation in Brazil and
Madagascar, the Sahara desert in Africa and global beach erosion are
among the subjects to be photographed.
   Among the experiments planned are two student projects, including
one in which four rats will be used to determine how injured bones
heal in the weightlessness of space.
   ``The bone reparation process is an interesting question that has
to be answered before man takes extended space flights,'' said
Bagian, a medical doctor who will observe the rats in orbit.

<HEAD>Kentucky Town to Drop Theft Charge in Alleged Resume Scam</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PIKEVILLE, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The City Commission has voted to seek
dismissal of a theft charge against its former city manager because
he faces a stiffer charge in Alaska for using a bogus resume to get
a municipal job, officials said.
   Carl R.T. Keyser Jr., who is accused of using false resumes to
apply for city government jobs in four states, was arrested in
Alaska on Dec. 20 on a theft-by-deception charge filed in Kentucky.
   Keyser, 34, was fired the next day as city administrator in Kake,
Alaska, a job he had held since October. The Huntington, W.Va.,
native was charged last week with first-degree theft for allegedly
using a false resume to obtain $28,000 in salary, moving, travel and
other work-related expenses from the Alaska town.
   ``He's going to have some problems up there,'' Pikeville
Commissioner Greg Justice said Wednesday. ``They've already got
him.''
   Justice said the more serious charge in Alaska and the estimated
$30,000 cost of extradition persuaded the commission to unanimously
seek to drop the charge.
   A formal dismissal of the Kentucky charge was expected in a few
days, authorities said.
   Keyser resigned the Pikeville job in August after only six days
when reporters uncovered several apparently false entries on his
resume. He was indicted in October for allegedly failing to return
$697 in travel reimbursements.
   Keyser, who is jailed in Petersburg, Alaska, in lieu of $10,000
bond, has called the Alaska theft charge ``preposterous'' and said
he would have returned the money in Kentucky had he been asked.
   The Kake City Council hired Keyser based on glowing
recommendations from references on his impressive, four-page resume.
   The resume listed master's and bachelor's degrees in public
administration from La Salle University in Philadelphia, officials
said. He also listed experience as a consultant to the International
City Managers Association and the International Association of
Chiefs of Police, officials said.
   Officials say there is no record that Keyser attended the
university or worked for the associations. In October, the city
managers' group issued a warning about Keyser in its newsletter,
leading officials in Kake to investigate him.
   Kake officials also said they were unaware that Keyser pleaded
guilty in January 1988 to a misdemeanor perjury charge in Florida
stemming from alleged false information he provided while applying
for chief of police in Oak Hill, authorities said.
   The mayor of Port Royal, S.C., has said he reported Keyser to the
International City Managers Association after Keyser made an
allegedly false application there in September.

<HEAD>Judge Extends Window For Asylum-Seekers To Leave Southern Texas</HEAD>

   A judge granted asylum-seeking Central
Americans another three weeks to leave south Texas, bringing sighs
of relief for some of the hundreds trapped in desperate conditions
by an immigration policy.
   ``Now we can go and be a little more tranquil about when we
leave,'' said Jose Narvaez Romero, 34, of Nicaragua. Narvaez said he
hoped to leave for a cousin's home in Hollywood, Calif., on Friday.
   U.S. District Judge Filemon Vela on Wednesday postponed until
Jan. 31 a hearing in a lawsuit filed last week against the
Immigration and Naturalization Service.
   The hearing had been scheduled for today, when a temporary
restraining order Vela issued Monday against an INS policy was to
expire.
   The order restored asylum-seekers' right to travel to U.S.
destinations while their cases are resolved. They retain that right
until the rescheduled hearing.
   ``It will help some,'' said City Manager Steve Fitzgibbons,
adding that the crisis is not over for Texas' southernmost city.
   ``We have unofficial reports that there are 20,000 to 50,000
people still in the pipeline, on their way here,'' he said.
   The Red Cross is operating four shelters for Central Americans at
churches, and Fitzgibbons said they should be replaced by a single,
large center such as the local National Guard armory.
   The INS policy put into effect Dec. 16 required that asylum
seekers stay close to the application center nearest their point of
entry while their requests are considered.
   Asylum seekers unable to leave the area because of the policy
resorted to living in primitive camps, abandoned buildings and
church shelters.
   Many Central Americans enter the United States in southern Texas
and file their requests at the busy INS center in Harlingen, 25
miles northwest of Brownsville. Monday's order sparked an exodus,
and hundreds of asylum seekers swamped the Harlingen center to
ensure their applications would be processed by Thursday.
   The INS office processed 967 asylum applications Tuesday, a
one-day record, and 739 Wednesday, INS spokeswoman Virginia Kice
said in Harlingen.
   Ms. Kice said the agency had asked the judge to postpone the
hearing so it could prepare its defense.
   ``We will be ready to go'' by Jan. 31, she said. ``And we are
going to fight it all the way.''
   She said about 95 percent of the applicants ``are here for jobs,
not political asylum.''
   Mark Schneider, an attorney with the Harlingen-based Projecto
Libertad legal office and a co-counsel to the class-action lawsuit
against the INS, said the asylum seekers are ready for trial but
welcome the extended travel time.
   ``This should remedy the huge backlog of thousands of people
stuck in the (Rio Grande) valley, so I think we'll see a lot less of
the hardship and the crisis that we've seen in the past three
weeks,'' Schneider said.
   Bus companies added extra northbound runs Tuesday and Wednesday,
including a Greyhound Lines bus added Tuesday evening in which ``the
whole busload was going to Miami,'' said George Gravley, a Greyhound
spokesman in Dallas.
   Those remaining in Harlingen and Brownsville continued to receive
donations of food and clothing from the community.
   ``Whether you agree with everything that's been happening, or if
they're illegals, they're still hungry,'' said Bob Bush, who with
members of Harlingen's First Assembly of God dished out beans and
tortillas to Central Americans gathered at the INS office.
   Brownsville city officials Wednesday took more than 100 Central
Americans out of squalid conditions at the condemned Amber Motel and
bused them to church shelters.

<HEAD>Shipping Company Head Charged with Forgery In Libya Plant Shipments

<DATELINE>ANTWERP, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of an Antwerp shipping company
has been arrested in connection with the building of Libyan plant
the United States claims is a chemical arms factory, a justice
source said today.
   The source said Jozef Gedopt, director General of Cross Link, has
been charged with forging shipping documents. He is to be arraigned
Monday.
   ``We have found that there are grounds for prosecution,'' said
the source, who asked not to be named and declined to elaborate.
   Gedopt is charged with altering documents for the shipment by sea
of construction materials to Libya that were allegedly used to build
the plant at Rabta, 40 miles south of the Libyan capital of Tripoli.
   His arrest is part of a windening international probe into the
nature of the Rabta plant and the role played by West German and
other companies in its construction.
   Libya denies the plant can make chemical weapons, saying it was
built to produce pharmaceuticals.
   The United States has charged that five West German companies
helped Libya build the plant, notably Imhausen-Chemie of Lahr and
I.B.I. Engineering of Frankfurt.
   Gedopt was taken in for questioning Wednesday on his arrival at
the Brussels airport from Geneva and formally arrested Wednesday
night.
   According to news reports in Belgium and West Germany, he
allegedly alterted documents to hide the nature and destination of
cargo he shipped from Imhausen-Chemie to Libya.
   One shipment, in February, 1986, on the Wilhelm Schulte, a
Cypriot-registered freighter, listed Hong Kong as the final
destination but the freighter unloaded its cargo at Tripoli.
   Gedopt's arrest came just days after officials of the
investigation section of West Germany's customs service visited
Antwerp.

<HEAD>Nominee For Veterans Affairs Reportedly Endangered Spy's Life</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President-elect Bush's choice to run the
Department of Veterans Affairs once endangered a South Korean spy's
life by telling a South Korean official about the man's plan to
defect, a newspaper reported today.
   Edward Derwinski admitted telling a South Korean diplomat in a
1977 telephone call that the spy wanted to defect to the United
States, the Los Angeles Times said, citing unpublished records of a
1983 congressional hearing. Before the hearing, Derwinski had
publicly denied making such a call.
   The incident occurred during the ``Koreagate'' scandal involving
influence buying on Capitol Hill, the Times said.
   The spy, high-ranking Korean CIA official Sohn Ho Young, wanted
to defect because he was about to be transferred home from a post in
New York City, the newspaper said. U.S. officials wanted to
interview him regarding his government's involvement in the scandal.
   FBI agents arrived at Sohn's New Jersey home and escorted him to
safety only 30 minutes before KCIA agents showed up, an unidentified
senior law enforcement official told the Times.
   ``This guy, the Korean defector, would have been severely
punished or killed, as well as his family,'' the official said.
   Derwinski, a Republican from Chicago who served 24 years in
Congress, publicly denied 1978 allegations that he leaked the
information and refused to testify in the matter before a federal
grand jury and the House Ethics Committee.
   Derwinski, whose Washington experience includes nearly six years
at the State Department, refused to discuss the incident this week,
the Times said.
   Bill Anderson, a former Chicago newspaperman aiding Derwinski
during the transition, described the incident as ``an 11-year-old
story, a non-event.''
   ``He was not charged with any illegal or unethical conduct,''
Anderson said. ``That's the operative comment.''
   Derwinski's involvement in the episode and his early lack of
candor will be investigated during Senate confirmation hearings on
his nomination to head the new Veterans Department, said Sen. Alan
Cranston, D-Calif., chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans
Affairs.
   Sheila Tate, a spokeswoman for the Bush transition office, said,
``Any questions that arise will be answered by Mr. Derwinski at his
confirmation hearings.''
   The Times said U.S. officials learned of the leak and were able
to move Sohn because they recorded Derwinski's September 1977 phone
call to the South Korean embassy.
   Derwinski was the ranking Republican on the the House Foreign
Affairs subcommittee on international relations, which had secretly
been in touch with Sohn and planned to have him testify about the
KCIA's involvement in Koreagate, the Times said.
   Information about Sohn's plan to defect was so sensitive that
former Rep. Don Fraser, D-Minn., then-chairman of the subcommittee,
told only Derwinski, the newspaper said.
   Derwinski, now an undersecretary of state, belatedly admitted in
1983 that he leaked the information, the Times said. The admission
came in a closed meeting with senators just before he was confirmed
to his first State Department post in 1983.
   A transcript of the hearing, which was never printed or published
by the Senate but was found in the National Archives, shows that
Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., insisted on putting what Derwinski told
the panel into the public record.
   Pell said Derwinski's telephoned tip to the Korean Embassy was
``an error in judgment,'' the newspaper said.

<HEAD>West Germany Hit By Sharp Rise In Drug-Related Deaths, U.N. Report
Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VIOREL URMA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   International drug traffickers are moving
increasing quantities of illegal narcotics, threatening governments'
stability and contributing to a sharp rise in drug-related deaths, a
U.N. report said today.
   The 1988 annual report by the International Narcotics Control
Board, which last year warned that drug trafficking groups in Latin
America challenged state authorities, did not single out any region
for particular blame.
   ``Illicit production and manufacture of drugs take place in a
growing number of countries,'' the 31-page report says.
   ``These activities continue to be carried out by criminal
organizations ... which often join forces with terrorist groups,
spread violence and corruption, threaten political institutions,
undermine the integrity of national economies and imperil the very
security of countries,'' it said.
   In the United States, the report said the estimated quantities of
illicit drugs entering the country continued to rise, especially
cocaine.
   One bright spot cited in the report was a 1987 survey of U.S.
high school and college students that indicated drug-abuse declining
among that group. The survey found for the first time a 20 percent
decrease in cocaine use by high school and college students and
young adults.
   The Vienna-based board works with the World Health Organization
and other U.N. agencies. It said its report was based on data from
governments, the United Nations, Interpol and other international
organizations.
   Many countries provide information voluntarily.
   However, the report said that of the world's 185 countries and
territories, only 10 _ Angola, Bolivia, Brunei, Cambodia, North
Korea, Gambia, Israel, St. Lucia, Vietnam and Zambia _ declined to
provide drug-related data.
   ``During 1988, the gravity of the situation, which preoccupies
the highest levels of governments, has led to strong
counterattacks'' by governments, the report says. It singled out a
coordinated enforcement operation in August that featured 30
countries in the Americas and Western Europe.
   The effort led to the seizure of 12 tons of cocaine, dismantling
of 13 cocaine laboratories, destruction of seven clandestine
airstrips and arrest of at least 1,000 people, the report says.
   In another development, a U.N. conference last month ended a
four-year fight against illicit drug trafficking and drug abuse,
adopting a document giving all signatory countries the right to
extradite suspected drug traffickers and the right to confiscate all
their assets.
   But observers say the document, signed by 43 countries, may take
years to become legally binding.
   The report says drug-related deaths increased sharply during 1987
and the first three months of 1988, with heroin the main killer.
   It singled out West Germany, where 1,362 people died during that
period, compared with 606 who died in 1986 and the first three
months of 1987.
   The report also noted:
   _ Opium production in southeast Asia remains high despite
campaigns to eradicate opium poppy cultivation. Abundant opium,
together with the availability of essential chemicals, facilitate
heroin production in clandestine laboratories near the borders of
Burma, Laos and Thailand.
   _ Transit trafficking of opium and heroin was reported to
continue unabated in Iran, despite vigorous law enforcement backed
by severe penalties.
   _ In the Soviet Union, health and law enforcement authorities
have expanded activities aimed at eliminating the abuse of certain
drugs and mind-altering substances. Stricter laws have been enacted
to prosecute traffickers, and serious drug offenses can draw up to
10 years in jail.

<HEAD>Boy Scouts Call Reduced Award in Molestation a Victory</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FAIRFAX, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A jury ordered the local scouting council to
pay $45,000 to a youth because he was sexually molested by his
former scoutmaster but rejected the boy's $10 million claim against
the national Boy Scouts of America.
   The Boy Scouts called the decision a vindication of their
treatment of the complaint and of the scouts' supervision of local
councils that hire scoutmasters.
   The Fairfax County Circuit Court jury had deliberated for five
days after a six-week trial before deciding Wednesday that former
scoutmaster Carlton L. Bittenbender, a convicted pedophile, had
molested the youth.
   Jurors agreed with scout attorneys, however, that the Washington,
D.C., area council was liable for selecting Bittenbender.
   The youth, identified in court papers as ``Infant C,'' is now 17
and claimed he was molested by Bittenbender over a 10-month period
in 1984.
   The youth's lawyers claimed the scouts were negligent in choosing
Bittenbender to lead Troop 1970 because he had pleaded guilty to a
molestation charge while a scoutmaster in Rhode Island three years
before.
   The introduced confidential scout files hoping to prove that the
organization wouldn't act against pedophiles within its ranks
because of the fear of bad publicity.
   ``We're very pleased with the outcome,'' said Frank Hebb,
director of public relations for the national Boy Scouts of America.
   ``The evidence at the trial clearly demonstrated that scouting is
a local activity and that parents, neighbors and fellow members are
the people best suited to select scouting membership,'' Hebb said in
a statement.
   The youth's lawyer, Douglas B. Wessel, called the damages award
``grossly inadequate'' and said he will ask presiding Judge Richard
J. Jamborsky to overrule the jury's decision at a hearing Jan. 27.
   The damages does not cover the $58,907 in medical expenses the
youth has incurred, according to testimony presented at the trial.
   ``How this boy could have suffered $45,000 worth of damages, I
simply don't understand. ... This boy deserves better than this,''
he said.
   The teen and his family initially sought $30 million from the
scouts and Bittenbender. But the amount was reduced during the trial
to $10 million and the judge dismissed Bittenbender from the suit,
ruling the man's actions were intentional and so not negligent.

<HEAD>West German Convicted in Illegal Chemical Shipment Forfeits Bond</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A West German convicted of illegally arranging
the shipment of a solvent used in chemical warfare from the United
States to Iran forfeited his $350,000 bond and fled the country, The
Sun reported today.
   Peter Walaschek, a representative of a German chemical company,
did not return Dec. 1 to a Washington halfway house, where he was
ordered to live while awaiting sentencing, the newspaper said,
citing court papers.
   Walaschek left the house that day for a volunteer job, and never
returned. The next day, he called his American attorney and told him
he was in West Germany, the documents said.
   Walaschek did not appear for his scheduled sentencing Dec. 20.
   At the request of federal prosecutors Monday, U.S. District Judge
Walter E. Black Jr., who presided over the case, ordered the
forfeiture of $100,000 in cash Walaschek posted on the $350,000 bond
and the seizure of an additional $250,000 he had on deposit in a
Washington bank.
   Federal officials refused to comment on what was being done to
retrieve Walschek from West Germany and on whether anyone else was
under investigation, the Sun said.
   The United States has charged that West Germany companies helped
Libya build a suspected chemical weapons plant.
   Larry Ceppos, Walaschek's attorney in Rockville, declined to
comment Wednesday, citing his client's request he not discuss the
matter.
   Walaschek, who faces up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000
fine, was arrested Aug. 1 on a charge he arranged the shipment of
thiodiglycol from Alcolac International Inc. in Baltimore to Iran
via Pakistan and Singapore. He None of those countries is allowed to
receive the chemical without first obtaining special permission from
the Department of Commerce, according to court records in Baltimore
and St. Louis.
   The export of thiodiglycol is restricted because it can be used
to manufacture mustard gas, a deadly poison first used during World
War I.
   Both Iran and Iraq were accused of using chemical weapons during
their eight-year war.
   On Aug. 26, Walschek, an employee of Chemco Gmbh &amp; Co., pleaded
guilty to one count of illegally shipping thiodiglycol to
non-approved countries, and was sent to the halfway house.
   Alcolac said in a statement that it had been erroneously informed
by the Commerce Department that no special permission was required
for shipments of thiodiglycol to Singapore.
   The company said ``it had no knowledge of the alleged effort to
divert the chemical from Singapore, had voluntarily taken
precautions to guard against this sort of thing and had relied upon
assurances from U.S. agencies that the company was complying with
regulations.''
   That assertion, however, was contradicted in a 14-page affidavit
detailing the scheme which the Customs Service filed in St. Louis in
September.

   A plan to clean this city's notoriously filthy
air by planting millions of trees and curtailing driving could help
counter the greenhouse effect if copied by other urban areas, an
environmentalist said.
   ``If we're going to address this problem it will be a grass-roots
effort by activists throughout the cities of the world,'' said
Jeremy Rifkin, director of the Foundation on Economic Trends and a
member of the Global Greenhouse Network, a coalition of
environmental activists in 35 countries.
   In response to federal pressure to reduce smog and local anxiety
about growth and traffic congestion, Mayor Tom Bradley recently
proposed planting 2 million to 5 million trees throughout the city
during the next five years, encouraging the use of public transport
and ride-sharing, and weaning industries away from fossil fuels that
generate high levels of carbon dioxide.
   The 63-point proposal represents the first urban effort to curb
the worldwide greenhouse effect, said Rifkin, who joined the mayor
at a City Hall news conference Wednesday. Bradley said he would ask
mayors of cities throughout the world to emulate the plan.
   ``This landmark project, initiated in a major American
metropolis, will focus on the urban areas throughout the world,''
Rifkin said.
   ``It is vital for the future of the planet that we begin to
sharply reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases that
contribute to the greenhouse effect.''
   The greenhouse effect is a term used by scientists to describe a
potential warming of the Earth's temperature by pollution and carbon
dioxide that trap solar radiation in the atmosphere. Many scientists
fear it could cause the planet's temperature to raise several
degrees, melting polar ice, raising sea levels and flooding coastal
cities and possibly disrupting agriculture.
   Rifkin said the most dramatic element of the plan is the proposed
planting of trees, which absorb carbon dioxide and produce
life-giving oxygen.
   ``Up to 5 million trees planted in the right places in Southern
California will conserve the energy equivalent of one to two new
power plants,'' said Andy Lipkis, executive director of TreePeople,
a conservation and community-action group that is organizing the
planting campaign.
   The city has donated $25,000 of an estimated $100,000 needed to
organize the planting, which probably will cost several million
dollars, Lipkis said.
   Among the specific recommendations of the plan, which Bradley
unveiled Jan. 4, are mandatory parking fees at shopping malls,
replacing the city's cars and trucks with newer models that get
better mileage and establishing tax incentives for home energy
conservation.

   Israeli warplanes today rocketed bases of
Palestinian terrorist Abu Nidal outside this southern port for the
second time in 13 hours and police reported an undetermined number
of casualties.
   Two Israeli jets roared in at 10:05 a.m. to attack camps
belonging to Abu Nidal's Fatah-Revolutionary Council in Majdalyoun
Valley, four miles east of Sidon.
   Israeli military authorities said the bases served as a planning
and staging areas for terrorist attacks.
   The Fatah-Revolutionary Council, an extremist PLO splinter group,
has been blamed for terrorist attacks against Israel and Western
European countries, most notably the Rome and Vienna airport
massacres of December 1985.
   A police spokesman said the two Israeli jets in today's raid
fired four rockets ``in a few seconds and flew away west toward the
Mediterranean.'' The spokesman, who cannot be identified under
standing rules, said smoke billowed from the valley.
   Fatah guerrillas at first turned away ambulances dispatched from
Sidon, claiming there were no casualties.
   But the police spokesman said the ambulances later were allowed
into Majdalyoun Valley and returned with sirens wailing. He said
they took an undisclosed number of casualties to a Fatah clinic in
the Druse-controlled Chouf mountains northeast of Sidon.
   ``These people (Fatah) are clever in hiding their losses. It is
very difficult to estimate their casualties,'' the spokesman said.
   Fatah guerrillas opened up at the raiding jets from twin-barreled
anti-aircraft guns, but no hits were observed, he said.
   In Israel, the army said in a statement that the bombing followed
an earlier raid at 9 p.m. Wednesday. It did not say if the target
was destroyed, but said the Israeli warplanes had returned safely
from both raids.
   The attacks were the first two Israeli air raids on guerrilla
targets in Lebanon this year. According to a police count, 128
people were killed and 356 wounded in 25 Israeli air raids on
Lebanon in 1988.
   Abu Nidal, whose real name is Sabri al-Banna, broke away from PLO
chief Yasser Arafat's mainstream Fatah guerrilla group in 1974 and
formed his faction two years later. He is the most wanted
Palestinian terrorist in the United States and western Europe.
   Fatah opposes Arafat's explicit recognition of Israel and the
Palestine Liberation Organization dialogue with the United States.

   A man seeking to be mayor of racially
divided Yonkers said nearly all blacks lived well under slavery and
made other comments that brought denunciations from political
leaders, who called the remarks ignorant and inflammatory.
   John Casaburro, who is seeking the Republican and Conservative
nominations for mayor of the city just north of New York City, made
the remarks at a Yonkers City Council meeting Tuesday night.
   Casaburro said ``90 percent of all blacks lived well and had it
good'' under slavery.
   ``They're no longer in the back of the bus. Now they're slaves to
the bus,'' he said later. ``Now they're spending two hours a day
just to go to school. Not a school of their choice, but a school
based on racial quotas.
   ``Most black men are encouraged not to marry a woman,'' he added.
``They're encouraged to impregnate, not marry her, because it's
almost an irresponsibility to get married since welfare will take
care of her.''
   Mayor Nicholas Wasicsko, a Democrat seeking a second term in the
November election, on Wednesday called Casaburro's remarks
``extremely unfortunate. He's not typical of the sentiment of the
city.''
   Such comments ``do absolutely no good,'' said Westchester County
Executive Andrew O'Rourke. ``They're inflammatory. There's no basis
in fact.''
   Racial relations are already strained in Yonkers due to
opposition to a court-ordered housing desegregation plan.
   Faced with bankrupting fines imposed by a federal judge, the
council reversed itself Sept. 10 and agreed to support the judge's
order to affordable housing to remedy what the judge determined was
deliberate segregation.
   Casaburro has campaigned as a member of the Save Yonkers
Federation, a citizen's group which has sued to stop the
desegregation plan.
   However, federation President Jack O'Toole said Casaburro was
neither an official nor a committee member for the association.

<HEAD>Mubarak Calls On Shamir to Accept International Peace Conference</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Hosni Mubarak today urged Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir of Israel to agree to an international
Middle East peace conference and said he won't visit Israel until
that happens.
   ``All countries of the world except Israel'' have accepted such
an international conference as the proper framework for Arab-Israeli
peace talks, Mubarak said. A conference, under U.N. auspices, would
bring together concerned parties and the five permanent members of
the U.N. Security Council.
   Egypt and the Palestine Liberation Organization say the
conference should lead to direct Arab-Israeli talks.
   Mubarak discussed the conference and other matters at a news
conference following a private meeting with Austrian Chancellor
Franz Vranitzky.
   Mubarak told reporters he plans to discuss peace and other
regional problems when he visits Washington after President-elect
George Bush takes office on Jan. 20. Mubarek didn't say when he will
go, but political adviser Osama el-Baz says the visit is expected in
the first half of this year.
   ``I have known Bush as vice president. We used to exchange views
on Middle East problems,'' Mubarak said. ``We understand each other
well.''
   Mubarak noted that Shamir has repeatedly rejected a peace
conference, believing that Israel would be forced to make
territorial concessions by countries who are biased against Israel.
   ``I believe world opinion fully agrees to an international
conference and I appeal to Mr. Shamir to respond to the voice of
peace that is backed by world opinion,'' Mubarak said.
   Asked about prospects of his visiting Israel, Mubarak replied:
   ``I have said it repeatedly before, and I sent a message
accordingly to Mr. Shamir: if my visit to Israel will lead to good
progress in (solving) the Middle East problem, then I am ready to go.
   ``I cannot visit Israel particularly after Mr. Shamir announced
he will not make territorial concessions and does not accept an
international peace conference. He is not giving something in return
or (paying) a price for my visit, and we will not go there to have
tea and coffee or to have a good time.'' A visit ``must achieve
something tangible'' in furthering efforts for an Arab-Israeli
settlement, Mubarak said.
   Shamir has refused to relinquish any Arab territory his forces
presently occupy: the West Bank, the Gaza Strip and the Golan
Heights, all seized in the 1967 Middle East war.
   Egypt and Israel signed a peace treaty in 1979 and established
diplomatic relations, but Mubarak has not visited Israel since
taking office in 1981.

<HEAD>Geologists Discover `Inactive' Fault Under SRP</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A long-dormant geological fault discovered
under the Savannah River nuclear weapons complex will not affect the
restart of the site's three reactors, says a Department of Energy
official.
   ``We see nothing right now that would make any difference,'' said
Steve Wright, who directs DOE environmental studies at the SRP.
   The department and the Du Pont Co., which operates the facility,
on Wednesday announced the discovery of the fault, a fracture or
zone of fractures in rock strata where pressure and displacement can
cause earthquakes.
   Geologists believe that the fault _ the most significant ever
found at the complex _ is no longer active and that its last
movement probably occurred about 30 million years ago, the
department said.
   The Pen Branch Fault runs within a half-mile of the K-Reactor,
which the department hopes will be the first restarted this year
after repairs, and the site of a reactor that is expected to be
built beginning in 1991 or 1992, Wright said.
   The two other reactors are several miles from the fault, he said.
   All three reactors have been shut down since August because of
safety concerns, and the idling of the nation's only active
tritium-producing reactors has made the Pentagon concerned about the
supply of tritium, which is used in bombs.
   The radioactive material decays at a rate of 5.5 percent a year,
which means that it must be replenished periodically.
   A geology professor at the University of South Carolina said the
fault, which is about 300 meters deep at its lowest point, isn't
likely to produce an earthquake of any significance.
   ``These are extremely shallow faults,'' said Pradeep Talwani.
``(They) just don't have the energy to have a large earthquake.''
   In 1886, one of the most powerful earthquakes ever recorded in
North America flattened much of Charleston, more than 100 miles to
the east.
   The fault extends across the site in a northeast-southwest
direction for about 20 miles and is probably part of a set of other
faults that run parallel with it, geologists said. It runs almost
parallel to a previously known fault.
   Scientists plan to drill more wells and excavate trenches to
learn more about the fault, including its history and magnitude.
   The preliminary report will be submitted to the Bulletin of the
Geological Society of America for publication later this year,
following peer review.
   Wright said that preliminary findings are seldom released before
peer and official reviews but that DOE and Du Pont realized the
public has a strong interest in discovery ``regardless of whether
(the fault) is active or not.''
   A full study by an SRP Seismic Review Committee is expected to
take two to three years. The panel includes experts from the U.S.
Geological Survey, Virginia Polytechnic Institute, the University of
South Carolina and Stanford University.

<TEXT>
   U.S. prosecutors pressured Japan's wartime prime
minister, Gen. Hideki Tojo, into changing testimony at his trial to
avoid incriminating Emperor Hirohito in war crimes, a television
documentary claims.
   The British Broadcasting Corp. documentary, details of which were
released Wednesday by its maker Edward Behr, said the U.S.
prosecutors worked with the emperor's aides to find a way to avoid
putting Hirohito on trial.
   The documentary challenges Hirohito's image as a peaceful man
forced to go along with his generals' plans and alleges among other
things that he:
   _Must have known about the massacre of at least 20,000 Chinese at
Nanking in 1937 because he received regular detailed reports from
the China front.
   _Knew more than a month in advance of Japanese plans to attack
the U.S. navy at Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941.
   The BBC will show ``Hirohito _ Behind the Myth'' on Jan. 24.
   Behr is a Paris-based journalist. His biography of China's last
monarch was used for the award-winning film ``The Last Emperor.''
   It has been reported previously that American prosecutors wanted
to keep Hirohito out of the war crimes trial and asked Tojo to
suggest the emperor had consented reluctantly to the war on the
advice of the High Command.
   Gen. Douglas MacArthur, commander of the U.S. forces occupying
Japan, wrote in his book ``Reminiscences'' that he fended off
pressure from Britain and the Soviet Union to indict Hirohito,
arguing that would touch off a guerrilla war.
   Behr told The Associated Press in a telephone interview Wednesday
that the documentary will be shown in the United States by PBS on
March 13.
   The BBC has also sold it to Australia, Austria, Canada, Hong
Kong, Israel, Korea, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain and Sweden.
   Hirohito died Saturday at the age of 87.
   The documentary says the decision not to prosecute Hirohito came
from President Harry S. Truman and that Tojo's evidence was altered
so the emperor would not be incriminated.

   The Soviet Union says it will try to maintain its
minuscule AIDS rate by screening foreigners for the deadly virus,
even forcing mandatory tests of some visitors who cannot provide
proper medical proof.
   Foreigners who want to stay in the country for three months or
more will be subject to testing for the disease beginning next
month, Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov said.
   ``Here, there cannot be any discrimination,'' Gerasimov said.
``We conduct tests of our own people and besides, statistics show
the Soviet Union is sharply lagging behind other countries, say the
United States, in the number of ill people (with AIDS). And we just
don't want to catch up.''
   The Soviets once regarded AIDS as a disease spawned by Western
sexual depravity and drug use. One Soviet newspaper's account had
even claimed the virus was the result of a U.S. biological warfare
experiment gone haywire.
   Gerasimov said the regulations were introduced to supplement a
1987 decree of the Soviet Council of Ministers.
   That decree made it a crime to knowingly spread AIDS, punishable
by up to eight years' imprisonment, and said anyone in the Soviet
Union could be forced to take a test to determine whether they were
carriers.
   According to Gerasimov, the new rules go into effect Feb. 1.
Summarizing them at a news briefing Wednesday, he said: ``Foreigners
coming into the Soviet Union for over three months, if they don't
have certificates which would be mutually accepted by agreement,
should be screened.''
   As outlined by Gerasimov, the new regulations on testing for AIDS
antibodies appear to exempt short-term tourists but to apply to all
foreigners _ diplomats, students, business people and journalists _
who live in the Soviet Union.
   As of late 1988, Gerasimov said, AIDS testsof 17 million people
in the Soviet Union had turned up 112 Soviets who carry the virus,
as opposed to 334 foreigners residing in the country.
   Eight people have the disease, five foreigners and three Soviets,
he said.
   ``We do not want this kind of import,'' Gerasimov said. ``I don't
want to say foreigners are a risk group. But we don't take any
chances.''
   Gerasimov said a traveler who tests AIDS-positive may be asked to
leave the country.
   ``People who try to avoid medical examination or treatment may be
expelled from the Soviet Union, following a prosecutor's sanction,''
he said.
   Soviet doctors customarily use hypodermic needles that are then
boiled to sterilize them for re-use, but Gerasimov told one
inquiring foreign reporter: ``Don't worry, we'll do our best so that
you will have single-use needles.''
   Stephen Walker, U.S. vice consul in Moscow, said Gerasimov's
announcement was the first indication he'd had from Soviet officials
that U.S. residents in Moscow would have to prove they were
AIDS-free.
   The U.S. community in Moscow numbers about 800, Walker said.
   Rick Kenney, public affairs specialist for the U.S. Immigration
and Naturalization Service, said that since the autumn of 1987 AIDS
has been on the list of contagious diseases which require a
rejection of an application for a U.S. visa.
   Pravda reported Nov. 11 that the Soviet Union had concluded
agreements with Britain, Denmark and its East bloc allies that
require their nationals seeking to enter the Soviet Union to prove
they are not AIDS carriers. It did not say whether the regulation
was already in effect.
   Gerasimov said the ``overwhelming majority'' of foreigners
diagnosed as AIDS carriers had left the Soviet Union. The state-run
press has previously reported the departure of African students
found to be infected with the virus.
   Last year, the official Tass news agency reported the first
Soviet AIDS deaths: a 4-month-old baby from the Odessa region on the
Black Sea, apparently infected by its mother, and a 29-year-old
Leningrad prostitute.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by a virus that
damages the body's immune system, leaving victims extremely
susceptible to infections and cancer. It is spread most often
through sexual contact, shared hypodermic needles, transfusion of
infected blood and from pregnant women to their offspring.

<TEXT>
   The only film critic in town, a free-lancer
who refuses to write about R-rated pictures, has been barred from
this desert hamlet's lone theater because of her negative reviews.
   Cathy Monnett, who writes for the twice-weekly Palo Verde Valley
Times, was handed her admission fee back during a recent screening
of ``Gorillas in the Mist'' and asked to leave the Blythe Cinema.
   ``People were staying away from the theater because of her
reviews,'' Don Davis, the owner's brother and an attorney for the
theater, said in today's Los Angeles Times. ``The feeling inside the
theater, whether right or wrong, was that her criticism was not
evenly balanced.''
   Ms. Monnett argued that her reviews of family-oriented films are
largely positive, and she vowed not to be silenced.
   The 29-year-old wife of an elementary school teacher, who gets $8
for each review, said she will cross into Arizona and make the
90-mile desert drive to Yuma, site of the next-closest theater, to
see the same films showing at the Blythe.
   ``I'm incensed,'' Ms. Monnett said. ``By driving to Yuma I'm
telling them they can't stop me from writing reviews.''
   The drama in this town of 8,400 residents situated about 220
miles east of Los Angeles has prompted angry editorials by the
4,500-circulation newspaper and picketing outside the 600-seat
theater at the paper's urging.
   The critic said the ban was unfounded. ``Of the 28 reviews I have
written, 17 have been positive,'' she said.
   ``That's a pretty good percentage,'' mused David Anson, a movie
reviewer for Newsweek magazine. ``I don't think any of us would
survive in Blythe.''
   Blythe co-owner Paul Davis, whose theater doesn't advertise in
the newspaper, has called Monnett a dilettante with no credentials
to review films.
   ``Were her distorted, negative and unfair criticism harmless,''
he said in a letter to the editor, ``we could perhaps ignore her,
and chuck it off to a small-town mind that dabbles in writing
newspaper articles.''

   President-elect Bush is rounding out the top
ranks of his administration by nominating retired Adm. James D.
Watkins as energy secretary and former Education Secretary William
J. Bennett as drug czar, transition and congressional sources said
today.
   Bush was to announce the selections at a news conference a few
hours before holding a late-afternoon dress-rehearsal meeting of his
Cabinet at Blair House, the historic residence across from the White
House.
   ``He will talk about what he expects of them, what his priorities
are, what's important,'' Sheila Tate, Bush's transition press
secretary, said of the first gathering of the president-elect's top
appointees.
   Sources who declined to be identified confirmed that Watkins,
formerly the Navy's top uniformed officer, would be tapped for the
energy post and that Bennett would get the job of coordinating the
government's war on drugs.
   CBS News first reported on Watkins' selection and The New York
Times had disclosed Bennett's new role.
   Bush had a hard time filling both jobs, the last top-level posts
that were vacant. Aides suggested that he vacillated on the energy
post between an oil-state candidate and one with experience in
nuclear energy. The Energy Department faces a multibillion-dollar
cleanup of the nation's aging and increasingly unsafe nuclear
weapons plants.
   Watkins, who was a nuclear submarine commander before becoming
chief of naval operations, is considered an authority on nuclear
warfare.
   Other contenders for the energy job were identified by Bush
transition sources as former defense secretary Harold Brown and
former Sen. Daniel J. Evans, R-Wash. Another contender, former
Louisiana Rep. Henson Moore, was told he was no longer being
considered, transition sources said Wednesday.
   Along with Bennett, Surgeon General C. Everett Koop and Texas
industrialist Ross Perot had been mentioned previously as
prospective drug czars.
   Today's gathering of top officials in the incoming administration
was designed to ``give the president-elect and his senior staff the
opportunity to share how they see the first week of the
administration,'' said Bush spokeswoman Alixe Glen.
   Ms. Glen also said Bush will sign an executive order immediately
after he is sworn in next week setting up a panel to review ethics
for government appointees.
   The advisory commission will be co-chaired by Griffin Bell, the
former attorney general in the Carter administration, and Malcolm
Wilkey, a senior judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals here, she said.
   On Wednesday, Bush defended his decision to attend Japanese
Emperor Hirohito's funeral next month, saying he was ``doing what's
right.''
   The decision has been criticized by veterans and others who
resent Hirohito's role in World War II.
   A former Navy aviator whose plane was shot down by the Japanese
in the Pacific in 1944, Bush said, ``I speak from a pretty good
vantage point.''
   ``We have a good relationship with Japan. I want to see it even
better, and this doesn't concern me a bit. And you're talking to a
person who was in combat in World War II,'' he said.
   ``I feel you always look ahead, not always look back.''
   Also Wednesday, Roger B. Porter, a Harvard University government
and business professor, was announced as Bush's chief domestic
policy adviser.
   Porter, 42, was a White House adviser in President Reagan's first
term and also worked as an assistant to former President Ford. He is
a professor of business and government at Harvard.
   Other announcements included:
   _Stephen M. Studdert, a former Bush campaign aide and the
director of Bush's inaugural committee, as assistant to the
president for special activities and initiatives.
   _Richard Breeden, a Washington lawyer and former vice
presidential aide, as assistant for issues analysis.
   _John P. Schmitz as deputy counsel, the same job he has held in
Bush's vice presidential office.
   _B. Jay Cooper, Stephen Hart and Ms. Glen, as deputy press
secretaries. Cooper has been a deputy press secretary in the Reagan
White House, while Hart was Bush's vice presidential spokesman and
Ms. Glen served in a similar capacity in Bush's transition office.

<HEAD>British Official Says Gadhafi Most Dangerous Backer of IRA</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi is ``the most
dangerous'' backer of the Irish Republican Army, which he has
supplied with many advanced weapons and plastic explosives, a senior
British leader said today.
   Home Secretary Douglas Hurd also said Gadhafi has supplied the
IRA with a plastic explosive called Semtex. British Transport
Secretary Paul Channon has said the Czechoslovakian-made material
was probably used in the bombing of the Pan American jumbo jet over
Scotland last month in which 270 were killed.
   Authorities say they do not yet know who planted that bomb or
why, and Hurd did not make any reference to the Pan Am disaster in
his speech to a Rome military academy.
   ``A significant portion of the explosives and weapons held by a
few hundred active (IRA) terrorists are shipped from Libya,'' Hurd
said.
   ``Gadhafi is without doubt the most dangerous of the PIRA
supporters,'' he added, referring to the dominant wing of the IRA.
``We have proof that he has supplied them with tons of sophisticated
weapons and large quantities of Semtex explosives.''
   ``He has also provided them with ample funds and as recently as
September reiterated his political support for them,'' said Hurd.
   British officials previously have said Libyan-supplied Semtex
probably reached the IRA in three shipments that arrived in the
Irish Republic in 1985 and 1986.
   The Irish government, unlike the British, has never pointed a
finger directly at the Libyans, although it says it has told Tripoli
that it condemns the IRA and doesn't want Libya to support the group.
   The predominantly Catholic IRA is fighting to end British rule in
Northern Ireland and unite the 60 percent Protestant province with
the Irish Republic.

   A Navy fighter jet on a training mission
accidentally dropped a three-foot practice bomb, digging a foot-deep
crater in a family's back yard but causing no injuries, officials
said.
   The eight-pound bomb had a detonator charge, similar to a shotgun
shell, that emits smoke when it hits the ground, said Bert Byers,
spokesman for Cecil Field Naval Air Station.
   A Navy team removed the bomb from William Larsen's back yard, 113
feet from his home. Larsen was alone at the time but said if it had
been 20 minutes later, his children and their friends would have

   A man who bilked investors into sinking $2.4
million into a bogus self-chilling beverage container drew 12 years
in prison despite his lawyer's insistence he was only a terrified
``franchise'' for the mob.
   Marshall Zolp, 42, was bullied by mobsters into carrying out the
fraud, defense attorney Raymond Sussman said Wednesday.
   But U.S. District Judge Alfred Lechner Jr. told Zolp: ``Your
conduct has been your character. You are a con man.''
   Zolp, who could have received 20 years in prison, pleaded guilty
in 1987 to racketeering. Five others were convicted in the scheme to
promote a phony self-chilling can.
   Zolp and his co-defendants promoted Laser Arms, incorporated in
1986, through fake news releases, ads, and shareholder reports. They
staged a phony news conference and prepared company documents with
photos of actors portraying executives.
   As part of a plea agreement, Zolp has been providing information
on organized-crime involvement in securities manipulation, said
Sussman and Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert P. Warren. Indictments
are expected, authorities said.
   Warren said Zolp was used as a ``vehicle'' by mobsters and was
``viewed by a number of people as a person they could franchise to
make money for them.''
   Sussman agreed with the term franchise but said that mobsters
beat Zolp and threatened him to continue carrying out the Laser Arms
fraud. Zolp, who was living in the Los Angeles area, is in the
witness protection program.
   The Securities and Exchange Commission has implicated Zolp in at
least seven securities fraud cases nationwide since the early 1980s,
authorities said.
   Sussman said that despite a ``track record'' of securities
violations, Zolp never meant to perpetrate such an extended fraud as
Laser Arms.
   At one point, Sussman said, mobsters kidnapped Zolp, held a gun
to his side, said he was to be murdered and beat him.

   Police arrested 10 Spanish Basque
militants, including Jose Antonio Urutigoechea, considered by Madrid
to be a top leader of the Spanish Basque separatist organization
ETA, authorities said today.
   Spanish officials, party leaders, and newspapers applauded the
arrest of Urutigoechea, 38, also known as ``Josu Ternera.''
   Spain's leading daily, El Pais, said the arrest means ``ETA has
lost its staunchest, longest-active leader, suffering the toughest
blow.''
   ETA has carried out a 20-year campaign of violence in a bid to
secure independence from Spain for the three-province northern
Spanish Basque region. It maintains bases across the border in
French Basque country.
   In Madrid, Interior Ministry sources speaking on condition of
anonymity said the arrests represented the most important setback to
ETA since police in southwestern France arrested dozens of suspects
in raids on Sept. 30, 1987.
   Urutigoechea and the others were arrested Wednesday in the cities
of Bayonee and Bonloc in southwestern France in Poitiers in
west-central France.
   A police spokeman said on condition of anonymity that authorities
arrested Urutigoechea as he was driving a motorcyle down a towpath
along the Nive River just outside Bayonne. He did not resist, even
though he was armed with a pistol and a grenade, police said. Police
said they arrested two others at a house he had just left, six in
Poitier and one in Bonloc.
   There was no immediate word on whether criminal charges would be
filed against the 10 or whether they would be extradited to Spain.
   Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez of Spain told reporters, ``The
police actions and the arrests are of great importance to Spanish
society on such a major matter as the battle against terrorism.''
   Since taking up arms in 1968, ETA has claimed responsibility for
killing more than 600 people, mainly Spanish security and military
forces.
   The arrests came four days after ETA declared a 15-day suspension
of attacks in Spain as a sign of good faith to persuade the Madrid
government to open talks on the Spanish Basque region.
   Authorities in France and Spain said the arrests were carried out
through close cooperation on both sides of the border.

   Angry settlers shouted down
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir today and demanded that the government
do more to quell the Palestinian uprising.
   In the West Bank town of Tulkarem, troops shot and killed an
11-year-old Palestinian during clashes following the funeral of a
Palestinian teen-ager who died of wounds suffered earlier, Arab
doctors said.
   The army confirmed both deaths.
   Shamir, who spoke at a mourning ceremony in Brakha for a slain
Jewish settler, was confronted by a crowd of 200 settlers.
   They screamed demands that he put an end to attacks on Jews by
Palestinians and chanted: ``You are doing nothing.''
   Shamir told the settlers that the greatest danger to Israel was
dissension among Jews. ``One thing only can hurt our ability to
stand firm: quarrels among brothers, or worse civil war among
them,'' he said.
   Elsewhere in the West Bank, troops broke up a sit-in by hundreds
of Jewish settlers near the settlement of Yakir who also demanded
the army crack down harder on Palestinians involved in the
13-month-old uprising.
   The army set up roadblocks throughout the area to prevent more
settlers from reaching the site where the sit-in began Wednesday but
dozens broke through one roadblock and were chased by troops, Israel
army radio said.
   Also today, 18-year-old Nasser Mohammed Salah Irut of the West
Bank city of Nablus was shot in the head and critically wounded by
Palestinians who accused him of collaborating with Israel, Arab
doctors said.
   In Hebron, troops wounded three Palestinians in a clash with
stone-throwers, the army said. Palestinian reports said the
confrontation began after settlers opened fire on a Palestinian
youth who stoned their car.
   In east Jerusalem, the army imposed a curfew on the Silwan
neighborhood and arrested Arab residents according to prepared
lists, police said.
   Jerusalem police commander Yosef Yehudai said on Israel radio
that the action was the start of a new policy of imposing curfews on
Jerusalem neighborhoods to quell disturbances.
   Curfews are frequently imposed in the occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip, but rarely used in Jerusalem, which Israel considers its
capital.
   In Tulkarem, Abdul Ahmed Abdul Salam, 11, died of a bullet wound
to the chest during a clash in which hundreds of Palestinians hurled
rocks and burned tires to protest the death of another Tulkarem
youth hours earlier, Arab doctors said.
   Three other Tulkarem residents were in critical condition after
being shot in the clash, hospital officials said. Troops imposed a
curfew on the city and a nearby refugee camp.
   The clashes were caused by news of the death of 17-year-old
Marwan El Maddeni of Tulkarem, who died at east Jerusalem's Mukassed
Hospital after being shot in the head in a Jan. 1 clash.
   Residents called a general strike following Maddeni's death and
raised outlawed Palestinian flags and black flags of mourning, the
Arab reports said. Hundreds of students poured into the streets upon
hearing news of the death.
   The deaths raised to 351 the number of Palestinians killed in the
Palestinian revolt against Israel's 21-year occupation. Fifteen
Israelis also have died.
   Since the uprising began, settlers have complained of
insufficient protection by the army. They have sought permission to
fire on stone-throwers and demanded deportations of Palestinian
activists on a large scale.
   About 65,000 Jewish settlers live in the West Bank, along with
about 850,000 Palestinians.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir told visiting U.S.
congressional aides today he would accept an active U.N. role in
arranging Arab-Israeli peace talks but not in actual negotiations,
his spokesman said.
   Avi Pazner, Shamir's spokesman, quoted Shamir as telling the
20-member delegation that the United Nations could send out
invitations and bring the parties together.
   Shamir has been under increased pressure to find new ways to
reinvigorate the peace process since Yasser Arafat, chief of
Palestine Liberation Organization, proposed a U.N.-sponsored peace
conference and opened direct talks with U.S. officials last month.
Israel rejects such a conference, saying the United Nations is
biased.
   Shamir's spokesman said the U.N. role could resemble the one
played by U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar in bringing
Iran and Iraq to the negotiating table.
   Perez de Cuellar met with leaders of both warring nations,
shuttling between their capitals to arrange talks leading to a
cease-fire in August.
   ``In order to get to direct talks, Israel is ready for the
auspices of the two superpowers and is ready to have the United
Nations play a certain role in inviting the parties to negotiate,''
said Pazner.
   The spokesman stressed, however, that Israel would not agree to
either the superpowers or the United Nations ``getting involved in
the substance'' of negotiations.
   Officials say Shamir will unveil a peace plan when he visits
Washington, probably in late February or March.
   The liberal daily Haaretz reported today that Shamir would give
French President Francois Mitterrand a preview when he travels to
France in February.

<HEAD>Governor Gets Chilly Response to Request for Air Time</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER B. DALY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Michael Dukakis, who just months ago could
command a national television audience, got a chilly response to his
request for five minutes' air time on Massachusetts TV stations to
pitch a tax increase.
   Dukakis on Wednesday asked stations for time at the start of
their newscasts tonight to make his case directly to voters.
   WCVB said no. News executive Philip Balboni called the request a
``completely inappropriate'' attempt to manipulate the news.
   ``Our responsibility is to cover that story but to cover it from
all sides and then report it to our viewers, and that is what we
will do,'' he said.
   Executives at WNEV agreed to the governor's request. Other
stations said they were discussing it.
   WBZ demanded a copy of Dukakis' speech before noon today before
deciding whether to give him air time, a request Dukakis' press
secretary said would not be met, news director Stan Hopkins said. As
a result, the station will not provide air time.
   Boston public TV station WGBH was not asked for the time.
Managing editor John VanScoyoc said the governor would appear on its
news show tonight in an interview.
   ``It's a way for the governor to reach the most people
directly,'' Steve Crawford, a Dukakis press secretary, said in
explaining the request.
   Crawford insisted Dukakis was not seeking the TV time because
news accounts are incomplete or biased. He said the hope was to
deliver to viewers the type of statement newspapers often provide
when they publish texts of major addresses.
   According to officials familiar with the governor's thinking,
Dukakis plans to seek up to $200 million extra income in the current
fiscal year, which ends on June 30, and as much as $600 million next
year.
   Dukakis has acknowledged a shortfall of at least $600 million in
the state's current $11.6 billion budget, a gap he attributes to a
revenue slowdown.

<TEXT>
   The government today said West German
companies or individuals may have helped build a suspected chemical
arms plant in Libya and that it is checking for any violations of
export laws.
   The issue has aggravated normally warm relations between the
United States and West German.
   ``The federal government has indications of the possible
participation of German companies or persons at this plant in
Libya,'' chief government spokesman Friedhelm Ost said in a
statement.
   ``West German authorities are intensively pursuing these leads,''
Ost said without providing details.
   He said the government is checking documents held by the Customs
Service to decide if it should prosecute violations of export law
that may have occurred.
   Earlier today, government officials said indications that West
German companies helped build and outfit the plant had embarrassed
the government and damaged the nation's image.
   ``There is no question these allegations have caused serious
damage to West Germany's international prestige,'' said a
high-ranking government official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   ``The government is in an extremely embarrassing and difficult
position,'' said the official, referring to developments that forced
Chancellor Helmut Kohl to reverse statements that there was no
evidence of involvement by West German companies in the affair.
   Earlier today, authorities conceded unofficially they had found
``indications'' that at least two West German companies played major
roles in supplying equipment for the plant, and a shipper also
implicated in the affair was arrested in Belgium on Wednesday night.
   Libya's ambassador to the United Nations, Ali Treiki, said today
on ``CBS This Morning'' that West Germans ``did help us, not only in
this plant, in other plants also.
   ``We have a vast cooperation with West Germany and certainly some
companies participated in this pharmaceutical plant,'' Treiki said.
   The Libyan leader, Col. Moammar Gadhafi, says the factory, 40
miles south of Tripoli, is for the production of pharmaceuticals,
not chemical weapons.
   Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher conceded in an interview
with the ARD television network that ``there are a number of
indications that evidently point in this direction'' of West German
involvement in the plant.
   Federal officials confirmed a criminal investigation has begun
against a now-defunct Frankfurt company _ I.B.I. Engineering _ and
that investigators had seized company documents.
   Officials also confirmed that the documents linked another
company, Imhausen-Chemie of Lahr, to the construction project,
backing claims made by the United States last month.
   A source with the Belgian Justice Ministry reported today that
Jozef Gedopt, director-general of Cross Link of Antwerp, was taken
into custody and charged with forging shipping documents for goods
sent to Libya.
   Under West German law, the Economics Ministry must approve export
licenses for arms, hazardous substances or components that can be
used to produce them. There is also a ban on export of high
technology to ``sensitive areas.''
   Bonn last week announced that an initial investigation of
Imhausen-Chemie turned up no evidence of illegal shipments. But U.S.
officials did not let up in pressing their case on the involvement
of West German firms, and the controversy has dominated news reports
and political discussions in Bonn.

<TEXT>
   A law requiring rest breaks and special
training for many workers using video display terminals went into
effect today in a Long Island county despite a legal challenge.
   Suffolk County health officials, who will enforce the law,
estimated that it applies to 8,500 VDT users in 150 to 200
businesses.
   The measure is believed to be the first VDT-regulating law
enacted by a local government.
   A state Supreme Court judge is expected to rule within the next
two weeks on a challenge to the measure brought by four businesses.
   The judge has already granted the four businesses a preliminary
injunction blocking a section of the law that would have required
employers to pay 80 percent of the cost of eye examinations and
glasses for VDT operators.
   Suffolk County's 18-member legislature approved the law in June
over the objections of County Executive Patrick Halpin, who said it
would hurt businesses and was of questionable value to VDT operators.
   The measure applies to operators who spend more than 26 hours a
week in front of a screen in a private workplace with 20 or more
terminals.
   Beginning today, those workers must be given a 15-minute break or
alternate work assignment every three hours.
   The employers also must notify VDT operators of health hazards,
including eye strain and nervous disorders, which may result from
prolonged use of VDTs, and must schedule training in recognizing
symptoms and taking protective steps.
   The law does not include fines for violations, but health
officials can file civil charges to force compliance.

   Judith C. Toth says she returned for a
fourth term in Maryland's House of Delegates because she couldn't
find a better job.
   ``I want to be in China. I want to be somewhere else. I don't
want to be here,'' said Ms. Toth, 51, a Democrat who called it quits
on the last day of the 1988 General Assembly with a year left in her
four-year term, saying she was bored with the legislative life.
   Nine months later, she was back, admitting she had to keep her
$23,000-a-year job because she couldn't find another one.
   Ms. Toth, a 14-year veteran of the Legislature, decided against
renting a house for the session, opting for hotel rooms and
commuting about 60 miles from her Germantown home because ``if
something came up this week or next week, I would walk out.''
   Edward Marks, an official with the Montgomery County Democratic
Party, argued that if Ms. Toth is not interested in the job, ``she
should get out. ... It's not fair to her constitutents.''
   ``Would you want someone working for you who is not interested in
the job?'' he asked.
   Democratic Del. Michael R. Gordon, chairman of the Montgomery
County House delegation, thinks Ms. Toth is in an ``embarrassing''
position. As Democratic state Sen. Laurence Levitan put it, ``People
wanted to throw a retirement party for her and here she is again.''
   Ms. Toth said she thinks some of her comments have been
misunderstood, and she emphasized as the 1989 session began
Wednesday that she has loved being a delegate, particularly solving
the problems of her constituents.

<TEXT>
   The Soviet government's highest executive body
today imposed a ``special form of administration'' on the disputed
Nagorno-Karabakh region while keeping it within the Azerbaijani
republic, Tass said.
   The decision by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet was another
step by the government aimed at defusing tensions over the mostly
Armenian enclave, which has been the focus of a violent struggle
between Armenians and Azerbaijanis.
   The dispute between Armenia, which wants to annex the area, and
neighboring Azerbaijan has led to more than 60 deaths in almost a
year of unrest. About 200,000 refugees have streamed across the
border.
   Military law and a strict curfew were imposed in many parts of
the two republics in November to quell ethnic violence.
   Tass said the decision today was made at a meeting of the
Presidium convened by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to consider
``urgent'' state issues.
   There had been unconfirmed reports in Moscow as well as the
Caucasus region for more than a month that the Kremlin would
transfer Nagorno-Karabakh to the Russian federation, the largest of
the 15 Soviet republics, in an effort to end the dispute.
   But a Tass statement made it clear the Kremlin intended to keep
the small, mountainous region within Azerbaijan.
   The Presidium ``found it expedient to temporarily introduce in
the Nagorno-Karabakh autonomous region a special form of
administration, with Nagorno-Karabakh retaining its status as an
autnomous region incorporated in Azerbaijan,'' Tass said.
   It did not explain what the special administration entailed, and
said a decree will be published later by the official press.
   Gorbachev said last week that a special commission of the ruling
Communist Party Politburo was to meet Wednesday to consider the
ethnic dispute between the two Soviet republics in the Caucasus.
   There was no word Wednesday from state-run media that such a
meeting had taken place, although Tass reported that the Communist
Party chiefs of the two republics met in Moscow and agreed to try to
persuade refugees who fled ethnic violence to return to their homes.
   Nagorno-Karabakh's predominantly Armenian population began
agitating in February for annexation by Armenia, and ther cause was
taken up by thousands of demonstrators in the Armenian capital,
Yerevan, and other Armenian cities.
   The demands led to violence between the two ethnic groups in both
republics.
   In July, the Presidium turned down the Armenian annexation
requests, and opted instead for a program of government economic and
social aid for Nagorno-Karabakh.

<TEXT>
   An outbreak of plague has wiped out one-fifth of
the prairie dogs at the Rocky Mountain Arsenal, but the onset of
winter is believed to have killed the fleas carrying the disease,
Army officials say.
   ``We've lost 1,000 of our 5,500 acres of prairie dogs,'' Capt.
Andrew Kingery, spokesman for the Army's chemical contamination
cleanup operations, said Wednesday.
   No humans are believed to have contracted the disease, but it may
have spread to coyotes, officials said. Only fleas, not mammals, can
transmit the disease, which usually takes the form of bubonic plague
in humans.
   Kingery said U.S. Fish and Wildlife biologists noticed a large
decline in the prairie dog population last month.
   The Army restricted access to the area and called in an Army
entomologist, but the weather turned cold and the scientist was
unable to obtain flea samples, Kingery said.
   ``So we contracted for a coyote specialist to trap four
animals,'' Kingery said. ``We forwarded blood samples from the
coyotes to the Center for Disease Control in Fort Collins and on
Jan. 3 they confirmed the presence of plague.''
   The coyotes carried antibodies to the plague, but it was not
known whether they had contracted the disease, he said.
   Kingery said there is no threat to anyone visiting the arsenal.

   A judge today blocked Gov. Mario Cuomo's
order to return an American Indian to North Carolina to face
kidnapping charges brought after an armed takeover of a newspaper
office.
   Madison County Judge William O'Brien III set a Feb. 28 hearing
date for arguments on whether Timothy Jacobs should be returned to
North Carolina.
   Jacobs' lawyers asked for the stay after Cuomo signed a request
from North Carolina Gov. Jim Martin on Tuesday to return Jacobs.
   O'Brien allowed Jacobs to remain free on $25,000 bail and told
him he must remain in the custody of the Onondaga Indian Nation and
not leave New York.
   District Attorney Neal Rose opposed allowing Jacobs to remain
free, saying that Jacobs might flee as his extradition nears and
that his freedom might send a message that New York is a ``safe
haven for people who commit violent acts.''
   ``At least now we have time to make plans,'' Jacobs said. ``I
hope we are allowed to present the case on why I should not be
returned to North Carolina.''
   Jacobs has said that he would not receive a fair trial in Robeson
County, N.C., and that he fears for his life if he is returned there.
   Jacobs, 20, and Eddie Hatcher, 31, were charged in the 1988
takeover in Lumberton, N.C. They said they took over the newspaper
to bring corruption by county officials to light.
   A federal jury Oct. 14 acquitted them of federal hostage-taking
charges, but they still face the state kidnapping charges.
   Jacobs, after his indictment on state charges, fled to the
Onondaga Indian Nation reservation south of Syracuse but was
captured Dec. 13 after a car chase.
   He was released on bail under an agreement with Onondaga leaders
that he would be turned over to authorities should Cuomo order his
return.
   Hatcher also fled to the Onondaga territory but has since moved
to a Shoshone-Bannock reservation in Idaho.

<HEAD>Assistant City Clerk Fired After Secretly Investing, Losing City
Funds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JACKSONVILLE BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The assistant city clerk secretly
invested more than $2 million in city money and lost almost half of
it, officials said.
   Police Chief Paul Brown said Wednesday that Frank Vestal, who was
fired Monday, made unauthorized investments for the beach city in
high-risk government bonds in 1987 and 1988, resulting in an
estimated loss of $901,000.
   ``The investment itself is not the type ... the city could have
ever considered being involved in,'' Brown said. ``Normally, they
purchase guaranteed government securities for an absolute known
return.''
   Brown said the matter would be referred to the State Attorney's
Office for possible criminal charges.
   City Manager Lester Griffis said that the community of about
20,000 is checking on how to recoup the the money. But he said the
city has a $50 million annual budget and should be able to cover its
losses without major difficulty.
   Vestal, 42, had been employed by the city since 1982 and was
promoted to assistant city clerk in 1986. He worked as the city's
senior accountant.
   Calls to his home today went unanswered.

<HEAD>Shiite Leader: No Action on Hostage Issue on Horizon</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A leading Lebanese Moslem Shiite clergyman
was quoted as saying there will be no developments involving foreign
hostages in Lebanon until sometime after President-elect George Bush
takes office.
   Mohammed Mehdi Shamseddine, acting chairman of the Higher Shiite
Supreme Council in Lebanon, spoke in an interview published
Wednesday in the London-based Saudi Arabian newspaper Al-Sharq
Al-Awsat.
   He said that the prevailing view before had been that the hostage
issue would move once the American presidential election campaign
was over. ``But we did not see anything on the horizon at the time
to indicate that.''
   ``But I cautiously expect that after sufficient time has lapsed
following the new American president taking office that the issue of
the hostages moves anew,'' he was quoted as saying.
   There are 15 foreigners believed held hostage in Lebanon.
   Shamseddine, who spent most of December in Tehran, recalled in
the interview that he had predicted before Iran accepted United
Nations Resolution 598 _ the basis for the Iran-Iraq cease-fire that
went into effect Aug. 20 _ that the hostage issue would grow more
complex.
   ``Contrary to the conviction prevailing at the time, we expected
the issue of the Western hostages of Beirut to become more
complicated. It seems our prediction was correct. For despite the
passage of more than five months after Iran's acceptance of 598,
there has not been any progress whatsoever in the issue of the
hostages,'' he was quoted as saying.
   ``We still hold the same view. That the time has not yet come for
the issue of the hostages,'' he said.
   Shamseddine said ``considerable prudence will be needed in
dealing with the hostage issue. But I say that ending the issue is
not going to take as much time as it took till now. Until when? I am
not in a position to state or speculate.''
   Asked about links between the hostages and the fighting between
Shiite militias in south Beirut, where the hostaes are believed
held, he said he did not see a clear connection but there was a link
that he could not talk about in the interview.
   On the future of Iran's relations with Lebanon, he said that it
was intertwined with a Lebanese political settlement, noting that
Tehran backed the predominately Moslem government of Salim Hoss.
   Lebanon has had rival Moslem and Christian governments since its
Parliament failed to elect a successor to President Amin Gemayel
when his term expired Sept. 23, 1988.
   The 15 foreign hostages include nine Americans. The longest held
is Terry A. Anderson, 41, chief Middle East correspondent for The
Associated Press, who was kidnapped March 16, 1985.

   After Maeve Ryan sings one last rendition of
``Danny Boy,'' the long-running soap opera ``Ryan's Hope'' fades to
black on Friday, leaving fans to wonder for eternity, who is Grace's
father?
   ABC announced in October that it was canceling the daytime drama
after 13{ years and 3,515 episodes.
   After wrapping up most of the storylines, the final scene has
Maeve (Helen Gallagher), joined by family and friends in Ryan's Bar,
singing ``Danny Boy'' as she has traditionally on every St.
Patrick's Day. This year, there will be no St. Patrick's Day for the
Ryans.
   ``Yes, it is a tear-jerker,'' said Karen Reynolds, the publicist
for the show who attended the taping of the final episode.
   The final episode features the wedding of reporter Jack Fenelli
(Michael Levin) and newspaper publisher Leigh Kirkland (Felicity
Lafortune). Of the series' other continuing storylines, the only
major one to be left hanging is the paternity of 4-year-old Grace
Coleridge.
   In the final scene, Pat Ryan (Malcolm Groome), who suspects he
might be the child's father, asks Faith Coleridge (Karen
Morris-Gowdy) who Grace's father is. Faith says she'll tell him
after Maeve sings. Fans, like Pat Ryan, will never hear the answer.
   ABC said it canceled the soap because too many affiliates chose
to pre-empt the low-rated drama for noon newscasts.
   ```Ryan's Hope' has not been rejected by the audience, it has
simply been unavailable to viewers,'' Jo Ann Emmerich, vice
president of daytime programs for ABC Entertainment, said at the
time. ``Without sufficient stations to carry it, it has become a
victim of audience erosion.''
   At its lowest ebb, the show was carried by only 75 percent of
ABC's 200-plus affiliates. ABC said the show was being dropped
instead of moved because the network did not have an appropriate
timeslot for a half-hour drama.
   The series has won 17 Daytime Emmys _ including three for Helen
Gallagher as Maeve _ and 11 Writers Guild awards. It launched the
careers of many well-known actors, including Corbin Bernsen, who
stars on NBC's ``L.A. Law,'' and Kate Mulgrew, star of ABC's
``HeartBeat.''

<TEXT>
   A court has given authorities permission to build a
highway through a 17th-century battlefield, capping a 13-year
struggle.
   The Court of Appeal says the Transport Department can go ahead
with the four-lane highway across fields where Oliver Cromwell's
13,000-member parliamentary force routed King Charles I's 9,000
royalists in 1645 in the decisive battle of the English Civil War.
   In a unanimous ruling Wednesday, the three judges sympathized
with historians opposing the highway. But they said the victors in
the 17th century battle at Naseby in central England would have
preferred the court to abide by Transport Minister Peter Bottomley's
decision.
   ``The wisdom of investing this exercise of judgment to a
democratically elected minister rather than the court would have
appealed to those who won the day at Naseby,'' wrote Lord Justice
Thomas Bingham.
   Sir Charles Rowley, vice chairman of the Society for the
Protection of the Field of the Battle of Naseby, shot back:
``Cromwell might have been a bit of a destructive chap himself, but
he would never have approved of this.''

   The Defense Department staged an unusual
``farewell review'' for President Reagan today, and the military
services were told to absorb the undisclosed cost of the pageant.
   Responding to the military honors heaped on him in the 45-minute
ceremony, Reagan praised the 595 men and women in the armed forces
whom he said had died in defense of freedom since he became
president in 1981.
   ``Over the last eight years, the lustre has been restored to the
reputation of our fighting forces, after a time during which it was
shamefully fashionable to deride and even condemn service such as
yours,'' Reagan told the assembly.
   ``Those days will never come again,'' he said, to applause that
thundered inside a hangar at Andrews Air Force Base in nearby
Maryland.
   ``But it is not just your fellow Americans who owe you a debt,''
the president said. ``Because we remained strong, because we acted
when we believed we had to, in the last eight years, not one inch of
ground on this earth fell under communist control.''
   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci presented the president with
medals from the Defense Department and its four armed services plus
the Coast Guard at the opening of the event.
   Carlucci praised Reagan's policies, which he said had contributed
to the Soviet decision to withdraw from Afghanistan and the planned
Vietnamese pull out of Cambodia and Cuban withdrawal from Angola.
   ``Your vision of a strong America assuming its rightful role on
the world stage has produced lasting results. Our nation has moved
from self-doubt to self-confidence,'' he said.
   Much of the planned fanfare was canceled because of a steady rain
that fell throughout the morning, and the ceremonies were held
inside a 14-story-tall hangar designed to hold the two new Boeing
747 airliners being delivered later this year for presidential use.
   First lady Nancy Reagan canceled plans to attend the salute
because she has ``a touch of laryngitis,'' said a spokeswoman, Wendy
Toler. ``She just isn't feeling well and decided not to got out in
the cold,'' Mrs. Toler said.
   Inside the hanger were some of the fruits of Reagan's
trillion-dollar military buildup, including the the Air Force's new
B-1B bomber, as well as jet fighters, helicopters, an Army M-1A
tank, and one of the E-4B aerial command post planes that is always
standing by in case of war.
   Carlucci's predecessor, Caspar Weinberger, also was on hand and
greeted Reagan as he sat down to watch a military review that bagan
with a display by the Army's Colonial Fife and Drum Corps dressed in
Revolutionary War garb.
   The ceremony included a Pentagon film lauding Reagan and his
decisions to invade Grenada in 1983, bomb Libya in 1986 and escort
Kuwaiti oil tankers in the Persian Gulf two years ago.
   Adm. William Crowe, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told
Reagan ``we want to thank you and thank you sincerely for the legacy
of strength that you are leaving to our next commander-in-chief.''
   ``You have made patriotism fashionable again and serving in the
military attractive,'' said Crowe.
   On a jocular note, Crowe cautioned Reagan that ``the weather will
not be like this in California,'' referring to the drier climate in
Los Angeles, where Reagan will live after Jan. 20.
   Among the outdoor events canceled because of the rain were
fly-overs of 17 military aircraft.
   The Marine Band provided music and the Joint Service Honor Guard
marched before the president. Every four-star general and admiral
was invited to attend, along with about 1,400 VIPs and government
officials.
   Despite such elaborate preparations, the Pentagon said Wednesday
it could not estimate the cost of the farewell ``at this time.''
   ``Funding for the salute will be absorbed by each of the
services,'' it said. ``Each service also is responsible for funding
(the attendance of) their respective general and flag officers.''
   The Defense Department acknowledged it was not a normal practice
to stage such a farewell for an outgoing president.
   ``It has not been done in recent history,'' the Pentagon said,
but refusing to define ``recent history.''

   A slowdown by Iberia airlines mechanics
involved in a labor dispute forced the state-owned carrier Iberia to
cancel 86 domestic and European flights Thursday, a company
spokesman said.
   Jose Maria Estrade said 6,000 passengers were affected by the
cancellations, which included flights to Paris, Rome and London.
   Iberia had 461 flights scheduled for Thursday, he said.
   Estrade blamed the cancellations on the Spanish Association of
Aircraft Maintenance Technicians, which was to carry out the seventh
of a series of 24-hour strikes Friday.
   Union official Tomas Sanchez said the slowdown by 21 mechanics
was in support of 79 mechanics fired by Iberia for their alleged
failure to meet minimum services requirements set by civil aviation
officials.

   A tugboat fleet captain was sentenced to five
years in jail for negligence in a tugboat-ferry collision that
killed 105 people in 1987, an official report said Thursday.
   The state-run Xinhua News Agency said a court in the Jiangsu
province found fleet captain Tian Shouguang guilty of negligence but
did not say whether he was aboard the tugboat in question at the
time of the accident.
   The boat and a wooden, double-decker ferry collided on the
Yangtze River on May 8, 1987, just outside the port city of Nantong
in Jiangsu province. The ferry overturned and sank immediately,
killing 105 passengers and crew.
   The tugboat was not damaged and no one on it was injured.

<HEAD>Three Potatoes in Four Never Make It to Soviet Tables</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union is suffering through a potato
shortage, and more than three out of every four spuds never make it
to the dinner table because of waste, rot and loss in transit, a
newpaper said Thursday.
   ``What's happening in our country with the potato?'' the
Communist youth daily Komsomolskaya Pravda asked. ``Why is it on the
list of goods in short supply?''
   The potato, known to Russians as their ``second bread,'' is an
important staple in many Soviets' diet. But it has been absent or in
short supply in many of the country's food stores for weeks.
   Vladimir Tikhonov, a member of the Soviet National Agricultural
Academy, told Komsomolskaya Pravda that Soviet state and collective
farms produce more than 31 million tons of potatoes annually _ twice
the American crop.
   Americans, though, can eat potatoes all year because crop loss,
from the field to the kitchen, is only 5 percent, Tikhonov said.
   In comparison, Soviets buying potatoes _ a crop that's usually
packaged with a generous quantity of dried mud and already rotten
vegetables _ end up throwing out half the purchase, Tikhonov said.
   ``It happens that if all losses are counted en route to the
consumer, only 7 million tons of potatoes make it `to the cooking
pot,''' Tikhonov told the paper. ``Less than a quarter of the entire
harvest!''
   He called the potato shortage an indication of the woes of Soviet
agriculture as a whole, which because of more than a half-century of
state planning has been geared to meeting government production
targets rather than developing efficient techniques of management
and food transportation and storage.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has called for the widespread
leasing of state-owned farm land to individual peasants to increase
food supply by allowing them to earn more for producing more. The
Communist Party has scheduled a meeting on agriculture in February.

   Rescuers used harnesses to free two
divers trapped in icy water 55 feet down for up to 11 hours, but
both died, officials said today.
   The divers, who were repairing an 80-foot-high, 72-year-old
wilderness dam owned by Great Northern Paper Co., became trapped
Wednesday by water pressure at openings they had cut in the dam on
Chesuncook Lake, authorities said.
   The diver credited with hooking the two up to the harnesses
against the enormous pressure created by lake waters pressing
against the dam was hospitalized today in good condition, State
Police said.
   Albert O. Harjula, 29, of Thomaston, became trapped first, said
Paul Fournier, a spokesman for the state Department of Inland
Fisheries and Wildlife.
   Daniel Sullivan, 30, of Boothbay, went down to help and also
became stuck, Fournier said.
   During the 10-hour rescue, diver Brian Michaud of Millinocket
hooked the men to harnesses, and rescuers dragged them to the
surface with winches.
   Harjula was under water for more than 11 hours. He was pronounced
dead on arrival at the hospital early today, said Trooper Kathy
Roope.
   Sullivan died at the hospital nearly three hours after he was
pulled from the water. He was in the water about 4{ hours, Fournier
said.
   Both died of hypothermia, or severe loss of body heat, the
trooper said. Fournier estimated the water temperature was 35
degrees.
   Michaud spent the night in Millinocket Regional Hospital but was
in good condition today, authorities said.
   Harjula had a telephone link with the surface and was able to
alert workers at the top that he was in trouble, Fournier said.

<TEXT>
   After 22 years of warfare, curfews and
atrocities, the beleaguered Ovambo people of northern Namibia are on
the threshold of emerging as power brokers in the transition to
independence.
   There is an air of excitement in Ovamboland, where half of all
Namibians live. But there also are worries about the staggering
problems that will confront a new government after independence
elections Nov. 1.
   South Africa, which has ruled the territory for 74 years, has
agreed to withdraw from Africa's last colony under the terms of a
1978 United Nations resolution.
   The pullout of South African troops will deprive garrison towns
of their main source of income. The return of tens of thousands of
exiles and refugees will strain local resources, and the possible
takeover of power by the SWAPO guerrilla movement could trigger
vendettas against Ovambos who worked with or fought for South
African authorities.
   ``To be free and independent doesn't mean we are suddenly in
paradise,'' said Bishop Kleopas Dumeni, head of the Evangelical
Lutheran Church, by far the largest denomination in the region. ``We
can accomplish the task of nation-building only if we do it
together.''
   Dumeni's plea for reconciliation is heartfelt. His brother was
killed by a military patrol and one of his daughters was killed in a
bomb blast blamed on SWAPO.
   Ovamboland, in the center of northernmost Namibia, covers only 7
percent of territory's land, but accomodates roughly half its 1.3
million people, most of them living in huts or corrugated metal
shacks.
   It is the region where the guerrillas of SWAPO _ the South-West
African Peoples Organization _ has its strongest support and where
most of the low-intensity guerrilla war has been waged. SWAPO has a
legal political wing operating in Nambia, but the guerrilla movement
is outlawed.
   In the coming months, Ovamboland is expected to become a
political and propaganda battleground, with an array of factions
trying to ward off a SWAPO victory in United Nations-monitored
elections.
   Holding SWAPO to less than two-thirds of the vote would prevent
it from having total control over the elected assembly that will
draft Namibia's new constitution.
   SWAPO sympathizers claim South Africa will try to rig the voting
to favor parties it considers more moderate. Ovambos say security
forces are visiting villages with the message that SWAPO plans
communist-style collectivization and should be opposed.
   SWAPO leader Sam Nujoma has said he does not forsee blanket
nationalization of industries, but his exact political and economic
programs have not been spelled out.
   Among those caught in the political crossfire is Peter Kalangual,
chairman of the Ovambo Regional Administration. He has cooperated to
a degree with the territorial government while at the same time
trying, with mixed success, to maintain cordial relations with SWAPO.
   ``True reconciliation is not a superficial thing,'' he said.
``For people who've been embittered it's not all that easy.''
   In many cases, the conflict has splintered Ovambo families. While
one son may have fled north to Angola to join SWAPO, his brother may
have joined Koevoet, a police counterinsurgency unit widely accused
of brutality.
   ``The parents are caught in the middle,'' said Kalangula, 62.
``They don't know whether to turn left or right.''
   Israel Shikongo, who works at a human rights center near
Ondangwa, predicted that SWAPO would discourage widespread
retribution against Ovambos who served in the security forces but
would conduct some sort of reorientation program.
   A retired Lutheran minister sympathetic to SWAPO, German-born
Peter Paully said some vengeance-taking was inevitable.
   ``Certainly people who have been really devilish will be hunted
down,'' said Paully, who moved to Namibia in 1951 and has married an
Ovambo woman. ``Those in power in South Africa have done nothing to
defuse this situation.''
   The social and economic needs of post-independence Ovamboland
will be vast.
   Up to 100,000 refugees and exiles, many of them ill or crippled,
will be returning to a region already lacking adequate services and
job opportunities.
   Many adults will lose their jobs as maids or maintenance workers
when the South African army bases close. Changes will be needed in
an education system where one underqualified teacher instructs 50 or
more children in a South African-designed curriculum.
   ``Some students are anticipating a utopian world where, in an
independent state, everyting is candies and honey,'' said Denys
Nandi, Ovamboland's education director. ``I tell them the opposite
is true _ if independence comes everyone must be prepared to work 20
times harder.''

   President Reagan hailed America's servicemen
and women today as ``America's pride'' at an elaborate military
review designed by the Pentagon to bid farewell to their
commander-in-chief.
   Reagan, speaking at the end of the 45-minute ceremony at Andrews
Air Force Base outside Washington, also called for a moment of
silence to remember the 595 persons who had died in the service of
their country over the past eight years of his presidency.
   ``They are not with us today, because they are at God's right
hand. ... They voluntered. They chose to serve, they gave their
lives. They are our heroes,'' Reagan said.
   The president was treated to as much pomp and circumstance as the
Pentagon could muster for the rainy-day ceremony, which was moved
inside a 14-story-tall hangar at the Maryland base.
   Although a fly-by of military jets had to be cancelled because of
the foul weather, Reagan was treated to a review of troops, music by
the scarlet-uniformed Marine Band, and a movie hailing his military
buildup during his two terms in office. He also received service
medals during the festivities.
   Arrayed as a backdrop were the Air Force's new B-1B bomber, as
well as jet fighters and helicopters, many of them purchased during
Reagan's trillion-dollar military buildup.
   ``Mr. President, the pride people feel today _ certainly the
pride felt by the men and women in our armed forces _ is a direct
result of the leadership you have provided as commander-in-chief,''
said Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci. ``You have restored not only
our national strength _ but also our sense of purpose.''
   Reagan said he was thankful to have born ``the most sacred of
tasks'' as the nation's commander-in-chief and to oversee a
resurgence of spirit among the nation's military.
   ``Where, I have at times asked myself, where have you come from?
How you've managed to cohere into the crack, disciplined, patriotic
band of brothers I see before me this morning?'' Reagan asked. He
offered his own answer:
   ``You come from America and you are America's pride. On behalf of
all America, I thank you, and pray God that he may bless you now and
forever.''
   The president said he ordered first lady Nancy Reagan to cancel
plans to attend the ceremony because she was suffering from
laryngitis.
   The farewell came the day after Reagan offered his own Oval
Office goodbye, in which he said he was handing the nation over to
the ``good hands'' of George Bush.
   In a televised speech bidding adieu to the nation, Reagan boasted
Wednesday night of his accomplishments and ignored many of the
difficulties that arose during his eight years in office.
   ``We meant to change a nation, and instead, we changed a world,''
he said.
   Yet Reagan also admitted that his self-styled conservative
revolution left many things unchanged, and he asked his followers to
stick around and help his successor.
   ``If we're to finish the job, Reagan's Regiments will have to
become the Bush Brigades,'' Reagan said. ``Soon he'll be the chief,
and he'll need you every bit as much as I did.''
   The president said he was leaving office with the central message
of his political life strengthened _ that an unfettered economy, a
strong defense and a free citizenry forged a nation ``respected in
the world, and looked to for leadership.''
   ``Democracy, the profoundly good, is also the profoundly
productive,'' he said. ``Because we are a great nation, our
challenges seem complex. It will always be this way. But as long as
we remember our first principles and believe in ourselves, the
future will always be ours.''
   Reagan addressed the nation from his Oval Office desk, his left
hand in a splint and swathed in bandages from weekend surgery on a
finger.
   Speaking nine days before his retirement to California, Reagan
called his departure ``sweet sorrow.'' But he also said he looks
forward to a renewal of personal freedom, contending a modern
president must live ``somewhat apart. You spend a lot of time going
by too fast in a car someone else is driving.''
   Another regret, Reagan said, was his failure to tame the nation's
deficit. But that merited only a paragraph in the roughly 21-minute
speech. ``I've been talking a great deal about that lately, but
tonight isn't for arguments and I'm going to hold my tongue,'' he
said.
   The national debt almost tripled in Reagan's term and he ran up
the biggest budget deficits in history. His final budget proposal,
released earlier this week for the 1990 fiscal year starting Oct. 1,
projects a deficit of $92.5 billion.
   The president's remarks were void of any mention of such national
tragedies as the barracks bombing that killed more than 241
servicemen in Beirut, the Challenger disaster or the Americans held
hostage in the Middle East.
   There was no word of the trade deficits or the scandals that
tarnished his administration, such as the sale of arms to Iran and
use of the proceeds to fund the Contra rebels in Nicaragua
illegally. The Contras, subject of so many Reagan speeches, were not
mentioned at all.
   As triumphs Reagan listed the nation's economic recovery, its low
unemployment and inflation, and its bolstered military.
   The president who warned early in his tenure of the ``evil
empire'' in the Soviet Union took credit at the end of his
presidency for forging ``a satisfying new closeness'' with the
Soviets. He said the new relationship helped bring about the first
U.S.-Soviet treaty to eliminate an entire class of nuclear weapons,
as well as ``a new peacefulness around the globe.''
   ``What it all boils down to is this: I want the new closeness to
continue,'' Reagan said. But he advised those who follow to ``trust
but verify. ... Watch closely _ and don't be afraid to see what you
see.''
   ``We must keep up our guard _ but we must also continue to work
together to lessen and eliminate tension and mistrust,'' he said.

   The daughter of Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini has asked the government for permission to form a women's
association, an official report said Thursday.
   The Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in Nicosia, quoted
the English-language daily Tehran Times as saying Zahra Mostafavi
applied for permission with the Interior Ministry ``to form the
Women's Society of the Islamic Republic of Iran.''
   The agency quoted the newspaper as saying Mrs. Mostafavi has been
active in Iranian women's affairs. It added, ``She has always
emphasized that women should better realize their rights and
concentrate their efforts on regaining their denied ones.''
   Women are not regarded as equal with men in Iran and generally
are required to go out in public in traditional Islamic dress, the
head-to-toe black veil known as a chador.
   Last month, Interior Minister Hojatolesman Ali Akbar Mohtashami
said Iranians could submit applications to form political parties
and other groups. Mrs. Mostafavi, 49, is one of Khomeini's three
daughters. He also has a son who serves as an adviser.

   The president gave no explanation of the move, the radio said.
But he complained Wednesday of nail shortages which he said were

   Kimaiyo arap Sego, who was appointed to the Cabinet after general

   A branch of the country's sole legal political party, the Kenya
African National Union, said Jan. 3 the party should discipline
Sego. It gave no reason.
   Sego was the second minister to leave the Cabinet within five

communications after a dispute over the outcome of party elections
in his central Kenya constituency.

<HEAD>Officers Sue Over Job Transfers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two police officers who led the
investigation of the deaths of seven people unearthed in a
boardinghouse yard are suing their bosses for transferring them to
other jobs.
   Lt. Joe Enloe and Sgt. James L. Jorgensen allege their
reassignments were punitive and illegal; their superiors maintain
the transfers were routine.
   ``These transfers were precipitous, unwise and unfair,'' said
Blake Koller, president of the Sacramento Police Officers
Association. ``It was an effort to use the officers as scapegoats
for the errors of management.''
   The Police Department came under fire for allowing Dorothea
Montalvo Puente to walk away from the house Nov. 12, one day after
the first body was discovered in her yard. Police have also been
criticized for allowing a reporter to interview Puente on a
media-chartered flight back to Sacramento after her capture in Los
Angeles.
   Puente, 59, has been charged with murdering one of her tenants,
and prosecutors have said they expect to file more murder counts at
a court hearing next week.
   The officers' lawsuit seeks a court order directing the city and
the City Civil Service Board to provide the officers with an
administrative appeal hearing so they can challenge the transfers.

<HEAD>CIA Chief Says Good Progress in Bombing Probe; Soviets Might Help</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Adds one graf of Soviet comment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Investigators are making good progress in
probing the bombing of a Pan Am jumbo jet last month, CIA Director
William Webster said in an interview published today, and he thinks
Soviet intelligence agents would pass on any tip they might have on
who is responsible.
   ``The leads are very encouraging. We've come a long way in
understanding what caused the crash'' in Scotland that killed 270
people Dec. 21, Webster told USA Today.
   ``We understand the nature of the (explosive) device and we
already have a good reading on those organizations that were capable
of acquiring _ I don't want to say manufacturing _ such a device and
getting it through the security gates that are in place to protect
international traveling,'' he said.
   ``There's a real determination to stay with this,'' he added.
   But, the intelligence chief said, ``I can't tell you when or how
soon'' the case will be broken.
   Middle Eastern terrorist groups have claimed responsibility for
the Pan Am bombing, in which a plastic explosive was placed in a
forward cargo hold in the Boeing 747 jumbo jet.
   USA Today said Webster, asked whether the government of Libya was
suspect, hesitated for 10 seconds and then said: ``I don't think
we're in a position to say that.''
   Asked about the possibility that Soviet intelligence agents might
pass on a tip as to who was responsible for the bombing, Webster
replied: ``I would guess they would.''
   ``It's a view that I have held that conflicts with many who have
thought that the Soviet Union was monolithically responsible for
most of the terrorism around the world, particularly a decade ago,''
he continued.
   ``To whatever extent their involvement in training and supplying
and shielding terrorists a decade ago may have been true,'' factors
such as President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's desire to give the Soviet
Union a world leadership role have changed that, Webster suggested.
   ``We've has intimations of a desire of the Soviets to work in the
world arena to reduce the threat of terrorism,'' he said.
   At a Soviet Embassy news conference today dealing with other
matters, Soviet charge d'affaires Evgeney Kutuvoy said he could add
nothing to Webster's remarks. ``Probably he has some information on
this subject I don't have,'' Kutuvoy said.

<HEAD>Thornburgh, Walsh Press Iran-Contra Judge To Drop Charges Against
North</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETE YOST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh and
independent counsel Lawrence Walsh today pressed the federal judge
in the Iran-Contra case to drop conspiracy and theft charges against
fired National Security Council aide Oliver L. North.
   Walsh filed a memorandum under seal in U.S. District Court in
support of his motion of last Thursday to dismiss the two central
counts. The charges that would be dropped allege that North and
three co-defendants illegally diverted more than $14 million in
U.S.-Iran arms-sale profits to the Nicaraguan rebels.
   The memo was accompanied by declarations from Thornburgh and
Walsh, the independent counsel said in a statement. The material
outlines the position of the Reagan administration that, out of
concern for national security, it cannot allow certain classified
documents to be disclosed at North's trial in support of Walsh's
case.
   U.S. District Judge Gerhard Gesell refused to dismiss the two
counts on Monday, saying he first wanted an affidavit from
Thornburgh detailing the administration's objections to releasing
the classified material contained in documents Walsh wanted to use
to prosecute North.
   On Dec. 12, Gesell said a substantial amount of classified
material must be disclosed in order to give North a fair trial,
including the names of Central American countries where North was
involved in the secret resupply operation to the Contras.
   Gesell also said that the ranks and duties of officials of
foreign governments who appear in the classified documents must be
disclosed, although the judge permitted the names of the officials
to be deleted.
   Gesell also insisted that CIA personnel be identified as working
for the agency, although not by name, and that the text of
information obtained by intelligence be presented verbatim in most
instances.
   Last Thursday, Walsh moved to dismiss the conspiracy and theft
charges, citing North's ``insistence on introducing classified
information in his defense'' and the Reagan administration's refusal
to release material the judge ruled North would need at trial.
   North is still confronted with 12 felony charges that carry
prison terms totaling as much as 60 years.
   These include obstructing various congressional and presidential
inquiries into the Iran-Contra affair by preparing false statements
and destroying documents.

<HEAD>Report Calls for $81 Billion More to Modernize Nuclear Weapons Complex</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan today released a report
calling for increased spending of $81 billion to modernize the
nuclear weapons complex over the next 20 years and the closing of
four major facilities.
   Reagan said the 31-page report ``will enable the administration
and the Congress to adopt a long-term approach to modernization
rather than a piecemeal response to the problems within the nuclear
weapons complex.''
   It recommended stopping nuclear fuels processing at four sites
where problems have been highly publicized: the Rocky Flats Plant
near Denver, the Hanford Site near Richland, Wash., the Feed
Materials Production Center at Fernald, Ohio, and the Mound Plant in
Ohio.
   ``Waste management and environmental restoration at these sites
will continue until completion,'' the report said.
   It was not clear whether research activity would continue at
Hanford, which produced the material for early atomic weapons during
the 1940s.
   The report also said that the only three U.S. reactors capable of
producing tritium, a critical element in modern thermonuclear
weapons, could not be restarted until late 1989. The three reactors,
all at the Savannah River Plant, in Aiken, S.C., have been shut down
since last April undergoing changes to make them safer.
   ``In spite of these improvements and increasingly extensive
maintenance, the reactors may not be able to achieve acceptable
production efficiencies,'' said an unclassified version of the
report, released at the White House.
   To meet tritium needs, the report repeated previous
administration recommendations for the construction of a $3.2
billion heavy water reactor at Savannah River and a $3.6 billion new
design gas-cooled reactor at the Energy Department facility at Idaho
Falls, Idaho.
   The budget for fiscal 1990 includes money for the design of those
new reactors.
   The report also addresses the problem of cleaning up nuclear
contamination around the 15 largest facilities in 12 states, as well
as modernizing the plants and closing down four of the most troubled
operations.
   The money would be spent mostly by the Energy Department, which
manufactures nuclear weapons and carries out related research for
the Pentagon.

<HEAD>Nixon Defender, Two Federal Judges Eyed for Solicitor General</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An architect of President Nixon's unsuccessful
executive-privilege Watergate defense is a top prospect for the post
of U.S. solicitor general in the new Bush administration.
   Charles Alan Wright, a civil law expert, is among five or six
candidates being considered for the Justice Department's top legal
policy position by President-elect Bush's transition team and
Attorney General Dick Thornburgh.
   Also under consideration are two conservative federal appellate
judges appointed by President Reagan: Ralph K. Winter of the 2nd
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York and Kenneth Starr of the
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
   Best known for his work for Nixon during the 1973-74 Watergate
investigation, Wright, 61, has a formidable reputation among lawyers
as a legal scholar and expert on federal court procedure.
   A University of Texas law professor, Wright helped devise the
legal argument that executive privilege exempted Nixon from
complying with a subpoena to surrender tape recordings of Oval
Office conversations.
   Although the Supreme Court accepted Nixon's argument that
executive privilege was a valid concept, the justices ruled 8-0 in
1974 that he still was not exempt from subpoenas for evidence needed
in court cases.
   In a decision that led to Nixon's resignation, the high court
ordered him to surrender the tapes, which contained damaging
evidence of White House involvement in covering up the Watergate
break-in.
   The presidential appointment of a solicitor general requires
Senate confirmation.
   The solicitor general is the government's chief appeals lawyer,
arguing cases before the Supreme Court and deciding whether to
appeal lower court decisions against federal agencies.
   The solicitor is known in legal circles as the 10th justice
because the high court has traditionally relied upon him to provide
legal guidance.
   Charles Fried, the current solicitor, is leaving office to return
to Harvard University Law School.
   Winter, 53, a former Yale University law professor who became a
judge in 1982, and Starr, 42, who served as couselor to Attorney
General William French Smith from 1981 until his appointment to the
D.C. Circuit in 1983, had been mentioned as possible Supreme Court
nominees following the 1987 retirement of Justice Lewis Powell.
   Justice Thurgood Marshall gave up a seat on the 2nd Circuit to
become solicitor general in 1965. Two years later, President Johnson
named him to the high court.
   Wright's appointment as solicitor general would cap a
distinguished career as a professor, appellate lawyer and expert on
court procedure. He has represented the state of Texas before the
Supreme Court, notably in death penalty and voting-age cases.
   Wright also is the co-author of the definiitive legal textbook on
federal court procedures and practice.

<HEAD>Six Survivors Found in Rubble 35 Days After Armenian Earthquake</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Fixes 1st graf to clarify survivors weren't rescued today.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANN IMSE</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Six people were pulled from the basement of a
collapsed apartment building in Leninakan, 35 days after the
Armenian earthquake, Tass said today. The men were quoted as saying
they survived on canned vegetables, fruit, pickles and ham.
   The survivors were rescued Wednesday, Tass said, the 35th day
after the Dec. 7 earthquake that killed an estimated 25,000 people
in northwest Armenia. Rescuers last pulled a person alive from the
wreckage Dec. 26, Tass said.
   The six men were found under the rubble in the basement of a
nine-story apartment building which had collapsed on them, the
official Soviet news agency said in a report from Yerevan, the
capital of Armenia.
   They survived because there was plenty of canned food stored in
the basement, Tass said. All are hospitalized in Yerevan but none
are in danger, doctors told the news agency.
   Tass did not say how the six men were found or who rescued them.
Officials had ended the search for survivors weeks ago, saying it
was necessary to clear away the rubble to prevent disease spreading
from decayed bodies.
   Authorities have been demolishing buildings that could not be
rebuilt after the earthquake.
   One of the six survivors, Aikaz Akopyan, had medical training and
administered massages to the others to relieve the pain of their
injuries, Tass said. One of the men, Karlen Sarkissyan, had a broken
arm and the others sustained only minor injuries, Tass said.
   ``On the day of the earthquake, I asked five neighbors to help me
carry two heavy wooden kegs to the basement,'' Akopyan was quoted as
telling Tass. ``Just then, we suddenly heard a terrible roar. The
earth trembled, and walls began to collapse. I thought a war had
started.''
   ``It's true, we used the food sparingly,'' the 50-year-old
electrician said. ``After all, we had no idea what had happened, nor
how long we would be entombed. We lost track of time completely. But
we never doubted for a minute that we would be found and released.
   ``I had only one thought _ to do everything necessary so my young
friends would not go crazy,'' Akopyan said. ``I entertained them,
calmed them, sang, and told stories about my life.''
   He identified two of the other survivors as Rafik Simonyan and
Vanik Khachaturyan. He said he could not remember the names of the
others.
   Akopyan said the men never had to worry about food and water
because the basement was used to store tins of vegetables, fruits
and pickles.
   ``It's true, we conserved the food in every possible way. But we
never doubted for a minute that we would be found and released,'' he
was quoted as saying.
   An editor at Armenpress, the Tass affiliate in Yerevan, said in a
telephone interview there were no details of how the men were
discovered because there is still only one telephone line to
Leninakan.
   The editor, who would not give his name, said Akopyan said
nothing about the rescue or conditions in the basement, and doctors
were refusing to allow further interviews with him because he had
developed pneumonia. He said his staff had not yet been able to meet
with the other five survivors.
   The quake leveled much of Leninakan, Armenia's second-largest
city 10 miles east of the Turkish border and left thousands homeless.
   Once home to more than 280,000 people, Leninakan today has only
100,000 inhabitants, thousands of whom now live in tents. Many
residents have been evacuated.
   Survivors also have had to deal with bitter cold conditions and
snow, which officials said hampered the rescue efforts.
   On Dec. 14, rescuers pulled a mother, Susanna Petrosyan, and her
4-year-old daughter, Gayaney, out of the rubble in Leninakan.
   The two had been buried alive for eight days. To keep her
daughter alive after their only food _ a jar of blackberry jam _ was
gone, the mother had cut her fingers and fed the child blood.

   Lawn mowing is banned on Sundays, noisy
tennis ball machines are outlawed in the mornings and hanging
laundry outside is strictly forbidden.
   So it's no surprise that surfers are unwelcome in this posh
seaside town.
   ``These are very undesirable people coming into town,'' said
resident Alan Beal.
   After hearing his arguments, the City Council voted Tuesday to
ban parking along a street used by many out-of-town swimmers and
surfers accused of littering, trespassing and disturbing the peace.
Two other streets already have similar parking bans for
non-residents.
   The ban takes effect after signs are posted in several weeks.
   Police Chief Joseph Terlizzese said on an average weekend his
officers make 10 arrests and issue 35 to 40 parking tickets in the
12-block area where most of the problems have occurred.

   Olympic diver Bruce Kimball was under a
suicide watch in his jail cell today after pleading guilty to
manslaughter by drunken driving in the deaths of two teen-agers,
authorities said.
   ``He is scared to death of everything,'' said Maj. James Cook, a
supervisor at the Hillsborough County Jail. Jailers checked on
Kimball every 15 minutes because of warnings from his lawyers that
he might be suicidal, authorities said.
   A series of psychiatric tests showed he has been developing
suicidal tendencies, his lawyers said.
   ``We told the judge we were seriously concerned about his
emotional state, and we told him of our concerns about
self-destructive behavior,'' lawyer Frank Quesada told The Tampa
Tribune.
   On Wednesday, Kimball pleaded guilty to spare grieving relatives
who had just heard gruesome testimony on the accident, his father
said.
   ``He did it for the right reasons,'' a sobbing Dick Kimball,
father of the 1984 silver medalist, said outside the courtroom. ``He
did not want to put the families of the kids through a horrible
trial, or our family.''
   The plea came Wednesday as testimony was just beginning in the
Circuit Court trial on charges that the athlete drunkenly plowed
into a crowd of teen-agers with his sports car in suburban Brandon
on Aug. 1. The late night crash injured six people. Kimball and his
two passengers escaped serious injury.
   The case drew international attention when Kimball decided to
compete for a place on the 1988 Olympic diving team less than a
month after the crash. He failed to make the squad.
   He pleaded guilty to two counts of driving under the influence
manslaughter and three of causing great bodily harm while driving
under the influence. Kimball, who was jailed pending sentencing Jan.
30, faces seven to 22 years in prison.
   The plea surprised Assistant State Attorney John Skye, who was
about to show jurors 43 color photographs of the crash scene.
   ``Obviously the pictures were the most graphically unpleasant
part of this case,'' Skye said later.
   Before the plea, Hillsborough County Sheriff's Deputy Karen Ovitt
testified about the accident scene for the prosecution.
   She described finding two bodies on the road ``in pieces'' and
two of the injured teens, one bleeding badly and moaning, another
bloody and screaming.
   Killed in the accident were Robbie Bedell, 19, and Kevin Gossic,
16. A 16-year-old who survived lost a leg, which was later
reattached.
   Kimball met with attorneys from both sides in Judge Harry Lee
Coe's chambers for half an hour, then emerged grim and glassy eyed
to make his guilty plea.
   ``Are you pleading guilty because you are guilty and for no other
reason?'' Coe asked.
   ``Yes,'' replied Kimball, his voice barely audible.
   Among the victims' relatives and friends at the trial was
Bedell's fiancee, Dawn Berrios, who burst into tears outside the
courtroom later and said, ``I'm just glad it's over. I think we all
know the carnage that was out there.''
   During opening arguments, defense attorney Lee Fugate
acknowledged that Kimball had been drinking and speeding when his
car hit the teen-agers on a dark dead-end street known as a hagout
for teen-agers.
   His car was traveling faster than 75 mph, and an hour after the
crash his blood-alcohol level was 0.2, twice the legal definition of
intoxication, prosecutors said.
   Skye said another prosecution witness would have testified that
after getting out of his car Kimball beat his fist on the ground and
said, ``There go the Olympics.''
   When Kimball went to Indianapolis to try out for the 1988 team,
members of Mothers Against Drunk Driving and victims' friends and
relatives gathered there and staged a silent protest.
   But after Wednesday's guilty plea, Dick Kimball, who coached his

decision. ``I am proud of him. I think it is something Bruce is
trying to face and I'm really sorry.''

<HEAD>National League Of Cities Survey Says Drugs And Housing Problems
Worsened</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Drugs and housing problems worsened in urban
America last year, and the shortage of affordable housing is the top
hindrance to local economic growth, a survey of municipal officials
said Thursday.
   The National League of Cities, releasing the findings of its
annual survey of local officials, criticized the Reagan
administration for major reductions in housing aid and for proposing
to end local assistance to fight drugs.
   ``The efforts of city leaders to fight drugs and crime, to
provide shelter and housing opportunities, to encourage investment
in jobs and to support the economic growth of their community,''
said Alan Beals, executive director of the league, are ``being
undermined by a `fend for yourself' philosophy that is irrational,
unconscionable and just plain wrong.''
   The league, which represents large and small municipalities
across the country, released the results of its survey of municipal
officials at a news conference. It surveyed 690 officials in 473
communities last month.
   Two-thirds of the town officials reported local drug problems had
worsened in 1988, and crime was described as worsening by 45 percent.
   ``In the face of unrelenting drug trafficking and drug-related
violence, the president wants to abolish funding for local drug
assistance,'' Beals said.
   Ranked next among worsening conditions was the affordability of
housing, affordability of rental housing, and homelessness. Forty
percent or more of the respondents reported a worsening in each of
those related categories.
   A majority, 51 percent, said the supply of affordable housing is
inadequate for growth _ ranking that problem ahead of roads,
education and other issues as impediments to economic development.
   Beals said President Reagan's budget proposal for fiscal 1990,
the federal fiscal year opening Oct. 1, would eliminate local
revenue bonds for housing, cut aid for the homeless in half, cut
low-income energy assistance by one-quarter, and make reductions in
spending for community development, rental rehabilitation and
low-income housing assistance.
   Despite the reported problems, more than half the officials
reported overall economic conditions improved in their cities in
1988, and nearly half said unemployment diminished.
   Two-thirds said they expected to hold the line on taxes in the
coming year, but 61 percent said they expected to raise fees and
other charges.
   Those surveyed included officials from cities and towns of all
sizes and regions. Some 47 percent of them were in the category of
small cities, with populations of 10,000 to 50,000.

<HEAD>Lab to Test Shelf Life of Condoms</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has hired a
laboratory to find out the shelf life of condoms exposed to various
climatic conditions.
   An estimated 5.5 billion condoms are produced each year
worldwide. They are used for birth control and prevention of
sexually transmitted diseases including AIDS.
   But because condoms are made of rubber, which deteriorates, they
could be ineffective if they aren't properly stored or distributed
quickly enough.
   The FDA has contracted with the Seattle-based Program for
Appropriate Technology and Health to examine condoms' shelf life.
   The three-year, $440,000 study will monitor the deterioration of
condoms exposed to heat, cold, humidity, light and air pollution.
   ``I'm not sure that any condom made in a large manufacturing
country is capable of withstanding developing-country
environments,'' said Jane Hutchings, a program officer with the
11-year-old non-profit research organization.
   Ms. Hutchings said little is known about what happens to condoms
after they leave the controlled conditions of a manufacturing plant.
She said boxes of U.S.-made condoms will be stored in different
climates worldwide and will be tested every six months.

<DATELINE>HUNTINGTON, Ind. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vice President-elect Dan Quayle's father
has turned his television set back on, but he said he and his wife
are still stinging from the slings and arrows flung at their son
during the presidential campaign.
   ``The untruths and distortions could have filled a 12-volume
encyclopedia,'' James C. Quayle told a hometown audience Wednesday.
   The elder Quayle, publisher of the Huntington Herald-Press, said
the family is still upset by media coverage of his son's selection
as President-elect George Bush's running mate, and of the campaign
that led to their election in November.
   ``I hope nobody at the Herald-Press does to you what the media
did to Dan,'' he told about 170 people at the Huntington Chamber of
Commerce dinner.
   Quayle said he and his wife, Corinne, developed a routine for
reading papers during the campaign. He would go out to the mailbox
and glance at the headlines. Then his wife would ask: ``Should I
read it?'' Often, he said, the answer was no.
   Quayle said he told a ``Nightline'' producer that he would not
talk to host Ted Koppel about their son's treatment by the media
because he and his wife were boycotting TV.
   ``We've turned our set back on, but only for Pat Buchanan (a
conservative commentator), the World Series and weather,'' he said
he told the producer.
   The Quayles received about 1,500 letters during the campaign,
most of them regarding their son's National Guard service and the
``you're no John Kennedy'' remark by Lloyd Bentsen, Michael Dukakis'
running mate, during the vice-presidential debate. Quayle said
responses on both were overwhelmingly in his son's favor.

   Investigators who saw an obituary on a murder
suspect's brother staked out the mortuary and arrested their man
when he showed up to view the body, police said today.
   Police arrested 37-year-old Donny G. Silcox on Wednesday in the
1973 slaying of 29-year-old John Paul Scott, a Canadian professor
whose body was found by a trucker last month in woods off a highway
in Carroll County, Miss.
   Police said Silcox confessed to the slaying when they found him
driving the victim's van a few weeks after Scott's disappearance. At
the time, Silcox accompanied police in the search for the body but
never was charged with murder because it wasn't found.
   Mississippi authorities issued a murder warrant for Silcox on
Tuesday after finding the remains. Silcox now faces extradition to
Mississippi.
   Police got a break after reading an obituary on the suspect's
brother, John Silcox, 39, who died Tuesday.
   Police said Silcox, who served a prison sentence for stealing
Scott's van and carrying a concealed weapon, reported that Scott had
picked up him up while he was hitch-hiking. Scott's skull contained
one bullet hole, authorities said.

<HEAD>Soviet Union Begins Its First Census in 10 Years</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 900,000 census-takers fanned out from
Siberia to the Baltic Sea on Thursday to start the first nationwide
head count of the Soviet Union's population in a decade.
   Data gathered during the eight-day census, including on Soviets'
education level, place of residence, ethnic group and language, will
be used ``to plan the main directions of the country's economic and
social development,'' the Communist Party daily Pravda said.
   The census is the first in the Soviet Union since 1979, when the
population was found to number 262.4 million. In January 1988,
government statisticians estimated the Soviet population at 284.5
million.
   In the next eight days, census-takers will call at Soviets'
homes, but will also comb railway stations, airports, trains,
planes, shops, hotels and hospitals to assure an accurate population
count, Pravda said.
   Foreigners who live in the Soviet Union will also be counted,
Pravda said.
   One-quarter of the Soviets polled will be asked to answer
additional questions, including where their workplace is located,
the time they've resided in their present home, its size and degree
of comfort, and how many children they have given birth to if they
are women, Pravda said.
   The census will also show the changing ethnic makeup of the
Soviet Union, Pravda said. Western demographers estimate the
country's Moslem nationalities, because of a higher birthrate, could
become a majority in the country by the end of the century.
   Pravda said preliminary results of the census are expected in
April, and more definitive data in the fall of 1990.
   The newspaper assured Soviets that the answers they given
census-takers will be kept confidential, and asked them to
attentively answer the questions they are asked.

<HEAD>No Major Progress Reported in Talks on U.S. Bases Agreement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Greek and American officials Thursday ended
another round of talks on U.S. military bases without making much
headway toward a new agreement, a government spokesman said.
   ``A disagreement of views continues to be observable even though
a deadlock was not noted,'' said Greek government spokesman Sotiris
Kostopoulos.
   A spokeswoman for the U.S. Embassy declined to comment on the
three-day talks.
   It was the first round of talks since a five-year operating
agreement for the four U.S. military installations expired Dec. 20.
Under the old accord, the United States has 17 months to negotiate a
new agreement or dismantle the bases.
   ``The talks were held, as in the past, in a serious and
professional climate and an exchange of views continued,''
Kostopoulos said.
   He said the talks, the 13th round since negotiations began in
November 1987, focused on the legal aspects of a ``possible'' new
agreement. He did not elaborate.
   He added, however, that negotiators were still at the
``preamble'' stage of a new accord.
   ``Discussion resumed on the preamble of a new agreement...which
has been under continuous processing during the negotiations,'' he
said
   The talks have made little progress because of the socialist
government's insistence that a new agreement provide assurances that
the United States will help solve the country's longtanding disputes
with neighboring Turkey. The two NATO allies have been at odds over
military control of the Aegean Sea, its seabed mineral rights and
the divided eastern Mediterranean island of Cyprus.
   U.S. officials say they don't want to involve regional politics
in the bilateral bases talks.
   Premier Andreas Papandreou, whose ruling Panhellenic Socialist
Movement has been rocked by series of financial scandals, is
expected to use the bases issue to attract leftist voters in the
upcoming June elections.
   In order to bolster public support, Papandreou has said he will
hold a national referendum on the bases and announced his intention
to scrap one of the installations: Hellenikon Air Force base
adjacent to Athens airport.
   Three other major bases have been operating here since the early
1950s _ another near Athens and two on the southern island of Crete.

   A fifth-grader was arrested and charged
with possession of cocaine after he was caught bringing crack
cocaine to school in his socks, police said.
   Police say two schoolmates reported the boy Tuesday to Jackson
Elementary School Principal Jim Rodgers after the child showed them
the drug.
   The unidentified 12-year-old boy had about a gram of crack with a
street value of about $25, said Capt. Ruffin Cain.
   The boy's fate largely will be up to state child-welfare
officials, said Larry Martin, an area director of schools. The boy
was being held at W.T. Edwards Detention Center in Tampa, pending a
juvenile hearing.
   Martin would not give more details of the arrest, citing concern
for the child, but he said such arrests are rare.
   Martin said the boy would be questioned about the source of the
drug, but thought it unlikely he got it at school.

   A cargo plane bound for Montreal with a small

takeoff early today, killing both crew members, authorities said.
   Witnesses said the plane, a twin-engine turboprop, went down in
woods a half-mile from Dayton International Airport, said James
Francis, the city's acting aviation director.
   Bradley First Air of Carp, Ontario, which owned the plane, said
the crew members were pilots from Montreal and Ottawa. Bradley First
was under contract to Emery Worldwide Freight to carry freight to
Montreal, Francis said.
   The plane was ``just going across the horizon, and then it just
blew. It was just a big ball of fire,'' said Gary Hess, an Emery
employee.
   The cause of the crash was not immediately known. Federal
Aviation Administration officials were sent to investigate.
   The plane carried explosive and corrosive materials, but no
evacuations were necessary, Francis said.
   Lt. Jim Bowell of the Butler Township Fire Department said the
4:45 a.m. accident set fire to about 100 yards of woods.
   Joe Weitz, another Emery employee, said, ``It appears as soon as
it took off and was banking ... it burst into flames just outside
the runway.''

   A T-shirt being sold at the U.S. Border
Patrol Museum has been removed after complaints that it was
emblazoned with an ethnic slur.
   The $10 shirt is black and shows a grinning Mexican whose foot is
thrust through a wire fence, with the slogan, ``Who Are You Going To
Call?'' in an apparent spoof of the movie ``Ghostbusters.''
   The shirt has a circle slashed diagonally by a bar printed over
the man wearing a wide-brimmed sombrero. In the movie
``Ghostbusters,'' the slashed circle was printed over a ghost, to
represent a ghost exterminating business.
   ``It's obviously racist. I detest the racist attitudes we have in
El Paso,'' said Robert Conner, a registered nurse and free-lance
writer who complained about the shirts to the Border Patrol and the
El Paso Times. ``I thought that was a particularly obnoxious
manifestation of it.''
   Gus De La Vina, Border Patrol deputy chief in El Paso said Terry
Cornell, the museum's director, had assured him Wednesday that the
shirts will be removed.
   ``I talked to (Cornell) and she said the shirts were not meant by
any means as a racial slur,'' De La Vina said. ``Somebody came up
with the shirts and they've been selling them, but no more T-shirts
will be available.''
   The museum was created by the Fraternal Order of Retired Border
Patrol Officers and opened to the public in October 1985. Border
Patrol agents support the museum with contributions, but the agency
doesn't sanction the sale of any items, De La Vina said.
   ``This is not a T-shirt put out by the Border Patrol or
sanctioned by the Border Patrol,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Morton Thiokol Inc. has tentatively
rescheduled its final full-scale test-firing of the redesigned space
shuttle booster rocket for Wednesday.
   The firing will be the sixth and last full-scale test to formally
qualify major design features of the 126-foot-long solid-fuel
rocket, Morton Thiokol spokesman Rocky Raab said Thursday.
   The new booster already has been used on two successful shuttle
missions.
   Raab said the test, initially set for Tuesday at the company's
plant 25 miles west of Brigham City, was delayed because engineers
said additional time was needed to adequately chill the solid-fuel
motor.
   The procedure is necessary to test the redesigned rocket's new
heating system properly.
   NASA ordered the rocket redesigned after a presidential
commission blamed a faulty seal on one of Challenger's boosters for
the Jan. 28, 1986, explosion that killed its seven-member crew.
   Investigators found that one of the Challenger booster's O-ring
joint seals failed to contain superhot gases during launch. The
gases ignited the shuttle's exterior fuel tank.
   The disaster grounded the nation's manned space flight program
until last fall, when NASA launched Discovery using revamped
boosters that included more and stronger O-rings.
   Morton Thiokol engineers examined the new O-rings after shuttle
launches on Sept. 29 and Dec. 2 and found them in excellent
condition, Raab said.

   Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. said today it has
asked former Securities and Exchange Commissionchairman John Shad to
become chairman of the Wall Street giant struggling to rebound from
a scandal raised by the SEC under Shad's leadership.
   The nation's fifth-largest securities firm also said it had
approached Roderick M. Hills, SEC chairman from 1975 to 1977, to
become a Drexel director. Hills, a trade consultant, is the husband
of Carla Hills, tapped by President-elect Bush to be U.S. trade
representative.
   Drexel said Chief Executive Officer Frederick Joseph,
instrumental in the firm's record $650 million settlement last month
of securities-fraud charges, would continue in that role. There had
been rumors he might resign.
   The announcements appeared to reflect an effort by Drexel's
senior management to distance the firm as much as possible from the
Wall Street insider trading scandal that has entangled it since late
1986.
   ``The firm's objective is to develop a fresh outlook on the
problems and opportunities it faces, and to continue to make an
important contribution to the nation's capital markets,'' Drexel
said in a statement disclosing the job offers.
   Leonardo Williams, information officer for the U.S. Embassy at
the Hague, Netherlands, where Shad is ambassador, confirmed in a
telephone query that he'd ``been approached by Drexel Burnham about
becoming chairman of the board.''
   Neither Williams nor Drexel would comment on a report in The New
York Times today that quoted unidentified sources as saying Shad was
close to accepting a Drexel offer.
   It was not clear whether Hills would accept the Drexel
invitation. A receptionist at the Manchester Group Ltd., a
Washington-based consulting firm of which Hills is chairman, said he
was out of the office.
   Shad ran the SEC when it began a fraud probe of Drexel more than
two years ago after speculator Ivan Boesky implicated the firm in
his illegal acts.
   That probe resulted in SEC securities-fraud charges against
Drexel as well as a record $650 million plea bargain with the U.S.
attorney's office last month.
   The firm has been seeking a well-known and respected figure to
take the chairman's job as part of an effort to recover from its
legal ordeal.
   Shad is credited with strengthening the agency's efforts to
reduce insider trading and other abuses on Wall Street. He resigned
in 1987 after a six-year tenure to accept the ambassador's post.
   Word that Shad had been approached came a day after Drexel said
it had agreed to end talks with former Sen. Howard Baker about a
possible role for the former White House chief of staff in the
firm's senior management.
   Baker had been negotiating with Drexel since November about a
senior role in the management of the nation's fifth-biggest
securities firm, possibly as chairman.
   His involvement was seen as part of a possible Drexel strategy to
minimize the impact of criminal charges that were then expected
against the firm and some of its key employees.
   The announcement came as Drexel and the SEC worked to settle a
civil suit filed by the agency against the firm in September. The
settlement of criminal charges was reached Dec. 21 but is not final
until resolution of the SEC suit.
   Drexel officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
talks might be completed in a few days. SEC spokeswoman Mary McCue
declined to comment.
   The government investigation into Drexel's financial dealings
began more than two years ago after now-imprisoned speculator Ivan
Boesky turned state's evidence and implicated the firm in his
illegal acts.
   Drexel denied wrongdoing until last month, when it was threatened
with possibly crippling charges of racketeering unless it agreed to
plead guilty to lesser charges.
   Under its settlement agreement, Drexel will plead guilty to six
unspecified felonies, pay a record $650 million in fines and
restitution and cooperate in the government's crackdown on
securities fraud.

<HEAD>Businessman To Give Free Bikes To Kids Who Improve Grades, Attendance</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A businessman whose efforts at philanthropy once
were rebuffed by an entire school has turned to bicycles as a way to
peddle education.
   Frank Argenbright is offering 1,500 students at 22 Atlanta
elementary schools free bicycles if they improve their attendance,
behavior and grades.
   ``To me, it will be a real ego thing for these kids to show off
those bikes,'' said Argenbright, chief executive officer of the
security and transportation firm Argenbright Inc. ``They'll have
worked hard to earn them.''
   Schools were chosen for their low or declining test scores, and
only students who aren't living up to their potential will be
offered a chance to earn a new bicycle.
   The principal and teachers at each of the participating schools
will select students for the program and will draw up a personal
challenge for each child, specifying what changes in attendance,
academic achievement and discipline must be demonstrated in order to
earn the bicycle.
   ``These are our students with the greatest potential to
improve,'' said Atlanta Superintendent J. Jerome Harris.
   ``I think this is an excellent program that will have a needed
impact on the students,'' said Kimberly Elementary School Principal
Effie Turner. ``Our underachievers and those children who are
overlooked or who are continually posing problems need that extra
incentive and this appears to be the answer.''
   The program will be launched at the Atlanta Civic Center on Jan.
19, and the students' progress will be monitored weekly.
   Argenbright promised to pay the administrative costs of the
program and chip in at least $5,000 toward the purchase of the
bicycles. He will try to raise another $100,000 from large
corporations.
   Argenbright hopes his latest plan will be more popular than last
year's offer of a free college education to each graduate of Madison
High School in his hometown of Madison, Fla. He flew 40 Madison
students to Morris Brown College in Atlanta to tour the city and
campus.
   ``And then not one single student even bothered to fill out the
application'' to attend Morris Brown, he said.

is to exchange views on economic issues and for the 35 participating
nations to learn more about their economies, spokesman Charles E.
Redman said.
   However, Redman said, the meeting will not be a forum for
negotiations between East and West, nor will it deal with Western
controls on trade in strategic items.
   A final decision is expected before the 35 nations conclude their
review of the 1975 Helsinki agreement in Vienna. In all, 11
follow-up conferences have been proposed. Redman said the United
States wanted to scale the number down.
   The United States, Canada, the Soviet Union and 32 European
countries agreed in Helsinki to expand human, political and economic
contacts between East and West.

<HEAD>Rival Shiites Fight For Fifth Day; Israel Raids Base</HEAD>

   A pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem militia
entrenched on a mountaintop turned back a rival faction in fierce
fighting Thursday in southern Lebanon.
   West of the battle in Jbaa, Israeli warplanes bombed a
Palestinian base it said was used for planning a staging terrorist
attacks.
   Thursday marked the fifth straight day of fighting in the latest
battle between the pro-Syrian Amal militia and the Iranian-backed
Hezbollah, or Party of God.
   Police said Amal lost five combatants in an aborted attack to
capture the mountain village of Jbaa, 10 miles southeast of Sidon.
   A police spokesman said seven Amal militiamen also were injured
in the attempt to storm Hezbollah positions.
   A police spokesman said there was no report on Hezbollah's
possible casualties in Jbaa, the key to a triangular-shaped enclave
on the western edge of Israel's self-proclaimed ``security zone'' in
south Lebanon. About 500 Hezbollah fighters held the spot.
   The new casualties brought the overall toll to 112 killed and 227
wounded in the fighting since Sunday.
   Four Israeli warplanes, meanwhile, attacked a base of Palestinian
Abu Nidal's Fatah-Revolutionary Council faction in the Majdalyoun
valley before dawn.
   The police spokesman, who cannot be identified in line with
police rules, said two of the jets fired four rockets into the base,
located about four miles east of Sidon.
   Ambulances evacuated the wounded, but a casualty count was not
available.
   The Fatah Revolutionary Council is ``clever in hiding their
losses. It is very difficult to estimate their casualties,'' the
police spokesman said.
   Smoke billowed from the base, which Israeli warplanes also bombed
Wednesday night along with another council stronghold in the nearby
village of Bkusta in Israel's first air attack into Lebanon this
year.
   Israel said its jets returned safely.
   The battle between the Shiite factions is the fourth major
confrontation since April for control of Lebanon's 1 million
Shiites, the nation's largest sect.
   By police count, 388 people were killed and 1,209 wounded in the
previous three rounds of fighting.
   Hezbollah seeks to create an Islamic republic in Lebanon
patterned after Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's regime in Iran.
   The more secular Amal rejects Iran's spiritual influence over
Lebanon's Shiites and favors a multi-sect government with Moslems
sharing power equally with Christians.
   Amal called a general strike for Friday in predominantly Shiite
areas of Lebanon to protest what it called ``Hezbollah's new
Nazism.''
   Amal was referring to atrocities committed by Hezbollah fighters
in an attack against Jbaa and four other villages in the region
Sunday.
   Police said both groups have committed ``horrific atrocities'' in
their current confrontation. Victims from both factions have been
found with their heads chopped off or their bodies otherwise maimed.
   The police spokesman said the vanguard of a 1,000-strong Amal
force attacking from the west, southwest and south reached Jbaa
early in the day Thursday, ``but was pushed back by Hezbollahis in
fierce fighting.''
   Amal pulled its attackers back to nearby villages in tanks and
armored personnel carriers behind a heavy artillery cover, the
spokesman said.
   An Amal commander in Sidon, identified only by his code-name of
Abu Jamal, confirmed that the attack failed.
   ``Jbaa is a mountain peak. Our fighters are in the valleys and we
have to climb up to the Hezbollahis. This is not an easy task,'' he
said.
   Abu Jamal said his forces blocked all supply lines to the
nine-square-mile enclave, which stretches southeast from Jbaa to the
nearby hamlets of Ein Bouswar and Louwaizeh and the wooded slopes of
Mount Safi.
   ``We will besiege them for a while, until they run out of
supplies and ammunition and then try again. We don't want to
sacrifice our fighters in a battle than we can win easily after a
while,'' he said.

<HEAD>Inspectors Find No Fault in Warning Systems of Other Craft</HEAD>

   Investigators got a first look at the engines from
a crashed Boeing 737 on Thursday, and British airlines flying
similar craft said they found no evidence of faults in the engine
warning systems.
   The engines from the British Midland Boeing 737-400 that crashed
Sunday were removed from an embankment along a freeway near the town
of Kegworth and taken to nearby East Midlands Airport.
   The plane, bound for Belfast, Northern Ireland, crashed while
trying an emergency landing at the airport, killing 44 people and
injuring 82.
   Investigators are trying to determine why the plane's apparently
working right engine was turned off during the flight when later
examination showed it was the left engine that caught fire.
Speculations have focused on a faulty engine warning system and crew
error.
   Most of the wreckage will be reassembled at the Royal Aircraft
Establishment at Farnborough, said Ed Trimble, a senior inspector
from the Department of Transport Air Accidents Investigation Branch.
   The engines, however, will be taken to Paris for detailed
inspection by the manufacturer following a preliminary inspection at
East Midlands Airport, he said.
   ``We must await a full strip inspection of both engines. That's
most important,'' Trimble said.
   On Wednesday, the Civil Aviation Authority ordered British
airlines using Boeing 737s and Airbus A320s equipped with the
U.S.-French CFM56 engine to inspect the fire and vibration warning
systems for ``left-right sense.''
   Those checks were completed Thursday by six airlines, and none
found any problems. The aviation authority also ordered more
frequent inspections of the engines built by CFM, a joint venture of
SNECMA of France and General Electric of the United States.
   The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration also has ordered checks
of the warning systems of 300 Boeing 737s operated by U.S. carriers.
Unlike the British agency, however, the FAA did not order more
frequent engine inspections.
   Fred Farrar, a spokesman for the FAA in Washington, said there
had been ``very, very isolated incidents'' of cross-wiring of
warning systems in U.S. aircraft. But he said none had led to an
accident.
   The Air Accidents Investigation Branch said Wednesday it obtained
evidence early in the investigation that both engines ``might have
suffered a related failure.''
   The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board said there have
been two crashes involving double failures of CFM56 engines. In both
cases, foul weather was a contributing factor, but that was not an
element in the British Midland disaster.
   The Times of London reported Thursday that investigators believed
the disaster began shortly after takeoff from Heathrow Airport with
the failure of the No. 3 bearing in the left engine, which created
vibration and intense heat.
   As the captain throttled back on the damaged engine to prepare
for an emergency landing, The Times said the vibration would have
ceased, and _ if the right engine had been shut down _ could have
disguised the fact that the wrong engine had been turned off.
   The Times said investigators believe that the No. 3 bearing, just
behind the engine's high-pressure compressor, broke down completely
as the aircraft made its final approach, leaving the 737 without
power.
   The newspaper said investigators believe that faulty wiring led
to a false warning that the right engine, not the left, was on fire.
However, it said the plugs that attach the warning circuits to
cockpit levers are designed to prevent right and left from being
accidentally swapped, and there was no indication how a false
warning could have been given.
   A Tranport Department spokesman refused to comment on the
newspaper's report.
   The first funerals for crash victims were held Thursday in
Belfast. Denis Maloney, 65, and his wife Pearl, 59, ``were always
together in life, and their bodies were found together in death.
They died in each other's arms,'' the Rev. Aidan Kerr said at a
Requiem Mass at St. Brigid's Roman Catholic Church.

<TEXT>
   Marine commanders have brought charges
against a lieutenant and two sergeants in the death of a soldier who
had been left behind in the Mojave Desert during a training
exercise, the Marine Corps said today.
   Earlier this week, the top two commanders of the soldier's
battalion were relieved of command over the death of Lance Cpl.
Jason Rother, 19, of Minneapolis. He was left behind Aug. 30 and
died of heat stroke.
   The military today said it has ordered a court-martial against
First Lt. Allen V. Lawson, who was in charge of posting Rother as a
road guide for the exercise, on charges of disobeying an order,
dereliction of duty and conduct unbecoming an officer.
   Lawson has been accused of disobeying orders to pair Rother with
another Marine instead of posting him alone.
   In addition, Sgt. Christopher Clyde, Rother's platoon sergeant,
and Sgt. Thomas Turnell, Rother's squad leader, were charged with
offenses including dereliction of duty and disobeying an order, the
Marine Corp said.
   Clyde was accused of disobeying orders not to grant leave to
Turnell the day the exercise ended; the squad leader's absence
resulted in a day's delay in noticing Rother's absence, authorities
said.
   Earlier charges against Clyde were withdrawn Wednesday after his
lawyer argued that the commander who convened the court-martial was
himself disciplined in the case.
   Marine investigators said that Rother built a shelter from the
desert sun during the exercise that originated at the Marine base at
Twentynine Palms, Calif., but died after the temperature reached 107
degrees.

   Anzio, Normandy, and Jimmy Doolittle's ``Thirty
Seconds Over Tokyo'' _ World War II terms that probably mean nothing
to many Americans _ were cited by President Reagan in a farewell
address that cautioned his countrymen against forgetting their
history.
   Reagan urged building patriotism through better knowledge of
history.
   ``If we forget what we did, we won't know who we are,'' he said
in his broadcast Wednesday night. ``I am warning of an eradication
of the American memory that could result ultimately in an erosion of
the American spirit.''
   He specifically mentioned ``why the pilgrims came'' to America
from Europe in the 17th century in quest of religious freedom, ``who
Jimmy Doolittle was, and what those 30 seconds over Tokyo meant,''
as well as the battle at Anzio, Italy, and the landing at Normandy,
France.
   Those examples of American derring-do and heroism may mean little
to the 69 percent of the American population born since the end of
World War II.
   The details:
   _``Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo'' _ An America demoralized by the
surprise and destructive Japanese attack on American forces at Pearl
Harbor, Hawaii, on Dec. 7, 1941, and the subsequent heavy losses to
the Japanese in the first months of the war was electrified by news
of the first U.S. bombing raid of Tokyo and other Japanese cities.
The country finally had something to cheer about.
   The daring raid occurred on April 18, 1942. Lt. Col. James
Doolittle led 16 B-25 ``Mitchell'' bombers. First word came from
Tokyo Radio, but confirmation came a month later from President
Franklin D. Roosevelt, who said the planes took off from
``Shangri-La'' _ a fictitious place _ but later it was disclosed
that they had taken off from the deck of an aircraft carrier, the
USS Hornet. The raid, in addition to bolstering American morale,
slowed the Japanese offensive.
   Later, Doolittle, a former stunt flyer, flight teacher and
aeronautics pioneer, was awarded the Medal of Honor. The term ``30
Seconds Over Tokyo'' was the title of a popular movie about the raid.
   _Anzio _ The Anzio beachhead, 33 miles south of Rome, saw some of
the bloodiest fighting of World War II and accounted for many of the
10,000 U.S. battle deaths in Italy the first half of 1944. Anzio was
a bloody way station on the road to Rome.
   _Normandy _ The site, on the Atlantic coast of France, of the
Allied invasion by land, sea and air of the European mainland which
started June 6, 1944. After bitter fighting, the Nazis retreated.
The landing began the climactic stage of the war on the West
European front, the drive from the Atlantic to the German homeland,
culminating in the Nazi surrender the following year.
   Reagan recalled that on the 40th anniversary of the Normandy
landings he read a letter from a young woman whose late father had
fought at Omaha Beach, a Normandy sector.
   The writer, Lisa Zanatta Henn, ``said, we will always remember,
we will never forget, what the boys of Normandy did,'' Reagan noted,
adding, ``Well, let's help her keep her word.''
   Reagan said Americans who are 35 and older ``grew up in a
different America'' where they learned to love and appreciate their
country either from school, their own family or ``from the
neighborhood, from the father down the street who fought in Korea or
the family who lost someone at Anzio.''

<HEAD>Public Interest Groups Blast NRC Proposal</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two public interest groups on Thursday assailed
a Nuclear Regulatory Commission proposal that would exempt very
low-level radioactive waste from federal regulations.
   ``The NRC does not have the right to increase anyone's
involuntary risks,'' said Diane D'Arrigo, speaking for the Nuclear
Information and Resource Service, a Washington-based group.
   She contended that the commission's proposal ``ignores the
growing number of health studies that indicate that low doses of
radiation increase the health risks of those exposed.''
   The NRC has proposed to exempt from federal regulations low-level
waste that would expose people to 10 millirems of radiation a year _
approximately the same amount of radiation involved in a whole-mouth
dental X-ray.
   If finally adopted, the new rule would enable atomic power plants
and other users of nuclear materials to dispose of such low-level
radioactive waste as ordinary refuse shipped to incinerators or land
fills.
   Ms. D'Arrigo told an NRC staff panel at a public meeting in
suburban Bethesda, Md., that ``part of the responsibility for using
radioactive materials for any purpose is keeping them from harming
or potentially harming anyone _ in this generation and in future
generations.''
   ``Those who operate nuclear power stations and those who produce
radioactive consumer products must be required to do whatever it
takes, at whatever the cost, to keep the radiation they generate out
of the lives and environments of those who choose not to increase
their risk by exposure,'' she said.
   Also criticizing the proposed change was another anti-nuclear
group, the Environmental Coalition on Nuclear Power. Judith
Johnsrud, speaking for the coalition, asserted that ``all exposures
to ionizing radiation may have deleterious genetic or somatic (body)
effects.''
   On this issue, she said, ``prudence and conservatism are
essential to serve the public interest.''
   Speakers endorsing the NRC proposal included Lauriston S. Taylor,
representing the Health Physics Society, an organization of
physicians and scientists involved with radiation biology and
medicine.
   Taylor said that ``extremely costly protective measures'' are
currently required by ``regulatory control of very low-level
radiation exposures that are believed to be well below the need of
regulation.''
   ``If this is allowed to continue, estimates of future costs in
unnecessary parts of programs of waste management and site cleanup
have been estimated to range into billions of dollars,'' he said.

   Sikhs waging a separatist war in Punjab
killed 36 people, hanging four in revenge for the executions of two
Sikhs convicted in the assassination of Prime Minister Indira
Gandhi, police said Thursday.
   The two Sikhs were hanged Jan. 6 for the murder of Mrs. Gandhi,
who was shot down Oct. 31, 1984, by Sikh members of her personal
bodyguard. Militants have been fighting since 1982 for an
independent Sikh nation in Punjab, the only Indian state where the
sect has a majority.
   Police superintendent Govind Ram said the headman of Bhujiawali
village and his three brothers, all Hindus, were kidnapped Wednesday
night by a raiding party of five Sikhs and found hanging from trees
the next morning.
   He said a handwritten note claimed responsibility for an
underground Sikh militia and threatened more hangings of Hindus in
revenge for the executions of Satwant Singh and Kehar Singh at the
Tihar Central Jail in New Delhi.
   Others killed Thursday were a Hindu couple and their two
daughters and another Hindu couple; Sikh farmer Fakir Singh, his son
and nephew, and seven others killed in separate attacks, police
reported.
   Police in Chandigarh, the state capital, said 16 more people were
reported killed Wednesday night, including other relatives of the
hanged village headman and his brothers.
   Most victims of the Sikh radicals are Hindus, but they also
attack moderate Sikhs who oppose the separatist campaign.
   The latest deaths bring the number of people killed in Punjab so
far this year to more than 90. At least 2,400 people were killed in
1988.
   Although they have a majority in Punjab, a northern state that
includes India's richest agrucultural land, Sikhs make up less than
2 percent of this predominantly Hindu nation's 800 million people.
Those fighting for independence claim discrimination by the Hindus.

   U.S. Customs agents today arrested a
Korean-born naturalized citizen in an alleged international
conspiracy to buy and export missiles and nerve-gas weapons from the
United States, officials said.
   A complaint filed in U.S. District Court identified the man as
Juwhan Yun, also known as J.W. Yun, 48, president of Komex
International Corp. of Short Hills. The nature of the business was
not immediately available.
   Yun awaited arraignment today on charges of conspiracy to export
500-pound bombs of a deadly nerve gas known as sarin, said Richard
Mercier, agent in charge of the Customs office in Newark.
   Mercier would not say where or how Yun allegedly intended to ship
the gas.
   Mercier said Yun negotiated with an undercover Customs agent to
purchase the bombs. Yun and conspirators also tried to acquire TOW I
and TOW II missiles, Stinger missiles and Varian radar tubes,
according to the complaint.
   If convicted, Yun could receive up to five years in prison and a
$250,000 fine.
   Sarin attacks the central nervous system, quickly causing
convulsions and death. Mercier described the gas as a ``very rapid,
odorless, colorless poison which can enter the body by inhalation,
absorption or injection.''
   Also named in the complaint was Charles Caplan of Britain, who
was described in court documents as the operator of Domino
Associates in London.
   Authorities said Caplan had approached Yun on Jan. 6. Yun later
met with Caplan and two other people in a London hotel, the
complaint. The identities of the others were not immediately known.
   Yun later discussed with the undercover agent the shipment of
nerve-gas bombs from the Port of Baltimore, the complaint said.
   A man who answered the telephone at Komex offices today refused
to comment and hung up.
   Yun's arrest in Newark was the culmination a seven-month
investigation, authorities said.

<HEAD>Reagan Expands Quota For Refugees From Soviet Union And Eastern Europe</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan will increase this fiscal
year's quota of Soviet and Eastern European refugees by 7,000 by
lowering the quota of Vietnamese refugees, many of whom are former
political prisoners unable to emigrate, the State Department said
Thursday.
   The decision brings to 25,000 the number of Soviets who will be
permitted to enter this country. While the added slots will be taken
mostly from the quota for refugees from Vietnam, U.S. officials
stressed the president has considerable flexibility to alter the
totals later on.
   A high ceiling was set for Vietnam with the expectation of a
major exodus of Vietnamese who had been detained in ``re-education
camps,'' Redman said. But, he said, the United States was unable to
reach an agreement with Hanoi about processing. As a result, Redman
said, the slots would be reallocated to Eastern Europe and the
Soviet Union.
   Nearly 40,000 slots are available for Vietnamese, he said.
``There is no shortage of refugee or immigration numbers available
to Vietnamese who wish to emigrate to the U.S.,'' Redman said. ``The
only shortages are the exit permits issued by Vietnamese
authorities.''
   Last year, only 2,500 exit permits were issued in Vietnam, he
said.
   Thousands of Soviet refugees, many of them Jews, are in Vienna
and Rome, waiting for permission to come to the United States, and
the quota for them to enter this country is full.
   Additionally, in Moscow, an average of 100 applicants a day
approach the U.S. embassy. Redman said two employees of the U.S.
Immigration and Naturalization Service would go to Moscow to help
handle the processing.
   The Reagan administration, after pressuring the Soviet Union to
step up Jewish emigration, has found itself in a paradoxical
position.
   The Jewish exodus is at a nine-year high. The United States finds
itself unable to process all those who left the Soviet Union with
exit permits for Israel but who sought entry here once they reached
Vienna and Rome.
   ``The ceilings are not set in concrete,'' a U.S. official said
Wednesday, demanding anonymity. He explained that over the eight
months left in the current fiscal year, the ceilings can be adjusted
by the president and Congress to meet changing situations.
   Soviet Jews were routinely admitted as political refugees, but
late last year the Reagan administration required individuals to
prove they were the specific victims of persecution. Otherwise, they
were forced to compete for the available slots with other refugees
from the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.

<HEAD>Court Throws Out Attempt To Remove Black Squatters</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A court on Thursday ruled in
favor of 500 black squatters from a tiny Atlantic Ocean town who
have been fighting an eviction order for the past year.
   Cape Town Supreme Court Judge J.H. Berman refused to give Port
Nolloth municipal authorities the right to forcibly remove the
squatters, who live in shacks and tents.
   ``Such an order, if granted, contemplated the possibility of a
forcible removal of a large number of women and children to be
dumped in the desert immediately outside the boundaries of Port
Nolloth, without shelter,'' Berman said in his ruling.
   Port Nolloth officials last year authorized themselves to remove
the squatters, saying there was no land in the town where blacks
could live legally. All residential areas in South Africa are
segregated by race, and no black neighborhood has been established
in Port Nolloth.
   The black community, however, took the officials to court and won
an interim order allowing them to stay prior to Berman's ruling
Thursday.
   Port Nolloth authorities have not said where they want the
squatters to go. The nearest black township is more than 300 miles
away.
   Some of the blacks have lived in Port Nolloth since 1980, and
additional squatters migrated from nearby Namibia last year.
   Only a few thousand people live in Port Nolloth, one of the few
towns in the semi-arid landscape that makes up the northwest corner
of South Africa. Most of its residents work in the fishing or mining
industry.
   An estimated 3.5 million blacks have been forcibly removed by the
South African government during the past four decades.
   The government has said it no longer stages forced removals for
political reasons, but may do so for health purposes or to prevent
illegal squatting.

   No one quite knows why a Democrat with no
ties to George Bush got invited to his Jan. 20 inauguration, but the
lucky lady says she's putting the gift tickets in her pocket and
heading for the festivities.
   Mary Campbell, a former Democratic member of the Clover Town
Council, got the unasked-for tickets in the mail last month.
   It's only a guess, but her name may have something to do with the
mystery.
   Gov. Carroll Campbell and President-elect Bush, both Republicans,
are friends and political allies.
   Campbell, who is going to the inauguration, asked that his sister
Mary, who lives in Rock Hill, be mailed tickets as well.
   The sister, whose married name is Mary Carpenter, didn't get the
tickets. So the governor called for replacements for her.
   Tony Denny, executive director of the state Republican Party,
said he didn't know of any mix-up, but that Mary Campbell of Clover
is free to keep her tickets.
   ``Of course she is,'' he said. ``I don't know her, but I hope she

   A team of wool wizards clipped, spun and
wove their way to victory turning a sheep's wool into a shawl in 107
minutes using techniques artisans used centuries ago.
   ``We have a good team, everybody worked well together,''
breathless team captain Carolyn Peyser said Wednesday night when the
judges announced the winner in the Pennsylvania Farm Show's Sheep to
Shawl contest.
   After buying the shawl for $1,600, Darryl Breniser of Blue Ball,
said the approximately 2-by-5 foot shawl was worth the money.
   ``It was a fair price,'' he said. ``They worked hard for it.''
   The team earned about $14.95 per minute of work on the shawl.
   The Wool Wizards of Dauphin County beat out eight other teams of
five.
   The contest began when nine shearers armed with snapping electric
razors unceremoniously hauled a sheep between their legs, waited for
the starting signal and began shaving the animal bald. Chris Herr,
shearer for the winning Wool Wizards, finished his sheep first in
about 2{ minutes.
   The workers then carded the wool, brushing it with paddles so the
fibers lay in one direction, worked it into yarn on a spinning
wheel, and finally wove it into a shawl on a wooden frame loom.

   A billboard featuring a punk ``tooth
fairy'' has been put up by an artist who proposes building a huge
molar in the Grand River to honor the first city to fluoridate its
drinking water.
   The $550 billboard, put up Tuesday night, seeks support for
``Operation: Pearly White,'' of a proposed 600-pound, 18-foot-long
abstract sculpture of a fiberglass tooth balanced atop a stainless
steel pole 22 feet above the river, near downtown.
   Mark Heckman proposed his sculpture in June.
   But the West Michigan Dental Society objects to the sculpture,
contending a symbol of an extracted tooth may perpetuate stereotypes
linking dentistry to pain.
   ``The billboard's got a big-time wrestler'' posing as the tooth
fairy, Heckman said. ``He's got pink, spiked hair with a big white
tooth earring. He's a bad dude, 6-3, 230 pounds solid. The billboard
says `Tooth or Consequences' and says `Support Operation: Pearly
White.'''
   Heckman said Wednesday he's raising money for his sculpture, but
wouldn't say how much. The billboard will be in place for 10 days to
two weeks, he said.

<HEAD>Pentagon Stages Elaborate Ceremony To Salute Departing Commander-In-Chief</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ANDREWS AIR FORCE BASE, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pentagon summoned its
four-star officers, the Marine Band and a 21-gun salute to stage an
elaborate ceremony Thursday for a departing commander-in-chief, but
kept the cost a military secret.
   With Marines in camouflage battle dress standing by under the
wing of an Air Force strategic bomber, President Reagan, the
military commander-in-chief, received a farewell salute from the
nation's armed forces and told the men and women in uniform: ``You
are America's pride.''
   At the ceremony in a new hangar built for the next Air Force One,
the presidential aircraft, Reagan stood misty-eyed as the Marine
Band, after playing the traditional Marine Hymn, followed with a
rendition of ``Auld Lang Syne.''
   The unusual review was to have been held outdoors and include
flyovers of 17 aircraft from all the services plus the Coast Guard.
It was forced inside by a chilly rain. The flyovers were called off.
   The cost of the patriotic farewell was as elusive as a military
secret. The Pentagon had said Wednesday that it could not estimate
the cost ``at this time'' and would not count the expense of
aircraft performances in any event.
   ``Since the fly-by is being conducted using normal operational
flying training hours, no additional costs will be incurred by the
services,'' the Pentagon said. ``Funding of the salute will be
absorbed by each of the services,'' it added.
   First lady Nancy Reagan was also invited but stayed home because
of laryngitis that has dogged her since before she and the president
returned from a California vacation on Jan. 5.
   Reagan told the estimated 1,400 government officials, members of
the armed services and other guests that the first lady, ``who
unfortunately is ill and has no voice, tried to get up and get here
and I sent her back to bed.''
   The 45-minute ceremony began with the firing of a 21-gun salute
outside the hangar.
   Secretary of Defense Frank C. Carlucci then presented the
Department of Defense Medal for Distinguished Public Service to the
president, telling him, ``You have restored our nation's pride in
itself and the nation's armed forces' pride in our uniform.''
   Carlucci also presented medals from the four armed services
within the Defense Department, as well as the Coast Guard.
   Adm. William Crowe, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
thanked the president ``for the legacy of strength you are leaving
to our next commander-in chief'' after President-elect Bush takes
over on Jan. 20.
   Reagan interrupted his own eight-minute speech to lead the crowd
in a moment of silence for 595 members of the armed services who
have died in the line of duty in the last eight years.
   ``They volunteered; they chose to serve; they gave their lives;
they are our heroes,'' he said.
   He did not call the moment of silence a prayer, but he bowed his
head, closed his eyes and ended by saying, ``Amen.''
   Addressing the living in the armed forces, he said that ``the
credit _ the gratitude of a nation comfortable and at peace _
properly goes, not to me, but rather to all of you.''
   ``You come from the Southwest and the Northeast, from the Rockies
and Adirondacks, from the inner cities and the most remote of
farms,'' he said. ``You come from America, and you are America's
pride.''
   ``Over the last eight years, the luster has been restored to the
reputation of our fighting forces, after a time during which it was
shamefully fashionable to deride and even condemn service such as
yours,'' Reagan told the assembly.
   ``Those days will never come again,'' he said, to thunderous
applause.
   ``But it is not just your fellow Americans who owe you a debt,''
the president said. ``Because we remained strong, because we acted
when we believed we had to, in the last eight years, not one inch of
ground on this earth fell under communist control.''
   Following his farewell address from the Oval Office Wednesday
night, the salute was one of a series of sentiment-laden events for
the president that will culminate in his return to California as a
private citizen next week.
   To the left of the speakers on the platform in the 14-story
hangar, Marines in camouflage paint and fatigues flanked one of the
Air Force's new B-1B bombers.
   Elsewhere stood jet fighters, helicopters, an Army M-1A tank and
one of the E-4B aerial command post planes that stand by in case of
war _ all part of the trillion-dollar military build-up that Reagan
has made a point of pride in his administration.
   Carlucci's predecessor, Caspar Weinberger, was on hand and
greeted Reagan as he sat down to watch a military review that began
with a display by the Army's Colonial Fife and Drum Corps dressed in
Revolutionary War garb and included a color guard of the combined
armed services and Coast Guard.
   Every four-star general and admiral was invited to attend.

<TEXT>
   Proposed cuts in next year's school
budget have unleashed a tempest of opposition, with one 11-year-old
pupil reported to suggest that the finance minister ``should go hang
himself.''
   Expressen, the country's highest-circulation daily, ran the quote
in bold type. It said it was quoting an 11-year-old it identified as
Calle, one of hundreds of students who wrote to the daily papers to
complain of a proposed reductions in next year's school budget.
   Education exploded into a political drama when Finance Minister
Kjell-Olof Feldt, one of Sweden's most popular leaders, targeted
schools for spending reductions in the 1989-90 budget package
presented to Parliament this week.
   Trimming the education budget was Feldt's latest move to hold the
line on wages and put a lid on inflation, now running at more than 6
percent, well above the European average.
   Sweden's taxes have long been among the highest in the world, and
generous education benefits are a big part of what the taxes buy.
   On Wednesday, 12,000 primary and high-school students marched
through downtown Stockholm to Parliament. Some climbed up on window
ledges and overturned flowerpots, chanting ``Stop Feldt!''
   Opposition to Feldt's governing Social Democrats united in
Parliament and threatened to kill the budget legislation.
   Feldt said teachers' salaries went up last year by more than the
5.6 percent ceiling set by Parliament and that schools should take
into account a falling number of students.
   Primary school teachers' salaries start at $1,400 monthly, and
college-trained teachers with 15 years of experience earn $2,267,
near the average national income.
   Critics charge that the planned cut of $27 million from
education, or 0.5 percent of its budget, ignored a crisis resulting
from 10 years of insufficent government allocations.
   They say school buildings are falling into disrepair, tattered
textbooks are handed from one class to the next, and qualified
teachers are abandoning education for better-paid jobs in industry.
   The protesters demand a limit of 20 pupils per class, newer
books, better food in schools, and a doubling of the monthly
government stipend to each student from the current $78.
   Feldt's proposals are part of his broad efforts to keep the
Swedish budget in shape. In seven years as finance minister, he has
wiped out a huge annual deficit to give Sweden its first surplus
budget since 1962, often through policies that go against the
socialist leanings of his party.
   He has proposed a sweeping reform to simplify taxes, plug
deduction loopholes and reduce tax on overtime payments.
   At the same time, Feldt has been unable to buck the tide in his
party for more benefits and leisure time for workers.
   The Social Democrats have promised six weeks annual vacation for
everyone. They have pledged to extend parental leave for new parents
_ mother or father _ from nine months with full pay to 12 months
this year and 18 months in 1990.
   The school crisis has prompted Claes-Goran Kjellander, political
editor of the conservative Svenska Dagbladet, to question Swedes'
favorable attitude toward Feldt and his predecessors.
   ``They raise our taxes, they spend our money for unnecessary
things, and cut the grants for things we think are important. This
is repeated year after year. The more it's repeated, the better we
like them,'' he wrote.
   The pupil identified as Calle was reported to hold other notions.
   After Feldt complained that Expressen reached ``the lowest point
of Swedish journalism'' by using the schoolboy to attack his draft
budget, Expressen put this response from Calle on its front page:
   ``Hey, Kjell-Olof Feldt: You know you don't really have to hang
yourself. I only meant, for example, `Go throw yourself against a
wall.' You are making a booboo.''

   Benazir Bhutto came home Thursday from
her first trip abroad as prime minister, a pilgrimage to Moslem holy
sites during which she discussed Afghanistan and the Middle East
with King Fahd of Saudi Arabia.
   Ms. Bhutto, the first woman to lead a Moslem nation, did not say
whether she and Fahd would press Afghan guerrillas for a political
settlement before the Feb. 15 deadline for withdrawal of Soviet
forces.
   ``We are watching what form of government is offered by the
mujahedeen (guerrillas) before making an assessment of the Afghan
problem,'' she said. ``It's for the Afghans to decide ... because
they're the ones fighting.''
   Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and the United States support the Moslem
guerrillas, who began fighting after a communist coup in April 1978.
Soviet military forces entered the country in December 1979 and an
estimated 115,000 Red Army soldiers were there when withdrawals
began May. 15 under a U.N.-mediated agreement.
   The insurgents, most of whom are based in neighboring Pakistan,
broke off direct talks with the Soviets this week to protest Kremlin
insistence that Communists be included in a postwar government.
   About 3.5 Afghan refugees live in border camps and towns in
Pakistan, which the insurgents use as bases and supply points.
   Reports in Pakistani newspapers have said Ms. Bhutto's government
is trying for a resumption of negotiations to avoid more bloodshed
after the Soviets leave.
   Ms. Bhutto, 35, said the religious part of her first trip abroad
since taking office Dec. 2, including a visit to Mecca, was a
pilgrimage ``to offer prayers and thanksgiving to God for the
restoration of ... democratic rule in Pakistan.''
   Her Pakistan People's Party won the most Parliament seats in the
first free elections for more than a decade. The last were under her
father, Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, who was overthrown by
Gen. Mohammad Zia ul-Haq in 1977 and hanged two years later.
   Zia died in a plane crash in August.

<HEAD>Royal Shakespeare Company Plans Biggest Year Ever</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT WOLF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Royal Shakespeare Company on Wednesday
announced plans for its biggest Shakespeare year ever with 14 of the
bard's plays and shorter contracts for actors aimed at attracting
more top talent.
   Terry Hands, the subsidized theater's artistic director, unveiled
a new ``one-year, two-season work cycle'' under which actors will
commit themselves to one 60-week contract, playing the first half of
the season at the company's home theater in Stratford-upon-Avon
before transferring the productions to its London base at the
Barbican.
   This replaces the two-year schedule in which actors had to make a
two-year commitment and spent one year at Stratford and the second
in London.
   The system is meant to encourage actors to join the company by
allowing them the flexibility to couple stage work with the more
lucrative film and television assignments that make long runs in the
theater possible.
   ``It's not a change in the basic policy ... It's a continuing
experiment,'' said Hands, adding: ``English actors do not like long
runs.''
   Hands declined to name names, but said the old system had
mitigated against getting those top talents who would not sign such
a lengthy contract.
   He said the company will present 27 plays in London and Stratford.
   The 1989 London season begins at the end of March with the
transfers from Stratford of last year's mainstage and studio
productions, which included John Wood as Prospero in ``The Tempest''
and a series of plays from, and about, the Restoration period.
   Two new productions, to open in July and September respectively,
will be revivals of George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart's ``The Man Who
Came To Dinner'' and Henrik Ibsen's ``The Master Builder,'' with
Wood playing the doomed visionary, Solness.
   The spring Stratford line-up begins April 11 with ``A Midsummer
Night's Dream'' and includes Shakespeare's ``Cymbeline,''
``Hamlet,'' and ``Romeo and Juliet,'' before those productions in
turn transfer to London in November.
   At that point, two more productions enter the London repertory: a
stage adaptation of Anthony Burgess's novel ``A Clockwork Orange''
and ``Have,'' by Hungarian writer Julius Hay.
   The autumn sees a new Stratford roster of ``As You Like It,''
``All's Well That Ends Well,'' and ``Antony and Cleopatra.''
   Besides Wood, actors announced for the upcoming season include
such RSC veterans as Harriet Walter and Brian Cox, and promising
young talents such as Mark Rylance, who will play Hamlet and Romeo,
and David O'Hara.
   American playwright Richard Nelson, who wrote the book for the
short-lived Broadway musical ``Chess,'' will open a new play, ``Some
Americans Abroad,'' in London in July.
   Other plans by the company include a six-week European tour in
February and March of the company's highly praised ``Titus
Andronicus.''
   This year marks the first time in four years that the company has
no musical on tap. ``Les Miserables,'' which opened at the Barbican
in 1985, is an ongoing worldwide hit, but its revival of ``Kiss Me,
Kate'' failed to transfer to the United States and its most recent
musical, ``Carrie,'' was a disaster, closing on Broadway after five
performances in May.

<HEAD>New Ulcer Drug Rated Better Than Commonly Used Medicine</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new ulcer drug that is still being tested is
superior to one of the mainstays of ulcer treatment because it
promotes healing and relieves symptoms more quickly, according to a
new study.
   The drug, known generically as omeprazole, was found to work
better than Zantac, one of two widely used treatments for ulcers of
the digestive system.
   ``I have a good feeling about this drug. It seems to be more
effective,'' said Dr. Alain Farley of McGill University in Montreal.
   Farley was among physicians at 45 institutions in 13 countries
who compared omeprazole and Zantac on 602 patients. The results were
published in Thursday's issue of the New England Journal of Medicine.
   Farley said he expects the new drug to be approved for routine
use in the United States and Canada within the next year.
   The latest study compared the two drugs in patients with stomach
ulcers. After one month of treatment, ulcers had healed in 80
percent of those getting omeprazole and 59 percent receiving Zantac.
After two months, 96 percent of the omeprazole patients and 85
percent of the Zantac patients had healed.
   The drugs work by blocking the body's secretion of hydrochloric
acid, but omeprazole does so far more completely than other drugs on
the market.
   An estimated 20 million Americans get digestive ulcers. They are
holes in the lining of the stomach or the duodenum, which is the
upper part of the small intestine.
   Earlier studies have found omeprazole to be superior to Tagamet,
the other commonly prescribed ulcer medicine, in healing duodenal
ulcers.
   Dr. David Graham of the Veterans Administration Medical Center in
Houston, who has also studied the new drug, said some experts are
concerned about the long-term effects of shutting down acid
secretion almost completely.
   ``I think this drug actually is a step forward, but it's into
some uncharted areas,'' said Graham. ``Only time will tell if that
is best for patients.''
   He said that while omeprazole will probably be widely prescribed,
it's still unclear whether it will become the drug of choice in the
highly competitive market for ulcer remedies.
   The latest study concluded that ``omeprazole is superior to
ranitidine (Zantac) in the treatment of benign gastric ulcer''
because it produced faster healing and gave more rapid relief of
symptoms.

   Billy Dee Williams, known for his looks as well
as his acting abilities, was a fat child taunted by neighborhood
youths.
   ``A kid should grow up with some flaws, because it makes you work
a little harder,'' said Williams in the Sunday issue of Parade
magazine. ``You don't rely so much on your looks.''
   ``Sonny,'' as his family calls him, was ``a jolly little fat guy
who weighed 150 pounds by the time he was 10,'' his mother, Loretta
Williams, told the magazine.
   When other children chased him, ``he'd be running and crying, and
his pants would be splitting down the back,'' said Mrs. Williams.
   Williams, who began acting at age 7, noted that his role in the
1972 movie ``Lady Sings the Blues'' established him as ``this
romantic matinee idol,'' an image he kept up on the television show
``Dynasty.''
   Now, he's ready for more challenging roles.
   ``I don't want to be this guy who everybody thinks is handsome
and women are crazy about. That's not enough,'' he said.

   Former congresman L. Richardson Preyer
got a building named after him on his 70th birthday to mark his more

   Actresses Britt Ekland and
Ursula Andress, two heroines of James Bond films, ran the risk of
U.N. censure when they arrived here Thursday to promote reruns of
the movies on local cable network.
   The actresses said they had no plans to perform during their
four-day visit, but still risk being placed on a United Nations
blacklist of performers who appear in South Africa. The U.N.
maintains the list to focus attention on South Africa's apartheid
policies of racial segregation.
   ``I know a lot of people who have come here to perform, been paid
a lot of money and then apologize about it later,'' Ms. Ekland said.
   ``I feel it's wrong to brand me anything, I'm not that
important,'' Ms. Ekland said at a news conference.
   The actresses will make promotional appearances for the M-Net
television network, which this year is showing 14 of the James Bond
films about the dashing secret agent 007.

   Former U.S. officials seeking to erode support
for Israel in Congress filed a complaint Thursday against an
influential pro-Israel lobby and 53 political action committees,
charging they had violated federal election laws.
   The 100-page complaint to the Federal Election Commission was
filed by one-time Undersecretary of State George Ball, former
ambassador to Saudi Arabia James Akins, former ambassador to Qatar
Andrew Killgore, former Illinois congressman Paul Findley and three
others.
   The complaint, supported by more than two dozen exhibits, alleges
that the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) has
overstepped its legal lobbying activities by targeting political
candidates for election or defeat based on their positions toward
Israel.
   The complainants further claimed that AIPAC channeled funds and
volunteers to such campaigns in violation of its registered purpose
as a lobbyist. AIPAC has in the past denied such activities but
declined to discuss the complaint, citing FEC regulations of
confidentiality.
   The complaint, researched by a major Arab-American organization
called the American Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, demands that
the FEC force AIPAC to register as a PAC and disclose its activities.
   Such a ruling would hamper the effectiveness of the lobby, which
operates behind the scenes to recruit support for Israel, the
largest recipient of U.S. aid with $3 billion annually, and to
oppose weapons sales to Arab foes of the Jewish state.
   ``AIPAC's formidable ability to mobilize congressional support
... is based not upon an appeal to the American national interest
but upon threats by a special interest that has resorted to
conspiracy and collusion,'' said a statement by Richard Curtiss,
formerly the chief inspector of the U.S. Information Agency and one
of the plaintiffs.
   But a brief statement by AIPAC said its ``members proudly
participate in the American political process and do so within the
law. We are confident the FEC will expeditiously concur.''
   Curtiss and others have argued over the years that Washington's
policy is skewed in Israel's favor to the detriment of U.S. standing
in the Arab world, both politically and economically.
   AIPAC and its supporters contend that Israel is the only stable
democracy in the Middle East and a vital ally for the United States
in the volatile region. They also point to broad support for Israel
in public opinion surveys.
   There are only a handful of pro-Arab PACs in the United States
and they are outspent as much as 10-to-1 by the pro-Israel groups.
   The complaint, the first against AIPAC in its 15-year history,
also charges that the lobby coordinates the activities of dozens of
PACs and uses them to channel funds to candidates. The complaint
cites two internal AIPAC memos, one of which urges a colleague to
ensure that pro-Israel PACs channel contributions to certain Senate
candidates.
   The petition also seeks to prove collusion between AIPAC and 53
pro-Israel PACs through their common cause and an overlap of their
officials.
   It is not uncommon in Washington for directors of PACs to be
active on boards of special interest groups or corporations.
   If the charge of collusion is accepted by the FEC, it could find
that the PACs exceeded their contribution limits because the law
treats all contributions by affiliated committees as though they
were made by a single group.
   The complaint, which also demands that the FEC order candidates
to return such excessive contributions, cited the 1988 Rhode Island
senatorial race, which the complaint contends was targeted by AIPAC
through its allegedly affiliated PACs.
   Lt. Gov. Richard Licht, who was allegedly supported by $172,000
from pro-Israel PACs, ran against incumbent John Chafee, but lost.
Chafee, who voted in 1981 to sell AWACS surveillance aircraft to
Saudi Arabia, did not receive a dime from pro-Israel PACs, the
complaint alleges.
   AIPAC's attorney, noting that most of the evidence cited by the
complainants is based on newspaper clippings and anonymous claims,
said, ``There has been no effort to influence PACs; they make their
own decisions.'' He declined to be named.
   The FEC generally takes 30 to 45 days to decide whether to
investigate a complaint.

<HEAD>Lawmaker Introduces Resolution to Commemorate Civil Rights Deaths</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JACK ELLIOTT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JACKSON, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Mississippi legislator introduced a
resolution Thursday to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the
slayings of three civil rights workers in 1964.
   Rep. George Flaggs Jr. said the resolution would put the state of
Mississippi ``on record'' in commemorating the June 21, 1964, deaths
of James Earl Chaney, Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner.
   None of the sites of significant events during the civil rights
era bear state monuments, including the site near Philadelphia,
Miss., where the three slain civil rights workers were found buried
in an earthen dam.
   There is a monument to the three men at Philadelphia, but it was
erected by the Mississippi NAACP.
   Talk about state markers has been fueled in recent weeks by the
release of the movie ``Mississippi Burning,'' a fictionalized
account of the slayings and subsequent investigation.
   ``We keep saying Mississippi is changing,'' said Cleve McDowell,
former field director for the state NAACP, ``but we don't do
anything to show it.''
   A state marker ``would speak louder and show we actually have
changed,'' McDowell said. ``That would be a better indicator that
Mississippi is changing than anything else.''
   It was too early to assess reaction from the Legislature. Flaggs
issued a statement saying the three civil rights workers ``dedicated
and sacrificed their lives for the benefit of others.''
   ``It is imperative that the citizens of this state recognize the
humanist efforts which were demonstrated by those three courageous
civil rights workers who believed in justice and equality for
everyone, regardless of race, color or creed,'' he said.
   State historian Michael Beard said funding for state markers was
lost in 1980 and has not been restored. But he called the slayings
the turning point in the civil rights movement, and clearly favored
commemorating them.
   ``It's one of the most historic sites in Mississippi,'' he said.
A marker, he said, would show ``we can recognize the truth and no
longer cover it up. We are no longer a closed society.''

<DATELINE>TUNIS, Tunisia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Arab League on Thursday condemned the
U.S. downing of two Libyan jets Jan. 4 as a threat to all Arab
nations.
   The 21-nation Arab League issued a statement of condemnation at
the end of a special session in Tunis called at the request of
Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi.
   Palestine Liberation Organization chairman Yasser Arafat
addressed a league committee and berated Arab colleagues for
reneging on their promise of aid to the people of the Israeli
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   The resolution on the jet downing asked the United States to
``refrain from all actions against Libya that could have negative
consequences on Arab-American relations.''
   During the meeting, Libyan Foreign Minister Jadallah Azzouz Talhi
said U.S. actions against his country were aimed at dissuading Arab
states from possessing arms that could threaten Israel.
   Gadhafi requested the meeting of foreign ministers after two U.S.
Navy planes downed the Libyan jets, which American officials say
were about to attack the U.S. craft.
   The United States says the action was unrelated to concern that
Libya has built a plant for making chemical weapons.
   The plant, which Libya says is for producing medicine, was a main
topic at a five-day international conference this week in Paris on
banning chemical weapons.
   ``The U.S. has the biggest stock of chemical arms in the world,
and it is trying to obstruct other countries from having their
own,'' said Arab League Secretary-General Chedli Klibi.
   The conference ended without agreement on a ban.
   Arab League members who attended sought to tie chemical
disarmament to nuclear disarmament. They said that until Israel
gives up its nuclear force, Arab states need chemical arms for
defense.
   The Arab position was not included in the final document.
   Arafat spoke to the league's uprising subcommittee of six foreign
ministers that has been responsible for ensuring support for
Palestinians in the occupied territories. He charged the group with
neglecting its responsibility.
   The exact amount of aid promised is not known, but is generally
believed to be about $128 million in emergency aid and $43 million
in additional help each month.
   Arafat first began complaining about a lack of aid at a June
meeting in Algiers that was dedicated to organising financial and
diplomatic support for Palestinians.
   The committee issued a statement urging league members to adhere
to their promises.

   The judge hearing the case for compensation
to victims of the 1984 gas leak in this city has been transferred
after he was found to be biased against the company, officials said
Thursday.
   He is the fourth judge to be moved from the Bhopal District Court
trying the case since the world's largest civil suit began in 1985.
   The state High Court ruled in November that Bhopal District Judge
M.W. Deo was prejudiced after Union Carbide Corp. complained that he
ordered it to pay interim relief of $290 million to victims before
fixing liability for the leak.
   Deo was transferred to a trial court at Mandleshwar in central
Madhya Pradesh state, 190 miles east of the state capital Bhopal,
according to officials handling the case who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Nirmal K. Jain, another district judge, has been appointed to
hear the case in Bhopal, the officials said.
   Two earlier judges resigned voluntarily. Another was removed when
he was found to be among the 500,000 claimants.
   The Indian government, which filed suit on behalf of all the
victims, says at least 20,000 people are still suffering from
exposure to the toxic gas that leaked out of the Bhopal pesticide
plant on Dec. 3, 1984. More than 3,300 people were killed.
   India's $3 billion damage suit against Union Carbide, a
multinational whose Indian subsidiary operated the plant, has bogged
down in the country's labyrinthine court system.
   Union Carbide, whose headquarters are in Danbury, Conn., says the
gas leak was the result of sabotage by an employee. The Indian
government contends the leak was caused by negligence.

   The government released more than 200
political prisoners Thursday after newly elected President
Ranasinghe Premadasa lifted a 5{-year state of emergency in this
ethnically troubled land, the military said.
   ``I still don't know why I was brought here,'' said Jeffrey
Simon, 39, as he left Tyronne Fernando Cricket Stadium, a temporary
military camp in Moratuwa, about six miles south of Colombo.
   Rupasinghe Padmasiri, the father of another prisoner, said, ``My
son is a rice paddy farmer, the father of three children. He has no
involvement with the Sinhalese extremists.'' He said his 28-year-old
son, Panduka, was arrested while buying groceries.
   Military officials speaking on condition of anonymity said 234
political prisoners were freed after the emergency rules were lifted
at midnight.
   The rules were imposed in May 1983 after ethnic riots between the
Sinhalese majority and Tamils, who are fighting for independence.
Extended month by month, they empowered security forces to arrest
and indefinitely detain a suspect without charge and to search
houses without warrants.
   When the president revoked the emergency state three days before
it was again to expire, he said about 1,800 political prisoners
detained without charge would be released.
   Within hours, 110 prisoners were freed at a detention camp in
southern Sri Lanka, the military said. Ninety-nine were released
from the Moratuwa camp, and 25 others were allowed to leave a prison
in Colombo, it said.
   All had been held without charge since November for alleged
involvement with Sinhalese extremists trying to overthrow the
government, said one military official. Each signed a statement
before leaving prison saying he had been treated well and would not
bring charges against security forces, the official said.
   Military officials said other prisoners would be released later
but gave no details. The detainees include both Sinhalese and Tamils
accused of violence against the state and assassinations of
government legislators, police and soldiers.
   This island off the southern tip of India has suffered spiraling
violence since 1983, when militant Tamils launched their separatist
war.
   Since then, more than 8,500 people, mostly Sinhalese civilians,
have died in massacres, ambushes and guerrilla battles. The dead
include more than 600 Indian soldiers, part of a peacekeeping force
sent to Sri Lanka in July 1987 to try to disarm Tamil insurgents.
   In his campaign for president, Premadasa pledged to press for
withdrawal of the 50,000 Indian troops. A few thousand were reported
to be pulled out earlier this month.
   Premadasa, a Sinhalese, was sworn in as president on Jan. 2 after
winning last month's presidential election.
   In addition to the other deaths, more than 650 government
supporters, mostly Sinhalese, have been killed by Sinhalese
extremists. They oppose former President Junius R. Jayewardene's
efforts to make peace with the Tamils by granting them limited
automony in the northern and eastern provinces.
   Tamils, who are mostly Hindu, make up 18 percent of the island's
16 million people. They say they are denied jobs and education by
the Buddhist Sinhalese, who comprise 75 percent of the population
and control the government.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Studies at five medical centers show that
acyclovir, an antiviral drug, can reduce or eliminate recurrent
outbreaks of genital herpes even when taken for more than a year, a
researcher said Thursday.
   Dr. David Baker, a specialist in obstetrics and gynecology at the
State University of New York, Stony Brook, said a double-blind study
involving 261 patients with active herpes infections showed that
outbreaks of the disease were virtually eliminated for about half of
those taking acyclovir twice daily.
   ``These were all patients who before had had about one recurrence
of herpes a month'' and had been infected for more than a year,
Baker said in a telephone interview.
   He said half of the 261 patients in the study received 400
milligrams of acyclovir twice a day for a year, while the other half
received only a placebo.
   ``For those who took the active drug daily, about half (46
percent) had no recurrence of herpes outbreak at all'' during the
year, said Baker. ``In the other half, who took the drug, the
recurrences were very mild and they lasted a day instead of five
days as before,'' he said.
   Members of the active drug group averaged 1.8 recurrences for the
whole year.
   In the placebo group, said Baker, ``there was virtually no change
in the frequency of the outbreaks.''
   He said those in the placebo group each averaged 8.5 herpes
episodes over 12 months, and only five percent of this group
experienced no episode.
   Genital herpes is caused by a virus that generally is spread
through sexual contact in which one partner has open lesions of the
disease. Herpes infects the genital tract of both men and women and
will periodically cause infected lesions on genital surfaces. For
some infected with the disease, these episodes can be very painful,
frequent and continue for years. For others, the pain and formation
of lesions may occur only once and then not reappear.
   ``For 20 to 30 percent of those infected,'' said Baker, ``the
outbreaks are very frequent occurences that continue for many
years.''
   He said patients used in the study ``were selected from a
population that has lots of trouble with herpes.''
   Although earlier studies showed that acyclovir was effective
temporarily against herpes, Baker said the double-blind trial was
the first to demonstrate that the antiviral drug is effective over
many months.
   ``The trial shows that if you have a population that has frequent
recurrences you can treat them for a long period of time and it is
safe and it works,'' said Baker.
   In addition to Stony Brook, the study trials were conducted at
St. John's Mercy Medical Center in St. Louis; Baylor College of
Medicine, Houston; the University of Hawaii, Honolulu, and in
Montreal.
   A report on the study was published this month in the journal
Obstetrics and Gynecology, a journal of the American College of
Obstetricians and Gynecologists.

<HEAD>Prison Warden Who Was Stabbed By Female Guard Is Suspended for Losing
Key</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JACKSON, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A warden has been suspended for losing the
master key to the prison, an incident that corrections officials
believe is linked to the warden's relationship with a female guard
who allegedly stabbed him.
   Travis Jones, 49, warden at the maximum-security Huron Valley
Men's Facility in Ypsilanti, was placed on indefinite suspension
without pay Jan. 3, the day he was stabbed in the back by Sgt.
Olivia Pitts, officials said.
   He faces a Corrections Department hearing Jan. 30, spokeswoman
Gail Light said Thursday.
   The stabbing occurred at a service station in Jackson, where
Jones stopped for gas on his way to work. Police said Pitts, a guard
at the Cotton Regional Facility in Jackson, followed Jones to the
service station and stabbed him with a 6-inch knife when he got out
of his car.
   Jones was treated at a hospital and released.
   Corrections officials believe the key was lost during an argument
between the two Dec. 17 in Pitts' apartment.
   Jones was found naked and struggling with the knife-wielding
Pitts, who had summoned police, according to police reports.
   He left the woman's apartment after receiving a change of
clothing. Corrections officials believe the key to the 470-bed
prison was lost in his original clothing.
   Pitts said she had been involved in an eight-year affair with
Jones, who is married, according to court records. Jones said Pitts,
who has been suspended from her job and faces felony charges in the
stabbing incident, was caught in a ``Fatal Attraction''-type
relationship and that he was trying to counsel her.
   ``Fatal Attraction'' was a 1987 film about a woman's obsessive
pursuit of a married man.
   While the lost master key unlocks all interior doors, including
cells, it does not unlock exterior doors or the prison's weapon's
arsenal, Light said.
   Replacing the locks would cost $40,000 to $65,000, she said,
adding that corrections officials haven't decided whether to make
the change.
   ``The supposition is that the key was not lost inside the
institution but is floating around somewhere outside the prison,''
Light said.
   Pitts, who was called an excellent employee by Peter Blakeley, an
assistant to the warden at the Cotton facility, faces charges of
assault with intent to do great bodily harm and carrying a concealed
weapon. Free on $5,000 bond, she waived a preliminary examination
and was bound over for arraignment in Jackson County Circuit Court
on Jan. 18, according to the county Prosecutor's Office. The maximum
penalty for convictions on the charges is 10 years in prison.
   Don Houseworth, deputy director of the department's bureau of
correctional facilities, was serving as acting warden of the Huron
Valley facility, Light said.

<TEXT>
   President-elect Bush said Thursday that he
would not advocate government action to curtail corporate takeovers
but suggested a review of tax laws might be needed to guard against
abuses.
   ``I am not in favor of the government picking winners and
losers,'' Bush said at a news conference called to announce his
final Cabinet choices.
   Bush was asked if he planned any action to put the brakes on the
increasing number of takeovers, many through so-called leveraged
buyouts.
   ``You are talking to one who would as much as possible rely on
market forces,'' Bush replied.
   In a leveraged buyout, an investment group borrows heavily to buy
out stockholders and take over the target company. Sometimes such
buyouts are proposed by managers seeking to thwart a hostile
takeover.
   The company's new owners either cut costs or sell off pieces of
the company to pay back loans. Critics of the practice fear that
high debt levels, particularly in a recession, could endanger both
the bought-out company and the financiers of the transaction.
   Bush said that ``if there are abuses of our tax laws, ... the
whole tax law will be reviewed to see how they can be eliminated.''
   The vice president did not elaborate, but hinted that his
administration might examine changes in tax laws to make clearer the
distinction between debt and equity.

<HEAD>Burmese Students Fly Home, Officials Deny Forced Repatriations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of 76 Burmese students flew home
Thursday from Thailand, where the prime minister was reported to
reject charges of earlier forced repatriations.
   The latest return brought to 260 the number who have come home
since the repatriation program began Dec. 26, Thai officials said.
   Thousands of students, at the forefront of pro-democracy protests
through much of last year, fled to Thai border areas controlled by
anti-government guerrillas after Gen. Saw Maung seized power in a
coup Sept. 18 and his troops killed hundreds of demonstrators.
   Two Burmese aircraft took the latest group of students from a
processing center in the northern city of Tak to Burma's capital,
Rangoon. The students were seen off by the Tak governor and Thai Red
Cross officials and welcomed aboard the planes by Burmese military
officers.
   Forty-four more students will return the same way Friday,
officials say. They will be accompanied by Thai and foreign
journalists invited by the Thai military to try to dispel charges
that the students were being forced back to face harsh treatment by
Burmese authorities.
   Thai Prime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan rejected as ``absolutely
untrue'' charges by Amnesty International, a human rights group,
that Thailand forcibly repatriated 22 students who flew from Tak to
Rangoon on Jan. 6, Thai newspapers reported Thursday.
   Speaking with reporters Wednesday, Chatichai was quoted as saying
he tore up the telexed statement with the charges from the
London-based group as soon as he saw it.
   He suggested Amnesty was interfering in Thailand's affairs, but
he said it and other humanitarian groups were welcome to observe the
repatriations of the students.
   ``We didn't force them back and they all smiled happily when
boarding the planes,'' he said, according to The Nation newspaper.
   ``Thailand is a developing country in Asia, so it is normal that
those European countries like to think that we are still
barbarians,'' he was quoted as saying.
   Thai military officers in charge of the repatriation program also
have strongly denied Amnesty's charges.
   The Amnesty statement, received in Bangkok on Wednesday, said
concern for the students' safety was based on ``increasing
evidence'' that many Burmese arrested for involvement in the
demonstrations have been held without charge or trial. It cited
evidence that some were tortured.
   The group's statement said the 22, of the Shan ethnic minority,
were rounded up by Thai police two weeks ago in Mae Hong Son
province bordering Burma.
   The statement said: ``They are said to have repeatedly expressed
fears for their safety and to have petitioned the Thai authorities
not to be returned to Burma and eventually went on a hunger strike.
They are understood to have been forced to board a plane from Tak
airport on Jan. 6, 1989, by Thai army personnel.
   The group said 14 students detained with them are believed still
held at Tak airport, pending similar repatriation.
   Reporters who accompanied the 22 students on the flight quoted
them as expressing concern for their safety in Burma.
   Thailand at first promised the students temporary asylum, but
Thai army chief Gen. Chavalit Yongchaiyudh visited Burma on Dec. 14
and reached an agreement with Saw Maung to repatriate the students.
Thai officials have said about 7,000 remain at the border.

   Two Canadians, an American and a German have
been selected as candidates for an international space shuttle
science mission scheduled for 1991.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration announced
Thursday that Ulf D. Merbold, 47, of the European Space Agency and
Roger K. Crouch of NASA have been chosen to train to perform
materials sciences experiments on the International Microgravity
Laboratory-1 mission scheduled for April 1991.
   NASA also announced that it has approved the nomination by Canada
of two specialists who will train to perform life sciences
experiments on the IML-1 mission. The nominated crew members are Dr.
Roberta L. Bondar, 43, and Dr. Kenneth Money, 53.
   After a training period, one of the Canadians will be selected to
fly on the IML-1 mission to perform the biological experiments, and
either Merbold or Crouch will be selected to perform the materials
sciences experiments on the mission.
   The IML mission is the first of a planned series of flights that
will investigate the use of weightlessness in scientific
experiments. The experiments will be conducted in a module called
the Spacelab, carried into orbit in the cargo bay of the space
shuttle Columbia. The IML-1 mission is scheduled to last about nine
days.
   In addition to the specialists, NASA said the mission crew will
include five members of the U.S. astronaut corps.
   The first IML mission will be followed every 17 to 25 months with
additional flights using a module and experiments facilities built
by U.S., European, Canadian and Japanese organizations. The purpose
of the mission series is to investigate the unique effects of
weightlessness on biological and manufacturing processes.
   Merbold flew on Spacelab-1, a 10-day space shuttle flight in
1983. He holds a doctorate of science degree from Stuttgart
University and was a member of the Max-Planck Institute faculty
until his appointment in 1977 as a European Space Agency astronaut.
   Bondar is a physician with degrees from the University of Toronto
and McMaster University. She is a specialist in nuerology. The
Canadian National Research Council selected her as an astronaut in
1983.
   Money is a pilot and a scientist specializing in the study of
motion sickness. He holds a doctorate in physiology from the
University of Toronto and was selected as a Canadian astronaut in
1983.
   Crouch is a scientist specializing in microgravity studies at
NASA headquarters in Washington. He graduated from high school from
Benton, Tenn. and from Tennessee Tech in Cookville, and holds a
doctorate in physics from Virginia Tech.
   NASA officials said the four candidate crewmen will start
training for their mission in April at the Marshall Space Flight
Center in Huntsville, Ala.

<HEAD>Students Give Up Earrings at School So They Don't Flunk</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALBANY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Opting for education over earrings, two
brothers gave in to their principal Thursday and agreed to take off
their earrings during school hours. But their parents say they'll
continue to fight the order.
   Terry Sunderland, a junior at Albany R-3 High School, and his
brother, Jeremy Snow, a seventh-grader, returned to classes for the
first time in the week since the controversy started.
   ``I'd like to wear my earring, but I don't want to flunk,'' said
Jeremy. ``I take mine off as I enter the school and put it back on
as I leave the door.''
   Principal Jim Newman said the brothers would have flunked all
their courses for the quarter if they had accumulated seven
unexcused absences.
   Newman banned earrings for boys on Jan. 4 after an outbreak of
name-calling and pushing and shoving between boys who wore earrings
and those who didn't.
   He gave eight boys who wore earrings the next day the option of
taking them off or leaving. Two boys stayed in school; the other
six, including Terry and Jerry, left but eventually returned to
class.
   Newman said the school's dress code gives administrators the
discretion to ban things that would be ``disruptive to the
educational process.''
   But the brothers' parents, Lanny and Carla Sunderland, argue that
their sons are victims, not perpetrators. They said they intend to
explore legal action against the school.
   ``They didn't start the trouble and now they are being punished
unfairly,'' Mrs. Sunderland said. ``It's sexual discrimination. If
the boys can't wear 'em, then the girls can't.''
   Sunderland, a truck driver, had his own ear pierced and now wears
an earring himself in a show of solidarity with his sons.
   ``I was outraged,'' he said. ``I did it in the belief of standing
up for my boys and what they believe in. That's why I'm pushing it.''

<HEAD>Communist Party Says Some Reforms `Skidding,' Promises To Do Better</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL PUTZEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Communist Party on Thursday unveiled a campaign
platform that promises a higher Soviet standard of living but
acknowledges that some of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms
are ``skidding.''
   Nearly four years after launching an ambitious modernization
program to raise living standards and open its long-closed society
to public scrutiny, the party said, ``The economy has not yet begun
to operate in a new way. People have not yet come to feel fully the
results of restructuring.''
   The expectations raised by perestroika, Gorbachev's reform
program, are far from being met, the platform said. ``Progress in
some areas, including the social sphere, is skidding.''
   The platform was adopted by the Central Committee at a plenary
meeting on Tuesday and published in full by Tass on Thursday.
   At the same meeting, the leadership picked Gorbachev and 99 other
top officials of the ruling party to run for election to the party's
100 seats in the Congress of People's Deputies.
   Despite a new election law allowing ``an unlimited number of
candidates'' to participate in the March 26 election, the move
guaranteed the top Communist leaders uncontested seats in the new
2,250-member parliament, which will elect the nation's president and
a full-time legislature.
   The party's first priority is ``a solution to the most acute
issue: the food problem,'' the platform said. But it offered few
clues to how it would accomplish that, saying only that the Central
Committee soon will hold another plenary session to take steps ``to
meet the population's requirements for foodstuffs more quickly.''
   Meat, butter, sugar and other staples are rationed throughout
much of the country and are in short supply elsewhere, even in the
national capital, where there are numerous complaints in newspapers
and on the streets that the food situation is worse now than when
Gorbachev assumed power in March 1985.
   The party also conceded people continue to wait ``for a
sufficient amount of high-quality industrial goods to appear on
sale,'' but it said a substantial amount of money is being spent to
modernize light industry, and that some defense plants are being
converted to civilian use.
   The platform also promised the party would ``do everything
necessary ... to provide each family with a self-contained apartment
or a house by the year 2000.'' Twenty percent of Soviet families now
share living quarters with other, unrelated families. In some
regions, families must live in dormitories because no apartments are
available.
   Among other campaign promises, the party pledged:
   _A new pension law increasing payments to retirees and
establishing a uniform pension plan for industrial and office
workers and collective farmers.
   _Overhaul of the judicial system and adoption of laws to
strengthen individual rights ``an equality of everyone before the
law.''
   _Expanding the rights of the nation's 15 constituent republics
and stengthening their ``sovereignty'' within the Soviet system,
which divides authority between the central government and the
republics but traditionally has reserved most power inside the
Kremlin.
   In foreign policy, the Central Committee declared, ``The Cold War
is retreating'' and said prospects are good for achieving a
U.S.-Soviet pact on reduction of long-range nuclear weapons
following implementation of a treaty eliminating intermediate-range
missiles.
   ``We are doing all we can for an early settlement to the Afghan
problem, for completion of Soviet troop withdrawal in keeping with
the Geneva accords,'' the platform said.
   A U.N.-brokered agreement calls for the last Soviet forces to be
out of Afghanistan by Feb. 15, but officials have indicated they may
not meet that deadline. The Kremlin has been working to arrange a
negotiated settlement of the protracted civil war.

<TEXT>
   The National Geographic Society on Thursday
unveiled a massive 35-foot globe, the centerpiece in Geographica, a
high-tech multi-media science and geography exhibition two years
away from being finished.
   Lady Bird Johnson pressed a button to turn on the 1,550-pound
globe, repeating her effort 25 years ago, when she helped dedicate
the original globe and display in Explorers Hall at the magazine's
headquarters.
   Mrs. Johnson congratulated the society for its efforts to
``illuminate our understanding'' that the entire world is one
society.
   The new globe, with a circumfrance of 35 feet, is composed of
54,739 square inches of epoxy resin and Fiberglas cloth painted in
painstaking detail by artist John Bonner, who spent 3,127 hours
highlighting vegetation, deserts, national boundaries and undersea
features.
   The globe is lifted on a cushion of air and can be rotated so any
portion can face the audience. Lights display the movement of
sunlight and shadow around the world.
   Occasionally work had to be sanded off and changed in progress,
Bonner said. For example, a visiting Indian official who saw the
work informed the society that an area shown as a swamp had dried up
into a salt lake _ so it was changed.
   And the configuration of the Antarctic ice shelf had to be redone
after a giant iceberg broke off.
   Geographic officials did take one precaution to save work in the
event of political changes. National boundaries were applied with
automotive pinstripe tape so that they can be relocated if necessary.
   The renovated exhibition area includes a 72-seat theater, a
weather display including satellite readouts and a ``tornado'' in a
tube, video shows depicting exotic cultures and both rare and common
animals.
   While the exhibit won't be finished for two years, the society's
president, Gilbert M. Grosvenor, said the public will be admitted
starting Saturday to see the many displays already in operation.

<HEAD>Airlines Begin Testing For Cross-Wiring In 737s</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. airlines began testing Thursday for faulty
engine warning systems in Boeing 737 airliners similar to one that
crashed in England. A spokesman for one U.S carrier said 80 percent
of its 737s had been tested with no problems found.
   Officials of other airlines said they were complying with the
testing as a precautionary measure but expected to find no faulty
wiring of fire and vibration warning lights that might mislead a
pilot into shutting down his only good engine if the other one
showed problems.
   That is one possibility being investigated in England, where a
British Midland 737 crash killed 44 people Sunday. Investigators
said the pilot was trying to land with his malfunctioning left
engine after his good right engine was shut down.
   Tests on British-owned planes were completed Thursday under a
Civil Aviation Authority order that grounded them until the systems
were checked out. No problems were reported.
   The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration ``air worthiness
directive'' issued late Wednesday did not order any U.S. planes
grounded. It gave airlines with 292 Boeing 737-300s and eight
737-400s until Sunday morning to conduct checks for possible
cross-wiring. Each test takes about an hour.
   The British agency also ordered increased inspections of CFM56
engines on the planes, but the FAA had not taken that step. FAA
officials identified the affected airlines as Aloha, America West,
American, Continental, Delta, Orion, Piedmont, Southwest, United and
U.S. Air.
   ``We found no anomalies or discrepancies,'' said Continental
spokesman David Messing in Houston, reporting on inspections
conducted by Thursday afternoon. He said 80 percent of the 55 Boeing
737-300s flown by Continental had been checked and the rest would be
finished overnight.
   He said no flights were affected by the checks.
   United spokeswoman Sara Dornacker in Chicago said the airline
supported the FAA action ``even though we regard it as
precautionary.''
   She said all of United's fleet of 49 affected airliners had been
tested for possible cross-wiring by test pilots after delivery from
the Boeing factory.
   United inspections were to be conducted Thursday, Friday and
Saturday nights at airports around the country, she said.
   American spokesman Jim Brown said inspections of some of the
airlines' eight 737s were conducted Thursday, and the remainder
would take place before Sunday.
   ``We have no reason to expect discovery of any abnormalities in
these systems,'' Brown said.

   At least 6,000 people starved to death in
southern Sudan in the past three months, but international airlifts
of food and medicine have improved the situation, a Red Cross
official said Thursday.
   Dominique Beuff of the International Committee of the Red Cross
in Khartoum said he had reports of people dying at the rate of up to
four a day in some areas of the south affected by a 5-year-old civil
war.
   Reith Chuol, governor of the Upper Nile region, told reporters
there were unconfirmed reports of 15 people dying there every day.
No relief aid has reached the Upper Nile.
   Beuff said: ``Between last September and December, about 6,000
people have died in the south of the Sudan, but that is not the case
anymore. ... People suffer but they are not dying. The situation is
still not under control, but it is better than last year.''
   Since the civil war began, nearly 2 million southerners have fled
fighting in the countryside, trekking northward or going to
government-controlled towns where they became dependent on relief
food.
   Western relief officials estimate up to 560,000 southerners died
from starvation, disease or fighting in 1988.
   Rebels led by John Garang, a former army colonel, are fighting
for greater autonomy for the south, most of whose people are
Christian or animist, from Moslem-dominated northern Sudan.
   Last summer, tens of thousands of southerners were isolated by
heavy rains and thousands died of starvation.
   When the rains ended, several international airlifts started
flying food and medicine to the towns in the Bahr el-Ghazal and
Equatoria regions. Several operations by the Red Cross and United
Nations continue.
   As many as 80 people a day died last summer in Bahr el-Ghazal
towns.

   Ford Motor Co. on Thursday delivered a new
presidential limousine to the Secret Service, just in time for the
new administration.
   The 22-foot modified 1989 Lincoln Town Car will first be used in
President-elect Bush's inaugural parade Jan. 20.
   ``It's an honor to help provide security for the president and to
be associated with the prestige of the office of the president of
the United States,'' Ford's Lincoln-Mercury General Manager Ross
Roberts said in a statement.
   The black limo is 44.7 inches longer and 6.1 inches taller than a
conventional Town Car. Its chassis was redesigned and a 7.5-liter
engine was used primarily because of increased weight from armor
plating and communications equipment.
   The weight of the car was not revealed for security reasons, Ford
spokesman J.F. ter Horst said. The hand-built car, a reassembled
Town Car from Ford's Wixom assembly plant, has separate air
conditioning and heating systems for the driver and passenger
compartments.

   A judge dismissed trespassing charges
Thursday against 125 abortion protesters arrested during a
demonstration outside an abortion clinic.
   City Judge Joseph Figliola said the police complaint forms lodged
Nov. 19, the day of the protest, and subsequent affidavits filed by
prosecutors are ``completely barren'' of proof that the protesters
knew they were on private property without permission or that they
were told to leave the clinic grounds.
   The judge said he found no evidence that would support efforts to
force the protesters to stand trial.
   The judge apparently left the door open for prosecutors either to
appeal his ruling or try to file new complaints.
   The 125 anti-abortion protesters had been cited for allegedly
trespassing on the grounds of a clinic operated by Dr. Parvis Taefi
of Buffalo.

<HEAD>Official Sees Rebel ``Campaign of Terror'' in El Salvador''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Assistant Secretary of State Elliott Abrams
claimed Thursday that El Salvador's leftist rebels have had to
resort to a ``campaign of terror'' against civilian targets because
of declining popular support and increased resistance from the
country's armed forces.
   Abrams, in a speech at the University of Oklahoma, said the
rebels have assassinated eight mayors in recent months, prompting 35
other mayors to resign.
   ``Denied success in the countryside, the guerrillas have embarked
on a campaign of terror in the cities,'' said Abrams, whose remarks
were made available by the State Department.
   The rebels have met greater resistance from the armed forces and
have had difficulty recruiting, forcing them to press men ``_ indeed
children _ into a dirty war,'' he said.
   ``These are the tactics of a marginalized force driven to
extremes by desperation,'' said Abrams, whose 3{-year service as
head of the Latin America bureau will end next week with the
inauguration of President-elect Bush.
   He expects to practice law after spending about two months with
the Heritage Foundation, a conservative research group.
   Summing up what he described as the eight-year legacy of
President Reagan in Latin America, Abrams praised the democratic
gains in the hemisphere and touched only briefly on the region's
debt-induced economic crisis, which has led to declining living
standards in most countries.
   The return of economic growth, he said, ``will depend upon a
pragmatic, open-ended search for solutions among creditors and
debtors _ coming together as partners realizing their common stake
in the outcome.''
   Abrams also was sparing his in remarks on Nicaragua, his major
area of concern since his appointment in 1985.
   ``The Nicaragua that chose to become part of the Soviet bloc was
not democratic,'' Abrams said. ``A democratic Nicaragua would have
no use for a standing army of intimidating dimensions. Real peace in
Central America depends on the prospects for democratization in
Nicaragua.''
   He made no reference to the Nicaraguan Contras, who have had
unswerving support from Abrams.
   Expressing confidence that El Salvador's fledgling democracy will
be able to ride out the rebel challenge, he said the electoral
process which began in that country six years ago led to a marked
improvement in the security situation there.
   ``As the people voted in record numbers to put civilian leaders
in charge, the military, freed to meet its professional challenge,
began to reverse the progress made by the guerrillas.
   ``At the same time, a people who could see the prospects for
peaceful change under elected governments could only reject the

<HEAD>Rosa Parks Says the Fight is Not Over</HEAD>

   Rosa Parks, whose refusal to sit at the back of
the bus sparked the modern civil rights movement, said the fight
continues as she joined others Thursday honoring the Rev. Martin
Luther King Jr.
   King rose to prominence after Mrs. Parks' action in December 1955
in Montgomery, Ala., set the stage for a boycott and subsequent
demonstrations that caught the nation by surprise.
   King was killed April 4, 1968, in Memphis, Tenn., and what would
be his 60th birthday Sunday is celebrated as a national holiday
Monday; the celebration began with several events on Thursday.
   Mrs. Parks, 75, praised King as she answered questions on radio
station WLIB. She said the struggle to attain rights is not over.
   ``I feel a kindred to the people of South Africa as well as any
other people who are being denied freedom, and as we try to free
ourselves we must help those who are not free and are suffering all
kinds of physical reprisals or denial,'' she told listeners.
   ``It seems as long as we don't all unite together en masse that
we will have to repeat marches over and over again and I do hope to
live to know and see the day come when we will all be free citizens,
to have any opportunity any other persons have to assume the
responsibilities as others.''
   At a breakfast at the Waldorf-Astoria sponsored by the NAACP and
Anheuser-Busch Cos., several people were honored who exemplified
King's meaning of taking ``the measure of a man'' at times ``of
challenge and controversy.''
   Those honored were Jean Griffith, mother of a man killed on a
Howard Beach, Queens, parkway after being chased by a gang of whites
in December 1986; Jean Chappell, president of an advocacy and
service group helping welfare hotel residents; and Diane and Ernest
McCaine, who adopted a child with AIDS.
   The American Jewish Congress held a meeting for 100 school
children, about one-third Jewish, two-thirds black, to emphasize
that the ``black and Jewish communities have long worked together in
the movement for civil rights,'' the congress said.
   Attending were Spencer Christian of ABC's ``Good Morning,
America''; Bob McGrath of ``Sesame Street''; former New York Met
Rusty Staub; city Comptroller Harrison J. Goldin; and Manhattan
Borough President David Dinkins.
   ``The friendship between African-Americans and Jews, the alliance
for social change, goes back a long way, well before the '60s,''
Dinkins told the gathering. ``Dr. King understood that when he spoke
out against anti-Semitism and said that nobody should be
anti-Semitic, least of all blacks.''

<HEAD>China To Meet With Vietnam On Cambodian War</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China has agreed to meet with Vietnam
next month for their first direct talks on the Cambodian conflict, a
Cambodian resistance official said.
   The meeting will be held at the request of the Soviet Union,
which also plans direct talks with resistance leader Prince Norodom
Sihanouk, said Sihanouk's son and representative in Thailand, Prince
Norodom Ranariddh.
   Ranariddh made the disclosures in a broadcast over the resistance
radio Wednesday. A text was obtained Thursday.
   China supplies arms to the forces of Sihanouk and two other
guerrilla groups in the war against Soviet-supplied Vietnamese
forces, which invaded Cambodia in late 1978.
   Asked about the reported Chinese-Vietnamese meeting, Thai Foreign
Minister Siddhi Savetsila said on his return Thursday from Vietnam
that he knew of it but could not divulge details.
   At a regular Chinese Foreign Ministry briefing in Beijing on
Thursday, spokesman Li Zhaoxing would say only that China will
consider direct talks with Vietnam ``at an appropriate time.'' He
refused to elaborate.
   Both the Soviet Union and China have indicated they want to
resolve the Cambodian conflict and thus clear a major barrier to
Sino-Soviet rapprochement.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze is to visit China
next month to pave the way for the first Chinese-Soviet summit in 30
years, Chinese television reported Monday.
   In the resistance broadcast, Ranariddh said the Soviet Union,
which is to withdraw its last troops from Afghanistan next month if
it adheres to a U.N.-brokered accord, certainly will not continue to
bankroll the Vietnamese forces in Cambodia.
   ``Moreover, as it is currently working to improve its relations
with the United States, and especially China, the Soviet Union just
cannot continue to help Vietnam occupy Cambodia,'' he said.
   He added: ``Moreover, I have learned that the Soviet Union has
asked China to agree to negotiate with Vietnam. If the PRC (People's
Republic of China) accepts this Soviet proposal, the Soviet Union
will call directly on Norodom Sihanouk.
   ``And I have just learned that the PRC agreed to receive
Vietnam's minister or deputy minister of foreign affairs early next
February,'' he said.
   ``Based on all these points, it is not possible for Vietnam to
maintain the presence of its troops in Cambodia.''
   Ranariddh gave no details on the reported meeting.
   China and Vietnam, once allies, fought a brief but bloody border
war in 1979 after Vietnam's invasion of Cambodia. They still
periodically report border skirmishes.
   Vietnam has made a series of peace overtures to China in recent
years, but Vietnamese officials say the Chinese have rejected them
and demanded first the unconditional withdrawal of Vietnamese troops
from Cambodia.
   In Beijing Thursday, spokesman Li repeated China's position that
the key to the solution of the Cambodian conflict ``lies in the
genuine and complete Vietnamese troop withdrawal at the earliest
possible date and effective international supervision.''
   There is fear, however, that the strongest Cambodian resistance
group, the communist Khmer Rouge, might seize power after a
Vietnamese pullout and resume the ruthless repression that colored
its rule of the country from 1975 until the Vietnamese invasion.
   During that time, an estimated 2 million of Cambodia's 8 million
people died from Khmer Rouge executions, famine and civil unrest.
   Vietnam has said it will totally withdraw by 1990 whether there
is a settlement or not. Vietnam says it withdrew 50,000 troops last
year, leaving another 50,000 in Cambodia.

<HEAD>USDA Sets '89 Assessment at 1.12 Cents Per Pound</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Flue-cured tobacco farmers and buyers each will
be assessed 1.12 cents per pound for the 1989 crop, the Agriculture
Department said Thursday.
   The total of 2.24 cents covers a no-net cost assessment of 2
cents per pound and 0.24 cents to help cover the federal budget
deficit. The total 1989 assessment will be down slightly from last
year's 2.26 cents per pound.
   Department officials said they consulted with the Flue-cured
Tobacco Cooperative Stabilization Corp., the producer-owned
association that handles the support program, before determining the
1989 assessment.
   The budget deficit assessment will be imposed according to the
Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987, which calls for a
reduction in the price support level by 1.4 percent or,
alternatively, an assessment on producers to achieve an equal
reduction in spending.
   Officials said the 1989 price support for flue-cured tobacco will
remain at $1.468 per pound as announced on Dec. 15 for this year's
crop.

<HEAD>Many Rape Victims Blame Themselves, Fail To Report Attacks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN ROLL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TOWSON, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Many college women raped by their dates or
acquaintances don't report the attacks because they blame themselves
for losing control, a conference studying violence on the nation's
campuses was told.
   In addition, many women fail to realize they have become victims
of rape or attempted rape, and seldom report the attacks even to
their friends, experts said.
   ``What happens is that a guy pays for dinner, the movies, and he
thinks you get what you get in marriage. They see it as a mini,
quasi-marriage,'' said Laura X, director of the National
Clearinghouse on Marital and Date Rape. ``I don't think we're
getting rid of date rape until we get rid of that concept.''
   In such cases, women, because of their upbringing, often blame
themselves for being unable to control the situation, said Ms. X,
who said she uses the X to protest the lack of attention given to
women's historical role.
   About 250 psychologists, counselors, law enforcement officers,
students and others attended this week's Third National Conference
on Campus Violence here. The conference began Tuesday and ended
Thursday.
   Several reports discussed at the conference indicated that from
13 percent to 25 percent of college women become victims of rape or
attempted rape.
   As many as one in four female college students have been raped or
have been victims of attempted rape by the time they reach the age
of 21, according to a survey conducted on 32 campuses by Ms.
Magazine, the National Institute for Mental Health and psychologist
Mary P. Koss.
   The survey of 3,187 female and 3,000 male college students
randomly selected in the 1985-86 school year found only 27 percent
of the women deemed to have been victims of rape or attempted rape
considered themselves crime victims. The study found 84 percent of
the rape victims knew their assailants, but only 5 percent told
police they had been attacked.
   Experts blamed the non-reporting on a ``rape culture'' that holds
women primarily responsible for the outcome of relationships with
men, even when they're overpowered.
   Lt. Cathy Atwell, who directs the University of Maryland campus
police's date rape prevention program, said no rape reports were
filed with campus police in 1988 and only three were filed the
previous year. Some 38,000 students attend the College Park campus.
   Many colleges and universities have started rape prevention
programs. A leader in the effort is Ohio State University, which
instituted its Rape Education and Prevention Program in response to
an alleged gang rape.
   Sue Green, coordinator of the Ohio State effort, said her program
teaches women to recognize a potential date rapist and teaches them
how to fend off an attack.
   Carole Corcoran, who runs a rape prevention program at Mary
Washington College in Virginia, said the key to prevention is
teaching college men that forcing sex on a woman during a date
constitutes rape.
   Until men are more receptive, Ms. Corcoran's program stresses
``empowering strategies,'' including self-defense courses. She also
suggests women use a buddy system where one woman agrees to stay
sober and make sure the other steers clear of trouble.

<HEAD>Non White Males More Likely to Be Killed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN SKORNECK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The odds of becoming a murder victim are five
times greater for non-white males born now than for the overall
population of the United States, the FBI said Thursday.
   Americans born today have a 1 out of 177 chance of being
murdered, while the risk for non-white males is 1 in 38, according
to the study based on 1987 Uniform Crime Reporting statistics added
to a computer model.
   If there were no murders, the average lifespan for all Americans
would increase by almost 3 months, and the average lifespan for
non-white males would increase by more than 11 months, the study
found.
   Sharon Propheter, a statistician with the Uniform Crime Reporting
program, cautioned the predictions are based on 1987 figures and do
not account for the possibility of substantial changes in the murder
rates.
   ``We can't look into the future and say there are going to be so
many murders in 1999,'' said Propheter, who compiled the report with
statistician Harvey Rosenthal. ``This is based on what happened in
1987.''
   In 1987, when the murder rate was 8.3 per 100,000 population,
there were an estimated 20,100 murders. Of those, 9,510 were
non-white, 7,436 of them non-white males.
   The study _ which calculated the probabilities of being murdered
for newborns, those age 20 and those age 40 _ did not break down the
non-white category for blacks, Hispanics and other minorities,
Propheter said.
   The study predicted that while newborn non-white males have a one
in 38 chance of becoming a murder victim, the chance for non-white
females is one in 138. For both sexes, the chance is one in 60.
   For newborn white males, the chance is one in 204, while for
white females, it's one in 437 for a combined chance of one in 277.
   For newborns of all races, the chance of being murdered is one in
122 for males, one in 324 for females and one in 177 for both sexes.
   As for men who already have reached age 20, non-whites have a one
in 41 chance of being murdered, while whites have a one in 224
chance, for an overall chance of one in 136.
   For females who are now 20, non-whites have a one in 157
likelihood of being murdered, and whites have a one in 504 chance
for a total probability of one in 376.
   The least likely to be murdered _ among the ages calculated by
the FBI _ are white women who are now 40. They have only a one in
931 chance of being murdered. Of all the groups now 40, the highest
probability of being murdered remains non-white males, with a one in
97 chance.
   The overall murder rate in the United States has leaped 34
percent between 1967 and 1987, the FBI reported. In the past 10
years, the highest rate was 10.2 per 100,000 population in 1980, and
the lowest was 7.9 per 100,000 in 1984 and 1985. The 1987 rate of
8.3 per 100,000 compares with 2.5 per 100,000 in Canada.
   In 1987, 36.7 percent of murders resulted from arguments, and
19.6 percent occurred in connection with felonies such as robbery,
narcotics, sex offenses and arson, said Chris Waskiewicz, an editor
with the Uniform Crime Reporting unit.
   Meanwhile, 1.1 percent occurred from suspected felonies, 17.7
were miscellaneous _ including such things as the assailant being
under the influence of alcohol or drugs _ and the circumstances for
24.9 percent are unknown, she said.

   Lech Walesa said Thursday the people are
angry and trouble is in store unless a Communist Party Central
Committee meeting next week does something to improve living
conditions.
   Walesa, a shipyard electrician who founded the independent
Solidarity union movement in 1980, said Poles are restive and fed up
with high prices and shortages.
   ``We hope for God's sake that this plenum will go a little bit
farther than its own nose,'' He told a news conference in Gdansk.
``If it doesn't, it will be like a shout of encouragement to society
and to us all, and I don't know where we will end up.
   ``I appeal for getting out in front of society's demands. If not,
I'm really afraid.''
   The meeting Monday and Tuesday of the 230-member Central
Committee is expected to produce confrontation between conservatives
and those willing to recognize Solidarity and negotiate with the
opposition.
   Solidarity was legal after its birth in the labor turmoil of
August 1980 as the first free trade union in the Soviet bloc. It was
suppressed and outlawed after the imposition of martial law in
December 1981.
   Walesa said Solidarity wants to avoid unrest.
   ``We want it to be quiet ...both for the side of Solidarity and
the government ... to get ready for talks, for attempts at
solutions,'' he said. ``So we've given plenty of time.
   ``Unfortunately I am worried because there have been more and
more days, but no more solutions. ... There are price hikes, but
there is a lack of effect of reforms. ... Society is so tired, so
fed up with it.''
   He said he had expected protests to begin in April if nothing was
done, ``but it may happen sooner. Let's hope we can avoid it. Poland
really doesn't need it.''
   A rally of several thousand Solidarity supporters was held
Tuesday at the Lenin Shipyard in Gdansk, where Walesa works. He
mentioned that during the news conference, along with minor work
stoppages or strike threats at various plants in the past few weeks.
   In an appeal for unity, he said: ``If we start jumping out in
different places over different problems it will be anarchy, and it
will be a reason that may be used to strike against (the union's)
mainstream, to break, dissolve and destroy it.''

<HEAD>President Calls For Major Overhaul, Cleanup Of Atomic Arms Complex</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan on Thursday recommended
spending $81 billion over 20 years to modernize the government's
crippled nuclear arms factories and to begin cleaning up the
nationwide trail of waste left by four decades of bomb-making.
   President-elect Bush said he did not know whether he would
support the proposal, which was prepared by the Energy Department.
   The plan includes closing four nuclear materials plants,
consolidating work at other facilities and building two reactors to
make a radioactive gas vital to continued production of nuclear
warheads.
   Reagan, in a report to Congress, said the blueprint ``will enable
the administration and the Congress to adopt a long-term approach to
modernization rather than a piecemeal response to the problems
within the nuclear weapons complex.''
   The cost of modernizing the aging weapons-making plants through
the year 2010 would be at least $52 billion, the report said.
Cleanup costs over that period would total $29 billion, although the
report said environmental repairs would have to continue far beyond
2010. There are 17 major plants in 12 states.
   These figures are in addition to normal operating costs over the
next 20 years which, combined with the modernizing and cleanup
costs, would total $244 billion.
   The cost estimates underscore the difficulties facing the
incoming Bush administration, which has pledged to maintain the
nation's nuclear deterrent while protecting the environment and
cutting government spending to balance the budget.
   Coincidentally, Reagan sent his recommendations to Congress on
the same day that Bush nominated retired Adm. James D. Watkins to
head the Energy Department, which is responsible for developing,
building and testing the nation's nuclear warheads.
   Bush told a news conference he did not feel bound by the
recommendations in Reagan's report and indicated he would make no
decisions on the weapons plants problem until after he and Watkins
had studied the security implications.
   ``I think there's a risk, if we imprudently go forward, until he
and I have had a chance to take a hard look,'' Bush said.
   Watkins was trained in nuclear engineering during a 1958 stint at
Oak Ridge, Tenn., National Laboratory _ one of the military-related
nuclear weapons facilities.
   Concern over the nuclear weapons complex heightened last fall
after the last of the nation's tritium-producing reactors at the
Savannah River Plant near Aiken, S.C., was shut down for safety
reasons. Tritium is a short-lived gas that is vital in nearly all
U.S. nuclear warheads. Pentagon officials have expressed concern
that unless at least one tritium-making reactor is restarted soon
the nation's nuclear arsenal could be weakened.
   Reagan's report to Congress said it was unlikely the Savannah
River reactors would be operating before the end of the year. The
unclassified version released publicly did not say whether that
would be soon enough to avoid a tritium shortage.
   It appeared to suggest, however, that even after costly safety
and technical improvements, the Savannah River facilities would be
unable to supply enough tritium.
   ``In spite of these improvements and increasingly extensive
maintenance, the reactors may not be able to achieve acceptable
production efficiencies,'' the report said.
   The report specifically recommended:
   _Investing $400 million to improve safety and technical
operations at the Rocky Flats plutonium-processing plant near
Denver, Colo., and then spending $6.1 billion to close down the
plant and transfer its operations to other sites.
   _Phasing out all nuclear materials-processing work at the Hanford
Plant near Richland, Wash., between 1995 and 2000. A cost estimate
was not made available. This plant, opened in 1944, was one of three
original Manhattan Project sites responsible for producing
plutonium, including the material used in the bomb that destroyed
Nagasaki.
   _Shutting down the Feed Materials Production Center at Fernald,
Ohio, and shifting its operations elsewhere. The report gave no
specific cost figure and did not say where the Fernald activities
should be moved. This plant, which makes uranium metal cores used in
nuclear reactors at Savannah River and Hanford, has drawn fierce
public opposition due to leaks of uranium dust into the atmosphere
and toxic chemicals and uranium into wells used for drinking water.
   _Transferring the nuclear waste-recovery operations of the Mound
Plant, near Cincinnati, to other unspecified Energy Department
weapons plants at a cost of $255 million, starting in 1995. The
plant's main work _ producing small explosive devices and timers for
nuclear weapons _ would continue at the same site.
   _Building two new nuclear reactors to produce tritium. The report
said the preferred sites would be at Savannah River and at the Idaho
National Engineering Laboratory, near Idaho Falls. It estimated the
combined cost at $6.6 billion.

   A Canadian cargo plane crashed and exploded
in a fireball near a row of houses Thursday, killing the two pilots
aboard and setting nearby woods afire, authorities said.
   ``We thought we were dead. That's how close it was,'' said Dewey
Meade, who was in his home a few hundred yards from the crash site.
``We've got debris all over the roof and everything.''
   No one on the ground was injured, and no homes suffered serious
damage.
   Bruce Jonasson, manager of Bradley First Air, said pilots from
Montreal and Ottawa were the plane's only occupants. Jonasson
declined to release their names until families had been notified.
   A small quantity of explosive and corrosive materials were aboard
the plane, but they posed no environmental hazard, Jonasson said.
   The twin-engine plane took off from Dayton International Airport
and crashed at 4:45 a.m. in a heavily wooded area about a half-mile
away, said James Francis, acting aviation director for Dayton.
   Meade described it as ``a fireball coming right at the side of my
house.''
   The explosion set fire to about 100 yards of wooded area, said
Lt. Jim Bowell of the Butler Township Fire Department. Several
witnesses reported seeing a fireball in the air before the crash.
   Several hours after the crash, broken limbs and branches
surrounded the smoldering wreckage and small fires continued to
burn, although they were later extinguished. Boxes and other cargo
littered the area.
   Two bodies were discovered at the site, one in the wreckage of
the Hawker-Siddley turboprop and the other nearby, said Gene Brown,
chief investigator for the Montgomery County coronor's office.
   The plane, owned by Bradley First Air, of Ottawa, Canada, was
carrying cargo to Montreal for Emery Air Freight Corp., an air
freight courier service with a hub at the Dayton airport. It was at
least 9 years old.
   Airport officials said they were unsure how long the aircraft was
in the air following takeoff.
   Gary Hess, an Emery employee, saw the plane go down as he was
getting off work at the airport.
   ``It was kind of like just going across the horizon, and then it
just blew,'' he said. ``It was just a big ball of fire.''
   Joe Weitz, another Emery employee, said the plane appeared to
burst into flame shortly after it cleared the runway.

   A cockpit recorder recovered by an underwater
robot from the year-old wreckage of a South African Airways Boeing
747 nearly three miles deep in the Indian Ocean could provide the
latest clue in a $6 million effort to determine cause of the crash
that killed 159 people.
   The recorder's tape, recovered from the ocean last week, was
taken Thursday by South African investigators to the National
Transportation Safety Board, where it was copied for use by the
investigators.
   Safety board officials said they only provided equipment for
processing the tape and would have no role in playing, transcribing
or analysing it. The Unites States is providing the technical
assistance at the request of the South African government.
   Meanwhile, search continues in the Indian Ocean for other
evidence in the Nov. 28, 1987, crash, including the flight data
recorder, which would include technical information on the last few
minutes of the flight. The cockpit tape, which officials said was
flooded but has been cleaned and dried, records all talk and other
noise in the cockpit.
   Eastport International of Upper Marlboro, Md., which has been
involved in deep-water recovery of wreckage of the space shuttle
Challenger as well as other air crashes, retrieved the recorder last
Friday from a depth of 14,800 feet with its $5 million ``remote
recovery vehicle'' known as Gemini 6000.
   Craig Mullen, president of the company, said in a telephone
interview that the plane ``looks like it went in intact and hit at a
high rate of speed.'' He said recovered parts show evidence the
plane may have been on fire.
   The South African government has refused to release contents of a
control tower tape of conversation with the airliner pilot, who
officials earlier said reported smoke in his cockpit before the
crash. The government says contents of the conversation ``might be
misunderstood or cause embarrassment.''
   The airliner was on a flight from Taipei, Taiwan, to
Johannesburg, when it disappeared near the island of Mauritius where
it was to make a scheduled landing. Only 11 bodies were recovered
and it took two months to locate the wreckage which Mullen said is
strewn over a square mile of deep ocean. The victims included
Taiwanese, South Africans and Japanese.
   The recorder box, about a foot square, was found lying by itself
and was picked up as the Gemini was preparing to bring a larger
piece of the aircraft to the surface, Mullen said.

   Mount Blanc, Western Europe's highest peak,
is 10.6 feet shorter than reported on world maps, the Italian army's
Geographic Institute reported Thursday.
   The institute said that measurements made from satellites and
more sophisticated equipment showed that Mount Blanc, in the western
Alps, stands at 15,862.4 feet, compared with a previously accepted
height of 15,873 feet.
   In August, the same institute revised upward the height of Mount
Rose, the second-highest Alpine peak, to 15,312 feet, from 15,302
feet.

<TEXT>
   As many as 2,000 Nicaraguans now able to leave Texas
because of a judge's order likely will come to Miami this week,
taxing the capacity of local government, officials said Thursday.
   Earlier this week, a federal judge in Texas issued a temporary
restraining order lifting an immigration policy that restricted
immigrants to the area near the Mexican border. Officials there say
that probably 5,000 exiles are affected, and a Miami shelter
official, Cristobal Mendoza, said the city will probably have 2,000
new arrivals by the weekend.
   Managers of bus stations in South Texas told reporters that 95
percent or more of the Nicaraguans who left there Wednesday were
going to Miami. Permission was given to 739 exiles to leave
Brownsville on Wednesday.
   As the buses pulled into Miami on Wednesday and Thursday, hopeful
Nicaraguans climbed off, eager to reunite with their families and
find jobs.
   But city officials, who originally thought they would spend this
week getting ready for the Super Bowl, say the aliens may not find
the haven they expect.
   ``The inn is full,'' City Manager Cesar Odio said, referring to
Miami Bobby Maduro Stadium, home now to more than 250 immigrants.
And those already there must be out by Jan. 25 _ when the Baltimore
Orioles baseball team will arrive for spring training.
   The judge's order in Texas was to relieve the conditions of
aliens stuck there for weeks, many living in squalid conditions.
   Now they can stay wherever they like while they wait for their
cases to be reviewed, and many have chosen Miami.
   Dade County Manager Joaquin Avino said some county land is being
cleared for as many as 60 trailers, which will provide temporary
housing.
   New immigration rules are responsible for much of the confusion
surrounding this latest influx of immigrants, Perry Rivkind,
district director of the Immigration and Naturalization Service said
Thursday.
   In the past, those who arrived illegally in the United States
were entitled to work permits if they could not be interviewed about
their applications for asylum within 60 days. But applicants now
must get a favorable ruling from the INS before getting a permit.
   ``What people don't understand that come here illegally today is
that the U.S. Congress passed employer sanctions,'' said Rivkind.
``Without the work permit, the employers are not going to chance
getting into trouble.''
   Many of the aliens said they headed to Miami because they had
heard the city was supportive of them.
   ``Throughout Mexico, they kept on telling us about Bobby Maduro
stadium,'' said Sergio Castillo. He passed through Mexico crossing
the Rio Grande on Sunday and arrived in Miami by bus Wednesday. ``So
I came here. But I thought everybody could enter.''
   Castillo and 14 others were locked out of the stadium Wednesday
night. He said he spent much of that night walking the streets,
looking for a place to stay.

   President-elect Bush completed his Cabinet on
Thursday, picking retired naval chief James D. Watkins, an expert on
nuclear power, as energy secretary and appointing former Education
Secretary William Bennett to help lead an ``all-out war against
drugs.''
   Bush said Watkins' experience would serve him well in devising a
strategy for a multibillion-dollar cleanup of the nation's aging and
increasingly unsafe nuclear weapons plants.
   Bush said he would not try to tone down Bennett, who has a
reputation for being blunt and blustery. ``I'm not going to ask him
to renounce that vim and that vigor and that determination that made
him a howling success'' in Reagan's administration, Bush said.
   Bennett, a two-pack-a-day cigarette smoker who has tried to quit
and failed, vowed he would give up his habit before beginning his
new job.
   Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Joseph R. Biden Jr., D-Del.,
praised Bennett for his ``reputation for being tough and for
confronting issues head on'' but said he was concerned about
Bennett's lack of law enforcement background.
   Biden said Bennett in the past ``has been critical of our public
school system. I hope that his attitude will change to recognize, as
I do, the crucial role the public schools can play in helping our
youngest children recognize the dangers of drug abuse.''
   Sen. James A. McClure, R-Idaho, senior GOP member of the Senate
Energy and Natural Resources Committee, called Watkins
``straightforward and capable.''
   U.S. arms control adviser Edwin L. Rowny praised the selection of
Watkins and called it a boost for the Strategic Defense Initiative,
also known as Star Wars, which seeks to develop a space-based
defense against Soviet ballistic missiles.
   Rep. Charles B. Rangel, D-N.Y., chairman of the House narcotics
committee, said he is ready to work with Bennett ``to fully fund the
anti-drug programs the Congress has authorized and to develop a
thorough, well thought-out strategy. I hope is is forthcoming with
creative ideas. He must take bold initiatives and generate new
resources to solve the drug crisis in our nation.''
   Bush announced his personnel choices at a news conference shortly
before convening the first informal meeting of his Cabinet across
the street from the White House at Blair House, the government guest
home.
   Bush said he wanted Cabinet chiefs ``to think big ... to
challenge the system ... to adhere to the highest ethical
standards.'' And he said, ``I'm going to tell them I don't like
kiss-and-tell books.''
   ``I don't mind differences being aired,'' Bush said. ``I want
them to be frank, I want them to fight hard for their position.''
Yet he said he expected them to support his decisions once they're
made.
   Replying to a question, Bush said he was ``not entirely''
comfortable with the cost of his inauguration, which could reach $25
million. However, Bush said, ``I have no apologies for the way we're
doing it at all'' because the country deserves a celebration like
the inauguration every four years.
   Bush, who takes office Jan. 20, acknowledged that he faces huge
costs both in the cleanup of nuclear weapons facilities and the
crisis of the savings and loan industry.
   However, Bush, who during the campaign promised not to raise
taxes, said he would solve both problems ``within the confines, the
parameters of the commitment I made to the American people.''
   In introducing Watkins, Bush said, ``I'm committed to solving the
problems that exist within our atomic energy-defense complex.''
   He refused to embrace the recommendations of a report sent to
President Reagan calling for spending $81 billion to modernize the
nuclear weapons complex over the next two decades and the closing of
four major facilities. Bush said he wanted Watkins to review all
options before devising an energy policy ``that clearly will include
the safety and cleanup'' of the nuclear plants.
   Bush said development of nuclear power for domestic as well as
military needs was ``not at all incompatible'' with safety and
environmental concerns.
   Bush said he told Watkins he wanted him to consider choosing a
deputy with experience in the oil and gas industry, but said he
would not impose that choice. Trying to reassure Texas producers,
Bush said they would have a president who knows the oil and gas
industry well.
   Watkins, asked how he would shore up oil prices, replied,
``You're touching me in an Achilles' heel. I'm not an expert in this
area.'' He said, however, he was a fast learner.
   Acknowledging that Bennett has been closely identified with the
Republican Party's conservative wing, Bush said that his new ``drug
czar'' would have to work with Democrats and Republicans alike.
   Bennett said that ``everybody has critics, particularly people
who try to do anything.'' He promised to pursue his new job with
``great seriousness and humility.''
   Bennett said, ``This drug business is a serious business and this
government, this administration intends to take it seriously.''
   Watkins said he was taking the energy post with a commitment to
make sure ``safety is never subverted (and) the environment is
adequately protected'' while nuclear energy is developed.
   On other topics raised by reporters, Bush:
   _Defended his decision to attend the funeral of Japanese Emperor
Hirohito, though he said that if someone had raised the possibility
of his current situation after his plane was shot down by the
Japanese in 1944, ``I would have found that hard to believe.''
   _Applauded a Soviet announcement that that nation would reduce
stocks of chemical weapons and said, ``I'm glad the Soviets have
joined us in that. We've been doing that for some time.'' Regarding
international pressure on Libya to not produce chemical weapons,
Bush said, ``My view is that I will follow on what this
administration has been doing to try to find verifiable ways of
eliminating these things.''
   _Said U.S. oil reserves are not threatened by labor unrest in
Mexico's oil fields and saluted the Mexican president's ``very
bold'' crackdown on the oil workers union.
   Watkins, 61, chief of naval operations until 1986 under Reagan,
is a nuclear warfare expert whose name had not been widely mentioned
until recently as a possible candidate for the energy post.
   He was chairman of a presidential commission on AIDS that last
year called for new laws to protect victims of the deadly disease
from discrimination.
   Bennett, 45, the blunt-spoken education chief under Reagan and a
leader of conservative forces, left government last September to
lecture and write.
   Bush had a hard time filling both the energy and drug posts.
After a quick start in naming his Cabinet, he now winds up with the
modern-day record for lateness in completing his senior
appointments. The mark had been held by Reagan, who completed his
Cabinet on Jan. 8 _ four days ahead of when Bush finished.
   Bush had promised to include women and minorities in his Cabinet.
He will begin his presidency with a Cabinet of 13 men and one woman,
Elizabeth Dole at Labor. Carla Hills, picked as the U.S. trade
representative, has Cabinet rank but is not an official member of
the Cabinet.
   One black, Louis Sullivan as chief of health and human services,
and two Hispanics, Lauro Cavazos as education secretary and Manuel
Lujan Jr. as interior secretary, are in the Bush Cabinet.
   Unlike the Reagan Cabinet, the Bush team is generally regarded as
a Republican establishment group that is non-ideological and
pragmatic.
   After meeting with his Cabinet, Bush heads off Friday to the
Florida Keys for a weekend of sport fishing in the Everglades. It
will be his third fishing or hunting trip since his election two
months ago.

<HEAD>Letter Claims Responsibility for Pan Am Bomb</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A letter signed ``Jewish Defence League'' that
reached the London office of the Associated Press on Thursday
claimed responsibility for the bomb planted on Pan Am Flight 103.
   There was no evidence that the letter, which used the British
spelling ``defence,'' came from the Jewish Defense League, which is
based in the United States.
   ``We think the moment has come to disclose to the world from
which side the bomb was placed which destroyed the Boeing 737 from
Panam,'' the typewritten letter said. ``We, a radical group of the
Jewish Defence League, take the responsibility for this action.''
   Mordechai Levy, a spokesman who returned a call to the JDL
offices in New York, said: ``Anyone could type a letter. It was not
us. ... Why would we or any other Jewish group bomb an American
plane?''
   Levy said his group now is called the Jewish Defense Organization.
   The plane blown up by a bomb Dec. 21 was a Boeing 747, not a 737.
The letter said the bomb was planted ``by our fighters in
Frankfurt'' to protest the U.S. decision a week earlier to open
talks with the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   It bore a Dutch stamp and a Leeuwarden postmark. Another postmark
had been added in London, apparently because it was insufficiently
addressed and required rerouting.
   ``We are firmly decided to continue our attacks on U.S.A. objects
until the American Government returns from its detestable policy,''
it said. ``We mean the condemnable friendly connections with our
enemy, the P.L.O.''
   Scotland Yard said it was investigating the claim.
   Comments by police in Leeuwarden, northern Holland, cast doubt on
the letter's authenticity.
   A police officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, said there
had been previous cases of Dutch citizens making false claims of
responsibility for violent incidents.
   Ian Geldard, an expert at the independent Institute for the Study
of Terrorism, also was skeptical. If the motive was the U.S.-PLO
connection, he said, it would have been impossible to prepare and
plant a sophisticated bomb in the few days between the U.S.
announcement and the crash.
   Geldard also said he doubted the JDL had access to the plastic
explosive Semtex, which officials say probably Semtex was used for
the bomb. All 259 people on the plane and 11 on the ground were
killed.
   The Jewish Defense League was founded in the United States in the
1960s by Rabbi Meir Kahane, who now lives in Israel and pursues a
militant anti-Arab line.
   An Iranian group also claimed responsibility for the bombing in
two telephone calls to the AP in London, calling it retaliation for
the shooting down of an Iranian passenger jet in July by a U.S.
warship in the Persian Gulf.

<HEAD>Bush Assures Angolan Rebel Leader Of Support</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President-elect Bush said Thursday he intends
to support Angolan rebel leader Jonas Savimbi and, at the same time,
push for peace talks between the rebels and the Marxist government.
   Bush confirmed he had sent a letter to Savimbi last week on the
occasion of the signing of a U.S.-mediated agreement for the pullout
of Cuban troops from Angola.
   ``I want to join you in welcoming this great diplomatic
achievement, which holds out so much hope for the Angolan people,''
Bush said in the letter.
   But he added that the next step must be talks between Savimbi's
Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) and the
government of Jose Eduardo Dos Santos on ending their 14-year civil
war.
   Bush said his administration ``will accord the highest priority
to the full and prompt implementation'' of the pullout accord so
that Angolans can settle their future ``without the destructive
presence of foreign military forces.''
   Until then, ``my administration will continue all appropriate and
effective assistance to UNITA,'' the letter said.
   In brief comments at a news conference, Bush said that ``clearly
in expressing determination to support UNITA and urge at the same
time reconciliation between Dos Santos and Savimbi, I'm for that
policy and I want to try and enhance it.''
   There is strong bipartisan support in Congress for the $15
million annual appropriation to UNITA to fight the Cuban-backed
government.

<HEAD>Polls Show Support For Bilingual Signs, Free Trade</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SOLL SUSSMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Most Canadians believe bilingual commercial signs
with messages in English and French should be allowed in the French
enclave of Quebec, according to a Gallup poll published Thursday.
   The poll, published in the Toronto Star, also found growing
support for the Canadian-U.S. free trade agreement.
   According to the survey, 85 percent of all Canadians and 61
percent of Quebec residents favor bilingual signs.
   Tensions have increased in the predominantly French-speaking
province since December, when the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that
a provincial law requiring all signs to be only in French was
unconstitutional.
   The provincial government overrode the ruling and issued
compromise legislation that allows bilingual signs indoors but still
requires all outdoor signs to be in French only.
   Gallup said the poll surveyed 1,021 Canadians Jan. 4-7 and has a
margin of error of 3 percent.
   Supporters of Quebec's language restrictions argue that the
province is an island of French culture in English-speaking North
America and entitled to protect its special qualities.
   Power in Quebec shifted from the English minority to the French,
which make up 81 percent of the population, during the 1970s, a
tumultuous decade of separatist sentiment that subsided when voters
rejected a sovereignty referendum in 1980.
   The law requiring all commercial signs to be in French was passed
in 1977.
   The Globe and Mail, which calls itself Canada's national
newspaper, said in an editorial Thursday that Quebec Premier Robert
Bourassa ``has received, and deserves, strong criticism for his
decision on the language of commercial signs in Quebec. ... There is
a danger, however, in raising the temperature on this issue.''
   The Gallup poll also found increased support for the
Canadian-U.S. free trade agreement since the Nov. 21 election that
cleared the way for the deal.
   According to the poll, 45 percent of Canadians support the
agreement, under which all tariffs between the two nations will be
eliminated within 10 years.
   Before the election, which hinged mainly on free trade, Gallup
found that 34 percent of Canadians supported the pact. The latest
poll indicated that 29 percent oppose it, down from 41 percent
before the election.
   Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's Progressive Conservative Party
won its second consecutive majority government in the election, and
he signed the trade pact with President Reagan in January 1988.

   Five songs, including Billie Holiday's ``Lover

academy's hall of fame.
   The hall of fame awards were established to honor recordings made

made in 1958.
   ``This Land Is Your Land,'' was released on Asch records in 1947,
while ``Lover Man (Oh, Where Can You Be?)'' was released on Decca in
1945 and ``Ornithology'' on Dial in 1946.
   The other two inducted songs are classical works. ``Bartok:
Contrasts For Violin, Clarinet and Piano,'' with Bela Bartok on
piano, Joseph Szigeti on violin and Benny Goodman on clarinet was
released on Columbia in 1940.
   ``Beethoven: Concertos for Piano Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,'' with Artur
Schnabel and Malcolm Sargent conducting the London Symphony for the
first and fifth concertos and the London Philharmonic for the Nos. 2
through 4, was released on Victor in 1955.
   The hall of fame songs are chosen by vote of a 100-member
elections committee composed of music historians, musicologists and
other experts. The five songs will be formally inducted at the
televised Grammy Awards on Feb. 22 on CBS.

   Prosecutors arrested a senior
government party lawmaker on corruption charges Thursday in their
investigation of alleged abuses under the authoritarian rule of
former President Chun Doo-hwan.
   Lee Hak-bong, a member of parliament from the party in power, the
Democratic Justice Party, was charged with taking bribes and with
aiding corrupt relatives of Chun while he was Chun's chief
presidential secretary.
   Lee served as a top official at government security organizations
after helping Chun seize power with military backing in 1980.
   His was the first such arrest of a government lawmaker accused of
corruption. Prosecutors in recent weeks have arrested government
officials on charges of extorting money from businesses, diverting
government funds, selling influence and forcing political donations.
   Chun has denied any personal corruption, but his relatives,
associates and former government ministers have been arrested or
convicted of dishonest practices. The former president went into
rural exile last month after apologizing for misdeeds under his rule.
   President Roh Tae-woo, once a close ally of Chun, asked Koreans
to forgive his disgraced predecessor. But the opposition says it
will not agree to consider a pardon for Chun until he appears for a
National Assembly probe.
   The opposition-controled assembly has been investigating
allegations of human rights violations and other wrongdoings under
Chun's seven-year rule, which ended in February 1988.
   Prosecutors also on Thursday questioned Kim Ju-ho, former head of
the Office of Supply, on charges of selling influence in importing
rice from the United States.
   The prosecutors spoke on condition of anonymity.

   Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu held what he called ``a very good conversation'' Thursday
with Secretary of State George P. Shultz amid indications Israel
will soon unveil a new plan for settling its conflict with the Arabs.
   Netanyahu declined to say after the 40-minute session whether he
outlined proposals for Shultz. But the Israeli official said he
would return to Washington in the near future with ``some good
suggestions.''
   They are likely to be based on the 1978 Camp David agreement,
which produced a peace treaty in 1979 between Israel and Egypt and
held out the prospect of self-rule for the 1.3 million Palestinian
Arabs who live on the West Bank and in Gaza.
   The U.S. decision last month to open talks with the Palestine
Liberation Organization and continuing violence in the territories
have put pressure on Israel to deal with the Palestinian problem.

   Geraldo Rivera may have trouble finding
something in vaults, but not New York City's tax collectors.
   The state's top court Thursday upheld the city's authority to
collect taxes from the owners of underground vaults that extend
beneath public streets and sidewalks.
   Unlike Al Capone's vault, which Rivera found empty in a
nationally televised program, there's money in New York City vaults.
The city is owed an estimated $20.3 million in back taxes dating to
1962, according to the city Finance Department.
   The Court of Appeals ruled against a Manhattan property owner who
complained that he shouldn't have to pay a $250,000 tax bill on his
vault because he didn't use it.
   ``It's the biggest crime in the world,'' said lawyer Philip
Smith, owner of the $20 million building.
   There are 14,616 underground vaults in the city, said Claire
Tallarico, spokeswoman for the Finance Department. Since 1962, the
city has imposed a yearly tax of $2 per square foot on the vaults,
some of which are ``cavernous,'' she said.
   ``It's the biggest bargain for storage space in town, we think,''
Tallarico said.
   Many property owners, however, complained they didn't even know
they had the vaults until they received a tax bill.
   Smith said the basement of his building is used to store
furniture for an Ethan Allen franchise, but the vault has been
unoccupied since it was flooded in the 1960s.
   The finance department said the vault is taxable unless it is
rendered unusable by a wire mesh screen or sheetrock partition with
an opening no larger than three feet by three feet.
   All seven Court of Appeals judges said Smith could be taxed
because he didn't follow these rules.
   Smith said the entrance to his vault is barricaded by
cinderblocks.
   ``How can they say a chicken-wire fence is more inaccessible than
cinderblocks?'' he said.

<HEAD>Many States Expanding Medicaid Coverage, Report Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Many states, in spite of their own tight
budgets, are adding benefits to their Medicaid plans and expanding
eligibility beyond federal requirements, a report by a federally
funded health-policy research group said Thursday.
   The favorites among optional coverages being added are
maternity-related benefits, according to the report by the
Intergovernmental Health Policy Project at George Washington
University.
   ``They see there is a potential payoff (touted by) all those
studies that show when you invest in prenatal care, you're going to
lower the costs later on by producing healthier babies,'' said Debra
Lipson, senior research associate at the project.
   ``That's been a pretty easy sales job on states,'' she said.
   Since September 1987, legislatures in 19 states have added funds
to their Medicaid programs to cover new services for pregnant women,
the report said.
   In addition, by August 1988, some 45 states had expanded Medicaid
eligibility for pregnant women and infants, although seven of the
states won't implement the new standards until this year, the report
said.
   These moves came in advance of changes in federal law that will
require states to cover infants and pregnant women at or below 75
percent of the federal poverty level by July 1 and up to 100 percent
of the federal poverty level by July 1, 1990.
   Other benefits being added by states include expanded coverage
for hospice services, community-based long-term care, prescription
drugs and dental services, the report said.
   ``No state reported making any significant cuts in benefits''
during the period studied, which was September 1987 through December
1988, the report said.
   States also are making changes in their administration and
management of Medicaid programs to control costs, the report said.
Last year, 12 states changed the way they review elective admissions
to hospitals. Other states are encouraging enrollment in health
maintenance organizations.
   The report offers no conclusions or recommendations, but Lipson
said it ``disputes the notion that cost-savings and innovation only
come from the private sector.''
   The Medicaid program is funded by the federal and state
governments and is administered by the states. The total cost of the
program _ all federal and state funds _ was $52 billion in fiscal
1987.
   Lipson said she had no figure for the number of recipients who
would be added to the Medicaid rolls as a result of the changes
being made by the states. However, she noted that President Reagan's
fiscal 1990 budget proposal to Congress estimated that Medicaid
would serve 25.7 million people, compared with 23.9 million
currently.
   The project is funded by the Health Care Financing Administration
of the Department of Health and Human Services.

<HEAD>Mubarak Chides Shamir; Newspaper Reports New Peace Plan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Hosni Mubarak on Thursday urged
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of Israel to agree to an international
Middle East peace conference.
   In a related development, a state-run newspaper in the United
Arab Emirates said Shamir has proposed a peace conference that would
include the superpowers and Palestinian representatives elected from
the Israeli-occupied lands.
   A Shamir spokesman denied the report and said Shamir still is
working on a new peace proposal.
   Mubarak reiterated on Thursday that he will not visit Israel
unless that country agrees to an international peace conference on
the Palestinian conflict.
   ``All countries of the world except Israel'' have accepted such a
conference as the proper framework for Arab-Israeli peace talks,
Mubarak said. A conference, under U.N. auspices, would bring
together concerned parties and the five permanent members of the
U.N. Security Council.
   Egypt and the Palestine Liberation Organization say the
conference should lead to direct Arab-Israeli talks.
   Mubarak told reporters he plans to discuss peace and other
regional problems when he visits Washington after President-elect
George Bush takes office on Jan. 20.
   Asked about prospects of his visiting Israel, Mubarak replied:
   ``I cannot visit Israel particularly after Mr. Shamir announced
he will not make territorial concessions and does not accept an
international peace conference. He is not giving something in return
or (paying) a price for my visit, and we will not go there to have
tea and coffee or to have a good time.''
   Shamir has refused to relinquish any Arab territory Israeli
forces now occupy: the West Bank, the Gaza Strip and the Golan
Heights, all seized in the 1967 Middle East war.
   Egypt and Israel signed the Camp David accord in 1978 and
established diplomatic relations, but Mubarak has not visited Israel
since taking office in 1981.
   In Abu Dhabi, the state-run newspaper Al-Ittihad said a new plan
by Shamir was presented to U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz and
to his Soviet counterpart, Eduard Shevardnadze on Sunday in Paris.
   Al-Ittihad attributed the report to an unidentified source in
Washington that it described as ``close to the U.S. administration.''
   The paper said the plan proposed ``a Middle East peace conference
hosted by the superpowers'' and talks between Israel and
``Palestinians to be elected in the occupied territories.''
   At the end of a three-year autonomy _ two years less than the
autonomy under the Camp David accords _ Shamir proposed a
confederation with Jordan and the Palestinians and allowing
Palestinians and Jordan an access to the sea, it said.
   Under the plan, Israel, Palestine and Jordan would be linked
economically in a way similar to that of the European Economic
Community and a joint authority should be created to explore water
and soil, Al-Ittihad said.
   The Camp David accords were a tripartite framework for an overall
Arab-Israeli settlement that was signed by the United States, Egypt
and Israel in 1978. It was rejected by other Arab nations.
   Shamir spokesman Yosi Achimeir said the Al-Ittihad report was
``just speculation. Nothing formal has been released, although the
prime minister is considering many plans based on Camp David.
   Foreign Minister Moshe Arens, not Shamir, was in Paris on Sunday
to meet with Shultz.
   ``No peace plan was presented by Mr. Arens in Paris. Shamir is
now working on a plan to be presented to President Bush in March,
but nothing has been completed yet,'' Achimeir said.
   Achimeir said the plan would contain ``no peace conference, but
there could be a ceremonial opening by the superpowers or an
initiative by the secretary-general of the United Nations.''

   The space agency, scarred by the Challenger
accident in which the first ``teacher in space'' was killed,
announced Thursday it will no longer carry non-astronauts or other
non-essential personnel on the space shuttle.
   Passengers have in the past included a Saudi Arabian prince, and
members of the Senate and House of Representatives.
   The new policy covers members of the news media, who were in
final competition for a ride on the shuttle at the time of
Challenger; and Barbara Morgan, a backup to Christa McAuliffe, the
teacher who was among the seven people killed when the spacecraft
exploded in January, 1986.
   ``The Challenger accident marked a major change in the U.S.
outlook and policies with respect to the flight of other than NASA
astronauts,'' the National Aeronautics and Space Administration said
in a policy statement. ``NASA and interested external parties,
domestic and internatijonal, must reexamine previous understandings,
expectations, and commitments regarding flight opportunities.''
   The agency said flight opportunities generally will be limited to
professional astronauts and payload specialists essential for
mission requirements while NASA works to improve the reliability of
the shuttle and reduces a payload backlog.
   The new policy establishes an additional category _ ``space
flight participants.''
   It embraces those ``whose presence on board the space shuttle is
not required for operation of payloads or for other essential
mission mission activities, but is determined by the administrator
of NASA to contribute to other approved NASA objectives or to be in
the national interest.''
   Sen. Jake Garn, R-Utah, flew on the shuttle in April 1985 and
Rep. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., was aboard in January 1986, at the
invitation of NASA's administrator.
   Both hold positions important to the space program on
congressional committees and the official explanation was that the
flights were important to their oversight responsibilities.
   In 1985, shuttle passengers included Sultan Al-Saud of Saudi
Arabia and Rodolfo Neri Vela, a Mexican. They were aboard, NASA
said, to ``observe'' the launches of the Arabsat and Morelos-B
communications satellites being launched for their countries.
   NASA said that while it remains committed to a long-term goal of
providing such flight opportunities, it is devoting its energies to
proving the shuttle to be safe and reliable.
   ``Accordingly, flight opportunities for space flight participants
are not available at this time,'' NASA said. ``When NASA determines
that a flight opportunity is available for a space flight
participant, first priority will be given to a Teacher in Space in
fulfillment of space education plans.''
   All shuttle flights will be planned with a minimum crew of five
NASA astronauts and can be increased to a maximum of seven for
payload or other mission requirements. Such added crew members have
to be picked at least 12 months before the flight and first
consideration will be given to NASA's own people.

<HEAD>Presidium Gives Disputed Region Special Status</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government gave special status Thursday to
Nagorno-Karabakh, a disputed region with a predominantly Armenian
population, but kept it within the republic of Azerbaijan, Tass
reported.
   The decision by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet represented
another attempt by Moscow to ease tension over the area, focus of a
struggle between ethnic Armenians and Azerbaijanis that has led to
60 deaths in the past year.
   About 200,000 refugees have left Nagorno-Karabakh for Armenia,
which wants to annex it. The region is an enclave in Azerbaijan, to
which it was assigned in 1923.
   Martial law and curfews were imposed in many parts of the two
Caucasus republics two months ago to quell ethnic violence.
   Tass said Thursday's decision was made at a meeting of the
Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, the government's highest executive
body, convened by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to consider
``urgent'' issues.
   Unconfirmed reports had circulated for more than a month that the
Kremlin would transfer Nagorno-Karabakh to the Russian federation,
largest of the 15 Soviet republics, in an effort to end the dispute.
   A Tass statement Thursday, however, made clear it would remain
within Azerbaijan.
   The official news agency said the Presidium ``found it expedient
to temporarily introduce in the Nagorno-Karabakh autonomous region a
special form of administration, with Nagorno-Karabakh retaining its
status as an autonomous region incorporated in Azerbaijan.''
   It did not describe the special administration, but said a decree
would be published later.
   Gorbachev said last week a special commission of the Communist
Party Politburo would meet Wednesday to consider the ethnic dispute,
but there was no word that such a meeting had occurred.
   Tass said the party chiefs of the two republics met in Moscow on
Wednesday and agreed to try to persuade people who fled ethnic
violence to return home.
   Armenian residents of Nagorno-Karabakh began agitating in
February for annexation by Armenia, and huge demonstrations for the
cause were held in Yerevan, the Armenian capital, and other cities
of the southern republic.
   In July, the Presidium rejected the annexation requests but
announced a program of economic and other aid for Nagorno-Karabakh.

   Time is running out for the Security
Council to approve a peacekeeping force that would be ready by the
April 1 deadline to oversee Namibia's move to independence, a U.N.
official said Thursday.
   The Security Council has been deadlocked for weeks over demands
by its five permanent members that the cost of the force be cut.
Also, the non-aligned members insist that the maximum force of 7,500
peacekeepers be dispatched.
   Council members continued to consult this week in an effort to
reach a compromise, said U.N. spokesman Francois Giuliani.
   Plans for the Namibia force call for up to 7,500 peacekeepers,
2,000 civilian administrators and 360 police to supervise Namibia's
transition to independence after 74 years of South African rule.
   U.N. officials have estimated a peacekeeping mission that large
would cost $600 million to $800 million, more than the combined cost
of last year's peacekeeping activities.
   The five permanent members of the Security Council _ the United
States, Soviet Union, Britain, France and China _ collectively are
assessed 57 percent of the cost of peacekeeping operations.
   They have agreed that Namibia's operations should not top $450
million. They also have been studying a U.S. proposal to cut the
military component of the force.
   Undersecretary-General Martti Ahtisaari, the secretary-general's
special representative for Namibia, said Thursday that ``time is
running out'' for the council to reach agreement.
   Even if an agreement were reached by the end of the week, it
would take at least until the end of February before U.N. committees
could develop and approve budgets for the Namibia force, he said.
   Until the budgets are in, his office cannot complete plans for
ordering equipment, supplies and transportation for the force,
Ahtisaari said.
   The U.N.'s one-year plan for Namibia's transition to independence
is to begin April 1. Elections are to be held Nov. 1 for a
constituent assembly, which is to draft a constitution and form a
parliament.
   The non-aligned members of the Security Council are Ethiopia,
Colombia, Malaysia, Algeria, Nepal, Senegal and Yugoslavia. The
other non-permanent members of the council are Canada, Finland and
Brazil.
   Namibia's independence was part of a peace agreement that also
calls for the withdrawal of Cuban forces from Angola. Cuba sent
forces into Angola in July 1975 to support forces fighting
guerrillas backed by the United States and South Africa. Cuba has
begun withdrawing troops.

   Pan American World Airways on Thursday disputed a
U.S. media report that the airline's security was lax at Frankfurt
Airport even after the bombing of Flight 103.
   ``All I can say is that we have a security staff that uses the
most modern methods,'' said airline spokesman Harald Kosel from his
office in West Berlin.
   ``Passengers are also matched up with their luggage, and are
given a list of questions to answer, including where they came from,
whether they packed their luggage themselves, and so forth, and
their passports are checked against their tickets,'' Kosel said.
   Asked if luggage brought on board by crew members also was
checked, Kosel said: ``Yes, of course, everyone is checked.''
   Kosel said the security staff was part of a Pan Am subsidiary
called ``Alert.''
   ABC World News Tonight on Wednesday alleged that baggage handlers
and others at London's Heathrow Airport were not given a thorough
background check, and that at least one Pan Am security guard in
Frankfurt said he had received only minimal training before going to
work for the company.
   The ABC report came three weeks and a day after a bomb destroyed
Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland on Dec. 21. All 259
people aboard the plane and at least 11 on the ground were killed.
   Investigators are trying to learn who placed the explosives
aboard the airplane, and where. The New York-bound flight began at
Frankfurt and changed planes in London.
   Kosel said, ``It appears now 99.9 percent sure that this didn't
happen in Frankfurt.''
   British investigators have said the explosives ruptured the
fuselage of the Boeing 747 in the area of the cargo hold just
forward of the plane's left wing.
   They have also said they suspect the bomb used was an explosive
produced in Czechoslovakia called Semtex. Czech officials have
agreed to send experts to Britain to assist in the investigation.

   Israel and the Soviet Union traded shots on the
basketball court Thursday night in a game followed so intently in
Israel that radio appeals were made to taxi and bus drivers not to
mix driving and listening.
   The dribble diplomacy was the latest sign of improving relations
between America's closest Middle East ally and the Soviet Union, the
main political and military backer of Israel's Arab enemies.
   ``The fact that our team is there and playing is quite an
encouraging step,'' said Foreign Ministry Deputy Spokesman Daniel
Scheck.
   The viewing audience was huge for the first live broadcast from
Moscow in which underdog Tel Aviv Maccabi beat the Red Army's CSKA
team 97-92. In a nation of only 4.2 million, more than 2 million
people were watching at the last basket, according to TV managing
director Chaim Yavin.
   Even Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, not a noted sports
enthusiast, took time out to watch the game on a small portable set
in his office.
   After the victory fans took to the streets shouting ``We won, we
won!,''and bus and taxi drivers beeped their horns.
   ``It's a great victory for Maccabi Tel Aviv in the heart of
Moscow, in the eyes of the world,'' Education Minister Yitzhak Navon
told the national Itim news agency.
   Over 1,000 Maccabi fans applied to go to the Soviet Union, but
only about a dozen were granted visas.
   The late afternoon starting time cut rush-hour traffic to a
trickle in major cities as workers raced home early to see the game.
Jerusalem's central Mahane Yehuda market closed three hours ahead of
schedule.
   Some Israelis gathered in pizzerias and cafes to watch, cheering
wildly at each basket. Nut stands and candy stores reported a
booming business as sports fans bought up nibbles for the big game.
   Shaul Yefan, director of the electric company, appealed to
viewers not to use water heaters and ovens during the game. He said
power blackouts might occur because so many TV sets were on at the
same time.
   In basketball-crazy Israel, the sports interest for Israel's
first Moscow game since 1973 was a major factor. But there was also
an unmistakable sense of drama over the changing political climate.
   Israel TV opened its broadcast with a shot of the onion-domed
Kremlin and a voice-over commentary by correspondent Yoram Arbel who
said ``history is being made.''
   Israel and the Soviet Union have been without diplomatic
relations since the 1967 Middle East war, when the Kremlin broke
ties in protest of Israel seizure of Arab territory.
   The climate has warmed markedly since the Soviets sent a
diplomatic delegation to take up residence in July 1987.
   Part of the reason for the improved Soviet image is attributed to
steadily building contacts at the non-official level, including the
visit of Soviet musicians, a leading poet and ordinary Soviet
tourists. Cultural visits are particularly popular, not leastly
because Israel has 250,000 immigrants from the Soviet Union.
   Foreign Minister Moshe Arens said the rapprochement is motivated
by the Soviet desire to play a role in any Middle East peace
settlement and the necessity to convince Israel such a role can be
constructive.
   Israel had conditioned Soviet participation on enlarged Jewish
emigration and freedom of Jewish cultural life in the Soviet Union
as well as restoration of full diplomatic ties.
   ``Whatever hesitations we may have had in the past, they were
concerned with the fact that many Jews who pursued Zionist activity
have been imprisoned'' and emigration was restricted, Arens said
Tuesday upon return from Paris, where he met with Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze.
   ``Most of that has disappeared,'' Arens acknowledged.
   The two nations appeared to be moving steadily _ if slowly _
toward renewal of diplomatic relations.
   Shevardnadze announced Sunday the Soviet decision to upgrade the
status of an Israeli delegation in Moscow and include political
matters in its range of activities.
   Israeli Foreign Ministry officials say this means Israel's envoys
and their Soviet counterparts in Tel Aviv will turn into de facto
permanent diplomatic missions.

   The United Nations ended 1988 more than
$750 million in the red mainly because the United States withheld
its dues during the Reagan administration, according to figures
obtained Thursday.
   The United States, the largest U.N. contributor, owed $401.7
million, according to an advance copy of the 1988 annual financial
figures obtained by The Associated Press. That figure equals 53.5
percent of the total arrears of the regular and peacekeeping
budgets, according to the advance copy.
   The regular budget ended the year $394.9 million in the red, more
than $40 million over the arrears at the end of 1987. Peacekeeping
budgets ended 1988 $355.2 million in arrears.
   The United States had said it was withholding funds to protest
anti-U.S. bias in the world body and inefficient administration.
President Reagan said in September he was satisfied with the
progress of reforms at the United Nations and ordered the State
Department to devise a schedule for repaying all U.S. arrears.
   Officials at the New York-based world body said the funding
crunch had jeopardized the U.N. payroll and could undermine U.N.
efforts to field international peacekeeping troops, which won the
1988 Nobel Peace Prize.
   ``We've spotted land, but are not yet ashore,'' said U.N.
Comptroller Luis M. Gomez. ``Clearly, to successfully take on the
many tasks now being given us by the world community, member states
are going to have to start paying in full and on time, and these
arrears must be reduced.''
   Washington was responsible for $307.6 million, or about 77
percent of the arrears in the regular budget. The Soviet Union owed
$9 million, or 2 percent of the regular arrears.
   Moscow was responsible for $172.1 million, nearly half the
arrears in peacekeeping. The United States was responsible for $94.1
million, or 26 percent.
   Eighty-six of the 159 member nations paid all their dues through
the end of 1988, a better showing than in the past. At the end of
1987, only 75 nations were paid up.
   Brazil, a nation with its own serious financial troubles,
pleasantly surprised the world body in December by paying all its
dues, $17.9 million, said Martti Ahtasaari, the U.N.
undersecretary-general in charge of administration.
   The total regular U.N. budget is about $880 million, of which the
United States is assessed one-fourth and the Soviet Union 11.8
percent.
   In addition to the United States and the Soviet Union, 10 other
nations owe more than $1 million to the regular budget: South
Africa, $33.9 million; Iran, $7.9 million; Argentina, $5.2 million;
Poland, $4.3 million; Romania, $4 million; Yugoslavia, $3.5 million;
Israel, $3.1 million; Libya, $2.8 million; Peru, $1.4 million; and
Hungary, $1.2 million.

   Independent counsel Lawrence Walsh said
Thursday he believes former presidential aide Oliver L. North can be
tried on cover-up charges without raising the national security
concerns which undermined conspiracy and theft counts.
   ``The government's case no longer depends on proving that the
proceeds of the Iranian arms sales constituted government property,
or that by diverting those proceeds to the Contras, North embezzled
them,'' Walsh said in a court filing.
   Walsh outlined the prosecution's legal theory of the case against
North in the event the conspiracy and theft charges against the
fired National Security Council aide are dropped, as expected.
   North's possible defenses to the charges, which focus largely on
the coverup of various aspects of the Iran-Contra affair, ``are
narrowly circumscribed,'' Walsh said in the court filing.
   ``The classified information problems affecting'' the conspiracy
and theft counts ``should no longer be at issue,'' Walsh said.
   Walsh's view differs sharply with that of North's attorney,
Brendan Sullivan. Last Thursday, Sullivan said that ``classified
information pervades the remaining charges as well.''
   The independent counsel said the government will prove that North
aided the Contras and then misrepresented his activities'' to
Congress in 1985, obstructed a congressional inquiry into his
activities a year later and then lied to the attorney general about
details of the diversion of money to the Contras.
   Walsh also said the government need not establish North's motives
for committing acts such as destroying and altering documents and
misrepresenting his activities to Congress.
   Walsh said North may attempt to bring classified information into
the case by saying that he had covered up because superiors directed
him to or because everything he did was ``authorized and perfectly
legal.'' In neither approach should North be permitted to bring up
classified information, said Walsh.
   On Monday, however, U.S. District Judge Gerhard Gesell said that
while motive does not determine guilt or innocence under the law,
North does have the right to show that the activities he sought to
cover up were not illegal. North might then seek to bring in some of
the same classified information that led to Walsh abandoning the
conspiracy and theft charges.
   ``No doubt North's motives were mixed,'' said Walsh. ``To cover
up activities in support of the Contras which the Congress might
protest, to cover up prior lies, to avoid political embarrassment to
the administration, or to avoid charges of illegality.''
   However, Walsh added, ``the jury will not be asked to decide this
case on the basis of North's motives, or the legality of the conduct
he was covering up.''
   The independent counsel last week gave up his pursuit of the
conspiracy and theft of government property charges against North
because the Reagan administration refused to declassify portions of
documents U.S. District Judge Gerhard Gesell said were needed to
conduct a fair trial.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh and Walsh filed declarations and
a memorandum under seal with Gesell that outlined the national
security problem. Gesell may dismiss the two counts on Friday.
   Nine of the 12 counts that would remain focus on North's
allegedly concealing from Congress and former Attorney General Edwin
Meese III his efforts on behalf of the Contras.
   In addition, North is accused of illegally accepting a $13,800
security system at his home from co-defendant Richard Secord,
converting to his own use at least $4,300 in traveler's checks from
Contra leader Adolfo Calero and conspiring to defraud the Treasury
of tax revenue in connection with charitable contributions
supporting the Contras.

   Nikos Psacharopoulos, longtime
director of the Williamstown Theatre Festival, one of the nation's
leading summer theaters, died Thursday in the Virgin Islands. He was
60.
   During his 34-year tenure, the Williamstown festival grew from a
sleepy summer theater to a national showcase that featured such
stars as Christopher Reeve, Blythe Danner, Frank Langella,
Christopher Walken and Karen Allen.
   Psacharapoulos, who died of colon cancer while vacationing, was
engaged to be married to actress Jean Hackett of New York City. They
had planned an April wedding.
   Born in Athens, Psacharopoulos came to the United States at age
17 to enter Oberlin College, where he studied art history. After
earning a master's degree at the Yale School of Drama, he taught
drama at Amherst College for a year and then became associate
artistic director of the Williamstown festival in 1955.
   He was named artistic-executive director the following year.
   Over the years he directed 97 shows in Williamstown and several
on Broadway and for the New York City Opera. His credits included
one of Broadway's first musicals with an all-black cast,
``Tambourines to Glory.''
   In 1988, he directed three productions: ``A Street Car Named
Desire'' on Broadway, ``Sweet Bird of Youth'' at the Royal Alexandra
Theatre in Toronto, Canada, and ``The Legend of Oedipus'' in
Williamstown.

   Central banks fought off speculators and managed
to knock the dollar slightly lower in wild foreign-exchange trading
on Wednesday.
   Traders said there was concerted dollar-selling by the Federal
Reserve and the central banks of West Germany, Switzerland, Britain,
Belgium, Austria, Canada, Italy, the Netherlands and perhaps others.
   ``It was very hectic. The market just sort of twisted and
turned,'' said Jeff Mondschein, vice president and manager of
foreign-exchange trading at Continental Bank in Chicago.
   High U.S. interest rates have made the dollar attractive to
global investors, while the West German mark has been under heavy
selling pressure because of low German interest rates.
   Central banks have been fighting the trend because of fears that
currencies are becoming misaligned and could cause economic damage.
Among other things, a strong dollar would hurt progress in reducing
the huge U.S. trade deficit.
   The dollar reached a three-month high of 1.84 marks in European
trading before succumbing to central-bank intervention and finished
the day in New York between 1.82 marks and 1.83 marks.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 1.25 Japanese yen to a closing 126.95 yen. Later, in
London, it was quoted at 126.15 yen. In New York, the dollar fell to
125.78 yen from 126.33 Tuesday.
   The dollar fell against the British pound as well. Sterling
fetched $1.7815, compared with $1.7643 Tuesday. In New York,
sterling rose to $1.7866 from $1.7649.
   Gold prices fell slightly. In Hong Kong, where the day's trading
begins, gold fell $2.70 a troy ounce to close at a bid price of
$404.48 an ounce.
   Gold fell in London to a late bid price of $403.50 a troy ounce,
compared with $404.75 bid late Tuesday. In Zurich, Switzerland, gold
closed at $403.30 an ounce, up from $405.10.

   Hundreds of Soviet Jews, given a rare chance by
improved relations to wave the Israeli flag and proclaim their
heritage, rocked a basketball stadium with cheers Thursday as
Maccabi of Tel Aviv edged the Soviet Army 97-92.
   ``This is joy, this is happiness,'' exulted Merab
Detrokalashuvili, a 38-year-old Jew from the Soviet Georgian
republic, hugging and kissing others in a crush of Jews at the army
sports complex on Moscow's west side.
   ``The Jewish nation is one nation,'' he said, clutching a
blue-and-white Israeli flag that he brought to the game.
   Ken Barlow, one of four American-born black players on the
Israeli basketball team, put the game away for Maccabi with a short
jumper from the left side in the final seconds.
   In Israel, a nation of 4.2 million people, more than 2 million
were watching at the last basket, according to TV managing director
Chaim Yavin in Jerusalem. Fans rushed outside shouting ``We won, we
won!,''and bus and taxi drivers beeped their horns.
   Maccabi captain Doron Jamshi and coach Zvi Sherf stressed that no
incidents occurred on the court and none was evident in the stands
or outside.
   Jamshi said the teams know and respect each other because they
have played each other often in neutral settings.
   ``Relations are very good,'' he said. ``It's like a little war.
We won the war and go home happy.''
   The team's appearance in Moscow for a European Championship Cup
game was the first by an Israeli basketball team in 15 years.
   The Israelis said they tried to keep out politics, but it proved
impossible because of the recent history of poor Israeli-Soviet
relations. ``It was not a regular game for us,'' Sherf said in a
post-game interview. ``The players were very, very excited before
and during the game.''
   The Soviet champions will travel to Israel for a return game in
March.
   The Soviet Union broke diplomatic relations with Israel after the
Middle East War of 1967. In recent years, under President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev, it slowly has been seeking a thaw with Israel.
   The last Israeli basketball team to appear in the Soviet Union,
participants in the University Games, was jeered as it strode into
Lenin Stadium in August 1973.
   Only the Soviet flag was hung above the central scoreboard
Thursday.
   Maccabis owner Shimon Mizrahi said Soviet officials decided not
to display an Israeli flag but such a display was not mandatory
because the game was not between two national teams.
   Fans of the Israeli team chanted ``Maccabi, Maccabi!'' and waved
a dozen blue-and-white banners emblazoned with the Star of David.
   At one point, several broke into an old Israeli folk song,
``We've Brought Peace to You.''
   Cheers got louder, and Maccabi fans jumped from their seats as
Maccabi broke out to a 10-point lead as the game was reaching
midpoint and then made it 71-51 with about 12 minutes left.
   The Soviets came storming back, led by guard Vladimir Gorin and
forward Sergei Tarakanov.
   The roar grew deafening when Tarakanov brought the Soviets to
93-89, with a jump shot from the free throw circle and then scored
two free throws to make it 95-91 with about a minute left.
   Barlow wrapped it up for the Israelis with his jumper shot,
however.
   Soviet Jews said they had no trouble buying tickets.
Detrokalashuvili, who said he plans to join his parents, sister and
brother in Israeli in April, bought 20 tickets and distributed them
to friends who came up from Georgia for the game.
   Four U.S.-born blacks play for Maccabi. Willie Sims, a black
American Jew from New York City, is an Israeli citizen who has been
on the team for 12 years. He came to Israel as a college student to
play in the Maccabiah Games, an Olympic-type event for Jews across
the world.
   Lavonne Mercer, from Georgia, has been on the team about eight
years and became an Israeli citizen two years ago. Kevin Magee, born
in Gary, Ind., and a team member for five years, and Barlow, from
Indianapolis, are the professional team's two foreign players.
   With the exception of Sims, who was born Jewish, the Americans
were recruited for Maccabi out of college and are paid more than
Israeli players.

   NATO and Warsaw Pact nations on Thursday
broke off discussions on arms control talks because of a lingering
dispute between Greece and Turkey, Western diplomats said.
   Western diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said East
and West negotiators agreed to meet again on Friday.
   The 16 NATO nations, meanwhile, will continue to search for a way
to break the impasse between Greece and Turkey over the eastern
Mediterranean port of Mersin, the diplomats said.
   Greece wants the port included in the new talks on cutting
conventional forces across Europe because it alleges the port is a
base for shipping arms to northern Cyprus, which is controlled by
Turkey.
   Turkey insists the port be excluded, since it is close to Syria,
which is not included in the new arms talks or in the 35-nation
Helsinki process on security and human rights.
   The Soviet Union agreed to exclude the port and the nearby U.S.
air base of Incirlik from the East-West arms talks. Turkey fears
reopening the issue of Mersin also could change Moscow's mind over
the air base, which it long sought to include in the new talks.
   The dispute threatens to block new East-West agreements on arms
control talks and a landmark human rights accord.
   The arms talks are designed to reduce Warsaw Pact and NATO
troops, tanks and airborne forces from the Atlantic to the Ural
mountains deep inside the Soviet Union.
   They could begin as early as March, according to diplomats from
NATO and Warsaw Pact nations.
   But if the Greek-Turkish dispute is not solved by the end of this
week, the new East-West arms talks cannot be set before the Reagan
administration leaves office, diplomats say.
   The overall agreement at the 35-nation Helsinki review conference
on security and human rights in Europe also would be at risk.
   The mandate for the new arms control talks is supposed to be part
of the final document agreed on by the 35 nations at the conference,
which began work in November 1986.
   A draft of the final document was presented last week, a day
before the United States and Britain removed a major obstacle by
announcing they are willing to attend a 1991 human rights meeting in
Moscow.

   West German Finance Minister Gerhard
Stoltenberg on Thursday urged the incoming Bush administration to
make reducing the U.S. budget deficit a top priority, saying more
reductions are needed to take pressure off international financial
markets.
   Stoltenberg said the United States is still importing large sums
of foreign capital to finance its large twin trade and federal
budget deficits.
   This flow of foreign capital, estimated at around $10 billion a
month, means less money going into productive investments in
countries outside the United States, Stoltenberg said in a speech.
   ``Further reductions in the U.S. federal deficit would take a lot
of pressure off the international capital markets and help stabilize
interest rates around the world,'' Stoltenberg said.
   Stoltenberg was asked during a question period following the
speech how fast Congress and the Bush administration need to act on
the deficit problem in order to reassure jittery world financial
markets.
   He said he realized ``it takes some time'' to work out
governmental problems in the United States, ``but I hope it will be
a solution this year and not only in the last months as it was in
1987.''
   In 1987, Congress and the Reagan administration forged an
agreement in December to lower the federal deficit following
negotiations which had been prompted by the collapse of the stock
market in October.
   Stoltenberg met earlier in the day with Treasury Secretary
Nicholas Brady. He met with Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan
on Wednesday and is scheduled to meet Friday with Richard Darman,
nominated by Bush as his budget director.
   Treasury Department spokesman Art Siddon said Brady and
Stoltenberg exchanged ``views on a wide range of issues that will
confront the new administration.''
   Officials said no decisions were reached on a proposed meeting
between the United States and its top economic allies, West Germany,
Japan, Britain, France, Canada and Italy.
   Brady is expected to attend such a meeting to assure U.S. allies
the new administration plans to pursue Reagan administration
policies which have sought to stabilize the value of the U.S. dollar
relative to other currencies.
   In his speech, Stoltenberg said President-elect George Bush has
made plain that he will continue to try to reduce the federal
government deficit. He said Americans see that as the key to making
more of their savings available for investment, to keeping prices
stable and interest rates low and to reducing the need to get money
from abroad.
   ``The very low savings ratio in the U.S. and the effect of the
budget and trade deficit necessitate a very high level of capital
imports, which in the long run would cause serious problems,'' he
said.

<TEXT>
   An Angolan who monitors a truce
line on the Namibian border said Thursday there is an unpatrolled
gap in the area to be checked for violations of a cease-fire between
Angolan and South African forces.
   Five months after the shooting stopped, three of a scheduled 11
posts have not yet been established along a 600-mile stretch from
Ruacana east to Zambia, said Maj. Valeriano Martinho, second in
command of the Angolan contingent on the joint commission.
   Martinho said 11 posts were to have been set up by the end of
September, after the truce was declared Aug. 8. He spoke to
reporters at his camp near the Ruacana control point 570 miles south
of Luanda, capital of Angola.
   He said the unpatrolled sector runs from the town of Cuangar
about 315 miles east to the Zambian frontier and includes the
Caprivi strip.
   ``The presence of UNITA forces along the Angolan border is
obstructing the establishment of the three final posts,'' he said.
``We believe they (South Africans) are continuing to support UNITA
from that area.''
   Asked whether Angola had proof, he replied: ``No. We have
suspicions.''
   Guerrillas of UNITA, the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola, which the United States supports, have
fought Angola's Marxist government since independence from Portugal
in 1975. South African troops have operated in southern Angola,
helping UNITA and pursuing Namibian guerrillas of the South-West
Africa People's Organization.
   South Africa said Dec. 22 it had halted aid to UNITA. Neither
UNITA nor SWAPO is involved in the truce or in the U.S.-mediated
peace plan for southern Africa signed by South Africa, Angola and
Cuba.
   Angola has protested the failure to establish the three remaining
posts, Martinho said, at sessions of the joint monitoring commission
that includes six members each from Angola, Cuba and six South
Africa.
   The commission has met each weekday on the border about a mile
from the Angolan camp. South Africa's camp is just across the
frontier in South-West Africa, or Namibia.
   South Africa captured the territory from Germany in World War I
and has governed it since _ for the past 22 years in defiance of the
United Nations.
   Under the three-way agreement signed Dec. 22, Cuba's 50,000
soldiers are to leave Angola by mid-1991 and Namibia is to become
independent after U.N.-supervised election.
   Under the cease-fire agreement, no significant movement of troops
is permitted on either side of the border.
   Both Martinho and 1st Lt. Nelson Coelho wore the orange armbands
of the joint commission and carried sidearms. They talked with
reporters in the shade of thorn trees in the camp next to the
Ruacana dam on the Cunene River, which forms part of the border.
   Martinho said daily patrols by 22 Angolans and 22 South African
soldiers have not found significant violations of the cease-fire.
   He said the Cubans, who are expected to have withdrawn 3,000
troops from Angola by Sunday, do not take part in truce patrols.
   Few people live in the area. A helicopter flight from the
Cuban-built airstrip at Cahama south to Ruacana Falls revealed
isolated huts, patches of corn and small herds of goats and cattle.

   The country's first woman Cabinet member
resigned Thursday after a prosecutor's report said she was
``strongly suspected'' of leaking confidential information to her
husband about a drug inquiry.
   The announcement by Justice Minister Elisabeth Kopp brings to a
head this nation's biggest scandal in years, known as the ``Lebanon
Connection.''
   In her statement distributed by a staff member, Mrs. Kopp said
she was stepping down in the ``in the interest of a quick,
unconditional and comprehensive'' investigation.
   Mrs. Kopp acknowledged for the first time that ``seen today, the
telephone call (to my husband) was a mistake I regret.'' She said
keeping her post had become ``humanly and politically'' impossible.
   Last month, she announced she would resign at the end of February.
   Defense Minister Arnold Koller, who also serves as Mrs. Kopp's
deputy, assumed the justice minister's post as caretaker until
Parliament approves her successor. It is expected to do so within
several weeks.
   Mrs. Kopp said Wednesday she did not believe she was guilty of
wrongdoing.
   A prosecutor's preliminary inquiry into the leak, whose results
were published Wednesday, said Mrs. Kopp was ``strongly suspected of
violating an official secret in warning her husband to sever ties
with a company under investigation in a major drug money-laundering
scandal.
   The inquiry by special prosecutor Hans Hungerbuehler said Mrs.
Kopp and two aides passed on details of a ministry file on the
investigation of Lebanese-controlled Shakarchi Trading A.G., where
her husband, Hans W. Kopp, quit as board member after the warning.
   Newspaper reports say he left the same day his wife called. She
says she only passed on ``rumors'' she had discovered independently.
   A week after the call, prosecutors announced they were
investigating the $1 billion money-laundering operation. Shakarchi
was among the companies and banks named by authorities as possibly
involved, but no charges have been filed.
   In Thursday's statement, Mrs. Kopp said she had asked the
president of the Parliament to take steps needed to lift her
immunity from prosecution. She said she did so in the interest of a
complete inquiry.
   ``I expect that this grave accusation will be resolved through a
continuation'' of a public inquiry, she said.
   Mrs. Kopp's resignation follows nationwide debate of the affair,
which has generated domestic banner headlines for almost three
months.
   Under Swiss law, a government official found guilty of violating
an official secret can be fined or jailed for up to three years.
   Mrs. Kopp, 52, rated the most popular Cabinet member in a public
opinion poll in December. She also served as deputy interior
minister and Swiss vice president, an honorific post rotating
annually among the seven ministers.

   A truck driver who drove his burning rig for
nine miles on Interstate 5 hoping the wind would extinguish the fire
was cited for reckless driving after the fiery wreckage closed the
highway for three hours.
   James Richard Shaw, 39, of Sacramento, Calif., told state police
his brakes began smoking, then caught fire Wednesday night while his
car-hauler descended from the Siskiyou Pass in southern Oregon with
a load of used cars.
   Shaw said he stopped at a rest area about 10 miles from the
California border and tried to put the fire out with a fire
extinguisher. When that failed, he got back into the truck and
started driving again, police said.
   He finally stopped nine miles later, after the truck had become
fully engulfed. The truck and its load of used cars were destroyed.
   Police said pieces of burning debris were scattered over a wide
stretch of the freeway, the state's only major north-south highway,
and the northbound lanes were closed for about three hours about the
10:30 p.m. incident.
   There were no reports of injuries and an estimate of damage was
not available.

   The FBI is investigating whether District of
Columbia Del. Walter Fauntroy broke federal laws by employing the
son of a congressional colleague at a time that records show the son
had sworn he was living in Illinois, a Justice Department offical
said Thursday.
   Fauntroy, Thomas John Savage and Rep. Gus Savage, D-Ill., are
subjects of a preliminary investigation into Fauntroy's employment
of the younger Savage, who said he was living in Chicago _ and
running for the Illinois Legislature _ at the same time he was on
Fauntroy's payroll, the official said.
   Department policy prohibited him from commenting further, said
the official, who spoke only on condition he not be named.
   In a related development, Rep. Julian Dixon, D-Calif., who chairs
the House ethics committee, also has written Fauntroy, who is the
district's non-voting member of Congress, asking for an explanation
of Savage's employment, according to a congressional source.
   Thomas Savage earned $21,398 while on Fauntroy's payroll from
September 1987 through June 1988.
   The Justice Department official said the FBI also is looking into
any connection between Fauntroy's employment of the younger Savage
and Rep. Savage's employment of Lezli Baskerville, a former Fauntroy
aide. A month before Fauntroy hired Savage, Ms. Baskerville was
ousted from a job Savage gave her on the House Public Works and
Transportation Committee.
   After leaving the Public Works panel, Ms. Baskerville returned to
Fauntroy's payroll, where she was directed to do legislative work on
behalf of the National Black Leadership Roundtable, a private group
of black businessmen that Fauntroy chairs, according to a memo
provided by Fauntroy to his staff.
   Fauntroy, in a statement released Thursday, said, ``On the advice
of counsel for the United States House of Representatives, while I
have nothing to hide, I have nothing to say.''
   ``It should be noted that no one on my staff has been subpoenaed
by any law enforcement authorities, nor has anyone on my staff even
talked to any law enforcement authorities,'' he added.
   However, the FBI officials investigating the matter do not have
subpoena powers, according to sources familiar with the probe.
   In addition, congressional sources and others familiar with the
investigation said Johnny Barnes, Fauntroy's staff director, refused
to meet with FBI agents who attempted to question him. Barnes
refused to comment on the matter when telephoned by a reporter.
   The federal investigation began last month after The Associated
Press reported Savage was on Fauntroy's payroll although he had
submitted a sworn affidavit to Illinois elections officials stating
he had met state requirements by living continuously for two years
in the state legislative district he sought to represent. That
period covered the time he was on Fauntroy's payroll.
   Fauntroy and the younger Savage first said that he had worked on
a District of Columbia statehood bill, but Savage later conceded he
rarely worked in Fauntroy's office and did little more than stuff
envelopes while he was there.
   When contacted by telephone in Chicago Thursday, Thomas Savage
said he was unaware of the investigation. He refused further comment.
   Rep. Savage could not be reached for comment.
   Dixon's letter asked Fauntroy to explain how he had come to hire
Savage, what duties Savage performed, and whether Savage had
regularly reported to work, the congressional source reported.
   House rules require that a congressional employee must report
regularly to work.
   Dixon could not be reached for comment on his letter.
   The FBI conducts a ``preliminary investigation'' after an initial
determination that the known facts in a case warrant a more detailed
examination. Ordinarily, a report resulting from a preliminary
investigation is sent to the U.S. attorney's office for review. A
decision then is made whether to present the case to a grand jury.
   In the Fauntroy case, the preliminary investigation will
determine whether Attorney General Dick Thornburgh will seek the
appointment of a special prosecutor, the procedure required when
members of Congress are involved.

   West German Finance Minister Gerhard
Stoltenberg said Thursday that ``bad feeling'' between the United
States and West Germany over alleged Libyan construction of a
chemical weapons plant has been cleared up.
   Stoltenberg noted his government had initially rejected U.S.
allegations that a German company had played a major role in the
construction of the alleged Libyan chemical weapons plant south of
Tripoli.
   ``In recent days there has been some additional information after
the first (West German) investigation proved nothing,'' Stoltenberg
said in a question-and-answer session with reporters and officials.
   ``You can read in the papers that there is now some suspicion
that it is possible that some international trade company with a
subsidiary in Germany, and possibly also a German company with a
subsidiary,'' were involved, he said.
   Stoltenberg said some exports may have left West Germany
supposedly destined for another country, but had wound up in Libya.
   ``This is possible, but we cannot give a final judgment because
we have -- and this will be done very urgently in these days -- to
clear whether exports, if they happened this way, were against the
law,'' he said.
   Stoltenberg said it would have to be determined if the exports
included ``sensitive components which would be used for weapon
production'' or were pure civilian products not subject to embargo.
   He said it remained important for the United States to ``share
your deep concerns fully about the possible buildup of chemical
weapons especially in countries which pursue a very dangerous
international policy.''
   ``We are generally against it and we are very sensitive as you
when we look to third countries,'' Stoltenberg said.
   He noted that Secretary of State George Shultz and West German
Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher had arranged for a team of
German experts to come to Washington this week to review the
evidence which U.S. officials say proves the American case.
   ``I'm glad that by the political discussions some bad feeling
which came up for a few days could be cleared up and that we could
have this discussion now in a good atmosphere of mutual cooperation
(and) mutual responsibility,'' Stoltenber said.
   He said he hoped the cooperation would produce ``reasonable
results in our interests and the interests of the world community.''

<HEAD>Rebels Linked to Death Of Jersey Mayor's Wife</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A New Jersey mayor's wife who died in a Dec. 1
rail crash in Peru's Andes Mountains was most likely the victim of
sabotage by a leftist guerrillas, the U.S. Embassy said Thursday.
   Anna Cucci was killed and her husband, Jersey City Mayor Anthony
Cucci, was injured Dec. 1 when the rail car they rode crashed near
Cuzco, 355 miles southeast of Lima.
   She is the fourth American known to have been killed as a result
of the Maoist Shining Path's nearly 9-year-old insurgency.
   Peruvian authorities at the time said saboteurs wedged a 10-inch
steel rod into the tracks, which caused the single car to derail and
tumble down a 250-foot sloped ravine.
   They said either guerrillas or workers supporting a Communist-led
general strike caused the accident, which also killed Doris Chacon,
the wife of Cuzco Mayor Carlos Chacon, and severely injured the
mayor.
   The embassy said Thursday that Peruvian investigators since have
reached the opinion that the guerrillas were behind the attack.
   Local officials believe Chacon was the rebels' most likely
target, the embassy said.
   The crash occurred on Cuzco's outskirts as the two couples, along
with Jersey City councilman Jaime Vazquez and five other people,
were en route on a daylong outing to the ancient Inca citadel of
Machu Picchu, 60 miles northwest of Cuzco.
   Cucci, who was in Cuzco to participate in a sister city ceremony,
returned home with his wife's body a few days after the accident. He
signed the Cuzco-Jersey City accord and vowed to help Peru any way
he could.
   More than 12,000 people have died in the Shining Path's fight to
topple Peru's elected government and install Marxist rule.
   Analysts said foreigners generally have not been targeted for
attacks by the rebels, but the foreign death toll has risen recently.
   Eight foreign tourists including two Americans were killed in
1986 when rebels bombed a train carrying passengers to Machu Picchu,
and one American and two French agricultural advisors were killed
last year by highland guerrillas.

   Tracy Chapman seems of another time, a time when
Dylan, Odetta, Seeger and Guthrie celebrated freedom and the spirit
of man, and defied brutality and repression with their songs and
anthems.
   Chapman, whose self-titled debut album has been nominated for six
Grammys, is of this age and her songs take a hard, cold look at
poverty, racism, inequality and human relations. She is
uncompromising, tough and compassionate.
   ``I think people look at the world in many different ways and
choose to see what they like,'' she said in an interview last year
with The Washington Post. ``I think lots of people ignore some of
the harder issues, the more unpleasant things. I don't think I harp
on them.''
   Her LP opens with ``Talkin' Bout a Revolution,'' a song that
tells of ``standing in the welfare lines
   Crying at the doorsteps of those armies of salvation
   Wasting time in the unemployment lines
   Sitting around waiting for a promotion
   Poor people gonna rise up
   And get their share
   Poor people gonna rise up
   And take what's theirs.''
   Until ``Tracy Chapman'' hit record stores last April, the
24-year-old poet-singer-songwriter-folksinger was one of the Boston
area's best kept secrets. As an anthrolopolgy major at Tufts
University in Medford, Mass., she performed in coffee houses and
clubs, and was a local hit.
   The LP, with its range from folk to pop ballad to reggae,
enchanted millions more. It has sold over 4 million copies and has
been nominated for album of the year and best contemporary folk
recording. The single, ``Fast Car,'' has been nominated for best
song and record of the year, and Chapman herself is up for best new
artist and best female pop vocalist.
   ``Fast Car'' was a No. 1 hit and tells of a high school dropout
who works to supports her alcoholic father and who wants to escape
it all with her unemployed boyfriend:
   ``You got a fast car
   And I got a plan to get us out of here
   I been working at the convenience store
   Managed to save just a little bit of money
   We won't have to drive too far
   Just 'cross the border and into the city
   You and I can both get jobs
   And finally see what it means to be living.''
   Chapman's rich contralto with its melancholic underpinnings is an
instrument by itself and highly effective on ``Behind the Wall,'' a
song about a battered woman. She sings a capella of the harsh
realties of the domestic fight: ``Last night I heard the screaming -
Then a silence that chilled my soul'' _ and slams the police for
doing nothing.
   She grew up in Cleveland and has been singing since she was a
child. She was in a Connecticut boarding school when
singer-songwriters had been put out to pasture by synthesizer
philistines. Chapman didn't turn on her radio, but many of her
classmates listened to folk music and played guitar.
   In college, one of her classmates was Brian Koppelman, whose
father, Charles, is a leader in the music publishing business. This
gave her the wedge she needed to gain entry to the recording world.
   Chapman, whose musical roots can be traced to Joan Armatrading,
Carol King and Joni Mitchell, was part of a new wave of
singer-songwriters in the late 1980s, especially women such as Toni
Childs, Marti Jones, Melissa Etheridge and Michelle Shocked.

<TEXT>
   Bobby McFerrin, whose feel-good anthem ``Don't
Worry, Be Happy'' brought him three of his five Grammy award
nominations Thursday, is a one-man band without the hardware.
   The a cappella tune offering the advice of putting aside nagging
worries of daily life _ such as paying the rent _ is a multi-track
recording of simple lyrics accompanied by layers of sounds all made
by McFerrin.
   The vocal gymnast's nominations included best song, record and
male pop vocal performance for ``Don't Worry,'' best album for
``Simple Pleasures,'' and best male jazz vocal performance for the
song ``Brothers.''
   ``Don't Worry'' was the first a cappella song to reach No. 1 on
the Billboard charts. And it brought the widest recognition to a
voice heard on jeans commercials, in ``The Bill Cosby Show'' theme
and singing the alphabet on ``Sesame Street.''
   McFerrin, 38, left the orchestra out when he recorded ``Simple
Pleasures,'' using only his voice and other sounds such as
percussion made with his body.
   His live shows are much the same: no band, but a resourceful
entertainer who can turn the audience into part of the show.
   ``What you're hearing is me thinking aloud,'' McFerrin said in a
biography released by his label, EMI-Manhattan. His intent is to get
``a mature audience to be childlike and spontaneous.''
   Nominated six times previously, McFerrin has already taken home
five Grammys, three for best male jazz vocalist. But he finds the
title confining.
   ``To be labeled as a jazz singer is limiting,'' McFerrin said in
his biography. ``I like to think of myself as one who has simply
been infused with a lot of music.''
   McFerrin, born in New York, is the son of classical singers and
began studying music at the age of 6. The family moved to Los
Angeles in 1958.
   McFerrin formed a quartet in high school, studied music at
Sacramento State University and Cerritos College, worked as a
keyboard player with the Ice Follies, in a series of lounge bands
and as a hotel singer and pianist.
   Jazz vocalist Jon Hendricks invited him to join his group in
1979, and McFerrin made his debut album in 1982, following up by
taking part in all-star jazz tours of Europe and the United States.
   He tried his first solo concert in Ashland, Ore., in 1983, toured
solo and recorded his second album, ``The Voice,'' a live a cappella
recording. Numerous TV appearances and collaborations followed. In
1986 he recorded the solo album ``Spontaneous Inventions.''
   McFerrin lives in San Francisco with his wife, Debbie.

   Warm, moist air riding atop freezing air near the surface brought
freezing rain, snow, sleet and rain from eastern Pennsylvania to New
England on Thursday, slickening highways and causing numerous
accidents.
   Very strong south winds accompanied the storm system, with 50-to
70-mph wind gusts reported near Grande Isle and St. Albans, Vt.,
blowing down a large radio tower and causing several power outages.
   Showers and thunderstorms developed from southern Ohio across the
Tennessee Valley to central Texas. Freezing rain was mixed with rain
and sleet over north central Texas and south central Oklahoma.
   Rainfall, heavy over the lower Mississippi and Tennessee valleys
in recent days left streams in Tennessee, Kentucky and northern
Alabama flowing near bankful, and flooded some streets in Memphis,
Tenn., during rush hour.
   Snow fell on parts of New Mexico, with a winter storm watch in
effect through Friday for the southern third of the state.
   High winds blew on the east slopes of the Rocky Mountains in
Montana, with winds gusting to near 50 mph at Livingston.
   The strong Santa Ana winds that earlier produced wind gusts as
high as 100 mph in Southern California, destroying a blimp, shutting
down an airport, and cutting power to thousands of utility customers
were subsiding, officials said.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 a.m. EST ranged from 2
degrees at Jackson, Wyo., and Gunnison, Colo., to 89 degrees at
McAllen, Texas. The low in the nation was 22 degrees below zero at
Gunnison.
   The national weather forecast for Friday called for showers and
some thunderstorms from central and southern Texas across the lower
Mississippi Valley, Gulf Coast, Tennessee Valley and southern
Appalachians to the southern and middle Atlantic Coast. Snow will
fall on parts of southwest Texas, New Mexico and the central
Appalachians. Rain will fall on the Northern Pacific Coast, with
snow inland. Winds will be strong over the Rocky Mountain region.
   High temperatures will be in the teens and 20s for northern Utah,
southwest Wyoming and southeast Idaho; in the 20s from the upper
Mississippi Valley across the northern Great Lakes and much of New
York to northern New England; in the 30s across the Missouri Valley
and the Ohio Valley to southern New England; and in the 30s for
western Texas and Oklahoma, and southern and central Rockies.
   Coastal Southern California as well as the eastern half of the
Gulf Coast region across northwest Florida to the southern Atlantic
Coast will have highs in the 60s. Readings will warm to the 70s and
80s over the Florida Peninsula. The remainder of the nation will
generally have high temperatures in the 40s and 50s.

   Chancellor Helmut Kohl on Thursday said
authorities seized new documents that may show West German companies
helped Libya build what Washington says is a chemical weapons plant.
   Kohl gave no details about the documents while answering
questions from reporters in a studio appearance late Thursday night
on West Germany's ZDF television network.
   The government previously maintained it had no evidence of a West
German link to the plant at Rabta, south of Tripoli, the Libyan
capital. The stunning reversal embarrassed West German authorities.
   NBC News reported Thursday that Libyan officials contacted West
German companies for clean-up help after a dangerous chemical spill
in August at the facility.
   West Germany's Imhausen-Chemie was one of those the Libyans
called for help, the network reported.
   A group of West Germans was in the United States this week to
examine evidence that Washington says indicates the Libyan plant is
a chemical weapons factory. Libya says the facility is a
pharmaceutical plant.
   ``There are new indications that will be further checked,'' Kohl
said when asked if the government had new evidence of West German
involvement in building the plant.
   ``More documents have been seized and they could give evidence, I
don't know.''
   Kohl said the documents involved chemical equipment that could be
used in many ways, but he did not elaborate. He did not say where
the papers were seized.
   He said the federal intelligence service also was involved in
investigations. Kohl said authorities were looking for evidence that
could stand in court before bringing any charges.
   A ranking official said on condition of anonymity: ``There is no
question that these allegations have caused serious damage to West
Germany's international prestige. The government is in an extremely
embarrassing and difficult position.''
   In Washington, West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg
noted his government initially rejected U.S. allegations that a
German company played a major role in the construction of the plant.
   He said there was no more ill will between the Washington and
Bonn.
   ``I'm glad that by the political discussions some bad feeling
which came up for a few days could be cleared up and that we could
have this discussion now in a good atmosphere of mutual cooperation
(and) mutual responsibility,'' Stoltenber said.
   President Reagan has raised the possiblity of military action
against the plant.
   Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher, who told reporters a
week earlier there was no proof of West German complicity, said
Thursday: ``There are a number of indications that evidently point
in this direction.''
   Ali Treiki, Libya's U.N. ambassador, said on CBS News Thursday
that West Germans ``did help us, not only in this plant, in other
plants also.''
   In Belgium, the Justice Ministry said Jozef Gedopt, head of Cross
Link NV of Antwerp, was arrested and charged with forging shipping
documents for goods delivered to Libya.
   A spokesman for the West German Finance Ministry said Gedopt was
arrested on the basis of information provided by West Germany. He
said the information was found by investigators examining seized
records of I.B.I. Engineering, a defunct Frankfurt company linked to
the Libya plant.
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz told Kohl in November the
United States had evidence of West German involvement in building
and outfitting the plant.
   U.S. officials revealed the name of one suspect company,
Imhausen-Chemie of Lahr, nearly two weeks ago, prompting the Finance
Ministry to order an investigation.
   Last week, the government said an audit of the firm's records
produced no evidence of illegal exports.
   On Wednesday, government sources confirmed that a criminal
investigation of I.B.I. Engineering's activities was under way and
said authorities had seized company documents.
   A secretary who answered the telephone at Imhausen-Chemie on
Thursday said company officials were not available for comment.
Company manager Juergen Hippenstiel-Imhausen has denied any
connection to the Libyan plant.
   Horst Koerbler, former business manager of I.B.I., declined
comment on the case. The ARD television network quoted Koerbler
earlier as saying ``many German firms'' were involved in the Libyan
project.
   Koerbler told The Associated Press he had been misquoted, but
would not elaborate.

<DATELINE>BLYTHE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A film critic who gets $8 a review and
won't do R-rated movies has been banned from the only theater around
because her negative reviews hurt business, theater officials said.
   Cathy Monnett, a free-lancer who writes for the twice-weekly Palo
Verde Valley Times, was given a refund and asked to leave as she
watched a recent screening of ``Gorillas in the Mist'' at the
600-seat Blythe Cinema.
   ``People were staying away from the theater because of her
reviews,'' said Don Davis, the theater owner's brother and an
attorney for the Blythe Cinema, in Thursday's Los Angeles Times.
   Paul Davis, 37, co-owner of the theater, called it a matter of
economic survival, even though his movies aren't advertised in the
paper.
   But Ms. Monnett, who said most of her reviews are positive, vowed
to continue writing reviews _ even if she has to travel 90 miles to
Yuma, Ariz., to see the pictures.
   ``I'm incensed,'' Ms. Monnett said. ``By driving to Yuma I'm
telling them they can't stop me from writing reviews.''
   Ms. Monnett, 29, gets $8 for each review she submits, she said.
   The standoff has spawned angry editorials in the paper, with a
circulation of 4,500, protests outside the theater and talk of a
legal challenge.
   Ms. Monnett, who wrote similar reviews for some small newspapers
in Utah, claims the ban was unfounded based on her track record in
Blythe, a desert town of 8,400 people about 220 miles east of Los
Angeles.
   ``Of the 28 reviews I have written, 17 have been positive,'' she
said.
   ``That's a pretty good percentage,'' said David Anson, a movie
critic for Newsweek magazine. ``I don't think any of us would
survive in Blythe.''
   Some of Ms. Monet's reviews have been harsh. The movie ``Hot to
Trot, she wrote, ``Has only one thing to recommend it. It will
restore your faith in TV. Nothing on the tube is this stupid,
unimaginative, tedious and irritating.''
   Yet on the fantasy-adventure ``Willow,'' she wrote: ``It offers
sympathetic characters, a powerful conflict between good and evil,
fantastic action sequences ... and that most elusive of movie
attributes: a happy ending.''
   Of ``Police Academy V,'' she wrote: ``The comedy is sophomoric
but rarely offensive, and you'll even get a few big laughs for your
money.''
   ``Moonstruck,'' which won Cher an Oscar for Best Actress Oscar,
was ``basically a very old-fashioned movie with old-fashioned ideas
about love; but if it doesn't make a believer out of you, maybe you
should have your cynicism level checked.''
   Paul Davis considers Ms. Monnett a dilettante lacking the
credentials to review films.
   In a letter to the editor, published by the newspaper, he wrote:
``Were her distorted, negative and unfair criticism harmless, we
could perhaps ignore her, and chuck it off to a small-town mind that
dabbles in writing newspaper articles.''
   The newspaper has published several editorials denouncing the
theater's action, and urged supporters to picket the movie house.
About a dozen people recently showed up with picket signs. One read:
``Big Screen, Small Mind.''
   Meanwhile, Palo Verde Valley Times Publisher Glen Sparlin said
that since Ms. Monnett will not review R-rated movies, he is
considering using another critic to complement his family film
reviewer.

<HEAD>Police Confirm Ritual Suicide Over Hirohito's Death</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police confirmed on Friday that a 38-year-old man
committed ritual suicide by disembowelment, or hara-kiri, this week
after saying he wanted to follow Emperor Hirohito in death.
   A police official said previous police statements were not true
in denying that the suicide was linked to Hirohito's death.
   ``We must have received different information since then,'' he
said.
   Tadao Tanaka, 38, a chef in Fukuoka on Kyushu Island, committed
suicide in the cemetery at Junsei Temple and left a letter for his
wife saying, ``Since his majesty has departed, I cannot live any
longer,'' said an official of the Fukuoka Police Department.
   The incident was reported in the Tokyo Shimbun.
   It was the third known suicide linked to Hirohito's death at the
age of 87 last Saturday of intestinal cancer. On Saturday and
Sunday, two old soldiers hanged themselves in provincial areas,
saying in suicide notes they wanted to follow the emperor in death.
   Following the ancient tradition of the samurai warrior class,
Tanaka placed a white cloth on the ground, knelt, and slit his
abdomen with a long kitchen knife, the official reported.
   He said Tanaka's body was found Tuesday by monks at the temple.
   Ritual suicides, also known here as seppuku, are traditionally
viewed as an act of honor and are rare.
   All the police officials spoke on condition of anonymity.

<HEAD>Insurgent Leader Enjoys Prison Perks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The leader of last month's
military revolt managed to keep his credit current even behind bars,
renewing an American Express card in prison so he could cover his
wife's vacation, a newspaper said Thursday.
   Col. Mohamed Ali Seineldin is enjoying more privileges than most
prison inmates _ and many Argentines in general, other sources said
on condition of anonymity.
   He has his own telephone and a private secretary to coordinate
his steady stream of visitors, and he even was allowed to spend
Christmas Eve at another prison so he could toast his fellow
insurgents, the sources said.
   Seineldin led a four-day rebellion by more than 800 soldiers that
included a siege at a military school outside Buenos Aires. The
insurgents surrendered on Dec. 5.
   On Tuesday, Seineldin telephoned the American Express office in
Buenos Aires and asked for a renewal on his credit card so he could
cover his wife's vacation to Chile, the newspaper Pagina 12 reported
Thursday.
   A company representative drove to the suburban Buenos Aires
military base where Seineldin is being held and waited while the
colonel completed the paperwork, the paper reported.
   Several hours later, approval was granted and Mrs. Seineldin
picked up the card, the paper said. Such speedy approvals are
reserved ``only for VIP clients,'' it said, noting that prisoners
usually have difficulty getting credit, let alone credit cards.
   Contacted by The Associated Press, American Express issued a
statement that said: ``We believe that the relationship between
American Express and those individuals who possess the American
Express card is confidential.
   ``This policy of privacy is applied in an equal manner with each
one of our 30 million members.''
   A spokeswoman for the army said: ``That (Seineldin) report came
from journalists. We have no comment on that.''
   Seineldin apparently hasn't been confined to a cell since his
surrender. Dozens of soldiers, officers, politicians and a few
reporters have passed by for visits.
   The visits are arranged in advance by a private secretary,
military sources say, and Seineldin has a private telephone.
   On Christmas Eve, Seineldin was flown by helicopter to the
Magdalena military prison, 62 miles south of Buenos Aires, to toast
the holiday with officers jailed there, the sources said.
   Critics of President Raul Alfonsin say the government made a deal
with rebels to end the insurrection rather than force their
unconditional surrender.
   Many loyal commanders said afterward they agreed with demands
made by rebels for an end to the prosecutions of officers for human
rights abuses during the military dictatorships of the 1970s; some
sort of public affirmation that the brutal crackdown in which at
least 8,900 Argentines were executed was legitimite; and a bigger
military budget.

   Santa Ana winds gusting to 100 mph destroyed a
blimp, shut down an airport, toppled trucks, fanned a brush fire and
cut power to thousands of customers in Southern California,
officials said Thursday.
   The Airships Inc. blimp, used by the Pepsi Cola Co. to promote a
soft drink, was moored at Ontario International Airport when the
desert winds struck Wednesday night, reducing it to tatters and
leaving little more than its nose cone attached to an anchor pole.
   Its gondola lay on its side about 30 yards away and the
surrounding tarmac was littered with debris.
   The 14,617-pound airship was the nation's largest, said Pepsi
spokesman Todd McKenzie. Its last appearance was at the Jan. 2 Rose
Bowl in Pasadena.
   ``It was torn to shreds,'' said Beatrice Martinez, public
relations secretary at the Ontario airport, about 40 miles east of
Los Angeles.
   The airport closed all runways because of blowing debris
Wednesday evening, but the terminal reopened Thursday with limited
operations. Airport manager Michael DiGirolamo said many airlines
chose not to take off or land in the high winds.
   Passengers at the terminal were ``resigned to the fact they
aren't going anywhere right away,'' he said. The 10-hour closing
halted 45 incoming flights.
   Power outages disrupted lives throughout the region.
   ``Weather like this is awful for restaurants,'' said Lou Ray,
owner of the Smokehouse cafe in Fontana.
   ``When there's power outages we lose the coffee maker _
everything,'' she said. ``Everyone is sitting here with each other
and the flashlights.''
   Officials of the Mountain Empire Unified School District in San
Diego County canceled classes Thursday, saying wind made travel
hazardous for school buses.
   The Santa Ana winds _ also called ``devil winds'' _ are spun off
by high pressure over the interior of the country, picking up speed
as they move from Southern California's deserts through mountain
passes and roar down on adjacent communities.
   At a large truck stop east of the airport, some 2,000 truck
drivers and campers waited for the winds to die down, said Lance
Davis, general manager of Truck Stops of America in Ontario. He said
at midmorning that at least 700 trucks were parked outside the truck
stop's three restaurants.
   By afternoon the winds ebbed and truckers and campers were on
their way, said Bob Berenyi, another truck stop manager.
   The National Weather Service said the winds were expected to fade
Friday.
   Elsewhere, a downed power line was blamed for a brush fire that
charred 200 acres in Orange County, said county Fire Department
Capt. Hugh Madlock.
   The fire in Trabuco Canyon, about 45 miles southeast of Los
Angeles, briefly threatened expensive homes before being surrounded
by midnight. Madlock said the high winds aggravated the 220
firefighters' efforts.
   Residents of about 50 homes were evacuated until flames were
doused. Several horses set loose during the height of the blaze had
to be corralled, Madlock said.
   In San Diego County, a 50-acre fire fanned by 60 mph winds burned
out of control Thursday afternoon near the city of Ramona, the
California Department of Forestry reported.
   Other power lines brought down by high winds caused outages that
affected about 6,000 homes and businesses served by Southern
California Edison in Los Angeles and Orange counties, said Edison
spokesman Kevin Kelly.
   The winds also overturned trucks on Interstates 10 and 15, which
remained open with traffic moving about 5 mph, said California
Highway Patrol Officer James O'Brien. Blowing dust reduced
visibility to almost zero, he said.
   In San Bernardino County, winds ripped off part of the roof of
the sheriff's station in Rancho Cucamonga and damaged several
private cars, said Deputy Denise Garland.

<TEXT>
   Maxwell's Plum, the prototype Sixties ``singles
bar'' and pre-Yuppy hot spot that catered to the young and upwardly
mobile, put its art deco, art nouveau, funhouse decor on the auction
block Thursday.
   The cafe closed July 10 after 22 years in business.
   Deal maker Donald Trump bought a leaded glass window for $26,800.
The stained glass window, featuring two peacocks against a blue
background, was designed from Tiffany Favrile glass by the
restaurant's owner, Warner LeRoy.
   Another buyer, an unidentified New York art dealer, paid the
highest price of the day: $38,500 for a 12-foot-long, leaded glass
window, depicting a cornucopia by artist John LaFarge.
   ``He (LaFarge) was the one who supposedly taught Tiffany how to
make the Favrile glass,'' said auctioneer William Doyle, who
operates an auction house in Manhattan.
   Trump plans to display the window in the Taj Mahal, a hotel he's
building in Atlantic City, according to Patti Fox, who bid on
Trump's behalf after he made a brief appearance at the auction.
   An 18-by-28 foot ceiling, also designed by LeRoy from Tiffany
glass, was withdrawn from the auction after it failed to make the
lowest acceptable bid, which LeRoy put at $1 million.
   Sources at the auction house and the Trump organization indicated
the millionaire still was interested in the ceiling and would
negotiate for it privately.
   Maxwell's Plum, once a hot spot among trendy New Yorkers in the
1960s, saw its fortunes fail in the highly competitive Manhattan
restaurant market of the 1980s.
   Legend has it that the expression ``singles bar'' was coined
there. An estimated 3,000 people stood in line on the night it
opened for business with a decor that was an odd concoction of art
nouveau, art deco and carnival motifs.
   Among the items sold Thursday was the funhouse mirror, which went
for $550, and a carousel horse that brought $3,575. Another big
attraction, a red Harley Davidson motorcycle that LeRoy bought from
Arnold Schwarzenegger to display at the restaurant, went for $16,500.
   ``They're all my favorites! I'm having so much fun, I may try
this with Tavern on the Green,'' said LeRoy, an avid collector who
also owns that famed New York restaurant.
   The auction brought in a total of $766,965. About $56,000 of that
came from Trump, who also bought a chandelier and a bronze elephant
head, according to Maryalice Adams, a spokeswoman for the auctioneer.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir on Thursday denied
published reports that he decided to fire the head of Israel's famed
Mossad secret service after a six-year tenure characterized as
mediocre and passive.
   ``The head of the Mossad has not been dismissed,'' Shamir said in
a rare public comment on the secret service. ``He is finishing his
assignment as planned. It has even been extended.
   ``All the articles that were printed concerning the head of the
Mossad are untrue and baseless. He has done extraordinary work. .. .
He enjoys the confidence of the government and my full trust and
confidence,'' Shamir said.
   Unprecedented public debate about the Mossad followed a Supreme
Court decision Tuesday overuling the military censor and allowing
the Tel Aviv weekly newspaper Ha'ir to run an article on the Mossad.
   The article is to run in Friday's editions. The Associated Press
obtained an advance copy.
   Ha'ir, quoting foreign newspaper reports, said the Mossad head
was responsible for events leading to the expulsion of five Israeli
agents from Britain last September. In another incident, Mossad
agents in West Germany left forged passports in a telephone booth,
the article said.
   Author Aluf Ben described the head of the Mossad as a mediocre
and manipulative bureaucrat who worked his way up by outlasting more
outstanding competitors.
   The Mossad head, named in foreign reports as Nahum Adnoni, was
appointed in September 1982 as a last-minute fill-in for Gen.
Yekutiel Adam, who was the first choice of then-Prime Minister
Menahem Begin but was killed in the Lebanon war, Ben wrote.
   The new chief had been deputy Mossad chief and ``had spent most
of his years far from any operations and had not guided any
agents,'' Ben wrote.
   His main goal as head of Mossad was to hang on to his job by
avoiding mistakes, the article said. ``He didn't initiate operations
and preferred to leave the ship in port.''
   He was so eager to avoid complications that he accepted
intrusions into his territory, such as the decision of then-Prime
Minister Shimon Peres in 1985-86 to enlist his personal aides rather
than the Mossad in selling arms to Iran, the article said.
   Ben said the search for a new chief began months ago. One of the
two main contenders is from outside the agency and the other rose
through the ranks, he wrote.
   Shamir was expected to make his choice within days. Israeli
newspapers said he favored the candidate within the agency, noting
that Shamir was with the Mossad in the 1950s and 1960s.
   Shamir on Thursday criticized the public debate over the Mossad
chief, saying: ``He and the agency he heads have been caused a great
deal of sorrow.''

   Police shot and killed two
blacks who were among a group that fired on a military patrol,
authorities said Thursday.
   Police also said a 23-year-old black man was stabbed to death in
Willow Fountain, also in Natal province, where more than 1,000
blacks have died in unrest during the past 18 months. No further
details were given.
   A police report said officers fired birdshot Wednesday at a group
of blacks, some of whom were firing at a police patrol, in Molweni
township near Durban. Two of the men were killed and one injured,
the report said. Eleven were arrested.
   In another development, police said three mines exploded
overnight in and around Ciskei, a tribal homeland for the Xhosas.
The South African government considers the area to be an independent
republic, but it is not recognized by other countries.
   An officer sustained a burst eardrum when bomb experts were
trying to detonate one mine in King William's Town in the eastern
Cape province, police said.
   Other explosions occurred in Wilsonia near East London and at a
railway station on the outskirts of the nearby Ciskei capital,
Mdantsane. Police gave no motives for the explosions and did not
comment on whether they were linked.
   A weekly black newspaper, The New Nation, said there had been at
least two cases of clashes between authorities and members of the
black communities in the area in the past week.
   The paper, which the South African government closed down for
three months this year, reported that Ciskei police and soldiers
last week assaulted residents of a village who are opposing their
incorporation into the homeland. Many blacks do not want to live in
the homelands because their rights to live and work in South Africa
are curtailed.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.

   A coal dump truck slammed into the side of a
school bus filled with students Thursday, injuring more than 40
children and both drivers, authorities said.
   At least seven people were hospitalized, two in critical
condition.
   ``It was just a tremendous amount of chaos,'' said Laurel County
Sherrif's Capt. Gene Hollon, who arrived at the scene minutes after
the accident.
   ``Several people had stopped on the highway to try to render aid.
... It was a terrible looking scene. ... There were children sitting
everywhere. Children were still pinned in the wreckage,'' he said.
   The bus driver, Enoch Ray Smith, 33, was charged with driving
with a suspended license, police said, but added that they could not
immediately determine who was at fault.
   The accident occurred at 3:10 p.m. at the entrance of North
Laurel Junior High, Hollon said. Most of the students on the bus
were believed to be have attended the school.
   The truck, headed north, slammed into the bus' midsection, Hollon
said, adding that it was not immediately clear what led up to the
accident.
   Rescue units used machines to cut through the crumpled metal to
free some victims.
   ``There was a tremendous amount of screaming and crying,'' said
Hollon. ``Some of the students were pinned in together. I saw one
instance where one of the students was trying to help the other,
even though they both were pinned in.''
   ``It happened all of a sudden,'' said Jackie McFadden, a
14-year-old who suffered a sprained right arm in the accident. ``It
sounded like a stick of dynamite.''
   Two 13-year-old boys were in critical condition at the University
of Kentucky Medical Center in Lexington, said hospital spokeswoman
Mary Margaret Colliver.
   The boys were identified as Robert Watts and John Detherage,
hometowns unknown. Watts had abdominal injuries and other injuries
and underwent surgery late Thursday. Detherage, with head injuries
and multiple lacerations, was in the pediatric intensive care unit.
   At least five others were admitted to Marymount Hospital, said
Lowell Jones, hospital administrator. Thirty-five students, the
drivers of the vehicles and an adult school aide were treated and
released, the hospital said. Injuries ranged from bruises to massive
internal trauma, he said.
   Authorities had not determined how many students were on the bus,
but Jones said all were in their teens.
   The coal truck driver, John B. Massey, 28, suffered cuts and
bruises on his face and Massey's 4-year-old son, who was in the
truck with him, was under observation, said patrolman Paul
Shackelford.
   Smith, the bus driver, completed state-required training more
than a year ago, said Gordon Nichols, spokesman for the state
Department of Education.
   The charge filed against him Thursday involved a speeding ticket
issued on Aug. 25, Shackelford said. Smith paid the fine but failed
to report to traffic school, resulting in the suspension, the
patrolman said.
   About 150 to 175 parents and others converged on Marymount
Hospital after the accident to learn the extent of the students'
injuries, Jones said.
   Students who suffered minor injuries, such as glass cuts, were
treated in the hospital's hallways while the emergency room and the
trauma unit were used to treat the more seriously injured, Hollon
said.

   A jury found K mart Inc., the nation's
second-largest retailer, liable for $2.4 million damages for selling
a shotgun to an intoxicated man who later shot and paralyzed another
man with it.
   The state Supreme Court jury in Niagara County made the award
Tuesday to the estate of Thomas Viscomi and his widow, Norma
Viscomi, of Niagara Falls.
   Viscomi was shot in the back in 1979 by John Hoopsick, who held a
longtime grudge against him, and who hours earlier purchased the
shotgun and ammunition at a K mart store in Niagara Falls.
   Terry Smith, a lawyer for the widow, said the store's sales clerk
should have known not to sell the weapon to Hoopsick, who was
described as obviously drunk and agitated at the time.
   Smith said the award was the first in New York state where a jury
has held a store liable for selling a weapon to a drunken person.
   Although federal firearms regulations prohibit the sale of guns
to minors, illegal aliens, people with drug dependencies and mental
deficiencies, there is no prohibition against sales to people who
are drunk, he said.
   Smith said there have been a number of successful civil cases
against gun retailers in other states, including a recent judgment
against K mart in a similar case in St. Claire Shores, Mich.
   Leslie Kota, a spokeswoman for K mart based in Troy, Mich., said
the company would appeal the ruling.
   K mart's lawyers had argued that Hoopsick was not visibly
intoxicated and that the sales clerk couldn't have known what
Hoopsick planned to do with the weapon.
   K mart has 15 days to file a posttrial motion in the trial-level
State Supreme Court.
   On Dec. 4, 1979, Viscomi, then 59, was shot with a 12-gauge
shotgun after returning home from work. One of the pellets from the
shotgun blast damaged Viscomi's spinal cord and he was left
paralyzed from the waist, Smith said.
   Hoopsick was sentenced to five years' probation after pleading
guilty to charges in March 1981. Viscomi died of a heart attack on
June 28, 1986, according to Smith.
   The case was originally tried in November 1986 and K mart was
found negligent in the selling the shotgun. The jury award the
Viscomis $500,000.
   K mart was unsuccessful in getting a state appellate court to
overturn the finding the next year.
   The one-week trial that ended Tuesday was limited to damages only.

   A medical assistant who tried to perform
liposuction but wound up killing her best friend instead was
sentenced Thursday to 45 days in jail and four years of intensive
probation.
   Stacy Lin Bickel, 25, of Tempe pleaded guilty in November to
negligent homicide in the death of Deborah Sue Tomazin, 24, of
Phoenix.
   She admitted giving Miss Tomazin an unintentionally lethal dose
of anesthetic while trying to prepare her for the medical procedure,
in which fatty cells are sucked from the body.
   The bungled attempt took place March 27 in the office of Miss
Bickel's former employer, Tempe plastic surgeon Richard Pavese.
   Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Lindsay Ellis also ordered
Miss Bickel to pay $5,500 in restitution to Miss Tomazin's family
and to perform 40 hours per week of community service indefinitely.
   A clerk for Ms. Ellis said intensive probation amounted to house
arrest, requiring written approval in advance of any
outside-the-residence activity.
   Miss Bickel will be able to work, the clerk said, but it was not
known if she had regained employment since she was fired.
   Detectives said Miss Tomazin, who died March 30, agreed to
undergo liposuction at the hands of her friend, who had assisted
Pavese in many operations and felt confident she could carry out the
procedure.

   The head of Mexico's powerful Oil Workers
Union was arraigned Thursday on homicide and arms charges as forces
in the governing party began moving to install leaders more
sympathetic to President Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
   A bomb threat and rumors of more arrests forced union local
chiefs to evacuate the union's national headquarters before they
could vote to confirm the choice of a new secretary-general.
Judicial police searched the building.
   Joaquin Hernandez Galicia and 50 other union leaders and
associates were arrested Tuesday and Wednesday. Thousands of oil
workers demonstrated in protest Thursday night in Mexico City's
Zocalo Plaza.
   A source in the Attorney General's Office said former Reynosa
Mayor Jose Cruz Contreras was suspected of smuggling arms shipments
for Hernandez Galicia from the United States and officials were
looking for him.
   The source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Mexican and
U.S. law enforcement officials met Thursday to try to determine the
origin of a weapons cache found in Hernandez Galicia's home.
   The source said Mexican officials suspected that drugs may have
been used to pay for the weapons.
   He said Hernandez Galicia faces up to 40 years in prison if
convicted.
   In a Mexico City prison Thursday, Hernandez Galicia told
reporters: ``They told me my family was kidnapped and if I didn't
give a statement that pleased the Federal Attorney General, I
wouldn't see them again.''
   He called his detention ``a dirty, prefabricated infamy.'' Still,
he urged oil workers to stay on the job.
   On Wednesday, Sen. Ricardo Camero Cardiel was named union
secretary-general for 30 days. He replaces Salvador Barragan
Camacho, who turned himself in after Hernandez Galicia was arrested
and Barragan Camacho's house was searched.
   Barragan Camacho, who has a history of heart trouble, is under
arrest in a hospital.
   The daily newspaper La Jornada said Camero Cardiel, ``with more
than 30 years of union activity, is a recognized member of
(Hernandez Galicia's) group.''
   Camero Cardiel pledged to use ``all legal means to win the
freedom of Hernandez, Barragan and other arrested leaders,'' the
newspaper said.
   Government sources said union rules were not followed in the
selection of Camero Cardiel and indicated it was likely he would not
remain in the post.
   ``The authentic workers, and there are thousands of them, will be
able to work better with the company and strengthen'' Pemex, the
state oil monopoly, under a new leadership, a government source said
on condition of anonymity.
   Labor Secretary Arsenio Farell Cubillas objected to the election
of Cardiel, saying that union bylaws require that the union's
interior secretary, Jose Melendez Maranto, should replace Barragan
Camacho.
   The government feels Melendez would be more sympathetic to
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, who has long feuded with the
union's powerful innner circle.
   But union spokesman Fernando Arreola said that Farell Cubillas
``obviously does not know the union's bylaws.''
   Arreola said an extraordinary session of more than 90 percent of
local representatives chose Cardiel for the remainder of Barragan
Camacho's five-year term.
   He said Melendez could have been selected under union bylaws but
that ``because it was not known how long Barragan Camacho would be
away, they picked Cardiel.''
   The Oil Workers Union, like most of the labor movement, is
closely tied to the government. But Hernandez Galicia, known by his
nickname La Quina, has a longstanding dispute with Salinas.
   The arrest of La Quina, and 50 others in a violent raid continued
to draw criticism Thursday, even from government-linked unions and
their leaders.
   The Labor Congress issued a statement Wednesday saying it
``strongly protests the violence used'' and called for the freedom
of those arrested.
   Soldiers blew down the door of Hernandez Galicia's home and a
federal agent was killed in the ensuing gunbattle.
   Leaders of the Mexican Labor Federation, the country's largest
labor federation, and the Labor Congress, a government-aligned
organization of nearly all the country's unions, met Thursday with
Salinas.
   A statement from the presidency said the meetings were
traditional New Year's calls, and did not mention the arrests.
Veteran Labor Federation leader Fidel Velazquez did not speak with
reporters after the meeting.
   In a second statement, Salinas expressed solidarity with
Velazquez and the labor movement.
   Hernandez Galicia, who held only a minor union office but has
been its unofficial boss for years, was charged with homicide,
possession of large quantitites of weapons, importing prohibited
weapons and resisting authority, said Fernando Arias Perez, an
attorney general's office spokesman.
   Authorities have said more than 200 Uzi submachine guns were
found in Hernandez Galicia's home when he was arrested Tuesday in
Ciudad Madero, about 220 miles northeast of Mexico City on the Gulf
of Mexico.
   He told investigators Uzis and about 30,000 cartridges were
secretly delivered to him on Dec. 10 and were ``to defend his union
members, given the existing situation in the country,'' the attorney
general's office said.
   Arias Perez said 50 other people arrested face charges of fraud,
weapons and tax evasion.

   President Reagan says he's handing the nation
over to the ``good hands'' of George Bush, advising his successor to
keep a wary eye on the Soviet Union and warning against ``an erosion
of the American spirit.''
   In a folksy Oval Office speech bidding adieu to the nation,
Reagan boasted Wednesday of his accomplishments and ignored many of
the difficulties that arose during his eight years in office.
   ``We meant to change a nation, and instead, we changed a world,''
he said.
   Yet Reagan also admitted that his self-styled conservative
revolution left many things unchanged, and he asked his followers to
stick around and help his successor.

   U.S. airlines have three days to check for
cross-wiring in 300 Boeing 737s, following speculation that faulty
warnings deceived the pilot of a British 737 into shutting down his
only good engine when the other one caught fire.
   ``We think this is not a very likely scenario, but it's a check
that can be done very, very quickly without disrupting service,''
said Federal Aviation Administration spokesman John Leyden.
   The FAA order late Wednesday applies to eight Piedmont Airlines
737-400s with U.S.-French CFM56 engines similar to the British
Midland Airways 737 that crashed Sunday in England, killing 44
people. It also would cover 292 smaller Boeing 737-300s operated by
10 U.S. airlines.
   No planes were grounded by the order, and other 737s and other
planes using the CFM56 engines would not be affected.

   The Soviet Union says it will try to maintain its
miniscule AIDS rate by screening foreigners for the deadly virus,
even forcing mandatory tests of some visitors who cannot provide
proper medical proof.
   Foreigners who want to stay in the country for three months or
more will be subject to testing for the disease beginning next
month, Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov said.
   ``Here, there cannot be any discrimination,'' Gerasimov said.
``We conduct tests of our own people and besides, statistics show
the Soviet Union is sharply lagging behind other countries, say the
United States, in the number of ill people (with AIDS). And we just
don't want to catch up.''
   The Soviets once regarded AIDS as a disease spawned by Western
sexual depravity and drug use. One Soviet newspaper's account had
even claimed the virus was the result of a U.S. biological warfare
experiment gone haywire.

   Olympic diver Bruce Kimball announced a
surprise guilty plea to drunken-driving manslaughter to spare
grieving relatives who had just heard gruesome testimony on the
carnage that killed two teen-agers, his father said.
   ``He did it for the right reasons,'' a sobbing Dick Kimball,
father of the 1984 silver medalist, said outside the courtroom. ``He
did not want to put the families of the kids through a horrible
trial, or our family.''
   The plea came Wednesday as testimony was just beginning in the
Circuit Court trial on charges that the athlete drunkenly plowed
into a crowd of teen-agers with his sports car in suburban Brandon
on Aug. 1. The late night crash injured six people. Kimball and his
two passengers escaped serious injury.
   The case drew international attention when Kimball decided to
compete for a place on the 1988 Olympic diving team less than a
month after the crash. He failed to make the squad.

<HEAD>Baryshnikov and Balanchine Open `Dance In America' Season on PBS</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Newsfeatures Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mikhail Baryshnikov danced in George Balanchine's
New York City Ballet for only one year a decade ago, but it made a
lasting impression.
   The superstar of ballet dances tonight on PBS in two ballets,
``Apollo'' and ``Who Cares,'' created by Balanchine, this century's
master choreographer.
   ``Baryshnikov Dances Balanchine'' is the first offering in the
13th season of ``Dance in America,'' presented by ``Great
Performances'' on the Public Broadcasting Service.
   Asked the most important thing he learned from Balanchine, the
dancer said in a telephone interview, ``I wish I could say he taught
me how to choreograph. That would be the best thing.
   ``I learned from him a lot. He was a very extraordinary man and I
had a lot of fun to be with him.''
   He says he doesn't have a favorite Balanchine ballet. ``They're
all pretty incredible.''
   ``Apollo'' is about the birth of the god, his realization of his
divinity and his early education in the power of the arts by the
muses of dance, poetry and mime. The muses are danced by Christine
Dunham, Leslie Browne and Stephanie Saland of American Ballet
Theater.
   ``Apollo'' was Balanchine's first of many collaborations with
composer Igor Stravinsky. He created ``Apollo'' in 1928, and it is
his earliest ballet that is still regularly danced.
   Baryshnikov had danced ``Apollo'' under Balanchine's guidance. He
did not dance for him in ``Who Cares,'' which Balanchine created for
the New York City Ballet in 1970, after Baryshnikov had left the
company.
   For ``Who Cares,'' set to 18 songs by George Gershwin,
Balanchine's choreography is lighthearted, plotless and elegant.
It's a style which suits Baryshnikov, an admirer of Fred Astaire.
Baryshnikov, Deirdre Carberry, Miss Browne and Miss Dunham dance to
eight of the songs on TV.
   Speaking of Balanchine's neoclassic style, in which traditional
ballet steps and phrases are used in innovative ways, Baryshnikov
said, ``What Balanchine has done for ballet is, he opened to all
choreographers future possibilities. He showed what can be done with
that kind of music, movement, ideas and aesthetics.
   ``He pushed the ballet finally to the level of all visual art,
music and poetry. Otherwise ballet would have been dragging a
century behind everything else.''
   On the TV show, Baryshnikov calls dancing for Balanchine the
``experience of a lifetime.'' And he talks about how he felt when
Balanchine praised him.
   ``After the performance ... I was lucky to get _ I mean sometimes
... a good review from him, and it was just one word, and ... he
just opened your dressing room and said, `Excellent. Good night.'
You know? And went home. And stars are shining, you know, for you.''
   Baryshnikov first saw ``Apollo'' when he was 11 or 12 in his
native Riga, Latvia. It was danced by Alicia Alonso's company, from
Cuba. He first met Balanchine in 1972, when the New York City Ballet
toured the Soviet Union.
   In 1974, when he was 26, Baryshnikov defected to the West in
Toronto, while on a tour of Canada with a group of dancers from the
Bolshoi Ballet. A Kirov Ballet dancer since he was 18, Baryshnikov
was acclaimed by the Soviet public and critics. He was the youngest
star to receive the State Merit of the U.S.S.R. But he felt the need
of ``artistic freedom'' _ to dance something beside the princes in
such ballet staples as ``Swan Lake'' and ``The Sleeping Beauty.''
   Ballerina Natalia Makarova, a frequent partner at the Kirov
before she defected to the West during the 1970 tour, led
Baryshnikov to American Ballet Theater.
   He had been with the ABT just long enough to be looking for still
further challenges when Balanchine heard about his restlessness and
invited him to join the New York City Ballet. Balanchine invited
Baryshnikov to his apartment, the dancer recalls during the
television program. ``He opened the door. He said, `You don't mind
if I continue doing what I do?' I said, `Sure.' He was ironing his
shirts. And ... we started to talk.''
   When Baryshnikov was asked to return to American Ballet Theater,
as artistic director, he said, ``I discussed with him (Balanchine).
He suggested I would do that. It was friendly, absolutely. I moved
back to Ballet Theater with his blessing, you know.''
   Baryshnikov and the American Ballet Theater ballerinas went to
Denmark where the program, a co-production of WNET in New York and
Danmarks Radio, was filmed. ``They have a good facility there and a
good crew. I had a good time,'' Baryshnikov said.
   ``I hope the audience will enjoy the program. What else can I
say?''

<TEXT>
   Tokyo is a long way from ``Sesame Street,'' but
Big Bird and Barkley have a pretty good time in Japan, after
learning some lessons about homesickness, international friendship
and respect for different cultures.
   The one-hour special, ``Big Bird in Japan,'' airs Monday on PBS.
It was filmed on location in Tokyo and Kyoto and is a co-production
of Children's Television Worship and NHK network in Japan.
   Arriving in Japan on an overly organized tour _ they have five
minutes to see Tokyo _ Big Bird and Barkley miss the bus after
becoming enthralled by all the people with black hair from
Cleveland. (They later learn, among other things, that ``o-hi-o'' is
Japanese for ``good morning.'')
   The two big Muppets wander the strange city alone, prompting Big
Bird to sing a song about homesickness. But a friendly young
Japanese woman (Maiko Kawakami) befriends them.
   ``What kind of tour would abandon a bird and a dog in a strange
country?'' she wonders.
   ``Probably the same kind of tour that would take a bird and a dog
along in the first place,'' Big Bird suggests.
   She promises to help the two get to Kyoto where they can hook up
with the tour again and head for home.
   Along the way, Big Bird uses chopsticks; learns that he should
take off his shoes, if he has any, before entering a Japanese home;
tries to fit on futon; and learns a few Japanese words _ ``At least
on `Sesame Street' I knew the alphabet,'' he sighs after trying to
decipher the Japanese street signs.
   Jon Stone wrote and directed the special. There is a storyline,
about the mysterious young woman perhaps being the the Bamboo
Princess of Japanese legend.
   ``Sesame Street'' is seen in Japanese schools where it teaches
English to high school and junior high school students. In the
special, Big Bird and Barkley visit an elementary school.
   The special has already aired once in Japan and will be repeated.
CTW says it was a hit, getting three times NHK network's usual
rating for educational programs.

<HEAD>Reagan's Economic Accomplishments</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   His optimism was out of style with much of the
investment community and the economic fraternity throughout his term
in office, but in retrospect his view seems justified by the results.
   The Dow Jones industrial average produced a 16 percent average
compound investment return during his two terms, and the bond
market's 10 percent real rate of total return was the best for any
presidency since Warren Harding's.
   As the president said in his farewell address, ``We weren't just
marking time; we made a difference.''
   A great many of the investment talent in Wall Street and the
economic brains of academe and business didn't really believe him,
though, and you can find it imprinted on their record year after
year during the 1980s.
   While he exuded hope they issued warnings.
   It was a regular ritual: When the annual White House economic
forecast was issued it was instantly discounted as overly
optimistic. Sometimes it was, but maybe it was intentional _ a
challenge to work for, rather than an easy mark.
   Throughout eight years the warnings came from Wall Street about
inflation, recession, monetary collapse, niggardly corporate
earnings, the weaknesses of the manufacturing sector, the budget
deficits. Disaster seemed imminent.
   Maybe President Reagan was lucky to escape the disasters, and
there are grounds for believing that some of the financial
disappointments of his administration might adversely affect the
economy for years to come.
   Still, there was a job to be done when he entered office and it
couldn't wait. The recession of the early 1980s was by some measures
the worst since the Great Depression of the 1930s. Moreover,
confidence was shot.
   The great American manufacturing machine was in its own private
depression, outmatched both domestically and abroad by newer
entrants in the world marketplace. Inflation roared. Interest rates
were high. Faith was a feather.
   It was so bad President Jimmy Carter had referred to the American
people as suffering from a malaise. Optimism wasn't in the picture,
but it was put there. Nothing does it like economic progress, or the
belief that it will come.
   Interest rates began a long decline, from a prime above 18
percent in 1981 to under 8 percent by the mid-1980s. Inflation came
down from the double digits to under 4 percent. Economic activity
surged. Disposable personal income shot from a gain of less than 1
percent in 1982 to 5.9 percent in 1984. Profits ascended from minus
27 percent in 1982 to plus 22 percent in 1983. More than 19 million
jobs were created and filled, 3 million of them in 1988 alone.
   Rusty from disuse, the American manufacturing sector was
resurrected and became competitive again. Almost stagnant, and
sometimes falling during the previous two decades, manufacturing
labor productivity grew at an annual rate of nearly 3.5 percent from
1986 through the third quarter of 1988. More than 400,000 jobs were
created in manufacturing in both 1987 and 1988, and much of the
increased production was sent overseas, helping to lower the trade
deficit.
   You might never have guessed some of these achievements if you
placed credence in the threats, warnings, caveats, criticisms,
advisories and the like that accompanied daily, weekly and monthly
analyses from research departments.
   Maybe it was just a ritualistic rite to distract the demons.
Somebody believed; otherwise, the economy couldn't have done what it
did _ stocks couldn't have risen, for instance _ and Reagan couldn't
have been re-elected.
   The president believed, and it was contagious.

<HEAD>Boyd Jefferies: Chainsmoking Workaholic, Admitted Felon, Key Fraud
Witness</HEAD>

   Boyd L. Jefferies used to thrive on four hours of
sleep a night, arriving for work at 1:30 a.m. and staying until
evening to command the aggressive stock-trading desk of the
brokerage that bears his name.
   Now the 58-year-old ex-broker spends much of his time with
defense lawyers and federal investigators, chainsmoking cigarettes,
answering questions and wondering when he will get back to his
passion on the 33rd floor of a downtown Los Angeles skyscraper,
buying and selling big blocks of stock.
   A criminal courtroom has replaced his sprawling trading desk; the
tension of interrogation has replaced the thrill of stock
speculation; the priority of avoiding jail time has replaced the
obsession with serving clients.
   Once spectacularly successful, widely admired and courted by
almost every big takeover strategist, Jefferies has been transformed
over the last two years into what gangsters might call the biggest
canary in his business.
   He is the leading prosecution witness in at least three major
fraud cases that arose indirectly from the man who squealed on him,
Ivan F. Boesky, the stock speculator and inside trader now serving a
three-year prison term.
   In exchange for lenient treatment, Jefferies agreed with federal
prosecutors in March 1987 to plead guilty to two violations of
securities laws, cooperate in other investigations, resign from his
brokerage, Jefferies &amp; Co., and stay out of the securities business
for at least five years.
   ``Yes, I miss it,'' Jefferies said, standing outside a Manhattan
federal courtroom on a break in his recent witness-stand debut in
the stock-manipulation case against GAF Corp. and a top company
officer.
   He declined to elaborate and spent much of the break in a witness
waiting room, puffing Benson &amp; Hedges 100s, chewing gum and slowly
pacing the floor. He looked tan and fit in a dark-blue business
suit, but his blue eyes were slightly bloodshot and he seldom smiled.
   ``Here's a guy who used to get up at 1:30 in the morning to go
work,'' said James P. Linn, Jefferies' lawyer. ``It's not easy for a
man who's worked like that to stand around in a federal courthouse.''
   Nevertheless, life isn't that bad for Jefferies. He remains
fabulously wealthy and owns expensive homes in Indian Wells, Calif.,
and Aspen, Colo., which he shares with his wife. He spends much of
his time on the telephone to keep abreast of the market, though he
generally refrains from calling his colleagues at the company, Linn
said.
   ``I suppose he's allowed to call, but the company doesn't like
for him to, so he doesn't,'' the lawyer said in an interview.
   A good golfer, Jefferies has started a scholarship program in
Aspen for aspiring young golf amateurs. Although defense lawyers
have tried to claim this generosity is meant to impress the judge
who ultimately will sentence him, Linn denied that.
   ``The fact is, Boyd Jefferies had a son killed in an accident. He
is passionately involved with young people, having lost his son,''
Linn said. ``He has no ulterior motive in doing his golf deal.''
   Jefferies' punishment remains unclear, but is expected to be far
less than the maximum sentence of 10 years' imprisonment and
$500,000 in fines he faces for pleading guilty to one count of
violating stock-margin requirements and one count of aiding and
abetting to keep false books.
   He even suggested on the witness stand, in cross-examination by
defense attorneys in the GAF trial, that he doesn't expect to serve
any prison time.
   To a large extent, the severity of the sentence will depend on
the fruits of his cooperation, which were bruised this past week
when a federal judge decreed a mistrial in the GAF case because the
prosecution mishandled a key piece of evidence.
   Aside from his involvement in GAF, Jefferies is a leading witness
in securities fraud prosecutions against Paul Bilzerian, a
Florida-based takeover speculator, and Salim B. Lewis, a New
York-based securities professional. Both are former Jefferies'
clients.
   Linn and other associates of Jefferies have tried to portray him
as a man so driven to serve his customers that he crossed the bounds
of legality on their behalf, not out of personal avarice.
   Many big investors have expressed faith in him, such as Texas
oilman T. Boone Pickens and Minneapolis takeover strategist Irwin
Jacobs. But Jefferies' lawyer conceded that other clients might feel
betrayed by a trusted broker who later turned state's evidence in a
major criminal investigation.
   ``Yes, I suppose there would be some of those people,'' Linn
said. ``But Boyd still has a very loyal and large following. He did
a lot of things for a lot of people.''
   Jefferies' rapid rise, generosity and crashing downfall are part
of the folklore of the 1980s takeover boom. A UCLA graduate and
former ranch hand, he started in the securities business by landing
an entry-level job at a small brokerage, quit six years later and
founded his own firm with two employees.
   By early this decade, Jefferies &amp; Co. had swelled to more than
400 employees, with a large trading center in Los Angeles, five
other offices nationwide and one in London.
   It became known as the leading firm where investors could trade
big blocks of stock quickly and discreetly, without going through
conventional stock exchanges.
   Jefferies was said to delight in making markets for high-profile
stocks, and the positions he took in well-known targets sometimes
determined the outcome of takeover battles.
   In late 1986, for example, Jefferies helped Toronto-based Campeau
Corp. acquire Allied Stores Corp. by selling the Canadian developer
a large block of its Allied holdings for more than $1.7 billion.
   Part of the attraction for takeover investors was Jefferies'
policy of absolute confidentiality and extraordinary accommodation
in doing business at their convenience, no matter when.
   Jacobs once said he could call the company as early as 3 a.m. and
Jefferies would answer the telephone, having arrived early to trade
European stocks.
   ``There were no such things as hours for Boyd,'' Jacobs said.
``You could find Boyd seven days a week, 24 hours a day.''
   Despite predictions that his brokerage would falter following his
plea agreement, Jefferies &amp; Co. continues to be an aggressive trader
and he intends to return there when his legal ordeal finally ends,
Linn said.
   ``He's lost without that business. That business literally was
his life,'' the lawyer said.

<TEXT>
   Once a little city with clean, if rainy, skies and
clear mountain views, fast-growing Seattle has become a metropolis
with the usual smog and traffic jams. Some people are starting to
protest.
   A citizens group turned in 18,000 signatures on an initiative to
limit the height and density of downtown buildings, and debate is
gearing up before a vote this spring.
   The building boom is easy to see, and much of it has occurred in
the past decade. Three skyscrapers are under construction, and
permit applications for three more were submitted before a recently
imposed six-month moratorium on downtown growth.
   The 55-story Washington Mutual Tower was completed last year,
bumping the 50-story 1001 Fourth Avenue Plaza to third tallest. No.
1 is the West Coast's tallest building, the 76-story black-glass
Columbia Seafirst Center built in 1985, before downtown zoning went
into effect. A dozen office towers are 30 stories or more, and all
but three were opened in the 1980s.
   The thousands of workers in these buildings, plus tourists and
shoppers, make downtown Seattle a lively place.
   Fishmongers, farmers' stalls, crafts booths and restaurants
compete shoulder-to-shoulder at the historic, hectic Pike Place
Market.
   Redevelopment is continuing at the downtown waterfront. And the
downtown retail core, with major flagship department stores and a
variety of small businesses, recently settled one 30-year-old
land-use debate with the opening of Westlake Center, a new mall of
expensive shops and a 24-story office tower.
   Supporters of the Citizens Alternative Plan to Downtown
Development, or CAP, say overdevelopment in downtown will mean more
pollution as more people commute by car and more box-like apartment
buildings replace single-family houses and dilute the flavor of old
city neighborhoods.
   CAP wants to limit building height to about 40 stories in the
office district. New office floor space would be limited to 500,000
square feet a year for the next five years and 1 million square feet
a year from 1995 through 1999. After that, the ceiling would be
lifted unless re-imposed by the City Council.
   By contrast, nearly 6 million square feet of downtown office
space is newly completed, under construction or has received city
permits, said Virginia Galle, a City Council member and CAP
supporter.
   At the present rate of growth, in 10 years some 67,000 new office
workers are expected to occupy 52,000 new households and make 29,000
more car trips daily into downtown, she said.
   There is no height limit under the city's current zoning plan. A
building's size is worked out according to a formula based on the
size of the site, with extra height allowed in exchange for such
amenities as plazas, retail space and day care centers.
   CAP supporters insist they want growth, but not at a high cost to
the environment and the neighborhoods.
   ``We're not anti-growth in the traditional sense,'' says Patrick
Strosahl, a jeweler and president of Vision Seattle, which supports
CAP. ``We're really much more into shaping growth so that it
produces and accentuates the livability of the city.''
   Some participants in the growth debate argue the city needs
controls that are more lenient than the CAP initiative.
   Mayor Charles Royer presented a plan of his own that would limit
office towers to about 50 stories. It would stiffen the zoning code,
but not as much as CAP would.
   Royer also wants to adjust the bonus system used to allow
developers to build higher. His plan would shift the emphasis of the
bonuses from street-level amenities to housing, human services and
open space.
   The Downtown Seattle Association, a group of developers and
business executives, contends the 1985 zoning law is strict enough.
   John Gilmore, president of the association, says downtown growth
makes more sense than spreading development into neighborhods and
suburbs. A downtown provides a focal point for a rapid-transit
system, something Seattle needs, he said. And Seattle must grow, he
contended. ``We're having childen like every other part of the
country and there's got to be jobs.''
   Folke Nyberg, a professor of urban planning and architecture at
the University of Washington, agreed Seattle's location on the
Pacific Rim means it will grow, but disagreed that concentrated
downtown growth is good.
   Seattle has an ``hour-glass'' figure, squeezed between Puget
Sound and Lake Washington, he said. ``So there are some very limited
physical constraints that makes it imperative that we have an
effective transportation solution before we allow growth to happen,
and this was not done.''
   A better way to grow, Nyberg said, would be in decentralized
clusters throughout the region. People in these smaller cities would
live near their jobs and go to downtown Seattle mainly for
conventions and cultural events.
   Instead, unplanned growth can be seen in declining air quality,
traffic congestion and more homelessness caused by a lack of
afforable housing, he said.
   Seattle, which ``has been a very livable city,'' he said, failed
to learn from other cities' mistakes. Asked why, he replied, ``It's
all greed.''
   The growth-control initiative goes before voters May 16, the City
Council decided last week.
   Gilmore, of the Downtown Seattle Association, said that the
city's 1985 downtown zoning was the product of four years of debate
and that any changes should be made through more hearings and City
Council votes. The American Institute of Architects' local chapter
agrees.
   CAP supporters, however, say their plan is reasonable and timely.
   According to Strosahl, San Francisco needed to enact stiffer
downtown limits in 1986 because it waited too long, until the cost
of housing went way up and the character of the city changed.
   San Francisco voters approved the limits after a building spree
in which 25 million square feet of office space was added between
1979 and 1984. The high rises nearly blocked out all the sun in San
Francisco's financial district.
   San Francisco's voter-approved plan limits new office space to
475,000 square feet for several years for a city with a population
of 690,000. That compares with CAP's limits of 500,000 square feet
for five years and 1 million square feet for the next five in a city
of 490,000.
   Gilmore suggests people who signed CAP did not really want to
limit growth, but were just annoyed with traffic disruption downtown
caused by construction of a downtown bus tunnel and a state
convention center. The initiative text was long and complicated, and
people probably did not read it, he said.
   What's more, the petition had just 329 more signatures than it
needed.
   Strosahl thinks voters will pass the initiative, but he expects a
highly financed campaign against it.

<HEAD>City Schools: What Does It Take To Reform Them?</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE MITGANG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A hint of revolution is in the air in at least
some big-city school systems: an apparent readiness, at long last,
to stop bickering and start reforming.
   The nation's largest system, New York City, continues to generate
shocking headlines about violence, drugs and widespread neighborhood
school board corruption. Within the last month, an elementary school
principal and three teachers were picked up on drug charges. And
last week, a kindergartner was found with a .25-caliber pistol.
   But the picture has begun to brighten elsewhere.
   In Pittsburgh, Dade County, Fla., and Rochester, N.Y., teacher
unions and school administrators have beaten their swords into
reform-minded contracts that boost teacher pay and power while
making them directly accountable for their students' performance.
   In Detroit, where the dropout rate is at least 40 percent, fed up
voters elected a reform school board slate in November. They also
refused to approve new school taxes and bonds aimed at paying off an
estimated $158 million deficit.
   There are even hopeful signs in Chicago's schools, branded 14
months ago as the nation's worst by U.S. Secretary of Education
William J. Bennett. Illinois Gov. James Thompson signed legislation
last month scrapping Chicago's central school board next July, to be
replaced by parent-run councils empowered to set budgets and hire
and fire principals.
   That hardly means such cities have solved their school problems,
officials are quick to admit.
   Chicago's new governing structure may lead to unprecedented
parent power, but the basic problems still fester: a 45 percent
dropout rate and below-average standardized test scores.
   As Rochester teacher union leader Adam Urbanski put it: ``We have
set the table; we have not served the meal yet.''
   Hopeful signs are scarce in the 960,000-student New York City
system.
   It's true that New York's state legislature recently passed
long-sought bills clearing the way for desperately needed school
construction and making new rules to curb school board patronage.
   But Schools Chancellor Richard Green, whose much-heralded arrival
as an outsider from Minneapolis last March raised hopes for new
approaches, has instead found himself tangled in investigations of
local school board corruption.
   To some, New York remains a system adrift.
   ``At this point, there are a lot of people putting out ideas, and
a lot of people wringing their hands. We have to have the
administration put out a specific plan so that people can get behind
it,'' said Robin Willner, deputy executive director of Interface, a
watchdog group that issues frequent reports on city school issues.
   All of which raises the question: What does it take to put the
nation's largest school systems on the road to reform?
   Relative size and the power of the purse are certainly key
factors, says Samuel L. Husk, executive director of the Council of
Great City Schools. Pittsburgh, for example, has only 40,000
students, and its school board has taxing authority.
   New York City has 25 times more students, and its school board
has no authority to tax. Its size and tangled politics foster a
feeling of hopelessness. Some now openly wonder how many
drug-addicted principals and teachers it will take to finally jolt
the system.
   ``I think that you need a catalyst. I hate to say it has to be
horrible. Unfortunately in a school system this size, it may have to
be,'' said Willner.
   New Orleans' 80,000-student public schools have an additional
disadvantage: they must compete with a popular, 35,000-student
parochial school system that siphons off political support.
   But all cities have obstacles to overcome. Whether they succeed
in reform, or even attempt it, usually depends on someone in
authority willing to lead the charge.
   ``You need leadership at the top. Those at the top and those in
the private sector have to see it as an absolute emergency. It's a
political problem,'' said Ernest L. Boyer, a national spokesman for
reform and president of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement
of Teaching, which has produced several reports on urban school
problems.
   In Rochester and Pittsburgh, new superintendents have made a
difference.
   Rochester's Peter McWalters, named in 1986, signaled willingness
to form a working partnership with teachers. Under a contract that
took effect this year, each teacher is directly responsible for 20
students, holding daily meetings and home visits where necessary. In
return, top teacher salaries will rise to $70,000 and school-based
planning teams consisting of teachers, parents, students and
principals will set goals for each school.
   ``When McWalters came in, he shared my sense of urgency, and he
was devoid of the baggage and inhibitions that management often
has,'' said Urbanski. ``His passion proved infectious. After our
collective bargaining agreement, we had left little choice for the
political and business structure but to follow suit to help us make
it work.''
   Pittsburgh's superintendent, Richard C. Wallace, who arrived in
1980 as an outsider to a city enmeshed in a bitter dispute over
school desegregation, helped move the school system beyond that
dispute and establish it as a national model of reform. He promptly
began biweekly meetings with the teacher union, established a center
to enhance teacher skills, and attracted millions in corporate funds
to support innovative programs.
   Likewise in Miami's Dade County, the teacher union and
superintendent have stopped fighting and started cooperating to
devise a reform plan.
   But the key factor was leadership, said Husk. ``The thing to
remember is Florida had an education governor, Bob Graham, and he
made a substantial investment in schools long before other states
were even thinking about reform.''
   Some feel New York is still waiting for such leadership.
   ``We don't have any one elective official who has made education
their primary issue,'' said Willner. ``In terms of using the bully
pulpit, having an education mayor or governor, that hasn't happened
in New York.''
   In New Orleans, meanwhile, the bad times keep rolling for a
school system perennially starved of leadership and tax dollars.
Still, many are encouraged by the election last year of Louisiana's
reform-minded governor, Buddy Roemer, a property tax increase last
April, and a new, expanded school board.
   That may not be enough. A state report showed that 370 of New
Orleans' 4,800-teacher staff were either uncertified or had
temporary certificates, and despite recent increases, salaries still
average just $26,800, about $2,000 below the national average.
   ``The New Orleans public schools remain a factory for the
expansion of the underclass,'' said Lee Gary, a private education
consultant.
   Boyer sees four elements necessary to move big systems toward
reform: clearly stated goals, smaller schools structured so that
students no longer feel anonymous, more school-based authority where
officials are regularly accountable for results, and above all,
partnerships between parents, civic, corporate and educational
officials.
   ``If you pull these reform efforts apart, these cities are making
progress on governance, and partnerships,'' said Boyer. ``What I
don't see is much attention to school climate, student alienation,
and the question of educational goals and outcomes.''

   Vice President George Bush stretched back in
his office chair, at ease as he reflected on the power and the
problems awaiting him when the V word is erased from his title and
``I'm president, I'm the one who's calling the shots.''
   With exhilaration tempered by ``this deficit looming over
everything,'' Bush takes office at noon Friday, convinced there is
neither a need nor a mandate for dramatic change to put his imprint
on the White House.
   ``Automatically, that happens,'' he said, with the transfer of
power from Ronald Reagan's 40th presidency to his 41st.
   As keynotes to the Bush era, the last eight years are likely to
weigh far more heavily than the first hundred days.
   ``I've been a part of this administration and it isn't like there
is a need for radical change,'' the president-elect said in an
interview in his vice presidential office, across a narrow, private
street from the White House.
   His transition teams have gone throughout the government to
prepare for the new administration, but ``it's different,'' not like
those he met as CIA director in 1976 when Jimmy Carter's advance
guard arrived ``saying we're going to find out what's wrong here and
change it.'' Different, too, from ``the teams we sent sallying forth
in 1980 to go out and undo all the bad things that we had campaigned
against.''
   In contrast, Bush believes his administration needs to ``correct
one big problem,'' the federal deficit, then ``build on some
tremendous successes'' of the Reagan years.
   ``That's at least the approach that I'm going to bring to the
job,'' he said, sipping a cup of Chinese tea. ``... People
understood that when they were voting. They weren't looking for a
radical shift.'' That last thought was a refrain throughout the
conversation.
   Bush said he envisions no single theme for his first hundred
days, no centerpiece drive like the one that won approval of
President Reagan's tax cut economic plan in 1981. The initial months
usually are the strongest season in a first term, and the most
promising for congressional acceptance of proposals from a new
administration. That goes double for a Republican president seeking
action in a Democratic Congress.
   The new president will set out his agenda in his inaugural
address on Friday and in an address to Congress early next month. He
said the message will not be one of major overhaul, ``for very
obvious reasons. I've been a part of what we have been doing, what
this president, the present president has accomplished ....''
   The tie to Reagan was on his mind as he performed one of his last
vice presidential duties, presiding over the ``kind of antiquated
drill'' in which Congress counted the electoral votes that made him
president.
   ``I was thinking ... well, this is historically interesting
because this is a continuation, hopefully building. There's going to
be change, but hopefully a building on what's happened.''
   Inevitably, then, comes the question of how this new president
can put his imprint on an administration he heralds as a
continuation of what Reagan began.
   ``Style, message, people, be yourself,'' Bush said. ``... I made
my mind up as vice president to do my job one way. But I'm not vice
president, I'm president. I'm the one who's calling the shots. I'm
the one who's going to set the agenda ...
   ``So automatically, that happens. That happens at the time when I
put my hand on that Bible and hold my right hand in the air and say
that oath. It happens.''
   Bush said the successs and problems of presidential leadership
will continue to be identified with Reagan for a short time, but
``in a while, six months from now, that will be identified with me.''
   For all the problems that will be on his new desk on Saturday
morning, Bush said he is excited about the task and eager to
confront the agenda.
   ``If it weren't for this deficit looming over everything else,
leave all the rest of the problems in there, I'd feel like a spring
colt,'' he said.

   When George Carlin's comedy routine on the
``seven dirty words'' was broadcast by a radio station in 1978, it
prompted a U.S. Supreme Court ruling on indecency.
   A decade later, a character on the hit network sitcom ``Designing
Women'' used a derivative of one of those words in describing
another character who was obsessed with enlarging her bosom.
   No, it isn't just imagination. Network standards are loosening up.
   ``The networks are being more lenient, and I think the reason is
a five-letter word _ C-A-B-L-E,'' said Harry Thomason, executive
producer of ``Designing Women.''
   Sexually explicit language and situations on network television
have produced occasional complaints, but audiences are apparently
rather blase after being presented a variety of R-rated cable fare,
not to mention videocassettes. A.C. Nielsen Co. estimates that 62.2
percent of U.S. homes with televisions also have a VCR.
   The networks, faced with remote-control ``grazing,'' cable
options and videocassettes, are having to loosen up or lose viewers.
   NBC, the No. 1 network, broadcast ``Favorite Son,'' a political
potboiler spiced up with scenes of sexual bondage.
   In an episode of ABC's ``thirtysomething,'' a wife crawled around
on the floor in search of a fumbled diaphragm.
   Last season, ``Saturday Night Live'' executive producer Lorne
Michaels complained about his battle with network censors over a
sketch whose purpose was to see how often actors could say the word
for the male sex organ on network TV. This season, the sketch got on
the air.
   ``The average family in a major urban center can have access to
30-plus different television signals, not to mention home video,
(where) they can see explicit language, full nudity and simulated
sex in far more graphic and strong ways than you've ever seen on
network television,'' says Alan Gerson, NBC vice president for
program marketing and administration.
   He says networks are loosening standards, but carefully keeping
back from the ``cutting edge'' of change.
   ``We're not changing first,'' Gerson said.
   Do viewers mind?
   ``I get a lot of discussion on it, but really when you sit down
and look at it and hear what's said, I don't really hear anybody
complaining,'' said Art Chapman of the Fort Worth Star-Telegram,
president of the Television Critics Association.
   ``The fact is,'' he said, ``whether you like it or not, it does
produce ratings, which means that people are watching it.''
   ``There are three groups of viewers out there,'' said Dorothy
Swanson, head of Virginia-based Viewers for Quality Television.
``There's your group that would really like to see more (explicit
material). They enjoy that. It's interesting, and it's entertaining,
and it's fun. ...
   ``Then there's another group that are your prudes who really feel
that there shouldn't be a single dirty word, no open-mouthed
kissing, no bedroom scenes. Those people are going to always object,
and they must be just screaming right about now.
   ``And then there's the group that just accepts it and keeps their
eye on it and turns the dial if they don't like it.''
   When the radio station broadcast Carlin's ``seven dirty words''
routine _ Carlin was explaining that there are seven words not
allowed to be broadcast _ a complaint to the Federal Communications
Commission prompted a lawsuit that led to the Supreme Court ruling.
The FCC does not get involved in network standards, but investigates
complaints against the stations that it licenses.
   A complaint about a network show would have to meet the FCC's
definition of indecency before action would be taken. Indecency is
described as ``patently offensive as measured by contemporary
community standards for the broadcast medium.''
   For network censors, ``community standards'' apply to a global
village, where a ``community'' can be a time period or a demographic
group. The changing expectations of television audiences have
changed the stereotypical scissor-wielding censor into something of
ad hoc sociologist.
   ``TV is a dynamic medium. It has to stay in touch with society.
It has to grow as society grows and deal with subjects that are
relevant to people's lives,'' said Matthew Margo, CBS vice president
for program practices.
   ``I think the objective here is not to go too far. It's to be
willing to grow, to be willing to take prudent risks, but never to
do anything that's going to offend a significant portion of our
viewing audience or advertisers or affiliates.''
   All three networks have cut back their standards and practices
departments to save money, but insist nothing has gotten on the air
that would not have before.
   The cutbacks have, however, ``increased the possibility of
risk,'' said Alfred R. Schneider, ABC vice president for broadcast
standards and practices, ``because you don't have an overview and
backup system that existed.''
   CBS and ABC have eliminated one level of censors and put a bigger
workload on supervisors. NBC eliminated its standards and practices
department completely, re-assigning most of its functions to the
entertainment division, which may be akin to the fox guarding the
henhouse.
   But NBC was no doubt chastened by its experience with Geraldo
Rivera's two-hour special ``Devil Worship: Exposing Satan's
Underground.''
   Though the sensationalistic special ranked No. 5 in the Nielsen
ratings for the week, NBC said it lost money because so many
advertisers pulled out. Gerson says the show was actually ``a
triumph'' for the remnants of the standards department, in view of
how much gruesome material was eliminated.
   During a recent presentation to television critics meeting in Los
Angeles, NBC Entertainment President Brandon Tartikoff was accosted
by an actor dressed as a priest and forced to swear on a stack of
Bibles that he would not air another Geraldo Rivera special.
   ``Devil Worship'' was attacked by television critics in part
because of its early time period, 8 p.m. EST, when presumably
children could be watching. In fact, much of the shift in standards
has taken place after 9 p.m. when networks assume mostly adults are
watching.
   An episode of NBC's 10 o'clock program ``L.A. Law'' opened in the
setting of a fertility clinic where a patient providing a sperm
sample moaned loudly from behind a bathroom door. It turned out he
was having trouble getting the lid off the specimen jar. In an
episode of the 9 p.m. ``Cheers'' on NBC, Sam the bartender was
stranded behind a table because of his state of sexual excitement.
   ``The standards really relate to the kind of program you're
dealing in,'' said Schneider. ``What may work in a 10 o'clock
program, like `thirtysomething,' ... would be totally inappropriate
to an 8 o'clock program.''
   One way standards departments have cut their workload is by
paying less attention to such G-rated shows as ``Murder, She Wrote.''
   But even ``Designing Women,'' which often tackles sexual
subjects, has found the going easier of late, said Thomason, whose
wife, Linda Bloodworth-Thomason writes most of the scripts.
   Thomason said the show has had a good relationship with the
censors, but he nevertheless was surprised that the questionable
breast word was approved. The censor, after seeing the script,
wanted to ``reserve judgment.''
   ``A lot of times, if we disagree with them, we'll say, `Look, why
don't you let us shoot it and we'll shoot an alternative, and see
how it's used and how it looks in the context of the show,'''
Thomason said. ``Fortunately, I don't remember a time when we've
done that they didn't come back later and say, `OK, we see what you
were going for, and it's OK.'''

   The rapid rise in oil prices since OPEC agreed to
slash production six weeks ago has exceeded most people's
expections, but energy analysts aren't ready to declare the cartel's
accord a success.
   Prices of Middle East oil remain well below OPEC's target of $18
a barrel, and some recent gains may be lost if the excess oil
produced by the cartel late last year ever hits the market, analysts
said Wednesday.
   Since Nov. 28, when the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries announced it would curtail production, Middle Eastern
crude oil has risen more than $3 a barrel _ from approximately $11
to about $15.

   Six weeks after OPEC announced it would reduce
production, U.S. crude prices have risen by more than $3 a barrel.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange Wednesday, the February
contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S.
crude, continued to climb, picking up 45 cents to close at $18.14 a
barrel. Other contract months also rose.
   Analysts said a number of factors contributed to the day's gains,
including a sharp drop in crude oil supplies and signs that OPEC is
holding to its agreement to cut back production.
   The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed last
November to reduce output by 3 million barrels to 18.5 million
barrels a day. WTI prices have since climbed from the $15 range and
analysts expect strong demand to push prices even higher.
   The accord took effect Jan. 1 and continues for six months.
   Richard Redoglia, a broker with Merrill Lynch Energy Futures,
said higher prices have ``encouraged more people to come in and
buy.''
   Analysts said Wednesday's crude market also got a boost from
American Petroleum Institute statistics released Tuesday showing oil
stocks declined 5.5 million barrels last week to 328.86 million
barrels. The API report said gasoline supplies increased by 531,000
barrels to 229.1 million and heating oil stocks were up 726,000 to
127.5 million barrels.
   On the mercantile exchange, unleaded gasoline futures prices were
mostly higher Wednesday, influenced by a partial shutdown of
refinery operations in Mexico by striking union workers. The
February contract for gasoline closed 0.79 cent higher at 48.70 a
gallon.
   Heating oil futures ended the day mixed, with the February
contract down 0.17 cent at 53.69 cents a gallon.

   World crude prices have climbed by more than $3 a
barrel in the six weeks since OPEC agreed to cut its production, but
analysts remain skeptical that the accord will last.
   Prices of Middle East oil are still below OPEC's targeted price
of $18 a barrel, and some of the recent gains may still be lost if
the excess oil produced by the cartel late last year reaches the
market.
   Since Nov. 28, when the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries announced it would curtail production, Middle Eastern
crude oil has risen more than $3 a barrel _ from approximately $11
to about $15.
   West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark grade of crude oil,
has shot up to more than $18 a barrel from $15.03 the day the accord
was finalized.
   Most market observers had expected prices to rise but they had
forecast a more gradual increase with the excess oil keeping prices
soft for some time. Despite the recent increases, experts remain
doubtful about the future.
   ``I don't see $18 in the year for OPEC basket prices, at least
not for any sustained period. There is an overproduction that we
will still see the consequences of down the road, '' said John
Lichtblau, president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation.
   At the time of the OPEC agreement in November, the 13-member
cartel was producing approximately 22.5 million barrels of oil a
day. In December, that figure rose to about 23 million.
   For January, OPEC's production will be about 19 million barrels,
slightly above its new quota of 18.5 million. OPEC's accord took
effect Jan. 1 and extends for six months.
   Since it takes four to five weeks for most Middle East oil to
reach markets in the United States, analysts believed shiploads of
crude pumped late last year would be arriving on U.S. shores any day
now, driving prices lower. But they haven't, and the question many
are asking is: Where is it?
   ``I suppose some production could be in transit, but we were
hearing about surplus production as early as October and it hasn't
shown up in the statistics,'' said Gordon Pye, an economist with
Irving Trust Co. ``It calls into question the accuracy of the OPEC
figures we read about. ... Either that or it's being consumed more
rapidly than anyone thinks.''
   Nauman Barakat, vice president of energy investments for
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., believes a lot of the excess oil
is sitting in storage tanks somewhere in the Middle East.
   ``There was an intentional decision by the cartel to keep as much
of that crude as possible off the market so as not to flood the
market and force prices lower,'' Barakat said.
   Demand for OPEC oil in major oil-consuming countries like the
United States and Japan has been stronger than projected. A report
Wednesday from the International Energy Agency showed industrialized
countries consumed 38.4 million barrels a day of oil in the fourth
quarter, 1 million barrels or 4 percent more than previously
forecast. The report said U.S. consumption was up 4.5 percent while
Japanese consumption rose 6 percent.
   Nevertheless, many analysts believe high demand won't be enough
to boost or sustain prices for Middle East oil at the $18 level for
the length of the agreement. One OPEC country, the United Arab
Emirates, has already acknowledged it is producing above its quota.
   ``The question still is `Will OPEC stick to its quota beyond the
first quarter?''' said Lichtblau.

<HEAD>Warner Completes Merger with Lorimar</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Warner Communications Inc. solidified its
position as the leader in entertainment programming and beefed up
its role in television by completing its $1.2 billion merger with
Lorimar Telepictures Corp.
   The merger, which involves a stock swap valued at about $635
million and Warner's assumption of about $600 million in Lorimar
debt, was concluded Wednesday, the two entertainment concerns said.
   The companies had agreed to a merger last May, but the completion
of the deal was delayed because of legal complications arising from
Lorimar's ownership of several television stations.
   Lorimar subsequently disposed of its television stations,
completing the sale of the last of them, WPGH in Pittsburgh, on
Tuesday.
   In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Warner rose 37{ cents
a share to close at $37.50.
   Under terms of the merger agreement, Warner said Lorimar has
become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Warner and each share of Lorimar
stock has been converted into the right to receive .3675 of a share
on Warner stock.
   With about 46 million shares of common stock outstanding, the
Lorimar stock could be converted into about 17 million shares of
Warner stock, worth about $635 million at current prices.
   In addition, Warner would assume Lorimar's debt of about $600
million, boosting the value of the transaction to about $1.2 billion.
   Warner also reaffirmed its plans to elect Merv Adelson, chairman
and chief executive of Lorimar, as vice chairman and a member of
Warner's board. The election will probably come at the next Warner
board meeting in February.
   Lorimar, based in Culver City, Calif., is a leading producer and
distributor of television programming.
   A spokeswoman for Lorimar, Barbara Brogliatti, said Lorimar
currently supplies nine shows and seven hours a week of programming
carried on the major television networks, including ``Dallas,''
``Knots Landing'' and Alf.''
   She said it supplies an additional 13 shows and 25 hours a week
of first-run syndicated programming to local stations, including
``People's Court,'' ``Love Connection'' and ``Freddy's Nightmares.''
   Warner currently has six shows on network television, including
``Night Court'' and ``Growing Pains,'' and spokesman Geoffrey Holmes
said the combined total of 15 network shows outdistances production
by any other studio.
   Holmes said Warner already was the leader in entertainment
programming, which he defined as movies, television shows and
recorded music and publishing.
   He said the merger will boost its revenue from such programming
by $600 million a year to $4 billion, or about $1 billion more than
the second biggest entertainment programmer, Walt Disney Co.
   Lorimar has lost more than $380 million in the last 2{ years, but
Warner executives have said they expect Lorimar's performance will
improve as some of its more popular first-run shows are sold in
syndication.
   Warner, based in New York, is a leading producer and distributor
of movies, television shows and recorded music and has interests in
cable operations.
   For the first nine months of 1988, Warner earned $322 million, or
$2.02 a share, on revenue of $3.01 billion.
   The stumbling block that had held up completion of the merger
stemmed from a 1984 agreement that Warner and its biggest
stockholder, Chris-Craft Industries Inc., reached when they bought
stakes in one another.
   As Chris-Craft bought its stake in Warner, Warner bought a 42.5
percent interest in Chris-Craft's BHC Inc. broadcasting unit.
   Chris-Craft sued to block the Lorimar deal last summer, saying
the 1984 agreement prohibited Warner from owning television stations
as long as it owned 25 percent or more of BHC.
   A state court judge in New York blocked the planned merger in
late September. Lorimar subsequently agreed to sell its television
stations, completing the sale of its interest in two stations in
Puerto Rico in late December and the sale of the Pittsburgh station
late Tuesday.

<HEAD>Household's Investors Big Winners As Firm Exits Manufacturing</HEAD>

   Household International Inc.'s exit
from the manufacturing arena is a boon to the firm's shareholders,
who will receive stock in three new companies free of charge while
retaining their shares in the streamlined company.
   Household International said Wednesday it was dissolving its $1
billion manufacturing group, ending four years of restructuring
efforts, and would concentrate solely on financial services.
   The company said it would spin off three manufacturing units to
shareholders and sell six other businesses, including Thermos Co.
   ``It's a pleasant surprise to see a company doing something
right,'' said Rudolph Martin, an analyst who follows Household for
Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   Martin called Household's announcement ``an illustration of their
integrity.''
   ``They realize they can increase shareholder value by spinning
off these operations,'' he said.
   Analysts said the value of Household's stock may decline
slightly, but the value of shareholders' new stock should more than
make up the difference.
   The three independent companies to be created are Eljer
Industries Inc., a building products company with anticipated 1988
sales of more than $400 million; Schwitzer Inc., a maker of engine
parts with anticipated 1988 sales of $140 million; and Scotsman
Industries Inc., a manufacturer of commercial refrigeration products
with anticipated 1988 sales of $175 million.
   The firm will be left with four financial-services operations:
Household Finance Corp., the Household Bank; Household Commercial
Finance and the Alexander Hamilton Life Insurance Co.
   Household's stock price surged $5.25 Wednesday on the New York
Stock Exchange in reaction to the announcement, closing at $62.37{.
   Martin estimated the combined potential value of the surviving
company and the three spinoffs at $72 a share _ $58 for Household's
financial-services operations and $14 for the spinoffs.
   Household said it was considering a tax-free distribution of one
new share in each of the three spinoffs for every five shares of
Household's common stock on or about April 15.
   Household said it would use the proceeds from the transactions to
reduce its $500 million debt by about $255 million and pump about
$95 million into its financial services businesses.
   ``The actions represent a logical next step to several years of
restructuring in a continuing effort to maximize shareholder
value,'' Chairman Donald C. Clark said in a statement.
   The units to be sold are: Thermos, the well-known maker of
insulated products for storing and serving food; GC-Thorsen, a
marketer of entertainment accessories and hand tools; Albion
Industries, a leading manufacturer of heavy duty casters;
King-Sealey, a major supplier of cooking-appliance controls; Omni
Products International, a furniture maker; and WaterTest Corp., a
provider of water-testing services for consumer and commercial
markets.
   Household, which is based in Prospect Heights northwest of
Chicago, said it expected to receive ``well in excess'' of $120
million for the six units.
   Analysts said Household's departure from manufacturing was not
surprising, considering the company's sale of its Household
Merchandising subsidiary in 1985 and of National Car Rental a year
later.
   Frederick Wightman, vice president of research with Duff &amp; Phelps
Inc. in Chicago, said investors perceived manufacturing as having a
``cyclical influence'' on Household's stock price. He said the
company may be able to attract more investors by focusing on
financial services, which are considered to be more stable.
   Household said it expected 1988 sales from its manufacturing
division to exceed $1 billion.
   The company reported overall 1987 profit of $221.5 million on
sales of $3.4 billion.
   Household said it could not provide an overall figure for 1988
sales and profits, but that it expected a 20 percent increase in
per-share earnings for the year.

<HEAD>Mexico's Government Petroleum Monopoly At A Glance</HEAD>
<BYLINE>With PM-Mexico-Union ^By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Here is a look at Mexico's government petroleum monopoly
Petroleos Mexicanos S.A., better known as Pemex, and the Oil Workers
Union:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE COMPANY: Pemex is one of the biggest oil companies in the
world, accounts for nearly half the government's revenues and is
intimately identified with the governing Institutional Revolutionary
Party.
   It was created in 1938 after President Lazaro Cardenas
nationalized foreign oil firms on March 18 of that year.
   It is not a member of the oil cartel OPEC but tends to follow the
pricing policies of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ASSETS: By law, Pemex has a complete monopoly over the
exploration and production of all hydrocarbons in Mexico, as well as
refining and the production of 36 ``basic'' petrochemicals. It
controls every aspect of the petroleum industry except for service
stations, which are private.
   Pemex claims assets of $31 billion, including nine refineries and
a score of petrochemical plants, as well as oil tankers, offshore
drilling rigs, one of the tallest buildings in the country and over
32,000 miles of pipelines.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   PRODUCTION: Pemex is the world's sixth-largest producer of oil
and the fifth-largest producer of petrochemicals.
   Crude oil production is about 2.8 million barrels per day. Mexico
is exporting about 1.36 million barrels a day, or about 40 percent
of its oil, to 50 nations around the world. About half of the
exports go to the United States.
   Pemex supplies 90 percent of Mexico's energy needs.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE UNION: The Oil Workers Union controls more than half the
lucrative drilling contracts let by Pemex and 95 percent of its
jobs. Pemex has about 180,000 employees and is considered
overstaffed by industry experts.
   Pemex workers are some of the highest paid in Mexico and enjoy
some of the best fringe benefits. Jobs can be inherited and are
sometimes sold under the table.

<HEAD>Procter &amp; Gamble Announces New Stock Plan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Procter &amp; Gamble Co. will have a tougher shield
against hostile takeovers under a new employee stock ownership plan
that goes into effect this summer, analysts say.
   ``They see what's happening around them. They'd rather be safe
than sorry,'' Jerome Ballan, an analyst with Fahnestock &amp; Co, said,
referring to a recent spate of large takeovers.
   ``It's no more than a sign of the times.''
   While the stock plan will provide new insulation against possible
takeovers by giving employees a larger stake in the company, Proctor
&amp; Gamble officials said they had other intentions.
   The company said Wednesday that the ESOP is intended to enhance
the value of its stock and provide greater retirement security to
employees by improving profit sharing plans.
   A trust created for the new plan will borrow up to $1 billion for
a period of 15 years, with Procter &amp; Gamble guaranteeing the loan.
The loan's proceeds will be used to buy a new issue of convertible
preferred stock from the company, officials said.
   Pricing, terms and conditions on the preferred stock are to be
announced later, officials said.
   The ESOP goes into effect July 1, the company said.
   The company said its board of directors authorized Procter &amp;
Gamble to use proceeds from issuance of the convertible preferred
stock to repurchase up to 12 million shares of its common stock.
   This adds 2 million shares to the company's previously announced
10 million-share repurchase program adopted in October 1987.
   About 1 million shares have been repurchased to date, the company
said.

<HEAD>U.S. Airlines Have Three Days To Check 737s Following British Crash</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: INSERTS grafs 8-10, This could ..., with Boeing comment. A version
moving on general news wires.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   U.S. airlines have three days to check for
cross-wiring in 300 Boeing 737s, following speculation that faulty
warnings deceived the pilot of a British 737 into shutting down his
only good engine when the other one caught fire.
   ``We think this is not a very likely scenario, but it's a check
that can be done very, very quickly without disrupting service,''
said Federal Aviation Administration spokesman John Leyden.
   The FAA order late Wednesday applies to eight Piedmont Airlines
737-400s with U.S.-French CFM56 engines similar to the British
Midland Airways 737 that crashed Sunday in England, killing 44
people. It also would cover 292 smaller Boeing 737-300s operated by
10 U.S. airlines.
   No planes were grounded by the order, and other 737s and other
planes using the CFM56 engines would not be affected.
   FAA Administrator Allan McArtor issued the order after the
British Civil Aviation Authority ordered similar checks for three
types of aircraft flown by British carriers, including the same two
models of the 737 and the Airbus A320.
   The British agency also ordered increased inspections of CFM56
engines on the planes, a step the FAA was still considering, said a
spokesman.
   The FAA's ``air worthiness directive'' gives airlines 72 hours
from official receipt of the warnings this morning to make the
inspections, which officials said would take about an hour for each
plane.
   This could allow each plane to make one or two flights before the
inspection was mandatory, and officials said it should not disrupt
airline schedules.
   ``We certainly believe it's a prudent measure to go out and check
to make sure there's nothing wrong with the fleet,'' Boeing
Commercial Airplanes spokesman Craig Martin said Wednesday in
Seattle. ``But certainly this precautionary measure does not imply
there has been any cause identified'' for the crash.
   Martin said he was not aware of any previous incorrect wiring
problems in 737s. He said there was one instance of improper
instruments connections on a 747 jumbo jet, but the airline
discovered the problem and repaired it without any mishap.
   As a precaution, Boeing also is checking its procedures for
testing 737 wiring, Martin said, ``just to verify they're doing what
we expect them to be doing.''
   British officials said Wednesday it was too early to conclude
what caused the crash and they were still examining the possibility
that both engines failed. A statement from the British Transport
Department said, however, that the airliner's left engine caught
fire and the right engine was shut down, and that pilot Kevin Hunt
had told ground control the fire was in the right engine.
   This led to the speculation that crossed wires might have caused
warning lights to mislead Hunt into shutting down the right instead
of the left engine. He could not see the engines from the cockpit.
Hunt, who was injured in the crash, was interviewed by investigators
Wednesday, but they did not disclose what he told them.
   Fred Farrar, another FAA spokesman, said airlines flying the
737-300s are Aloha, America West, American, Continental, Delta,
Orion, Piedmont, Southwest, United and U.S. Air. Piedmont is the
only airlines using 737-400s with the CFM56 engines.
   The U.S. inspections will cover fire warning systems and
vibration monitoring circuitry in the aircraft, Farrar said.
   He said there have been ``very, very isolated incidents'' of
cross-wiring of warning systems in U.S. aircraft but none has led to
an accident.
   John Mazor, spokesman for the Air Line Pilots Association, said
he could not recall a specific incident of cross-wiring, but added,
``It is not unheard of for brand new aircraft to come off the
assembly line with wires crossed or systems improperly configured.''

   The stock market was little changed today,
pausing to test the winds at its highest levels since the 1987 crash.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials slipped .36 to 2,206.07
in the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 7 to 5 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 509 up, 356 down and
541 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 23.10 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Analysts said traders were encouraged by the market's drive
Wednesday past the 2,200 level in the Dow after a week-long
struggle. But they said traders were still faced with some
unanswered questions.
   The market's steady advance since last fall has come without any
support from interest rates, which have been rising.
   The Federal Reserve has continued to tighten credit, and many
Wall Streeters still believe the Fed might soon raise its discount
rate.
   Among actively traded blue chips, Merck rose { to 59|;
International Business Machines added [ to 122]; Exxon gained [ to
44|, and American Telephone &amp; Telegraph was unchanged at 28~.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.09 to 158.74. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up .50 at 314.36.
   On Wednesday the Dow Jones industrial average climbed 13.22 to
2,206.43, its highest close since it stood at 2,246.74 on Oct. 16,
1987.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 4 to 3 on the
NYSE, with 802 up, 603 down and 534 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 148.95 million shares, against 140.42
million in the previous session.

<TEXT>
   The troubled small-appliance maker Allegheny
International Inc. said today it asked the federal bankruptcy court
to void a previously announced buyout plan by former ally Donaldson,
Lufkin &amp; Jenrette.
   The company, which has been operating under Chapter 11 federal
bankruptcy protection for nearly a year, advised the court that
instead it will submit its own reorganization plan.
   Allegheny International's board of directors voted to take such
action late Wednesday, citing the securities firm's deal with other
investors to carve up the consumer products company.
   The board's move, though, angered many of its creditors, who had
backed the Donaldson Lufkin plan.
   ``We're amazed and disappointed that the board, having postponed
a decision from November to December and then from December to
January has now rejected the sale route altogether,'' said Wilbur
Ross of Rothschild Inc., adviser to a committee of unsecured
creditors.
   Peter A. Joseph, a partner in the Paul S. Levy merchant banking
group in New York, which would have participated in the Donaldson
Lufkin takeover plan, also expressed disappointment.
   ``We were surprised, we're disappointed and we're examining our
options,'' he said.
   In a privately negotiated deal, the total value of which has not
been disclosed, the Levy group would have bought Allegheny
International's profitable lawn furniture and gas grill business for
about $250 million, according to published reports.
   The two groups were once competing bidders.
   The New York Times reported today that besides being taken back
by the new alignment, Allegheny International directors were upset
by a decision by Donaldson Lufkin to put $30 million less common
equity into the deal than it had earlier proposed.
   The board had announced a tentative merger agreement with
Donaldson Lufkin at the end of last year.

   FBI and Pentagon investigators are reviewing
admissions by General Electric that test records may have been
falsified at a factory that made parts for military and commercial
aircraft, according to court documents and federal officials.
   The investigation centers on a check and drain valve for the F404
engine that powers the Navy's FA-18 fighter, GE spokesman Richard
Kennedy said Wednesday.
   The GE factory in question also makes an engine part used by the
type of Boeing aircraft that crashed Sunday in Britain, killing 44
people, but federal and company officials said the part could not
have caused the accident. The federal investigation began last year
and has no connection with the accident in England.
   GE spokesman Richard Kennedy said Wednesday that the factory made
a timer valve for the CFM56 engine used by the Boeing 737-400 as
well as a check and drain valve for the F404 engine aboard the
Navy's FA-18 fighter.
   Another GE employee, attorney Robert C. Anderson, said in a
letter last year that test records may have been falsified for
valves used on the FA-18 in 1984-87.
   According to newly revealed court papers in Cincinnati, the FBI
has become involved in the investigation.
   British investigators looking into the crash of the 737-400 said
the airplane's left engine caught fire and the right engine was shut
down. The CFM56 engine for the 737-400 is made jointly by General
Electric Co. and a French company, SNECMA.
   The timer valve manufactured by GE for the CFM56 engine on the
737 could not have caused the turbine to fail or threatened flight
safety even if the valve malfunctioned, Kennedy said in telephone
interview from his office in Cincinnati, where GE's aircraft engine
operations are based.
   FAA spokesman Fred Farrar said Tuesday the timer assembly could
not have caused the British Midland crash. He said its failure would
only cause a small increase in engine temperature but not a fire.
   Navy spokeswoman Lt. Nettie Johnson was unable to say immediately
whether the aircraft had experienced problems from faulty check and
drain valves.
   Anderson, the GE attorney, said in a letter dated June 2, 1988,
that: ``In late May 1988, it was discovered that prior to July 1987,
a particular flow leak check, which is required by GEAE (General
Electric Aircraft Engine) specifications, was not performed on the
F404 check and drain valves.''
   ``It is believed that the test was discontinued sometime in 1983,
possibly as a result of the test fixture becoming broken,'' Anderson
said the letter, obtained by The Associated Press.
   ``The test was reinstituted in July 1987 when the problem was
detected by lower level personnel in the plant,'' the letter said.
   ``During the period involved, it is also believed that operators
may have falsified internal test records which are maintained to
reflect actual test readings,'' Anderson said in the letter.
   Anderson's letter does not indicate the total number of engines
or their value, but said that the deliveries covered the periods of
April-May 1984, April-May 1985, April-May 1986, and April-May 1987.
   Defense Department officials said they had received Anderson's
letter as part of what they called a ``voluntary disclosure
program'' for companies that believe they have not met the terms of
their contracts.
   The inspector general's office in the Pentagon, in conjunction
with the FBI, is investigating the admissions in the letter, said
the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   James Helmer, an attorney representing the former manager of the
GE plant, said his client had been questioned in connection with the
investigation last Oct. 14 by two FBI agents and a representative of
the Air Force.
   Helmer's client, Anthony L. Divencenzo, filed suit against
General Electric last year on behalf of the government, seeking to
recover damages for more than 2,000 F404 engines that Helmer said
were delivered without inspection.
   At the request of the Justice Department, all documents in the
Divencenzo suit remained under seal until last Friday, when U.S.
District Court Judge Carl Rubin denied a federal motion to allow the
Justice Department until Feb. 1 to decide whether to join the case
as a plaintiff.
   The motion cited the ``factual complexities of the case.''

   Stock prices pushed ahead today, extending the
early-1989 rally that has carried the market to its highest levels
since the 1987 crash.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 13.21 to 2,219.64
by 11 a.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 8 to 5 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 741 up, 438 down and

   Volume on the Big Board came to 58.06 million shares at
midmorning.
   Analysts said traders were encouraged by the market's drive
Wednesday past the 2,200 level in the Dow after a week-long struggle.
   In addition, they cited a developing ``bandwagon'' effect as

<HEAD>Grain, Soybean Futures Slide In Early Trading</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices were mostly lower
in early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade in quiet
activity ahead of Friday's crop report from the Agriculture
Department.
   The report will contain final 1988 crop production totals, with
slight increases over the government's previous estimates expected
for both corn and soybeans.
   The report, which is due out after the close of trading on
Friday, also will contain new estimates of the nation's grain and
soybean stockpiles, an actual tally of 1988-89 winter wheat seedings
and estimates for 1989 corn and soybean acreage.
   In addition to bearish expectations for the report, analysts said
some of this morning's selling was prompted by indications of strong
farmer sales of grains and soybeans to commercial dealers during
December.
   ``Especially considering the good movement after the first of the
year, the commercials don't have to reach for anything in here at
all,'' said Dale Gustafson, an analyst in Chicago with Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc.
   In early trading, wheat was 4 cents to 5 cents lower with the
contract for delivery in March at $4.39{ a bushel; corn was \ cent
to 2 cents lower with March at $2.84} a bushel; oats were } cent to
1{ cents lower with March at $2.35{ a bushel; soybeans were 2\ cents

   Livestock and meat futures were mostly higher in early trading on
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .08 cent to .25 cent higher with February at 74

January at 85 cents a pound; live hogs were .07 cent lower to .10

<TEXT>
   Farley Inc. today extended its $1.4 billion
unsolicited offer for textile giant West Point-Pepperell Inc. for
the seventh time, moving the deadline back another week.
   Pepperell is fighting the $48-per-share offer, first made Oct.
25, with various takeover defenses, several of which have been
struck down by a federal judge.
   The deadline, which was Wednesday at midnight, was extended
exactly a week to this coming Wednesday at midnight.
   On Wednesday, Pepperell attorneys were at the 11th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals, asking judges there to reinstate ``poison pill''
provisions that had been thrown out by a lower court.
   In addition, Farley representatives were negotiating Wednesday
with the Georgia Secretary of State's office to answer concerns
raised about the deal's financing.
   Also, a federal judge received a written report from a
court-appointed expert on Farley's challenge of Georgia's
anti-takeover law.
   The ``poison pill,'' ruled illegal in November by U.S. District
Judge G. Ernest Tidwell, would become effective after a shareholder
had acquired 10 percent of the outstanding stock. Under its
provisions, all but the large shareholder could then purchase more
stock at a deep discount.
   Farley, manufacturer of Fruit of the Loom underwear and Acme
boots, owns 9.8 percent, or 2.9 million shares, of Pepperell stock.
Today, the company said approximately 14 million shares had been
tendered, which would give the Chicago-based conglomerate control of
about 57 percent of Pepperell shares, well short of the two-thirds
requirement on which the offer is contingent.
   Pepperell told the appeals court that Tidwell was incorrect when
he ruled that Pepperell had no legal standing to question the amount
of debt contained in Farley's offer and that Farley's financial
adviser, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., was not bound by an agreement
barring disclosure of confidential information obtained during
Pepperell's acquisition of J.P. Stevens &amp; Co. Inc. last year.
   Farley attorney Stephen Greiner contended during Wednesday's
90-minute hearing that the pill ``is a device by which the board of
directors of West Point says nobody can buy more than 10 percent.''
   Drexel attorney Lawrence Silverman said the investment firm was
not bound by the standstill agreement between Odyssey Partners,
which Drexel advised, and J.P. Stevens. Pepperell became the
nation's largest publicly held textile company through a joint deal
with Odyssey Partners to acquire Stevens.
   In any case, Silverman said Drexel had divulged no confidential
information to Farley.
   The judges gave no indication of when they would rule.
   Outside the courtroom, Farley's Greiner said he did not know what
negotiations were going on between Farley and Cleland, who last
Friday ordered the company ``to provide assurance ... that the
shareholders of West Point will be fully informed as to the risks
associated with both accepting and rejecting the Farley tender
offer.''
   Meanwhile, a court-appointed expert had turned in his findings to
Tidwell, who still must rule on Farley's claims that Georgia's
anti-takeover law _ which severely restricts mergers after takeovers
_ is unconstitutional.
   Tidwell's ruling is expected later this week.
   Pepperell, based in West Point, Ga., manufactures Martex towels
and Arrow shirts and has about a quarter of the nation's home
fashion textile market.
   On Wednesday, the company also announced that its earnings for
its first fiscal quarter ended Dec. 24 fell 45.7 percent to $10.8
million, or 37 cents a share, from $19.9 million, or 64 cents a
share a year ago.
   The drop was blamed on $17 million in special charges, including
$3 million incurred in fighting Farley.
   Its first-quarter revenue rose 42 percent to $683.1 million from
$481 million a year earlier. The latest figures included sales from
Stevens.

<HEAD>Six CBOT Members Suspended in Wig Trading Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Chicago Board of Trade has fined and suspended
six men linked to a scheme in which a trader donned a wig and used
fake identification to access privileged information, CBOT officials
said today.
   The six CBOT members were fined between $5,000 and $50,000 each
and suspended for periods ranging from 15 days to 10 years.
   The CBOT's disciplinary bodies found all six engaged in what they
called ``fraud and dishonorable and dishonest conduct'' and
``reckless and unbusinesslike dealings inconsistent with just and
equitable principles of trade.''
   None of the six could be reached today for comment.
   The traders were linked through federal court testimony last
summer to the wig scheme masterminded by veteran trader Thompson B.
Sanders. Sanders was sentenced last November to six years in prison.
   The disciplinary moves by the board, imposed Dec. 16 but
announced this week, followed revelations by prosecutors in the
Sanders probe.
   Sanders, 45, was found guilty of engineering the scheme in which
Daniel Dewey, another former CBOT trader, donned a wig and used
stolen trader badges and jackets to gain access to a restricted area
in proximity to the Treasury bond trading pit.
   The government claimed that because of the disguises, Sanders,
Dewey and others in the scheme were able to claim $30,000 in trading
profits without detection. Dewey was sentenced to five years in
prison.
   The six suspended traders were identified as David Schremser, Dan
Hayes, Patrick Bratta, Scott Bremner, Patrick Sutor and Robert
Kinkade. Schremser and Hayes testified under grants of immunity from
prosecution at Sanders' trial, the CBOT said.
   The CBOT board of governors imposed a 10-year suspension on
Bremner, fined him $50,000 and barred him from associating with
other members of the exchange during the suspension.
   Bretta was suspended for four years and fined $25,000. Hayes was
suspended for two years, Sutor was suspended for six months and
fined $10,000.
   Kinkade was suspended for four months and fined $10,000 and
Schremser was suspended for 15 days and fined $5,000.
   U.S. Attorney Anton Valukas said the investigation into corrupt
trading practices is still continuing.

   The chief of Mexico's powerful oil workers
union was arraigned today on charges of illegal weapons possession,
homicide, gun smuggling and resisting arrest.
   The arrest Tuesday of Joaquin Hernandez Galicia prompted strikes
by union members that crippled the country's nationalized oil
industry for a day but ended Wednesday at a behest of a union
official.
   Hernandez Galicia was charged today before penal judge Jose Luis
Garcia Vasco, who has 72 hours to decide whether the accused should
be released on bail.
   On Wednesday night, Hernanadez Galicia claimed the 200 Uzi
machine guns seized in an assault on his home were smuggled from the
United States and needed by union leaders for self-defense,
officials said.
   At least 50 associates of the union boss arrested with him
Tuesday face charges of fraud, weapons and tax evasion, said
Fernando Arias Perez, a spokesman for the attorney general's office.
   A source in the office, who spoke on condition of anonymity, also
said that two of Hernandez Galicia's bodyguards on Wednesday accused
their boss of ordering the 1983 slaying of a mayor who headed a
union local.
   Tensions have long run high between Hernandez Galicia and newly
inaugurated President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, who has pledged to
sell or close unprofitable or non-strategic state industries.
   Hernandez Galicia's allegedly corrupt Mexican Oil Workers Union
controls more than half the lucrative drilling contracts issued by
the state oil monopoly, Pemex.
   Pemex Director Francisco Rojas told a news conference Wednesday
that the production of crude oil, gasoline and petrochemicals had
returned to normal.
   ``We are fulfilling all our exportation commitments to other
countries,'' he said. Mexico is the world's sixth-largest crude oil
producer, and production from the country's nine refineries amounts
to 1.4 million barrels a day.
   Victor de Leon, acting coordinator of the union, said the
back-to-work appeal had come from Salvador Barragan Camacho, the
union's secretary-general until Wednesday.
   The government news agency Notimex reported later that leaders of
the union's locals had designated Ricardo Camero Cardiel, a local
leader and senator from the northeastern city of Ciudad Madero, the
union's new secretary-general. Weapons were found at Barragan
Camacho's home and he was under arrest, officials said.
   Hernandez Galicia told investigators the Uzis and about 30,000
cartridges were secretly delivered to him on Dec. 10 by former
Reynosa Mayor Jose Cruz Contreras, the attorney general's office
said in a statement.
   Hernandez Galicia said the arms were ``to defend his union
members, given the existing situation in the country,'' the
statement said.
   The government has not said what it thinks Hernandez Galicia
planned to do with the weapons.
   Last week, the union chief threatened to paralyze the oil
industry if the government carried out a threat to sell Pemex
operations to private investors.
   Hernandez Galicia was arrested when soldiers blew down his door
with a bazooka in a raid on his Ciudad Madero home. A federal agent
was shot to death in the attack.
   A spokesman for the attorney general's office, Felipe Flores,
said a paraffin test performed on Hernandez Galicia showed he had
fired a gun. Flores did not elaborate.
   In his statement to investigators, Hernandez Galicia argued that
security forces had no right to force their way into his home.
   He said he had planned to distribute some of the Uzis to other
oil union leaders and said Cruz Contreras, whom he described as a
``good friend,'' did not charge him for the weapons and ammunition,
the attorney general's office said. It did not say where in the
United States the arms were bought.

<TEXT>
   International Paper Co., which posted a
record 85 percent increase in 1988 profit, announced Thursday it
plans to launch a takeover bid for Europe's largest paper maker.
   Details of the ``friendly'' tender offer for Aussedat-Rey SA,
Europe's leading manufacturer of photocopy paper, were not
disclosed. But Paris stock analysts estimated the bid at 650 to 700
French francs per share _ the equivalent of $104 to $113 based on
Thursday's exchange rates.
   Officials of the Paris-based company declined to comment on
whether the company would accept the offer.
   International Paper spokeswoman Ann Silvernail said that under
French law the company was barred from releasing details pending
government approval.
   International Paper is the world's largest manufacturer of paper
and paper products, with primary production facilities in Maine and
throughout the South and packaging plants in Europe, Asia and South
America. In addition to all types of business paper, the company
makes milk cartons, bottle labels and corrugated boxes. It does not
make newsprint.
   International Paper announced earlier this week that preliminary
figures show its earnings soared last year, due to strong demand and
high operating capacity.
   For the 12 months ended last Dec. 31, International Paper said
its net income totaled $754 million, or $6.57 a share, up from $407
million, or $3.68 a share, in 1987. The company's annual revenue
rose 22 percent to $9.5 billion from $7.8 billion in 1987.
   The company reported that its fourth-quarter net earnings jumped
65 percent to $206 million, or $1.81 a share, on sales of $2.5
billion. In the year-earlier quarter the company reported earnings
of $125 million, or $1.14 a share, on sales of $2 billion.
   ``Our white paper, market pulp and packaging businesses turned in
particularly impressive results in 1988,'' said John A. Georges,
International Paper's chairman and chief executive officer.
   Georges said that for the second year in a row, the company's
paper and paperboard mills operated at or near capacity.
   ``This strong level of demand led to higher prices on most of our
major product lines and we compounded the benefits by continuing to
emphasize cost reduction, customer service and quality,'' he said.
   Georges said the company planned to invest $900 million in 1989
to further modernize its facilities and would continue to search for
new investment opportunities.

<TEXT>
   Major commercial banks say they should receive
loan guarantees from governments or agencies like the World Bank
before they lend out any more money to debt-ridden Third World
countries.
   ``Creditor countries risk that some of these debtor countries
will default on their debt,'' explained Horst Schulmann, the West
German managing director of the Institute of International Finance.
``If this happens ... the banks of the creditor countries will
suffer heavy losses.''
   The institute, which represents 186 leading banks and other
private lenders around the world, issued a position paper on
Wednesday apparently aimed at influencing the Bush administration's
views on Third World debt.
   The paper said, ``There is a case for creditor governments and
the international financial institutions to provide assistance
possibly through guarantees of principal and interest.''
   Former Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III, the choice of
President-elect Bush to become secretary of state, has strongly
opposed official guarantees because they transfer to taxpayers the
risks taken by private lenders.
   The World Bank, which is owned by 151 governments, estimates that
Third World countries now owe $1.3 trillion, more than $540 billion
of it to private lenders.

<HEAD>Chemical Reports Jump In 4th Qtr Profit, Record Annual Income</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Chemical Banking Corp., one of the nation's largest banking
companies, on Thursday reported a 26 percent jump in its
fourth-quarter profit and record earnings for 1988.
   The company attributed those gains partly to a decrease in its
provision for future loan losses from Third World countries and
past-due interest payments from Brazil.
   Net income for the three months ended Dec. 31 totaled $288.5
million, or $4.66 a share, up from $229.6 million, or $3.83 a share,
the same time a year earlier.
   The 1987 quarterly earnings included a $126.4 million pre-tax
gain on a pension settlement and $25.6 million from the sale of
Chemical's factoring business.
   For the year, Chemical's profit totaled a record $753.6 million,
or $12.02 a share, compared with a year-earlier loss of $853.7
million.
   The 1988 figures included pre-tax gains of $53.8 million on the
settlement of a portion of its pension obligations and $41.3 million
on the sale or closure of non-strategic businesses and the receipt
of about $161 million in past-due interest from Brazil from Feb. 20,
1987 to Sept. 30, 1988.
   The 1987 earnings reflected the company's decision to add nearly
$1.5 billion to its loan-loss provision at the peak of the Third
World debt crisis. During that year Brazil had placed a moratorium
on interest payments to commercial banks.
   In 1988, Chemical added around $364 million to its loan-loss
provision, including $81 million in the final quarter. The 1987
fourth-quarter provision was $108 million.
   Chemical said fourth-quarter operating earnings reflected
increases in corporate finance fees, earnings from equity affiliates
and declines in non-interest expense, as well as the smaller
loan-loss provision.
   It said a drop in net interest income, bond trading and
foreign-exchange profits helped partially offset those gains.
   The huge profit for 1988 was largely attributed to an increase in
net interest income, corporate finance fees, profits from bond
trading and the lower loan-loss provision.
   The 1988 results also included full-year earnings from Texas
Commerce Bancshares Inc., which merged with Chemical in May 1987.
Texas Commerce earned $2.1 million last year, compared with a $120.3
million loss in 1987, Chemical said.

   The maker of Minox miniature
cameras, the ``spy cameras'' made famous in an early James Bond

and cut its workforce by 50 percent in a struggle to stay in the

   Minox's woes are just part of the restructuring of West Germany's

companies, Leica and Rollei, drop out of the amateur automatic focus
camera market to concentrate on producing high-priced professional
gear.
   Minox, which continues to pursue the amateur photographer market
in tough competition with Japan's producers, is based in the central
West German town of Heuchelheim near Giessen, about 40 miles north
of Frankfurt.
   The so-called ``spy camera'' used in the 1963 James Bond movie
``From Russia With Love'' can be concealed in the palm or easily
slipped into a normal pocket. A newer version, the Minox EC, is even
smaller, about as long and thick as a normal index finger, and not
more that two-fingers wide.
   Ludwig Rinn, who died in 1942, invented the tiny camera in 1938
in Riga, Latvia, in what is now the Soviet Union. His descendants
founded the Minox company in Heuchelheim on Jan. 3, 1949.
   Exactly 40 years later, Minox filed for bankruptcy-court
protection and a court-appointed executive entrusted with running
the company cut 220 of its 564 employees. The reduction followed a
cut of 186 employees last April.
   ``This is really hurting Heuchelheim,'' the town's mayor Willi
Marx told The Associated Press in an interview at his office earlier
this month.
   ``Not only the jobs, but also the taxes. We may have to reduce
some town services,'' the mayor said. The town has a population of
7,500.
   Loss of the jobs also means small businesses in Heuchelheim will
lose the customers who used to go shopping there after work, Marx
said.
   ``But I guess the worst part is the months of uncertainty that
the families have gone through for the past months. Some have spent
their whole lives at Minox, others had grandfathers and fathers who
also worked there,'' he said.
   Minox has not shown a profit since 1981, and on April 1, 1988,
Robert C. Corduwener, a Netherlands businessman bought a 51 percent
share of the company to take control from the Rinn family.
   Corduwener immediately cut the workforce to streamline the
operation, but even with $40 million in sales in 1988, the company
lost $3.4 million for the year. Its debts swelled to $25.7 million.
   Despite forecasts that business was rebounding with three months
of orders to fill on its new 35 GT-E and 35 AF (Automatic Focus)
cameras, the company's applications for short-term bank loans were
rejected.
   Employees took out private loans to tide them over during
November and December because Minox had no money for salaries. They
worked extra shifts to fill contract obligations and keep the firm
in operation, mayor Marx said.
   Many had hoped their loyality would convince the banks, primarily
the Frankfurt-based Commerzbank and Giessen's Bezirksparkasse bank,
to continue to help Minox, but the hope backfired on those who were
layed off, he said.
   While Minox is struggling, the Leica company in nearby Wetzlar,
and Rollei in Braunschweig, report business has been good over the
past year.
   Leica spokesman Hans Guenther von Zydowitz told the AP company
officals estimate last year's sales at about $60.6 million, but he
declined to estimate profits.
   Spokesman Dietmar Kanzer of the smaller Rollei company, which
employs about 270 people, told the AP the firm had great success
with its new Roliflex 6008 camera in 1988. He estimated 1988 sales
at $20 million but also declined to estimate profits.

   Grain and soybean futures prices finished mixed
Thursday on the Chicago Board of Trade as traders adjusted their
positions ahead of Friday's crop report from the Agriculture
Department.
   Wheat futures finished mostly lower for the third consecutive
session amid jitters about an expected increase over last year in
winter wheat plantings. The figure is the most eagerly awaited
statistic in the USDA report, and analysts' estimates have varied
widely.
   ``It could be something that could break the back of the
market,'' said Ted Mao, an analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
in New York.
   ``Everbody expects an increase; the question is what the
magnitude of the increase is,'' Mao said. ``It could be a lot higher
than people expect.''
   The crop report, due out after Friday's close of trading, also
will contain the USDA's final 1988 crop production totals, new
estimates of the nation's grain and soybean stockpiles and estimates
for 1989 corn and soybean acreage.
   At the close, wheat was 3{ cents lower to 1 cent higher with the
contract for delivery in March at $4.41 a bushel; corn was } cent
lower to 1\ cents higher with March at $2.86 a bushel; oats were {

<TEXT>
   The government expects to virtually end
coal exports by the year 2000 because of rising domestic demand and
increasing costs of extraction, Industry Minister Mieczyslaw Wilczek
said Wednesday.
   Poland, now the world's fifth-largest coal exporter, will instead
try to increase exports of other products, Wilczek said.
   He said Poland has been struggling to keep production as high as
190 million tons of coal annually and it is not economically
feasible to increase extraction. Meanwhile, he said, demand for
energy is increasing in Poland and the country has few other
significant energy resources.

   Because of improper phone service charges,
uncovered in a secret PUC probe, Pacific Bell has paid out $94.5
million in penalties and refunds to 491,000 customers, the utility
says.
   Company officials said Tuesday $63 million in charges billed to
customers for services they did not order or need were refunded
between September 1986 and November 1988.
   The utility spent another $15 million to notify 8.5 million
customers about the refunds, and yet another $16.5 million in
penalties levied by the Public Utilities Commission.
   The PUC reported that an undercover staff investigation disclosed
that Pacific Bell representatives, among other things, often added
optional features such as call-waiting and call-forwarding to bills
although they hadn't been ordered.
   The phone company said it will continue to offer the refunds to
customers who received unwanted services between January 1985 and
October 1986.

<HEAD>GEC, Siemens Temporarily Blocked From Plessey Bid</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By COTTEN TIMBERLAKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The British government on Thursday temporarily
barred General Electric Co. PLC and Siemens AG from proceeding with
their hostile, $3.6 billion takeover bid for British defense
contractor Plessey Co.
   Trade Secretary Lord Young said he referred the bid to the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission to determine its effects on
competition, particularly in defense electronics and air traffic
control equipment.
   Young asked the commission to make its recommendation within
three months. During that time the bidders cannot proceed with their
offer and are limited to a Plessey holding of under 15 percent.
   Following the ruling, the British and German partners raised
their stake in Plessey to about 14.9 percent from about 3 percent.
   Meanwhile, in Brussels, Belgium, the European Commission said it
would investigate the joint bid, which might break Common Market
competition rules.
   The commission was requesting information from the companies
involved and hoped to complete the inquiry ``as soon as possible,''
said a spokesman for Leon Brittan, a Briton who is the new European
commissioner for competition policy.
   The developments came amid expectations that a newly formed
international consortium, expected to include Plessey, would make a
bid for GEC, a British electronics giant that is unrelated to the
similarly named U.S. company.
   The potential bid for GEC was expected to be worth between $11.6
billion and $14.3 billion, which would make it the largest takeover
ever on London's Stock Exchange.
   Such a counterbid would be what Wall Street calls a ``Pac Man''
defense because of its similarity to the eat-or-be-eaten video game.
   After the British government's announcement, GEC and Siemens paid
$4.39 a share in a midmorning raid that increased their joint stake
in GEC to the maximum allowed, said Barclays de Zoete Wedd Ltd.,
broker to the companies.
   By paying $4.39 a share for Plessey stock, the bidders are forced
by British takeover rules to raise their offer to at least that
price if they get clearance to proceed.
   A bid at that price would value the whole of Plessey at about
$3.3 billion.
   The previous offer of $4.03 a share, which automatically lapsed,
valued Plessey at $3 billion.
   GEC and Siemens, a West German electronics maker, said they would
cooperate with the British inquiry ``in the belief that the proposed
merger will be allowed to proceed in due course.''
   Plessey shares finished 13 cents higher at $4.17 on London's
Stock Exchange. GEC shares ended up 4 cents at $3.85.
   The GEC-Siemens bid has come under heavy political pressure in
Britain and a referral to the mergers commission had been considered
likely. The government blocked a solo bid from GEC for Plessey in
1986, saying it would harm competition in the British defense
electronics market.
   But many analysts expect the government to allow it to proceed
this time.
   Plessey, meanwhile, said it would not relax its attempts to fight
the GEC-Siemens bid.
   John Clark, Plessey's chairman and chief executive officer, said
his company would explore various means to maximize shareholder
benefits. The statement was believed to be a reference to Plessey's
expected role in the efforts to build a consortium bid for GEC.
   Metsun Ltd., a shell company set up to lead any bid for GEC, said
talks on a possible offer were continuing. The offer would lead to
the breakup of GEC and the sale some of its businesses.
   Analysts said the investigations could hinder the negotiations,
which are being conducted by Plessey's adviser, Lazard Brothers and
Co., because the referral indicated that any further bid in the
industry also would be referred to the commission.

<HEAD>Appeals Court Declines to Block Second Trial in Stock Manipulation
Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court rejected defense
arguments Thursday to prevent a second trial in the
stock-manipulation case against GAF Corp. and a key company officer,
two days after a mistrial was declared.
   The ruling by the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals after a brief
hearing means jury selection for a new trial will commence next
Tuesday in U.S. District Judge Mary Johnson Lowe's court, lawyers
involved in the case said.
   Lowe decreed a mistrial Tuesday in the first major case arising
from the Wall Street insider trading scandal to reach the trial
phase. She based the ruling on a prosecutorial blunder in handling a
key piece of evidence.
   The judge ordered a new trial, but lawyers for the chemical
company and vice chairman James Sherwin appealed on grounds of
double jeopardy, the legal principle that protects defendants from
two trials for the same offense.
   Defense lawyers routinely object to new trials when mistrials are
declared, but the strategy's success depends on the circumstances of
the case.
   In instances of prosecutorial misconduct, the defense generally
has to prove that prosecutors deliberately provoked a mistrial
because they feared they would lose and wanted a second chance.
   But Judge Lowe said she believed the prosecution's mistake in the
GAF case was unintentional, which weighed heavily in the appeals
court's support of her decision to proceed with a new trial.
   GAF and Sherwin were indicted in July for an alleged scheme to
manipulate up the price of Union Carbide Corp. stock in order to
maximize GAF's gain from the sale of Carbide shares it wished to
sell after a failed takeover attempt.
   The prosecution has based its case largely on the testimony of
ex-broker Boyd L. Jefferies, whose Los Angeles-based securities firm
conducted the alleged manipulation on GAF's behalf. Jefferies
himself was implicated in wrongdoing by inside trader Ivan F.
Boesky, who is now imprisoned.

<HEAD>Money Funds Rose $4.36 Billion in Latest Week to Record High</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Interest rate figures reported by Donoghue's Money Fund Report
are for week ended Tuesday. All other figures are for the week ended Wednesday.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Assets of the nation's 453 money market mutual
funds rose $4.36 billion in the latest week to an all-time high of
$282.4 billion, the Investment Company Institute said Thursday.
   The rise in the seven-day period ended Wednesday followed a
$449.5 million drop in fund assets the previous week, the
Washington-based mutual fund trade group said.
   ``In a sharp reversal of the end-of-the-year decline, assets of
money market funds staged an impressive advance to reach an all-time
high record,'' said Jacob Dreyer, vice president and chief economist
of the group.
   The new record eclipses the previous all-time high of $281.89
billion reported in the week ended Nov. 23.
   The biggest weekly rise in the funds' assets _ $9.64 billion in
the week ended Oct. 21, 1987 _ came during the stock market collapse
as investors sought safe havens for their money.
   The Investment Company Institute said that in the latest week,
assets of 225 general purpose funds rose $239.5 million to $90.17
billion, assets of 91 broker-dealer funds rose $3.61 billion to
$119.28 billion, and assets of 137 institutional funds rose $519.2
million to $72.94 billion.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds fell in
the week ended Tuesday to 8.28 percent from 8.39 percent the
previous week, according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade
journal based in Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield rose to 8.22 percent from 8.14 percent,
Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was 30
days, up from 29 days, Donoghue's said.
   The newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of 100 leading
commercial banks, savings and loan assocations and savings banks in
the nation's 10 largest markets showed the effective annual yield
available on money market accounts rose to 6.24 percent as of
Wednesday from 6.22 percent a week earlier.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super NOW
accounts, rose to 5.14 percent from 5.13 percent.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 8.26
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, up from 8.21 the
previous week. Yields were 8.51 percent on 1-year CDs, up from 8.48
percent; 8.63 percent on 2{-year CDs, up from 8.58 percent; and 8.75
percent on 5-year CDs, up from 8.71 percent.

<HEAD>Appeals Court Say Takeover Attempt May Continue</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fried chicken king Al Copeland may resume his
$290 million takeover attempt against Church's Fried Chicken, a
federal appeals court ruled Thursday.
   ``I'm delighted,'' said Peter Butler, attorney for A. Copeland
Enterprises Inc. _ the company which owns New Orleans-based Popeyes
Famous Fried Chicken _ after Judge Henry A. Politz announced the
decision for the three-judge 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel.
   ``The stay is lifted,'' said Butler. ``We'll move forward with
all haste, and leave it to the shareholders as to whether or not to
believe our offer is a reasonable one.''
   A hearing is set Wednesday in federal court in San Antonio,
Texas, where Popeyes is fighting ``poison pill'' anti-takeover
bylaws which Church's adopted Nov. 4, more than a week after Popeyes
made its offer. Church's is headquartered in San Antonio.
   ``I don't consider that a major obstacle,'' said Butler.
   The judges announced their decision 35 minutes after arguments
were over. They did not go into their reasons for upholding the
ruling handed down Nov. 28 by U.S. District Judge Charles Schwartz,
saying only that they affirmed it on all points.
   ``We neither approve nor disapprove of the reasons for that
decision,'' Politz said.
   Guy M. Struve, the New York attorney representing Church's, said
he was disappointed and did not know when the chain would decide
whether to appeal Thursday's ruling.
   Struve argued that the $8-a-share takeover bid should be halted
because it was based on insider information provided by a former
Church's executive now employed by Popeyes, and because merging the
nation's No. 2 and 3 fried chicken chains would violate federal
antitrust laws.
   Sam Kadet of the corporate law firm of Skadden, Arps said Popeyes
could give Church's notice on Thursday that it planned to proceed
with the takeover attempt and deliver the information to Church's
after five business days. Popeyes would have 12 more business days
after that to close the deal, he said.
   The chain has said that it owns 3.2 percent of Church's stock and
has been tendered another 14.6 million _ about 40.6 percent _ of the
35.9 million shares outstanding.

   Stock prices rolled up their sixth gain in the
past seven sessions Thursday, extending the early-1989 rally that
has carried the market to its highest levels since the 1987 crash.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 15.89 points to
2,222.32 _ less than 25 points shy of its close of 2,246.74 on Oct.
16, 1987, just before it took a 508-point drop on Black Monday.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by more than 3 to 2 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
907 up, 586 down and 496 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 183 million shares,
up from 148.95 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those
stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market,
totaled 215.92 million shares.
   Analysts said traders were encouraged by the market's drive
Wednesday past the 2,200 level in the Dow after a week-long struggle.
   In addition, they cited a developing ``bandwagon'' effect as
investors who had been bearish on the outlook for months felt

   The market's steady advance since last fall has come without any

   The market has shown persistent strength in recent sessions, with
the 100-share index gaining nearly 70 points since Tuesday of last
week.
   ``The market just doesn't want to go down,'' one dealer said.
   The Financial Times 30-share index rose 13.1 points to 1,511.9 at
the close. The Financial Times 500-share index rose 8.92 points to
close at 1,041.79.
   Volume was heavy, expanding to 791.3 million shares from
Wednesday's 581.3 million.
   A large portion of Thursday's turnover was in Plessey Co., whose
shares were snatched up in a midmorning raid.
   A joint venture of Britain's General Electric Co. PLC and West
Germany's Siemens AG bought about 89 million Plessey shares shortly
after Trade Secretary Lord Young referred their bid for Plessey to
the Monopolies and Mergers Commission for a study of its impact on
competition.
   Market excitement faded shortly after midday once the GEC-Siemens
buying spree ended, as the companies approached the limit of 14.9
percent of Plessey shares that British authorities imposed.
   But the market picked up again as Wall Street pushed ahead in
early trading. As London trading finished, the Dow Jones industrial
average was up 16.43 points at 2,222.86.

<HEAD>Plans to End Merger Pact, Sell Oster-Sunbeam to Black &amp; Decker</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Allegheny International Inc. announced plans
Thursday to cancel a merger agreement with a New York securities
firm in favor of a deal to sell its core Oster-Sunbeam division to
Black &amp; Decker Corp. for $260 million.
   The proposed sale is the centerpiece of an independent plan of
reorganization that management intends to present in bankruptcy
court, where creditors had backed the proposal from the securities
firm Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Inc.
   The company also said it entered a letter of intent with Spear,
Leeds &amp; Kellog, head of a shareholders' committee that had
previously battled management, to finance management's plan.
   The Oster-Sunbeam division makes a range of small household
appliances, including shavers, mixers and other kitchen appliances.
   Black &amp; Decker, based in Towson, Md., manufactures and sells
power tools, accessories, household appliances and lawn care
equipment.
   Under management's plan, Allegheny International would be left
with businesses that include lawn furniture, gas grills, electric
blankets, scales and clocks, among other things.
   ``The consensus is they just abdicated,'' unsecured creditors'
counsel Robert Sable said after the board confirmed published
reports that it voted down the Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette plan on
Wednesday.
   ``It's time the creditors take control of the case,'' he said.
   In voting to cancel its earlier tentative merger agreement with
Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, the board cited the securities firm's
subsequent arrangement with a rival bidder, the Paul S. Levy
merchant banker group, to carve up the company between them.
   Allegheny International said it would ask U.S. Bankruptcy Court
for sanctions against Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette and against the
Levy group.
   In its latest version, the Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette plan
would have sold Allegheny International's lawn furniture and gas
grill business to the Levy group for about $250 million, according
to the Wall Street Journal.
   Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette would have retained the
Oster-Sunbeam division.
   In another late change, Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette would have
put $30 million less common equity into the deal than it had earlier
proposed, according to the New York Times.
   Allegheny International said Thursday it had asked the bankruptcy
court to void the agreement with Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette.
   ``We were surprised, we're disappointed and we're examining our
options,'' said Peter A. Joseph, a partner in the Levy group.
   ``We're amazed and disappointed that the board, having postponed
a decision from November to December and then from December to
January has now rejected the sale route altogether,'' said Wilbur
Ross of Rothschild Inc., an adviser to the unsecured creditors.
   The board announced a tentative merger agreement with Donaldson,
Lufkin &amp; Jenrette last November after the major creditor groups shot
down an earlier reorganization plan from management and forced the
board to offer the company for sale.
   Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette and Levy both made independent
buyout proposals. The board twice endorsed the securities firm's
offer, only to withdraw support when Levy sweetened its bid.
   Both plans would have repaid creditors nearly in full. Donaldson,
Lufkin &amp; Jenrette would have given stockholders 40 percent of the
reorganized company, which would have closely resembled the current
Allegheny International.
   The Levy group would have given shareholders 49 percent equity in
what was left after selling the Oster-Sunbeam unit to reduce debt.

   The dollar rose against most major currencies
Thursday but its increase was modest, a sign of the success of
central banks' efforts to halt its recent ascent. Gold prices rose.
   Foreign-exchange dealers said trading was cautious in the
aftermath of Wednesday's concerted dollar-selling by the Federal
Reserve and at least eight other central banks.
   ``They (central banks) have in fact capped the dollar,'' said
Marc Cohen, a vice president of Republic National Bank of New York.
But Cohen said there was strong support for the dollar at current
levels, meaning the currency is ``trapped'' for now in a narrow
trading range.
   ``The market just seemed to be settling in ranges,'' said Robert
Ryan, corporate foreign-exchange manager for Irving Trust Co.
   In London, one British pound cost $1.7880 late Thursday, more
expensive for buyers that Wednesday's late $1.7815. Later in New
York, the pound weakened against the dollar and was quoted at
$1.7850, down from $1.7866 late Wednesday.
   The dollar closed at 126.12 Japanese yen in Tokyo, down from
126.95 yen Wednesday. Later in London the dollar was trading
slightly higher at 126.15 yen. In New York, the dollar rose to
126.38 yen from 125.82 yen late Wednesday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Wednesday's
late rates, included: 1.8268 West German marks, up from 1.8255;
1.5559 Swiss francs, up from 1.5529; 1.1972 Canadian dollars, down
from 1.2013; 6.2280 French francs, up from 6.2240; and 1,344 Italian
lire, up from 1,341.
   Other late rates for the dollar in Europe, compared with
Wednesday's late rates, included: 1.8355 West German marks, up from
1.8280; 1.5510 Swiss francs, down from 1.5550; 6.2150 French francs,
down from 6.2270; 2.0590 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0595; 1,339.50
Italian lire, up from 1,337.50; and 1.1957 Canadian dollars, down
from 1.2003.
   Gold bullion prices were up by around $1 a troy ounce but traders
said the market lacked sparkle and Middle East customers stayed away
after buying earlier in the week.
   Gold closed in Hong Kong at $406.36 a troy ounce bid, up from
$404.48 an ounce.
   The closing price in London, the major market, was $404.50 bid a
troy ounce, up from $403.50. The closing price in Zurich,
Switzerland, was $404.20 an ounce bid, up from $403.30.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery rose to $404.50 a troy ounce from $403.40 Wednesday. Later,
Republic National Bank of New York said gold was bid at $404.20 an
ounce as of 4 p.m. EST, up from $403.65 late Wednesday.
   Silver bullion traded late in London at $5.95 an ounce bid a troy
ounce, up from $5.94 late Wednesday. On New York's Comex, silver
bullion for current delivery fell to $5.916 an ounce from $5.921.

<HEAD>Bear Stearns Posts Highest Quarterly Profit; Announces Stock Buyback</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At a time when many securities firms have
suffered an earnings slump, Bear Stearns Cos. Inc. announced the
best quarterly earnings in its history Thursday, more than a
125-fold gain over the year earlier period.
   Bear Stearns also said it would repurchase up to 4.8 percent of
its stock in the next four weeks, which analysts called a reflection
of self-confidence in an era largely colored by post-crash
uncertainty.
   The company said earnings for the second quarter ended Dec. 31
increased to $63.3 million from $500,000 in the comparable period of
1987. Per-share earnings totaled 73 cents, vs. none a year earlier
because of special payments to preferred shareholders.
   Revenue for the quarter totaled $624.6 million, up 41 percent
from the $442 million for the same period a year earlier.
   For the six months ended Dec. 31, Bear Stearns reported earnings
of $83.8 million or 94 cents a share, up 206 percent from $27.4
million or 26 cents a share a year earlier.
   Revenue for the six-month period totaled $1.1 billion, up from
$906.6 million for the same period a year earlier.
   Many Wall Street firms involved primarily in retail brokerage
posted lackluster results last year, reflecting a flight from stocks
following the October 1987 crash. However, firms involved primarily
in investment banking, such as financing corporate takeovers, fared
better.
   Bear Stearns said results for the latest quarter reflected strong
performance in ``principal transaction'' business _ management of
its own money _ and its investment banking activities.
   The firm would not provide figures for the retail business, one
of Bear Stearns' six areas of operation, but analysts said it was
doing poorly.
   ``Some of the decisions made in October 1987 (not to retrench
after the crash) are starting to have a very positive impact on our
bottom line,'' said Alan C. Greenberg, the chairman and chief
executive officer.
   ``We are particularly proud that our head count is approximately
the same as it was before October 1987 and we have not eliminated
any lines of business,'' he said, alluding to layoffs and cutbacks
at competitors.
   Bear Stearns has about 6,000 employees in 13 offices worldwide.
   Under the stock repurchase plan, Bear Stearns said it will buy
back up to 4 million of its shares by Feb. 10, approximately 4.8
percent of the total amount outstanding, at a cost of between $12.25
to $14 a share.
   Bear Stearns stock closed at $13.25 a share Thursday on the New
York Stock Exchange, down 50 cents from Wednesday.
   The company said it considered the stock buyback an attractive
investment and an appropriate use of available cash.
   Bear Stearns was a partnership before it went public in October
1985, and about half its stock is owned by current and former
employees, said Brenda Davis McCoy, a stock analyst at PaineWebber
Inc. She called the stock buyback ``a vote of confidence'' in the
company.
   Bear Stearns also announced it had increased its quarterly
dividend on common stock to 14 cents a share from 12{ cents, payable
March 15.

<TEXT>
   The two broadest measures of the nation's money
supply rose in the week ended Jan. 2, the Federal Reserve Board
reported Thursday. The growth in money supply in 1988 was within the
Fed's target range.
   The Fed said the measure known as M2 rose $3.1 billion to a
seasonally adjusted $3,068.7 billion from $3,065.6 billion the
previous week.
   An even broader measure, M3, increased $4.7 billion to a
seasonally adjusted $3,905.0 billion from $3,900.3 billion.
   M2 grew 5.4 percent and M3 grew 6.3 percent in 1988, according to
a comparison of the last 13 weeks of 1988 with the last 13 weeks of
1987. The Fed had aimed at growth of 4 percent to 8 percent in the
two money supply measures in the year.
   The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, rose $6.7 billion
to a seasonally adjusted $793.1 billion from $786.4 billion. Its
growth in 1988 was 4.3 percent.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply
measures.
   The Fed said in mid-1988 that it reaffirmed its target for annual
growth in M2 and M3 at between 4 percent and 8 percent, which is
slightly lower than the 1987 target of 5.5 percent to 8.5 percent.
The Fed has not set a specific target range for M1 since early 1987.
   The Fed has tentatively set a target of M2 growth of 3 percent to
7 percent and M3 growth of 3.5 to 7.5 percent in 1989. There again
is no target for M1 growth.
   For the latest 13 weeks, M2 averaged $3,053.6 billion, a 3.0
percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous 13
weeks. M3 averaged $3,888.1 billion, up 4.2 percent, while M1 rose
1.2 percent to an average of $785.2 billion.
   In other reports:
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported commercial and
industrial loans at major New York City banks rose $663 million in
the week ended Jan. 4, compared with a gain of $173 million a week
earlier.
   _The Federal Reserve said bank borrowings from the Federal
Reserve System at the discount window, excluding extended credit,
averaged $309 million a day in the week ended Wednesday, down from
$1.372 billion in the previous week.
   _The Federal Reserve said net free reserves totaled $151 million
in the two-week period ended Jan. 11, down from a revised $741
million in the previous two-week period.
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that the monetary
base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank reserves held at
Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and in circulation,
was $287.9 billion in the two-week period ended Wednesday, up from
$285.0 billion two weeks earlier.

<HEAD>Copper Futures Surge On Renewed Supply Fears</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Copper futures prices surged Thursday on New York's Commodity
Exchange amid signs of tightening supplies and production problems
against a backdrop of steady demand.
   On other markets, precious metals finished mixed; coffee futures
ended higher; grains and soybeans were mixed; energy futures were
mostly higher; cattle futures were higher; pork futures were mixed;
and stock-index futures advanced.
   Copper settled 0.30 cent to 4.35 cents higher with the spot price
at $1.489 a pound and the most active futures contract, for delivery
in March, at $1.379 a pound.
   The advance followed five straight days of declines in both the
spot price and the March contract.
   Analysts said buying interest was piqued by the Commodity
Exchange's report of a 500-ton decline Wednesday in inventories of
copper for delivery against futures contracts. The decline, which
brought the exchange's warehouse stocks to 12,459 tons, indicated
strong demand for immediate delivery of copper, they said.
   Further buying was linked to rumors that the Chilean copper
company Codelco was considering shutting down its smelter at
Chuquicamata, the world's largest copper mine, due to persistent
mechanical problems, said Fred Demler, metals economist with Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc. in New York.
   Chile, the world's top copper producer in 1987, fell short of its
1988 production goal by 85 tons due to production problems, Demler
said.
   He said labor problems had resurfaced in Peru, the world's
sixth-largest copper producer, where a 57-day miners' strike late
last year contributed to a 100,000-ton drop in annual copper
production.
   And copper production in Zambia and Zaire, the fourth- and
fifth-largest producers, fell by 135,000 metric tons last year due
to mechanical and transportation difficulties, he said.
   Meanwhile, copper consumption is at its seasonal peak, and
projections for continued economic expansion in the United States,
Japan and Western Europe suggest that strong demand for the metal
will continue, analysts said.
   ``It's a very tight market,'' Demler said.
   Analyst Scott Hinton of Elders Futures Inc. said the copper
market seemed unsinkable, even though prices have fallen from the
record highs reached in early December.
   Gold advanced marginally while silver futures fell for the fourth
straight day on the Commodity Exchange.
   Gold settled 50 cents to 60 cents higher with February at $405.80
a troy ounce; silver was 0.5 cent to 1.5 cents lower with March at
$5.985 a troy ounce.
   Coffee futures ended higher in a day of volatile trading on New
York's Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa Exchange following a dramatic plunge on
Wednesday.
   Coffee settled 0.5 cent to 3.3 cents higher with March at $1.4211
a pound.
   Grain and soybean futures finished mixed on the Chicago Board of
Trade as traders adjusted their positions ahead of Friday's crop
report from the Agriculture Department.
   Wheat futures finished mostly lower for the third consecutive
session amid jitters about an expected increase over last year in
winter wheat plantings. The figure is the most eagerly awaited
statistic in the USDA report, and analysts' estimates have varied
widely.
   The crop report, due out after Friday's close of trading, also
will contain the USDA's final 1988 crop production totals, new
estimates of the nation's grain and soybean stockpiles and estimates
for 1989 corn and soybean acreage.
   Wheat settled 3\ cents lower to { cent higher with March at
$4.41\ a bushel; corn was } cent lower to 1{ cents higher with March
at $2.86 a bushel; oats were { cent lower to 1} cents higher with
March at $2.37} a bushel; soybeans were 2{ cents lower to 1\ cents
higher with January at $7.98{ a bushel.
   Most energy futures prices finished moderately higher on the New
York Mercantile Exchange after falling earlier in the day.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 3 cents to 18 cents
higher with February at $18.17 a barrel; heating oil was .85 cent
lower to .30 cent higher with February at 52.84 cents a gallon;
unleaded gasoline was .50 cent to .74 cent higher with February at
49.27 cents a gallon.
   On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, live cattle settled .10 cent
to .22 cent higher with February at 74.02 cents a pound; feeder
cattle were unchanged to .40 cent higher with January at 85.05 cents
a pound; live hogs were .20 cent lower to .30 cent higher with
February at 45.57 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .47 cent
to .87 cent higher with February at 42.70 cents a pound.
   Stock-index futures advanced modestly on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, where the contract for March delivery of the Standard &amp;
Poor's 500 index settled .85 point higher at 285.25. Each point is
worth $500.

   James D. Watkins, picked Thursday by
President-elect Bush to head the Energy Department, brings to the
job an expertise in an area that has emerged as the department's
biggest headache: nuclear weapons.
   Watkins studied nuclear reactor engineering in 1958 at the Oak
Ridge, Tenn., National Laboratory. He was an instructor at naval
nuclear power training centers in 1960 and four years later took
command of the nuclear-powered submarine Snook.
   The Oak Ridge lab is one link in the Energy Department's
nationwide network of reactors and other nuclear weapons facilities.
The aging complex has been crippled recently by a series of safety
and environmental problems, leaving the United States temporarily
unable to produce tritium, a radioactive gas that is vital to making
nuclear warheads.
   One of Watkins' main tasks, if he is confirmed in the post by the
Senate, would be to guide the department's mounting efforts to
rebuild the nuclear arms plants and clean up the environmental
damage caused by four decades of bomb-making.
   For two years before becoming a nuclear sub commander, Watkins
was an administrative assistant in the Naval Reactors Division of
the Atomic Energy Commission, the forerunner of the Energy
Department, according to a Pentagon biography.
   Watkins, 61, capped his 41-year Naval career with a four-year
stint as chief of naval operations, the service's top post, in the
rank of admiral. He retired in 1986.
   Although some of his closest friends advised him against it,
Watkins accepted President Reagan's request in October 1987 to head
an AIDS study commission that had been rocked by internal disarray
and widespread public ridicule.
   Under Watkins' leadership the AIDS panel produced a series of
widely praised recommendations.
   Watkins is described by associates as a clear-thinker who blends
practical experience with political savvy.
   ``People can anticipate that he is a studied person, that is, he
will study the issues in great depth,'' said Capt. Brent Baker, who
served with Watkins in the Mediterranean in 1978-79. ``He's a blend
of nuclear submariner ... and a good judge of people.''
   Watkins was born in Alhambra, Calif., near the Los Angeles
harbor, on March 7, 1927. His mother, LouiseWard Watkins, ran
unsuccessfully in 1938 for the Republican nomination to a Senate
seat, one of the few women of her time to run for national office.
   He later recalled that his mother would take him to nearby Navy
ports to watch the big ships come and go. She sometimes arranged to
get aboard the ships, where they dined with officers and heard tales
about life on the high seas.
   Inspired by those stories, and his first-hand look at sailors,
Watkins decided to seek a life in the Navy. He entered the Naval
Academy at Annapolis, Md., in 1945, just as World War II was drawing
to a close. He graduated in 1949.
   Afterward, Watkins served aboard destroyers and submarines,
earned a master's degree at the Naval Postgraduate School, and then
made one of the key decisions in his career: specializing in the
field of nuclear submarines. He became a confidante of Adm. Hyman
Rickover, the father of the modern nuclear Navy and the man who
played a key role in the careers of dozens of Navy leaders.
   Rising within the Navy's ranks, Watkins became commander of the
Pacific Fleet, based at Honolulu. In March 1982, Reagan chose him as
chief of naval operations.
   Watkins helped oversee the big naval buildup, from 450 to nearly
600 ships, that was at the heart of the Reagan administration's
defense policy in the president's first term.
   Watkins and his wife of 38 years, Sheila Jo, have raised six
children.

<HEAD>Congressional Hearing Told Of S&amp;L Insider Fraud</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES O. CLIFFORD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A congressional hearing convened to ``clean
up the mess'' in the nation's savings and loans was told Thursday
that more than $220 million in losses from insider fraud have been
uncovered in thrifts in California, Nevada and Arizona.
   The disclosure was contained in a half-inch-thick statement from
James Cirona, president of the Federal Home Loan Bank of San
Francisco. Cirona, whose jurisdiction includes the three states,
testified before the House Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs
Committee.
   Cirona said that since August of 1987 his investigators had
referred 5,384 cases of possible fraud or abuse to the U.S.
attorney's office.
   The statement given to the lawmakers said many of the cases
``involve rather small amounts obtained fraudulently by borrowers or
depositors.''
   ``However, we are particularly concerned by abuse by insiders,
which may often involve very large sums of money,'' it said. ``For
this reason we have established a special system of `priority
referrals' that involves insiders or amounts in excess of $100,000.
   ``We estimate that losses to 11th District institutions on these
priority referrals, as of September 23, 1988, amounted to over $220
million.''
   Committee Chairman Henry Gonzalez, D-Texas, called for a full
analysis of the crisis in the savings and loans industry, in which
government bailouts exceeded $38 billion in 1988.
   Estimates of the cost to rescue the remaining 350 or so involvent
thrifts have ranged from $50 billion to $75 billion.
   The hearing was needed to ``clean up the mess that is already out
there,'' said the congressman, adding that more hearings would be
held in other major cities.
   ``With both banks and savings and loans failing in record
numbers, it is imperative that this committee fully understands how
the problems have developed in the industry and the manner in which
state and federal regulatory agencies have responded to the
crisis,'' he said.
   The lawmakers need to talk to the ``people who deal with these
problems on a day-to-day basis,'' he said. ``For too long there has
been an overdependence on the wisdom of Washington-based bureaucrats
far removed from the scene of battle.''
   The hearing was scheduled to continue Friday.

   Murray Industries Inc., the parent of
Murray Chris-Craft Boat Cos., announced Thursday it had given
tentative approval to an offer from Genmar Industries Inc. to buy a
substantial part of the assets of the financially troubled boat
maker.
   The offer was accepted subject to receipt of court and regulatory
approval and any higher or better offer, said Chris-Craft
spokeswoman Mary Glass. Terms of the offer were not disclosed.
   Murray Industries Inc. and its affiliates filed for protection
from creditors Dec. 9 under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.
   Murray expects to seek approval from a bankruptcy judge for the
transaction Friday and anticipates court consideration in early
February, said Ms. Glass.
   Early approval would permit Genmar to produce the 1989 model line
of Chris-Craft boats, she said.
   Chris-Craft, the nation's oldest pleasure boat maker, makes
recreational powerboats ranging from 17-foot ski boats to 50-foot
yachts. It is not connected with Chris Craft Industries Inc., the
New York-based media company.
   Genmar, a division of Minstar Inc. of Minneapolis, is a
diversified manufacturer of recreational powerboats that sell under
the trademarks Wellcraft, Hatteras, Larson, Glastron, Lund,
Crestliner and Cajun.

<HEAD>Knight-Ridder Plans To Sell Two Daily Newspapers</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: INSERTS 1 graf after the 2nd graf with no comment on asking
price.</HEAD>

   Knight-Ridder Inc. on Thursday announced plans to
sell two of its daily newspapers _ the Star-News in Pasadena,
Calif., and the Post-Tribune in Gary, Ind.
   The company has owned the Star-News since 1956. The Post-Tribune
was purchased in 1966. Knight-Ridder will be represented in the sale
of the two newspapers by Goldman-Sachs.
   Knight-Ridder declined to reveal any asking price for the papers.
   ``The decision to sell these two newspapers was not an easy
one,'' said James K. Batten, Knight-Ridder president and chief
executive officer. ``Both papers have excellent leadership teams and
fine editors, writers and executives throughout their organizations.
But it is important to our shareholders and the future of our
organization that its individual components fit the overall
strategic and growth needs of Knight-Ridder.''
   Batten said an analysis of the company's holdings led management
to conclude that Knight-Ridder would benefit from selling the two
newspapers.
   ``Proceeds will be used to reduce the company's debt, repurchase
the company's stock or make strategic acquisitions,'' Batten said.
   ``We will be most inclined to consider offers from American
publishers who recognize the full value of these newspapers and
whose track records suggest that they would take seriously the
newspapers' responsibility to readers, advertisers and the
communities to be served,'' Batten said.
   Also on Thursday, Knight-Ridder announced that it has named Larry
Jinks publisher of the San Jose Mercury News, succeeding William A.
Ott, who will be the newspaper's chairman.
   Jinks had been senior vice president for news and operations. The
appointment is effective April 1.
   Last April, Knight-Ridder's board of directors authorized the
repurchase of 5 million shares of the company's stock. At its
December meeting, the board authorized the repurchase of an
additional 5 million shares.
   Knight-Ridder currently has 30 newspapers as well as business
information services and cable television operations. Last October,
the company announced it intends to sell its eight television
stations, but has not yet concluded a sale.

   A foul smell permeates the warehouses
where bundles of used plastic milk jugs and laundry detergent
bottles are stacked to the ceiling.
   But to Eaglebrook Plastics, the odor is the sweet smell of
success.
   Once the smelly containers are cleaned and ground up at the
plant, the used plastic, or ``post-consumer'' plastic, can be sold
for about 40 cents a pound.
   Manufacturers of products as diverse as pipes, flower pots and
toys are eager to buy the recycled plastic. The price for new
plastic has tripled in the past year to about 60 cents a pound.
   There's a ready source of supply, too. Many communities running
out of landfill space are eager to ship their bulky, plastic garbage
to the Middletown plant, called Eaglebrook East, a branch of
Eaglebrook Plastics Inc. of Chicago. The plant pays $100 to $150 per
ton of used plastic, depending on how clean and sorted it is.
   Plastics manufacturers have re-ground their own factory waste _
``pre-consumer'' plastic _ for years. Only recently have they begun
to consider containers discarded by consumers as a viable source of
lower-grade plastic.
   It sounds simple, but finding an efficient and profitable process
for recycling plastic has eluded the materials recovery field for
years because impurities interfere in the reprocessing.
   ``There is a great demand for recovered plastic, but the material
has to be clean,'' said Andrew Stephens, president of Eaglebrook
Plastics. ``Community recycling centers had to rely on the consumer
to wash the bottles thoroughly and strip off the paper labels.
   ``That's a lot of work for a person, and so about 98 percent of
those used containers ended up in the landfill. Our process frees
the consumer, and the community recycling center, from the labor
needed to clean those containers,'' Stephens said.
   The company developed what it affectionately calls ``Mr. Clean,''
a $200,000 machine that scrubs labels and bits of food from the
once-smelly empties.
   Once they are clean, the plastic containers are ground into a
grainy substance and packaged for sale.
   Eaglebrook opened shop in Chicago about five years ago with
$10,000 and an answering machine. It now has annual sales of $5
million and 50 employees, Stephens said.
   Once the business took hold in the Midwest, Eaglebrook officials
decided the company needed an East Coast location.
   ``We chose Middletown because we're trying to access the New York
City market but we wanted to be outside the high-priced metropolitan
area,'' said Robert Thompson, Eaglebrook's vice president.
   Eaglebrook East opened in Middletown in April. It expects to post
$2.5 million in sales for 1988.
   The company said there's such a tremendous source of raw
materials that the Middletown operation's 10 employees keep the
plant running 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
   About 2.2 billion pounds of high-density polyethylene plastic
containers are produced each year in the United States, the company
said. Eaglebrook Plastics says it will recover more than 3 million
pounds of that.
   The company takes plastic waste from just about anywhere.
Eaglebrook East has contracts with a New York City recycler, two
counties in New Jersey and Dutchess County in New York. It also
occasionally receives shipments from Maine.
   The Middletown plant also will clean ``pre-consumer'' waste
shipped to it by plastics manufacturers. In fact, only about 20
percent of the first 250 tons of plastic the company received fell
into the post-consumer category.
   To promote recycling, Eaglebrook is creating a line of products
that are manufactured from reprocessed plastic. Plastic from used
milk jugs, which is dyed shades of brown and rust, is being formed
into shapes that resemble wooden planks and sold for building decks.
   Eaglebrook is ``probably the largest of the proprietary
recyclers,'' said Susan Vadney, a spokeswoman for the Journal of the
Society of the Plastics Industry.
   The trade journal lists about two columns of recyclers, and all
most likely have automated washing systems like Mr. Clean, she said.
   But ``it's likely that they (Eaglebrook) have the best,'' Vadney
said.
