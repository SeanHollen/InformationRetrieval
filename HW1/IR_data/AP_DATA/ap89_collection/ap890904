   In a quiet, though dramatic,
reversal of policy, Brazil is now accepting foreign offers of help
to save the Amazon wilderness, the world's largest, from destruction.
   The government, which early this year rebuffed a United Nations
proposal to swap some of its $112-billion foreign debt for
investments in Amazon protection programs, recently told Britain and
West Germany it would work with them to curb damage, mostly by
burning, to the huge rain forest.
   In August, Brazil accepted Italian and Canadian planes for local
authorities to police the jungle. Then it said yes to a project
backed by the United Nations and by private American companies to
establish a 1.1 million-acre protected forest area to produce rubber
and nuts.
   The moves represent a sharp reversal in President Jose Sarney's
Amazon policy, which in the past considered offers by foreigners as
attempts to take control of the rain forest from Brazil.
   ``We cannot accept this form of colonialism which they want to
create here,'' Sarney told reporters in March, after France, the
Netherlands and two U.S. congressional delegations suggested trading
some Brazilian foreign debt, the Third World's largest, for Amazon
preservation.
   But analysts say subtle shifts in political, social and economic
spheres are forcing the government to change its mind.
   ``A bit of the persecution complex that took over the government,
which led to xenophobic and irrational behavior, is being overcome,
opening the road to new initiatives,'' wrote the Brazilian physicist
Jose Goldemberg in the O Estado de Sao Paulo newspaper recently.
   There is belief here that Sarney, widely discredited for his
inability to check 1,004 percent annual inflation, talked tough in
the past to placate right-wing supporters.
   But with his center-right Brazilian Democratic Movement Party in
splinters and the country's first popular presidential election
since 1960 set for Nov. 15, Sarney might now be resigned to accept
foreign aid, the analysts say.
   ``What you have is a lame-duck government that lacks the
legitimacy to start new initiatives and push them through
Congress,'' Rene Dreifuss, a political scientist at the Fluminense
University in Rio, told The Associated Press. ``It has no choice but
to accept help from abroad.''
   Equally important, the hostility marking the issue has undermined
Brazil's trade links abroad.
   ``It started to become taboo to do business in the Amazon,'' Sen.
Leopoldo Peres, a member of the Democratic Movement and president of
a Senate committee on Amazon deforestation, said in an interview.
``American and European banks and lending organizations started
hesitating on financing industrial projects in the jungle.''
   Environmentalists pressured the European Economic Community to
ban imports of iron ore produced at the Greater Carajas project, a
huge metallurgy project in Para, a state in the Amazon region.
   Recently, trade officials from Belgium, West Germany and Britain
visited the 200 million-acre, $70 billion project, where thousands
of acres of virgin forest southwest of the mouth of the Amazon River
are being burned for the charcoal needed to process ore.
   A Rio de Janeiro city councilman, Alfredo Sirkis of Brazil's
Green Party, contends Sarney first stiffened on the Amazon issue
under a barrage of international news coverage of the shooting death
of the acclaimed union leader and ecologist Francisco ``Chico''
Mendes.
   Mendes, who fought to keep cattle ranchers from cutting down the
forest for pasture, was killed last December outside his modest home
in a backwoods Amazon town.
   ``All of a sudden Chico was all over the front pages, and U.S.
senators were showing up to talk about saving the Amazon,'' Sirkis
said. ``It irritated the military, and Sarney reacted by turning it
into a sovereignty issue.''
   But the British rock star Sting met with Sarney in January and
received permission to begin a worldwide campaign to raise funds for
an Indian reservation.
   In February, Indian tribes of the eastern Amazon Basin organized
the first national tribal conference, with a goal of blocking World
Bank loans for a series of hydroelectric dams planned for the Amazon
region.
   These efforts added to a growing worldwide concern that
uncontrolled tree burning in the 2 million square-mile Amazon forest
_ for farming, ranching, highway building and mining _ was changing
global weather patterns.
   Environmentalists contend deforestation of the Amazon also is
destroying unique plant and animal life, much of it unstudied, and
eliminating a major source of oxygen for the Earth's atmosphere.
   Satellite surveys show that more than 5 percent of Brazil's rain
forest has been cut and burned. Some scientists say this adds carbon
to the atmosphere and helps cause the global warming trend known as
the greenhouse effect.
   By April, the first visible sign of change came when Sarney
announced a multimillion-dollar plan to preserve the rain forest.
   His ``Our Nature'' project extended the suspension of tax
incentives for ranchers and created a special police force to fight
the burning. It also established new forest and Indian reservations
and an Environmental Fund, banned timber exports, and controlled the
sale of mercury, which is indiscriminately dumped into Amazon-area
rivers by freelance gold prospectors.
   ``When the hysteria in the press and the government faded, the
nationalist jingo turned to apolitical dialogue,'' Flavio Feldmann
of the Brazilian Social Democratic Party, a vocal ecology defender,
told a reporter.
   On July 5, Foreign Minister Roberto Abreu de Sodre signed a
memorandum of understanding with Britain to tackle ``urban and
industrial environmental problems, control of marine pollution, and
forestry management.''
   ``This cooperation does not affect the sovereign right of states
to administer their natural heritage,'' said Abreu de Sodre.
   In August, Brazil accepted $65.5 million in grants and loans from
West Germany for conservation projects in the Amazon over three
years.
   After this, the Inter-American Development Bank said it would
study the creation of a new fund for environmental projects in Latin
America and the Caribbean.
   Many Brazilian politicians now say the country will open up more
to foreign technological and financial help, although some seemingly
remain wary of the so-called ``sovereignty issue.''
   But Christopher Patten, Britain's minister of overseas
development, a recent visitor to Brazil, said, ``Environmental
problems are ... the world's problem, which has to be solved by
cooperation and not throwing bricks at each other.''

<HEAD>Caribbean Is Gateway of South American Cocaine to US Market</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Also in Tuesday AMs report.</HEAD>

   Colombian drug lords smuggle most of
the cocaine sold in the streets of the United States through the
Caribbean, which has become a strategic narcotics gateway.
   On any given night, small planes from Colombia and other South
American nations drop bundles of cocaine into the blue Caribbean Sea.
   The bundles, bearing sophisticated blinking signal lights, are
then picked up by boats waiting off any one of 25 Caribbean
island-nations or the Bahamas.
   ``No island is exempt, no body of land,'' John Fernandez, the
U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency spokesman in Miami, said in a telephone
interview. ``It comes by boat, by air ... any type of boat, any type
of plane, any which way traffickers can get drugs in.''
   Officials say the Caribbean became the main cocaine route in the
last few years because of increased drug production and relatively
successful surveillance efforts in usual western routes, including
the U.S.-Mexico border.
   In just two or three hours, a plane carrying cocaine from
Colombia also can fly the 600 or so miles across the Caribbean to
landing fields in Haiti, the Dominican Republic, Jamaica, Puerto
Rico, or the U.S. and British Virgin Islands.
   The DEA estimates 60 to 80 percent of the cocaine and marijuana
smuggled to the United States is transshipped from the Caribbean and
the Bahamas, mostly to Florida, for redistribution to American
markets.
   Officials say Puerto Rico, a U.S. Commonwealth, has become a
recent favorite of traffickers because it has no U.S. Customs
inspections for flights leaving for the U.S. mainland.
   ``If it arrives here, it's in the United States,'' said Bill
Mitchell, a DEA special agent in San Juan. ``You can go up to any
airline counter and say you want to ship 20 kilos of hardware to
your sister. It's a domestic shipment. So you don't need to inspect
it.''
   Other ways to ship drugs to the United States from Puerto Rico
are by cruise ships, commercial planes, luggage and the U.S. mails.
But most shipments are made inside ship cargo containers. Puerto
Rico has about 1 million such containers, a number too great for
U.S. Customs to inspect effectively.
   In fiscal 1988, the DEA said, 11 tons of cocaine, 35 tons of
marijuana, nine vessels and 20 aircraft were seized in the Caribbean.
   But it's believed only about 20 percent of drugs shipments are
seized.
   ``Four, five years ago if you found 50 pounds of cocaine, it was
a lot,'' said Jaime Echeverria, in charge of U.S. Customs in Puerto
Rico. ``Today, shipments easily have 1,200 pounds.''
   Echeverria said that because Caribbean islands are small,
smugglers know there is little radar to track air traffic.
   ``There are three radars to detect planes in Puerto Rico but
things such as tropical weather and maintenance often incapacitate
their ability to spot planes,'' he said.
   Fernandez said law enforcers and drug smugglers play a ``cat and
mouse game.''
   ``They have the resources and all the possible technology to
detect where our efforts are,'' he said. ``As soon as they know
where we are, they shift. Then we shift.''
   Lax security in some smaller islands makes them easy stopover
points for drugs and money laundering.
   Corruption also plays a role, especially in nations with low
wages, inflation and unemployment.
   ``Traffickers are ruthless and try to capitalize on the political
and economic instability of a place, say, like Haiti,'' said
Fernandez. ``For example, you get the person in charge of ports ...
who makes $800 a month. I say to him, ``All you got to do is clear
us for inspection and forget about the $800 a month. I'll give you
$10,000.' ''
   Caribbean leaders want a United Nations task force, similar to a
peacekeeping force, to interdict drugs, share intelligence, train
agents and even mount paramilitary attacks on traffickers.
   The proposal is the initiative of Prime Minister Michael Manley
of Jamaica, who said a U.N. force would ease nationalistic hostility
typical of past U.S. drug operations, mainly in Bolivia and Peru.
   ``If I need some muscle, some really first-class narcotics agents
from the United States, somebody is going to scream about
sovereignty,'' Manley said in a recent interview.
   ``No one has ever quarreled with a U.N. peacekeeping force.''
   Manley's initiative was supported at a meeting in July of the
13-member Caribbean Community, which also includes Antigua and
Barbuda, the Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Dominica, Grenada, Guyana,
Montserrat, St. Kitts-Nevis, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the
Grenadines and Trinidad and Tobago.

   A man in military fatigues opened fire
with an automatic rifle Monday at passengers crowding into the
airport in this cocaine trafficking center, killing one man before
security forces shot him to death.
   Fourteen people, some only 15 feet away, were wounded before the
assailant was killed, a police official said.
   Doris Vargas, a police spokeswoman in Medellin, said the victims
were lined up outside the airport for a security check before being
allowed to enter the terminal.
   Medellin, 150 miles north of the capital of Bogota, is home to
the world's largest drug cartel and has been subjected to bombings
and other violence by narcotics traffickers since the government
anti-narcotics campaign began on Aug. 18.
   Medellin police said three bombs exploded in the city Monday
night, injuring two people.
   They said two bombs were thrown at offices of the government's
Caja Agraria bank and one of the blasts slightly injured two
passersby. They said damage to the buildings was light.
   In the third attack one of two men on a motorcycle threw a bomb
at a police post but missed and the device caused no injuries or
damage, according to the police.
   Also Monday, the beginning of $65 million worth of shipments of
emergency U.S. military aid continued to arrive in Colombia to help
in the crackdown.
   Civil aviation officials in the northwestern city of Monteria
said a C-123 transport plane of the State Department's international
narcotics division was firebombed early Sunday.
   The U.S. Embassy said Monday it could not confirm the bombing but
acknowledged the plane was badly damaged by fire.
   In Medellin, the attacker, who has not been identified, pulled up
to the terminal entrance in a Renault car, left the motor running,
stepped out then started firing, police said.
   Col. Luis Camejo, commander of national police for Antioquia
province, said the gunman ``began to fire indiscriminately with a
G-3 rifle,'' an automatic weapon.
   Six security guards who were frisking passengers and checking
hand luggage at the doorway killed the gunman, Vargas said. The
assailant wounded three of the security agents, she said.
   The remaining wounded were civilians, police said.
   ``He was only four to five meters (13 to 16 feet) away when he
opened fire,'' said Gladys Gil, who works at the airport's public
telephone area. ``Someone pushed me down. That was the last I
remember.''
   Airport workers as well as passengers had to line up for the
security check, Gil said.
   Gil said hundreds of people were in the terminal when the
shooting started but only about 20 still were lined up on the
pavement outside the door.
   The gunman struck at 7:15 a.m., during the morning rush, as
passengers crowded in for three flights to Bogota and one to Miami
on Colombia's Avianca airline, police spokeswoman Vargas said.
   Caracol, a national radio chain, identified the dead passenger as
a 27-year-old administrator for Pintuco, the country's largest paint
company, which is based in Medellin. The Pintuco factory was bombed
Thursday in an attack blamed on drug dealers.
   A business executive who escaped injury said: ``Everybody
panicked and just threw themselves on the floor, including me.'' He
said the attacker appeared to be 18 to 20 years old.
   Police said the gunman's car was towed away in case it contained
a bomb, but a search found no explosives. Caracol said some
marijuana was found in the vehicle.
   The airport was evacuated for a half-hour while police and
soldiers searched for other attackers. Flights were delayed about 90
minutes.
   Airport security was increased throughout Colombia. At El Dorado
in Bogota, police and soldiers searched passengers and checked bags
outside the terminal.
   The government of President Virgilio Barco ordered the crackdown
on drug traffickers after a string of assassinations that culminated
in the killing Aug. 18 of Sen. Luis Carlos Galan, the leading
presidential candidate and an outspoken foe of the cocaine barons.
   Using emergency powers, police and the army have seized more than
500 estates, office buildings and other property, including cars,
aircraft, yachts, cattle, and racehorses.
   Some middle-level traffickers have been arrested, but the
Medellin cartel leaders remain at large. Barco revived the
extradition process so traffickers wanted in the United States could
be sent there for trial.
   The drug lords responded by declaring their own war and launched
a terror campaign that has escalated in recent days.
   Medellin has been the focus of attacks, but bombings or attempted
bombings also have occurred in Bogota and in Cali, headquarters of
another cocaine cartel.
   A curfew was imposed on Medellin and its suburbs because of the
violence, but Mayor Juan Gomez Martinez reduced it Monday to 11
p.m.-5 a.m. from 10 p.m.-6 a.m.
   U.S. diplomats and Colombian authorities were in Barranquilla, a
Caribbean port, on Monday to take delivery of eight A-37 observation
and attack jets that arrived Monday from the United States.
   Two C-130 transport planes were delivered Sunday and five UH-IH
``Huey'' helicopters are expected Tuesday. Other gear in the $65
million aid package includes rockets, grenades, machine guns,
rifles, pistols, ammunition, and bulletproof vests and armored cars
for judges and law enforcement officials.

<DATELINE>VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An NAACP official Monday accused
authorities of overreacting during two nights of clashes between
black college students and police _ an allegation this resort city's
mayor denied.
   As many as 43 people were injured and more than 100 stores looted
in the bottle-throwing melees, which disrupted the Labor Day holiday
in this resort of 250,000 and left miles of normally busy beaches
nearly empty.
   Police said up to 100,000 young people, many here for an annual
fraternity festival of students from mostly black colleges, were on
the streets when rioting broke out early Sunday. Violence resumed
Sunday night and police, backed up by state troopers and 150
National Guardsmen, imposed an overnight curfew. There was no
recurrence of violence Monday night, authorities said.
   Police reported arresting about 260 people, half of them area
residents, and hundreds of summonses were issued through Sunday
afternoon, authorities said. Arrest figures overnight were not
immediately released.
   Jack W. Gravely, president of the state chapter of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People, said police
reaction would have been different if the students had been white.
   ``Their response was to confront the students from a position of
power,'' Gravely said. ``The Virginia NAACP strongly condemns the
overzealous, overpowering and overreactive actions of the Virginia
Beach police.''
   But, Gravely, added, ``That is not to say that they did not have
a right to protect property and persons.''
   NAACP officials and students have said they felt unwelcome in the
city and had been harassed by police. Gravely said the trouble
erupted as students ``felt squeezed'' by police and ``felt a need to
show discontent.''
   ``It's been like we're being singled out because we are young and
black,'' said Charles Stone, 23, of New York City.
   ``They've been trying to regulate things that don't need
regulating,'' said Paul Williams, a 21-year-old Temple University
student, said of police.
   One witness said some participants in the disturbances chanted,
``Fight the power,'' a phrase from the hit film ``Do The Right
Thing,'' which is about racial violence in New York City.
   No Guardsmen and few police were on the streets during the day
Monday, but the 150 Guardsmen called out early Sunday had not been
sent home. On Monday evening, eight-man squads of police stood at
intersections while young people strolled the sidewalks and cars
cruised bumper-to-bumper along Atlantic Avenue.
   City officials said they had no choice but to use force to clear
the streets. Mayor Meyera E. Oberndorf said police acted with
``extraordinary restraint.''
   ``We will not tolerate lawlessness from anybody,'' said
Oberndorf. ``Let the word go out that Virginia Beach will not stand
by and watch as unruly individuals trash our city.''
   At a news conference Monday afternoon, city officials played
police videotapes of the looting. But the tapes did not show police
clearing students from the streets with riot batons Sunday morning
and Sunday evening.
   Oberndorf said the situation was stable Monday ``and we intend to
keep it that way.''
   At least 13 young people and about 30 law enforcement officers
were injured in the melees, officials said. Two men, ages 25 and 28,
suffered gunshot wounds, and a third man was injured in a fall from
a hotel balcony.
   ``When they tried to move people, it went crazy,'' said Errin
Smith, 20, of New York. ``People were yelling `Fight the Power!' At
first people were just having a good time, but they harassed us from
the minute we got here.''
   Gravely, at a news conference, condemned the looting and said
those responsible should be punished. But he said the tactics of the
local police, troopers and Guardsmen called out by Gov. Gerald L.
Baliles at the request of city leaders made the situation worse.
   Baliles said in a statement Monday: ``What has happened in
Virginia Beach is not a pretty picture. But we must recognize that
there is no excuse for taking over public streets, looting stores,
or destroying personal property. It cannot be condoned, and it must
not be repeated.''
   George Mimms, president of the local NAACP chapter, said the
reaction by police to the students showed that race relations in the
city are poor.
   ``No foundation ever was built for good racial relations in this
city. This has just forced it out into the open,'' he said.
   Brenda Andrews, publisher of the Journal &amp; Guide, a local
black-oriented newspaper, said she and other citizens would not
condone violence by students or police. ``We are here to call on the
youngsters to leave ... because we are concerned with their
safety,'' she said.
   Some merchants along Atlantic Avenue, the city's 30-block main
thoroughfare that parallels the beach, complained about lost
business.
   ``This has destroyed tourism,'' said Ed Wirtz at a T-shirt shop
that closed because the violence. ``We would have done $3,000 worth
of business Sunday, and Monday would have been bigger. But now it's
down to zero.''
   Others said the students were welcome.
   ``The majority were great folks,'' said Abby Yates, owner of the
Bahama Shop. ``It was a cultural experience. There was no abuse. I
would welcome them back next year.''

   The slaying of a black teen-ager by a gang of
whites has brought racial tensions to the surface in New York's
mayoral campaign, dividing the two leading Democrats _ one black,
one white.
   The Aug. 23 death of 16-year-old Yusuf Hawkins ended months in
which the issue of race was rarely raised.
   ``This touches the exposed nerve of the city,'' said Richard
Wade, a graduate professor of urban history at City College. ``It
politicizes the racial question. All other issues suddenly are less
important.''
   Hawkins' shooting in the mainly white Bensonhurst section of
Brooklyn recalled the 1986 killing of a black man chased to his
death by whites in the city's Howard Beach section.
   Both cases sparked outrage.
   But this killing came just three weeks before the Sept. 12
primary in which Mayor Edward I. Koch, whose critics call him
racially insensitive, faces Manhattan Borough President David
Dinkins, who would be the city's first black mayor.
   ``The Koch voters and the Dinkins voters have very different
perceptions of where the city is and where it is going. This will
tend to magnify those differences,'' said Lee Miringoff, director of
the Marist College Institute for Public Opinion.
   Koch already has drawn fire under the spotlight: While he decried
the killing, he also criticized black protest marches held in
Bensonhurst, saying they raised tensions.
   ``It's just as wrong to march into Bensonhurst as it would be to
march into Harlem after that young woman in the jogging case,'' Koch
said. He was referring to the rape of a white jogger by a gang of
blacks in April.
   That drew criticism from the understated Dinkins, who has made
conciliation a campaign theme.
   ``To suggest that peaceful demonstrations _ led by members of the
clergy as a matter of fact _ had no right to be there, or that
somehow would exacerbate tension, is a position from which I
dissent,'' he said.
   Others were more direct. Koch ``has not displayed the same
outrage with this incident as he did with other incidents in other
communities,'' said Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., a leading black
officeholder. ``It is generally felt that he does not consider
himself the mayor of all of the people.''
   ``He knows what he's doing,'' said Wade, the urban historian.
``He's going after the white vote.''
   Koch's supporters protested. ``This is being pumped up because
Koch made the remarks, not because of what the remarks were,'' said
David Garth, the mayor's campaign strategist. ``Whatever Koch said,
other than `hello,' they would have jumped on. Because there are
people out there who wanted to jump on him.''
   Ray Harding, local leader of the Liberal Party and a supporter of
Republican Rudolph W. Giuliani, said Koch may reap ``redneck'' votes
from whites.
   But he said Dinkins may benefit from a greater turnout of black
voters, who make up a quarter to a third of the Democratic vote, and
others concerned with deteriorating race relations.
   Thus, in Harding's view, ``The outcome rests with the Hispanic
vote,'' which could exceed 10 percent of turnout.
   According to the 1980 census, the city's population of people 18
and older was 58 percent whites, 21.5 blacks, 17 percent Hispanics
and 3.5 percent Asians and others.
   There are two other candidates in the Democratic primary,
although both trail badly in the polls. On the Republican side,
former U.S. Attorney Giuliani faces cosmetics heir Ronald Lauder.
Democrats outnumber Republicans 5-1 in the city.

<TEXT>
   A bomb exploded Sunday night near a bookstore,
injuring three pedestrians, and police said a telephone caller
linked the blast to the campaign against Salman Rushdie's novel
``The Satanic Verses.''
   They said they received an anonymous telephone warning about the
bomb 10 or 15 minutes before it went off in London's West End.
   Detective chief superintendent Derek Wilson of Scotland Yard's
anti-terrorist squad said the telephone caller mentioned Rushdie's
book, which has angered Moslem fundamentalists around the world, who
claim it blasphemes their religion.
   Wilson said the explosion on the sidewalk on Great Marlborough
Street was near a window of a store that had a display of books, but
``The Satanic Verses'' was not among them.
   An ambulance service spokesman said a woman suffered leg injuries
and shock and two men also suffered shock. He said the victims were
taken to University College Hospital, where officials reported they
were in satisfactory condition.
   An Independent Radio News reporter at the scene said the blast
was next to a Penguin bookstore.
   ``The Satanic Verses'' was published last year under the Viking
imprint, which is part of the Penguin group. The company received
death threats against its staff after the Islamic campaign began and
two London bookstores _ one specializing in Penguin books _ were
damaged in arson attacks on April 9.
   ``Suddenly there was a huge bang,'' said Tracy Ryan, 23, who was
looking in a store window across the street when the bomb went off.
``It was really frightening and the pavement shook. It was a
terrible bang.''
   The main store of Liberty's, a textile fashion firm established
in 1875, is on Regent Street around the corner from the bomb site.
   Terry Norman, a Scotland Yard spokesman, said, ``There appears to

   An Islamic group in Lebanon claimed last month that a man who
accidentally blew himself up in a London hotel on Aug. 3 was
constructing a bomb to attack Rushdie.
   Rushdie has been in hiding under police guard since Iran's late
religious leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, said last February it
was the duty of a faithful Moslem to kill Rushdie.
   The author's American wife, Marianne Wiggins, said a week ago
that she could no longer stand the strain and had left her husband
four weeks earlier.

   It begins with the coca-growing peasant in
Bolivia or Peru, moves on to the Colombian drug baron and ends up
with the user in the United States or Europe. This is the cocaine
trail that has brought the peasant more than he has ever had before
and the baron enormous wealth. But cocaine money, as Colombia has
recently shown, is a curse in South America.

   The cocaine trade has become so pervasive
and so great an economic force in South America that it threatens
the sovereignty and security of nations.
   Billions of cocaine dollars are making their way into and in some
cases corrupting the economies of Colombia, Peru, Bolivia and more
recently Ecuador on a scale that approaches the amounts they earn
from legal exports.
   Cocaine cartels, producers and traffickers have established
virtual autonomous states in remote areas and, with the support of
local coca-growing peasants, operate out of the reach of the law.
   Anti-government guerrillas in Peru are arming themselves with
millions of dollars from drug cartels and traffickers, with whom
they have allied themselves in their attempts to seize power.
   In Colombia, traffickers have formed private armies with
intelligence-gathering units, modern weapons and fleets of aircraft.
In the past decade, they have killed 220 judges and other court
employees, two newspaper editors, a justice minister, an attorney
general, hundreds of policemen and soldiers and dozens of others
perceived as a threat to their business.
   But it was the assassination last month of the popular
presidential candidate Luis Carlos Galan that left the nation in
outrage and prompted the government to launch all-out war against
the cartels.
   In Bolivia and Peru, however, officials say the overall war
against the cocaine trade will be lost without a regional effort and
greater resources for effective coca-leaf reduction and interdiction
programs. Peasant coca farmers in the far reaches of Bolivia and
Peru are the suppliers for the traffickers of cocaine to the United
States and Europe.
   ``The implications for Colombia and for other Latin American
nations, where narcotraffickers are able to amass huge fortunes, are
crucial,'' the U.S. ambassador to Bolivia, Robert S. Gelbard, said
in an interview. ``The traffickers in a variety of ways are out to
suborn and destroy the democratic system in Bolivia as in other
countries of the region. This is nothing less than a war to decide
who will govern these countries.''
   Gelbard added: ``Both producing and consuming nations should take
heed of what is happening in Colombia. There is no such thing as
benign drug production or consumption. The sovereignty of producing
nations is a little less secure with every new acre of coca planted
and with every dollar spent on a cocaine high.''
   ``What we require is a regional approach to the problem because
otherwise whatever plans we have in Bolivia would be affected by
events in other countries,'' said Gonzalo Torrico, under secretary
of the interior in charge of Bolivia's drug interdiction programs.
   Already there is concern that the offensive against the Colombian
cartels will drive the traffickers to other South American nations
where vast areas are unpatrolled and lack radar to control air
traffic. Increased border patrols have already been set up in
Brazil, Peru, Ecuador and Bolivia.
   So far, the U.S. government's anti-drug strategy in South America
has been based on an effective interdiction program involving the
seizure of chemicals used to process coca leaves and the destruction
of cocaine-producing facilities. The intent was to drive down the
price of coca leaves and encourage farmers to shift to other crops.
   Operation ``Snowcap,'' a multi-nation cocaine interdiction
program central to the U.S. strategy, has destroyed since its
inception in 1987 more than 200 cocaine labs and seized more than 43
metric tons of cocaine.
   U.S. drug agents and local police forces have in recent years
increased their operating capacity but as police activities become
more effective, traffickers use their vast resources to bribe
judges, district attorneys and police officials.
   Despite a greater U.S. presence in drug producing nations,
cocaine production continues to rise by 10 percent a year, a U.S.
State Department report says. As a result, cocaine prices in the
United States have steadily declined, making cocaine and crack more
available. Europe and Asia are now the growth markets for cocaine.
   Peru, Bolivia and Colombia produced 348 to 454 metric tons of
pure cocaine in 1988, according to U.S. government figures.
   With cocaine selling wholesale in Miami for $15,000 a kilo (2.2
pounds) or higher and retailing for $50,000 to $120,000, the value
of South America's cocaine is worth at least $5 billion wholesale
and at least $17 billion retail, many times the legal exports of
drug-producing nations.
   In Bolivia, an impoverished country of 6.9 million people, the
cocaine produced is worth at least $1.7 billion wholesale. From that
an estimated $300 million to $500 million flows back into the
economy, compared with $600 million for all legal exports combined.

   For Peru's beleaguered economy, $700 million to $1.2 billion
enters the economy while legal exports bring in $2.5 billion.
   The U.S. government allocated $54.9 million for cocaine
interdiction and police training programs for the fiscal year 1989
for all countries south of the United States before President Bush
announced a $65 million emergency package for Colombia's anti-drug
war.
   The U.S. Congress allocated to Bolivia $10 million for fiscal
1989, $5 million less than in 1988. A single planeload of cocaine
from Bolivia to Colombia _ usually about 14,500 pounds _ would fetch
$10 million for the shipper.
   Bolivian anti-drug police trained by U.S. soldiers and assisted
by members of the U.S. Border Patrol and American agents have
destroyed three cocaine labs and 5,723 cocaine paste processing
pits, compared to 3,542 pits in 1988.
   But vast areas of the Bolivian tropical lowlands are beyond their
reach and traffickers' planes fly cocaine from the northern regions
of Bolivia to Colombia or Brazil without interference.
   At least 60 U.S. experts operate in Bolivia alongside 1,050
Bolivian anti-drug police.
   Ecuador is becoming an important money laundering and trafficking
center in South America. Cocaine shipments for the United States and
Europe have been discovered in everything from canned fruit to wood
and handicrafts. While coca-leaf production is relatively small in
Ecuador, traffickers are using that Andean country as a transit
point for drugs, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) says.
   Police estimate that $200 million to $400 million was laundered
or invested in Ecuador last year. The United States provides Ecuador
with $1 million a year for interdiction activities.
   ``As pressure increases in Colombia and Peru, cocaine trafficking
will increase in Ecuador because traffickers will move to the
country with the least amount of pressure,'' said William Fernandez,
a U.S. DEA station chief for Ecuador.
   Newspapers in Ecuador have expressed concern in editorials about
the danger of corruption of judges and government officials by drug
cartels.
   In Ecuador's most publicized case so far, two judges signed an
order for the release from jail of an important drug trafficker. The
judges then fled into hiding. One was captured later with nearly
$20,000 officials said he apparently had received as a payoff. The
other judge and the trafficker are still at large.
   The security threat in Peru is concentrated in the expanding
insurgency of the Shining Path, a Maoist guerrilla organization that
in the last two years has received millions of dollars from its
involvement in the drug trade. The money has allowed Shining Path to
better arm itself and is the principal reason the Peruvian
government is concerned about the drug trade.
   At the same time, corruption of lower-level officials and police
in Peru's Huallaga Valley hampers government efforts to wipe out the
cocaine trade in the jungle region.
   In the campaign for Bolivia's national elections this year, some
congressional candidates received backing and money from cocaine
traffickers.
   Bolivian traffickers also have even staked out whole towns or
areas as their own.
   When police tried recently to capture Bolivian and Colombian
traffickers in the town of Santa Ana, hundreds of townspeople came
to the traffickers's defense and forced the police to leave. The
town is considered a haven for traffickers.
   In San Borja, a cocaine trafficking center, police and U.S.
agents tried to confiscate airplanes that had small traces of
cocaine, but thousands of area residents forced them out.
   Cocaine corruption has reached high places in the Bolivian
government in years pase. A right-wing government installed after a
military coup in 1980 was backed by cocaine traffickers.
   Luis Arce Gomez, that government's minister of the interior, is
under indictment in Miami on drug trafficking charges.
   Bolivia's new president, Paz Zamora, says several hundred million
dollars is needed to combat the cocaine trade in Bolivia.
   ``We can win the war,'' he said, ``but we must change the focus
so that the war is backed by the people of the country.''

<HEAD>Will South American Farmers Switch from Coca to Coffee?</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Also in Monday AMs report.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   U.S. drug officials are concerned that a
disruption of cocaine production in Colombia because of the
government crackdown will raise cocaine prices in Peru and Bolivia
and make it harder to persuade farmers to switch from coca leaf to
other crops.
   An estimated 300,000 people in Bolivia depend on coca farming and
cocaine production for a livelihood. Coca leaf still provides a 100
percent profit to farmers and coca-leaf acreage increased by 20
percent in 1987-88, according to a U.S. State Department report.
   For farmers to stop growing coca leaves, viable alternative crops
must be found. But with the recent drop in the price of coffee _ a
crop suited for the tropics where coca is grown _ and the lack of
other profitable alternative crops, farmers prefer to grow coca,
which provides four crops a year and is easy to sell.
   The Bolivian government last year passed a law that limits
coca-leaf acreage. President Jaime Paz Zamora's government, which
was sworn in Aug. 6, says it will wage an all-out war against
traffickers.
   Coca-leaf reduction in Bolivia is moving ahead but slowly as the
new government implements an anti-drug strategy.
   Bolivian law calls for the reduction of 12,350 acres of coca land
by the end of the year in order to comply with a quota agreed upon
by the U.S. government. If the quota is not reached Bolivia stands
to loose $10 million in aid. This year so far only about 3,200 acres
have been destroyed.
   In Peru, coca leaf reduction programs in the 150-mile Huallaga
Valley, 300 miles northeast of Lima, have been temporarily suspended
because of threats to U.S. drug agents and the killing of Peruvian
officials.
   Coca farmers and traffickers in Peru have allied themselves with
insurgency groups, among them the Shining Path, and many coca-leaf
producing areas are off limits to law enforcement officials.
Eradiction and interdiction activities in the Huallaga Valley are
expected to resume this month when a secure base is completed in the
Santa Lucia area.
   Peru destroyed 12,670 acres of coca in just four months last year.
   Peru produces coca leaves on 285,600 acres. It is the main
supplier of paste for Colombian cocaine producers and distributors.

<TEXT>
   The old man smoothes his blue uniform
shirt and snaps to attention as a visitor approaches the
fortress-like Workers' Militia headquarters.
   Asked how long he has been a militiaman, Jozsef Szerepi smiles
broadly. ``Since the beginning,'' he says.
   Established by the Communists as the ``Iron Fist of the Party'' a
year after Soviet tanks crushed the 1956 Hungarian revolution, the
militia was for years the pride of the men who fought to defend
communism.
   But as Hungary prepares for the first free parliamentary
elections since the Communists consolidated power in 1947, the
militia is under orders from the Communist Party to transform itself
into an apolitical force.
   Political opposition groups question whether it can do so,
warning darkly that the 60,000-member militia could take to the
streets to keep the Communists in power should they lose in the June
elections.
   On the other side of the ideological spectrum, some hard-line
Communist militiamen complain bitterly of being betrayed, both by
the party and by their organization.
   Although the organization makes much of its role in providing
emergency help in floods, fires and other natural calamities, it
remains identified with the Soviet submachine gun that forms the
centerpiece of its emblem.
   A May survey of 700 Hungarians showed that between 77 percent and
84 percent of those polled favored the militia's dissolution.
   After endorsing the concept of multi-party democracy earlier this
year, the Hungarian Communist Party announced May 8 that it no
longer would control the militia.
   Militia officials say they are trying to reorganize into a force
that would take orders only from the government _ even a future
non-Communist government. But it's a daunting task.
   For more than three decades, militiamen have been required to
swear allegiance to ``the red flag of the international workers'
class,'' and to be prepared to give their lives to protect ``the
rule of the working class.''
   Militia spokesman Andras Zelenak acknowledged rank-and-file
discontent with Hungary's reform course, saying, ``Some members of
the Workers' Militia are stunned about what is going on in this
country.''
   Militiaman Ferenc Goenczoel agreed during an interview at
Zelenak's office, where busts of Lenin shared shelf space with books
on Marxist ideology.
   ``It is difficult to digest these great and quick changes,
because much is contrary to the ideological philosopy that we
brought with us,'' Goenczoel said. ``I cannot make an about face
from one day to the next.''
   Goenczoel, who said he had been a militiaman for more than two
decades, said disappointment in Hungary's present political course
is greatest among working class comrades-in-arms and those who
fought alongside Soviet troops in 1956.
   ``The older ones are most bitter _ even about the party, that it
left the Workers' Militia in the lurch,'' said Goenczoel.
   Many members felt most betrayed by the Communist leadership's
decision in February to abandon the 32-year terminology describing
the 1956 revolt. What officially had been a traitorous
counter-revolution suddenly became a popular uprising.
   Then, the leadership rehabilitated the revolution's leaders and
conducted their ceremonial reburial June 16, more than 30 years
after their execution as traitors.
   ``There was an outcry,'' Goenczoel said. ``It was most difficult
for the older members who fought on the barricades'' in 1956, he
said.
   Zelenak said some embittered members of the largely volunteer
force have resigned rather than accept the changes, but asserted the
militia could adapt to an emerging democracy.
   But anti-Communist political groups demanding abolition of the
Workers' Militia in pre-election negotiations with the Communists
are skeptical, saying the armed forces should be the only ones to
have weapons.
   Some even see parallels to Hitler's stormtroopers, who helped the
Nazi dictator to power.
   ``This Workers' Militia is a little bit like the stormtroopers in
Germany, a symbol of the totalitarian system,'' said opposition
figure Csaba Kiss.
   Kiss, spokesman of the Hungarian Democratic Forum, suggested that
Hungarian Communists could ``be waiting for the right moment'' _ a
conservative turn away from reform in the Soviet Union. The Workers'
Militia then could ``become the base for a reactionary turn at
home,'' he said.
   Militia members vehemently deny they would ever act against the
popular will or the legal government, although some radicals outside
the organization say they do not exclude the possibility of armed
insurrection to keep the Communists in power.
   Announcing the formation of a Marxist-Leninist Party Aug. 25,
self-styled spokesman Sandor Petres told the newspaper Mai Nap his
organization would not hesitate ``to seize weapons'' if the
elections exclude the working class from Parliament.
   Most analysts made light of his remarks and of his organization.
But the army apparently attached enough importance to the comments
to issue a statement expressing support of peaceful political change
in Hungary.

   Coventry and Dresden, devastated by World War II
bombing despite having no military significance, have come to
symbolize the chilling 20th-century concept of total war. Associated
Press reporters were in both cities on Sunday as residents gathered
at church services marking the war's 50th anniversary and shared,
via radio hookup, their grim past. Moving with this story is
PM-Dresden.

   Even today, nearly 50 years later, there
is a stillness at the heart of Coventry.
   Here stand the skeletal remains of its 700-year-old cathedral,
destroyed with the rest of the city center on Nov. 14, 1940, in the
longest, deadliest single bombing raid inflicted by Adolf Hitler on
a British city during World War II.
   There were armament plants in Coventry, but not in Cathedral
Square _ just buildings, shops and people, 568 of whom were killed.
   If Coventry represented a new 20th-century strategy known as
``total war,'' the Allies showed in February 1945 how far total war
could go when they bombed the equally unthreatening German city of
Dresden, killing 135,000 people.
   On Sunday, the 50th anniversary of Britain's declaration of war
on Germany, worshipers in Coventry and Dresden came together through
a British Broadcasting Corp. radio linkup, and they forgave each
other once again.
   ``The war which Germany started set the world alight and
destroyed your city,'' Pastor Christof Ziemer of the Kreuzkirche in
Dresden told the 500 Coventry worshipers over a loudspeaker in the
new cathedral built next to the ruins of the old.
   ``We are not minded to shake off the burden of our guilt. But you
have forgiven.''
   Canon Michael Sadgrove replied from Coventry: ``We too need to be
forgiven. We will not forget the firestorm that killed so many
thousands of your people.''
   ``Father forgive,'' intoned the congregation in Coventry.
   ``Vater Vergib,'' came the answering murmur in German from
Dresden.
   Most of the ruins of Coventry Cathedral were long ago arranged in
rows under the open sky: truncated pillars, a winding stairway that
once led to a pulpit but now leads nowhere.
   Only the 295-foot steeple survived intact, pointing skyward like
a remonstrating finger for the tourists who wander about in awed
silence.
   Before the inscription ``Father forgive,'' stands the replica of
a cross of two blackened wooden beams, lashed together in 1940 by a
Roman Catholic caretaker who pulled them from the ruins in a
spontaneous gesture of remembrance that became world famous.
   Elsewhere in Britain, people quietly marked the anniversary of
the war's outbreak without large-scale remembrances. Independent
Radio News broadcast war-era speeches of Adolf Hitler, Prime
Minister Neville Chamberlain, and 13-year-old Princess Elizabeth,
now the queen.
   Coventry today is a city of 303,000 people, 90 miles west of
London. It is best known for manufacturing the luxury Jaguar car.
   Many residents found the strength to forgive through the words of
Provost Dick Howard, who declared in a broadcast from the cathedral
ruins on Christmas 1940: ``We are trying, hard as it may be, to
banish all thoughts of revenge ... to make a kinder, simpler, more
Christchild-like sort of world in the days beyond this strife.''
   Preaching in Coventry Cathedral on Sunday, the Rev. Ulrike
Birkner of Dresden said it was Christ's example that gave men like
Howard ``the courage to make themselves unpopular by offering to
forgive.
   ``When enemies have become friends, when both sides have faced up
to their own sins, they can accept forgiveness and lay aside the
burden of guilt,'' she said.
   Ms. Birkner, who was born in Dresden shortly after the war,
recalled taking ``long tram rides with my parents through miles of
ruins, with only the tower of St. Anne's Church still standing, just
like the tower of your cathedral here in Coventry.''
   She remembered her uncle, a foreman on a Dresden reconstruction
site, bringing home young volunteers to help rebuild Dresden.
   They came from Coventry.

   The German town of Dresden and the English city
of Coventry were officially enemies, but their grim, eerily similar
fates during World War II have drawn them together on the 50th
anniversary of the beginnng of the great conflict. Citizens of both
cities gathered for church services that were joined by a radio
linkup to recall their towns' flaming destruction a half century ago.

   Once the jewel of Germany because of
its magnificent architecture, Dresden virtually burned to death a
half-century ago.
   For two days, Allied aircraft relentlessly bombed the city,
killing tens of thousands of people.
   In a solemn church service on Sunday, Dresden recalled the
firebombing and the Germans' own destruction of Coventry, England.
   Fifty years to the day after Britain entered the war, the people
and clergy of two cities spoke to each other via radio hookup and
shared their flaming pasts.
   ``We in Dresden, and you in Conventry ... we killed each others
people and we destroyed each others' cities,'' Rev. Christof Ziemer
told about 400 worshipers inside the Kruezkirche Lutheran Church and
500 others listening to his remarks inside Coventry Cathedral.
   ``We (Germans) are not minded to shake off the burden of our
guilt. But you have forgiven,'' he told his British listeners via
British Broadcasting Corp. hookup.
   Canon Paul Oestreicher of Coventry Cathedral told Dresden
residents he could never expect them to forget the firebombing of
Dresden in February 1945.
   ``When the war was practically over, and this city crowded with
refugees, British and American bombers turned it into a raging
inferno in which more women and children died than even in
Hiroshima,'' Oestreicher said.
   But Oestreicher also pointed out the horrors of the Nazi
Holocaust unleashed by the war that began when Hitler invaded Poland
on Sept. 1, 1939.
   ``I can't forget that many of my father's Jewish family were
killed in German gas chambers,'' said Oestreicher, who was born in
Germany but fled his homeland in 1939.
   An estimated 6 million Jews died in the Nazi Holocaust, many of
them gassed to death in German concentration camps.
   On Feb. 13-14 in 1945, combined Anglo-American bomber forces
attacked Dresden, creating a firestorm that destroyed the heart of
the city.
   Incendiary bombs set fire to wooden roofs that were hundreds of
years old. Heavy bombs created air suction that whipped up raging
balls of flames.
   Estimates of the dead range up to 135,000, many of them refugees
who had fled the Russian army that was rapidly advancing on Dresden,
93 miles south of Berlin.
   The skyline of this city of 500,000 still shows the marks of war,
such as the burned and gutted spires on the former Royal Palace.
   Downtown Dresden, once known for its lovely baroque and
Renaissance facades and spires, now has rows of post-war concrete
structures.
   Few of the city's old landmarks are still standing.
   Dresden and its destruction figured prominently in author Kurt
Vonnegut Jr.'s acclaimed 1969 novel, ``Slaughterhouse Five.''

   In this bastion of free enterprise and
profit-making, an industry is blossoming that cashes in on fear of
the coming takeover by Communist China.
   From marriage counselors to immigration consultants, thousands in
this British colony are capitalizing on a growing desperation about
1997 _ when Hong Kong comes under China's rule. Some appear to be
profiting illegally.
   Emigration industry specialists say hundreds of millions of
dollars are being spent by nervous residents who want to flee the
colony. And, they say, business is bound to improve.
   The June 4 crackdown on the pro-democracy movement in Beijing has
sparked more interest in emigration than ever before.
   Last year, 45,000 people left Hong Kong, mostly for the United
States, Canada and Australia. The number is expected to rise this
year.
   A survey in August said two out of every five residents want to
emigrate, indicating few among the colony's 5.7 million people
believe in China's promise to maintain Hong Kong's economic system
for at least 50 years.
   On a recent weekend at the Hong Kong Convention Center, about
50,000 people packed a show on overseas investment and immigration
opportunities.
   Australian women sporting bright blue 10-gallon hats hawked
houses in Perth. Videos showed sandpipers speeding down a Uruguayan
beach and told of the wonders of investing in that Latin American
country. A movie beckoned, ``Come to New Zealand and be free.''
   One consultant's Chinese sign promised a Peruvian passport for
$1,500 and 20 days in Lima. The Peruvian Consulate said it was
impossible.
   Another consultant was selling $100,000 investments in the United
States, although America does not accept business immigrants.
   ``There's always a window,'' said former chemist Junny Co, with a
wry smile and a wink as he passed out leaflets with the investment
information. ``I'm selling the American dream.''
   Surveying the crowd, Peter Tse, a real estate agent for an
Australian company, heaved a sigh.
   ``There's a sucker born every minute,'' he said. ``I'm just
selling houses. But the consultants, they're exploiting fear.''
   Indeed, in the immigration industry consultants are the big
money-makers, charging as much as $50,000 for a successful case.
   Consultants help prospective emigrants fill out forms, draw up
business proposals and determine whether they have the necessary
credentials to emigrate.
   Since January, the ranks of Hong Kong-based consultants have
swollen to 600, a 100 percent jump, according to Alex Lee, an
advertising executive at Saleslink Ltd., which co-sponsored the
convention. Hundreds more, including American lawyers, added to the
flock when they set up temporary shop in hotel rooms around the
colony.
   At the conference, Jagson Cheu elbowed his way out of a booth run
by a New Zealand investment company.
   ``They want all my money just to go to the bottom of the world, I
can't believe it,'' said the securities trader. ``But I don't have a
choice, I need help. Right now I'm just looking for the cheapest
thief.''
   Despite dozens of complaints of fraud to the Hong Kong Consumer
Council, the government does not monitor the industry and there is
practically no way to sue a consultant.
   Horatio Cheung, who runs the only non-profit consultancy in the
colony, tells of 290 people who were denied Canadian citizenship
after being bilked out of thousands of dollars by a consultant who
tried to get around Canada's residency requirement.
   Earlier this year, Royal Canadian Mounted Police raided a law
firm in Toronto and several Canadian lawyers have been charged with
perjury and other crimes in connection with illegal immigration
practices.
   Those who can't afford a consultant are going back to school to
get necessary skills to emigrate. Some countries, like Australia,
welcome certain workers, such as pastry chefs and carpenters.
Singapore, which is facing a labor shortage, recently lowered its
standards for immigrants, sparking 30,000 Hong Kong residents to mob
the application office.
   But competition for seats in Hong Kong's few universities is
intense. The Open Learning Institute, Hong Kong's newest
college-level facility, recently received 60,000 applications for
5,000 spots for the upcoming school year. The government-run school
made about $380,000 from applications alone.
   Fears about the takeover have also helped Hong Kong's matchmaking
industry.
   Maria Mo, manager of the International Computer Marriage
Consulting agency, says clients looking for a spouse with a foreign
passport have increased by 50 percent since June 4. Her company now
gets up to 200 inquiries a month and charges at least $1,000 for
completed marriages.
   R. Shek, who is looking for a Western husband, said the crackdown
made her want to leave Hong Kong as soon as possible.
   ``Hong Kong life used to be peaceful,'' said Shek, an executive
secretary at an international firm, ``but now it's time to leave. I
don't have enough money to buy a passport so marriage to a Westerner
is the best route for me.''
   But this sector, too, is tainted by suspect practices. One
matchmaker showed letters from foreign men to his office, offering
marriage for a ``reasonable price,'' or $35,000.
   The immigration business has spawned its own service industry
with TV and radio talk shows, newspapers and magazines.
   The Emigrant magazine started last year and now boasts 14,000
subscribers and a thick advertisement section, pushing land in
Jamaica, passports in Latin America and factories in South Africa.
   ``We have people in line at all hours buying back issues,''
Editor Katherine Kreuter said. ``This is definitely a growth
industry.''

   The opposition has chosen its
candidates and approved a platform, and its challenge now is to
stick together to beat the ruling Sandinistas in February elections.
   But cracks showed in the 14-party National Opposition Union
coalition just minutes after Violeta Barrios de Chamorro and
Virgilio Godoy were chosen as its presidential and vice presidential
candidates late Saturday.
   The Chamorro-Godoy ticket was approved with the minimum 10 votes
out of a possible 14 after five rounds of voting Saturday. The
balloting followed another five rounds on Thursday.
   Three parties pushing businessman Enrique Bolanos for the vice
presidential slot abstained in the final vote, and one party's
ballot was annulled.
   All 14 parties signed a document committing themselves to support
the winning ticket.
   But the representative of the National Conservative Party, one of
the three abstaining, was heard to say shortly after the meeting
ended that his group might split from the coalition.
   If one party drifts away from the Opposition Union and others
follow, the opposition's dream of defeating the Sandinistas likely
will collapse.
   Parties within the coalition reportedly have acknowledged that
only by uniting might they defeat the Sandinista National Liberation
Front.
   But merging the 14 parties of the traditionally fractious
Nicaraguan opposition into a common front is already a substantial
achievement. The parties range from communists to conservatives.
   Of the 21 parties legally registered for the Feb. 25 balloting,
three others have nominated their own candidates. But they are not
considered a major factor.
   The real squaring off will be between the Opposition Union and
the Sandinista Front.
   The Sandinistas' biggest advantage is that they are in power, in
a country where the line separating the government party and the
state apparatus is blurred at best.
   Government vehicles are used to transport people to Sandinista
rallies, and public employees are expected to show up at
``spontaneous'' protests and ``consciousness-raising meetings'' or
risk losing their jobs.
   In addition to using government resources for party purposes, the
Sandinistas are superbly organized and disciplined at every level of
the national structure.
   Bickering and infighting, on the other hand, have characterized
the Nicaraguan opposition. Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo, the only
prominent Nicaraguan figure whose following crosses party and social
lines, often calls on politicians to ``leave behind personal
interest and look out for the good of the whole nation.''
   The coalition still must decide how candidacies for provincial
and local posts will be distributed, something that is likely to
bring into play the parties' regional power.
   They also must agree on how they will run for the 96 seats in the
unicameral national legislature.
   Mrs. Chamorro was an ideal choice for the Opposition Union
presidential candidate. She is a unifying symbol for the
wide-ranging coalition.
   The Jan. 10, 1978 assassination of her husband, Pedro Joaquin
Chamorro, a newspaper publisher and foe of late President Anastasio
Somoza, helped draw the country together in support of the
Sandinista revolution.
   Mrs. Chamorro is seen as a strong supporter of democracy and is
widely recognized at home and abroad.
   She publishes the family newspaper, La Prensa, which now is a
strong critic of the Sandinistas, who ousted Somoza in July 1979.
   Mrs. Chamorro is not known to belong to a party and is weak on
political experience and administrative expertise. Her upper-class
background had to be balanced with a running mate more appealing to
the center and left.
   Bolanos would have made the ticket too right-wing to attract
widespread support.
   That's where Godoy came in. Godoy is a deft center-left
politician with long experience in Nicaraguan politics and public
administration.
   For the past 10 years he has been president of the centrist
Independent Liberal Party. He was a professor and dean of the
Sociology Department at the Nicaraguan National Autonomous
University for 14 years.
   The criticism against the 55-year-old lawyer stems from his
tenure as labor minister under the Sandinistas from July 19, 1979,
until March 31, 1984, and from what some have called an abrasive and
arrogant personality.

   Prince Charles has renewed his attacks on soulless
modern buildings, writing that architects are creating
Frankenstein's monsters.
   The fashionable architectural theories of the 1950s and 1960s
have spawned ``deformed monsters which have come to haunt our towns
and cities, our villages and our countryside,'' the prince said in
``A Vision of Britain,'' as excerpted in the Sunday Times.
   The 40-year-old heir to the British throne has harshly criticized
modern buildings that he believes fail to meet the needs of the
people who must live and work in them.
   ``As a result of 30 years of experimenting with revolutionary
building materials and novel ideas, burning all the rulebooks and
purveying the theory that man is a machine, we have ended up with
Frankenstein monsters, devoid of character, alien and largely
unloved, except by the professors who have been concocting these
horrors in their laboratories _ and even they find their creations a
bit hard to take after a while,'' the excerpt said.
   The book is to be published in Britain on Thursday by Doubleday.

   The Who is winding up its 25th anniversary tour on
a harmonious note for a change, singer Roger Daltrey says.
   ``We've ended up friends, which is great for us. That's a real
triumph. It was not a happy ending in 1982, but it feels great
now,'' Daltrey said of the rock group, whose members have argued and
brawled through the years.
   The Who's performance Saturday was the finale to a day-long party
at the Astrodome sponsored by Miller beer. The band played Sunday
night at a similar party in Dallas, drawing 45,000 people to the
72,000-capacity Cotton Bowl on a hot, humid day.
   At a preconcert news conference Saturday with band members and
party pitchman Randy Quaid, Daltrey dismissed criticism of the
association of beer parties with charity. Miller has committed $1
million from the parties' proceeds to the Texas Special Olympics.
   ``As long as we're raising money for charity, we'd consider
anything. That's the main reason we're here,'' he said.
   A Special Olympics participant, 31-year-old Kevin Maples,
presented Quaid and The Who with gold medals he won in competition.
Who guitarist and songwriter Pete Townshend gave Maples an electric
guitar autographed by the group members.

   Though nearing retirement at age 34, tennis star
Chris Evert was able to wear down a 15-year-old opponent to reach
the quarterfinals of the U.S. Open for the 19th straight year.
   Evert, a six-time winner of the tournament who says this is her
last Open, sent Monica Seles chasing balls from corner to corner
Sunday in rallies that sometimes lasted more than 50 shots, and won
6-0, 6-2.
   ``I don't know where it came from,'' Evert said. ``I haven't seen
that form all year.''
   Martina Navratilova said she knew the fourth-seeded Evert, her
longtime friend and rival, would be ``totally psyched'' to beat
12th-seeded Seles.
   ``I knew she was not going to lose to Seles today,'' Navratilova
said. ``It's nothing against Monica, she's a nice girl, but I knew
she would not lose to a youngster like that in a round like that.''

   Actress Zsa Zsa Gabor, preparing for trial
next week on charges she slapped a policeman, has selected her
courtroom outfit: a black Valentino designer dress, black hat and
pearls.
   Miss Gabor claims the Beverly Hills motorcycle officer roughed
her up June 14 after stopping her Rolls-Royce convertible.
   ``I tell you mainly why I go to trial: that this shouldn't happen
to other women,'' Miss Gabor said during an interview last week at
her Bel-Air mansion.
   ``They wanted to drop all the charges. And the funny part is they
wanted to make, how do you call, civic work for 100 hours. And this
guy (Rob Lowe) who had pornographic movies, he only got 20 hours''
of community service.
   Miss Gabor is charged with battery on a policeman, disobeying an
officer, driving with an expired license, having an open container
of alcohol in her car and having expired car registration. If
convicted, she could be sentenced to two years in prison.
   Miss Gabor, a former Miss Hungary, is married to her eighth
husband, Prince Frederick von Anhalt, Germany's Duke of Saxony. In
addition to her movie roles, she has written two books about men and
started cosmetics and jewelry businesses. In October, she will star
as the owner of an animal beauty parlor in ``Animal Haven.''

<HEAD>Parking Lot `Attendant' Finds Windfall</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A homeless man has landed on Free Parking
outside the Philadelphia Museum of Art by charging drivers for spots
that should be free.
   Much to the annoyance of police, motorists and museum officials,
Eugene Harris charges drivers $3 to $5 and even hands them a stub.
   He sees himself as an entrepreneur.
   ``Look,'' he said last week, ``nothing's free in Philadelphia,
right? This isn't like theft or anything. I can make $300 on a good
day.''
   Police say the 27-year-old Harris is a ripoff artist. They've
arrested him three times during the past month on charges including
resisting arrest. But they've had problems prosecuting.
   ``We can't seem to get anybody to press charges, and the few
times we have, we have trouble getting higher-ups to prosecute,''
said police Capt. Larry Norton. He said the latter is partly due to
the prevalence of more serious crime and a cap on jail admissions
because of crowding.
   Harris, who sleeps at a railroad station near the museum, carries
ticket stubs that he picks up from other parking lots, and gives
them to his customers.
   ``Almost nobody turns me down,'' he said. ``People expect to pay
for parking anyway. The ticket stubs? They help the image. Look, a
couple of years ago the city used to charge for this lot, so I just
sort of took over.''
   Harris figures has made several thousand dollars with the parking
lot during the past year or so.
   He even has charged new museum security guards $5 to park in the
lot before they found out it was free.
   ``We've been getting five to 10 complaints a day for months about
him _ it's an embarrassment, an outrage, a disgrace, that people
from here and from all over the country are getting ripped off this
way,'' said Michael J. Dougherty, the museum's assistant security
manager.
   Police and the museum say Harris walks around the lot directing
motorists into parking spaces, then charges them. He raises his fee
to $5 for major art exhibitions and often uses a helper on busy
weekend days, according to Dougherty.
   Jan Wechsler, of Narberth, said she was charged $3 before she
realized that Harris was too ``grubby'' to be a parking-lot
attendant.
   ``I said, `There's never been a parking fee here before' and he
said, `Lady, nothing's free in Philadelphia.'''
   She said he then tried to rip off a Japanese tourist, who was
then told by another person not to pay.
   Harris said he knows he's not at the top of the list of police
targets.
   ``I know the system _ I guess I might serve a little time some
day, but they keep letting me go,'' he told The Philadelphia
Inquirer.

<TEXT>
   Two U.S. C-130 transport planes flew into
Bogota Sunday, marking the beginning of the delivery of $65 million
in U.S. military aid to combat drug traffickers.
   An explosion ripped through four businesses near the cocaine
capital of Medellin Sunday night, wounding at least three people,
the Colombian radio network RCN said.
   The bomb in Itagui, just south of Medellin, damaged a bank, an
insurance company's office, a shoe store and an optical shop, an
Itagui police spokesman told the Associated Press in a telephone
interview. The spokesman asked to remain anonymous.
   No one immediately claimed responsibility for the bombing, but it
followed the method of terror that drug traffickers have employed in
Medellin where they have set off bombs at banks and other businesses.
   Two small bombs exploded Sunday night in front of the
Intercontinental Hotel in Medellin but no one was hurt, police said.
   Also Sunday, President Virigilo Barco replaced the chief of the
anti-drug effort in Medellin. A source said he was ousted for having
dealings with drug lords but officials denied such reports.
   U.S. Ambassador Thomas McNamara, at the Bogota military air base
where the C130s landed, said the planes ``are in excellent condition
and should serve the Colombian armed forces for many years.''
   The commander of Colombia's air force, Gen. Alfonso Amaya
Maldonado, said the C-130s ``will be used in the fight in which we
are engaged ... to re-establish order.''
   In Washington, White House Chief of Staff John Sununu told CBS'
``Face the Nation'' that if Colombia requests more assistance,
President Bush probably would order American troops to take an
active role in fighting Colombia's drug lords.
   McNamara said the transport planes, from National Guard bases in
Louisville, Ky., and Martinsburg, W. Va., brought spare parts for
eight A-37 observation and attack aircraft the United States expects
to deliver Monday in the Caribbean port of Barranquilla.
   Three American crewmen, all dressed in olive-green flight suits,
disembarked from each plane.
   An AP photographer who peered through the opened tailgate of one
of the C-130s said it contained large crates covered by plastic and
nets.
   Five UH-1H transport helicopters are to arrive Tuesday, the
ambassador said.
   Washington has said as many as 200 American military personnel
may come to Colombia to assist security forces in installing and
operating the American equipment. This is a potential sore point, as
Colombian officials have said they don't want American troops.
   McNamara told reporters, ``Right now I don't have an exact
number'' of American advisers in Colombia but it is ``very few.''
   ``Coming in ... will be a few ground crews to handle the
aircraft. These crews will be here for a few hours or days,'' he
said. ``We will have a few trainers come in and assist with the
transfer of the equipment and the training'' of Colombians.
   The United States also has promised Colombia rifles, pistols,
machine guns, rockets, grenades and even bulletproof vests for
Colombian officials and judges who prosecute drug traffickers.
   The four-engine C-130s can take off and land on 3,000-foot
runways, even dirt airstrips, and could be used in raids on remote
coca-leaf plantations and refining laboratories.
   The government gave no reason for removing police Col. Antonio
Sanchez as chief of a special 4,000-member anti-drug unit in
Medellin. A source at national police headquarters in Bogota,
speaking on condition of anonymity, said he was ousted for dealing
with drug traffickers.
   But in a telephone interview with the Associated Press, Sanchez
said the report that he had been relieved of command for alleged
links to drug traffickers was ``absolutely false.''
   The chief of national police, Gen. Miguel Gomez Padilla, said
Sanchez was under no suspicion or investigation and was merely being
transferred to headquarters in Bogota.
   Barco, who has vowed not to back down from the cocaine bosses,
also on Sunday took a helicopter flight over the wreckage of the
Bogota newspaper El Espectador, which on Saturday was bombed by
drug-cartel terrorists.
   Eighty-four people were injured in the blast. The paper printed a
smaller edition from a makeshift newsroom.
   ``We will continue moving forward!'' the front page proclaimed.
``In its 102 years, El Espectador has always gone ahead, overcoming
all adversities,'' said the paper, whose publisher was assassinated
in 1986 by drug traffickers.
   The drug cartels, which last month assassinated Colombia's
leading presidential candidate and also the top police official in
the cocaine center of Medellin, have declared ``total and absolute
war'' against the government.

<HEAD>Poll Finds Strong Support for Raising Minimum Wage</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GARY LANGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans overwhelmingly favor an increase in the
federal minimum wage, even though most workers are generally
satisfied with their pay, a national poll has found.
   Nearly nine in 10 respondents to the Media General-Associated
Press poll wanted the hourly miniumum raised from $3.35, and
two-thirds of them favored the $4.55 minimum approved by Congress
but vetoed by President Bush in June.
   At the same time, six in 10 supported Bush's proposal for a
``training wage'' under which new workers could be kept at $3.35 for
their first six months on the job. Congress has not adopted that
plan.
   On other workplace issues this Labor Day, nearly four in 10
respondents said they would join a labor union at their workplace,
even though most regarded management more favorably than they viewed
unions.
   Most workers gave favorable ratings to their salaries, job
conditions and time off, the survey found. But pensions were a sore
point, and more than a third were unhappy with their pay.
   In a Gallup Poll, meanwhile, most full-time American workers said
they were satisfied with their jobs. Twenty-eight percent said they
were completely satisfied with their job and 60 percent said they
were mostly satisfied, while 3 percent said they were completely
dissatisfied.
   Many of the 1,163 adult respondents to the Media
General-Associated Press poll saw unions as weakening, and few
objected to that trend. Still, 49 percent said workers are better
off with a union, while 31 percent disagreed.
   Overall, 47 percent said they were unwilling to join a union,
while 37 percent said they would join one. Seven in 10 favored
so-called right-to-work laws, which ban mandatory union membership.
And while 44 percent had a favorable opinion of unions, 64 percent
thought favorably of management.
   Rating their own circumstances at work, respondents gave top
grades to the safety of their workplace _ 87 percent said excellent
or good _ and overall working conditions, with 81 percent favorable.
   Nearly seven in 10 were happy with their time off, 61 percent
rated their health benefits favorably and 60 percent said their
salary was excellent or good, as opposed to fair or poor.
   Pension benefits received the lowest ratings. Of those with an
opinion, just 46 percent viewed their pension plans favorably, while
41 percent were dissatisfied. A quarter called their pension
benefits poor.
   But benefits were not the prime concern: Fifty-four percent said
they would prefer better wages to better benefits. Just 15 percent
said their salaries were excellent.
   White-collar, management employees were less concerned with
wages: Seven in 10 rated their salaries favorably, compared with 57
percent of blue-collar workers and of non-management white collar
workers.
   While 83 percent of union members said that workers are better
off with unions, 46 percent of management employees said that
workers are better off non-unionized.
   Southerners also were more dubious of unions _ they divided about
evenly on the question. More than half of the respondents ages 18-29
and those over 64 said workers are better off with unions.
   Union membership, declining over the years, now accounts for just
under 17 percent of the workforce.
   Among respondents who are not union workers now, 38 percent in
the youngest group ruled out joining a union. That rose to about 50
percent of the older groups.
   Forty-three percent overall said unions are getting weaker and
just 15 percent said they are getting stronger. Still, 33 percent
said unions are too strong, while 20 percent said they are too weak.
   The poll was conducted by telephone in July. It had a margin of
error of plus or minus 3 points for all respondents and 4 points for
the 812 who were employed full time or part time.
   The Gallup Poll also was conducted in July. It questioned 697
adults employed full time and had a 4-point margin of error.

   This Media General-Associated Press poll is based
on telephone interviews July 7-16 with 1,163 adults in the
continental United States. Phone numbers were selected randomly and
interviews were conducted with the adult who had the most recent
birthday, a random phenomenon.
   The results were weighted to adjust for variations in the sample.
The poll has a 3-point margin of error, meaning that 19 of 20 times
its findings should be within 3 points of the result if every adult
American were asked the same questions. The error margin is larger
for subgroups _ 4 points for respondents who held jobs, for example,
and 6 points for those age 18-29.
   There are other sources of potential error in polls, including
the wording and order of questions. These are the questions in this
poll; because of rounding, sums may not total 100:
   1. The minimum wage has been $3.35 per hour since January 1981.
Do you think it should be increased, or not? Yes: 87 percent. No: 10
percent. Don't know or no answer: 3 percent.
   2. (If yes) One plan would raise the minimum wage to $4.55 per
hour over a three-year period. Another plan would raise it to $4.25
over three years. Which do you prefer _ a $4.55 minimum wage or a
$4.25 minimum wage. $4.55: 64. $4.25: 33. DK-NA: 3.
   3. (If yes to No. 1) One plan would include a training wage _
meaning that new workers could be kept at the current $3.35 minimum
wage for their first six months on the job. Do you support or oppose

<HEAD>Minister Helps Youth Fill Leisure Time With Positive Visions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TAMARA HENRY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Young people need help to break the ``cycle of
negative choices'' in their lives, says a minister who is lining up
positive role models for youths living in the drug-infested,
violence-wracked nation's capital.
   The result is the youth group ``Lean On Me,'' which recently
completed a month-long experimental run financed mainly by the Rev.
Elwood Gray and a few friends.
   ``I feel that education is a community responsibility,'' said
Gray. ``A child doesn't know if he wants to be an attorney, preacher
or medical doctor.
   ``But just imagine in your own life if you were 11 or 12 years
old and you would go to a place where there was an attorney, a
physician, a teacher or a preacher, and you had a chance to sit and
question them about real life.''
   Armed with evidence of the group's initial success _ mainly
anecdotal reports from dozens of the adolescents and teenagers who
attended _ Gray is beginning plans for a permanent organization.
   At the last meeting of the summer, 14-year-old Michael Smith said
he enjoyed the opportunity to chat with Rick Sanders, of a local
radio station, about the importance of setting career goals and with
Angele Moss, a prison psychologist, about developing and maintaining
positive self-esteem.
   The discussions, held at Howard University, turned into a
free-for-all.
   ``Do you ever feel sometimes like you're about to go crazy?''
asked Michael, prompting Ms. Moss to smile and the other youngsters
to giggle.
   Describing the pressures on today's youth, Ms. Moss assured the
youngster his feelings are natural.
   The District of Columbia is the nation's murder capital, with the
death toll reaching 304 as of Monday, compared with 219 at the same
time last year. Officer Quintin Peterson said 29 of the homicide
victims were under age 18. Other statistics show that 75 percent to
80 percent of the homicides were drug-related.
   The city had a record 372 homicides in 1988.
   Gray is adamant about the need to provide positive role models
for black children.
   ``We are not talking about ex-offenders, ex-drug addicts to move
in and talk to the kids,'' said Gray who has worked for 10 years as
a chaplain at the Lorton correctional complex in Virginia.
   ``We are not proclaiming `Say No to Drugs.' We don't have
anything against those but what we are doing is we are giving them
positive choices so they can make positive selections. We need to
give young people positive options. Don't tell them what not to do,
tell them what to do,'' he said.
   Gray also wants to teach youngsters to use their leisure time in
positive ways.
   ``Metropolitan areas throughout America struggle with problems
regarding their youth making positive use of their leisure time,''
said Gray.
   A recent survey of adolescents in Minnesota found that for whites
20 percent of above-average students had alcohol problems but almost
50 percent of below-average students abused alcohol; only 5 percent
of above-average female students were at serious risk for pregnancy
because of their behavior while 21 percent of below-average females
were similarly at risk.
   ``For many youth in our area, life is a series of failures and
they are trapped in a cycle of negative and unproductive choices,''
said Gray.
   ```Lean On Me' will provide positive alternatives presented by
role models ... in order to break this cycle of negative choices and
unproductive use of leisure time,'' Gray said, adding that the group
will provide ``a supportive network to facilitate the involvement of
community volunteers who want to make a difference in the lives of
our young people.''

<HEAD>Army Begins Expanded Drug Testing Program</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Army is expanding its drug testing program
to include checks for use of speed, morphine and angel dust, amid
Pentagon boasts that drug use already has dropped sharply in recent
years.
   Although there is little evidence that such drugs are being used
widely by enlisted personnel or officers, Army officials say the top
brass wants the tests as a new deterrent against drug use.
   Since 1981, all active-duty military personnel have been subject
to random urinalysis tests to check for the abuse of cocaine and
THC, the active ingredient in marijuana and hashish.
   The testing was later broadened to include the Army reserves and
National Guard, and severe penalties were imposed.
   Since July, the Army's five drug testing laboratories have added
a new test at an expected cost of $1 million to $2 million per year,
according to Donna Smith, head of the Army's alcohol and drug policy
unit.
   ``The army leadership made the decision ... that we wanted to
have a greater capability for deterrence, so that soldiers knew that
(if they use drugs) they are going to be at risk for the
consequences,'' Mrs. Smith said.
   The new tests will include checks against opiates such as
morphine and codeine; amphetamines such as speed; and phenclydine,
more commonly known as PCP or angel dust, said Army spokeswoman
Paige Eversol.
   ``Everyone can be expected to be tested at least once a year,''
Ms. Eversol said. ``We mean business.''
   Drug use by military personnel already has dropped dramatically
in recent years, officials say.
   Steve Duncan, assistant secretary of defense in charge of drug
policy, said about 27 percent of the military forces overall tested
positive for drug use in 1980, but last year the number was down to
4.8 percent.
   In the Army, Mrs. Smith said, ``In 1983, 10 percent of all
samples that we sent to the laboratory were positive. In 1988, less
than 2 percent of all samples come back that way.''
   Not every sample among the 758,000-strong Army force will be
tested for all the drugs, she said, adding that the new tests will
be conducted on a rotating basis.
   Soldiers in a unit that has been tested will not know which of
the three newly added drug tests will be conducted on their samples.
   But since some of the new drugs included in the tests can be
obtained with legally prescribed medications, soldiers who test
positive for those drugs must be evaluated by a military physician
to see if the drug use was proper, Mrs. Eversol said.
   The Army began the broader testing more as a preventive measure
than because of any evidence that use of heroin, amphetamines or
angel dust is particularly high, Mrs. Smith said.
   In fact, she noted, spot tests have shown that use of such drugs
has not been ``above one-half of 1 percent ... of the specimens that
we have tested for that drug.''
   But the military leadership intends for the military to be
drug-free, Ms. Smith said.
   Army policy requires every officer or non-commissioned officer
who has a single positive drug test to be processed for discharge
from the service.
   An enlisted soldier who tests positive once is offered a chance
for counseling and rehabilitation. But a soldier who tests positive
a second time must be kicked out of the service, she said.
   Any soldier who is diagnosed as dependent upon a drug also must
be discharged, she said, adding, ``The Army program is not designed
to rehabilitate the addict, it's designed to rehabilitate the user.''
   In the 1988 fiscal year, some 4,600 soldiers were kicked out for
drug-related offenses, Ms. Eversol said.

   A man who lost his wallet off the New
Hampshire coast got lucky when another angler hooked it during a
bluefish tournament.
   Randy Lindquist said he had given up hope of ever seeing the
billfold again when he received a call informing him that his wallet
had been found _ complete with credit cards, driver's license and
$93 in cash.
   ``I had better odds hitting the Megabucks lottery than ever
seeing that wallet again,'' said Lindquist, 31, of Randolph.
   He said the wallet was returned one day later by Dennis Murphy of
New Castle, N.H.
   Murphy hooked it with a lure on Aug. 26, six days after it was
lost.
   ``We were just fishing and we caught it. It's a little strange,''
said Murphy's 23-year-old son, Jim. ``You'd think a wallet with all
the cards he had in there would get soaked and sink down.''
   Lindquist said Murphy would not take a reward, but offered to go
bluefishing with him someday.

<HEAD>Capital Girds for Renewal of Fight Over Obscene Arts Funding Ban</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress faces a host of billion-dollar
spending decisions this fall, but a dispute over art and obscenity
is directing much of the attention toward a relatively small
appropriation for the arts.
   Lobbyists are waiting with blunt messages for legislators who
return to the Capitol this week from a month-long summer vacation.
   ``Make no mistake about it,'' warned a letter sent to lawmakers
by Paul Weyrich, chairman of a coalition of conservative groups.
``If you vote to block the (Rep. Dana) Rohrabacher amendment, we
will alert our members that you are on record as supporting
tax-sponsored pornography.''
   Rohrabacher, a California Republican, wants the House to adopt
Senate-passed restrictions that bar federal funding for art that is
deemed ``obscene or indecent'' or ``denigrates, debases or reviles''
people's beliefs based on religion, sex, race, creed, handicap, age
or national origin.
   ``The word we're putting out is not to let up at all,'' said Dean
Amhaus, senior associate of the American Council for the Arts, a
non-profit arts organization working to defeat the proposed limit.
   The provision, sponsored by Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., is part of
a $10.9 billion measure to finance the Interior Department and
several other agencies during the upcoming fiscal year. The Senate
passed it on a voice vote on July 26.
   Helms' wrath was triggered by $45,000 the National Endowment for
the Arts spent from its $170 million budget to support exhibits by
two controversial photographers. One by Robert Mapplethorpe depicted
homosexual and sadomasochistic acts. Another by Andres Serrano
showed a crucifix in a container of urine.
   The Senate provision imposes a five-year ban on funding two art
groups that sponsored grants to Mapplethorpe and Serrano.
   The Helms provision is not in the House version of the bill, so
the Senate and House must find mutually agreeable language before
sending it to President Bush for his signature.
   ``Free speech does not require us to spend tax dollars to
subsidize such photos,'' says a radio commercial for Helms' 1990
re-election campaign aired across North Carolina two weeks ago. The
ad said Mapplethorpe's works were guilty of ``sexually exploiting
young children,'' and described him as an avant garde artist who
died recently of AIDS.
   General Manager Bryan McIntyre of Raleigh, N.C., radio station
WPTF-AM, which ran the commercials, estimates that three-fourths of
the telephone calls the station received about the ads supported
Helms.
   Rohrabacher said that in his Long Beach, Calif.-centered
district, support for his position is 95 percent. Opponents are
merely a ``vocal minority,'' he said.
   Rohrabacher faces an uphill fight in the House, which
overwhelmingly rejected efforts to slash the arts endowment's budget
in retribution for the Mapplethorpe and Serrano exhibits. The House
instead voted to cut the endowment's coffers by $45,000, the amount
spent on the two artists.
   Opponents of Helms' proposal say they believe the public is on
their side when they argue that the government should not censor art
projects.
   ``The larger question of state control is much more onerous than
the possibility that from time to time some piece of art offends,''
says Anne Murphy, executive director of the American Arts Alliance,
a non-profit advocacy group for the nation's art institutions.
   Other budget issues facing Congress when it resumes work
Wednesday are:
   _Final passage of all 13 annual spending bills for federal
agencies for fiscal 1990.
   _An effort by Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., to extend a
House-passed permanent ban on smoking on airline flights of two
hours or less to longer routes. The measure is part of the
transportation spending bill.
   _Completion of a bill providing $13 billion in savings through a
combination of spending cuts and new tax receipts. It is still
unclear what taxes will be involved, but a cut in the capital gains
rate _ which supporters say would spark the economy and boost
receipts _ is possible. Passage would probably enable Congress to
obey the Gramm-Rudman law's projected 1990 deficit target of $110
billion.
   _Extension of the government's authority to borrow money, which
expires Oct. 15. The must-pass bill is expected to attract numerous
budget-process revision amendments.

<HEAD>Curiosity Seekers, Vendors Add Color to PTL Trial</HEAD>

   For now, the show is over.
   The suspension of Jim Bakker's fraud and conspiracy trial last
week also halted a sideshow by impersonators and vendors hoping to
make a few bucks off the misfortunes of the fallen PTL leader and
his wife, Tammy Faye.
   Throngs of curiosity-seekers dispersed after Bakker suffered a
breakdown and was sent away Thursday for psychiatric tests at the
federal prison hospital in Butner.
   Dr. Sally Johnson, who also evaluated presidential assailant John
Hinckley Jr., is leading a team conducting tests to determine
Bakker's competency to stand trial, said Bryan Bledsoe, executive
assistant to the warden.
   An hour before Bakker's U.S. District Court trial started a week
ago today, a chauffeur-driven Cadillac marked ``Jim and Tammy PTL
Limousine'' pulled up to the courthouse. The chauffeur hopped out
and opened the car's door to let out two people who appeared from a
distance to be Jim and Tammy Bakker.
   Jeff and Lucille Thompson of Charlotte were wearing rubberJim and
Tammy masks and expensive-looking clothes and jewelry. A minute
later, the impersonators climbed back into their limousine and left.
   Then there was Lida Lee Pink and her cousin Paul, who said they
drove from Topsy, Tenn., to peddle homemade Bible Belts _ tiny black
booklets that contained a few Bible verses and were attached by
Velcro to belts made of black seat-belt webbing. The belts were
offered for $22.39, including tax, postage and handling. However,
Ms. Pink said no one was buying them.
   Larry Starnes and Jerry Lowrance of Gastonia hawked recordings of
their PTL Song from underneath a beach umbrella. Lowrance said he
produced the country-tacky parody in 1986.
   For nearly two days until they were persuaded to stop, they
played the song from a portable tape recorder over and over: ``To
avoid that trip to Hell, join the P-T-L.''
   Judge Robert Potter had ordered marshals to keep the spectator
sideshow off the courthouse's spacious grounds, so the commotion was
limited to sidewalks and did not filter into the courtroom.
   Bakker, 49, is accused of using nearly $4 million in ministry
funds to finance a lavish lifestyle. If convicted, he could be
sentenced to 120 years in prison and fined more than $5 million.
   He was committed to Butner after psychiatrist Dr. Basil Jackson
testified Bakker was hallucinating and hiding his head under a couch
in his attorney's office.
   Potter suspended the trial at least until Wednesday, telling the
jury nothing about Bakker's condition.

<HEAD>Tiny Cub Dies After 39-Hour Fight Against Infection</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   National Zoo officials are turning their hopes
for a successful panda cub birth to next year, following the death
of female panda Ling-Ling's fifth cub from an infection.
   The unnamed male cub died Sunday after 39 hours of fighting the
infection transmitted from its mother, zoo officials said.
   Although Ling-Ling is 20 years old _ the oldest panda surviving
in any zoo _ there have been cases in China where pandas older
Ling-Ling have given birth, said zoo director Michael Robinson.
   ``Behaviorally, Ling-Ling has shown every indication of being an
excellent mother,'' Robinson said.
   ``We're not doing this out of any whim or whimsy ... We're doing
it to save a species,'' Robinson said.
   ``We'll face next year with more knowledge and experience than
ever before,'' said Lisa Stevens, manager in charge of the zoo's
Panda House.
   As her human handlers recounted Ling-Ling's latest travails at a
news conference Sunday, the black-and-white animal sat in her nest
cradling apples put there in place of her missing baby.
   The tiny cub, weighing only 3.1 ounces, was born prematurely
Friday at the National Zoo and taken from its 250-pound mother six
hours later because of concern of infection.
   Zoo officials said the cub first began showing signs of strength,
but then weakened despite around-the-clock efforts by zoo
veterinarians and pediatric experts enlisted from nearby Children's
Hospital.
   The cub was placed in an incubator, fed a special formula through
a tube into its stomach and given antibiotics to fight the
infection, officials said.
   ``Every effort was made to pull this cub through its illness,''
said Robinson. At one point, when zoo officials managed to separate
the cub from a sedated mother, he recalled, ``I thought we'd won.''
   Without human aid, ``the baby would have died well before it did.
The infection would have run away with it,'' he said.
   Mitchell Bush, chief veterinarian at the zoo, said the cub's
survival was an uphill struggle because of the premature birth and
the infection. During most of its 39 hours of life the care given
the cub was similar to what a prematurely born child would receive.
   Zoo officials said a small tube inserted down the cub's throat
and into its stomach was ``slightly mispositioned'' and that a
``minute'' amount of fluid entered the cub's lung cavity. But Bush
said the amount of fluid was so small that it did not contribute to
the cub's death.
   Bush said there had been concern from the start that the cub
might have caught an infection from its mother, which has had
problems periodically with a kidney infection since 1983 and had a
reoccurrence only a week ago. The tiny cub's chances of survival
were reduced further because it weighed only about three-fourths of
what a normal panda cub would weigh, officials said.
   Three of the four previous cubs born to Ling-Ling also died of
infection shortly after birth, with the longest-living cub surviving
for four days in 1987. Because of the mother's problems with
infection, a decision was made nearly two years ago to take any
future newborn away from the mother, Bush said. That approach had
never been tried before, officials acknowledged.
   No giant panda cub has yet been successfully bred in captivity in
the United States, although cubs have survived at zoos in Mexico,
Japan, Spain and China, the native home for giant pandas.
   ``The zoo staff will do whatever is humanly possible to provide
the necessary care to support any future pregnancies and births,''
Robinson said.
   Ms. Stevens said Ling-Ling returned to the Panda House after the
anesthesia wore off and began searching for her offspring. Zoo
keepers found after previous births that if apples are put into the
nest, the mother will for a time mistake them for the cub.
   ``She still has her apples and is sitting in her nest cradling
them,'' said Ms. Stevens. The father, Hsing-Hsing, was in a separate
pen.
   Ling-Ling and Hsing-Hsing, which were given to the United States
by the Chinese government in 1972, are the only giant pandas on
permanent display in the country. Pandas are an endangered species
with fewer than 1,000 counted worldwide.

<HEAD>US Military Could Take More Active Role, Sununu Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With U.S. military equipment and trainers
arriving in Colombia, White House Chief of Staff John Sununu says
U.S. troops could be ordered to take an active role in the war
against drugs if that country requests it.
   ``If President Barco asks for a situation that might put
Americans at risk, it's a decision that the president (Bush) would
have to make,'' Sununu said Sunday on CBS' ``Face the Nation.''
   On Sunday, $65 million worth of U.S. military equipment and other
aid, accompanied by up to 100 American military trainers, began
arriving in Colombia.
   Sununu said the United States was providing the aid at the
request of Colombian President Virgilio Barco, and ``the constraints
on the folks and the resources that go down there are based on what
President Barco would like them to do.''
   Sununu was asked: ``Is the president willing to risk American
servicemen in this war on drugs?''
   The White House official replied: ``Well, if that request ever
came in, I'm sure the president would recognize that the American
public thinks that the drug problem is so tough and so important
that there is a great feeling amongst American citizens that we
probably should take even that risk.''
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, interviewed on ABC's ``This Week
With David Brinkley,'' also said American personnel in Colombia
would be at some risk.
   ``I can't say with absolute certainty that there is no risk to
our people in Colombia,'' he said. ``There's probably risk to our
embassy employees there. The dependents are coming out because of
that. To the maximum extent possible we want to minimize the risk.
The Colombian security forces will provide security for our people.''
   The Pentagon chief said, ``At this point, no Latin American
country has requested, nor has the president indicated any desire,
to send American troops into combat in Latin America to deal with
the drug problem.''
   In the current Colombia operation, he said, ``We are not sending
our folks into combat. They are not going out, for example, with
units of the Colombian military to actually attack facilities of the
cartel. They're going to be flying missions into Colombia, but not
within Colombia itself.''
   But Cheney added: ``I can't guarantee that it's absolutely
risk-free. The possibility exists that they would become targets for
the cartel. There is some risk involved. They (U.S. personnel) will
be able to defend themselves.''
   The American aid being sent to Colombia includes two C-130
transport planes and eight twin-engine A-37 jet aircraft, as well as
weapons, ammunition and communications gear.

<HEAD>Former High-Ranking Chinese Official Emerges From Hiding</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The highest-ranking Chinese official known to
have escaped from that country since the violent repression of
pro-democracy demonstrators is calling for an international effort
to bring down officials who ordered the massacre, The Washington
Post reported today.
   Chen Yizi, a former leader of China's economic reform movement,
emerged from hiding in Paris three months after leaving China, the
Post said.
   He criticized the Bush administration's response to the killings
in Tiananmen Square on June 3-4, the Post said.
   The crackdown was provoked by hard-liners in the Chinese
government in an effort to gain control over the communist regime
and put an end to Zhao Ziyang's economic reform movement, Chen was
quoted as saying.
   Chen said he is organizing the Front for a Democratic China, to
be headquartered in Paris, adding that it will seek support from
Chinese exiles and other Chinese who live overseas.
   The Post said Chen would have liked to have the organization
headquartered in the United States.
   ``But the United States government has appeared to be reluctant
to grant visas to dissidents and to help us be effective
politically, while France has been very helpful,'' he was quoted as
saying. ``The attitude of the Bush administration has been
disappointing when you compare it to the support and sympathy we
receive from Congress.''
   The Bush administration imposed limited sanctions on China
following the crackdown. Chen said that if those sanctions are
weakened, ``that is oxygen for Li Peng's government, and a bad
investment for America because Li Peng's government cannot last
long.''
   Chen was the head of China's Institute for Economic Structural
Reform that helped Zhao carry out many of that country's economic
reforms.
   Chen, 49, said he was aware in May that he was being followed in
China, and he told the Post he left Beijing on June 5, two days
after the military action began in Tiananmen Square. He gave no
details of how he escaped China.
   Chen described to the Post a May 17 meeting of the Chinese
Politburo in which Zhao resigned under pressure from hard-liners who
wanted to crack down on the student demonstrators.
   The student demonstrations brought to a head a two-year-old power
struggle in the Politburo over the reform issue, Chen told the Post.

<HEAD>Ex-Altar Boy Says Dissident Priest Had Sex With Him</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former Catholic altar boy says he had
homosexual relations 12 years ago with the Rev. George A. Stallings
Jr., the black priest who recently defied the Catholic hierarchy in
forming a breakaway congregation, The Washington Post reported today.
   The 28-year-old man, whom the Post did not identify, told the
paper he had oral sex two or three times a week with Stallings in
the church rectory for several months in 1977.
   Stallings could not be reached through telephone calls to his
church Sunday night. Phone messages were left on an answering
machine of his spokesman, but they were not returned.
   The Post quoted the priest, when asked about the allegations by a
reporter, as saying, ``Sir, do your job. I have no comment.''
   But in addressing his congregation Sunday from the pulpit at its
temporary home in a local high school, Stallings said the newspaper
was preparing an article about ``improprieties.''
   ``When you read in the newspaper or see on the television some
story that they ain't got no evidence and they're trying to say they
do, let me tell you something, church, they ain't got no truth,''
Stallings told his congregation without giving further details.
   Cardinal James A. Hickey, who suspended Stallings in July after
the priest formed a separate African-American congregation, and
other leaders of the Washington archdiocese would not comment on the
allegations, the Post said.
   The former altar boy and a former member of the boys choir at St.
Teresa of Avila Catholic Church was quoted by the Post as saying
that Stallings asked him on a summer afternoon in 1977 to kneel on
the carpet with him and break bread together as an act of special
closeness, the newspaper said.
   ``He started touching my ear,'' the Post quoted the man as
saying. ``And one thing led to another and ended upstairs in his
room. And, you know, that was the start of the relationship right
there, at least the sexual relationship.''
   The newspaper did not identify the man, quoting him as saying he
is now a homosexual but is not openly homosexual. But it said he
signed a sworn statement saying the statements he made in an
interview with its reporters ``are true and the events discussed did
occur.''
   The man was quoted by the newspaper as saying he became uneasy
with the relationship and broke it off, never reporting it to church
officials.
   Then 16, he said his only previous sexual experience ``was
kissing girls at school'' but that his relationship with Stallings
``was a deciding factor'' in his sexual orientation now, the
newspaper said.

<TEXT>
   The last Air Force Titan 3 rocket
roared into space with a secret Pentagon satellite today, ending 25
years of launches by a workhorse booster that has hurled more than
200 satellites into space.
   The 16-story-tall rocket, a 34D model, blazed away from its
launch pad at 1:54 a.m., brilliantly illuminating the darkness as it
rumbled skyward.
   ``The vehicle is right on track,'' said Air Force Lt. Col. Ron
Rand, the launch commentator.
   The Air Force said it was the 135th success in 141 launches for
the Titan 3.
   ``We close the book of the Titan 34D and move on to another
generation of launch vehicles,'' said Brig. Gen. Thomas W.
Honeywill, commander of the Air Force Systems Command. ``I'd like to
thank the entire Air Force and industry team for dedicated and
dependable service.''
   Officials provided no information on today's payload, saying only
that it was classified. Sources speaking on condition of anonymity
said the rocket may have carried an advanced reconnaissance
satellite.
   A secrecy label has been placed on many of the satellites carried
by Titan 3 rockets since the first was launched here in 1964.
   The payloads, most built for the Defense Department, have
performed many strategic military assignments. Among them were photo
reconnaissance, communications, monitoring missile tests,
intercepting military and diplomatic messages, verifying Soviet
compliance with arms control treaties and establishing an orbiting
system to provide instant alert of a hostile missile attack.
   The Titan 3s also have had some notable non-classified launches,
including two Viking spacecraft boosted toward landings on Mars in
1976 and the Voyager 1 and 2 probes dispatched in 1977 toward the
outer planets.
   Voyager 1 and 2 probed Jupiter and Saturn, while Voyager 2 two
weeks ago week sent back stunning images of Neptune and its moon
Triton as it completed a grand tour that included closeup looks at
Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus.
   The Titan 34D launched today was the 15th for that model, which
is the most powerful in the Titan 3 series. It can boost
31,650-pound payloads into low Earth orbit or 4,200 pounds to
stationary orbit 22,300 miles out.
   The Air Force is replacing the Titan 34D with the more powerful
Titan 4, the first of which successfully boosted a missile warning
satellite into orbit on June 14. The new rocket can hoist 39,000
pounds to Earth orbit or 10,000 pounds to stationary orbit.
   Martin Marietta Space Launch Systems in Denver has a contract to
build 23 Titan 4s for the Air Force for $5.1 billion. The two are
negotiating for an additional 26 rockets.
   Martin Marietta developed the Titan 3 series for the Air Force
from the Titan 2 intercontinental range nuclear missile, which
earlier had been modifed to boost into orbit the two-man Gemini
capsule in the mid-1960s.
   The space booster evolved through the Titan 3A, 3B, 3C and 34D
series, each more powerful than the last.
   ``With this launch, the Titan continued its unparalled success
record,'' said Gareth D. Flora, president of Space Launch Systems.
``Titan expendable launch vehicles have been the backbone of the Air
Force's space program for more than 20 years, and we expect the
Titan 4 to continue that tradition.''

<HEAD>Ousted Gay Congressman Sees `Deja Vu' in Barney Frank Scandal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A gay former congressman who was forced out of
office by a sex scandal nine years ago says the uproar over Rep.
Barney Frank's relationship with a male prostitute sounds all too
familiar.
   ``It has the strange familiarity of what Yogi Berra might have
called `deja vu all over again','' former Rep. Robert Bauman, a
Republican, wrote Sunday in an article in The Washington Post on the
controversy involving Frank, a Democrat.
   Frank last month confirmed published reports that he had
solicited and then befriended a male prostitute, allowed him to use
his Washington apartment, and paid him $20,000 a year from private
funds to do various chores. Frank acknowledged being gay in 1987.
   The prostitute, Steven Gobie, claimed he operated a prostitution
service out of Frank's apartment and that the Massachusetts
congressman knew about it. Frank has denied any such knowledge and
has received signs of continuing strong support in his home district.
   Bauman called Gobie a ``louse'' and a ``despicable character,''
and warned the media and Congress against censuring Frank because of
private acts, saying, ``the end result will be the decimation of
government.''
   Bauman was defeated in his Maryland district after eight years in
Congress in 1980 when it was revealed he was gay and had been
arrested for soliciting a male prostitute.

<NOTE>U.S.-Soviet Negotiators To Discuss North Pacific Fishing Issues</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. and Soviet negotiators meet in Leningrad
later this month to talk about the illegal harvesting of salmon in
the North Pacific and possible regulation of bottom fishing off
Alaska.
   The agenda may also include a discussion of the use of drift nets
in the North Pacific, said Ed Wolfe, the State Department's
ambassador for oceans and fisheries. He said an international ban or
regulation of such fishing may be ``possible'' after additional
scientific information is collected.
   The U.S. delegation will include 10 advisers from the fishing
industry in Alaska and Washington state.
   Both the United States and the Soviet Union are interested in
negotiating a new salmon agreement that ``would be comprehensive and
could potentially replace'' the International North Pacific
Fisheries Convention (INPFC), said Wolfe.
   `The existing convention has been very effective since it was
signed in the 1950s, but times have changed, the players have
changed and there is a need for more regulation and cooperation that
goes beyond the INPFC mandate,'' said Wolfe. ``In addition, the
Soviets are not members of the INPFC.''
   The United States, Japan and Canada are the current members.
   Wolfe said the Soviets have made a tentative proposal and the
United States would offer a counterproposal during the Leningrad
talks.
   U.S. fishing groups have long insisted that foreign fishermen
have been illegally catching salmon on the high seas, and say such
activity has hurt salmon runs in Alaska, Washington state and Oregon.

   Fourteen police officers were killed during
drug enforcement activities across the United States in 1988, says
the Washington-based Crime Control Institute.
   Such killings of police officers have averaged seven a year since
1972, when the FBI began publishing narratives on how police
officers died in the line of duty, according to a report released by
the institute on Sunday.
   University of Maryland Professor Lawrence W. Sherman, who also
heads the institute, said part of the reason for the increase is
that drug enforcement activity is increasing.
   Estimated drug arrests have set a record each year since reaching
708,000 in 1984, rising to 1.1 million in 1988, Sherman said.
   The numbers of police murders per 100,000 drug arrests rose from
.71 to in 1984 to 1.22 per 100,000 in 1988.
   The record rate, however, was in 1976, when 1.96 officers died
per 100,000 arrests, followed by 1980 when there were 1.89 police
killings for every 100,000 drug arrests.
   ``While the risk of death per arrest is still not as high as in
the record years of 1976 and 1980, this trend is still an ominous
one,'' the study said.

<HEAD>Bullets Flying in Coal Mine Strike</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK PAXTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DEHUE, W.Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shots have been fired and barricades set up
as a coal strike has turned into open warfare in southern West
Virginia.
   In Rum Creek Hollow, striking miners have built a barrier of old
tires, railroad ties and even a soggy, used couch to keep coal
trucks out.
   About a mile up the road at the mouth of Slab Fork Hollow,
pickets have erected a shield of timbers and sandbags to block the
bullets from automatic weapons and other guns they say have been
fired by mine guards and non-union workers.
   There is evidence of violence on both sides, according to state
police Superintendent Jack Buckalew.
   ``Some of the (mine) equipment has been hit by gunfire,'' he
said. ``It's obvious there have been gunshots into the picket
shacks.''
   The United Mine Workers union has been on strike against Pittston
Coal Group Inc. since April in a dispute over wages and benefits.
   The strike affects 1,900 Pittston miners in West Virginia,
Virginia and Kentucky, including 300 in Logan County. Pittston has
been seeking concessions that many miners fear will set an
industry-wide precedent.
   There have been minor incidents of violence throughout the
strike. The violence began to increase during wildcat walkouts in
the East and Midwest in June and July.
   The situation became much worse when the A.T. Massey Coal Co.
reopened the Rum Creek mine in early August. On Aug. 21, the strike
was expanded to Massey's non-union operations in Logan County.
   On Sunday, about 10,000 people rallying in southwestern Virginia
heard Jesse Jackson and UMW President Richard Trumka blast the
Republican presidential administrations of the 1980s for what they
called a hostile attitude toward labor.
   ``During the past 10 years, political leaders such as President
George Bush have used the American flag to pull the wool over our
eyes,'' Jackson said.
   Pittston's Elkay Mining Co. subsidiary is within a mile up Rum
Creek from Massey's operation, now being run by Con-Serv Inc., a
non-union contractor. The previous contractor encountered financial
problems during wildcat strikes in July.
   While union officials such as the West Coast farm workers' leader
Cesar Chavez have praised the UMW for its commitment to
non-violence, Pittston President Michael Odom has accused the union
of thousands of violent acts since the strike began. In Virginia, a
judge fined the union nearly $4.5 million in July for what he called
``acts of terror,'' including assaulting and threatening people, in
the coalfields.
   Along Rum Creek, gunfire has erupted several times, authorities
said. On Aug. 19, a union member was wounded in the arm. He was
hospitalized for a week, and six non-union workers were charged with
attempted murder.
   Eight days later, one of the six was charged with attempted
murder again after driving a loader through a blockade of downed
trees, picking up a striking UMW member in the bucket and carrying
him more than 50 feet before being stopped by a police officer who
witnessed the scene.
   Both sides blame the other for the violence.
   Richard Zigmond, president of Massey's Rum Creek Coal Sales Inc.,
said pickets have been firing into mine property, damaging equipment
and endangering workers. He said trucks have been hit by a barrage
of rocks and steel balls fired from slingshots. And he said miners
swarmed over an endloader one day last week, forcing guards to use
tear gas.
   Eight UMW members including Charles Gilliam, a former member of
the West Virginia House of Delegates, have been charged with
throwing rocks at company employees and vehicles.
   Huddled next to a picket shack behind the timbers and sandbags,
the UMW members complained that security guards and non-union truck
drivers are heavily armed, while pickets are barred by a court order
from carrying guns.
   Zigmond says the employees open fire only to protect themselves
and only when fired upon first.
   Each side is digging in as the violence escalates.
   ``It's a real confrontation there between the people working
there and the pickets,'' said Buckalew, the police superintendent.
``One side has sandbags, the other side has bulletproof guard
shacks.''

<HEAD>Hurricane Gabrielle Picking up Strength in Open Atlantic</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hurricane Gabrielle was unusually large and packed
125 mph winds as it drifted westward in the open Atlantic, and
forecasters said it should strengthen.
   The fourth hurricane of the Atlantic season did not pose any
immediate danger to land today, forecasters at the National
Hurricane Center said.
   ``This is definitely a hurricane that needs to be respected,''
said forecaster Bob Case. ``Gabrielle is a large Cape Verde type
hurricane _ which means it formed off the coast of Africa at the
peak of the season when waters are the warmest and the atmosphere is
the most favorable for strengthening.''
   At 10:30 p.m. EDT Sunday, Gabrielle's center was near 17.1 north
latitude and 52.2 west longitude, about 640 miles east of the Lesser
Antilles in the West Indies. It was moving west-northwest at 17 mph
and was expected to continue that course and speed through today.
   Gabrielle formed Thursday and its winds quickly surpassed minimum
hurricane force of 74 mph. Case noted that Gabrielle has quickly
become an unusually large hurricane, with an eye 20 miles across and
a total size up to 350 miles across.
   Far to the north, Tropical Storm Felix moved westerly and was
expected to gradually turn toward the northwest today.
   At 10:30 p.m., the center of Felix was near 34.2 north latitude
and 45.4 west longitude, or about 840 miles southwest of the
westernmost Azores.
   Its winds were about 40 mph, just above the 39-mph threshold for
a named storm. Little change in strength was expected through today.

   Bloomingdale's, symbol of conspicuous
consumption, may be heading to Moscow. But the average Soviet
citizen probably won't get a chance to line up for its perfume or
jeans.
   The department store chain's Soviet branches are expected to
accept only Western currencies, while Ivan Q. Public has only rubles
to spend. Rubles legally cannot be converted into other currencies.
   The retailer has had serious discussions with Soviet officials
about opening two shops by next spring _ at a Moscow hotel and
airport, said Bloomingdale's chairman, Marvin S. Traub.
   He said they would be like the ``Bloomie's Express'' shops, where
merchandise with the Bloomingdale label is sold.
   In May, Bloomingdale's began capitalizing on ``Gorbymania'' by
selling Soviet goods at its Upper East Side store, which was the
scene of a defection in the movie ``Moscow on the Hudson.''
   The newspaper Moscow Pravda said Bloomingdale's and the Moscow
City Council signed a letter of intent for the joint venture.

<DATELINE>ADAIRVILLE, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Members of a church founded by freed
slaves gave a resounding ``Amen!'' to four whites who came to say
they were sorry for setting their building on fire.
   The four pleaded guilty in October to breaking into church in
southern Kentucky and setting it on fire in May 1986.
   Before their sentencing, they had paid $6,000 to rebuild the
116-year-old church, and prosecutors agreed to amend the charges
from felonies to misdemeanors.
   In sentencing them, Logan District Judge Dale L. Prince ordered
them to apologize to the congregation or face contempt of court,
with a possible year in jail and $500 fine.
   ``I think the general consensus of all of us here is that we are
just amazed that this type of thing could happen,'' said 56-year-old
Sarah Garrick, who grew up next to the church and now lives in
Chicago.
   ``When I lived here, this would have never have happened because
of the racial prejudices in the area. I think it's wonderful that
the court made them come out here and apologize.''
   On Saturday, Bill Sircy, 22, bowed his head and cleared his
throat during the dedication of the new Smith Grove AME Zion Church
before saying, ``We're sorry, but I know that's not enough.''
   Angela B. Estep, about 19, added: ``What we did was wrong. ... It
was an accident, but it was still wrong. And I'm sorry.''
   The others who offered apologies were Sherri Davenport, 19, and
Danny Smith, 22.
   The Rev. Erskine Wade tried to ease their fears before they spoke
to 60 members of the congregation.
   ``Don't be nervous; you're among friends,'' Wade told them. ``And
when I say friends, I mean friends. What happened, happened. And
there is nothing any of us can do about that. We are your friends
now, and we want to help you any way we can.''
   Wade said that because the four made restitution, most church
members were not hostile toward them.
   ``Most are trying to be Christians, and I think they have
sympathy for them. There's no animosity, just sympathy.''

   The dollar rose to a two-month high against the
Japanese yen today in spite of intervention by the central bank,
while share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange climbed for the first
time in four days.
   The dollar closed at 146.13 yen, up 0.68 yen from Friday's close
of 145.45 yen. It started trading at 145.90 yen and moved in a range
of 145.85-146.30 yen.
   It was the first time since June 15 for the currency to rise
above the 126-yen mark.
   Currency dealers said the dollar's advance followed U.S.
government reports released Friday showing the country's continued
economic growth.
   ``Last week's labor statistics reconfirmed the strength of the
U.S. economy, encouraging the purchase of the dollar,'' said a
dealer at Daiichi Kangyo Bank, speaking anonymously.
   The U.S. Labor Department reported the nation's unemployment rate
for August remained steady at 5.2 percent, unchanged from the
previous month, while the Commerce Department said the Index of
Leading Economic Indicators, the chief economic forecasting gauge,
rose in July for the first time in three months.
   ``The dollar's bullish sentiment remains firm'' in Tokyo, though
the New York market will be closed Monday for the Labor Day holiday,
said a dealer with the Bank of Tokyo, also speaking anonymously.
   On the stock market, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected
issues, which has been bearish since Tuesday, won back 135.56
points, or 0.38 percent, to close at 34,483.78.
   Securities dealers said the dollar's rise discouraged investors
from actively buying shares, but ``the market environment is
gradually improving.''
   ``There was some active selling of export-related shares,
triggered by the dollar's strength, but by the day's end, most of
them were bought back, primarily by institutional investors,'' said
a dealer at Nikko Securities Co., speaking on condition of anonymity.

<TEXT>
   Israeli warplanes blasted a Palestinian
guerrilla base in a rare pre-dawn air raid in southeast Lebanon
today, wounding at least four guerrillas, police said.
   The Israeli army confirmed the 2 a.m. attack on the village of
Majdal Balhis in the foothills of Mount Hermon. An army spokesman
said a guerrilla base was destroyed and all raiding planes returned
safely to base.
   Lebanese police said at least four guerrillas were wounded in the
attack on the village, which is 6 miles north of Israel's
self-designated ``security zone'' in south Lebanon.
   Majdal Balhis houses a major base for Ahmed Jibril's Popular
Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command.
   A police spokesman, who cannot be named under standing
regulations, said the PFLP-GC base was ``totally destroyed'' in the
raid, which followed two attacks Wednesday and Thursday in which
Katyusha rockets were fired at Israel's Galilee district from south
Lebanon.
   Those attacks caused no injuries, but one rocket damaged a house
in Kiryat Shmona in the Galilee Panhandle.
   The Katyusha attacks were blamed on Hezbollah, or Party of God, a
pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem fundamentalist Lebanese faction.
   Israeli troops fought a battle with four guerrillas just north of
the border on Thursday, and one militiamen of the Shiite group Amal
was killed. Israel suffered no casualties in the firefight.
   It was not clear why the Israeli air force struck at Palestinian
guerrillas instead of the Lebanese factions who that have been
blamed for the recent hostilities against Israel.
   The PFLP-GC is a radical guerrilla faction at odds with Yasser
Arafat's maisntream Palestine Liberation Organization. It is based
in Damascus and funded mainly by Libya.
   Today's air strike was Israel's second in Lebanon in nine days
and the 11th this year. By police count, 17 people were killed and
94 wounded in the 10 previous air raids since Jan. 11.

   Minoru Seki, a 76-year-old farmer, was killed when a landslide
buried his house in Kumamoto Prefecture, 570 miles southwest of
Tokyo, as he was taking a bath inside, said Shigetoshi Ishimoto,
spokesman for the prefectural police.
   Ishimoto said two other people _ a 77-year-old farmer and a
57-year-old shop operator _ died after falling into rain-swollen
rivers in the prefecture.
   Three other people drowned after falling into swollen rivers in
Osaka, Oita, and Fukuoka prefectures, the National Police Agency
said.
   One person in Aichi Prefecture was killed when a mudslide hit her
house, according to local police.

   Some women get a diamond on their wedding
day. Connie Friedges got two: one on a ring, the other a baseball
field, where she and her fiance, an umpire, were married between
games.
   ``We've spent an awful lot of time on sotftball fields this
summer, and the summer before and the summer before. I love it. I
grew up with it,'' said the 32-year-old bride.
   After Mark Laurn, 30, proposed publicly Aug. 25 at a Minneapolis
Umpires Association banquet, another umpire suggested scheduling the
nuptials during the American Softball Association's Co-ed National
Slow-pitch Tournament in this southeastern Minnesota city.
   While three games were being played Sunday evening, Laurn, in his
umpire's uniform, and the bride, who wore an ivory dress, gathered
at home plate on an empty field. Some of the umpires hummed the
``Wedding March'' into a microphone.
   When the minister asked who was giving away the bride, more than
30 umpires said, ``We do.''
   As Laurn kissed his bride, one umpire yelled, ``Safe'' and the
few hundred fans cheered.
   After the 20-minute ceremony, the umpires tossed baseballs over
the heads of the newlyweds, who are from Apple Valley.
   Then, it was back to work for Laurn, who had another game.
   ``She doesn't mind; she's super,'' he said.
   But he promised he would make it up to her with a honeymoon at
Palm Springs, Calif.

<HEAD>Gadhafi Reportedly Cutting Back On Aid To Alleged Terrorist Groups</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERRY LEONARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TRIPOLI, Libya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Despite Col. Moammar Gadhafi's promise of
continued support for liberation and alleged terrorist groups around
the world, Western and Palestinian sources say the Libyan leader is
cutting back on such aid.
   The sources said Sunday that Gadhafi has told several Palestinian
groups they no longer will receive direct funding from his
government and they should close their offices in Libya.
   The reports could signal an effort by Gadhafi to appear more
moderate as he tries to rebuild international ties.
   The sources, speaking on condition they not be identified, were
in Tripoli for weekend ceremonies celebrating the coup 20 years ago
that brought Gadhafi to power.
   One source in the Palestine Liberation Organization said Gadhafi
has provided about $5 million since April 1988 to support the
Palestinian uprising in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip, with the money going direcly to hospitals, universities and
relief organizations. The uprising began in December 1987.
   The source also said Gadhafi's regime has not given any money to
the PLO since 1975.
   If the reports are true, the actions could reflect what appeared
to be Gadhafi's efforts during the weekend ceremonies to improve his
image with the West and reduce Libya's isolation from the
international community.
   But Gadhafi, in his main anniversary speech Friday, promised to
continue to support ``freedom-fighters'' around the world,
declaring, ``We stand in the trenches with you. It is our duty.''
   Economics also may be a factor in the stinginess. Libya currently
receives up to $6 billion annually from oil revenues, but it is
estimated the government spends up to $8 billion a year and its
foreign reserves are dwindling.
   The Palestinian source said Gadhafi angered Syria-based
Palestinian groups when he told them three months ago they would no
longer receive direct funding.
   A Western diplomat said Gadhafi refused to meet with leaders of
the Palestinian groups who flew to Tripoli last month to ask the
Libyan leader to reconsider and he refused.
   PLO chief Yasser Arafat attended the anniversary celebrations but
leaders of various other Palestinian factions did not.
   One Western diplomat said Saturday that Gadhafi called in
representatives of 70 different groups in August and told them
``they had to close shop here (in Tripoli) and for financial
assistance they had to go through official channels.''
   The diplomat, who added he could not identify the 70 groups, said
``official channels'' meant the request for funds had to be made to
Libyan officials and if money was granted it would be distributed
through relief organizations.
   U.S. officials accused Libya of being involved in the 1986
terrorist bombing of a disco in West Berlin that killed an American
serviceman and a Turkish woman. U.S. warplanes bombed Tripoli and
Benghazi in retaliation.
   President Ronald Reagan ordered an embargo on Libya the same year
because of terrorists attacks at the Rome and Vienna airports in
December 1985. The United States blamed Palestinian terrorist Abu
Nidal for the attacks and accused Gadhafi of harboring him.

   A helicopter collided with a small plane,
killing three people and scattering debris over a rural subdivision,
authorities said.
   Two people in the helicopter and the pilot of the single-engine
plane were killed in SUnday night's crash about a mile from the
Houma-Terrebonne Airport, said police Capt. John Dixon.
   Dixon said the helicopter crashed and burned in an intersection
just outside Houma's southern limits and the plane crashed into a
tree, but there were no injuries on the ground.
   The helicopter was leased by Acadian Ambulance Service from
Petroleum Helicopters Inc., which serves the offshore oil industry.
The crew had just flown from the hospital for maintenance work on
their regular helicopter and were returning in a backup aircraft
when the collision occurred, said Acadian Ambulance spokesman
Richard Zuschlag.
   ``There is no explanation for it. It was a mid-air collision.
Nobody knows who was at fault,'' Zuschlag said.
   National Transportation Safety Board investigators were expected
to investigate the crash today, he said.

<TEXT>
   A federal grand jury is investigating
allegations against a Boeing division and at least one midlevel
company official of overcharging the Air Force millions of dollars,
a newspaper reported.
   The government contends Boeing Military Airplanes of Wichita
overcharged the Air Force $11 million during the past decade on
contracts to replace the aluminum skins of KC-135 transports and
refueling tankers, The Wichita Eagle reported Sunday.
   Because the five-year statute of limitations has expired on some
of the contracts, the felony criminal investigation is limited to
alleged overcharges of $3 million to $5 million.
   The Defense Department is considering civil action to try to
reclaim all $11 million, according to Defense Department sources who
requested anonymity, the newspaper said.
   Any convictions could result in a possible maximum penalty of 10
years in prison and $500,00 in fines. The company could be fined $1
million in addition to repayment of overcharges.
   The newspaper quoted Defense Department sources as alleging the
Boeing division charged the government 12 percent to 13 percent more
for aluminum than it was paying its suppliers, a markup not allowed
under such military contracts.
   Boeing Military spokesman Richard Hill said the company has been
cooperating fully with the investigation.
   ``The issues pertain to the pricing of certain raw materials used
in the performance of the contracts and it involves complex
regulatory and accounting principles,'' Hill said.
   He refused to explain Boeing's position further.
   Federal prosecutors plan to present a draft indictment to the
grand jury before the statute of limitations expires early next
month, the Eagle reported.

<HEAD>Bomb-Warning Caller Links Blast to Rushdie</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: UPDATES throughout with Liberty's saysing its Penguin shop recently
closed, store doesn't stock Rushdie book. No pickup.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GRAHAM HEATHCOTE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associate Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scotland Yard's anti-terrorist squad today said it
was investigating a bomb blast linked to the campaign against Salman
Rushdie, the target of death threats for his novel ``The Satanic
Verses.''
   Police said an anonymous caller, who mentioned Rushdie's book,
telephoned with a bomb threat shortly before the device exploded
late Sunday outside Liberty's department store in central London. A
woman passer-by was injured.
   The store was closed at the time, but by day the area is one of
the busiest in London's congested West End.
   Until recently, Liberty's housed a Penguin bookstore concession.
``The Satanic Verses'' was published last year under the Viking
imprint, which is part of the Penguin group.
   The novel angered religious Moslems around the world, who claim
it blasphemes their religion.
   Viking Penguin received death threats against its staff after the
Islamic campaign began and two London bookstores, one specializing
in Penguin books, were damaged in arson attacks on April 9.
   ``There used to be a Penguin paperback bookshop in the store, on
the ground floor near the area of our present bookshop, but it
closed a couple of months ago,'' said a spokeswoman for Liberty's.
   The new bookstore does not stock ``The Satanic Verses,'' she
said, requesting anonymity.
   The injured woman, who was not identified, underwent surgery for
leg injuries and was in satisfactory condition at University College
Hospital.
   She is the first person known to have been hurt in Britain in the
worldwide campaign by Moslem zealots against the novel.
   Detective chief superintendent Derek Willison said that 10 or 15
minutes before the blast police received an anonymous telephone
warning which mentioned ``The Satanic Verses.'' He would not give
other details.
   As police were searching the area, the bomb went off on the
sidewalk in Great Marlborough Street near a window of the Liberty
department store where books were displayed.
   Willison said Rushdie's book was not among them, but books issued
by his publishers, Viking Penguin, were in the window.
   Liberty's, established in 1875 and housed in a mock Tudor
black-and-white building on the corner of Regent Street and Great
Marlborough Street, has an international reputation as a fashion
leader in textiles.
   Willison described the bomb as ``small'' and other police
officers said there was no damage to buildings. But Tracy Ryan, 23,
who was looking in a store window across the street spoke of a large
blast.
   ``Suddenly there was a huge bang. It was really frightening and
the pavement (sidewalk) shook. It was a terrible bang,'' she said.
   Early today, police sealed off the area around the store and were
checking for clues and taking photographs. They finally left at 5
a.m., removing barrier tapes. There was a bloodstain on the sidewalk
where the woman was injured.
   Rushdie has been in hiding since February, when Iran's late
religious leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, called on Moslems
worldwide to kill him for his novel allegedly blaspheming Islam. Two
Iranian clerics have offered a $5.2 million bounty for Rushdie's
death.
   Rushdie's American wife, Marianne Wiggins, has said she left him
five weeks ago because she could not stand the strain.
   Moslems in Britain have burned the novel and demonstrated against
it. In Pakistan and India, at least a score of people have been
killed and hundreds injured in riots protesting the book.
   In the novel, prostitutes are named after the wives of the
prophet Mohammed prophets and that Mohammed wrote the Koran, Islam's
holiest book, instead of receiving the words from Allah.

   The Wichita Eagle-Beacon is now The Wichita
Eagle, laying to rest a newspaper name that survived nearly 117
years.
   With the Sunday editions, the newspaper dropped the word Beacon
from its name. Its publishing company retains its corporate name,
The Wichita Eagle and Beacon Publishing Co. Inc.
   ``We're not changing the name. We're shortening the name,'' said
Executive Editor Davis ``Buzz'' Merritt Jr. ``If we were changing it
to `The Gazette,' or something, I think that would cause a stir. And
it should. We're just dropping the name of a newspaper that hasn't
existed for nine years.''
   The Wichita Beacon, which like the Eagle was founded in 1872, was
last published as a separate afternoon newspaper in October 1980.
   Reid Ashe, publisher of the Knight-Ridder Inc.-owned newspaper,
said a question about possibly changing the name was included in a
recent reader poll.
   ``Almost no one said they cared. So we think it's a safe and
sensible change,'' he said.

<HEAD>Experts to Discuss Bioethical Issues at Conference in Nevada</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURA MYERS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>RENO, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Karen Ann Quinlan's lapse into an irreversible
coma in 1975 sparked a debate over a person's right to die that
continues today as some people with severe disabilities such as AIDS
seek death over suffering.
   Efforts by Mary Beth Whitehead-Gould in 1986 to get custody of
her child after acting as a surrogate mother turned attention to
``reproductive issues,'' most recently involving frozen embryos.
   Judges, legal experts, physicians and ethicists gathering this
week say the 1990s will bring more life and death issues to the
courts.
   ``We have to give judges some medical and ethical background from
which to decide these cases,'' said Judge Gladys Kessler, associate
judge in the District of Columbia Superior Court. ``The judiciary is
taking the lead in this area, not because we want to but because
we're being forced to.
   ``Things are moving so fast. And legislatures, usually for
political reasons, don't seem to want to address these issues. And I
don't blame them. There's usually no right or wrong. Only ethical
dilemmas,'' added Kessler, who will be a lecturer at the conference.
   Chief justices in each state have been invited to send two judges
apiece to the first National Conference of the Judiciary on
Bioethical Issues, to be held Thursday through Sunday.
   Twenty national organizations, including the American Medical
Association and the American Bar Association, also have been asked
to send two delegates each.
   ``We wanted to hold the conference because these issues must be
discussed to come up with some answers that judges can take back to
their states,'' said Thomas Russell, associate dean of the National
Judicial College, a school for judges on the University of
Nevada-Reno campus.
   ``Judges are expected to be wise and philosophical about these
cases. But they're almost always very emotional issues, and a judge
must reach a solution that involves the least amount of turmoil for
everyone.''
   More than 150 participants are expected at the conference paid
for by the State Justice Institute and co-sponsored by the college,
The Women Judges' Fund for Justice and the Institute of Public Law.
   John Robertson, another lecturer for the meeting and a professor
at the University of Texas School of Law, said judges must learn the
latest medical information to make sound decisions in cases where
they're often pressed for time.
   ``We've got to start developing rules because these cases are
only going to get more complicated as technology develops,''
Robertson said. ``And there isn't any precedent or law to follow in
most cases.''
   In one such case, a Tennesee judge in a divorce trial has to
decide on the husband's request to stop his estranged wife from
using seven frozen embryos they created through an in vitro
fertilization program.
   A federal court is reviewing a case in which a couple is suing
the Jones Reproductive Medicine Institute of Norfolk, Va., for
possession of their frozen embryo. The couple moved to California
last year, and the clinic refused to ship it.
   The latest ``right to die'' case surfaced last week when
Georgia's attorney general supported a quadriplegic's request to
turn off the respirator that keeps him alive. He wants a judge to
let him activate a timer with his mouth to turn off a ventilator he
has used since his neck was broken in a 1985 motorcycle accident.
   The legality of authorities or friends assisting with suicide
also has been an issue among AIDS patients and care-givers.

<TEXT>
   Syrian and Christian troops clashed in
gunbattles across Beirut's dividing Green Line today after
night-long artillery duels that kindled forest fires in the central
mountains.
   Police reported no casualties in the morning hostilities along
the three-mile demarcation line that splits Beirut into Moslem and
Christian sectors.
   At least 826 people have been killed and 2,449 wounded in
fighting that broke out March 8 between Gen. Michel Aoun's Christian
army units and Syrian troops.
   Police said troops of the Syria's elite Special Forces fired
machine guns and hurled grenades on the Lebanese Army's 9th brigade
at Beirut's bomb-ravaged port on the western tip of the Green Line.
   The Lebanese soldiers retaliated with tank fire and truck-mounted
machine guns, said a police spokesman who cannot be named in line
with standing rules.
   The clashes later spread to the southern slums, where the
Syrians, barricaded in Beirut's shuttered airport, exchanged
artillery and tank fire with Aoun's 10th brigade soldiers on nearby
hills, the spokesman added.
   Artillery duels had flared from dusk Sunday to dawn in the
mountain resort towns of Douar, Btigrin, Ein el-Tuffaha and Bekfaya,
starting fires in the pine stands that burned all night.
   The towns form the eastern entrance into the Christian enclave
north of Beirut that has been besieged by the Syrians and their
Moslem allies since mid-March.
   Syria's main ally, Druse warlord Walid Jumblatt, said in a
statement published by several Beirut newspapers today that Aoun
should leave Lebanon as a precondition for a settlement with the
Christians.
   ``Aoun has pleaded for French help, but France did not come to
his rescue. He also sought America's help and the United States did
not respond.
   ``What is Aoun waiting for? Let him leave. I am willing to take
him out of Lebanon. He should go in order to avert further bloodshed
and destruction,'' Jumblatt said.
   He vowed to fight on to the bitter end if Aoun stays and said:
``Mr. General, please spare us further death and misery. Please go.
Go wherever you want, but out of Lebanon.''
   Aoun's spokesmen at the bomb-battered presidential palace in
suburban Baabda declined to comment on Jumblatt's statement.
   The confrontation erupted when Aoun ordered his gunboats and
helicopter gunships on March 6 to blockade three militia-run harbors
south of Beirut, two of them run by Jumblatt's Progressive Socialist
Party.
   Jumblatt retaliated by shelling the Christian enclave. The
Syrians later jointed the bombardment and sealed off the enclave to
prevent Aoun from receiving arms from Iraq, his main Arab backer and
Syria's arch rival.
   The Syrians intervened in 1976 under a peacekeeping mandate from
the Arab League. But Aoun maintains that Syria's credibility was
eroded when its troops sided with Moslems in the 14-year-old
Lebanese civil war.

<TEXT>
   Decades of guilt forced a woman to confess that
she killed her baby and buried the body in her yard 38 years ago,
police said.
   Marian F. Allen, 68, was charged with second-degree murder after
a city work crew dug up a small strongbox wrapped in tape containing
an infant's remains.
   Allen had been tormented by guilt and finally ``exploded'' at the
knowledge that the baby boy was buried in the garden a few feet from
her house, police Capt. Albert Prezio said Sunday.
   ``She said she hadn't slept in 38 years,'' said Sgt. John Tedesco.
   Allen called police Saturday and told investigators she had
smothered the infant and buried him without the knowledge of her
husband, George, or their teen-age son, Prezio said. The baby was
from an extramarital affair, authorities said.
   ``The culmination came the other day. She finally had to tell
somebody about it,'' Prezio said. ``She could see the grave site. It
was only within a few feet from her window where she sat most every
day.''
   Her family told police Allen had been under psychiatric care for
years, Prezio said.
   Allen told investigators she buried the infant the day after his
birth at home, but investigators did not know exactly when the baby
was killed, Prezio said.
   An autopsy was scheduled for Tuesday.
   Allen was arraigned Saturday and by a judge who ordered a
psychiatric examination. Allen was being held Sunday night at the
Central New York Psychiatric Hospital.
   A hearing has been scheduled for Thursday.
   Allen's confession was the first police heard of the infant.
   ``It wasn't like an unsolved murder that we had kept open,'' said
Sgt. Anthony Magnetto.
   The Albany Times Union reported today that a source in the
investigation said Allen panicked after giving birth and killed the
baby out of fear her husband would find out about her affair.
   Allen identified the father as a local man who has since died,
said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Neighbors said George Allen was well known in the neighborhood,
but his wife kept to herself.
   ``Nobody knew her,'' neighbor Shawn Lavallee said. ``I've lived
here all my life and never knew her, she was so quiet. I hadn't seen
her in a couple of years before yesterday,'' when she was arrested.
   George Allen, his grandson and a neighbor were working with
shovels Sunday in the area where the baby's body was dug up. They
refused to comment.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   To join Britons in recalling the 50th anniversary
of the declaration of war between England and Germany, Herbert
Hermann returned to the spot where six weeks into World War II his
submarine killed 832 British seamen.
   Hermann, a torpedoman on a U-47, made the journey to the Scapa
Flow anchorage in Scotland's Orkney Islands, where his submarine
sank the 29,500-ton Royal Navy battleship Royal Oak.
   He joined elderly survivors, some of them crying, at a waterborne
memorial service Sunday where wreaths were thrown on the surface
above the wreck.
   ``I have no qualms; I done my duty and they done theirs,''
Hermann said in heavily accented English.
   Across the English Channel, at a somber ceremony with drums and
bugles at the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, the French also remembered
how they entered the war alongside Britain on the same day, Sunday,
Sept. 3, 1939.
   Several thousand people gathered at the monument to Napoleon
Bonaparte's victories. Among them were former combatants carrying
the blue-white-and-red flags of their prisoner-of-war or veterans'
associations.
   Radio and television stations in Britain repeated the 50-year-old
announcement by Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain that Britain had
declared war on Germany.
   ``This morning the British ambassador in Berlin handed the German
government the final note stating that unless we heard from them by
11 o'clock that they were prepared at once to withdraw their troops
from Poland, a state of war will exist between us,'' Chamberlain
said.
   ``I have to tell you now that no such undertaking has been
received and that consequently, this country is at war with
Germany.''
   One radio network also broadcast part of a speech by German
dictator Adolf Hitler attempting to justify the war and one by
13-year-old Princess Elizabeth, now Britain's queen, expressing
sympathy with children evacuated from London to avoid the expected
bombing raids.
   In Coventry, which endured the longest single bombing raid in
Britain during the war, 500 people prayed for their former enemies
in the new Coventry Cathedral, next to the ruins of the 700-year-old
one destroyed in the attack. The 11-hour raid on Nov. 14, 1940,
killed 568 people.
   Through a British Broadcasting Corp. linkup, the worshippers
joined those in a church in Dresden, East Germany, to offer
forgiveness to one another. Dresden was bombed and up to 135,000
people killed by the Allies in 1945.
   In Plymouth, southwest England, representatives of the Allied
countries, including a group of veterans from the Soviet Union,
attended the unveiling of a bronze statue of the ``Unknown Airman''
honoring the 250,000 Allied airmen and women killed in the war.
   Although no national official events were planned to mark the
anniversary, the media is making the most of it.
   Newspapers today reprinted front pages of their first day of the
war issues.
   The Daily Telegraph reprinted its entire 14-page issue, complete
with advertisements. One from a former Guy's Hospital nurse in the
remote southwest county of Cornwall offered ``accommodation to
gentlefolk, adults or children. Absolute safety.''
   The ads also recalled Britain's halcyon days as head of a large
empire.
   The first entry in the newspaper's births announcements was for a
boy born at Darjeeling, India, where British tea planters controlled
large estates. India became independent in 1947, two years after the
end of World War II.

   This shocked town of 1,000 began
mourning the deaths of six high school students in a weekend car
crash that went undiscovered for 18 to 20 hours.
   At St. Paul Roman Catholic Church, parishioners listened only to
gentle, reassuring organ music at Sunday Mass, the Rev. Richard
Shafer said, because, ```I didn't think they were in the mood to
sing.''
   ``In a school of 300 high school kids everybody knows them,''
Principal Jack Lewis said. He said school would resume Tuesday with
a team of counselors standing by.
   The five boys and a girl were killed when their borrowed car
veered from a gravel road and plunged down an embankment into a
shallow creek, Brown County Sheriff Leon Pieschek said in Green Bay.
   The accident site in the town of Holland, neighboring Wrightstown
in northeastern Wisconsin, was strewn with more than a dozen beer
bottles, and the 17-year-old driver is believed to have attended a
beer party before the crash, Pieschek said. Autopsies and
blood-alcohol tests were being conducted, he said.
   He said the accident probably occurred between 10 p.m. and
midnight Friday but was not discovered until 6 p.m. Saturday.
   The victims were Jamie Borchardt, 17, the driver; Stacie Summers,
15; Chad Bungeon, 15; Eugene Carter, 17, and his younger brothers,
Sean, 16, and Corey, 14. Lewis called them ``typical teen-age kids
for this area.''
   The sheriff said three people were arrested Friday night at a
beer party on private property in Greenleaf, a few miles east of
Holland, and it is believed at least one of the victims, Borchardt,
attended.
   Officers raided the party about midnight after receiving
complaints that people were throwing beer bottles and rocks at
passing cars, but none of the victims were at the party then,
Pieschek said.
   Some teen-agers who gathered outside the church after Mass said
they knew the victims from school and heard they had been at the
party.
   ``They all took off before it got raided,'' 14-year-old Melanie
Buechler said.
   The sheriff said one of the victims' families filed a missing
child report Saturday while the other victims' families conducted
their own searches without reporting to his department.
   The crash was discovered by a 14-year-old walking near the creek.

<TEXT>
   Conflict has heightened in the Roman Catholic church
over Polish primate Cardinal Jozef Glemp's refusal to honor an
agreement to move a convent away from the Auschwitz death camp.
   Three of the four cardinals who signed the pact with Jewish
leaders in 1987 insisted Sunday that it be carried out. They include
the leaders of France and Belgium's Catholics.
   The three were responding to Glemp's suggestion last week that
the accord be renegotiated.
   Prelates Albert Decourtray of Lyon and Godfried Danneels of
Brussels and fellow Cardinal Jean-Marie Lustiger of Paris said in a
statement that Glemp ``could only have been speaking for himself.''
   Cardinal Franciszek Macharski of Krakow, Poland, the other
cardinal who signed the agreement, said Aug. 19 that he was
suspending the accord because of ``aggressive'' demands and protests
by Jewish activists at the convent located in his diocese.
   Glemp later angered many Jews and non-Jews with a sermon Aug. 26
in which he said Polish anti-Semitism would disappear if Jews would
abandon anti-Polish sentiments.
   He asked Jews to understand that it offended Poles' religious
sensibilities and feelings of sovereignty to insist on removal of
the Carmelite convent, which in 1984 was set up just outside the
fence surrounding the former Nazi concentration camp.
   ``Dear Jews, do not talk to us from the position of a nation
elevated over all others and do not put to us conditions that are
impossible to meet,'' Glemp said in the sermon.
   Glemp offended many Jews by suggesting Jews helped spread
Communism, and by mentioning that some collaborated with Nazis
during World War II or as businessmen neglected or detested Poles.
   Pope John Paul II has not commented on the dispute. Vatican
officials said in Rome that the Polish-born pope believes the Polish
church must resolve it.
   Jewish groups say the convent and its Christian religious
symbols, including a 23-foot cross, offend the memory of the 2.5
million Jews who died there during World War II.
   Under the 1987 agreement between a Jewish delegation and the four
archbishops, the nuns were to have been moved by Feb. 22 to an
interfaith prayer center to be built several thousand yards away.
   Glemp was quoted Saturday in Italian newspapers as saying it was
``a scandal'' to move the convent:
   ``I want this accord to be renegotiated,'' Glemp was quoted as
saying. ``It has to be done by competent people and not by just any
cardinal who doesn't understand the things.''
   In their statement issued in Paris, Decourtray, Lustiger and
Danneels defended the agreement, which they said was ``patiently and
loyally negotiated over two years,'' and the capacity of the
negotiators on the two sides.
   ``If the Jewish delegation at the Geneva meetings, led by Mr.
Theo Klein, then president of the European Jewish Congress, is `not
competent,' who would be?'' they asked.
   ``And if four cardinals, including the archbishop of Krakow, are
not qualified to represent the Catholic side, who might be? The
Auschwitz camp is in the Krakow diocese. According to church law,
its archbishop has full authority there. The cardinals who
accompanied him belong to nations who, in the West, were among the
chief victims of the Hitler barbarism.''
   Many Poles argue that there is nothing offensive about nuns
praying at a site where large numbers of Roman Catholics, as well as
Jews, were killed.
   ``The Jews should understand that devoting oneself to a life of
prayer near the place where Christians were martyred doesn't offend
their feelings,'' Glemp was quoted as saying in the Italian
interview.
   Speaking to reporters Sunday in Lyon, Decourtray said he hoped
the dispute could be resolved without requiring intervention by the
pope, who was Macharski's predecessor as archbishop of Krakow.
   ``I'll say that I am a little shocked, a little hurt by Monsignor
Glemp's statements,'' Decourtray said. ``But I want a clear
understanding. Like Mr. Theo Klein, I want Auschwitz to become again
a sacred place.''
   In Warsaw, a spokesman for the Catholic Episcopate, Marek Pernel,
said today that Glemp had not seen the cardinals' statement that
there would be no immediate comment.
   The Glemp comments reported Saturday were the primate's first
published remarks on the convent issue since his Aug. 26 sermon.
   Seven Jews, including Rabbi Avi Weiss of New York City,
demonstrated July 14 at the convent.
   Glemp was quoted as saying, ``A squad of seven New York Jews
launched an attack against the convent, but did not kill the nuns or
destroy the convent only because they were stopped.''
   The seven demonstrators were roughly dragged away by workmen at
the camp.
   In Chicago, Jewish leaders have called for a boycott of Glemp
during his scheduled Sept. 21-25 visit.
   Only several thousand Jews remain in Poland from a pre-war
population of 3.5 million. About 3 million Jews were among the 6
million Poles killed during World War II, and most of the rest have
emigrated.

<HEAD>Strike Begins in Soviet Azerbaijan in Reply to People's Front Call</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some bus drivers and factory workers stayed off the
job today in Soviet Azerbaijan on the first day of a strike called
by a grassroots political group to put pressure on the Communist
leadership, officials said.
   Representatives of Azerbaijan's Foreign Ministry, the official
Azerinform news agency and an independent journalist said at midday
that it was too early to say how effective the strike call had been,
but it did not appear to have a crippling effect on the local
economy.
   At a rally in the southern republic's capital of Baku attended by
hundreds of thousands of people, supporters of the Azerbaijan
People's Front on Saturday declared a weeklong general strike
beginning today to press its demands.
   The People's Front wants new elections to replace the republic's
representation in the Soviet Congress and the abolition of direct
rule by the Kremlin in the Nagorno-Karabakh region of Azerbaijan,
which is predominantly Armenian.
   Izmail Agayev, head of the Information Department of Azerbaijan's
Foreign Ministry, said by telephone from Baku today that some
drivers of buses and streetcars in the city of 1.7 million did not
show up for work.
   ``Some of the factory workers are also on strike,'' said Agayev.
   An editor at Azerinform said the strike idled some enterprises in
the major oil refining and processing center on the Caspian Sea
coast. At others, he said, about 70 percent of the workers were on
the job.
   Alif Aliev, an independent Baku journalist, said it was too early
to gauge the effectiveness of the strike call from the People's
Front.
   The Defense Ministry newspaper Red Star said Sunday that tensions
between Armenia and neighboring Azerbaijan ``are like gunpowder,''
and that Nagorno-Karabakh is on the verge of civil war.
   The disputed region is wracked by strikes and frequent armed
clashes. Most of its roads are closed, and Red Star described how
locals fired on Soviet troops recently and an angry crowd surrounded
a police station to demand the releast of detainees.
   Tens of thousands of people in Nagorno-Karabakh have been forced
to flee their homes because of clashes between Armenians and
Azerbaijanis that have killed more than 100 people.
   In an effort to halt the violence, Moscow on Jan. 12 imposed
direct rule on Azerbaijan by a committee led by its special
representative, Arkady Volsky.
   Azerbaijani People's Front leaders including Ekhitbar Mamedov,
poet Bakhtiar Vakhabzade and chairman Abulfaz Aliev termed direct
Kremlin rule over Nagorno-Karabakh ``a gross violation of the
people's right to self-determination,'' Amirbekov said.
   A council of Armenian activists in Nagorno-Karabakh declared
their independence from Azerbaijan last week, but the Azerbaijan
government rejected the move as unconstitutional.

<HEAD>PIlot Missing, Presumed Dead, After Jet Plunges Into Lake During
Show</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A complicated stunt by the Canadian Forces' elite
Snowbirds aerobatic team went awry before thousands of onlookers and
two jets plunged into Lake Ontario after apparently clipping each
other.
   Capt. Shane Antaya, 24, of Stratford, Ont., was missing and
presumed dead after his red-and-white jet crashed in a dizzying
nosedive at the Canadian National Exhibition air show.
   Maj. Dan Dempsey of Edmonton, the 36-year-old commander of the
precision flying team, safely ejected from his jet moments before it
careered in smoke and flames into the lake.
   Dempsey, who parachuted into the water, was taken to Toronto
General Hospital where he was treated for facial cuts and leg burns
and released.
   Antaya's wife, mother, brother and sister were watching the show
from the shoreline, Col. Claude Thibault told reporters at a news
conference Sunday night.
   ``The Snowbirds, of course, are filled with a sense of loss,''
said Thibault, adding that the team's 15 remaining shows this season
have been canceled and the Canadian Forces has already begun
investigating.
   The accident occurred midway through the nine-member team's
performance, during a stunt called an upward-downward bomb burst. In
the maneuver, two groups of planes fly past each other at 373 mph.
   Witnesses said two planes appeared to touch, sending them
tumbling out of the tight formation. Videotape of the crash appeared
to confirm the collision, but Thibault declined to speculate on the
cause pending the investigation.
   The estimated crowd of 70,000 collectively gasped as the two
planes fell from the sky and crashed a few hundred yards from shore.
   The Snowbirds were the first performers at the Canadian
International Air Show, which runs the final three days of the
two-week exhibition.
   Sunday's show resumed about 45 minutes after the crash and show
chairman Bill McVean said today's show would go ahead without the
Snowbirds: ``It's a tradition in the aviation business that the show
must go on.''
   The team, which performs more than 60 shows throughout North
America each year, has had three airshow accidents and two pilot
deaths in its history.
   ``We have flown in 980 shows before 60 million people,'' said
Thibault. ``Our record speaks for itself.''
   Seven pilots and crew members have died in five accidents since
the Canadian National Exhibition air show began in 1949, not
including Sunday's crash.

<TEXT>
   The previous fatal mishap was Sept. 2, 1977, when vintage plane
buff Alan Ness, 51, of Toronto, was killed when his Second World War
fighter plane nosedived into Lake Ontario.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Sunday's crash comes almost a year after Capt. Wes MacKay of the
Snowbirds was killed in a car crash near Latrobe, Pa., that also
injured Capt. Paul Giles and Capt. Ken Rae. A county coroner in
Pennsylvania determined MacKay was legally impaired at the time of
the accident in September 1988.
   In their 19th season, the team flies the CT-114 Tutor, a
single-engine jet manufactured by Canadair Ltd. of Montreal. It has
a maximum speed of about 466 mph.
   Officially known as the 431 Air Demonstration Squadron, it is a
permanent unit of the Canadian Forces based at Moose Jaw in
Saskatchewan. Team members are changed every two years.
   Antaya was in his second year with the Snowbirds, said Thibault,
base commander in Moose Jaw, adding the young pilot earned his wings
in 1985 and had logged more than 1,800 flying hours. Before joining
the elite flying squad, Antaya served as an instructor pilot for two
years at the Moose Jaw air base.

<HEAD>Gushing Water Washes Asbestos into Street</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A water-main break that flooded the subway and
left a muddy mess today on busy midtown streets caused the second
major asbestos contamination in Manhattan in two weeks.
   The water washed about 50 pounds of asbestos insulation off two
steam pipes Sunday, and the asbestos-laden water poured into the
street and into subway tunnels, officials said.
   The 63-year-old, 20-inch underground main had been scheduled for
replacement Tuesday, officials said.
   Asbestos has been linked to cancer, and the breathing of asbestos
fibers is known to be especially dangerous. But the contamination
was limited to the water and mud on the ground, making the risk to
people minimal if they avoided contact with it, Deputy Mayor Robert
Esnard said.
   Consolidated Edison, which owns the steam pipe, said no asbestos
fibers became airborne. The utility had an underground steam pipe
burst on Aug. 19, spewing fibers and forcing the evacuation of an
apartment building.
   The water-main break cut off water service temporarily Sunday,
and 20 buildings including a hospital remained without hot water
today because the steam pipes were turned off. The hot water would
not be turned on until the city's cleanup was complete, said Laurie
Hanson, a Con Ed spokeswoman.
   Eighth Avenue between 52nd and 44th streets was to remain closed
to traffic at least through Tuesday as cleanup crews used foam and
water to get rid of the asbestos debris, said Department of
Transportation chief Ross Sandler.
   Merchants were barred from their stores and residents from their
apartments in the area. The Red Cross set up a shelter at a school.
   Subway service along Eighth Avenue and on a shuttle that connects
major bus and train stations was expected to be disrupted through
today, the Transit Authority said.

<HEAD>Plane Missing Over Amazon Jungle After Pilot Sought Emergency Landing</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A domestic jetliner with 54 people
on board disappeared over the northern Amazon jungle after the pilot
radioed that he was trying to make an emergency landing, a Varig
airline official said today.
   The Boeing 737 vanished Sunday evening on the last leg of a
regular run between Sao Paulo and Belem at the mouth of the Amazon
river, Varig spox Gilberto Brito.
   The plane was carrying 48 passengers and a crew of six, all
Brazilian, he said.
   In an official communique, Varig said the cause of the
disappearance was unknown. Officials said the pilot did not indicate
why he needed to make the emergency landing.
   Brito said the plane took off from Sao Paulo Sunday morning and
made scheduled stops in Uberaba, Uberlandia, Goiania, Brasilia,
Imperatriz and Maraba.
   The plane departed in good weather from Maraba at 5:25 p.m. and
was scheduled to arrive an hour later in Belem.
   ``In his last contact, the pilot said he would try an emergency
landing,'' Brito said.
   Varig and air force rescue teams began searching for the plane
Sunday night in the dense jungle area and resumed the operation
after daybreak today.

<HEAD>Chinese Culture Minister Ousted, Other Officials Linked to Corruption</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Chinese government announced today it has
sacked the culture minister, a novelist who supported the rights of
artists to creative freedom.
   Wang Meng was the highest-ranking official to lose his job during
the crackdown prompted by last spring's pro-democracy protests.
   In a separate campaign, authorities have accused other top
government officials of corruption, according to official media and
a source in Hong Kong. In addition to demanding more democracy, the
student demonstrators had called for an end to widespread official
corruption.
   State-run China Central Television announced today that Wang, 54,
had been removed from his post as culture minister by the Standing
Committee of the National People's Congress.
   It said He Jingzhi, a poet and deputy head of the ruling
Communist Party's propaganda department, is taking Wang's place.
Last month, he replaced Wang as party head in the Culture Ministry.
   The television news, in explaining the dismissal, said, ``Comrade
Wang Meng is one of our famous writers (who) repeatedly asked to be
relieved of his official posts to concentrate on his writing.''
   However, there have been unconfirmed reports Wang was in trouble
since the campaign against political dissent began two months ago.
He did not appear with other ministers to extend greetings to
martial law troops after the suppression of student demonstrations
in Beijing and has not been seen in public since that military
assault on June 4.
   Wang's dismissal follows the purge June 24 of party chief Zhao
Ziyang and Politburo member Hu Qili. Zhao has been blamed for
permitting ``bourgeois liberalization,'' or pro-Western thought, to
spread throughout the party and the nation.
   The appointment of Wang in 1986 was hailed by Chinese artists and
intellectuals as an indication of the government's increased
tolerance toward freedom of expression.
   Wang said upon his appointment that he wanted ``to build a kind
of bridge between writers and the party Central Committee.''
   ``I honestly support party policy and also honestly stand for the
creative freedom of writers. There's no contradiction,'' he said at
the time.
   While in office, he maintained a careful balance between the two
sides, publicly stating that artists must contribute to Communism
but privately encouraging creative expression.
   Wang was one of the Chinese art world's leading victims of Mao
Tse-tung's ``anti-rightist'' campaign of 1957 and the 1966-76
Cultural Revolution.
   In 1957, he was condemned for a short story about apathetic party
cadres and subjected to years of internal banishment and hard labor.
He was not allowed to publish again until 1979, three years after
the Cultural Revolution.
   The latest accusation of corruption came in the official press
today with the announced dismissal of Xu Yunian, the top trade
official in southern China's Guangdong province.
   Xu, director of the provincial Foreign Economic Relations and
Trade Committee, was under investigation for using $57,500 in public
money to buy an imported car and portable telephones for himself,
the reports said.
   He also used his position to obtain a five-room apartment for his
family, the official Xinhua News Agency said.
   A source in Hong Kong said today that Liang Xiang, governor of
the southern island province of Hainan, had also been removed.
   Officials reached by telephone in Hainan would only say that
``nothing has been decided'' on the fate of Liang, who was formerly
party secretary in the special economic zone of Shenzhen adjacent to
Hong Kong.
   On Friday, the Ministry of Supervision announced that Tuhti
Sabir, vice chairman of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous region, had
been ousted for ``abusing his power by supporting speculation and
taking bribes.'' The ministry said Sabir took bribes worth $4,324.

<TEXT>
   Leaders from 102 non-aligned
countries opened a summit today with calls for reforming their Third
World movement and discarding anti-Western dogma of the past.
   In a speech at Belgrade's modernistic Sava Center, President
Janez Drnovsek of Yugoslavia, who chairs the movement, praised its
achievements. It was founded in this Yugoslav capital 28 years ago.
   However, he said the movement now must adapt itself to ``changes
in international relations, which we are witnessing but in which we
have not always participated.''
   To this end, he said, it must discard ``various ideological
concepts.''
   The movement, a strong advocate of decolonization and the
``struggle against imperialism'' in the 1960s and 1970s, has been
steadily declining in importance during the past decade. A series of
wars among member countries, deteriorating economies, and East-West
detente have relegated it to the sidelines of international politics.
   In an effort to reverse the decline, Yugoslavia has prepared for
adoption at the summit a draft document stressing the need for a
``North-South dialogue'' to stimulate economic development and
calling for settlements in conflicts among member countries.
   The draft avoids polemical attacks on the West, a hallmark of
previous summit declarations. For the first time, it also includes
references to respect of human rights, environmental issues and the
need to combat drug trafficking.
   In his speech opening the conference, President Robert Mugabe of
Zimbabwe told the session that a dialogue between industrial
Northern nations and developing Southern countries was ``no longer a
choice but a necessity.''
   Also at the opening session, President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt,
speaking in behalf of African countries, called for an ``intensified
dialogue'' with creditor nations to resolve the deepening debt
crisis.
   But he warned against creating ``an atmosphere of hostility and
confrontation.''

   A former IRA guerrilla sentenced
to 30 terms of life imprisonment for sending letter bombs to British
officials has been freed because he renounced violence, officials
said.
   Shane Paul O'Doherty, 33, left Maghaberry prison in Northern
Ireland on Sunday after serving 13 years, a spokesman for the
government's Northern Ireland Office in London said. He spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   O'Doherty claimed to have undergone a transformation after
spending two years in jail and in a television broadcast from prison
last month he publicly renounced violence and the Irish Republican
Army.
   To be nearer his family, he was later transferred to prison in
Northern Ireland from Wormwood Scrubs jail in London, where he had
been serving his sentence.
   O'Doherty joined the outlawed IRA fighting British rule in
Northern Ireland when he was a schoolboy in Londonderry. He
masterminded an 18-month long letter-bomb campaign in the 1970s, and
his targets included then-Prime Mrime minister Edward Heath and Home
Secretary Reginald Maudling. Neither was hurt.
   O'Doherty was arrested in May 1975 when an IRA woman was killed
in a Londonderry apartment where he made bombs.
   He was convicted of attempted murder and given 30 life sentences
in 1976.

   Underground Palestinian leaders today told
residents of the Israeli-occupied territories to stop killing
suspected collaborators without approval from the leadership.
   The statement appeared to be aimed at stemming a rash of killings
that have left 106 Arabs dead since the Palestinian uprising began
in December 1987. Most of the dead were accused of collaborating,
but some were suspected of drug sales or prostitution.
   Nearly two-thirds of the deaths have occurred this year,
including 13 in August and six this month.
   The Israeli army says at least 245 collaborators have also been
wounded by fellow Arabs.
   In their latest underground leaflet, leaders of the revolt said
Palestinians ``should refrain from rash decisions'' about suspected
collaborators and consult the uprising leaders before warning or
punishing them.
   ``A chance should be given to repent, and dialogue and
watchfulness should be employed as a better alternative than
punishment,'' said the leaflet, which was circulated in the occupied
West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Israeli officials on Sunday announced that rules for shooting at
suspected enforcers of the uprising would be broadened. They said
Israeli forces would be allowed to use live ammunition at any hour
of the day or night to stop masked Palestinians trying to avoid
arrest.
   Sources said that previously troops could only use live
ammunition in such circumstances at night.
   There have been increasing reports that Israeli security forces
are arming collaborators. The Hebrew daily Maariv said today that
the Arabs were also receiving weapons training.
   In scattered clashes today in the territories, seven Palestinians
were reported wounded by army gunfire.
   In the 21-month uprising aimed at ending Israeli rule, 557
Palestinians have been killed by Israeli soldiers or civilians, and
39 Israelis have died in the violence.
   Also today, two members of the Civil Guard were dismissed for
failing to act on reports that subordinates beat 20 Arabs three
weeks ago in a dormitory. Five of the Arabs were hospitalized.
   The independent Yediot Ahronot said that in addition to beating
the Arabs, the volunteer policemen took them to a rooftop and
insisted they hit each other.

<HEAD>Official Says East German Displeasure Delays Exodus</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   East Germany has delayed the mass exodus
of its citizens to the West from Hungary, a Hungarian official was
quoted as saying today.
   Interior Minister Istvan Horvath indicated it might even be weeks
before the thousands of East Germans are allowed to leave Hungary in
the unique emigration opportunity.
   About 5,000 East Germans are huddled in emergency camps in
Hungary awaiting safe passage to West Germany. Bonn and Communist
Hungary agreed on a plan in which the East Germans would be allowed
to emigrate to the West, and Red Cross officials overseeing the
camps said the exodus may take place this week.
   But Horvath, interviewed in the Hamburg weekly Stern, was quoted
as saying East and West Germany must reach agreement in the refugee
crisis, and that this could take ``perhaps a month, or one and a
half.''
   Stern did not say when the interview took place. A Foreign
Ministry spokesman in Bonn said he knew of no change in Budapest's
position.
   A well-placed Hungarian official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, told The Associated Press his government is reluctant to
authorize the mass transport to West Germany until it can placate
its angry allies in East Berlin.
   ``There is need for further talks'' with East Germany, he said.
   Red Cross official Wolfgang Wagner said Sunday the caravan would
begin leaving this week, fueling speculation that Hungary would risk
East German displeasure but was waiting for the maximum number of
refugees to arrive at the camp so it could make the transfer a
one-time occurrence.
   Unseasonable cold and intermittent drizzle at the refugee camps
increased the pressure on the Hungarians to begin the transfer.
   Outside one of the five emergency camps sheltering shivering
refugees, West German diplomat Gunter Mulack told reporters that
Bonn is just waiting for Budapest's word to launch the caravan
westwards through Austria to newly built tent cities in Bavaria.
   If successful, the transfer would amount to the largest single
transfer of East Germans to the West since the Berlin Wall was built
in 1961, and would represent unprecedented cooperation between an
East bloc and NATO nation to resettle thousands of citizens of
another Warsaw Pact country in the West.
   More than 500 new arrivals registered today with Red Cross
officials managing the four overflowing camps in Budapest and a
fifth opened Friday in Zanka.
   The lake is a popular destination with many of the 1 million East
Germans who holiday in Hungary each year. Up to 200,000 are
currently thought to be in the country, and Hungarian Premier Miklos
Nemeth has said up to 20,000 of them may want to go to West Germany.
   Some of the East Germans have been camping out for more than four
weeks, and a few are said to be suffering from colds and other
illnesses.
   Vacationing East Germans began crowding the West German Embassy
in July to demand safe passage to West Germany, forcing the closure
of the mission last month.
   Hungarian officials have maintained throughout that resolution of
the standoff was a bilateral matter between the two Germanys.
   But Communist Party president Rezso Nyers told a visiting West
German politician last week that Budapest would allow the East
Germans to go west, in effect breaking a 1969 bilateral agreement
with allied East Berlin to send back those who try to flee.
   The decision has clearly embittered East Germany, whose hardline
Communist leadership has been increasingly critical of Hungary's
recent reforms and moves toward a multi-party democracy.
   With legal travel to the West difficult, but permission for trips
to Hungary relatively easy to obtain, thousands of East Germans have
decided to test Hungary's new commitment.

   Businesses opened today after a
week-long strike called by Sinhalese militants, but continuing
violence left at least seven people dead, authorities said.
   State-run buses plied the roads, carrying workers to their jobs,
and customers lined up outside banks and shops. Security forces
remained on alert to prevent militant violence, officials said.
   The strike was enforced by an extremist Sinhalese group to
protest the presence of Indian peacekeeping troops and what it says
is a campaign of genocide by security forces.
   In central Sri Lanka, suspected Sinhalese militants stormed a
military camp and two police stations but were repulsed by security
forces, who killed two attackers and captured one, military
officials said today.
   Radicals believed to belong to the People's Liberation Front, an
extremist Sinhalese group trying for more than two years to
overthrow the government, launched the attacks Sunday night in the
district of Kandy, said the officials who cannot be identified under
briefing rules.
   The extremists dressed in military uniforms and armed with
automatic weapons opened fire on a military camp outside Kandy town,
about 55 miles northeast of Colombo, the officials said. Soldiers
returned fire, killing one militant, they said.
   Troops from a nearby roadblock ambushed the raiders as they tried
to flee, killing one and capturing another, the officials said.
   At the same time, they said, extremists attacked police stations
in the villages of Galagedara and Kadugannawa, but were repulsed by
officers. There were no casualties.
   Radicals also detonated explosives as a military vehicle passed,
injuring one soldier, the officials said.
   Elsewhere, one Sinhalese man was killed by two unidentified
gunmen and police found four bodies in Menikhinna town in Kandy
district, authorities said. Opposition politicians and human rights
groups have accused military and pro-government vigilante groups of
killing hundreds of civilians suspected of sympathizing with the
Sinhalese radicals.
   The government denies the charge and accuses the People
Liberation Front of killings more than 5,000 people in its
2-year-old campaign of terror and assassinations.
   The front claims the government gave too many concessions to the
Tamil rebels fighting for an independent homeland in north and east
Sri Lanka. It also opposes the presence of Indian peacekeeping
troops deployed to enforce an India-sponsored peace accord on the
island.
   Tamils comprise 18 percent of the island's 16 million people and
claim they are discriminated against in jobs and education by the
Sinhalese, who make up 75 percent of the population and control the
government and military.
   More than 11,000 people, including 1,000 Indian troops, have been
killed since the Tamil rebellion began in 1983.

   Afghan rebels said today they repulsed
government troops fighting to recapture key outposts in the garrison
town of Khost.
   A guerrilla spokesman, Abdul Rahim, said about 7,000 rebel
fighters have dug in to the north and south of the beseiged town,
about 10 miles south of the Pakistan border.
   Rahim said rebels, who call themselves mujahedeen, or Islamic
holy warriors, routed government troops fighting to retake Daragai,
a critical outpost about three miles south of Khost.
   Slightly further south, a second outpost at Willim is under rebel
seige, said Rahim. A mujahedeen field commander returning to
Pakistan from Khost said more than 170 Afghan army soldiers defected
during fighting at Willim.
   Meanwhile, government jetfighters have been pounding rebel
positions and lobbing hundreds of shells at advancing guerrillas,
said a second spokesman, Abdul Kabir.
   ``There has been constant bombing and shelling,'' he said.
   A rebel victory at Khost, the last border post of any size still
in Communist government hands, would open a direct link to rebel
fighters in western and northern Afghanistan, said Rahim.
   Rebel convoys supplied at depots in Pakistan are now forced to
take long and circuitous routes around Khost.
   U.S.-backed rebels have been fighting to topple successive
Communist governments for 11 years. Soviet soldiers fought along
side their Afghan allies for nine of those years, but withdrew on
Feb. 15 under a U.N.-brokered accord.
   Meanwhile, rebels also reported an attack on a major government
military air base at Shindand in western Afghanistan. There were no
reports of casualties, but rebel sources said the base was badly
damanaged.

<TEXT>
   National Guardsmen with rifles helped
enforce an overnight curfew after a second night of violence
followed the looting of more than 100 stores by young people in town
for a fraternity festival.
   The curfew issued after a Labor Day weekend gathering of students
from mostly black colleges turned violent was lifted this morning.
   The resort's main thoroughfare, Atlantic Avenue, was reopened and
families began heading for the beach for the last holiday of the
summer.
   Officials in this town of 250,000 praised police, but a civil
rights leader said officers contributed to the tension that touched
off the riot.
   A 35-minute sweep by club-wielding officers late Sunday added
dozens of arrests to the 160 arrests and 395 citations between
Friday evening and Sunday afternoon. Police had no immediate figures
on the number of arrests overnight.
   Two people, both over college age, were shot in the first night
of violence.
   ``Last year, everything was real nice. There was no violence ...
but this year the place was jammed with police and they were
hassling people,'' said Paul Williams, a 21-year-old student from
Philadelphia's Temple University.
   Another witness said some participants chanted a slogan from the
hit film ``Do The Right Thing,'' which is about racial violence in
New York City.
   ``We will not tolerate lawlessness from anybody,'' Mayor Meyera
E. Obendorf said. ``Let the word go out that Virginia Beach will not
stand by and watch as unruly individuals trash our city.''
   In an interview on NBC's ``Today'' show this morning, the mayor
said police ``have shown extraordinary restraint'' in making
arrests. She said police had fired no shots and had not used tear
gas.
   She said the city has ``gone out of its way'' to welcome the
young people gathered for the annual Greekfest, which attracts
students from up and down the East Coast. She said some students had
complaints about the way they were treated, but ``there's no excuse
for trashing a city if you're not happy with your circumstances.''
   But Jack W. Gravely, president of the Virginia chapter of the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, faulted
the city's tactics as much as ``an element who came to disrupt'' the
students' gathering.
   During last year's Greekfest, police cleared smaller groups of
young people from the street. Other large fraternity gatherings have
erupted in violence in the past, including a beach party in Wantagh,
N.Y., in July at which three people were shot. And some Florida
towns packed with college students every spring have seen scattered
street disturbances, alcohol problems and vandalism over the years.
   Sunday night, dozens of officers and 150 National Guardsmen armed
with assault rifles and wooden batons left the Visitors Center for
the beach area two blocks away.
   ``Once the police came on the scene, the tension level rose,''
Gravely said. ``The students had what I call an attitude of
controlled defiance. They did not understand what they had done to
warrant this treatment.''
   He said Virginia Beach officials should have been better prepared
for the annual gathering of students from predominantly black East
Coast colleges.
   City officials said they had no choice but to use force after
young people went on a rampage early Sunday down beachfront Atlantic
Avenue.
   The authorities estimated 100,000 young people jammed a 30-block
section around 2:15 a.m. When police tried to clear the streets,
shots were fired, more than 100 businesses were looted and small
fires were set in the streets, city officials said.
   By the time order was restored around dawn, four people were
reported injured. They remained in hospitals today, two with gunshot
wounds, one critically injured in a balcony fall and one in serious
condition after an auto accident during the disturbance.
   By 6 p.m. Sunday, Atlantic Avenue was again crowded with young
people, though many shops were boarded up. Two hours later,
officials closed all streets leading into the beach, allowing in
only residents.
   A short time later, the guardsmen moved in, followed by
explosions that sounded like firecrackers, causing momentary panic
among about 250 young people.
   Bottles were thrown at officers. Ten-man squads of police, backed
by an armored state police truck and a SWAT team, began making
arrests.
   By 9:30 p.m., hundreds of police in wedge formations swept the
beachfront, with a police helicopter overhead. They were met by a
hail of bottles from balconies and parking decks, but cleared the
streets by 11.
   ``When they tried to move people, it went crazy,'' said Errin
Smith, 20, of New York. ``People were yelling `Fight the Power!' At
first people were just having a good time, but they harassed us from
the minute we got here.''
   ``Fight the power'' is the musical theme of ``Do The Right
Thing,'' a current movie about racism and the death of a young black
man at the hands of police.
   The mayor said the decision to clear the streets was made by
commanders at the scene after reports of looting and shots fired.
   Gravely said he and an NAACP attorney were meeting with the mayor
at the time and were not told of any looting or shooting.
   ``It's been like we're being singled out because we are young and
black,'' said Charles Stone, 23, of New York City.
   Merchants denied slighting the students, most of whom they said
were nice. But some shopkeepers said they were not surprised by the
trouble.
   ``We tried to welcome these people. We'd been hearing rumors all
week that something was going to happen,'' said Bobbi Basnight, an
Atlantic Avenue merchant.
   ``Our problem is we had so many people in a small area,'' said
Arnie Cohen, whose shop was spared. ``I don't care if they were
Jewish, black or whatever ... with all those people with so little
to do and some of them drinking ... it's a volatile situation.''

   A Bush administration spokesman today
praised Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, the Nicaraguan opposition
candidate for president, as ``a strong fighter for democracy.''
   Roman Popadiuk, the White House deputy press secretary for
foreign affairs, said Mrs. Chamorro ``has wide respect among the
Nicaraguan people and has been a strong fighter for democracy.''
   He added, ``She also brings a great deal of international
recognition and prestige'' as the standard bearer for the democratic
opposition.
   The Chamorro family publishes the opposition newspaper in
Managua, La Prensa. She was a member of the first government formed
by the Sandinistas a decade ago after they threw out dictator
Anastasio Somoza.
   The Bush administration has taken a cautious approach to the
elections scheduled for February 1990, saying it remains to be seen
whether the Marxist government actually allows free balloting.

<HEAD>Eds: UPDATES with warning lifted. No pickup.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PALMER, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A powerful earthquake off Alaska early
today prompted 5,000 residents of Kodiak to take to higher ground
for fear a seismic sea wave would hit at dawn, but the threat
subsided without incident, officials said.
   The quake registering 6.9 on Richter scale struck at 9:15 a.m.
EDT and was centered about 140 miles southwest of Kodiak Island,
said the U.S. Geological Survey in Golden, Colo. There was no
immediate indication the quake was felt on land.
   George Carte, a seismologist at the Alaska Tsunami Warning
Center, had warned of a possible tsunami in Alaska and British
Columbia, with Kodiak the first point to be hit about 11 a.m. EDT,
but lifted the warning within hours.
   ``We're past our ETA and there's been no wave action,'' said
Kodiak police dispatcher Kathy Cliver. Police said they would allow
some 5,000 residents back into their homes in the island community
at the foot of a mountain.
   Carte said the center's gauge at Sand Point, 180 miles west of
the quake's epicenter, recorded a small tsunami of less than
one-half foot.
   ``Therefore, no destructive tsunami threat exists for coastal
areas in the Pacific,'' he said.
   ``Some small sea-level changes may be recorded, however, as local
conditions can cause a wide variation in tsunami wave action. The
all-clear determinations must be made by local authorities.''
   Carte gave no estimate of how big a wave generated by the quake
might be.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion in which every
increase of one number means a tenfold increase in magnitude.
   An earthquake of 7 is a major quake, capable of widespread heavy
damage.
   The 1964 Alaska quake that killed 131 people measured 8.4, while
the San Francisco quake of 1906 was estimated to register 8.3.

   A gunman sprayed passengers in the
Medellin airport with automatic rifle fire today, and police said
two people, including the attacker, were killed and 12 wounded.
   The other person killed was an airline passenger identified as
the business manager of a Medellin paint company whose factory was
bombed last week, apparently by terrorists working for drug
traffickers, authorities said.
   The motive for today's attack was not immediately known, but
Medellin is home to the world's largest cocaine cartel. The city,
215 miles north of Bogota, has been wracked daily by terrorist-style
violence from drug traffickers enraged by a government crackdown.
   The gunman was wearing a military uniform when he drove up to the
airport, about 15 miles outside of the city, at about 7:15 a.m.,
police said.
   He entered the terminal and began firing at a line of passengers
waiting at the ticket counter for an Avianca flight to Bogota, they
said.
   One passenger was killed and the attacker was shot dead by
airport police who returned fire, a national police spokeswoman in
Medellin told The Associated Press by telephone. As is customary,
she gave information on condition she not be identified by name.
   Nine other civilians and three police officers were wounded, she
said.
   She identified the gunman's weapon as a Israeli-made G-3
automatic rifle.
   The civilian who was killed was Rafael Arango Cuarta, 27, the
spokeswoman said. According to the national radio network Caracol,
he was a business administrator for a Medellin-based paint company,
Pintuco, the country's largest.
   Pintuco's factory was bombed last Thursday in one of an almost
daily series of attacks blamed on the cocaine cartels.
   Col. Luis Camejo, the national police commander for Antioquia
province, said the gunman ``began to fire indiscriminately.''
   On Sunday night, a bomb tore through shops in an industrial
suburb of Medellin and wounded five people, authorities said.
   The bomb attack came just hours after U.S. military gear began
arriving, along with ground crews, trainers and technicians, for use
in the government's 2-week-old offensive against the nation's
ruthless and powerful cocaine chietains.
   The bomb blast in the southern Medellin suburb of Itagui heavily
damaged a two-story commercial building including a bank, an
insurance company office, a shoe store and an optical shop, an
Itagui police spokesman said by telephone. He asked to remain
anonymous.
   Five people were wounded, Alonso Villanueva of the Colombia Red
Cross in Itagui said by telephone. The blast came half an hour
before a 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew took effect in Medellin and
several suburbs, including Itagui.
   There was no claim of responsibility, but the attack was similar
to others carried out by drug traffickers who are combating an
unprecendented government anti-narcotics sweep that began Aug. 18
when a leading presidential hopeful was assassinated.
   In the sweep, authorities have seized hundreds of millions of
dollars in property and arrested thousands of suspects.
   Two bombs were tossed from a motorcycle into a garden of
Medellin's Intercontinental Hotel on Sunday but no one was hurt,
police said.
   In the northwestern city of Monteria, a C-123 airplane of the
U.S. State Department's anti-narcotics division burned at an airport
Sunday, a U.S. Embassy spokesman in Bogota said.
   The plane was bound from Peru to the United States when it made
an emergency landing in Monteria because an engine failed, the
spokesman said. He said the cause of the fire was being investigated.
   Drug traffickers have declared a ``total and absolute war'' on
the state, judges, industrialists and journalists in response to the
government crackdown, which has included seizure of their property
and renewal of extradition to the United States.
   Eight A-37 observation and attack jets from Air National Guard
bases in Illinois and Michigan were expected to be delivered today
to the country's military at the Caribbean port city of Barranquilla.
   According to U.S. Ambassador Thomas McNamara, the shipment also
includes other, unspecified gear as part of part of a $65 million
emergency aid package approved by President Bush to help Colombia
wage its anti-drug war.
   The United States also has promised rifles, pistols, machine
guns, rockets and grenades _ even bulletproof vests for Colombian
officials and judges who prosecute drug traffickers.
   The aid began arriving Sunday when two hulking U.S. C-130
transport planes landed at a Bogota air base. They were formally
handed over by U.S. air force officials and McNamara to the
Colombian military.
   The C-130s, powered by four turboprop engines, can take off and
land on unpaved runways as short as 3,000 feet and could be used in
raids on remote coca-leaf plantations and clandestine
cocaine-refining laboratories.
   Five UH-1H transport helicopters, which the Pentagon already said
would be given to Colombia's anti-drug forces, were to arrive
Tuesday, McNamara said.
   Washington has said as many as 200 American military personnel
may come to Colombia to assist security forces in installing and
operating the American equipment. This is a potential sore point, as
Colombian officials have said they don't want American troops.

   Police fired bullets and tear gas
today to break up an anti-election rally at a university in Durban,
causing a stampede that left 10 people injured, witnesses said.
   About 2,500 students at the multi-racial University of Natal
defied a police ban on the meeting to protest Wednesday's
parliamentary elections, from which blacks are excluded. Police
arrested 18 protesters, the witnesses said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   The witnesses said 10 people were injured when the crowd fled the
gunfire and tear gas.
   In a similar rally at the nearby University of Durban-Westville,
eight people were arrested when police swinging batons dispersed 500
students at a banned demonstration.
   It was unclear if anyone was struck by bullets. Police had no
immediate comment on either of the protests.
   Earlier today, police spokesman Brig. Leon Mellet said police
were ``prepared to come down mercilessly and hard on anyone who
wishes to disrupt the elections.''
   Meanwhile, thousands of black workers and students were poised
for a two-day general strike beginning Tuesday to protest the
exclusion of the black majority from the polls.
   On Sunday, thousands of blacks marched on a beach reserved for
whites. Police arrested 58 people during the protest, the latest in
a series of acts of defiance protesting the white-led government's
refusal to allow the black majority a vote in national affairs.
   ``We want to tell (Acting President) F.W. de Klerk that we are
going to defy until we are free,'' black Anglican Archbishop Desmond
Tutu told about 1,000 people at a church service Sunday in
Bonteheuvel, a mixed-race township outside Cape Town.
   Police have arrested more than 1,500 demonstrators and detained
without charge an additional 240 activists since the defiance
campaign began Aug. 2, according to the Human Rights Commission, an
independent civil rights group.
   Major anti-apartheid groups and the country's two largest black
labor federations have endorsed protests on Tuesday and Wednesday as
part of the nationwide defiance campaign.
   The organizations have not called specifically for a general
strike, which is illegal under the 3-year-old state of emergency.
But in the past, such protests have resulted in mass strikes.
   The multi-racial University of Cape Town, the site of frequent
anti-apartheid demonstrations, announced today that it would be
closed Tuesday and Wednesday.
   ``For the university to adopt an attitude of business as usual in
the context of the tensions surrounding the elections and the denial
of fundamental freedoms ... would be neither principled nor
possible,'' Vice Chancellor Stuart Saunders said in a statement.
   The crowd of beach protesters stretched for more than a mile
along the shore. Several dozen whites, some carrying whips and
wearing ``whites only'' T-shirts, yelled abuse as the throng paraded
along the segregated sections of South Africa's most heavily
frequented beachfront.
   Other sections of the hotel-lined Indian Ocean shore have been
opened to all races in recent years.
   One angry white man barged into the crowd, yelling and pushing,
but police said they could control the situation on their own. Some
whites yelled to the officers, ``Shoot them dead!''
   The police contingent of several hundred officers was equipped
with shotguns and a water cannon but made no efforts to stop the
protesters from moving onto the segregated beach.
   Previous targets of the defiance campaign have included
segregated hospitals, schools and buses.
   Many activists have defied restrictions imposed on them following
their release from detention, and several banned organizations have
declared that they were resuming operations.
   Protesters were whipped by police at a defiance protest at a
whites-only beach near Cape Town on Aug. 19. At least two Cabinet
ministers of the governing National Party have expressed regret for
that incident, but the government has given no public indication
that it is ready to make major changes in remaining segregation laws.
   Under apartheid, South Africa's 5 million whites control the
government and economy and maintain separate districts, schools and
health services.

   A gunshot hit a USAir plane coming
in for a landing and grazed a passenger's head, authorities said.
   The twin-engine turboprop was en route from the Bahamas with 16
passengers and three crew members Sunday when the bullet pierced a
door, ricocheted off the ceiling and struck Edward C. Wright,
authorities said.
   Wright, 42, of Dove Canyon, Calif., said he heard a popping noise
before feeling a bump on his head, said Jim Leljedal of the
sheriff's office.
   ``He first thought something had fallen and struck him, but he
saw nothing,'' Leljedal said. ``When Wright touched his head with
his hand, he found that he was bleeding.''
   Wright was treated at Broward General Medical Center and released.
   Sheriff's deputies searched near the airport but found no
suspects or witnesses.
   The FBI and the Federal Aviation Administration also were
investigating.
   ``At this point, we have not made any determination as to whether
this was a deliberate act or the result of an accident,'' said Paul
Miller, FBI spokesman in Miami.
   Another passenger, vacationing police officer Brian Anderson, of
Folly Beach, S.C., said the bullet passed about two seats behind
him. ``I get shot at in my job,'' he said. ``You just don't expect
to get shot on an airplane.''

   A powerboat operator ducked and
apparently saved his life seconds before the craft punched through
an anchored houseboat and killed a woman asleep on a couch,
authorities said.
   Investigators were trying to determine if the houseboat was
properly lit at the time of the crash off the Florida Keys. ``There
was no moon, so it was a dark night,'' said Lt. Bruce Buckson of the
Florida Marine Patrol.
   No charges were filed. Three other people on the houseboat were
not injured in Sunday's accident.
   The 18-foot fiberglass powerboat, used for fishing, knifed
through the sheet-metal walls of the houseboat and emerged intact on
the other side, said Coast Guard Petty Officer John Sewell.
   Buckson said the driver and owner of the powerboat, William
Cannon, estimated he was going 40 mph.
   ``If he hadn't ducked, it would have probably cut him in two from
the waist up,'' Sewell said. ``It's a wonder he came out as good as
he did.''
   Cannon, 23, of Islamorada, suffered cuts and was in shock. He
went straight to the Coast Guard station at Islamorada after the
accident. The crash broke off the boat's antenna, preventing Cannon
from radioing the Coast Guard, Sewell said.
   Barbara Basford, 38, of Jacksonville, was injured when the boat
passed over the couch, Buckson said. She died at Mariners' Hospital.

   Is it someone you see at church? Is it a sailor who
passed through town? It could be either or one of thousands of
others, say experts working on a serial murder case that's raised
many questions and yielded few answers.
   For a while Ronald Ray Griffith looked like a solid suspect.
   He drifted into southeastern Massachusetts about the time the
first of nine victims was reported missing and took off again last
fall, just as the bodies stopped turning up along highways.
   But when officials finally arranged to have Griffiths brought to
the seaport of New Bedford from Missouri, where he's serving time
for larceny, the unemployed carpenter's ``tips'' didn't pan out.
   Griffiths toyed with investigators before a lie detector test
confirmed he didn't know anything about the crimes, said Jim Martin,
spokesman for District Attorney Ronald A. Pina.
   And so it has gone in the 10 months local, state and federal
authorities have tracked the deaths of nine women and disappearances
of two others, all of them linked with Weld Square, a district known
for drugs and prostitution.
   The probe has cost $109,000 and 3,930 overtime hours.
   Undercover investigators have spent months on New Bedford's
seedier streets, questioning prostitutes and drug dealers who are
often fogged by alcohol, cocaine or heroin, Martin said.
   ``The circumstances surrounding the New Beford slayings are the
circumstances of sleaze and that's one of the critical problems,''
he said.
   Martin said the list of suspects was narrowed from four to three
once Griffiths was discounted and the probe's end is nowhere in
sight.
   ``We are by no means at a point where there's been any
consideration of pulling back,'' Martin said. ``There's a lot of
work to be done.''
   But serial murder experts say the money may never produce the
answers the victims' relatives crave and investigators seek.
   ``The odds are growing slimmer daily,'' said Jack Levin, a
criminal justice professor at Northeastern University and co-author
of ``Mass Murder: America's Growing Menace.''
   Some experts say investigators should look close to home; others
insist the assailants move on. They disagree on whether systematic
murderers inevitably lash out again.
   There's one point, however, on which the experts agree _ serial
murder cases are tough to crack.
   ``If enough crime scene data can be collected and if you get
lucky with a national system then maybe, maybe at the sixth or
seventh killing you'll get leads,'' said Robert O. Heck, an
architect of the FBI's serial killing unit and a manager at the
Justice Department's office of juvenile justice.
   Bud Merle, executive director of the Santa Cruz (Calif.) Criminal
Justice Council, said serial killers are ``more adept at escape and
evasion measures than most criminals and their crimes tend to be
more random.''
   Levin, however, said his research indicates most serial killers
stick to familiar territory. ``In the dark world of serial killing,
the vast majority kill on a part-time basis while playing with their
kids, attending church, carrying on a relationship with their
wife,'' he said.
   Under the circumstances and given the length of time since the
last victim's skeleton was turned up, the experts said the New
Bedford murderer or murderers may never be caught.
   ``If this case is ever solved it will most likely be in a
serendipitous way. Not through some logical connection of evidence
but because the killer turns up in another city and makes a mistake
there,'' Levin said.

<HEAD>Last Titan 3 Rocket Boosts Secret Military Satellite</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Air Force's last Titan 3 rocket
blasted off with a secret military satellite Monday, ending a
quarter century of launches by a workhorse booster that has hurled
more than 200 satellites into space.
   The 16-story-tall rocket, the powerful 34D model, brilliantly
illuminated the darkness as it blazed away from its launch pad at
1:54 a.m.
   The Air Force said it was the 135th success in 141 launches for
the Titan 3 family, a success rate of 96 percent.
   ``We close the book of the Titan 34D and move on to another
generation of launch vehicles,'' said Brig. Gen. Thomas W.
Honeywill, commander of the Air Force Systems Command.
   Officials said Monday's payload was secret. Sources who spoke on
condition on anonymity said the rocket may have carried a
reconnaissance satellite.
   Many of the satellites carried by Titan 3 rockets have been
cloaked in secrecy since the first was launched here in 1964.
   The payloads, most of them built for the Pentagon, have performed
a number of strategic assignments, including photo reconnaissance,
communications, navigation, monitoring missile tests, intercepting
military and diplomatic messages, verifying Soviet compliance with
arms treaties and establishing an orbiting system to provide instant
alert of a missile attack.
   Titan 3 rockets also launched two Viking spacecraft toward Mars
in 1976 and sent the Voyager 1 and 2 probes in 1977 toward the solar
system's outer reaches.
   Voyager 2 two weeks ago week sent back stunning images of Neptune
and its moon Triton as it completed a grand tour that also included
a closeup look at Uranus.
   The Titan 34D can boost 31,650-pound payloads into low orbit,
about 150 miles up, or 4,200 pounds to stationary orbit 22,300 miles
out.
   The Air Force is replacing it with the larger Titan 4, the first
of which boosted a missile warning satellite into orbit on June 14.
The new rocket can hoist 39,000 pounds to low orbit or 10,000 pounds
to stationary orbit.
   Martin Marietta Space Launch Systems has a contract to build 23
Titan 4s for the Air Force for $5.1 billion and is negotiating for
an additional 26 rockets.
   Martin Marietta developed the Titan 3 series for the Air Force
from the Titan 2 intercontinental range nuclear missile, which
earlier had been modified to boost into orbit the two-man Gemini
capsule in the mid-1960s.
   The booster evolved through the Titan 3A, 3B, 3C and 34D series,
each more powerful than the last.
   ``With this launch, the Titan continued its unparalleled success
record,'' said Gareth D. Flora, president of Space Launch Systems.
   ``Titan expendable launch vehicles have been the backbone of the
Air Force's space program for more than 20 years, and we expect the
Titan 4 to continue that tradition.''

   Thousands of angry workers demanding
food and more pay demonstrated for the fourth day Monday in the
Macedonian capital of Skopje.
   Sources and the state-run television said about 3,000 textile
workers were demonstrating in front of the local legislature in
downtown Skopje, chanting ``Down with the government'' and ``We want
bread.''
   It was one in a series of strikes that has hit this communist
country in the past month.
   The television said the Skopje workers refused a 100 percent pay
increase offered to them by their factory managers and demanded a
200 percent wage increase.
   Yugoslavia is faced with its worst economic and political crisis.
The annual inflation rate is about 1,000 percent and living
standards have dropped to the level of mid-1960, according to
official statistics.
   Macedonia is the poorest of Yugoslavia's six republics.

<HEAD>Medellin Cartel Has Many Trappings of Nation State</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A troubling challenge facing President Bush as
he gropes for ways to combat drug smuggling is the emergence of a
drug ``super state'' in Latin America, an entity with many of the
trappings of a nation state.
   The drug ``super state'' _ a term once used by a Colombian
attorney general shortly before he was murdered by drug traffickers
last year _ has a defense establishment, controls large swaths of
territory, issues communiques, and even boasts what amounts to a
``commerce department,'' which assiduously promotes the export of
cocaine and other illicit drugs.
   It also has what its defenders regard as a progressive political
philosophy.
   Diego Cordoba, a lawyer employed by Colombian drug barons,
contended in an interview with a Brazilian newspaper last year that
drug trafficking has done more to alleviate poverty and hunger in
Latin America than any government in the region.
   Another lawyer for the traffickers, Mario Arango, wrote in a
best-selling book that the drug business has opened new
opportunities for the underprivileged classes.
   ``The money from the drug traffic has acted as a brake on the
social and political deterioration of the country,'' Arango says.
   According to U.S. government figures, as much as $1.7 billion in
cocaine-generated revenues last year bolstered the economies of Peru
and Bolivia, the two largest cocaine producers in the world. The
figure for Colombia, the conduit for 80 per cent of the cocaine
consumed in the United States and Europe, is estimated at $4 billion.
   The super state boasts a formidible defense establishment. While
the underfunded Colombian police have about 30 helicopters at their
disposal, one single trafficker, Jorge Luis Ochoa, reportedly has 50
aircraft and an arsenal of weapons.
   Unlike the Colombian government, which requires months and
sometimes years to acquire weaponry for its military, the drug
traffickers _ unhindered by red tape _ can get what they want in
days or even hours.
   Another characteristic of a nation state the drug lords have is
the ability to declare war. After Colombian President Virgilio Barco
ordered a crackdown on the drug traffickers two weeks ago _
confiscating millions of dollars worth of property and arresting
11,000 suspects _ the cartel issued a statement asserting the
existence of a state of ``absolute and total war'' with the
government.
   If the drug super state has a capital, it is, of course,
Medellin, a city located about 150 miles northwest of Bogota.
Medellin is desribed as the ``central star'' of a ``sprawling,
fluctuating constellation'' by Douglas Payne, director of
hemispheric studies for the pro-democracy research organization
Freedom House.
   The super state has numerous branch offices, including one in
Panama where a key ally, Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, from time to
time has welcomed Colombian drug kingpins needing a safe haven.
   With the combined economic, political and military powers of a
government, Payne says, the cartel is now acting like a state and
asking to be treated like one.
   He asks: ``Will Diego Cordoba some day be addresing the United
Nations, offering proposal for cooperation in alleviating the social
and economic problems of Latin America?
   ``Will he present the first drug-based development model?''
   The drug barons for some time have sought what amounts to
``state-to-state relations'' with the Colombian government and some
prominent politicians are advocating a dialogue with them.
   Thus far, at least, Barco has held firm to his hard-line,
no-negotiations stance.
   ``We will not be cowed,'' he has said. ``We shall prevail over
the forces that would destroy our democracy and enslave our nation.''
   But, with President Bush scheduled to outline is anti-drug
program in a speech Tuesday, Raymond Hesse, a top official in the
State Department's Bureau of International Narcotics Matters, warns
that unless decisive action is taken soon, the drug traffickers may
prevail.
   ``The history of this hemisphere may some day reflect that what
we do in the next year, the next five years, in this war against
narcotics traffickers, may be as influential in determining the
economic and political future (of South America) as any other type
of activity we conduct,'' Hesse says.

<HEAD>Culture Minister Ousted, Top Officials Sacked for Corruption</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>

   The legislature Monday dismissed the culture
minister, a novelist who supported freedom of expression among
artists. He was the highest-ranking government official to lose his
post in a crackdown on political dissent.
   Also Monday, the official news media reported that several top
government officials had been implicated in a campaign against
corruption.
   Wang Meng was dismissed from his job as culture minister by the
standing committee of the National People's Congress, China's
legislature.
   Poet He Jingzhi, who has served as deputy chief of the ruling
Communist Party's propaganda deparment, was named to replace Wang,
state-run national television and radio reported.
   Premier Li Peng, who ordered martial law during student-led
pro-democracy protests last spring, submitted the proposal to
dismiss Wang, the official Xinhua news agency said.
   China Central Television said Wang had ``repeatedly asked to be
relieved of his official posts to concentrate on writing and
literary criticism.''
   However, there was speculation Wang had been in trouble since
China launched the crackdown on dissent, beginning with a military
assault on Beijing protesters on June 3-4 that killed hundreds,
perhaps thousands, of unarmed civilians.
   Wang did not appear with other ministers to greet the troops who
swept through Beijing to break up protests.
   Previous news reports said Wang did not attend the party Central
Committee meeting in late June that purged moderate party chief Zhao
Ziyang, who sympathized with the spring protesters.
   Zhao allowed a measure of freedom for China's writers and
artists. Wang's appointment in 1986 was regarded as a sign of the
government's increasing tolerance of artistic expression. But the
government has been trying to reign in artists since crushing the
pro-democracy movement.
   As culture minister, Wang tried to walk a fine line between
official ideology and artistic freedom.
   Shortly before his appointment, Wang said, ``I honestly support
party policy and also honestly stand for the creative freedom of
writers. There's no contradiction.''
   In their reports on the anti-corruption drive, the official press
said Monday that the top trade official in south China's Guangdong
province was dismissed for corruption.
   Xu Yunian, director of the provincial Foreign Economic Relations
and Trade Committee, was under investigation for spending $57,000 in
public funds on an imported car and portable telephones for his
private use and for taking advantage of his position to obtain a
five-room apartment for his family, the reports said.
   The Ministry of Supervision announced last week it was stepping
up such investigations of high-ranking officials.
   In addition, a Western diplomat in Hong Kong said Monday that
Liang Xiang, governor of the southern island province of Hainan, was
removed from his post.
   However, Hainan officials reached by telephone would say only
that ``nothing has been decided.''
   Liang, formerly party secretary in Shenzhen, a special economic
zone next to Hong Kong, was close to Zhao and viewed as a symbol of
China's economic reform. But reports from Hong Kong have said he was
under investigation for encouraging family members to engage in
profiteering.

   Federal agents seized 25 tons of Middle
Eastern hashish valued at $150 million concealed in a false
compartment aboard a boat docked on the Columbia River.
   ``It means about 1 million people won't be lighting up in the
next 60 days,'' said Lawrence A. LaDage, agent in charge of the
Customs Service in the Northwest.
   The seven men arrested in Friday's bust, the largest on the West
Coast, will be arraigned Tuesday.
   The hashish was found aboard a 158-foot converted oil-rig supply
ship that had been under surveillance for six months, LaDage said.
The vessel had just returned from its first ocean voyage and
contained no other cargo.
   The ship was believed to have been supplied by a ``mother ship''
at sea, LaDage said. Customs and the Coast Guard searched for that
vessel, he said.
   The hashish was concealed in a false compartment, LaDage said.
Agents seized the drugs as they were being unloaded in plywood
containers designed to resemble bins for oil drums.
   Agents became suspicious as soon as the oil-rig supply vessel
appeared at the out-of-the-way dock in Columbia City, LaDage said.
``We don't have any offshore rigs around here,'' he said. ``It just
didn't look right.''
   Hashish, up to five times stronger than marijuana, is produced
from the marijuana plant's resin. LaDage said the hashish was
believed to have originated in the Middle East, possibly Pakistan or
Afghanistan.
   Previously, the biggest haul on the West Coast was about 12 tons
seized several years ago in San Francisco, he said.

   After a long day of performing brain surgery,
Dr. Bernard Stopak loves nothing better than slipping into a tuxedo,
grabbing a microphone and crooning ``Let's Get Away From It All''
before a night club audience.
   By day, he's a prominent neurosurgeon at George Washington
University Medical Center. By night, he's a cabaret singer who cures
his listeners' blues with a finger-snapping repertoire of jazz and
Broadway show tunes.
   A vocalist in the mellow Tony Bennett style, Bernie Stopak has
composed a few songs in his car, a sort of portable studio equipped
with tape deck. The tunes pop into his head while he's driving from
one hospital to another, he says.
   One of his originals, ``Remember Me,'' is the title song of his
first album, which was released in 1987 and features Stopak singing
such golden oldies as ``Makin' Whoopee'' and ``Old Devil Moon.''
   ``I was big in Elkton, Md.,'' he says with a smile. ``I was sixth
on the charts at the radio station there.''
   Stopak enjoys the best of both worlds _ medicine and show
business _ and sees a link between the two.
   ``The delicate surgery that I perform, which is often a
life-and-death situation, is really theater at its most dramatic,
and it requires a considerable degree of creativity,'' he said in an
interview.
   ``Singing, though certainly not life-threatening, can be very
inventive in creating various moods and interpretations of music.''
   The son of Russian immigrants who operated a mom-and-pop Jewish
delicatessen in Washington, Stopak grew up with music. His parents
gave him a violin when he was 5, and he still remembers his first
case of stage fright.
   ``I had to play at an elementary school talent show or
something,'' he said. ``I got so nervous seeing the crowd that I
turned around and played the violin with my back to the audience.''
   As he got older, Stopak played horns, saxophone and clarinet in
the local police boy's band, the old Washington Redskins band and a
jazz band he formed in high school called the Young Moderns. He
worked his way through the University of Maryland playing music.
   He also sang in student musicals and toured with two university
choral groups. By early 1961, he was good enough to sing with a
dance band at one of President Kennedy's inaugural balls, where he
attracted the attention of actress Angie Dickenson. A year or two
later, he flew to California to see her.
   ``I had a feeling I could make it in show business,'' he said,
but Miss Dickenson ``turned my life around.''
   ``She told me, `whatever you do in life, the first thing you have
to be is a man.' That's what I always heard from my family. `Zoy a
mensch _ Be a man.' I thought, do I want to be singing and playing
in life, or do I want to do something substantial? That's when I got
serious about medicine.''
   For the next quarter-century, Stopak studied medicine in France
and returned to perform thousands of operations and become associate
professor of neurosurgery at George Washington University,
specializing in brain surgery under a microscope.
   Then, nearly five years ago, some jazz musician friends made a
surprise appearance at his 48th birthday party, and Stopak
rediscovered the joy of singing with a combo. After he won applause
singing with the band at a friend's wedding at the Carlyle Hotel in
New York, Stopak decided it was time to pursue an after-hours
musical career.
   When he wasn't performing surgery, he was performing at jazz
clubs, restaurants, hotel lounges and other night spots in
Washington and New York until early 1988, when a traumatic divorce
put his singing on temporary hold.
   Now remarried to a fellow neurosurgeon, Juliet, and the proud
father of a son born last June, Stopak, 52, is eager to return to
the stage and recording studio.
   He no longer suffers stage fright, but admits that his mouth
still gets dry before he sings that first note.
   ``I am much more comfortable in the operating theater than on
stage,'' he said. ``In surgery, you have the time to make a move,
then back off, stop and think about it. But when you're performing,
you can't stop. If you make a mistake, you hum a few notes, laugh it
off, shrug and keep going.''
   Said Stopak: ``In surgery, if something goes wrong, the worst
that can happen is you lose the patient, which is always agonizing.
On stage, the worst they can do is boo, and I can handle that.''

   Silhouetted against the rising sun, nearly
3,000 riders, 300 covered wagons and 2,700 head of cattle set out
today on a 60-mile cattle drive in honor of Montana's statehood
centennial.
   The drive began in this small community on the high plains and
will end Saturday in the stockyards of Billings.
   Steam jetted from the nostrils of horses and cattle in the crisp
morning air as the herd, bawling and protesting, began its journey
south.
   The cattle were moved by whistling and whooping drovers, clad in
bright yellow slickers and carrying lassos and bullwhips. The
animals were herded past brilliant green alfalfa fields, through a
canyon and onto the open range.
   Cowboys and the curious thronged this town of 2,200 to
commemorate the cattle drives of the late 1800s. The event is the
biggest planned for Montana's 100th birthday.
   ``There have not been this many horsemen together since the
Battle of the Little Big Horn,'' said Barry McWilliams, an
organizer. ``It is stupendous. Anybody who doesn't see this is
really going to miss it.''
   The route of the Great Montana Centennial Cattle Drive ambles
south from the Musselshell River along U.S. 87, a two-lane blacktop,
to stockyards in Billings.
   Organizers faced problems with 20th century environmental
concerns, Humane Society objections and private property rights.
   As a result, the cattle, about 85 percent longhorns, often will
be separated by several miles from the 300 or so covered wagons on
the road.
   ``Everything has turned out right,'' said trail boss Jim Stovall.
``Ranch people just do it. We are going to solve the problems. The
cowboys will do it. I didn't really realize this was going to happen
until I got up here Wednesday morning behind a load of longhorns.''
   The non-profit Latigo Corp., the sponsoring organization,
originally contemplated 10,000 cattle, 5,000 riders and 500 wagons.
But although those numbers weren't met, the celebration swelled
Roundup with visitors in cars with license plates from at least 20
states.
   By Sunday evening, beer stands were doing a steady business and
country-western bands provided entertainment.
   Several people said they were taking part in the drive because
they expect it to be a unique experience.
   ``I don't want to brag,'' said Sam Redding of Hardin, ``but we'll
never see anything like this again.''
   ``I've never done anything like this, and I don't know anybody
who has,'' said George Schiller of East Helena.
   Ellen Hargrave, who runs a ranch outside Kalispell with her
husband, Leo, took a longer view: ``I want to be a part of history.''

   An Iranian official said President Bush
has written letters to Iran's leaders, and that Western hostages
held in Lebanon may be freed if Washington releases Iranian assets,
Iranian news media said today.
   The comments by Deputy Foreign Minister Ali Mohammad Besharati
were based on an interview in the English-language Tehran Times and
carried by the official Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in
Nicosia.
   Besharati claimed that Bush recently sent ``several letters'' to
Iranian leaders.
   Some of these messages, he told the daily, were ``addressed to
the Islamic Republic of Iran.'' Others, he added, were received
through the Swiss Embassy, which handles U.S. interests in Iran, and
a few through countries trying to mediate an end to the feud.
   In Kennebunkport, Maine, White House spokesman Roman Popadiuk
denied the reports, saying: ``There has been no message sent by the
president to the Iranian leadership.''
   Fanatical Shiite Moslem groups financed and supported by Iran are
believed to be holding the 16 Western hostages, including eight
Americans.
   The Iranian news agency quoted Besharati as saying ``Iran never
replied to the United States in writing,'' but that ``verbal
messages definitely were given through messengers.''
   The agency quoted him as saying the Iranian leadership feels the
Bush adminstration has realized the ``mistakes'' made by former
President Reagan's adminstration.
   ``We see the Bush adminstration has tried to undo many things of
the past,'' he added.
   The agency quoted him as adding that as ``a sign of goodwill, the
United States should denounce interference in Iranian affairs by
previous adminstrations and release the Iranian assets with no
conditions attached.
   ``If the United States stops hostility toward Iran, that will
have an impact on the entire Moslem world,'' Besharati added.
   Asked if that would help secure the release of Western hostages
in Lebanon, he said: ``Yes, I believe that the hostage issue will
also be solved and all the hostages may be released.''
   The hostages are eight Americans, four Britons, an Italian, an
Irishman and two West Germans. The longest held is American Terry
Anderson, 41, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.

   An elephant with a habit of breaking
his cages and wearing out his welcome at a series of zoos has moved
into a home for the unwanted.
   Sonny is settling in at the Popcorn Park Zoo, 35 miles north of
Atlantic City, zoo director John Bergmann said Sunday. The three-ton
African elephant arrived Friday after a four-day cross-country trip
by truck.
   ``He investigated everything the first night he was here, testing
everything and seeing if he could push it down,'' Bergmann said.
``After he realized what he was in, we haven't had any problem.''
   The $300,000 stall is a 160-foot-square paddock with a pool and a
concrete column with a chain to attach toys like tree trunks or
empty beer kegs.
   The 11-year-old elephant's former owner, the Hillcrest Park Zoo
in Clovis, N.M., gave him up because he was too big and unruly. He
kept pulling his cage apart and once knocked down an electrified
wire designed to prevent his escape.
   Sonny has been passed from zoo to zoo, Bergmann said. The
elephant also has an unattractive scar on his trunk from his days in
the wild.
   ``He's not mean and nasty by any means,'' Bergmann said. ``He
just hasn't been trained to be handled and be taken care of.''
   The zoo, run by the Associated Humane Societies, takes in wild
and domestic animals that can't survive on their own or whose owners
no longer want them. Its residents include a tiger, two lions, four
black bears, a cougar and a hyena.

<HEAD>First Cuban Representative May Not Fit in With Other Hispanics</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN SEWELL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ileana Ros-Lehtinen heads to Washington this week to
become the first Cuban-American in Congress, the latest
demonstration of the exile community's growing political power.
   But some doubt whether the conservative and fiercely
anti-communist Republican will fit in with the other Hispanic
members of Congress _ mostly liberal Democrats _ in building
influence for the nation's 20 million-plus Hispanic-Americans.
   ``The Hispanic caucus is social issues-oriented and I think
she'll have difficulty with her views,'' said Alfredo Duran, a
Cuban-born lawyer and former state Democratic chairman.
   Ms. Ros-Lehtinen, 37, was elected a week ago to the House seat
held for 27 years by Democrat Claude Pepper before his death May 30.
She was elected almost solely on Hispanic, mostly Cuban-American,
votes after a campaign in which she accused Democrat Gerald Richman
of bigotry for his claim that he was running for ``an American
seat.''
   Ms. Ros-Lehtinen will become the 12th member of the Hispanic
caucus, which is dominated by representatives of Mexican-American
and Puerto Rican descent. She will be the only Hispanic Republican
with a vote in Congress.
   Marguerita Roque, staff director of the Hispanic caucus, said in
Washington that the caucus has focused in recent years on such
issues as bilingual education, immigration, health care, getting
undocumented aliens counted in the federal census and minority
business development.
   She said the caucus, which also has 58 associate members who are
non-Hispanic, also has become more involved in U.S. foreign policy,
particularly in Central America.
   Cuban-Americans, leaving a communist homeland, have tended to
emphasize foreign policy and distrust of big government and taxes.
The average income and employment of the more than 1 million
Cuban-Americans are higher than that of other Hispanic minority
groups.
   ``Definitely, the Cubans are much more conservative than the rest
of the Hispanic community,'' said Duran.
   Ms. Ros-Lehtinen said during her campaign that she believes she
can explain the communist threat to other members of the Hispanic
caucus. She said her background as an educator should help as she
tries to work with Hispanics on issues of common ground.
   Some Cuban-American leaders say Ms. Ros-Lehtinen's views
represent older Cuban exile attitudes and not those of young Cubans.
   Mayor Xavier Suarez, an independent elected in 1985 as the first
Cuban-American in that job, said Ms. Ros-Lehtinen will make the Bush
administration more sensitive to Hispanic concerns and can explain
communist Cuba ``without being fanatical about it.''
   Duran said Ms. Ros-Lehtinen may help bring younger Cubans to the
Democrats.
   ``Just wait until Ileana starts casting her votes in Congress,''
Duran said.

<TEXT>
   U.S. participants in trade talks said they urged
Japan on Monday to give its consumers a better deal by increasing
imports and changing the economic structure to bring prices down.
   ``Goods are expensive, public infrastructure is inadequate and
leisure time is scarce in Japan, even though nominal income here is
the world's highest,'' an American delegate said privately. ``We
urged the government to find ways to solve these problems and solve
them quickly.''
   American negotiators said they suggested broad changes in Japan's
land use policies, retail and wholesale distribution networks,
pricing and business practices to reduce Japan's $50 billion annual
trade surplus with the United States and improve the lives of
Japanese citizens.
   A Japanese commentator said the U.S. demands were ``like asking a
healthy person to become sick,'' but the U.S. official said: ``Steps
we suggested would be supported by increasing purchasing power for
consumers and lowering prices. We discussed a variety of ways
Japanese consumers would benefit.''
   He said Americans raised the issues of tax and zoning rules that
tend to limit land available in urban areas for residential housing
and urged the Japanese government to spend more on roads, airports,
sewers and public parks.
   In nine hours of talks Monday, the American side also argued for
changes in Japanese business practices that discriminate against
outsiders and keep prices high.
   Another U.S. official said ``keiretsu'' _ tight-knit business
networks _ and exclusive business practices prevent newcomers from
penetrating the market.
   ```Dango,' or collusion, and group boycotts are illegal but seem
to occur nonetheless,'' he said, on condition of anonymity. ``Other
practices such as `buy Japanese' procurement policies ... are not
illegal, but do make entry into the Japanese market difficult.''
   On the agenda for Tuesday are Japanese recommendations for
structural reform of the U.S. economy. Japan's delegation is
expected to press for reduction of the federal budget deficit,
increased investment in factories and greater efforts to sell
American goods abroad.
   Japanese officials said they would urge the United States to
improve vocational training programs, increase the savings rate,
strengthen drug enforcement and focus on long-term investments
rather than short-term profit.
   Negotiations on Japanese tariffs and other trade restrictions
have succeeded in reducing such barriers, but Japanese surpluses
with the United States and other industrialized countries remain
high.
   In this round of U.S.-Japanese trade talks, expected to last a
year, delegates are focusing on the need for changes in the way each
does business, educates its children and structures its society.
   Both sides are expected to find ambitious structural adjustments
politically difficult to achieve.
   During his visit to Washington last week, Prime Minister Toshiki
Kaifu said such changes must be made if the trade imbalance is to be
overcome.
   Michihiko Kunihiro, deputy foreign minister, told reporters
Monday: ``The problems are broad and socially deep-rooted, so I
can't predict at this point what degree of results can be achieved
from the talks.''
   U.S. participants in Monday's talks said they expected to have an
interim statement on the negotiations next spring and a final report
on recommendations by summer.
   ``We all think it's possible to get a concrete result,'' said
Lynn Williams, deputy U.S. trade representative and one of the
delegates.

   President Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia
said Monday that unless apartheid is ended, South Africa will be
consumed by violence so great it will make the French Revolution
``look like a children's picnic.''
   Kaunda spoke at the opening of the summit of 102 non-aligned
nations in Belgrade.
   South Africa has been gripped by a growing campaign by
anti-apartheid groups to defy segregation laws. The series of
rallies and marches, some involving violent clashes with police,
have been staged to protest the exclusion of blacks in Wednesday's
parliamentary elections.
   The Zambian leader told delegates to the non-aligned nations'
conference that ``If apartheid is not ended now, South Africa will
be enveloped by a horrendous explosion .... in which the whites who
escape will be lucky.
   ``There will be a bloodshed which will make the French
Revolution, bloody as it was, look like a children's picnic,''
Kaunda said.
   Kaunda is one of the most outspoken critics of South African
racial policies. On Aug. 28, he met with South African President
F.W. de Klerk in Zambia to discuss de Klerk's plans for ending the
black-white conflict.
   Also at Monday's meeting, PLO leader Yasser Arafat accused the
United States of refusing to respond to the Palestinian group's
peace initiatives.
   Arafat blasted the Bush administration for continuing ``to deny
our people the most elementary and important human rights, namely
the sacred right of self-determination for all peoples in the
world.''
   Despite meetings with the PLO during the last nine months, the
U.S. ``has not responded to the Palestinian peace initiative.
   ``Instead, they adopted the plan of the Israeli government to
perpetuate the Israeli control over the Palestinian land,'' the PLO
leader said.
   Arafat said Aug. 19 that the dialogue between the United States
and the Palestine Liberation Organization was deadlocked and could
fuel the 20-month-old Palestinian uprising in the Israeli-occupied
territories.
   The United States in December ended a 13-year ban on dealings
with the PLO after Arafat renounced terrorism and recognized
Israel's right to exist.
   The non-aligned movement's ninth summit is aimed at revamping the
group to recapture its waning influence in world affairs.
   The four-day summit brought together about 50 heads of state and
about a dozen prime ministers from the Middle East, Africa, Asia and
Latin America.
   Addressing the plenary session, U.N. Secretary-General Javier
Perez de Cuellar called on Third World nations to resolve their own
conflicts, saying ``The world would be a far happier place if the
collective influence of the movement were fully brought to bear on
their settlement.''

<HEAD>Sources Say Brewery Dropped Funding For T.V. Series After Boycott
Threats</HEAD>

   Stroh Brewing Co. has withdrawn $600,000 in
financing for National Audubon Society television specials after
Northwest loggers, upset with an upcoming program on the region's
ancient forests, threatened to boycott the brewery's products,
environmentalists say.
   A spokeswoman for the Detroit-based brewer said Stroh was
reviewing its underwriting of the Audubon series, but said the
review was driven by the need to cut costs rather than the loggers'
concerns and that no decision has been made.
   ``I want to stress any consideration or thought of canceling
future contributions to the Audubon Society's program productions is
completely independent from concerns related to the upcoming program
``Ancient Forests: Rage Over Trees,''' said Lacey Logan.
   However, environmental sources, who spoke on the condition they
remain anonymous, said the company had suggested to the Audubon
Society that changes be made in the program to ``make it more
favorable to the loggers'' and that the money was withdrawn when the
society refused to change the program.
   ``Logging interests in the Northwest saw an ad for the program
and they started to put a lot of pressure on Stroh,'' said one
source. ``They were prepared to launch a nationwide boycott.''
   Ms. Logan conceded that loggers had been in contact with the
brewery.
   ``We have been having discussions with logging interests
regarding the program's content,'' she said, but insisted that the
review of backing for the series had nothing to do with those talks.
   ``We have made no decisions,'' said Ms. Logan. ``All sponsorships
and community activities are under review.''
   Stroh recently announced it would cut more than one-third of its
workforce in Detroit in an effort to streamline its operation and
cut costs.
   The timber industry and environmentalists have been locked in a
bitter struggle for months over the future of logging in the
Northwest's old growth forests, which provide prime habitat for the
northern spotted owl.
   The Audubon Society is among the environmental groups that have
sought to have the owl protected as a threatened or endangered
species and logging in the ancient forests was stopped.
   Christopher Palmer, an Audubon vice president and executive
producer of the television series, would say only that Stroh had
dropped its funding. He declined to discuss any threatened loggers
boycott.
   ``Stroh has withdrawn their support,'' said Palmer. ``They said
it had nothing to do with the ancient trees film.''
   But several sources said Stroh told the Audubon Society of its
decision to drop its funding the same day the society refused to
make changes in the program.
   Palmer said he felt the program on the trees was fair and
balanced and that Stroh's decision to drop its underwriting could
put the entire series in jeopardy.
   Stroh has provided about half the money for the series, with
Turner Broadcasting System providing the balance.
   The show on the ancient forests is scheduled to air on cable
television on Sept. 24 and on public television later.
   Actor Paul Newman is host and moderator for the hour-long show.
   The Audubon Society has been producing four shows a year for the
past five years.

   ABC's ``Chicken Soup,'' starring comic Jackie
Mason and Lynn Redgrave, is the most likely hit of the new TV
season, says TV Guide.
   The magazine's editors also said they like CBS' ``The Famous
Teddy Z,'' according to the magazine's Sept. 9 edition.
   Last year, the editors selected three sitcoms as potential hits:
ABC's ``Roseanne,'' a contender this year for the No. 1 spot, and
NBC's ``Empty Nest'' and ``Dear John,'' which finished 9th and 11th
respectively in the ratings.
   TV Guide editors said that while ``the smart money'' is on
``Chicken Soup,'' scheduled behind ``Roseanne'' on Tuesdays, they
felt the show was ``OK comedy, but it didn't bowl us over.''
   As for their personal favorite, the editors described ``Teddy Z''
as a ``fresh comedy about a kid from the mailroom who becomes,
overnight, a top Hollywood talent agent. Unlikely as that may seem,
rumor has it it's based on a real-life story.''

   Ozzy Osbourne, whose rock act
once included biting off the head of a live bat, was charged Monday
with threatening to kill his wife.
   The solo artist and former lead singer with the group Black
Sabbath was arrested at his home north of London on Saturday, police
said.
   A judge granted bail but ordered Osbourne to stay away from his
wife, Sharon, and to return to court on Sept. 25. He was not
required to enter a plea.
   Osbourne, 40, and his 37-year-old wife have three children.
Osbourne returned home last month after a concert tour in Japan.

   Former President Nixon has postponed a visit to
China because of the political unrest there.
   Nixon, who made a historic visit to China in 1972, was to have
traveled to China this month along with former Treasury Secretary
William E. Simon, Pacific Business News reported Monday. Nixon was
invited by the government of China and the purpose of the trip was
personal, Nixon spokesman John Taylor said.
   Roy Doumani, Simon's business partner, said the trip has been
delayed until after the first of the year, Pacific Business News
reported.
   Simon leads an investment group that is interested in buying an
interest in Xiamen International Bank, the only joint-venture bank
incorporated in China.

   Former Swedish tennis star Bjorn Borg married
Italian pop singer Loredana Berte on Monday at City Hall.
   The ceremony was preceded by a brawl between the couple's private
security guards and reporters and photographers who were barred from
the ceremony.
   The ceremony was performed by Milan's Socialist mayor, Paolo
Pillitteri. His assistant, Gilberto LoMaglio, said the ceremony was
followed by a brief party.
   Borg, 32, a five-time Wimbledon champion, had been living with
the 38-year-old singer here since last year.
   Borg, who retired from professional tennis several years ago
while still ranked among the top players in the world, was
hospitalized last February and his stomach was pumped after what was
reported as a possible suicide attempt.
   He denied trying to kill himself.
   Borg was married previously to tennis player Mariana Simionescu.
After divorcing her, he had a child by long-time companion Janike
Bjorling.

   The Treasury Department has new evidence that a
large number of Americans living abroad cheat on their taxes _ and a
new way to track the culprits.
   If a sample studied by Bryan L. Musselman of the Internal Revenue
Service is correct, hundreds of thousands of Americans living in
other countries are not filing the tax returns that the law requires.
   Musselman did not estimate the loss to the Treasury but in 1986
the General Accounting Office, which makes audits for Congress,
estimated it at $620 million to $2 billion a year.
   The GAO said billions more are lost because Americans at home
make money in other countries and fail to report it.
   Earned income up to $70,000 a year is exempt from U.S. income tax
for U.S. citizens living abroad, but they are still supposed to file
returns and pay taxes on earned income above that level and on any
unearned income such as interest.
   Musselman's report appears in this month's Treasury Department
volume ``1989 Update,'' an analysis of statistics and trends.
   In 1988, Musselman began getting data from the State Department
under a new law on American citizens who apply for new passports
from U.S. consulates in other countries. There were 73,000 in the
first year of operations. He assumed that these are Americans who
live for a considerable time outside the United States. American
adults who go abroad need new passports every 10 years; those under
18 need one every five years.
   Revenue officials are matching the names from the State
Department against their master file to see who is filing tax
returns and who is not.
   ``No accurate data exist for the number of Americans who live
abroad and are not employed by the U.S. government,'' Musselman
wrote.
   He estimated that 3 million Americans were living abroad last
year, including about 750,000 in the armed services. For 1986, the
Internal Revenue Service got 264,000 returns from addresses in other
countries. If it had received returns from abroad in the same
proportion as in the United States, there would have been about 1.2
million.
   ``It's a bleak picture so far as tax collection is concerned,''
Musselman said in an interview.
   Many business people say it puts the United States at a
disadvantage to collect taxes from its citizens abroad. They say it
encourages American companies in other countries to hire
non-Americans.
   ``I don't know of a single major industrial country _ Europe or
Japan _ that taxes the earnings of its citizens when they reside
abroad,'' said Bruce Reynolds, a tax partner with the international
accounting firm Touche Ross and Co.
   The United States requires all but the poorest citizens to report
their incomes, wherever they live. An unmarried person must report
anything over $5,100 a year.
   If the income is earned, Americans overseas only have to pay
taxes when a salary amounts to more than $70,000. The military, like
other U.S. government employees, are not entitled to the exemption.
   Unearned income such as payments from stocks, bonds, real estate
or other investments is all taxable, whether Americans get it in the
United States or other countries, though taxes paid to other
countries can be deducted from American tax bills. Musselman said
some of his figures give reason to think that a lot of the
unreported income is unearned.
   Musselman studied a sample of 615 names he got from the State
Department and compared those with tax returns.
   ``We can be 95 percent certain that the actual non-filing rate is
between 51.5 percent to 66.7 percent,'' he said.
   That would mean that one in every two or three Americans living
abroad did not send in returns. He pointed out that this comes close
to a figure from the General Accounting Office _ that 61 percent are
non-filers.

   A power plant on Indian land that supplies
electricity to three states is accused of casting a haze over the
Grand Canyon, but officials say there's little chance the plant will
be forced to close.
   Plant officials say the coal-fired plant produces power so
cheaply in comparison to oil-fired plants that there's no question
of shutting down, even if they have to install hundreds of millions
of dollars in new equipment.
   And while disputing how much the Navajo Generating Station really
affects the Grand Canyon, plant officials and nearby residents are
looking at the bright side, saying cleanup efforts are sure to bring
more jobs.
   It's the only major Southwestern power plant without scrubbers in
its smokestacks to remove pollution.
   ``We are part of the problem, but we are not the major part of
the problem,'' said Tom Hull, a control room operator. ``My parents
are involved in tourism. I don't want the Grand Canyon to be hazy.''
   The 2,250-megawatt plant, one of the largest in the country, was
built in the early 1970s on Navajo reservation land just outside
town and uses coal mined on Navajo land. The plant is 80 miles from
the center of the Grand Canyon.
   The project is owned by a group that includes the federal Bureau
of Reclamation and public and private utilities in Arizona,
California and Nevada. It is managed by the Salt River Project, a
state-federal agency.
   The owners pay to lease the Navajo land, and also pay the tribe
for the coal.
   Last week, the Environmental Protection Agency said there was
``substantial evidence'' that sulfur dioxide emissions from the
plant were reducing visibility at the Grand Canyon.
   Bob Yunke, a lawyer for the Environmental Defense Fund, said
programs under way to reduce smog in Los Angeles and control the
copper smelters in the region leave the Page plant as ``the single
major contributor to the problem.''
   Cleaning up the emissions will translate to ``approximately the
cost of a candy bar per month'' to the average customer, he added.
   The plant can generate electricity for at least $600,000 less a
day than it would cost to buy replacement power elsewhere, said
Charles Bruback, the plant's acting manager. That means even the
most expensive pollution controls _ estimates range up to $1 billion
_ would be cheaper in the long run than scrapping the plant.
   ``I would be amazed if there could be any kind of control
required of us that would make this not a viable alternative,'' he
said.
   The operation saves money because coal is cheaper than oil and
because the coal is mined so close by that it saves transportation
costs.
   ``We'll be here operating this plant as long as it has economic
life in it,'' Bruback said. ``In fact, there probably will be more
jobs because of this.''
   That's good news for the 7,190 residents of Page, built
overlooking Lake Powell on the Utah-Arizona line.
   While the population has dropped since the plant was completed,
the project is still the economic mainstay of the town. Its annual
payroll of $40 million includes more than 750 permanent employees
and up to 1,000 seasonal workers.
   ``We live and die by that plant,'' says Will Hannemann, a real
estate broker and seasonal plant worker.
   The plant also means income for the Navajos, but lease and other
payments go directly to the tribal government in Window Rock, 300
miles away. Critics complain that little of it comes back to the
Navajos living near here.
   ``There are people living a mile outside the generating station
that have no running water or electricity,' says Denis Tsosie, head
of the tribe's local government agency.
   Still, Indians derive some jobs from the plant, because its lease
gives hiring preference to Navajos. Bruback said Indians make up
about 48 percent of the permanent work force.

<HEAD>President Back in Washington, Suited Up For Business</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush, refreshed by nearly three weeks
in the summer hideaway he calls his ``heaven,'' returned to
Washington on Monday after proclaiming himself eager to get back to
work.
   As if to underscore that sentiment, the president left Maine
dressed casually and emerged from Air Force One at Andrews Air Force
Base barely an hour later dressed in a business suit for the final
helicopter hop to the White House.
   Bush, who broke a jinx by reeling in a bluefish Sunday, caught
two more fish in a final outing aboard his speedboat Fidelity before
he and wife Barbara boarded the Marine One helicopter at their
Walker's Point retreat to begin the journey homeward.
   Meanwhile, a White House spokesman, Roman Popadiuk, denied a
report in the Tehran Times that Bush had written personal letters to
the new leaders of Iran. ``There has been no message sent by the
president to the Iranian leadership,'' he said.
   The United States last sent a message to the government of Iran
through third parties six weeks ago, Popadiuk said. The United
States has used the Swiss embassy and other channels to communicate
with Iran in the past.
   The president's first task back at the White House was to finish
work on the nationally televised address he will deliver from the
Oval Office Tuesday night unveiling his anti-drug strategy.
   Bush, who spent 20 days in Maine at his sprawling home
overlooking the Atlantic, appeared eager to get ``back to work,'' as
he put it Sunday in an impromptu talk at services at St. Ann's
Episcopal Church.
   He told his fellow parishioners that part of his anti-drug
strategy will involve asking Americans to ``involve yourselves in
the lives of others'' and to strengthen the bonds of community life.
   The $7.8 billion anti-narcotics plan, crafted by drug policy czar
William Bennett, is expected to stiffen penalties for individual
users, expand treatment for addicts and boost aid to the Andean
countries and others to help eradicate drugs at the source.
   In launching this war against drugs, Bush is seeking to make good
on the pledge in his inaugural address that ``this scourge will
stop.''
   Bush filled his days here with jogging, golfing, boating,
horseshoes and other activities, and read David Halberstam's ``The
Summer of '49,'' a lengthy book about a classic pennant race between
the New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox.
   He also squeezed in a modicum of business, dispatching $65
million in military aid to Colombia for its war against the drug
barons; hosting visits from Danish Prime Minister Poul Schlueter and
Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and their families; and
huddling with Bennett and top Cabinet officials on the drug
battleplan.
   He also found time last Wednesday to accept the 1989 Outstanding
Citizen Award from the Kennebunkport Chamber of Commerce _ the
choice was unanimous _ where he told the local boosters, ``It's been
a joy to be here.''
   ``This is a place where we really enjoy ourselves, but more than
that kind of refurbish our souls and get our batteries all charged
up and enjoy life really to the fullest,'' said Bush.
   It was actually Bush's second stay of the summer at the spot he
calls ``this heaven'' and where he has come every summer of his life
except one when he was off fighting in the Pacific.
   He is expected back again once or twice during a busy fall that
will also see him holding an education summit with governors Sept.
27-28 in Charlottesville, Va., and journeying the following month to
a Latin summit in Costa Rica.
   He has trips to at least seven states coming up in the next three
weeks, including a speech at the United Nations on Sept. 24, even
while he struggles with Congress to reach an accord on the deficit
and taxes and to unclog a backlog of nominees awaiting confirmation.

   Summer vacation is over for President Bush, who
returned to Washington today to launch a fall calendar packed with
domestic and foreign issues.
   The president came back to the capital from his vacation home in
Maine after an 11th-hour triumph at what became a consuming goal of
his three-week trip _ catching a fish.
   ``The jinx is broken!'' he called jubilantly to reporters as he
came ashore Sunday holding aloft a two-foot-long bluefish.
   Even as he fulfilled his vow to catch one before his return, the
president's mind was clearly turning back to the White House and the
first major item on his schedule _ a Tuesday night address to the
nation revealing his national drug policy strategy.
   ``Tomorrow it starts all over again. I don't know what you guys
have to do, but I know what I've got to do: head back to work,''
Bush told parishioners at St. Ann's Episcopal Church where the
pastor invited him to take the pulpit.
   He said he needed to ``start studying hard'' for the drug speech,
the first presidential address he will deliver for broadcast on
national television.
   ``It's the first speech I'll give from the Oval Office. I'm not
going to be scared,'' he said, recounting how as a young child he
would shake when called upon to recite a verse at St. Ann's.
   He said he will ask the nation to become involved in community
service to help fight the drug problem.
   In addition to the $7.8 billion anti-drug plan, Bush is gearing
up for rough sledding in Congress on how to reduce the federal
deficit and other budget and taxation issues.
   He has a full travel schedule, including an education summit for
the nation's governors Sept. 27-28 in Charlottesville, Va., a trip
to Costa Rica for a hemispheric meeting in October, and short jaunts
to New Jersey, Maryland and then New York for an address to the
United Nations on Sept. 24.
   He also is expected to make a swing west to Montana, South Dakota
and Washington state this month.
   U.S.-Soviet relations also are on the agenda, with Secretary of
State James A. Baker III set to meet with Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard Shevardnadze in Wyoming. It is anticipated they could set a
date for a summit meeting between Bush and Soviet Leader Mikhail
Gorbachev.
   Also looming is what to do about continued problems in Nicaragua
and Panama.
   Reporters asked the president if he would be sad to leave the
seaside resort where he has spent all but one wartime summer of his
life.
   ``Yeah, but I'm ready to go back,'' he replied. ``I'm ready to go
to work.''
   The ``icing on the cake'' for a recreation-filled vacation was
that he finally caught the bluefish, he said.
   His press aides summoned reporters and photographers dockside for
his triumphant return to his Walker's Point home.
   Bush's inability to reel in a fish, despite daily outings since
his Aug. 16 arrival, had become a media fixation. First lady Barbara
Bush, son Marvin, and national security adviser Brent Scowcroft were
aboard for the successful outing.
   Bush brandished the fish aloft as he motored his speedboat to
shore. He invited the press corps to stick around as he cleaned the
fish and hacked its head off, saving it ``for soup.''
   ``A tremendous fish ... a very strong fish,'' he said, estimating
its weight at ``nine or 10 pounds.''
   He replied with an emphatic ``No'' when a reporter, voicing an
ongoing vacation joke, asked if there was truth to the rumor that
Navy divers were below the boat helping the fish get on Bush's hook.
   Later, Bush pronounced a ``great ending'' to his vacation when he
and golf pro Ken Raynor beat Scowcroft and friend Spike Heminway on
the links.
   Bush also beat Heminway in three sets of doubles tennis earlier,
according to Heminway, who said the president was ``on a roll''
Sunday.

   President Bush, back at the White House after a
three-week vacation, put the finishing touches Monday on a major
speech on fighting drugs by attacking both supply and demand.
   The Oval Office address Tuesday evening will be Bush's first
formal nationally televised address since becoming president. He is
expected to outline a $7.8 billion program of stiffer penalties for
narcotics users, more treatment for addicts and more aid to Latin
American nations to help them cut supplies.
   All three commercial networks and CNN plan to broadcast the
speech at 9 p.m. EDT.
   Before leaving his summer vacation home in Kennebunkport, Maine,
the president told fellow parishioners Sunday at church that his
anti-drug message to Americans will be a call to ``involve
yourselves in the lives of others.''
   Bush is seeking to redeem a campaign pledge that he stressed in
his inaugural address when he said of the burgeoning drug problem,
``Take my word for it, this scourge will end.''
   The administration also has not ruled out sending U.S. troops to
Colombia, a chief source of cocaine, to bolster the battle against
drug traffickers.
   White House Chief of Staff John Sununu said the military could be
ordered to take an active role in the war against drugs if Colombia
asks for it.
   ``It's a decision that the president would have to make'' if the
Latin American nation requests troops, Sununu said.
   On Sunday, $65 million worth of U.S. military equipment and other
aid, accompanied by up to 100 American military trainers, began
arriving in Colombia.
   Some Democrats are expressing skepticism about Bush's commitment
to the war on drugs.
   ``The single most important thing the president must do when he
announces his plan, whatever the cost ... is to tell us how we are
going to pay for it and commit that we will pay for it,'' said Sen.
Joseph R. Biden Jr., D-Del., chairman of the Senate Judiciary
Committee.
   Democrats may offer legislation to rival the president's version
depending on the administration's proposals, Biden added.
   That could include debt relief for Latin American nations to
subsidize withdrawal of farm land from producing coca crops that are
refined to produce cocaine.
   Democratic Mayor Tom Bradley of Los Angeles said over the weekend
that the size of the program Bush is expected to endorse is
inadequate.
   ``I think that $8 billion is simply not going to do it,'' he
said. Bradley also said he fears the money will come from cutting
back other domestic programs vital to the cities, such as housing.
   William J. Bennett, the nation's new drug czar who played in key
role in devising the administration's battle plan, has said law
enforcement must go after the casual drug user as well as the drug
cartels.
   The idea is to increase ``the sanction for drug use at every link
in the chain,'' he said.
   Some of the details of the Bush drug package already have been
revealed.
   Administration sources said the plan will include sending some
$260 million in economic and military aid to the three main cocaine
producers, Colombia, Bolivia and Peru. The final figure could go
higher, they said.
   The package also likely will include some $925 million for drug
treatment, $1.2 billion for new prisons and $350 million to help
state and local law enforcement.
   The administration's crackdown on drug users also includes
authority for judges to strip student loans and other federal
benefits from drug offenders.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iran boycotted a 108-nation conference of lawmakers
Monday to protest British author Salman Rushdie's novel, ``The
Satanic Verses.'' Police were investigating a bomb blast linked to
the campaign against Rushdie.
   Iran sent a message last week saying its delegation would stay
away from the conference and charging that the ``British government
under the pretext of freedom of speech'' had supported Rushdie and
encouraged publication of the book, said Inter-Parliamentary Union
spokesman Richard Faulkner.
   The Inter-Parliamentary Union meeting, which opened Monday,
prides itself on providing a forum for contacts between legislators,
often from hostile countries. Boycotts of its annual meetings are
rare.
   Iran and Britain cut diplomatic ties after Iran's Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini on Feb. 14 called on Moslems to kill Rushdie
because of the book, considered blasphemous by many Moslems.
   Since Khomeini's death June 3, Iranian authorities have stood by
the death threat. Rushdie, an Indian-born Moslem, remains in hiding
under British police guard.
   On Sunday night, a bomb exploded outside a London department
store after an anonymous caller telephoned a warning to police and
mentioned Rushdie's novel. A passer-by was injured in the blast.
   The Liberty department store, in central London's bus shopping
district, was closed at the time of the blast. It reopened for
business as usual at 9:32 a.m. Monday, only two minutes late. No
damage was caused to the store's interior and only a small scorch
was visible on the exterior.
   Until recently, the department stored housed a Penguin bookstore
concession. ``The Satanic Verses'' was published last year under the
Viking imprint, which is part of the Penguin group.
   Queen Elizabeth II on Monday opened the 100th anniversary meeting
of the Inter-Parliamentary Union before 1,400 delegates who included
members of the U.S. Congress, Soviet deputies, Israelis and Arabs.
The conference was held in the 11th-century Westminster Hall, part
of the British Houses of Parliament.
   This week's meeting was due to discuss the Third World debt and
the peaceful use of space.

   Bivalves flew like rockets at the 46th
annual clamshell pitching contest.
   The contest, loosely modeled on horseshoe-pitching competitions,
drew nearly 100 entrants Sunday.
   Dolores Houston of Levittown, Pa., won the women's singles
championship, and Art Naclerio of New York City won the men's
singles title for the third time by defeating 71-year-old Tom Spear,
the 1988 titleholder.
   ``We're just a band of folks who like to pitch shells. The best
part about the game is that anybody can play it,'' said Rich
Reinhart, president of the International Clamshell Pitching Club of
Cape May.
   Competitors toss the shells, about 4 inches in diamater, at holes
in the sand. Getting one in the hole means two points, being nearest
to the hole means a point.
   In a twist on horseshoes _ which, after all, don't break very
easily _ participants must throw broken shells until they are less
than two-thirds of their initial size.
   So what does a first-rate clamshell pitcher win?
   ``The city donates trophies and of course there's a lot of fame
and glory and bragging rights,'' Reinhart said.

<TEXT>
   Soviet space officials made preparations Monday for
the launch of two cosmonauts on a six-month mission to reopen the
Mir space station, which was left unmanned while the country saved
money and designed new equipment.
   Flight commander Alexander Viktorenko, 43, and 45-year-old
engineer Alexander Serebrov are scheduled to be launched from the
Baikonur space center early Wednesday morning aboard the Soyuz TM-8
craft.
   They are to dock with the Mir space station Sept. 8, the Tass
news agency said.
   On their six-month mission, the two cosmonauts are to try out a
new Soviet ``space bicycle'' to carry out work outside the orbiting
complex, and fit Mir with a docking port for the Buran space shuttle.
   As soon as Viktorenko and Serebrov are launched, preparations
will begin to send a seven-ton payload, mostly of research
equipment, to the space station, Tass said.
   Mir was launched in February 1986 and was designed to be
permanently manned, but the last crew left on April 27.
   Officials say they have left it unmanned for several months to
save money and because new modules were not ready for launch.

   King Fahd of Saudi Arabia has postponed a state
visit to the United States for a second time, White House spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater said Monday.
   The Saudi monarch is putting off the scheduled Sept. 14 visit
``due to the pursuit of the peace process (in Lebanon) through the
Arab League,'' Fitzwater told reporters aboard Air Force One as
President Bush returned from vacation in Maine.
   That was the same reason given for the last delay in July. Saudi
officials denied reports then that Fahd was ill.
   Fahd has joined other Arab leaders in efforts to negotiate a
peace among the warring factions in Lebanon. So far, the Arab
League's efforts have been unavailing.
   Fitzwater said the visit will be rescheduled at a ``mutually
convenient date.''

<HEAD>Bush Drug Plan Has Credibility Hurdle to Clear</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush's new blueprint for fighting
drugs faces a credibility problem in Congress unless the
administration specifies where it plans to get the $7.8 billion he's
calling for to wage the war, says a Senate committee chairman.
   Appropriations skirmishes earlier this year over paying for
current antidrug efforts already have some lawmakers expressing
skepticism even before Bush unveils his new initiative Tuesday night.
   ``The single most important thing the president must do when he
announces his plan, whatever the cost ... is to tell us how we're
are going to pay for it and commit that we will pay for it,'' said
Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr., D-Del., chairman of the Senate Judiciary
Committee.
   The biggest issues immediately facing Congress upon its return
Tuesday from a month-long vacation are a bill in the Senate
mandating that new services by provided to the disabled and
prohibiting discrimination against them and a measure in the House
to upgrade trade relations with Hungary.
   And the alleged sexual peccadilloes of four congressmen _ Reps.
Barney Frank, D-Mass.; Gus Savage, D-Ill.; Donald E. ``Buz'' Lukens,
R-Ohio, and Jim Bates, D-Calif. _ will be examined by the House
Ethics Committee.
   The overriding topic, however, will be Bush's proposed new
strategy to dam the flow of tens of billions of dollars worth of
cocaine into the United States annually and curb the appetite of
estimated 24 million Americans for it and other illegal drugs.
   Biden, who will wield considerable power over the proposal Bush
sends to Congress, has repeatedly complained that many provisions of
an anti-drug bill approved last year turned hollow from a lack of
funds.
   ``It meant hundreds of FBI agents and hundreds of DEA agents and
hundreds of treatment programs, all of which were promised to local
communities and the American people, never got into place after all
the folderol,'' he said.
   This time, he says, the money must be earmarked.
   ``It cannot be the blue smoke and mirrors of saying we are going
to reprogram,'' Biden said. ``If you're going to reprogram, tell us
precisely ... where is the money specifically going to come from.''
   White House Chief of Staff John Sununu has said the $7.8 billion
in new anti-drug initiatives that Bush will advocated will be
scraped together through cuts in other programs.
   Administration officials, however, have offered no specifics. And
one officials, speaking anonymously, had said the administration
hopes to keep secret about 30 percent of the new program.
   Biden said Democrats may decide to draft their own alternative if
they don't like Bush's proposal.
   Meanwhile, both the House and Senate have a light week of floor
action facing them..
   In the Senate, lawmakers on Thursday take up a bill to provide
disabled individuals with the same rights accorded under the Civil
Rights Act of 1964 to racial, religious and ethnic minorities.
   The measure, which has bipartisan support, also requires
wheelchair access to new and modified buildings, public
transportation vehicles and terminals and mandates wider use of
telecommunications equipment for the hearing impaired.
   A day earlier, the Senate will take up a $2 billion bill for
paying the cost of running Congress for the next fiscal year
beginning Oct. 1. The House already has approved a $1.6 billion
version.
   Legislation to extend ``most favored nation'' trading status to
Hungary comes before the House on Thursday. The bill would
effectively reduce tariffs and other barriers against imports from
Hungary.
   The House then plans to act on proposed changes in laws governing
how commodity futures are traded in the aftermath of trading
scandals at the Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange.
   Among other things, the bill would prohibit approval of new
futures contracts by the federal Commodity Futures Trading
Commission if the trading pits fail to meet new auditing standards
requiring a detailed trail of transactions.

<HEAD>Jail Inmate Wins $1,000 In McDonald's Contest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CONWAY, Ark. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Meals for prisoners in the city jail come
from McDonald's, but that's just fine for inmate Charles E. Wilson _
he won $1,000 in a promotion run by the fast-food chain.
   ``I've never won anything,'' Wilson said Monday.
   Wilson, 33, of Brooksville, Fla., is apparently the biggest local
winner in the national McDonald's instant winner promotion, in which
game pieces are peeled from soft drink cups, said Bob Kennedy,
assistant manager of the Conway store.
   Wilson's chances of winning were 476,000-to-1, Kennedy said,
adding that the restaurant sells about 1,000 drinks a day, each
bearing a game piece.
   City officials said Wilson is apparently the only prisoner in the
jail to ever win a fast-food promotion.
   Wilson was arrested Thursday and is awaiting extradition to
Carthage, Mo., to face a charge of possession of a controlled
substance that was filed in February, a spokesman for the Jasper
County, Mo., Sheriff's Department said Monday. The extradition,
which Wilson is not fighting, should be complete in a few days,
officers said.
   On Sunday night, Wilson said he finished his meal and noticed the
game piece on his soft-drink cup.
   ``I wasn't paying any attention. I thought I might as well pull
it off, it was something to do,'' Wilson said. ``I thought maybe I'd
win a hamburger and they'd pick me up an extra one.''
   However, ``I pulled it off and said, `Do what?'
   ``I had to look at it a bunch of times. I kept thinking instant
winner, it's got to be $1,000,'' he said. ``It's pretty good to be
sitting in jail and win $1,000.''
   Wilson asked Patrolman Lynn Carter to look at the game piece.
``It said bigger than life: `instant winner of $1,000,''' the
patrolman said.
   The prisoner ``had a real big grin on his face,'' Carter said.
``He was just short of jumping up and down.''
   ``As far as I'm concerned, it's his. He pulled it off the cup,''
Carter said. ``I'm quite sure there will be no controversy over
who'll get it.
   ``He's in jail but you're still happy for him.''
   Carter said a restaurant spokesman told him forms would have to
be sent in to verify the win and allow Wilson to claim the prize
money.
   ``We told him if we had to we'd handcuff him and take him up
there,'' Carter said. ``Needless to say, he's real excited and
McDonald's is too.''
   Kennedy said it might take up to eight weeks to process the prize
claim.
   ``Too bad I won't get it in time for my lawyer,'' Wilson said.

   About 400 animal rights activists marched,
chanted and screamed Monday at competitors who fired shotguns at
pigeons released from cages in an annual Labor Day shoot described
by protesters as a ``bloodbath.''
   Police arrested one protester on a charge of disorderly conduct
while demonstrators from as far away as Illinois and Florida tried
to stop the 55th Fred Coleman Memorial Shoot.
   ``It's just a pure bloodsquirt and a real slaughter,'' said Bob
Witkowski, of Wilkes-Barre.
   Birds were released one at a time from cages about 20 yards in
front of the estimated 200 shooters, who paid as much as $475 to
participate. Some 6,000 pigeons were caged for the community
fund-raising event.
   Only Pennsylvania, Mississippi, Kansas and Texas permit such
events.
   After a group of birds was shot, a group of ``trapper boys'' ran
onto the field to retrieve them. Many birds were only wounded and
fluttered on the ground until the children came out and pulled their
heads off or wrung their necks with their gloved hands.
   Community members attending said the event is a place for family
fellowship.
   ``These protesters have their priorities mixed up,'' said Joe
Coulter. ``These people are burning flags and are in line for
abortions. It's just un-American.''
   George Cave, president of Trans-Species Unlimited of
Williamsport, said the shoot is a ``dawn-to-dusk bloodbath.'' He
said he hoped legislation pending in the state House would lead to a
ban on such events.
   But participants were just as determined to protect the shoot.
   ``You have to be a sportsman to understand,'' said Keith
Wolfgang, who has attended the event for 12 years.
   James McKnight, past president of the Pennsylvania Federation of
Sportsmen's Clubs Inc., said the shoot is a Pennsylvania tradition
and should remain intact.
   The all-day event was expected to raise about $12,000 for the
Hegins community, according to Bob Tobash, an organizer. Shooters
paid from $70 to $425 to participate, depending on options including
number of birds. He estimated as many as 200 shooters participated.

<TEXT>
   Officials and witnesses reported Monday
that 50 more people had been killed in Sri Lanka's ethnic violence,
including 38 men whose bodies were found in waterways and on roads.
   Military officials blamed most of the deaths reported in the
previous 24 hours on Sinhalese radicals of the People's Liberation
Front, an anti-government nationalist guerrilla group.
   Officials, who cannot be identified under briefing rules, said
soldiers and civilians found 38 bodies of men in central and
southern Sri Lanka, the Sinhalese heartland, in rivers, lakes and
canals and along roads. They gave no details.
   Residents said they found four naked bodies of men, tied
together, floating Monday in the Kelani River on Colombo's northern
outskirts. Police said the bodies were of Sinhalese militants.
   Independent sources said many of the 50 reported killed may have
been Sinahalese militants slain by the military or pro-government
vigilante groups.
   Radical Sinhalese had called a one-week strike that ended Sunday
night.
   In central Sri Lanka on Sunday night, men thought to be members
of the People's Liberation Front stormed a military camp and two
police stations, but were repulsed, officials reported. They said
four of the attackers were killed and one was captured.
   Two unidentified gunmen killed a Sinhalese man Sunday in central
Sri Lanka and three civilians were killed by militants Monday, the
officials said, without giving details.
   According to government figures, more than 5,000 people have been
killed in the violent campaign begun by Sinhalese radicals two years
ago to protest government peace overtures to Tamil secessionists in
northern and eastern Sri Lanka.
   Sinhalese militants also object to the presence of Indian
peacekeeping soldiers deployed to enforce a 1987 peace accord
designed to end the Tamil war for a separate homeland, which has
taken at least 11,000 lives in six years. The dead include 1,000
Indian soldiers.
   Tamils, most of whom are Hindus, make up 18 percent of Sri
Lanka's 16 million people and claim discrimination in jobs and
education by the majority Sinhalese. The Sinhalese, a predominantly
Buddhist ethnic group, make up 75 percent of the population and
control the government and the military.
   India became involved because it is the regional power and has
its own Tamil population of 60 million, most of whom live in
southern Tamil Nadu state, across the Palk Strait from Sri Lanka.

<HEAD>Quake Hits Off Alaska; Seismic Sea Wave Fails to Materialize</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Thousands of people on Kodiak Island and
the Alaska Peninsula fled to high ground Monday after a strong
earthquake offshore prompted a tsunami warning, but only a small sea
wave materialized.
   The quake registering 6.9 on the Richter scale struck at 5:15
a.m. ADT (9:15 a.m. EDT), was centered about 140 miles southwest of
Kodiak Island, said the U.S. Geological Survey in Golden, Colo.
   In Chignik, the community nearest the quake's center, there were
reports that objects fell from shelves and rocks tumbled onto a
road, said seismologist George Carte of the Alaska Tsunami Warning
Center in Palmer.
   Carte had warned of a possible tsunami in Alaska and British
Columbia. More than 5,000 people were evacuated in Kodiak and nearly
a dozen smaller communities.
   But the warning was lifted within hours and the evacuees returned
to their homes.
   Carte said the Tsunami Warning Center's gauge at Sand Point, 180
miles west of the quake's epicenter, recorded a small tsunami of
less than one-half foot.
   ``I was up in my sister's house and we just woke up to shaking,''
said Sylvia Bravo, 32, a lifelong resident of Chignik. ``We have
three kids and we were all scared. Everybody was sound asleep, and
then all of a sudden, the mattress started shaking. We knew right
away it was an earthquake.''
   Bravo said residents heard the tsunami warning through
communications radios and went to high ground. She and her family
drove to a shelter furnished with food and blankets and stayed there
about two hours.
   The last damaging tsunami in Alaska happened in the great
earthquake of Good Friday 1964. Centered under a glaciated peninsula
75 miles east of Anchorage, the quake generated sea waves estimated
up to 80 feet tall that devastated Kodiak, obliterated smaller
villages along the coast and punished far-off Pacific ports.
   That quake and its tsunami killed 131 people as far south as
Hawaii. The Geological Survey said the temblor measured 8.4 on the
Richter scale, a measure of ground motion in which every increase of
one number means a tenfold increase in magnitude. An earthquake of 7
is a major quake, capable of widespread heavy damage.

<HEAD>Premier's Cabinet Nominees Expected This Week</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DANISZEWSKI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki will
announce nominees for the East bloc's first non-communist-led
Cabinet this week, the parliamentary leader of Solidarity said
Monday.
   Meanwhile, Lech Walesa objected to continued pressure by the
Communist Party for more posts in the government, and Solidarity
activists urged tough measures to halt Poland's protracted economic
problems.
   Mazowiecki has kept secret his Cabinet selections so far, but an
outline of the composition of the government could come as early as
Tuesday when Solidarity's parliamentary caucus meets.
   Deputy Bronislaw Geremek, the caucus chairman, said in an
interview Monday that Mazowiecki is close to announcing the
government and that, in a break with tradition, parliament will have
several days to examine Cabinet nominees before voting.
   ``We hope that in the next few days there will be a meeting of
the club with the premier on the makeup of the new government, and
that by the end of the week hearings on candidates ... will be held
by particular Sejm committees,'' Geremek told the PAP news agency.
   Geremek said, the Sejm, or parliament, could vote on the Cabinet
early next week. Sejm Speaker Mikolaj Kozakiewicz said he expected
the vote on Sept. 12 at the earliest.
   In Gdansk, Walesa responded negatively Monday to Communist Party
statements Saturday that the party was promised a wide role in the
next government.
   Communist First Secretary Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski and
parliamentary leader Marian Orzechowski did not go into details, but
said Mazowiecki had promised them more than two portfolios.
Orzechowski said the party would be represented in ``all basic
spheres of life.''
   The two leaders praised Mazowiecki as a ``realist'' and indicated
there was no danger the party would put itself in open opposition to
Mazowiecki's government, as had been threatened several times since
his election.
   ``I must say that I do not like it,'' Walesa told reporters in
Gdansk when asked about those statements.
   ``Poland belongs to everybody. ... If Poland is to be reformed,
then (party members) have to enter the government as reformers, and
not as party members. ...They should think about Poland and reform,
and not about the number of seats that fall to them.''
   Walesa, citing a supervisory role he was granted last month in a
resolution by the Solidarity caucus, said he would ``warn'' and
``shout in protest'' if he saw someone getting a government post
simply by right of party affiliation.
   ``In the Polish government ... there can be only reformers
regardless of what kind of party cards they have,'' he said, and no
``reserved seats.''
   Before the selection of Mazowiecki as prime minister on Aug. 24,
Solidarity promised the Communist Party that it would continue to
hold the ministries of defense and internal affairs, controlling the
army and the police.
   Party Central Committee Secretary Slawomir Wiatr, interviewed in
Bonn on Monday, said the party wanted ``parity representation'' in
the government. He said that would mean six seats for the party, six
seats for Solidarity and six seats divided between the trade union's
coalition partners, the Peasants and the Democrats.
   But Solidarity activists have hinted at a smaller role for the
Communist Party, saying that if it gets too many posts society will
not feel anything has changed.
   Meanwhile, Solidarity activists writing in the pro-Solidarity
Gazeta Wyborcza newspaper on Monday stressed the need for drastic
action to boost the faltering Polish economy.
   ``The economy is slipping out of control. We are on the verge of
hyperinflation,'' said a front-page commentary. ``This means that
the activities of Premier Mazowiecki's government must be firm, deep
and quick.''
   It urged a tight monetary policy, an end to restrictions on
private enterprise, the breakup of monopolies, sale of state
enterprises and immediate talks on rescheduling Poland's $39 billion
foreign debt.
   Solidarity Sen. Aleksander Paszynski, presented his own economic
program in the same issue, advocated an immediate halt to state
industrial investments, steep cuts in military spending,
renegotiating economic agreements with East bloc countries and
ending most government price subsidies.

   Several hundred East Germans rallied
Monday with banners demanding more democracy and freedom to travel.
Witnesses said several protesters were arrested during scuffles with
police.
   The demonstration began in front of the St. Nicholas church after
a traditional Monday ``prayer for peace.'' The church has become a
gathering place for human rights activists.
   Western reporters at the scene said the predominantly young crowd
carried banners calling for more freedom. ``Freedom to Travel
Instead of Mass Escapes,'' said one sign. Another said, ``For an
Open State with Free People.''
   A crush of East Germans have been fleeing their homeland this
summer through other East bloc countries. Many have complained about
the rigid Communist system of this country.
   About 6,000 East Germans have escaped to the West since Hungary
began removing fences from its border with Austria in May. Nearly
5,000 other East German refugees are waiting in camps in Hungary for
transfer to West Germany.
   During Monday's protest, about 300 people stood outside the
church, shouting ``We want out!''
   As the crowd tried to march toward the center of the city,
security forces blocked the way.
   Scuffles broke out as plainclothesmen tore down protest banners,
and several demonstrators were dragged away and arrested, witnesses
said.
   Later Monday, about 200 protesters left the St. Nicholas church
and marched to Leipzig's train station shouting, ``Free Ride to
Giessen!''
   One of the main refugee reception centers in West Germany is in
Giessen, near Frankfurt.
   Witnesses said security troops watched the march from side
streets but did not intervene and the crowd dispersed after reaching
the railroad station.

   Police wouldn't let Moammar Gadhafi
ride to the nonaligned summit on horseback Monday with 50 of the
young women who guard him, and a scuffle began when security tried
to keep his protectors out of the hall.
   Maj. Abdullah Senussi, chief of Khadafy's security service, was
said to have complained ``at the highest level.''
   ``We were willing to let Gadhafi ride his Arab bay from Dedinje
suburb down to the Sava center, but when he asked for 50 of his
bodyguards to follow, we had to put our foot down,'' a police source
told The Associated Press.
   Gadhafi arrived an hour late for the meeting, in his bulletproof
Cadillac rather than one of the Audis that summit organizers put at
the disposal of national leaders.
   Yugoslav security tried to let only a handful of the 50
bodyguards into the conference hall and the result was a
free-for-all. Gadhafi, apparently unaware of the melee outside,
passed through with two of the young women.
   Yugoslav security guards were not allowing any weapons into the
building and tried to disarm the two guards at the door, but
succeeded with only one.
   The other pushed her way through and sat at Gadhafi's side, still

<HEAD>Nunn Says US Will Withdraw Forces if NATO Members Reduce Troops</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sam Nunn, chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, said Monday any troop cuts by NATO allies will provoke
withdrawals of U.S. forces from Europe and undermine talks with
Moscow on conventional arms.
   In remarks to the International Institute for Strategic Studies,
the Georgia Democrat also also urged U.S. banks to open branches in
Poland to attract billions of American dollars Poles are believed to
be hoarding.
   Nunn, who often says many Americans think they pay too great a
share of the cost of defending Western Europe, said he had
``disquieting reports'' that several European NATO nations plan
large reductions in troop levels.
   He said the cuts might exceed the 30,000 soldiers the United
States would withdraw _ a 10 percent reduction _ under Washington's
proposal for reducing American and Soviet troop levels by 1993 to
275,000 each stationed on the territory of European allies.
   ``If our allies cut their forces ... then we will cut ours
proportionately,'' Nunn said, referring to a provision in the
defense authorization bill the Senate passed last month that puts a
ceiling on the U.S. proportion of NATO troops in Europe.
   ``I believe the U.S. Congress is prepared to maintain our current
share of NATO's deployed forces in Europe while we are negotiating
(with the Soviets) ... but we are not willing to increase our share
of the burden,'' he said.
   ``While we negotiate in hope of reaching East-West common
ceilings, NATO must not open holes in our own floor.''
   In Vienna, the 16-nation NATO alliance is negotiating coventional
arms reductions with the seven members of the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact.
   Nunn did not identify the NATO nations said to be planning troop
reductions.
   Commenting on Poland, he urged American banks to open branches as
soon as permitted by the new government led by Solidarity.
   ``The Poles believe these banks would immediately draw deposits
of several billion long-held U.S. dollars,'' he said. ``These are
called `sleeping dollars' because they are now kept in mattresses.
... Polish people do not have confidence in their own banks.''

   Strikers silenced factories, stores and public
transportation in Azerbaijan on Monday in a bid to regain their
republic's control of a region disputed with neighboring Armenia.
   In a separate ethnic dispute in the republic of Moldavia,
Russian-speaking workers stayed away from their jobs at about 200
factories and offices to protest a law making Moldavian the official
language.
   The strikes underscore the variety and severity of ethnic
problems facing President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and the country's
Communist leadership.
   The Communist Party Central Committee is scheduled to meet in
early September to debate a new approach to relations among the
Soviet Union's more than 100 ethnic groups.
   The evening television news devoted its first 15 minutes Monday
to reports from Moldavia, which borders Romania, and two Baltic
republics, Lithuania and Latvia.
   Popular movements in the Baltic area are pressing for more
autonomy from Moscow, and some activists there are pushing for
secession.
   Monday's walkout in Azerbaijan, a mainly Moslem republic on the
Caspian Sea, was called by the local People's Front political
movement.
   The strike committee claimed 95 percent of factories in the
capital of Baku, a city with 1.7 million residents, were shut by the
strike and that freight trains were halted throughout the republic,
said Nazim Ragimov, an independent journalist.
   He said that number included about 200 factories but he had no
figure for the number of people on strike. Ragimov was contacted by
telephone.
   Editors at the official Azerinform news agency said some
employees went to their factories and offices but many did not work.
Another editor reported the strike partly idled a major oil refining
and processing center on the Caspian coast.
   Food stores were the only shops open in Baku. Izmail Agayev, head
of the Azerbaijan Foreign Ministry's Information Department, said
some bus and streetcar drivers also walked out.
   He did not estimate how many people were on strike.
   The People's Front has made several demands, including the recall
of representatives to the national Congress of People's Deputies,
who they say were chosen in fraudulent balloting and did nothing in
the parliament's first session.
   They also demand that Azerbaijan reassert control over
Nagorno-Karabakh, a mountainous enclave. It is 75 percent ethnic
Armenian, although it lies in Azerbaijan.
   Armenia wants to annex it, and the Kremlin has put it under
direct rule to try to end the dispute.
   The dispute has killed 100 people and forced hundreds of
thousands to flee their homes.
   Krasnaya Zvezda, the Defense Ministry newspaper, said Sunday that
tensions between Armenia and Azerbaijan ``are like gunpowder,'' and
that Nagorno-Karabakh is on the verge of civil war.
   The strikes in predominantly Russia-speaking regions of Moldavia,
which began late last month, continued Monday when workers rejected
a language compromise worked out in the republic's Supreme Soviet
legislature. The compromise made Moldavian the official language but
did not impose it as the language that must be used by all ethnic
groups.
   Strikers demand that the republic's 4.2 million people, 64
percent of whom are ethnic Moldavians, have two official languages:
Russian and Moldavian.

   The Great Montana Centennial Cattle Drive
began Monday in the golden light of sunrise as the lead longhorns
crested a ridge in single file and then all 2,700 animals formed an
undulating, bawling river of beef.
   The six-day, 60-mile journey from this small community on the
high plains of eastern Montana to the stockyards of Billings is the
largest spectacle in Montana's year-long celebration of its birthday
as a state.
   The cattle, herded by a band of 105 drovers, was joined south of
here by a contingent of about 300 covered wagons and 3,000 riders
prepared to spend the next week on the trail.
   Shortly before daybreak, the cattle were headed up east of town
along the Musselshell River where they had been bedded down
overnight.
   As the sun broke over the horizon and lightened the clear sky,
the first longhorns trotted over the hill. Steam jetted from the
nostrils of cows and horses in the crisp air and the cattle kicked
up a haze of dust that drifted through the morning light.
   Whistling and whooping drovers in bright yellow slickers and
waving lassos and bullwhips, urged the complaining, reluctant herd
southward into a small canyon and between fields of brilliant green
alfalfa.
   From there, the cattle were moved onto open range.
   At late morning, cheers greeted the sight of huge longhorns being
herded through Roundup, leading the miles of wagons and riders
toward their rendezvous with the main herd.
   Stomping and snorting in confusion, one group of the animals
turned onto Main Street where they were met with thousands of
spectators lining the mile-long route. The crowd shied away from the
steers, each standing about six feet tall with horns spanning as
much as five feet.
   The people cheered and applauded many of the riders and wagons,
and cheered and rose to their feet, hands over their hearts, when
the first of several flags finally appeared in the parade column.
   Riders on horseback and in wagons took on the appearance of their
Old West forerunners, except in their desire to record the event.
Many trained their video cameras on the other wagons and the crowd.
   The first day of the cattle drive was marred by only one serious
injury.
   Buck Draper, a cook from Colorado Springs, Colo., suffered a hip
injury when his horse reared over backwards and fell on him, said
Musselshell County Sheriff Brian Neidhardt. He was flown by
helicopter to a Billings hospital.
   The re-creation of an Old West drive will climax with another
parade when the cattle arrive in Billings on Saturday.
   On the trail, the horse and wagon riders will eat catered meals
and be entertained nightly by country-western performers.
   Trucks will bring 200,000 gallons of water and 70 tons of hay
each day to the animals.
   Montana's erractic end-of-summer weather, which can range from
driving rain to broiling heat, remains the greatest threat to the
drive. Forecasts call for rain and cooler temperatures for most of
the week.

Monday as part of a two-week tour of Latin America.
   The 39-year-old princess, the only daughter of British Queen
Elizabeth II, has avoided reporters since Buckingham Palace
announced Thursday that she was separated from her husband, Mark
Phillips, after 15 years of marriage. It said they do not plan a
divorce but Anne will live at the family home, Gatcombe Park, and
Phillips, 40, will move to another house in Gloucestershire.
   Anne, head of the International Equestrian Federation, was
attending an International Olympic Committee meeting in Puerto Rico
when the separation announcement was made.
   She went to Belize before coming to Honduras and also is
scheduled to visit Bolivia and Ecuador, returning home in
mid-September.

   Leaders of the Palestinian uprising said Monday
the United States was stalling efforts for peace, and they urged
residents of the West Bank and Gaza Strip to escalate the revolt
against Israeli occupation.
   Israeli newspapers said U.S. officials were angered by lack of
progress and had told Israel they might support Egyptian demands for
concessions in Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's peace plan.
   Israeli soldiers imposed a curfew on Talluza, a West Bank village
35 miles north of Jerusalem, after residents stoned an army truck
and set it afire, military and Arab sources reported.
   The truck driver, said to have lost his way, escaped and fled to
a nearby army base. Soldiers later entered the village, and Arab
sources said they were searching for those who attacked the truck.
   Arab hospital sources said 20 Palestinians in the occupied
territories were wounded Monday by lead or plastic bullets shot by
soldiers.
   Since the uprising began 21 months ago, 557 Palestinians have
been killed by Israeli soldiers or civilians and 39 Israelis have
died. At least 106 Palestinians have been slain by fellow Arabs who
accused them of collaborating with Israel.
   In a leaflet distributed in the Israeli-occupied lands Monday,
the uprising's underground leaders accused the United States of
``regressing'' in talks with the leadership of the Palestine
Liberation Organization.
   It said ``the American obstinancy is blocking tangible progress
in a peace settlement.''
   The United States began talks with the PLO in December after the
group recognized Israel and renounced terrorism. That stategy,
spearheaded by PLO chief Yasser Arafat, seemed to rest on persuading
the United States to pressure on Israel to make concessions for
peace.
   But the leaflet said the lack of progress ``casts serious doubts
among the rank-and-file of our people about the usefulness of the
U.S.-PLO dialogue.''
   It added: ``Facing these obstacles, our people have no choice but
to escalate the uprising, the only option for reaching freedom and
independence.''
   Israel radio said, meanwhile, that U.S. Ambassador William Brown
told Israeli officials last week Secretary of State James A. Baker
III was ``favorably disposed'' to Egypt's stand on the Shamir plan
for elections in the occupied territories.
   The plan, put forward in April, calls for electing Palestinians
to open talks with Israel on interim autonomy for the territories.
   President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt raised 10 points related to the
plan that essentially demand such Israeli concessions as agreeing to
trading occupied land for peace and allowing the 140,000 Arabs of
east Jerusalem to vote.
   Shamir's right-wing Likud bloc has ruled out either step. But the
left-of-center Labor Party, which is a partner with Likud in the
coalition government, has accepted both moves.
   American diplomats were not available to comment on the reports
because of the Labor Day holiday.
   In their leaflet, the uprising leaders called for residents of
the occupied lands to ``refrain from rash decisions'' about
suspected collaborators and consult uprising leaders before warning
or punishing them.
   A similar appeal in a leaflet distributed Aug. 15 had no effect.
   There have been reports Israeli security forces are arming
collaborators, and the Hebrew daily Maariv said Monday that the
Arabs were receiving military training in use of weapons.

<HEAD>U.S. Government Blacklists Panamanian Officials</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELOY O. AGUILAR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States placed Panamanian
officials on a blacklist Monday, forbidding U.S. companies and
government agencies from buying from them or their businesses.
   U.S. Embassy officials said the action was intended to ``hurt the
pocketbooks'' of people associated with Panamanian strongman Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   The measure affects Panamanian officials who own companies that
sell millions of dollars to the U.S. Southern Command military
installations or to the Panama Canal Commission, a U.S. government
agency that administers the Panama Canal.
   The list released by the U.S. Embassy contains more than 150
names, including all members of the Cabinet and the 14 members of
the Defense Forces' Strategic Command, the officials said.
   U.S. government agencies in Panama spend almost $900 million on
goods and services in Panama.
   Embassy officials said they plan to release a list of companies
owned by Noriega or people near to him within days.
   The U.S. government does not recognize the provisional president,
Francisco Rodriguez, who took office Friday. The United States
considers Rodriguez a puppet of Noriega, the Defense Forces leader
who has been indicted by two federal grand juries in Florida on drug
trafficking charges.
   Rodriguez filled the vacuum created when the Panamanian
government annulled the May 7 elections, which international
observers say the opposition was winning by a 3-to-1 margin.
   Rodriguez, who swore in his Cabinet on Monday, said he would
govern with an appointed legislative commission. Six of the 11
Cabinet members were re-appointed.
   Opposition leaders, who refused to participate in the new
government, last weekend turned down an offer to participate in the
41-member legislative commission.
   ``Our fight is for the democratization of our country and not for
bureaucratic spoils or for political spaces,'' said Ricardo Arias
Calderon, a vice presidential candidate in the May elections.
   The list released Monday includes Fortunato Magravita, owner of a
meat market that counts the Southern Command among its principal
customers. Magravita is a director of the National Bank of Panama.
   The U.S. Army also is the biggest customer of the company Firmas
Efficientes, a computer paper and forms distributor owned by Angel
Modesto Jaen, an official of the National Sports Institute and one
of those on the list.
   ``U.S. companies cannot sell to these people or their companies
or extend any credit,'' said embassy spokesman Terry Kneebone.
   Still in effect are U.S. government sanctions imposed on Panama
more than a year ago that withhold payment of canal fees and taxes
on Panama Canal Commission salaries. The sanctions also freeze
Panamanian government funds in the United States and forbid U.S.
companies from dealing with Panamanian government agencies.
   U.S. officials and opposition leaders acknowledge that the
sanctions had not achieved the desired effect: Noriega's ouster.
   Sources indicated that U.S. companies and others were violating
the sanctions through intermediaries.
   ``This time the Treasury Department will be more vigorous in the
application of the sanctions,'' a U.S. source said on condition of
anonymity.
   Many of those on the list were reported to have bank accounts and
properties in the United States and U.S. officials said the Treasury
Department ``was not discounting'' further action regarding those
assets.
   The U.S. government's displeasure with those associated with
Noriega will also mean revoking the U.S. citizenship of Panamanian
Finance Minister Orville K. Goodin, the sources said. Goodin, who
also holds Panamanian citizenship, held the same post in the
previous Cabinet.
   Officials confirmed the United States acted to remove Goodin's
citizenship on the grounds he is an official of a foreign government.

   Minna Keal, who is 80 and resumed her music studies
after retiring, heard the premiere of her first symphony Monday at
the Royal Albert Hall.
   ``I'm living my life in reverse; instead of feeling that my whole
life is behind me, I feel it's all in front of me,'' she said before
the British Broadcasting Corp. Symphony Orchestra performed her
work, which she calls simply ``Symphony.''
   ``I feel as though all my dreams that I had as a teen-ager are
now coming true,'' Mrs. Keal, a small, white-haired woman with a
melodic voice, said on BBC televison.
   In her teens, she reluctantly quit music studies at the Royal
Academy to devote herself to the family book business in London.
   She resumed them upon retiring and has composed three other major
works. ``Symphony'' was finished four years ago.
   ``The fact of her having produced a major symphony _ a major
symphony, not just a nice little symphony _ as her third piece of
music is beyond belief,'' said Oliver Knussen, who taught Mrs. Keal
composition and conducted her work Monday night at the annual summer
``Promenade'' concerts, so named because holders of bargain tickets
stand throughout.
   ``You can't predict anything with a talent like that,'' Knussen
said on television.
   After the concert, the BBC showed the composer at Royal Albert
Hall, modestly acknowledging the applause, smiling at the audience
and applauding the orchestra.
   Mark Pappenheim of the newspaper Independent called the work ``an
astonishingly assured achievement for any composer's first
orchestral work, let alone for an old age pensioner.''
   ``It's music that expresses a fierce concern for all the human
brutality and turmoil her life has witnessed, backed by a full
battery of percussion from tam-tams to tom-toms, via bongos and a
whip,'' he wrote.
   Mrs. Keal, who composes at the piano, said her modern composition
drove her husband so crazy at first that she had to work in the
garage of their home in Berkshire, northwest of London.
   She said he now does the housework to leave her more time to
compose, and has come to enjoy her music.
   ``He got wedded to it when he first heard my symphony being
rehearsed,'' she said. ``It really bowled him over.''

   A broad area of thunderstorms soaked the central Plains with
heavy rains on Labor Day, but most of the western half of the nation
had sunny skies and eastern skies were clear to partly cloudy.
   The rain fell heaviest across eastern Nebraska, eastern Kansas,
western Iowa, and northern and western Missouri, with most places
getting about 2 inches, with between 3 and 5 inches reported in some
areas.
   Flood warnings issued for eastern Nebraska's Maple Creek in Dodge
County, which swelled to 2 feet above flood stage, expected to reach
4 feet above flood stage Tuesday morning. High water closed some
roads around Kansas City, Mo.
   Strong southerly winds followed the thunderstorms in southern
Iowa and extreme northern Missouri. Wind gusts reached 58 miles an
hour at Ottumwa, Iowa, and 47 miles an hour at Spickard, Mo.
   Heavy rain also fell in parts of Minnesota and Wisconsin as
thunderstorms moved across the area.
   Thunderstorms were scattered across coastal parts of the Gulf and
South Atlantic states, including the Florida Peninsula.
Apalachicola, Fla., got 1{ inches of rain in two hours Monday
afternoon.
   Skies were sunny on Labor Day across most of the Western half of
the nation. Skies were partly cloudy or clear over inland sections
of the Gulf Coast states, the Tennessee and Ohio valleys, the
Appalachians and the Middle and North Atlantic coast states.
   Hurricane Gabrielle, with highest sustained winds of 125 mph,
continued to move toward the west northwest over the open Atlantic.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 55
degrees at Arcata, Calif., to 106 degrees at Palm Springs, Calif.
The low in the Lower 48 states on Labor Day morning was 19 degrees
at Jackson, Wyo.
   The national forecast for Tuesday called for showers and
thunderstorms from Florida and southern Georgia to the central Gulf
Coast; scattered showers and thunderstorms from the lower Great
Lakes region across the lower Ohio and middle Mississippi valleys to
parts of Kansas, Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle; widely scattered
thunderstorms in the mountains of Arizona; and scattered showers
from western Montana to Washington state.
   High temperatures will be in the 70s from North Carolina to New
England, and from northern Michigan to Minnesota; in the 60s and 70s
from the northern Rockies to the Pacific Northwest and along the
California coast; 100 degrees in parts of Texas, and between 100 and
110 degrees in the desert Southwest. Elsewhere, highs will be in the
80s and 90s.

<HEAD>Soldier Convicted of Giving Information to Radicals Now Instructs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawmakers in Northern Ireland
expressed anger Monday that a soldier convicted of providing
information that could be of use to terrorists is now an army
instructor in England.
   Cpl. Cameron Hastie, 23, of the 1st Battalion of the Royal Scots,
was given an 18-month suspended jail sentence in Belfast Crown Court
last year after being convicted of giving information to the Ulster
Volunteer Force, an outlawed Protestant group.
   The disclosure of Hastie's job as an instructor followed a recent
case in which Protestant extremists claimed they used security-force
information to select the man they killed Aug. 25.
   The Ulster Freedom Fighters said they obtained security force
documents that identified Loughlin Maginn as a member of the
outlawed Irish Republican Army. Ulster Freedom Fighters gunmen
killed Maginn in his house. His family denied he had ties to the IRA.
   The mainly Roman Catholic IRA is fighting to unite Northern
Ireland, a British province where protestants outnumber Catholics
3-2, with the predominantly Catholic Republic of Ireland. Protestant
terrorists determined to keep Northern Ireland in the United Kingdom
are battling the IRA extremists.
   A British army spokesman in Northern Ireland, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, confirmed that Hastie had returned to duty
and had been appointed as an instructor at a training base in
England. He refused to say which base.
   ``I do not believe that anyone convicted of offenses should ever
be allowed to serve in the security forces again. I am appalled,''
said John Alderdice, leader of the centrist Alliance Party that has
both Protestant and Catholic supporters.
   Ken Maginnis of the largely Protestant Official Unionist Party
said Hastie's return to duty showed ``a degree of contempt to the
entire community in Northern Ireland.''
   Northern Ireland Minister John Cope has said that any member of
the army or police found guilty of passing information to terrorists
could expect to suffer the ``full severity of the law.''
   The Ulster Freedom Fighters is a code name for the Ulster Defense
Association, a group founded in 1971 to coordinate paramilitary
groups that favor British rule in Northern Ireland.

   The 24th annual Jerry Lewis Labor Day Telethon
wrapped up Monday with the comic coaxing $42,209,727 in cash and
pledges from about 100 million viewers.
   Corporations contributed an additional $36,228,846 during the

Dystrophy Association is involved in fighting. Lewis called the
advances ``stunning to the heart, stunning to the mind.''
   As in previous years, it was the victims and their families who
provided the telethon's most affecting moments.
   United Airlines executive Bob Sampson drew a standing ovation
from 2,000 people in the Jerry Lewis Theater at the Cashman Field
Center when he said: ``There's been enough of this disease killing
children and devastating families.''
   Sampson, who has suffered from muscular dystrophy since he was a
teen-ager and has lost two grandchildren to the disease, appeared in
a poignant appeal and encouraged viewers to keep up the fight until
the disease is beaten.
   Sampson told Lewis last week he would rather not be on the
telethon this year because it was too hard on him emotionally. Lewis
said he persuaded Sampson to return because he has been an
inspiration in the annual event.
   Lewis was moved to tears when former high school football coach
Charlie Wedemeyer, the subject of the TV movie ``Quiet Victory,''
told the audience, ``You never know which dollar it will be to make
the difference and win the fight.''
   Wedemeyer of Los Gatos, Calif., is paralyzed by amyotrophic
lateral sclerosis, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease. He conveyed
his message through his wife, Lucy, who read his lips.
   ``So often I feel I am a prisoner in my own body that has been
given a life sentence,'' Wedemeyer said. ``But I have chosen, with
God's help, to turn this disadvantage into an advantage.''
   The Oak Ridge Boys stopped the show Sunday when they introduced
11-year-old Bradley Thomas Walker of Huntsville, Ala., the Alabama
poster child for the Muscular Dystrophy Association. They then sang
their hit ``Elvira,'' with the child.
   Lewis has been a spokesman for the New York City-based Muscular
Dystrophy Association for 40 years, conducting the annual Labor Day
telethons for the benefit of ``Jerry's Kids'' since 1966.
   The telethons have raised more than $500 million from individual
donors and hundreds of millions more in corporate contributions that
are not included in the telethon totals.
   Lewis said last week that the 1989 telethon would have a special
meaning. This spring, Lewis, 63, and his 38-year-old wife, Sam,
learned she was pregnant, then were told May 5 that the fetus' heart
had stopped beating.
   Mrs. Lewis was two months pregnant at the time. Lewis has six
sons by a previous marriage.
   Famed heart surgeon Michael DeBakey of Houston said great strides
are being made to find the cause and cure for muscular dystrophy.
   ``The future is so optimistic, so great,'' DeBakey said. ``I
think it's wonderful that the American people can be assured that
the money given to this great cause will find a solution and
eliminate the disease.''
   More than 50 top-name entertainers were featured on this year's
show, including Tony Orlando, Frank Sinatra, Liza Minnelli, Sammy
Davis Jr., Billy Crystal, Alabama, the Oak Ridge Boys, Jack Jones,
Robert Goulet, the McGuire Sisters, LaToya Jackson, Ringo Starr,
Waylon Jennings and Maureen McGovern.
   Co-hosts included Davis, Orlando, Ed McMahon, Casey Kasem, Julius
La Rosa and Norm Crosby.

   Col. Moammar Gadhafi received a message from Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega during a meeting with two daughters of the
Panamanian leader, the official Libyan news agency reported Monday.
   JANA, monitored in Rome, said Noriega's daughters were in Libya
to take part in ceremonies Friday marking the 20th anniversary of
the coup that brought Gadhafi to power.
   It did not say when the meeting took place. After anniversary
festivities, Gadhafi went to Yugoslavia for the meeting of the
non-aligned movement.
   JANA said the women delivered a ``written letter from their
father,'' who as chief of Panama's Defense Forces is the most
powerful individual in that country. The agency did not elaborate.
   In a later dispatch, JANA said Lorina Noriega told the agency
Panamanians regarded Gadhafi as ``the best example in the struggle
for liberation and independence.''
   She said the Panamanian people ``appreciates highly the role of
the great Al-Fatah (Libyan) revolution in supporting it against the
plots concocted by U.S. imperialism,'' JANA reported.
   Gadhafi declared his support for the Central American country in
a speech Friday.
   Noriega has been in conflict with the U.S. government since last
year. Noriega denies U.S. charges against him of drug dealing.
Washington refused to recognize a new president named by Panama's
Council of State, which is considered to be under Noriega's control.
   Gadhafi also has been in conflict with the United States, which
bombed Libya in 1986 to retaliate for what it called Libyan support
of terrorism.

<HEAD>Eritrean Rebel Leader Assassinated</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Assassins killed a military leader of an
Ethiopian rebel army at his home in the Sudanese town of Kassala on
the border with Ethiopia, a source reported Monday.
   That report was confirmed by Idriss Mohammed, a leader of the
Eritrean Liberation Front. He gave no details in an interview with
the Qatar News Agency but blamed a rival Eritrean rebel group.
   The source, speaking on the condition he not be identified, said
Mohamed Hassab Mohamed, chief of state of the Eritrean Liberation
Army, was sitting in front of his house in Kassala when three gunmen
in a passing car opened fire Sunday, killing him instantly.
   The Eritrean Liberation Army is the military wing of the Eritrean
Liberation Front that has been fighting for more than 20 years for
autonomy for the northern Ethiopian province of Eritrea.
   Although the Eritrean Liberation Front is the oldest rebel
organization it is considered weaker than another faction, the
Eritrean People's Liberation Front.
   Idriss Mohammed told the Qatar agency that gunmen of the Eritrean
Popular Front killed Mohamed. It was believed he referred to the
Eritrean People's Liberation Front.
   The source said no group claimed responsibility for the killing
but Ethiopian police have arrested one suspect. Police declined
comment.
   Representatives of the Ethiopian government and the Eritrean
People's Liberation Front are scheduled to open peace talks this
week in Atlanta, under the sponsorship of former President Jimmy
Carter. The meetings are to be held at the Carter Center, a research
institution.
   The source said police posted guards around offices of various
Ertrean organizations in Kassala, 300 miles east of Khartoum.
   Sudan, which has long had a territorial dispute with Ethiopia,
has harbored Eritrean rebels. There are nearly 1 million Ethiopian
refugees in Sudan who fled their homeland because of famine and the
fighting.
   The Eritrean Liberation Front and several other rebel factions
met early this year with Ethiopian representatives in Khartoum but
no agreement was reached on further negotiations. The Eritrean
People's Liberation Front boycotted those talks, rejecting the
Ethiopian porposals for limited autonomy.

<HEAD>Environmentalists Say Tourism Destroying Alps</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 100 million travelers visit the Alps each
year and may destroy them by the next century, two environmental
groups said Monday.
   ``The main problem is too much tourism and the departure of
agriculture,'' said Martin Holdgate, head of the Switzerland-based
World Conservation Union. He urged tourists to ``behave in less
damaging ways.''
   Pollution by cars and other means, littering and off-trail skiing
are major dangers, said a survey by Holdgate's group and the
International Center for Alpine Environments, based in France.
Forest damage and soil erosion are among the serious consequences,
the report said.
   According to the survey, the number of hotel beds and visiting
cars continues to rise and the use of lifts serving 41,000 ski
trails increases by about 5 percent annually.
   ``If you have too many people visiting the Alps, the way it is
today, there will be no Alps to visit in the next century,'' said
Dominique Rambaud of the French organization.
   He said the French resort area around Albertville, where the 1992
Winter Olympics will be held, is under ``particular pressure.''
   About 12 million people live in the Alps and more than 100
million visit every year, 60 percent of them for a day or weekend,
the survey said.
   It recognized tourism as an economic mainstay for many areas and
said one solution was to promote its less damaging forms, such as
cross-country skiing, hiking and camping.

   A former prime minister said in memoirs
published Monday that as recently as 1981, a Russian diplomat
offered to try to influence Finland's presidential election.
   The memoirs ``clearly show the extent of Finnish-Soviet
relations. What was talked and whispered about before is now set
here before our eyes, in black and white,'' said Jukka Tarkka,
editor and co-writer of the book.
   ``The Minister of the President,'' by Center Party politician
Ahti Karjalainen, says that Viktor Vladimirov, a diplomat at the
Soviet Embassy, offered to help Karjalainen win the presidency.
   He says Vladimirov told Paavo Vayrynen, who was then Finland's
foreign minister, that ``he would like to continue to work hard'' so
Karjalainen could succeed longtime President Urho Kekkonen, who had
announced his retirement because of ill health.
   Vayrynen, chairman of the Center Party, related the conversation
in a letter to Karjalainen.
   ``Vladimirov had openly asked Vayrynen how the Soviet Union could
promote my election. He told Vayrynen that he would influence the
Communists and other political parties to support my position,''
Karjalainen wrote.
   Excerpts of the book were first published in a magazine last
week, causing a stir in normally placid Finnish politics.
   Vayrynen denied he acted against the interests of Finland or of
President Mauno Koivisto, who opposed Karjalainen as the Social
Democratic candidate and who won the 1982 election.
   Vayrynen said he spoke to the Soviet diplomat as party leader and
not as a government minister. Legal experts said, however, that
Vayrynen also represented his country and could be accused of a
treasonous act.
   The former foreign minister, who now is opposition leader, said
it was common practice at that time to discuss such matters with the
Soviets, although that had changed since then.
   Finland, defeated in war, was coerced into signing a friendship
treaty with the Soviet Union in 1948. Though officially neutral, its
caution to avoid antagonizing the Soviets gave birth to the word
``Finlandization,'' generally used to describe the subservience of a
small country to a greater power.

   Police used teargas, bullets
and batons to break up anti-election rallies Monday and arrested
Archbishop Desmond Tutu and the Rev. Allan Boesak when they objected
to an armored truck blockading the entrance to a church.
   ``They have gone berserk,'' Tutu said after being held by police
in Cape Town for 90 minutes. ``They are clearly no longer in charge
and they are aware of it. I want to say to the world that the
terrorists in South Africa are the South African government.''
   Acting President F.W. de Klerk said in his final campaign speech
that white domination must end, but in a way that does not lead to
whites being dominated. Before de Klerk spoke at a rally in the
Johannesburg City Hall, 125 blacks marched there to present a
petition telling him that Wednesday's parliamentary elections
symbolize apartheid to the black majority who cannot vote. The
marchers dispersed peacefully after giving their petition to a
police major.
   In Durban, police fired tear gas and guns to disperse an
anti-election rally of 2,500 students at the multiracial University
of Natal, causing a stampede in which 10 people were hurt. Police
fired tear gas at 500 students holding a banned rally at the Indian
University of Durban-Westville. Officers arrested 26 students at the
two gatherings.
   Cape Town police jammed an armored truck against the door of the
Central Mission Methodist Church where people had gathered for a
rally opposing the election. Some people were trapped inside the
church and witnesses said police beat people trying to to to the
church.
   Tutu, the black Anglican Archbishop of Cape Town; Boesak, the
mixed-race president of the World Alliance of Reformed Churches, and
five other clergymen were arrested when they refused to go away from
the church.
   Journalists were arrested for covering the confrontation and also
were later released.
   ``I was refusing to disperse,'' Tutu told a midnight news
conference. He said he found it unbelievable that a police vehicle
could be used to block the door of a church and he had demanded that
it be removed.
   He also said he would hold a reconsecration service Tuesday at
St. George's Anglican Cathedral because, he said, police had
desecrated it when they entered it Monday evening. About 20
policeman had entered the cathedral, where Tutu officiates, ordered
it closed, barred people from entering to attend a choir concert and
temporarily kept the cathedral dean outside.
   ``This country claims to be Christian, yet they stopped the dean
of the cathedral from access to his cathedral church. Everywhere in
the world the church has been recognized as a place of sanctuary,
even by the craziest of dictators,'' said Tutu, who demanded an
apology from Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok.
   Both Boesak and Tutu were freed after being held briefly. Police
said Boesak had been detained for taking part in an illegal
gathering but they made no comment about Tutu.
   More than 30 police with dogs and batons blocked the Johannesburg
procession 300 yards from the City Hall entrance and ordered the
crowd to disperse. The protesters, holding their placards, sat down
in the street while Cyril Ramaphosa, leader of the National Union of
Mineworkers, South Africa's largest union, asked to present the
petition to de Klerk.
   ``Our people for over a month now have actually been showing in
various ways how these elections are irrelevant,'' Ramaphosa said,
referring to daily protests, rallies marches or acts of defiance
against apartheid laws. He said millions of blacks on Tuesday and
Wednesday will protest in what is expected to be a general strike.
   ``We believe that is the real election. That is how our people
are casting a vote,'' he said.
   Police Maj. Bruce Smith accepted the petition and the crowd was
ordered away from City Hall. De Klerk appeared there soon afterward
to address a mostly supportive National Party crowd of about 600
people.
   ``Discrimination must be eliminated. There is no other
alternative,'' de Klerk said. ``Only the National Party's policy and
direction can assure a new South Africa which will be just and
strong.''
   ``White discrimination, inasmuch as it exists, must come to an
end,'' he told the crowd. But, he said, ``The National Party is not
prepared to exchange white domination for another form of domination
... or for our becoming the dominated people in South Africa.'' He
said one-man, one-vote on a common voters roll would mean domination
of whites.
   Under apartheid, South Africa's 5 million whites control the
government and economy and maintain separate districts, schools and
health services. Blacks number 28 million.
   ``Your elections on Sept. 6 still symbolize apartheid and the
perpetuation of white minority rule,'' said the letter Ramaphosa
carried that was addressed to de Klerk. ``Millions of our people are
outraged that our future can still be decided in an election that is
racist because it excludes the majority of South African citizens on
the basis of their color.''

   Cuban news reports said Monday that as many as
150 people died when a passenger jet bound for Italy crashed in a
thunderstorm shortly after leaving Havana's airport.
   Italian and Cuban officials worked Monday to identify victims of
Sunday's crash in which all but one of the 126 people on the
Soviet-made jetliner were killed. Cuban news reports said another 25
were believed killed on the ground.
   Cuba's official news agency Prensa Latina said 22 bodies had been
identified by Monday evening, including four crewmembers and nine
who were killed by falling wreckage after the plane exploded. It did
not release any names.
   Prensa Latina said 104 bodies had been taken to the medical
examiner's office.
   The plane crashed during a heavy thunderstorm after takeoff from
Jose Marti airport, sending flaming debris plummeting into
neighborhoods on the southern outskirts of the capital.
   The chartered Cubana de Aviacion jetliner en route to Milan was
carrying 113 Italians, two Cubans and a crew of 11, said the Cuban
ambassador to Rome, Javier Ardizones. He confirmed there was one
survivor.
   The cause of the crash had not been determined, but a Foreign
Ministry employee in Rome said the weather appeared to be a factor.
   ``It was very bad, a storm, with rain and lightning,'' he said,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The lone survivor from the plane was not immediately identified,
Prensa Latina. It did not give the survivor's condition.
   Cuban film critic Jose Antonio Gonzalez, 44, was one of the two
Cubans killed, it said.
   President Fidel Castro and Nobel Prize-winning author Gabriel
Garcia Marquez visited the crash site and then Castro visited the
hospitals where Prensa Latina earlier reported that at least 63
people were taken with injuries. Many had extensive burns and
multiple fractures, Prensa Latina said.
   The latest report did not make clear whether the number of
injured people changed as the death toll climbed to 150 from 126 the
news agency reported earlier.
   A taxi driver and three passengers he was driving down Boyeros
Avenue in the Havana suburb of Boyeros were among the injured, it
said.
   Prensa Latina said the crash of the Ilyushin 62 was the worst in
the history of Cubana de Aviacion.
   The fact that most of the victims were foreigners and the bodies
were burned slowed the identification process, the agency said.
   ``In this task, we are receiving valuable collaboration from
officials of the Italian Embassy and the Revolutionary National
Police,'' it said.
   Many of the 24 people being treated at the Calixto Garcia
Hospital, one of several where the injured were taken, had burns on
more than 70 percent of their bodies and multiple fractures, it
said. Fifteen were in critical condition, six serious and the rest
had minor injuries, the agency said.
   A government commission headed by Rogelio Acevedo, president of
the Civil Aeronautics Institute, was investigating the cause of the
crash, Prensa Latina said.
   Castro expressed his condolences to the Italian people in a
message sent through the Italian Embassy in Havana, the report said.
   Planes were landing Monday at Jose Marti airport but were not
taking off from there, Prensa Latina said.
   Italian television showed footage of emergency workers rushing
through the wreckage carrying bodies on stretchers in the darkness.
Firefighters aimed streams of water at the charred shell of the
plane.
   Nearby were the smoldering hulks of two trucks apparently hit by
the plane. Youths stood at the door of a one-story house whose roof
appeared damaged by the nearby plane. Flames leaped from a pile of
rubble.
   Soldiers in green uniforms surrounded the plane, helping rescue
workers sort through the wreckage.
   Mexico's Excelsior news agency said there was a heavy downpour
with thunder and lightning when Flight 9046 took off for Milan,
Italy, with a scheduled refueling stop in Cologne, West Germany.
   Pope John Paul II sent condolences Monday to the families of
victims.

   Rescue teams Monday found no trace
of a domestic jetliner that vanished in the Amazon jungle with 54
people aboard after the pilot said he needed to make an emergency
landing.
   A transportation official said the jet, which disappeared late
Sunday en route to Belem, could not have landed in the jungle and
probably crashed. A Varig airline spokesman Monday night described
press accounts that the plane landed safely in the Amazon as
``totally false.''
   ``We have not located the plane,'' spokesman Joao de Souza said
in Rio de Janeiro.
   In Brasilia, the capital, air force spokesman Col. Ronaldo Borges
said the search for the Boeing 737-200 had been suspended until
first light Tuesday.
   ``We don't have a precise location of where the plane went down
and that is making the search operation difficult,'' Borges said.
   The plane disappeared on the last leg of a regularly scheduled
flight from the southeastern city of Sao Paulo to Belem, 2,140 miles
northwest of Rio at the mouth of the Amazon River, Varig spokesman
Gilberto Brito said.
   The plane was carrying 48 passengers and a crew of six, all
Brazilian, he said.
   ``In his last contact, the pilot said he would try an emergency
landing,'' Brito said. The pilot, Cesar Augusto Padula Garcez, did
not say why he needed to land, he said.
   The Belem supervisor for Infraero, the government agency in
charge of commercial airports, said in a radio interview the plane
probably had crashed.
   ``A plane of that size would have no chance of a successful
emergency landing in the middle of the jungle,'' Col. Pompeu Brasil
said in an interview with the Radio Liberal station of Belem.
   In Belem, a Varig official said on condition of anonymity: ``We
have checked two rumors, one that the plane landed in Amazonas state
and another that it landed on an Indian reservation in southern Para
state. But nothing has been confirmed.''
   Varig spokesman de Souza added, ``The plane's beacon emits an
emergency signal that is being picked up. But it takes time to
pinpoint the exact spot where the signal is coming from.''
   Brito said Flight 254 took off Sunday morning from Sao Paulo,
Brazil's biggest city with 10 million people. The plane made its
scheduled stops in Uberaba, Uberlandia, Goiania, Brasilia,
Imperatriz and Maraba, he said.
   Early Sunday evening, the plane took off from Maraba in good
weather, Brito said. Shortly afterward, the pilot signaled by radio
that he was flying at 8,000 feet with only one engine working and
would try an emergency landing in the jungle guided by a forest
fire, the spokesman said.
   Varig and Infraero rescue teams began searching for the plane
Sunday in the dense jungle.
   Air force spokesman Borges said air force planes, private
aircraft and helicopters were to resume the aerial search at dawn
Tuesday.

   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez
de Cuellar met Monday with Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar
Velayati in an effort to get the stalled Iran-Iraq peace talks going
again.
   Perez de Cuellar, in Belgrade for a summit conference of the
non-aligned movement, is scheduled to meet with Iraqi Foreign
Minister Tariq Aziz before leaving Wednesday.
   ``We are ready to continue our trilateral talks, I mean the
(U.N.-Iran-Iraq) peace talks, under the supervision of the
secretary-general, any time, any place,'' Velayati told reporters
after the meeting.
   Perez de Cuellar said the talks were based on U.N. Resolution 598
that calls for the withdrawal of Iraq's and Iran's troops to
internationally recognized borders and the exchange of prisoners of
war.
   Velayati said the secretary-general's latest proposal calls for
the withdrawal of Iraqi forces from Iranian territory and the
repatriation of the POWs.
   ``We welcome the proposal and are waiting for the result of the
meeting the secretary-general is going to have with the other
side,'' Velayati said. ``It is a pity that innocent people, the
POWs, from both sides are still (held) there. We do hope we could
repatriate all of them as soon as possible after withdrawal of the
Iraqi troops.''
   Velayati said about 50,000 Iraqi POWs have been registered and
29,000 Iranians held by Iraq have been registered as POWs.
   Iraq's Foreign Ministry said 10 months ago it had a list of
25,000 unregistered Iranian POWs, according to Velayati.
   He said that list has not been handed over to the International
Committee of the Red Cross.
   ``We say the first step of repatriation is the registration of
(all) Iranian POWs in Iraq,'' said Velayati. ``On the basis of
humanitarian considerations, Iran is ready to repatriate all from
both sides, immediately after the withdrawal of Iraqi forces from
Iranian territory.''
   He said the troop withdrawals could take place in two weeks while
repatriation of the POWs would take 90 days.
   Iran and Irag went to war in September 1980 following border
clashes. Fighting ended in August 1988 under a U.N.-arranged
cease-fire.

   Jurors head back to federal court Tuesday
to learn whether PTL founder Jim Bakker is competent to continue his
trial for fraud and conspiracy.
   The TV evangelist spent Labor Day confined for psychiatric
examination in the Federal Correctional Institute mental health unit
in Butner, about 100 miles northeast of here, on the orders of U.S.
District Judge Robert Potter.
   ``It's still a little bit up in the air,'' Bakker's psychiatrist,
Dr. Basil Jackson, said Monday in a telephone interview from
Milwaukee. ``I haven't been given the green light yet to go and see
him.''
   Bakker, anxious and disheveled with chains on his hands and legs,
was escorted by federal marshals to Butner after Jackson testified
Bakker was hallucinating and hiding his head under a couch in his
attorney's office.
   Potter suspended Bakker's trial pending a determination of
whether the TV evangelist is competent to stand trial. The jurors
were not told about Bakker's condition, but were told to check with
the court on Tuesday to see whether court proceedings would continue
Wednesday.
   Jackson said he was told psychiatrists at Butner were speeding up
their evaluation of Bakker's emotional state over the weekend.
   ``If that's true, then it's conceivable one of their people could
come back into court Tuesday or Wednesday to certify that he's
(Bakker) ready to come back into trial,'' he said.
   Attempts on Monday to reach administrators at Butner were
unsuccessful, and attorneys and others in the case are forbidden to
discuss it under a gag order issued by Potter.
   Dr. Sally Johnson, chief of psychiatric services at Butner, has
said evaluations of patients like Bakker typically last 30 days but
could take 45 days or more.
   Jackson, who said he has not been allowed to talk with Bakker
since his arrival at Butner, said he has been in daily contact by
phone with Bakker's wife, Tammy Faye Bakker, and Bakker's attorneys
for news on his condition.
   Jackson also said he has heard Bakker has tried to contact him
daily.
   ``I think that he has settled down and certainly has improved a
lot from the way he was Thursday morning,'' Jackson said.
   ``I continue to be impressed with the emotional strength of this
man and his resilience.''
   He said it was possible Bakker would be ready to return to court
this week.
   ``I'd like to see what condition he's in and have an opportunity
to make a clinical judgment as to the likelihood of whether he might
have a similar reaction to stress in the days ahead,'' Jackson said.
   ``I'm interested not in his ability to be competent to withstand
trial on one day but competent for the entire trial,'' the
psychiatrist said.
   Bakker is charged with 24 counts of fraud and conspiracy and
faces 120 years and prison and more than $5 million in fines.
Prosecutors say Bakker used nearly $4 million in ministry funds to
finance a lavish lifestyle.

<TEXT>
   Thousands of East Germans waiting in the
cold rain for passage to a new life in the West got the
disheartening word from Hungarian officials Monday that their exodus
depends on further talks with East Berlin.
   Interior Minister Istvan Horvath was quoted as telling the West
German weekly Stern that East and West Germany need to agree on the
refugee crisis, and this could take ``perhaps a month, or 1{''
months.
   The hardline East German government is angry over the planned
mass exodus and Hungary's role in it.
   A well-placed Hungarian official, who spoke to The Associated
Press on condition of anonymity, also cited ``need for further
talks'' with East Germany before Hungary gives the go-ahead for an
organized mass departure to West Germany via Austria.
   As recently as Sunday, West German and Hungarian officials had
suggested the departure was imminent of 4,700 East Germans marking
time in tents and summer cabins at five makeshift refugee camps in
Hungary.
   East German refugees began fleeing to the West through Hungary
after the liberal communist regime in Budapest decided in May to
remove barbed wire and other obstacles from its frontier with
Austria.
   Since May, an estimated 6,000 East Germans have fled to Austria.
Their final destination is West Germany, which gives them automatic
citizenship and generous help in starting new lives.
   Interior Ministry spokesmen were not available to comment on the
Stern interview Monday.
   But a woman answering the telephone at the ministry secretariat
said Horvath spoke to Stern Aug. 29, two days before Rezso Nyers,
president of the Hungarian Communist Party, promised West German
Social Democrat politician Karsten Voigt the East Germans could
leave.
   Many East Germans waiting to go West have told reporters they
fear they'll be fired and face legal action if they return.
   But in a statement issued by its Budapest consulate late Monday,
East Germany promised for the first time that those coming home
would have the right to return to their jobs. It said anew they
would not face punishment and could apply for emigration once they
returned home.
   Some of the East Germans have been waiting to leave for more than
a month, and Monday's news of a possible delay struck like a
bombshell.
   At one Budapest camp _ off-limits to reporters like the four
others _ dozens broke off lunches, rushing out the main gate to mob
Western reporters to ask if Horvath's comments were true.
   ``The bread almost fell out of my mouth,'' said a 39-year-old
engineer from Dresden with two children. ``If that's true, I'm
finished, I have to go back to East Germany. I have no more money,
and my children are sick.''
   ``They can't do this to us,'' said a young, single mother, her
eyes brimming over with tears. ``We've been here for 15 days, and
now they're taking away our last hope.''
   Earlier, West German diplomat Gunter Mulack told reporters Bonn
was just waiting for Budapest's word to launch the caravan westward
through Austria to newly built tent cities in Bavaria.
   The refugee camp behind him appeared quieter than usual. Most
residents were inside because of rain and unseasonable cold.
   This would be the largest single transfer of East Germans to the
West since the Berlin Wall was built in August 1961 and would be an
unprecedented case of cooperation between a Soviet bloc and NATO
nation to resettle citizens of another Eastern European nation in
the West.
   More than 500 new arrivals registered Monday with Red Cross
officials managing the four camps in Budapest and a fifth that
opened Friday at Zanka on the shores of Lake Balaton.
   The lake is popular with the 1 million East German tourists who
visit Hungary each year. Up to 200,000 East Germans are thought to
be in Hungary now and Premier Miklos Nemeth has said 20,000 may want
to go to West Germany.
   Hungarian officials said solving the problem was up to the two
Germanys, but then Nyers told Voigt the East Germans would be
allowed to go West. That, in effect, breaks Hungary's 1969 agreement
with East Germany to return those caught trying to flee.
   Budapest's decision embittered the East Germans, whose leaders
have criticized reforms in Hungary and its moves toward multiparty
democracy.
   Escape through Hungary to Austria peaked in late August, with
hundreds of East Germans crossing daily. The Hungarians, apparently
concerned about East German anger, strengthened border patrols and
the flow was cut to a few dozen each night.
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl has urged his countrymen to
welcome the East Germans.
   State assistance has spawned some resentment there.

   Two newspapers that identified a source after
promising confidentiality must pay $200,000 in compensatory damages
but not the $500,000 in punitive damages also awarded by a jury, the
state Court of Appeals said in a ruling released Tuesday.
   First Amendment guarantees of freedom of the press do not protect
the Star Tribune and the St. Paul Pioneer Press Dispatch from
liability under contract laws, in this case the oral contracts of
reporters' confidentiality promises, a three-judge panel said in
upholding the compensatory damages.
   In the ruling to be filed Tuesday in St. Paul, the judges
rejected public relations man Dan Cohen's claim of misrepresentation
by the newspapers and said he is not entitled to punitive damages
awarded by a Hennepin County jury.
   The court also rejected the Star Tribune's contention that the
closing argument for Cohen was so inflammatory that a new trial is
required. The damages payment is to be shared by the newspapers.
   The court made the ruling available to the news media with the
proviso that the parties involved not be contacted for comment
before 8:30 a.m. Tuesday.
   Judge Gary Crippen, in a partial dissent, said the entire
$700,000 award should be overturned because the case ``involves the
exercise of the coercive power of the state to punish the choice of
the private press to publish.''
   In a statement issued for release Tuesday, however, Star Tribune
executive editor Joel R. Kramer said the paper is pleased with the
court's unanimous decision on punitive damages and heartened by
Crippen's partial dissent.
   ``We are disappointed with the court majority's ruling that
contract law applies in this case and supersedes First Amendment
protections,'' he said. No decision on whether to appeal has been
made, he said.
   The case concerns a revelation during the 1982 gubernatorial
campaign that Marlene Johnson, a Democratic Farmer Labor candidate
for lieutenant governor, had been arrested on shoplifting charges
several years earlier.
   Cohen, who worked for Independent-Republican gubernatorial
candidate Wheelock Whitney, provided the information on the
condition that he not be identified as the source.
   Reporters for the two newspapers gave that assurance. But their
editors ordered that Cohen's name be published because, they argued,
the public had the right to know that the information came from the
Whitney campaign.
   Johnon went on to win the election, but Cohen sued, claiming that
he lost his advertising agency job because the newspapers breached
an oral contract.
   The Appeals Court agreed, saying an oral contract between a
source and a reporter is no different from any other contract.
   Any First Amendment rights the newspapers might have had to
publish the source's name were waived when the reporters made the
confidentiality pledge, the opinion said.
   The newspapers' argument that the public had the right to
information about the source was valid, the court said, to provide a
context of the source's credibility and motivations. But that
doesn't mean the papers had to use Cohen's name, the opinion said.
   Cohen based his claim of misrepresentation in part on a legal
inference that editors never intended to keep the reporters'
promises of confidentiality. In addition, he claimed that the
reporters concealed that they had no authority to bind the
newspapers to their promise.
   The Appeals Court said Cohen could not legally infer that the
editors didn't intend to keep the promise. The court also noted that
no witness could recall a previous instance when a reporter's
confidentiality promise was vetoed by an editor at either paper.
   ``Because it was the newspapers' practice to honor their
reporters' promises of confidentiality, the reporters did not by
omission misrepresent their authority,'' the court said in rejecting
punitive damages in the misrepresentation claim.
   Judge Marianne Short, who wrote the decision, defended the ruling
against potential complaints that its effect would be to restrict
the media and limit public access to information.
   ``Were we not to enforce the newspapers' promises of
confidentiality, confidential sources would have no legal recourse
against unscrupulous reporters or editors,'' she said.
   ``Ultimately, news sources could dry up, resulting in less
newsworthy information to publish.''

   A sailor from the USS Iowa said Navy
investigators browbeat him into implicating one of his shipmates as
a suicidal homosexual who may have been responsible for the
explosion that killed 47 crewmen, according to a report broadcast
Monday.
   In an interview with ABC News, Seaman David Smith said he
believed that Gunner's Mate Clayton Hartwig did not cause the
explosion that destroyed one of the battleship's gun turrets.
   According to reports earlier this summer, Smith told naval
investigators that Hartwig had made sexual advances to him the night
before the April 19 explosion and that on other occasions Hartwig
had talked about how to set off explosions and showed him a timer
device.
   ``Part of me can see him doing it,'' Smith was quoted as saying.
   Hartwig died in the explosion with the other sailors.
   In his ABC News interview, Smith said the investigators
questioned him in sessions lasting up to 12 hours and threatened to
charge him with 47 counts of murder and accessory to murder if he
did not cooperate.
   Smith said investigators put words into his mouth and distorted
his testimony, ABC said.
   Navy spokesman Kendall Pease said he was unaware of the ABC
report and had no comment.

   A robber with two revolvers who
grabbed a hostage was fatally wounded in a bungled police operation,
according to press accounts Monday.
   Luis Fernando de Souza, who held a hotel worker hostage for more
than an hour, died at a hospital Sunday just hours after being shot,
newspapers said.
   Police refused comment on the reports, which were carried in most
Rio dailies.
   According to O Globo newspaper, Souza tried to rob the Santa
Comba hotel in downtown Rio but police arrived before he could
escape.
   Souza then reportedly took Francisco Lima Barbosa hostage, held a
gun to his head and demanded police give him a getaway car.
   ``The bandit was drugged and practically leaning on me. It
appeared he couldn't stand. But his finger was firmly on the
trigger,'' Barbosa said.
   While a police official negotiated with Souza, two other officers
quietly approached from behind, the newspaper said.
   Just as one policemen prepared to tackle Souza, however, a second
fired his gun from 30 feet away, accidentally wounding another
officer in the leg, O Globo reported.
   Souza then released his hostage and, firing his guns, tried to
run to nearby hotel.
   About 20 police officers opened fire as Souza fled, fatally
wounding him, O Globo said.

   Fliers at a national air show dipped airplane
wings in salute to a dead comrade Monday following an accident
involving the Snowbirds, the Canadian Forces aerobatic team.
   Two red-and-white jets of the team appeared to touch during a
complicated maneuver on Sunday and plunged into Lake Ontario a few
hundred yards from Toronto's waterfront exhibition grounds where
70,000 spectators watched the mishap.
   Maj. Dan Dempsey of Edmonton, Alberta, the 36-year-old commander
of the precision flying team, ejected safely but Capt. Shane Antaya,
24, of Stratford, Ontario, was still in his aircraft when it
nosedived into the water.
   Antaya's wife, mother, brother and sister were watching from the
shoreline, Col. Claude Thibault told reporters.
   Divers found Antaya's body on the bottom of the lake near the
wreckage of his CT-114 Tutor training jet shortly before the Monday
afternoon show began. Witnesses said he steered his crippled plane
away from a crowd of boats gathered to watch the show.
   Hillary Forrest of Toronto was on one of the hundreds of boats
near where Antaya's plane crashed.
   She said he appeared to go straight into the lake ``to avoid the
boats. It was so straight down there was no attempt to pull out
whatsoever.''
   June Kirby, a spokeswoman for the Canadian National Exhibition
air show, said it was the wish of other fliers to go on with the
third and last day of show.
   ``I think they wanted to go up there and fly the very best they
could as a tribute to Shane,'' she said.
   Thibault said the seven-member Snowbirds canceled their 15
remaining shows for 1989 and the Canadian Forces was investigating.
   Dempsey was released from Toronto General Hospital after
treatment for facial cuts and leg burns.
   The accident occurred midway through the team's performance,
during a stunt called an upward-downward bomb burst. In the
maneuver, two groups of planes fly past each other at 375 mph.
   Witnesses said the two planes appeared to touch and they tumbled
out of the tight formation. Videotape seemed to confirm the
collision.
   The Snowbirds perform more than 60 shows a year throughout North
America and have had three accidents in which two pilots were killed.
   ``We have flown in 980 shows before 60 million people,'' Thibault
said. ``Our record speaks for itself.''
   Ms. Kirby said that at a morning briefing Monday, the fliers _
from North America and Canada _ paused for a moment of silence for
Antaya. The pilots, flying everything from vintage biplanes to the
latest in jet fighters and bombers, unanimously decided to return to
the skies.
   ``It's a tradition that the pilots have the final say about
whether the show goes on,'' she said.

   Former Gov. Pat Brown once let a death-row
inmate die to get a bill through the legislature, and he's still
haunted by the life-and-death power he held over 59 prisoners.
   Brown emerges as an opponent of the death penalty in ``Public
Justice, Private Mercy,'' the 163-page memoir of his decisions to
grant or withhold clemency from prisoners facing death sentences
while he was governor from 1959-67.
   ``It was an awesome, ultimate power over the lives of others that
no person or government should have, or crave,'' Brown writes.
``Each decision took something out of me that nothing _ not family
or work or hope for the future _ has ever been able to replace.''
   Brown commuted 23 death sentences, the most of any California
governor. He denied clemency in 36 other cases.
   The decisions were some of the most agonizing he ever made, Brown
said in the book he wrote with Dick Adler. It was published last
month by Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson.
   Some of the 23 prisoners whose sentences Brown commuted were
released on parole. One was later convicted of murder. Despite his
opposition to capital punishment, Brown recalled, after learning
about the 1975 murder he stated he would have been willing to trade
all 23 lives for the life of the killer's victim.
   There is a message for future governors, particularly opponents
of capital punishment: The tension between ``justice'' and ``mercy''
may be impossible to resolve, especially in a heated arena of
political ambitions and public expectations.
   The issue is far from academic in California, which with more
than 200 inmates has one the nation's largest's death-row
populations and is likely to begin executing the prisoners soon,
after a 22-year respite.
   The state put more than 500 people to death from 1851 to 1967. In
1976, the U.S. Supreme Court allowed states to resume executions,
but the California Supreme Court under liberal Chief Justice Rose
Bird threw out many death sentences. Since a more conservative court
took over after Bird's election defeat in 1986, state laws have
changed to make executions easier.
   In his book, Brown writes that he found the moral and political
decisions became hopelessly entangled in the case of Richard
Lindsey, a drifter convicted of raping and murdering a 6-year-old
girl in a Kern County farm labor camp in 1961.
   As Brown describes it, he was seriously considering clemency for
Lindsey, who though legally sane had been mentally disturbed for
many years. But the governor also sought legislative approval of a
minimum-wage law for migrant workers, and he needed the vote of a
Kern County lawmaker who wanted Lindsey dead.
   ``By letting Richard Lindsey go to the gas chamber, I was giving
(the victim's) parents and people like them a chance at a living
wage,'' Brown writes. Lindsey died, and the legislation passed.
   Brown criticizes some of his actions and appears to have been
genuinely wrestling with two principles _ his personal opposition to
capital punishment, and his belief he was elected to uphold the law,
including the death penalty.
   Brown is less convincing in describing his decision not to
commute the death sentence of Caryl Chessman, convicted of a string
of kidnappings and rapes who spent 12 years on Death Row before he
was executed in May 1960.
   Brown said Chessman was ``a nasty, arrogant, unrepentant man,''
but probably did not deserve to die because he hadn't killed anyone.
   Brown admits his decision not to grant clemency was partly
because widespread anger at Chessman made that decision politically
untenable.
   Brown concludes that the death penalty is unfair, irrational and
ineffective, but that it will not be abolished until more people
realize how inhumane it is.
   For this reason he supports an initiative being circulated for
California's June 1990 ballot to speed up court proceedings by
narrowing defendants' rights. With speedier appeals, the gas chamber
soon would be operating two or three times a week, Brown said.
   Then, he said, people would ``begin to see the death penalty in
all its naked ugliness.''

<HEAD>Workers Search for Milk Substitute for Baby Sperm Whale</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GALVESTON, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Marine workers searched for hours Monday
before the found the right milk substitute to feed a week-old,
900-pound baby sperm whale found floundering in shallow waters this
weekend.
   The whale, dubbed Odie, was found beached Saturday west of Sabine
Pass and taken by flatbed truck the next day, covered with sunscreen
and wet cloths, to Sea Arama Marine World in Galveston.
   ``He's OK. He's just kind of sitting there'' in his holding tank,
Sea Arama spokeswoman Christy Benson said Monday. ``He now needs
some nourishment. He's a big guy _ and he's just a baby.''
   Odie is estimated to be a little more than a week old, but
already is 13 feet long. ``We don't know why he beached himself,''
Ms. Benson said, adding that most whales become stranded because
they are ill.
   Experts nationwide were contacted for help on caring for Odie
because a sperm whale has never been captive long enough to study,
said Gina Barron, coordinator for the Texas Mammal Stranding
Network, which rescued the whale.
   Marine workers have been feeding the whale an electrolyte
solution through a stomach tube to keep him hydrated, but the mammal
also needs ``caloric intake,'' Ms. Benson said.
   Sea Arama officials had trouble finding a lactose-free milk
substitute for Odie because many businesses were closed for the
Labor Day holiday, but finally found the right veterinary product at
the Houston Zoo, she said.
   Zoo officials ``brought us what they had'' for the whale, Ms.
Benson said. They also told Sea Arama officials where they could
find more Tuesday. The whale's first scheduled ``milk'' feeding was
planned Monday evening.
   ``We're just going to continue to treat him and feed him and hope
for the best,'' she said.
   Laboratories closed because of the Labor Day holiday also have
delayed efforts to find out what's wrong with the whale, she said.
   Odie's move to the marine park Sunday was delayed almost 19 hours
to make sure another whale, possibly the mother, was not in the
area. But no other whale was found, Ms. Benson said.

<TEXT>
   Aaron ``Buck'' Buchwach, former editor in chief
of The Honolulu Advertiser and a colorful figure in Hawaii's news
industry for more than four decades, died Sunday. He was 68.
   Buchwach apparently suffered a heart attack at his home, said the
Advertiser's Editor at Large George Chaplin, a close friend.
Buchwach died at The Queen's Medical Center at 11:47 p.m., a nursing
supervisor said.
   A native of Portland, Ore., Buchwach began his journalism career
in Eugene as a sportswriter for The Register-Guard and graduated
from the University of Oregon with a degree in journalism in 1942.
   He came to Hawaii during World War II and was city editor for the
Pacific edition of Stars &amp; Stripes. He joined the Advertiser in 1946
and held the positions of reporter, city editor, managing editor,
executive editor and editor in chief.
   As an Advertiser reporter, Buchwach interviewed seven U.S.
presidents, as well as Gen. Douglas MacArthur and Adm. Chester
Nimitz. He covered volcanoes, tidal waves, national politics and in
1967 reported on the Arab-Israeli war.
   He served a brief stint in public relations during the 1950s, but
returned to the newspaper. Buchwach retired from the morning
newspaper in February and worked for an advertising agency.
   He headed the Honolulu Press Club for five terms and was a
two-term president of the Hawaii chapter of the Society of
Professional Journalists.
   Buchwach is survived by his wife, Peggy, seven children and four
grandchildren.

<HEAD>Abu Nidal Announces Execution of 15 Arabs As Spies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The radical Palestinian group headed by
terrorist mastermind Abu Nidal said Monday it executed 15 Arabs,
including a woman, as alleged spies for the United States and other
governments.
   Younis Amran, spokesman for the Fatah-Revolutionary Council
group, said the 15 were convicted of ``spying and collaboration'' in
separate trials since November 1987.
   He said the group, comprising 11 Palestinians, two Egyptians, an
Iraqi and a Lebanese, were executed at midnight Sunday ``inside and
outside Palestine.'' He refused to say where.
   Amran said two of those executed worked for the United States and
British intelligence, two for West Germany, two for Egypt, three for
Iraq and six for Jordan.
   He said they all worked under cover with various Palestinian
guerrilla groups but Fatah-Revolutionary Council ``managed to arrest
them before they penetrated our organization.''
   The report came 10 days after a ranking Abu Nidal aide was shot
dead on Aug. 25 in south Lebanon's port of Sidon.
   The Abu Nidal group threatened last week to execute 15 detainees
to avenge the assassination of Rabah Abdul-Rahim.
   Abu Nidal is the nom de guerre of Sabri al-Banna, who split with
Palestine Liberation Organization chief Yasser Arafat in 1973.
   Amran, who spoke at a news conference in West Beirut's Mar Elias
Palestinian refugee camp, refused to confirm or deny that the
executions were in retaliation for Abdul-Rahim's assassination.
   Sources in Sidon said on condition of anonymity that those
executed belonged to a breakaway faction of Abu Nidal's group.

   Striking telephone workers bargained on Labor Day and striking
pilots protested, but for other workers the informal end to summer
was a day for parades and picnics, politicians and fireworks.
   There were also non-labor annual traditions, like the mass walk
across Michigan's 4{-mile Mackinac Bridge, an Indian pow-wow on New
York's Long Island, and the Fred Coleman Memorial Shoot, a pigeon
shoot at Hegins, Pa., that drew animal rights protesters.
   And it was a day to hit the beach. Temperatures near the 70s and
sunshine sent people streaming to recreational areas such as
Massachusetts' Cape Cod, where police reported traffic tie-ups.
   Water temperature of 66 degrees and 2- to 3-foot waves attracted
big crowds to Southern California beaches, including Muscle Beach,
which lived up to its name with a bodybuilders' competition.
   The annual Greater Boston Labor Council breakfast drew striking
Eastern Airlines and New England Telephone Co. workers, as well as
such political figures as Gov. Michael S. Dukakis.
   Steve Early, a spokesman for the Communications Workers of
America, said talks with New England Telephone's parent company,
NYNEX Corp., continued on the holiday and the union was hitting
holiday events throughout the region to urge people not to pay their
phone bills.
   NYNEX also negotiated Monday with the International Brotherhood
of Electrical Workers. The CWA and IBEW have been on strike since
Aug. 6, when 60,000 workers walked off the job.
   Labor Day negotiations appeared unlikely to avert a strike
Tuesday in Sacramento, Calif., by 2,500 teachers. They and teachers
in San Jose, Calif., and Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, prepared to join
counterparts in four other states in strikes affecting 119,000
students.
   In Columbus, Ohio, the state's largest teachers union was the
target of a strike. Some of about 60 secretaries and janitors spent
Labor Day picketing the Ohio Education Association in the fourth day
of a walkout over pay.
   ``This is not the what we wanted to be doing today,'' said Inez
Hott, the union's administrative assistant. ``We should be out
picnicking. Everyone had a lot plans killed because of this. But
we're dedicated.''
   United Mine Workers President Richard L. Trumka was named Citizen
of the Year by the Catholic Labor Institute of Southern California
at its 43rd annual Labor Day Breakfast in Los Angeles. Some UMW
members have been on strike against Pittston Coal Group Inc. since
April in a bitter dispute over wages and benefits.
   New York Gov. Mario Cuomo led mine workers, airline machinists,
telephone company employees and thousands of other union members and
their supporters in a parade up New York City's Fifth Avenue.
   ``Really what we're trying to do is just band together _ strength
in numbers,'' said parade participant Ralph Paugh, a United Mine
Worker from Shady Spring, W.Va.
   Also marching in the parade were supporters of the Polish union
Solidarity carrying banners reading: ``Help Poland Now.'' Piotr
Stasinski, a Warsaw native living temporarily in New York, said
Poland has a massive economic crisis to overcome and needs help from
the West.
   An estimated 100,000 people marched in Detroit's Labor Day
parade. Its theme was ``Michigan Works Best When We Say Union Yes,''
and United Auto Workers President Owen Bieber was one of three grand
marshals.
   Michigan Gov. James Blanchard and his bride, married Saturday,
led about 60,000 people on the traditional Labor Day trek across the
Mackinac Bridge across the Straits of Mackinac connecting Lakes
Huron and Michigan.
   About 8,000 people attended the final day of a three-day pow-pow
on the Shinnecock Indian reservation in Southampton, N.Y. The 43rd
annual pow-wow was dedicated to the memory of its founder, Chief
Thunder Bird, also known as Henry Bess, who died in June.
   More than 300 Indians representing about 70 tribes took part in
tribal dances, chants, and smoking a peace pipe.
   About 400 animal rights activists marched, chanted and screamed
at competitors in the 55th annual Fred Coleman Memorial Shoot in
Pennsylvania. Birds were released one at a time from cages about 20
yards in front of competitors with shotguns. Organizers of the
community fund-raiser had 6,000 birds on hand.
   Community members said the event is a place for family
fellowship. Between volleys, children are sent to collect dead birds
and dispatch wounded ones by pulling off their heads or wringing
their necks.
   ``You have to be a sportsman to understand,'' said Keith
Wolfgang, who has attended the event for 12 years.
   ``These protesters have their priorities mixed up,'' said Joe
Coulter. ``These people are burning flags and are in line for
abortions. It's just un-American.'' ``It's just a pure bloodsquirt
and a real slaughter,'' said protester Bob Witkowski of
Wilkes-Barre, Pa. Other protesters came from as far away as Florida
and Illinois.

   Teachers in California and Idaho prepared to join counterparts in
Michigan, Ohio, Montana and Illinois on the picket line Tuesday in
strikes affecting 135,000 students.
   A Montana school district planned to reopen schools Tuesday with
substitute teachers for 12,500 students, and teachers in another
Montana district with 1,900 students planned to go back to work
after accepting a contract offer.
   Labor Day negotiations with a mediator appeared unlikely to avert
a strike by 2,500 teachers of 43,000 students in Sacramento, Calif.,
but officials of the Sacramento City Unified School District said
schools would open Tuesday with heightened security and substitute
teachers.
   ``It doesn't seem there's very much hope of a settlement at this
point,'' Pat Walden, president of Sacramento City Teachers
Association, said Monday. Issues included pay raises, class size and
hiring deadlines for new teachers.
   Also in California, 1,500 San Jose teachers were set to strike at
40 public schools on opening day Tuesday. School officials were
hiring substitutes and monitors for 29,000 students but on Friday
advised parents to plan for child care ``just in case a regular
instructional program is not possible.''
   The district broke off negotiations Saturday with the teachers,
who have been without a contract for 14 months. The district had
offered a 6 percent wage increase this year with a 1 percent bonus;
teachers demanded 10 percent this year and a retroactive raise of 6
percent for last year.
   In Coeur D'Alene, Idaho, 270 of 312 teachers have voted to strike
Tuesday, though officials said they would to keep schools open for
6,800 students. The teachers want a 4.2 percent increase in wages
and benefits; the district has offered 1 percent.
   State Schools Superintendent Jerry Evans said teachers have no
legal right to strike in Idaho, but courts have been reluctant to
order them back to work.
   Schools in the Great Falls school district in Montana were
scheduled to reopen Tuesday with 540 substitute teachers for 12,500
students. Only 45 of 723 teachers showed up for work there last
week. Salaries top the list of several unresolved contract issues;
School Superintendent Larry Williams and Gene Lemelin, president of
the local teachers' union, said no talks were scheduled.
   Laurel, Mont., teachers voted Saturday to accept a contract
giving them a 2.5 percent raise. The 104 teachers, who had said they
were locked out of the schools last week, were to return to their
1,900 students Tuesday.
   In Michigan, 1,010 teachers in Wayne County's Livonia school
district voted late Monday to strike, said Steve Naumcheff,
president of the Michigan Education Association local. Classes were
to begin Tuesday for 15,815 students.
   Teachers in five other Michigan school districts were on strike
last week, affecting more than 15,000 students. The 149 teachers in
the Mount Morris district voted Monday night on a tentative contract
agreement, but classes for nearly 3,500 students would not resume
before Wednesday.
   Negotiations resumed Monday night in two other Michigan
districts, Ferndale, with 310 teachers and 6,000 students, and
Cheboygan, with 120 teachers and 2,400 students.
   In Ohio, no negotiations were held in the Indian Creek and Warren
school districts, and 730 teachers remained off the job, affecting
11,000 students.
   Schools were to remain shut Tuesday in three school districts in
Pennsylvania, said Joy Conley, director of the Pennsylvania State
Education Association's Midwest Region. The strikes affect 474
teachers and nearly 7,900 students.
   Negotiators worked Labor Day to try to end a week-old strike by
350 teachers in Quincy, Ill., that extended summer vacation for
6,800 students. But classes were not likely to resume Tuesday, when
the school board would meet to consider the teachers' counteroffer.
   The bargaining session Monday with a federal mediator was the
first since Aug. 27, when the school board submitted its last offer.
The next day, teachers voted to strike. Pay was the key issue.

<HEAD>Broad Hurricane Gabrielle May Strengthen in Atlantic</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: New throughout to UPDATE Gabrielle's wind speed to 130 mph,

   Hurricane Gabrielle on Monday pushed a huge,
400-mile-wide band of storm-strength wind across the Atlantic toward
the Caribbean.
   However, it will be four to five days before forecasters can say
if it will strike the U.S. mainland, said Bob Sheets, director of
the National Hurricane Center. It was on a path that could take it
northwest of the Virgin Islands.
   ``The storm is actually a long way away from any potential
impact,'' Sheets said.
   The Atlantic season's fourth hurricane had maximum sustained wind
of 130 mph, and meteorologists at the hurricane center in suburban
Coral Gables said Gabrielle would probably strengthen as it moved
over warm tropical water.
   ``Everything is favorable as far as the hurricane itself is
concerned to strengthen slightly,'' said Sheets. ``It's a very large
hurricane.''
   At 10:30 p.m. EDT, Gabrielle's center was near 19.3 north
latitude and 56.3 west longitude, about 375 miles east of the
northeastern Leeward Islands. It was moving west-northwest at 15 mph
and was expected to continue that course over the next 24 hours.
   Gabrielle had hurricane-force wind of at least 74 mph extending
as far as 100 miles north of its center, according to reports from
an Air Force reconnaissance plane that flew through the storm
Monday, Sheets said.
   Forecasters said wind of tropical-storm force, at least 39 mph,
extended up to 250 miles northeast of the center and 150 miles to
the southwest.
   ``This is definitely a hurricane that needs to be respected,''
forecaster Bob Case said.
   Gabrielle formed Thursday off Africa and its sustained wind
quickly surpassed minimum hurricane force of 74 mph.
   Tropical Storm Felix strengthened as it drifted westerly far to
the north and was expected to gradually turn toward the northwest.
   At 10:30 p.m., the center of Felix was near 36.3 north latitude
and 48.7 west longitude, or about 970 miles southwest of the
westernmost Azores.
   Its winds were estimated at about 65 mph, 25 mph stronger than
Sunday. Forecasters said a ridge to Felix's north had strengthened,
causing Felix's winds to build back.

<HEAD>Government Urges Dialogue With Amerindian Insurgents</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARAMARIBO, Suriname (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government Monday called for a
dialogue with Amerindian insurgents who hijacked a ferryboat, a
small plane and a barge to protest a government peace accord with
Bush Negro guerrillas.
   The Amerindian revolt appeared limited to four villages near the
Dutch-speaking nation's western border with Guyana.
   The National Assembly Monday voted to support ``the government's
efforts to realize peace'' and authorized President Ramsewak Shankar
to hold talks with the Amerindian insurgents.
   An unidentified Amerindian rebel leader said on state television
Sunday night that the uprising was to protest the government's peace
agreement with guerrilla leader Ronny Brunswijk's Jungle Commando.
   The attacks began Friday, shortly after the National Assembly
voted to approve the peace accord.
   Under the terms of the accord, Brunswijk's estimated 200 to 400
men will become a special police force in eastern Suriname where
they operate and where many Amerindians live.
   The Amerindians, allied to the army during the three-year
guerrilla war, fear retribution if they fall under the control of
Brunswijk's men.
   The army also has opposed turning the guerrillas into a police
force.
   Army Commander and strongman Desi Bouterse said Monday the
Amerindian insurgents have ``captured a large amount of supplies and
appear to be well armed. They also have a foreign connection.''
   He said they were receiving funds from supporters in Holland.
   On Sunday, Amerindian gunmen hijacked a rice barge with three
crewmen and occupied a major sluice on the Nickerie River, which
provides irrigation to a large rice-growing area in western
Suriname, the daily De Ware Tyd said Monday.
   Armed Amerindians shot and killed one passenger when they
hijacked a ferryboat about 30 miles west of Paramaribo Friday. An
unspecified number of passengers were still being held Monday.
   The hijackers were also still holding a small aircraft and its
pilot, captured on Friday.
   The Amerindian leader who spoke on state television said hostages
would not be harmed.
   Vice President Henck Arron said the peace accord was explained to
the population over state radio ``in eight languages, including Bush
Negro and Amerindian dialects.''
   He said it does not provide for control of Amerindian communities
by Brunswijk's men.
   The 65,000 Bush Negroes _ descendents of escaped African slaves _
and 10,000 Amerindians are traditional rivals. They compete for land
for farming, hunting and fishing.
   Suriname gained independence from Holland in 1975.

<HEAD>Former Honduran Ambassador Says U.S. Treats Him Like Slave</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former Honduran ambassador to
Panama who is now imprisoned in Miami for importing cocaine said he
is being treated like a slave by prison officials.
   Col. Rigoberto Regalado Lara made the accusation in a telephone
interview with the Tegucigalpa newspaper La Tribunta that was
published Sunday.
   It quoted Regalado Lara as saying:
   ``Although I have been a friend of the United States during my 20
years as a Honduran army official, studying in U.S. schools, and
participating in U.S.-Honduran joint military maneuvers ... now the
North Americans have shackled and chained me in jail, and they have
treated me like a slave of the Spanish colonial period.''
   Regalado Lara, 51, was arrested in Miami on May 15, 1988, and
police said they found about 50 pounds of cocaine hidden in his
suitcase. He was convicted of importing cocaine and sentenced to 10
years in prison.
   The Honduran army discharged Regalado Lara immediately after his
arrest and the Honduran government did not intervene on behalf of
the former commander of the Honduran First Infantry Batallion.
   ``They have left me on my own,'' he said of Honduran officials.
   He was quoted as saying, ``I wish that in Honduras we could do
the same with U.S. soldiers who break the law. In my country they
open the prison doors for the North Americans to go free without
judgment.''

<TEXT>
   Premier Toshiki Kaifu of Japan met President
Carlos Salinas de Gortari on Monday night and declared that debtors
and creditors must closely collaborate if they ever hope to solve
the foreign debt problems of developing nations.
   Kaifu arrived Monday for a two-day visit, during which he is
expected to announce the January release of the first half of a $2
billion loan Japan has pledged to Mexico under the Brady Plan for
debt relief in developing countries.
   The plan is named for U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, who
proposed it.
   The Japanese loan would be used with funds from the International
Monetary Fund and World Bank in programs to reduce Mexico's $107
billion foreign debt.
   The prime minister's visit follows a July agreement between
Mexico and foreign creditor banks to reduce $53 billion of the debt.
   Kaifu is also expected to formalize Japan's offer of $1.2 billion
in aid for pollution control in Mexico City.
   Some of the money will be used for electric trains to ease
traffic congestion and cut smog, said Mario Moya Palencia, Mexico's
ambassador to Japan.
   Kaifu said in a written statement, released when his plane landed
in Mexico City: ``The problem of the accumulated foreign debt cannot
be solved, if close collaboration between the parties involved _
that is, the debtor and creditor countries _ is not achieved.''
   He said, ``My country and the region to which Mexico belongs can
take advantage of this occasion to reaffirm their mutual political
will to continue contributing to the peace, stability and
development of all countries of the world.''
   Mexico has said arrangements will be made while Kaifu is in
Mexico for a reciprocal visit by Salinas to Japan.
   Japanese investment here _ $1.5 billion is in about 200 companies
_ accounts for 6 percent of all foreign investment in Mexico.
   Japan is Mexico's second-largest trading partner after the United
States. Trade last year between the two countries was $3.4 billion,
according to Mexican government figures.
   Mexico sells Japan food, chemicals and petroleum. It buys mostly
manufactured products.
   Kaifu, who took office last month, arrived in Mexico from Boston.
He leaves for Canada on Wednesday.

   In the latest apparent strike by drug
barons, a bomb tore through shops in an industrial suburb of the
cocaine trafficking center of Medellin and wounded five people,
authorities said.
   The Sunday night attack came just hours after U.S. military gear
began arriving, along with ground crews, trainers and technicians,
for use in the government's two-week-old offensive against the
ruthless cocaine underworld.
   The bomb blast in the southern Medellin suburb of Itagui heavily
damaged a two-story commercial building including a bank, an
insurance company office, a shoe store and an optical shop, an
Itagui police spokesman said by telephone. He asked to remain
anonymous.
   Five people were wounded, Alonso Villanueva of the Colombia Red
Cross in Itagui said by telephone. The blast came half an hour
before a 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew took effect in Medellin and
several suburbs, including Itagui.

   The Army is expanding its drug testing program
to include checks for use of speed, morphine and angel dust, amid
Pentagon boasts that drug use already has dropped sharply in recent
years.
   Although there is little evidence that such drugs are being used
widely by enlisted personnel or officers, Army officials say the top
brass wants the tests as a new deterrent against drug use.
   Since 1981, all active-duty military personnel have been subject
to random urinalysis tests to check for the abuse of cocaine and
THC, the active ingredient in marijuana and hashish.
   The testing was later broadened to include the Army reserves and
National Guard, and severe penalties were imposed.

   Americans overwhelmingly favor an increase in the
federal minimum wage, even though most workers are generally
satisfied with their pay, a national poll has found.
   Nearly nine in 10 respondents to the Media General-Associated
Press poll wanted the hourly miniumum raised from $3.35, and
two-thirds of them favored the $4.55 minimum approved by Congress
but vetoed by President Bush in June.
   At the same time, six in 10 supported Bush's proposal for a
``training wage'' under which new workers could be kept at $3.35 for
their first six months on the job. Congress has not adopted that
plan.
   On other workplace issues this Labor Day, nearly four in 10
respondents said they would join a labor union at their workplace,
even though most regarded management more favorably than they viewed
unions.

   Congress faces a host of billion-dollar
spending decisions this fall, but a dispute over art and obscenity
is directing much of the attention toward a relatively small
appropriation for the arts.
   Lobbyists are waiting with blunt messages for legislators who
return to the Capitol this week from a month-long summer vacation.
   ``Make no mistake about it,'' warned a letter sent to lawmakers
by Paul Weyrich, chairman of a coalition of conservative groups.
``If you vote to block the (Rep. Dana) Rohrabacher amendment, we
will alert our members that you are on record as supporting
tax-sponsored pornography.''
   Rohrabacher, a California Republican, wants the House to adopt
Senate-passed restrictions that bar federal funding for art that is
deemed ``obscene or indecent'' or ``denigrates, debases or reviles''
people's beliefs based on religion, sex, race, creed, handicap, age

   The unnamed male cub died Sunday after 39 hours of fighting the
infection transmitted from its mother, zoo officials said.
   Although Ling-Ling is 20 years old _ the oldest panda surviving

Ling-Ling have given birth, said zoo director Michael Robinson.
   ``Behaviorally, Ling-Ling has shown every indication of being an

<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Official cover-ups of diseases affecting
cattle and horses have embarrassed agriculture officials and led to
concern that the European Economic Community may ban Spain's booming
beef exports.
   Agriculture Minister Carlos Romero has made no comment on reports
that his ministry covered up a case of rampant bovine
pleuropneumonia for four years and permitted the sale of affected
meat to the public ``for reasons of national interest.'' The disease
is not transmittable to humans.
   The European Commission, the executive body of the 12-nation EEC,
has ordered Spain to provide a detailed report on the outbreak of
the disease in 1985 in Navas de San Antonio 45 miles northwest of
Madrid, in the Castille-Leon region.
   ``This could lead to an EEC decision to prohibit beef exports,''
said Pedro Llorente, Castille-Leon's agricultural production
director.
   The value of Spanish beef exports has shot up to $39.3 million
during the first half of this year from $2 million in the same
period in 1986, according to government figures.
   Principal markets are other EEC countries such as France,
Portugal, Italy, Britain and West Germany.
   The scandal comes on the heels of the third outbreak in two years
of African horse sickness in southern Spain. The recurrence of the
deadly horse disease, a virus transmitted by insects that has
resulted in the deaths of more than 500 animals, could force a
change of venue for equestrian events scheduled for the 1992 Summer
Olympics in Barcelona.
   Critics blame the government of Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez
and reticent civil servants for perpetuating the long-held custom of
hiding problems seen as harmful to Spain's image abroad.
   The first reports of the outbreak of the disease in Navas de San
Antonio came as Spain was negotiating its entry into the EEC. It
became a member Jan. 1, 1986.
   ``Something is not working right in this nation,'' the Barcelona
newspaper La Vanguardia said in an editorial. ``There is too much
silence, based on the belief it better serves collective concerns,
even when consumers are left in the dark.''
   Critics also view the bovine pleuropneumonia scandal as
confirmation of the lack of rigor and concern on the part of public
officials for public health.
   ``Over the past four years thousands of consumers have been
fooled with the excuse that it was necessary to hoodwink the
European Community and avoid having our partners repudiate us,''
said El Pais, Spain's leading newspaper.
   ``But what will make Europe repudiate us is not that we declare
an outbreak and cattle are quarantined and destroyed ... but that
things are covered up and people pretend nothing has happened.''
   At a recent news conference, Castille-Leon's LLorente confirmed
the cover-up and said his region's officials and the Ministry of
Agriculture in Madrid agreed not to make the outbreak public.
   He called the action ``a clear case of high-risk cooperation,''
adding that such action was not rare in other European countries in
order to prevent the closing of borders to beef sales.
   The Agriculture Ministry's sole statement on the cover-up charges
placed the blame on the Castille-Leon regional government, saying it
was responsible for animal health in its territory.
   The ministry said its obligation was to declare an outbreak if
the disease was nationwide.
   The 1985-88 outbreak in Navas de San Antonio eventually forced
farmers to destroy 4,808 head of cattle, 1,604 of which tested
positive for the disease.
   But by the end of the first year only half the cattle in the town
had been destroyed, said Antonio Vazquez, the Navas de San Antonio
veterinarian who reported the first cases of the disease, which is
fatal to cattle.
   ``There's been a definite case of lack of coordination and delay
among the finance, agriculture and health ministries that has
stymied efforts to eradicate the disease,'' he said in a telephone
interview.
   Some of the affected cattle were sold to slaughterhouses and then
to the public after authorities certified the animals were infected
with bovine tuberculosis, Llorente said. The law permits the sale of
meat of cattle infected with tuberculosis but requires destruction
of all meat of cattle infected with pleuropneumonia.
   Pleuropneumonia has been largely eliminated in Western Europe.
   Spain declared the disease eradicated in 1965.

<TEXT>
   From underfertilized fields in Romania to
the tiny, private plots in Poland and Yugoslavia, the East bloc's
farmers are angry and clamoring for higher prices and more land.
   Even in Hungary, a traditionally rich agrarian nation that
exports thousands of tons of farm products each year, the farming
success story is turning sour.
   For decades in Eastern Europe, breakneck industrialization
overshadowed agriculture, which was kept starved of machinery and
fertilizers by state bureaucracies and left to subsist on low farm
prices.
   Now, East bloc farmers are serving notice they cannot survive
much longer and are demanding more from Communist governments that
need to keep food prices down for low-paid factory workers.
   In Poland, with city dwellers complaining about the high price
and scarcity of food, the subject of farm production has become one
of the most sensitive issues facing the East bloc's first
non-Communist prime minister.
   Polish farmers, displeased with the prices they were getting,
withheld their livestock and grain from the market in July,
resulting in severe shortages in the stores.
   Although a ``free market'' for food was introduced Aug. 1 in
Poland, and farmers were offered more for their produce, many were
reported holding back in hope of still higher prices.
   In Gdansk and elsewhere, Poland's farmers blocked roads with
wagons and tractors in protest. Eighty percent of Poland's farmland
is still in private hands.
   In addition to low prices, Poland's farmers, like farmers in
Hungary and Yugoslavia, complain about de facto state monopolies for
their purchases of supplies and sales of their produce.
   Polish officials are so worried about possible unrest that they
are spending some of the country's badly needed hard currency to buy
frozen meat from Western Europe.
   They hope, however, to ease tensions with deliveries of $120
million in food aid promised in early August by the European
Economic Community after President Bush's visit to Poland.
   In Yugoslavia, about 5,000 farmers wheeled their tractors to the
federal Parliament building in Belgrade on Aug. 28 in an
unprecedented protest of government attempts to curb inflation by
forcing food prices down.
   ``It is cows that should be milked, not peasants,'' said one
slogan.
   Faced with a 750 percent inflation rate, the Yugoslav government
recently flooded the market with cheap flour, wheat, sugar and other
foods from federal stockpiles to try to halt price increases.
   One of the chief problems facing Yugoslav farmers is that they
are allowed to own no more than 75 acres of land. Until last year,
that limit was just 25 acres. They call these limits artificial and
say they curb efficient farming and higher yields.
   ``We can't wait any longer,'' said Sava Govorcic, a member of a
newly formed Farmers' Initiative. ``None of our demands have yet
been met.''
   In Hungary, where private household plots on only 5.5 percent of
arable land accounted for 36 percent of all agricultural production
in 1988, the farm work force is aging and declining. Produce prices
are not keeping pace with increases in the cost of fertilizers and
other farm needs.
   State investment is declining, with the Hungarian farmers seeing
none of the extra revenue generated by several rounds of food-price
hikes imposed by a cash-strapped government this year alone.
   The farmers' anger first boiled over a year ago, when winegrowers
in Kiskoros staged the Communist nation's first agricultural
demonstration in memory, demanding change.
   In mid-August, some 2 million Hungarian workers went on a warning
strike to protest price increases on selected meat products notably
missing from many shops in the weeks before.
   Radical solutions may be coming in some countries, however.
   In Hungary in the spring, a report commissioned by the Communist
Party recommended easier lease terms and private land ownership in
agriculture.
   In a similar bid to stimulate extra production, Soviet farmers
could soon be paid in foreign hard currency for surplus grains and
seeds.
   In Romania, however, the government holds 91 percent of the
farmland and there is no sign of change ahead. Much of the country's
abundant produce goes for export, with little left for domestic
consumption.

<DATELINE>PHARAON ISLAND, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For more than 800 years, a medieval
fortress honoring the Crusader-foe Saladin knew only wars or rumors
of wars. Today, rebuilt on a tiny island in a turquoise gulf, the
picturesque citadel enjoys the fruits of peace.
   Named for the most dreaded and able Moslem warrior, Saladin's
Citadel has become a tourist mecca.
   It was little more than rubble when Egyptian antiquities
officials came in 1985. They put archaeologists and restorers to
work piecing together the long-forgotten history and architecture of
the once-proud fort, Egypt's eastern gateway, and the restoration
continues.
   But the rebuilt citadel stands again, its walls up to 100 feet
high.
   From the site in the northern Gulf of Aqaba, visitors can see
four countries with the naked eye. The fort's doorway faces Saudi
Arabia, its curving wall Jordan and Israel. The peaks of Egypt's
Sinai Peninsula and the coral reefs of the gulf complete the
panorama.
   Egyptian and foreign tourists, including many Israelis, come by
launch from mainland Egypt little more than a stone's throw away.
Others come by passenger ferry from Jordan.
   Still others, like Jordan's King Hussein and Queen Noor, pass by
in private yachts.
   Visitors from Jordan and Israel, still technically at war with
each other, scamper side by side up, down and around walls and mazes
that cover Pharaon Island.
   Nevertheless, until September, 1988, the fort's future was
uncertain, because of a protracted struggle between Egypt and Israel
over Taba, 250 acres of Israeli-held beachfront four miles to the
north, seized by the Israelis in the 1967 war.
   International arbitrators, however, have given Taba back to Egypt
and now Saladin's Citadel holds a large share of the area's tourist
market.
   At night, its lighted walls can be seen for miles against the
backdrop of the Sinai's seemingly endless starry sky.
   It's a peaceful setting now, but in the late 12th century it
wasn't so.
   Saladin spent his adult life fighting. He fought Islamic holy
wars against the Crusades' most famous knights, and he fought local
skirmishes among rival Moslem groups throughout the Middle East.
   Saladin became sultan of Egypt, Syria, Yemen and Palestine,
founding the Ayyubid dynasty in 1171.
   Known not only for his battle prowess but also his statesmanship
and courtliness, he was driven by the idea of jihad _ Islamic holy
war. In 1187 Saladin captured Jerusalem for the Moslems, which had
been in Frankish hands for 88 years.
   ``War was everywere,'' said Fahmy Abdul-Alim, director of Islamic
monuments for the Egyptian Antiquities Organization and a leading
Egyptian Islamic archaeologist.
   ``Many battles happened here. This fortress is of major
historical interest because it was the gateway to Egypt, strategic
for Saladin.
   ``He built many fortresses in Egypt, but this one is especially
important. It helped to prevent the enemy from cutting the caravan
and supply routes east and west, which enabled pilgrims to continue
making the hajj to Mecca.''
   The hajj is the pilgrimage Moslems make to Mecca, the Prophet
Mohammed's birthplace.
   Though much smaller, the fort's architecture bears some
resemblance to Saladin's masterpiece, Old Cairo's hillside Citadel.
The Pharaon Island installation was an active fort until early this
century.
   A front tower holds the remains of a roost for carrier pigeons
used by Saladin for communicating with Cairo and Damascus.
   Archaeologist Abdul-Alim said the fortress enabled the Moslem
militiamen, whose lives were difficult and lonely, to be
self-supporting for long periods.
   ``The fortress has storerooms for food and a water system that
would have allowed the soldiers to survive for months at a time
until reinforcements arrived,'' he said. ``You even have a mosque
for their religious needs.''
   During excavations last winter Egyptian archaeologists uncovered
a weapons-making area, the first such furnace at a citadel in Egypt.
   ``You have to remember how isolated this fortress would have
been,'' Abdul-Alim said. ``The soldiers naturally would have been
required to repair their weapons on the spot, make new ones if
necessary.''
   He said the archaeologists also found coins dating to the end of
Saladin's reign and a plaque with his name.
   Gamal Celiman, the island's antiquities inspector, said the
island is made of granite, which in Saladin's time was quarried and
shaped on the spot. Other stones and building materials were brought
from elsewhere.
   ``We found stones with 2,000-year-old Nabatean writing, which
probably were taken from buildings in south Sinai,'' Celiman said.
The Nabatean kingdom was based in what is now western Jordan. ``One
room was covered by a palm roof, but no palms grew here,'' he said.
   The fort had some comforts for its soldiers.
   ``There were steam baths with hot water pipes,'' Celiman said.
But the fort also provided for troublemakers.
   ``We have chains with cuffs, just in case,'' he said.

<HEAD>Homeless Census: A Thankless Task</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   On the night of March 20, 1990, about 9,000
gritty census-takers will set out on a difficult and thankless
mission: they will try to count homeless Americans.
   Their findings already are being challenged.
   Advocates of more federal spending on homelessness contend that
the count will be too low by far. And the Census Bureau doesn't deny
that, saying that it will seek only to deliver demographic, social
and economic data on components of the homeless population.
   It won't be a comprehensive survey and the numbers will be
conservative, meaning it will err on the low side. But whatever the
flaws, it will be the first major effort to count the homeless since
their plight became a national political issue.
   That's why the arguments began early. Estimates of the number of
homeless people in the United States range from 250,000 to 3
million. With that margin of error, numbers are meaningless.
   Activists demanding new and more extensive programs for the
homeless came up with the guess that there are 3 million of them, a
number that never has been substantiated but nevertheless is used in
the debate over action for the homeless.
   In May, 1984, the Department of Housing and Urban Development
reported after a six-month study of homelessness that the best
estimate of the number of homeless was 250,000 to 350,000. President
Bush said during the 1988 campaign that a 1986 Harvard study
supported the higher of the HUD figures, 350,000. An Urban Institute
report in 1988 estimated the number of homeless at 567,000 to
600,000. That also was criticized as too low by advocates for the
homeless.
   The numbers send a political signal, and that puts the census in
the middle of the debate.
   A sociologist and a housing expert contend the whole thing should
be called off. They contend the administration should ``forget about
counting the uncountable,'' and seek more money for housing programs.
   ``We believe the census will severely undercount the homeless,
pulling the rug out from under the few programs that presently
exist,'' say Richard P. Appelbaum of the University of California at
Santa Barbara, and Peter Dreier, director of housing for the Boston
Redevelopment Authority.
   ``The number of homeless people has become a political
football,'' they contend in an article in the Chicago Tribune. ``The
Bush administration, like its predecessor, does not like to think of
the problem as too big or too costly. Small problems require small
numbers, and small numbers apparently require large studies.''
   On the other side of the argument, an urban planner writing in a
conservative journal says the homeless lobby cooked up phony numbers
in order to push its demands.
   ``Prominent individuals and organizations acting on behalf of the
homeless have argued that not simply hundreds of thousands, but
millions of Americans on any given day are resigned to a life in
shelters, institutions or the streets,'' says Carl F. Horowitz.
   ``Beginning around 1983, the number 3 million _ approximately 1.2
of every 100 Americans _ has come to be reported as the benchmark
figure. Politicians, celebrities and corporations have found it a
convenient rallying point to elicit sympathy and tax deductible
contributions for the homeless.''
   In an article published by the Heritage Foundation, Horowitz
traces the number to a 1982 study by Mary Ellen Hombes, now with the
National Coalition for the Homeless, and Mitch Snyder, whose
Community for Creative Non-Violence issued the report.
   Their study concluded that about 2.2 million Americans were
homeless in 1980, and said the number ``could reach 3 million or
more during 1983.'' Snyder later said in congressional testimony
that the numbers were meaningless. The far lower HUD estimates also
were dismissed as meaningless during House hearings on the subject.
   Horowitz says a sound count of the homeless, and information on
the problems behind their homelessness, are vital in shaping
policies that can help them. ``Advocates who disparage research
about their numbers are doing a serious injustice to the people they
ostensibly are trying to aid,'' he says.
   Now the Census Bureau will try to produce meaningful figures,
counting the homeless in shelters and cheap hotels and then, after
midnight, on the streets. Census workers will seek to interview the
people they find in shelters and on the streets to get demographic
data on the homeless population. But they won't awaken any sleeping
street people. In those cases, they'll guess age, sex and race.
   ``We are measuring components of the homeless on one night, not
the dynamics of homelessness,'' the Census Bureau said in a
statement describing its survey. ``... We expect that the count of
the street component will be very conservative. A general-purpose
survey such as the census cannot provide comprehensive data on the
homeless.''
   Those caveats notwithstanding, next year's numbers are certain to
stir a new round of debate on how many Americans really are
homeless, and what the government should do about it.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar ended narrowly mixed Monday in
European trading becalmed by a U.S. holiday.
   Gold prices were mixed.
   Dealers said the absence of U.S. markets because of the Labor Day
holiday encouraged European players to spend the day on the
sidelines, and left the dollar without a direction.
   They said sentiment remained bullish, however, and several
dealers expected the dollar to resume its rise Tuesday.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose to a two-month high against the Japanese yen despite
intervention by the Bank of Japan.
   It closed up 0.68 yen at 146.13 yen. Later, in London, it was
quoted at 145.94 yen.
   In London, the dollar rose slightly against the British pound. It
cost $1.5532 to buy one pound compared with $1.5565 late Friday.
   Other late dollar rates compared with late Friday included:
1.9780 West German marks, down from 1.9785; 1.7085 Swiss francs,
unchanged from 1.7085; 6.6725 French francs, up from 6.6700;
1,417.50 Italian lire, up from 1,413.50; 1.1815 Canadian dollars,
down from 1.1817.
   In London, gold prices traded at $359.00 a troy ounce, up from
late Friday's $358.50.
   In Zurich, the bid price was also $359.00 compared with $358.40
late Friday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell 32 cents to close at a bid
$359.50.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $5.05 a troy ounce,
compared with Friday's $5.06.

<HEAD>London Shares Close Higher on Takeover Speculation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Share prices rose Monday on London's stock
exchange, boosted by takeover speculation that pushed the key FT-SE
100 Share Index higher for yet another session.
   Continued talk of potential takeovers was cited as the primary
factor in the market's continued rise above the psychologically
important 2,400-point level.
   ``The market is still afraid of selling,'' a dealer with a large
European institution said, ``as long as this takeover talk remains
active.''
   The FT-SE 100 closed at 2,419.2, up 11.7 points, or 0.05 percent,
but off from its high for the day of 2,424.5. The high was
established during a late-morning runup sparked by news of Bowater
Industries' 382 million-pound, or $592 million, bid for specialty
printer Norton Opax.
   Norton Opax subsequently rejected the bid. Bowater, which hasn't
commented on Norton's rejection, bid t increase its current 26
percent Norton stake in an effort to short circuit the company's
move to acquire De La Rue Co., another specialty printing concern,
for 484 million pounds, or $750.2 million.
   Volume on the London market was substantially below the level
Friday, when the FT-SE 100 closed above the 2,400-point level. On
Monday, only 369.9 million shares were traded, down from 533.0
million Friday.
   The narrow FT-SE 30 Share Index closed firmer as well at 2,003.6,
up 10.9 points. The FT-500 index was up 6.96 at 1,351.10.

<HEAD>`When It Rains It Pours' Girl 75 This Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The little girl has been out in the rain with her
umbrella and a container of salt for 75 years, demonstrating the
slogan that helped make Morton Salt a household standby: ``When it
rains it pours.''
   Customers still occasionally write Morton Salt Co. claiming to
know the child's true identity, but officials say she has none _
she's the figment of a forgotten artist's imagination.
   ``Some people say they modeled for the illustration. Others swear
it's their daughter or granddaughter,'' Earl C. Thorne, advertising
and promotion manager for the Chicago-based company, said recently.
   The Morton Salt girl debuted in 1914. The first of her
incarnations was as a chubby child with curly hair, standing in a
downpour with a container of salt carelessly tucked under one arm
and spilling to the ground.
   She's been made over five times since, to update her dress, hair
and face. For a while she had pigtails. These days she has sleek,
dark hair.
   But the idea is the same. All but the original are taking a step
with the right foot. All are spilling salt, though the 1956 version
and the current model, introduced in 1966, are losing just a
sprinkle, rather than pouring it out in a stream.
   And the slogan hasn't changed at all, though the scientific
process it promotes has ceased to be a novelty.
   ``In the United States, it is one of the 10 best-known symbols,''
Thorne said.
   In 1911, founder Jay Morton wanted his young company to stand out
from the competition. At the time, salt tended to cake in humidity,
making it difficult to use, and it was sold in bags.
   Morton added magnesium carbonate to prevent caking and designed
the now-familiar moisture-resistant container with the patented
spout.
   He then went to advertising agency N.W. Ayer &amp; Co. for a campaign
to promote the merits of his salt.
   When the agency came up with some ideas, Morton's son, company
secretary Sterling Morton, was struck by a drawing of a little girl
in the rain with an umbrella, salt spilling freely from the
container under her arm.
   ``Here was the whole story in a picture,'' the elder Morton
recalled some time later. ``The message that the salt would run in
damp weather was made beautifully evident.''
   The slogan was the hard part.
   The original was, ``Even in rainy weather, it flows freely.''
   Sterling Morton wanted something ``short and snappy.''
   Finally, the Mortons and the admen came up with ``When it rains
it pours.''
   The company went on to great success. In 1988, Morton Thiokol,
then an aerospace and chemical company, reported about $2.3 billion
in sales. The company, formed seven years ago when Morton
International merged with Thiokol Corp., recently split into two
companies, restoring the old names.
   The Morton Salt girl remains with Morton International, which
also makes airbag propellants and chemicals. Thiokol, based near
Salt Lake City, produces aerospace and defense equipment.

<HEAD>Dolphin Research Funding Criticized</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   H.J. Heinz Co. subsidiary Star-Kist Foods
announced a plan to fund research to reduce the number of dolphins
killed in tuna fishing nets just days before animal rights activists
plan to protest the company's alleged involvement in dolphin killing.
   Star-Kist spokesman Erik Bloemendaal said last week's
announcement of the research funds was unrelated to a protest
scheduled to take place Wednesday before Heinz's annual meeting in
Pittsburgh.
   Todd Steiner, director of the Save the Dolphins Project at Earth
Island Institute in San Francisco, which organized the protest,
called the research project ``a public relations scam.''
   The institute claims Star Kist purchases tuna caught by
encirclement nets that each year needlessly kill 100,000 dolphins.
The group said it targeted Star-Kist because it is the world's
largest tuna processor.
   Heinz has studied the possibility of funding research by the
World Dolphin Research Society since the beginning of the year, but
had not determined all the details until recently, Bloemendaal said.
   The research is intended to develop acoustic and electro-magnetic
signals to calm dolphins and guide them out of the nets.
   The World Dolphin Research Society is a non-profit organization
founded two years ago by the Aspen Research Institute of Aspen, Colo.
   Bloemendaal declined to say how much the company will spend for
the research, but called it ``a significant amount.''
   Steiner said the research funds ``would be better spent designing
alternative fishing methods.'' He said 95 percent of all tuna is
caught by methods that don't harm dolphins.
   Earth Island Institute organized a demonstration at the 1988
Heinz shareholders meeting and has asked consumers to boycott
Star-Kist tuna. The boycott has not affected sales, Heinz
spokeswoman Debbie Foster said.
   Heinz Chairman J.F. Anthony O'Reilly has said he sympathizes with
animal rights groups, but claims foreign fleets kill most of the
dolphins. Boycotting Star-Kist will not save any dolphins, he told
shareholders last year.
   ``Foreign fleets will simply sell their catch to other countries
who have little or no concern regarding the dolphins,'' O'Reilly
said.

<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Citicorp will begin issuing convertible
currency travelers checks to Hungarians later this month under an
agreement with the Hungarian National Bank, the Magyar Nemzet
newspaper reported Monday.
   The travelers checks will be issued in dollars, British pounds
and West German marks at more than 600 outlets authorized to deal in
hard currencies starting Sept. 18, said Magyar Nemzet, quoting the
official MTI news agency.
   The report said that $200 million had been designated for the
project, with the New York banking company prepared to increase the
amount if warranted.
   Although Hungarians are limited by law as to how many units of
the Hungarian currency, the forint, they may exchange each year for
convertible money, state tourist agencies and banks are running
short of hard currency, Magyar Nemzet said. The decision to issue
travelers checks was made in part to lessen the depletion of
converible currency supplies.

today by a business group.
   The Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index declined in
August to 114.7, a loss of almost six points for the month, the
group said.
   A substantial share of the decline reflects consumers' somewhat
less positive assessment of current economic conditions, the group
said. Expectations for the future are down moderately, while buying
plans are mixed, it said.

   Unemployment steadied at 5.2 percent last
month, the government said in a report prompting forecasts that the
record-long expansion will survive past its seventh anniversary.
   The government on Friday also revised its July job growth figure
upward to 184,000 from 169,000, and the June totals up again from
250,000 to 297,000, further signs that the economy continues to
expand at a pace that will keep it out of recession. The bond market
largely shrugged off the news.

   The industrial side of the U.S. economy continued
to weaken during August and a growth index fell to its lowest level
since the economic expansion began in late 1982, the nation's
corporate purchasing managers said.
   The Purchasing Managers' Index, a widely watched barometer of the
economy's direction, fell to 45.2 percent last month from 46 percent
in July. That was the lowest reading since December 1982, the month
after the beginning of the current economic expansion.
   Bond prices rose on the news as traders believed the slowdown
could lead the Federal Reserve to relax credit.

   The government said its chief economic
forecasting gauge rose in July for the first time in three months,
posting a modest 0.2 percent gain which many economists interpreted
as further evidence that a recession isn't looming.
   The Commerce Department said Friday the gain in the Index of
Leading Economic Indicators followed no increase at all in June and
a steep 1.3 percent drop in May, the biggest decline since late
1987. The index had risen 0.6 percent in April.

   Construction spending recorded a slight
increase in July as strength in non-residential building offset
weakness in housing and government projects, the Commerce Department
reported.
   The department said Friday spending rose by a tiny 0.02 percent,
a gain of $100 million, putting the seasonally adjusted annual rate
at $415.7 billion in July.
   While the July rebound was modest, analysts said it offered at
least the hope that the lengthy construction slump may be coming to
an end.

buyout proposal from a group that included the airline company's
employees, senior management and British Airways PLC.

   Dow Jones &amp; Co. said it is preparing to put an
over-the-counter market stock into its transportation average
because a wave of mergers and buyouts is making it impossible to
find enough big transport companies on the New York Stock Exchange.
   It would be the first time any of the three Dow Jones averages _
industrials, utilities and transportations _ has included a stock
that was not traded on the New York Stock Exchange.

   Fujisawa Pharmaceutical Co. announced it is
acquiring Lyphomed Inc. for about $670 million, the first major
acquisition of a U.S. drug company by a Japanese pharmaceutical
maker.
   Fujisawa has owned nearly 30 percent of Lyphomed _ about 9
million of the company's 29.9 million common shares _ since October
1986. The $31.87-a-share purchase price announced Friday exceeds
Fujisawa's $31-a-share offer the previous week. The final figure
represents an all-time high for Lyphomed shares, which are traded
over the counter.

<HEAD>Poll: Consumer Confidence Declined In August</HEAD>

   Consumer confidence dropped in August after
rising steadily for several months, according to a poll released
today by a business group.
   The Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index declined in
August to 114.7, a loss of almost six points for the month, the
group said.
   A substantial share of the decline reflects consumers' somewhat
less positive assessment of current economic conditions, the group
said. Expectations for the future are down moderately, while buying
plans are mixed, it said.
   Consumer confidence is important because of its impact on
consumer spending, which drives about two-thirds of domestic
economic activity.
   ``Although the level of consumer confidence is down, it is still,
in the context of the survey's history, reassuringly strong,'' said
Fabian Linden, executive director of the Conference Board's Consumer
Research Center.
   ``While one month is too brief a period on which to make a
long-term judgment, the magnitude of this month's decline cannot be
dismissed as inconsequential,'' he said in a statement. ``We must
wait for at least another month to see whether this is the beginning
of a trend.''
   Only 27 percent of survey participants said that current economic
conditions are good, down from 31.6 percent a month earlier. About
31 percent said they believed jobs were plentiful, down from about
33 percent in July.
   There was a modest decline, from 18.6 percent to 17.2 percent, in
the number who expect more jobs to become available over the next
six months. About 25 percent of respondents believed that their
families' financial situation would improve, a drop of about 2
percent points from July.
   Automobile purchasing plans remained unchanged at 7.1 percent of
respondents. The percentage planning to buy a home declined to 3.5
percent from 3.7 percent in July. Interest in buying a major
appliance dropped to 27.1 percent from 30.5 percent.
   The monthly survey, covering 5,000 U.S. households, is conducted
for the New York-based group by National Family Opinion of Toledo,
Ohio.
